<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lip grab and munch, that's all i can think about as the hay slowly dwindles before me. I never tried to chew tobacco but this must be quite simular. I think back and give a funny donkey's chuckle at the thought of a baseball pitcher who swallowed his chaw and fainted. <br />
<br />
Yup, even with my first mouthful of slimed and chewed hay I too swallowed hard. Odd, as I think about that time the learning experiance it was and how even now I strain to remember what this one used to eat before there was Hay.<br />
<br />
A stretch of this leg and then another, muscles ache and even my joints feel stiff. I remember something called &quot;Deep Heat Rub&quot; and how back somewhen I used it to sooth aches and pains. I bray my feelings only to see people smile and those men who feed and works us to see them laugh.<br />
<br />
Life is different here at the stable. Times of joy, times of pleasure, all mixed with sudden fights and a swift kick from some Jenny or Jack. As this life is tough so also is this coarse body to which I have been emerged into the animal world.<br />
<br />
It is something I ponder in those calm and long quiet times when there is just nothing to do but stand and hear your gut grumble. I think to myself of times long gone when I tread the earth in another way. If I strain to think, closing my eyes and really think the sights and sounds roll back from those days. Days, the very word slips from meaning anything as this wretched donkey brain holds only the most basic of memories and lets everything else slip away.<br />
<br />
Happy times, doing things for myself and also with others. Fun times, even working although what I did back then doesn't match up to what these men put me through now. Memories of a building bright with colors and lighted well to make seeing easy, not at all like our stable!<br />
<br />
&quot;Betty&quot; she was one sweetheart of a girl and we would go to... to....<br />
well I remember we went places together. Faint memories of her float around in my mind and she just didn't look like a Jenny. Her light colored skin was soft and not like tanner sun blackened leather. She was smooth to the touch and not at all like the Jennies who rub and taunt us Jacks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave&quot; he was one wild man and his jokes were the best and most well thought out I'd...ever...re..member? Yes, it was his 21st birthday and we went to Pleasure Island Amusement Park. I think back to the people we met on that paddle wheeled ferry and how some pointed and laughed? I for one ignored them and looked for a fun day. <br />
<br />
David, I turn and look to a Jack standing in one far corner of the corral. He's a loner, always alone and will bite or kick if one comes close. David, yes I remember he was red haired like a fire on his head. Now I peer across the span of this narrow dusty corral and see one roan red Jack who was David.<br />
<br />
Turnig I approach him but he reaches his head out and screams a warning bray to stay away. I stop and try to tell him of my desire to befriend my friend again. Yet all that roars out my lips and mouth is another course bray equal his.<br />
<br />
Soft brays, loud brays, they all are brays which say little and mean even less to people or those who remember when they were people. I step dangerously closer to David as his ears now swing back and he prepares for an attack.<br />
<br />
Then a wonderous thought, we can't do anything but bray but I can remember how to write! In the sand I reach out my right foreleg and with the pointed end of a hoof makes, D A V I D  on the ground.<br />
<br />
David looks, blinks, as his ear rise straight up. He brays a soft and friendly donkey sound.<br />
<br />
Again in the sand I draw, K E N and look up at David.<br />
<br />
Slowly my friend walks forward and donkey heads rub and nibble each others broad neck. We're friends again, buddies even in the flesh! We are making the corral into a large chalkboard as we write short notes and answers. <br />
<br />
Soon other donkeys, those with some memories are watching and walking closer as friendships are remembered and made. Names in the sand abound, Ken, David, Janice, Bill, Jonus, and several others. All now friends in the flesh we stand with renewed joy as we are not alone.<br />
<br />
Mutual friendship, joy of being a part of more than a team of harnessed animals we have meaning to our exsistance once again. As friends together we still show our beastly state in lax bladders and loose bowels. A Jack is still a Jack and so is a Jenny. We are in body and instincts very much animals. As I befriended a Jenny named Lucy she was enthrawled so as I was tossed an offer of sexual conquest.  <br />
<br />
My heart raced into action as hormones and pheromones flooded my senses. As she turns and with tail high and to one side she offers me what in a past life she'd never do in public. Yet I care little at that moment what the pulic or and old morals would insist. The time is now and she is part of my now. <br />
<br />
One feels the passion build and with it the lust of pleasure and procreate brings on a stiffening throughout my body. Slowly I approach<br />
she looks back with urgent desires. I bray softly that I'm coming my dear sweet one!<br />
<br />
Time, memories, friends, all stands still as our mutual pleasures are fulfilled. Lucy's moans of thrilled satisfaction, her instinctive urges now quelled. Her passion for that raw and rough intimate feelings now remove the coarseness of our lives and bodies.<br />
<br />
Oh, but I'm not without some delight and fulfillment of personal joy right now! As this one leans over his dear Lucy, buried so deep. My passion roars like a Lion in me and I want to feel this pleasure last and last.<br />
<br />
David brays at me as I turn my head and attention away from dear, sweet Lucy. I look down as he writes me his thoughts, B I G - D I C. He chuckles a silly sounding bray as if maing fun of the donkey me. I pause as Lucy looks back again. I stand buried with all to see and feel not remorse for doing what comes so natural in the animal world.<br />
<br />
I turn to respond and almost yank myself from Lucy's sweetness. A rank bray comes out of me as I'm angered by being bothered. Turning again to Lucy she droops her head and holds her stance. My thoughts are lost as the desire for pleasure takes full control. Pleasure, the one real and only true allowed thing of personal joy which has any meaning at all.<br />
<br />
Minutes pass and Lucy now is vanquished. She walks out from under me and I fall to all fours with a thud. A friendly bray is not returned as her animal instincts have total beastly control over her mind and body. Slowly my sweetheart walks to the water trough for a cool drink. <br />
<br />
I watch with David standing near as both of us reach our heads out forward, upper lips curled up we drink in her scent. I turn to look at David as he turns to look at me our muzzels bump and we bray our own delights.<br />
<br />
As I lick his ear he sniffs the air for Lucy once again. I peer down and see his flag out stretched and removing all thoughs other than those I just enjoyed. <br />
<br />
As David walk toward Lucy with primal intentions and everything flared and ready a Jenny named Alisha steps in his path. She is rank and more than willing as her passions show as did Lucy's. <br />
<br />
&quot;Any port in a storm&quot; I always say as David and Alisha meet in the middle of our community corral. As they begin their own relationship I stand off to one side and try to shake off the urge.</p>
