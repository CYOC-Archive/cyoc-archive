<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rene opened the stall door as the burly footballer prepared to wrap on it again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feb about time fruits I&#39;ve gotta.....what the hell is that coach hey coach&quot; he began to shout as Rene moved aside so he could see the latest fixture.<br />
<br />
There on his back, butt to the floor twisted and distorted pelvis and torso, head thirty times bigger with a distorted dental guard on its lips, and bent and slightly dripping cock was former team star Nick.  And true ronnie latest form his potty mouth was filled.<br />
<br />
The coach barged his way over and looked in.  &quot;Heh you do good work monsieur Rene, first and inspired urinal of a jerk and now this inspired toilet&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui sir, I did as you asked I even could not resist trying him out, of course I  felt the first flush belonged to the new owner.&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach smirked and stepped in then to the teams suprise he dropped his pants and took a seat.  They watched stunned as he grunted and added to Nick&#39;s comment.  Several crackles we&#39;re heard and a few loud splashes before paper was reached for.  Then the coach stood up and stepped to the side so they could all bear witness.  He reached out and grasped nicks cock.<br />
<br />
Nick was in a state of swirling turmoil. A fresh batch of shit had been added to his mouth, more piss and paper and now his manhood was being held.<br />
<br />
&quot;This boys is what happens when you don&#39;t put forth team spirit, team effort or s sense of family I wanna see 150% out of you boys from now on or...&quot; He pressed down on nicks cock making the former team member flush hard sucking all the shit and paper down before he refilled slightly overfull with water. &quot;You too will find better use as something else maybe a bidet maybe another shitter, maybe life sized bobble heads at the gate.  Now get rested up and ready strategy call in ten.&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabbed up his pants and looked down at the former man, &quot;well even now your lazy huh better have a look at him Rene I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s got it all together yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui&quot; rene said with a hot not of disgust and a sniff of his nose.  <br />
<br />
A plunger was produced and Nick was flushed out then rene pulled out another bottle of the chemical.  Nick whined as he was sprayed with it and rene began to shape home some more.  He soon resembled a more standard toilet with the faintest features of a human his skin even took on a more porcelain tone and his mouth bleached out.  The dental guard became a more conforming but standard &#39;U&#39; shaped seat with lid, his organs squirmed and shrank or merged as his body was given a more tank like shape and st the prompting of one of nicks former team makes he gained three flush settings as well as one of his jersey right side up number prominent in his tank.  The whole team watched and applauded as Rene worked.  When he was done the largest member of the team brusquely dropped his pants and took a seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bro this is the best&quot; he hooted as he let his cock rest in the guard and hot salty piss flowed into nicks mouth.  <br />
<br />
Nick screamed internally, the piss flowed in and the salty tang cleaned out the foul taste of the alteration goo.  The wash was.short lived as tank began to fart and then his asshole opened and long logs began to coil the bowl.  Nick&#39;s screams took on a fever pitch, tank had had a hefty lunch and lived up to his name dropping long log after long log as his cock grew hard and he sprayed into he guard more piss his flow waxing and waning as his ass passed long length.  Nick&#39;s mind began to break as the torment continued.  Tank was just finishing up with his shit when he noticed his hard coxk and decided that while he was there polishing his knob would be a great relief.  <br />
<br />
He grasped it and began to pump the already semi hard cock grew to full mast and began to dribble milky pre as the desperate linebacker pummeled it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwwwww fuck yeahhhhh a great shit a great piss and now a great wannnnnnnkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!!!!&quot; He cried as rope.after rope shot out of his cock hit the guard and dribbles down slowly.  <br />
Tank grabbed the paper and cleaned up them stood looked down at nick and smirked<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope it was good for you as it was for me big guy&quot; <br />
<br />
He groped nicks cock and playfully massaged it, despite it&#39;s now rigid and simpler form it still dribbled as.kt was.played with and when tank flushed Nick was sent on a spin.<br />
<br />
The flush had been altered, one for piss one for simple shits and now the one tank had pulled the long slow cleaning flush.  Nick felt like his stomach filled.witj cold water had just drained k to his head, he also felt like he&#39;d been kicked in the balls to a full orgasm it felt slightly nice at first but when it just kept going it began to be painful as the water swirled round his mouth the shit and piss mixed in flavor the cum didn&#39;t help matters it was bitter and salty and then it was like someone had forced him to swallows several gallons of water at once.  It wasn&#39;t going back ronnie stomach but it felt like it was, then with a turn it was the sudden overfull need to shit hitting his Intestines before it all gushed down the sewer pipe wedged painfully in his ass.  Nick&#39;s mind broken already took the last turn he realized his sanity had split he lived now for the flush and partially for the use, while the rest of his mind began screaming at the horror of it all. He was now the teams mvt most valuable toilet and he was ready for it.</p>
