<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Rick smiled as he walked through the park. It was pretty peaceful here with the birds chirping and squirrels scampering here and there 
and at 39 he was glad to be anywhere that was peaceful. He sat down on a bench and opened a bag of peanuts he had with him. He had 
been to Washington DC and the squirrels in the park would come up and take the peanuts right out of your hand if you offered it to them. 
He was wondering if the squirrels here would do that too. He started out slow throwing the peanuts on the ground to see if they would 
come down and take it. A couple did come down though they were very wary and scampered back up into the trees as soon as they had 
picked up the peanuts. He was about to throw another peanut when his whole body started tingling. He just had enough time to wonder 
what was causing it when the tingling turned to extreme pain. He would have let out a scream but he passed out before he could</p>
<p>Rick slowly started regaining consciousness. The first thing that he noticed was he laying on the ground. There were a couple of 
things wrong though. The first was that it felt like he didn't have any clothes on and the second was that the grass felt different. He started 
moving a little bit and that's when he heard a female voice say, "She's starting to wake up."</p>
<p>A male voice replied, "It's about time. The longer this takes the more likely something will decide that we're a good snack.</p>
<p>"Oh you can handle anything that comes along Pip," the female voice said the flattery evident in her voice.</p>
<p>"I do have limits Cotton," Pip said. "We should pick her up now and head back."</p>
<p>Cotton sighed and said, "We don't know what will happen if we move anyone who was rendered unconscious by whatever happened 
and I will not take the chance of it possibly causing her harm."</p>
<p>Rick opened his eyes to see two people standing beside him. Well people might have been the wrong word to use since they had 
wings attached to their backs. One of them was clearly female since she had nice sized breasts, long cotton candy pink hair done up in 
pigtails, and female genitals. That last was plain to see since she wasn't wearing any clothing at all. Her wings looked like they came off of 
a monarch butterfly if that monarch butterfly had hot pink wings. She must be Cotton. The other one had to be Pip then. He was a little 
taller than Cotton with yellow dragonfly wings. His hair was down to his shoulders and tied back in a ponytail. He was completely naked 
like Cotton but his crotch was completely flat with what looked like a small slit where male genitals should be. Though their appearance 
wasn't the only odd thing. There was what appeared to be grass behind them and it was taller than Pip but it had to be something else. Pip 
glanced at him and said, "She's awake now. Darkness approaches and we need to get back to the village before it falls."</p>
<p>"You're right we do need to get back now that she's awake," Cotton said nodding. She came over to Rick and held out a hand.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" Rick asked and was surprised to hear his voice sound like a little girl's. "And why are you naked?</p>
<p>"We're fairies and our natural state is to be naked," Cotton said smiling. "You're a fairy now too and a pretty one at that with your silver 
hair and wings. Would you mind if I called you Silva?"</p>
<p>"Well I don't mind," Rick said a little bewildered. He took Cotton's hand and stood up. Once up he felt his hair and found that it was 
long and felt like it was braided. He brought the braid to the front so he could see it and it was indeed silver. Not the gray color of hair that 
people call silver but actual silver color with the glittering sparkle. His eyes went wide and he looked down at his crotch which was flat 
though that didn't mean much. He lowered a hand to between his legs and found the genitals of a girl.</p>
<p>"I'll create the tunnel," Pip said and flew up in to air a little bit.</p>
<p>"What does he mean by that?" Rick asked trying to get his, or her now, head around this.</p>
<p>"Well we need to get back to the village fast and my wings aren't designed for fast flight unlike your's and Pip's," Cotton said with a 
little smile. "Also at our new height the village is far away. I just hope they've been working on it instead of arguing who would be queen or 
even if there should be one."</p>
<p>"How tall are we?" Silva asked looking around.</p>
<p>"Well Pip is an inch tall," Cotton said looking like she was doing some quick math in her head. "I'm point nine inches and I think you're 
about point seven inches which would make you about eight years old."</p>
<p>Silva saw Pip's wings begin to glow and beat faster. In a flash of yellow light he was gone and what looked like a tunnel of light was 
where he had been. "What just happened?" she asked looking at Cotton.</p>
<p>"Pip created a tunnel that will take us to the village," Cotton said with a little smile. "Do you know how to fly?" After Silva shook her 
head Cotton sighed and said, "I didn't think so. You'll have to hold on to me then. Just don't obstruct my wings or we won't be able to get 
to the tunnel."</p>
<p>Silva nodded and wrapped her arms and legs around Cotton which caused her new genitals to rub against Cotton's stomach coming 
close to her crotch. Thinking about that she asked, "Why doesn't Pip have male genitals?"</p>
<p>"He does though they're normally retracted into his body like other male fairies," Cotton said as she began flying. "Now hold any other 
questions you may have until after we've reached the village."</p>
<p>They were just about to enter the tunnel when Silva wondered what she would see on the other side.</p></p>
