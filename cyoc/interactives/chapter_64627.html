<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vanessa rushed down the stairs and out the front door but stopped short when she reached the lawn. There was an old beat up clunker parked by the curb that had not been there when she had entered her friends house. She looked around but didn't see anyone. She started around the house, down a small stone path that lead through the back gate. She saw him. He had his face against a window, hands shielding his face from glare, trying to pear though one of the house's lower windows. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Who the fuck are you? And what the fuck do you think you are doing?&quot; Vanessa snapped sharply. She grinned when the boy stumbled back and fell on his ass. She realized she knew him. He went to their school, she knew that, but she couldn't think of his  name.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I was just looking for Jeniffer.&quot; He muttered, pulling himself to his feet. Vanessa cocked an eyebrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;You were just looking for her? Through a window? You know her bedroom is on the second floor right?&quot; The boy looked blank for a second and looked up at the house. &quot;Also, you parked your car on the front curb... Don't go window peeping much do you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't trying.. I was just..&quot; He stammered. Then another thought occurred to Vanessa. Why would a boy that clearly had no idea what he was doing be trying to spy on Jen? Unless he knew something about what was happening to her! She stepped forward, coming closer to the boy. When she was almost within reach she lunged for him and using a judo move she wrenched his arm behind his back and slammed him face first against the side of the house. He didn't even have time to react. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; She said softly, her lips close to his ear. He struggled a little but the pin was quite painful and he relented quickly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle.. Kyle Perkins. I go to your school.&quot; The name didn't mean much to her but that didn't mean Jen wouldn't know of him. &quot;You know what is going on with her.&quot; She said, half in question half in statement. He didn't say anything so she gave his wrist a little twist, sending pain shooting up her arm. He yelled but she only pushed his head harder against the house and kept twisting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! Alright! I did it. Let go!&quot; He moaned loudly. Vanessa didn't let go but she stopped twisting his arm and he relaxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Kyle.. Unless you want to be the one armed wonder for the rest of your life you better get talking.&quot; Kyle wimpered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I used transform or dare on her.&quot; He mumbled, is lips being half pressed into the siding. Vanessa started to twist once again but stopped when he started talking again. &quot;Wait! Wait! I swear to you it's true. It's real.&quot; Vanessa hesitated, thinking fast.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you used the curse on her and made her into what? A pussy-less horny freak?&quot; She pressed him harder into the wall. &quot;Why doesn't she know about this? Can you change her back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have the curse to pass on anymore. The person cursed gets the power.&quot; He grunted, sweating now. &quot;She doesn't remember because she waited the whole minute and got both. I dared her to forget.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what? That doesn't make sense, how can you dare her to forget? She couldn't force herself to forget..&quot; Vanessa asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;The magic will force you to comply with the dare if its possible for you to comply. All I know is that it worked.&quot; Vanessa paused a moment and then pulled him away from the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, you are coming with me and we are going to try and fix this.&quot; She shoved him toward the gate and up to the house. He walked slowly, holding his arm. He didn't try and escape. When they reached the bedroom Jen didn't even notice them. She was still completely naked, siting on the floor by the end of her bed. Her arms were wrapped tight around the bed post and she was grinding her crotch into the base and licking the wooden ball that toped the post. He breasts bounced to either side of the wooden pole as she rocked. Kyle laughed and Vanessa slapped him in the back of the head. They waited. When Jen had finished loudly, spitting her cum from her lips, she lay back panting. Her hands still fondled herself. <br />
<br />
Vanessa shut the door and shoved Kyle into a corner, glaring daggers at him. She walked quickly over to her friend and started talking. &quot;Jen? Can you hear me? I found the asshole that did this to you and I think I have an idea of how to fix this.&quot; Jen looked at her friend dazedly, smiling a little, and nodded. Vanessa hurried to Kyle and brought him to face the girl he had so ruthlessly changed. &quot;This is the little prick. He used Transform or Dare on you and you have to us it back on him and force him to change you back.&quot; She had thought about letting her friend use the curse on her but she didn't think she trusted her friends state of mind right now. This, she felt, was a much safer course of action. <br />
<br />
Jen was starting to rub herself faster and Vanessa knew she better hurry. &quot;Okay Jenny, focus. Ask him Transform and dare...&quot; Vanessa stepped behind the now pale boy, holding him in place. Jen looked up at him grinning, wiggling her hips faster and faster. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transssform or Darrrre.&quot; She purred at the terrified boy. Before the last word was out of her mouth Vanessa reached over and wrapped one arm around his throat, putting him in a sleeper hold and waited as he struggled until he passed out. That ought to give us at least a minute she thought to herself. Jen finished once again in a loud gurgling moan.. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, listen to me again.&quot; Vanessa started. &quot;When that creep wakes up you will tell him he gets both and use the dare to make him change you back. Then we can use the transformation to get him back.&quot; Somewhere within Jens sex filled eyes Vanessa saw a glint of heat at the thought of revenge...</p>
