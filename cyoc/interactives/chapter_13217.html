<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What am I gonna wear to school today?” Peter thought to himself, as he groggily sat on the edge of his bed. It was six o’clock in the morning, and Peter had to make the first decision of the day: Deciding on what to wear to school.<br />
<br />
Ty and Dustin were still asleep, and the house was all dark and quiet. The only sound was the ticking of the old grandfather clock in the living room. Peter walked to the kitchen and got a glass of water, which he finished in one big gulp, before he headed back into his bedroom.<br />
<br />
As soon as he walked in the room, he looked over himself in the tall mirror, which was attached to the door of his closet.<br />
<br />
He was six-foot-three-inches tall, which was relatively tall for a sixteen year-old kid. He still had his usual short, brown hair which was spiked on top, and the big, blue eyes. He had some muscle, but nothing to be amazed about. He wasn’t so hairy either, and he did shave just about every other day. He was relatively content with his body, and he knew that he could change things whenever he wanted. But he wasn’t in the mood to create too much attention for himself in school, for he just wanted to go to class, take notes, do the homework, and then come home so that he could go to swimming practice or play basketball.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a strange feeling came over him. It was coming. A warm wave of magic was passing through his body, and he felt it going through him. It was examining his body. He felt a tingling feeling in his legs, which slowly worked the way up his quads and then passed through his groin and his cock.<br />
<br />
Then he felt the magic go through his stomach, slowly climbing up to his pectorals. The wave then split in two parts, as one half went through the left arm, and the other through the right. For a moment, Peter could only stand and gasp, as he knew that something was going to happen to him. Several of his friends possessed some very powerful magic, and Peter was, just like Dustin, always a favorite target for the magicians in the family to “practice” on, especially if Dustin wasn’t home.<br />
<br />
The wave made its ways down the arms, stopping briefly at the biceps, before flowing down to the fingers at the end of each hand. Then the wave passed through his back, his neck, and finally his head. Peter now knew that someone had zeroed in on him, and their power was checking out every inch of his body, before executing the person’s wish.<br />
<br />
“Oh boy…” Peter gasped. “Here it comes…. I feel like I’m gonna GROW!”<br />
<br />
It started with his legs. Suddenly, his calves started to inflate like balloons. As they continued to grow, he could feel the bone structure in his legs changing, as if it needed to grow thicker in order to allow for a dramatic weight increase. Two soccer ball-size slabs of round muscles were now jutting out of the back of his legs, making him look like a cyclist or a professional rugby player!<br />
<br />
His massive calves seemed to stop when they were the size of grapefruits, and slowly small, thin veins began to surface on the skin, allowing for the blood to flow to the new monster muscles.<br />
<br />
Next came the quads, which rapidly started to expand as well. Not only did Peter feel the muscles grow bigger, but his bone structure was changing as well. His bones were growing much thicker than before, in preparation for the dramatic increase in muscle in the upper body as well.<br />
<br />
Layer upon layer of muscle began to form over the quads, making them each inflate to over two feet in diameter! Veins started crawling all over the massive legs, and Peter constantly needed to adjust his stance because of the growth. Every time his quads grew thicker, he had to spread his legs out. The position was comfortable, until the quads had become so thick, that he had to adjust again. All this was going on while the helpless teen continued to stare at his changing body in complete shock!<br />
<br />
As soon as the growth spurt stopped, Peter had to take a deep breath. His body already felt much heavier than before, and he looked like a freak having such incredible legs which were completely out of proportion with the rest of him. He began to wonder if the growth spurt was now over, or was it just getting geared up for the big finale?<br />
<br />
He looked down in amazement as he witnessed how several different lumps of rock-hard muscle had formed over his legs, and he began to think that the growth was finally over.<br />
<br />
Then there came that feeling again. It was an intense tingling feeling, which had now manifested itself in his cock. He felt something going on inside of his balls, as it seemed that his upper body began to widen a little more. His waist grew wider as well, forcing him to adjust his leg position once more, as his body was preparing for the next spurt.<br />
<br />
All of the sudden, it hit him. First off, his cock began to elongate, bursting clear through the thin, cotton fabric which made up his small underwear. His body was now striking against those old, tight and worn out clothes that Peter liked to wear, and it was demanding new, bigger clothing. Peter just stood there, in complete helplessness, as some outside powerful force was making it known that it had absolute control over the muscular structure of his physical body. And it was going to make him grow no matter what, regardless if Peter liked it or not!<br />
<br />
His cock slowly stretched from 7 inches to almost 16 inches long, widening as fast as it grew longer as well. When the growth had stopped, Peter just looked over in shock, since he had never been this big before in his life!<br />
<br />
The wave immediately turned heading north, and the abdominals were next! Large, round thick rocks of hardened muscle started coming to the surface of the boy’s skin, with lines and curves separating each muscle. The curves gave a clear indication that this kid had abs that were just to die for, and he realized that as he was observing his growing body in the ever-shrinking mirror.<br />
<br />
Then there came the pecs! The two spheres of muscle which were covering his chest rapidly inflated to freakish proportions, almost reaching the dimensions of basketballs! He felt them as they were being blown up as if someone was pumping air inside of a balloon! <br />
<br />
The delts and the lats on his back expanded as well, since they had to give additional support to the newly grown muscles. Peter suddenly could see his wings on the back, which defined the V-form in his back. Not only that, but the entire area surrounding his pecs to the arms began to inflate as well, leaving giant curves of muscular spheres populating his shoulders from one arm across the back to the other arm. He was suddenly becoming massive!<br />
<br />
Next there came the biceps, which grew as well as the triceps which complimented them. The biceps turned into big melons, which populated his arms, every time he would raise them.<br />
<br />
As the arms continued to expand, peter felt his ribs expand as well, in order to allow for the additional muscle mass on his body. His arms were slowly being pushed outwards away from the body, since his shoulders kept on growing wider. Eventually, his forearms were inflating as well, as the muscles that worked the fingers began to grow in proportion to the rest of his magnificent muscular growth.<br />
<br />
Finally, everything came to a halt, and Peter realized that his body stopped growing. He struggled to move at first, with his arms feeling so massive, that he could barely touch his waist with them, that’s how far away they were hanging from his body. He gently took a step forward, startling as the wooden floor under his feet creaked out of protest as it strained to uphold the massively muscular teen. <br />
<br />
He didn’t know how heavy he was, but he felt like he must have weighed over 500 pounds at that moment! There he was, standing naked in his bedroom, looking over at his humongous muscles, which had grown out of the blue, in protest of what clothes he was going to wear to try to cover them.<br />
<br />
There he was; this huge muscular behemoth, which just had his muscles explode out of his body. The massive teen gently turned and walked to the closet, trying his best not to break anything with his incredible strength. He then grabbed the first shirt that was hanging in his closet, and pulled it out so he could look at it in the light which was hanging over his head in the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the shirt seemed much too small for him, and he just hung it back in the closet.<br />
<br />
As he walked over to the mirror, he came back to the first question that came to his mind. Only this time, the issue wasn’t just about choice, now it was about the possibility of even finding anything that would cover his muscular body?<br />
<br />
The teen bodybuilder then closed his eyes and made a silent wish to himself. He wished for his muscles to shrink back to normal.<br />
<br />
He then opened his eyes and looked at his reflection in the mirror, with the hope that his body would change back before he went to school. He stood there and waited.<br />
<br />
Nothing happened.<br />
<br />
He then realized that he was going to remain that way, and he needed to find something else to wear to school.<br />
<br />
Peter then turned towards his closet, realizing that he would need a little magic in order to make his clothes big enough to cover his body.<br />
<br />
“What am I gonna wear to school today?” the giant muscle kid thought, as he pondered how he was going to cover his incredible, new muscular body.</p>
