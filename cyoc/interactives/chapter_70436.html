<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben woke up and sat up. He was groggy but as he came fully awake, he realized that he had just sat up. He looked down and sure enough, he <br />
had legs again. He began to feel himself all over and assured himself that he was fully intact and human again. Breathing a sigh of relief, he <br />
looked around to see what kind of situation he had woken up in. He was naked and he wasn't in bed. He was sitting on a hard wooden surface <br />
that stretched away into the distance. He looked up and saw there was a ceiling far above him. Just then a coffee cup was set down near him <br />
and Ben realized that he was only just a little bit taller than a coffee cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben looked up to see the blond he had tried to invade the day before. &quot;Uh, hello. What just happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
The blond said, &quot;You think I'm supposed to know? I was just minding my own business about to take a shower in my own home when you <br />
rained down on me in your white gooiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben said, &quot;Uh yeah, well I don't know what has been happening either. All I know is that yesterday, I believe it was yesterday, I was attacked by <br />
white gooiness and then I became white gooiness myself. I don't know how I became a tiny human.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blond said, &quot;Well, fortunately for you, I do happen to know a lot about what is going on. Every once in a while, an individual develops <br />
magical powers. It is completely random and it is rare. I happen to be one of these fortunate ones which is why when you attempted to invade <br />
me last night, I was able to defend myself from your rudeness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben blushed, &quot;Uh, yeah, sorry about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about it.&quot; the blond said, &quot;If I was in your condition, I probably would have done the same thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben still blushed, &quot;So a magician did this to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The blond said, &quot;Yes and no. An unfortunate thing about this magic is that it usually manifests itself while a person is developing sexually. <br />
After you tried to invade me, I alerted some of my fellow magicians and we tracked down and found out who started this mess. His name is Ty <br />
and he's fifteen. He's manifesting magic later than usual but as is typical, his hormones are in control. After a while, he'll learn to control his <br />
hormones and then he'll be able to control the magic but for now, Ty isn't in control. His magic is wild and chaotic. It has already changed at <br />
least fifty people into cum. It's like an epidemic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben asked, &quot;Will it turn everyone into cum?&quot;<br />
<br />
The blond said, &quot;No, it's chaotic magic without control. There's no way to predict what all it will do. The only thing we can predict is that it will <br />
be sexual in nature and that it will be particularly in line with Ty's sexuality. From that, we can be certain that Ty is at least bisexual if he isn't <br />
fully gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you stop it?&quot; Ben asked.<br />
<br />
The blond said, &quot;Unfortunately, when the magic first manifests, it is very powerful and very chaotic. As we get older, it weakens. The few other <br />
magicians and I are doing what we can but it's like a wildfire. It's hard to contain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben asked, &quot;If this has happened before, why haven't I heard about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The blond said, &quot;We magicians are usually on the alert and catch it before it gets this bad. This case caught us by surprise. My name is Pete, by <br />
the way. I happen to be related to Ty as a cousin by blood and one of the reasons this caught us by surprise is that the magic rarely manifests <br />
itself in people who are related by blood. So we were all looking at other potentials and discounted Ty as having any magical potential. In fact, <br />
we mistakenly thought Dustin, his foster brother, had more magical potential than Ty did. We were wrong but we're going to get this mess <br />
cleaned up eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben said, &quot;Good, so you're going to restore me now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;I can't do that. Like I said, Ty's power is very strong right now and very chaotic. We're doing what we can but it is going to be a fight. <br />
We don't even now how far this magical wildfire has spread yet or how many people have been affected. Also, Ty and company are still on the <br />
loose purposefully spreading this magic around. We magicians are not completely immune. Just look at what you did to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete stood up and lowered his pants revealing smooth skin where his genitals should have been.<br />
<br />
Pete continued, &quot;If I hadn't reacted with a defensive spell, who know what would have happened to me. As it is, I wasn't quick enough to <br />
prevent you from becoming my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben asked, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;You are my cock now. I've given you a human form and restored some of your mental reasoning but I can't completely restore you to <br />
human. When I need to pee, it's coming out of your mouth. For all intents and purposes, you are going to do everything my cock would do and <br />
you are going to feel the same feelings my cock would feel. I was only able to make it possible for you to walk around and talk like a human <br />
but you are still a cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben gulped, &quot;So what do we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was taking a much needed break.&quot; Pete said, &quot;I've been busy all night doing what I could but I need to get back out there again. I just <br />
came home for a cup of coffee and to retrieve my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben asked, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;I let you sleep a while because I wanted to talk to you as a human but I desperately need to pee now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben felt deflated, &quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;So get in my underwear where you belong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben asked, &quot;Why do I have to get in your underwear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;Because you are my cock. That's where you belong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben protested, &quot;But I'm a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;Not really. Listen, I'm being merciful here since I know this wasn't your choice. But frankly, I don't know you well enough to care how <br />
you feel. You invaded my home and tried to invade my body in order to become my cock. It's only right that you replace the cock you took from <br />
me. Besides, I'm sure you'll feel more at home in my underwear than you realize. I wasn't able to completely restore your mind and so you do <br />
have a desire to be my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben asked, &quot;Does everyone affected by this magic want to be a cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;To varying degrees. Like I said, the magic is chaotic. With Ty's hormones in control, it does seem to create a desire to be a cock <br />
among people who never had such a thought before. But it doesn't completely replace who a person is. We found one guy who hates fags with <br />
a passion and now he hates himself because he has this uncontrollable lust for men but it didn't replace his hatred of fags. His suffering is <br />
horrible and he beats himself up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben said, &quot;I don't want to be your cock. You're a nice enough person that you and I could be friends but I don't want to be anything other than <br />
friends with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;I know. I also like you and could easily be friends with you and I don't want you to be my cock either. But that is what you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben said, &quot;Alright. I know you are right. I don't want to be your cock but I do feel like I belong in your underwear. Staring at your crotch makes <br />
me feel like that's my home. I even feel a horny desire for you to rub me to orgasm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;I know, I feel the same desire. But don't worry. I'll let you out from time to time and we can talk and get to know each other. Maybe <br />
we'll become friends after all. But right now, I really need you bad to be my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben felt intense pleasure as Pete grabbed him. Part of him was looking forward to the experience.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
As it stands right now, at least 50 people have been affected by the magic including:<br />
<br />
Ty, Dustin and Jason (Ty is passively being Dustin's cock and Dustin is leading the group to create more cock boys. Jason is split into being <br />
more than one cock.)<br />
<br />
Nine members of the swim team (Ben is now Pete's cock. Jack resents being Dustin's cock but has rarely been anything else. Steven, Matt, <br />
Aaron, Alex, Andy, Eric and Zach are fully engaged in an orgy changing between being cocks or humans at will)<br />
<br />
All twelve members of the basketball team (Zack and Randy are actively helping Dustin to create more cock boys. The rest of the team is part of <br />
the same orgy as the swim team.)<br />
<br />
The entire football team. (The size of the team was never specified. Aaron, Ricky, and Rusty are also helping Dustin create more cock boys. The <br />
rest are part of the orgy.)<br />
<br />
Two gay bashers (Tony M and Tony R)<br />
<br />
And now, one magician named Pete has also been affected and now has Ben for a cock.<br />
<br />
Between them all, they have produced tons of cum that has been spread all over the city especially near the high school but much of it has <br />
already found it's way into the water system to spread to who knows where creating more cock boys.</p>
