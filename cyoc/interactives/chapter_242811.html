<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff continued to sit on his bed as he tried to decide on what to do next. He probably should be worrying and panicking; after all, the Chronivac had given him a new body and placed him in an entirely different life. Yet, he wasn’t.<br />
<br />
The longer Jeff sat on his bed and examined his new bedroom, the more familiar everything felt. From the figurines and action figures on the shelves of his bookshelf to the posters of superheroes and sci-fi movies on his wall, everything just felt… normal. As if this had always been how his room looked, and… how his body was.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down at his new form—the overweight and hairy body he had been given—and raised his left arm to his face. Thick brown hairs could be seen racing up his forearm to the back of his hand, which was now larger and contained plump, blunt fingers. He clenched his hand into a fist and felt a semblance of power in his new form. Although he was out of shape, there was something in all of that fat of his that gifted him with more strength.<br />
<br />
Shifting his focus from his hand, Jeff caught sight of his PC. “Hmm… I guess if I’m stuck like this for the next 24 hours, I’d better find out more about my new self.” His voice came out deeper but at an adequate level. Masculine but not intimidating.<br />
<br />
Jeff got off his bed, the mattress groaning as he did so, and walked over to his computer. His first monitor was still displaying the Chronivac. Jeff sat down in the gaming chair now positioned in front of his desk, the chair feeling comfortable and well-used, and pulled himself as close to the desk as his new belly would allow.  Once he had, he was able to properly read what was stated on the computer screen:<br />

Jeff finished reading and took everything in all at once. “Wait… I’m gay now?” he asked aloud, his new sexuality apparently being the most surprising. Instantly, the former straight teen could see memories of himself in his new body at a younger age. <br />
<br />
He was 12 and had started to become interested in sexual matters. However, unlike his male classmates who became fascinated with girls, Jeff had found obsessing more over said classmates instead. It was then that Jeff knew he was gay. After that, Jeff stayed in the closet until his sophomore year of college, when some LGBT friends of his in the coding club had helped him feel comfortable enough to come out. Now everyone knew, and Jeff hadn’t had any negative experiences from it.<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head lightly, clearing the memories that felt so real and personal in spite of only having been created minutes ago when he chose to wear the shirt he was currently wearing.<br />
<br />
“I-I’m not gay,” Jeff said, but he knew he was just flat out lying to himself. The former teen could sense zero attraction to women within him. Yet, he did see an attraction within him. Specifically, to a single person. <br />
<br />
It was a handsome guy around his age with short black hair and an athletic frame. New memories told him that it was his coworker and roommate, Maddux. The two had met in college while getting the same major and became fast friends. Coincidentally, they had both gotten a job at the same company after graduating. After that, it had only made sense for the two of them to become roommates and move into the same apartment.<br />
<br />
However, new Jeff was crushing hard on Maddux. After a few months of getting to know Maddux, Jeff had become infatuated with his friend, but his shy nature kept him from ever confessing his feelings. On top of that, he knew Maddux was bisexual, which meant he stood a chance of his feelings being reciprocated. Unfortunately, knowing this just made it harder for him to confess.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what? Maddux? Apartment?” Jeff said in a confused manner, his face bright red from rummaging through his new memories. On one hand, Jeff felt awed to now be living in his own place and not with his parents. On the other, he was feeling flustered from his newfound crush on his new friend.<br />
<br />
A buzzing from his phone broke him out of his dazed state. Pulling his phone out of his pocket, he found another notification coming from the same delivery app: “Your weekly order of pizza and energy drinks will arrive in 10 minutes.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s large stomach grumbled, almost as if sentient and awakening from sensing the incoming food delivery. Trying to calm it down, Jeff stroked his big belly and realized that he was feeling pretty famished. And he didn’t have to look through any of his new memories to know his appetite had grown tremendously. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked back at the Chronivac. He knew more about his new self now, but despite having more knowledge, could he successfully live in this brand new life for a full day?<br />
<br />
Well, it didn’t seem like he had much of a choice. The Chronivac wouldn’t let him make any new changes until 24 hours passed. So, whether he liked it or not, this was his life now. Jeff let out a loud sigh.</p>
