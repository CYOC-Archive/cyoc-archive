<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A grin playing across his face, the fat man gazed into the basin of water, surprised and pleased by what he saw. After having enacted his spell on the four giggling girls, he&#39;d hurried to his car as fast as he could waddle, squeezed into the driver&#39;s seat and moving faster than the posted speed limit, he&#39;d quickly made his way home to watch via the limpid pool of water he kept for such an occasion. Turning away, thinking, he peered at five, ancient-looking wooden statues.<br />
<br />
Delirious with pleasure, curious about what he&#39;d witnessed, he moved over to the nearest of the five, a towering warhorse. He was pleased by what he saw that had transpired so far with Diane&#39;s transformation, yet, at the same time, he wondered how, and why, the spell had also ensnared the girl&#39;s boyfriend. Shrugging, figuring it was a bonus, he smiled and reached out. Patting the flank of the horse, he whispered, &quot;Soon, my sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
April watched as Diane exited the bus, making the usual jokes about her friend and her boyfriend as the other girl left. From the seat in front of her, Bets snorted, &quot;Give it a rest. Just because you can&#39;t manage to hold onto a guy...&quot; and trailing off, she left the rest of the sentence unsaid.<br />
<br />
A quick glance at her friend, April was about to snap out something about how she was still looking for Mr Right. Instead, holding her piece, she leaned back, spread her legs as far as her skirt would allow and yawned. In the seat across, Chastity made a bubble with her gum and asked, &quot;So what exactly are we going to do tonight?&quot; and reaching for her purse, she took out a nail file and began working at the nails on her right hand.<br />
<br />
Suddenly not feeling so well, April shrugged and commented, &quot;Whatever,&quot; as she shifted in her seat and crossed one leg over the other.<br />
<br />
From in front of her, Bets commented, &quot;Maybe we could just hang out at Chastity&#39;s? You&#39;re mom will get us some beer, right. Of course, if we do that, we&#39;ll have to get a hold of Diane.&quot;<br />
<br />
No longer really caring, though the prospect of getting alcohol kind of sounded interesting, especially since Chastity&#39;s mom was cool enough to buy them booze, so long as they didn&#39;t get too drunk, make a mess or do anything really stupid, April shrugged and said, &quot;I can get a hold of Diane, it&#39;s no problem,&quot; which it wasn&#39;t, as the other sixteen-year-old girl only lived a block over from where April lived.<br />
<br />
One of the other girls saying something, April missed what it was, but figured it wasn&#39;t too important. The cramped sensation she was feeling, plus the tingling sensation in her groin starting to bother her, April glanced out the window and was glad that the bus was almost to her stop. Reaching up to pull cord signal her stop, she told Bets and Chastity, &quot;Call me, okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other two nodding, and Chastity replying, &quot;All right,&quot; April waited until the bus had barely stopped before standing up. Telling her friends, &quot;Talk to you later,&quot; she adjusted her purse and exited through the back door of the bus. Thinking the reason she felt the way she did was because she was getting her period, though the tingling sensation did bother her a bit and reminded her of the pins and needles feeling she experienced when her foot had fallen asleep, she huffed and started to walk, the heels of her boots making a sharp clicking noise as she walked.<br />
<br />
Home, the feeling growing to the point of also a warmth from between her legs, April let herself into the empty house. Figuring her mom was would probably be working until eleven, her dad until ten and her brother, Jason, would likely be at soccer practice and then would go over to his friend&#39;s place, she headed upstairs to the bathroom. Grabbing the box of tampons from the cupboard, she headed for her room. Sitting down in front of her computer, she dropped the box on the desk, but didn&#39;t open the box.  Instead, starting to feel amorous, which she figured explained the warmth, she leaned back and stared up at the ceiling, certain she was getting her period, yet, also feeling feeling she wasn&#39;t and what she was feeling was something.<br />
<br />
Unsure what else it could be, she absently clicked on her computer. Thinking she might check her email accounts and the instant message services, &quot;Maybe see if Diane is online,&quot; she mused, April instead typed in the address for a search engine and, as if observing from a distance, she began to enter specific parameters.<br />
<br />
Website links popped up and clicking on one, she found herself on a nature website about foxes. The cramped sensation in her abdomen growing, as the tingling and warmth also increased, she shifted in her chair. Spreading her legs, liking the images of the vixens, especially the ones in heat, she yipped in excitement, reached down and under the hem of her skirt. Playing with herself through her underwear, she stopped when she thought something was off. The idea coming to her that it might be the images, she clicked back on the browser and chose a different site. Finding more of the same images, she yipped again and this time concluded that maybe it was her clothes, which left her perplexed as to why she was wearing any.<br />
<br />
No answer coming, she shrugged and instead once again starting to play with herself. Beginning to breath heavily at the sight of the various vixens depicted, April abruptly Stopped when she thought something was off and instead proceeded to shuck off her shirt and, after a moment&#39;s thought her bra. Uttering a sharp bark, she again reached down, started to play with herself, but halted when her underwear began to grow not only tight, but slick and sticky. Bothered by this, she wondered what she could do, and why it upset her, she puzzled it for a minute before hastily undoing the laces on her boots, kicked them and her socks off, stood, pushed off her skirt and then rolled down her underwear, exposing her pubic hair and barest hint of her cleft mound.<br />
<br />
Almost naked, she peered down past her exposed breasts, thinking the hair covering her groin looked off somehow. Yipping, &quot;Can&#39;t be helped,&quot; she looked at the computer monitor and seeing an image of a vixen, if underside fully exposed, April let her tongue loll out at she started masturbating again. Rubbing her fingers first against her clit, which felt a titbit off, she slipped her hand between her legs and the appendages becoming slick with her feminine juice, she moaned as she slid them into her vagina. Feeling she could hold back, April moaned and with her free hand, clumsily pushed her damp and sticky off. Her panties hitting the floor, she spread her legs and still peering at the screen, she extracted her fingers from the secret spot between her legs and instead began to fiddle with her clit and urethra, which was starting to feel thicker.<br />
<br />
Unaware of what was happening, lost in the moment, April completely missed it as her clitoris hood, clit and urethra fused together into a red penis. Stroking furiously, and exactly at the moment she came, she suddenly realised what she was holding. The pressure in her abdomen, which had been slowly sinking lower and lower, suddenly giving way, the sixteen-year-old girl stared down the penis nestled in her pubic hair, which looked lighter. Her mind snapping back, she leapt up. Feeling the new genitals hanging down, knowing that it was more than a penis, but also a set of testicles, she yipped in alarm, barked out, &quot;What the...&quot; before tearing across her room, out into the hall and towards the upstairs bathroom. Slamming the door, she locked it, flipped on the light and stared in horror at the new addition to her body, terrified by what she was seeing and thinking, &quot;How shit. I&#39;m a she-male,&quot; before uttering a bark-like laughter that sounded almost like the noise a fox made.</p>
