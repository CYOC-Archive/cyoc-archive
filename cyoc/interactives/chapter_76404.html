<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen slumped limply in her chair as her principal continued sucking at her pussy.  The afterglow after all the stimulation she'd received was amazing. She felt an odd rippling spread outward from her crotch and looked down in alarm. Ms Lyon was swallowing convulsively, eyes dilated and practically rolled back in her head. Finally she pulled her tongue out of Jenny's cunt and sat back on her heels.<br />
<br />
She looked radiant, really better than Jennifer could ever remember her ever looking before.  What had that perv Kyle said about her wanting to get fucked by women?  But she didn't feel attraction for Ms. Lyon, she just looked like she'd stepped from a magazine add: clear smooth skin, puffy lips, long dark hair, full breasts--Jen looked reflexively at her own breasts, feeling a bit intimidated by the woman in front of her. Jen cupped her breasts curiously. they looked...okay?  not as tanned or amazing as she thought they'd looked in the mirror this morning, but still, nice, right?  <br />
<br />
Confused and suddenly insecure about her body Jennifer huddled inside the gym teacher's jacket and poked through the box of clothes.  Someone had lost a blue lycra jogging bra. Jen glanced at the label; only a C cup, but better tight than bouncing. She found an unopened package of white cotton panties at the bottom of the box. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously? girls loose their panties often enough at this school that they have to buy extras?&quot; Jen blushed and darted a glance at Ms Lyon, but she was apparently still basking in whatever joy she'd gotten from eating Jenny out.<br />
<br />
Jen pulled on the panties, then the bra. &quot;What the heck?&quot; Jennifer stared at her chest in confusion. What should have been a tight fit on her D cups was actually a bit loose. &quot;Did they mis-label it?  or stretch it out?&quot; Jennifer shook her tits back and forth in the bra, it didn't seem damaged.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're smaller now.&quot; Jennifer jumped and turned around, holding her hands over her new underwear.  Ms. Lyon was laying on her back with her eyes closed. Jennifer felt a stab of jealousy at how large and firm her principal's breasts were revealed to be by her position.  Ms. Lyon continued speaking. &quot;and your hair's a bit coarser, complexion a bit more prone to acne and freckles, muscles less toned...&quot; She braced her hands behind her head and raised herself in a perfect arch before gracefully vaulting her her feet.  &quot;Ah! Less flexible too most likely. She opened her eyes and looked Jenny up and down.  Jennifer blushed and felt humiliated to be seen partially dressed by the woman who'd only minutes before been touching her most private parts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-what are you talking about?&quot; Jenny stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tsk&quot; Ms Lyon shook her head, &quot;your voice too?  I'm sorry Jennifer, my curse doesn't usually sap /everything/ that makes a woman attractive.&quot; She stepped around her desk and pulled a small mirror out of her purse. &quot;Finish getting dressed while I fill you in on some things you might not have heard about the town curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer gasped, &quot;How did you know I got cursed?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Principal looked at her over the mirror, &quot;Are you in the habit of starring in all-girl orgies in the locker room?  What are the youth of today up to?&quot;  She opened a drawer and began cleaning her face with a tissue she pulled out.<br />
<br />
Jennifer grabbed the sweatshirt and pulled it on, followed by a jeanskirt and some flip flops.  Her toes looked...stubby. Jennifer frowned at them.  They were neatly painted, tanned, but something about her toes was...off.  &quot;You're lying.  This bra was just mislabeled, nothing's changed about me, nothing....&quot; Jennifer tailed off looking at the stark pity on Ms Lyon's lovely face; her perfectly chiseled cheekbones, her slim delicately upturned nose... Jennifer wasn't aware she was crying until everything went blurry.<br />
<br />
Ms Claire Lyon sighed and fished out the entire box of tissues, the poor girl was going to need them.  She watched Jennifer's skin get blotchy and red as she sobbed and felt a twinge of guilt.  Coach Nilsen should have spotted the girl's curse was gender oriented and taken her to the vice-principal--who was at the Junior high today she remembered.  Ah well, no use crying over spilled milk, Jenny was doing enough crying for both of them.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt empty inside, just a hollow shell of a girl. An ugly hollow shell of a girl.  She waited for the tears to start again and was vaguely surprised when they didn't. She stood and looked at the tears and snot on the sweatshirt she was wearing with distaste.  Ms Lyon was talking quietly on her phone and motioned at a package of tissues and her compact sitting on the edge of her desk closest to Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Jenny cleaned herself up and sorted through the box until she found a boy's polo shirt that wasn't too awful a color and exchanged it for the sweatshirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just leave that by the door, we'll get it washed and back into the box&quot; Ms Lyon said.  &quot;I've contacted your parents, thankfully they're both townies and understood the situation.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer stared at her principal quizzically.  &quot;The situation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The town curse.  We've been several years without it turning up at the school.  The police will need to take a statement from you to try to trace it back--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle! Kyle Perkins did this to me!  When I get ahold of him--&quot; Jennifer clenched her fists.<br />
<br />
&quot;You! Will do, Nothing!&quot; Ms Lyon snapped. &quot;To Kyle, or to anyone else!  That'd just compound whatever other horrors have been committed.&quot;  She took a deep breath and released it, regaining her composure.  &quot;I'm glad Mr Perkins didn't think far enough ahead to prevent you from disclosing who gave you your curse, it will make it easier to follow it back to its source.  The police will take your statement, but if you could tell me as much as you remember of the wording?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was,&quot; Jennifer hesitated, &quot;it was about girls being unable to keep from touching me, and--and me wanting them to.&quot; Jenny pulled her knees up into the chair and wrapped her arms around them.  She wanted to wake up and discover today had all been a terrible nightmare.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in my forties when I moved to town,&quot; Ms Lyon began, &quot;to become principal of this school.  The school board didn't tell me about the curse at first.  After I completed my probationary period the district attorney took my wife and me to visit Danvers sanitarium outside of town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wife? but you're!&quot; Jennifer blushed, no wonder she was so good at sex with a girl!<br />
<br />
&quot;A woman?  Yes, I am now.&quot; Claire glanced down at her newly enhanced bosom before continuing. &quot;Then, I was a man.  My wife and I signed releases and were taken to meet some of the survivors who weren't able to function in general society due to the nature of their curses.  The doctors at the sanitarium do their best, but most who get physically transformed by the curse ultimately go mad.  We met some Dares as well, but they're difficult to tell from regular mental patients.  Elise couldn't accept that some of the...beings...we met had been human at one point, or that the others couldn't fight their compulsions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a particularly nasty outbreak of the curse a few years later and I received mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, if they knew who had the curse why didn't they change all those people at the sanitarium back?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jennifer, there's.. no &quot;tag-backs&quot; with the town curse. It affects each person once, then they pass it on.&quot; Claire stared at the stricken girl.  &quot;I'm sorry, I thought you knew it was permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire, once Clarence Everett Lyon, made a mental note to get more tissues out of the supply cupboard.  When Jennifer's hysterics finally settled she'd emptied the box and finished by blowing her nose on the much abused sweatshirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't attempt to tell you how lightly you got off with your curse--&quot; Claire broke off as her secretary buzzed the intercom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Lyon? The police are here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Shirley, male officers only?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma'am, buzz me before they come out so I can get clear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shirley!  We'll discuss that comment later.&quot; Claire scowled, but Jennifer didn't look like she'd collapse into more tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's right,&quot; Jennifer said, &quot;I'm a menace. Ought to be locked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer,&quot; Ms. Lyon paused as the door opened and three police officers entered.  The youngest, Kip, was the community liaison officer for the school.  Claire didn't recognize the slightly older Asian man with a medical bag, but leading them was a grizzled black detective she knew from emergency preparedness meetings.  &quot;Glen! how wide-spread is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Claire.  We think its a single line, maybe a dozen all-told.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have the origin?  Who was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The policeman winced. &quot;One of ours. Got jumped by some scum who'd heard about the curse and she panicked when they started--well, no need to go into that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kip was gaping at Ms. Lyon.  The other officer had come over and was checking Jennifer's pulse.  He had EMT patches on his uniform.  &quot;Have you been injured?&quot; He asked Jennifer gently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, no, not exactly.&quot;  She blinked as he shined a penlight into her eyes. &quot;I um--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gyno-centric sexual contact compulsion affecting females in close proximity to the subject, with Dare-enforced acceptance&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer stared at her principle's statement.  Ms. Lyon raised a perfectly arched eyebrow.  &quot;We've been dealing with the curse a long time Jennifer, and most people aren't very inventive, thankfully.  A complete clinical description will have to wait until your aggressor has been interrogated.  Just remember that he was on the receiving end of the curse before he gave it to you, so he was likely assaulted too.  Did he look normal when he passed you the curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, he asked me over the phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The phone?&quot; Glen said.  &quot;It's never functioned over electronic media before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've never conducted exhaustive tests on that.  At least, not that you've told me about.&quot; Claire said tartly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Imagine if it got loose on social media!&quot; Kip said, &quot;It could affect dozens, hundreds!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Mays! No speculation on that point please, you'll start a panic.&quot;  Glen stepped over to look at Jennifer.  &quot;You realize how serious this is?  You must not speak, write, or otherwise communicate the activating question.  If you do and the result harms another person you'll be charged with aggravated assault at least, murder 1 at worst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop frightening the girl, she's had enough trauma for one morning.&quot; Ms. Lyon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How'd she end up with you anyway Claire? If she affects women?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Coach Nilsen panicked.  He wasn't affected and thought it was only her classmates.  I think he was afraid she'd pass it to him.&quot; Claire slapped her desk.  &quot;Damn it, we do in-services about this scenario, how to conduct a spot assessment, keeping earplugs handy.&quot;  She sighed. &quot;At least it's contained.  We got the other girls rounded up and will give them The Speech after the counselor is through with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going to happen to me?&quot; Jennifer asked. &quot;Don't I get to talk to a councilor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Detective Glen began, &quot;first you'll come down to the police station with us, we'll take a statement and your father will come sign some forms, then you'll stay in a controlled area where you'll talk to some therapists who'll help you come to terms with what's happened to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll never get used to this.&quot; Jennifer stared at Detective Glen. &quot;You're talking about Danvers, you're going to lock me up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only until you're better.&quot; Glen nodded at the EMT who applied a pressure hypodermic to Jennifer's neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! What the...I'll sue yer ballsov&quot; Jennifer slumped unconscious in her chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get her secured, call her father in, have all the permissions signed before she wakes up.&quot; Glen turned and looked at Claire. &quot;Got a nice glow about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can it Glen, I was compelled.  Do you think I want what I took from her? Anyway, she named her aggressor; Kyle Perkins, a freshman who was called in sick this morning.&quot;  Detective Glen was already talking into his radio relaying information and instructions.  Claire watched as another EMT brought in a backboard and Jennifer was carried out the nearest emergency exit.  Glen left with them leaving only the young police liaison officer Kip Mays in her office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Ms. Lyon?  I wonder if you might be interested--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop.  Kip, I am old enough to be your fa-your parent, and however I might look to you right now, in a few days or weeks I'll look my proper self again and you'll have lost whatever infatuation you're feeling at the moment.  Also, I'm in a committed relationship.  I'm sorry.&quot; Claire settled behind her desk and pulled up a file on her computer, ignoring the crestfallen young man.  &quot;You can return to your duties, officer Mays.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire breathed a sigh of relief as the door closed. &quot;Shirley? No calls, no visitors.&quot;  <br />
<br />
She crossed to the door to her office and quietly locked it.  She started back to her desk and paused, looking down at her breasts and giving them an incredulous squeeze.  She unbuttoned her blouse and fished behind her back unhooking her bra. She continued undressing until she stood stark naked in the middle of her office.  Her breasts were easily DDs and barely sagged, her small dark pink nipples looked entirely lickable even to her.  She closed her eyes and ran her hands down her body, tracing flaring hips, rounded ass, stubbly fuzz of trimmed pubic hair, the sensitive swell of her mons.  It was finally gone.  Her fingers passed again over the nub of her clitorus, now finally a fully female organ and not the shriveled useless remnant of her penis.<br />
<br />
Was that why her curse had drained so much of Jennifer's beauty?  That she'd finally become completely female?  Or maybe just because it'd been so long.  Elise had left him just a few weeks after he was cursed.  The women he'd coupled with during the chaos of that curse outbreak had been enough that he'd looked androgynous by the time it was contained.  During his stay at Danvers he'd been comforted by women who didn't mind loosing their feminine beauty. By the time she was able to return to the school she looked and knew enough to pass for female-born to most people who hadn't known her before.<br />
<br />
She'd lied to Kip about having a relationship, better to shut that door firmly.  She'd had a few short affairs since resuming her position, usually preop transsexuals looking to reduce the invasiveness of their surgery. Claire tried to remember, she calculated it was close to five years since she'd made love to a woman.  Perhaps she'd have to try men again-- she blinked and realized she'd started fingering herself without thinking about it. Claire peered down between breasts and watched her wrist flex as she pumped her fingers into her pussy. She noted her free hand was fondling her breasts as she raised one and stuffed her nipple into her mouth. <br />
<br />
Claire sank to her knees, than laid down on her back, her soft grunts, sucking, and moans accompanied by the soft squelching noises as she worked her entire fist up her cunt. Her orgasm was the most incredible feeling she'd ever had. As her afterglow carried her near to unconsciousness she remembered the curse she'd been given; 'each time you fuck a woman you'll steal her fucking beauty until you become a real fucking woman yourself!'  Funny it'd taken so long to catch up with her, and be so literal after all this time.  As Claire switched hands and resumed diddling herself she guessed they'd have to hire themselves a new principal.</p>
