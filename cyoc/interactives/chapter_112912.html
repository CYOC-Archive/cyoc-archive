<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just then, the door pushed itself open. Alex scrambled back, clinging to the sink in the hopes that this new guest wouldn&#39;t mistake him for a toilet again, and cursed silently when he realized it was none other than Chad, the quarterback who&#39;d been fucking Jack. Whistling to himself, Chad walked in and didn&#39;t see Alex at first, instead making his way over to one of the stalls before freezing in his tracks. &quot;What the...&quot; Chad gasped, turning back to stare right at Alex. He rubbed his eyes and peered at Alex again before a look of pity crossed his face. &quot;You&#39;re the guy who was watching me and Jack, weren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s heart began to race, although there was some relief in being recognized. &quot;Yeah, t-that was me,&quot; he sighed, looking down at the tiled floor. &quot;I-I&#39;m Alex. I&#39;m glad you recognized me... the last guy didn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
A look of horror crossed Chad&#39;s face. &quot;That&#39;s why you... oh shit kid, this is bad,&quot; he grimaced. &quot;Look, why don&#39;t you come with me back to my dorm room? I can explain a few things if you&#39;d like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have much of a choice at this point,&quot; Alex  said, his whole body still trembling. Letting Chad take the lead, he kept close to the quarterback, still hoping no one would say anything about his bizarre appearance or, worse, mistake him again. His thoughts were still jumbled, and every time he got too good of a glimpse of Chad&#39;s ass, the want to service Chad came rushing back, but Alex was just barely able to keep it in check. After entering another building and a few flights of stairs, the pair arrived at Chad&#39;s bedroom. <br />
<br />
Sitting down on the bed, Chad sighed and motioned for Alex to sit. Alex couldn&#39;t help but feel the odd sensation of having a much bigger ass padding his seat, and his eyesight was lower than normal, but he quickly refocused as Chad began to speak. &quot;Jack has... been punishing people who find out about the two of us for a while now. To be honest, I&#39;m too scared of what he could to do leave him at this point. He... has these powers that I just don&#39;t understand,&quot; he explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look. If you hadn&#39;t acted on whatever urges he&#39;d cursed you with, you&#39;d be fine. But you have, and you&#39;ve started a chain reaction that probably can&#39;t be stopped. Everyone right now probably only perceives you as a toilet - hell, it&#39;s hard for me to differentiate, and I have a bit of an immunity to that since Jack likes me seeing the process affect his victims. If you&#39;re going to resist it, you need to get the hell out of her now, get far away from other people, and live like a hermit. That&#39;s the only way at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad continued to speak, but instead of reality sinking in for Alex, his new urges were pushing their way to the front again. His rational mind was screaming at him to listen, but all he could think about was letting Chad piss in his mouth, be a good toilet and  service more men. Their cocks, their asses, and anything that came out of either - it was all Alex could think about, and without even realizing it he was getting up and walking over to Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex? Alex, listen to me,&quot; Chad shouted, trying to push the toilet boy away as Alex kneeled down in front of him, trying to undo his belt buckle. Chad grabbed Alex by the arm and pulled him to the door, not realizing in the confusion that he&#39;d let the pair of them to the ensuite washroom instead of the exit.<br />
<br />
As the door opened, Chad cursed his confusion and was about to yank Alex towards the correct door when an overpowering force washed over his mind. He looked back and couldn&#39;t see Alex any more... why was he clutching a toilet? This thing was fucking heavy too...<br />
<br />
Alex let Chad half carry/half drag him further into the washroom, hungry to help Chad relieve himself. As Chad set him down on the floor, he shimmied out of his jeans and whipped off his top, his ass and legs pressing themselves to the ground. As he did this, a pipe began to work its way out of the floor, and Alex greedily held his asscheeks open so that the pipe could connect to his ass. As soon as it made contact, Alex felt a rush of ecstacy - it felt right in so many ways, just situated there like it should be. He felt his legs merging again with the floor and opened his mouth wide, waiting for Chad to use him.<br />
<br />
Chad was already forgetting the conversation he had been having. He&#39;d come back to his dormroom to piss, hadn&#39;t he? He&#39;d been holding it in all day. Unbuckling his belt, he freed his throbbing cock and began to piss into Alex&#39;s mouth, which had grown more and more wide. Alex&#39;s neck had thickened substantially to accomodate this, and his lower jaw was now stretching out much further than should be normal to create a more rounded rim. His body had become more squat, his arm merging again with his torso and legs, and all the while the beginnings of a lever flusher was beginning to grow out of Alex&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Alex was loving every moment of catching the liquid in his mouth, and it was only as the piss stream subsided that his rational mind was able to seize control again. He should be terrified! He was unable to swallow the piss at the moment, his throat seemingly blocked as the yellow liquid sat in his mouth, and he&#39;d frozen in place again. Alex stared out at Chad, begging for him to realize what was happening, to snap him out of it, but instead Chad sighed and pushed the lever that had formed on his head. As soon as he pushed it down, Alex was launched into an orgasm the likes of which he&#39;d never experienced before. All his horror and realization was flushed away as the piss went down his throat, wanting to moan all the while as it filtered through his body and then out of his dick, which seemed to also be connected by pipe now to the ground.<br />
<br />
Chad zipped up his pants and walked out of the bathroom, shutting the door. Alex must have been there for hours, his orgasm subsiding after a few minutes, leaving him to wrestle with these thoughts. The want to service other men had only grown each time he&#39;d followed through, the rationality slipping further away, and now Alex was still struggling to even retake his mind and focus on what Chad had said before. He had to get far away, or he&#39;d be stuck as a toilet for the rest of his days.<br />
<br />
Finally, Alex felt some mobility beginning to return to his body. He felt the pipes recede from his ass and dick, his legs unmerge from the floor and his arms free themselves from his torso. Heaving, he fell forward but caught himself before his enlarged head hit the floor. Shaking, he struggled to stand, his limbs thickened yet weak, as he realized he was now maybe four feet tall. His face hadn&#39;t changed back much - in fact, Alex&#39;s mouth was now stuck jutting out, the jaw sticking out at a 90 degree angle and extended quite far out in front of him. His upper lip had now pulled itself up, almost like a lid, and when he finally managed to shut his mouth, it slammed down on his jaw like one. Peering out, he could see the base of his face was much more rectangular, and from Alex&#39;s temple a lever had pushed itself out. His ass, too, had grown enormous, resembling more of a base for a toilet to sit on than anything.<br />
<br />
Looking back down at his pile of clothing, Alex knew there was no way any of it would still fit and no point anymore. People could only see him as a toilet now, and he needed to stay away from them all anyways. Everytime he was around someone, the thoughts seemed to be able to overpower him, so it&#39;d also be crucial to avoid people if he was going to get away. Creeping up to the door, he quietly pulled it open. Peering out, Alex could see that no one was still in the room - a lucky break. The clock was flashing 3 AM, so hopefully his luck would hold and people would be asleep instead of roaming around campus. Alex quickly dashed across the room, throwing the door to the hallway open and running down the corridor. Alex prayed for a lucky break...</p>
