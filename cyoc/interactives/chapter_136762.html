<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ann sighed as she looked at her family. &quot;What choice do I have,&quot; she sighed. &quot;If I don&#39;t do this now my niece here could turn me into a kindergartener while Im in a business meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So your going through with this,&quot; Lisa asked, raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she groaned. &quot;I mean I&#39;m kind of up the creek without a paddle here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann paused as she now looked at her family, a look of concern crossing her face. &quot;She&#39;s not going to leave us all kids is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty sure its just for the afternoon,&quot; Katie smiled. &quot;I think she just wants you to have some fun and make some friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann felt slightly relieved at this revelation. She could deal with becoming a child for a few hours if she could return to normal afterwards. Bending down she now glared at Lisa&#39;s stomach. &quot;Okay you I&#39;ll do it,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;But I am so taking embarassing baby photos of you and showing them to your dates when your older.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa, Katie and Gloria now laughed as Ann sighed in annoyance. &quot;So do you want us to stick around Aunt Ann,&quot; Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No that&#39;s ok,&quot; Ann said shaking her head. &quot;If Im going to be reliving my childhood for the afternoon I&#39;d rather be by myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann&#39;s family nodded before giving her a hug. &quot;Call me later okay,&quot; Lisa asked. Ann smiled, assuring them she would call when she got home. As Ann watched her family now vanish she decided to sit in her office chair.<br />
<br />
Ann sighed in typical teenage fashion. Unfortunately for her she was growing younger more slowly than the others.  An occasional glimpse in her compact as well as an examination of her clothing told her she was still getting younger. Ann watched as the cuffs of her jacket slowly crept over her wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh I look like im 16 now,&quot; she thought. As she listened to the childrens laughter outside she felt the slightest pang of jealousy. &quot;They do sound like their having fun. I guess there are worse things in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann now slowly made her way to her office door. Stumbling in her oversized heels, the 15 year old discarded them. Looking down Ann was surprised how large her nylons looked on her skinny legs and small feet. As she opened the door she gawked at the scene before her.<br />
<br />
Everyone seemed to have finished regressing. Instead of an office full of hard working adults, Ann saw a room full if children. The children present were as young as 5 and with the oldest ones being 12. Ann could see a handsome brown haired boy who seemed to be in charge. Ann gasped as she recognized this boy as McIntyre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann,&quot; he called, his voice cracking. &quot;Are you feeling better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann grinned as she approached the boy. &quot;Yes sir,&quot; she smiled. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
The 12 year old blushed slightly as he gazed at the 14 year old Ann. Although Ann was now the oldest in the room, her gut told her that wouldn&#39;t be for much longer. &quot;Much better now sir,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Everything okay out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
McIntyre blushed, nodding at the cute teen. &quot;Y..yeah,&quot; he stammered, his voice cracking. &quot;Everyone kinda broke off into groups. Which reminds me I saw your assistant and Stephanie together. They seemed to be getting along rather well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann searched the room, quickly finding Megan and Stephanie. The two women were now happy 6 year old girls. The brunette and raven haired girl appeared to be coloring now, useing notebook paper and colored pencils. Ann winced as she realized that she was going to end up being their age as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow its really great their getting along, &quot; Ann smiled as she felt herself become 13.  McIntyre smiled and nodded, tuening he looked up at the teen girl. Ann could see the boy was crushing on her but realized that would be changing shortly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I should enjoy this for a moment,&quot; she thought. &quot;In another few minutes McIntyre is going to see me as just another little kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann shrugged, she was going to enjoy being a big kid for the moment. As she shrank down to 12 she took McIntyres hand, noticing the cuffs of their jackets now half covered their hands. Turning she gave the boy a shy smile.  McIntyre blushed wildly as Ann giggled. Slowly she watched a McIntyre as her perspective began to change.<br />
<br />
Ann originally had to look down to look into his eyes. As time wore on she eventually found their eyes level before finding herself having to look up. As she looked up at the boy Ann felt her skirt finally slide off her boyish hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you should go and talk with those two,&quot; McIntyre stated to Ann.<br />
<br />
Ann glanced over her body, realizing she was now only 10 years old. &quot;Your the boss,&quot; she giggled as now found herself skipping.<br />
<br />
Ann smiled as she looked herself over. The blouse and jacket she wore now hung like a sack, resting a little bit above her knees. Shaking her arms she could see that her hands were now almost completely engulfed in her sleeves. As she looked at her feetshe noticed the nylons flapping behind her. As she approached the two 6 year olds she smiled and waved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; she chirped as she became 9.<br />
<br />
Megan happily returned her wave while Stephanie frowned up at her. &quot;Hi,&quot; Stephanie grumbled. &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was wondering what you you were doing,&quot; she said. &quot;And was hoping I could join you. &quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie gave the 8 year old girl a curious look. &quot;Why do you want to play with us,&quot; she asked. &quot;Your a big girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im not that big,&quot; Ann giggled.<br />
<br />
Stephanie tilted her head,  gazing at Ann. &quot;Your socks look weird,&quot; she answered. Ann laughed as she gazed at the oversized nylons she was still wearing. &quot;Yeah they are kinda weird.&quot; Quickly Ann shook them off, balling them up and throwing them across the room. &quot;Better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Stephanie chirped. &quot;We were coloring. Do you want to color with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann nodded happily as she now sat with the two 6 year old girls. As Ann now slowly grew back to 6 she talked with them,  finding that she really did have alot in common with Megan and Stephanie. <br />
<br />
Aftrr coloring Ann and her new friends played hide and seek, before deciding to buld a fort underneath one of the desks. The girls laughed and joked with eachother quickly becoming friends. Ann was overjoyed with the fact she was making friends (even if these friends were her now 6 year old coworkers). &quot;This has been so much fun,&quot; she thought happily. As she looked at the clock she could see it change from 4:59 to 5:00. As the clock changed a brilliant flash of light blinded her eyes.<br />
<br />
Ann blinked in confusion. She was sitting at her desk once more. Looking over herself she could see she was an adult once more. Sighing she leaned back in her chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to bothrr you Ms. O&#39;Toole.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann looked up to see Megan enter her office. Anns former playmate had also returned to adulthood. &quot;Thats okay Megan,&quot; she smiled.<br />
<br />
Megan entered the office quietly, setting her reports down. &quot;Have a good weekend Ms,&quot; she said quietly as she now tried to exit the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan wait,&quot; Ann said quickly. Megan paused as she looked curiously at her boss. &quot;Megan I was wondering if you had any plans tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Ms. O&#39;Toole,&quot; she said quietly.<br />
<br />
Ann smiled as she now approached her secretary. &quot;Well your feel like maybe getting a drink or just hanging out for a bit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan paused as she curiously gazed at her boss, slowly a smile now spread over her face. &quot;Yeah that sounds like alot of fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann smiled as she grabbed her jacket. As the two stood waiting for the elevator they could see Stephanie approach. The raven haired career woman narrowed her eyes as she looked at Ann. Ann now took a deep breath as she prepared to chat with her rival.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Steph,&quot; she started. &quot;You brought up alot of good points in the meeting today. It made me want to recheck my proposal. I appreciate that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie gave Ann a curious look, unsure of Ann&#39;s intentions. &quot;Um sure,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;Someone has to make sure things are done right around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann smirked, when she was a young executive she had the same mindset. &quot;Yeah kmow how you feel,&quot; she said. &quot;So any plans this weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie sighed sadly as she watched the elevator door. &quot;No not really,&quot; she muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if your interested was heading out to dinner and possibly drinks. You interested?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie gawked at Ann, she had not expected this. The woman was her chief rival in the company and someone she not only admired but wanted to best. Did she really want to go to dinner with this woman?<br />
<br />
Stephanie sighed as she looked at Ann and Megan. &quot;Sure why not,&quot; she groaned. &quot;Probably be able to give you some pointers on how to increase revenue for next quarter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann chuckled as the three women now entered the elevator. Ann realized the three of them may not be ready to give eachother makeovers but it was the begining of a friendship.</p>
