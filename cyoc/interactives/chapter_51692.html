<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And with that, in one blink of an eye, the shadow of Gaal the witch, one of the three <br />
witches with their love of discord and chaos and anarchy was, after three hundred and ten <br />
years, washed away forever from the town of Glendale that night. <br />
<br />
Amy's power had across the curse's 'circuit board' destroyed the connections between the <br />
various turns in the Wolf Pack... reducing the curse among them back into a mindless <br />
curse with no true will of it's own, and no one had any intention of giving it time to <br />
reconnect and become fully aware again. <br />
<br />
The pack members wandered about in a daze, the absolute shock of Truth and Clarity <br />
being placed upon their shoulders caused them all at the manor to cease what they were <br />
doing, some dropping valuable antiques onto the floor. <br />
<br />
Martha herself, hated it. The assurance in her mind she was beautiful, the pure and <br />
absolute sense of duty and purpose were all gone, it left a horrid emptiness inside her as <br />
she fell to her knees and hugged herself, closing all six of her eyes, all six misting up in <br />
tears. The curse mindlessly suckled on this like a newborn on a mother's breasts. <br />
<br />
Mr. P... didn't feel all that different. He felt didn't know if he should feel disgusted at <br />
eating a stray cat or not... he knew he had been driven by slavish devotion to his great-<br />
grandchild... And he had lost his business ... But right now Martha needed some emotional <br />
help, and there was no one else to give to her as he rubbed again her, whispering in her <br />
ear that he found her beautiful. <br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny were on their hands and knees taking the shock much worse than others, <br />
they were children after all. They had betrayed their loyal employees by creating the empty <br />
shadows. Something Bart as an adult had consider intolerable. Jenny curled up shaking as <br />
she beheld the truth of the miniature kingdom she was to inherit. <br />
<br />
Marcy and Kevin hugged each other, wishing someone, anyone would hug the both of <br />
them. They didn't WANT to think about everything they had lost from their rebirth into the <br />
pack, they didn't WANT to think of their life accomplishment simply washed away. Their <br />
single greatest desire, was for mommy Kaylee to come, hug them, and tell them that <br />
everything was alright and was going to be alright. <br />
<br />
Zelipe, was confused more than anything, horrendously confused. It was better for those <br />
who had been statues not to be statue right? Then how could it have been wrong? It <br />
wasn't right for his life as Zelda to be cut short like that, but... and his sister... Zelipe's <br />
head hurt. <br />
<br />
The six shadows bumped and smacked into each other as their tried to act as Jenny and <br />
Bart would... but now possessing not so much egos as echos of Jennifer Smith The First <br />
and Bartholomew tied to the unquestioned will of Bart and Jenny, the shadows found their <br />
actions deadlocked. <br />
<br />
In the storage room beside her entrance and exit mirror Alice stood about seeing her pack <br />
galloping all about in a daze as if they had come face to face with a Boojum itself and had <br />
yet somehow not been as if they had never been born. She observed this all calmly and <br />
had not so much as twitched when the short circuit had happened. 'I have always been <br />
able to behold who and what we were, and what we were doing with perfect objectivity. <br />
But who I was before had nothing, and was nothing, Alice at least is someone, is <br />
something... And so I chose I would follow you father and do as you wished.' <br />
<br />
Frumious and manxome was what Alice felt somewhere mome, far from the mimsy broken <br />
and gone shadow of Gaal. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Gaal, whose name meant abomination. Gaal who had been dead for over three hundred <br />
and ten years. Gaal, one of three witches who had sought to 'liberate' Glendale from the <br />
'shackles' of things such as 'sanity' 'logic' and 'reason.' One of three witches, who had <br />
wished to see the town born again into a place of pure and absolute chaos. And had been <br />
executed along with the rest of her coven who were her sisters, one by blood the other by <br />
coven: Golgatha. Gomorrah.<br />
<br />
The turns among the pack in Glendale had been reduced to a utterly mindless tool of evil <br />
with no will or intent of it's own. Within the pack, the curse had been left broken, <br />
damaged, left with all the intellect of a mundane ape. Neither a threat on the scale Gaal's <br />
shadow had become by any stretch of the imagination and ripe for the annihilation by <br />
father Mike's cure. <br />
<br />
Half-way across the world, among the gem wolves on Big Bad Island, the settlers were <br />
rather confounded by what they were seeing. <br />
<br />
Samantha also stared at the sky, having been on the island during the shock-wave that <br />
had completely undone, or had effectively undone the development the curse had <br />
undergone from the pack and pride's rapid use. <br />
<br />
Ruby not taking her gaze away from the sky anymore than anyone else on Big Bad Island <br />
said, &quot;So... does anyone else hear the savage and near animalistic snarls of violet hot rage <br />
at the pack of their minds and see the swirling black storm could that is present JUST <br />
above our island though the rest of the surrounding sea couldn't be sunnier and calmer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone else I do believe.&quot; Emerald said also not taking he eyes off it, in particular when <br />
it began to shoot purple lightning across the underside the clouds. <br />
<br />
The curse that remained on Big Bad Island, it was nothing less than having your legs <br />
chopped off in feeling. <br />
<br />
And somewhere hundred of thousands of miles away in Glendale, Judas shivered. 'Only one <br />
destroyed.' The thought crossed the catholic cat's mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whao... it's so pretty looking...&quot; Amethyst said.<br />
<br />
That was when the clouds underside looked like the skull of a wolf and a cat squashed <br />
together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear.&quot; Cobalt said not able to take her eyes off it, &quot;I have a very bad feeling about this.... <br />
dear?&quot; Cobalt asked when Opal didn't respond but couldn't take her eyes off it. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's so amazing... and so...frightening...&quot; Lawrence said his dislocated arm completely <br />
forgotten... &quot;And... I... feel... like... all that matters. I am Quartz. All the world turn to <br />
chaos, all who deny the chaos twist back in misery.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lawrence's fur took on a polished shine, his eyes becoming a solid white gradient, his hair <br />
going baled to filling out like the rest, and the flower symbol appear on his shoulder. <br />
<br />
All across the island, the gem colored wolves, now with Lawrence, stood staring up at the <br />
storm, their mouthes closed and their arms at their sides and their feet together.<br />
<br />
Samantha's glass body took on a more crystaline shine, and her eyes lost any engraving of <br />
pupils, she stood at attention staring upwards with the rest. <br />
<br />
The deer having been brought to the island blinked, and their eyes all turned into gold <br />
gradients weather they had once been human or not. They formed rank and file, never <br />
stopping looking at the storm clouds. Their horns turned sharper, their hooves longer, <br />
their coats more rough. <br />
<br />
Samantha entered the mirror verse, her fur now having a metallic gold shine, and her eyes <br />
a gradient blue, on her backside the flower birth mark. Her dress was now black and red <br />
with gold runes stitched into the sleeves and helm, ready to block he way of any who came <br />
close to the island. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am Glass. Forever it must continue, Never should it stop. Never it must stop. All the <br />
world turn to chaos and all who do not embrace the chaos turn back upon themselves in <br />
misery.&quot; Samantha spoke in mantra. <br />
<br />
The gem wolves Lawrence included began to draw mile long runs into the island's sand as <br />
the deer formed a perimeter around the island... except for one pregnant doe. <br />
<br />
Tourmaline and Carol stood calmly as they cut themselves and began to decorate <br />
Amethyst in runes drawn in their own blood. <br />
<br />
Amethyst walked to the center of a circle, with two other circles nearby forming a triangle. <br />
<br />
The pregnant doe (it was not Marcine, even enslaved by the now degenerating curse she <br />
stood by Jack's side) stood perfectly at attention in one circle, while Cobalt and Opal stood <br />
beside each other in another. <br />
<br />
Amethyst cut her palm and smeared it in the center of the triangle, then she slaughtered <br />
the pregnant doe and put the unborn Fawn in the center, while Opal and Cobalt fell upon <br />
each other and humped each other anomalistically letting out grunts and howls. <br />
<br />
&quot;All the world turn to chaos, all those who not embrace the chaos twist upon themselves <br />
in misery.&quot; Amethyst spoke calmly and impassively.  <br />
<br />
 Golgatha. A woman who in life wore an emerald dress and hood identical to Gaal's with <br />
long long black hair that reached her ankles, a black cat at her side, half her face <br />
deformed since birth that resembled a death's head. <br />
<br />
Gomorrah. The youngest of the witch, with no familiar to call her own. Wearing a brown <br />
hooded cape, and ruffled black dress with pearl jewelry her blond hair done in many <br />
different and seemingly random braids like a mad child. <br />
<br />
That was could be identified as having once been them knew, or perhaps, knew within <br />
what had once been their souls that their time was now coming to a close... but like Japan <br />
and Germany before them (or was that after?) they were determined to bring as much <br />
chaos and misery to those who rejected chaos before defeat was handed to them. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe she fell asleep like that.&quot; June commented to her daughter, yes, her <br />
daughter. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Amy-chan.&quot; Amy looked to see another white wolf cub with red markings. Unlike <br />
herself who was naked and free, this Amy had long white hair with similar brush stroke <br />
like red marks, and a kimono following the same color pattern, on her back a bow and <br />
quiver. The design style Amy thought looked to predate even the age of Emperor Jimmu. <br />
&quot;It pleases me to able to speak to you directly this time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Amy asked though she was bow before she knew it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm the one whose been with you from the beginning, I was with Ami when she fought <br />
hard to bring reason back to the minds of... of the descendants of the sun. And I have <br />
been along side you ever since the curse remade you into the part of the wolf pack, <br />
Randy, Amy, we have walked along side each other... we have one last task to walk along <br />
side each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What task -sama?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The shadows of the evil of the two remaining witches survives in the curse that resides <br />
within the wolves who were on Big Bad Island ... the shock had jarred the curse, turning it <br />
more chaotic than before... even now it is twisting those there into it's defenders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sadly yes Ami. But ... this is also it's last stand... it has nowhere left to run, nowhere left to <br />
hide... and those touched by my power through you it can not twist though sheer will as it <br />
is doing to those upon the island... The pride and the pack. It's damaged state has also <br />
left it more vulnerable to the cure provided. This shall be our last battle together Amy. But <br />
we need not fight it alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded, &quot;I understand.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's walk together this last time Amy,&quot; The other Amy hugged her, &quot;And let's end this <br />
curse once and for -all!-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Amy awoke so suddenly and so quickly that it startled her parents. &quot;Jensen-Sama! The <br />
island! The curse on the island! It's still alive! It used Miss Caroline as a test subject, and <br />
now it twists deer, and wolf alike to it's guardians... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Jensen said nothing believing this, the entire party still within the office as Amy <br />
had had her sudden cat nap. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is time for the final battle Jensan-sama. The sooner we strike, the less Damage it shall <br />
do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AMY! How do you know these things!&quot; June took hold of her child. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mother... I promise I shall tell you...but the longer we delay the more dangerous things <br />
are becoming... Please... if you really are my mother... trust me... &quot;<br />
<br />
That struck like thunder inside June, and she drooped her head, she realized she'd have <br />
preferred to keep the brainwashed that made it impossible for her to feel anything <br />
negative towards Zackery, it would have likely made Amy's childhood an easier one. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Of all the things to expect, Alice coming out of a mirror holding a white flag with a <br />
gigantic black as night male wolf and a brownish red wolf right behind him hadn't been <br />
among them.<br />
<br />
The gallery lions looked up from the history books that had been in Gill's personal library <br />
(some of them had some catching up to do). <br />
<br />
&quot;We surrender.&quot; Jensen said simply, &quot;And we'd like to ask the Glendale's Pride Devision <br />
help...&quot; <br />
<br />
It was midnight in Glendale, and the clock struck... <br />
<br />
Everyone, Gill, the Pride, Paul, Serenity, Trevor, Abbey, all realized they wouldn't be <br />
getting any sleep tonight. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The broken shattered remains of the curse world, <br />
<br />
&quot;Golgatha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Gomorrah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let them come. This'll be the last battle of the coven chaos... and we shall leave victory so <br />
bitter that they shall have wished for defeat...&quot;</p>
