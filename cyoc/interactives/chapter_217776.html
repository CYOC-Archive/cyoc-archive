<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">as the party went on that Nobody found out who was who beneath each costumes for the time of the party. Even when Kat asked around to see if anyone had identified someone that nobody had any right suggestions, at lest so far. Kat was satisfied with this for When it was finally time for her friends to go home around two in the morning that Kat remained with her guest and Oliver, who didn&#39;t go home.<br />
<br />
the costumes had merged to their wearers by now as this made them unable to take anything off anymore. When Oliver was the last remaining human next to her that Kat used the same spell as before, only made it act faster though. It only took a minute for his rat costume with his baggy pants to take over his body while covering all open parts and reforming them, if not seconds. Oliver&#39;s panic suddenly stopped on the outside As Kat knew that he was by now ready to be renamed like the others for she thought this through carefully and renamed him as Asmos. Oliver continue to panic on the inside for he even pleaded to be let freed while telling her that he&#39;d change his ways as he&#39;ll be a good boy from now on, to which Oliver&#39;s pleas were by now unheard from anyone ever again.<br />
<br />
soon after that one after another, Kat let the feral looking animals around her vanish first as Each one was transported to their own destinated areas. whither it was at the pet shop in the neighborhood, the farm on the outskirts of the city, in the woods of a nearby forest, or to the zoo that All would act like this was completely normal to them. The only thing Kat made sure off was for none of them would be to get killed by humans, nor by other animals of both feral and anthros alike as they each also remember who they once were and how they got there that they won&#39;t be able to tell any humans who they are and what happened to them at all. to this, this was part of the transformation that they each had went through.<br />
<br />
Slowly after, Kat let the anthros around her go to as they each were also transported to their new destinated zone areas. some were sent to an anthro con strait away while most live in the woods as they hide from human eyes and come out willingly at anthro cons later, some went back at their own houses to only live out a new life for some even went off to live in one&#39;s new home by living as pets or servants, off to a remote pate of the forest to start off living as a tribe from humans, even in some area of the swamps to this day. like the feral&#39;s spell that they act basically like they always have, except with some animal feature like behavior as some would bark and chase their tail like a dog, fly like a bird, take a swim in a lake like a aquatic creature. Kat also made sure that none of them were notice by humans up close to see them actually be real as they&#39;ll see them as furries in costumes while also adding the part of not being able to get killed by humans, let alone animals of both feral and anthro alike. most of these so called furries are aloud to wear clothes as they so desire that a rear amount of them will thing of such things are not needed and walk around without them for in other words, naked. each one of them do remember who they were and on how they got there as they are unable to tell anyone who they really are while being recalled by their new names that they also can&#39;t tell anyone on where they&#39;re from and who. either way, this was part of the spell.<br />
<br />
once they were done that Kat went off to the pool area, to where the mermaids were at. similar to the other spells that this spell was different as she sent them to live in the ocean with the dolphins and fish of the sea. the only thing Kat made sure about them were that they stay away from humans as they fear of being caught by humans to be sold as a attraction of a freak show, dissected to be examined and studied by scientist, even kept in a tank to be enslaved while being either a pet, a slave, to being just a married wife that can&#39;t return to the sea. they each remember who they are and how they got there that the only time they can be seen by humans is if they want to mate and bread with their chosen male partners. unaware to Kat though is that some of these mermaids were actually male who were turned into females by this spell.<br />
<br />
after the mermaids were done that Kat went this over with the Dragons who now live up in the mountains, Dinosaurs as their spell traveled them back in time, Mummies who help guard the pharaoh&#39;s tome now, robots who were more toy like to be sold at a toy store, why even those who were dangerous enough be gargoyles were able to be turned to stone statutes in the same pose by each day. though they do remember who they each were while knowing at how they got there that they were not to be seen by naked human eyes, unless you count the eyes of children for they have the belief of myth and magic. to this, their spell were as followed.<br />
<br />
Dragons - remain hidden from humans while living in the mountain&#39;s mouth of its caves. fly as you like for you are to fly above clouds. you do have a thing called gold fever, which makes you greedy for your gold that you do anything to keep trespassers out of your cave as this even includes burning them with your fire breath. should a human finds you that it is your mess to clean up for you could eat them, keep them as slaves to watch your gold, or even keep them as your mate for life. the female dragons that are called dragoness will lay eggs one day as their motherly insistence suddenly kicks in the raise their new off springs of the future, but not human girls as they&#39;ll have to birth them that theirs are half breeds with dragon features like wings, horns, scales, and a tail.<br />
<br />
Dinosaurs - as much that you are able to talk with no humans around to help you, you&#39;ll also be sent back in time to the actual time of the true dinosaurs era. you won&#39;t be killed by the asteroid that killed them over millions of years ago as your insistence will tell you to hide in an underground remote secret area. it will have fresh green vegetation for the herbivores that even the carnivores learn to live and coexist with them to have their off springs. while living in this area as it will later be called the forgotten lands that no humans over the years will find you there, yet you are unable to leave this place for this shall be your safe heaven from the outside world.<br />
<br />
Mummies - though you will act like the living dead that you are, your job is to keep trespassers out of the pyramid of the pharaohs tome. some will try to steal the treasures that dwell within the treasure room, we call these grave robbers. your job is to either scare the crap out of them to never come back, or turn them into mummies themselves as they&#39;ll be send out to museums that the other option is to be added to the pyramids tomes forever. some of you will have masks based off of a Egyptian gods like Anubis, Bastet, Khnum, Sobek, Apis, Sekhmet, why even Horus and Ra themselves to wear for you can&#39;t take them off once they&#39;re placed on.<br />
<br />
Robots - you won&#39;t have to worry about eating as you&#39;ll be inanimated toys that&#39;ll be sold at a toy store. you&#39;ll act like this is normal for you as you&#39;ll not be able to rust, nor be destroyed through out the years for this also includes being disassembled. the feeling of being played out by kids fills you with joy, rather you like it or not as some of you will be human size for adult uses that a few have a thing to dress you up in maid outfits. sort of like that one show character from the rocky lV film, even if it&#39;s not in a maid dress (the anniversary film won&#39;t have it in the show though as it was in the tv show family guy at one time).<br />
<br />
Gargoyles - the only time you&#39;ll be able to move is when the sun is down for the night sky, to shed your stone encased cocoons as it wears off will you&#39;ll become all scaly and dragon like. before sun up however, you return to your fearsomeest pose as you&#39;ll be turned to stone when the sun begins to raise for a new day that comes with it. fight this will of this power all you want for if you decide not to for when the sun begins to rise shell the body begin its audio body takeover drive and send you back to be set to stone, if you&#39;re unwillingly that is. similar to the dragoness spell that the female gargoyles will lay their eggs to for these eggs will stay hidden until they hatch to be with their mother for only when they are old enough will they leave her. you&#39;ll not be harmed while you sleep in your stone state for nothing can destroy you, not even a wrecking ball machine as you can&#39;t also be damaged by anything. while in your flesh and scaly dragon like form at night that no one is aloud to see you for if they do, they only see you who&#39;s wearing a costume that they&#39;ll think nothing of it for when they see you change to stone and back. you&#39;ll act like you were actually normal gargoyles that you are as you don&#39;t even age, to keep up with the appearance to those who think of you like guardian beast who watches and guards their homes.<br />
<br />
after they were done that When it was only the buck deer in a butler outfit Louie as he was being called Lopers (Dan), the lizardmen Zaryusu (Aaron), the wolf Lesh (Miriam), the doe deer in a maid outfit Miranda (Julia), the rat in baggy pants Asmos (Oliver), and a couple of goat butlers with a few skunk maids remained behind. Kat was satisfied with the number of pets she would keep out them, But neither a wolf nor a lizardmen were normal pets as they were also not compatible that with a grin is when she cast at them again. Soon stood instead of a lizardmen and a wolf that the lizardmen from being just one were now six lizardmen as one was female, Aaron felt like he had a splitting headache with himself for he was now seeing himself from each of their different point of views for he even felt embarrassed to look at himself while being in a white female&#39;s lizardmen body while being stared at by the males. he somehow knew on what they were thinking of as he was thinking of it to, to be mated with while being inpregneted by a strong and hansom lizardmen that Kat placed them in a large house like terrarium of the marshlands together for at the time being. to this as Kat had also named her new pets that there was now Jack Long, Zenberu Gugu, Shasuryu Shasha, Rororo Dragon, and Crusch Lulu to go with Zaryusu Shasha in the tank. as for Lech (Miriam), she was also turned and into a more blacker version with a horn pocking out of its forehead with glowing red eyes that the only white fur sticking out for her were the insides of her canine ears and a v shape going across her chest. she was not alone however as she looked like she was pregnant that with her was another wolf like creature, but this one was male for there wasn&#39;t any white fur on his chest. this made Dan think of both anime shows of Overlord and Farming Life in Another World, three if you count Jake&#39;s name from the show The Idhun chronicles as he was wondering on how she knew about what their names were when she hasn&#39;t seen the show just yet.<br />
<br />
When it was only Louie, Lopers (Dan) and Miranda (Julia) that were left  remained is when Kat turned to them. “Now then, my deers, I hope you had fun on my party. Just like the others I will keep you here as my pet, but instead of making you small, feral, begone to who knows where that you&#39;ll also remain as you are. Only additional to being my pets you&#39;ll also be included to be my servants. Is that okay for you, Louie? Miranda?” Kat said to both Dan and Julia.<br />
<br />
As much as two tried that they couldn&#39;t get any control back into themselves, nor Dan would have used his now sharp antlers to ram into his sister Kat while making her bleed out with a few small holes. Instead, the created Louie, Lopers and Miranda both answered: “we will be honored to serve you, mistress.”<br />
<br />
What pained Dan the most over the following days was to watch his best friend Aaron being fucked by his five male lizardmen while being called their girlfriend, making love with each other. as well as seeing the two wolves for one was Lech (Miriam) was readying herself to give birth on her first litter of pups for her mate Kuro was the one who mostly helped her out through this processes. He could have lived with the humiliation of serving his sister with his love Julie for even if some tasks were either disgusting or cruel, that wore him down badly. yet What Dan didn&#39;t know was that Kat´s magic made both wolves and the lizardmen act that way, as much to hide their human minds from other humans. But without control there was nothing they could do, and slowly they submitted to their new minds.</p>
