<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Don’t worry, I’ll let you know if I have objections, but so far I’m having fun being along for the ride,” Erus said with a grin, dropping her more-than-a-handful of bosom for the first time since transforming when Erby squealed with delight and pointed at the three men out on the town. <br />
<br />
The only sober one of the bunch, a man in stylish, academic attire with short, dark hair of which he clearly took a lot of care, looked as if he might die of embarrassment to be seen with the drunken fellows on either side of him. More than once, he had to reach out and grab the one on his left before he stumbled into the road, and it was a wonder he hadn’t -- oh, no, there he went, spewing the contents of his stomach all over a nearby parked car. While the sober one smacked a palm to his forehead and shouted, “Seriously, what is wrong with you, dude?” the momentarily unattended other drunken friend pointed and laughed so hard he fell over. He laughed all the harder when the car, freshly recolored with bile-green, activated its alarm and frightened the first into scrambling away like a shocked animal. <br />
<br />
“Do they really have to be these louts?” Cerby moaned. <br />
<br />
“I’m horny, so if they’re up for some weird triple-canine-person sex, then yes,” Erby said with a grin. “What do you think, Erus?” <br />
<br />
“I say, ‘why not all three’?” Erus said with a grin of her own. Then, louder, she called, “Oh, yoo-hoo! Room in your party for a three-in-one guest?” <br />
<br />
Looking as if he feared his look of ‘could the night get any worse’ was about to be answered, the sober friend glanced over at the trio of ladies with thinly-veiled annoyance before his eyes widened in shock. <br />
<br />
“You’re... You...” he stammered, eyes roving over the newly united sisters. “What the fuck are you?!” <br />
<br />
“Two randy anthropomorphic dog-women and the poor third soul they’re holding hostage,” Cerby grumbled. “That’s me, mind you. I’m the hostage. Not the other one. If I were you, I’d run before they tie you up in this mess, too.” <br />
<br />
“Now, now, let’s not be so hasty,” Erby said, leaping the three of them clear onto the other side of the single sober man as he attempted to bolt in the opposite direction, prompting his drunk friends to point and laugh at the ‘silly doggy with boobs’. “We’re aren’t going to hurt you, dear. We’re here to make you an offer.” <br />
<br />
“W-what would that be?” he stammered. <br />
<br />
“We’re horny as fuck and can’t reach back there,” Erus said, jerking a thumb over her shoulder where Erby lifted their tail. “Interested?” <br />
<br />
“I’m not... What...” the man stammered some more. <br />
<br />
“Take your time,” Erby said with a toothy grin. <br />
<br />
“Or don’t,” Cerby interjected, only for Erby to clamp a paw around her muzzle once more. <br />
<br />
“I’m not sticking my dick in some random three-headed dog woman with an actual dog’s lower body,” the man said, surprisingly steady after his earlier shakiness. <br />
<br />
“Fair enough,” Erus said with a shrug, crossing her arms beneath her ample bosom and giving it a not-so-subtle heft as she dramatically sighed. “I guess we’ll just have to find some other lucky bachelor to feel up six pairs of giant tits at once.” <br />
<br />
“Or get a triple blowjob with tongues more skilled than any human woman,” Erby added. <br />
<br />
Cerby said nothing, jaws still firmly clamped by Erby. <br />
<br />
“I’d be down for a triple blowjob,” one of the drunken louts spoke up, only for his sober friend to snap back, “No, you’re drunk. You can’t make good decisions when you’re drunk.” <br />
<br />
“You’re right,” Erus agreed as Cerby stepped the three of them closer, so close in fact that their collective busts were almost brushing against the sober man’s shirt. He’d backed up against a wall, but with an arm from Erby shooting out to his left and Erus leaning in on his right, he didn’t have much in the way of exit options. “But you’re not drunk, are you?” <br />
<br />
“Sure we can’t convince you?” Erby asked, batting her eyelashes. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, we’d show you a great time and... And... A... A-achoo!” Erus started to say before sneezing right in the sober man’s face. “Whoops, sorry about that. Oh, uh, really sorry about that other thing, too.” <br />
<br />
“What other thing?” the man asked, unable to see his nose darkening and broadening on his face, the lower half of which slowly began pushing out into a slight, wide muzzle, whisker sprouting alongside a flush of rich, golden fur. Only when he reached up to wipe his face from Erus’ sneeze did his eyes widen, as well as lighten from dark brown to emerald green, irises slivering in a decidedly feline fashion. “What did you three do to me?!” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I hadn’t even considered that,” Erby said with a giggle. “Well, long story short, we played around with magic and got a ‘Hades virus.’ Seems it’s contagious.” <br />
<br />
“What the fuck?!” the man said, his exclamation quickly deepening into a rolling baritone, going from a typical masculine pitch to something any bassy opera singer would envy. His neck thickened, the fur blooming out into a voluminous leonine mane of darker fur, while his ears migrated northwards and rounded. <br />
<br />
“What do you think he’ll become?” asked Cerby, her intrigue at the transformation seemingly taking over for her earlier despondence. <br />
<br />
“I’m detecting a real mythology theme,” Erby pointed out. “Maybe that giant lion from the labors of Hercules? Think he’ll turn female like us?” <br />
<br />
“I hope not,” Erus almost whined. “I don’t want to miss out on lion-man dick.” <br />
<br />
The man merely glared at the three as his transformation continued, his spine lengthening to give him several more inches in height. His shoulders broadened, clothes straining against bulging pectorals, the hems lifting up from such bulk to reveal an ordinary masculine stomach quickly becoming overtly so with well-defined abs. All four onlookers blushed profusely when the bulking-up spread to the newly lion-ized man’s pants, where a not-insignificant bulge became bigger, bigger, and bigger still, the pointed tip practically spilling out the top. It only grew larger when its flaccid form suddenly sprung up at attention, that blush returning with a vengeance across his feline cheeks. <br />
<br />
“Why am I so... Hot all of a sudden?” he panted, trying his best to hide his massive erect member but failing miserably. <br />
<br />
“In our experience, all transformations contain an erotic element,” Cerby said, Erus nodding and adding, “And you’re in the presence of such feminine beauty, so why not?” <br />
<br />
The lion-man glared at them again, but less so. <br />
<br />
“Whoa, dude!” gasped one of the former-human’s friends, broken out of his drunken stupor long enough to marvel at his companion’s transformation. “I thought you said you didn’t do ‘roids?” <br />
<br />
“Does this look like steroid use?!” the lion-man all but roared, only to gasp himself as said friend lifted into the air and flew towards him with alarming speed, slamming into him with a grunt. <br />
<br />
“Ooh, it’s not over,” Erby said with another grin. “Don’t think you’re getting away that easy!” <br />
<br />
This last comment was directed towards the third friend, who seemed to have sobered up enough to be attempting to sneak away, only for he too to come flying out to slam into the lion-man. <br />
<br />
The first drunkard sprouted coarse gray fur as his irises grew wider rather than taller, horns curling up from his head. A second torso grew from the base of his stomach, the front merging with that of the lion-man’s hips. The lion-man’s dick was swept up into the lower back-half of the new mass, which formed a sort of bulky goat-like lower body, similar in taur-ish appearance to the lower half of Cerby, Erby, and Erus. Though fronted by leonine paws, the hind legs looks much more bovid, sprouting cloven hooves. Further differentiating the two trio-beings, the new goat-man’s torso shifted position, moving directly behind the lion-man rather than sharing the front with him. <br />
<br />
“Whaaat the fuck?!” the goat-man bleated, his drunkenness evaporated by the changes as he too blushed intensely, flooded with the sensations of his new connected brother-self. “Whaaat’s haaapened to us?” <br />
<br />
“Consider it like having new roommates for your body,” Erby explained. “Only, you had to make additions to the house to fit everyone. And looks like you have one last person moving in.” <br />
<br />
As if on cue, the third friend’s legs melted into the central taur-mass of his soon-to-be brother-selves, his torso scooting back along their length until he was positioned right where their body’s new tail would be, facing away. His body bulked up like the others, clothes shredded away much like his skin, which dried and flaked off almost instantly to reveal a bright green scaly texture beneath. When he turned to try and get a look at himself and the others, they saw his irises slivering as well, twin fangs dropping from his upper lip as his hair grew out into a cobra-like hood encompassing his neck and upper-shoulders. <br />
<br />
“What have you freaksss done to me?!” he hissed. <br />
<br />
“Oh, I get it,” Cerby chuckled. “A chimaera, still very mythological.” <br />
<br />
“It took you that long to figure it out?” Erby tutted. <br />
<br />
“Shut up!” Cerby snapped. “You thought he was becoming the Nemean Lion without even knowing it was called the ‘Nemean’ Lion!” <br />
<br />
“Chimaera?” echoed the lion-man. “That sounds... Oh, my head feels... Dizzy...” <br />
<br />
He held his face in his great paw-hands as if briefly overcome by a vertigo, the goat-man and snake-man quickly following suit, before something seemed to ‘click’ and they all looked straight ahead (well, over his shoulder in the snake-man’s case) and locked eyes with Cerby, Erby, and Erus, that blush intensifying all the more. <br />
<br />
“Call me...” the lion man said with a gentle growl. “I think my name is Khim, now.” <br />
<br />
“And for some reason, I’m Imae,” the goat-man said. “Why is my name &#39;Imae?&#39; I had another name just a second ago, why can’t I think of myself at that? And my dudes, are those your thoughts in my head?!” <br />
<br />
“Eric,” greeted the snake-man. “Fuck, my buzz isss totally gone now.” <br />
<br />
“I think we can come up with a better way to pass the time than getting wasted,” Khim said, a purr rising in his throat as he stepped forward, apparently the one in control of their shared taur-body. “Cerby, Erby, and Erus, right? Is your offer still open?”</p>
