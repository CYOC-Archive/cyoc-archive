<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Selicia waited in her consulting room for her latest client to arrive. This one seemed to be emphasizing -late- as it had been 3 days of non-arrivals... Having a minor tick about punctuality of others, Selicia had made quick examples of previous transgressions. Markedly was the recent door stop currently holding the door open. That particular client had arrived an hour late delaying another from their own appointment. Without bothering to hear out the desire that man had had, Selicia inflicted the change immediately. He now lay on the floor as a chunk of sculpted wood with member dwarfed his body. The tip of which was now wedged beneath the door, hold up progress... Hold open the door to progress...<br />
<br />
This current client having been THREE DAYS LATE was going to have to suffer some fate even worse than that fool. The real question was just what to do with her. Having not seen what she looked like yet left options potentially limited. Maybe a nice coat rack for two? A nice piece of art hung above the mantle in this very room...? Both of those hinged fairly hard on their appearance in Selicia&#39;s eyes. Well then, she could just be a bit crass and have her take that poor maid&#39;s place in her bathroom. Despite having frequented that room this past week, she&#39;d nearly forgotten about that yellow dildo stuck to the bottom of the bathtub. She&#39;d taken to showering as of late having expected this client at anytime the past few days. With a brief nod to herself, Selicia settled on that thought especially considering if she looked awful it wouldn&#39;t matter.<br />
<br />
Another hour into today&#39;s wait there was a ring of the doorbell announcing an arrival at the door. Finally... Selicia waited in her chair for Marina to retrieve the woman at the door. What came to the door instead was Marina carrying a small cardboard box and a look of concern. &quot;Mistress, I was right by the door when the bell rang. When I opened the door, there was only this box... I didn&#39;t see anyone anywhere...&quot; She placed the box before Selicia and stepped back to the doorway. The box didn&#39;t bear any distinct markings on the outside of it but, there was a faint feel of magic about it however... Preparing herself for a trap Selicia waved Marina out of the room first. With a quick wave, the box opened itself revealing a plastic container nestled within.<br />
<br />
The container was what exuded the ambient magic that she felt. What lay inside the container once opened had explained another mystery. Within was a disembodied lump of flesh sporting a gently twitching vagina oozing its fluids at a steady pace. Already the heady aroma of the fluids hit Selicia in a wave as the fluids had filled a quarter of the container already. It was quite possible that she had been kept this way for the time she had been missing. Lifting the vagina out of its container left a thin strand of fluid connecting them until it split leaving a cool strand wetting her fingers. The thick red bush was matted and stuck firmly to the flesh of the lump. The simple contact from being picked up seemed too much for the woman as her voice permeated Selicia&#39;s mind. A nonsensical burst of euphoric bliss jumbled words into nothing as a burst of fluid flooded forward leaving Selicia&#39;s lap wet in the aftermath.<br />
<br />
With a look of disappointment, Selicia had determined that this may just be the work of an amateur... There really wasn&#39;t any recovering this thing at this stage, the mind held within had been warped by a botched attempt at constant arousal. This was less a woman now than it was a sentient vagina that merely felt ecstasy at touch. Pushing beyond that thought, Selicia dug deeper into the magic at play and saw the various inadequacies throughout the working. Amateur... However amateur or no, a rival in her hunting grounds would not be tolerated. After all, what would she have left to do if this pest continued this at heightened pace... Setting the vagina back into its container after yet another burst of fluid, she called Marina back in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marina Darling, be a dear and take this to Lisa, would you?&quot; She handed off the container and almost grinned as Marina recoiled from the aroma. &quot;Instruct her to clean and care for this and its container for the future. We wouldn&#39;t want our new guest to develop any issues after all.&quot; With Marina off on her task, Selicia settled on the last concern of the incident. &quot;This isn&#39;t quite as random as an amateur might&#39;ve considered... This was a client of mine, I&#39;m certain of it and it was placed on my doorstep... Someone wants to send me a message it seems. Far be it from me to not greet such a neighbor in kind, no?&quot; With a confident sneer, Selicia set off to her room to get changed for a surprise outing.<br />
<br />
Having dressed in a black evening gown, specifically the second victim of her return, she set forward to be obvious about her search. She kept watch for any odd touches of magic in the air as she turned heads along her walk. With a subtle gesture here and a flick of the wrist there, she put out traces of her own in less obvious ways. A blue dress in a window paled just a shade, a popped button holding back a sizable chest, and a suddenly unzipped fly nearby were just a few touches leaving a faint trail in her wake. There was other fading touches around as she walked, previous castings of her own, some from the now toyed mage girl, and even some from the man she used to capture the former. She ordinarily kept that set in her room as the aforementioned toy produced a lovely lavender and vanilla scent.<br />
<br />
Relishing the thought of her private little fix to that mage girl reliving the moment she briefly became one with her comrades forever in only the most pleasurable light~. Selicia nearly missed another trace similar to the one from earlier down a darkened alleyway. This one was actually older having very nearly faded entirely. As she sauntered down toward the source of that trace, a large figure stepped out of the shadows she had just passed. This man looked like he hadn&#39;t seen a fleck of daylight in years. With a gun to her back, he walked her further into the alleyway. Selicia&#39;s manner hadn&#39;t changed from the moment they made contact however, the gun had changed into a solid chunk of metal retaining its outer form. Having reached the source, Selicia decided to end the farce by turning on the man with a sultry smile. The confusion on his face when his toy failed was amusing enough as she pressed herself against him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come now, there&#39;s no need for that is there? All you want is to be inside me don&#39;t you~?&quot; The man&#39;s face quickly switched from confusion to a mask of anger. He moved to raise his arm and quickly found his body locked into position. &quot;Now now~. It&#39;s not polite to strike a lady, especially one so high above your station~.&quot; Running a finger from his waist to flick his nose, she left that magic to take its effect. As she closed in on the exact location of the trace, the sounds of clothing falling to the ground came from behind her. Opening a large trash can and peering within, she found the source laying within staring upward with lost eyes.<br />
<br />
There within the trash can was a woman become half completed sex doll. Selicia hefted the woman out of the can with some effort and noted the heavy use it or they had endured. Each of the available holes dribbled white fluid with more dried around each of them. As a small mercy and to ease her own investigation, Selicia removed the fluids, dried and fresh, from the woman. When she touched her again, Selicia felt that she had discovered a prior test subject of her mystery neighbor. There was nothing left of the personality within this body... If it could even be called that, the internal working of the body had been fully formed into a sex doll leaving the natural outer form preserved and very much real. The lips above and below glistened from its own produced lubrication. It seems that it had been likely discovered and utilized by her pursuer. The sound of metal clattering to the ground announced the continuation of the spell placed on them.<br />
<br />
Again, there was nothing Selicia could do if she had wanted to with this toy. Even more inadequacies in the spells had sealed this one to a poor fate. However, the mind of this one was intact, it was the soul itself that was missing... That... That did not bear the failings of an amateur... Something more was at play here and it didn&#39;t bode well by this foreshadowing. For now, Selicia decided to keep this victim of circumstance as well as example and oddity. Her magic surrounding the toy as it dwindled in size until it could be held in her palm. By now, she had felt her own spell on her pursuer had finished. Turning on the clothing behind her, she shifting the dirty articles around with her foot until a nondescript magenta vibrator shivered its way free of its pants. &quot;Maybe you&#39;ll get lucky again and find yourself in someone else&#39;s pants, hmm~? Well, best wishes and off with you.&quot; She kicked the vibrating toy deeper into the alleyway paying no heed to the loud clacks it made on its path.<br />
<br />
Returning to her previous effort, she continued her observation as she went deeper into the city. It took another several hours coming onto dusk before she felt the touch of fresh casting coming from a dark building nearby. Selicia confidently strode toward the building&#39;s front door and pushed her way in. The feeling permeated through the floorboards as the wasted power ascended almost as if it were a gas. So following the obvious clue hinting to their location, she made to find the basement stairs. Whether this person was a complete amateur in truth or a genius trapper was left to question as Selicia came upon the door to the basement wide open. She descended down the stairs quieting her steps in a reflection of caution before she came upon the magic being worked.<br />
<br />
The young woman had a wild cast to her eyes as she sneered almost nose to nose with her nude victim. The woman pressed against the all silently screamed as her limbs completely vanished into her torso. Her head began pulling into shoulders with her hair sliding off as if it were a wig. Apparently her weight had already diminished marked by the tormentor&#39;s fingers thrusting lifting the torso higher off the floor with each subsequent motion. The pace at which the victim&#39;s head was drawn inward was dreadfully slow but, when it completed her mouth rested where neck had once been. The equally disrobed tormentor hummed softly to herself as she peered at the mouth and stuck a finger in. She gasped in pain as she pulled the offending finger out with a bite mark around it. &quot;Yeah... I still can&#39;t quite get it right... You don&#39;t need teeth anyhow, now be a good toy and suck!&quot; Jamming the finger back in, she set about with the mental changes her wished to employ. That caused a cringe from Selicia as she noted just how poorly it was applied.<br />
<br />
Poorly done or not, the work was done as evidenced by a soft pop made by the exiting of the finger. A manic giggle preceded the toy being lifted from the ground before the tormentor turned to finally see Selicia standing there. She dropped the former woman to the dirty floor, it hit with the sound of flesh hitting stone. It flopped and jiggled with the consistency of a latex toy as it rolled away. The spent fluids collecting dust from the floor coating it in a soft gray. &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting to deal with you so soon~...&quot; Another manic giggle escaped the girl&#39;s lips as her wild eyes seemed to gain and lose interest in Selicia of their own accord. &quot;If I knew you were coming... I&#39;d have cleaned up a bit. Maybe even shared... Just a lil~&quot; She laughed throwing herself back against the wall before regaining focus. &quot;Seriously though, why&#39;d you have to break the script? Did one missed toy make you so mad? I gave it back didn&#39;t I?&quot; Her face effecting a facade of concerned innocence. &quot;Nah! Since you came let me show you what I can really do huh?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The fun began as it might be called with a clumsily hurled spell toward Selicia, she sidestepped a foot watching it flow by. &quot;Aww, too fast for me...&quot; The tormentor threw another flow of magic much faster than the last. Selicia actually had to deflect this time versus a simple dodge. A click of the girl&#39;s tongue and an angered grimace led the girl to throwing a flurry toward Selicia. &quot;Madam, said you&#39;d be a problem... You don&#39;t look so bad, I could take you myself I bet. Just need you to slip up and all that confidence will be mine to play with~.&quot; She threw her magic manically without concern of whether Selicia was there or not. &quot;I bet you&#39;ll make the best toy for me~. What kind do you wanna be huh? I&#39;ll let ya pick~. A fuck toy like that one, maybe a pocket toy like that client girl, or... or maybe a toy just for me~? How does being my little butt plug magic battery sound?&quot; She cackled and kept up her onslaught.<br />
<br />
Selicia stood her ground maintaining a defense rather than waste effort moving around and maybe cause an opening. With any luck this girl may even run out of power before too long. Hard to say with the current flow of effort as it were. Impatience worked against her and the consideration that a Master might find their way to their apprentice&#39;s defense led to her acting. Selicia gathered herself for a moment and thrust forward. Certainly the barrage covered a large area but, that left it thin... The flow of her magic cut through the flurry like a knife hitting the manic girl head on. Her brown hair flew into the air as her head snapped back and her flurry halted.<br />
<br />
As Selicia stepped forward, the girl&#39;s head snapped forward again with a crazed smile plastered on her face. &quot;Aww, ya got me, so tell me tell me tell me, whatcha gonna do with me huh? What&#39;s my new fate? I&#39;m I gonna be your plug then?&quot; She cackled insanely as the spell took hold of her body, limbs shrinking away. Selicia reached forward to take the remainder of the power the girl had from her. With the final trickle of power, a mental message slammed against the forefront of her mind. &quot;Hello... Selicia... How was the nap~?&quot; Selicia recoiled physically having heard a voice from so long ago. That voice... That voice meant more than minor inconvenience. She eyed the wild eyed girl who&#39;s limbs melted into her torso. &quot;Find something~?&quot; There was knowing in that smile now and yet as the changes furthered the wildness did as well.<br />
<br />
Selicia had settled on a form of punishment similar to what she had done to her victims. The girl&#39;s stomach contracted pulling her hips and chest toward each-other. Fluid dribbled out of those lower lips of their own volition. She writhed in ecstasy lolling her tongue out and rolling her eyes. As her vagina lips pulled up between her decent bust, she came to orgasm heavily. Panting heavily, she seemed to come back around to sanity as she looked about in confusion. &quot;Wh... Where am I? Wh... What&#39;s going on?&quot; She noted what was left of her body just as her head started it&#39;s descent. &quot;Oh! Oh god no! What&#39;s happening to me?!&quot; Her panic went wild as she hyper-fixated on her condition. &quot;Please! Please be a dream...!&quot; Her final cry as a human being was to beg as an innocent. Selicia retrieved the fleshy toy the girl had become and saw the spell set just above the clit. Disturbed by the mark and message she collected the other toy as well and left the house. The final note of the message playing in her head again and again.</p>
