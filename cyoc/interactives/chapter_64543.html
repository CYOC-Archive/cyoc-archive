<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen made it through first period without an incident. Barely. She knew she had a serious problem. It seemed like every moment she was getting hornier and hornier. She found her hand slowly sliding between her legs more than once and had to wrench it back and press it firmly into to top of the desk. By the end of first period she couldn't get the light taste of her self from her tongue. <br />
<br />
The bell rang and she stood, rushing out of the room without even looking at Vanessa or any of her other friends. She knew Vanessa was going to be mad but she didn't care. She just wanted to get to her next class and get through today. She had made it through first period, she had even taken a few notes. 'I can do this.' She told her self over and over. She was wrong. <br />
<br />
Near the end of second period, which happened to be biology, she had her first incident. So far during class she had found herself softly rubbing her crotch through her skirt. Actually touching herself in class, she realized blushing pulling her had away. She blushed furiously and prayed to God that no one had seen her. The incident however didn't happen until near the end of the period. There was a pop quiz. It started okay, she was certainly still very horny but she managed to ignore her urges and get the first couple problems done. Then the boy behind her started getting nervous.<br />
<br />
His leg bounced. Rapidly and continuously. His foot must have been touching her desk because it shook with him. Jens seat bounced up into her crotch over and over. Waves of pleasure swept over her. She grabbed the edges of her desk hard not to cry out. She turned in her seat. &quot;Stop that!&quot; She whispered far to sharply. The boy mouthed the word 'sorry' and stopped. Jen breathed deeply and continued, even finishing a couple more problems. Then the boy started again. Jen would have whirled on the boy again but she found herself absorbed by the motion. Wack wack wack. She pushed her crotch against the vibrating chair, gripping the edge of the chair between her legs and holding herself tight to it. The pressure began to grow and she strained not to start humping the seat right then and there. Her head fell back, eyes shut. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god.&quot; She heard a girls voice whisper. &quot;I think Jen fell asleep. Look! Shes even starting to drool!&quot; Her eyes snapped open and she sat up. Her juices were indeed starting to slip between her very wet lips and she quickly wiped away what the girl had mistaken for saliva on the shoulder of her blouse. The embarrassment helped her control herself until the bell rang a couple of minutes latter. She did not finish her quiz. Once again she rushed out of class quickly, not talking to anyone, or even slowing down. <br />
<br />
Gym was next. She was going to tell the coach that she wasn't feeling well and would ask if she could sit out for the day. She changed quickly into her gym clothes when she reached the locker room, before anyone else had arrived. She did not any of them to get a glimpse of what no longer lay between her thighs. Coach Meyers was in her office and as her usual bitchy self absolutely refused to let Jen sit out today. Today they were doing timed trials with various exercises. Sit ups, push ups, jump rope... And Jens grade depended on doing well. Jen grimaced and walked slowly from the office, out into the gym. The rest of the class slipped in slowly and she ignored them. The coach first split them into pairs. <br />
<br />
Jen was paired with Kate, a girl she barely knew but she knew Kate admired her. &quot;Hey listen Kate...&quot; Jen said quickly. &quot;I am really not feeling well, do you think we could just make up my times and write them on the card?&quot; She knew if Kate said no there was no way she could get through the period. Not with that much movement. Thankfully Kate agreed. All Jen had to do was stand very still and concentrate very hard on what Kate was doing during her trials and she seemed to be fine.. at first. She found herself watching Kate's head bobbing up and down during sit-ups. She imagined what it would feel like if she stood a bit closer, letting her head hit her between her legs... Maybe even with Kate's wet tongue and mouth.. She shuttered stunned at her own thoughts. <br />
<br />
It was near the middle of class when the second incident occurred. Coach had been walking around watching the girls do the various activities. She had reached Kate and Jen when they where on the jump rope. Kate was jumping while Jen stared at her heaving breasts, hands clutching the timer hard so they wouldn't fly to her crotch. What was wrong with her??! 'I don't even like women!' She thought to herself angrily. When the timer beeped Jen had no idea how many times Kate had jumped and wrote a random number on the sheet. Coach didn't walk away. She was waiting for Jen to take the rope. &quot;I uhh.. I already..&quot; Coach Meyers stared at her. Dark unibrow lowering menacingly. Jen took the rope. <br />
<br />
When Kate said to Jen started to jump. The feeling was immediate. She started to slow down but the coach was yelling at her. &quot;Is that all you got little lady? Jump!&quot; Her voice was low and ogreish. Jen jumped. Each time her feet hit the ground, vibrations shot up her leg and into her pussy-less crotch. Pleasure swept into each jump. Her heart beat faster and she began to jump faster. She could taste herself strong in her mouth now and continuously swallowed so she would not leak. She jumped even faster, getting more and more into the pounding feeling between her legs. She was no longer even aware of the two women watching her. Jump. Shudder. Jump. Shudder. Jump. She could feel her own breasts heaving at her gym shirt at was vaguely aware she had totally spaced her sports bra. She could feel the pressure building. She jumped faster and faster, legs pounding into the ground, her thighs slapping her crotch. When she was nearly to her climax her legs gave out and she stumbled to the ground. The orgasm hit her like a train and she shook, clutching both hands between her legs. Cum spurt out of her mouth in gobs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus!&quot; She heard someone cry. &quot;I think she is having a seizure!&quot; She felt hands on her when she stilled.<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; It was Kate. Jen nodded slowly. Coach Meyers looked pale, standing above her. It was obvious she was scared that she had actually made a sick girl work out today and wasn't sure what to do next...</p>
