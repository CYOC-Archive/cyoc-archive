<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait, what factory are you even talking about?&quot; Carrie asked.<br />
<br />
The cop slapped himself in the face in exasperation, pulling his hand and his face with it down in exaggeration. &quot;THE factory! Up on the hill, overlooking town? Whatever you need, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll have something for you. Look do I need to draw you a map?&quot; He pulled out a very large pencil and paper, scribbled a bit, and handed it to Carrie, and returned to his post as the hotel room door bulged open allowing several fireworks to fly out and explode in heart shaped patterns.<br />
<br />
While the map simply had a winding dotted path leading to a big red X and was no real help at all, it was easy enough for Carrie to find the factory, with its giant neon sign and smoke belching towers. Walking through the front door, she was greeted by a large blue cat in a business suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome welcome welcome! What can we do for you today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Carrie wasn&#39;t really expecting a factory to have a front desk, but it did make things more convenient. &quot;Right, well you see, there was a bit of a strange accident. My husband was turned into a toon, and it did something to his mind, and he just... ran off to a hotel room with-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Say no more!&quot; The cat flashed a huge grin. &quot;All any jealous housewife needs is one of our top of the line frying pans! One good bonk over the head and any lovely housewife can drag her unfaithful man home by the collar for a proper scolding!&quot;<br />
<br />
Carrie sighed. This was getting her nowhere. Aside from the weird dated sexism, if everyone here saw John as a woman, that gag probably wouldn&#39;t do anything, and somehow explaining that part kept going over everyone&#39;s head. Thinking for a moment, she decided to try another tactic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well no, you see... there&#39;s this woman I need to deal with. She&#39;s a real knockout see, every guy around just falls for her instantly-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hubba hubba!&quot; The cat drooled a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;And being just a regular flesh and blood human, I really just can&#39;t compete with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;LL say!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what I really need is-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A makeover?&quot; The cat pulled a large vanity out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Thank you. As I was saying, I need some way to get this woman knocked out, or trapped, or something like that. THEN I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be able to deal with my husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh! A proper jealous wife with a rivalry, is it? Why we have such a variety of products to help with such a quest! In fact, just sign here! We&#39;ll set you up with regular deliveries until you find the plan that works for you!&quot; He unfurled an absurdly long contract... consisting of nothing but black lines instead of text, beyond the big blank at the bottom that said &quot;SIGN HERE.&quot; Normally Carrie would be worried about a thing like this, but she was pretty sure nothing in this could possibly hold up in a real court if it really came to it, and she really just wanted to get John back to normal as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent! Now, off you go! We deliver anywhere!&quot;<br />
<br />
Carrie was confused. &quot;Deliver? Is this going to take a while? Honestly we hadn&#39;t even really found a proper hotel room yet...&quot; Well, one of us hasn&#39;t, she thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about a thing ma&#39;am,&quot; the cat assured her. Our products always arrive in time. Anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
That did seem to make some sense by cartoon logic, she just had to find John again. Checking with the hotel, it seemed the three had finally... finished, and the wolves had left for work out blowing down houses and impersonating grannies respectively. She asked if the clerk had seen the woman they came in with leave, at which point a huge thought bubble appeared over his head, with a pan up from John&#39;s shoes to her voluptuous new ass swaying back and forth as she made her way out the door, accompanied by saxophone music. Not precisely helpful.<br />
<br />
With no choice left but searching the streets, she spent a good 10 minutes tapping anyone in a red dress on the shoulder and being met with various irritated responses, before finally spotting her beau turned bombshell being bridal carried out of a bar by some bull in a business suit, his face covered in lipstick marks. Before she could shout to them however, she was tapped on the shoulder and asked to sign for a very large wooden crate. Taking a crowbar to it, the whole thing collapsed at once, resulting in a cosmetics table, two chairs, and a big sign labelled &quot;free samples.&quot; The delivery man then pulled an impossibly tight lime green cartoon dress over a rather Carrie, who was instantly mobbed by mostly quite homely cartoon women eager for a free makeover. She definitely saw John in the crowd at one point but there were so many others loudly and forcefully demanding she smear some lipstick and blush on them she somehow lost her in the crowd, and every time she tried to stand up and leave, someone forced her back into the chair asking for beauty tips.<br />
<br />
After what felt like hours, the crowd finally thinned out, and she was pretty sure she knew where to find John, spotting a parked car on an overlook that was certainly bouncing up a storm with smoke and fireworks pouring out the windows. This time she was just going to walk up and pull John out herself, but another deliveryman somehow just appeared in her path, insisting she open another crate. This one had a fake storefront advertising a shoe sale, and sure enough, John came rushing out from the car in one single stretchy step with dollar signs for eyes ready to check things out... immediately followed by all the women she&#39;d been forced into giving makeovers, who trampled over Carrie in a large dust cloud. Being trampled flat didn&#39;t hurt as much as it likely would have if she hadn&#39;t still been wearing that toon dress, but she did have the alarming experience of having to grab a convenient nearby spatula to pry herself off the ground and pound all the shoe prints out of her dress.<br />
<br />
It was now very late, and doing her best to tail John, she saw her being walked to the front door of a small house by a pig in a bowtie, who she planted a huge kiss on before tucking a finger under his tie and leading him inside, slamming the door behind them and... presenting a very clear silhouette through the blinds as she undressed and crawled into bed with him. This was starting to get confusing. Why would she have to invite this guy into his own home? Had this place just given John her own permanent residence here just for a joke&#39;s sake? Who was Carrie kidding, of course it had.<br />
<br />
A third package showed up around when Carrie&#39;s thoughts started to get drowned out by all the squeaking bedsprings and train whistles. This one was a bit smaller than the others, containing what appeared to be a deliveryman uniform miniature rocket ship, a large bundle of dynamite, a simple instruction sheet clearly indicating that she was supposed to light the fuse, stick the dynamite inside what she now noticed was labelled the &quot;Pocket Rocket&quot; and... right. It seemed like a bit of an escalation, but at least she wouldn&#39;t be trampled this time. So she put on the disguise, just before the pig walked out the front door, blowing John a kiss and staggering off with what appeared to be very shakey legs and a crushed pelvis, lit the fuse, shoved the explosives inside the &quot;rocket&quot; and...</p>
