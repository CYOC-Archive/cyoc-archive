<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>First erotica chapter that focused on. Any suggestions are open. Just message me.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aylwin is a mess these past few hours. He’s locked up in his room trying on his ‘Farkas’ body but he’d wince in pain when the bruises endured by the body hit his system. It’s his best face from the collection he has amassed. The body stands equal with Carim and has the same twunk build as him. There are notable scars here in there, one of which is a small fierce scar etched on his left brow. When Aylwin wears Farkas’ face, he always gives him a youthful vagrant look, like a mafia smirking at every person he passes. But now, his face is filled with pain and he looked weak as he cried from the agony of broken bones.<br />
<br />
“Why do you keep wearing that face, Aylwin?” I asked. “It’s hurting you.”<br />
<br />
“You damn know why,”<br />
<br />
It wasn’t my idea to make him help me take over the body I’m in right now. Edward beat him to a pulp and covered his body with bruises as much as shame. With his Farkas’ persona benched, Aylwin’s chances with the city sluts and man-whores were greatly damaged. Sure he got his fling here and there but Aylwin said they weren’t as enjoyable as his Farkas’ body. It’d take at least a month before the mask fixes itself. And there’s no guarantee that there won’t be any irreparable damage when he comes back.<br />
<br />
As of now, Aylwin wore the face of a boy farm’s hand. It’s young but the lad is a brute with hands covered in old scars and thick callouses. His pectorals bursts with thick and dense muscles that shone with a thin layer of sweat. With the face fully covering his body, Aylwin emerged out of the covering of skin naked down to the bum. I could see the monstrosity dangling between his legs, an 8-inch uncut flaccid dick that’s thick as two of Edward’s index fingers.<br />
<br />
“Fuck!” Aylwin cursed. “I’m so fucking horny!”<br />
<br />
Aylwin walked over the window and opened it, letting the warm Cordovan summer breeze enter the room. He didn’t care if people saw him naked. He didn’t even care when female seamstress from the street across pointed and blushed at his package. <br />
<br />
When the breeze hit Aylwin’s skin, it carried his musk that was somehow retained during the weaving process. He smelled like the earth, freshly cut grass and not to mention, the deep odor perspiring from his skin. I- I feel weird yet familiar, like the feeling I had yesterday at the bar. A tight sensation wrapped around my dick, making me queasy and irritable in the door frame. I’d like to leave and quench this temptation alone in my room. It’s been days since I let out some steam. I can’t do it when I’m traveling with two other people who see me most of the day. I want to leave and get it out of my system but the magnificent sight stretching out a yawn is something my eyes could not get out from. <br />
<br />
“Jon?” Aylwin asked. “Jon!”<br />
<br />
I snapped from my daze.<br />
<br />
“You’re staring and drooling. Are you bewitched?”<br />
<br />
That’s one way of putting it.<br />
<br />
“Jon? Are you list-” Aylwin stopped as his gaze locked onto that formation in my groin. “This again? Where’s the girl? Or boy…” Aylwin looked around but found there’s no one behind him or me. Then his head stopped and slowly turned to mine, “is it me?”<br />
<br />
My silence meant my agreement. I reached for his bare brown chest and traced my fingers in its nips. My approach surprised Aylwin but it is a surprise he welcomed with all his arms. His hands wrapped around my younger body and led me to his feathered bed. It’s a messy landscape, one we messed further with our crashing bodies. <br />
<br />
“I didn’t know you like this face,” He said in his husky voice. Aylwin was a brute as much as his current body, his legs spread my legs open and dug his palms to my balls. I undressed my vest and placed myself closer on top of him. I am an instrument for him to fiddle with his thick fingers. This body might have bedded with many others but my inexperienced soul perceived everything as new and raw. Aylwin’s hands cupped my balls and led it to the crevasse of my ass. Slowly, he pulled off my sheep-skin shorts, making me bare for him to see. My body is a sculpture adorned with markings of various animals. I am a canvass of stone, chiseled with dense yet willow muscles. In respite of my solid form, this body is cursed with a sensitive touch. When Aylwin pronged his fingers and poked my balls, my spine felt like it would crumble from the touch. I jumped but his arms caught me and touched me in places before my mind could even register it. <br />
<br />
“Your body is sensitive ain’t it?”<br />
<br />
My silence meant my agreement. Aylwin placed the tip of my uncut dick between his index and thumb and rolled it sideways. He touched me in different ways, each one striking me with glorious mewls - novice, raw and real. My hands clutched on his pecs and tried to focus my attention back on tracing his nips. But Aylwin was faster. In the time between losing attention, he has lubricated his fingers with his saliva and slowly prodded my tight bum. He was careful, unsure of what response I will give. But when he saw me flushing redder and my sounds getting wetter, he smiled and pushed it even further.<br />
<br />
I could feel it, his calloused indexes rubbing my dick and squirming inside my ass. They synced in the tempo of their beat. The one on the left sought to scour my ass of the secrets of its depth while the left aimed to find the surprise of my foreskin. We knew what rewards lay hidden behind these wraps. He found my prostate and the tip of my dick lay defenseless against the lick of the cold morning breeze. With these two, I squirmed and couldn’t hold on to the prize he’s been seeking. I moaned - red and wet I moaned. I bit my lips just to contain this slick feeling rocking my inner core but it’s a futile attempt.<br />
<br />
I moaned but in the middle of it, Aylwin stopped it by catching my mouth off guard with his own. It was momentary. He gave me air, he game time, and reserved a moment just to admire my fierce face reduced to a weak boy begging for more stimulation. He kissed me again - deeper and longer this time. I haven’t been kissed my entire life but this body does. For a moment, I let Edward’s experience take a foothold of my mouth. Call it a muscle memory if you will but the pleasure is all the same. We shared our tastes with the dance of our tongues. Aylwin was an animal that broke the beat and letting all of him enter and invade me. <br />
<br />
All the while, his hands were fumbling for his clothes, undressing and flitting them away from the bed. We’re both naked and bare but we dressed with each other’s scent. Aylwin broke off the kiss to apply a slob of both our saliva on our dicks. God, I miss lubricants. Nevertheless, he spread my legs apart and huffed as he looked at me.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to put it in,”<br />
<br />
My silence meant my agreement. The euphoria of the kiss still hasn’t left my skin. My heart is throbbing hard, paralyzing me. <br />
<br />
Aylwin was wary at first. He pumped his shaft to make it a little bit hard. With fresh blood making his dick alive, he rubbed the tip where my hole might be. He circled my anus and slowly, he slid it in. His entrance was a tight fit. It came out as a surprise and that made me clench my ass harder.<br />
<br />
“Let me in,” Aylwin chuckled. <br />
<br />
Fine. I huffed. I relaxed my muscles and opened up my ass. His caution seemed to have disappeared like the mist. He was brisk and thrust his shaft deeper without recourse. I screamed in pain as my ass spread apart from the sudden force.<br />
<br />
“Be careful,” I said, wincing as tears flowed on my cheeks.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry. I got excited.”<br />
<br />
He splayed his arms on my pristine chest and used it as a foothold when he pulled out his dick from my ass. Slowly but surely, he inserted it once more - sending mousy squeaks every time he repeated the motion. I grasped the loose pillows and noticing that they did nothing to hold me from the streaks invading my skin. Like an overture, Aylwin hit me harder, faster than his little mistake before. It’s spreading me open and I couldn’t do anything as his critical strikes dug deeper and deeper into me. <br />
<br />
I could feel it. His dick is bigger and the veins rubbed on the walls of my ass. It’s throbbing, beating in sync without hears. Aylwin grit his teeth, his hands yanking my short hair and unwrapping the bandana on my forehead. <br />
<br />
Aylwin tried to bite his lips as I did. But like before, that did nothing to contain his screams when he came inside me. Warm thick cum covered the perimeter of my ass, squeezing its entire contents and filling me within. We stayed like this for a minute, him wrapping his thick arms and giving me minute kisses here and there.<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” he said. “We should do this a lot,”<br />
<br />
My silence meant my agreement. The silence that’s covered by the ebbing moans and the sparks coursing through my veins.</p>
