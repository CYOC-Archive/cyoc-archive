<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad couldn&#39;t believe what was happening to him, let alone who had done it.  Rick was his buddy. Rick would never...but he had.  Chad was hanging in the air, and Rick was holding him with one hand while he filmed Chad.  Fuck, fuck, fuck!  screamed Chad silently.  Then, Rick pulled down his sweat pants.  Chad marveled at how huge Rick was.  Why hadn&#39;t he noticed before?  Oh, of course, when Chad had seen Rick in the locker room he had been considerably larger.  Now that he had gone from over six feet to under six inches, he realized that was the reason Rick looked huge.  It took Chad a few moments to realize that Rick was really going to put him on. It was only as he slid up Rick&#39;s smooth shaven legs that he realized that he was about to be filled by Rick&#39;s dick, nuts and ass. Chad felt so small and insignificant. Then Rick reached inside him and grabbed his cock at both end and pulled it tight, and tied it in a bow. No! Ow, ow, ow. My cock is now the suit&#39;s drawstring, sighed Chad. Then he recalled what Rick had said just before tying Chad&#39;s penis in a knot, he was going to replace Chad&#39;s string with his old string. Would that be like castration? <br />
<br />
Mmmpft! Chad&#39;s mouth was full.  He had a crotch level view of the Field House, as Rick proceeded to stow Chad&#39;s clothes and stuff in a gym bag.  The he pulled on his sweat pants, and plunged Chad into darkness.  Warm, musky darkness enveloped Chad.  He felt as though he was having a killer workout.  He was stretched to his limit by Rick&#39;s massive boner.  It felt like there was a redwood inside him.  He kept reminding himself that he had seen Rick&#39;s boner before and it was only 6 or 7 inches.  It was big, but Chad&#39;s was bigger. For that matter so was Bruno&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Rick had only changed Chad because he was saving Chad from Bruno.  Chad was doomed to be a Speedo, and Bruno wanted him to be his permanently.  Rick had indicated that Chad wasn&#39;t permanently a Speedo - but he had added yet.  What did he mean by that?  Well, maybe Bruno still was a threat.  If Rick took Chad off, maybe Bruno would steal him.  Mm, salty pudding? Hm?  That&#39;s what he was tasting?  But?  EW!  Rick was leaking pre-cum, and it was having the weirdest affect on Chad.  He was no longer concerned about being a Speedo permanently or even temporarily.  He felt contented.  Sure he was a Speedo, but he was a champion Speedo.  He wasn&#39;t even worried about being castrated anymore.  He was owned by Rick now, Rick would do whatever was best for him.<br />
<br />
It was getting hotter and damper as Rick ran across campus to the natatorium. Chad relaxed recalling his times sitting naked in the sauna with Rick after football.  Damn, he was lucky.  He&#39;d Rick&#39;s lucky suit, and if that meant replacing his drawstring dick with Rick&#39;s lucky string, well, it wasn&#39;t like he was using it anymore as a dick.  <br />
<br />
Chad was vaguely aware of the sound of a door slamming, and then heard Bruno&#39;s voice shout, &quot;So it didn&#39;t work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick pulled down his sweat pants, and sunlight streaming through the windows and skylights and glinting off the water temporarily blinded Chad.  It also woke him up to his dire situation.  He was a fucking Speedo.  He had lost 99% of his body mass?  How had that happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry we&#39;re late, Bruno, Chad was just getting introduced to Little Rickie and my balls,&quot; Rick explained.<br />
<br />
Little Rickie?  Damn, that precum was intoxicating like a drug, it made me happy to be a Speedo.  Shit, if he were to blow a couple loads in me, I&#39;d be totally wasted. I probably wouldn&#39;t even remember being me - being human?  Chad wondered fearfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I was sure he&#39;d pick me in the pool over you in the Field House,&quot; whined Bruno.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he didn&#39;t exactly know who he was meeting at the Field House, that&#39;s why I was sure I&#39;d win. I simply signed my invitation his &quot;Secret Admirer.&quot; You know if you had tried a written invite, he might have accepted,&quot; laughed Rick. &quot;Ready for laps?&quot; he asked as he dove into the pool.<br />
<br />
Cold water enveloped Chad and he seemed to cling more tightly to Rick.  Secret admirer?  Rick?  But he&#39;s my bud.  Even if he&#39;s got a man-crush, he will change me back.  I know it. I just have to support him.  Why am I holding my breath?  I am a Speedo.  I don&#39;t have to breathe or hold my breath. The laps back and forth across the pool soon became tedious.  Chad zoned out. He was aware of Bruno swimming in the next lane, and a couple other guys joined them swimming laps. Hours dragged on. <br />
<br />
When Rick finally dragged his sorry ass out of the water, it was dark outside.<br />
<br />
Oh, great thought Chad, I missed dinner.  And my folks will be wondering where I am.  The cops should be here looking for me - oh, right, they&#39;ll be looking for a man not a Speedo.  Chad felt dejected.<br />
<br />
Rick showered and lathered and rinsed without removing his Speedo.  Then he ran the shower until it was icy.  After a good cold shower, he followed Bruno into the sauna.  Chad had new perspective. Bruno stood facing Rick.  He was inches from Bruno&#39;s crotch.  He couldn&#39;t help admiring the man&#39;s big manhood.  He almost envied Bruno&#39;s Speedo for being so full.  Damn, Rick was hard again and leaking precum.  Gotta fight it.</p>
