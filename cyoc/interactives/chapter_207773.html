<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took almost a half hour before Jodie could extract her penis from Nathan&#39;s vagina. In the meantime, as they waited, they first blamed each other for what had happened, had their first row as a couple, then, when they calmed down, tossed ideas back and forth about hour to get unstuck and what they should do, with the general consensus being to use the Amulet of Zulo the moment the twelve hours had passed.<br />
<br />
Nathan, the instant heard this, found himself frightened by the notion that he&#39;d have to until around ten the next day. He didn&#39;t want to have to wait that long, as he tried to convince himself he didn&#39;t know the first thing about his female genitals, but found this wasn&#39;t accurate. As he and Jodie finally separated, several things came to him. The first was that, despite what he said, he had actually enjoyed the sensation of being mounted, of having an erect penis thrust into his slick feminine folds. Trying not to whimper at such a realisation, it also came to him he knew how to go to the bathroom, what to do after he&#39;d peed, even how to properly bathe himself. Bothered by all this, and the fact that he also had a tail, he yipped out, &quot;Whatever we do whilst we wait, I vote for not a repeat of what we did. It felt, good, but I&#39;m not sure I can handle at the moment another go around.”<br />
<br />
Across from, Jodie shifted so that her legs hung over the side and her feet were planted on the floor. Hearing the distress in her fiancé&#39;s voice, and smelling it coming off him, she found herself muddled up. On one hand, she found it felt great, that it seemed natural, for her to have male genitals. Yet, at the same time, she found it disturbing to feel her nuts lying against her leg, to look down and see her penile sheath, knowing that housed within was her penis, kenning that it was really a canine dick, complete with a penile bone, almost similar to os clitoris Nathan now had. Looking over at her fiancé, wanting to tell him that she couldn&#39;t mount him if she wanted to, that he didn&#39;t have the same aroma as before, the one that triggered her and let her know the other was in heat and ready. Instead, she nodded after a bit and said, &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her long, thin tail thumped against the bed and Jodie eventually looked down at the shirt and the red collar. Curious to know why the Amulet of Zulo had started her on the path to becoming a dog, and a male one at that, she speculated on whether it was impossible to combine articles of things together. Wanting the book from her grandmama&#39;s library, she almost reached for her clothes, and instead lay down. Scooting up the bed until her head was on the pillow, she listened as Nathan lie down behind her, forcing her tail downward and to follow the split of her legs. Spooning together, neither said a thing until Jodie asked, &quot;What happens if we go to sleep and wake up tomorrow fully transformed into a couple of dogs? Will we even be able to change back? Will we even still be in the same place? Or will whatever is changing us relocate us, for lack of a better word?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her fiancé didn&#39;t answer right away, and at first she thought he&#39;d fallen asleep. After a moment, the mattress creaked and Nathan reached across her to turn out the light. Lying in the darkness, hearing his movements, she listened as he finally whispered, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I just hope if it does happen that way, I am still with you,&quot; as he pushed his hand under her arm and rested it so that his hand was cupping her bare breast.<br />
<br />
Not believing for a second she&#39;d fall asleep, she was startled awake when she heard the curtains being drawn. Looking about, thinking the previous night had been a weird, fucked up dream, she groaned at both the sudden brightness, but also the figure of Nathan, who had a long tail, now covered in white fur, and, when he turned around, what was clearly a female crotch. Forcing herself up, she leaned forward, hugged her knees, and as she looked down at her male privates, Jodie moaned, &quot;It wasn&#39;t a dream, was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Afraid not,&quot; Nathan said as he dropped to all fours and began to scrabble about on the floor.<br />
<br />
Jodie, who&#39;d finally torn her eyes away from her penile sheath and canine nut sack, glanced over and concerned, asked, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
From beneath the bed came the immediate muffled reply of, &quot;It&#39;s after eight now. I&#39;m going to find the Amulet of Zulo and undo what happened,&quot; before he wiggled back out and held up the necklace.<br />
<br />
Relief at the sight of the medallion washed over Jodie and she wanted to snatch it out of her fiancé&#39;s hand. Restraining herself, she forced herself to tell him, &quot;You use it first. I&#39;ll wait until you have gotten your manhood back before I give it a go,&quot; and standing, she noted the time, that she’d slept for around nine hours, headed for her dresser, where she took out a bra, shirt, a pair of jeans, and a pair of panties.<br />
<br />
Next to the bed, Nathan looked down at the necklace as he reached for the pants he&#39;d worn the previous night. His hand missing the first few times, he was soon forced to look away from the object in his hand. Finding and picking up his pants, he dropped them on the bed. Glancing over at Jodie, who struggling to get her bra on, he breathed out, &quot;Right. Here goes,&quot; and reaching down, breath held, he touched the Amulet of Zulo to his pants and his exposed skin. Waiting for the same sensation as the night before, he touched the two together a second time, then a third time, and when he still didn&#39;t feel the familiar prick, he exhaled, &quot;Huh,&quot; and headed for his dresser to get something else.<br />
<br />
Jodie, who&#39;d missed what Nathan had said and all that had transpired, worked the clasps on her bra, adjusted the shoulder straps, and found that no matter what she did, the thing was not only a cup size too big, but also it didn&#39;t feel right wearing the thing. And it wasn&#39;t the usual discomfort she got when she had a bra on, but rather she found it was more of a sensation like something was telling her it was inappropriate, that girls wore those things, not her. Finding this curious, she took the thing off, gazed at it, and after a moment, tossed it on her dresser. Reaching for her panties, she found when she pulled them on that not only did her tail prevent her from putting them on properly, but also her penis sheath made a unsightly bulge in the front, as well as experiencing the same feeling she&#39;d gotten with wearing a bra. Taking off the underwear, she set them next to the bra and confused, she pulled on her shirt and pants, which were now super tight and couldn&#39;t be buttoned. Getting frustrated, she turned her attention to Nathan.<br />
<br />
After he&#39;d tried every pair of pants he owned, Nathan had tried his underwear, socks, and started on his shirts before he&#39;d given up. Frustrated, at a loss as to what he was doing wrong, he glanced over at his fiancé. As she turned to him, he whimpered out, &quot;I don&#39;t know what I am doing wrong,&quot; as she began to say, &quot;None of my...&quot; but trailed off as she stared open mouth at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he demanded after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm, have you looked down?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I have,&quot; Nathan barked. &quot;It was the first thing I did upon waking when I went to go use the bathroom and discovered I had to sit down to pee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taken aback by his tone, Jodie tried to recall if she&#39;d seen what she was seeing now when she’d woken. Drawing a blank, but certain she hadn&#39;t, she whispered, &quot;You&#39;ve changed even more,&quot; and watching as Nathan looked down at the six teats that he now had, she hugged herself as she heard him snap out, &quot;What the fresh hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perplexed, surprised, and a host of other emotions, Nathan couldn&#39;t begin to fathom that, instead of changing back, he&#39;d instead changed even more.  Reaching down to touch each of the growths, he was alarmed to find them sensitive to the touch. Looking over at Jodie, he tossed her the Amulet of Zulo, telling her, &quot;This thing is fucking useless. Instead undoing what it&#39;s done, it&#39;s actually made it worse,&quot; as the woman caught the necklace by the chain.<br />
<br />
With a quick glance down at the medallion, Jodie said, &quot;I&#39;m sure that there is a rational reason for why it didn&#39;t change you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you believe that, why don&#39;t you prove it works, that it can undo everything, and use it to transform yourself back to who you used to be,&quot; Nathan snapped as he sat down on the bed, shifted about to get comfortable, couldn&#39;t, and standing, began to pace back and forth.<br />
<br />
She found there was nothing more she wanted than to turn back to who she&#39;d been before she found the Amulet of Zulo. But watching her fiancé pace back and forth, his tail wagging in agitation, Jodie found she couldn&#39;t bring herself to the point of doing so. Asking herself, &quot;What if it doesn&#39;t work? What if the change is one way?&quot; she then found herself posing the question to herself, “What if it does work? Could I do that to myself? Transform back, but leave Nathan to be stuck, changing into a bitch? Would it even be fair?&quot; and feeling like it wouldn&#39;t, she lowered her arm to her side and stepped over to Nathan&#39;s dresser.<br />
<br />
Bottom drawer still open, she shucked off the pants she had on. Giving it some thought, she reached down and took out a pair of her fiancé&#39;s jeans and pulled them on. Careful not to zip herself neo-genitals up, she paused when Nathan inquired, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine don&#39;t fit anymore,&quot; Jodie immediately answered as she button the jeans, which were a few sizes too big.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is just fucking great,&quot; Nathan whined and as Jodie put the necklace around her neck, he said, &quot;So, what now? Am I expected to wear your clothes and you wear mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until we find a reason why you cannot change back, I&#39;m going to have to wear your pants,&quot; Jodie explained as she went to look for Nathan&#39;s belt.<br />
<br />
A soft moan escaping him, Nathan whispered, &quot;This is turning into a nightmare,&quot; and hugging himself, he dropped his arms to his side when he felt them brush up against his teats. Looking at Jodie, thinking that she actually look cute, in a mannish sort of way, he shook his head to clear such thoughts and asked, &quot;So, you&#39;re not going to change back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until we can find a way to turn you back as well,&quot; she answered as she adjusted the pants so her tail wasn&#39;t so pinched. Glancing over at her fiancé, seeing the distressed look on his face, she stepped over to him and drawing him into a tight hug, she whispered, &quot;Hey, it&#39;ll be all right. Will go back to grandmama&#39;s, find the book, and figure out what went wrong,&quot; and pulling away, she watched him nod as she led him over to her dresser, were she helped him pick out a soft cotton t-shirt, a pair of her jeans, and listened patiently as he echoed the question she&#39;d asked the night before.<br />
<br />
With no answer to it, she mulled it over before she said, &quot;Truthfully, I don&#39;t know. I guess we&#39;ll have to wait to see, and hope that it doesn&#39;t come to that point,&quot; and when Nathan eventually nodded, she playfully bit at his ear, and growled out, &quot;Come on. Let&#39;s go see if we can find breakfast,&quot; and feeling frisky, she found she didn&#39;t need to coax him too much to come with her, and exiting the bedroom, they headed for the kitchen.</p>
