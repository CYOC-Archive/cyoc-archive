<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle and the rest of the team began the run around the course Circe had planned. Circe, while riding the girl she was on who managed to run rather quickly somehow, kept looking back to see the progress  the club was making and was mildly surprised at the level of fitness the club had. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry up young foals. If you want to make it back before it rains, you are gonna need to pick up those hooves and gallop.&quot; Circe encourages, which results in a few people trying to run faster to catch up.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, at the back of the crowd, was Kyle awkwardly and quietly running. He was more preoccupied with making sure no one could see his bulge and obvious wardrobe malfunctions. His attempts were futile as Rose noticed Kyle at the back and slowed down to be at the same pace as him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kyle. Doing ok back here?&quot; Rose pryed, seemingly glancing over his body as well and eyeing his crotch and blushing<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine. Just gotta deal with some Male problems ha ha.&quot; Kyle awkwardly jokes as he looks away.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s kinda obvious what all of you stallions are going through.&quot; Rose mumbles as she blushes and looks to the ground.<br />
<br />
Seemingly just running in silence for about 10 minutes, the two just focus on following Circe on the girl. After a while longer Kyle decides to start another conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Rose. What did you think when Coach Circe started treating that girl like a horse, even making her act like one.&quot; Kyle asks, looking over the Rose&#39;s beautiful face.<br />
<br />
&quot;For some reason, jealous. The girl&#39;s a friend of mine yet when I see her being ridden and wearing all that horse gear. I think to myself why couldn&#39;t it have been me being ridden by Circe.&quot; Rose begins ranting, like if it was a personal issue for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m honestly the same and I dunno why. Just look at that girl while getting ridden, she just seems to just not care what we think.&quot; Kyle rants alongside Rose as they look to the girl.<br />
<br />
The girl Circe was on was completely naked, except for horse gear designed for a human to wear. Circe was sat right in between the girls shoulders and ass which jiggled with each trot of her arms and legs. Her ass also seemed more muscular and fatter tgen before, out-classing all the other girls in the club while her dripping horse like vagina was just below her anus.<br />
<br />
The girl seemed to be a little more hairier then before. Brown splotches of fur like hairs were appearing on the girl&#39;s skin and limbs while a tuft of black fur was appearing on her tail bone. The girl&#39;s bone structure seemed to change slightly too as her spine caved inwards allowing for the saddle to perfectly conform to her body. Her legs also seemed to be shorter, or maybe her arms were longer, Kyle didn&#39;t know but what Kyle noticed is that they were the same length so her back was perfectly parallel to the ground.<br />
<br />
While looking at the girl, Kyle hadn&#39;t noticed that he was having an issue until the front of his shorts felt weird. Kyle looked down to see that he seemed to have leaked and a wet patch of urine had appeared on them and is still growing as he continues to leak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, does something smell like urine or is it just me?&quot; Rose looks over to Kyle and realises what just happened. &quot;OhMyGodIamSoSoSorryIdidn&#39;tSeeAnythi-ng!&quot; Rose splutters as she quickly looks away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t look and wait for to deal with this. I&#39;m just gonna go into the bushes to sort it out so just wait in the meantime.&quot; Kyle embarrassingly walks into the bushes to relieve the urine he was still excreting.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sure. G-go do that.&quot; Rose mumbles<br />
<br />
As Kyle crouched behind the bush, he stripped out of his shorts. While doing that, he managed to catch his penis much larger then it was early today. Kyle was also pretty sure what looked like a sheath had started to form around his penis full of brownish fur like hairs, similar to the ones seen on the girl Circe was riding.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell am I gonna do with these and what am i gonna wear now? Ugh, guess I&#39;ll just wear the shorts despite them being covered in urine. Also why did I just urinate uncontrollably into the shorts. I&#39;m a human, not some wild stallion who pees where ever it likes.&quot; Kyle began to rant but just gave up and did what he thought was right.<br />
<br />
Kyle stepped out if the bushes, his wet shorts clinging to his penis. Rose noticed but instead of looking away like before, she just stared at it in a strange way.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t have anything else to wear so I&#39;m going to have to wear the shorts. I hope you can bare seeing my dick through them.&quot; Kyle blushed furiously as his dick bulges the shorts out<br />
<br />
&quot;I-it&#39;s fine. I kinda had to do something myself.&quot; Rose announced, getting confusion from Kyle.<br />
<br />
Kyle looked at Rose, not understanding what she meant. That was until he thought he smelt what could only be described as horse dung coming from Rose&#39;s direction. Looking at Rose, Kyle caught a glimpse of a brown stain on Rose&#39;s gym shorts that caused the fabric to become even more transparent and could show Kyle that Rose was going commando too.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what&#39;s the matter Kyle?&quot; Rose mutters embarrassed<br />
<br />
&quot;You shitted like a mare... didn&#39;t you?&quot; Kyle asks inquisitivly<br />
<br />
&quot;I DON&#39;T THINK YOU HAVE ANY ROOM TO SAY THAT CONSIDERING WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR CROTCH!!!&quot; Rose shouts, blushing and dreading what Kyle was thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax Rose! We just need to find the group and head back to school. Speaking of the group, do you know what way they went by any chance.&quot; Kyle pries as Rose&#39;s face drops.<br />
<br />
&quot;I lost track of them while I had to deal with my issue.&quot; Rose bluntly replied <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh great... Well do you atleast remember where we came from. For some reason I can&#39;t remember what way we came.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Neither can I. I guess we just have to make our own way back.&quot; Rose chirps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, let&#39;s just get a move on so we can change out of our soiled clothes.&quot; Kyle grumbles<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure you peeing stallion.&quot; Rose jokes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up shitting mare.&quot; Kyle retorts</p>
