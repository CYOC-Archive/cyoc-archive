<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Timmy Richards was floating, lost in darkness.  Her small female form drifted on the currents of unconsciousness, lulled by the rhythm of her own heartbeat, as peaceful as a baby in it’s mother’s womb dreaming of it’s emergence into the world.  Her thoughts were of her friends, of the times they had shared together, of her family and of the life that, while far from perfect, she cherished perhaps all the more for the vibrant unpredictability that came with it.<br />
<br />
She felt something hot on her cheek, a wetness that trickled down it.  Her eyelashes fluttered open and she was staring up into the eyes of a girl that she did not know, and yet somehow seemed as familiar to her as an old friend.  Soft brown hair framed a cutely rounded face with big soft eyes full of concern.  Behind her, Richards could see the now familiar female faces of Jones and Kim, looking anxiously down at her.  As Richard’s began to focus more, she realized the girl kneeling over her was crying, and that it was a tear from the girl she had felt on her cheek.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” The girl gasped happily, hugging Richard’s tightly to her, “You’re awake.  We were all so worried, Timmy!”<br />
<br />
As her breasts pressed against the girl’s own and she looked at the still obviously female forms of Jones and Kim standing behind the girl, still clad in the somewhat disheveled remains of their PE uniforms, her heart sank within her.  Tears of her own stung her eyes so that she barely registered that they were no longer in the boys’ locker room, but on a bridge over a river that she recognized as being near the school.  Her thoughts were on Simon, and the friend she had lost.<br />
<br />
“It didn’t work,” She murmured sadly as the girl released her from her embrace and helped her too her feet.  “We’re all still girls, and poor Simon…”<br />
<br />
To her surprise, both Kim and Jones had smiles on their faces, and the girl in front of her grinned broadly as she looked at her, the soft wind blowing in her long brown hair.  It took a moment more for Richards to understand, as she stared at the girl, and then, looking into eyes she had known all her life a happy little gasp escaped her.<br />
<br />
“Simon!” She cried, throwing herself into the arms of her now female friend again and hugging her tightly.  “You’re alive… I thought… I mean…”<br />
<br />
She trailed off as for a moment the two girls simply held each other, each happy to have found the friend they thought they had lost forever.  Behind them Jones giggled and could not suppress a happy little bounce, causing her unrestrained breasts to jiggle lightly beneath her top.  Kim simply stood there, a restrained but happy smile on her face as she watched her friends embrace.<br />
<br />
At length Richards pulled away from her friend to gaze in wonder at the girl that had so recently been a lust crazed muscular male giant of man.  The slim and athletic looking brunet girl bore scant resemblance either to the demon she had been sometime before, or to the timid and nerdy looking boy she had begun the day as.  Like the other three girls, Simon was now dressed in a PE uniform with her name stenciled across the front that showed off the now feminine swell of her buttocks and the small but firm breasts beneath her jersey.  Her long brown hair hung about her shoulders soft and full, and her features were those of a cute teenage girl, as healthy as her three friends.<br />
<br />
“What happened to you?” Asked Richards in puzzlement.  “How did we get out here, and what happened to the jocks?”<br />
<br />
“The jocks have returned to their former bodies,” Kim answered quietly, reaching up out of habit to adjust her now non-exist glasses.  “Everybody was knocked unconscious by the force of the energy Simon released, and when we awoke, they were still asleep.  The next class was coming so we grabbed some of Simon’s gym clothes (thank god for unisex PE uniforms) and managed to carry you out of there and off campus.”<br />
<br />
“I can just imagine what the coach must have thought when he saw all those naked jocks cuddled up to each other!” Jones put in with a giggle.  “It’s probably going to be the talk of the school for some time.”<br />
<br />
The four friends shared a good laugh thinking of the rumors that were now bound to be flying around the halls about the school’s football stars and their sexual proclivities.  It was some small comfort to the four girls that the bullies that had started the whole mess would receive some form of justice, perhaps less strenuous then was deserved but no the less satisfying to the girls’ young minds, who’s principle form of social justice lay with their peers and was often harsher and more swift in nature then any court could have been.<br />
<br />
“But what about us?” Questioned Richards looking down at her female body and those of her three friends.  “Why didn’t we change back with the others?  And why is Simon a girl now like the rest of us?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Jones said, shaking her head so that her short black hair whipped around her face a bit.  “This is beyond any known science, it’s energy was magic and from what little I know of such things it’s effects were bound to be unpredictable.  I suppose we were lucky, all things considered, it could have been far worse.”<br />
<br />
The four friends were silent for a moment, each girl lost in her own thoughts.  Suddenly Jones looked up to see a beautiful eagle soaring overhead and gave a happy little squeak of pleasure.  The three others watched with fond smiles as the girl hopped to the railing of the bridge, and happily pointed upwards, her troubles momentarily forgotten in the wonder of the beautiful bird soaring over them.<br />
<br />
“Can you…” Richards began hesitantly as the three others stood watching, “Can you cure us, Kim?” <br />
<br />
As Richard’s asked the question, her small hand had found it’s way into Simon’s and the two held to each other tightly.  The gesture was not lost on Kim, nor did she neglect to consider the happily bouncing Jones by the railing, whose former male body with it’s crippled leg would never have allowed her such freedom of movement.  Kim herself was luxuriating in the vibrant energy of her new form, and at the loss of her extreme and almost blinding near-sightedness, a condition the doctors had told her would only worsen, as she got older, and something she had kept even from her friends.<br />
<br />
Looking at the two girls before her, whose friendship was appeared to already be developing into the type of affection reserved for lovers, perhaps as a result of their new forms and their shared experiences, at Jones in her happy and healthy form and studying them all with her own newly restored vision, Kim hesitated.  Looking down at the gym bag she held containing the various products that had given them their new bodies she looked up to face her friends, tempted to tell them that it was completely impossible, knowing they would each have to make their own decision.<br />
<br />
“It’s not impossible,” She said carefully, adding honestly, “but it could also be very dangerous.  You saw what happened before, how close we, perhaps the whole world came to loosing ourselves.  I for one am willing to live with my new sex in order to enjoy the benefits of it offer health wise.  But I am willing to try to find a cure for the rest of you, if that’s what you want.  For me, given that my previous form would have been blind in perhaps another few years, the choice is obvious.”<br />
<br />
Kim nodded, pleased with her logic and looked at the other girls.  The possibility that they might be stuck in these forms forever was slowly beginning to dawn on all of them now.  Each girl looked at herself and her three companions thoughtfully as they pondered their decisions.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Piped up Jones in her sprite like new voice, “I’m willing to trade the joys of a penis for the chance to run and walk again like a normal boy… oh… girl now I guess.  I can’t believe I can run and jump so high now!”<br />
<br />
With a giggle the enthusiastic girl demonstrated by hopping nimbly from the railing of the bridge, doing a quick somersault with as graceful a motion as if she’d been doing it all her life, and ended with a neat little bow, before straightening with a happy smile and standing beside her friends.  Both Kim and Jones’ eyes were on the two remaining new girls as they looked at their friends, then at each other.<br />
<br />
“I think,” Said Simon at last after a bit of a pause, still looking into Richards’ eyes, “that I’m not willing to risk putting you all in danger again, not after what happened before.  I’m just happy that we all are together again, alive and safe.  If that means living as a girl, then so be it.”<br />
<br />
To punctuate her remarks, she gave Richards’ hand another gentle squeeze.  It was something they had often done as little boys, holding each other’s hands together to reassure each other in moments of fear or doubt.  The gentle intimacy had, of course dwindled as it became less socially acceptable through the years, and neither of the two former boys realized just how much it had meant and how much they had missed it until right now.  It hadn’t seemed right before somehow, but now it was, and that as much as anything was what caused Richards’ to nod her head in agreement with Simon as she returned her friend’s gentle squeeze to her hand with one of her own.<br />
<br />
“Nothing could be worth going through all that again,” Said Richards, adding with a bit of a blush to her cheeks that lit up her cute face, “besides I think I’ve gained more then I’ve lost today.”<br />
<br />
Kim stood quietly with her friends for a moment more, giving each girl a chance to voice any objections to remaining as they were. None of them did, and each met her eyes with a brave resolve written on their faces, fully recognizing the choice they had made, and what it entailed. <br />
<br />
Kim walked to the railing and held the gym bag out over the edge so that it was above the swirling deep waters below the bridge, looking back at her friends one last time, giving them a final chance to change their minds.  As one, the three girls nodded to her, giving her permission to do what they knew must be done, not only for themselves, but perhaps to save all of humankind from suffering the fate they had nearly been subject too, mindless worshiping slaves at the foot of a lust crazed monster.<br />
<br />
“One,” Said Kim, holding the bag out over the dark currents.<br />
<br />
Back in the locker room, the four boys belongings vanished from their lockers, and four new lockers appeared in the girls’ locker room, full of the possessions proper to four young girls in high school, while the four girl’s names were altered on records and four boys vanished without a trace from the minds and records of school and government files, as four new girl’s identities formed into existence.<br />
<br />
“Two…” Kim whispered, the four girls hardly seemed to notice as there appearances altered slightly, hair becoming styled, uniforms altering to fit properly their new bodies and bras and panties forming beneath them to replace their boys’ briefs and jock straps.  Make up formed on the girls’ features and their fingernails now bore polish.<br />
<br />
At the four girls’ homes, rooms were altering, memories shifting and soon every trance of the four boys they had been had been replaced in their homes, in the memories of family and friends.  For all intents and purposes, the four boys were no more, and the four girls they had become were now firmly rooted in the new reality being created for them.<br />
<br />
“Three…” Kim said, and blinked, trying to remember why she was counting.<br />
<br />
The three girls watching seemed to freeze for a moment, their minds were not drastically altered, simply changed here and there to fit the lives they now remembered living as four girls.  Kim stepped down from the rail, her hand empty as the bag simply shimmered out of existence, it’s purpose ended.<br />
<br />
The four girls looked at each other for a moment, unable to explain why they suddenly felt even closer to each other then they ever had before in a lifetime of friendship.  Somewhere over their heads, the eagle made a final pass, and then spread it’s wings and flapped it’s way out over the waters and to the treetops beyond.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Giggled Jones, looking upwards to wave goodbye to her new friend, her face full of a child’s wonder, “Its so beautiful!”<br />
<br />
“Yes…” Whispered the girl once known as Simon, now going by Samantha, “beautiful…”<br />
<br />
Her eyes were not on the eagle, but on the face of Tina Richards, her lifelong friend who she thought had never perhaps looked more beautiful then at this moment.  For her part, Tina looked down, blushing furiously as she saw Samantha’s gaze, but her look was one of joy and her heart beat a little faster with her happiness.<br />
<br />
“I think,” Said Jane Kim in her usual cool logical tone, “we should get back to school, before we’re caught.”<br />
<br />
The three other girls gave reluctant nods, and slowly turned away from the river and walked back to school beneath the shining sun that beamed down upon them, and into their new lives.  And if they were unaware of the changes in the world and in themselves, they were happier, healthier, and content, which was and is, perhaps, the best kind of transformation of all.</p>
