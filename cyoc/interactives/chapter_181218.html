<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Juliet didn&#39;t teach a large school. Each of her girls were educationally-impaired and required more personal attention than larger institutions would give them. Seven was enough for her and she had brought them all with her so they could become Animalians. Though part of her was wondering if it may have been a bad idea. Fifi and Mia&#39;s conversions had been a little too sexual for Juliet&#39;s concern and the two of them seemed rather eager for more. Josephine and Eloise&#39;s conversions were less sexual, but both of them were showing quite a bit of interest in wearing more revealing clothing.<br />
<br />
Juliet knew that Animalians have a higher libido. She herself had been feeling more frisky after her conversion. But she had a tight control over it. Her more simple-minded girls lacked the willpower to contain themselves. Or, as Juliet privately feared, they simply didn&#39;t want to contain themselves. Juliet was still a little miffed that her government wanted to include a strip club in the colony her family land will become. She had been raising these girls so that they would be able to function in society. Sure they may be a little slow on uptakes, but she didn&#39;t bring them here so they could be turned into furry bimbos for being ogled at. If Juliet can handle her Animalian libido, so can they. Even if Juliet&#39;s dreams have been more sexualized than before.<br />
<br />
She had a bit more hope for her remaining girls. Marie was a bit more introverted and meekly followed orders. It&#39;s not much of a surprise that she decided to become a sheep. Olympe was a bit on the homely side, being born with thick bones and a broad face. She was hoping becoming a horse might make her pretty enough. It was Gigi that gave Juliet the most concern. Gigi was the most energetic of her girls, often appearing scatterbrained. It wasn&#39;t much of a surprise that Gigi wanted to become a poodle. The bigger concern was that she wanted a similar conversion like Fifi and Mia. Fortunately, the young lady who would be Gigi&#39;s sponsor has more self-control than Ashley and Jennifer.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;You are sure you do not wish to be more involved in this?&quot; asked Juliet.<br />
<br />
&quot;As flattering as the offer is, I have a boyfriend,&quot; said Tiffany, &quot;And I know some Animalians are bi, but not me. I&#39;m just as straight as Princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet raised an eyebrow, &quot;Princess is a bit of an odd name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she was my dog before the Outbreak,&quot; said Tiffany, &quot;She converted me by accident not long after she was uplifted, but we&#39;ve been practically sisters ever since.&quot; Tiffany did consider Princess to be her sister by now, but she wasn&#39;t sure if it was completely official. Unlike Sarah&#39;s family, Tiffany&#39;s parents were still human and while Princess was considered family, Tiffany wasn&#39;t sure if her parents saw Princess as their daughter. But they were happy enough that it didn&#39;t need to be questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least not all the youth here have trouble controlling themselves,&quot; said Juliet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you can&#39;t really force someone to be something they&#39;re not,&quot; said Tiffany, &quot;Your girls seem to be very nice, but I don&#39;t think they want to be proper ladies. It&#39;s not like they can&#39;t better themselves, but shoehorning them isn&#39;t going to help. Repressing yourself is just going to make the pressure come out sooner than later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s generous advice, but I know my girls better than you,&quot; said Juliet, &quot;I didn&#39;t take them just to make whores of themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Princess sighed. She&#39;s meant plenty of preppy people in higher society who think it was a very small step to debase oneself. She admitted she was a bit like that herself before she became an Animalian. Juliet may be acting straitlaced now, but the thing about laces was the tighter they are, the louder they snap.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Gigi was a little disappointed that she didn&#39;t get to have as much fun with her transformation like Fifi and Mia did. Tiffany made it clear that while she was flattered by the attention, she wasn&#39;t the type of girl who was interested in other girls. But at least she provided the milk that Gigi wanted, though out of a glass rather than &#39;straight from the tap&#39;.<br />
<br />
Gigi was also surprised by how her transformation went. It wasn&#39;t becoming part-dog or getting very thick curves that surprised her. What came in thicker than her curves was her fur. She was so thickly covered with dense, black fur that she didn&#39;t even need clothes to hide her naughty parts. Gigi had expected to change to look like Tiffany. Tiffany had to explain to her that poodles&#39; fur doesn&#39;t grow in that particular way. Gigi was uncut and she&#39;d need trimming to look like Tiffany&#39;s style. Of course, Tiffany was willing to help with that trim later. Animalia&#39;s spa included a dog groomer for when she and Princess need to have a special day, which was pretty soon now.<br />
<br />
Though Gigi&#39;s fluff was nothing compared to Marie&#39;s. Like Gigi, Marie had grown a thick layer of wool, probably because the weather was still a little cool. It was thick enough that she too did not need clothes to cover herself up. Though she had a bit more to cover up, considering how large her breasts are now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I always thought you&#39;d make a cute lamb,&quot; said Gigi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t think I can really be called a lamb,&quot; said Marie as she hefted up her wool-covered breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that mostly wool?&quot; asked Gigi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all of it?&quot; asked Marie, &quot;Apparently this breed of sheep is bred for wool and milk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to remember that.&quot; Gigi and Marie turned to see Olympe. Unlike the other two, her fur wasn&#39;t thick enough to hide her naughty parts, so she was wearing a loose shirts and sweatpants. But those didn&#39;t do much to hide the incredible body she now had. Sure, they were expecting Olympe to be bigger when she became a horse Animalian, but not this big. What parts of her body weren&#39;t curvaeous were heavily-muscled and the two of them had to crane their heads up to look her in the face. &quot;We really should always remember what breed of Animalian we become. Like how I became a Percerhon,&quot; said Olympe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you mean like those jousting horses?&quot; asked Gigi, remembering some news about how they now worked to make armor for renaissance fairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you&#39;d be one of the smaller horses,&quot; said Marie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I always felt like I wasn&#39;t really living up to my name,&quot; said Olympe, &quot;I was just a dumpy girl, nothing special. I didn&#39;t even have the brains really make up for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I always thought you were one of the smartest,&quot; said Marie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still no genius,&quot; said Olympe, &quot;But at least now I do have the body of an Olympian. And I hope to prove it in the games.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there time for that?&quot; asked Gigi.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are still late entries,&quot; said Olympe, &quot;But I don&#39;t need to be the best. I just need to do as good as the humans.&quot;</p>
