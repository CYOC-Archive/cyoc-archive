<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Coming home from working a shift at the emergency room of the hospital, Allison was looking exhausted. Twelve hours on call and the only exciting thing to happen was an Antelope fury coming in needing a doctor to remove something lodged in his rectum. The procedure was more embarrassing for him then it was for Allison who assisted the doctor; she wasn’t a stranger to kinky sex toys. She and Brittany did have some thrilling girl on girl action in the past; however such carnal delights have not been toyed with since becoming a mother. So when the anthro cougar fury stepped through the front door, she was instantly assailed with the unpleasant stench of ammonia and cat litter.<br />
<br />
“Jimmy Michael Edward Prouhoof J.R. you better have that litter cleaned before your father comes home or there will be hell to pay,” Allison using her son’s full name; a tactic all mother’s utilize to scare and shame their cubs to stop doing or getting something done.<br />
“I already did that,” Jimmy answering as he sits on the floor of the living room; watching television with his cat dickens purring as he snuggles on the boys lap. Jimmy J.R an anthro cougar fury who’s fur was a lighter shade of the tawny brown as his father and with pink paw pads on his hand and feet paws.<br />
“Well check again,” Allison turning of the t.v with her magic runes; a trick she learned years ago and uses it frequently when the certain men in her life need encouraging to get up and do something. “And was dad home when you got home from school?”<br />
“He was waiting for me before he left. Been alone with Dickens since,” Jimmy grumbling as he gets up. Taking care too gently move Dickens off of his lap; the young furry cub roughly six years old stretches and ambles to the washroom in which the cat’s litter box is in. Seeing nothing but fresh litter, Jimmy checks the nearby trash bin and sees he dumped his cat’s treasures in the bin without emptying it. “I guess this one is my fault,” Jimmy muttering as Dickens nuzzles and snakes around the cougar fury’s legs. Tying up the trash and then spraying the room with an air freshener that was less offensive to a furies nose than used kitty litter.<br />
<br />
“I still think you should be with your grandparents after you get home from school,” Allison sighing. &quot;What were you watching,” Allison asking as her son walks to the garage to toss a bag into the garbage bin. “Was it at least educational?” Allison didn’t mind her son turning on the television when he got home from school; what she didn’t want was for him to watch the more adult oriented programing that is now prevalent thanks to furies not having shame in others watching them rut or watching others rut. Because of this, cities and town across the U.S.A enacted local ordinances outlawing carnal acts of pleasure in public spaces frequented by children. This meant parks schools, shopping centres and other public places that families would typically congregate. However there were designated woodlands and camping sites that did allow furies to indulge in outdoor romps.<br />
<br />
“I was watching an old cartoon,” Jimmy entering the kitchen; Dickens following close behind and purring loudly as hanging near his food dish. “It was about this group of humans,” Jimmy finding it hard to believe such creatures existed; “with a large dog.”<br />
“Solving mysteries while riding around in an ugly green van,” Allison nodding; “I know of that cartoon and it’s as old as your grandparents. If not possibly older,” Allison chuckling as she opened up a cupboard to grab cat treats. “Now give these to Dickens before he drives me batty as I prepare some supper.”<br />
<br />
With Dickens given his treats and Jimmy J.R back to watching his cartoon, Allison began to whip up a simple chicken Caesar salad. Opening the fridge she smiled as she noticed a pre-made dish waiting for her and Jimmy. Along with it was a note from Jimmy S.R.<br />
“Just reheat and serve. Your loving rutting buck;” Allison giggling as she took the plates out and microwaved them each. “Someone is getting a good rut tonight,” Allison rumbling as she watches the plates of pirogi with bacon and fried onions spin in the microwave. The smell of bacon sizzling after coming out of the microwaved filled the kitchen with an enticing aroma that even the cat devouring his treats stopped to try and beg for a piece.<br />
“No bacon for kitty,” Allison lightly growling as she placed the plates on the table. “Come get some supper Jimmy,” Allison speaking as she grabs the sour cream and a jar of sauerkraut from the fridge.<br />
<br />
“So Dusk and Dawn got in trouble at school again today,” Jimmy piling the sauerkraut on top of the pierogis; “they tried to play a prank on the janitor only to get caught red pawed by the gym teacher.”<br />
“Isn’t that the third time this month,” Allison shaking her head at the antics of her niece and nephew; “what did they try to do this time?”<br />
“They thought they could blow up a garbage can with baking soda and vinegar,” Jimmy giggling; “they just ended up making a mess.”<br />
“Hope they had to clean it up,” Allison rolling her eyes; thinking of having a call with Brittany later to talk about the latest gossip. “I imagine Brittany and Jake were not thrilled with yet another phone call from the principal.”<br />
“You’d have to ask them,” Jimmy shoveling a forkful of pierogi with pickled cabbage into his feline muzzle; “this happened during lunch period.”<br />
<br />
The remainder of dinner time was used talking about what Jimmy learned at school and if he had any homework to do. Allison perked up some when her son talked about the hour regarding biology. Interrupting to ask probing question as to what type of biology he was referring to. She was mildly stunned to hear that school was teaching her young cub regarding the differences between a male and a female fury. She knew such conversations were inevitable to happen but was hoping that those topics wouldn’t need to be broached until he was nearing the age that of a teenager. She was mildly relieved that the discussions were just focused on anatomical differences and not about sex for the purpose of pleasure or for reproduction.<br />
<br />
“When will dad be home,” Jimmy watching as his mother takes his plate now that he was finished eating and places it into the dishwasher.<br />
“Not until you are well and truly in bed,” Allison answering; “the restaurant can get busy and your father has to help manage it as well as assist behind the bar.”<br />
“You think dad and uncle Jake are arguing right now,” Jimmy asking as Dickens decides to hop up on the table demanding attention.<br />
“Twin brothers will always bicker,” Allison answering; “doesn’t mean they despise each other. They just disagree on various issues. Now get your homework and will go over it for an hour and watch a movie together afterwards.”<br />
<br />
******************<br />
<br />
Later in the evening, Jimmy Proudhoof S.R. comes home after another raucous evening at Proudoof’s; his father’s restaurant that he helps run and manage. Seeing his mate sitting on the sofa with their son sleeping next to her, he quietly joins the two only to see that she was also sleeping and the credits for the movie they were watching scrolling on the screen. Turning off the Television causes Allison to wake up and notice her mate picking up their son who was still sleeping.<br />
“Busy day,” Allison yawning as she slowly gets up.<br />
“No busier than the previous,” Jimmy answering quietly as he walks upstairs; his hooves making a clicking sound on the hardwood flooring before silence as he steps onto the carpet. “Ever since dad hosted the police that day six years ago, the place has been a zoo of hungry furies wanting food, drinks and an after dinner romp. The first two we deliver gladly,” the anthro stag-deer placing his son on his bed; watching as the Siamese seal point cat hops up on the bed to join with the sleeping cougar cub. “The third request,” Jimmy S.R sighing; “is something we tell our patrons to keep at home or in the woods. How was your day?”<br />
<br />
Allison regales her mate the day she had at the E.R doing her best to describe some of the more juicy events without violating Hippa Privacy rules. She eventually discussed what their son mentioned at school. First their niece and nephew getting in trouble with another of their pranks, followed by being taught the biological differences between male and female furies.<br />
“Yeah Jake wasn’t exactly in a good mood,” Jimmy chuckling; “He told me about what those two tried to do today. Dusk and Dawn now need to spend the next two week in detention helping the janitor or be given two weeks of in school suspension.”<br />
 <br />
Allison giggled at the choices the two had to pick from; happy that their cub wasn’t a trouble making imp like his cousins were. She embraced her mate as they made their way to the master bedroom. Running her hand paws up and down his body; feeling every muscle behind his short course fur, her paws trailing down to his groin. She rumbles in approval as her prize starts to stiffen and grow out of its fury sheath.<br />
“Oh happy rod,” Allison crouching down to run her rough tongue over the cervine shaft; “such a thick rod.”<br />
“Mounted or muzzle to muzzle,” was Jimmy S.R’s only response as he felt Allison suck and tickle his shaft. He watches as she maneuvers to the bed. Lying down spread eagle, giving her mate a good view of her swollen feline entrance glistening with her sexual juices.<br />
“Asked and answered,” the anthro stag-deer grinning; climbing onto the bed. He gives Allison a quick probing with his tongue; eliciting moans and micro-spasms as her body shudders from the stimulation. Crawling up her further, Jimmy dances his tongue around each erect nipple peeking through Allison’s tawny fur covering her breasts that defy gravity thanks to muscles at the base of the breasts that support the milk producing mammaries. Enveloping a nipple with his muzzle he gently nibbles and sucks on the nipple and is rewarded with a squirt of her milk.<br />
<br />
“Your still producing,” Jimmy letting his latch go. Swallowing the small amount of milk, as he positions his shaft at his mate’s entrance. He smiles as he watches Allison’s give out a surprised shudder as he penetrates and spread her folds with his thick member. His gyrating and thrusting kept her from remaining silent as his shaft hit all of her sensitive spots deep in her. Her panting getting heavier as she feels him picking up steam. She instinctively wraps her legs around Jimmy as she could feel her orgasm building. Panting and moaning, she tries to muzzle her joyous release so not to wake their son but fails as she whimpers loudly upon feeling her mate’s shaft twitch and pump his warm gooey seed deep within her.<br />
<br />
“Did you put up a soundproof bubble,” Allison sighing as Jimmy rolls off of her; the feeling of his still hard shaft slipping out of her tunnel caused another shudder and a mixture of his and her fluid to leak out.<br />
“Did that the moment you started feeling me up,” Jimmy repositioning himself to spoon Allison from behind. “Don’t want another embarrassing moment of our son walking in as we are in mid rut.”<br />
“It certainly killed the mood when that happened,” Allison chuckling as she remembered the night a few month ago were she had a mild panic. Thinking she was in heat as she kept trying to grind her crotch to Jimmy’s; the noises she made waking their son up late into the evening an feeling embarrassed and full of shame for the first time becoming furies. Trying to explain to Jimmy J.R. that were giving each other special hugs that mommies and daddies give each other, doing their best to dance around the subject as they felt it was too early to give him the talk regarding sex. After that night they did their best to be quiet, which wasn’t easy and to use magic to put up a bubble to block the sounds they made during sex.<br />
<br />
“You ever think about having another cub,” Jimmy running a hoof hand over Allison’s toned belly; admiring the pregnancy weight she gained when growing their son now gone.<br />
“Sometimes,” Allison sighing; “but my mom and dad have a cub, your father and Denise have a cub of their own. They have little time to help with babysitting and I don’t want to badger them.”<br />
“So we wait until our siblings are older before we fully commit,” Jimmy kissing Allison from behind; “we can still have fun in the meantime.”<br />
“Speaking of fun,” Allison placing a paw over her mates hoof on her belly; “it’s been a long time since Brittany and I had some fun. You think you and Jake could take the cubs out to the movies or a late swim at the rec center while we girls have some alone time?”<br />
“If you two want to sixty nine each other,” Jimmy feeling horny as his flaccid shaft starts to get hard; “it’s only fair that Jake and I get to watch.”<br />
“But who will watch the cubs,” Allison feeling Jimmy’s shaft poking her rear end; “more so as summer holidays are about to begin.”<br />
“You ever thought about sending Jimmy J.R to summer camp,” the anthro stag-deer fury musing; “three to four weeks where he is off learning to rough it while we have a time to relax and have fun.”<br />
“Oh,” Allison purring; “now that’s an ideal. And since I can feel you are ready for a second round,” Allison turning around with a predatory smile; “it’s my turn to be on top.”</p>
