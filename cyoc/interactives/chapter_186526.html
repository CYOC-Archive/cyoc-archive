<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They decided on another drive, this time a loop around the eastern side of the island. They figured there would be plenty isolated beaches and trails where they could find themselves alone.<br />
<br />
Henry fetched the corset he had worn the previous day &quot;Would you like me to help you put this on?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually I have another idea. Since I look pregnant anyway, I&#39;m going to wear this&quot; She held up the maternity dress she had bought earlier on the trip. &quot;I&#39;ll see how it looks anyway&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I was so looking forward to tightening that corset on you. When can I get my revenge?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When this is all over I&#39;ll wear a corset for you, however if you want to wear it again you are welcome&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way. I feel humiliated enough about last night as it is. I would die if anyone else ever found out. Promise you will never tell a soul. I&#39;m going to go with my jacket again&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You found it so hot yesterday. Are you sure? It&#39;s meant to be even hotter today&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll wear it when we are in sight of other people. If we can find somewhere where we are alone I&#39;ll take the jacket off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you have to wear a bra. Could I suggest my white cotton shirt. It&#39;s long sleeved and it breathes really well&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;ve had enough of wearing your clothes. Can&#39;t I bind myself so my chest is flat. Do we have any bandages or anything like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You mean bind yourself up like a mummy?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll cook, Besides we don&#39;t have bandages. The corset would be your only option. I imagine I could bind your chest but I don&#39;t think you would be very comfortable&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s give it a try&quot; Henry insisted<br />
<br />
They did Alicia positioned the corset over Henry&#39;s chest then strategically tightened only the section over his breasts so that they were squashed flat. &quot;Tighten it just a bit more so I don&#39;t bounce&quot; Henry asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dammit!&quot; It was hurting but Henry didn&#39;t want to admit it. &quot;Just do as I ask&quot;<br />
<br />
Alicia didn&#39;t appreciate Henry&#39;s abruptness. She pulled the laces extra tight. &quot;There! Are you happy now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes that will do&quot; Henry tried not to grimace. It was not comfortable at all.<br />
<br />
He now had to wear a denim shirt, it was his only shirt with thick enough material to hide the lines created by the corset from any sort of scrutiny. With his jacket over the top of that he thought he almost looked normal. He certainly didn&#39;t bounce at all. He also wore long jeans rather than shorts. He had decided it wasn&#39;t manly to have shaved legs and today he wanted to look as manly as he could.<br />
<br />
Alicia was happy enough with the maternity dress. It was relatively dowdy being pale blue and with loose long sleeves but at least it was cotton. &quot;What do you think? I saying about 7 months&quot; She was referring to the size of her belly. All she got in reply was a grunt. &quot;You&#39;re just being stubborn with misplaced male pride. I can tell it hurts. I&#39;m going to pack that bra and shirt and even the wig just in case you see sense&quot;<br />
<br />
They set off. Henry didn&#39;t need to hurry to the car. He walked slowly. In fact he could only walk slowly as his chest was so restricted. It was difficult to breathe.<br />
<br />
The drove. Their first planned stop was the Koko head crater. However although Alicia was keen to do the hike to the summit, Henry wasn&#39;t. He knew it would be agony to walk up that trail, however his reason for not going was &quot;If you were really seven months pregnant you wouldn&#39;t be doing that walk. We had better not&quot;<br />
<br />
Not much further they stopped at a blowhole. Alicia made the short walk but Henry decided to just sit in the car &quot;I&#39;ve seen plenty of blowholes&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry did get out of the car at Waimanalo beach but when Alicia suggested a walk to the head land Henry said &quot;It&#39;s too far and too hot&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only because you are crazily over dressed. I&#39;m going to dip my toes in the water anyway&quot; She did while Henry returned to the car.<br />
<br />
At Kanehoe, Alicia suggested an ice-cream stop. Henry stayed in the car complaining it was too hot outside.<br />
<br />
At He&#39;eia, Alison wanted to walk around the headland. Henry at least got out of the car. He took a seat in the shade and waited there while Alicia did the circuit.<br />
<br />
At Kahana bay. Alicia suggested a walk along the beach. Henry had gone 100 yards then turned around saying &quot;It&#39;s too hot&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only because you are wearing stupid clothes. I&#39;m very comfortable&quot; She stormed off and walked to the end of the beach by herself.<br />
<br />
Henry was back in the car by the time she returned. &quot;This is crazy Henry. If you are just going to sit in the car we may as well go back to our room&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s too hot&quot; he repeated his complaint.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not too hot at all. I&#39;m very comfortable&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My chest hurts&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only because you insist on torturing yourself. If you are only going to sit in the car you may as well make yourself comfortable. Let me get that corset off you&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry could see the sense in what Alicia was saying. He conceded defeat &quot;Yeah I&#39;m being stupid. Take it off me&quot;<br />
<br />
It was an enormous relief when his breasts were released. &quot;Look how red they are&quot; commented Alicia &quot;You have probably permanently damaged them. Just as well you only have them for a few days. I&#39;ll get you my aloe vera cream. It should soothe them&quot;<br />
<br />
She passed Henry her cream &quot;That actually feels nice&quot; he said as he gently rubbed it on<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I suggest you put these on&quot; she was holding out the white bra and shirt she had packed just for this eventuality. &quot;I know it goes against your male pride but you have breasts and I know how to care for breasts. This is a very comfortable bra&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s lacy&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And so is the shirt. But it&#39;s comfortable to wear on a hot day. The lace allows good air circulation&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll look like a girl again&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes. You will look like a girl. You have breasts. Most people with breasts are girls so people who see your breasts will think you are a girl. At least you will be comfortable&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could I have your sunglasses again?&quot; Henry accepted the bra and shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. And I have also bought the wig if you want it&quot; Alicia helped Henry put the bra on.<br />
<br />
Further on at a town called Laie, Alicia spotted an outdoor market and asked Henry to stop. Henry put the wig on but stayed in the car. Alicia inspected the stalls and got to chatting with a woman selling Hawaiian style dresses. &quot;Hi there. How long do you have to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;7 months&quot; answered Alicia<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to see my maternity collection. All made locally and not expensive&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Alicia answered. 5 minutes later she returned to the car the owner of a floral print maternity dress. Alicia thought it much prettier then the rather dowdy dress she had on. &quot;Find me some toilets and I&#39;ll change into this&quot; she showed the dress to Henry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you think that was a bit of a waste of money? You only have that stomach for today&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No it&#39;s not a waste of money. It&#39;s pretty. I&#39;ll be able to wear it when I&#39;m home. Who knows maybe I&#39;ll need it one day&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were on the pill&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am. I&#39;m not talking soon, but down the track I do want a baby. Maybe in a few years. Mum warned me not to leave it too long&quot;<br />
 <br />
They drove on until the found an amenities block by a beach. They were the only car there and no-one else was in sight. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is a pretty beach&quot; said Alicia. &quot;Would you like to walk to the headland? No-one else is here&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I need a leak. I&#39;ll get out of the car anyway&quot; He was once more fitting the wig on his head.<br />
<br />
Alicia changed into the new dress. She liked that it was sleeveless. It was pretty. <br />
<br />
Henry was waiting for her outside &quot;I probably should have gone into the ladies with you since I look like this. Just as well no-one else is around&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you game for that walk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so. Now I regret not wearing shorts. It would be nice to walk in the shallows. But I don&#39;t want my jeans getting wet&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you could wear this&quot; she held up the light blue dress she had in her hand. <br />
<br />
Henry thought about it. He figured the dress was no more feminine than the lacy top he was wearing. It would allow him to walk in the shallows. There was some reluctance though. He was uneasy about wearing a dress. The one and only time he had worn a dress was the other day when Alicia had him try on her golf skirt, that had been in the privacy of their room. Now he was somewhere where he could be observed. But what the heck. He was already wearing a bra and a feminine wig. &quot;Yeah Okay&quot; He followed Alicia into the ladies.<br />
<br />
10 minutes later a ranger came to check the amenities block. There was only one car there. He could see two women walking in the shallows they they were splashing each other and apparently having fun. He called out anyhow before entering the ladies to collect any trash. No one was in there.</p>
