<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon continued to sit peacefully on the rock until he felt something move in the water not too far away from him.<br />
<br />
The merman opened his eyes to see splashing moving towards the edge of the lake. Damon thought he was in the presence of another merperson or a strong aquatic animate until he saw a figure come from the water.<br />
<br />
It was a woman, and a nice looking one at that. The woman wore a red swim one-piece swimsuit, a pair of swimming goggles, and a cap that seemed to cover her hair. Even with the woman wearing a rather conservative swimsuit, Damon could tell she was fit and athletic just from the gear she had and the fast speed of her swimming. <br />
<br />
The woman stood up on the lakefront’s grassy field and took off her swim cap - revealing long blonde hair that covered up to the woman’s waist. The lady’s hair looked lovely to Damon, she enjoyed how the hair beamed the woman’s head like a royal crown.<br />
<br />
Damon was sitting on the rock, intrigued by this mysterious woman. He seemed to feel something stirring in his tail when he saw the woman bending over and grabbing a bottle of water. Damon watched intently as the woman arched her back, brought her belly forwards, and brought the bottle to her mouth. <br />
<br />
Damon couldn’t explain why, but it was felt almost erotic seeing the woman’s throat move and pulse as she gulped the water - Maybe it was the sight of a woman being one with the water, or it likely the sight of the woman’s throat moving gave Damon signals that she was alive and well. <br />
<br />
The former prince felt as if he could watch her drink that bottle for eternity but the woman eventually closed the bottle and the woman’s eyes would later do something that would shock the merman - The woman was looking directly at Damon.<br />
<br />
Damon felt a shock move throughout his tail. By some instinct-driven miracle, Damon’s tail managed to straighten forward, making his tail look as if he had a pair of legs just inside. Damon looked at his tail, realizing that he now looked like a normal human being wearing a fish tail costume. Damon looked up from his tail notice the woman’s expression had changed.<br />
<br />
She had a smile.<br />
<br />
“Hi.” The woman spoke.<br />
<br />
“Hi, miss. You look very pretty.” Damon said.<br />
<br />
The woman looked at her body and chuckled. “Thank you! I worked hard for this body. Been swimming for as long as I can remember. My mom always joked I was born half fish…” The woman pointed at Damon’s tail. “But you seem to live up to it.” <br />
<br />
“Oh…” Damon said. “You mean this?” Damon questioned as he raised his tail. The woman nodded and Damon spoke again. “Do you like what you see?”<br />
<br />
The woman eagerly nodded again. “Oh yeah! It looks so real. I’ve never seen a guy wearing a mermaid tail costume in the open before. People always consider swimming a more feminine sport but I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.”<br />
<br />
Damon smirked confidently and stroked his tail in front of the woman. “Do you want to touch it?”<br />
<br />
The woman paused for a bit, but then took a couple steps forward the merman. “Yeah. I would love to know how you made it. It looks so comfortable.”<br />
<br />
Damon stroked his fishy lower body. “It is a very nice fish tail.” Damon looked back at the woman. “What’s your name?”<br />
<br />
The woman pointed to herself and replied confidently. “I’m Katie. Katie Waters. Swim champion of my high school and team captain of my university swim team.” <br />
<br />
Damon smiled at that. Katie seemed really proud of herself. The merman’s genuinely impressed that she accomplished so much and she’s about his age as well. “That’s amazing. I’m Damon. You really seem to be one with the water, aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
Katie giggled. “I am. I love how calm and beautiful the sea is. I swim in competitions to pay the bills, but they aren’t why I swim. I swim because I just feel… A bond with the water, you know?”<br />
<br />
Damon nodded. “I know. I honestly didn’t feel that much for the sea until recently and got this tail.” He replied, somewhat covering up his true form and origins to the girl.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled. “That’s wonderful to hear. No guy I’ve met before has ever expressed this amount of passion for the sea as much as I do.” Katie’s expression soon turned to a frown as she looked down at her feet. “To be honest, I don’t think even girls feel much for the water as much as I do. People around me look at it like it’s a sport, while I think it’s more than that. Much more. I don’t know how else to say it but... Water is my life.” Katie looked up to Damon. “Do you think I’m weird?”<br />
<br />
Damon shook his head. “No, you’re not weird, Katie. You’re amazing.”<br />
<br />
Katie blushed and held her hands in her cheeks. She never felt like this before. Ever since she was a baby, she had always loved the water so much that she never knew what it was like to feel for someone else besides her family.  <br />
<br />
She was always isolated from her peers, she knew that she expressed how passionate she was about water, she would be laughed at. It was thanks to her swimming ability that her average grades gave her hefty scholarships and a promising career in swimming that seemed to bloom, but that feeling of not having someone to share her passions with was always at the back of her mind. <br />
<br />
Damon could tell this girl was feeling things she hadn&#39;t felt before. “Do you want to sit next to me Katie?” Damon lifted himself up and patted the empty space next to him. “We can talk about how much the sea means to us. Just you and me. Nobody else will get to hear it.”<br />
<br />
Katie walked forward, dipping her feet in the cool water. “Are you sure?” <br />
<br />
“I know you love the sea. So do I. The water here is beautiful, be next to me, Katie. Be my mermaid.” Damon cooed.<br />
<br />
Katie picked up her pace. “You won’t hurt me?”<br />
<br />
“No, Katie. You’re as beautiful as the lake around us. I would be honored to have you by my side. I like you, Katie. I really… Really like you.” Damon said.<br />
<br />
“Me, too, Damon.” Katie ran to the rock. “Ready or not, here I come!”<br />
<br />
Katie jumped and kissed Damon on the lips as she landed right next to him on the rock, creating a nice comfortable landing for herself. “How did I do?” Katie asked.<br />
<br />
“Wonderful,” Damon said. “I’m glad you’re with me, but…” Damon’s voice trailed off.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong, Damon?” Katie said sympathetically. <br />
<br />
“You know this fish tail I’m wearing?” Damon questioned. Katie nodded. “It’s… Not really a costume. It’s real.”<br />
<br />
Katie giggled. “C’ mon Damon. You really thought I could fall for that? Mermen aren’t re-” Katie was interrupted by the feeling of something wet and slimy lightly slapping her foot. <br />
<br />
The girl looked down to see that the sides of Damon’s torso and his tail had gills, pulsing gills. Katie looked up at Damon and saw gills on his neck too. <br />
<br />
Katie’s eyes widened as she felt the gills on his neck. “It’s not real. You can’t be...”<br />
<br />
Damon held Katie&#39;s hand. “Look down…”<br />
<br />
Katie could feel the wet slimy slapping again, but this time she couldn’t feel her feet or toes. Katie looked down and gasped at what she saw.<br />
<br />
It was Damon’s slimy tailfins slapping against her feet… Or what was left of them as her feet were extending outwards and fanning out to be light red tail fins. She was easily able to recognize that her tail fins were once her feet because her right tail fin had a small red heart-shaped birthmark that she once had on her right foot. Katie looked around to see that the rest Damon’s tail was actually quite slimy as well, but it didn’t have an odor or such, in fact…<br />
<br />
Katie touched some of Damon’s tail, lifted her hand up and closed her eyes. It smelled… Really nice. It had a pleasant scent that reminded her of going to the beach with her mother. She opened her eyes to see that her hands were now webbed. She looked up at Damon. <br />
<br />
“You planned this, didn’t you?”, Katie questioned.<br />
<br />
“To be honest, not really. I was turned into a merman by a potion. I think the kiss mixed your human DNA with my merman DNA while the slime is making your transformation faster.” Damon replied.<br />
<br />
Katie blushed. “Oops…”<br />
<br />
Katie looked down to see that her swimsuit was perfectly cut in half. The top half remained intact and covered her breasts like a bikini top, even though her breasts have grown a little bit. She couldn’t say the same about the bottom half,  it was completely shredded. <br />
<br />
Katie looked down at her body to see her white skin smoothly transition into rose-red scales. The scales looked lovely and perfectly contrasted with Damon’s blue scales. At the very end of her tail were her tail fins, slapping against Damon’s. <br />
<br />
For a while, the two were in silence. With only the splat noises of their tail fins slapping each other to stimulate their ears. Neither of them wanted to admit how awed they were both awed by Katie’s fast transformation into a mermaid. But Damon was willing to break the silence.<br />
<br />
“You know when I told you to be my mermaid… I didn’t expect it to be so literal.<br />
<br />
Katie let out a laugh, causing her breasts to jiggle slightly and her hair to cover part of her face. The new mermaid let out a sigh and spoke. “You know… It’s poetic. A young shy girl who loves the ocean finds the love of her life and becomes a mermaid. So simple, yet so quaint.” Katie hugged Damon. “Thank you so much for this, Damon. You have no idea how much this means to me.”<br />
<br />
Damon returned the hug. “You’re welcome.” Damon kissed Katie&#39;s lips and the two rolled from the rock and into the ocean.</p>
