<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Most potions seemed very tempting to you but the one offering beauty was most so. To be beautiful, a chick magnet... A hero with an enormous sex appeal was sure to triumph, no matter what the outcome was! Whatever occurred, girls would still praise and love him. In case the hero thing didn&#39;t work out, being a success with the ladies would not be a bad second option. Not bad at all! <br />
<br />
You agreed to the nectar and the elf offered the vial with a kind smile. The liquid was pink, like guava juice. <br />
&quot;It is a fine choice,&quot; the elf said. &quot;Beauty is held as vanity but can attract to worthy causes and unimaginable happiness. Be careful, though. It can be a blessing as much as a curse. Don&#39;t lose yourself in the pool of your own good looks.&quot;<br />
Struck by another thought, he added:<br />
&quot;I do think you already are a handsome human, though. So perhaps the potion won&#39;t alter you much.&quot;<br />
You had already drank all of the vial by that time. It tasted delicious, a mixture of peach and lychee. However, you were instantly overcome by a feeling of drowsiness. A pleasant one, but you lied down. <br />
&quot;It is magic. It can be unpredictable. I hope your beauty pleases you and those around you.&quot;<br />
You wanted to mumble your thanks and a demand for more explanations but darkness clouded your eyes and brain.   <br />
<br />
When you woke up, you could hear birds happily chattering and the wind in leaves. You were lying on soft grass that smelled of summer and bucolic days. The air around you was rife with the sweet perfume of flowers. A stream gurgled nearby. Frogs and cicadas sang happily. You could feel your skin being sun-kissed delightfully. As you opened your eyes, you saw you were showered by flower petals and that the sight of a beautiful glen greeted your eyes. It was a true countryside paradise. Stones sculptures decorated this garden that seemed to have no end. You rose slowly, delighted by this nature so bountiful and generous. You were struck by the desire to roll in the grass, dance and laugh. It seemed like a strange but very good idea. But first you wanted to look at yourself. See if your appearance had changed. You walked tentatively to the stream. You could gaze upon your reflection there. Except things felt strange. Your balance felt oddly misplaced but you couldn&#39;t change it either. And you were wearing a sort of white tunic you had never owned before. And... Your feet! Your legs! Your arms! When did they get so white, skinny and hairless? And what was that on your shoulder? Hair? When did you let your hair grow? Since when was it so curly and blond? You rushed to the stream to assess the damage and only utter surprise kept you from screaming at the top of your lungs and disturb all the animals in the vicinity. <br />
You were a girl! Barely reaching her 20th birthday, certainly, with a heart-shaped face, tiny nose, flawless skin, startling blue eyes and a very soft skin, but a girl nonetheless! Panicked in your wounded pride, you checked under your tunic. Perfect little round breasts and down there, what you had only seen in pornographic periodicals. No more manhood whatsoever! You grappled with that fact. It was not possible! There must have been a mistake! The elf had promised... And then you understood. The potion had guaranteed beauty but had held no precision on beautiful in whose opinion or for who specifically, or what sort of beauty for which gender. You groaned. Yes, you were gorgeous, no question about it, but what use was it to you, a male? You could hardly have fun with it or see it from the outside of your own body. And what would you do with male admiration? You wanted girls, not guys! And how could you live as a girl? You had no idea how to be a girl! <br />
As you  contemplated your reflection, that of a girl you would have loved to date, you looked at your body more. You were a little short, but very youthful-looking, with a waist to die for and the roundest, perkiest buttocks you had ever laid eyes on. All this only added to your extreme unease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot;<br />
You turned around, startled. Two men had appeared, accompanied. by a big hound. Well, men... So to speak. One had a thick beard, a horse tail and donkey ears. The other had the horns, ears and lower body of a goat. Satyrs! Wait... Wasn&#39;t it bad news for girls to meet these things? You were struck by fear, ready to bolt, and it must have showed.<br />
&quot;Admiring yourself, sweet lady? Nothing to be ashamed of,&quot; said the goat satyr with a wide smile.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s normal to be vain, a gorgeous little nymph like you,&quot; added the horse-donkey one.<br />
&quot;I... I&#39;m not...&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, listen to that! Even her voice is gorgeous!&quot; exclaimed the horse-donkey satyr.<br />
&quot;Truly. A real peal of delicate bells. I&#39;m sure you sing like the choirs of Olympus themselves,&quot; said his companion to the nymph you now were.<br />
And you had to agree. Your voice did sound positively enchanting. But enough of that! You had to run, not fall for flattery from these two lecherous males! Except they seemed to have guessed what you were dying to do.<br />
&quot;Now, now. No running. You wouldn&#39;t want Oakion to turn you into a bush or plant, would you?&quot; warned the donkey satyr.<br />
You stopped. That sounded horrible!<br />
&quot;No! Who is Oakius?&quot;<br />
&quot;The master of this enchanted glen, of course,&quot; said the donkey satyr. &quot;Descendant of Pan, Dionysus and Silenus. Our lord and master in revelry in this region of eternal fun and drink.&quot;<br />
This could go really bad, so you decided to simply come clean. Hopefully, they&#39;d be disgusted at the idea of a man in a woman&#39;s body. Anyone would, right? Even satyrs. So you told the truth. This lead the two satyrs to whisper between themselves and dart glances at you. You prayed you would get off fast and easy. Alas, it wasn&#39;t the case.<br />
&quot;You seem more like you hurt your head, gorgeous darling. Or drank too much&quot; the goat satyr said.<br />
&quot;Then you should come with us see Oakius. He will help you in your slight madness. We would have taken you to him first at any rate,&quot; said the other. &quot;You have the cutest, perkiest little behind anyone would stare at.&quot;<br />
You stepped back, but the donkey satyr caught you and roped a lead around your arms and waist. Struggle as you might, you were lead forcefully deeper into the forest and even through little fields. As time wore on, you just followed meekly. Resisting just led to scrapes and a tighter rope. As you observed the beautiful nature around you, you were struck by the desire to create wreaths of flowers, bake delicious cakes and create wonderful alcoholic juices. You shook your head, trying to get rid of these unwelcome thoughts. It was not the time! And since when were you interested in such stupid activities?<br />
<br />
Eventually, you reached a very large clearing with delicate stone and wooden houses, music, garlands, fires, delicious roasting meat, tables laden with delicacies, fountains and wine galore. Animals, women and satyrs frolicked and set up for a night of partying and fun with smiles and energy. All stared as you and your unwelcome party arrived in the village. Whispers were heard and you caught people wondering who you were, on your amazing good looks and above all your butt. The general opinion was how good and round it looked. One satyr commented on how he&#39;d like to kiss and treat your boobs like the two treasures they were. Finally, you were led to a large stone temple. Doubtless Oakius&#39; abode. <br />
And indeed he was there, on a stone throne with pelts. surriounded by bowls of delicacies and even flutes of drinks. Oakius sported enormons ram horns, but a clean pelt on his lower half and sshiny hooves. He was a tiny bit chubby but obviously he countered that with a lot of dancing. And more than probably sex. His hair was dark blonde and slight beard and his animal hair a little darker. His eyes were the color of frozen water in winter. He looked at the new arrival with a raised eyebrow but broke into a wide smile, his eyes immediately shining with interest, glee and more worryingly, lust. <br />
&quot;And who is this most gorgeous beauty that have never had the delight of knowing?&quot; he said politely.<br />
The two satyrs launched into an explanation of how they had found you in the woods. You had to act before that Oakius got any raunchy thoughts into his head!<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a man! A man! A dude! I swear!&quot; you scream in a last-ditch attempt to preserve your physical integrity.<br />
The donkey satyr groaned in annoyance and sharply pulled the rope binding you, sending you on your knees to the stone floor. He then apologized to his leader, explaining you had a muddled mind but that it was obviously your only flaw. Oakius chided lightly his underling and crossed the carpets to you. He examined you.<br />
&quot;If you bore any of the magic of an Olympian god or powerful creature, I would believe you. But I detect none of that upon your frame. I am thus forced to conclude that you simply hit your head or something of the sort.&quot;<br />
&quot;No!&quot; you insist desperately. &quot;I was a man and I drank a potion offering to give me beauty offered by an elf and I woke up here like this! I swear!&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s an elf?&quot; asked the goat satyr.<br />
&quot;I have no idea. But it is further proof this delicate creature must have suffered an accident affecting her poor mind. She imagined an amusing little story to explain her incredible good looks. A way to make sense of them. Her own beauty flustered her. Beauty can be such a curse.&quot;<br />
He then turned to his friends.<br />
&quot;But luckily you brought her here so she can be properly looked after, sheltered, and nursed back to her mental health. I commend you for such generosity.&quot;<br />
You wanted to scoff. Yeah, right!<br />
&quot;You have earned flasks of my most luxurious brew and I shall make sure you get first pick of the next captives we rescue from slavers as soon as we cross them and do away with them.&quot;<br />
They smiled, but you weren&#39;t.<br />
&quot;Now, send to me my servants so they can help clean and relax that poor nymph that has had such an ordeal. She can then refresh herself and eat a fine meal in my company.&quot;<br />
So that jerk was going to keep you for himself under the guise of being a good host! It made want to gag. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, your protests were not to be heard. The servants came in fast and led you to a private lodge in the communal bathhouse. They were young women, nymphs like you, gushing at your good looks, at your luck to be with them and tutting at your &quot;silly stories&quot; of being a man. They washed you, laundered your tunic, offered you a new one, selected flowers and jewels for you. Make-up and perfume was artfully chosen and applied. But having beautiful women fussing over you and massage you and touch you did feel incredible... Alas, it had to end and too soon, as you were taken back to Oakius&#39; temple-palace, you noticed everyone partying and singing and dancing. All eyes turned to your superb figure. Oakius appeared and announced your arrival, to much applause, saying that he would personally make sure your integration amongst his people was done well. People laughed at that but he kissed you, winked at you and the crowd and everyone was amused at your lack of joy at the prospect, finding it immensely funny. He then asked his people to revel all they could, letting go of their inhibitions and restrictions. They all cheered and wished him a wonderful night. To you too, but you hated their enthusiasm at a situation you could do without. Oakius then took your arm and placed it upon his own, as if he was the perfect gentleman.<br />
&quot;Let us go, dearest.&quot;<br />
He then added with a not-too-subtle whisper:<br />
&quot;Before my loincloth is not enough to conceal my love for you.&quot;<br />
You cast a glance down amongst giggles and snickers from the crowd. Yew! That goat-man really did have an erection already! His bulge was impossible not to notice! And from the size, his penis must have been enormous! This had to be a nightmare! Before he entered his palace, Oakius seized you bridal-style and led you inside, amidst more encouragements from the crowd.<br />
<br />
Once in his private  chambers, Oakius deposited you on a massive wooden bed with sheets and a few pelts. One side had been arranged with soft pillows and fine sheets. That was where he laid you and you noticed how smooth the sheets and pillows were. Oakius saw your expression and smiled.<br />
&quot;Soft, aren&#39;t they? I knew a most beautiful creature like you would not do with simple pelts. I had this arranged for you. A much more sophisticated to consume our union, don&#39;t you think? A symbol of grace like you deserves no less.&quot;<br />
He then kissed you on the lips with passion. You gasped in surprise but your disgust did not deter him. Quite the opposite.<br />
&quot;So shy! So skittish! You really are a sight to behold! And those silly notions of yours! Quite endearing, I must say!&quot;<br />
He proceeded to feel your curves through your clothes, insisting on how beautiful you were and how much you smelled good. And of course how much you were going to appreciate the intercourse with him. He inhaled the smell of your neck and hair deeply, and even tickled your feet so that the surprise and gasp left the time for him to kiss you again. He wasn&#39;t ugly per se, it&#39;s just that as a male, not even homosexual, you felt not at all aroused by him. Alas, he was most aroused by you. He trailed his hands under your tunic to feel every curve and part of your chest. The flowers and jewels were soon on the floor and the tunic rejoined joined them.<br />
&quot;Your behind... The finest, roundest one ever... I am so lucky... This is the finest part of your already-impressive anatomy...&quot;<br />
As your back was to him, on all fours, he trailed something hard and flesh-like on your cheeks. Your eyes bulged at the implications. No! No, no, no!<br />
&quot;No! Please! Don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
&quot;Not to worry, dearest,&quot; he reassured you, trailing his fingers on your ass. &quot;There are other things to do before we can even think of that.&quot;<br />
He gently turned you over and you got a full view of his naked body. His chest was not as hairy as one would think but his erection! That thing was really massive! He was really hung like a donkey! No wonder his loincloth had bulged so! You could not take your eyes off it!<br />
&quot;Impressive, isn&#39;t it?&quot; he said with pride. &quot;My pride and joy. But don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll come to love it just as much too. And I&#39;ll be gentle. I know how to please ladies, all ladies.&quot;<br />
He took a swallow of a flute of what looked like champagne and proposed you some. You took a gulp, then of wine. Maybe your head buzzing would help. He then laid down on you and cupped and kiss your little breasts, then fondling your perk buttocks. He tried to reach the inside of your crotch but you flinched and retracted. You tried to tell him you&#39;re a man but he chuckled and kissed you more on the face, telling you to just relax, promising you enjoyment and all sorts of treats. And truth be told, he knew what to do. He reached for a little oil jar, and spread it on your genitalia, toying with your labia and clitoris. And... And... Oh, that felt so good! How could it be? Oakius smiled in triumph and his fingers deftly explored a part of your anatomy you yourself had never been acquainted with. Soon you reached your climax and had an orgasm. You moaned in pleasure and now that you were expertly lubricated, he penetrated you. You gasped at a slight pain but then was submerged in desire and sexual pleasure. Never mind Oakius was male, lusty to the last degree, hairy, and already working out a massive amount of sweat. You were on silk and satin sheets and pillows and getting rammed by a satyr that obviously could bring you untold pleasure and delights! What more could a nymph asked for? Even better, you both reached orgasm at the same time and you felt his sperm discharged into your vagina, warm yet so incredibly potent. A part of your mind hoped it would reach your womb soon and start the beginning of a life that would resemble you and its father. Your partner was just so perfect! Or a daughter that shared the looks that had made Oakius so besotted with you! It had to happen! It just had to! With the amazing intercourse they&#39;d had and all the sperm deposited, it just had to! Any children born of such a wonderful act of love would bring honor and joy to the world! Oh, it would be a privilege to share Oakius&#39; bed and bear him offspring first! As both partners came down from their respective orgasm and panted, exhausted but blissful, Oakius pulled out of his love and settled next to her, cradling her in his arms and showering her with compliments. You were silent, reeling from what had just happened. Slowly, you became horrified at what had just occurred and at the thoughts you&#39;d had right after. The notion of bearing children for that lecherous creep, of spending your life here, with those indecent lustful half-animals, of being happy to share the bed of this horny creature, kissing him,... Ugh! And those thoughts had seemed so normal! What was wrong with you?<br />
&quot;Are you all right, my dearest love?&quot; he whispered in your ear.<br />
You bolted out of his grasp and out of the bed.<br />
&quot;No! No I&#39;m not!&quot;<br />
&quot;But you enjoyed it,&quot; he countered, frowning.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a man! How can I enjoy it? How many times do I have to tell you that?&quot; you shouted.<br />
Oakius sighed and stark naked, seized you, threw you upon his shoulder and walked outside, you also in the nude. Few people noticed you outside because all were inebriated, probably drugged and most without clothes themselves. So few even cast glances at you two. You pummelled the back of Oakius, hurled insults and kicked but your captor just chuckled and fondled and kissed your butt. No one heeded your cries.</p>
