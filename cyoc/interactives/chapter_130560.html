<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You&#39;re really inviting me to stay here?&quot; Jade asked again, still having a great deal of surprise at the offer the werecat had given her.<br />
<br />
The fact that Samantha Twist was a werecat wasn&#39;t a surprise. From some of the things that Dymixious and his father had told her over the years there were are fair number of weres out there. There weren&#39;t truly that many, and certainly wouldn&#39;t be in the majority if compared to the overall human population, though they never had any hard numbers, but it was enough to assume that no were-species was presently in danger of extinction. The surprise was that after the battle that her husband had put the Moon Lake police department through and the fact that battle had killed him the city was offering her and Hope a place to stay. She really didn&#39;t expect that as she thought on her future without Dymixious and what her options were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Samantha gave a low nod, confirming what she&#39;d explained, &quot;it&#39;s really the least we can do for you... after... well, after everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your police understood all the risks and were doing their job,&quot; Jade answered with a slightly annoyed tone and narrowing her eyes a bit.<br />
<br />
While Dymixious&#39;s death hurt and she didn&#39;t want to see him die, especially in a gun battle before her eyes, that didn&#39;t mean that she saw her husband as some sort of Lancelot that acted only for justice and had no vices. She&#39;d been well aware of Dymixious&#39;s temper for years and had often tried to get him to ease up in that regard. While he may have aimed that temper at criminals and rogue weres, that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that an emotional attack on someone was right, and Jade was smart enough to understand the reasoning the Moon Lake Police had for arresting Dymixious. At the same time, Jade was not blind to her husband&#39;s flaws and could clearly see that he had attacked the Moon Lake officers and that they would HAVE to defend themselves. <br />
<br />
In this, she understood what had happen and wasn&#39;t going to emotionally blame the Moon Lake Police for her husband&#39;s death. In that she sort of expected Moon Lake to remain rather distant and professional with her, in that their efforts had been more to get the FBI off of potentially coming to Moon Lake and discovering their sanctuary while tracking someone they knew to be a criminal, even if his crimes were committed with the best of intentions for everyone. In this, with Dymixious dead, Moon Lake had not explicit reason to keep Jade there and could well claim &quot;vengeance&quot; for her husband starting the fight. Offering her a home was the last thing she expected, though at the same time, the apologies for killing Dymixious and the trying to emphasize why he&#39;d been killed were growing old.<br />
<br />
&quot;And my husband did attack them,&quot; Jade finished, &quot;I don&#39;t like that he died, but neither do I blame you or your policemen for his death...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha slowly nodded, raised a hand to her mouth to clear her throat and then straightened her clothing before she picked up her conversation again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we&#39;re offering you a place to stay and where you&#39;ll be safe and won&#39;t be facing daily violence,&quot; Samantha spoke as carefully as she could, &quot;You and your daughter deserve that. And Moon Lake does have some vacant homes other than the one you were in next to mine and my wife&#39;s, though you could stay there if you wish... or I&#39;m sure we could find you an apartment for you and your daughter. Where you stay in Moon Lake ultimately up to you... but this town does have the open places for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane softly held her daughter and thought for a moment. In many ways she didn&#39;t want to live in a world that was filled with violence. Hope was quite literally her future, and while she did respect her father in law, that didn&#39;t mean she really saw him as &quot;the future&quot; for her or Hope. In many ways, while Dymixious&#39;s father was not as temperamental as his son, he wasn&#39;t too different from his son. In that, Jade felt safer in Moon Lake and with that she made her choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a nice town here,&quot; Jade said slowly, &quot;and I&#39;d actually fine with living here... in Moon Lake, I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a nice town, and generally full of nice people,&quot; Samantha promised, &quot;You&#39;ll be safe and there will be no threat... so long as the law is obeyed, of course... but, that should be obvious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But which would you like?&quot; Samantha asked, &quot;the house you&#39;re in, some other house, or an apartment? I can help find one for you, as it would relate to my normal duties as Town Chancellor, but I&#39;d need to know on where you&#39;d prefer to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think an apartment would work better,&quot; Jade spoke, &quot;Hope and I don&#39;t need much... Perhaps I could work for your town... help all sides move forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha then nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll get right on that, then. For the moment, you and Hope can stay in the house where you are, and once we have knowledge on which apartment is open, I&#39;ll let you know and we can start moving you in.&quot;</p>
