<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I want to become a plant boy like you.&quot;<br />
Jeff had been secretly hoping Arden would say that, but it had seemed like too much to hope for. Now it seemed too good to be true. Just the thought of Arden&#39;s body swelling with juice made his pistil ooze and his stamens release extra pheremones.<br />
&quot;How do I do it?&quot; Arden asked.<br />
Jeff hadn&#39;t thought about that. Without the Chronivac... He was able to move his shoulders just enough to give a rough shrug.<br />
Arden sighed and sat down next to Jeff. &quot;Maybe if I just get naked and get down in the dirt? I assume I need to get in a position like you&#39;re in...&quot;<br />
Jeff thought back to his own transformation. What had been the first step... Oh!<br />
He did his best to gesture toward Arden&#39;s groin with his head. It took a few tries, but Arden eventually got the idea.<br />
&quot;My crotch? You need my... You need me to do something with my dick?&quot;<br />
Jeff nodded and squeaked, then thrust tongue flower bud out of his mouth, letting it spread and bloom to its full glory. It was different from his back flower. While his back was dominated by the huge, long, thick pistil that constantly oozed his nectar, his mouth flower was shaped more like the horn of a trumpet. Jeff wasn&#39;t sure, but he thought it was even a little moist on the inside. In any case, he&#39;d long had a burning need to know what it felt like to have something inside of it.<br />
Arden needed no more encouragement as he stripped down to nothing, tossing his armor and sword aside like junk. His cock was hard and proud before him, a lovely thick seven inches that made Jeff almost wish he were human again. Arden stepped forward and teased the tip of his cock around the insides of the petals of Jeff&#39;s blossom. &quot;Like this, right?&quot;<br />
Jeff thrust his head forward, impaling his bloom on Arden&#39;s manhood. Arden moaned loudly and unabashedly, and his hips began thrusting deeply and rhythmically into Jeff&#39;s flower. Arden was in heaven; this whole crazy situation had him more turned on than he&#39;d ever been in his life, even after jerking off, and now for some reason this insane, perverted idea was the only thing he could think or care about. He had to become a plant boy! He wanted it so bad!<br />
Jeff was in just as much ecstasy. It turned out the center of his mouth flower led deeper than he would have guessed, and the new passage was extremely stretchy, slick and sensitive. This, he was now sure, was the whole reason he even had a mouth flower. He loved his new body so much! He quivered and jiggled with each wild thrust of Arden&#39;s hips and sack against his face.<br />
Finally, after what again seemed an unnaturally long time for such a horny man, Arden came, shooting his seed deep into Jeff&#39;s mouth. Jeff could feel it beginning to work its way deep inside himself, to some secret part he had never known was there. Jeff couldn&#39;t wait to find out what would happen.<br />
Arden moaned in delight as he withdrew from Jeff. Almost as soon as his cock was free, it began to change just like Jeff&#39;s had way back when, almost twisting in on itself as it shrunk and swelled into a bulb, which bloomed for the first time, making Arden cry out as he came. Jeff was glad his new friend was enjoying this so much. It was going to be so nice to have someone else around... although now that he&#39;d experienced what a human could do for him, it would be hard to go back to just having the plants and animals around...<br />
Just as quickly as it had bloomed, Arden&#39;s cock flower closed back in on itself and pulled inside his body, then the opening that it pulled into sealed up in front of it, leaving Arden&#39;s groin smooth. Jeff began to squeak and gesture urgently toward the ground, but he needn&#39;t have worried; Arden&#39;s body knew exactly what to do. <br />
Arden kneeled down on the ground, shuffling around on his hands and knees, trying to find the perfect spot to plant himself in. He settled on a place next to but at an angle to Jeff, far enough they both had plenty of room to grow but with their faces close enough that they could touch their mouth flowers together if they tried. Jeff smiled and squeaked happily in approval as Arden settled into position, already digging his fingers and toes into the soil.<br />
Unlike Jeff, the first thing to change was his ass; maybe that had been the part he was looking forward to the most, Jeff mused. Arden moaned loudly as he arched his back, sticking his ass high in the air as it sealed up to look like Jeff&#39;s, one big round protrusion with only a slight crease to indicate where his buttocks had once been. Arden&#39;s eyes were rolling back in his head and his tongue was lolling out of his mouth - at least, until his tongue began to swell, cutting off another moan as it twisted itself into another bulb, which blossomed into a soft-petaled, trumpet-shaped flower. Jeff&#39;s own tongue flower blossomed out sympathetically, and for the first time they touched them together, rubbing the flowers against each other. It was incredible; Jeff had never realized how sensitive his petals were! And Arden was more certain than ever that he had made the right decision, that he would be happy here with Jeff.<br />
As if triggered by that realization, Arden&#39;s fingers and toes finally began merging into sharp spears. They shot deep into the soil then quickly spread and branched, rooting him in place. He nuzzled Jeff&#39;s face as his arms and legs became brown and rough and short, just vines connecting his roots to his body, which was very rapidly turning green all over.<br />
And then finally, Arden&#39;s back began to swell. His mouth flower blocked all sound but the way he threw his head back clearly showed how much pleasure he felt as an enormous new bud began to emerge from his back. As Arden came once again, it blossomed, its white petals blinding as they caught the sunlight through the trees. The scent of Arden&#39;s first nectar, thick and sweet as it swelled from his pistil, was carried off by the same breeze that gently rustled his stamens.<br />
Arden looked tired but content; if he&#39;d still had lungs, he would&#39;ve been panting. He nuzzled Jeff and Jeff nuzzled him back, and they both gently brushed their blossoms against each other. Then Arden pulled in his mouth bud, closed his eyes, and was very still, even as dragonflies and hummingbirds began coming by to investigate their new food source.<br />
Jeff just lay there smiling, wondering at the day&#39;s events and his good fortune. It was going to be so nice to have someone to grow with...</p>
