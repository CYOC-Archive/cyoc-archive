<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;d like to go to a nice sit-down place if you&#39;re okay with that,&quot; suggested Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m getting hungry and it would be nice to sit for a bit.&quot;  Joan listed their options.  &quot;Other than the food court, we could go to the Buffalo wings bar with the TVs, the cheesecake place with the ridiculous menu, or the Chinese chain with the lettuce wraps.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you like wings, but it&#39;s always so loud there and the TVs are always showing stuff that doesn&#39;t interest me,&quot; Katie confessed.  &quot;How about Cheesecake Factory?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds perfect,&quot; Joan agreed.  They walked back toward where they had entered the mall and found the restaurant right by the door.  As it was shortly before noon, they luckily didn&#39;t have to wait to be seated and were shown to a table for two.<br />
<br />
As they flipped past ads in the seemingly endless spiral-bound menu, Katie became curious about aspects of Joan&#39;s transformation.  &quot;You know, I can&#39;t help but wonder how deep the similarities go between you and me.  Obviously you look identical to me right down to my hairstyle, but the similarities must stop at some level because you&#39;ve still got your own mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m definitely still female &#39;down there&#39;, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re wondering,&quot; confirmed Joan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured, but what about scars?  I have a small one on the underside of my arm from when I fell during a track meet in college.&quot;  Katie held up her right arm and revealed a faint scar near her elbow.<br />
<br />
Joan held up his arm and craned his head around trying to see.  &quot;Yeah, is that it?  I think I have that too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s the same scar.&quot;  Katie looked at Joan&#39;s mouth.  &quot;Open your mouth.  I want to see if you have a filling in the same tooth.&quot;  Joan did as instructed and Katie looked inside.  &quot;Yeah, I think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a weird feeling to have someone else&#39;s mouth,&quot; said Joan.  &quot;The teeth feel like they&#39;re in the wrong places compared to what I&#39;ve been used to my whole life.  Even when I changed last night, my mouth still felt familiar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s interesting.  I hadn&#39;t even thought about that.  What else feels different?&quot; asked Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Other than the obvious appendage missing between my legs and a constant weight on my chest, having longer hair feels strange too.  I&#39;m shorter, so there&#39;s a slightly different perspective.  For example, this table feels higher than what I&#39;m used to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does your eyesight seem different?  Are colors the same?  I&#39;ve always wondered if what I see as red might be what you see as blue...or something like that.  Of course, there&#39;s no way for someone to know if colors they see are mixed up without actually being inside that other person&#39;s body.&quot;  Katie pointed to a picture of a strawberry on the menu.  &quot;For example, I see that strawberry as red and if I asked anyone else, they&#39;d also say it was red...but how do we know that everyone is actually seeing the same color?  If you grew up seeing strawberries as blue and you learned that color was called &#39;red&#39;, you&#39;d say it looked red.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Colors look the same to me,&quot; Joan confirmed.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure if that just confirms that we&#39;re both seeing the same color spectrum or we have the same error of seeing blue and calling it &#39;red&#39;.  What about color blind people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re usually blind to a color.  They might see both green and red as the same or maybe they see gray instead of some colors.  We can detect if people think two colors are the same, but it&#39;s simply not possible to detect if someone might see colors swapped.  Anyway, maybe if we did see differences, maybe you still see the same as your old body because it&#39;s connected to your brain from your original body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan nodded.  &quot;Maybe.  Anyway, I haven&#39;t really noticed any other differences yet.  The different teeth was really the most surprising difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if your taste has changed.  Is there some food you don&#39;t care for that I like?  Maybe you&#39;d like it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like tomatoes?&quot; asked Joan.  &quot;I normally ask for restaurants to hold the tomatoes.  I find the texture unappealing.  I don&#39;t mind the taste so much though and do use ketchup.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I do like them, but is there something where you don&#39;t like the taste?  That would be a better test instead of having to judge by an unappealing texture.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan thought for a moment.  &quot;Pickles...  Rum...  Anchovies, liver, and pea soup...  Oh, and raisins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like pickles, rum, and raisins.  I totally agree on the anchovies, liver, and pea soup though.&quot;  Katie flipped to the drink menu.  &quot;I&#39;m going to order a drink with rum in it.  I&#39;ll let you have a taste and we&#39;ll see if you like rum now or if you still don&#39;t care for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a good test,&quot; Joan agreed.<br />
<br />
Katie pointed a finger at Joan.  &quot;Wait, you were drinking a Long Island iced tea last night.  That has rum in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s also got vodka, tequila, and gin.  You can barely taste the rum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay.  Well how about a mojito?&quot; suggested Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect.  I tried one in college on spring break and haven&#39;t had one since.  That&#39;s about when I discovered that I didn&#39;t like rum drinks...or at least most rum drinks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their server arrived after another minute and they placed their order.  As they waited for their drinks to arrive, they continued their conversation about the nuances of their transformation. The restaurant buzzed with activity, but they were lost in their own little world.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what else feels different to you?&quot; Katie asked, genuinely curious.<br />
<br />
Joan leaned back in his chair, pondering the question. &quot;You know, it&#39;s interesting to be in this body and experience how people interact with me as a woman,&quot; he remarked, his tone pensive.<br />
<br />
Katie leaned in, intrigued. &quot;What have you noticed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan took a moment to gather his thoughts. &quot;Well, for one, I&#39;ve noticed more attention from men. It&#39;s like they perceive me differently now that I&#39;m in a female body. Some of them give me these approving looks or flirtatious smiles that I never really received before. It&#39;s disconcerting, to be honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie frowned sympathetically. &quot;I can imagine how uncomfortable that must be. Unfortunately, that&#39;s something many women have to deal with regularly. It&#39;s a sad reality, but it&#39;s important to remember that their behavior is not a reflection of you. It&#39;s on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan nodded, appreciating Katie&#39;s understanding. &quot;I know, it&#39;s just strange to experience it firsthand. I&#39;ve always considered myself an empathetic person, but being in this body has given me a new perspective on the challenges women face. It&#39;s eye-opening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their conversation was interrupted as their drinks arrived—a tall glass filled with a refreshing green concoction adorned with a sprig of mint. Katie took a sip and savored the taste, enjoying the cool minty flavor. She passed the glass to Joan, who took a tentative sip, his eyes widening in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what? This actually tastes...good,&quot; Joan said, his tone filled with pleasant surprise. &quot;I never thought I&#39;d enjoy a drink with rum, but the combination of flavors in this mojito is delightful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled, pleased with the outcome. &quot;Looks like your taste buds have undergone a transformation too. It&#39;s amazing how being in a different body can change your perception of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having just beaten the lunch rush, they didn&#39;t have to wait long for their food to arrive.  As they enjoyed their meal, Katie and Joan continued to discuss the various aspects of Joan&#39;s transformation. They laughed and shared stories, savoring the chance to experience the world from a different perspective. The conversation flowed effortlessly, their connection growing stronger with each passing moment.<br />
<br />
After they finished their plates, Joan wiped his mouth and sat in his chair with a satisfied smile on his face. &quot;That was delicious. Thanks for picking this place, Katie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, Joan,&quot; Katie replied, her eyes shining with happiness. &quot;I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they exited the restaurant, Joan turned to Katie with a mischievous glint in his eyes. &quot;You know, there&#39;s something I&#39;ve been wanting to do since this transformation happened. I want to...&quot;</p>
