<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What?  No!  I want to stay like this!&quot;  Lisa yelled across the table at Eric.  Surprised by her sudden outburst, he dropped his fork onto the plate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa.   Just... whoa.  Calm down.&quot;  Eric was not one to fall prey to intimidation, but Lisa had scared him.  He hadn&#39;t expected her to want to stay like this.  He had expected her to be okay with her reverting to normal human. Maybe a little sad since she really seemed to enjoy herself last night.  Then he&#39;d be able to cheer her up with another change.<br />
<br />
Eric put on his best brave face and tried to calm down his girlfriend, &quot;I put a timer on the change as a precaution.  A... safeguard.  What if the Chronivac broke overnight?  I didn&#39;t want to risk getting you stuck in a crazy form you might not like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;  Lisa blushed and looked down at her plate, where she held 4 forks with 4 arms, 2 arms rested on the table, and more lazily hung down by her legs.  She dropped the forks and remained silent for a minute, her eyes closed.  A few of her hands closed into fists.  Eric sat and waited quietly, unsure how to react.  Cars driving down the street outside maintained a minimum level of ambient noise, but not enough to prevent the situation from feeling awkward.<br />
<br />
After a short eternity, Lisa looked back up to Eric, &quot;Sorry for yelling.  I just... I really love this.  I&#39;ve always wanted to be unique and special, but never felt like either.  I&#39;ve always been in the middle of the flock.  Never stood out before.  Never did anything notable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you stand out, you&#39;re amazing!  If you weren&#39;t amazing, do you think I would have asked you to the dance last year?  Or asked you to be my girlfriend?  Or taken you on all those dates?  The Chronivac didn&#39;t change who you really are, it just made the amazing in you more obvious on the outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa blushed.  &quot;I didn&#39;t feel amazing before.  I thought I was just another nobody.  And then... this happened, and now I know I&#39;m truly special!  How many other girls can be in 3 places at once?  Or have... &quot; Lisa paused while she mentally counted.  &quot;Holy crap... I have 32 arms.  On this me, I mean.  If you count all 3 of me I have uh... 96 arms.  And...  Heh... Just as many boobs&quot;  She slowly stroked circles around the outlines of her breasts through the apron she wore.  Her nipples poked against the fabric, clearly showing she was aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.  You were sexy before...  before you changed... too.&quot; Eric stared at his girlfiend as she lifted the apron over her head, revealing her front 8 amazing breasts.  He knew that each of her 3 taur segments standing behind her also had 8 identical breasts hanging down towards the floor.  Watching his girlfriend idly play with herself quickly made Eric get hard.  His shifted his chair closer to the table, hoping to hide his growing erection.<br />
<br />
He cleared his throat and looked back at his girlfriend&#39;s beautiful face.  He would love to sit there and just enjoy the show, but he wanted to prevent Lisa from making a horrible mistake. &quot;But even if you could make everyone else think you&#39;ve always been like that, what about all the other problems you&#39;ll have?  Like uh... driving a car!  Or riding a plane!  Or even sitting at a desk in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
He paused for a breath then continued, &quot;But that&#39;s not even the worst of it!  No-one else is like you, not even close.  If suddenly you became that, don&#39;t you think people would notice?  The government would take you away and dissect you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Another Lisa walked into the room, coming down from Eric&#39;s bedroom.  She yawned and gave a small wave to Eric, who turned and stared in surprise as a second copy of his girlfriend entered the room.  Lisa walked over to the stove where a large amount of bacon and eggs waited in the pans, grabbed a nearby plate and loaded it up with breakfast while the Lisa at the table smugly watched as Eric stared at her other body.<br />
<br />
The second Lisa made a tight U-turn in the kitchen and walked up to the table next to Eric.  She put her plate down next to his and, while standing, took a few bites of egg.  Eric&#39;s attention was entirely focused on the fully nude girlfriend standing next to him.  Or at least the side view he got of her many breasts, both on her upright torso and hanging below her first horizontal taur segment.<br />
<br />
She swallowed her egg and both Lisas giggled at the same time.  The Lisa standing next to Eric spoke, &quot;Good points.  I&#39;m sure I can find a way to live with the restrictions this form has.  I&#39;m getting better at it.  Yeah, there would need to be some adjustments, but they would be worth it.  I really really like being this way.&quot;  She took another bite of egg, and the Lisa across the table continued talking,<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus there&#39;s an option in the Chronivac that can make any changes seem like they&#39;ve always been that way, and that there&#39;s nothing unusual about them.&quot;  Lisa smiled sweetly as Eric switched his attention back to the speaking body across the table.  Eric knew she had looked at his computer screen a few times the previous day when he was setting up her change, but was surprised she had noticed, let alone remembered, an option like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s... I&#39;d have to read the help info on that.  That sounds amazing if possible, but also really far-fetched.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked back over at the Lisa to his side.  She grinned and said &quot;Plus, I&#39;m hella sexy now.  Waaaay more sexy than I was before.&quot;<br />
<br />
3 of Lisa&#39;s arms wrapped around behind his back, and she leaned over to give him a side hug.  Her breasts swug over, briefly connecting with his face and torso.  &quot;That&#39;s... that&#39;s not a good reason to change yourself so massively though!  You were super hot before!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... maybe.  But even if I was, I&#39;m sexier now.  And I enjoy it even more now&quot; she said.  She took another bite of breakfast, and the Lisa across the table continued talking.  &quot;But... I do get your point.  You don&#39;t want me to risk making an irreversable mistake.  That&#39;s... fine.  I guess you have a good point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric sighed.  He was relieved to hear her say that.  He was definitely going to miss her altered form, but he loved Lisa more, and wanted to make sure she would be happy (and hopefully his) for a long time.  &quot;Good to know you can still understand common sense&quot; he half joked.  &quot;This has been fun though... Maybe we could do another more subtle change today and try out that awareness option?  My mom&#39;s gonna be back around 1.  She texted me this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa didn&#39;t need to look at the clock in the kitchen, she already knew it was 11:30 AM.  She grinned when Eric mentioned the possibility of using the Chronivac again. &quot;That sounds fun.  So I&#39;m dying to know... If you could have made one other change to me yesterday, what would it have been?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric blushed and glanced between the 2 Lisas watching him.  &quot;Well, uh...  This will sound a little strange.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on&quot; the Lisa next to him playfully nudged him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I almost gave you a 2nd head.  You know, so there would be 2 heads on each uh... you, instead of 1.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh!  That&#39;s... an interesting idea.&quot;  Lisa next to him reached over and grabbed him in an 8 armed hug, holding him tightly.  &quot;What would I ever do without you?&quot; she whispered into Eric&#39;s ear.  The other Lisa from across the table answered the question, &quot;Oh, just come up with something else to put in the Chronivac.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something about the way she said that scared Eric even more than what she had actually said.  He looked over at the Lisa across the table and instantly recognized her mischievous grin that had gotten them into trouble so many times before.  &quot;Wait, what?  What did you do?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing yet.  Wait for it... Okay, now I&#39;ve done it.&quot;  Lisa grinned madly.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
<i>One conversation earlier, when Lisa had yelled &quot;What?  No!  I want to stay like this!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Lisa woke with a start.  She felt like she had just gotten a massive jolt of adrenaline, as if she&#39;d been hit by lightning.  A moment later, she woke up again.  2 pairs of eyes on separate bodies flew open, and Lisa found she was looking at herself.<br />
<br />
Surprised by the sudden draw from deep sleep to consciousness, her brains were jumbled.  She had no idea where she was, or why she was looking at her own face, let alone why she was seeing it twice.<br />
<br />
The fog lifted quickly and she remembered where, and what, she was now.  She was sleeping on her boyfriend Eric&#39;s bed at his house, although her final taur segment flowed over the end of the bed, causing her back pair of legs to rest directly on the floor.  Twice.  She had decided to use his bed for her private masturbation area after her other body and Eric had passed out downstairs last night after having the best sex of their lives.<br />
<br />
But more importantly, right now she was downstairs arguing with Eric about her imminent timed change back to a normal person.  None of her wanted that - all 3 minds knew she would be happier if she could remain like this.<br />
<br />
While she argued downstairs, her 2 brains upstairs tried to think of alternate ways to prevent the upcoming change.  She quickly came up with an idea: <i>If the Chronivac was able to change me to this the first way, it can probably make me stay this way!</i><br />
<br />
Lisa tried to get up with both bodies, causing her simultaneous double actions to only intertwine her bodies more.  Arms and legs wrapped around and between her bodies.  The sudden movement also stirred her morning arousal, causing 2 of her semi-erect penises along the center of her bodies to enter the matching vagina on her opposite body.  She let out twin grasps at the sudden interlocking of her genitalia.<br />
<br />
<i>Gotta untangle myself before I co.. cum!</i><br />
<br />
Despite her best efforts, the close proximity, matched gentalia, many breasts pressing against her other body, and her sudden movements attempting to untangle herself quickly drove her arousal through the roof.  Unable to prevent it, she rapidly ejaculated with both penises.  She felt the hot fluid leaving her body... and entering her other body.  Orgasms rippled through her bodies and pounded her minds.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Lisa had closed her eyes and was silently riding out the orgasms her other bodies were experiencing while Eric sat and stared on awkwardly.  They passed quickly, and Lisa resumed untangling her bodies upstairs.  Now that she was really awake, thanks to the surprise orgasms, she had no trouble in coordinating her many limbs and separating her bodies.<br />
<br />
She also didn&#39;t have any trouble getting both of her bodies up onto their respective 8 feet.  One of her went over to Eric&#39;s computer where the Chronivac was still plugged in.  Pressing the power button it started to boot up.  She knew that he had a password on his computer, but he had trusted her enough to text it to her one day when she was at his house while he was at the store.  With her other body, she looked for her phone.  She knew she had left it in his room yesterday, but had knocked it off the bed last night.<br />
<br />
Searching for the phone proved to be tricky with her new form.  The first thing she tried was to bend her front legs to kneel down.  That caused a chain reaction, pulling her back legs closer to her front legs as her first taur segment went from being completely horizontal to being diagonal, thus reducing the horizontal space between her first and second set of legs.  She nearly tripped, but recovering and stood up before she did.  Having failed at the first attempt, she reconsidered and decided to try something completely different.<br />
<br />
Lisa shifted so she was facing the bed and spread out her 2nd, 3rd, and 4th pairs of legs fairly wide apart so someone could easily crawl under her without touching her legs.  Then she leaned forward over the bed, allowing her front torso to lay horizontal on the bed.  Then she backed away, causing her front legs and torso to slide down to the floor.  When she finished, her front torso was laying face down on the carpet and her front legs were lying on the carpet directly under her taur torso segments, between her 2nd and 3rd pairs of legs.<br />
<br />
Having successfully gotten her head down to floor level, she used 4 arms and her front pair of legs to get her front torso onto her hands and knees.  During the whole maneuver, she watched herself with her other body.<br />
<br />
<i>Wow.  Now that&#39;s a pose I would not expect to see if someone told me they had 8 legs.</i><br />
<br />
To her delight, her new pose was able to move down the side of the bed, granting her vision under the bed so she could look for her phone.  It was a bit weird - she had to do a sort of shuffle with most of her legs while also crawling with some arms and one pair of legs.  It took her a couple of tries to back able to do it and to move, but she was able to move and search for the phone.<br />
<br />
Halfway down the bed she spotted it, and was easily able to grab it with one of her many extra arms.  She unlocked her phone and went through her text history to find Eric&#39;s password as her other body went over to the computer.  Once she found his password, her other body entered it into the computer.<br />
<br />
<i>This is so neat!  I was able to read that with one body, and type it with another body.  Eric doesn&#39;t understand just how amazing this is.</i><br />
<br />
As Lisa at the computer found and started up the Chronivac program, the Lisa kneeling on the ground carefully got back on her feet and dropped her phone on Eric&#39;s nightstand.  Then she left to go downstairs for breakfast.<br />
<br />
Lisa looked through the various options in the program, looking for anything that would let her stay unchanged.  She almost immediately ran into an options panel named &quot;Awareness&quot;, with setting indicating who would be aware of the changes.  It had a few interesting options:<br />
<br />
* Subject Awareness<br />
* Reality Awareness<br />
* Subject Normalcy<br />
* Reality Normalcy<br />
* Retroactively Alter Reality<br />
* Overwrite Base Form<br />
<br />
The last one had a big warning saying that once used, the Chronivac would not be able to calculate the subject&#39;s original form via scanning, and would only be able to load their original form from a saved &quot;.CVAC&quot; file.<br />
<br />
Intrigued by the possibility of such a file, Lisa went to the &quot;Load File&quot; option and was delighted to see 2 files - One named Eric, and one named Lisa.  She loaded up the Lisa file, and was unsurprised to see that the stats on the file looked appropriate for her back when she was a normal person.  Wanting to make sure she was the only one who had access to that data, she retrieved her phone and plugged it in with a USB cable.<br />
<br />
A quick file copy later and she had a copy of the original Lisa file on her phone.  Satisfied, she disconnected the phone from the PC and had the Chronivac scan subject.  She aimed the Chronivac at herself, like she had seen Eric do yesterday, and the information on the screen updated, showing stats that looked appropriate for her current form.  Things like &quot;Body Count: 3&quot;.<br />
<br />
Satisfied that it was the current her, she saved the file, replacing the existing Lisa.CVAC.<br />
<br />
Then she went back into the settings and set Subject Awareness to &quot;Aware of change&quot;, Reality Awareness to &quot;Unaware of change&quot;, Subject Normalcy to &quot;Not normal&quot;, Reality Normalcy to &quot;Normal&quot;, Retroactively Alter Reality to &quot;No&quot;, and Overwrite Base Form to &quot;Yes&quot;.<br />
<br />
She clicked through to the final page and clicked Apply.  She was greeted by an error message: &quot;Unable to apply change - no changes selected.  Make changes then reapply.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Oh... So I have to change something?  Hmm, maybe Eric has an idea.</i><br />
<br />
Downstairs, she asked Eric and heard his idea.<br />
<br />
Once she did, she considered her options and own ideas, then...</p>
