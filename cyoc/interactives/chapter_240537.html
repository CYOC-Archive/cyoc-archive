<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the next while, Eric was happily in and out of the diving pool and the other deeper pools too, simply enjoying how good it felt to be seventeen, and how incredible his body was in the water. Not that he wasn&#39;t making the most out of the water too, and every time he got to climb out and walk to his next location of choice, he could feel the stares. He got to bask in it, to note the covert head-turns and double takes. How the looks would travel over his chest, his abs, his legs, and unavoidably his crotch.<br />
<br />
Every single time.<br />
<br />
Even if just for a second or two, they couldn&#39;t NOT take a look. It wasn&#39;t merely what he was wearing. It was the fact that it was stuffed so tightly, but even so full, it was rounded and smoothed over into a plump mass that was both tastefully contained and wonderfully obscene.<br />
<br />
He even made sure to adjust himself when he knew those eyes were on him; a brush of the palm, or a tap of the fingers as if he were nudging it back into the right place.<br />
<br />
The whole situation put Eric in a fantastic mood, and by the time he was wanting to find something for lunch, he felt on top of the world. There wasn&#39;t anything he couldn&#39;t deal with if he needed to -- he was invincible! Life was good, and he got in line at one of the concession stands. Their admission fee had included a certain value of prepaid refreshments, because Ethan was quite clear he didn&#39;t want to be returning to the locker to fetch his card or cash in the middle of swimming.<br />
<br />
So Eric stayed in line, flashed his waterproof ID ankle-tag to the vendor, and went off to sit and eat. Being older meant he had more of an appetite too, and Eric found himself wolfing down his scoop of piping hot French fries, and practically chugging the soda along with it. He was a teenager, and he was hungry -- his body needed all this fuel for energy, and that knowledge was just another exciting thing on top of all the other things that was making his day so damn good.<br />
<br />
Before he could get up and dispose of the trash, a girl sat down opposite him at the table. She was Ethan&#39;s age -- &quot;Well, it&#39;s MY age right now,&quot; Eric gleefully told himself -- with blonde hair and purple highlights. As soon as she sat, she started talking, and he was impressed by the fact that she was the first out of many watchers to actually approach him. She was wearing a green two-piece bikini set, and she was really pretty. She had blue eyes, a light tan, and as Eric&#39;s gaze wandered, a taut stomach and a pair of boobs that were a close second to Haylee&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;-so that&#39;s when I thought I&#39;d come over and say hi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Eric muttered dumbly, having completely zoned out through the first part of the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don&#39;t leave me hanging.&quot; She smirked playfully. &quot;This is where you give me your name too.&quot;<br />
<br />
His name &#39;too&#39;? Had she already said hers?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. I&#39;m Ethan!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleasure to meet you, Ethan.&quot; She leaned forward a bit as she spoke, giving a clear shot of her cleavage. As fun as boobs were though, Eric was still hungry, and wanted something else from the stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you wanna get a smoothie? I&#39;m thirsty.&quot;<br />
<br />
She blinked, taken aback by his directness, but quickly recovered. &quot;Sure. Let&#39;s go grab one.&quot;<br />
<br />
They got up together and stood in the queue. Surprisingly, she stood very close to him as they waited, and Eric began to wonder if she was flirting with him. Was this how girls did it? Her conversation was a bit aimless, and he wasn&#39;t really sure why she was asking half the questions she was, but he went along with it anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like your hair. Where&#39;d you get it styled?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; Eric liked Ethan&#39;s haircut too; it wasn&#39;t too short like a lot of swimmers, and it matched the facial features and body type really well. He did look good! &quot;There&#39;s a barber near our house who cuts it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded, looking at him expectantly as if expecting something in return, then frowned slightly before trying again. &quot;You must swim a bunch, or work out. You&#39;re in really good shape!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I sure do!&quot; He knew it wouldn&#39;t be long before she commented on it. Who wouldn&#39;t notice how strong he was? &quot;I&#39;m a great swimmer. I go to competitions, and stuff like that.&quot; Eric wasn&#39;t sure how Ethan would talk about his chosen discipline, and he couldn&#39;t remember the specifics of when and where either, so he just thought it would be easiest to brag. &quot;I&#39;ve won a few times too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, that&#39;s ... cool?&quot; She sounded confused, like he was answering a question she didn&#39;t ask. They reached the counter, put in their orders, and took the drinks. Eric couldn&#39;t help himself; it was a warm day and he was thirsty.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love smoothies!&quot; His energetic exclamation was followed by taking a very long draw of it, and without even letting it settle, followed that up with a second even longer sip, slurping the mixture up through the straw.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- .. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re supposed to drink it that fast. You&#39;ll get brain freeze.&quot; The girl was watching him with raised eyebrows as she sipped her own, her expression a mixture of amused and weirded-out.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay!&quot; He laughed. &quot;I didn&#39;t drink it THAT quick, I&#39;m f- ... owww!&quot; An intense burst of cold pain burst through his forehead. &quot;Ehhhh, that hurts!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, sit with me and finish it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Wincing, he followed her back to their seats. &quot;It&#39;s never been THAT bad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re silly.&quot; She swatted his arm, a sly smile forming. &quot;I think it&#39;s cute that a handsome guy like you doesn&#39;t take himself too seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
Handsome? Of course she thought he was handsome, just like he knew she was pretty. That&#39;s why they were hanging out, right? He wasn&#39;t sure why she kept bringing it up, and touching him.<br />
<br />
Flirting was ... strange.<br />
<br />
Before he replied, he took another longer, but more careful pull on his smoothie, and just as he was about to speak, he burped instead. It wasn&#39;t super loud, but the moment was enough to make Eric start snickering. Her expression went from warmly amused, to a raised eyebrow that verged almost on disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; He snorted. &quot;Couldn&#39;t keep it in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I- ... um, that&#39;s alright.&quot; The girl seemed momentarily speechless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; he said, thinking maybe she wanted to do something together, &quot;have you been on the Hydro-Flier?&quot; It was one of the fastest water slides at the park, with several dramatic twists and even a corkscrew in it.<br />
<br />
Her eyes lit up. &quot;No! But if you&#39;re going, I&#39;ll do it too.&quot; She tucked a stray curl of blonde behind her ear, lowering her head demurely. &quot;That&#39;s if you want me to?&quot;<br />
<br />
It worked!<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Eric smiled at the girl, pleased he&#39;d made the right call. Who didn&#39;t enjoy flying down a slippery tunnel at a high speed? &quot;Water slides are fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they are.&quot; She gave him a look, like he stated the painfully obvious, and then stood, leaving her half-finished smoothie on the table, only to take his hand. &quot;I&#39;m ready now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; They abandoned the table, the girl now clinging to him for some reason, and strolled across in the direction of the Hydro-Flier. She had hooked herself around his right arm, and seemed to enjoy being attached there, and Eric admittedly liked the feeling of her left breast brushing against his bicep too. The fact that he was still getting casual glances from strangers as they made their way to the Flier&#39;s entrance didn&#39;t seem to hurt either, and she stayed holding onto him as they were admitted and ascended up to the top.<br />
<br />
When it was their turn, the attendant let them through together, assuming they were going as a pair, but when they got to the mouth of the ride, ready to jump into the sluicing water, he did what Ethan had always done with him when they had gone on these kinds of slides together in the past.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you at the bottom!&quot; With a little push, he sent her in first, the little gasp she made and the look of shock on her face making him want to laugh, as she disappeared downward. He&#39;d invited her, she was his guest, and guests got to go first!<br />
<br />
&quot;My turn!&quot; Eric jumped in next, laughing as he shot down the tunnel, twisting and turning like a pebble going over a waterfall. The corkscrew part was dizzying but exhilarating, and by the time he got to the final long straight stretch at the bottom, he was breathless right before he plunged into the catchment pool.<br />
<br />
Emerging out, he waded over to the edge, only to see the girl staring at him with an unreadable expression on her face. Eric was tempted to glance at her boobs again -- they looked especially nice with water running off them -- but instead he asked her what was up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ... pushed me in,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Then I jumped in too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said we&#39;d go together. Like, at the same time. You know ... together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did.&quot; He beamed. &quot;It was awesome!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyebrows raised. &quot;Are- ... are you serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he could reply she went on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really that dense?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dense? What did she mean?<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, what did I do?&quot; It came out sounding more childish than he meant it to, an anxious tremour creeping into the tone. &quot;Was it bad? Did the ride suck?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s jaw dropped before she shook her head. &quot;How is it someone who looks like you is so- ... ugh!&quot; She huffed loudly, rolling her eyes. &quot;I think I&#39;m gonna go now. Enjoy the water slide, Ethan.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she turned on her heel and walked off with not another word, and Eric could only watch her go. Walking slowly across to the benches at the side, he sat down and took a second to clear his head, feeling dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
What had he done wrong? Wasn&#39;t this the sort of thing boys were meant to do when hanging out with girls?<br />
<br />
What would the &#39;real&#39; Ethan have done differently?<br />
<br />
The more Eric thought about it, the more he realised ... he didn&#39;t really know.<br />
<br />
That was the problem.<br />
<br />
He had no idea how to be a teenager. All of the attention and experience of being in the body of a seventeen year old was great, but he didn&#39;t want to feel like this if he messed up: like a stupid, clueless baby who didn&#39;t even know what the mistake was. He didn&#39;t want to deal with that, and with that acceptance was a realisation. A temporary swap was okay, but he didn&#39;t want to BE Ethan. It was bittersweet to think that way, considering how much he idolised his brother and how perfect everything had been up until that point, but he knew it was true.<br />
<br />
As great as it was, this would finish, and he wanted to go back to himself afterwards.<br />
<br />
Eric Morales, eleven years old.<br />
<br />
Except, with the added bonus of a ten and a half inch cock every now and then.<br />
<br />
More often than not, if he got to choose.<br />
<br />
Idly, he wondered if Ethan had been having as much fun.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Several pools away, Ethan was winning his third game of water-tag.<br />
<br />
There were floating obstacles, and the rules were somewhat malleable and intricate, but he had made sure to learn what was what before joining in. Most of the other participants were twelve to fourteen, and they hadn&#39;t cared all too much when this scrawny kid had joined in. There weren&#39;t more than maybe a dozen of them all up, and although they spent some of the time goofing around, the competition was treated at least semi-seriously.<br />
<br />
It hadn&#39;t taken long for Ethan to figure out the swimming strengths and weaknesses of the others, and in alternating rounds he levied that against the appropriate people with the escape and pursuit paths he took. Though his body was eleven, he had the aquatic knowledge of his seventeen year old self, and even if he lacked the muscle of being older, that information gave him an advantage in technique and strategy.<br />
<br />
Simply put, he still looked like a kid, but he knew how to move deceptively fast in the water when it mattered, and to choose the optimal tactics for the situation.<br />
<br />
The kudos on his latest victory were rolling in, along with friendly insults about his height and parentage, but Ethan knew the ribbing was all part of the scene and nothing to be bothered by. Climbing onto the pool side, ready to leap back in during the lull between rounds, he was surprised instead by one of the older boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re really fast, you know.&quot; The wording could have been a compliment, but it didn&#39;t sound like one. The speaker was on the older and taller side of those present, maybe almost Conor&#39;s age, but completely lacking any of the boisterous charm the younger Sorensen had. This one was heavyset, tubby, and had a base sort of cunning as well. &quot;Too fast. I think you&#39;re a cheater.&quot;<br />
<br />
With no more warning, the boy made a sudden move. Ethan knew in the second it was meant to be a leg-trip, designed to sweep him into the pool in front of everybody, but his reflexes were quicker. Stepping back before the motion could complete, he dodged, only to run into the boy&#39;s companion, who was right behind Ethan.<br />
<br />
The other boy didn&#39;t try to push him into the pool, though. Instead, the hands gripped Ethan&#39;s waistband, and with a single powerful tug, pulled his swim shorts right down.<br />
<br />
For a moment, time stood still, and there was a jumble of gasps and exclamations from the other teens who were watching the interaction unfold. For all of two seconds he felt paralysed; his skinny lower body was on total display, his tiny junk laid bare for everyone to see.<br />
<br />
A couple snickered, some snorted, a few called out random funny phrases at the sight.<br />
<br />
The tubby guy laughed louder than he needed to, and his accomplice who did the pantsing joined in too. &quot;Oh my god, you&#39;re a shrimp! Everyone, see this!&quot;<br />
<br />
A burn of humiliation was flowing through him. He didn&#39;t want ... THIS!<br />
<br />
But ... cold reason and logic swiftly kicked in, overpowering his initial frightened paralysis. Right then, he wasn&#39;t teenage Ethan with a tiny borrowed cock. He was just Eric, an eleven year old, who was originally built this way.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t his fault, and he did not deserve any of it.<br />
<br />
In this situation, Ethan&#39;s humiliation morphed rapidly into anger.<br />
<br />
These were bullies, and it was the physical likeness of his little brother that they were targeting because they were jealous he was winning.<br />
<br />
It was just that simple, and this bullshit?<br />
<br />
It could NOT stand.<br />
<br />
Ethan yanked his shorts back up, his fingers flicking with furious precision as he rapidly retied the drawstring much closer, so he couldn&#39;t be pantsed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what your MOM said last night.&quot; He flipped the bird, right to the tubby bully&#39;s face, and then turned to address the rest of the assembled group, who were still in the water, speaking quickly and clearly in his high-pitched voice so all of them could hear. &quot;But I guess Jabba the Gut was too busy in the fridge to notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan didn&#39;t normally stoop to those kinds of jokes, but they had started it.<br />
<br />
There were a couple of shocked faces in the water, but more of them were snorting and chuckling at the sheer audacity of the response, and before anyone else could speak, one of them called out: &quot;Thas a burn, Duncan! Lil bro&#39;s a motherfuckin&#39; DRAGON!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Ethan was shoved from behind by the accomplice, and he stumbled a step forward, with the overweight bully grabbing Ethan&#39;s left arm roughly with his right.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck you just say about me?&quot; Duncan spat. &quot;You&#39;re a cheating little pencil-dick smartass.&quot; His hand came up and lightly slapped Ethan&#39;s face, not enough to really hurt, just as a wake-up warning shot. &quot;Gonna chuck you in and hold you under until you learn how to fuck off back to the kiddy pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all the provocation Ethan needed.<br />
<br />
Engaging his seventeen year old reflexes and physicality, Ethan took a step back, jerking his arm from Duncan&#39;s grip so he was free to move. Using his backward motion, his head smacked into the accomplice&#39;s face behind him, momentarily stunning the boy. At the same time, Ethan&#39;s right leg planted firmly next to the accomplice&#39;s own. Thrusting his right arm behind, he grabbed his opponent by the side of the swim shorts, he pulled the boy towards the pool, hooking him around the ankle, so he tripped and flew straight into the water.<br />
<br />
Duncan was already swiping an arm forward to recapture him, but Ethan slapped it away with his left hand, imparting more force with greater speed than the bully was expecting from a skinny kid. Then his left leg came up and hit Duncan squarely in the groin, while his right arm raised, and the elbow smacked heavily into Duncan&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhh!&quot; The bully wailed, dropping to his knees, one hand grasping his crotch, the other pawing at his face. He burst into tears as he squirmed on the ground, blood flowing from his nose and between his clutching fingers.<br />
<br />
The silence that followed from everyone watching was deafening.<br />
<br />
Until ... the same guy from earlier broke it again, a troll in the pool audience who clearly thought it was funny seeing Duncan getting his comeuppance, and commentating on it for everyone&#39;s benefit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yoooo! Lil bro just NAILED you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck is going on?&quot; One of the adult lifeguards came rushing over, and the man immediately went to check on Duncan, seeing the blood. He was all business, and clearly had no time for any childish antics. &quot;What happened here? We don&#39;t tolerate fighting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He hit me,&quot; choked out Duncan, sitting up, trying to wipe his face, &quot;and pushed Calvin in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Straight away, the smartass teen from the pool called it out in the same tone, with the same slang. &quot;Nah he ain&#39;t startin&#39; shit! Dunc tried it out and got rekt like a bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then another, a girl, called out from the water too: &quot;Yah, they pantsed him first &#39;cause he was winning at tag, then they grabbed him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even as he was helping Duncan up, the lifeguard addressed the group, regarding both Ethan and everyone else simultaneously as he sought to confirm it. &quot;Is this true?&quot;<br />
<br />
A murmur of &#39;yes&#39; answers and positive affirmations came from the young teens in the pool, and the man nodded at the obvious consensus and spoke to everyone again. &quot;I&#39;m going to take this one to get his injuries checked out, but I want to remind everybody we do not tolerate bullying.&quot; He nodded to Ethan. &quot;You&#39;re free to stay here, since you weren&#39;t the instigator and only defended yourself.&quot; Then to Duncan. &quot;You&#39;re coming with me, and then we&#39;re going to have to speak with your parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he was ushering the tubby boy away, Duncan still holding his face in one hand, and his bruised crotch in the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, lil bro!&quot; The same guy called out, his opinion acting as de facto barometer for the others. &quot;Ain&#39;t nobody here want some dumbass shit like dat, but you cool. Chill wit us if you want, aight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks man!&quot; Ethan grinned, enjoying the moment, but he knew it was getting later in the day. He&#39;d wasted a lot of time messing around before joining in the games, and he was probably overdue to see Eric. &quot;But, I should go find my big brother now. We were gonna meet up soon. Enjoy your tag! Have fun! Bye!&quot;<br />
<br />
He waved to them, and most of them waved back, then with a feeling of immense pride, Ethan jogged off, ready to find out what Eric had been up to in the meanwhile.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t too much later the brothers found each other. Ethan had gotten hungry first, and went for some food from the concession stand. It amused him that he only needed a small serving instead of an adult one to feel sated, and after, while he was wandering past the diving pools and towards the different hydroslide areas, he saw &#39;himself&#39; coming in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Eric greeted him, seeming happy to see him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; He replied. &quot;Do you feel like you&#39;re done, or do you want longer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric hesitated for a few seconds, and Ethan took the time to watch the mannerisms of his younger brother expressed through his own teenage body. It was interesting to think this was how other people saw him, and maybe it was narcissistic but he was starting to get a new appreciation for how good his teenage appearance really was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so.&quot; Eric nodded. &quot;I mean, I&#39;ve had fun, but ... I&#39;m probably ready to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Let&#39;s head back and get changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they walked together, Ethan asked him how he felt about the swap now that he had experienced it for longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was awesome at first, and I- ... I love being in your body. I thought maybe I wanted to actually be you, but I learned that ... I don&#39;t wanna stay as a teenager. I know we were looking for something more, right? But I don&#39;t think this is it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Ethan agreed. &quot;I think I got off to a tougher start. I started in the kid pools, and it wasn&#39;t quite right somehow, but I figured that ... I feel the same. It&#39;s fun, but only for a while. You should be really proud of the way your body is, by the way! You&#39;re actually more capable than you think, and I really did enjoy being &#39;Eric&#39;.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;You wanna hear my favourite moment from today? It&#39;s a cool story about what &#39;you&#39; did!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan then started detailing what had happened with Duncan, and after he finished, Eric&#39;s notably downturned bittersweet mood was lifted, and he had a proper smile again. &quot;You did all that as- ... as me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is SO cool!&quot; Despite the fact he was still in the teenage body, Eric very much felt like the little brother after hearing how the bullies were dealt with. It was totally something that Ethan would do, and the fact he managed it in Eric&#39;s own body just reinforced the hero worship Eric felt for who Ethan was. &quot;Um, I have a favourite moment too! It&#39;s a bit different from yours though.&quot;<br />
<br />
In return, he told the story of losing his speedo and what had happened after that in the staff lounge. Ethan&#39;s eyes went wide at the story, not sure whether to laugh or be second-hand embarrassed. On the one hand, it was HIM that physically did those things, but on the other, he hadn&#39;t experienced any of it directly and wouldn&#39;t have a memory of it. Besides, he knew how much Eric loved that kind of attention now, and that he would have definitely enjoyed everything about it to the very maximum possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I was gonna ask why my speedo changed from red to blue, but I didn&#39;t expect THAT to be the reason. I&#39;m not really too surprised though.&quot; Ethan laughed, as they reached their locker and extracted their belongings. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got a good memory from today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too.&quot; Eric agreed, stripping the speedo off and toweling himself down, Ethan removing his shorts and doing the same. &quot;I did only promise to be careful though. It was just a lifeguard instead of an old lady who got the eyeful instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snickering together, the brothers finished dressing, and once everything was packed away and in hand, Ethan put on the ring. With a thought, he reversed the swap, and once again, he was back in his own body.<br />
<br />
Yeah, he had enjoyed his day and was more enlightened because of it ... but it was also a relief to go be himself again.<br />
<br />
The brothers walked back through to the complex entry, and just as they were about to exit, someone interrupted them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, ummm, Ethan.&quot; It was a teen, maybe a year or two younger than him, with brown hair, a lean build, and a cute face. He had on a lifeguard uniform, with an extra sash that Ethan recognised as those worn by junior trainees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi.&quot; Confused at how this boy knew him, Ethan played it cool, trying to think if he recognised him from somewhere else.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- ... I really did enjoy meeting you today.&quot; He seemed super nervous, like he had built up a lot of courage just to talk to Ethan at all. He held out a piece of paper, and the older Morales took it. &quot;It&#39;s ... my number. I, um ... I hope you&#39;ll, maybe, text me sometime?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Ethan took it, and he began to understand who this boy probably was. &quot;Thanks!&quot; He didn&#39;t want to make any direct promise, but he also didn&#39;t want to outright reject this guy, who seemed like he was a couple of seconds away from turning into an anxious mess. &quot;I might! But things get busy sometimes, so don&#39;t feel bad if you hear nothing for a while, &#39;kay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; The boy nodded breathlessly, the caveat good enough for him, perhaps not expecting to even get half as much of a response. He glanced at Ethan&#39;s kid brother, eyes flicking over Eric from head to toe, who gave him a bright friendly smile in return. The boy smiled back timidly, as shy as he&#39;d been in the staff lounge, before he hurriedly excused himself. &quot;Thanks Ethan. I gotta go back to work now! Bye!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was gone as quickly as he appeared, and Ethan safely pocketed the slip of paper while they walked out to the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;That HAS to be the guy you flashed today, right? The one that thinks it was me who had a conversation with him completely naked?&quot; Ethan snorted. &quot;You must have made a really strong impression on him if he&#39;s giving me his number.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His name is Jesse.&quot; Eric was still smiling, the thoughts of the encounter coming back to him. &quot;He was the best part of today. I know he was scared talking to me like that, but I thought he was cool anyways.&quot; He lifted his hand with the ring on it, as an afterthought. &quot;Oh, I was waiting for us to be outside before doing this. I wanna ride home like ... this.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the last word, he concentrated for a moment, and then the crotch of his pants filled out, as it swelled back to the full borrowed size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s so much better,&quot; sighed Eric, feeling a strong sense of relief as he climbed into the passenger side of the car.<br />
<br />
Opposite, Ethan grunted and then breathed out in contentment as he shrank down in tandem, the sensation a truly welcome way to relax his state of mind as he drove. He only wished he had packed his kid underwear for the trip, thinking instead how much he wanted to unwind wearing them when he got home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it is,&quot; he replied, the brothers exchanging grins as they put on their seatbelts, and Ethan turned the key in the car ignition for the journey back.</p>
