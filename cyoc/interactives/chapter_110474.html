<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was around 1 A.M that Sam&#39;s mom Jessie woke him up. &quot;Honey, its time&quot; she said to her son. She left him alone to get ready for the big moment. Sam was to turn 13 this morning, the town that Sam and his Mother grew up in had a sacred traditon that envolved every Mother and there first born son once they reached their 13th year. The town had a mysterious magic to it that was created 500 years ago by mysterious entities. Since then the tradition had been kept alive and well with the citizens of the Town and was thought to bring great fortune to everyone who lived there. <br />
<br />
Sam wasnt sure weather or not he believed in such things, but he had seen this magic before with some friends of his who had performed this ritual themselfs, they told him how great it was and he longed to join them. Sam got out of bed and removed his pajamas and his underwear, he put on one of his moms plaid t-shirts that went down to his knees leaving nothing on under it.<br />
<br />
Sam was nervouse about tonight knowing his life was about to change forever but as he walked down the stairs and saw his mom sitting there, he felt much more relaxed.<br />
<br />
Jessie was wearing a blue dress that she put on prior to waking her son up. The only light in the room was from the bright full moon out side. As Sam came into the living room, Jessie could tell how nervous he was about the ritual, understandably so. She gave him a reasuring smile. &quot;Its going to be okay honey.&quot; She said taking his hand and leading him over to the middle of the living room under the circle of light from where the Moon shown through the window.She bent down and kissed him on the forehead, &quot; Remember, just like we&#39;ve been practicing.&quot; Jessie told her son. &quot;Yeah I got it.&quot; Sam said. <br />
<br />
Sam took his mothers hand and put his other arm around her waist and Jessie did the same. The Mother and Son began to slow dance under the moonlight, as they did, little glowing balls of light began to form around them and spin around with them. After a while the balls slowly began to enter Jessie, covering her entire body and causing her skin to glow. Sam looked up at his Mom&#39;s face in awe as the glowing made her look even more beautiful than she was. Jessie saw how her son looked at her making her blush and smile at her son as they contunued to slowly dance. <br />
&quot;You look so pretty mom!&quot; Said Sam blushing himself. Jessie placed a hand on her boys cheek and leaned closer to him and wispered &quot;an so will you be sweetie, close your eyes.&quot;Sam did so and Jessie kissed her son on the lips, Sam had never felt a more pleasurable feeling as the glowing balls exited out of his mom out through her mouth and into his. The balls covered his his body now and his skin started to glow. They glowed even brighter as Sam arched his back as his body began to levitate in the air. <br />
Jessie stood back and looked up at her son floating in the air. A bright light emmited from his body as he slowy began to grow bigger. His feet grew a few sizes larger as his toes grew bigger one by one, all of his body hair vanished as his legs became more shapely and he became several inches taller. His privates were visible now as they slowly shrank into him, rearranging into female genitalia. As his hips began to widen his rear bubbled forming into a cute heart shape, his spine cracked pushing his rear out further making it seem larger . His torso extendend longer as his stomach curved in nicely leaving a small bit of fat in the middle showing evidence of once being pregnant. His arms extended gaining some muscle on his once shinny arms, his hands became dainty and his fingers grew slimmer and longer. As Sam continued to age, two cones pushed out from under his nipples, the proceded to shake rapidly then one swelled like a balloon to a CC cup followed by the other. His coller bone popped out and his neck elongated, His hair changed from light blonde to dirt blonde and grew the the bottom of his neck. The final change took place as his face lengthend going from a young boys circle to a womanly oval. His facal features slowly changed into that of the woman who had given birth to him. The woman who was once his mother was now her twin sister as was tradition with this old town. <br />
<br />
The Changes ended as Samanthas body gently lowed to the ground as the glowing orbs left her body and flew out the window. Samantha laid on the ground still out from her transformation. Jessie went over to her new sister to check on her. Her blue shirt now fit her perfectly and her nether region was now fully exposed. Jessie had brought a whole wordrobe of new close for Sam a few weeks prior. Sam opened her eyed to the view of her sister smiling at her. Sam smiled back. &quot;Hi&quot; she said weakly. &quot;Come here sis&quot; Jessie said pulling Sam up and giving her new sister a big hug.</p>
