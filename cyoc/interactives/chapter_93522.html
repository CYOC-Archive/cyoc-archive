<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Though after waiting a few minutes when I finished breakfast, I figured Molly wasn&#39;t exactly waking up. After all, ever since she became a Human-Sphinx hybrid, Molly has been acting somewhat more.....differently than I remembered. So as I placed Molly&#39;s breakfast upon a food tray and carried her meal upstairs toward our bedroom, I began to reminisce as to what had occurred within the past few months while Molly and I were still adjusting to her transformation.<br />
<br />
Back when I just got Molly away from that messed-up Freak Show, the cops would not have believe me for even a second if it weren&#39;t for the fact that my girlfriend was transforming into a anthropomorphic version of a legendary mythological creature. <br />
<br />
At first, Molly was completely horrified at what she had become, seeing how I could still remember her crying into me while hugging me in a very tight manner. In the process, she kept questioning how could she ever be able to live a normal life, along with becoming truly scared of being sold and dissected by the government or worse. She was in that state of mind for over a week, and I felt really sorry for what she had been through.<br />
<br />
It took longer than expected, but Molly had finally calmed down.....to an extent, of course.She still felt really uncomfortable about going back to college, due to all the stares she had gotten from our classmates, whether it was from their own curiosity or disdain. And the paparazzi that kept following us wasn&#39;t exactly helping Molly either, dammit! <br />
<br />
However, it wasn&#39;t until two months ago that I began to notice some.....changes in my beloved Molly. I mean, this wasn&#39;t a physical change either, oh no. It could only be described in my opinion as.....supernatural.<br />
<br />
It first started when I began to hear Molly talk in her sleep. Originally, I shrugged it off as merely from her having nightmares, but it wasn&#39;t I was up late one night that I began to hear what she saying in her unconscious state, loud and clear. <br />
<br />
Now, I didn&#39;t know jack about what sort of language Molly was speaking in her sleep. However, I knew a few certain people who did. You see, several members of my family are expert archeologists, with both my mother and cousin Julia being professional Egyptologists. Though, since my own girlfriend had become a living bipedal version of a mythical creature from ancient Egypt, I figured that I would record what Molly was saying via tape recorder, then get it to where my mother and cousin work before they leave for a visit to Egypt&#39;s Valley of the Queens, where the wives of Egyptian Pharaohs were buried and laid to rest, along with many Egyptian princes and princesses.<br />
<br />
By now, both my mother and cousin Julia were already completely aware of Molly&#39;s condition, which pretty much blew their minds when they saw a real living Sphinx before them. Anyway, I visited them the next day at the museum where they work when they&#39;re not taking trips to Egypt. I showed them the recording to them, played it, and......well, let&#39;s just say that those two were in shock and awe. <br />
<br />
From what they told me, it sounds like Molly was speaking in Egyptian. However, this wasn&#39;t the modern Egyptian language, Molly was actually speaking in an ancient Egyptian language, only this was the version that could only be heard centuries before King Tut ever took up the throne as Pharaoh! Now that&#39;s scary! I wasn&#39;t sure what that Freak Show was using, but whatever it was, it was making Molly speaking a very dead language while she&#39;s sleeping.<br />
<br />
Though, it wasn&#39;t until Molly and I paid a visit to the hospital to have her get an x-ray, as well as having us pay my family a visit that we realize that Molly had become a legitimate Human-Sphinx hybrid. After all, the x-ray pictures showed multiple things, including a pair of fully functional wings, along with a set of paw-like hands and feet.<br />
<br />
Things got stranger around a month ago when we visited my mother and Julia when they had returned from Egypt&#39;s Valley of the Queens. Apparently, they brought back a truckload or two full of various artifacts for the museum&#39;s &quot;Valley of the Queens Exhibit&quot;, including one of the supposed daughters to Queen Nefertari, who was the first wife to Ramesses II AKA Ramesses The Great.<br />
<br />
However, one of the things they showed Molly and I was some sort of giant Sarcophagus, which was basically a big fancy coffin Pharaohs would use when they&#39;re being mummified for the afterlife. Surprisingly, when my mother and Julia first attempted to open it, the sarcophagi lid wouldn&#39;t even budge, as if someone welded it shut. It wasn&#39;t until Molly simply put a right paw-like hand on the side of the sarcophagi that the damn thing finally open, revealing what was inside; a mummified anthropomorphic sphinx. <br />
<br />
Obviously out of my own concern for her and godknowswhat else was going to spring to life, I decided that it was time for me and Molly, much to my mother&#39;s and Julia&#39;s disappointment. After all, I didn&#39;t want to know what would happen if Molly came into physical contact with the other artifacts in the museum, especially if said artifacts had originated from Egypt.<br />
<br />
Anyway, getting back to what was happening now, I slowly entered our bedroom with a tray full of breakfast in my hands. From the waist down, her digitgrade legs were covered in a thick coat of creamy white fur, with a tuft of her black fur on the tip of her tail. Though while her upper body still showed her newfound darker human skin, Molly had these paw-like hands, which were coated in the same colored fur, reaching halfway up her biceps, just as he used said paw-like hands to subconsciously away away near her newfound feline ears. In order to prevent from damaging her wings, Molly had to sleep on either her right or left side when sleeping.</p>
