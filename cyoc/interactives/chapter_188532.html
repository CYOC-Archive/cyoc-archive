<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Aaron where is everyone?” inquired a young Latino women as she walked out onto the deck and looked around, the boat was nearby but just floating there. She could smell the slow cooking pork shoulder that Sam was cooking but the entire place seamed abandoned. <br />
<br />
“Robert is on the boat, got some line stuck in the propeller so Zack and I swam back to shore.” Explained Aaron as he came up from behind her and grabbed her ass and gave it a playful squeeze as she yipped in surprise before playfully slapping his chest as he walked past. <br />
<br />
“What?” he inquired to his girlfriend of almost 5 years, Catalina or Cat for short was a beautiful sexy tomboyish woman. She was average height with dark hair she liked to color a wide range of strange colors, today was bright red and blue. It was cut in a short cut which while very short in the back had two longer bangs in the front which she styled after some anime character she loved. She was wearing a pink bikini bottom with a multicolored t-shirt over her chest. <br />
<br />
She played soccer for years, but her heart was her artwork and panting. That and mermaids, she had a large tattoo of a mermaid and the sea on her upper arm and she had a kink for doing it in a mermaid swimsuit. It was somewhat strange in his view, but she loved it and therefor he loved it for her.<br />
<br />
“You will play for that later.” said Catalina in Spanish as Aaron grinned back.<br />
<br />
“Can I pay for it now?” inquired Aaron back in Spanish as the two flirted a bit before going back to Catalina’s question.<br />
<br />
“Honestly I don’t know where everyone but Robert is.” Answered Aaron as he looked around and thought about it. “Wait…I take that back, Nate and Rose where talking about taking a walk before we left to go fishing and I think I saw them heading out while we were fishing.”<br />
<br />
“So that is Nate and Rose where is everyone else?” inquired a new voice as a shorter woman, with jet black hair pulled back into a long ponytail stepped out. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know, Azumi.” Answered Zack as the giant of a black man appeared behind his much shorter Japanese girlfriend. <br />
<br />
Azumi and Zack may look from the outside to be a strange couple but that was because you don’t often see a black man dating an Asian woman, however they where a perfect match. Both had strong drive for scholarly success, Azumi was on track to become a doctor with a full ride to medical school in Oxford England while Zack had a full grad school ride to Cambridge. Maybe that was what got Azumi’s traditionalist parents to accept Zack so fast even with the radically different backgrounds/cultures. <br />
<br />
It did help that like Zack Azumi was fit enough and good looking enough to be a model, her jet black silky smooth hair and what looked to be a perfect skin, a modest athletic frame and bust with an ass which everyone checked out. She was also very sharp and caught onto things most people missed.<br />
<br />
“Something strange is up.” stated Azumi as she looked around, her eyes focusing on the boat. “I don’t see Robert on the boat.”<br />
<br />
“Neither do I, strange.” Stated Zack as he moved toward the water, he dove in and quickly swam out to the boat and pulled himself up onto it as the three of them moved to the beach. <br />
<br />
“He isn’t here, he dropped the line and the propeller looks fixed but he isn’t here.” Yelled Zack from the boat.<br />
<br />
“Where the fuck is he?” inquired Aaron, Azumi and Cat had already pulled out their phones and were trying to call their friends, but no one was answering.<br />
<br />
By now Zack had pulled up the line and turned on the motor to bring the boat to the dock and Aaron walked over to help him tie it up. As he did, he let out a soft curse as he stopped and pulled a shell from his foot. He tossed it aside and helped Zack who he saw also had some blood on his foot.<br />
<br />
“What happened to you?” inquired Aaron<br />
<br />
“I stepped on something.” Answered Zack as they finished tying up the boat. “Where is everyone?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know.” Answered Aaron “Should we call the police?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe.” Answered Zack<br />
<br />
“Boys come over here!” yelled Azumi as the boys rushed over to find Cat holding up what looked like the remains of Amanda’s one-piece swimsuit, it looked like it had burst every seam and had broken apart. <br />
<br />
“Ok…now we should call the police.” Confirmed Zack<br />
<br />
“No, don’t do that.” Said a voice from behind as suddenly the two girls yipped in pain as they turned around pulling out what looked to be shells from their backs. Only to see a green haired mermaid lying in the surface. “We don’t want any more guests; I am almost out of transformation agent anyhow.”<br />
<br />
“A mermaid.” Said Cat in almost childlike wonder and joy, “I can’t believe mermaids are real.”<br />
<br />
“We are.” Confirmed the green haired mermaid as she looked toward the dock, they followed her eyes to see a merman with dark gold and orange scales pull himself up onto the dock. He had change, he was far fitter and more handsome but that was clearly Nate. Within seconds a red-tailed mermaid with bright red hair pulled herself up beside him, Rose. Next came a purple tailed mermaid, Taylor. Then to everyone’s amazement came a black tailed mermaid who introduced herself as the transformed Sam. Following her came a silver tailed bare breasted mermaid, Amanda followed by a brown and gold merman who looked extremely fit, Robert. All six of them looked happy, with Amanda almost sitting on Robert&#39;s lap and Nate, Rose, Taylor and now female Sam all sitting very tightly together and holding hands like some big couple.<br />
<br />
“My God, our friends are merfolk?” inquired Cat as she looked at the merfolk sitting on the dock, watching them like an audience.<br />
<br />
“And soon you will join them.” answered the Green Haired mermaid as all four looked down to see some scales on their bodies. “Your transformation has already begun, accept the sea and a new life within it and help remake our society.”</p>
