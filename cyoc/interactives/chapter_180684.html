<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam: Day 4 of 7<br />
Jackson: Day 8 of 14<br />
<br />
Jackson White had woken up that morning to find that something inexplicably felt different. There was a sense of oddity in heading to school - like it was something he was just not meant to be doing. But after a bit of reminding himself why he got up in the first place, Jackson started getting ready. And damn near freaked out when he saw the reflection of himself in the mirror. His hair was still shaved down as he remembered from the last night. But now he could see some outright wrinkles near his eyes - crow&#39;s feet? Laugh lines? Was that a wrinkle on his brow too?<br />
<br />
Jackson outright went ahead and borrowed some of his dad&#39;s wrinkle cream, seeing as his dad was already out at work. He needed to cover this up for now until he could find a more permanent solution. It was also completely fucking terrifying. Teenagers didn&#39;t get wrinkles overnight like that! He was left wondering why it was he was suddenly picking up something like that.<br />
<br />
But it seemed the wrinkle cream was doing the job nicely. When he applied it and rubbed it in, Jackson could barely see his wrinkles any more. There we go, he thought to himself, and went ahead with his plan from last night. He shaved off the remaining patches of hair from his head, leaving him with an appealing looking bald head - at least to him - and grinned for the reflection. Yeah, yeah, Jackson White was still the hottest guy in his class. Muscles looking big this morning.<br />
<br />
When Jackson went to flex and feel his muscles, he also realized he may need an extra shower or some new gels. His skin felt oddly weathered today. Maybe it was just all the time he spent running around in the field as a football player. Yeah, that&#39;d explain it. Still, he needed to take better care. He got his lunch together and headed out, dressed in a stringer tank and pants, shaking his head briefly as he thought about the &quot;oddity&quot; of heading to school.<br />
<br />
What oddity? Jackson told himself. I&#39;m a teenager. Of course I&#39;m heading to school!<br />
<br />
With that he joined the crowd of teens heading off toward high school.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Sam meanwhile had had a rather raucous morning.<br />
<br />
He woke up at roughly five in the morning, feeling hot and weird. His manhood was sticking up, proud and strong and erect. Yet oddly a little thinner than usual. And his skin seemed more tan today than usual. But that was all so ephemeral when he was so dimly aware. Sam vaguely remembered wrapping a hand around his cock and beating off - once and then twice, spattering cum all over his chest and abdomen before falling asleep again.<br />
<br />
Sam then woke up at his usual time, with a languid smirk on his face. His manhood was hard again. A quick beat session relieved the tension, and Sam briefly realized how odd it was he was this horny. Maybe he needed Sasha to give him a nice quick BJ at school. He looked at his mirror by his bed and saw something odd. His spiked up blond dyed in hair looked brighter blond than usual, nearly platinum blond. And his features looked...off. He couldn&#39;t say how. Vaguely asian? He looked kinda like a JPop Star, now that he thought about it.<br />
<br />
He smirked to himself.<br />
<br />
Maybe he could get a regular cornucopia of women if he showed up looking like this. He noted he was slightly thinner, but retained his muscular tone and powerfully built legs. Yeah, accentuating all the nice qualities of being a soccer player. Sam ran a hand over his chest and mimed singing into a mic for a crowd.<br />
<br />
He halted when he realized he had to get out there. He couldn&#39;t exactly enjoy his crowd if he was stuck at home working himself off all day long.<br />
<br />
Dressing in a tighter shirt and glossy black pants he didn&#39;t even remember anyone getting for him, Sam quickly ate his breakfast and headed out. He was easily appeased by the way that the girls around school seemed to like looking at him. Though it didn&#39;t seem quite as important as usual. Maybe it was just a given, he figured.<br />
<br />
Later on during the day, Sam ended up seeing Jackson White, and his jaw almost dropped. Jackson was so...mature. He didn&#39;t know where the vibe really came from. Guy was dressed as he usually was. Maybe it was the shaved head. Maybe it was the crazy ripped body. But Sam realized he was gawking and really feeling a weird way toward Jackson. Was he...? No, no way. Sam was not a gay guy, no way no how! Sam loved the ladies, and the ladies loved Sam. Obviously.<br />
<br />
But there was undeniably something about Jackson. Fuck, Sam needed to talk to him. Just...talk to him, deal with the tension a bit.</p>
