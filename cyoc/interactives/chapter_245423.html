<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer whined as she watched her body transform, her feet quickly bursting her one sock as they grew large, slender and sharp. Her toes forming together as sharp talons scrapped the wooden floor as she flexed her new appendages. They gained a rough yellow coloring as it quickly rolled up her calves, and up to the middle of her high before tapering off. With a audible crack Jennifer fell over as her legs became ditigrade, her legs now just like a birds. The feeling radiated upwards as her clothes faded away, revealing everything that was changing, her hair was fading away, now replaced with grey plumage, her once tamed and manicured pubes exploding into a puff of soft down. Her body grew thinner as her waist tightened and her large breasts were reduced to barely a B cup. Jennifer gawked in horror as the feeling reached her upper body, her arms thinning out and her fingers disappearing as they were morphed into large wings, a small spanning bursted from her rear as she gained a tail. Trying to feel her face was hard now without fingers, her wings awkwardly rubbing against her face. She didn&#39;t feel anything different, she was fearing she might have gotten a beak, though her hair had changed, now long trailing feathers that ran down her back and two feathers drapped over each shoulder. Jennifer flapped her wings as she struggled to stand up, it was like trying to stand up without arms, using her bed as leverage she was able to get back on her feet, er, talons.<br />
<br />
Jennifer spied across the room, everything had changed, everything was considerably shorter, her table now the height of a foot locker, her dresser now only the two bottom most drawers. Jennifer looked at her closet, it was nothing but simple one piece dresses. Jennifer poked the corner of her wing to riffle through them, each one was sleeveless with large arm holes, easy guess to what that was, and on the back had a large loop at the neck. Jennifer looked around and saw on corner of her closet was a similar sized hook. Without a way to grab her clothes and take them off, they must have used the hook loop to slide out of their clothes everyday, probably why there wasn&#39;t anything else, like underwear, it would just be too hard to put on without hands.<br />
<br />
Jennifer whimpered as she started to realize her new limitations, fumbling with the dress as she used her talons to pick it up and set it on the rack, fiddling with getting it over her head she was able to squirm her way into it fairly easily actually once she understood what to do.<br />
<br />
Spinning around a few times she didn&#39;t really care for it, it felt way too breezy and revealing. Her shoes on the other hand were completely different, she didn&#39;t expect to really have any at all given her talons, but these were basically normal sneakers. Looking inside Jennifer saw a padded bar, around the top was a wide tube sock stitched in. Raising her eyebrow she slowly dipped her talon into the shoe, grabbing the bar. The sock tightening around her ankle softly. It was like if she was sitting on a branch almost, her sharp talons unable to pierce or scrap the floor anymore, most likely their core function. <br />
<br />
To give any credit to the curses power, its ability to rewrite reality was definitely impressive in its detail. Wait reality? Jennifer let out a yell as she tried to walk, her body not used to moving around like this.&quot;Mom?&quot; Jennifer cried out as she opened her door. The stairs were replaced with little wooden pegs, Jennifer hesitated as she slipped on the first peg, instinctually opening her wings, she found herself easily gliding down.<br />
<br />
Her mom, or what was once her mom was squatting down at a table at knee height as her wings were tucked at her side. &quot;Morning sweety.&quot; Her mother nodded. &quot;You&#39;re just in time for breakfast.&quot; A series of bowls of seed and fruits were already set, alot more than just for the two of them. A sudden flutter of wings as Jennifer saw a flock descend on her. Three harpies fluttered around her as they started to laugh. &quot;Look Jennifer didn&#39;t see us coming this morning!&quot; One exclaimed. &quot;Ha! Got you today!&quot; Another yelled. Their wings pushed Jennifer to the floor as one of the harpies immediately reached her head into Jennifers open dress. Jennifer was wildly flapping her arms. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; She yelled out in confusion. She felt a warm sensation as she looked down as one of the harpies had began to lick her pussy. &quot;M-mom help!&quot; <br />
<br />
Her mother tapped her claws on the wood. &quot;Ok girls, stop trying to make your sister lay an egg.&quot; The trio all stopped as they whined &quot;Aw come on mom, we had her this time, she was really gonna do it!&quot; they protested, the three hovering as they all picked out a seat. Jennifer laid in a daze trying to piece the scene together, she had....sisters? When? What happened? Jennifer was so confused.<br />
<br />
The trio of girls looked back at Jennifer laid there, her mom saying. &quot;Come on Jennifer, get some food before your sisters take it all.&quot; Jennifer leaned forward as she gasped. One of the girls pointing with her wing &quot;Look she&#39;s gonna do it!&quot; The trio laughing as Jennifer looked down her stomach rising from under her dress. Jennifer gasped as she tried to grab her stomach with her wings to no avail, the size continued to grow until it looked as if she was four months pregnant. The girls lept from the table as they surrounded her again each poking and prodding Jennifer as she began to breath heavily, her stomach continuing to grow, now looking as if she was six months pregnant. A pressure building as Jennifer cried out, the feeling of something hard beginning to force its way out of her vagina. The girls all staring at her, &quot;Ooooh, aaaah&quot; they shattered to themselves as Jennifers egg tapped the floor, her stomach deflating. Jennifer panting, seeing the new large speckled egg rolling to its side between her legs. &quot;W-what was tha- augh!&quot; Jennifer moaned again as she saw her stomach begin to rise for a second time. One of her sisters turning her head around. &quot;MOM! Jennifers in a egg trance!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother finally standing up to fly to her daughter. &quot;Get me some cold water, this is why we don&#39;t play around.&quot; Her mother looked down at Jennifer. &quot;Jenni, you need to calm down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was still worked up, &quot;Whats a egg tranc-&quot; her voice cut off as she could feel a second egg crowning.<br />
<br />
As the egg slipped free a bucket of ice cold water dumped on top of her as she yelped in shock. In that period the feeling didn&#39;t return as Jennifer sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sweety you know harpies make eggs when they are aroused, if they get stuck bring aroused from laying an egg though, they get stuck in a trance where they keep making eggs.&quot; Her mother explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jennifer expressed in genuine confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, it can usually go on for hours, I saw one go for a whole day once, but usually we just get tired after a few, but I don&#39;t want you late for school.&quot; Her mother stood up. &quot;Anyways, I want you to put that energy to finding a human.&quot; She let out a laugh.<br />
<br />
What kind of game is that to be played with by her sisters? The cultural changes, let alone the biological were getting too confusing. Jennifer stood up with a flap of her wings, the two eggs rocking on the floor. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about the eggs, I&#39;ll handle them after you leave.&quot; Her mother said. &quot;Oh, ok.&quot; Jennifer replied softly.<br />
<br />
Breakfast, past the beginning was its own awkward affair, without any silverware or similar tools, everyone leaned down to grab food with their mouths, Jennifer was slow to try it, but ultimately through peer pressure was forced to have her breakfast. If this was just her family, what was school? The world? Jennifers mind was firing on all cylinders as her brain scrambled to come up with answers.</p>
