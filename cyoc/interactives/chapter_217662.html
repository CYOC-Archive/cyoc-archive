<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott looked at Jeff, wondering what was wrong.  Jeff wanted to excuse himself, but was just barely hiding his boner with his arms crossed in his lap.  There was no way he could get up and walk to the sinks to splash cold water on his face.   “I’m just feeling a little hot.  All the excitement I guess.”<br />
<br />
“Okay buddy,” Scott squeezed his friend’s shoulder.  Jeff didn’t know if he had convinced Scott or not, but it didn’t matter now – he wasn’t pressing his concern, at least.<br />
<br />
“I don’t understand something,” Jeff said to Willis.  The agent reminded him of those classically handsome older guys you always see in movies playing agents; Hollywood got the type thing down.  “If the Chronivac reverts a person back to who they were before the transformation, then how could Scott go from being gay to being straight?  I mean, I know you kinda had a theory, but it doesn’t really explain anything – it doesn’t really mean he’s reverted, even though ‘gay’ or ‘straight’ was never even part of the equation for his changes… So what’s that all about?”<br />
<br />
“Things do in very rare instances go wrong, and sometimes even unexpected changes can happen,” Willis responded.  “And yes, sometimes a person can change back and yet be different from the experience somehow.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes wandered to Scott while Willis was talking.  The jock was so big and strong, his body so muscular.  His pecs were large, attractive bulges with nipples sticking out even when his shirt was on, and the younger boy found himself transfixed on the older boy more and more.  Knowing that hairy chest was underneath the shirt fabric made Jeff want to squeal.  “So sometimes reverting doesn’t pull the person out of the transformation all the way?”<br />
<br />
“On those extremely rare occasions there can be issues,” Willis confessed.  “That’s why I asked Scott if feeling like he’s straight now bothered him.  I don’t think whatever he’s experiencing is necessarily due to the Chronivac changes.”<br />
<br />
“But it could be?” Jeff interrupted.<br />
<br />
“Well… yes, it is possible,” Willis admitted.  “There can be possible interactions, which can get very complicated.  If it bothered him, I could use the Chronivac to make him gay again – that’s if he is even really straight, but it’s possible it could be a passing feeling - emotions are very fluid, after all.  But it can get a little tricky, because if this is simply his real self – be it a temporary state or not – then we’d be changing him to something other than who he really is.”<br />
<br />
“But tricky how?” Jeff persisted.<br />
<br />
“Let’s say it’s a temporary state, and tomorrow he would wake up feeling his usual self.  Using the Chronivac to make him gay today could impact on his personality tomorrow when he would have woken up feeling normal again.  It could make him &#39;more gay&#39; than before, and have a big impact on who he is, how he acts and thinks.”<br />
<br />
“But isn’t that what the Chronivac does anyway?” Scott this time.  “Impact who someone is?”<br />
<br />
“Well, yes,” Willis said thoughtfully, “But it’s a little more complicated than that when we get into base-line personality, human development, and even the various iterations of the software and Chronivac itself.”<br />
<br />
“How did you undo permanent changes?  I was a sow, and he was a bitch, and the user made it forever in my case, irreversible.”  Jeff started feeling a little more settled, but he couldn’t deny he felt a definite physical attraction to Scott.  And though he tried denying it even to himself, in truth he wanted to be a sow again.  But he had to force himself to think about other things now, to keep himself occupied, so that he could remain in control.  “How do you undo what can’t be undone?  And how do you know it’s really undone, or can I wake up tomorrow squealing with big boobs again?”  Jeff had to put it quickly out of his mind, nearly shivering in pleasure at his own mere mention of it.<br />
<br />
“Are you feeling different than before?” Willis asked Jeff point-blank.<br />
<br />
“Well, I mean what if I woke up next week – who’s to say I wouldn’t feel different then, and how can we know it’s not the Chronivac?”<br />
<br />
“In your case, the Chronivac used was a newer model than the five you had, that’s why it sparked and vanished with the change,” Willis explained, his face inscrutable.<br />
<br />
“Wait, I thought the fives Scott and I had were the newest version available,” Jeff injected.<br />
<br />
“To the general public, yes,” Willis said plainly.  “But the one used to sow you and bitch Scott was a newer model that wasn’t authorized for general release – that’s why we had to get involved, and had to undo the changes that unauthorized model had made.”<br />
<br />
Jeff got the sense Willis was holding something crucial back.  “But that doesn’t explain how you could undo an irreversible change, or how you know it’s really reversed.”<br />
<br />
“We have a more advanced model agents use, which enables us to undo permanent changes.  And the chances that a revert isn’t 100% successful are nearly infinitesimal.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded in understanding, but he got the definite sense this time that Willis wasn’t just being cagy, but that they had just been told a lie.  He couldn’t put his finger on why, but he trusted his gut.  He didn’t sense that Willis was trying to con them, just that he had covered something up – perhaps in the name of ‘protecting’ them.  Jeff saw Scott glance at him - those beautiful, sparkly eyes made his heart flutter looking at him.  But Jeff knew in that moment that the older boy knew they had just been lied to, as well.  Then Jeff also saw a worried look in Scott’s eyes – he hadn’t bought Jeff’s dismissal of any problem, after all.<br />
<br />
Willis was observing Jeff.  “It’s really important you’re honest with me.  If this is one of those almost nonexistent instances, it’s extremely important we fix it.”<br />
<br />
Jeff felt Willis’ steel grey eyes penetrating his own, as if assessing and summing him up.  It felt invasive, cold, despite his overall ‘friendly’ demeanor.  He suddenly got a strong feeling not to say anything.  Maybe he was just embarrassed by his transformation into a fat sow, and the humiliation of it.  Or maybe his gut had a sense that Willis couldn’t be trusted.  Jeff didn’t know which it was, for sure.<br />
<br />
“Do you feel any lingering effects or differences from the Chronivac transformations, Jeff?”<br />
<br />
Jeff felt the pressure of both Scott’s and Willis’ eyes on him now, feeling like a deer caught in headlights.  He suddenly wanted nothing more than to let loose squealing and suck on cock, guzzling cum until his body bloated to its previous size.  This time the desire screamed in his mind, and it took all of his strength and control to hold it in check.  “No,” he answered calmly, then smiled, doing his best to dispel both of their concerns.  He lied like his life depended on it.  “I feel perfectly normal.  I just wanted to be sure, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, Jeff,C Willis smiled at the boy.  “In that case, I think we’re done here.”  He handed the boys two new wrist units.  “These are to replace the Chronivacs that were erased by the unauthorized incursion.  There is an added menu item that will contact me directly, should you have any problems.”<br />
<br />
The boys took the new wrist units.<br />
<br />
“Please use it if you have any problems.”<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t wait to be alone.  He somehow felt dirty, as if he had somehow soiled himself.  Which triggered pig squeals filling his mind.  Somehow he managed to get out of the situation without giving himself away.  But he couldn&#39;t wait to use the Chronivac on himself.  He couldn&#39;t resist the piggish urges much longer.<br />
<br />
Scott caught Jeff alone in the hallway outside the locker room.  Jeff could tell by the look in Scott&#39;s eyes he knew something was very wrong.  And worse, Jeff felt his control slipping fast at the jock&#39;s touch.</p>
