<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So,&quot; a familiar singsong voice exclaims,&quot;You were the Chosen One all along.&quot;<br />
Princess Aliya and Geoffery are approaching you. Both of them have a look of shock <br />
on their faces and are regarding you much differently. Geoffery especially seems more <br />
submissive and gets on one knee, bowing his head. <br />
&quot;My liege,&quot; he addresses you formally,&quot;Please forgive my gross assumption that you <br />
were not trustworthy. I was paranoid of spies and did not make a good judgement. I <br />
am sorry.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; you say, still shocked,&quot;I forgive you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Terel told us of your duty,&quot; Aliya informed you,&quot;We are to guide you to our troops and <br />
you will command them to victory over Ulnok. But, as I mentioned, we were hoping to <br />
talk to Prince Leoric. Would you mind the detour?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh, no, not at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your strange trio of anthro raccoons walked quitely through the woods. You knew it <br />
was dark long ago, but you could see as clearly as if it were day. You smelled <br />
everything, even Aliya's oddly minty breath five yards ahead of you. You heard every <br />
noise around you, every cricket, every breath of wind. All your new senses were <br />
making you dizzy. You tried to take your mind off of these new sensations by <br />
practicing with your powers again. You enlisted Geoffery to throw rocks randomly at <br />
you. You never felt a single one, but you could hear them hit behind you, and by the <br />
direction of the sound, you knew he hadn't missed. However, when Geoffery sent a <br />
quite large stone through your already queesy gut, you decided that was enough. You <br />
had definitely felt it slide through you. It was as if someone had pushed it through one <br />
side and out the other, though it was not painful, just extremely weird. You pulled on <br />
your fingers to pop them and found your left thumb in your right hand. There was no <br />
blood, no pain, and you could still control it. You replaced your thumb and tried your <br />
entire left arm. Though his fur was a dark chesnut, you could have sworn he turned <br />
white when you crawled your severed arm onto Geoffery's shoulder. He shook it off <br />
and you collapsed in laughter, your ghost arm pounding on the ground. You could see <br />
that Aliya was disturbed too, but she couldn't help but stop and laugh at the look of <br />
terror on Geoffery's face. You brought your arm back and reattached it, still in a fit of <br />
giggling. <br />
&quot;Consider that payback for scaring the shit out of me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fair enough,&quot; he agreed, still stricken. <br />
Poor Geoffery had suffered enough so you moved on to teleporting. The feeling is that <br />
of being forcefully pulled and becoming a smoky vapor before rematerializing and <br />
coming to a sudden halt. You teleport between Geoffery and Aliya, playing the child's <br />
trick of tapping them on one side then teleporting to the other. You move from ground <br />
to tree branch to ditch to log to stump and back to the group. Feeling comfortable with <br />
that, you practiced shapeshifting. First a bush, then a boulder; next Geoffery, finally <br />
Aliya. The emptiness between your legs and the weight on your chest was not as <br />
weird as you thought it should have been. Finally, you change back into yourself and <br />
practice with fire. The producing of the flames was not hard, but controlling them was. <br />
You nearly set the forest ablaze three times before grasping the concept. You found <br />
you could mix teleporting with fire and leave a flaming trail between your origin and <br />
destination.<br />
&quot;Sorry if I'm annoying you,&quot; you apologize after the fourth brush fire put out,&quot;But this is <br />
amazing!&quot;<br />
You hadn't tried possessing anyone yet, but you didn't want to bother Geoffery or <br />
Aliya. <br />
<br />
After hours of walking, Aliya turned and said,&quot;Up ahead is the Castle Drakken, home <br />
of Prince Leoric Flamewind, ruler of the dragons.&quot;<br />
&quot;He is our current military leader,&quot; Geoffery informed you,&quot;But he will happily answer to <br />
the Chosen One.&quot;<br />
You weren't sure that a powerful dragon would want to give up his rank to an <br />
inexperienced raccoon, but you did not voice your doubts. Instead, you asked,&quot;Not to <br />
be ignorant, but if you have dragons as allies, why are you still being oppressed by <br />
Ulnok?&quot;<br />
&quot;He is not stupid,&quot; Aliya answered,&quot;He attacked the dragons first, and by surprise, <br />
killing or injuring a lot of their warriors. There are maybe 50 adult dragons left and only  <br />
about half of them are able to fight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; you remark, feeling stupid.<br />
<br />
The castle is huge and formidable, a collosal fort of power and protection. As you <br />
approach, an anthro bronze dragon guard hails you in an Old English accent,&quot;Who <br />
approacheth the gate of Castle Drakken?&quot;<br />
&quot;Princess Aliya of the Lotors, I seek an audience with Prince Leoric of the Eudracons.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; the gaurd said in a flirting voice,&quot;the masked mistress, always a pleasure <br />
m'lady.&quot;<br />
Geoffery growled a warning at the overstepping gaurd. <br />
&quot;Unless you want your wings as my boots, I'd suggest you watch your tone,&quot; he <br />
threatened. <br />
&quot;Temper, temper,&quot; the gaurd teased,&quot;You are permitted to enter.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you, kind dragon,&quot; Aliya responded,&quot;And calm yourself, Geoffery.&quot;<br />
He merely growled again. <br />
<br />
Inside, they entered a long hall lit by inviting candelabras. A large throne upon which <br />
an even larger anthro dragon was seated sat in the middle of the far end. The dragon <br />
was unmistakeably Prince Leoric. His midnight black body was enourmous and rippled <br />
with muscles. His blue robes and tunic showed a small patch of his orange chest <br />
scales the same color as his leathery wings. His clubbed and spiked tail hung beside <br />
him and swung lazily back and forth. His serpentine head was crowned by three ivory <br />
horns as well as the gold headpiece.<br />
&quot;Welcome, Princess Aliya,&quot; he asked in a deep, gravelly, yet rich voice,&quot;What can I do <br />
for you?&quot;<br />
&quot;We had come to ask for passage to the main camp,&quot; she began.<br />
&quot;But?&quot; Leoric questioned. <br />
&quot;We came acrossn one other than the Chosen One!&quot; You stepped forward to show <br />
yourself. Leoric immediately stood up to see for himself. He was even more imposing <br />
while standing. <br />
&quot;You're sure he is the Chosen One?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Aliya confirmed,&quot;Terel told us himself and we saw his transformation.&quot;<br />
Leoric then did as Geoffery did earlier, dropping to one knee and bowing his head. <br />
&quot;My liege, I am Prince Leoric Flamewind of the Eudracons at your service, Sir...&quot;<br />
&quot;Kristofer Wolfsbane,&quot; you say immediately. Wait, that wasn't right. But Terel's voice <br />
echoes in your head,{I thought that would be a more appropriate last name.} You <br />
actually kind of liked it, so you went along with it. <br />
&quot;Well, Sir Wolfsbane, I am honored to meet you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; you say,&quot;Call me Kris.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir Kris.&quot; Not what you had meant, but oh well. &quot;Well, it is late, I was just <br />
heading to bed myself. I shall have the guest rooms made and we shall talk in the <br />
morning, if that's all right with you.&quot;<br />
You all agreed and were shown to three sepereate suites all next to each other. First <br />
Aliya, then Geoffery, then yours. It was not very big, but it was lavishly decorated and <br />
it had its own bathroom. You washed up and headed for bed. You usually slept in the <br />
nude, but decided to leave your underwear on. After all the recent events, you quickly <br />
fell asleep on the plushy bed.</p>
