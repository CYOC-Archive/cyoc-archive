<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...that my body was perfectly suited for this kind of thing, and that I could always escape from this gear somehow whenever I wanted to&quot; panted Drake. <br />
<br />
&quot;YOUR WISH IS GRANTED!&quot; declared the genie as he returned to the lamp. <br />
<br />
Drake felt her body start to slightly shift at various parts. For one thing, she no longer was sweaty, and qctually felt rather comfortable, temperature wise. She also no longer felt restricted by the corset, and after examining as to why, she found it was simply because it had vanished. Her body was now naturally shaped as if she was wearing it. Surprisingly, she also no lomger had any issue with standing on all fours, and could actually move around with ease. &quot;Hmm. Well, I am this far into it, no sense in quitting now&quot; reasoned Drake as she picked up the lamp and put it into her bag with just using her mouth. From their she lifted the bag and tossed it over her shoulder and onto her back, as it now became more like a saddle bag than a backpack. With the lamp and her items all set to go, Drake began &quot;galloping&quot; out of the girl&#39;s locker room with unprecedented speeds. Shs had never moved so fast before. Her body had now been optimised for running on all fours, and with hooves she reasoned. <br />
<br />
As if she had some kind of internal GPS, she knew exactly where Ethan was and how to reach him in the shortest amount of time. Even now as she was going her fastest on the sidewalk, she knew hundreds of glares and stares were pinpointed at her, but Drake no longer cared. She was meeting up with her master, so how could anything as worthless as the stares and judgments of nameless onlookers slow her down? The blinders on the bridle helped her to block out most of them too as she wasn&#39;t immune to the sting of embarrassment they caused her. It just wasn&#39;t enough to slow her down as meeting up with master was a much higher priority for her than preserving her own dignity. <br />
<br />
It was only now that she noticed her new mentality. And as if he was waiting for a queue, the genie&#39;s voice sounded inside of her head. &quot;MISTRESS ASKED FOR A BODY THAT WAS PERFECTLY SUITED FOR &#39;THIS KIND OF THING&#39;. SO NOW SHE UAS THE BODY OF NOT JUST A PERFECT WOMAN DRESSED AS A PONYGIRL, BUT IS NOW LITERALLY PART HORSE IN ORDER TO FIT AS MUCH OF THE CRITERIA COVERED UNDER THE VAGUE EXPRESSION OF &#39;THIS KIND OF THING&#39;. THE CHANGE IN MENTALITY IS ONLY NATURAL AS YOUR BODY&#39;S CHEMICAL REACTIONS WHICH CAUSE YOUR EMOTIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN FINE TUNED TO BEST SUIT YOUR NEW ROLE.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake contemplated the meaning of his words as she continued moving at her fastest pace yet. What did he mean by saying that I am now literally part horse? Was he speaking about how I now fit a quadropeddle lifestyle way better than a bipedal one, or is there something else that I am missing to comprehend? Perhapse under all of this gear and leather, some more changes happened which I was not fully aware of? <br />
<br />
As Drake thought, she arived at the home of Ethan. While they origionally planed on meeting at the place, what kind of sad excuse for a ponygirl arives without her Master or Mistress? Not her at least. She was a perfect ponygirl after all. She slowed her pace down to a gental trot and headed over to the garage where she managed to open up the side door with her mouth and slip inside. The first thing she noticed was that what normally would have been a 2 car garage had been partially converted into a barn with a single horse stall. She had known that Ethan had joked one time and claimed that he had created a space for the woman of his dreams to live with him comfortably, but was all this set up really just for her? Drake admittedly felt a bit touched even. She made her way into the stall and unburdened herself of her pack, being extra careful to hide the lamp out of sight. She even grabbed clumps of hay with her mouth to make a small pile to cover over it. Satisfied with her work, she undid the rest of here gear as well, meticulously placing each piece on their proper hook or organizing them neatly on the nearby table. When she was finally free of every piece, she turned to look in the huge mirror along one of the walls. And what she saw surprised her greatly.<br />
<br />
Reflected back was the face of a very cute asian girl. Not only that, but one with a longer neck than what normal humans had. It wasnt long like a real horse, but it was a good few inches more than normal. Her other unnoticed changes were her new very real tail, her horse asshole, and her mare pussy. And now that she looked back at it, the dildo that had come out from her pussy had indeed been horsecock shaped instead of a normal human cock. Next thing she examined were her hands. As she had expected, they were all but useless now. Even though they were not real hooves, they had long sinced creased being hands. She had no feeling in any of her fingers, which had apparently been solidified somehow in the perfect positions and angles in order to form a hoof shaped inprint when she took a step. Even the skin had apparently began to merge together, sealing her fingers permanently to her palms. On the plus side, her wrists seemed to be much stronger now, almost as if they were specifically remade to be her second set of ankles with some kind of surgery. Her feet were in a similar situation as well, with her ankles apparently now fixed in such a way that forced her to stand up on the tips of her toes, which all had been fused together to form another set of &quot;hooves&quot;. <br />
<br />
Moving on to her boobs, they still hung down from her chest, only now with 2 and a half inch long teats instead of normal nipples, however she noticed an additional set of breasts just above her groin area. With 2 more nipples sticking out of 2 small mounds. &quot;Ha, I even have a mare&#39;s udder!&quot; Drake laughed to herself, although it was more out of pure disbelief rather than humor. How could Master be so... eccentric, in what was his idea of his dream woman? &quot;I mean seriously Master, I&#39;m not even entirely human anymore. Hell, I can&#39;t even remember Master&#39;s real name.&quot; <br />
<br />
She walked away from the mirror and over to the trough near the opposite wall and easily began drinking the water as if she were a natural. After her drink, she opened the lamp with her mouth and made another wish. &quot;I wish that I had a properly fitting evening gown for my date with Master tonight. And I wish that tonight&#39;s date would go flawlessly well for the both of us. Oh, and while this isn&#39;t a wish, would it be possible for you to turn your lamp into some kind of accessory that I could wear? Like a pendant, earring, or maybe even an anklet?&quot;<br />
<br />
The genie appeared once again to answer her summons. &quot;I HAVE GRANTED BOTH OF YOUR WISHES MISTRESS WITHOUT ANY ISSUE. AS FOR THE SHAPE OF MY LAMP. THAT IS DO-ABLE, HOWEVER I MAY ONLY KEEP IT LIKE THAT FOR A SHORT WHILE, NO MORE THAN 6 HOURS AT MOST OR RISK SHATTERING THE LAMP DUE TO IT BEING TOO SMALL TO CONTAIN ALL OF MY MAGICAL POWERS.&quot; At the end of his short warning, the genie returned to his lamp, which then had a thin golden band with a ring loop that attached itself around the handle of the lamp appear. The entire lamp and band shrunk down until the lamp was around the size of a quarter. The band then flew through the air and wrapped itself snugly around Drakes neck, becoming a decorative choker. It was not exactly what she had imagined, but chokers were in right now right? Either way, she felt that it suited her new form rather nicely. Suddenly she heard the side door start to open up behind her. She quickly panicked and wished that she was fully dressed and ready to go before the door opened. The genie granted her wish just in time as the moment the door opened up wide, Drake was now patiently waiting her Master&#39;s arival, dressed fully in an elegant black and gold evening gown. The back end of it seemed to account for her tail, as it was stuck through a small gap in the fabric. And the front of the dress created a rather interesting view due to her breasts hanging underneath her body now, the design more or less gave everyone an unobstructed view down the top of her dress. With the gown being backless, it meant that just only her bare skin was underneath her saddle, which was fixed in place with a few straps. Her &quot;hindlegs&quot; and &quot;forelegs&quot; as they were closer to resembling, had been placed back into a set of bondage hoof boots, only now they were of a much more fationable design that matched her outfit. <br />
<br />
Her hair, which now resembled more of a well groomed main, was swept elegantly over to her right side. Her exposed left ear had even been pierced in several spots, one of which now contained a dangling style earring with a small gemstone. It really was rather too formal for a ponygirl to have adorned, but her Master would love it though. Her bridal that now had a dark golden sheen too, was already in place save for the bit. The last thing she realized was that she was horny. Not to a crazy level, but enough to be noticable at mostly all times. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, does that mean something perhapse?&quot; Drake wondered to herself as the door opened, revealing her long anticipated Master in his own set of nice looking clothes that caused Drake to find him looking very handsome. She didn&#39;t forget to bow her head down as a sign of her complete submission towards him.<br />
<br />
Ethan on the other hand, was infact, very much conflicted over what he saw.</p>
