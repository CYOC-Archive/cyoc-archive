<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was  a nice sunny day with a slight breeze, a fantastic day for relaxing in the park. Christy had woken up early jubilant for the outing she had planned for the day. Chasity would be so happy, and they could reconnect and rebuild their old friendship. With a picnic basket in hand, Christy left her home a quarter before lunch, so that she would arrive right on time to meet with Chasity.<br />
<br />
The cheerleader spotted Chasity sitting alone on a bench. She looked like she was deep in thought with her eyes closed and arms crossed. She was dressed in a white flowing sundress that came down to her thighs, along with a sun hat, and heels. She also had her purse on her lap conveniently covering up the bulbous addition that Christy gave her at the festival. In all, she looked like she was ready for a nice date. <br />
<br />
Sneaking behind the brunette, Christy prepared to surprise her, but as the cheerleader sneaked closer, Chasity spoke up, “I know you’re behind me Christy. Your tricks were old before we entered high school.”<br />
<br />
“Surprise, you got me again! It’s been forever since we hung out. I hope there’s no hard feelings for the other day,” Christy waltzed to the other side of the bench to cheerfully greet the clearly annoyed girl.<br />
<br />
“Cut the chatter, Christy,” Chastity snapped, “Whatever you’ve done to me, I want it to be fixed. I’m not asking, I’m demanding that you turn me back to normal, and leave me alone afterwards.” The seated girl clutched her purse furiously, holding it tighter against her crotch.<br />
<br />
“Well that wasn’t very nice,” Christy ignored the outburst. She could understand that being caged with no decent way of abating the overwhelming arousal would make a person ill-tempered, “Calm down girl, you’re gonna blow a fuse. Hum, ok how&#39;s this plan, you hang out with me for today, and I’ll turn you back by the end of it. To throw a cherry on top, I’ll give you an upgrade, any change you want to your body, and some friendly advice about your, ‘boyfriend.’”<br />
<br />
That deal was too good to be true, knowing Christy, she was planning something, Chastity was sure of it, “No, I’m not playing anymore games, Christy. Just turn me back to normal and leave me alone, just like these last three years.”<br />
<br />
“Nope, we’re going to have fun today, and that’s final.”<br />
<br />
“Argh!” Chasity wanted to strangle the blonde cheerleader. She was still stubborn and vague like in the old days. Once she made her mind, there was nothing that could change it, so Chasity knew she had to concede,“Fine, just today, and afterwards don’t ever speak to me again.”<br />
<br />
“Alright! We’re hanging out again!” The cheerleader spun in place in celebration, “ It’s lunchtime so I made fancy sandwiches!” She plopped down on the bench next to Chasity and started unpacking the picnic basket. Chastity didn&#39;t help, instead she was studying the blonde. How did this popular girl curse her with a dong and cage? Was she a witch, or did she use some kind of new super drug? What was her intention of hanging out with Chasity? <br />
<br />
Christy had her long blonde hair in a ponytail under a baseball cap. She wore baggy pants and a tight tank top that exposed her toned cheerleader abs while extenuating her nice c-cup breasts. It was an old but gold outfit style that drew the eyes of men and women alike. Looking at the pretty cheerleader made Chasity’s recent endowment strain against its cage in arousal. Chasity glanced  away when Christy had finished fishing out the lunch meals. <br />
<br />
“Here, have one,” Christy stuffed a tiny sandwich into Chasity’s hands and then ate one herself smiling without a care in the world.<br />
<br />
“Huhmp,” Chastity grumbled, but she ate the fancy tiny sandwich anyway, they were good. Soft white bread with mustard, pickle, cheese, and corned beef was the first finger sandwich Chasity munched on, “ It’s good,” Chasity grumbled to Christy to keep her mind off her once friend’s smoking hot body.<br />
<br />
“Glad you like it. I made these myself, you know, self efficiency and all that. There’s more if you want, all different fillings. The salomon cucumber ones are my recent favorite,” Christy haughty held her head up in pride, she was clearly proud of her handy work.<br />
<br />
“For real? The Christy I know was the laziest thing on the planet!” Chasity exclaimed in genuine surprise. <br />
<br />
“Well, cheerleading changes a person,” Christy shrugged, “ All the time management, grades, exercise, and cheer practice on top of it. So... yeah, I learned how to cook.”<br />
<br />
“Liar liar pants on fire, making sandwiches doesn’t mean you know how to cook. Remember back when we were making lasagna at my house? You nearly burned the entire kitchen!” Chasity bit into another sandwich, a curled egg salad one.<br />
<br />
“You remembered that? I was hoping you forgot about that already.”<br />
<br />
“How could I forget! The whole kitchen was a warzone. Your lasagna exploded like a bomb when you opened the oven, and you left the stove on after we finished the sauce. I had to clean the kitchen up because you were covered in sauce and had to shower,” Chasity smirked, chuckling reservedly.<br />
<br />
“Darn, maybe I still can’t figure out ovens, but at least I know how to sandwich,” Christy breathly said, which brought to mind a different sandwich for Chasity, if you know what I mean, “ So enough about my superb sandwich skills ,what’ve you been up to, Chasity?”<br />
<br />
And so the two friends ate their lunch and chatted, while enjoying the sun and finger sandwiches. It was only when the food ran out that Chasity remembered that she was supposed to be mad at the cheerleader. Christy’s natural charisma and outgoing language skills had lulled Chasity into a strange sense of comfort and ease. No, Chasity wasn’t going to fall back into friendship, it was Christy who broke it in the first place when she joined the cheerleaders.<br />
<br />
The mood turned cold again as Chasity fell silent. Noticing that Chasity was returning to being resentful, Christy deftly swung out her gun from her baggy pants pocket and shot a lovely dovey highschool couple, before quickie hiding the transformation gun again. <br />
<br />
“Hey would you look at that!” Christy pointed towards the lovers.<br />
<br />
“What are you on about now?” Chasity turned to look,” This isn’t another prank is - what the fuck?”<br />
<br />
What the fuck was an entirely reasonable response for Chasity, because what she was seeing now was something out of the ordinary for her.  The lovely dove couple, boy and girl, were making out with each other on the grass, which was normal enough, but the catch was that both of them had very large fucksticks with similarly sized male gonads that their lower wear could not contain. That wasn’t all, as the boy’s man meat was horse-like in shape with a flat flaring head, while the girl’s big sausage had an egregious amount of foreskin that covered her cockhead and then some. With their giant genitals exposed, they frotted their didily dicks against each other&#39;s lower heat rods, making out like there was no tomorrow. Such is young hormonal love, they can&#39;t stop thinking about each other, very nice and very cute.<br />
<br />
Chastity stared at the scene with disgust, wonder, and… lust? Her own poor very above average dong was begging to be freed from it’s cage, practically assaulting the metal bars that contained it, giving Chasity pain and pleasure for its efforts. Chastity’s breathing grew heavy and her nipples grew hard and her mind soaking in the family friendly view. Chasity knew she had to look away to not fall prey to the wants of her penis’s base desires, but she just couldn’t, the perverse event demanded her full attention. “What are they doing, and why do they have GINORMOUS COCKS?” Chasity blurted out as if accusing Christy.<br />
<br />
“Don’t know, but it’s really hot, isn’t it!” Christy stealthy shot herself with the magic gun in her pocket. Madison, her pussy, shifted and changed into a centaur&#39;s dong, basically a horse cock, stretching down one of her baggy pant’s legs. The sword of fuckery was clearly outlined through the cloth of Christy lower wear along with her rotund equine balls, “Oh my, it’s happening to me too.” <br />
<br />
That broke Chasity’s concentration on the double donged couple’s act. She gawked at Christy’s stuffed groin region tracing the outline of the super big balls to the extraordinary length of engorged penile flesh. With growing arousal, the brunette in a sundress gaped at Christy’s cheerful face, “You mean it wasn’t you who changed me?” To Chasity’s simple mind she couldn’t comprehend the reason why Christy would do such an obscene act to herself, “But you said you could change me back earlier!”<br />
<br />
“Oh uh, I sort of lied about that? This kind of weird changing phenomena sort of occurs randomly around me,” Christy lied, “But now I’m the same as you so lets go test out our weapons!”<br />
<br />
Chastity was stunned. What was she doing with Christy who ruined her date and potentially her life? She should leave right now and find some way to turn herself back to normal without this cursed cheerleader. However, something inside her held her back, a primal urge along with old friendship. Christy had been generally nice to her on this lunch date, plus if Chasity stated with her the random transformation could change her back to normal. Most important of all, Christy offered sexy times, and she had the key to the blasted penis restraint on Chasity’s oversexed chub.</p>
