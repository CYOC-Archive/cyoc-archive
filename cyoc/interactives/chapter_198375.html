<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Uh. Hi. It’s me, after like 7 months of horrible depression. Sorry.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn&#39;t the most comfortable thing in the world, trying to get to sleep on a bare floor with dragon wings poking out, but somehow, Rhonda managed to get to the other side of the night feeling semi-refreshed. Good enough to drag herself up, at any rate, shaking May to get her going as well. The rest of the girls were right on the duo&#39;s heels, energized after a far better night&#39;s sleep and their newfound physical improvements. All of them seemed eager to dress themselves up in the manner most suited to showing off their new draconic attributes; May and Rhonda were more keen to get out of here and back to the latter&#39;s room, hurrying out into the halls where the early bird students - at least two of whom were actual bird-girls at this point - were making their way around.<br />
<br />
There was, of course, relief among her roommates when she arrived back; they&#39;d been concerned, though, not <i>too</i> concerned. Even with reptile alien hall monitors to worry about, Rhonda had a knack for worming her way out of impossible situations. The latina wanted to share the news that she could in fact be the one handing out transformations now, but time was a bit scarce before classes began. She had just enough of it available to share a nervous-yet-thrilling goodbye kiss with May before they both had to jet off, rushing to get showered and changed and stuff breakfast down ahead of their morning classes, Rhonda all the while bracing for whatever weird shit was going to happen today.<br />
<br />
She was bracing right up until the end of that first morning history class, one that had proceeded in such a mundane fashion she could&#39;ve sworn she was back in mortal school. Oh, there&#39;d been a lot of looks - it was impossible for her not to be a center of attention at this point - but there hadn&#39;t been some bizarre encounter with a past opponent, nor some girl getting transformed in class, nor some machination unfolding to her detriment. Hell, most of the girls in there still looked like normal witches, free of any strange alterations to their physical makeup. It was a new record for time without something going tits-up at this school, and that record was broken at the end of her next class, this one just as lacking for anything bizarre.<br />
<br />
It seemed, at last, that fate had blessed her with a normal day. Well, normal as it could get for a dragon-morph-girl like her, at any rate. As she headed off to lunch, Rhonda decided not to question it, knowing from all her past adventures how good of a method that was to jinx things. No, no, she was just gonna let it play out. She was going to go to the cafeteria, hang out with her friends, maybe make a pass or two at May, see if they could sneak in a couple minutes to make out in a closet, and then go about her norma, boring, average day without anything notable happening. That was what she&#39;d do, at last, she&#39;d have a day that didn&#39;t one-up the previous day in strangeness, a day that was just quiet and happy and fun.<br />
<br />
<i>She</i> would have a day like that. Principal Hexe, not so much.<br />
<br />
Oh, Mala&#39;s day had gone alright in the first half. A few meetings here, some paperwork there, the usual things that came up in the course of running a mystical academy day to day. It had taken a swerve the instant her monitor spell keeping watch over the front door had detected <i>that woman</i> storming through the halls. The instant recognition had been made, she&#39;d considered her coffee, a light roast with a pinch of sugar; and as she watched the blonde tracking down her daughter before marching up to Mala&#39;s office, she had retrieved some bourbon to add to her drink. It would be essential in the coming moments. She added it not a moment too soon, as the object of her exasperation opted to teleport right outside her office.<br />
<br />
The tall blonde wasted no time with the secretary, her family&#39;s classical sense of superiority over working witches manifesting in a total disregard for the young woman&#39;s pleas that she stop. In one hand she gripped tight the wrist of one Abigail, the girl now looking a fair bit more rubbery and draconic than when the principal had last checked. She found it amusing, truth be told, but she expected the woman who shoved her door open and dragged the teenager into the office, her other fist slamming down onto the large oak desk, didn&#39;t share her amusement. &quot;What the <i>fuck</i> is the meaning of this, Hexe!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mala sipped her drink before replying. Ohhh, she was going to need that booze. &quot;So nice to see you, Wendy,&quot; she lied through her teeth. &quot;To what do I owe the pleasure!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know damn well why I&#39;m here!&quot; That much-vaunted Rochester poise was nowhere to be found as she pointed to Abigail. &quot;Your fucking madhouse of a school allowed my daughter to become this... this <i>thing</i>! And now she tells me she can&#39;t be returned to normal, and that it&#39;s your fault! What&#39;s the meaning of this?!&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed. &quot;The meaning of it is to discourage the usual battery of pranks, as I explained to all parents <i>before</i> the semester began.&quot; The bitch would&#39;ve known if she actually read the pre-semester letters that were sent to all the parents of incoming students. &quot;Your daughter will be returned to her standard form at the end of the school year, just like every other girl who&#39;s been transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is outrageous! You can&#39;t do this to a Stanhope!&quot; She growled, tightening her grip on Abigail&#39;s wrist. As she kept ranting, however, Mala&#39;s attention was focused onto the young lady who&#39;d been dragged in here. In particular, she observed the way Abigail seemed to recoil from every shouted word, staring down at the ground with a scared expression. There was fear heavy in this office, but the source was not Mala, despite the elder Rochester&#39;s barrage of demands and threats, the usual array of warnings that she&#39;d pull funding from the school or try and screw over her political ambitions.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will fix her right now, you... you...!&quot; It was this bit that at last got Mala&#39;s attention again, due to the way in which Wendy began to reach down to her belt, towards the lavish, jewel-laden wand at her side. She didn&#39;t get halfway there before Mala&#39;s eyes were alight with an unearthly crimson glow, a hand raised up with the same energy dancing around it. All of a sudden, sheer telekinetic force stopped the other witch&#39;s hand, with another psychic grapple wresting free Abigail from her white-knuckle grip.<br />
<br />
The amusement had vanished from Mala&#39;s face. &quot;I will not reverse her changes - nor will I be threatened in my own school by some ineffectual small-titted debutante with an unduly inflated ego.&quot; Her raised hand pushed forward, and Wendy found herself pulled out of the room, to just on the other side of the office door. &quot;Good <i>day</i>, Missus Stanhope.&quot; With a snap, the door slammed shut, blinds drawing down to ensure that Wendy could see nothing of occurrences inside the office. She only banged on the door for a few moments before giving up and retreating.<br />
<br />
With her gone, Mala at last relaxed, taking a moment to drink more of her alcoholic coffee before smiling at Abigail. &quot;It&#39;ll be at least a week before she comes back,&quot; she offered as reassurance, before leaning over, swishing open the door, and calling out. &quot;You can come in now, Miss Martinez!&quot;<br />
<br />
Abigail&#39;s eyes were almost as wide as Rhonda&#39;s as the other dragon-morph poked her head out from around the door to the hallway, a sheepish look on her face. She cast an awkward glance to Abigail as she approached, having heard every word of what happened, before looking to the principal. &quot;How did you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, please, Rhonda, you&#39;re hardly the first girl to eavesdrop on my dealings.&quot; She made a little dismissive wave. &quot;It&#39;s good you&#39;re here, though. There was a fascinating little incident mentioned in my morning meeting with the Valkarian representative - their warriors caught out two girls last night. Two <i>dragon</i> girls. You wouldn&#39;t know anything about that, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rhonda swallowed audibly. &quot;I... uh... we...&quot; Mala had dropped the smile, staring with a stern expression into Rhonda&#39;s draconic eyes. &quot;I... I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry... I... ah...&quot;<br />
<br />
The expression was held for a few moments before Hexe burst out laughing. &quot;Oh my sweet goddess, relax, dear!&quot; She chuckled a few more times. &quot;Quite frankly, I&#39;m glad you got away. You&#39;re too fascinating to be hauled off to go fight some interstellar war against cat people or women with giant latex cocks.&quot; She calmed down with another sip of her drink. &quot;However, if you feel any sense of guilt, you might recover from it by escorting Abigail off. It&#39;s your lunch breaks, I believe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... y-yes principal,&quot; Rhonda muttered before she took Abigail&#39;s hand and gave her a gentle tug to leave. The blonde had been in a trance this whole time, breaking at contact with the other girl. Her eyes lost their haze as they headed out into the hallway, falling away in total when she spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you... hear... everything...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rhonda nodded. &quot;Yeah, your mom is a-&quot; She was cut off as Abigail surged over, tears in her eyes, and threw her arms around the latina in a hug. It caught her by surprise, but after a moment she returned the gesture... and started looking around for a more private place to unravel whatever outpouring of emotions Abigail was experiencing.</p>

Where does Rhonda take her?</h3>
