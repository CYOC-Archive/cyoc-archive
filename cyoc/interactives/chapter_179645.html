<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryan sat down at once, thankful that they were alone here.<br />
<br />
Their make out earlier had been impulsive, sudden, and spoke to a-a desperation for contact, for sex, for letting out that burgeoning libido they had developed. Wes in particular had seemed to be unable to keep his hands off of Bryan&#39;s growing body. But now? Now Bryan needed to think this over. He had seen through this the flaws of his wish. He had felt how overwhelming this attraction was. And honestly? It was all he could do at the moment to keep his hands off of Wes, who was now situated just a chair away, seeming to be contemplating his own situation.<br />
<br />
Bryan did not WANT this to be his sexuality. Ross? Sure. Whatever floated his boat. But Bryan was his own man, dammit!<br />
<br />
Bryan looked over at Wes, who seemed to be pushing down his own erection with his palm. He was sweating, and fuck, he still looked good. He had hoped he could calm down, but right now Bryan was just feeling it welling back up again. Maybe this was the combination of that facet of their wish plus the innate high testosterone of a jock. Bryan bit his lip. He thought back to those girls from class. They had been uninterested in him then, but maybe...<br />
<br />
Maybe if the specter of unavailability was raised, they might be more keen on it. Not wholly raised. But the concept brought up.<br />
<br />
Bryan started brightening up. He thought about it, contemplated having sex with those girls. Even with what happened with Wes still in mind, he was able to very vividly and passionately imagine the sexual encounter, a grin settling over his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Wes asked, seeming nervous, &quot;You aren&#39;t thinking of banging me, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a bit, big guy.&quot; Bryan said with a confident smirk, now getting an idea that was MAYBE a little poorly thought out and PERHAPS a little bit hormonally driven, &quot;I&#39;m just thinking of those girls in class. Remember how they shot me down. They knew that I was available, but they were busy. Time was not of the essence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...What are you thinking? What are you going on about here?&quot; Wes asked, seeming nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m capable, fully capable, of fucking those girls. I think. I can really, passionately envision it. Can you still do that, man?&quot; Bryan asked, leading into his idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot; Wes was quiet for a moment, and then nodded slowly, &quot;I dunno what&#39;s going on between us, and I can still see myself doing...oof, all kinds of things with you. But I can still see myself having sex with women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, good.&quot; Bryan said with a smile, &quot;Then that goes into my plan. My brilliant, brilliant plan. All we gotta do is present it like we&#39;re MAYBE going gay, but it&#39;s not very clear. You saw how interested the girls were in Ross and whatever&#39;s goin&#39; on with his love life. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Wes started to get a picture. It was not a very good picture, but he trusted Bryan with this. Plus, he was good with hearing these ideas from him. It sounded like it was leading somewhere interesting at least. &quot;They really do like him, even though he, y&#39;know, likes men.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how about we lean in on this a little? Don&#39;t let it fully get you, but leave it up there. Let the girls think we MIGHT be going gay.&quot; Bryan grinned and leaned back, considering this to be his ultimate cunning plan that could not fail. &quot;If they think they might not be able to get with us in a week or two, they&#39;ll wanna make sure they ride these dicks while they can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if they just think we&#39;re coming out as bisexual?&quot; Wes asked as he tilted his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;...You just leave the thinking to good ol&#39; Bryan, okay?&quot; Bryan responded, trying to brush the question aside. As far as he was concerned, this would achieve everything. He could become popular with the women here, he could have sex...and he could deal with his current, powerful and demanding need. Looking over at the shirtless Wes only intensified Bryan&#39;s belief in this plan as necessary.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do?&quot; Wes asked as he considered where this was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I figure...mmph...for now, we can deal with our libidos.&quot; Bryan got up and stretched, enjoying the way Wes&#39; eyes widened when he casually flexed his arms following his stretch. Just had to make it convincing. Bryan moved forward and Wes put up exactly no fight as Bryan sat on his groin and started kissing at his lips lightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude...I mean, I&#39;m not questioning your plan. It&#39;s just...well, what if this all...like...&quot; Wes asked, blatantly barely able to stop himself from joining in the make out as it resumed. His muscled physique streaked with sweat. Wes gulped and seemed to look Bryan over. He really was getting impressively big. Their size disparity was being corrected - and this was turning Wes on tremendously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, just let&#39;s...get it outta our systems and start planning out how we&#39;re gonna get all the pussy going forward. Still interested, right?&quot; Bryan said with a flirty wink and a kiss to Wes&#39; cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, you talking about gettin&#39; laid with girls...and then making out with me...for some reason it&#39;s just so fucking hot, man!&quot; Wes gasped, and then finally leaned into it as well. He started passionately kissing Bryan, flush in the cheeks and realizing how good this felt. Fuck, if kissing on Bryan felt this good, he looked forward to kissing other people.<br />
<br />
Wes couldn&#39;t keep his hands off very long, and both guys were before long on the floor, feeling up their newly muscled physiques. Bryan was sweating just as much as Wes, and it half seemed to reflect on a perverse sort of wrestling match as the two stripped down on the floor and tossed their pants and underwear aside.<br />
<br />
Bryan found himself managing to get a more dominant position, breathing in between passionate kisses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude...let&#39;s do this. I&#39;m...I&#39;m gonna top.&quot; Bryan grinned, thinking of how good this was gonna feel.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...I&#39;m still bigger!&quot; Wes shook his head and looked up at Bryan from the floor. He tilted his head, &quot;I mean, you remember how those weird girls at school were murmuring about it. Bigger guy goes on top, smaller guy gets the dick up his ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, c&#39;mon, I&#39;m not even that much smaller than you at this rate. You can be like, a power bottom or something. Whatever that means.&quot; Bryan shook his head, his dick was aching for some action, and he was really needing to get this moving. Fuck, his body was feeling strong right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just...maybe we should uhh, lube up or something if you&#39;re gonna fuck me.&quot; Wes said, looking rather sheepish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so we don&#39;t have any lube.&quot; Bryan realized, and then shook his head, &quot;Okay, we&#39;re gonna do the uhh, the frottage thing.&quot; The momentary setback forgotten, Bryan immediately had an idea for what to do. He knew all this social studies sex ed stuff was gonna come in handy sooner or later.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you skipping sex ed?&quot; Bryan shook his head, and explained, &quot;Frottage. You know. Where the dicks are like, pressed up against each other.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh...okay...&quot; Bryan and Wes repositioned, and before long they had their manhoods pressed against one another. Wes could barely stop himself as he started thrusting his hips. Pumping up against Bryan.<br />
<br />
Bryan for his part grinned and almost felt himself go light in the head from how good that felt. He was really looking forward to fucking around going forward if this felt so good. After a few times where they almost fell out of alignment, Bryan gripped Wes&#39; broad shoulders and started pressing, thrusting with his hips strongly. The two of them moaning and groaning in tandem as they felt the sheer pleasure rocking their bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Dude!!&quot; Wes shuddered and shook. &quot;I know...I fucking know...!&quot; Bryan responded immediately.<br />
<br />
They both ended up cumming, Bryan about ten seconds after Wes, both laying there for a moment, Bryan on top of Wes, shivering and realizing how good this all felt.<br />
<br />
As if interpreting what this all must seem like, Bryan shook his head and got up, breathing harshly even still. That...that certainly dealt with the libido issue. He was spent, really fucking spent. Bryan asked, uneasy, &quot;You still up to follow my plan, bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I am. I mean...FUCK. If just doing that with you felt so good...&quot; Wes said with a grin, &quot;I&#39;m good to go for sex with women.&quot; After that indeed, Wes felt like his barriers to being sexually open were broken. He could really find what he liked and assert himself there. And whatever he and Bryan were, it was obvious Wes was mostly okay with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;If things keep going, we can try and find that machine again. But it&#39;s pretty obvious we still have basically our own preferences. Just with...y&#39;know, Ross&#39; added on.&quot; At least that was Bryan&#39;s interpretation. Maybe a little scatterbrained due to the recent incredible orgasm. But he was feeling confident in how his plan could work out.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Wes asked, &quot;Where do we go next with this? I mean, your plan and all.&quot;</p>
