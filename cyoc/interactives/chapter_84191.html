While Talia and Chris were off with the new Vaccine Bomb, the rest of the team was focused on dealing with the outbreak in Rio De Janeiro itself. Many aspects of the outbreak were actually better than the others, mostly due to the spread of the Justin Vaccine through the atmosphere and from some members of the population having already ordered injections of it. The result is that while a fairly decent number of people became Kats, there were not enough of them that they could dominate a section of the city the way they had in Paris, Cairo, and Hong Kong. The result of this cut down the violence issues that had occurred in the previous outbreaks. There simply weren&#39;t enough Kats to trigger that sort of mentality, and that was thanks to the spreading of the Vaccine to counter the virus. That however created different problems. This problem was the fact that the lust driven Kats tried to mate with either those they loved dearly already or with anyone that just happened to be close, but some of these intended &quot;rape&quot; victims had been vaccinated and didn&#39;t change, and this actually triggered distraught and frightened reactions in the Kats.<br />
<br />
Lia, Ryles, Luna and Midnight had already dealt with several of these Kats. They were commonly found hugging their chosen lover and either whimpering or crying extensively. They&#39;d all had to try and comfort the transformed Kats. Some were more successful than others, but those they didn&#39;t fully succeed with only spoke Portuguese and had to simply be held down and vaccinated. Once that happened, it seemed as those Kats began to reconcile or apologize to the human they had grabbed and attempted to mate with. The rest of their efforts though, still focused on the Kats that were wild with lust, and some of them responded in odd ways.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on!&quot; a Capykat pleaded in English, once shi learned that Ryles and Lia didn&#39;t speak Portuguese, &quot;Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Kat then wrestled trying to get hir rear legs under Ryles. Ryles in turn wrestled back trying to get hir rear legs away, so that shi would be in a position to mate with this Kat. Ryles had also wrapped hir forelegs around the Capykat&#39;s waist where hir torso met the taur half and had hir arms grasping the shoulders of the Capykat, trying to hold it in place. The struggle was fairly fierce and had gone so far that Ryles did not have the ability to wrestle out  a syringe with the Foxkat Vaccine in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re trying to help you,&quot; Ryles gave a struggled grunt as shi tried to get the Capykat to stop moving.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can help by taking your big cock and thrusting into me,&quot; the Capykat answered and repeated the maneuver to get under Ryles.<br />
<br />
Ryles didn&#39;t really know how to refuse the Capykat. Shi liked the two cats that Alexis and Flake transformed in Sydney when they went into heat and decided to mate. Shi loved Jess as only a devoted pet could, but the Capykat wasn&#39;t them, and Ryles did understand that shi was being influenced by the virus&#39;s lust phase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lia! Please help!&quot; Ryles gave a call to hir teammate.<br />
<br />
Lia, who had carried the human the Capykat had been pursuing away from the area, came running as hard as shi could. Shi could easily see that Ryles was struggling against the Capykat and was only just holding on. Shi rushed back and began readying a Foxkat Vaccine shot to give the Capykat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m coming Ryles! I&#39;m coming! Hold on!&quot; Lia called as shi ran as quickly as shi could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...!&quot; the Capykat answered, &quot;Cum in me please!&quot;<br />
<br />
By that time, Lia arrived and managed to jump onto the Capykat&#39;s back and pin the Capykat down with hir weight. Once that was done, she administered the vaccine which finally got the Capykat to calm down. As shi did so, the Capykat blinked toward the other two Kats with hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; the Capykat said slowly, &quot;I acted like a complete and total slut, didn&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s...?&quot; Ryles asked as some of the terms that people used weren&#39;t fully understood yet, and to a great extent, despite being an adult, Ryles had a sort of innocence that matched a child.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Lia cut Ryles off and spoke to the Capykat, &quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault. It was just the virus...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that guy I was chasing...&quot; the Capykat began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will be fine, and you will be too, now that you&#39;ve been vaccinated,&quot; Lia said slowly.<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause, and then the Capykat said, &quot;thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile on the other side of Rio, Midnight and Luna finished vaccinating another Kat who had been distraught over hir &quot;mate&quot; not transforming. Unlike some of the others, this human had not been involved with the Kat in a romantic relationship before the Kat transformed. Once the Kat calmed down and released the woman, she ran off in horror. This left the Kat not only horrified at what shi had done but practically heartbroken as well. Shi was a Mackat, but unlike the first they had come across, shi was based off of a Blue and Yellow Macaw.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay,&quot; Luna said to hir, &quot;It&#39;ll be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;ve never been able to have a a real love,&quot; the Mackat answered, &quot;Even before this... I was...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were male?&quot; Midnight asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A transgender... surgery gave me breasts and the basic form... but my reproductive organs were still male,&quot; the Mackat answered, &quot;and people generally didn&#39;t respond well to me... and now it&#39;s worse...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll get better,&quot; Luna said softly, &quot;you now have both sets of equipment to mate with, and you aren&#39;t the ONLY Kat here... And I was male once... I am now pregnant. My father was a man once, Shi has been pregnant twice. Shi has one six year old soughter and last month shi gave birth to twins. There are other Kats out there and I&#39;m sure they will come to love you, regardless of their past or your past.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; the Mackat looked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re Kats,&quot; Luna gave an almost motherly smile, not sure if that came from hir pregnancy or seeing Sally and Charlie give it to hir, to Midnight, to Janice, and to Pinkie over the years, &quot;Love is what we do best.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Mackat looked a little bit more confident and got back onto hir feet, &quot;I suppose it&#39;d still be best to let things quiet down first, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna and Midnight nodded. They then watched as the Mackat began to walk away, moving hir tail feathers side to side as shi walked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are we for the vaccine?&quot; Luna then asked to Midnight when the Mackat was far enough away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we got one left,&quot; Midnight answered, &quot;But I also think we&#39;ve gotten everyone vaccinated... I don&#39;t hear any more cries or sounds of mating...&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna turned hir head and moved hir triangular ears around to listen. Midnight was right there, things had quieted down. It was possible that the police were helping with dart guns as well, but they&#39;d also found that there were fewer Kats in Rio than their had been in previous outbreaks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we&#39;ve done all we need to,&quot; Luna commented, &quot;Or at least enough that the local police can handle all they need to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then you can go home and explain to mom and dad why you&#39;ve been mating with your cousin,&quot; Midnight giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t control who I fall in love with... and it just... it just happened,&quot; Luna said slowly but sounding very defensive.<br />
<br />
Midnight only shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;And besides, mom and dad said they didn&#39;t care who my mate is,&quot; Luna answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, they&#39;re mom and dad,&quot; Midnight answered, &quot;They love us dearly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna only shook hir head, and began to walk back toward the main Police Headquarters. The walk was quiet and there were people and Kats slowly cleaning up the &quot;mess&quot; that had been made when things started. When they made it there, they found Raul, Maria, Talia, a Dolphkat, and a lone man waiting for them. The man was in handcuffs and was between Raul and Maria.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that the guy that started all this?&quot; Midnight wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Raul nodded, &quot;and with all the extradition papers signed, he&#39;ll be coming back with us and will be incarcerated in Janace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s also given us some clues as to where we can find Li Sang,&quot; Maria added, &quot;Things are moving along quite well toward solving all the issues that have been had with the Chakat Virus for good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia then came forward, &quot;and this is Chris. He&#39;s from... Miami originally, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Chris nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently someone in a hospital gave hir an injection there to cure hir paralysis,&quot; Talia answered, &quot;Someone we don&#39;t know... and shi has agreed to help us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great to have new teammates,&quot; Luna said with a smile and turned hir head to see Lia and Ryles coming.</p>
