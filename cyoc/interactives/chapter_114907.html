<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista, Arizona, wasn&#39;t the largest fort in the US, but it wasn&#39;t limited to one entrance and/or exit, and as with a number of military instillations, there were a fair number of its personnel that lived on the base and thus didn&#39;t need to commute that far to work. However, there were some soldiers that did live off the base and other than the baby fur manning his post at one of the fort&#39;s entrances, no one knew that one soldier and the main scientist on the project trying to restore the baby fur&#39;s, Teddy, humanity had become baby furs and left the fort with Teddy on his quest to find his sister and be a good uncle. This essentially meant that those who came in through the gate that the cougar baby fur was manning didn&#39;t know about his transformation, and for the moment, no one yet knew of the &quot;escape&quot; of their prisoner.<br />
<br />
This meant when Colonel Vivian Karetaker pulled up to the gate, she was surprised by the sight of a little Mountain Lion baby/person in a camouflage diaper and holding a water pistol asking to see her identification.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Ker-nal, it&#39;s not like we haven&#39;t done this before,&quot; the Mountain Lion baby fur said politely and held out his hand.<br />
<br />
Vivian wasn&#39;t sure on how to respond, as she didn&#39;t expect to find a baby fur at the gate and was too surprised to roll up her window or get on the phone to report the baby fur&#39;s presence. A part of her mind even figured that such a report would only mean to create confusion as Fort Huachuca had been chosen as the site to hold Teddy because the baby furs were all mostly in the eastern part of the country. That there was one on the base would mean that those baby furs outside the fort had found a way to cause a transformation without being close to their intended target, which wouldn&#39;t make sense or would mean grave danger from her present point of view. In theory she could also guess that Teddy had broken his promise, but as far as she knew, baby furs didn&#39;t break promises once they&#39;d been made. It all made little sense and she was too surprised at the moment to sort it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... uh... shouldn&#39;t you be with the researchers, finding a way to change you back?&quot; Vivian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Ker-nal,&quot; the Mountain Lion baby fur answered, &quot;I am where I am put. To man this gate and guard Fort How-Whu-Ha.&quot;<br />
<br />
The baby fur gave a bit of a giggle as he tried to pronounce the fort&#39;s name, and actually looked adorable doing it, like one of the cartoon character&#39;s that Vivian&#39;s three and four year old daughter&#39;s watched. Vivian found herself giggling as well as that thought crossed her mind. Vivian&#39;s giggle made the Mountain Lion baby fur giggle in reply, and that lead to a fairly instantaneous response. Vivian began to shrink down, without even noticing it. Many of her features softened and rounded out, though her skin also seemed to itch a little. She scratched at her leg and looked down to see pristine white feathers growing out of her fingertips. It was only then that she noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?!&quot; was all Vivian managed as her neck then stretched out and up with her lips pushing out into a hard orange colored beak. Her feathers grew longer, particularly on her arms and her uniform suddenly vanished leaving her only in her panties, which were actually thickening out and going from a cotton  adult&#39;s undergarment  that was red in color into a camouflage colored diaper, matching Jamie&#39;s and the Mountain Lion baby fur&#39;s, though with a silver eagle on its front.<br />
<br />
At the same time, her car began to change as well. Sharp curves rounded out and metal became plastic. After a few moments, where Colonel Vivian Karetaker had sat in purple Ford Taurus was Ker-nal Vivy the Swan in a purple toy car. The Mountain Lion baby fur looked to her as she waved playfully to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi!&quot; Vivy declared with a happy wave, &quot;I&#39;m ready to go on duty.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Mountain Lion baby fur nodded and then answered, &quot;I just need to see your ID.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right!&quot; Vivy answered and reached down into her diaper.<br />
<br />
She ultimately produced a laminated paper card that had Vivy&#39;s picture on it with her name, rank, birth-date, and all the other identification you&#39;d find on a military issued ID card. The thing that really differed it from what it had looked like when she&#39;d left her house as Vivian was that several of the words were now misspelled, at least to an adult&#39;s eyes, and looked like they&#39;d been done entirely in crayon. The Mountain Lion baby fur looked at it and then nodded, reading it all as if it were easy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Ker-nal Vivy,&quot; the Mountain Lion baby fur said with a salute, &quot;Welcome back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven&#39;t been on duty all night, have you?&quot; Vivy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Had to,&quot; the Mountain Lion baby fur replied, &quot;orders... but I go off-duty in an hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Mountain Lion baby fur then moved back into the guard house and pressed a button, opening the gate for Vivy. She nodded and made car engine noises as she drove onto the base. And many situations played that way for the rest of the day. The new guard would later show up at the guard post and was startled when the Mountain Lion baby fur came out of the gate house, and since the Mountain Lion baby fur had never promised not to giggle or do any of the things that would result in a baby fur transformation, the inevitable followed. The Mountain Lion baby fur then turned over his post to a black furred Wolf baby fur and went to his home on the fort&#39;s territory.<br />
<br />
Vivy, also, had never promised not to laugh or giggle and many of those in her own station didn&#39;t expect to see a Swan baby fur come on duty either, which of course further lead to more transformations. Eventually some warning did get out, but it was to a degree, too late. There were so many baby furs going about their lives at Fort How-Whu-Ha that they couldn&#39;t be fully contained. The fort did have some of the specialized suits that would protect people from being transformed, but much like the first tanks introduced on the Somme in 1916, there simply wasn&#39;t enough of them to protect EVERYONE at the fort, and while there was some surprise at baby furs running rampant around the fort, many of the initial complaints and surprises were lost when the security camera footage showed Teddy didn&#39;t consciously break any of his promises. Though, the last humans at Fort How-Whu-Ha were at a loss on how to explain Marion and Jamie becoming baby furs when it was they who laughed at Teddy&#39;s jokes and antics and not Teddy laughing to transform them.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all a real pickle,&quot; one man said inside his protective suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed, but what do we do?&quot; another asked, &quot;It&#39;s spreading too quick and too fast. The commander&#39;s gotten them to promise to stay on the base for the moment...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To protect the fort and to think of a way to make friends seem less scary,&quot; said a child&#39;s voice from beneath them.<br />
<br />
The two men looked down to see a German Shepard baby fur in a camouflage diaper with a single gold star on its front.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t want trouble or anyone to feel threatened,&quot; the German Shepard baby fur stated, &quot;and when people see we&#39;re friendly and not zombies, everyone will get along better. That idea makes sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; the two men said together, more as though they were amusing a child rather than actual obedience, but they also didn&#39;t dare leave the fort for fear that the baby furs at Fort How-Whu-Ha might leave without adult supervision.</p>
