<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning was extremely strange for Kim, she had gone to the group therapy meeting and it had to be the strangest event in her entire life. People where actually looking at her with eveny, people had always looked down at her for either her looks physically or the hand me down cloths but not now. People called her lucky that she was becoming a Nymph that she was becoming a goddess while they where becoming monsters. Some of the men, and even some of the women even checked her out physically, something that had never happened before. The therapist who lead the group paid her little mind, maybe he agreed with the rest that she had gotten lucky and as such she didn’t need as much help. What times she did talk everyone talked about the change of becoming a monster, all the questions where about that. After that was done she went back to her room and opened the bag of homemade cookies that he Mentor Beth had made. She took a bite and actually fought back a moan, they where so good.<br />
<br />
As she ate the cookies, she turned her thoughts back to the group and her life as a whole. For her part, Kim becoming a Nymph wasn’t all that bad, she would still look mostly human, some nymphs did have odd color hair and eyes, the water nymph had blue hair and the air nymph and the night/dark nymph had dark raven or purple hair. Still that was nothing to her, her pain wasn’t in the change it was all the stuff that happened before the change. The years of being put down by her bullies, years of semi-neglected from her mother and step-dad. At least that part was more of the fact that they were so busy working so that she and everyone else in their family had food on the table and a roof over their heads. It may not have been the best food or roof, but it was the best they could do, still with all their work they had never shown up at any of her art shows, never helped her with homework or took a real interest in her. It wasn’t her parents which was the bane of her life, it was her bullies, those who never let her have a moment of peace. <br />
<br />
She had been focusing on her own memories when a knock at the door caused her to lift her head up.<br />
<br />
“Come in.” said Kim as the door opened to show three breathtaking beautiful women standing there. Her mentors, three of the 11 people in the world who had become Nymphs stood in the doorway.<br />
<br />
“You are just getting into the cookies?” laughed Beth, her voice sounding like a warm spring day even as she lifted another bag up. “Here I brought more.”<br />
<br />
“And don’t worry about concerns about gaining weight, we don’t seam able to.” Explained Jess as the former man rolled his eyes. “I can eat the same amount I used to when I was a 300 pound man and only gain five pounds and I loss that in a day or two of light eating. So feel free to pig out.”<br />
<br />
“That wasn’t in any of the articles.” Explained Kim <br />
<br />
“Not surprising, which is why we are here to help you.” Said Sally as the lawyer stood in semi-normal cloths, she was more in business causal then the pantsuit she had been wearing the day before. “So lets talk.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, I do have some questions.” Said Kim<br />
<br />
“Fire away.” Said Jess as she sat in one of the chairs, the room had two chairs and while Kim remained sitting on the bed, Sally had grabbed a chair from the another room. <br />
<br />
“Well…I noticed that this morning my….”<br />
<br />
Your breasts where more firm.” Finished Beth as Kim nodded. “Well we are suppose to be guardians of nature running through the woods and having your girls bounce up and down will just not do.”<br />
<br />
“Basically overnight a group of muscles grew in your body making a natural bra.” Explained Sally “It will get stronger as the change goes on.”<br />
<br />
“I see…” said Kim<br />
<br />
“One thing we really need to warn you about is the changes sexually.” Stated Jess “See…Nymphs are kind of like Succubus in a way.”<br />
“Succubus?” inquired Kim, she knew of the sex demon but Nymphs weren’t like that. “How so?”<br />
<br />
“Not in that we crave sex, my wife turned into a succubus and she goes really crazy sometimes.” Said Jess with a smile of recalled memories “But…Nymphs like Succubus can get pregnant by either a man or a women.”<br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Kim amazement <br />
<br />
“My son, was convinced after I was turned and my husband had also come down with the flu, he became a female werewolf and somehow we conceived our son.” Explained Beth “DNA even proved that I wasn’t cheating or the like and he was born almost a year after my husband...now wife turned.”<br />
<br />
“So keep that in mind if you are with someone.” Explained Jess<br />
<br />
“I see…my hair also grew but I don’t know why you have short hair.” Asked Kim as she pointed to Sally short blondish white hair. Maybe short was the wrong word, but while Beth and Jess’s hair went either to the small of their back or even touched their ass, Sally’s hair was just above her shoulders. <br />
<br />
“And I have a standing appointment with my hair stylist to trim it every Friday.” grumbled Sally “The damn thing grows like crazy until it about their length. I have dropped thousands in hair cuts since turning, if the thing didn’t get in the way while in court I would save my money. If I where to stop I would have hair of that length in two weeks.”<br />
<br />
“I never really had long hair, always wanted it.” Said Kim with a smile before remembering why she never grew her hair long. Taking care of hair that length required a good amount of money, in hair products and that money could have been spent on other things. Her face fell as she recalled the words her step father would say. “Sorry honey but we can’t afford that.” She would have taken a job and started to pay for her own things like she did once she started school but in high school she only had her bike to get anywhere besides school. There was a school bus for that and they lived 15 miles out of town, so getting to work would be next to impossible. <br />
<br />
“Something wrong.” Said Beth, her motherly instincts kicking in, as she looked at this young women. <br />
<br />
“Nothing…” said Kim<br />
<br />
“Talk about it, it’s the only way.” Advised Jess “I had to deal with from becoming a fat man to a hot babe and the only way I did was to talk about it with my mentors and family.”<br />
<br />
“That is the issue, family.” Said Kim tears forming in her eyes. “We are dirt pour no nothings who where luckly to have enough money for food and rent every month. I always wanted long hair, but we couldn’t afford it my step father would say. Sometimes I wonder if my parents even really care about me.”<br />
<br />
“I am sure they do.” Said Beth as she stood up and sat down beside the younger women, and pulled her into a hug.<br />
<br />
“I know they do, they try their best to provide food and shelter but a kid needs more…I need then that.” Explained Kim as she began to cry as the other two women came closer forming a protective ring around her. “They never came to see my art work, I pretty much raised my younger siblings and half siblings once my oldest sister moved out when I was 12. Never got a thanks or even a day off, they didn’t seem to care about me personally they didn’t even come to my graduation or send me off to college. Once My Aunt drove me down to my college and worse of all they never helped me with….”<br />
<br />
She paused as she tried to fight down the flood of emotions, she had never actually let this all out before. It didn’t make sense, maybe it was the change coming over her and forcing everything out.<br />
<br />
“With what?” inquired Jess placing a hand on her shoulder even as she cried into Beth’s arm. Sally was a little more standoffish but she could see emotion in her eyes as well. <br />
<br />
“It may sound like nothing but I was am bullied…” started Kim as Jess let out a sigh. <br />
<br />
“Been there sister.” Said Jess, as Kim felt insulted a bit and glared at the former man, however she stopped as she saw sadness in Jess’s dark eyes. “Let me guess, emotional beat downs, calling you fat, lazy, slow and on top of that physical assaults and the like.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Kim<br />
<br />
“You aren’t the only one to walk down this road, my bullies tormented me. I was the 300 pound computer nerd who would go play D&D instead of going to prom.” Stated Jess before grinning. “It was fun showing them up during our reunion, top computer programmer married to a hot succubus and I a goddess on two legs. I could have walked away with any of their wives if I had wanted to. Revenge tasted good that night.”<br />
<br />
“Revenge isn’t the point.” Countered Beth as Jess shrugged before she turned her attention back to Kim. “Don’t worry about the bullies, you can overcome them and besides you in college now…”<br />
<br />
“And the worse of them is my current roommate and the rest of them all attend the same university as me.” Explained Kim “They lord over their wealth, their luck with boys, their looks everything. They are the worse people in the world…” <br />
<br />
Suddenly a cell phone rings.</p>
