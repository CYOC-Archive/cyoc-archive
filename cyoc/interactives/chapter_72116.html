<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still hesitant and unsure of why he'd purchased clothes suitable not only for girl, but one that was obviously about eight years younger than him, Denny dropped his purchases on his bed and turned away. After thinking about it for a moment, Denny turned back to what he'd bought and taking each item out of the bag one at a time, he gazed at article of clothing, running a hand over them, liking how soft they felt, but sure that they would be two small for him.<br />
<br />
Feeling like he should first wash the romper, underwear and swimsuit first, Denny instead dropped all four items back onto his bed and picked up the bag. Balling it up, he tossed it to the side and asked himself, &quot;Why did I buy this stuff. Sure I want to be a girl. But none of these items will make me a girl. Being born makes you a girl. Taking pills and going to hospital for extended periods of time makes you a girl,&quot; and once again, he turned away from the clothes. Pacing back and forth, stopping long enough to pick up the wadded-up bag, Denny thought about chucking the articles of clothing in the couple boxes his parents still kept that contained all of Carla's old clothes.<br />
<br />
Instead, Denny exited his bedroom, taking the crumpled up bag with him and when he reached the kitchen, he dumped it into the trash. Heading for the fridge for something snack on, he knew that his mother was probably with his father and that his sister was most likely out somewhere with the two other girls she commonly hung around with.<br />
<br />
After he'd gotten something to snack on, Denny headed back to his room and immediately seeing the romper, underwear and swimsuit, he paused. After a moment, he thought, &quot;I'll prove that none them fit,&quot; and stripping off his clothes, he stood in the middle of his room, naked and contemplating his last thought.<br />
<br />
Picking up the swimsuit first, liking how soft it felt, he draped the top piece over one of his shoulders and held the bottom piece up in front of him. Feeling ridiculous, Denny decided that he needed a mirror and remembering that Carla had one in her room that allowed for viewing of the whole body, Denny headed out of his room and down the hall. Inside his sister's room, he paused and took in how feminine everything appeared and how comforting it all felt. Moving over to the mirror and gazing into it, he automatically felt ashamed at what he was about to do and disgusted at his own nakedness.<br />
<br />
Rather return to his own room, Denny instead held up the bottom piece of the bikini up, noted that he could see his penis and testicles no matter how he held the article of clothing and thinking, he shifted himself about until his male genitals were tucked between his legs. Once again holding the bikini bottom up, Denny huffed in frustration and thought that he would just have to try it on.<br />
<br />
Struggling to pull it up his legs and keep his genitals tucked back, Denny questioned why he was doing such a thing, feeling that trying on the clothes to prove they didn't fit seemed like it was kind of a flimsy excuse. When he finally had it pulled up all the way, Denny found another problem, as the bikini bottom didn't cover him properly. Shifting it about, Denny finally managed to get it so that it was pinching his penis and testicles, but also was covering his bum properly, but at the same time was disappointed at how low it was pulled down in front and how it just barely covered him.<br />
<br />
A derisive laugh escaped him and thinking he looked idiotic wearing something that was clearly to small for him, Denny instead struggled to put the top piece, a simple pink band that stretched around the torso and had two thin straps that attached to the front, roughly in the middle and went up and over the shoulders, on. When he finally did have the top on, Denny stared into the mirror at his reflection, liking how the swimsuit looked but at the same time thinking that he wasn't meant to be wearing such a thing because it was clearly meant for a girl. Uttering another derisive laugh, Denny thought about taking off the bikini, but instead turned away from the mirror and hastily exited his sister's room.<br />
<br />
When Denny returned to Carla's room he was carry several different bits of clothing he got from the boxes marked &quot;Carla: Age 5-7&quot;. Sorting through the different shorts, pants, shirts, tights, shirts and onsies, Denny finally choose a pair of denim shorts and a rather loose looking tank top. Returning to the mirror, he gazed at his reflection and the obviously small bikini he was wearing. Thinking, &quot;Probably won't fit me anyway,&quot; Denny started pulling on the tank top.<br />
<br />
Finding the tank top was a little baggy surprised Denny and pausing, he looked some more at his reflection and after adjusting the bottom of the swimsuit, his penis and testicles were starting to poke out, Denny thought he looked like a girl with very short hair. Pulling on the shorts, Denny turned away from the mirror and laying down on his sister's bed, he proceed to zip up and the fasten the one button. After he'd done that, Denny laid there for a moment before standing up and heading back to the mirror. To his surprise, the shorts, even though they'd been difficult to fasten, were also rather loose. Unable to fathom how this was, Denny eventually thought, &quot;Must be something the way girl's clothes are designed,&quot; as he turned away from the mirror, squatted down and collected the other clothes he'd taken from the box.<br />
<br />
After he'd dropped the clothes on his bed, deciding that if they did fit he would try them on later, Denny returned to his sister's room and to staring into the mirror at his reflection. Before he could reach the mirror, however he stopped when he saw one of Carla's dolls, a mouse that was wearing a pair of pink slippers. Picking up the plush animal, and ignoring the others, Denny could not explain why he felt drawn to it, just that he thought she was pretty and there was so much he could do with her, including dressing her in a couple pretty outfits and having a pretend tea party.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, Denny wondered what he was thinking and glancing toward the mirror, taking in how he was dressed and the way he was holding the plush mouse, Denny shook his head and muttered, &quot;I should just take off these ridiculous outfit and get redressed in my normal clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead, he cuddled the plush animal close, turned and exited Carla's room. Heading back through the house, he exited out into the backyard and locating the sprinkler, he stripped off the shorts and tank top, folded them and set them and the mouse of the back stoop. Hooking the sprinkler up to the hose, he turned on water and without giving it a second thought Denny began to amuse himself playing in the sprinkler.<br />
<br />
Not really caring what he was doing, only that he was having fun, Denny continued this until Carla suddenly turned up. Stopping, aware that he was outside wearing a girl's swimsuit, he stared at his sister. After a couple seconds one of her friends followed her through the back gate. When Carla noticed Denny, she merely said, &quot;Hey, pipsqueak. Is mom home,&quot; as her friend came into the backyard, closed the gate behind her and gazed in Denny's direction.<br />
<br />
Forgetting for a moment what he was wearing, Denny snapped, &quot;Who you calling pipsqueak?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to tell mom that you were being rude,&quot; Carla retorted and turning away from Denny, she started walking toward the house as her friend commented, &quot;Your sister is weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Carla replied, Denny merely watched them, wondering what had just happened. Crossing the yard, he thought, &quot;I am not a girl. Was she making some sort of joke, just to throw me off and maybe tell mother later that she caught me wearing girl's clothes,&quot; and turning off the sprinkler, he rolled up the hose and put away the sprinkler.<br />
<br />
Heading over to the back stoop, he sat down and after a moment, looked down at the plush mouse, noting that Carla hadn't it back. Picking up the plush animal, he found himself torn between finding it cute and nauseously feminine. Picking it up, he gazed it for a moment longer before finally hugging close as he reached for the shorts and tank top with his other hand. Standing, he thought, “I really should get changed. What I just did was stupid,” and heading back into the house, he quickly made his way toward his room, anxious to get out of the two-piece swimsuit.</p>
