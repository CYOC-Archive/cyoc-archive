<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Isaac has to remain male. Becoming female or partly it makes him submissive to other males and there will be no more adventure into the crypt and it will fall into servitude route. Also I like improving Isaac more to maleness. Also corruption does not make you grow huge simply adds more features but Isaac grew because he absorbed. His body ate and consumed them. Their fully assimilated but the Ring of Purity supresses the memories and slowly filters them in as familiarity. Or Deja Vu.<br/>
<br/>
More male corruption coming right up. I'll draw his new form inspired by more mythical monsters and referencing the other addtions to his body.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Fixed some things and found out that I can't draw on paper. Digital Drawing is my style and I don't have a computer right now. Using a phone to write these chapters.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isaac scanned the entire room wary at the sudden blackout that had happened. He remembered the intense fucking. He remembered getting angry. But then he whited out. It was as if his entire mind broke apart and spread everywhere at once and his mind took preventative measures to simply...<br />
<br />
Forget.<br />
<br />
Supress.<br />
<br />
Once heavily reinstating that he is indeed alone Isaac tried to stand up. Using his weirdly familiar new sets of hands he propped himself up.<br />
<br />
With a heave Isaac stood up and steadied his form. Looking down to his body however made him so much more curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a mirror,&quot; Isaac said to himself as he flexed his secondary set of arms, its viney insides stretching &quot;this is too heavy for me to not know.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pondered a bit and sighed. The frost breath that escaped him flew out and fell to the floor and it simply froze.<br />
<br />
Eyes widening at such discoveries Isaac quickly turned his head to the nearest torch in sight. He ran to it asad fast as he could, the need to know overwhelming. Once reaching it he stepped to its side, its light illuminating his entire ice body. <br />
<br />
&quot;I pray that this succeeds...&quot; and inhaled heavily, as much as he could. Fortunately his new body didn&#39;t have actual lungs therefore the air permeated his entire body, slipping into open pores and creases between his vines. <br />
<br />
Not questioning his odd inhalation, due to the fact that corruption makes logic unusable, Isaac wished this works.<br />
<br />
Exhale.<br />
<br />
A powerful cloud of freezing air left his sharp maw of a mouth and spread to the entire wall. He kept exhaling as hard as he could. To the last puff he exhaled.<br />
<br />
Once the frost fog dissipated Isaac grinned his teeth showing a visage worth running from.<br />
<br />
And voila, a mirror took form. Isaac needed a moment to register his reflection and immediately gasped in shock. <br />
<br />
With each corruption...<br />
<br />
He looks less and less human...<br />
<br />
He was simply a five footer before but now he was taller reaching up to seven now! <br />
<br />
He took in all the changes that had happened. From what he could see the latter corruption mainly the bramble vines took dominant form. He could see that each new corruption becomes less prominent. And thankfully he exhibited almost none of the female creatures characteristics. <br />
<br />
Somehow the number of male sovereignty overcame the female portion as the body balanced itself. Isaac theorized that he was supposed to be overly huge by now, corrupted by two male creatures with fairly strong forms and the two female creatures.<br />
<br />
He was thankful. His base body was borderline ripped, corrupted by two muscular males would have made his body over nine feet and the muscles way too big. The succubus and the witch toned his body to the seven footer as of now with fairly strong body.<br />
<br />
Isaac was fairly worried that if too many females he was corrupted by would turn him female... <br />
<br />
&quot;I need to be careful.. I wish to return as a strong male...&quot; <br />
<br />
Assessing himself in the ice mirror Isaac began to see what had happened over the time he had been corrupted physically.<br />
<br />
He could see how his head was seemingly wearing a helm of ice and his vine construct face filling in the helm. The helm was formed to be menacing and outright unfriendly. They formed jutted spikes on the back of his head and sharp face guard over his cheeks. Two orbs of uneven ice with a glowing ring of blue light, the same as the ghoul&#39;s, shined and acted as his eyes. The blue rings that is his irises dart according to his sight stays within the orb while the orb stays fixed in place with the vines. His sharp row of teeth was shown permanently as he didn&#39;t have any lips. His vine construct neck was made to look muscular. They were covered in a now thicker sheet of ice, the same as his entire body.<br />
<br />
The flexible and uneven ice made his skin look rugged and ripped. His naked body gave a full view of his entire body. Lower he got Isaac muttered curses. His chest was wider now, giving his shoulders space as it rose to meet his muscular vine neck. His pecs crystallize into ice and abs were prominent sculpted in ice. <br />
<br />
Isaac&#39;s body was built to rival a demon bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
His arms were big and heavy at his sides as he brought them forwards. His clawed fingers sharp and ready to tear flesh and bone. They had became more like hands that could be weapons. Giving a flex of his hands sent ice shards flying. Spikes of icy thorns adore his entire body in short concentrated bursts on his joints. His ice body sculpted to masculine perfection. The new set of arms were made of vine constructs covered in ice yet the vines clearly showed that it was the incubus&#39;.<br />
<br />
Lower he got Isaac couldn&#39;t help but sigh. His waist turned thick, giving him the V shaped back as his body formed it. His legs thicker to support such a heavy body. Movement caught his eyes as he focused himself to feel the tail and brought it forward. It was smaller than his arms but it was decidedly dangerous. The tip was definitely the succubus&#39; as it was heart shaped. The icy thorns on it made it much more lethal.<br />
<br />
His member was...<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
It held the form mainly as it was before but now it was definitely thicker in girth. While not being overbearing it was well endowed. It was influenced by both the ghoul and the incubus. He could see that his balls now had veins of blue light over it like cracks. The incubus caused his member to always stand at full mast and to produce much more seed. The seeds of a ghoul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ngh&quot; Isaac groaned at its sensitivity. He gripped his member and tried to calm it. All that brought was that he immediately came onto the mirror. Many spurts of bioluminescent cum splashed against the mirror and it froze instantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gah..&quot; Isaac groaned. The feeling was intense as if he just orgasmed for five people at once.<br />
<br />
Getting one more look over Isaac groaned in remorse. This form of corruption would be almost impossible to purge. <br />
<br />
His member lowered itself as it shrunk. Isaac hadn&#39;t released before causing it to stay hardened. Once he did it would be some time before he got hard again.<br />
<br />
Casting a quick purify spell over his form he looked to the mirror and noticed how clearer the ice his body is now. Despite the fearsome visage Isaac is still Isaac. Looking at the ring and closing his crystal eyes Isaac muttered<br />
<br />
&quot;I thank you Ring of Purity..&quot; he didn&#39;t notice how it shined.<br />
<br />
A quick burst of pain however distracted him as a pair of wings bursts out from his back. He looked at the mirror and couldn&#39;t help but notice how they were like the succubus&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I can fly now...&quot; Isaac said as he looked to the viney wings.<br />
<br />
Each breath sent snow, his body corrupted... his memory whitened out. <br />
<br />
Isaac didn&#39;t even notice the fact that he assimilated four beings into his body, he simply reasoned that it was corruption.</p>
