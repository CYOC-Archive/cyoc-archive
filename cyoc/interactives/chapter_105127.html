<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
It was not surprise Julie Stovall spent most of her afternoon stewing in her bedroom while her parents talked privately downstairs. First Eric had slipped out of her claws (which she didn’t have), and then her parents gave her the lecture of a lifetime. <br />
<br />
How could her father of all people suddenly jump on the celibacy wagon? Julie couldn’t do anything but angrily finish her homework, and scream into her pillows. That was until night fell. And both parents, exhausted from the emotionally draining day they had, fell asleep. Melissa and Martin were both so wiped out they didn’t even realize they’d fallen asleep together. In the same bed. In each other’s arms. <br />
<br />
Julie grabbed her “to-go” bag and, as quietly as she could, slipped out of the house. She’d called Brian earlier, and hoped he was still waiting for her at the Lake. She felt a little sorry she was using him like this. But once things with Eric were taken care of she could spend some more time getting to know Brian. <br />
<br />
The wereotter was doing laps around the lake while waiting for his partner to show up. Brian had a lot on his mind, mostly wondering what had gotten into Julie lately. She was acting so crazy. Beyond just sexed up. Still, she was good company and Brian more than enjoyed it. <br />
<br />
Surfacing for air, the wind blew the scent of an aroused female to his nose. Brian looked to the shore and saw Julie undressing. He swam closer to meet her. <br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” Brian couldn’t help but noticed how flushed Julie’s face was. And it wasn’t because she was all hot and bothered. <br />
<br />
“My parents are jerks. But let’s not talk about that now.” Julie said quickly. She didn’t waste any time to wrap her arms around Brian’s neck and pull him close. He felt her rock hard nipples pressing against his fur. Still unchanged, Julie then wrapped her legs around Brian waist. <br />
<br />
Forcing him back, Julie shifted her hips around until, at long last, she found the tip of his otter-cock. Brian was floating on his back while Julie positioned herself above him. He took a deep breath as the two sunk below the water, and Julie started to transform. <br />
<br />
The scales on her legs almost glowed in the moonlight. Brian felt soft skin turn to scales as Julie pushed her body against his. Her motions became more fluid as her legs became a tail. Brian closed his eyes and let Julie continue. <br />
<br />
He got the feeling she needed this more than him. And Julie was in no mood to be taken. SHE wanted to do the taking. Brian swore that when she first entered the lake, the water was steaming around her because she was so angry. Whatever happened between her and her parents must have been pretty serious. <br />
<br />
But at least one good thing came of it. Angry sex, best sex. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile… <br />
<br />
Alyssa Cooper had gone out in search of some “fun”. With Martin out of play, for now, she needed a temporary playmate. <br />
<br />
Being a weremer, she was naturally drawn to the lake. And as she drew closer, Alyssa could smell someone. Two weres, two very aroused weres at that. Alyssa felt her nipples straining against the thin fabric of her shirt, and liquid start to tok her underwear. <br />
<br />
Following the smells, Alyssa found herself on the edge of Moon Lake’s eponymous lake. And there, she could just make out two figures below the water. One a weremer like herself. The other she wasn’t sure. It had to be another aquatic were, it was holding its breath for quite some time. <br />
<br />
But Alyssa noticed the long tail, and the slightly clawed feet and hands. Her curiosity got the better of her, and she stripped off her clothes. Then slowly and quietly dove beneath the water. Assuming her stage two form, Alyssa positioned herself behind a bed of lake plants to get a closer look at the two. <br />
<br />
A mermaid with an orange, almost golden, tail was grinding herself against some dark furred were. Alyssa couldn’t figure out what the male was, until she got a better look at his face. At first she thought it was a dog, based on the pointed cock and thick fur. But the muzzle was too short, and his paws were webbed. <br />
<br />
“I’ve never had an otter before…” she thought hungrily. That cock was looking more and more delicious by the second. Alyssa’s hands went down to knead her hot pussy as the two continued. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------  <br />
<br />
“What is that?” Brian’s bliss was interrupted by another strong smell. Julie sensed it too, as her movements slowed. <br />
<br />
It was sweet. Very sweet. A lot like Julie’s scent. The two stared in shock and surprise as another weremer swam out from behind a forest of underwater plants. It was obvious she’d been watching, and had gotten seriously turned on by their own love making. <br />
<br />
“Hello.” Alyssa waved awkwardly in the water. Julie recognized her as the woman who came to her house the other day. What she was doing in the lake, Julie couldn’t say. And though she’d never once thought about doing it with a woman, there was something about Alyssa’s smooth gray skin and California body that was making Julie reconsider. <br />
<br />
Alyssa’s legs fused into her dolphin-like tail, and she swam closer to the young couple. Brian, unsure what to do since his cock was still buried inside Julie, just make a sort of jutting motion with his head. <br />
<br />
“Don’t mind me. Just passing through.” Alyssa said softly. She swam right over Brian’s head, letting him get an eye full of her swollen lips. Brian grabbed her hand at the last second, and then glanced at Julie. <br />
<br />
The two silently agreed, and Brian pulled Alyssa back to them. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------  <br />
<br />
“Melissa! Wake up honey.” Martin shook his wife’s shoulder urgently. It took a moment for Melissa to register what was going on.<br />
<br />
“Martin, what’s wrong?” she asked once coherent enough to speak. <br />
<br />
“Julie’s gone.”<br />
<br />
“She… she’s gone?” Melissa repeated. <br />
<br />
“I got up to use the bathroom, and noticed her door was open a crack. So I peeked in, but she’s not there. I checked downstairs, the backdoor’s open.” Martin said. Both he and his wife were starting to boil with anger.<br />
<br />
Having fallen asleep in their clothing, neither Stovall wasted any time getting dressed. They tore after their daughter, knowing damn well where she’d gone. They only hoped they could find Julie before she did anything. Because, god forbid, she tried to force herself on Eric at all…. <br />
<br />
“She’s not that stupid.” Martin told himself. Julie had enough common sense not to break into the Andersons’ house. She better anyway…</p>
