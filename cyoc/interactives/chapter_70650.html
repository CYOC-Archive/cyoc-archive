<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David groaned as light and sound began pouring back in.  Everything burned, particularly his wrists which felt <br />
like they were on fire.  He felt a hard bed beneath him and forced himself up. The first thing he attempted to <br />
do was brush his hand across his face as if to remove... something.  Something that wasn't there, his hands <br />
touched only skin sadly.  For a moment he expected to feel long locks of hair, but why?  He had never let his <br />
hair get that long.  He'd be mocked to death for having girly emo hair.  His wrists flared again, drawing his <br />
attention back to them.  Fresh crimson cuts were just beginning to heal on both wrists.  His hands also looked <br />
a little weird, he could've sworn his fingers seemed a bit thinner and the skin around the tips of his fingers <br />
seemed a bit darker like a very precise tan.  He discoloration spread down barely an inch and wasn't too <br />
noticeable unless you were really looking for it.  Checking himself over everything else looked normal, maybe <br />
his hair seemed a bit longer but it could be just his imagination.  During his self-examination he caught the <br />
scent of medicine and realized just were he was, the school nurse's room.  The nurse herself entered, her face <br />
was unreadable and she was carrying something familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, your awake.  I'm hoping you can give me some answers now... David, why did you cut yourself?&quot;  David <br />
looked at her incredulously but she merely shook her head.  &quot;David, you were found in the bathroom with cuts <br />
on your wrists, they were shallow, but we found the razor in your hand and this... book in the other.  What <br />
were you doing with a razor and a blank book?&quot;  David tried to remember, the book, did she say it was blank?  <br />
That couldn't be and he didn't cut himself that thing in the mirror did!  He couldn't say that though, they <br />
would really think he's nuts then and the situation already looked bad.  Choking back his fear, David tried to <br />
think. <br />
<br />
&quot;I fell.  In gym.  The coach saw it, the cuts probably happened then.  I don't know about the razor, maybe <br />
someone put it there as a joke?  The books mine though, can I please have it back?&quot;  David hadn't meant to <br />
sound so whiny and apologetic.  It sounded way wrong for a jock but he felt himself weighed down by something.  <br />
The nurse nodded, still looking skeptical and handed him the 'blank' book.  She ushered him off to class and <br />
he left, feeling relieved.  David opened the book and wasn't surprised to see that everything that had just <br />
happened was written in it.<br />
<br />
'As the jock left the infirmary, doubts and fears began to grow in his mind.  The self-confidence he had <br />
always shown was dwindling away a little and giving way to insecurities and private terrors.  He started <br />
wondering about his friends, feeling distant from other people and alone.'  David slammed the book shut with <br />
trembling hands.  He noticed the darkened pigment seemed to have traveled down a bit further, almost to the <br />
joints in his fingers.  It looked like he bruised them or something, but how the Hell do you just bruise the <br />
ends of your fingers?  And they were so dark now, almost as if…<br />
<br />
&quot;Bullshit!&quot; He shouted to no one in particular, his voice cracking a bit as he said it.  He cleared his <br />
throat.  &quot;That's just bullshit bro, I have great friends and always will.  I‘m nothing like Luis.&quot;  His voice <br />
sounded normal again but there was doubt in it.  He made his way to his next class just in time and took his <br />
place in the back with his friends.  As soon as he sat down his friends started looking at him funny, but they <br />
didn't say anything.  In fact, they didn't talk to him all through class.  He tried to just drown himself in <br />
his school work, just because David was good on the field didn’t mean he was an idiot in class in fact he was <br />
almost a straight A student.  This was math, his best subject he could do this.  Or so he thought.  He stared <br />
at the problems as if he had never seem them before, the numbers and letters danced on the page in front of <br />
him seeming to mock him.  He felt his face flush with frustration, why couldn’t he do this?  He felt a hand on <br />
his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“What” he exclaimed with more venom than he intended.  It was Mark, just Mark, there was no one else in the <br />
classroom.  “Sorry Mark, you just caught me off guard man.”  <br />
<br />
“Dude class is over, you’ve been zoned out there for awhile now, just checking what’s up.  You know the other <br />
guys… there’s been talk that you’ve been cutting yourself.”  David rolled his eyes.  Mark would make a better <br />
mother than a friend, always trying to look out for him.  David kept him around because he felt bad for the <br />
little wimp but he only had time for real friends.  <br />
<br />
“Fuck what people are saying, I’ll talk to you later.”  David left and didn’t look back.  Lunch time, after <br />
that he just had one more class and then he could go home.  The cafeteria was already packed by the time he <br />
got there.  David felt stunned by all the people, like it was physically painful to be around so many.  As he <br />
reeled in his fear and confusion he noticed his usual table was full.  Mark and all of his friends were there <br />
and there was no room for him.  Sighing inwardly he moved to an empty table in the corner, it felt welcoming <br />
and familiar.  Jealously and bitterness welled up in him, watching all the others, at their full tables.  He <br />
tried to distract himself by reading the book again.<br />
<br />
‘Sitting alone, where he belonged he could feel the bitterness getting to him, changing him.  This would be <br />
the first of many lonely days to come.  But part of him was beginning to enjoy that and even as he tried to <br />
ignore it he could feel his interests changing.’<br />
<br />
He felt his hands trembling and put on his music to calm down.  He turned on some Eminem but Falling In <br />
Reverse started playing, he tried Kid Cudi and got Panic At the Disco.  Frustrated, he gave up, he actually <br />
kind of liked this… maybe this scene music wasn’t so bad.  As Bring Me the Horizon filled his ears his hands <br />
stopped shaking but the brown pigment started crawling down again, not just that his hands seemed to be <br />
shrinking.  Down his fingers and all the way to the marks on his wrists his hands were darkening to a nice <br />
Latino color.  The bones were shrinking and the skin was tightening against them.  Only his contracting palms <br />
retained a light pigment.  He clenched and extended his smaller hands.  His fingers were slight, thin but <br />
still somewhat long.  He shoved his hands into his pockets so no one notice and left lunch early.  While never <br />
a stickler for rules, David felt a compulsion to skip his last class today.  He walked out of the school, no <br />
one seemed to even notice.  When he was a block away he began to feel a great craving overtaking him.  The <br />
shaking was back and he felt light-headed.  Automatically his slender hand pulled out a cigarette that he <br />
could’ve sworn he didn’t have before.  How did he even get a cigarette he was… how old was he… 16?  No, 18.  <br />
I’m 18 he reminded himself.  His head was a storm of confusion, he couldn’t think, he couldn’t remember <br />
anything he… was smoking, and with a big puff of smoke, he felt himself relaxing.  For a moment he felt long <br />
locks of hair brushing against his face, but he blinked and the feeling was gone.  Just the smoke.  But his <br />
hair was getting longer, thicker even, maybe somewhat darker.  It had crept down an inch or so as he puffed <br />
away his cares and exhaled his hatred.  Smoke swirling around him, David headed home…</p>
