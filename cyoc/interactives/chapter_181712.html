<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the door clicked shut behind them, Jack was positively ecstatic. He thumped Chris <br />
excitedly on the back. “Dude! He totally likes you!”<br />
When Chris was certain his eyes weren’t about to be knocked out of his skull from the <br />
sheer force of the blows, he spoke acerbically. “That’s not the impression I got.”<br />
Jack was completely undaunted and pulled his friend against his side. “Trust me, bro. I <br />
know these things. You’re in. You’re totally in.” He whooped in delight. “I can’t wait for <br />
tonight!”<br />
“Yes. I can hardly contain myself. Woohoo….”<br />
Jack chuckled. “You’ll see soon enough, little bro. You’ll see.”<br />
“Is this going to be your thing now?”<br />
Jack smirked. “Maybe.”<br />
Chris groaned. “I don’t know if I’m strong enough to survive this.”<br />
“Courage, my friend. Courage. The night is still young, and there are many vain and <br />
foolish delights to tempt and tantalize.” He grinned. “I’ll make a bro out of you yet.”Chris barked a laugh. “You can try.”<br />
Jack smirked. “Wait and see, bro. Wait and see.”<br />
The party went into full swing as soon as the sun began to set. Torches were lit, burgers <br />
were served, and the beer flowed like mead in a Viking feast hall. Drunken revelry filled the air <br />
with hoots, growls, and howls as various antics were performed and thrust on would-be-pledges. <br />
Keg stands, beer pong, the works.<br />
<br />
And all the while, Chris was on guard, ever alert for groping hands and would-be attackers. But these “bros” were more cunning than Chris had given credit for. When Jack had <br />
ceased to serve as a proper distraction, they found other means to “test” him. The card tables <br />
were notorious, especially when they got into a round of strip poker.<br />
Somehow, he always found himself getting stripped. And then would come the familiar <br />
smack of the waistband. By the time he left those tables, his waist felt like it was burning. The <br />
straps had been pulled and snapped so much by now, he was shocked they hadn’t lost their <br />
stretch.<br />
<br />
He stumbled toward the drink table. The tingling had intensified in his feet, and he was <br />
tired of all the antics. But he had promised Jack he’d stay, and he wasn’t about to break his word, <br />
even if the guys were being lunkheaded jerks.<br />
“Rough night?” the keep asked as he filled another cup.<br />
“You could say that.” Chris groaned and leaned against the makeshift counter where the <br />
drinks were mixed, then served in the punch bowl to the side or in individual orders for the older <br />
frat members.<br />
<br />
“Sounds like you could use a pick-me-up.”<br />
Chris sighed. “I just don’t really feel like I belong here, you know?”<br />
“Do you want to belong?”<br />
“I want to be with my friend. Does that count?”<br />
The keep shrugged again. “It’s a start.” He passed a cup Chris’ way. “In my experience, <br />
if you want to feel like fitting in, and you’re having trouble, it might not hurt to get a little help in <br />
loosening up. And no, I’m not talking drugs. We don’t do those here. Ever. Anyone caught with <br />
those gets immediate disbarment.”<br />
<br />
“And what do you recommend?” Chris sipped his drink and sighed. The flavor was <br />
surprisingly sweet, with a warmth that seemed to spread through his chest, then back into his <br />
throat again as the drink went down.“A little liquid courage never hurt anyone.” He shrugged. “Or you could work off some <br />
of that aggression in the other places. There’s wrestling and arm wrestling, you know. Even a <br />
sumo mat and one of those stick pit things. You know, the game where you knock someone off <br />
while you straddle a beam? Try some of them out. Let loose. Live a little. And if you’re really <br />
that upset over something people are doing to you, why not pay them back? Fair’s fair, in my <br />
opinion.”<br />
<br />
“I still don’t know.”<br />
“You don’t have to know to do. Take a risk. Live a little. What’s the worst that could <br />
happen?”<br />
“I get in a fight.”<br />
“Would that be such a bad thing?”<br />
Chris drained his cup and took the second that was proffered. “Have you seen their size?”<br />
“I have. Have you seen yours?” He shook his head. “You think too little of yourself. <br />
Think little and you’ll be little. So stop thinking and just be for a while.”<br />
“Just be? That simple?”<br />
“Simple’s usually the best.” The keep offered a third cup. “A few basic ingredients, and <br />
you’ve got a kickass drink. Why not let it be the same for a man? Isn’t that one of the sayings <br />
people use, the clothes make the man?”<br />
“Yeah, I guess.”<br />
“So, let your clothes do the talking for a while. It’s not like it’ll kill you to try something <br />
different for a night.”<br />
The warmth had spread through Chris’ whole body by this point, and a hint of a smile <br />
pulled at his face, despite his attempts to quash it. “Just for a night, huh?”<br />
“Just for a night. Just to try,” the keep offered again. “Who knows? You might actually <br />
like it.”<br />
Chris chuckled. “Fat chance.”<br />
“Fat is easily trimmed with exertion.” The keep smiled as he took the cup back. “Why <br />
don’t you go burn some of it off, until that chance comes along, hmm?”<br />
Chris sighed. “I suppose I should try.” He rolled his eyes and adjusted his crotch as he <br />
rose back to his feet. “Thanks for the drinks.”<br />
“Any time, stranger. Feel free to come back if you need. I’ve got plenty to choose from, <br />
and good advice to offer. It’ll put some hair on that chest of yours.”<br />
Chris chuckled ruefully. “Can it put muscle on, too?” The barkeep smiled knowingly. “That’s up to you and just how much you decide to <br />
follow those clothes of yours.”<br />
“Sure, it is.” Chris’ cheeks flushed as he walked away from the bar. His legs tensed as he <br />
scratched his glutes. But he did feel a little better. “Maybe just … one game of sumo.”<br />
Chris leaned heavily into his steps as he finally emerged from the cocoon of padding that <br />
had been his badge of honor for the last ten rounds and replaced his shoes. His belly burned. His <br />
blood surged. And as for his rear, well … he was getting used to all the “attention.” If they didn’t<br />
snap his waistband, they smacked him, instead.<br />
“Bro, that was awesome!” one such frat member raved. “You toppled Titan! You toppled <br />
the %&$*ing Titan!”<br />
Chris smiled sheepishly. “Thanks.”<br />
“That’s my bro!” Jack hooted as he pointed from across the way and beat a meaty fist <br />
against his chest in salute.<br />
“To the hero of the ring!”<br />
A cup was shoved in Chris’ face, and he took it. “Uh, … thanks?”<br />
“Go on, bro, drink up! You earned it!”<br />
It … was hot in that costume. And he was feeling thirsty. He took a hesitant sip. It wasn’t <br />
the sweet flavor he’d had at the bar, but it wasn’t bad. There was a hint of orange in the brew that <br />
offset the bitter flavor from the hops. The flush deepened, and a goofy smile pulled at his lips. <br />
He hardly even felt the snap this time around.<br />
He laughed, a curious hiccupping mixture between his usual higher register and a lower <br />
bass. A heavy thump on the back nearly sent him tottering. Then came the deathgrip on his <br />
waistband, followed by the largest snap to date.<br />
And that wasn’t the only thing to snap.<br />
Chris came to, thrashing in some much larger arms. The poor soul that had unleashed that <br />
rage was being raised to his feet. Instead of frustration, though, there were smiles.<br />
“Calm down.”<br />
Chris immediately went limp at the command. He knew that voice, and he knew those <br />
arms. Kyle had broken up the fight. Chris could already feel his sides throbbing.<br />
“Get them some ice to dull the pain.” The others scattered, and soon both men were nursing ice packs. Jack lumbered to the <br />
pair and frowned. “You all right, bro?”<br />
“He’s fine. Just a little too eager, I think,” Kyle rumbled.<br />
Chris’ head felt strangely muted as he looked over the frat president and his friend. It was <br />
like someone had worn out the spark plugs up there, and now he just … existed. He grunted as <br />
he nursed the ice pack. “M’fine, bro. Really.” Kyle said he was fine, so he was fine.<br />
Jack grinned. “Did you just call me bro?”<br />
One of the sparkplugs finally managed to fire properly. “Don’t get used to it.”<br />
Kyle grunted. “If you want to fight next time, do it in the ring.” His thick brow furrowed <br />
like thunderclouds over his eyes. “And remember you’re rushing the frat. That means letting the <br />
rest of the guys have their fun.” He deliberately grabbed the waistband and snapped it. “Get used <br />
to it.” He snapped it again. “Let it happen.” Once more. “Embrace it.” He yanked especially <br />
hard, then leaned next to Chris’ ear after the last snap beat against the pledge’s skin. “You might <br />
just be rewarded.” He chortled, though it sounded more like a growl. “Hell, you might actually <br />
come to enjoy it.”<br />
<br />
Each successive snap acted like a depth charge to Chris’ brain. His knuckles felt sore, <br />
probably from the blows that were exchanged in the fight. His hands ached, as did his feet. His <br />
head tingled as invisible fingers pricked and massaged at his scalp and deep in his conscious, <br />
scouring expertly for those few spark plugs that were still working. His mouth gaped as he stared <br />
into those eyes. The rough handling had forced him into a semi-stoop. “Uhh….”<br />
“Got it?”<br />
Another snap. The voice that answered sounded strangely distorted. “Got it….”<br />
“Good.”<br />
<br />
Chris blinked at Kyle. The president looked … bigger, somehow. His sleeves strained <br />
against his arms to the point of almost breaking, and the hair along his arms had thickened. “You <br />
look … funny.”<br />
Kyle smirked. “So do you. Now get back out there. I want to see you make a real party <br />
animal of yourself.”<br />
Chris couldn’t help but chuckle. “Think I already have.”<br />
“Give it time, Chris. Give it time.”<br />
<br />
A heavy thump on the back almost sent him sprawling. Chris nodded and grunted as he <br />
adjusted the pouch on the jock strap. The thing was starting to feel a little tight.<br />
“Come on, bro.” Jack grinned as he laid a meaty arm around Chris’ shoulders. This time, <br />
the weight didn’t feel so overwhelming. It felt … comfortable. “Let me introduce you to the <br />
world of beer pong.”</p>
