<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sei wandered down the dark hallway looking for Ryan.  As he walked, he could feel his new body fat bouncing, his stomach swaying in front of him. He was dreading having to work this off if they couldn't find a way to reverse it.  How would he ever become a model like this?  He would have to get surgery to fix the extra skin.  Little did he know what was going on in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
  Mike sat on the floor, so fat that he could no longer move.  Forced to eat more of the hyper fattening cake by some unseen force.  He fought against it, but was continually brought back to the moist chocolatey cake by his insatiable hunger.  Each peice he ate, he expected to gain another 100 pounds, after eating the last 11, he should be over 2000 pounds... but nothing was happening to him.  Mike quickly finished off the last 9 pieces of the other cake.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
 As Sei wandered the hall, he felt his stomach become increasingly full.  He felt like he was eating meal after meal.  It wasn't painful, nor was it displeasing.  He just didn't know why it was happening.  His stomach felt tight... come to think of it, his shirt felt tight too... and his jeans!  Sei looked down to see himself inflating once more.  He was getting fatter!  &quot;No!  No!&quot; he shouted as his stomach grew underneath his shirt.  His ass was growing in the already tight jeans, bulging out over the top.  He was up to 340 now.  The shirt buttons were pulling tight, the fabric stretching to fit them, exposing bulging mounds of flesh between them.  The buttons groaned, cried, struggled to hold on, but popped off one by one.  Sei wailed as the shirt popped open, letting his gut heave out and bounce in front of him.  He grabbed on it, trying to contain it, but it was no use.  He heard his pants protesting against the weight, already unbuttoned.  The fly cried out, then exploded, the crotch opening up.  His ass stretched the back, his thighs were killing the thighs of the jeans, seams began popping down every stressed area, and the jeans burst and fluttered to the floor. <br />
<br />
  The 450 pound Sei felt his nipples pass by the fabric of the shirt as his breasts sagged off to each side.  He felt his stomach slowly coming to rest on his dick.  He moved the mound to the side to reveal his once 8 inch dick as a 2 inch nub, nearly crying as he did.  That had been a huge bonus to him as an underwear model, in more ways than one.  He was pushing 600 pounds.  His expanding back and fattening shoulders were pulling the last threads of the shirts back, ripping them apart.  The back of the shirt wafted to the ground lightly, and the sleeves slid down his fat, sausage like arms.  He couldn't wait here and let Mike unwittingly fatten him.  He started running as best as he could, hurting his knees with each monstrous step.  His whole body quaking, his huge stomach rubbing his miniscule erection, actually feeling quite pleasing, maybe a benefit to being so obese.<br />
<br />
  He couldn't outrun the pounds though.  He was quickly approaching 1000 pounds.  It was sheer adrenaline keeping his fat body in motion.  Most guys would be immobile at 980 pounds.  His second chin was rippling as he ran, his boobs shaking from side to side, his whole ass quaking.  &quot;Ryan!&quot;  He called as he walked down the stairs.  He was 1200 pounds now, remarkably still in motion.  At the foot of the stairs, he tripped.  Sei toppled forward, bounding down onto his massive gut.  He was laying on the inflating mound, growing.  Ryan peered around the corner to see what made the racket, and at the base of the stairs spotted the now 1500 pound Sei.  He ran to his fattening friend.  &quot;Sei!?&quot; he said &quot;What happened to you?&quot;.  Sei was panting as his stomach swelled and spread beneath him.  &quot;Mike... and I ate... a cake.  It's doing this to us... Mike is already immobile in the second floor kitchen... now I'm stuck.  You gotta find a way to reverse this Ryan... please&quot;.  Sei was already 1780 pounds when he finished his sentence.  Ryan thought he was going to explode.<br />
<br />
Ryan shook his head... he would go find something to help Sei and Mike.  Sei was over 1900 pounds, he was the fattest guy on earth now... &quot;You better find Erick and Johnny.  This place might do something to them too.&quot;.  Sei's huge body was blocking the stairs.  &quot;Sorry Sei, I've gotta climb over you.&quot; Ryan said.  Sei nodded.  Ryan took off his shoes and started to walk over Sei, he reached his hand onto Sei's back, and it sank into the dark latin skin.  Ryan walked over Sei's back, feeling the skin shake as his friend continued to inflate.  The 2000 pound teen grunted as his friend climbed over his mattress like back, but took it in stride as he continued to inflate.  Ryan jumped off Sei as the last few pounds flooded into him.<br />
<br />
  Sei lay there, unable to move his arms or legs.  He was flooding the lobby with all of his fat.  His waist was over 20 feet in circumference... his breasts were bigger than any woman's he'd ever seen, and he'd developed a third chin.  He wasn't in pain, but in an almost state of pleasure.  He kind of enjoyed this.  As he wobbled back and forth, he could feel his erect dick buried deep in his crotch being rubbed... it felt amazing.  Maybe this was what he was waiting for?</p>
