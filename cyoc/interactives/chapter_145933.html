<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the weirdest experience he&#39;d ever felt. As Ms Redding said she was there if he needed help, Jacob reached out and picked up the item he thought was a tampon. Certain his dick and nuts would get in the way if he tried to wear the pad, he read the label printed on the package, the opened it. Inside, he couldn&#39;t begin to understand what he was looking at and found the best way to describe it was cotton with a string attached stuffed into a tube. Taking a deep breath, trying to remember as much as he could of what Ms Redding had just told him, he gripped the applicator in the spot that felt like grip marks, raised one leg up so that it was almost on the toilet, wrapped his arm around it, then reached down and started to press the tampon between his legs, but stopped.<br />
<br />
There was something off, and it wasn&#39;t simply that he was about to try and insert a tampon inside a place he was sure he&#39;d didn&#39;t have. Staring at his boy parts, his sack brushing lightly against his wrist, Jacob thought there was something wrong with them. After a moment it came to him that his sack was empty. Distraught about this, he almost wailed, &quot;What the fuck,&quot; but, at the last minute, he bit his lip and clamped his mouth shut.<br />
<br />
A sensation of other worldliness quickly slipped over him and he thought, &quot;I need to find Kaitlyn and figure out how to undo this. And Fast,&quot; as he began to breath evenly in an attempt relax, then pressed the tampon into the area between his legs.<br />
<br />
Feeling it slide into a area he was sure wasn&#39;t supposed to be there, Jacob almost freaked out. But, continuing to breath at an even pace, he adjusted so that the tampon was pointed at an upward angle, aiming toward the small of his back. Trying to keep himself from become alarmed by what he was doing, Jacob gently slid the applicator in until he felt his fingers touching his flesh. Finding it was the oddest sensation he could ever say he felt, he pushed on the inner tube into the outer tube until both were even. Struggling for a moment, the pinched feeling getting a titbit worse, Jacob closed his eyes, breathed deeply in through his nose, exhaled through his mouth and was about to tightly grip the tube and take it out, but was distracted when Ms Redding asked, &quot;Is everything all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Upset by this interruption, Jacob almost snapped out that it had been until she broke his concentration. But knowing the school nurse was simply trying to help, he whispered, &quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; as he firmly took hold of the tube and slide it out, leaving the tampon inside.<br />
<br />
A series of emotions washed over him, Jacob found himself amazed that he couldn&#39;t even feel the tampon, frightened by the fact that he was wearing something so intimate, mature that he reached a point in his life that he was no longer considered a kid,  secretive about what was happening to his body, among other things. Stuffing the applicator back in the wrapper, he dumped both in the small trash bin next to the toilet, reached for Kaitlyn&#39;s underwear and sliding them on, he found himself overwhelmed by the realisation that, with his boy parts slipping between his legs, he couldn&#39;t even tell they were there, as his both his dick and empty sack pressed tight and flat.<br />
<br />
After he&#39;d finished, he let himself out of the stall. There, he found himself facing Ms Redding, who said, &quot;There. Now that wasn&#39;t so bad. Why don&#39;t you go wash your hands and freshen up. Then we can go up to my office and figure out what to do next,&quot; and nodding, Jacob hugged himself as he trudged over to the sink, where he turned on the cold water tap.<br />
<br />
His world felt like it sat precariously on the edge and that at any moment it could tip one of two ways. Washing his hands, then splashing water over his face, Jacob gazed at the reflection in the mirror. The image of Kaitlyn peered back and he wondered if he would eventually look like her. Mentally going over how his handwriting was hers, he felt aroused by boys, something that made him nearly shiver, and that he was bleeding like a girl, he wondered how many other things had changed as he suddenly found himself disliking the clothes he was wearing. Shutting off the water, thinking they looked so childish, immature, he took a couple more deep breathes, then went to dry his hands and face.<br />
<br />
Unsure what he could do about Kaitlyn&#39;s choice in clothing, Jacob allowed himself to be directed up to Ms Redding&#39;s office. There, he was given more information about tampon and pad use, including that he should change them around every four hours. Finding a problem with this, he asked, &quot;So, what about when I&#39;m asleep. Should I get up in the middle of the night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms Redding, a smile of comradery on her face, explained, &quot;That&#39;s one of the many issues girls face. You could. Or, you could wait until morning. I think you&#39;ll be fine. But monitor yourself. Your body will tell you if something is wrong,&quot; to which Jacob nodded.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, Ms Redding then asked, &quot;Would you feel comfortable going back to class? Or should I call your mom to come pick you up?&quot;<br />
<br />
This was not something Jacob had expected to happen. Dreading the possibility of going back to class, &quot;And maybe running into the sneering, haughty bitch,&quot; Jacob shifted uncomfortably. After a moment, finding he still didn&#39;t feel too good, he quietly said, &quot;I&#39;d like to go home, if I may.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms Redding, giving him a nod, told him, &quot;If you want, you may lie down. I&#39;ll go an call your mom,&quot; before she stood and strolled purposeful out of the her office.<br />
<br />
Alone, Jacob considered lying down, but instead choose to remain sitting. Shifting uncomfortably, he leaned his head back and absently rubbed at his chest, which thought felt off, but figured it was simply because he was not used to wearing a bra. Thinking about that had happened, finding himself uncertain about what could happen, he thought, &quot;Dammit. I just wanted relive a couple years. Make a couple different choices. Now, I am making choices, but not the ones I should be making.&quot;<br />
<br />
It suddenly dawned on him, as he reached up and rubbed his sore and tender chest, what was wrong with the particular part of his body. Looking down, a feeling of wanting to cry washing over him, Jacob thought morosely, &quot;Jesus. I&#39;ve got tits,&quot; as he took in the double A cup budding that had been forming for a some time now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tits, no nuts and a period, all to add to my woes,&quot; Jacob thought and suddenly wanting to lay down, secretly hoping that by going to sleep he could wake up and be back to his old self, he told himself, &quot;I need to find Kaitlyn,&quot; as Ms Redding came back in, announcing, &quot;Your mom is on her way,&quot; before going to a nearby cupboard and taking from within a box Jacob could see was marked Tampax Gentle Glides, a small package marked Kotex and a small cardboard box he could see what was written on it, but thought it was likely some sort of medication.<br />
<br />
As she handed him the three things she&#39;d taken out, Jacob toyed with something, then said, &quot;If it is all right, I think I will lie down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms Redding making a motion to the nearby cot, she said, &quot;If you nod off, I&#39;ll wake you, okay?&quot; to which Jacob simply bobbed his head in  acknowledgement.</p>
