<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dracona von Karnstein led Taylor down the winding halls of her clan&#39;s manor. The vampire stopped in front of a door. &quot;Well, here it is, Taylor. My room. Shall we go in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, please,&quot; Taylor said.<br />
<br />
Dracona opened the door and led her new werehyena friend in. The room was decorated in an old-fashioned, Nineteenth-Century style that screamed &quot;vampire&quot; to Taylor. In the middle sat an expensive-looking mahogany coffin rather than a bed.<br />
<br />
Taylor glanced at what sat atop Dracona&#39;s dresser. &quot;A mirror? I thought people couldn&#39;t see vampires&#39; reflections.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and no,&quot; said Dracona. &quot;A mirror CAN work on us, but it has to be made of pure, one-hundred-percent silver. Anything else would just show whatever&#39;s right behind us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys are so cool!&quot; Taylor grinned. Shi lowered herself into Dracona&#39;s coffin. &quot;It&#39;s gonna be a bit weird sleeping in a coffin. Mmm, the lining feels kinda nice, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It should,&quot; Dracona laughed, flipping her long cornrow braids out of her face. &quot;Matriarch Carmilla paid enough for it. So, may I please have that thank-you fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor playfully batted hir eyelashes at the nude vampire. &quot;You certainly may. I guess you don&#39;t mind having sex in your coffin? I might get jizz on the fancy lining.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares?&quot; Dracona snickered. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t be the first! Mother Night only knows what some of the stains on this baby are. Let&#39;s forget about messes and get it on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor stroked hir cock into erection (which wasn&#39;t difficult with Dracona&#39;s shapely naked body around). Dracona crouched over the massive hyena dick and slowly lowered her ass to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the ass?&quot; asked Taylor. &quot;You don&#39;t mind the tight fit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Dracona grinned wickedly as she passed Taylor a bottle of lube from the bedside table. &quot;This round little butt has seen plenty of action in the thirty-one years I&#39;ve been a vampire. I enjoy a tight fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor lubed up her dong, enjoying the slippery feel of the gel on hir  shaft. Dracona lowered her ass further, spreading her buttcheeks as she did. Taylor&#39;s cock slowly slid into Dracona&#39;s snug ass. The werehyena marveled at how chilly Dracona&#39;s body was. Between the coldness and the smoothness of the vampire girl&#39;s skin, Taylor felt like shi was fucking a marble statue. It was far more arousing than Taylor had imagined it would be; shi looked forward to doing this with Jinx someday.<br />
<br />
Dracona bounced herself up and down from her crouching position, her ebony braids shaking wildly in all directions as she worked Taylor&#39;s trembling dick. &quot;How&#39;s that feel for you, Taylor, because it feels fucking incredible to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s beyond awesome!&quot; Taylor whooped. &quot;I don&#39;t know why, but I just love how cold you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get that a lot,&quot; said Dracona. &quot;There&#39;s something about vampires that makes being cold the sexiest thing ever. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s magic that makes our cold skin so hot or if it&#39;s just that we&#39;re the ideal kind of cold to turn people on. We&#39;re pleasantly cool to the touch, but we&#39;re never clammy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All I know is that I love it,&quot; said Taylor. Shi fondled Dracona&#39;s grey-brown tits as the vampire bounced on hir dick. Shi savored the sensation of hir colossal cock straining against the narrow walls of Dracona&#39;s tight ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you stay so fucking tight with all the wild sex you have, Dracona?&quot; asked Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vampire healing factor,&quot; Dracona grinned. &quot;It makes the kind werebeasts have look pitiful... no offense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None taken,&quot; said Taylor. &quot;I&#39;m glad your pussy and ass can&#39;t be wrecked, though. At the rate you fuck werehyenas, there&#39;s no way your holes wouldn&#39;t be stretched beyond recognition.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dracona responded by taking Taylor&#39;s hand and sinking her fangs into the werehyena&#39;s furry wrist, allowing her aphrodisiac blood to flow into Taylor&#39;s veins. Taylor began panting heavily as hir arousal heightened.<br />
<br />
Taylor felt her orgasm coming. &quot;Get ready for a blast of werehyena spooge, Dracona!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dracona laughed, rubbing her engorged clit as she pistoned herself up and down Taylor&#39;s cock. &quot;Born ready, hottie!&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor threw back hir head and cackled like the hyena shi was as hir cum exploded into Dracona&#39;s ass. Hir cock gushed jizz like a geyser, and before long Taylor&#39;s cum was leaking out of the African-American vampire&#39;s butt. In the throes of ecstasy, Taylor thought for a second that shi briefly saw the shadowy, insubstantial spirit animals again, just like shi did while smoking weed with Marley Roberts. It seemed that really good orgasms helped as much as entheogenic drugs. Taylor supposed it had something to do with the way both played with your consciousness.<br />
<br />
At the same time, Dracona&#39;s pussy and ass throbbed as her the electric orgasm surged like lightning through every inch of her cold body. She grabbed on to Taylor&#39;s furry sides and stroked them as she sighed in rapturous bliss. As her orgasm reached its peak, Dracona squirted HARD. She thought to herself that it was a good thing she didn&#39;t mind sex stains on her coffin, because she&#39;d just deposited a real beaut on it with that jet of girlcum.<br />
<br />
Once the climax subsided, Dracona pulled herself off of Taylor&#39;s softening dick with a satisfying &quot;pop.&quot; She smiled at Taylor as she stroked hir golden fur. &quot;Well, I&#39;d call that five and a half thank-yous. Thanks for a very pleasurable time, Taylor. Have fun with Shaman Kweli.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor clasped hir clawed hands together. &quot;This is so exciting! I&#39;m finally meeting my mentor! Shi&#39;s gonna teach me so much about shaman magic and werebeast spirituality! I wonder if I&#39;ll have a sexual initiation with hir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can think of worse ways to become a shaman,&quot; Dracona snickered. &quot;I wonder if shi expects you to go in knowing any basics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wondered about that,&quot; said Taylor. That&#39;s why I borrowed Alpha Zuri&#39;s letter to Selena. &quot;The basics of our religion are in there. In a nutshell, The world was created by Father Day and Mother Night. Father Day represents order, discipline, and civilization. I think He&#39;s what Christians call God and Muslims call Allah. He created humans, angels, and wizards. Mother Night was the cosmic counterbalance to Father Day. I think She might be the Goddess from Wicca. She was all about freedom, intuition, and nature. She was behind the genesis of vampires, werebeasts, demons, and faeries. There&#39;s also different witchcraft traditions dedicated to each of the primordial gods.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We vampires worship Mother Night, ya know,&quot; said Dracona. &quot;An ancient Egyptian queen on the run from her evil husband called out to Her for protection, and She transformed the woman into the first vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome,&quot; Taylor smiled. &quot;Anyway, both Father Day and Mother Night have a queen to help Them govern. Father Day has Lady Sun, and Mother Night has Lady Moon. Lady Moon&#39;s the main subject of werebeast devotion. It was Her who brought our kind into existence. Now, both Lady Sun and Lady Moon brought all kinds of spirits into existence. Lady Sun created the angels and organized them into a sort of royal court in Heaven where She lives. It&#39;s called the Celestial Bureaucracy or the Heavenly Host. Werehyenas respect them but don&#39;t usually worship them. Lady Moon created the spirits of nature and sent them to live in a world closer to humanity than Lady Sun&#39;s distant Heaven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little too close,&quot; Dracona laughed. &quot;Humans are always falling into that place, getting lost, and returning home only to discover that a hundred years have past while they&#39;ve been away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the Spirit World for you,&quot; Taylor nodded. &quot;Not for the inexperienced. Anyhow, everything in nature has a spirit, from Mount Rainier to the rock in my parents&#39; backyard. A shaman works closely with those spirits. We ask them to advise us and give more material help, we thank them when they bless us, and we greet them properly when we enter their territory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else?&quot; asked Dracona.<br />
<br />
&quot;The spirits do have a few basic moral commands,&quot; said Taylor. &quot;According to Selena&#39;s letter, we&#39;re supposed to revere the pack above all else, remember that nature is sacred and refuse to rape its bounty out of greed, dwell within Mother Night&#39;s wilds rather than Father Day&#39;s cities (though werecats and wererats apparently ignore that one), and never touch Lady Moon&#39;s sacred silver on pain of death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the afterlife?&quot; asked Dracona. &quot;Being vampires, Clan von Karnstein hasn&#39;t taught me much about that. We don&#39;t need that knowledge too often, y&#39;know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our souls go to a paradise called the Summerland,&quot; said Taylor. &quot;The pack&#39;s departed can be summoned and talked to by a shaman, and they always return on certain holy days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What holy days do werebeasts celebrate?&quot; asked Dracona.<br />
<br />
&quot;All kinds,&quot; said Taylor. &quot;The most important&#39;s the Sacred Hunt every full moon. We automatically shift once the Moon comes out, and we celebrate with a ritual hunt and a massive feast. I&#39;ll have to do all kinds of prayers and songs for both. Then there&#39;s the eight annual festivals: Mean Geimhreadh/Yule/the Darknight, Imbolc/Dísablót/the Reed Dance, Cónocht an Earraigh/Ostarafest/the Seed Festival, Beltane/May Eve/the Greentime, Grianstad/Midsummerfest/the Longday, Lughnasadh/Freyfaxi/First Fruits, Meán Fómhair/Fallfest/the Feast of Faith, and Samhain/Winternights/the Ancestor Festival. The letter seems to be saving the details of most of those days for Shaman Kweli to talk about, but I&#39;d bet the last one was the one where the spirits of the dead come visiting. They letter also briefly mentioned the existence of coming-of-age rites, mate-taking ceremonies, and funerals. That looks like strict Kweli territory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And all that&#39;s just the pre-course reading?!&quot; laughed Dracona. &quot;Boooooy, do you have your work cut out for you, Taylor Wagner! Well, I&#39;d better go rejoin the main orgy. I really wanna fuck Beck if I can get them to tear themself off of Brianna for a second. Bye!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye!&quot; Taylor called out to hir new friend as the door shut. Now alone in Dracona&#39;s room, Taylor closed hir eyes, made hirself comfy in Dracona&#39;s coffin, and prepared to fall asleep. Soon shi&#39;d be with Kweli.</p>
