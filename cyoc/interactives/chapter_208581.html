<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s father, Mike, was a handsome silver fox, the type that women went crazy over. He might be in his 50&#39;s, but his salt and pepper hair lent him an attractive, mature aura and his entire body was lean and muscular, zero signs of belly or fat.  Jeff heard that his father was a hot topic at work--although his attitude there and at home was the same, being perpetually frigid and unmoved even towards his friends and family, to the extent that people gossiped if Mike had facial paralysis, there was no end to his admirers. <br />
<br />
After all, not only was his father mature and handsome, he was extremely accomplished. He was a department director, one of the foremost in the company. Rumors said he was golfing buddies with the CEO, one of the richest men alive. In other words, Mike was an elite amongst the elite! <br />
<br />
Jeff also admired his dad, but he wished he could see different expressions on his face, instead of a perpetual ice block. He also wanted to have a deeper relationship. Mom left them when he was a kid, fed up with Mike&#39;s emotionless demeanor, and it was just the two of them ever since. Mike substituted fatherly companionship with blank checks, and their relationship was stunted. Therefore, it was not a surprise that Jeff wanted something more from this emotionally paralyzed man! <br />
<br />
Jeff casually selected his father from the menu options. He slid the slider labelled &quot;men&quot; to 100%, the slider labelled &quot;women&quot; to 0%, and then then libido meter to 100%. Grinning, he clicked yes to &quot;attraction to family members.&quot; <br />
<br />
He also switched over to his own profile, and made himself gay again. Making sure that &quot;aware of change&quot; was checked for both of them, he hit &quot;apply.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff waited a few seconds before searching up muscular bodybuilders. He felt his cock stand up, slapping against his abs. Yes, it worked again!<br />
<br />
His erect dick on full display, Jeff walked downstairs where his father had been working in the home office. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, this isn&#39;t the time to bother me,&quot; Mike began, but the moment he turned around in his chair he saw his son&#39;s gigantic erection. For some reason his mouth suddenly went dry. His own cock began to twitch in his neat slacks. There was an aching feeling from behind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad,&quot; said Jeff, coming closer, smiling. &quot;I think it&#39;s the perfect time to bother you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike wanted to push his son away, but his body was resisting. Jeff hugged him and he found himself breathing heavily. Unwillingly, his lower body was grinding against his son&#39;s dick. He was getting hard, super hard. The aching in his ass was even stronger now. It was like he needed something there. Something big, thick. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happeni--hnnngh!&quot; Mike wanted to yell, but it came out as a half lusty moan into his Jeff&#39;s mouth, as his son fiercely kissed him. Their tongues intertwined, slurping loudly. His tie was getting rumpled by the action. Jeff tore it off, and his buttoned up shirt too. <br />
<br />
Then, Jeff threw him face down onto the desk where he had previously been reading reports. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want it don&#39;t you? Dad.&quot; Jeff mockingly called his father by their relationship, highlighting the incestuous, taboo nature of it all. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about!&quot; Mike denied, but he could feel it. His ass was puckering open and closed, like it was hungry for something. He closed his eyes.<br />
<br />
In answer, Jeff plunged his cock deep into his father&#39;s ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;HNGH!&quot; Mike gasped. Tears leaked out of his eyes. Sounds escaped from his mouth. As Jeff thrusted, it was as if his moans, the deep magnetic moans of an mature, masculine man, were being pressed out of his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...Dad...&quot; Jeff groaned, &quot;you feel so good, Dad....so fucking good, your little horny pussy&#39;s so soft and wet and tight, it&#39;s sucking on my dick and won&#39;t let go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s eyes glazed over. With each thrust, white hot lightning bolts of pleasure shot through his body like never before. He&#39;d never experienced something like this, not even when he&#39;d first penetrated his ex-wife&#39;s pussy all those years ago. <br />
<br />
Something was coming. Mike felt it building up in his gut, tense and thick with lust. Jeff flipped him over, he grunted and found himself face to face with his son. His son&#39;s face was remarkably similar to his in his youth, he thought absentmindedly as he was getting fucked. <br />
<br />
His son was chanting, &quot;Dad&quot; with every stroke and thrust. He looked up. Yes this was son. The child created from his seed. <br />
<br />
And now...<br />
<br />
His bottom lusted after his dick. <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s face came closer. &quot;I love you Dad,&quot; he whispered, hot breath blowing sensually over Mike&#39;s skin. <br />
<br />
Mike couldn&#39;t it take anymore and came. He screamed as pleasure obliterated his senses, he came senselessly all over his abs even as Jeff thrusted relentlessly into him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good job, Dad,&quot; his son purred, and he came too with one final mighty thrust. Mike felt hot liquid rush into his insides, soaking every crevice. They gasped and moaned together, collapsing into each other&#39;s bodies, and Mike closed his eyes, overwhelmed with exhaustion as everything went black.</p>
