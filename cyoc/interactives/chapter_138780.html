<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;In the end, I ended running up right into you, so are we are,&quot; he finished. <br />
<br />
As he looked up, he saw Kateline was contemplative. he knew it was normal, after all, who would believe such incredible story? <br />
<br />
However, luck was on his side, as she smiled, and then got up. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know him, Ty lives only a few streets down. If you want,&quot; she suggested &quot;I could take you in my car and we could make it like you are my pet, nobody will question us that way.&quot; <br />
<br />
The idea seemed more then a safe solution to the problem of being seen in the streets, and the deer wasted no time to agree. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be happy to accept your offer, Kateline.&quot; <br />
<br />
She took her keys, and glared at him with resolve. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s go, shall we?&quot; <br />
<br />
[At the same moment, in Ty&#39;s room.] <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, why won&#39;t it work?!&quot; <br />
<br />
With a defeated grunt, the teen let himself fall back on his bed. His powers, they were gone now, and he could do nothing! At first, he thought it was because it was something like in Cinderella, that at midnight he would lose them, but the clock only indicated ten PM, so it couldn&#39;t be that. <br />
<br />
He had made Dustin regress, made Buck possess a human intelligence, but the minute he- <br />
<br />
&quot;*gasp* THAT&#39;S IT,&quot; he exclaimed, sitting up abruptly, &quot;I WIS-&quot; the sound of the wall being hit made him realize that the others were trying to sleep, &quot;I wished for Mark to hurt in the head, to have to worst headache of his life...&quot; he looked up &quot;does that mean... that I can&#39;t harm others? Else I won&#39;t be able to use the powers any longer?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty looked worriedly at the door. &quot;I have to try something.&quot; <br />
<br />
Taking his time, Ty finally made his wish. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that my wounds would heal themselves fast.&quot; <br />
<br />
He waited... <br />
<br />
And waited... <br />
<br />
And waited... <br />
<br />
Just as he was starting to lose all hope, an itching began to make itself known on his eyelid, and as he advanced in front of the mirror that took up an half of the wall, the teen was surprised, and mostly relieved, to see that his face was now back at normal, the skin smooth and without so much as a scratch. <br />
<br />
So maybe he was right, he could not harm others with his powers. <br />
<br />
But he had changed Buck&#39;s mentality and body... maybe he could... <br />
<br />
He opened his window, and carefully made his wish. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish... I wish that I could teleport to the ground outside.&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly, pain scythed through his entire body, as he felt himself become less and less solid. He looked at his hand, unable to feel his fingers, or maybe he could only feel them? It seemed like he was made of sand, fluctuating in the air, like mist. Slowly, each molecules composing him moved through the open window, and landed on the ground in perfect order, just a small distance away from each others. <br />
<br />
Gritting his teeth, Ty began to endure the torture, as well as the feeling of being somewhere, yet nowhere and at another place, moving but being immobile too, his brain couldn&#39;t process what he was feeling in a coherent manner, so all kind of sensations washed over him. <br />
<br />
Finally, as he thought the pain alone would kill him, the transfer made a jump in speed, and the human began to disintegrate, Ty&#39;s body really looking like colored sand, picked up by some invisible wind, turning to a mist like vapor, becoming solid once again as each molecules and atoms waited obediently for the others to gather around. <br />
<br />
Within minutes, his body was waiting, there, a troubled image, as if he was underwater and that someone had slapped the surface of the liquid. In one sudden motion, as the last molecules took place, every and each of them collided together, linking themselves back to one another. With a painful gasp, Ty sat up on the cool grass, and checked to see if any part was missing. Luckily everything was there, not even an hair had been lost. As he heaved, breathing irregularly, he promised himself one thing : Never, ever teleport again except if absolutely needed. <br />
<br />
At least he was still in one piece. <br />
<br />
As he stood up and watched his room, a voice he had heard barely hours ago called to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ty?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Buck!&quot; Ty had turned swiftly to discover the deer standing beside a woman he knew well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kateline! I see you made acquaintance with my... friend.&quot; He couldn&#39;t help but blush deeply. <br />
<br />
She simply laughed. &quot;Oh it&#39;s okay, I thought I was having an indigestion and those mushrooms I ate earlier weren&#39;t good, but finally it seems it&#39;s all real.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A bit too real,&quot; grumbled the deer. <br />
<br />
By his expression, Ty knew what made him grumpy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, I see you experienced her tendency to... make conversation, if I can say it that way.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ty,&quot; she exclaimed, pretending to be offended &quot;I am not that annoying!&quot; <br />
<br />
Five seconds passed... <br />
<br />
Then ten... <br />
<br />
And at fifteen all three of them burst in laughter. <br />
<br />
[A few minutes later.] <br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; the woman asked, sipping  on a cup of tea Ty had created, &quot;what do you plan to use your powers for? And what will you two do now?&quot; She shot the deer a glance, &quot;It&#39;s not like Buck can just go back in the woods,&quot; before looking back at Ty &quot;and I don&#39;t think your parents would like to know you can do what you want, and have a deer as a friend.&quot; She glanced sourly at the house. &quot;Knowing them, Buck would be more likely to end up as diner before you can even explain things.&quot; <br />
<br />
Both of her interlocutors lowered their head, not knowing what to do. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like I have any other place to go anyway,&quot; said the teen desperately. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not if you don&#39;t want to,&quot; ironically whispered Kateline, getting a questioning look from both human and deer. &quot;What? Haven&#39;t you thought you could just create an house somewhere calm for the two of you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Everything was silent. <br />
<br />
Until Ty made what was the most beautiful facepalm planet Earth ever witnessed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel so dumb,&quot; he whimpered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t say that, you&#39;re one of my best students,&quot; she addressed him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Only because I like science,&quot; he sneered back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... am I the only one here that doesn&#39;t get what&#39;s going on,&quot; asked Buck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; both of them said. <br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; she asked back &quot;what are you planning to do?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty smiled, &quot;I am not sure, but I think your idea of a little house for the two of us is a good start, I do that.&quot; <br />
<br />
In the blink of an eye, they were in the forest, Kateline&#39;s car included. <br />
<br />
&quot;W-w-what?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he whispered, suddenly out of breath. <br />
<br />
The woman looked back at him, amazed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just... teleported us?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, but I did rotate the planet, teleporting hurt like all hell, I assure you you DON&#39;T want to try that... only if you&#39;re about to... to die, maybe, but even then... god I need to sit.&quot; <br />
<br />
With that, Ty let himself fall. <br />
<br />
&quot;You did WHAT?!&quot; The screech was enough to make him deaf, but his eardrums miraculously survived. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t... worry, I&#39;ve solved that by making the sun  move with it, the gravitational pull should be enough that the orbit of the planets will realign themselves, and if... if it doesn&#39;t then I&#39;ll rectify them myself, I have the power to, after all,&quot; explained the tired teen. <br />
<br />
Kateline looked with uncertainty at her student. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can only hope you know what your doing,&quot; she said, more to herself than him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, your car is still there, you could use it to go back home,&quot; suddenly exclaimed the deer, making the woman turn her head towards it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just where are we,&quot; she asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just... just a bit farther inside the forest then I usually go, it&#39;s the same that is near the town, still close enough for me to go to school, so there&#39;s that... and also the trees are distanced enough for you to use the car, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have made it go with us,&quot; said Ty. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know this part of the forest, you go South, and just before you exit you go West, you will find the road there,&quot; said Buck. <br />
<br />
With a smile and nod, Kateline walked to her car, went in and lowered the window. &quot;Thanks, I&#39;ll come back in a few days, see how you two are doing,&quot; she said, waving before she carefully began to drive away, leaving the two &quot;friends&quot; alone. <br />
<br />
They both shot the other a glance that said everything. <br />
<br />
&quot;Soooo...&quot; they both tried to say. </p>
