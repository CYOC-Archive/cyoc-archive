<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl watched as Charlie worked on his car. Laying down on that rolly thing that slides under his car.<br />
<br />
Charlie was helping out his neighbor and working at Carl's home meant he didn't have all his nice equipment.<br />
<br />
Now Carl's car wasn't an SUV but it wasn't a low rider either and it seemed as though when Charlie slid under <br />
his car that his belly was scraping the undercarriage.<br />
<br />
The coveralls seemed to get snagged as he moved out.<br />
<br />
He rolled out and got up and Carl thought  he saw a tightness in Charlie's coveralls.<br />
<br />
As he leaned over the hood, zipper undone almost to Charlie's navel he saw the reason for the tightness. <br />
Charlie was getting a belly. And not just a small one he was getting a nice big round ball gut. Carl thought <br />
about it and realized that all the mechanics he knew were big men and that must be the reason that Charlie was <br />
becoming more and more like that.<br />
<br />
Looks like you could use a beer Carl said.<br />
<br />
I am a bit parched.<br />
<br />
Carl ran in and got a beer and stood at the fridge door. He might want a sandwich. Carl made a big Dagwood and <br />
then decided that one beer wasn't enough so he got the full case.<br />
<br />
Thought you might be a bit hungry too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Charlie sat his widening rump on the bumper and took the sandwich in a grease stained hand and a bottle of <br />
beer. What would have taken Carl hours to devour Charlie downed in minutes and was quickly on his third beer.<br />
<br />
Tastes good your a good cook.<br />
<br />
Well I wouldn't call that cooking but thanks.<br />
<br />
I bet you would make a good wife.<br />
<br />
Carl thought about what he was saying. I guess. Carl said.<br />
<br />
Charlie went back to his work.<br />
<br />
Hours later and more than a case of beer gone Charlie started up Carl's car and it ran like a top.<br />
<br />
Now for the bill.<br />
<br />
What bill Carl said.<br />
<br />
Charlie headed in and up to the master bedroom. Carl followed and said I will get you some towels. Thinking <br />
Charlie wanted to take a shower. He did take off the tight fitting coveralls but then he turned to Carl and <br />
said take that off. <br />
<br />
Carl just stammered as Charlie came closer.<br />
<br />
Come on boy you know you want it.<br />
<br />
No ... I ...<br />
<br />
Charlie took hold of Carl by the arms and started to take off that white button down getting grease stains on <br />
it. Carl was very smooth almost hairless. He loosened the belt and dropped the tighty whities.<br />
<br />
Nice little pucker there, Charlie said to Carl fingering Carl's hole.<br />
<br />
Carl found himself stunned but enjoying the play.<br />
<br />
As Charlie stuck his fingers in and out of Carl's hole Charlie lifted Carl up like a rag doll and placed him <br />
firmly on his stiffening manhood. Walking toward the king sized bed Carl felt himself opening up on the man <br />
meat. He was in pain but he was too shocked by the events to wish for something else to happen.<br />
<br />
As the two dropped to the bed still impaled on Charlie's cock Carl felt the rod drive itself deeper into his <br />
bowels. That was when Carl realized how much he was enjoying the invasion. His eyes rolled back in his head <br />
and he came without any further stimulation.<br />
<br />
Charlie rammed himself in and out of Carl for what seemed like hours. Passing out after the third or fourth <br />
orgasm he had. And still Charlie hadn't cum once.<br />
<br />
When he finally did cum Carl felt Charlie's balls churn out what seemed like gallons of cum up his ass. Carl <br />
was exhausted. And went to sleep. When he awoke he saw Charlie laying there next to him with his with his <br />
necklace around Charlie's neck.<br />
<br />
That's mine. Carl said.<br />
<br />
It was. Now it's mine.<br />
<br />
No No No you don't understand it is a family heirloom.<br />
<br />
Well then I guess I am your family now. Cause it's mine.<br />
<br />
Please give it back. Carl plead and plead with Charlie but there was no way he was going to force it from him <br />
he had to get it someway else.<br />
<br />
Charlie dressed and left as Carl trailed after him trying to get his necklace back.<br />
<br />
It did fit more like a choker on Charlie's thick neck but he like that Carl was so adamant about getting it <br />
back and that made him want to keep it more. <br />
<br />
Carl did eventually move in with Charlie. Charlie kept the necklace away from Carl and eventually learned it's <br />
powers. But never in the rest of his life did he wish himself to change. He enjoyed this dominant grease <br />
stained mechanic that he was and never felt there was anything better for him. He did however make wishes <br />
about Carl and the other mechanics that worked at the garage.</p>
