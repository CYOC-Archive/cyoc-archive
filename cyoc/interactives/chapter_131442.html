<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you approached the area where the orc was you saw an arrow that you narrowly dodged. You stopped and looked and saw three figures. You had guessed that the three for their own reasons wouldn&#39;t have been working together, but sadly they were smarter than you thought. You could hear them saying something but they were to far to hear what exactly. You went more into the open where they could more easily see the fact that you had some girl over your shoulder as a hostage. Along with the fact that you could vaguely be described as humanish.  they were mumbling something with each other. <br />
<br />
The orc frustrated yelled &quot;Drop the girl and I&#39;ll fight you by myself!&quot; <br />
<br />
You then yelled &quot;Or... drop the axe and i&#39;ll fight you three without this girl!&quot; The three exchanged a glance and the Orc tossed his axe into a bush and you simply tossed the girl aside and let her body just fall onto the dirt. After the last session she wasn&#39;t particularly conscious. You then quickly ran to the Orc and punched him extremely fast, and grabbed hold of him. You for sure were stronger and faster than him and the orc was just stunned and didn&#39;t recognize what was going on till it was too late. He started to grow smaller and smaller, younger and younger. When he started to struggle from your grasp his muscles and strength had weakened too much. The human with the shotgun couldn&#39;t shoot without hitting the orc as well, but the elf was firing around however his arrows were just glancing off your naked body. When the orc was no more than a newborn you tossed him towards your two enemies. The elf with his dexterity drop his bow and grabbed the little orc who was to young to comprehend what was going on. The human now seeing an opportunity fired his shotgun at you, and like the arrows  the pellets simply bounced off.  <br />
<br />
The elf not noticing the bullets bouncing off said &quot;How do you miss with that?!?&quot; <br />
<br />
The human said &quot;I didn&#39;t, Is this thing part ghost?&quot; <br />
<br />
The elf&#39;s eyes glowed like his sisters and said &quot;The thing&#39;s soul is just completely black... and that mask also has a black soul... Aim fo-&quot; You ran directly at the elf who set the orc baby down as you grabbed him and started squeezing as you started to drain him as well. It was going to take awhile though considering elf lifespans. The elf tried to choke out &quot;Mask... Shoot the Mask...&quot; The human understood what would happen otherwise and took aim and fired a shot relatively close range. Some smoke cleared and nothing seemed to happen. <br />
<br />
The Mask said to you &quot;Ah elves... So much energy. That boy can just keep shooting and nothing will happen.&quot; <br />
<br />
You thought to the mask &quot;Elf taking too long... I&#39;ll drain him fast...&quot; then bit into the elf who was just beginning to look like a preteen as you sucked him more and more dry. You dropped the husk and said to the human &quot;So then... It&#39;s your responsibility for taking me down right? What is your plan?&quot; <br />
<br />
The human said &quot;As the man of the house at the momment!&quot; You went and slapped him with some of your magic in the slap. The magic entering his body started to shrink him slightly as the man&#39;s hip bones started to expand as his chest started swelling. The human went to his knees as his body shifted to female. <br />
<br />
You said &quot;I see no man. There&#39;s a woman over there... A baby... A husk... and some woman... Shall I treat you as a woman then?&quot; The human was speechless as you pushed her down and then proceeded with your rape. The human woman was screaming in ecstasy as your incubus part did it&#39;s job sucking lifeforce from her. Then the mask&#39;s magic started sapping her age when her sexuality was getting pretty low. In the end you were left with two babies, a corpse, and an unconscious woman. you just threw the corpse further into the forest and then grabbed the two babies. a little girl human, and a little boy orc and went to the woman. Curious to see what would happen you started with the orc baby and started regressing him while shoving him into the vagina of the woman. The unconscious woman probably would&#39;ve been going through a lot of pain if she was conscious, but in the end you managed to unbirth the orc into the human. More interested you did the same thing with the baby girl, and now the woman was pregnant with two babies with neither being her own. You sighed thinking &quot;Seven people left... well eight I suppose but I wonder how I can play this off.&quot; Thinking of something silly you brought the woman whose clothes were in tatters and belly was extremely big and brought her to the front door. You rung the bell, and used the mask&#39;s magic to shrink yourself and force your way into the woman&#39;s womb where the other two were in. One of the people inside answered the door thinking it was the heroes only to find the woman and a bunch of people came and helped move her inside and onto one of the couches. They weren&#39;t exactly sure who she was but she kind of looked like someone they knew and this seemed to odd to ignore. The woman woke up and seeing everyone felt a little more comforted and then felt a kicking sensation at her stomach and looked. She had indeed been turned into a woman and now she was pregnant and just started screaming. <br />
<br />
Someone got her to calm down and she explained &quot;The Young One... Folium must&#39;ve found her body in the lake as the one Trish... Was a fake and... That monster... She didn&#39;t even leave a corpse behind... Then...&quot; breaking down in tears &quot;turned me into a girl and raped me... I guess that may be why I&#39;m so pregnant.&quot; <br />
<br />
One of the people said &quot;Wait... That can&#39;t be right you&#39;ve only been gone for half an hour at most. There is no way you could be that pregnant from just a single rape in that short amount of time... Looks like you have three kids in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman gasped and said &quot;The way I think Trish was killed the monster said... was by making her younger and younger... what if the three that went to fight it.&quot; She put her arms around her belly. <br />
<br />
Another person said &quot;Ok this is getting too crazy. I&#39;m calling the cops.&quot; no one protested and the cops were called.<br />
<br />
The mask wondered &quot;What the hell are you planning?&quot; <br />
<br />
You said &quot;I&#39;m getting a ride out of here. Maybe during the night I can end up getting someone else in here as well.&quot;</p>
