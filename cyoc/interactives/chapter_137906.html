<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I found it hard to really do anything while my friends slept, and I couldn&#39;t get to sleep even if I wanted to. I guess since when did inanimate objects feel tired. As I drift off in thought, I found it oddly funny of where my situation had taken me. I could only see, feel, and hear as a part of it, but thank God that I couldn&#39;t smell or taste myself. Though I wondered what I&#39;d smell or taste like, given that my face was currently made of parts of Sam&#39;s own feces. Now I found it oddly fascinating, like I even called myself &#39;Sam&#39;s litterbox&#39; besides my real name sometimes, wait what was my real name again? No, it was John or James. Jack? Jerry? No it was Sam, but Sam was my friend, no owner. I was Sam&#39;s litterbox. Yes, that had a nice ring to it. I kept repeating that to make myself feel more special. If only I could look over at my owner, the only time I saw my owner was when he used me. I imagined Sam using me again giving more details to my face. That&#39;s me being useful, that was why I was special because of Sam. What a great owner Sam was to me, I was lucky to have an owner like Sam.<br />
<br />
Before I knew it the sun shined down from the windows and started to wake up Keith and Sam. They both stood up and did their stretches, when I tried sneaking a peak over at Sam, which I only saw a tail in my view.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey master, did you have a lovely sleep.&quot; I asked before anyone could say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Sam said now showing his face towards me, which got me excited. He gave a sniff and gagged. &quot;Dude, you reek.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry master is displeased with my smell, could I help by holding your morning waste?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I do feel like I need to go, so sure?&quot; Sam stepped onto my face and began to pat my sand. He then showed his cat butt as he raised his tail squatting towards my face, a thing I&#39;m all too used to seeing as my owner does his business. A nice soft turd dropped onto my face as you then got to feel it as it molded into it, then another one came. My owner than kicked some sand onto my new facial features as the ritual goes and stepped off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you master for using me.&quot; I said overjoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is he talking about Keith?&quot; He then addressed Keith the German Shepard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that he thinks you&#39;re his master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That silly,&quot; Sam dismissed. &quot;Hey dork, who am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My master and owner.&quot; Sam looked at Keith a little afraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I meant, what&#39;s my name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam&#39;s litterbox.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No your real name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure what you want to call me, a litterbox like me shouldn&#39;t have a name, master. But if you want to call me something, I wouldn&#39;t feel like it fully suits me. I&#39;m just your litterbox after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop calling me &#39;master!&#39;&quot; He yelled, though he looked at the door hoping no one heard him. &quot;Your name is... um. What was his name before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m starting to forget his name as well. This time span has really messed up our memory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why can we remember our names and lives before and not, him?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, maybe since litterboxes don&#39;t usually talk, that he sees himself as a litterbox as well. His mind might be deteriorating as well as our memories about him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dork!&quot; Sam exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is dork my name now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, look do you remember before you were a litterbox?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember being a human before, than you turned me into a nice litterbox. No that can&#39;t be right, how could humans get turned into a litterbox, that&#39;s just weird. Oh yeah, you picked me out in the pet store. I remember since you looked excited to use me. I&#39;ll never forget that day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, that day never happened. You were a human before, we were friends remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you be friends with me. I&#39;m not necessarily friend material.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Sam could retort, the room door opened. Both Keith and Sam stood at attention waiting would come in. An officer and another German Shepard came into the room with the officer standing at attention by the door. The K-9 officer walked over and looked at Keith, Sam and Sam&#39;s litterbox which he could see was more dirtier than before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you find the keys?&quot; Keith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, if I did find the keys I&#39;d be human won&#39;t I?&quot; The officer barked. &quot;The reason I&#39;m here is that you have a new room mate who we found at a pound. Luckily no one noticed the occurrence so this case is still under covers. Now before I show him to you, he&#39;s a little afraid of his... transformation, so I hope you try to get along.&quot; With that the officer went out and out came a big St. Bernard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, how&#39;s the case going? Don&#39;t leave, you have the right to tell us.&quot; The door closed on Keith, who the cop looked back at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We actually do have the right since you&#39;re all here locked in this animal shelter. Don&#39;t worry, if all goes to plan we&#39;ll find that bitch soon.&quot; The dog paused. &quot;I don&#39;t mean literally, also your friend seems to stink up the place. We&#39;ll send someone to fix that.&quot; Then the police dog left out of sight.<br />
<br />
Sam and Keith looked at the dog standing in the middle of the room, with a sad look on it&#39;s face. &quot;So what&#39;s your name?&quot; Sam asked breaking the silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bruno?&quot; The big dog replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Sam, and this is Keith. We used to be humans like you, but my litter- I mean friend changed us into this.&quot; Sam said trying to paint me out of the picture since a talking litterbox might be too much for the St. Bernard. The dog looked confused at first then said, &quot;Oh you&#39;ve got this all wrong, I wasn&#39;t transformed, my owner did.&quot; Sam and Keith both looked at each other confused still not able to solve this mystery<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s your owner?&quot; Keith said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m not sure he want&#39;s to come out just yet.&quot; Then they heard the dog whispering, not fully understanding what he&#39;s saying. There was a little shouting at the end, but the dog then looked back up at the dog and cat. &quot;Okay, I think he&#39;s ready to come out now.&quot; He said as he slowly turned around, still confusing Sam and Keith. His tail was tucked between his tail and quivering a little bit. It then lifted up revealing what seemed to be a face hidden on the back end of the dog. There were a pair of green eyes that blinked that folded over his fur which seemed to make it look incognito. Like no one could tell somebody&#39;s hiding behind that fur. It&#39;s mouth formed right between his eyes, yet it&#39;s lips were loose and full like a human&#39;s lip. The thing then opened his mouth trying to build up to say &#39;hi&#39;, but it was too soft to hear. <br />
<br />
The duo didn&#39;t know what to say, never would have thought a dog would present it&#39;s rear and they couldn&#39;t take their eyes off it. &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Sam&#39;s litterbox. how do you do?&quot; I asked it, though I couldn&#39;t quite see what it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Bruno&#39;s anus, it&#39;s nice to meet you.&quot; The thing mumbled, resembling what seemed to be a little boy. &quot;Hey, what did I tell you about calling yourself that.&quot; The dog exclaimed. &quot;Sorry, my owner calls me Matthew.&quot; the dog sighed. Looking back at the two who still felt like this had to be a dream, Bruno commented, &quot;He was my little master who was eight when he got hold of the keys, who knows what he said to become this form. Before I realized my favorite person in the world was now my butt. Before I could use the keys again the boys parents threw me out. He was first a little afraid, but later he started acting strange. He started to call me master, and he called himself my anus. We roamed the streets for months until a dog catcher caught us yesterday then went to the pound, now we got transferred here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still look up to him as your owner?&quot; Cat pondered. Bruno nodded. &quot;Why just because he became something he wasn&#39;t doesn&#39;t mean I still don&#39;t look up to him. Also did that litterbox talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that was our friend who turned us this way. I can&#39;t say that I don&#39;t mind it, being a cat, but now my friend thinks he was always my litterbox. He thinks I&#39;m his master as well.&quot; Bruno nodded then his tail went down covering his owner. &quot;He&#39;s very shy about being seen by people, he can control my tail which lets him hide whenever he wants. Anyway, I&#39;m hungry. What is there to eat here?&quot;</p>
