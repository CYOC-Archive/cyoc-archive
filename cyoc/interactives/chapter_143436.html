<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack woke up the next morning and rolled out of bed. Then he stopped. He had hit his arm on the corner of his dresser. He never did that. He always hit his forearm or elbow, but now he hit his upper arm. Now in pain but happy at the same time knowing he got younger, Jack slid on a pair of shorts, not jeans, at this point in his life he wouldn’t wear jeans. He hated the feel and now in the younger body he was in, it felt wrong for him to wear anything but shorts. It was warm that day so beside the blue shorts he put on, he grabbed a Spider-Man T-shirt too. He ran to the bathroom where they kept his scale. He didn’t look overweight anymore. Not super toned or skinny, but not fat anymore like he normally would have been at this age. He jumped on the scale and was shocked when he only weighed only 120. He hadn’t weighed that in years. Since late sixth grade. He didn’t know if he was seventh or eighth grade but pretty sure he was older. He got the measuring tape and he was 5’4. Still pretty y’all for his age. The athletic part was kicking in. He now knew he was in eighth grade, but was 13 because of his February birthday and it being late August, the start of football season. He was a football star up until the end of the eighth grade season. He was now living his dream, but not entirely. He still wanted to be younger. He had breakfast and his mom drove him to the middle school where he met up with his friends before they went to gym. He got changed into his gym clothes and went out and was the star of the team. It was the best gym class he’d ever been in. They went through two more class before they got to history, but when he got there something was wrong. He knew this was where he should go for history, but this was in the seventh grade wing. He walked in and all of his buddies were waiting for him. He walked right up to them and they looked the same as before, except now they were surrounded by seventh graders. He took a pause before he tenssed up suddenly and then he was fine. He looked around at his friends and they looked younger too. He then realized that he was now a seventh grader too. And his bowl cut he had up until the end of seventh grade was back too. His shorts were the same color but a smaller size and he was now 105 pounds and 5’1 still pretty tall for his age. He then went about his day until school got out. It was uneventful until a girl walked up to him and started chatting with him. She was really cute and Jack knew from experience that he was in a twelve year old body, but still had his sixteen year old mind. His friends started making a kissy face and he was mad. Even though he knew better, all he wanted was for his friends to stop. He knew her name was Sarah, and he also knew that at 12, he couldn’t talk to a pretty girl like this for this long without getting a boner. I mean she had B-cup boobs people. How could a seventh grader turn that down. His penis couldn’t either. His penis was now in a raging boner and had shrunk from its normal six inch hard mode to only 3.5. His puberty hadn’t really kicked in yet. He asked if she wanted to go to the park by his house tonight and she said yes all giggly. He got in his mom’s car and left, sticking his tongue out at his friends because he knew that that really got to them. He got home, did his homework and then went to the park and sat on the swings. She was supposed to meet him here at 5 but he was so excited that he got there ten minutes early. He hadn’t had a girlfriend before so his body wasn’t reacting like it knew what it was doing. However, he hadn’t had a girlfriend for about a year in his head so he was super anxious. He knew he could stop the machine at any time so if this went well, he might just stay this way for a while. When she showed up she ran over to him and sat on the swing beside him. They talked for a while and Jack asked if she wanted to go on a walk. She said yes do the two of them got down and started walking beside each other. They continued talking but Jack could only focus on one thing. He wanted to hold he had. Normally, he would have been super horny but his age got the better of him. He just wanted to spend time with her. Her hand was swinging and she was talking away, but kept glancing down at his hand, almost like an invitation. He then made his move, and reached down and grabbed her hand super romantically. She stopped and asked what was he doing. He said that he thought this was kind of a date and he wanted to and thought that she wanted to too. She said she might have, but she was a seventh grader. She wasn’t about to date a sixlet. That’s when it hit him. His horniness has gone away because he hadn’t hit puberty when he was eleven, and that was what he was right now. A 4’10  90 pound sixth grader. He was so embarrassed that he turned to run home. He could feel the tears forming in his eyes and the feeling of just wanting to disappear. He would have handled it better, but even though his mind was still sixteen, he was eleven and this was a natural bodily response. Sarah shouted at him to comeback and his old mind took over. He stopped and with a little sniffling, he turned around to face her. His eyes were red and his cheeks were red. It was super obvious that he had been crying. His old mind told him this and now both minds wanted to get out, but Sarah ran over to him and asked what was wrong. He said that he thought he was on a date with a really pretty girl and that she liked him a lot and he just wanted to hold her hand because she was so cute. He told her he even wore what he thought was the coolest shirt he had so it could impress her, but it didn’t and now she thinks he’s weird and they can’t be friends again. He said all that while holding back tears. Sarah, who was a bit taller than Jack now that he had shrunk due to his most recent age regression looked him in the eyes and gave him a hug. He wanted to feel better but his body still had a few more tears to cry so he left her right shoulder have it. He knew she could feel her shirt getting wet because of the tears and that made him want to cry less, but it made him cry even more. She broke off the hug after what felt like an eternity because it was so good but embarrassing at the same time, and sat down on the bench that was best to them and motioned for him to sit down. He did, still sniveling a little bit. She said that he was actually kind of cute and that she might consider dating him. They were both in sixth grade together after all. That’s when he stopped crying and looked up. He then realized, that now that she was a close friend, like a girlfriend, she would de age with him. He now stopped crying and asked if she would be his girlfriend and she said yes. He walked her back to her house, and when she stepped inside he turned around and pumped his fist quietly saying yes yes yes!  He had just got himself a girlfriend, and both his mind and regressed body were both estatic. He turned to go off the porch when he heard the door open and turned around to see Sarah reappear. She had taken her shirt off and was gonna shower, but wanted to give him one more hug so she went back out side in just be A-cup bra. Jack turned around and almost audibly gasped but he kept it to himself. She gave him one big hug and he, now being shorter than her, fit his head perfectly inbetwen her two boobs. This was heaven to both part so him. After that, which sadly for Jack only lasted ten seconds, he went back home and went to his room. He didn’t know if he wanted to stay this age or not. So he went up to the Chronivac and...</p>
