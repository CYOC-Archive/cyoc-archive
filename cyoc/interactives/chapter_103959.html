<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Nate left to meet Alex in the woods as he usually did after sunset. They didn’t always end up having sex, sometimes they just walked around the forest. But tonight, Nate had important things to tell his mate. Very important. He’d waited until after they changed and walked to their usual spot to tell Alex about his mom’s pregnancy. <br />
<br />
“Wow! And they think it might be a hybrid?” Alex exclaimed once Nate finished telling him the “big news”. It was amazing to him that Nate’s mom was pregnant, and by his late father. The odds of that happening were slim. And then the odds the baby turned out to be a hybrid were even slimmer. <br />
<br />
“Ya, maybe. Mom said they’d run some more tests later on to verify the baby’s species. But it’s definitely a girl.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“Cool. Wait, does this make me an uncle? Or something else?” Alex wasn’t sure what to call himself in relation to the upcoming addition to the Anderson. <br />
<br />
“Mmm, I think it’d be a bit weird to go around calling you ‘Uncle Alex’, since technically you’d be Wilma’s brother-in-law. I doubt we’ll be calling Cassie ‘Aunt Cassie’.” Nate pointed out. <br />
<br />
“Wilma? You’ve already picked a name?” <br />
<br />
“I guess. Nothing’s set in stone though. I get why Mom wants to call her Wilma, for my dad of course, but it’s kinda an old fashioned name. I wouldn’t want to grow up with that kind of name.”<br />
<br />
“Shallow much?” Alex chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Hey, would you want to live your life with people calling you something like Alfie, or Rudolph?” <br />
<br />
“Point taken. What names were you thinking of? And it better not be anything stupid that ends in a ‘y’. God I hate all the ‘Amy’s and ‘Brittany’s. We’ve got about five of each in our class.” Alex of course overlooked the fact that his own mother’s name was “Shelley”. <br />
<br />
“I dunno. If I had a daughter, I think I’d name her something like Madison or Charlotte.”<br />
<br />
“Ya, because those names aren’t old fashioned.” Alex rolled his eyes, “Besides your issues with the name, how is Eric taking the news?” <br />
<br />
“About the same I am, so good. Although the news did get him worried about Cassie.” <br />
<br />
“Cassie? Why? He doesn’t think she’ll leave him does he?” Alex knew the last thing Cassie would do is hurt Eric like that. She wasn’t a complete airhead like a certain other she-wolf was (*cough Megan cough*). <br />
<br />
“No, nothing like that. It’s more that he’s worried about becoming a father too soon. And I’m not ready to be ‘Uncle Nate’ yet either.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
Being gay, Alex never had to worry about things like birth control pills. He often forgot that the straight were couples had to go the extra mile when it came to their relationships. <br />
<br />
“Well you can tell him he shouldn’t worry about Cassie getting pregnant. I’ve known her for years. She’s never had trouble remembering to take the pill before. And I doubt she’d start now.” Alex said. <br />
<br />
“I didn’t never though she would. It’s just Eric being his usual overthinking self. Somethings never change.” <br />
<br />
“Guess so. Hey, want my mom to come over sometime? I’m sure she could give your mom a few pointers, this being her first were pregnancy.”<br />
<br />
“First?” Nate repeated skeptically. He honestly couldn’t see his mom dating after what happened to his father. Well, not dating other men that is. Women, maybe. Right now the only thing Nate would see on his mom’s mind was the little girl forming inside her. <br />
<br />
“You never know. Maybe your mom wouldn’t mind having another kid, I mean another after this one.” <br />
<br />
“Huh, I wonder how she’d do it?”<br />
<br />
“Well, again, I’m no expert. But I think the way it goes is there’s a man and a woman. And then after the guy takes her out for a nice dinner and they both drink enough wine they go to a hotel room. And then…”<br />
<br />
“I don’t need a play by play. Geez, is that how your parents told you about sex?” Nate grimaced at the thought of his own parents giving him “the talk”. They did everything but break out the sock puppets to demonstrate. Nate just sat there horribly embarrassed, while Eric asked as many questions as he could think of. <br />
<br />
“No, just what I learned from TV and movies.”<br />
<br />
“You know I’m going to expect you to take me out for that nice dinner with wine and a hotel room in the future?” Nate teased. <br />
<br />
“Who needs all that fancy stuff. Right here is just fine.” Alex said, literally jumping Nate. The pair crashed to the ground, interlocked in a kiss. <br />
<br />
Nate wrapped his legs around Alex’s back and urged him down. Alex began licking the tip of Nate’s penis, before slowly engulfing almost half of it. Alex only stopped once he got to the knot. Nate’s claws dug into the ground, as he waited patiently for Alex to continue. <br />
<br />
He growled as Alex’s muzzle worked over his rocket. His legs still wrapped around Alex, Nate could feel Alex’s tail lashing back and forth as his arousal built. After a while Alex moved up from the red rocket to tease Nate’s chest. <br />
<br />
Their canine-hoods touching and rubbing against each other they both came rather quickly. But things didn’t stop there. Nate flipped Alex over with one clean motion and proceeded to slide his dick between his partner’s furry ass. Forward and back, as Alex’s tail lashed faster and faster in anticipation. <br />
<br />
“What are you waiting for? Go on.” Alex almost begged. Nate only obliged when Alex whimpered softly. Then and only then did he start pushing inside until his knot was in. The pointed tip of Nate’s cock shook with every thrust. He knew he wouldn’t be able to hold back much longer.  <br />
<br />
“Almost?” Nate gritted his teeth as his motions go more and more sporadic. <br />
<br />
“You’re holding back stud. Afraid I can’t take it?” Alex taunted him. Nate smirked and pulled so far back he was almost completely out of Alex’s hole. Then bent over to whisper in Alex’s ear. <br />
<br />
“Oh I know you won’t be able to take it. You still want it?”<br />
<br />
“What do you think?” Alex glanced over his shoulder, also grinning at Nate. <br />
<br />
“Alright, you asked for it.” Nate said. He dug his paws into the ground and then pushed himself so far forward he thought he might pop out the other end of Alex. Both howled so loud you might have been able to hear then in Seattle.</p>
