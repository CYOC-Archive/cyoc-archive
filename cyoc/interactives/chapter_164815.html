<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was almost 48 hours since the attack, the rest of the first day was spent under sedation after the surgery, the second day, the news was broken that Jeff was now partially demonic, tests were taken in the morning and by evening he was given the doctor&#39;s findings. Now, morning again, Jeff was wondering what life meant now that he was becoming part fallen angel and couldn&#39;t help but watch the clock and think of which class he would be in right now.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down at the barely visible scars where yesterday huge gaping wounds were. His mortal wounds were healed within just two days. He was trying to deny it, to say this is an elaborate prank, and that he wasn&#39;t really having transformation fits, it was trick clothes or something, but even he didn&#39;t believe that.<br />
<br />
Every human he loves, he will have to watch die... his mom... his friends... his extended family, and then what? Come to Hell and purify souls through torture? <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s pity party was cut short by a knock at the door. &quot;Come in please.&quot; Jeff called startled. <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s jaw dropped agape as none other than Lucifer the Second came into his room. &quot;Hello Son, it seems we are to be more closely related than I had previously imagined, and our relationship will last much longer than I had originally anticipated... So I thought it was time we spoke.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was speechless. Should he call him Dad, King, Great redeemer of Hell? Jeff had been next to Lucifer 2 once, at a conference on Earth, Jennifer brought him to as a date. Lucifer 2&#39;s priorities were political and didn&#39;t have more than a moment for Jeff, who was focused on Jennifer anyway. This time, unlike when they first met, Jeff could feel Lucifer 2&#39;s presence tangibly. <br />
<br />
Lucifer meandered about the room as he continued, &quot;Not a boy, and not yet a man. Not a demon, and yet not quite human.&quot; Lucifer&#39;s eyes locked onto Jeff&#39;s, &quot;Quite the precarious situation you find yourself in Jeff.&quot; Lucifer dropped his gaze and went back to focusing on the rooms decorations. &quot;Very few demons have ever been born, Jeff, did you know that? Most were angels, led by my father to their own ruin. I, Jennifer, and only a few handfuls of others have the title of actually being hellspawn, or &quot;born&quot; of Hell. Most have been here since the fall.&quot; <br />
<br />
He glanced back at Jeff every now and again, &quot;This means that any demon you meet, is probably much, much older than you, and also me. Most of those in your classes, are millenia old, but have not set foot on earth since God commanded them to create the beaches and sky. So your world, its history and teachings are new to them and they can sufficiently pass as emotionally unstable teenagers. So although the younger form is new to them, their self-control over their abilities and understanding of how to use them had been mastered long long ago.&quot; Lucifer glanced appraisingly at Jeff, &quot;Perhaps I should start at the very beginning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Demons feed on sins, it is our price to pay for the role we played in bringing sin into your world... you know this. But similar to how humans farm animals or plants, we nurture the evil in humans. Contrary to popular rhetoric, we don&#39;t like to cause pain or the inappropriately named &#39;Devil&#39;s Choices&#39; because sin is proportional to the options you have. Stealing is wrong but if it is the only immediate option you have to survive, it gets forgiven. Therefore, we prefer more selfish, pleasure seeking behavior than other things. Premature loss of life is like harvesting a flower instead of a berry, a waste. Demons are necessary creatures that are not responsible for a fraction of the atrocities attributed to them but humanity has always rightfully sought to steer away from us and thus we have been... demonized.&quot; Lucifer chuckled at his own pun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though you may have been accepting of individual demons, I want you to understand demonkind are not inherently evil or bloodthirsty. Yes, the process of cleansing souls is painful, like any restorative therapy, and it is also mandated by God as our duty. We are eager to do it, gleefully so. To force us to obey, God made our experience of soul cleansing similar to how I would imagine your kind experience consuming drugs or alcohol.&quot; Lucifer paused to let this all sink in before adding, &quot;All things work to the glory of God... Whether we like it or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All Demons have a humanoid form they can take. Some can take many forms, and others are strong, fast, can teleport, read thoughts, conjur items, or invoke feelings like love, wrath, or fear. Incubi and succubi are excellent farmers of sin able to invoke all the seven deadly sins across a number of people which may continue to grow even after you move on. So in addition to your human form, you can invoke love, become a different male, know the sexual needs of any you touch as well as the most attractive form you can take for them, but that isn&#39;t your greatest power...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucifer drew the moment out, &quot;Through intercourse, you can transform humans slightly. You may have heard of succubi or incubi feeding on the life force of their &#39;victims.&#39; This started when an incubi back in the 1200&#39;s used his abilities to seduce a 17 year old boy. The boy confessed desires to be more like his oldest brother. The Incubi accommodated making the boy older, hoping to make all the siblings jealous, misunderstanding that the boy actually just wanted to be stronger. Back then, not all demons were aware of the problems with a 17 year old becoming 25 in a week. The boy lied, blaming a Succubi and thus the rumors began.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, your powers are out of control because you need to feed. You are exuding an intense aura of lustful abandon strong enough that even I cannot look at you directly without wanting to undress. You must feed and learn self control before returning from Hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff had no idea. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I don&#39;t know how to turn it off. Or how to eat a soul.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You eat the sins of the soul, not the soul itself, Only God can destroy a soul as it is immortal and will be released once cleansed.&quot; Lucifer corrected, seeming perturbed by the misunderstanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, but how do I even...&quot; Jeff began, getting cut off as Lucifer suddenly pulled Jeff into a hungry and passionate kiss. Jeff&#39;s mind was flooded with all the knowledge he needed to know how to sexually please Lucifer. Instinctively Jeff&#39;s hands reached around to the crevice between Lucifer&#39;s back and his wings and tenderly stroked making Lucifer shudder with pleasure. Jeff could feel Lucifer&#39;s penis pressing against his pants and could sense it crying to be free, Jeff&#39;s own penis leapt up and he began rubbing his crotch on Lucifer further stimulating them both. A deep moan escaped one of them though neither knew who it came from.<br />
<br />
Lucifer suddenly grabbed Jeff&#39;s hair, pulled back, and expelled something from his mouth into  Jeff&#39;s before turning away and averting his gaze. Lucifer was panting and still erect as was Jeff. &quot;Rest, digest, practice your abilities, then we can teach you how to feed yourself.&quot; Lucifer conjured a full length mirror into the room and as he made for the door he glanced at a confused/surprised Jeff, lustily saying, &quot;oh fuck&quot; before quickening his pace. At the door he paused and shuddered letting out a soft moan. After taking a few heavy breaths he opened the door, stepped outside, and shut the door behind him. Jeff heard him cautioning the guards not to open the door for anyone without his explicit order to do so.<br />
<br />
Jeff was left staring at the closed door. Did he just make the ruler of Hell jizz in his pants? He slowly got off the bed, going to the mirror he saw a muscular man who looked weathered and tan. Probably mid 40&#39;s with short hair and heavy stubble, graying. Jeff jumped back saying, &quot;oh shit&quot; as the stern looking man did the same. This was the first he actually saw himself transformed, it was surreal.</p>
