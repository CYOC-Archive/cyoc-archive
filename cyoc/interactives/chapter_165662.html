<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Right before Ophelia reached her next orgasm, Heather pulled out her fingers. The abruptness of losing all the building pleasure shocked Ophelia. Opening her eyes, she looked up at Heather pleading for her to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet&quot; whispered Heather, as she stroked one of Ophelia&#39;s long ears. Surprisingly, they also were very sensitive when stroked, once again building up Ophelia&#39;s next orgasm. Nearing her limit, Ophelia prepared for the release, only to have Heather stop just before once again. <br />
<br />
Now annoyed that she was being played with, Ophelia&#39;s eyes shot open and she now glared into Heathers eyes. However, Heather stared right back at her. <br />
<br />
Seeing that Heather wouldn&#39;t give in, Ophelia reluctantly spoke &quot;stop teasing me&quot; with a pout on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, but your too cute to not tease just a little bit. You kind of act like a puppy you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a puppy, no matter how cute I am.&quot; Argued Ophelia. She knew Heather was still just teasing her, so she didn&#39;t really take it too personally.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, you are very cute. But you also are something else.&quot; Hinted Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You are submissive to me&quot; revealed Heather. Her words for some reason made Ophelia even more turned on. She never really considered it before, but now it somewhat made sense. Heather had always been the dominant one between the two of them. And while she never abused it, or tricked her into doing things, Ophelia understood that following Heather&#39;s lead somehow felt natural. <br />
<br />
She mentally tried to picture both sides. First she imagined being dominate over a submissive Heather. But for some reason, she just couldn&#39;t see it ever happening. The personalities just felt wrong. <br />
<br />
So she the moved on to the inverse, where she was submissive to a dominant Heather. This time, not only did everything align, but it turned her on immensely. She was submissive to Heather. No, she loved being submissive to Heather. Her place was in Heather&#39;s arms, following her lead. <br />
<br />
She knew that shd was not a masochist by any stretch. And also that Heather was not that sadistic, just dominate. However something inside of her must have accepted her submissiveness a little too well. Remembering Heather&#39;s earlier comment about her being similar to a puppy, Ophelia realized that she wanted a collar, to show that she was Heathers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want a collar.&quot; Ophelia demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;A what now?&quot; Asked Heather, missing her request.<br />
<br />
&quot;A collar, or like maybe a choker with an engraved gemstone showing that I am yours. You said I am like a puppy. Well puppies get collars from their owners. So I want one from you.&quot; Requested Ophelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? I am happy to give you an engraved choker, but once I do, you will be mine forever you know? I tend to be protective of my things, and I will not plan to share you, or let anyone else have you. That will also go the same for you. If you become my pet, I expect you to only have love me, our family, and anyone I tell you, understand? I promise not to ever mistreat you, or do wrong by you, as long as you promise me the same, and that you will be obedient to me.&quot; Heather knew her request was very selfish, but she didn&#39;t want to lose her lover now that she finally got her. And she was really only speaking about being obedient when the two of them were having kinky sex. <br />
<br />
However, &quot;Yep, sounds good. I promise to be your pet for forever.&quot; Was what Ophelia exclaimed almost immediatly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now wait, hold on. Think it over at least. For the record I don&#39;t just want a pet. I also want you, who maybe occasionally will role play as my pet. But more often than not will be Ophelia, my hot ass girlfriend. This was kind of just my way of inviting you to kinky future sex, since you asked for a collar. I didn&#39;t mean you would literally become my pet for the rest of your life.&quot; Explained Heather, surprised once again at how easily Ophelia accepted a misunderstanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, yeah. I can agree to be your hot girlfriend, who occasionally, becomes your obedient pet. Well, I think I always will be obedient to you though. Because you are right, I really am submissive only just to you, and it feels amazing to be this way.&quot; Admitted Ophelia, hugging Heathers waist, her head now resting once again face down in Heather&#39;s cleavage. <br />
<br />
&quot;You little shit. Fine, after this, the 2 of us will head out. We will go to a jeweler and I will order them to engrave a gemstone. You will be selecting a choker band to attach it to. Once it is ready, you will wear it all the time. Well obviously not in the shower or in a few other places, but any other time. Ok?&quot; Offered Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I can wait to become your pet.&quot; Squealed Ophelia. <br />
<br />
&quot;Girlfriend, you are more than just a pet to me, understand? Now calm down a bit&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Ophelia calmed down a bit. &quot;Yeah, I understood. I am now your girlfriend. And you are mine. Though if I am being honest, since when were you a lesbian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since you became a girl. I had already made up my mind that we would be together no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that sure is dedication. Honestly, I doubt I could really adapt as easily if suddenly you became a man, and I was still one too.&quot; Admitted Ophelia, experiencing a mixture of emotions. She was impressed, touched, and slightly ashamed with herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I actually have had a suspicion that I was bisexual for a while now anyways. Guess this just confirms it. It&#39;s crazy how this worked out, you know? You invite me out as friends, and then you somehow manage to become an anthro-dragon girl. Only for my lifelong wish to be fulfilled because of it.&quot; Reflected Heather, now cuddling Ophelia, who had curled up in her arms, though her face was still face down in her cleavage. Her tail had sonehow made its way around her back, encircling the two of them. <br />
<br />
After a while of silence, where the two just stayedin that poaition, with Heather gently rocking Ophelia, as if she was her adult sized baby. Ophelia decided to break the silence. &quot;So if for example, I was able to become a man again, would you be sad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all. But I will admit that if you did become a man again, I would miss this cute girl I see in front of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you prefer me as a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I like you for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But if you had to choose.&quot; Insisted Ophelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would it matter? I like both. But, if I really had to pick, I guess this form? I don&#39;t get to fuck a cute anthro-dragon every day otherwise you know.&quot; answered Heather.<br />
<br />
Heather&#39;s answer confirmed Ophelia&#39;s indecision. She would definitely rather remain in her current form as Ophelia, than go back to being a man named Drake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, you got any toys around here? Or will we have to get some of those too while we are out?&quot; Questioned Heather suddenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Toys? Like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, dildos, vibrators, plugs, handcuffs, bondage gear, that kind of stuff. Got any of those hidden around?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just became a girl, so no.&quot; Said Ophelia. But suddenly she remembered the lamp. &quot;But I can get them quickly, or even better things!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hopping up out of Heathers arms, Ophelia jumped off the bed, unconsciously gliding accross the room with her wings. She hadn&#39;t really realized yet, but she now moved with her wings as if it were second nature. Reaching for the laml, she was once again greated by Beldazarr. <br />
<br />
&quot;Having a pleasent evening Mistress?&quot; Beldazarr asked with a slight bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, super. Thank you for asking. I am really, really happy with how things turned out so far.&quot; Ophelia said excitedly.<br />
<br />
Heather just watched Ophelia begin speaking to nothing. However, she had entertained an idea which she felt was now more plausable. She somewhat figured that Ophelia knew a bit more than she let on about her current circumstance. And once she grabbed a lamp, it all came together. &quot;Are you perhapse talking to a genie, Ophelia?&quot; <br />
<br />
Both beldazarr and Ophelia turned and starred at Heather. &quot;It looks like she figured us out&quot; whispered Ophelia to Beldazarr. <br />
<br />
&quot;It appears so, would you like me to introduce myself to her as well? If I do so, just remember that she may possibly end up becoming my Mistress&quot; warned Beldazarr. <br />
<br />
&quot;Its fine, I trust her.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, Ophelia and Beldazarr briefly explained his magic to Heather. However they kept the details of Ophelia&#39;s earlier wished a secret. They also didn&#39;t tell her how she could become his Mistress, not that they didnt want to, but because as a precaution, keeping it to one Master/Mistress prevents more conflicts.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do you think, Heather?&quot; Asked Ophelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m intrigued, to say the least. And I am not mad with you for trying to hide it. I understand why you would want to. But damn you can be an air head sometimes. Anyways, so your saying all you have to do is make a wish, and he grants it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I make one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can wish for it for you, but you need to tell it to me first&quot; explained Ophelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I just want to try something. Don&#39;t be mad, I dont want it to be a permanent thing either, but just for tonight I would like...&quot;</p>
