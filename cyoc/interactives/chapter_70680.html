<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the next couple weeks that passed Bradley noted that his size increased, but his weight pretty much stayed the same. He wasn't sure how he knew this, just that he did know. As he increased to the natural size of a horse that walked on its hind legs, he noted that his days fell into a pattern as he was led out of the stall in the morning and either put out into one of the pastures to graze or hooked to one of the various pieces of equipment on the ranch to work. When evening came, he was led back into the stall and given a feedbag to eat from.<br />
<br />
And of all that was happening, the only thing that really concerned him, besides the fact that he was being treated like a horse, was that every farmhand refused to listen him and addressed him like he was some Mare. Unsure about this, Bradley found himself constantly glancing at his male genitals just to make sure that they were still there.<br />
<br />
When his parents finally returned, Bradley was sure that his troubles were over. But when they came out to the stables, they treated him as nothing more than another horse. Horrified, feelings of confusion washing over it, it slowly dawned on Bradley that his old life was over as he realised that all this time what he thought had been human words were nothing more than nickers, squeals, snorts, grunts, neighs and other common noises a horse made to communicate.<br />
<br />
Unable to believe this, Bradley continued trying to communicate with both his parents and the farmhands, but found himself losing faith as the days went by and it became more and more apparent that he wasn't going to be understood.<br />
<br />
Wanting to simply vanish, Bradley sunk into the routine of his days and for the moment forgot about what he really liked to do. He stopped walking on two legs and though it was uncomfortable, he forced himself to go about on four. He allowed himself to be saddled when his parents or one of the farmhands wanted to ride him. He offered no complaint when he was hooked to one of the machines and forced to work. And when he was put out to pasture, he avoided the other horses as best as he could.<br />
<br />
Presently, Bradley slowly became aware that there was a new farmhand and that the new help had taken an interest in him. Studying the new farmhand, Bradley thought he knew the man from somewhere, but found himself drawing a blank as to where. And than it came to him that some time ago, Bradley wasn't sure how long ago, he had visited a carnival and this was the man he'd spoken to about buying a horse.<br />
<br />
Terrified of the man, unsure as to why, Bradley found himself constantly doing everything he could do to be away from the new farmhand, something that proved nearly impossible. And than the man spoke to him.<br />
<br />
It happened as Bradley was being led back to the stables and as the gypsy man led Bradley into the stall, he whispered, &quot;I warned you that this would happen. But you didn't listen,&quot; and fetching the nosebag, the man added, &quot;Now nobody knows who you are. Any person on this farm that knew you before now thinks of you as a horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wanting to cry, the feeling of confusion washing over him, Bradley nickered out, &quot;I'm sorry. I do not know what you are talking about. But if you can help me, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man ran a brush lightly over Bradley's body, almost as if he was brushing an actual horse and grinning, he returned the brush to its proper place asked, &quot;Do you even know what it was that you did to deserve this fate? What it was that has turned you into something that is about a quarter horse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, Bradley neighed out, &quot;I've done nothing wrong. I don't deserve what has happened to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still grinning, the man produced his tobacco poke and as he began to roll himself a cigarette, he calmly stated, &quot;I warned you about your form of trespass and how it was viewed as a form of cruelty. You deserve this. If you were to repent, maybe something could be done. Until than. Well I see a long life ahead of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The feeling of wanting cry, Bradley squealed out, &quot;Wait. At least tell me what I've done.&quot;<br />
<br />
His straight lighting itself, the gypsy man took a drag and started to walk away. As he did this, he commented, &quot;Repent and maybe all will be forgiven.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure how to takes this, Bradley neighed out, &quot;Come back,&quot; but when it became clear that the man wasn't going to come back, Bradley squealed out, &quot;I've done nothing wrong. I don't deserve this,&quot; and turning about in the stall, he nicked out, &quot;I've done nothing wrong,&quot; before finally laying down to rest.<br />
<br />
The next day, as he was led out to the pasture, Bradley thought about what the farmhand had said, but found himself unable to come to any conclusion as to whether he'd done something wrong. Absently he began to move about the herd and when he spied a Mare called Fresca, he decided that he hadn't had a go in a fair bit and that some horse fornication just might ease his mind.<br />
<br />
Moving closer to the Mare, he gently brushed against her and when she nickered at him, Bradley moved slowly around behind her, trying to decide how to mount her. Rearing up on, Bradley pitched himself forward and coming down on the Mare he felt her shift beneath him. Not caring if anyone was watching, Bradley shifted his position and grabbing at the Mare's man with his teeth, he prepared himself to penetrate the horse beneath him.<br />
<br />
But before he could get anywhere, Fresca kicked him in the shins and pulled away. Daunted, Bradley tried to realign himself and once again received a kick, this time in the belly. As the Mare pulled away from him, Bradley wondered what was the horse's problem and he felt his hand touch back down to the ground, he decided to try it once more.<br />
<br />
Moving closer, Bradley was just about to prepare himself to launch up onto Fresca when suddenly he felt something mount him from behind. Letting out a squeal of terror, knowing what was about to happen, Bradley tried to pull away, but instead wound up shifting himself so that he was in a better position.<br />
<br />
And than he felt the horse jabbing at him with its erect penis and this time, when the horse thrust its erect member into Bradley, he knew for sure that the horse wasn't raping him anally but was actually having intercourse the normal way a male and female would. And than, as Bradley felt something shooting into his body, he felt the horse slowly slip off of him and turning to look behind him, Bradley thought for a moment he was looking at a horse he'd never seen before. But than something caught his attention and focusing, he realised that what he was looking at was a horse's tail flicking back and forth.<br />
<br />
Understanding of what had just happened, Bradley tried to stand up on two legs to get a better view, but instead flopped back to four. Trying again, he not dropped back to four and than, in the process of dropping, rolled over on his side.<br />
<br />
It was in the process of trying to look at his own tail that Bradley also discovered that, besides that fact that he was now a quadruped, the fine white horse hair now ran all the way up his back legs and covered him all the way to the waist. Staring at this, he also became aware that his male genitals were now missing and for a moment he couldn't figure out what he was staring at. Than, uttering a squeal of alarm, he neighed out, &quot;I didn't do anything wrong!&quot; as he realised that he was looking at genitals that would naturally be found on a female horse and that he had a long, flowing tail to cover both his vulva and his exposed anus.</p>
