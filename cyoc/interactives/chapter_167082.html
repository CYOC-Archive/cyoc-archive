<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The fog seeped it&#39;s way into the car, but instead of installing the chronivac into the car it linked you with your car as it modified the car. You didn&#39;t notice it&#39;s most obvious change, but you put your keys in the ignition. As you turned it along with the engine starting you could feel the vibrations as your dick hardened as you let out a moan and started to breathe heavily. Fuck you felt like it was time for a good wank, but in the middle of public that felt like a bad idea... Could this be something similar that happened at work? You also felt really hungry which was odd as you usually never ended a shift at the burger joint ***** with much of any appetite by being surrounded by grease and salt all day. However checking the gas tank it was nearly empty. All right time to go get the tank filled before going home for a wank then. You went to put the car in drive, but being cautious you looked and... Your automatic had turned to a stick shift, but underneath the stick shift was a switch. On the side that it was currently on was on M and the other side... the letter was faded? Whatever you were an Automatic man and as you flipped the switch the automatic stick shifted to a manual one, but on the other hand you felt the tightness in your crotch leave. Looking down past your flat chest you didn&#39;t notice a bulge on your crotch at all, and took a quick look in your pants... And found panties and a vagina starting to leak it&#39;s wetness a bit. Yes this was just like the chronivac at work, but you could change back easily... Just go to the gas station, fill up the car, drive home, turn back and hope this was all that happened today. <br />
<br />
Shifting the car into reverse nothing seemed to happen until you hit the gas just a smidge to get the car going. Then your vision got a bit higher at which point you just slammed the breaks and went back to your &quot;normal&quot; height. You swore if there was a cop you&#39;d get pulled over for drunk driving or something... you just let the break off and as the car increased in speed you saw your butt growing. It stopped growing after the car hit the maximum speed while going reverse with no gas pedal. It was a nice butt, but when you pressed the breaks it flattened again to a small bony butt. Taking a breath you wondered how long this ride was going to be if just getting out of the parking spot was a bit of a hassle. <br />
<br />
Set to drive you let go of the breaks and let the car start to move forward there was a tightness in your chest. A quick glance while there was no traffic as your car got faster and your chest seemed to surge forward just a little. Then again you were barely reaching 5 miles an hour, and as you reached the stop sign to the actual road your chest flattened again. There was no one in the way and you hit the road and put on the gas a bit as you went on the 30 miles per hour section of the road to the gas station. Unlike in the parking lot where you drove through at five miles an hour at barely an A-cup accelerating to 30 kept causing your breasts to swell to F-cups and strain against your seat belt... although your clothes weren&#39;t straining for some reason. Heck you could more easily feel a bra on your breasts now as they provided support. Being horny while driving was probably not the best idea, but with your breasts overinflated it took a lot of concentration to focus on driving instead of trying to relieve yourself. Each stoplight a godsend as your sensitive breasts shrank flat and each green light and nearby traffic forcing you to accelerate and feel the glorious sensation of your breasts expanding and erogenous goodness seep dopamine into your soul. Without much issue you managed to get to the gas station and was taking a breather. The keys out of the ignition cured your horneyness, and all that was left was to open the gas tank. As you opened up the hole you pour the gas into though you felt an odd sensation as your pussy felt like it was getting stretched wide... which it probably was... although being out in public meant you wouldn&#39;t have time to check on your crotch. Instead it was time to fill up your... cars tank... Buying the gas was the same as always, but when you got the pump when you started inserting the tip of the pump into your car&#39;s tank you felt something trying to enter your crotch and yelp a bit. You looked around, but thankfully no one noticed. All you could think was &quot;Great... I&#39;m going to fuck myself.&quot; You slowly put the pump into the tank as it felt like a warm dick was slowly inching it&#39;s way down into your womb, and then it wouldn&#39;t go in any further. You were kinda curious and wondered what jiggling the thing would do, but decided against it... now to just... pull the trigger... Your hand was shaking unsure if you really wanted to do this, but if you didn&#39;t you probably weren&#39;t going to go home. You gave it a quick squirt, and it felt like a warm spurt entered your womb. &quot;Just like a band-aid... just rip it off...&quot; You pulled the trigger and quickly locked it and leaned against your car. The gas pump was essentially a giant dick stretching your vagina spewing a continuous stream of hot cum. You were sweating for a minute or two as you were stifling your moans as the gas spewed into the gas tank. The gas stopped flowing with a sudden Holt and a jiggle of the gas pump stirred feelings in your pussy. <br />
<br />
All you could think was &quot;Ok... just pull it out... slowly... pull out...&quot; and slowly taking it out felt amazing in it&#39;s own way... just do it slow enough or you&#39;ll moan and draw attention. By the time you yanked it out you nearly came over half a dozen times. Closing the gas hole your pussy went back to normal and you sat in your car for a bit as you breathed in and out trying to calm yourself. As you grasped your keys your right hand shook as you put it in the ignition and turned it and yourself on. <br />
<br />
Your drive was much like it was last time as horny and sensitive giant boobs weren&#39;t a great combination, but at least traffic was lighter. What was worse was when you got to the road section that increased to 50 miles an hour. Your breasts seemed to swell nearly to the steering wheel and you were afraid what would happen if you had to go on a highway... Would you be forced to take the back roads for the rest of your life? or give up driving? Regardless by the time you got to your house you were glad. Feeling your breasts shrink to nothing felt like a breath of cold air in a Sauna, and with the keys ripped out of the ignition you just panted at being able to rest properly without being horny... although you were slightly turned on still. Not even thinking about turning back into the guy you went to your apartment and tired you just threw off your clothes and flopped into bed fingering your flat self to sleep. The fog seeping out of the car and thinking about it&#39;s next move.</p>
