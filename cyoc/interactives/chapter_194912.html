<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You are going to transform into ...&quot; Kyle paused, thinking for a moment, then laughed brightly to himself. &quot;An alien! No, an alien queen. I&#39;m not going to be any more specific than that because I want to see what aliens are really like. I want the curse to use an actual alien species. I guess the only caveat I&#39;m going to add is that whatever you turn into has to be able to survive on Earth, or you have to have whatever ... accessories, I guess, that you&#39;d need for that. So if your new species needs to breathe something besides air, you&#39;ll have a device to allow that. Or if you need heavier gravity, you&#39;ll have something to account for that. I don&#39;t know. That kind of thing. But your actual form ... yeah, whatever, I just want to know what an alien queen looks like. Okay. Yeah, that should do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle snapped again, and Jen came to, slowly. She glanced around her room - she was dimly aware that Kyle had just done *something* to her, but couldn&#39;t figure out what. Her mind really had gone completely blank and she hadn&#39;t even fully comprehended his words. Just that he was talking, and that he&#39;d laughed at her, and ...<br />
<br />
Her stomach gurgled. She pressed a hand against it, suppressing a groan as her insides churned. Clutching her phone in her other hand, she started pacing the room. &quot;What the fuck did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah, you believe in the curse now, do you? Tell me, what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t believe in your stupid curse,&quot; Jen lied. &quot;Fuck off.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she hung up, and allowed herself to fall backwards onto her bed, kicking her legs grumpily as her stomach continued to churn and growl. As she laid there, she felt the bed begin to move beneath her. She had to scoot forward if she wanted to keep her legs off the edge. Then it happened again, and again, and after a moment she realized that the bed was completely still - her torso was just growing longer and longer. With a sudden, painful jolt, her waist cinched in impossibly thin, and her stomach bloated out huge and fat just above it. As her torso grew longer, a similar process happened again - almost like she&#39;d gained yet another waist and stomach. She ran her hands down herself, and realized her body as segmenting - like something between an ant and a millipede, almost, distinct sections on a still-lengthening body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; she whispered to herself, reaching up to wipe at her chin, which felt oddly damp. Her hand came away sticky and wet, and she frowned at the sudden sweet taste in her mouth. She swallowed, and a thick fluid seemed to coat her throat in the way down. It tasted ... sort of like honey. Where would honey have come from?<br />
<br />
She closed her eyes for a moment, allowing herself a pained, uncomfortable groan, before pushing back onto her feet. She needed to see herself in a mirror. But her still-changing body was now too long and soft for her to stand properly, and she collapsed forward, barely catching herself on her arms. Her body&#39;s segments squished gently against the floor; they had an awful lot of give. Each one was swelling underneath her as she lay on the floor, bloating up soft and round. <br />
<br />
By this point, she had to be nearly ten feet long, with nearly all of that length made up of blobby segments of squishy flesh. The skin of her segments was a pale, sickly white, like that of a cave creature - something that had never been exposed to the sun. Her mouth hung open, and she felt more of that sticky substance coating her neck and chin. &quot;What is happening to me?&quot; she tried to ask, but all that came out was a rhythmic squeaking, rasping noise. She gasped, and tried to speak again, only to be met with the same abject failure.<br />
<br />
Jen tried to scream, but instead felt her throat and chin bloat up, then deflate as she let out a noisy croak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen? Your Highness?&quot; her mom called, knocking on the door. Jen squeaked miserably in response, and her mom laughed, cracking the door open. &quot;I know, sweetie, but you have to go to school. I don&#39;t see any eggs in there, so no excuses, Your Highness!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen felt her throat swell up again, instinct guiding her toward another, angrier croak - a long, low rumble escaped her gaping maw as she tried to voice her complaint.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re just going to have to try harder to get some suitors to fertilize you, then, but until you do - c&#39;mon! You don&#39;t want to make your species look like a bunch of slackers, do you, hon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was more than a little confused about how her mom was treating her, but couldn&#39;t figure out how to ask. Maybe if she had a pen and paper to write with - she did still have arms, though she noticed those were starting to change, too.<br />
<br />
School, though. Okay. Fine. School. How was she supposed to get there? She tried pushing herself up on her legs, but they felt pitifully weak, and way shorter than they&#39;d been before ... all this. Plus, her body was a whole blobby mess of fat, squishy bits - her tits pressed against the ground, her head staring up pitifully at her mother, and her mind utterly aghast trying to comprehend what she was becoming. She was nearing fifteen feet of confused, miserable cheerleader. Was she still a cheerleader even like this ...? She stared at her hands, watching her fingers thicken and fatten, some of them merging together until she was left with only three fat fingers. Thick, sharp claws pressed out where her fingernails used to be; at least each digit seemed to still be opposable, so she could pick things up much the way she used to. She prodded at one of her fat, blobby segments with her claws, feeling the way the skin gave beneath her own touch as she bloated ever-fatter. Even lying on the ground, she was nearly waist-high to her mother, lifted up by the sheer volume of swollen flesh of each soft segment.<br />
<br />
Her vision blurred, and for a moment Jen thought she was going to cry - a pretty reasonable reaction if she did say so herself - but then, instead, she felt an odd sensation. It was like her eyeballs themselves were swelling - bloating outward, growing huge and unblinking as they protruded from her face. <br />
<br />
To make matters worse, she felt them start to cinch in on themselves, almost like how her body felt each time it produced another segment. Like someone was tightening a belt, she felt her eyes get pressed  down the middle until - pop! She had a second set of them, slightly smaller and set directly next to the first. Trying to comprehend her new range of vision made her dizzy; this only got worse as another set swelled out on top of her head, and another on the back. Her hair fell out in sticky, honey-laden clumps as more and more eyes grew and divided around her head. Each eye was a jelly-like sac, without pupils or eyelids or lashes; just a big blob hanging off of her heavy, bloated head. <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon,&quot; her mom laughed, gesturing Jen forward. &quot;Inch along, Your Highness, get a move on. Just because you&#39;re a queen doesn&#39;t mean you can slack off when you&#39;re not laying.&quot;</p>
