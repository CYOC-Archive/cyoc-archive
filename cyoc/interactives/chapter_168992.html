<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Dr Jenkins walked, he began to once again feel odd sensations all over his body. He immediatly began to panic, knowing that his antidote apparently didn&#39;t fully cure him, but possibly just gave him a few minutes to be human again. In other words, a temporary fix was all that the unfinished serum could be called. <br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins&#39; watched as his hands once again turned black, forming into the hoof-like hands from before. Though this time he had notably more dexterity. Even though he was reduced to having only 2 large fingers and a bulky thumb per hand, they were still just as flexible as his human fingers were. Of all the things that would be changed, this was a crucially important, and a blessing, since it meant that he could still work on the cure. Everything left of the transformation would simply just be considered as an annoyance by him. <br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins tried to calm himself down as he tried to readjusted his posture in order to better support his inevitable pair of massive breasts. As if on queue, his nipples shot out from his chest, both lengthening to just about 4 inches, as fat and breast tissue began piling up behind them. Having felt this happen before, Dr Jenkins wasn&#39;t quite as disturbed, but it still was an offputting feeling. Having to carry his big tits with his arms supporting their weight, just to shift his center of gravity so that he won&#39;t fall because of them. Now able to get a proper look at them, he did have to admit that they would have looked great on a women. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, he was soon to be said women as he felt his gentiles begin to shift around, forming back into a large cow pussy. Dr Jenkins sighed, having no choice but to accept that she was going to be a women now for a while. She only could thank her cure for the fact that she was still mostly human, for now. <br />
<br />
With a rumble, her udder reformed, albeit not nearly as large as a real cow&#39;s, but more proportioned to be suited for an adult woman. It was just about the same size as both of her boobs combined, and came with 4 additional teats.<br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins could only thank her luck that the cure had corrected her body proportions to be for a human and not a cow. Her body may function like a cow, but at least she looked human enough to still pass it off as body fat, and not sloshing, engorged, orbs of milk and fat. However, luck wasn&#39;t always on her side, as her tail regrew. Sadly, this meant she could no longer wear pants to work, as her tail will either show through them, rip them, or not fit into them. She was a &quot;skirt and dresses only&quot; girl for the foreseeable future.<br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins nearly fell over when her legs and feet began reverting. And while rhey were no where near being cow legs, her legs were much stronger now, fully able to carry her weight properly, and without issue. Her feet however, had become half-hooves. Her toes had fused into 2 halfs per foot, hardened and turned black. They also forced her heel into the air, locking it in place above the ground. Because only the small area of her toes were carrying her entire weight, Dr Jenkins had become wobbly. Using the wall for support, she slowly made her way to a nearby equipment/clothing storage room. After fumbling with the door knob, she managed to open it and slipped quietly into the room before she was found. <br />
<br />
Locking ut behind her, she now had the room to herself for a bit. The room was a storage closet for spare uniforms, lab coats, spare casual clothing for both men and women of all sizes, etc. The lab had stocked this room in case any unfortunate accident had ruined their employee&#39;s clothing. It actually happened quite often, and since nothing was permitted to be cleaned at home, wmployees would simply use the facilities here for all their laundry and clothes shopping, which is why these rooms were always kept fully stocked. <br />
<br />
After a bit of digging around, she had managed to find enough clothing for a full outfit, though one without any panties since she couldn&#39;t get them to stay on her with her tail and udder always being in the way. She now had on a black knee length skirt, and a white blouse. She had even found a large enough bra to hide her teats with, not to mention hold her M-cup tits. That being said, she had also taken an N-cup and an O-cup bra too, knowing that she would need them as she filled up with milk. All of the clothes she had also picked out had been stored into a large duffel bag that were usually kept around for large wardrobe swaps when changing inventory. <br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins began to make her way out of the room. Her 5&quot; heels clicking with every step. She had on a whim tested them to see if they would help her balance at all, and to her surprise, they were exactly what she needed. With her new foot ahape, wearing heels was just as comfortable as her old shoes had been shen she was a human man. She was walking in them like a natural right from the start too. Plus they made her legs look sexy, as he had discovered that what she thought was just a plain old skirt, actually had a slit that went all the way up to her side until it reached her hips which also had gotten larger, same with her now quite shaply ass. For aome reason, she felt that it looked alright on her still. Even made her feel kind of sexy. A thought which quickly returned Dr Jenkins to her senses, though not enough to take off the skirt.<br />
<br />
As she was about to leave, a glint of light hit tge corner of her eye. Glancing over, she saw it. A golden ring. Except, unlike the normal finger rings, or earrings, this ring was a septum piercing. A larger one at that. The center opening was about 1.5 inches in diameter, and Dr Jenkins couldn&#39;t fight the urge to immediately put it in. <br />
<br />
Wincing from the pain, she had just impaled her nose with the piercing tool, and fastened the ring through the new hole. With her current hands, it would be near impossible for her to remove it on her own too. The golden ring hung just above her upper lip, and while she couldnt see it, she felt every bit of it. From every breath, to simply changing her facial expression, the ring would move around. <br />
<br />
Now that that was over with, Dr Jenkins finally regained control over her body. No longer burdened by her new random urges to harm herself, she was able to quickly make her way out of the building and into the zoo. Her clothing was enough that people would at most give her passing glances, obviously intrigued by her massive boobs. However, that worked in her favor too. As people would ignore the rest of her body, like how her skirt kept moving oddly in the back, or how her feet and hands had a black colloring near the toes and fingers, or how she only had 6 fingers total, including thumbs. All that was left for her to do was to finally exit the property. Once she was off the property, they no longer could legally touch her, or risk exposing the secret bio-lab&#39;s work to the public.</p>
