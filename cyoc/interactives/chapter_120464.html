<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You&#39;re relieved that you are still standing on two legs, and even more so when you note that you appear female.  Turning a bit and examining your body, it seems surprisingly normal, no weird limbs or tails sticking out anywhere.  In fact, as you finally move your gaze to your face, it looks like you are entirely human, much to your glee.  Granted, you don&#39;t look like your original self, but since it was possible you could end up as anything from a dragon to a dung beetle, the minor changes in appearance aren&#39;t too bad.<br />
<br />
While your skin has taken on a slightly more tanned hue, your body seems fairly well-proportioned and in-shape, with no bulky muscles but a wiry strength.  You&#39;re not overly curvy, but seem to have a comfortably athletic physique, probably in slightly better shape than you were originally.  Age-wise your body might be a bit older in appearance than you originally were, seeming slightly more mature than a teenager, and your face&#39;s reflection seems to confirm your suspicions.  While your face appears more mature, perhaps that of someone in their 20&#39;s, or maybe even in their 30&#39;s depending on the expression you wear, there is a sharp and youthful sparkle in your eyes, which now shine a deep bluish-green.  They contain an ageless beauty which makes it hard for you to determine your new form&#39;s age with accuracy.  However, definitely the most striking aspect of your new appearance is the wavy, deep-red hair which now frames your face and trails over your shoulders.  You feel a strange familiarity with your new appearance, and wonder if you knew someone back on Earth with similar facial features.  Quite satisfied with yourself and glad you ended up in a non-animal form, you turn to give Lawson a proud look to show off your accomplishment.<br />
<br />
Only to realize that Lawson is staring at you with an indescribable expression on his face.  You cannot decide if it is shock, fear, awe, or...anger?  Before you can even ask Lawson what&#39;s wrong, he lunges at you.  Grabbing you by your shoulders, his hands nearly pressing on your neck, he slams you against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you see that form?!&quot;  Lawson barks at you, his grip tightening and his eyes wild.  &quot;Who told you to change into that?!&quot;   Dumbfounded at his sudden attack, you do not even bother to resist or defend yourself until you feel pressure on your windpipe.  Gasping a bit, you reach up and grab his wrists, but Lawson&#39;s strength is almost to the point of madness.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?!&quot;  you spit out desperately, trying to catch your breath.  &quot;You&#39;re the one who told me to do this &#39;at rest&#39; business!&quot; You do not even think to change your form to escape, but simply feel your vision begin to darken at the edges.<br />
<br />
&quot;Liar!  No familiar&#39;s &#39;at rest&#39; form has ever been fully human, let alone one that looks like...her!&quot;  Lawson yells insensibly at you, glaring like a feral animal.  You feel yourself getting a bit lightheaded and your arms growing weak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...what the hell...you&#39;re talking about!&quot;  you manage to blurt out, and something seems to flicker in Lawson&#39;s gaze.  He stares furiously into your eyes for a few seconds before your pupils begin to roll back into your head.  This appears to bring some sanity back to Lawson, as he finally lets go.  You sink to the floor, coughing and panting for air.  Without a word, you hear Lawson stalk out the door and slam it behind him.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of greedily taking deep breaths, you finally come to your senses enough to realize how confused you are.  For all the training nightmares Lawson has put you through, he has never been personally violent with you.  In fact, quite the opposite.  All of his interactions with you have been gentle, almost caring.  And while his grumpiness seems to have no end, you can&#39;t recall ever seeing him lose his temper;  even when faced with insults to his teacher back when you two had gone to the village.  A bit pissed off, you haul yourself up off the floor, still nude, and head for the door to go find Lawson and demand an explanation.  However, when you reach for the doorknob, you hesitate.  <br />
<br />
Although you feel like you have been adjusting fairly well to this insane new reality, you suddenly become starkly aware of the fact that the only person you know in this entire world is Lawson, and although you are Linked to him, you have nowhere to go if he decides to get rid of you.  Your arm falls to your side, and you decide against leaving the room for now.  Shaken and a little scared, you pull on a shirt, flop into bed and huddle under the covers.  For the first time since you got here, you can rest as a completely normal human, but you are too worried to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
After a fitful night, filled with strange dreams you can&#39;t recall, you awaken to remember the events of the evening before.  Although you get out of bed and dress, you find yourself standing before the mirror staring at the strange person looking back at you.  You wonder whether you should change back into your original form before going down the stairs, which leads you to ponder whether you should even leave the room.  Lost in thought, you start as you hear the door open, only to see Lawson standing in the doorway.  He makes no move to enter, probably noting the glimmer of fear in your eyes.  However, instead of the furious expression of last night, he looks at you instead with what could pass for a sad or melancholic half-smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s something you need to see,&quot;  Lawson says softly, then turns to exit without looking back, leaving the door open.  You hesitate a moment, then run after him.  Lawson leads you around the second floor to another door, one which you had assumed to be another bedroom, but which you had never entered.  The door is slightly larger and more ornate than the bedroom you were in, and from the placement of the room, you could tell it is much larger.  Taking a key out of his pocket, Lawson unlocks the door, which slowly creaks open.  <br />
<br />
While the parts of the house you have seen to this point have been immaculately cleaned by Lawson, it is apparent no one has been into this room for a while.  Although there is no cobwebs or visible signs of dust, something about the stillness of the air makes you feel as though you are in a mausoleum.  All the window shutters are closed, so Lawson leads the way with a lighted candle with you following behind.  It is a drawing room, with a bedroom and sitting room beyond, the items and furniture within looking as though they had been frozen in time.  Lawson leads you to the sitting room, then pauses before a curtained wall.  Stepping to the side, he pulls on the drawstring, opening the curtain to reveal a large portrait, almost life-size.  Stepping back in front of the portrait, next to you, he lifts the candle to shine a light on the figure.<br />
<br />
You stare in amazement.  Looking back at you is the exact copy of the reflection you have been examining since last night.  In fact, were it not for the portrait wearing different clothes from you, you might have thought that rather than a painting, the curtain had concealed a mirror.  The only thing more astounding is that when you finally turn to request an explanation from Lawson, you see an incomprehensible expression on his face.  Although you are left speechless, he responds to your unasked question.<br />
<br />
