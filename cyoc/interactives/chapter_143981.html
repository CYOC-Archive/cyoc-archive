<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She hadn&#39;t meant to overhear anything. But passing by Jennifer and her friend Eli, Rachel accidentally overheard the one girl telling the other what she&#39;d made her brother do. Smiling at the thought of Dennis wearing girl&#39;s underwear, Rachel continued on her way, wondering if she should tell someone and let it spread from there or use the information as way to get revenge on the boy.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d never liked Dennis. Him or the idiot he was always hanging around. Mostly because Dennis called her names and made fun of her glasses, whilst, &quot;Billy,&quot; she reminded herself, usually stood around, repeating what Dennis said or laughing stupid. Spotting some girls from her girl scout troupe, she waved and started running over them, considering telling them what she&#39;d over heard, but, when she reached them, decided that, for the moment, she wanted to keep it to herself until she decided what to do. Reaching the other girls, she was instantly asked, &quot;You find someone to bring with to the meeting tonight,&quot; to which she quietly said, &quot;Not yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl who&#39;d asked her shrugged and told her, &quot;You aren&#39;t going to get your sponsor badge,&quot; and turning to the girl on her left she started talking about who she was bringing, her seven year old niece.<br />
<br />
A hurt feeling coming over her, Rachel wanted to take back what she&#39;d said. To say that, yes, she had found someone to bring with tonight who shared an interest in the girl scouts. Standing quietly, head hung, she instead listened as the girls all talked about who they had gotten and why. When the bell signalling the first class of the day rang, Rachel plodded into the building. By the time she&#39;d gotten to class and taken her seat, she was in a foul mood. Spotting Dennis and remembering what she&#39;d overheard, she wondered if it was true and how to prove it. Thinking as the teacher took attendance, an idea started forming.<br />
<br />
By the time the bell rang to announce school being out at one, her idea was as perfect as she thought it would be. Grabbing her stuff from her locker, plus a jacket she&#39;d forgotten some time ago and a backpack she&#39;d hadn&#39;t used in some time, having only brought it because she&#39;d needed an extra pack to carry something, she hurried down the hall. Making her way quickly past the other kids, barely listening as one of teachers told her, &quot;Stop running in the halls,&quot; Rachel scanned the sea of faces, looking for Dennis.<br />
<br />
Down one hall and towards the cafeteria, the crowd starting to thin out, she pushed on her classes and thought about going back. But then she spotted Dennis, slowly making his around a corner. Hurrying, glad he was alone, she turned the corner and thrilled it was empty, she called out, &quot;Hey, Dennis.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy turning to look at her, he made a sour face and stated, &quot;What do you want?&quot; as Rachel ran up to him.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to give anything away, resisting the urge to smile, she shrugged casually and explained, &quot;Nothing really,&quot; and as he was about to turn away, she quickly said, &quot;But, I did have a question. One I am sure only you can answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis, wanting only to go home and hope that Jenny was home yet so he could change, peered at the four-eyed girl. Thinking of telling her that he didn&#39;t have time for her, that he was meeting Billy at any moment, he never got a chance to say anything as Rachel took a deep breath and exclaimed, &quot;See. I accidentally overheard something. And I thought, who could help me figure it out. Then I thought you could. And so, well you see, I wanted to ask, if it was true that,&quot; and before Dennis could stop her, Rachel reached out and yanked down on his pants.<br />
<br />
As she pulled down, Rachel giggled and exclaimed, &quot;I see London. I see France. I see Dennis&#39; girly underpants,&quot; and giggling some more, she watched as the boy tried to pull on his pants, turning red in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;You shouldn&#39;t have done that,&quot; Dennis growled, thinking as he did that the only reason she had been able to was because his mom had bought him a pair of pants a size too big. Pulling his pants back up, he looked at her threateningly and said, &quot;If you tell anyone, I&#39;ll do more than simply make fun of your dorky glasses.&quot;<br />
<br />
To his surprise, Rachel shook her head and replied, &quot;Nope. If you don&#39;t do what I say, I&#39;ll not only tell everyone you wear girl&#39;s panties, but you also tuck your boy parts back,&quot; then added maliciously, &quot;And love doing it cause it make you feel pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flabbergasted, wanting to fight back, Dennis was about to tell her to shut it, when, to his horror, Rachel opened her mouth really wide, cupped her hands and started to say, &quot;Hey,&quot; but never got past the first syllable. Placing his hand over her mouth, Dennis snarled, &quot;Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with, all right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel, a pleased look on her face, nodded and made a motion for him to follow her. Not wanting to, Dennis knew he didn&#39;t have a choice and as the girl turned and headed back through the school, he trailed after, hoping that he could find some way to get away. When they came to the lost and found, Dennis groaned, but Rachel ignored him as she began sorting through the box that was now nearly overflowing. Selecting four items, she explained, &quot;Here&#39;s the deal. If you want me to keep quiet, you&#39;ll dress like a girl and come to my girl scout&#39;s meeting tonight and pretend you are interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t do that,&quot; Dennis whined. &quot;Everyone will know I&#39;m not a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile on her face, Rachel started to lead him down the hall but stopped after a couple steps. Pointing at the lost and found box, she told him to grab the coat and backpack she&#39;d accidentally left mixed in with the other stuff. Unsure what she planned to do with them, Dennis did so as he tried to think of a way out of the situation he was in. Grabbing the black pack that had pastel coloured stars printed on it and the white jacket with the pastel purple lining Rachel had been carrying, he started to follow the girl down the hall.<br />
<br />
When the reached the girl&#39;s bathroom, she explained, &quot;Nobody will know you&#39;re not a girl. Not if you do what I say,&quot; and indicating for him to follow, she started to enter the lavatory, but stopped and told him, &quot;It&#39;s either that, or tell everyone about how you like wearing girl&#39;s underwear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Desperate to get out of situation that he felt was getting out of control, Dennis pointed at the bathroom door and explained, &quot;I can&#39;t go in there,&quot; hoping Rachel would change her mind.<br />
<br />
To his dismay, she shrugged and answered, &quot;When you come back out, you&#39;ll be dressed like a girl. So, you shan&#39;t have worry about getting caught.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sinking sensation coming over him, Dennis grimaced and adjusted his backpack on his shoulder. Looking wildly up and down the hall, searching for anybody, but not seeing anyone, he peered at Rachel as she said, &quot;Maybe I should just start telling people. It might actually be better that way,&quot; and not wanting that, he hissed, &quot;Okay. Fine,&quot; and followed her in.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, Rachel told him to dump his pack on one the sinks and take one the stalls. Dennis, feeling like maybe he should run and that maybe he could deny what the ten-year-old girl was telling him, huffed in agitation and instead tossed his school bag into the nearest sink. Taking the closest stall, he closed the door and listened as Rachel said, &quot;Remove your pants, shirt, socks and shoes and pass them to me,&quot; and hating that it felt like he had no option, Dennis shrugged out of shoes and socks and kicked them under the door.<br />
<br />
Next, he removed her shirt, hesitated, then removed his jeans. Both garments following the first two items, he watched as Rachel scooped each item up. Feeling ridiculous standing in the girl&#39;s bathroom in nothing but a pair of panties, Dennis hugged himself and tried not to look down. When Rachel passed under the door a pair of pants, he quickly grabbed them, checked the tag, medium, and pulled on the black skinny jeans, hating as he did how they made him look like a girl from the waist down. Next, the girl passed him a shirt and unfolding it, Dennis grimaced at the design, a shamrock with the words Lucky and Pretty encircling the image, and, again, checking the tag, which had a capital M, he pulled on the short sleeve muscle shirt.<br />
<br />
A feeling that he looked as silly as he felt, he looked down at what he was wearing and watched as a pair of black hightop shoes with side zippers was thrust under the door. Not even paying attention to the tag that stated they were size 1 and a half, Dennis unzipped them and shoved his foot into the left shoe. Hoping it wouldn&#39;t fit, at first he thought it wouldn&#39;t, as it felt too tight. But, after shifting his foot, he managed to get the shoe on. Unaware of how he his body was changing from the waist down, Dennis zipped up the side of the shoe and pulled on the matching one. Taking a couple deep breathes, he reached out and opened the door.<br />
<br />
The moment he stepped out, Rachel squealed out, &quot;Oh, my. You look so adorable,&quot; and before Dennis could say or do anything, she dragged him over to the sink, where she forced him to look in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Unhappy with what he was wearing, thinking it made him look like a girl from everything from the neck down, he grumbled, &quot;I don&#39;t want to look adorable,&quot; as Rachel put a hat on his head.<br />
<br />
The instant she heard this, Rachel told him, &quot;Tough. This is the deal. You come to my girl scout meeting tonight. You pretend to be a girl, and maybe offer to join up as a Junior. And if you do, I shan&#39;t tell anyone about how you like wearing girl&#39;s clothing. Now. Grab your coat and backpack,&quot; and indicating the school bag and coat he&#39;d retrieved for her from the lost and found, she said, &quot;I think, to make sure you don&#39;t try and weasel out of it, you should come home and meet my mom,&quot; as he pulled on the jacket and picked up the backpack. And just as he did that, Rachel suddenly grabbed his hand and before he could say anything, led him out of the bathroom.</p>
