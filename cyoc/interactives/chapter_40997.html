<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris awaited Jake's response. Normally the idea of showering with another man (or male in this case) would not be pleasant. With Jake however, it felt different.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd love to,&quot; Jake said. &quot;I admit that I'd never considered doing <br />
this with another guy. But you -- you're different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris took a few careful steps toward Jake. Despite the blood rushing to his cheeks and the reaction of his manhood, Chris forged on. <br />
<br />
It felt okay to be excited like this with Jake (even if Jake was male).<br />
<br />
However, as Chris put his arms around Jake. Jake's fur and body heat were wonderful. Even Jake's scent was pleasant.<br />
<br />
A pang of worry and doubt tore through Chris just as he started to lose himself.<br />
<br />
He half expected someone to call, ring the doorbell or to run into the bathroom. Failing that, he expected to trip or bang his head on something and to destroy the mood.<br />
<br />
If none of that happened, worry that this wasen't right echoed in Chris' mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Jake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to enjoy this,&quot; Chris said. &quot;More then anything, I want to let go and enjoy this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can't you?&quot; Jake asked.<br />
<br />
Chris let go of Jake and took two steps back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like -- like there's someone in my mind saying no over and over. I'm not hearing voices per say. It's just -- it's hard to explain,&quot; Chris said with a sigh as he sat down on the edge of the tub.<br />
<br />
Jake approached Chris and knelt down in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand this is all sudden. We can slow down if you need time to accept this,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not that,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
Chris hung his head, feeling content to look at his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you find me attractive?&quot; Jake asked.<br />
<br />
Chris looked at Jake but only for a few seconds before resuming looking at Chris' feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, look at me,&quot; Jake said, his tone calm and soothing.<br />
<br />
Chris looked at Jake, this time to stay.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do find you attractive,&quot; Chris said. &quot;There's things I want to try with you, things that...&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris felt even more blood rush to his cheeks as his manhood reacted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, why does it always have to announce itself like that?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
Jake smirked. &quot;You know how it is. Subtlety doesn't figure into the equation when it comes to these things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to try some things with you but I'm afraid of what it will mean for me,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand and feel the same way,&quot; Jake said. &quot;A part of me wishes you were a girl, so I could love you in the way nature intended but I want you to be you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I kinda feel the same about you,&quot; Chris said. &quot;But, who am I kidding? I've never had a girlfriend. I don't think I could do that with a girl. It's not that I don't want to, I'm just too nervous to try it. But with you, I don't feel that, at least not in the same way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's wrong then?&quot; Jake asked. &quot;If it's the deal with us both being guys, I won't judge you for loving me. It's what inside that counts. If what's outside for both of us is male then so be it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris sighed. &quot;I keep hearing other people saying I'm a deviant or a pervert or something else. It's like they're floating around me, yelling at me and repeatedly saying no.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris held out his hands, both were shaking. Jake grabbed hold of Chris' hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't let others control your life,&quot; Jake said. &quot;Those voices -- you need to tell them to leave. To be honest, you need to tell them to get the heck away from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris's eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, it's just, I think you should listen to your conscience, not theirs. This isn't about what they want, it's about what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you're right,&quot; Chris said. &quot;But it's also about what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This life, it's your life to live, not theirs,&quot; Jake said. &quot;If it's family then you need to be your own person, not who you think they want you to be. If it's friends then they're not really your friends if they're not letting you be you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe they're just worried that bad things will happen if I do something like this,&quot; Chris said. &quot;Sort of wanting the best for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake patted Chris on the back before Jake stood up, walked into the shower behind Chris, knelt down and massaged Chris' shoulders. Chris started to relax almost immediately under a sensation that was a combination of petting and a massage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand that,&quot; Jake said. &quot;It's only natural for friends and family to want what's best for the people that care about. But, we have to remember that their experience and desires influence those feelings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you're right,&quot; Chris said. &quot;To be honest, I feel happy so far. It's like, I've filled a part of me that I never knew was missing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake smiled. &quot;Me too. Now, it seems we both urges when it come to each other. I think that as long as we're responsible and we keep it in private that it will be all right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that will be all right. By the way, this feels wonderful,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
The voices of doubt in Chris' mind were starting to go silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;The world isn't going to end if we enjoy each others company and even each others bodies,&quot; Jake said. &quot;Our compatibility broke the curse. I want to be with you Chris.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris looked up at Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I want to be with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what, why don't we get some breakfast first? Then we can discuss it,&quot; Jake said. &quot;If you're wondering, just because we're otters doesn't mean we have to eat fish and stuff like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris chuckled. &quot;How about bacon and eggs with some coffee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Jake said. &quot;I haven't cooked anything in a while. May I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
