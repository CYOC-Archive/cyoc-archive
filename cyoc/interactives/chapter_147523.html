<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After that orgasm, it seemed like everything was soft, hazy. You&#39;re already hanging out in the air, as warmth travels down your body and evacuates the hole in your &#39;head&#39;. What happened just a moment ago? You strain your...thoughts? What did you do right before this? And even as you seem to think this, you are already tensing against the stallion&#39;s belly as he stands there, thumping you against himself in masturbation. Each time you thump, things go blank, then you&#39;re swinging again, and you wonder, what did you do right before this? The stallion tenses you up, feeling musky pre dribble out of your hole, and thump. <br />
<br />
What were you just...thump...were you just doi...thump...what were you...thump...what were you just doing...thump...what were...thump.<br />
<br />
An existence of just pissing, spraying the stallion&#39;s seed, and jiggling in his sweaty sheath starts to all blur together. That&#39;s it. Piss. Ejaculate. Wait. Piss. Ejaculate. Piss. Piss. It seems there is nothing else in the world. <br />
<br />
At first, you were aware of each time it happened. You would feel yourself drop out into the air, a rush of hormones as your balls tense, and the passing of his fluid. Sometimes it would relieve itself in over the ground and you would have no sense of anything but the burning coursing through you. Other times the stallion would tense you against his steamy belly, blacking out with each thud of your cock head against him, until you tensed and his slick pre dribbled from your former lips. Sometimes the stallion would have a mate, or would thrust uou into the colder confines of a semen collection dummy. <br />
<br />
But the cycle and redundancy all started to run together. How many times has this happened? There was no sense of time, no other experiences. There didn&#39;t seem to be much of a reason to reflect upon the pissing, tensing and spraying. There wasn&#39;t much of a reason to think about there being nothing much to thinking about. Suddenly, you realize you are just now thinking about how you weren&#39;t thinking. Suddenly, you are remembering all the blur of being a horse cock running together. It took you until this moment to realize you are thinking, and now you feel sick. Were you thinking this whole time?<br />
<br />
Maybe you had transformed only yesterday? Maybe it&#39;s been years? You aren&#39;t even sure as there are just moments of action where the stallion uses you for your basic functions, and moments of sweaty, half-awake jiggling in the warm sheath between the stallion&#39;s legs, bumping occasionally against his inner thighs. You found yourself starting to becoming completely submerged in the experiences. There was nothing to think about them. They just happened in your ever sensuous pulsing and heat. Each time you blew the stallion&#39;s load, your head would inflate like the glands it was and squeeze out all thoughts.<br />
<br />
There was a fear in you. You weren&#39;t even sure you were you anymore. You couldn&#39;t even be sure that was a thought. Your flesh seemed to already know what to do, mundane biology engaging the horse&#39;s arousal or needs, tensing, hardening, softening. Before you were sure that you were making it happen, but were you? It felt like your action, but now, the action is you, already dropping and tensing before you&#39;ve realized it, like your thoughts have gotten out of synch and are clocking down slower your body. Each moment is like remembering the previous moment before you can think about the next. There isn&#39;t enough brainpower to do both at the same time.<br />
<br />
Terror grows in you as you think you realize what is happening to you. It was sealed the moment you misspoke and called yourself a horse&#39;s cock. It was happening already, imperceptibly. It&#39;s hard to even think about it, as you stumble over the idea. You just can&#39;t remember enough words to make it meaningful.<br />
<br />
But in you, the terror is growing. The horse needs to spray into a mare. The horse needs to survive, to reproduce. No. You need...to...? It&#39;s all running together. You need...help...to be shoved inside the winking mare...to...<br />
<br />
And you feel yourself already tensing, your face(?) slamming against the hot furry muscles as the stallion seeks his mark. The stallion is slamming you in and out, tense as as a steel rod, blood furiously pumping under your flesh, the mare&#39;s inner walls squeezing you rhythmically, it&#39;s so much worse than before, so much more, so, just cock flesh sliding in and out, flames of sex beyond comprehension, your face bumping against her cavity, covered in slick fluids. You can feel it building in you, an unstoppable wave, building up at the base of the sheath, holding it back just makes you tense and convulse, needing to erupt, it is going to happen, balls pulling up against the inside of the sheath...<br />
<br />
In the sea of need, you are fighting, trying to grasp any thought. And in desperation, you hear your inner voice say, &quot;I can&#39;t think.&quot; <br />
<br />
It&#39;s over in a few seconds. The stallion shoves himself in deep, spraying out its seed, the cock head flaring into engorged glands to keep its sperm inside the mare. Stallion jizz jets out with each convulsion It&#39;s only a half-experienced, all-consuming void of intensity, an agony of spreading, filling, an overwhelming moment of reproductive need, spraying all over one&#39;s own &quot;head&quot;, reaching a peak of unbearable, mindless...<br />
<br />
The stallion waits for a few moments before pulling out. It&#39;s cock slips out, pulling out a stringy trail of cum. The horse cock flops around in the air, nothing but a horse cock. After all, only horses have brains. Horse cocks don&#39;t need to think.</p>
