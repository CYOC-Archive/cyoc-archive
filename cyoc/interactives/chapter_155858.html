<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Catherine sat around for awhile thinking about anything she could do. Her fire didn&#39;t seem to come close to melting her containment, she didn&#39;t dare do anything to the top where the boiling water was... This was a super power right? That should mean the fire maybe able to be increased! But how?<br />
<br />
Catherine started clenching all of her muscles trying to will something to happen... As expected this didn&#39;t really do much, but at least her fire obscured her intentions from the Collector who only took occasional glances. The collector knew that animals like those either blew themselves out to eat or somehow just got their energy from the fire burning around them. So as long as the ventilation worked the fire beast he snagged should be fine. Knowing this the Collector went to watching some netflix on his TV. <br />
Catherine released her muscles figuring that basically did nothing... or maybe it did and she just couldn&#39;t tell there was even more fire inside this inferno. Catherine looked at herself to see if there was a symbol or opening where the fire was pouring out of, but no there wasn&#39;t. It was just her with her thin waist, E-cup breasts, Wide hips... Thinking about it her sexy body came with the fire didn&#39;t it? Maybe the fire was as hot as she was? Catherine chuckled in her head thinking &quot;That wouldn&#39;t matter.&quot; she outstretched her hands in front of her imagining her breasts were actually a cup size larger. &quot;Yeah like that would actually do anything right?&quot; except she started to feel a tightness in her chest as it felt like her skin was being drawn even tighter. Her chest had surged larger and the fire around her seemed to be burning hotter... &quot;Holy shit I can control my body?!? So could I return to normal if I?&quot; Her F-cups started retreating into her chest as the flames around her seemed to start to die down and... &quot;Wait... I&#39;m naked and that&#39;s a villain... Let&#39;s stay cloaked in fire.&quot; and Catherine let her breasts surge larger. &quot;If anything... Let&#39;s get hotter.&quot; Catherine started going for the amazonian version of sexiness. Her breasts were getting larger, but proportionally the same as she surged towards 7 feet tall. Her once flat but soft stomach gaining firm muscle as she started getting a six pack. Large assets and a toned form made her even sexier from before and all around her the fire was burning a bright blue. The heat resistant glass in front of her didn&#39;t stand a chance as she just walked through it allowing her fire to engulf the area. <br />
The collector hearing the sizzling of the glass quickly scampered away and entered his bunker. <br />
<br />
The Collector thought to himself &quot;Alright... wasn&#39;t expecting something that hot... May not be able to see the animal next time but a pure tungsten containment cage should work... Just have to write off everything upstairs right now as being dead... great all the sensors are melted.&quot; <br />
<br />
Back in New York at the protector&#39;s building their Magical Girl Squad Mother Oracle was doing her normal patrol of the globe. Glancing around just checking to make sure nothing too bad was going on throughout the world with her ability, but paying more attention on her Magical Girl Squad. They were so adorable and were doing so much good it would be so sad if they were ever to die so soon... Wait there was a giant fiery explosion on that island! What&#39;s going on there?!? What is that giant fireball... Oh... <br />
In the room with Oracle Dr. Doctor asked &quot;Are you blushing Oracle? Didn&#39;t think you were a peeping tom.&quot; <br />
Oracle said &quot;That&#39;s not it. There&#39;s a giant flaming naked Amazonian on an island at coordinates ... who just blew up a private building!&quot;<br />
Dr. Doctor said &quot;Sounds like some Hot Stuff. Let&#39;s send a team to neutraliz-&quot; <br />
Oracle said &quot;Not Neutralize!.. Actually the Amazonian seems to be shrinking and... is now a chubby naked 13 year old girl... Send a female transporter and a towel and clothes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Shortly after Catherine sorted everything out and was able to return to her home with some explanation to her family and the city. The Collector on the other hand was able to evade the Protector&#39;s scan of the area and escaped to a different one of his hideouts. Looking at the news he knew that he had accidentally mistaken Catherine as a fire beast... Then again he didn&#39;t care. She had destroyed a lot of his property, and he was going to find a way to contain her. Not to mention all the endangered super animals she killed in the explosion! Did she seriously not value those specimens at all?!?<br />
<br />
Catherine herself back at home was in the shower in an attempt to experiment. The media didn&#39;t show off her identity, the protectors had been making sure she had control of her abilities, and now seemed like a fair time to experiment. Her body started to slim a bit, her chest push out just a tiny bit, and the heat around her was starting to steam the water in the shower. She sighed wishing she could be sexy without the fire. Maybe she&#39;d figure out how to do that some day.</p>
