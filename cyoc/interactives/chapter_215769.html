<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Benjamin returned to his estate with Asher in hand and sat in his room in stunned silence, his mind trying to process what Asher had just confessed to him. He had never heard of such a thing before - Not being a badger originally? Him ever being a human? It sounded like something from a Roll Doll book his mum used to read to him in cubhood, not something that could actually happen in real life. And yet, Asher&#39;s words carried a weight of truth that Benjamin couldn&#39;t ignore.<br />
<br />
As he sat there, trying to make sense of it all, he tried to jog his memory to search for anything from his human past, but it was rather fuzzy at best. Benjamin then looked back to what happened yesterday. He could remember having that cuppa with Asher and being called <b>“Benji”</b> by him, which was to the badger an improper name for someone like him now, but it was the name he went by as a human, and it had further unlocked his remaining human memories. Benjamin then remembered his home not being the extravagant estate he was in now, but just another suburban American home. Then, he remembered Asher and Felix at his doorstep when he first met them yesterday, helping them move in next door. He wasn’t actually a Brit, nor were he and Asher ever boyfriends before then. How could Asher, his new neighbor, do something like this to him and his family? Why were he and Felix doing all these changes to his community and those who called it home? <br />
<br />
Benjamin would then look over to Asher, he then felt a twinge of sympathy for the other European Badger. He could see the look etched on Asher&#39;s face, his whiskers drooping as were his ears, and he knew that whatever had driven him to do this must have been powerful indeed. The memories as Benjamin began to re-strengthen for the badger, living in a flat in a vibrant London neighbourhood, meeting Asher on a bench waiting for a double-decker bus to arrive to take them to boarding school, and during their time there, becoming more than friends, but boyfriends, something “Benji” could’ve never imagined for himself. Living an old-fashioned, posh English lifestyle that he had realized was created in the fellow European Badger’s image was something Benjamin had grown to prefer versus a lower-middle class American lifestyle that he had been previously living.<br />
<br />
For a few moments, they sat in silence in Benjamin&#39;s bedroom, neither of them knowing quite what to say,  as Benjamin’s memories collided with each other as his ears twitched, with Asher on the other side of the room watching nervously. Eventually, Benjamin spoke up, his voice quiet but firm. &quot;Asher, what implored you to do all of this?&quot; <br />
<br />
Asher sighed, his eyes downcast. &quot;You see, Benjamin, I was lonely just like you. I was...homesick, lost...&quot; he said nervously.<br />
<br />
Benjamin shook his head, a claw over his dark lips. &quot;I don&#39;t understand. Why did you feel like you had to change me? Why couldn&#39;t you just accept me for who I was before?&quot; <br />
<br />
Asher sighed, his shoulders slumping, feeling his heart sink. &quot;I don&#39;t know, Benjamin. I think...I think I was scared. Scared that you would leave me behind, scared that I wouldn&#39;t be able to keep up with you, scared you wouldn&#39;t accept me. And… And I thought that if I made you into a right and proper British badger like me, then we could be together forever. I- I gave you such an amazing life for you and your family because I knew there was good in your heart and you deserved it. I wanted to say thanks, in my own, misguided way.” he said as tears ran down the black stripes on his face, grabbing a handkerchief to wipe the tears off his face. “I know it sounds like bollocks, but that&#39;s how I felt. If you want me to change you back, I completely understand and I am so terribly sorry for doing this to you. I will try my best to make that happen if you so wish&quot;<br />
<br />
Benjamin listened to Asher&#39;s words, feeling a sense of compassion for Asher. He knew what it was like to feel scared and alone, to want to hold onto something so tightly that you&#39;d do anything to keep it. Benjamin then asked himself. Would he really want to give up the right and <i>proper</i>, posh life that Asher had given him to go back to being Benji?  Benjamin found that he enjoyed the feeling of his fur against his skin. He enjoyed spending time with Asher and living the posh lifestyle he had built for him. Benjamin felt as if he was right and <i>proper </i> this way rather than in his previous human form. As he thought back on his life as a human, which he could hardly remember by now, Benjamin realized that he had never felt truly happy or fulfilled. He had always felt like something was missing like there was a void inside him that he could never quite fill. But now, as a badger, he felt right and <i>proper</i>. He knew that he would never go back to his old life, even if he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still love you, darling,&quot; he said finally, placing a hand on Asher’s shoulder, and in for a hug. “You made me a right and proper gentleman.” their hearts melted as they embraced each other.<br />
<br />
Asher looked up at Benjamin, tears glistening in his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m glad you like it the way I do.” he whispered as he nuzzled Benjamin. “My Honey Badger, forever and always.” <br />
<br />
Despite his initial shock, Benjamin found himself forgiving Asher for what he had done. He realized that Asher had meant no harm and had simply wanted to share his own way of life with Benjamin. And in the end, Benjamin was grateful for the transformation that had opened up a whole new world to him. He had given him a new life, a life that was more exciting and fulfilling than his old one could ever have been, even if it was all just made up from Asher’s imagination.<br />
<br />
Benjamin would then ask a question out of curiosity. “How do you change people, Asher? Now that you’ve told me about what you did, I want to know your secret.” He says with a mischievous smile.<br />
<br />
Asher blushed under his fur. “Now that you ask Benjamin, I’ll let you in on the secret of us anthros.” He dives into an explanation,<br />
<br />
“Each of us has our own way of molding people into our own. I, for one, use flattery to perform my changes. For everyone, however, it takes a lot of focus.” Asher explains “Many, as you have seen with me and my uncle like to follow a certain theme when we bend the fabrics of reality.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m becoming more curious Asher, what led you to choose a <i>proper</i>, upper-class, English life to build?” Benjamin asked.<br />
<br />
“I am a European Badger, and knowing this corner of the world spoke English, albeit an improper form, making it a perfect slice of England was the easiest I can work with without straining myself too hard. It helped that I was already in the United Kingdom, to begin with, and I was able to take a lot of influences from my time there. My parents are still living there doing changes across the pond. I read a lot of books on posh life in Jolly old England, which were older, but I made do with them as I thought they would add some charm to what I was building.” Asher further explained.<br />
<br />
“How do you choose what to change people into?&quot; asks Benjamin once more.<br />
<br />
“Most anthros like me choose species that correspond with what they’re trying to go with, so mostly those found on the British Isles as well as those that are culturally significant over there in my case. Once I have them flattered, that&#39;s when they are vulnerable and I can pick a species to change them into based on what I feel is proper for them. People can also change indirectly as a result of transformations, as what happened to your sisters last night. Genetics also plays a role in changes as well which was something I learned myself after changing your parents. Other anthros like Felix are actually able to change people’s age and sex on top of their species, though this adds much more strain to someone, especially when you&#39;re doing changes as quickly as he has. If I was having trouble earlier doing what I was in the pub today, just imagine what the old fellow is gonna be hit with.” Asher finished his statement with a sense of concern for the older badger.<br />
<br />
“Am I able to change people and bend reality as an anthro myself, or can I not because I was previously human?” the Badger asks<br />
<br />
“The neat part is that you actually did help me change someone. Remember when we met Lyon on our stroll earlier today?” Asher noted.<br />
<br />
“Wow, I doubted I had any ability to do changes given my human past. I hardly noticed that he changed myself.” Benjamin chuckled, “I’d be glad to help take the load of making changes going forward if you so wish?” Benjamin offered.<br />
<br />
“I’d love to have you by my side, we could get an upper edge on Felix in the process. Divide and conquer, as they say.” Asher said with a grin…</p>
