<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mitchell, Hank, Sam and the rest of the boys on the football team exchanged a series of glances as the <br />
spotlight once again blinked into existence above them. They had watched, stupefied, as their friend and <br />
teammate had transformed into a busty cowgirl. Literally. Dan's girlfriend, Beth, had her head buried in her <br />
hands. No doubt she was feeling humiliated, terrified, and maybe even a little bit responsible for what had <br />
happened to her boyfriend, since the witch Kylie claimed to be inspired by her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do, man?&quot; Hank whispered to his fellow running back, Mitchell Harris. Though the two were <br />
unrelated, they could easily pass as brothers. Both had lean, muscular legs, a slightly stocky build, and <br />
wild, moppish brown hair on their equally freckled heads. Hank's eyes were a muddy brown while Mitch had <br />
watery blue eyes.<br />
<br />
Mitchell shook his head. &quot;I don't know. I don't feel anything. Do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Not yet anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam, one of the team's big linebackers, joined in. &quot;It's comin',&quot; he said in his deep voice. His eyes were so <br />
wide they almost seemed to glow compared to his dark skin and short black hair. He was a big guy, with an <br />
impressive gut, large arms, and a tendency to shuffle when he walked down the halls.<br />
<br />
Kylie interrupted their little pow-wow. &quot;Oh boys,&quot; she cooed. &quot;Smell that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Though each member of the football team knew they shouldn't, knew something bad would probably happen if they <br />
did, each and everyone inhaled through their nose, searching for some kind of smell. It was like telling <br />
someone not to look at something; it was almost a given that they would at least catch a glimpse of the <br />
forbidden object before turning away or closing their eyes. So it was that over a dozen guys all sniffed the <br />
air at the same time and all of them caught the scent of something, well... amazing!<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah,&quot; murmured Sam. &quot;What is that? Smells fan-fucking-tastic!&quot; He inhaled again and again, deeper each time, <br />
trying to get as much of the wonderful smell as he could. His nostrils flared wide as he huffed.<br />
<br />
Inhaling just as deeply, Mitchell looked around for the source of it. &quot;Yeah, man,&quot; he agreed. He snorted <br />
slightly, trying to sniff more of the smell. It was almost cloyingly sweet, with a spicy undertone. The <br />
running back just wanted to bury his face in it and inhale until he exploded.<br />
<br />
Hank shifted restlessly as he snorted the air, his nostrils huge and wide. In fact, they seemed to stretch <br />
wider still as he scented the air, so large that his nose resembled more of a snout. As he snorted and looked <br />
around for the source of the wonderful smell, his face began to push outward into a small muzzle, joining his <br />
nose and mouth together into a more bovine appearance. &quot;Smells so fucking goooooood,&quot; he groaned and felt his <br />
cock stir in his pants. He, like Tom, had come in his jersey and gym shorts. The stretchy fabric started <br />
tenting outward as his member rapidly hardened.<br />
<br />
The rest of the team were sporting similar boners in their respective costumes, and many of them had huge <br />
nostrils and the start of a bovine muzzle as their faces pushed outward. Sam stroked himself through the <br />
bandages he had used in his mummy costume, snorting and huffing loudly. His eyes found Dan up on the stage, <br />
now openly fingering her wet pussy under her big pink udder. Something clicked in his mind and he realized <br />
that she was the source of the wonderful smell. The cowgirl was in heat, and he was going to be the one to <br />
mount her.<br />
<br />
Sam pushed some of his changing teammates away from them as two dark horns started pushing out of his temple. <br />
His pushes turned to shoves as they jostled him back, their own growing horns curving from their heads into <br />
dull points above them. Already a big guy, Sam felt himself swell even further as his arms and chest gained <br />
more muscle. A dark shape wiggled under his bandages before finally popping free. It was a black bull's tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cooooooow,&quot; Hank mooed, scenting Dan on stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine!&quot; Sam bellowed. He snorted, puffing up his chest and lowering his horns. His floppy, pointed ears <br />
twitched in agitation as he made the challenge to the rival bull man for his mate.<br />
<br />
As Hank swelled with muscle, he too snorted and pawed at the ground with one foot. His sneaker flopped about <br />
before finally falling off, revealing a foot swiftly changing into a hoof. They squared off against each other <br />
for a moment, then charged. Their bodies slammed into each other, their erect cocks bobbing in their pants as <br />
their horns clacked against each other. Around them, other members of the team were doing the same as they <br />
each grew horns, bulked up with muscle, and underwent other changes to make them horny bull men just wanting <br />
to mate with the cowgirl on stage.<br />
<br />
Mitchell was the only one not left to fight an opponent. Instead, he was shoving people out of the way as he <br />
charged toward the stage. His cock was painfully hard, tenting his toga obscenely. His horns were a dull white <br />
and a shiny silver ring had grown in his nose as it pushed into a muzzle. He was almost three times bigger <br />
than a few minutes ago, his muscles bulging as he pushed student after student out of his way. Short brown fur <br />
began to sprout across his body, matching his hair, as he clumsily climbed onto the stage with his new hooves.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOOOOOO!&quot; he bellowed as he approached Dan. She mooed in return, her cheeks flushed with need. Slowly, unable <br />
to take it anymore, she turned around and bent over. Her tail lifted, revealing the puffy pussy lips, red with <br />
heat and lust, to her soon-to-be mate.<br />
<br />
Mitch grabbed the material of his toga and ripped it away, ripping off his boxers in the process. His thick, <br />
erect bull cock sprang up and slapped him in the belly. It was dripping with precum that splattered onto his <br />
furry chest and sheath, some of it dripping thickly onto the floor. He was about to grab the cowgirl and <br />
thrust into her when another bellow rang out through the room.</p>
