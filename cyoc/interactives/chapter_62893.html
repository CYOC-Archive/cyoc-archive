<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan and his dad waited to see how Doug and Zack would respond. <br />
&quot;Why on Earth would we want to help you, Mr Miller&quot;one of the boys said and then slapped Mr. miller's nose. &quot;Ow!&quot;, Dan's dad cried. The other <br />
boy bent over and pushed Dan's face up from under the the chin so that their eyes met; &quot;and look at you, Dan, not so cool now are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good job Kat&quot;, the boys exclaimed. &quot;Why thank you&quot; she answered. She then handed Doug and Zack the leashes and waved good bye. Have fun <br />
boys she said as she was leaving. And by the way, if they misbehave let me know and we'll have them neutered.<br />
<br />
Dan the tried to be nice &quot;look guys I.m really sorry i was mean to you. Will you please help us&quot;. &quot;Yes boys&quot;, Dan's father added, &quot;if you help us I <br />
promise to give you both a raise&quot; But Doug and Zack wanted to have some fun with their former boss and classmate who were now essentially <br />
their dogs. Well they were people, looked and talked like people, but they were stuck having the status of dogs and the boys wanted to make <br />
the most of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is so amazing&quot;, Doug thought out loud as he circled Dan walking behind the handsome teen on all fours to check out his fine bubble butt, <br />
&quot;I always wanted to see you naked and look at you now on all fours at my feet&quot;. Dan felt sick as Doug started petting his ass. The spell was <br />
prevent g him fro jumping up or using his hands to push Doug away. &quot;Get your faggy hands off me&quot;, Dan cried. &quot;Yes leave him alone this <br />
instant!&quot; Mr Miller ordered. <br />
<br />
Zack and Doug were not happy by this reaction. They turned their attention to Dan's relatively youngish Dad. It was definitely weird having a <br />
grown man totally at their mercy, especially a hunky one who was their asshole boss the day before. They wanted to demonstrate who was now <br />
to be the ones giving orders. They told Mr Miller to put his hands up in a begging position and crouch on his hunches.  They were eager to get <br />
a good look at his dick. He refused of course but the they started waking his nose with a rolled up newspaper and told him it would get a lot <br />
worse if they both didn't obey. Finally tuning red with shame, Mr Miller raised his hands in a dog begging style and stood on his haunches. <br />
&quot;Naked in the middle of the street, leashed like a dog&quot; he thought; &quot;Could it get any worse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Look at your big dick and low hanging balls&quot;, Zack  noted. &quot;He has a pretty hairy chest and look at that trail of hair going down to his <br />
bushy pubes. Hey your pretty in shape for an old guy, do you work out?&quot;. He started petting Mr Millers head the way you do to a good doggy. <br />
But your so hairy down there, why don't you trim.  Mr Miller was embarrassed enough with them seeing him like this and he definitely didn't <br />
want to start talking about his personal hygiene habits with his teenaged scut workers.  He also didn't like being called old since he was actually <br />
quite a young Dad and many people thought he was quite handsome. He looked over at Dan who was looking away, evidently not wanting to <br />
witness his fathers's total debasement. &quot;Dan don't you think your Dad should trim his pubes? Do you think you will be a hairy as him one <br />
day?&quot;,&quot;Your definitely not now.&quot;Doug added as he pulled apart Dan's ass cheeks. Dan was still hiding his face and didn't answer.  He felt the <br />
sun on his asshole for the first time in his life and he hated that this pathetic sissy boy was staring right at it.<br />
<br />
Mr Miller was startled when Zack hit on the head again with the newspaper. &quot;Hey, we asked you a question!&quot; &quot;Ah, I guess, well I play sports and <br />
stay fit&quot;, he managed to stammer looking up at his young tormentors. &quot;Good boy&quot; the teens said and patted Mr Millers head again, &quot;now shake <br />
your hips so that your big dick swings back and forth&quot;. &quot;What?&quot; the adult on the ground asked. Again he was hit on the head with a news <br />
paper. &quot;Your heard us! now start swinging your dick&quot;. &quot;Boys that is not appropriate&quot;, Mr Miller tried sounding authoritative but he was cut off <br />
when he was smacked again on the face with the rolled newspaper. Zack grabbed Mr. Miller's collar and pulled it so Mr. Miller's face was close <br />
to Zack's and the collared man was almost choking' &quot;you better start understanding that you are not our boss now, you are our dog! Now I'm <br />
about to shove this newspaper up your ass! Or maybe I will shove it up Danny the dog boy's ass in a second if you don't start being a good <br />
little doggy&quot;. &quot;Boy's please, its not nice to humiliate others like this.&quot;, he tried reasoning.  &quot;Yeah come on guys&quot; Dan joined in, &quot;Stop being such <br />
fags&quot;. He immediately could tell by the look on his new master's faces that he definitely just said the wrong thing.<br />
<br />
They were then interrupted by a lady with a little boy walking by. Mr Miller looked up in horror and fell back to all fours, he recognized that the <br />
lady was his neighbour and prayed she wouldn't recognize him.  Both him and Dan tried to cover their genitals as best they could.  She looked <br />
at the two naked men on leashes on all fours and seemed confused for an instant but then it cleared. Oh what nice dogs you boys have she <br />
said and patted them both on the head. The little boy suddenly ran behind the two naked men and started spanking their asses making <br />
everyone laugh. Except of course Dan and his Dad who were trying to escape the spanking but Zack and Doug were holding the leashes tight. <br />
The two naked men yelped with every spank. &quot;Look how their weewees bounce when I hit them&quot;, the boy exclaimed with delight. &quot;How could a <br />
little boy hit so hard?&quot; Dan wondered. The lady apologized and scolded her kid for abusing the nice doggies. The kid tried to tell his Mom that <br />
they were actually the mean men living next door, but she didn't listen and then led her son away. You can play with the doggies later she said.<br />
<br />
After they left Zack said &quot;Now, where were we? Hey maybe we should take them to school for show and tell? I bet lots of kids there will <br />
recognize them and want to have some fun&quot;. &quot;NO, lets take them to Mr. Miller's work. I bet some of the women Mr. Miller has been abusing <br />
would love to see him like this&quot; Doug suggested. &quot;I want to see how big their dick's are when they're hard&quot; Zack added.</p>
