<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Odd taste, but nice.”  You hear Arianna say more to herself than you as she sets down her glass, a shade under half of it drunk.  “Aren’t you going to have yours?”  <br />
<br />
Looking at it again, you finally decide that despite its unusual colour, it should be safe to drink at the very least, and take a first sip.  The taste is weird, but it seems smooth enough as it runs down your throat, setting it down again once about half the wine was in you.  <br />
<br />
“Yeah, they are odd, these drinks.”  You half-mumble to Arianna, even as you register the fact that her eyes aren’t the brown you know them to be as she looks at the menu, the light playing tricks maybe?  <br />
<br />
Whatever the reason, a quarter-hour passes before Mandy returns and even as you’ve made your choice, you’re trying to suppress an annoying itching that’s spreading from your rear.  <br />
<br />
“So what would you two like?”  She asks, rather more pleased with you than before you think.  <br />
<br />
“Uhh, the Rrabbit.  Rarrre.”  You manage to speak out softly as you give Mandy yourr menu, still distracted by the itching.  <br />
<br />
“Lamb.  Same.”  Arianna says as she hands her menu over, her hair jet black instead of brown and, was it spreading down?  <br />
<br />
Once Mandy had left for the kitchen, you make a quick check to see if anyone’s watching before sliding a hand to between your butt-cheeks to try and scratch away the itch from there.  Without really noticing, your nails were sharp enough to cut through the material and you thought you felt ‘something’ sliding out.  <br />
<br />
“Is it…getting…hot in…herrre?”  You hear Arianna moan, turning your focus to her again even as new discomforts formed.  <br />
<br />
And see just how dark her face looked now.  No, not dark, covered in black hairs so thick you couldn’t see the skin beneath it, which really contrasted with her stark green eyes.  The same thick hairs across her hands which tugged and pulled at her pink-white blouse, a few buttons torn off to reveal more black down her chest.  <br />
<br />
Finally managing to take your eyes off her for a moment, a scan around reveals the young couple looking very green now, their clothes seeming to you to be a little baggy around them, and only he’d finished his drink.  The older couple were harder to make out, her back was turned to you blocking the other, but you could see how puffed out her suit and skirt were, long hairs down her legs and head where rounded ears were perched.  <br />
<br />
Before you can see the single student a grunting noise from Arianna spins you back around to see that she’s ripped open her blouse and clawed her bra free, and is now busy kicking her tightened jeans off.  Black hair covered breasts bouncing and jiggling as the denim and panties fly away, her feet still tightly covered for now.  <br />
<br />
“Ahh, that’sh betterrrr…”  She purred through teeth had had lengthened and sharpened while she let her blouse slide free.  <br />
<br />
Just in time for Mandy to return with your chosen meals setting the (surprisingly) large plates in front of you and Arianna and looking rather pleased with you two.  <br />
<br />
“And please, do try to finish you Wine.”  Mandy states happily just before leaving.  <br />
<br />
Words unheard by Arianna seemingly as she dug in to her slabs of juicy meat hard.  Chunks torn off by her fangs while something long behind her, the same colour as she was now moved about.  <br />
<br />
As for yourself.  As much as you wanted to start right away, something kept coming to mind.  You couldn’t figure it out but something felt off, very off.  The way you felt cooked underneath your shirt not helping until frustration made you claw at it, tearing the strips of fabric away your necklace was the only thing worn above your waist.  <br />
<br />
Wait a minute?  Were your arms always tawny-coloured?  <br />
<br />
The smell of the rare tender meat reeled you in before you could explore these thoughts further, able to ignore the heat building in your pants as you devoured each and every piece there was, pausing briefly as a new scent reaches your smaller nose.  <br />
<br />
Dimly, you’re still aware that it’s Arianna sitting across from you, using her hands to wipe up bits of meat juice that spilled onto her chest and licking it up.  <br />
<br />
“Rrgh, you, shmelll, nishe…”  You manage to slur to her whiskered face.  <br />
<br />
“Th-thanksh…”  She manages to reply, her words muffled out slightly by the sound of deep growling and shredding fabric nearby.  “Shooooo, wanna……wrrannaaa…..”  <br />
<br />

<br />
POV Change:<br />
<br />
Once Mandy had left the main dining room, her smile faded.  Now she needed to report to her Manager and give her the update on the status of the current…operations.  The thing was, she’d been here longer than most of the others and she had come to know what to expect if things fell short of the goal.  <br />
<br />
Steeling herself up at the door, she rapped it twice and waited.  <br />
<br />
“Enter.”  The harsh hissing tone sounded through the thick wooden door.  <br />
<br />
Sliding in and closing it behind her, proceeding to one step away from the only desk in the stiflingly-hot room.  While she couldn’t see her manager as the high-backed leather chair was turned away from her, she did know exactly who was sitting there, using the few moments she had to steel herself as the chair turned to let its occupant face her.  <br />
<br />
To call her a snake would be half-right.  In that while her head was very much like one - save perhaps for having a nose that was extremely wide and splayed over her long snout - the rest of her body retained a humanlike appearance, if covered in copper (for the back, head, and arms) and tan (neck, chest, abs, and inner thighs) scales.  It was only now that Mandy noticed the immense circular plates on the desk, and that her Manager had eaten so much that her gut was distended almost to her knees.  Most likely the reason she couldn’t see any clothes on her Boss, leaving her scaled breasts resting on her swollen stomach.  <br />
<br />
“Doesss my appearance, offend you?”  She asked with a hint of mocking in her tone.  <br />
<br />
“N-not at all, Ms, Chalm-mers.”  Mandy managed to stutter out.  <br />
<br />
“Good.”  She laughed a hissing laugh before getting to business.  “Ssso what isss the sstatuss of the operation sso far?”  <br />
<br />
“As well as the three from earlier today, we, currently have seven in the Dining Room right now.  However, of those seven only three of them have taken all of it so far.”  Mandy wasn’t sure if it was the elevated temperature or her own nerves that was making her sweat.  <br />
<br />
“Four remain incomplete?”  <br />
<br />
“Y-yes.  That is correct.”  Mandy stayed in place, fearing the worst should her Boss not take the news well.  <br />
<br />
“Hmm.”  Ms Chalmers finally spoke after painfully long moments.  “We could, ussse ssome new ssstaff, after all, we run through them ssso fasst, don’t we?”  Speaking the last part as she patted her gut.  <br />
<br />
“Which ones in particular?”  Mandy risked a question.  “As we only really need two to make up the numbers.”  <br />
<br />
“It mattersss little, jusst so long asss the othersss won’t be a problem.”  <br />
<br />
“I’ll pick out the two then.”  Mandy promised as she started to take her leave.  <br />
<br />
“Oh, and Mandy?”  Ms Chalmers stopped her.  “You might wish to take a little boossster of the counter-drink.  Your earsss are looking a little, ‘wolfy’, again.”</p>
