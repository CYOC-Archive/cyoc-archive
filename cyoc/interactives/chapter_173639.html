<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With out the crowd knowing all four showers turn on and start spraying the four kids with this weird pink liquid with sparkles in it. <br />
<br />
Jackson was surprised when the liquid splashed his hair. In the shower there was a mirror that he looked in and to his complete shock the top of his head turned BLUE?! Along with part of his face turned as white as the snow. He touched his face a realized that the eye brow on that side of his face was GONE?!  replaced by a high arching black line  on his four head. As the liquid continued to pour out all over Jackson’s whole body, the rest of his skin turned white and makeup appeared on his face his nose started to blow up and turn a nice shade of red along with his hair which turned into a large blue Afro. That was when he noticed his clothes had also changed from the blue shirt and black athletic shorts into a bright one piece jump suit that was spit down the middle blue and red with the shoulders and arms being colorful and poofy. A white puffy collar appeared around his Neck, Wrists and Ankles. His feet grew to be size 20 and large blue and green clown shoes appeared on his feet. At this point instead of being confused Jackson actually started to laugh about what was happening. He also decided that he wanted to be called Jaxs T. Clown from now on. <br />
<br />
The next person line was The 14 year old Ryan who was also surprised when the pink liquid splashed and hit his hat. Taking it off to look at it he saw that it had turned into what looked like a hat similar to something Robin Hood would wear. The only difference being his at was HUGE and multicolored with a gigantic feather in it. When he looked into the mirror he was in shock when he saw that the hair on top of his head had fallen out and the hair around the edges had turned orange and curled out around the edges. His face had changed as well with his skin turning a deep orangey red color except for around his mouth and eyes which turned milk white. His nose then plumped up and turned blue, for some reason he couldn’t stop smiling. It was then that his clothes started to change as well with bottom of his t shirt expanding like a hula hoop. His sleeves extended down to just above his wrists where the cuffs of the sleeve hung down towards the ground. Much like Jax T Clown, Ryan’s shoulders puffed up a lot to much the rest of the outfit. His pants meanwhile turned into colorful tights and while his feet did grown as much as say Jax’s, only growing to about a size 18. His shoes on the other hand did change quite a bit turning similar colors to his hat and just as big they curled over several times at the toe. Laughing the whole time Ryan putting his large hat on to cover his bald spot decided that he wanted to be called Ringly T Clown from now on. <br />
<br />
Lucy was next she had taken the pink liquid right in the face when I turned on. When she got up she looked in the mirror and saw that she now had a clown face with a hot pink nose and everything. She was curious so she put her hair underneath the thick liquid taking it out she saw that it had turned into bright pink braids the were curling up like big U’s. Thinking about how she was turning into a clown and that the clowns probably going to change her back by the end of the show she just accepted it and made sure that the liquid would get over the rest of her body. Her skin turned as white as snow with freckles appearing on her face. She saw that her clothes changed into a wide jumpsuit that connected at the hips like a hula hoop. It was a sparkly pink and gold outfit that came with large white gloves and huge size 25 bright pink clown shoes to match her hair. Even though she thought that they would change her back after the show. She wasn’t sure if she wanted to go back as she was laughing. She thought about it and decided that she was going to be called Lulu T. Clown from now on or until they changed her back. <br />
<br />
Suzy was SUPER excited when she was chosen. She skipped up behind the clown and waited patiently as they draped the shower over her. She had a feeling that they would be changing them into clowns because she had seen the clown looking for volunteers earlier that day. Once the show turned on she saw that her theory was correct and she was more than excited to turn into one.  Her hair turned bright sky blue and styled into large pigtails at the top of her head. With her nose changing into a bright green as well. Her skin turned a hot pink and freckles along with white covering her eyes and mouth area. Her mouth was already in a permanent smile so nothing changed there. Her white and pink dress EXPLODED with color and size that ended just below her knees. Rainbow colored socks appeared on her with large red size 23 shoes. She had always wanted to be a clown so she had already decided that her name would be Suzapoluza T Clown. <br />
<br />
It was then when all of the curtains dropped revealing the new clowns. Jaxs T Clown did a front flip and landed in a flashy pose. Ringly T. Clown stepped out in his carefully because of his large outfit and gave a bow and a wave to the audience. Lulu T. Clown tripped over her new shoes and fell flat on her face, laughing she got up and waved to the audience. Suzapoluza did a couple spins and then posed towards the audience. Everyone was laugh at how crazy those kids looked dressed up as clowns. Yacko, Wacko, Wiggles ,and Giggles told the new clowns to come back stage with them and they told the parents that their kids will be back with the shortly.<br />
After the show ended all eight clowns where in Clown Alley in a group. Wiggles, Giggles, Wacko, Yacko, Jaxs, Ringly, Lulu, and Suzapoluza. The clown from the beginning of the day that originally got Can and Aidan to sign up came up to the group. He said that everyone did great and that from here they had a choice they could one of three things stay at the circus as a Clown. Work at the circus but still live at home as a clown. Or they could leave this all behind and go back to normal. Wiggles and Giggles decided to stay at the circus as clowns. While the rest of the group ended up choosing to work at the circus but stay as clown and live at home and go to school.</p>
