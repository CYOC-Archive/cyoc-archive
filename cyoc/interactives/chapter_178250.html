<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason was still in Rusty&#39;s body, which now felt strange and unwieldy again, so big and odd to move around in. He was still looking at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to keep those?&quot; The clerk asked, a smile forming on his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I.. don&#39;t know. I think I would have been happy there but what if something here is better?&quot; He then shook his head, slipped out of the boots and set them on the counter. &quot;I might, but I want to try something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason had expected to return to his old body in taking off the boots but he didn&#39;t, the clerk seemed to read his mind as Jason ran his hands over his still muscular chest. &quot;Oh, you won&#39;t return to your old body unless you put on your old shoes. But if you do that, your time in the store is over.&quot; He placed the boots on the back counter next to Jason&#39;s shoes. &quot;If you decide you want those.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Jason walked around the store, waiting for something to call out to him. Finally he saw a pair of size twelve sandals. He looked down at his size fourteen feet then back to the pair of sandals.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll fit.&quot; The clerk said before Jason could even ask his question. He took the pair of sandals back into the changing room. He found it amusing how literal that name was. He sat down and put the sandals on the floor. He only hesitated a moment before trying to slide his oversized feet into the smaller footwear. Almost instantly his foot shrank and slid to fit right in. They were still bigger feet than Jason was used to, but looked small on Rusty. Like before, his clothes vanished, leaving him in just the shoes.<br />
<br />
His legs were soon changing to match his feet though. He lost some length and muscle mass, though his legs were still well-muscled, they weren&#39;t bulky. The brown-red hair on his legs was also becoming a paler blond, but his skin was getting a tan. Rusty had a farmer&#39;s tan, but part of his skin was still pale. Whoever he was becoming either sunbathed or just had naturally tanned skin. His leg hair was losing some of its thickness, his thighs and ass becoming smooth as he lost bulk, though there was still a decent covering on his thighs.<br />
<br />
As his bush became blond, it too became less spread out and even seemed to become trimmed back. Surprisingly, he didn&#39;t lose much in the cock department, though a foreskin grew in over his shaft and head. He pulled it back, exposing the head of his cock and gave a small shiver at the feeling.<br />
<br />
Next he began to loose bulk in his torso, but he went from the thick manual-labor made build of Rusty to something more sculpted and toned. Broad shoulders leading to a trim waist, a perfectly cut six pack and rounded pectorals. His chest hair receded slightly becoming a smaller less dense patch across his chest then seemed to vanish completely, the same with the hair on his stomach, leaving only a small trail up to his navel. Though as he ran his hand over his chest he could feel just the hint of stubble. Whoever this was kept himself shaved.<br />
<br />
His arms followed along with the rest of his body, losing bulk but staying toned and sculpted, the soft bronzing of his skin giving him a very beach bum or lifeguard vibe. His neck thinned out slightly, as the changes progressed towards his face. His features lost Rusty&#39;s blockiness, becoming sharper. His nose thinned, brows losing some of their heaviness. His jaw was still prominent, but not as squared, it was still covered in a light layer of stubble which was turning blond as well, but it wasn&#39;t Rusty&#39;s usually avoidance of shaving for a few days, this was groomed stubble. He didn&#39;t look any older, still likely in his mid twenties.<br />
<br />
His hair turned blond, shortening to a short and spikey crew cut that suited him perfectly. This was someone who took pride in their grooming and body. Swim trunks formed on his legs, with a striped pattern in shades of blue, then a white tank top appeared on his torso, followed by a silk Hawaiian shirt with the buttons left open. Lastly, a pair of sunglasses appeared on his head. He looked like some catalogue model displaying beachwear, hell, even straight Jason new this guy was beyond just handsome.<br />
<br />
When he stepped out of the changing room the clerk gave another of his whistles. &quot;You really know how to pick &#39;em. You&#39;re finding all the hot men.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot; Jason said as he looked down at himself. His voice wasn&#39;t quite as deep as Rusty&#39;s had been, and it was a bit smoother. &quot;See you in a day?&quot; He asked, already heading to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you in a day.&quot; The clerk agreed.<br />
<br />
Jason once more stepped outside into summer warmth. But this wasn&#39;t the oppressive heat of the ranch. This was sunshine and warmth. He pulled down his sunglasses against the brightness and saw the ocean in the distance, a stretch of beach glittering in front of it. He was on a boardwalk, the steps down to the beach not far away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle Danny!&quot; Came a young voice, probably from a six year old and he knew it was calling for him. He felt a small hand slip into his own. His nephew Christopher looked up at him, his sister&#39;s kid. He had some of the family look, especially the blond hair. &quot;Come on! You promised you&#39;d build a sand castle with me, not go shopping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Alright.&quot; He said as the kid led him down onto the beach to a spot where an umbrella and a few towels were laid out. There was another guy already there, looking to be in his early thirties. He was Luke&#39;s height, and didn&#39;t have a bad body for showing off at the beach either, since he sat in just swim shorts. He didn&#39;t shy away from the gym, but had a bit of a dad bod, too. The muscle softened by a love of food and beer, not that he was fat, just not sculpted like Danny was. He was working sunscreen over his hairy pecs.<br />
<br />
That was Hank, his brother-in-law, well, ex-brother-in-law. His sister had left her family behind he remembered, deciding motherhood wasn&#39;t for her. When Hank started having trouble caring for his son and making bill payments on his own, Danny had moved in to help, his modeling career brought in enough money for their odd little family unit to live in comfort. Hank smiled up at him as Danny took a seat on the other towel. He felt his heart lurch a little. He was gay again, he knew that much, but did he have a crush on his sister&#39;s ex? <br />
<br />
This was going to be an interesting day.</p>
