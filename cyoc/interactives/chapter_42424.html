<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Experience is the greatest teacher there is, and in the art of magic, Circe was one of the best. She new chemicals by their odor and not by the modern names given to them by men of science. <br />
<br />
Taunted into feeling hate for those of her race, gender, and species, Anna sought by the power and knowledge of Circe to render her judgment down on two unfriendly students.<br />
<br />
Knowledge of what would happen then merged with attained knowledge as of what could happen if the time and place were oh so very right.<br />
<br />
On the way to science class, Anna, directed by Circe did see and then give a yank pull on the switch setting off the school fire alarm.<br />
<br />
A screaming siren and ring bells sent everyone save one into a panic to get out of the school building. In the panic that commenced, Anna under the direction of her bi-polar metal self did walk directly into the chemistry lab store room; where as Circe directed, a special potion from long hence in history again stood mixed and poured into a pistol griped spray bottle.<br />
<br />
The elixir prepared, Anna stood almost rigid as she closed her eyes and mentally asked Circe to tell her of what she blended, what would the spray do to those she then felt such a sense of hate.<br />
<br />
When the fire department rushed inside the building, Anna with her spray bottle ran out the door from the girls locker room, it having only a door handle and locking nob set on the in side.<br />
<br />
When the all clear sounded and the students with teacher staff then wandered back inside the building, Anna mixed wit the mob and followed along inside and to her chemistry class.<br />
<br />
Once seated in class, Anna picked a seat at a table directly behind Betty Barnes. Betty had to go to that class alone and without her usual sidekick in all their mayhem.<br />
<br />
&quot;The excitement is over, those responsible shall get what they truly deserve, God willing!&quot; Mr. Dodson, the teach said, as he began to write on the chalkboard the assignment of the day.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Betty turned around and with her hands touching her ears, made the remark to Anna of her ears were quite dry.<br />
<br />
Anna held her face in a general lack of expression, she holding to her spray with one hand, it buried out of sight but standing ready there in her bag purse.<br />
<br />
When the teacher told everybody to pay close attention to his experiment, Anna took out her spray bottle and with a healthy poof spray, she engulfed the head of Betty in that of what potion Circe helped make. <br />
<br />
Betty started suddenly to choke, she breathing in the fine spray, she turned to look at Anna, Anna then have a diabolical sort of grin. Anna winked an eye at Betty, she then asked, &quot;Having a change of mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
Couching and choking, Betty ran out the class room and down the hallway to one of the girl bathrooms. In her rush she turned a corner and came face to face with a policeman walking a big dog trained to sniff for explosives.<br />
<br />
Couching as if the cough came from her toes and out her mouth, Betty hung over a sink and did spit and drool as if she had ingested a sordid type of poison.<br />
<br />
As the drastic coughing fit subsided, Betty looked up into the mirror placed above the sink, she seeing not her own reflection, but that of what the dog in the hall had as its head. Seeing this she screamed in fright, and forgetting her purse and books, she ran out of the bathroom, down the hallway, and to the chemistry classroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bitch, you did this to me,&quot; Betty screamed as she looking and pointing toward Anna seated and working of the class problem looked up to see an angry student.<br />
<br />
The teacher and the entire class looked first at Betty and then turned around to give a wondering look back at Anna.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ain't going to become no dog!&quot; Betty screamed, she acting as if hysterical, the teacher picked up his cell phone and called the office, asking for a security officer to come and take hold of Betty.<br />
<br />
Moments later the security officer arrived, he escorted the wild eyed girl to the office, where she looking into a mirror there, discovered her head and face was not like to that of a dog.<br />
<br />
The class change bell rang and Anna with all the other students went into the hallways and on to their next classes.<br />
<br />
Walking toward her English class, Anna met Rhonda, she the partner in crime with Betty. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to Betty, she is acting like some wild eyed animal in the school office. She told them her head changed to look like that of a dog and that you did it!&quot; Rhonda exclaimed, she glaring at Anna as the many students passed past and paid no attention to this angry girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, all I did was make her wet behind her ears, like this,&quot; as Anna retrieved the spray bottle from her purse and did give a hearty cloud of mist into the face of Rhonda. <br />
<br />
Stunned by the cloud of chilly cold feeling mist, Rhonda took a deep breath, she breathing in the mist and began to cough too.<br />
<br />
Coughing frantically, Rhonda asked what the mist would do to her?<br />
<br />
&quot;It will change your mind about a lot of things, you like Betty shall know life from a different manner for sure!&quot; Anna remarked, she tucking back the spray bottle and walking away, she left Rhonda to cough, gag, and sputter there in the hall.<br />
<br />
Soon all alone in the school hallway, Rhonda strained to control her cough and decided to go on to her next class; but after school, she with Betty would teach Anna a lesson in getting even. <br />
<br />
Betty she still in the school office was lying on a couch there, trying to control her own sense for continued coughing. A she laid there the concerned policeman and his big dog came into the office to report an all clear. He saw Betty as did the dog, it came over to the girl, her eyes closed and as his wet nose touched her nose, they both jerked, jumped, and as Betty sat up, the dog took a jump backwards.<br />
<br />
Everybody close there also jumped, as that wild eyed look came over Betty and she like a beast wild and caught in a cage did leap up on the counter and begin snarling. <br />
<br />
The policeman with his dog stood for a moment and then Betty looked at the dog and bared her white teeth at the dog.<br />
<br />
The police dog whimpered, and turned to run back out of the office doorway. As with the policeman in tow, the large Newfoundland breed of dog turned tail and wanted only to run for home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boyce, Boyce, boy you come back here,&quot; the police officer called to his big dog, he ran after the loose dog, it charging outside the shcool and then went as if it were like its extra home, the dog leaped up into the police car front seat.<br />
<br />
An ambulance arrived soon after, as men struggled to capture Betty and take her away, suited in a straight jacket and she snarling and barking like she were a dog.</p>
