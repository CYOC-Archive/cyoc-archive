<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Liz’s meeting with the travel agent went better than she had expected. Maureen had initially enquired about a visit to Brisbane for the winter racing carnival. Liz was presented with package deals for three people. The packages were quite expensive but as the travel agent pointed out, at such late notice all the more affordable packages were gone. <br />
<br />
However, Meghan the agent, then showed Liz (thinking Liz was Maureen) a special deal they had just received. As the agent said “I know you have been interested in a trip to Spain. Have a look at this special deal” Indeed it was special. For less than 4 times the price of the Brisbane trip they could fly to Spain to attend the Sanlucar beach racing carnival. Plus have a tour of southern Spain including airfares. The deal seemed too good to be true. On being questioned the agent said the franchise had only 3 tickets available as it was a special promotion. She advised Liz that she need to make a quick decision as the deal would not last.<br />
<br />
“It just sounds too good to be true. What happens if this company goes under?”<br />
<br />
“It’s a company we have been dealing with for years. They are quite reputable. Our company would guarantee it. You would get your money back”<br />
<br />
“But why is it so cheap. That barely covers the cost of flights to Europe and back” <br />
<br />
“It’s a promotion. This is the first time they are doing this particular tour. They would be testing the waters. I’m sure they would ask you to provide a testimonial”<br />
<br />
“How long would I have to decide? I would need to ask my companions”<br />
<br />
“It’s first come first served. There are limited tickets. If you are interested I would advise booking today. Could I put you down for two of the tickets?”<br />
<br />
“All three actually. There were three of us who were thinking of the Brisbane trip. This is much better”<br />
<br />
“Well I will book you in. We would need a deposit within 24 hours”<br />
<br />
“I might be able to arrange it straight away. I’ll just need to check with my companions”<br />
<br />
Liz immediately did that. First she tried Maureen but didn’t get an answer. She did not know that Maureen was too busy serving and digging with her new college friends to hear the phone ringing in her borrowed handbag. She left a message. With no luck there. Liz found Roger’s phone number and dialled him. He answered.<br />
<br />
“Hi Darling, what’s up?”<br />
<br />
“I’m at the travel agents. We have a chance of going to a horse race in Spain rather than Brisbane. We have been talking about going there and this particular deal seems too good to miss. I’m sure Liz would be in it as well. Could I pass you to Meghan to explain? She suggests we should book today if we are interested”<br />
<br />
Liz passed the phone to Meghan. A few minutes later, after Meghan had explained everything to Roger a deal was apparently done. Meghan gave the apparent Maureen a thumbs up then passed the phone back to her.<br />
<br />
“Sounds good” said Roger. “I would be able to take the leave. What about Liz? Have you actually spoken to her?”<br />
<br />
Liz lied “She’s up for it”<br />
<br />
“Okay. Let’s do it. Organise to stay over for an extra 2 weeks. If we go that far we may as see as much as we can and I have plenty of leave&quot;<br />
<br />
Meghan was only too happy to book another tour. She arranged airfares and gave Liz a bundle of brochures on Spain and Portugal. Liz began to think that maybe four weeks wasn&#39;t long enough. &quot;Just transfer a deposit within 24 hours and you will be off to Spain. You won’t have to pay the remainder until a week before departure”<br />
<br />
Liz walked out with her arms filled with information. She was very excited.<br />
……..<br />
Maureen was also feeling very stimulated. It was fantastic having a young lithe body with no aches or pains. It was great to have boobs that didn&#39;t bounce out of control with every move she made but were still big enough to garner male attention. <br />
<br />
Her volleyball playing colleagues seemed nice people. There were three girls and 4 guys in the group they all made her feel welcome. All the guys and two of the girls were final year chemical engineering students getting together for a week at the beach before college resumed. Maureen was pleased to discover they were from another state and were unaware of the college Kirsty attended hence there was no chance they would recognise her. She told them her name was Maureen and that she was a trainee nurse (Maureen was actually a qualified but no longer working, nurse) enjoying a day off with a visit to the beach.<br />
<br />
After the volleyball finished she was coaxed into the water for a swim then invited to join the group relaxing on the sand and developing their tans. Maureen liked the fact that the males couldn’t help oogling her slim body. Other than Roger no males had looked like that at her in years, well perhaps Ray had the other night while she was wearing Liz’s body  but he was so old compared to these young studs.<br />
<br />
At some stage the guys decided on a walk up the beach but Maureen stayed with the girls and listened in as they chattered about the boys. Evidently Mason and Claire were an item as were Steve and Kirsty (Maureen was grateful she had not assumed Kirsty’s name). Charlotte was keen on Cameron but was disappointed that he had made no approaches on her. That left the dark haired Sean, who reminded Maureen of a young Roger. She had been the first of the guys Maureen had noticed.<br />
<br />
Upon questioning Maureen admitted that she did have a ‘boy’ back home whose name was Roger. She described her husband but took 30 years off his age.</p>
