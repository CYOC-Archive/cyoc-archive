<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie, 37, took her daughter Katie, now 10, to the accessory store to keep her promise of getting her ears pierced. They arrived at the store to find something that Kellie was not pleased with, however: the girl running the place appeared to be very young.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, who does the ear piercing around here?&quot; Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be me ma&#39;am,&quot; said the girl, whose name tag read Tiffani.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re so young!&quot; Kellie exclaimed. &quot;I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m supposed to let a child pierce my child&#39;s ear. When does the manager work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am, I&#39;m 19 and I&#39;ve been doing this for two years, don&#39;t worry,&quot; Tiffani responded. &quot;Our manager works later tonight, but he doesn&#39;t do any piercings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s irresponsible ...&quot; Kellie began to argue.<br />
<br />
Katie had heard enough. She was promised pierced ears and that&#39;s what she wanted, so she used the ring to remedy the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Tiffani,&quot; Katie thought to herself as she silently wished for her to begin aging.<br />
<br />
Tiffani, who was quite skinny, instantly began to fill out slightly, as she steamrolled through her 20s. Starting out at 105 pounds, the 5&#39;4 woman weighed about 120 pounds and looked a bit more mature in the face as Katie halted her aging at 35. Katie hoped that wasn&#39;t too much at once, and silently added a wish to make sure no one present was aware of the changes. Just for good measure, she also regressed her mother a few more years, leaving her 32. Kellie&#39;s hair changed slightly as she looked a bit fresher; her bangs had shifted into a side part and her honey-colored hair was now below her shoulders. Her clothes, made for her 43-year-old tastes, were now definitely looser and out of place on the younger mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss, I assure you your daughter is in good hands with me,&quot; Tiffani said, her voice a half octave lower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, OK then,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;Hop up there kiddo let&#39;s get those ears pierced!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie couldn&#39;t believe this! Her younger, cooler mom had given in to her request! She had won! As the process proceeded, Katie felt a strange tingle in her body. What was happening was that she had subconsciously wished herself older. As the warmth began in her body, Katie felt her clothes shifting and becoming smaller on a steadily growing body. Her arms and legs came first, growing out, long and gangly like the legs of a colt. Her fingers and toes became thinner, more distinct and dainty as the nails themselves became painted pink polish. She giggled and swung her legs and watched with fascination as her toes drifted further and further to the floor of the carpet, until the balls of her feet touched...then the flats, then the heels, She sighed in elation and realization that she was growing up, finally able to touch her feet to the floor of most places at last, though a part of her somehow wished she could swing her legs at times.<br />
<br />
The coltish appearance stopped there though as she experienced something strange. Her hips began to push out, just a little bit at a time, gaining a slight curve, at the same time her legs and arms gained a distinct tone to them as if she&#39;d spent every day running, playing and moving. Her stomach gurgled as it also flattened and toned nicely, and she could watch the change as it spread along her bare belly and along her belly button, leaving her abdomen neatly pretty like she&#39;d seen girls who entered surfing competitions. By now her pants had stretched beyond its limit and she felt a new strange tingling beneath it, she felt a warmth as within her insides her body began to approach the age of adolescence. She could not see the changes, but she distinctly felt them, letting out a little gasp as new thoughts and understands began to grow in her young preteen mind.<br />
<br />
At the same time her top would begin to swell with the growth of two small mounds beneath it, the same warmth below filling them as she began to develop...her eyes widening now as she understood what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m....entering puberty...&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought excited and terrified her and the changes weren&#39;t done. She could see her face in the mirror as the cute, childlike features began to define. Her button nose was still that, but it was starting to even out. The freckles on her face were less prevalent and her teeth rearranged as some adult ones grew in. She gained a certain maturity, a certain beginning of beauty as her hair began to flow long to her back and around her newly pierced ears. A prick and pain and looking down she found her ring pierced in her belly button, as if it has always been there. A few minutes later, they left the store with Katie&#39;s ears pierced, plus a few accessories for herself that Kellie had absent-mindedly bought for herself. Once they were clear of the shop and heading back toward the department store, Katie willed Tiffani to revert back to the age she was earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sweetie, I hope you don&#39;t mind, I need to buy some things before we go,&quot; Kellie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK mom. what do we need,&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just need to pick up a few more outfits. Some of my clothes ... I dunno, they just seem so ... OLD lately. Like not my style at ALL.&quot; Kellie frowned. &quot;If you ask me, you could use a new outfit or two yourself, it&#39;s starting to look a bit small on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked down at her 14-year-old frame, she had sprouted six more inches to 5&#39;5&#39;&#39; as she started to go through her first growth spurt, ageing her up to three more years. But that’s not all that’s changing. Her breasts already expanded to A-cups and she’s already seeing signs of an hourglass figure over her tightening outfit. Fatty deposits started to form on her hips as they slowly expand a bit, beginning to form curves. Her rear started to expand a little as well to accommodate her early curves. Her arms and legs grew a little longer, but muscle growth started to form on her lanky frame. She looked towards her hands and could see them getting big and dainty, as her fingers grew thinner right before her eyes and nails growing out. Her face started to mature a little bit as her face started to change shape and matured more and her freckles faded more. Her nose was starting to get longer and thinner as she was loosing her precious button nose. As she was looking at the mirror, she could feel something strange in her teeth and started to feel metal around her tongue. Opening her mouth, she could see what looked like braces. You scratched your head and wondered how they got there. That’s when she remembered her mental changes were kicking up as knowledge for grade school kept expanding. Along that were growing memories as she remembered she obtained these braces when she was thirteen. She figured that since her teeth were a little messed up, she needed brace to straighten her teeth. Her hair has reached her shoulders and was lightened in color from dark brown to medium brown. &quot;Yeah...&quot; shrugged Katie, her voice lower as she matured. &quot;But I think I can still pull it off...&quot; She felt a minor migraine as she could feel her brain growing as well. Years of knowledge are filling her mind, as she was getting smarter by the second. In fact, common knowledge of kindergarten and grade school are easier for her as knowledge of high school entered her head. But that’s not the only thing that is entering her head. Ever since she was five, she always like going outside to play, rather it is hide and seek, ball, or playing tag. But now that she’s growing, her body is becoming predisposed and more athletic. Looking at herself, Katie could tell that her body was a little toned then before as she was gaining both energy and metabolism from the ‘years’ of sports. Her mind was also being filled with memories of the many years she participated in sports including T-ball, soccer, and gymnastics.</p>
