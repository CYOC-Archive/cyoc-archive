<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Peter and Mary’s engagement dinner went off like a dream; dessert and wine were on the house thanks to Peter’s new business partner, and they were both delighted to hear that that degenerate homosexual was out of a job and out of their lives. As the evening came to a close, the newly engaged, newly straight couple retired to Peter’s beautiful apartment for the night. Normally, a virtuous couple like Peter and Mary would wait until they were married to consummate their relationship, but they were to deeply in love (and perhaps a little too deep into the bottle) to resist a passionate night of hot, steamy, straight love-making together.<br />
<br />
	The moment the two lovers entered Peter’s bedroom, they were a whirlwind of hands and lips. Mary, being the good, submissive wife-to-be she was, melted into her lovers arms as his hands roamed over her, moving underneath her dress to rub her smooth, perky breasts. His lips locked against hers and their tongues wrapped together, and Peter could feel Mary’s breathing quicken with anticipation, both lovers knowing exactly how and where tonight’s celebration was going to end. At long last, Peter gently undid Mary’s evening gown and let it fall to the carpet, and unclasped her lacy bra to let loose his fiancee’s bouncy, perfect breast. She smiled to him and slinked over to his bed and laid down while her hunky lover undressed himself, her aching pussy getting wetter by the second as Peter revealed more and more of his muscular body.<br />
<br />
	Within moments, Peter was atop his fiancée, preparing to take his virgin lover for the first time. Unbeknownst to either of them, of course, both lovers were only a few hours ago happily and proudly gay, and neither would have ever dreamed that this night would end with them making hot, passionate love to a member of the opposite sex, let alone being ecstatic to be doing so.<br />
	<br />
	“I love you… I’m going to make a woman out of you…” Peter whispered as he nibbled his fiancee’s ear.<br />
	<br />
	“Oh god… I’m going to be a wife…. A mother… I’m so… so…” Mary whispered, unable to contain her deepest desires. No longer a proud lesbian, she was now a happy, submissive wife-to-be. And before long, she was destined to be a happy mother to Peter’s babies.<br />
	<br />
	Taking his wife’s happy smile as a signal, Peter firmly pushed his rock-hard cock into his woman’s dripping pussy, breaking though her maidenhead in a single movement. Mary gasped, first in pain and then in pleasure, knowing that her duty as a woman was being fulfilled. Peter thrusted in and out, dominantly and confidently pounding his thick cock into his lover’s tight cunt. With each push, he couldn’t help but think about all of the degenerate fags he run into that day. Those disgusting apes would never know this pleasure as they pointlessly fucked each other in the ass; the only way to really be a man is to pound a woman and fill her pussy to the brim with hot baby-making cum. Speaking of which, Peter felt his cock being to drool precum, pure pleasure traveling up and down his perfect cock as he prepared to blast his load into his beautiful wife-to-be…<br />
<br />
	The two newly engaged straight lovers went at it for hours, both of them cumming and cumming again, until neither of them could keep going.  Deep down, Mary knew as a woman that she was unquestionably pregnant with Peter’s children, and she whispered that fact into his ear, both of them beaming and panting in their post-coital bliss.<br />
<br />
	However, as their arousals finally faded, so too did the curse. Slowly but surely, Peter and Mary began to fade away and Pete and Marilyn began to reemerge. Peter’s thick, rippling chest and leg muscles began to smooth out, and his carefully managed hair grew wavy and soft. Meanwhile, Marilyn’s face rounded out a bit, becoming less defined, while her dark brown hair reeled back into her scalp, returning to its previous short, blonde style. In moments, the homophobic breeders were no more and two shocked and exhausted young gays were left in their places.<br />
<br />
	The high-class apartment, the expensive evening clothes that were scattered around the room, and most of glimmering gold and diamond engagement ring on Marilyn’s finger remained firmly in place. The formerly homophobic straight breeders could only stare back at the ceiling in horror remembering what they had done and said throughout that evening; how they had abandoned their lovers, ever other gay person they had insulted, how self-centered and insufferable they had been, and most of all how they had fucked one another (and loved it) for hours. Marilyn still knew, deep down, that she was pregnant with the stranger laying next to her’s children, and even if she got an abortion she’d live with the memory of tonight for the rest of her life. They felt like they had betrayed every gay person in the world, and that’s when they heard a voice whisper into their very minds.<br />
<br />
	“You two have been cursed, or perhaps I should say blessed, to be were-breeders, and I am the manifestation of this blessing. From this night forward, whenever you feel your disgusting attraction to a member of your own sex, you shall again transform into the lovers Mary and Peter, destined to love one another and hate ever filthy faggot you come across. And whenever you insult those animals, you spread the blessing on to them, until your blessing is spread to every fag, dyke and queer in the world and their own curse of homosexuality is eradicated. Unless, of course, you accept my little bargain.”<br />
<br />
Still horrified and in despair, the Marilyn and Pete were ready to do anything to escape that horrible fate.<br />
<br />
	“I’m not cruel. I want you two to be happy. Happy and straight, man and wife as it was intended to be. So, here is my bargain: Make love once again, as Pete and Marilyn, cursing your disgusting homosexuality all the while. Seal that part of you deep within and become the lovers Peter and Mary by choice. Forever. Marry, have your children, whatever you like. Do this, and your blessing will no longer spread to other fags. Live together, happy in the knowledge that you chose to live as was intended, as man and woman. That is my offer to you. How about it?”<br />
<br />
	Pete felt nearly catatonic from shock at this vile bargain, but couldn’t help but consider it for a moment. Marilyn, likewise, absentmindedly rubbed her belly, unable to forget the life that was beginning to grow within. What would they do…?</p>
