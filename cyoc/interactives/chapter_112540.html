<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Freddie and Rob joined the long line of cars trying to leave the crowded parking lot.  The parking lot had been set up in haste and was not designed to handle the large number of people who unexpectedly attended the carnival, creating a quagmire of traffic.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, tell me more about your dream girl?&quot; asked Freddie.<br />
<br />
Rob blushed.  &quot;Why do you want to know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No reason, really. Just curious, I guess.  It&#39;ll help kill the time anyway, &quot; said Freddie defensively. He really didn&#39;t know why he cared. But for some reason he really wanted to know.  It was almost like he was jealous.  But why should it matter to him who this guy liked?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, like I said, I like red heads, &quot; said Rob.  He felt a little weird discussing this with a guy, let alone a complete stranger.  But he felt a strange compulsion to descibe his fantasy girl to him.<br />
<br />
Freddie rolled his eyes.  &quot;You already said that, &quot; he said, twirling the red strands of hair slowly spreading across his head.  &quot;But why?  And what kind of red head?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know why. I guess because red heads are unique, less common. Maybe because of their fiery temper. But I just can&#39;t resist a girl with long luscious dark red hair, like a vixen.  But it&#39;s not just the hair.  I love their white alabaster skin marked with just a smattering of freckles across their smooth, soft skin.  It reminds me of wild leopard or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Freddie felt the tingling in his groin spread across his whole body, as his skin lightened to a pale white marked with freckles. His nipples changed to a pale pink color.  It felt so good he didn&#39;t notice the long locks of red hair streaming down his scalp past his shoulders.  As  he closed his eyes and enjoyed the sensations of his changing body, he knew something was wrong. But the feeling was so good he didn&#39;t want it to stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on, &quot; he said huskily. &quot;Tell me more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob felt a little weird talking about it, but he also couldn&#39;t help getting really into it.  Picturing his perfect girl got his dick even harder, and it felt like it was getting even bigger than it ever had.  Like those wet dreams he had as a kid when his penis got impossibly large.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like the girl at the show she would have a narrow waist and wide hips.  She wouldn&#39;t be fat, but she would have lots of nice curves.  Especially her ass.  She would definitely have a nice bubble butt. And her chest would be big - bigger than the girl on stage.  At least a DD cup,&quot; said Rob with excitement.<br />
<br />
Freddie moaned as he listened to Rob&#39;s description, unaware that his body was changing to meet Rob&#39;s demands.  He could almost see the girl in his mind as he kept his eyes closed, could almost feel her body beneath his hands.<br />
<br />
Rob felt the same way. The image of the girl seemed to materialize in his mind as he described her, getting clearer as he continued to talk about it.  And it was making him so horny.<br />
<br />
&quot;And she would be short, but not too short.  Around 5&#39;4&quot; I think.  And have a cute squeaky little voice to go with her small delicate body.  And small little dainty hands and feet.  She would have no body hair, well aside from her head and a small tuft of red hair just above her pussy. Yeah, that would be the best part:  her small, tight pussy that was almost always wet and really sensitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, &quot; moaned Freddie loudly, massaging his changing groin.  He was close to orgasm and he knew he should be ashamed.  But it felt so good he just didn&#39;t care.  But his moan sounded strange to his hears.  Too high and .... squeaky?  <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?!? &quot; said Freddie, surprised by the sound of his voice.  He stopped masaging himself and opened his eyes, shocked by the changes in his body.  &quot;What the fuck!&quot; <br />
<br />
Rob almost hit the car in front of him as he turned and saw the bombshell beside him, also curious at the tone of Freddie&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to me?&quot; asked Freddie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but I like it,&quot; said Rob.<br />
<br />
Freddie looked over at Rob and saw him stroking his large cock - a cock that was now almost a foot long!<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to get out of here,&quot; said Freddie as he reached for the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, don&#39;t go, &quot; said Rob, reaching over and grabbing his hand.  &quot;Don&#39;t you want to try this out first?&quot;<br />
<br />
Freddie looked down at Rob&#39;s large junk, now fully exposed from his pants. It was thick with bulging veins that seemed to pulse.  Freddie was repulsed - not by the sight of the impressive organ, but rather because a large part of him was tempted to try it out, to ride that lovely pony.<br />
<br />
But the small fragment of his rational mind won out.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Go fuck yourself!&quot; said Freddie angrily, as he punched Rob hard in his large testicles with his free right fist.  Ron moaned in pain and let go of his left arm.  Freddie jumped out of the car and walked away. With some disgust he saw that Rob must have enjoyed it a little, flinging the small amount of precum that had landed on his hand into the night air.<br />
<br />
Rob jumped out of the car and beckoned for him to return, pleading for Freddie to come back.  But Freddie ignored him and continued to walk through the parking lot past other waiting cars.  A few men stepped out and offered to help him.  But if they stared too long he felt his body begin to tingle and shift.  He had to get out of here and hide, away from other people. Or maybe he should go back to Madame Illusia&#39;s tent.  Surely the show was over and he could get her help.  Or maybe he should just leave this crazy place and just walk home alone - surely, the magic would fade after he left the grounds of the carnival.<br />
<br />
Freddie sighed and weighed his choices, as more men offered to help the cute damsel in distress.</p>
