<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still mad that he was shut out of the Elementary School, and his attempts to delay the project any longer will now be fruitless; Jack Crawford was seething. His plan to prove that Benton was unable to keep a promise to the town as well as his plan to show how mentally unhinged the man was, faced a major roadblock.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that his wife was giving him some of the best oral pleasure he ever had; Jack was unable to keep his mind off of the plans he had in the works and the frantic calls and emails he needed to make to put them back on track. Grunting as Kenya caused him to blow his load into her mouth; Jack managed an approving smile as she drank down every drop of his seed.<br />
“I have to hand it to you Kenya,” Jack sighing; “you give great head.”<br />
“I can give you more if you want,” Kenya climbing out from under the desk; “just come back to bed with me.”<br />
<br />
Jack smiles, knowing that his wife can be insatiable when it comes to the rutting; he was usually all for giving her sex a vigorous probing and pounding, yet right now he had other matters on his mind.<br />
“Later,” Jack smiling; “right now I need to contact Riley and get an update from him.”<br />
“Poo,” Kenya pouting; “I’m horny now!”<br />
“God don’t I know,” Jack feeling Kenya’s paw stroking his feline member back to full mast; “but I need to lay a good foundation for your bid to become mayor successful darling. Let me put these few matters to bed,” Jack purring as he feels another orgasm coming from Kenya’s ministrations; “and I’ll rut you good.”<br />
<br />
Kenya doesn’t answer; she just stares into Jack’s eyes as she feels his member twitch and spill his warm salty seed on her paw. Licking her hand clean as she watches Jack’s eye flutter and listening to his purring. She smiles as she gets out from his side of the desk. Her tail twitching as she saunters back to the bed room; Kenya allows Jack to get a good long look as her aroused sex as she casually bends over to pick up her discarded bathrobe from earlier.<br />
“I’ll hold you to your promise then,” Kenya smiling; her sharp teeth showing as the lips on her muzzle part, before walking back to the bed room.<br />
<br />
“Fuck,” Jack sighing; “my wife has some fine ass there.”<br />
Letting his gaze linger a little longer, Jack soon turns his attention to his computer. Re-reading the emails regarding having his security revoked by Benton yet again; Jack knew it would only be a matter of time before he was able to get it reinstated. Not that he ever visited the head office of Knight Industries; Jack was a stockholder and as such a member of the board. A minority member maybe, but he continued to use that to ensure that his access into any Knight Industries holdings was maintained.<br />
<br />
Jack was about to call Riley when his phone buzzes. Seeing that the caller i.d was Arnold Steward Stevenson, Jack answers it.<br />
“What is up Arnold,” Jack doing his best to be polite. Not fully trusting the were-donkey as he knows of the jackass’s shady construction company and failed attempt to muscle in on the elementary school construction project Jack was now shut out of.<br />
“I just heard that Melissa Stovall,” Arnold speaking: “had her twins. A boy and a girl.”<br />
“Fraternal twins,” Jack sounding genuinely surprised; “now that is rare.”<br />
“Despite the fact that Martin is the campaign manager for Samantha,” Arnold speaking; “it would be good sport and a show of civility to send a note of congratulations.”<br />
“You wouldn’t by any chance catch any names,” Jack asking.<br />
“Joshua for the boy,” Arnold answering; “Dawn for the girl.”<br />
“Okay,” Jack thinking; “I’ll talk to Kenya about that. Anything else?”<br />
“Peter Talbot was shot last night,” Arnold stating; “the criminal wanted his 66 mustang and nearly killed the young man.”<br />
“Sucks to be the crook,” Jack chuckling; “Leon Talbot from what I heard will want his head on a pike.”<br />
“Well,” Arnold responding; “that may be difficult; this criminal is wanted and is the son of Freddie the Shark Parker, a mobster from San-Francisco.”<br />
“Well that is a nice happy accident,” Jack smiling; “that will keep the elder council occupied as I continue with my plans for Moon Lake.”<br />
“Just what is it you are planning,” Arnold asking.<br />
“And spoil the surprise,” Jack chuckling; “you’ll just have to wait until after Kenya becomes mayor.”<br />
<br />
Jack disconnects the call before Arnold could continue. However if Jack heard what the were-donkey was going to bray next, it would run the were-panther’s blood cold. Instead Jack dials Riley’s number. Hearing the line ring and ring and ring; Jack gets the were-rat’s voicemail and leaves a rather terse message for him to get back to him.<br />
“I’m supposed to be getting this information from you Riley,” Jack fuming; “not from Arnold.”<br />
Looking at his emails once again; Jack decides a few issues could wait. Looking towards his bedroom, the were-panther smiles lustfully; there is a were-panthress desiring his steely shaft in her and Jack was more than happy to provide it.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, tied to a chair and whimpering in pain; a bruised and bloodied were-rat was being worked over by a couple of were-tigers. Being ordered not to kill the man, they punch and strike the were-rat before a growl ordering them to stop is uttered from the shadows. The were-tigers looking in the direction of the darkness, bow their heads respectfully as two white furred were-tigers step into the light.<br />
<br />
“Riley,” one of them speaking up; “I’m going to be straight with you. Your employer is in a lot of trouble with us. We warned him months ago not to interfere with our plans yet we know he has ignored our warning.”<br />
“What are you talking about,” the were-rat sobbing; “why are you doing this to me?”<br />
“Jack Crawford,” the white were-tiger speaking; “we told him to stay away from Benton Knight but he wouldn’t listen to us. Which is why you are going to tell us everything he has planned.”<br />
“And if I refuse,” the were-rat looking terrified.<br />
“You get to endure a second round with the tigers over there,&quot; the white tiger answering; “so unless you want that, it would be in your best interest to tell me and my grandson Kai what Jack is planning.”<br />
“I don’t know,” the were-rat sobbing; “Jack Crawford just told me to keep an eye on a few things regarding Benton Knight.”<br />
“Explain why you had this device in your possession,” Kia displaying the covert surveillance device.”<br />
“Jack wanted to know what Benton was saying during his sessions with Frances Twist,” The were-rat sobbing; “I was retrieving it when your goons shanghaied me.”<br />
“How long has Jack been bugging the doctor’s office,” Far Houjin snarling; “answer me!”<br />
“Since New Year’s,” Riley blubbering; “Frances and Benton came close to discovering the bug when Benton punched the wall during one session. Please let me go,” Riley crying.<br />
<br />
Far looks at the sobbing were-rat for a moment before speaking to his grandson in mandarin.<br />
“Jack Crawford is becoming a bothersome thorn,” Far sighing<br />
“To think we are helping Benton stay as CEO,” Kai rolling his eyes; “instead of unseating him as originally planned.”<br />
“We are honored bound to do so,” Far shaking his head; “the man has showed he could be a better person just by reconnecting with his daughter. We must discharge this debt for the sake of our clan&#39;s honor.”<br />
“Yet he counts us as enemies,” Kai glumly responding; “when he found out we were residing at Tachibana’s estate-“<br />
“Our mistake grandson,” Far calmly answering; “we did overstay our welcome and Jack Crawford did eventually out us to Benton. That man thought he could get Benton to attack and assault us at Tachibana’s.”<br />
“Benton surprised us all by just being verbally abusive instead of physically,” Kai looking at the were-rat still tied up; “so what are we going to do with him?”<br />
“Keep him tied up for now,” Far looking at the were-rat; “have the tigers work him over some more. Then toss him at Crawford’s front entrance with a note from the Wang Technological Consortium. It’s time the white tiger clan step onto the stage.”<br />
“I’ll keep looking at his email’s,” Kai still speaking in Mandarin; “both his and his Ashford alias.”<br />
“I can’t believe he still hasn’t discovered the worm you put on his computer,” Far chuckling; “I can’t believe he would go so far as to bug Frances Twist’s office just to oust Benton from Knight Industries.”</p>
