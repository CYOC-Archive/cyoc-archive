<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After instinctually gorging themselves on the giant sows teats, Princess Connie and Dili the former gnome <br />
started to come to their senses.<br />
<br />
Connie was the first to come out of the disorientation of being transformed. She sniffed and looked around <br />
finding herself in a rather muddy pig pen. She snorted in disgust at her situation and at the sight of large <br />
pigs bathing in mud. &quot;This is no place for a Princess!&quot; she thought, not yet realizing she too was a pig. <br />
Feeling something behind her she spun round awkwardly and got a glimpse of her own twitching tail. Still <br />
confused, she tried to stand up on her little piggy hind legs but didn't manage to even get halfway up before <br />
she fell back down, splashing in the mud and giving herself a thick wet coat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; she tried to say but what came out was an awkward squeal that surprised her. <br />
<br />
<br />
It was starting to dawn on her what had happened. She was on all fours, couldn't stand up or talk properly and <br />
she was in a pig pen. Trying to stay calm and not panic she waded through the mud towards a large puddle that <br />
contained a bathing boar. The boar looked rather large itself, even whilst half submerged and she got the <br />
distinct impression that the muck was squelching further up her arms than some of the other pigs.<br />
<br />
Peering into the puddle, her worst fear was realized. Staring back was a big pair of nostrils between little <br />
intelligent eyes. She twitch her nose and the pig staring back twitched too. A tuft of her straight blonde <br />
hair flopped to one side in an imitation of her human boyish hair cut. It was definitely her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man!&quot; she squealed, barely coherently but understandable with some effort, &quot;why'd I have to be a stinky <br />
pig? Morgana's going to pay for this!&quot;<br />
<br />
The big boar turned and walked towards her sniffing. He really was huge. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eep!&quot; she squealed and started walking backwards as best as she could, not wanting to turn her behind towards <br />
the male pig for fear of him getting the wrong idea that she was &quot;presenting&quot; herself to him. She'd seen pigs <br />
&quot;going at it,&quot; on a farm before and had no intention of getting knocked up by a dirty beast even if she was <br />
one herself. She never liked staying at home or being schooled like a proper Princess and instead spent her <br />
days gallavanting about town and the countryside farms, trying to slip away from the bodyguard her father <br />
forced upon her.  Right now she really wanted a body guard. <br />
<br />
Connie stumbled onto her pig bottom as the boar edged closer and the little pig shook as the big pig loomed <br />
closer, towering over her. To her surprise it carried on trotting right passed her and she got the full view <br />
of its considerable size. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gross,&quot; she squealed as she was nearly eye level with its dick, &quot;that's not something I wanted to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boar passed her and she watched it lumber toward an even larger pig. A gargantuan pig with a red cloak <br />
draped across it and a crown on its head. An image of her father transforming into the giant pig flashed in <br />
her mind as she remembered what led up to her arrival on the farm. If pigs could blush she would have as the <br />
memory of suckling on the big sows teats returned to her. Thankfully, being a piglet and not a grown sow, she <br />
wasn't ready for a mate and she resolved to change back long before then. For a brief moment she consider <br />
herself lucky for not having to eat pig slop but quickly dismissed it - they were both as bad as each other <br />
but as long as she was a piglet she'd probably have to keep doing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eww! And I suck that pig boob in front of Sara and Maedel as well!&quot; she bemoaned before starting to panic <br />
once again, &quot;If they think I'm acting like a pig they might think I've lost my mind and not change me back!&quot;<br />
<br />
By now, Dili had regained her senses and had checked her piggy appearance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Dili tried to say but was just about clear enough for Connie to understand. Connie recognized the pink <br />
tuft of hair as that of the gnome that had attacked her fathers place along with Sara, Maedel and her <br />
tormentor, Morgana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; she squealed back.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to think of a way to escape,&quot; said Dili before her mouth dropped open in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Connie asked. <br />
<br />
She shook and squealed as she was lifted into the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh such cute little piggies!&quot; gushed the giant farm girl that had lifted Connie up. The girl was dressed much <br />
like a typical milk maid but wore big boots in the mud. &quot;What a funny little tuft of hair! I wonder who you <br />
used to be? No matter. Mistress Morgana told me to take good car of you ickle, little piggie wiggies!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Help us!&quot; Connie squealed, surprising the farm girl.<br />
&quot;Oh wow! You can still talk... Kinda,&quot; she smiled before turning serious, &quot;Sorry but Morgana probably won't <br />
change you back. Me and Bo Peep, over there, used to be a city guards before she turned me into a cute milk <br />
maid and her into a sheep herder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dili and Connie saw the girl she mentioned smiling down at them from her position leaning over the pig pens <br />
fence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry. We'll take good care of you two. That's Bo Peep and I'm Sally. What's your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C-connie,&quot; &quot;Dili,&quot; they said reluctantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo Dili the piggy! That's just perfect!... Sorry the pig sty isn't quite fit for a Princess though. I guess <br />
that's why Morgana gave me this,&quot; Sally the milkmaid pulled a tiny tiara attached to some string from her <br />
apron pocket and tied it around Connie's head.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's really not necessary,&quot; Connie snorted. Wonderful. As if being a pig wasn't bad enough already, now <br />
everyone would know exactly who the little piglet was. The comparatively giant human girls excused themselves <br />
to carry on doing their farm work promising to come play with the piglets later. Bo Peep laughing that they <br />
should enjoy a skin youthening mud bath in the meantime much to Connies dismay.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've got to dig our way under the fence if we want to get out,&quot; said Dili as she immediately began shoveling <br />
mud away with her snout. It looked gross but Connie agreed to help. Soon they had a hole big enough to crawl <br />
through. &quot;Good work... but we should probably... eat... and poop before we make a break for it. We don't know <br />
when we'll get the next chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gross. When we change back don't tell anyone about this, okay?&quot; Connie squealed.<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot;</p>
