<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Leopold.  Do not think of the sword as a weapon.  Think of it as an extension of yourself.&quot;  Gabriel explained.  &quot;Let it move with you, not against you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s very difficult Gabriel.&quot;  Leopold whined, slashing at a practice dummy with his new sword.  &quot;Would it be possible to use a different kind of sword?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  Gabriel asked, looking at the great sword.  &quot;This is the same sword the Hero of Light used to defeat Falcour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I understand.  But it&#39;s very big.&quot;  Leopold continued whining.  &quot;Maybe if I had a more agile sword.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you are looking for a sword with great agility, then try this out.&quot;  Gabriel suggested, raising his hand.  The sword glowed a bright white, before lifting into the air.  The glowing became brighter and brighter, before just becoming a floating blob of white.  When the glowing faded, a new sword appeared.  This one looked more like a katana, with the gemstone still embedded in the hilt.  &quot;The kingdoms of the east use these types of swords.  They are swift, and very sharp.  Please be careful.&quot;  Gabriel explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Gabriel.&quot;  Leopold smiled, picking up the katana.  &quot;This is much lighter than the other sword.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  They are light and swift, made to take out the enemy before they realize that they&#39;re in a fight.&quot;  Gabriel explained.  &quot;Be careful.  This blade is much sharper than the other.  You may have divine protection now, but that will only stop you from being hurt by evildoers, like Rowan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.  I will make sure to be careful.&quot;  Leopold stated, trying a few practice swings with the katana.  After a couple of minutes, it seemed that Leopold understood how to use the weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once you find the weapon you are comfortable with, the skills necessary to wield it should come naturally.&quot;  Gabriel started.  Before he could start his next sentence, the golden gem on the hilt started to turn a faint blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabriel, what does this mean?&quot;  Leopold asked, pointing to the gem.<br />
<br />
&quot;It means that a minor threat is approaching.&quot; Gabriel explained.  &quot;Probably an animal or a bandit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What should I do?&quot;  Leopold asked.  &quot;I don&#39;t have the skills for combat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you do.  You just need to find them.&quot;  Gabriel chuckled.  &quot;Part of your soul is the soul of the old hero!  His skills are locked somewhere in there.  You just need to unlock them.  I think this combat will surely help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so Gabriel.&quot;  Leopold responded worriedly.  He&#39;d been the Hero of Light for about one day now, and already was going to have to fight something.  As time passed, the blue gem&#39;s color intensified.  Leopold figured out that as the threat grew nearer, the color grew darker.  Eventually, Leopold could see what was setting the gem off.  A bandit was approaching the farm.  Leopold was not going to let someone steal from his family.  Using his wings, he rushed towards the bandit faster than the bandit could comprehend, and slashed him with the sword.  Rather than cut the bandit like Leopold expected and feared, it merely knocked him back, and sent him rushing away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sword will not harm anyone or anything unless it deems it necessary, or if you are careless.&quot;  Gabriel added.  &quot;Also, I told you your combat skills would come naturally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you were right.&quot;  Leopold laughed.  &quot;Back to practicing.&quot;<br />
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Waking up is always the worst part of the day.  Especially when it&#39;s to Rowan&#39;s snoring.  You wanted to tell your master that it was an issue, but you didn&#39;t want to offend him.  Besides, after you wake up, Rowan is generally up within a few minutes.  After getting out of your dragon bed, you immediately switched into your human form, the one with demonic features, and headed to the dining room for breakfast.  Sure enough, Rowan was quick to follow.  At breakfast, you decided what you were going to do during the day.  However, your plans were cut short when a presence was felt by the castle gate.  You and Rowan walked to the front gate, where you saw a group of knights being led by a warlock.  You could tell from looking at him that the warlock made a pact with an angel that gave him divine magical powers.  Not that it mattered.  You and Rowan were leagues beyond him in power.  Before you could do anything to destroy the small party, Rowan stopped you.  &quot;Gannoth.  I know you want to have some fun, but I haven&#39;t gotten to use this ring yet.&quot;  Rowan smiled as he pointed to the blue ring on his finger.  &quot;Let&#39;s make that warlock kill his friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, that&#39;s even more evil than I could imagine.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;Can I have some snacks for the show?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re still hungry.&quot;  Rowan laughed.  &quot;What kind of snacks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Change into a dragon and munch on one of the knights.&quot;  You suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, just don&#39;t make to big a mess.&quot;  Rowan smiled, allowing you to finish your breakfast.  You smiled as you morphed back into your 15 foot dragon form.  It felt good to feel the strength of a dragon refill your body.  You stretched your wings out before darting towards the group of knights, snatching one up in your claw, frying him, and eating him.  It tasted a bit more metallic than you generally like, but that was because of the armor.  While that was going on, Rowan was confronting the knights.  You perched on top of the gate, a perfect place to watch the show.  &quot;Hello.  I see you are a small party from Brus.  How may I help you?&quot;  Rowan asked cockily.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here to kill you Rowan!&quot;  The warlock yelled.  &quot;We know you destroyed Kitria!  You need to pay for your actions.&quot;  He was a feisty one.  But he left Rowan unperturbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should I?&quot;  Rowan laughed evilly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Millions of people were killed!&quot;  One of the knights yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And millions more will be.&quot;  Rowan laughed once again.  &quot;All because of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a monster Rowan Tyrell.&quot;  The warlock scorned, spitting at your master.  Rowan responded by creating and unfolding his demonic wings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monster isn&#39;t correct.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;Demon is the word you&#39;re looking for.&quot;  Rowan&#39;s laughing became maniacal as the knights tried to flee.  However, an unseen force was blocking the way out.  &quot;Don&#39;t bother trying to escape.  You&#39;re not leaving this place alive.&quot;  Rowan held up his hand, and let the blue ring glow.  Immediately, the warlock turned to face his comrades, and held his hands towards them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on!&quot;  The warlock yelled.  &quot;What is happening!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m controlling you.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;Ready to kill your friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot;  The warlock screamed as he was forced to shoot a bolt of white energy at the knights.  They were fried to a crisp by it.  &quot;Why would you do this?&quot;  The warlock cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh.&quot;  Rowan responded.  &quot;I felt like it.&quot;  To end the ordeal, Rowan released the warlock from his control, before brutally destroying his body with a black bolt of lightning.  &quot;How was that performance?&quot;  Rowan yelled to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d give it a 6 out of 10.  Could use more effects and drama.&quot;  You laughed, finishing off your knight snack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  My manipulation magic is good, but I need to work on my theatrics.&quot;  Rowan laughed as he flew next to you.  &quot;How was your snack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit too much metal, but otherwise yummy.&quot;  You laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for the rest of the day?&quot;  Rowan asked, petting your dragon head, which was resting on his lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course master.&quot;  You smiled evilly, ready for what was to come.<br />
<br />
