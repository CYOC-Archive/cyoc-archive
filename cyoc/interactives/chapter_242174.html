<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah McMillan stood a ways away outside of the Moreland home looking a little nervous. She stood next to her mother, Queen Glitter, of the fae, both them were in their human forms and wore business casual clothing for this meeting.<br />
<br />
Just the day before, her successor, Hailey, had sent word to her that Nina Moreland wished to reconcile with her on the matter of Connor and the Tepes family since it had been discovered that the Tepes family truly weren&#39;t behind the attack that crippled Connor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, take your time. I&#39;m right here with you.&quot; Glitter said to her daughter putting a reassuring hand on Sarah&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Sarah was grateful when she asked her mother if she would come with her for support. Despite the years long case finally being solved, the day that Nina came into S.P.E.A.R, smacked her in her face and shouted at her to stay away from her children was always in the back of her mind. Sarah had come to view the Morelands as friends and after Jacob died, and Nina cut ties with her, she felt she had lost some good friends for years. Now they could finally make amends with each other.<br />
<br />
Sarah now took a deep breath and went up to the door with her mother following closely behind her. Sarah knocked on the door and was a little surprised to see Connor Moreland standing on the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there, glad you could make it.&quot; Connor said with a warm smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor? I...I&#39;m surprised to see you here. I...I had just thought I would be meeting with your mother.&quot; Sarah said surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you are, but I told my wife that she should also hear you out as she&#39;s held some disdain from you ever since....well....this.&quot; Connor said motioning toward his cane.<br />
<br />
&quot;But anyway, come on in, my kids are going to love meeting you, especially the little ones. Kids come out here, the queen and princess are here.&quot; Connor called out as Connor&#39;s children all came out with Nina and Spark following closely behind them, Nina was carrying Colton and set him down to walk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kids, this is Queen Glitter and her daughter, Princess Sarah, or Sarathea, I guess that&#39;s her fairy name.&quot; Connor said as Kaida didn&#39;t seem too impressed with the two while Jay and Cali looked amazed and Colton looked curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you the really the queen of the fairies?&quot; Cali asked with a big smile on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am. Let me show you some magic while your mother and grandmother talk with my daughter.&quot; Gale said as the kids and Connor followed Gale into another part of the house where Gale could show the kids her fairy form and magic.<br />
<br />
Sarah, Nina, and Spark were left standing there now feeling a bit awkward as Nina directed Sarah into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Care for tea?&quot; Nina asked asked as Sarah quietly nodded.<br />
<br />
The three women all had a cup of tea in the kitchen as Sarah just barely drank out of her cup and Nina and Spark remained silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Nina finally said to Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, Nina, please don&#39;t be sorry I&#39;m the one who should be...&quot; Sarah began to say before Nina held up her hand and put her cup down before taking a big exhale.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had just lost Jacob, Connor got crippled, you holding Caleb at gun point was my breaking point. My entire world was crumbling around me, and I directed all my anger at you because even I at the time thought that the vampires were to blame. But now we know they were never to blame.&quot; Nina said towards Sarah.<br />
<br />
Nina then continued as Sarah and Spark listened. &quot;As I&#39;ve gotten older, I&#39;ve come to realize that you were in an impossible situation, you couldn&#39;t take sides and had to wait for any hard evidence to come. Then I came and had most of your information Jacob had given you taken away. I know you recovered, but I&#39;m still sorry for what I did then and I&#39;m sorry for how I lashed out at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nina, you have nothing to apologize for. If I had a child and I thought vampires had hurt them, I would be just as angry as you were then. I felt so guilty about not being able to solve Connor&#39;s attack, I understand where you were coming from. How am I supposed to say I understand when you lost so much. You blamed me but I blamed myself even more.&quot; Sarah gave a deep sigh before setting her cup down on the counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Working within the supernatural world is never easy and we never know when we&#39;ll lose someone, like a friend. I learned that the hard way too many times. But I would like to have my friend again.&quot; Sarah said holding out her arms towards Nina as she gave her a smile in return and the two embraced in a hug as friends once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark, anything you want to say to Sarah?&quot; Nina asked her daughter in-law who crossed her arms and was looking away for a minute before looking back at Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess....I guess thinking about it, I never really held a grudge against you. Maybe I was just angry at you because because no one was brought to justice for Connor&#39;s injuries. I watched the love of my life struggle for years and put on a brave face for him because I felt helpless to do anything. It was just so easy for me to blame you rather than who was really at fault for what happened with Connor and that&#39;s unfair.&quot; Spark said to Sarah.<br />
<br />
Spark now looked towards where Connor was with his children and Glitter and gave a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;But....I think I also underestimated my Connor&#39;s resilience. Like is brother and father before him, he never knows when to quit. That&#39;s what I love about him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I guess you don&#39;t want a hug?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Handshake?&quot; Spark suggested holding out her hand as she and Sarah shook hands.<br />
<br />
The three women now looked towards the living room now as Glitter/Gale was showing Spark&#39;s children her fairy form and some of her magic. Spark noticed that even her oldest daughter, Kaida, was impressed by the fairy queen&#39;s display. Seeing her daughter as happy as her youngest was always something she loved to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I just remembered. Your son visited me in the fae realm with Andromeda Tepes of all people, and I can certainly say I was surprised to see the two together. How on earth did that happen?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, let me pour you some more tea before I start. This is going to be a long one, it&#39;s a pretty wild story.&quot; Nina said with a chuckle as Spark and Sarah listened to Nina tell the story of how the son of a demon hunter fell in love with the daughter of the vampire lord.</p>
