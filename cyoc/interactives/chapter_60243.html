<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite coming to grips with his newfound power it was still too overwhelming. He felt smothered in his own room -- barely able to catch his breath. He got dressed and headed out, avoiding Mark and June downstairs in the kitchen, and quietly let himself out the front door. Nobody even noticed him.<br />
<br />
Ty walked. To the end of the street at first, then to the end of the next block. Then several streets down. He barely noticed how far he'd gone as his mind swirled with moral dilemmas, possibilities, and dangers. At last, exhausted, he sat down on a bench in a green city park and watched the people go by.<br />
<br />
Then suddenly something caught his eye. Several feet away on the bike path was a tall attractive brunette woman. She was out for a jog, dressed in shape hugging athletic wear, and was lost in her work out as she exerted herself.<br />
<br />
She paused for a moment next a tree, panting, and leaned against it before breaking into a pained sob. Ty blinked at this sight and rose from the bench, curious as to why she was crying. Power or not, he probably would have approached her anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, ma'am?&quot; Ty asked shyly, pushing his ill fitting glasses up on his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Y-Yes?&quot; The brunette turned, drying her eyes quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was sitting over there and saw you crying. Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded quickly, and offered a weak smile. &quot;Uh, yes, young man. Thank you. Just being really emotional I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty wondered why absently, and was suddenly assaulted with a flash of mental visions. This woman's husband had been cheating on her for five years with a young sexy thing, thought she didn't know, and told her she should go work her flabby ass out so she'd be more attractive to him. So here she was. She was in so much pain. Just... running. To try and get her head on straight. Figure out what she was going to do.<br />
<br />
Ty could relate, and was about to ask something else, but the woman was already back on the path. Ty wished he could have talked to her and sighed sadly, walking away with the woman's wallet in his hand.<br />
<br />
Startled, he realized what had happened and turned suddenly. &quot;Uh...? Miss?&quot; Ty called. &quot;You dropped your wallet!&quot;<br />
<br />
The brunette stopped in her tracks, patted her side in alarm, and turned back with an blushing smile. &quot;Oh, wow! Thanks, kiddo! I'd hate to lose that!&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood in front of him to take her wallet back and Ty shook his head. Her husband was an idiot. She was a beautiful woman. He could help her. He *wanted* to help her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you checking me out?&quot; The brunette raised an eyebrow with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Ty gulped as he snapped out of his daydream and stared up at her. &quot;Uh... no!&quot; He was not convincing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So did you lift my wallet, then, just so you could get me to come back for a second look?&quot; She put her hand on her hip and looked at him sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Ty sighed, then smiled. &quot;Miss, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. So I'll just show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at him curiously but played along. &quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here.&quot; Ty held out out wallet again and saw her jaw drop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; She patted her pocket again and burst out laughing. &quot;You little thief! How did you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
He handed her wallet back and smiled as she put it in her pocket. She raised a finger to him and was about to rather half-heartedly scold him, when he held out her wallet again. This time her jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-That's impossible!&quot; She gaped, staring at her wallet once again in his hand. &quot;You didn't even move!&quot; She stared at him a moment more and blinked. &quot;Is this a set-up? Am I on a hidden camera show or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite.&quot; Ty grinned. Now for the coup de grace. She took her wallet back a fourth time, rather freaked out, and Ty didn't even wait for it to reach her pocket. He made it vanish out of her hand right in front of her eyes and appear in his own. He held it up again and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... how did you...&quot; She went oddly silent and went pale.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Ty handed it back to her shaking hand. &quot;So, yes, I was checking you out. Because I think your husband's an idiot. But I didn't steal your wallet. At least, not intentionally.&quot;<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
They sat at a picnic table in the park. Some conversation had taken place and the woman had introduced herself as Michelle. She was 32 years old, an even six foot tall, and was absolutely fascinated by the young God who had taken her wallet with a mere thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... it just kind of happened?&quot; She asked, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Ty nodded, clapping his hands together for effect. &quot;Poof, I wake up and I can do whatever I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Michelle looked at him with a grin. &quot;So... prove it. Do something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like... what?&quot; Ty blinked, not sure what she wanted him to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know!&quot; She laughed. &quot;You're the God! Be creative!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; He smirked. &quot;Creative, it is.&quot; He wished her jogging suit would disapear and she'd be sitting in her underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you do something?&quot; Michelle blinked, looking down in confusion before letting out a squeel of public humiliation as she looked down and saw her matching pink bra and panties and not much else. &quot;Ty! Jesus!&quot;<br />
<br />
The 15 year old chuckled and willed her clothes back. &quot;Was that good enough, miss?&quot;<br />
<br />
She blinked as her clothes were suddenly back and nodded. &quot;Uh-huh!&quot; She smiled at him and shook her head in shock. &quot;This... this is so cool. Seriously. So you can do whatever you want? Anything? No limits?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so. I haven't really used it much.&quot; Ty admitted. &quot;I'm kind of scared to. What if I hurt somebody, or... or... do something bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, like remove an older woman's clothes?&quot; She giggled, then turned serious. &quot;Well, what if there's nobody else in the world who can do what you can? What if you can help people? Or make the world better for someone? That's worth using it for, isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I suppose so.&quot; Ty smiled. &quot;I hadn't thought of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go!&quot; Michelle patted his head excitedly. &quot;Like... wanting to make me feel better. Well, you sure did!&quot; She realized what she said and blushed a little. Ty blushed back and they exchanged a look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change me.&quot; She whispered. &quot;I want to feel what it's like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Ty whispered back, looking around nervously. &quot;Here? Now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; She grabbed his hands excitedly and grinned. &quot;Let me help you figure out what you can do! Come on, it'll be wild!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Ty smiled wide. &quot;Let's do this.&quot;</p>
