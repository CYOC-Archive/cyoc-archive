<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Heh, hah! Down, Stolz!” Sydney giggled, the nine-year-old boy in a blonde bob-cut tried his best to bat the Dobermann Pinscher away to keep him from jumping. But with his hands full, it didn’t work.<br />
<br />
The huge 3-year-old guard dog came close to toppling him over as he excitedly leapt up on two legs, propping himself on the boy’s shoulders. Sydney gasped as he felt the heavy mass of dog muscle pressing on top him, the dog standing a whole head taller than the young boy as that long, drooly tongue lashed along his scalp, painting Sydney’s hair in a sheen of canine drool.<br />
<br />
“Down, I said down!” He squeaked in an exasperated gasp, the canine quickly dropping off his perch, landing on two legs after hearing his young master commanding him an anxious tone. The ordeal left Sydney wheezing, the boy adjusting his steamed-up glasses that almost toppled off the edge of his nose. His chest heaved as he grasped the package he’d just picked up from the front door in his hands. Stolz sat there on his haunches, looking empathetically upwards towards the little boy.<br />
<br />
Stolz was a good dog, even if he got carried away sometimes. Afterall, he had to be spirited to be guard dog, and since Sydney’s parents were always busy with work and business trips, the boy had to rely in Stolz for company during the weekdays. It was almost always just him and Stolz in their big, empty house.<br />
<br />
“Now you sit tight down here.” The boy pointed at the floor to order the dog to stay. “I’ve got a surprise for the birthday dog! I’ve gotta head upstairs for a bit, but I should be right back down in a couple of minutes when the surprise is ready!”<br />
<br />
The dog tilted his head like a confused puppy dog, not understanding that last bit of human speech after being told to stay. The guard dog had extensive training knowing all sorts of commands, but rarely was he told to wait, if anything, Stolz would always follow Sydney around, keeping an extra close eye on him for protection.<br />
<br />
Still, the Dobermann obediently sat in place as his young owner ran up the stairs into his room, package in hand. At first, the boy closed the door behind him, but he remembered he really ought to keep it cracked open so he could get back out. After all, he wouldn’t be able to open doors for a while very soon!<br />
<br />
Sydney tore open the small shipping box, digging through the brown paper casing to reveal a leather collar with who else but his name affixed to the dog tag. He held it in his hand, palpating that smooth, tanned cowhide in his fingers, a tinge of nervous excitement shooting up through his arms as he spotted an instruction slip in the box.<br />
<br />
“To use, wear collar around neck, change lasts for approximately three hours before normal form is regained. Remove collar and place around neck anew to repeat process.” Sydney repeated the text from the short manual aloud, a little diagram showing the collar being affixed to a human’s neck, leaving some breathing room. An arrow connected panel one to the second, showing nothing else but a dog wearing the collar.<br />
<br />
It was almost comical how bluntly it described what it did, just like the ad he saw for it online on TikTok. As described, it turned you into a dog just for a little while. Other kids were posting all sorts of silly videos of themselves doing fun stuff during their time as dogs on the app. Watching all those videos in his chauffeur’s car on the ride home from school made Sydney imagine what it’d be like to play with Stolz on his own level, for Stolz to play with a dog just like himself that’d be able to keep up with all that doggy energy of his.<br />
<br />
Sydney was always sad he could never properly play with Stolz. He was always the scrawny, nerdy type of kid that had asthma, so any sort of prolonged running was just out of the question for him. Heck, even throwing a tennis ball around for Stolz to catch always left him feeling so winded he’d have to sit down. But dogs didn’t get asthma, and if he was a dog, he could finally give his favorite friend in the whole world the fun time he deserved. It would be the best birthday gift ever!<br />
<br />
“Warning.” Sydney’s voice hushed with some concern, his reverie in thinking about all the fun they’d have starting to shrink as he read the side effects. “Intercourse may extend period of change with increasing intervals each time. Mental state may change. Refrain from intercourse or simply remove collar to change back.”<br />
<br />
The boy’s face scrunched up a little, not understanding entirely what “intercourse” meant. At his age, girls had just recently become a passing interest for him, and since his mom and dad were rarely around to get to tell him about the birds and the bees, he was still naïve to sex. If there was one thing he did know, it was that he couldn’t stay a dog for more than a few hours. He had school in the morning and had to get up early to keep his flawless attendance record pristine. Also, if his parents came home to see he’d turned himself into a dog, they’d throw a fit!<br />
<br />
He wasn’t scared though. Stolz always obeyed him at least after a few commands, if he did anything that’d make him stay a dog for too long, he’d could just tell Stolz to stop so he could change back. When it came to his best friend, he knew he didn’t have anything to worry about!<br />
<br />
Without any delay, he unlatched the collar, pressing the cool, black leather to his neck. He fed the end through the loop and latched it into place like a belt, giving it a few fingers worth of give just to make sure he didn’t inadvertently choke himself. Sydney let out a calm grin once it was done, the feeling of that collar around his neck oddly soothing, the cool leather starting to heat up ever so slightly as the boy held out his hands, awaiting the changes.<br />
<br />
Sydney heard his heartbeat quicken inside his chest, anticipation building like he was in a roller-coaster, slowly getting pulled a hundred feet in the air, getting closer to a climactic drop off. The boy couldn’t see any change yet, but he could feel something, a tingling at his joints, a tickle starting to form at the tips of his toes and fingers like a 4th of July Sparkler that had just been lit. His Adam’s apple nudged against the collar as he gulped, mind racing as a weird numbness started to race along his limbs, a burst of pins-and-needles flaring like goosebumps along his muscles as they started to tense up.<br />
<br />
“Aughh!” A hot puff of air leapt from his mouth as it suddenly felt too full to carry his own tongue! It burst out, drool spattering the boy’s Dogwood Elementary T-shirt as that long canid licker lolled out between his lips, nose creaking forward as it conspicuously stared to obstruct his view of his hands.<br />
<br />
His hands. With that lengthening snout starting to form, he almost didn’t catch that sleeve of dark fuzz enveloping his arms and wrists. A prairie fire of fur grew up towards his hands, emitting a faint glow like he was actually set ablaze as his flesh turned from a pale beige to an animalistic black.<br />
<br />
Ancient, primal worry reared up from inside him as he saw what was being wrought along his human form. Needless to say, it was disconcerting to see those hand he’d always been able to look down on started to creak and gnarl, digits shortening as a sock of brown doggy fuzz overtook them. Paw pads swelling from his palms like soft callouses and tiny claws dotting his fingertips professed that his humanity was dwindling. His opposable thumbs crackled like they was about to explode, the appendages shooting down his wrist like bullets to form a small dewclaws on each arm close to the shoulder. His arms were no longer arms but legs, unable to do the things that made humans human, those precious hands that separated him from animals fit for little more than holding up a dog on all fours.<br />
<br />
A bead of sweat boiled down Syney’s neck, sizzling against the collar as that smile on the boy’s lips wavered, distorting as his face pushed out, becoming even more bestial.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it was just like a roller-coaster. Not only the anticipation of nearing towards the top but the fear too. It was a pit-of-your-stomach sort of fear, mind rehearsing over and over how something so marvelous could even exist, how such a structure didn’t collapse or hurl its riders right off the top plummeting towards the ground. Now that he’d trusted the collar and got on the “ride”, would it really do what it said it would? Would it be really painful and would it really change him back to human once it was through? Now that he lost his last lifeline to getting that collar off – now that his hands were dog’s paws, he was strapped in for the whole thing, no turning back now.<br />
<br />
Sydney staggered forward. The canid smile hanging from his thinning lips turned into a queasy groan, the changing boy hugging his paws to his chest the best he could as he felt his spine begin to arch him forward. He hiked his shirt off as he fought the urge to vomit. Another harsh snap from his backbone almost knocked him onto all fours if he didn’t have his bed to prop himself up on, the skin on his chest and belly boating out here and there like something was crawling underneath.<br />
<br />
His stomach churned. Everything was churning. As his ears poked up, stretching into dark-fuzzed, membranous daggers, he heard viscera slithering across organs like raw, slimy meat, some exchanging places, other bloating bigger or shrinking as they betrayed human needs to serve a dog’s. His innards reminded him of that hated mystery stew in a big metal pot they’d serve at his school’s cafeteria, all sorts of bit and pieces of flesh whirling around in a big vat, steaming a sickly savory smoke. Indeed, the boy’s very skin starting to steam just like that stew, more dog hide overtaking his feeble human skin, leaving him with more fur than bare-naked flesh.<br />
<br />
Sydney braced himself. It was going to come, it was that same anticipation of pain he waited for when a doctor was giving him a flu shot. The needle was going to come, a sharp pain that’d leave him wailing and crying and sputtering on the floor like a baby in sheer agony!<br />
<br />
Why did he even do this? Why did he so casually think he could just lose his humanity!? Although it didn’t hurt yet, it was unimaginable his entire body would devolve into a dog’s without the pain, that he wouldn’t feel the inevitable nerves snapping and bones breaking. It had to come… he held his tongue in his longer maw as waited and waited and waited…<br />
<br />
“AuugghhH!” Sydney spat out, teeth sharpening as drool gushed out of his maw, head starting to spin. He wheezed violently like he was suffering an asthma attack, but strangely, he didn’t feel like he was choking on his own throat like he usually did. His new heart raced; his new lungs let him gasp all he wanted without restriction as his hazey mind urged his paw down under the hem of his Khakis, sensing something had happened down there.<br />
<br />
Glue? It looked like it. It got all over his paws, forming thick webs between his feral digits. His pants suddenly slipped off his waist and down his legs as his hips scrunched up into canid flanks. Seizing the moment, his spine lunged out from his underwear into a short tail, the appendage bulking up in blackish fuzz before starting to wag. Exhilaration and pleasure suddenly forced aside fear as another splotch of white cream bashed against the hem of his undies, his second orgasm ever splattering across the carpeted floor below.<br />
<br />
He felt it now. He’d reached the top of the roller-coaster. Now everything felt like it was rocketing forward at breakneck speeds!<br />
<br />
That needle he was expecting came, but it didn’t hurt. Pain and fear abated, euphoria brimming in its place as his mind filled with it like an overflowing cup, his tongue lolling out from sheer elation as a dopey canid smile firmed up on his new muzzle. Sydney’s human dick rolled against the soft touch of his paws as the boy fought with his new anatomy to masturbate, those pads sensually rubbing against his dick like plush pillows, urging more tiny pumps of goo to leak all over them.<br />
<br />
His butt waggled along with his tail, underwear awkwardly grasping along his bestial hips as bones shortened. His legs bowed forward into digitigrade appendages as the same fate that eliminated his hands threatened to turn his foot into paws! Sydney couldn’t care less about that though. He lifted both paws to his muzzle as he awkwardly fought to stay up on two hindlegs, that long tongue lavishing steaming hot licks along his paw pads as he tasted that salty eruption of boy jizz his change had forced out. That long canine licker dug between his digits, suckling in between his claws as the spicey flavor of hot boy juice hummed in harmony with his shifting body. Sydney was no longer afraid of losing his human form. Instead, he wondered why he was worried about it in the first place!<br />
<br />
The ticks and crackles working down his bottom half felt like a massage, invisible hands petting on top and underneath his skin as his short tail happily whipped faster and faster a top his butt. Inside his socks his soles shortened into strong paws, his new claws digging through his socks and clutching the ground as Sydney tried to dip his paws back down to nurse even more cum from his flaccid boy dick, but that’d be his undoing.<br />
<br />
Any semblance of a human gait was lost as soon as his legs finished their changes, his lumbar snapping like a broken wishbone as Sydney found himself flung onto all fours! His doped-up human-dog brain sputtered in confusion, legs trembling as the boy’s mind registered it as a bear crawl, Sydney taking a few confused steps forwards before toppling face first on the carpeted floor!<br />
<br />
Splayed out on his side, Sydney didn’t spare a moment to think. On instinct, he hiked a long in the air, his muzzle shooting towards his groin only to see the tip of his cut human cock oozing out one last dribble of semen before his glans suddenly slipped into a tube of dark doggy flesh like it was slipping into a turtleneck sweater. Sydney’s head tilted in confusion just like Stolz’s did earlier, the changing boy hardly recognizing what his penis slipped into at first, in fact, it all looked so different now.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d caught the last of his changes as his eyes began to mix red and greens into grayish hues. The last peach-colored patches of fragile human skin along his belly were burned in that transformational glow, charred into black doggy hide as it completed its full takeover of his body. His belly abruptly barreled outwards, over-so-tiny nubs of vestigial doggy nips push out as they dotted the sides of his belly. His rib caged completed, crackling into something more cylindrical as his body took on that fur-torpedo shape that most working dog breeds had – the sort of shape that Stolz had.<br />
<br />
If Sydney didn’t know any better, he’d swear he was looking down over top Stolz. It was the same view he’d see falling asleep on the big Dobermann’s side as the two lay in bed together. It felt like home, a familiar warmth thrumming to life inside him telling him it was always supposed to be this way, that he was in the right place now – that he was home.<br />
<br />
The reassuring thought confused him, his human-self trying to reassert what he’d always been while his canine-self convincingly lured him deeper within, the feeling of the strong feral body containing his soul difficult to withstand. The two minds, human and bestial, wrestled inside just like he and Stolz would sometimes roll around and play-fight with each other. Whenever they played, Stolz would always win in the end.<br />
<br />
The dull, animal bliss washed over him like a warm blanket, that dark Dobermann hide beginning to emit a tingly musk that made its wearer fall even deeper in love with it. Sydney licked over his belly, muzzle stroking and nipping that sensitive hide while even a nudging a few doggy nipples as he lazily lapped his way to his new cock holster. Inside his penis was cocooned in sheath goop, a sharp-smelling, raunchy stench emanated from the moist tip of that fuzzy tube. Since he’d been circumcised from the day he was born, he was never used to his cock being so moist and sensitive… but now it felt better than ever. Sydney’s long tongue lashed across it before digging inside, the Dobermann kissing his soaking wet penis caged within as his drool squelched inside that fleshy tube of doggy sheath.<br />
<br />
Sydney’s short tail lashed lazily against the floor. His mind felt just like that sheath goop, warm, dull, and overflowing with bestial love as Sydney worshipped the doggy sheath. He licked it, nipped it, and kissed it before a tender growl erupted from the new dog’s throat. Sydney suddenly bit down hard on sheath, eyes clenching to tight screws as his soft human dick came or pissed or… did something. Warmth piled up inside as his penis stewed in its own lust. Deep within, it started to jerk around, his penis gaining a permanent erection as a baculum ossified inside. That spongy human flesh turned into hard, sensitive muscle as a red-pink sheen of glossy flesh stained that changing organ.<br />
<br />
Sydney couldn’t stand it, the dog’s head springing back to his front as he howled, piss and cum leaking from that sheath of his as the contents continued to change, a firm bulge inside growing fatter and girthier. His mind having accepted his caninehood, Sydney leapt up onto all fours without any issue, like he’d been walking on four legs all his life.<br />
<br />
The Dobermann began pacing the room skittishly before hiking up a leg, letting a little spurt of acrid doggy piss stain foot of his dresser, then his bed, then one of his pillow he’d tossed on the floor earlier this morning. Pissing felt so good. Marking things felt even better too, the air in the room getting steamy with the smell of his own scent. Each whiff of air made him proud and horny at the same time, the newly made dog barking and whining in between bouts of pissing as his dick started to emerge from his sheath looking nothing like it had before!<br />
<br />
As soon as the pink lip-stick like protrusion of doggy meat met the air, Sydney’s hips began rocking against nothing at all. His tail wagged desperately as a puppy-like horniness washed over the former-boy, Sydney tripping back on all fours until he tripped over the piss-soaked pillow he’d marked several times in the last three minutes!<br />
<br />
He clutched it in his forepaws, clamping his maw around it in a love bite as his hips jammed it with cock. Sizzling hot doggy pride kissed against the soft, satiny white fabric of the pillow, the stuffing inside getting bunched around it as the cotton pillowcase adhered to Sydney’s sopping wet cock tip. The Dobermann hammered away at it as it made out with his new maleness, jolts of canine ecstasy electrocuting his feral mind, forcing spurts of newly made dog jizz all over his inanimate lover.<br />
<br />
Steaming, hot puffs of air growling out of Sydney’s muzzle began to sink underneath the sloppy sound of pillow masturbating his cock. Humanity dipped to the wayside, any shame his parents instilled in him thrust away as he humped the pillow like a puppy dog. His mind ebbed away into bestial bliss as he yipped and howled, waves of cum shooting from his dick as a girthy, golf-ball-sized mass of doggy knot swelled to life inside the tight confines of his sheath.<br />
<br />
Wave after wave, spurt and spurt of cum geysered from his dick as all thoughts in his mind shrank down to a single mantra.<br />
<br />
Good dog. Good dog.<br />
<br />
The simple words he’d uttered to Stolz time and time again made him orgasm just thinking them. He wanted to be good. He wanted to be a good dog. That sliver of humanity that clutched to the recesses of his mind was still able to form the phrase and it was enough to send his dog-self into a flurry of rutting at the mere thought of being praised!<br />
<br />
It went until his cum saturated the pillow and puddled onto the floor. Sydney managed to stutter a few steps away from his inanimate partner before toppling face-first onto the floor, panting for breath as he laid on his side. His penis still leaked musky doggy cum as it kept drooling out little spurts of his new virility, his mind lost in a fog of bliss as his tongue lolled out onto the carpet, Sydney happy and content as a dog could be.<br />
<br />
“Eeeeppp…”<br />
<br />
The door creaked open. He wasn’t alone.<br />
<br />
His human mind recapitulated, taking the reins from his canine euphoria as Sydney wretched his head towards the door, fearing his parents came home early and saw all of that!<br />
<br />
But no, he should have known; his parents were never around. It was just Stolz. If the sound of a dog howling from growling didn’t urge him to disobey the “stay” command Sydney had given him, the smell of feral sex certainly would have.<br />
<br />
Stolz stood half-way into the room, the two dogs’ ears perched towards each other as Sydney wondered what was going on in his pet’s head… whether Stolz knew it was him.<br />
<br />
“I-It’s me…” Sydney tried to tell Stolz in English, his dog-tag jingling on his collar as he growled out the words in a canid whine.<br />
<br />
“It’s me. I just wanted to play…” the new dog tried to reassure Stolz, hoping the other dog would understand he was Sydney, that he was his master. “…I really want to play with you.”</p>
