<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Heather resisted the urge to smile as she was led to the courthouse.  Although the proceedings of the trial were private, the location of the courthouse was well known.  A huge crowd had gathered, anxiously awaiting her arrival.  They immediately began to boo loudly as she exited the big armored transport and walked up the courthouse steps, flanked by two very large members of the Rhino guard.  An additional two guards walked in front and behind her, all carrying shock batons with a very high charge, while more members worked hard to keep the hostile crowd under control.  Although Heather mostly saw angry faces, she saw a few signs of support and even an offer to be her mate.<br />
<br />
Strange, thought Heather as she looked at her small collection of admirers. But I guess even serial killers have fans.  I think Manson even married one of his groupies.<br />
<br />
She strained to raise one of her clawed hands to wave to them.  Her hands were  weighed down by the heavy custom shackles that had been built for her, but that didn&#39;t stop her from trying.  <br />
<br />
And that was when the tomato hit her, right on the tip of her snout.  The vegetable was rotten and the smell made her nauseous. She turned and snarled at her attacker.  The Rhino guards immediately charged their batons, the loud hum almost inaudible over the shouts of the mob.  Heather backed down, turned her head and continued to peacefully walk forward. That didn&#39;t satisfy the crowd, however, who began to throw more rotten fruits and vegetables.  Heather remained stoic and walked with her head held high as the crowd threw more trash at her.  When rocks were added to the collection of projectiles, the Rhino guard rushed her inside to the safety of the courthouse atrium.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Waiting inside with a scowl on his face was Heather&#39;s attorney, Joseph Krantz. He held a large towel in his hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing, Heather?&quot; he asked kindly.  &quot;I know we talked about it, even expected this kind of reaction.  But it is always different when you actually have to experience it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
Joseph offered the towel to Heather.  She gratefully took it and tried to wipe off her snout. But her shackles made it difficult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gentlemen, are those really necessary?&quot; asked Joseph.<br />
<br />
&quot;They stay on until she is returned to confinement, just as ordered,&quot; said one of the Rhino guard gruffly.  &quot;You can clean her yourself, but I won&#39;t lift a finger to help her.  If it weren&#39;t my job to protect her, I would probably be out there with the protestors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what an excellent job you are doing, &quot; said Joseph sarcastically as he ran the towel along the scales of Heather&#39;s body.  &quot;You should be commended for your efforts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s alive, isn&#39;t she?&quot; huffed the Rhino guard. &quot;Look, buddy, given the situation, I think we did the best we could. But if you think you can do any better, you are welcome to try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph ignored him and looked up at Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ready to do this?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Heather nodded her head.  Joseph held onto her hand and led her into the courtroom.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The courtroom was practically empty.  At the front sat the judge high on his podium, a stenographer seated below him.  A human bailiff leaned against the wall, looking pitifully small compared to the members of the Rhino guard that flanked Heather. The prosecutor sat at the left hand side of the court.  Behind him in the gallery sat a handful of very well-dressed men, women and Animalians, representatives of their respective governments.  Heather was not surprised to see the man in dark glasses that had spoken to her among them. <br />
<br />
Heather took her position with her attorney on the right side of the court.  After the judges sat down, the rest of the courtroom followed suit.  Heather had to sit on the floor.  They did not have time to arrange to have a seat big enough to accommodate her large, bulky body.  But even sitting on the floor her head towered above her attorney.  She had to lean down to communicate with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Mr. Krantz.  I have reviewed your appeal regarding the jury and I am ready to make a judgment about your client&#39;s request to be judged by her &#39;peers&#39;, &quot; began the judge.<br />
<br />
Heather smiled.  It had been a clever tactic.  At least Heather thought so.  Under the guidelines of the Constitution, citizens had the right to a trial by a jury of their peers.  Heather and her attorney had argued that her peers would have to be humans uplifted by the Animalian virus, just like she had been.  Heather had gambled that the court would not be able to locate enough Animalians to fill the jury box, at least not enough that were old enough to participate in the trial.  Most of the Animalians she had seen were just children, not old enough to vote, much less serve on a jury.  It didn&#39;t matter which way the court ruled.  The procedure alone would have bought her enough time to escape.  But now that the fool Jeremy had confessed, it was pointless.<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t be necessary, your honor,&quot; said Joseph.  &quot;My client has agreed to a plea deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
The judge looked perturbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why wasn&#39;t the court notified?&quot; asked the judge.<br />
<br />
&quot;We just reached an agreement a few hours ago, your honor,&quot; said the prosecutor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see that,&quot; said the judge.<br />
<br />
The prosecutor handed him the document. He read over the papers.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you agree to this?  To all of it?&quot; asked the judge.<br />
<br />
Heather was about to speak when Joseph held up his hand to stop her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do have one more stipulation.  My client wants the record to show that she is not Heather Wilcox.  She contends that she is someone else, and that the real Heather Wilcox died in Costa Rica.  She feels it is not fair to besmirch an innocent girl&#39;s name, for her family&#39;s sake,&quot; said Joseph.<br />
<br />
The man with dark sunglasses leaned forward and whispered into the prosecutor&#39;s ear.  He frowned a little, but finally nodded his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your honor, the federal government has no problem with that.  We will concede that we cannot prove she is Heather Wilcox.  But we must have some name to use for the record.  How does she wish to be known?&quot; said the prosecutor.<br />
<br />
Heather whispered into Joseph&#39;s ear.  His head bobbed up and down as he listened to her, nodding.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Your honor, my client would simply like to be known as Heather.  She says that there are several other animals with just one name.  She has agreed to take on a last name if another uplifted dinosaur named Heather ever comes forward,&quot; said Joseph.<br />
<br />
A few of the government representatives chuckled.  The judge slammed down the gavel hard on the wood of his desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Order! Order!  Quiet or I will clear this room!  I don&#39;t care how well connected you are,&quot; said the judge.<br />
<br />
The courtroom grew silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, Heather - do you agree to plead guilty to all charges against you, as laid out in your plea agreement?&quot; asked the judge.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do, your honor,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, by the power vested in me by the Federal Government,  Heather, I find you guilty by reason of insanity.  Do you want to say anything in your defense before I pass sentence?&quot; asked the judge.<br />
<br />
Joseph held up his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;My client wishes to forgo her right to speak.  But she would like to bring out a few witnesses to speak on her behalf,&quot; said Joseph.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no objection, your honor,&quot; said the prosecutor.<br />
<br />
The first witness was well known and not much of a surprise.   Dr. Gert Addams was a respected although controversial neuroscientist from Germany.  He had been spent years studying brain abnormalities and their effect on behavior in humans and animals.  He had published several papers and even a book that was received very well by the public.  When the Animalians first appeared, he quickly shifted his focus of study.  To him, Heather was a real prize, a unique opportunity to further his studies and prove his theories.  He jumped at the chance to examine her when he got a late night visit from a mysterious man in dark sunglasses.<br />
<br />
Dr. Addams gleefully presented the results of his findings, like a child explaining his favorite television show to an adult.  The judge only understood a handful of what he was saying (the full results of his study would be published in a scientific journal less than a year after the trial).  But the judge got the gist of his rambling lecture - Heather&#39;s brain was altered by her transformation, making her more aggressive. The judge really only had one question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can this aggression be controlled? Or will she always be violent due to the changes in her brain?&quot; asked the judge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything is possible,&quot; said Dr. Addams in a thick German accent.  &quot;Even the most vicious animal can be taught to behave with the right training.  And Heather has the benefit of human intelligence and reasoning.  With time, I believe she could control her urges and be a productive member of society.  If she chooses to ... and if you give her the opportunity.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few more &#39;experts&#39; testified, a collection of psychologists, psychiatrists, and even some animal behavioral research scientists, each discussing similar ideas.  No friends or family stepped forward to testify.  Effie was notably absent.<br />
<br />
But there was one person who was truly a &#39;surprise witness&#39;.  The judge cleared the courtroom to protect her identity.  Only the judge, the prosecutor, Heather and her attorney were allowed to hear her statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you state your name for the record?&quot; asked Joseph.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my name is Sophie....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophie, the court appreciates your bravery.  It takes a lot of courage to face your attacker.  But your testimony isn&#39;t necessary.  The violent nature of the crime has been well-documented with video footage from the drones as well as other witness statements. I assure you, the court is aware of the severity of Heather&#39;s crime and will punish her accordingly,&quot; said the judge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your honor, I don&#39;t think you understand.  I have come to speak on Heather&#39;s behalf - to plead for mercy,&quot; said Sophie.<br />
<br />
The judge was flabbergasted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you here under duress?  Has anyone threatened you?&quot; asked the judge. He turned to glare at Joseph. &quot;If you have coerced this young lady in any way I swear I will have you disbarred....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, sir. It&#39;s okay,&quot; said Sophie. &quot;No one has threatened or harassed me in any way. I have come of my own free will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, &quot; said the judge.  &quot;Let&#39;s hear what you have to say.  Take your time and if you feel the need to stop....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe Heather is a good person.  I think she was just a little confused.  But with the right help, I think she can be rehabilitated,&quot; said Sophie.<br />
<br />
&quot;But didn&#39;t she attack you?&quot; asked the judge.<br />
<br />
Sophie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it was all a misunderstanding.  And I forgive her.  I do think she should be punished, but I don&#39;t think she should be killed because of her mistake.  I just think she needs help,&quot; said Sophie.<br />
<br />
Sophie continued to speak on Heather&#39;s behalf, much to the shock of the courtroom.  Eventually, the judge excused her and Sophie left the courtroom undetected. The rest of the court staff and gallery visitors returned to the courtroom.<br />
  <br />
&quot;Any other witnesses?&quot; asked the judge.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, your honor,&quot; said Joseph.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well.  Will the defendant please rise?&quot; asked the judge.<br />
<br />
Heather stood up, her head still almost brushing the vaulted ceiling of the courtroom.  If they expected more Animalian defendants, they were going to need to make a few adjustments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heather, I sentence you to confinement to a mental health facility for the rest of your life, or until a team of qualified doctors have determined that it is safe for you to rejoin society.  You will be held at Horizon Labs for treatment until a larger, more adequate facility becomes available. Do you have any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, your honor,&quot; said Heather solemnly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Court is adjourned,&quot; said the judge, slamming down his gavel.</p>
