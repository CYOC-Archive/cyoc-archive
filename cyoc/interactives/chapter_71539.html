<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a full stomach for the moment I continued to help Terri and Night clean up after what was a fairly early dinner. Though, as I made my way in the kitchen, I could smell pieces of jerky, summer sausage, and various deli meats in an igloo on a nearby counter. Despite having just eaten, my eyes drifted to it, as I followed my nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those are there to snack on while we're waiting for moon-rise,&quot; Terri commented as she noticed where I was looking, &quot;You're free to snack on them as we go. I'd even encourage it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; I said nervously, almost sounding ashamed at having been caught.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be sorry,&quot; Terri answered, &quot;it's okay. Night and I will probably be snacking on that too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as good as a real steak, but it's still meat,&quot; Night commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your body is getting ready to change,&quot; Terri added, &quot;just as ours are... but for you, it's your FIRST transformation. You're going to be going through the same period of &quot;training&quot; that I went through. Adapting to new instincts, new impulses, new drives, and a new way of life, including new abilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
I slowly nodded. Terri's call the day before to begin one of our various post-divorce sex-flings had brought about great changes in my life. All of which related personal fantasies of mine. As I thought of that, my mind drifted back to what Terri and Night had told me about their call with their Alpha. He had somehow managed to spy on Terri and I and knew that Terri had bitten me, which according to Night was in disobedience of what their Alpha had told Terri.<br />
<br />
&quot;This guy really spied on us last night?&quot; I asked trying to figure things out, a portion of my mind wanting to hunt the guy down and shred him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He did,&quot; Night nodded, &quot;Which means more bad news and in the long term, all the more reason to leave his Pack and start a new one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He did accept John, though,&quot; Terri pointed out, &quot;we might be able to escape this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure we can escape it,&quot; Night nodded, &quot;but remember, he only accepted John because you had already bitten him. He can't not be a werewolf now. My best guess is that he wants to make sure that John is automatically submissive to him and swears not to have sex with any of his females, and he will likely include you and me among them tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't you say that he'd allow us to have our fun tonight?&quot; I asked, sounding hopeful and slightly aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes we did,&quot; Night nodded, &quot;but that's likely a one night only deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ultimately, you may need to make a request to divide Fangton into two territories,&quot; Night warned, &quot;Darren MIGHT accept that... but he also reserves the right not to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe John could impress the other girls,&quot; Terri offered, &quot;get us a situation where we can out vote him on Pack matters. We can then leave and he can have his harem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but John will need to bulk up a lot in order to do that,&quot; Night told her, &quot;he smells wonderfully sexy as his wolf gets stronger and stronger... but for the moment, his appearance is as he was before you bit him. Darren is built like a tank, even in human form. Solid muscle all around physically attractive to even human eyes. The girls won't support a new wolf like John over Darren right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They might if they don't like being in a harem or separated from men that they love,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but remember, we're hornier then normal people,&quot; Night reminded me, &quot;a normal human male couldn't keep up with our stamina. In time, you'll begin to bulk up simply by being a werewolf, but to able to challenge Darren... or at least attract support from the girls, you'll need to do some serious weight lifting... and considering that he's spying on Terri, that might not even help.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave a low growl at that and felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't like it any more then you, John,&quot; Terri said quickly, &quot;Don't bring your wolf out till it's ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then sighed heavily. A part of me did admit that I never really stopped loving Terri, and I admitted that I divorced her for the stupidest of reasons, but I never remembered feeling so possessive of her or anyone else. I chalked this up to newly forming instincts or some other indicator of what I would turn into in the approaching hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could some one have spied on us?&quot; I asked, &quot;wouldn't you have seen this other werewolf or smelled her? Wouldn't most trees be incapable of supporting your muscle mass in wolf form?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The tree she likely climbed was an old oak tree that is on one of the neighbor's properties,&quot; Terri sighed, &quot;and she'd only need to go up about ten feet or so, so it's not like she was in the upper branches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And there are a few trees in this area that are on a nearby hill that rises above the privacy fence,&quot; Night commented, &quot;normally no one is there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You all know about it?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad goes on his business trips ever few  months, this isn't the first time I've been house sitting for him, and it isn't the first time I've done this during the Full Moon,&quot; Terri answered, &quot;this is merely the first time I haven't invited the Pack here for the Full Moon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And as such, we know the general layout of the area,&quot; Night finished.<br />
<br />
I gave a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;The real problem is the spying,&quot; Night sighed, &quot;I was with the Pack last night, or at least what I thought was the Pack... yet he spied on you two...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means that Terri isn't the only one that's brought in new members,&quot; I guessed.<br />
<br />
Night nodded, &quot;And I was too aroused at the time to notice that one of the other girls there was newly bitten...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would he spy on us?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paranoia, I'd guess,&quot; Terri gave a sigh, &quot;I will admit, John, that my manner of asking to have you brought into the Pack probably gave away my desire to get you back...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Much like you couldn't hide it from me,&quot; Night commented, &quot;Darren sensed this and like any &quot;good&quot; harem owner, took steps to try and see that his harem wasn't reduced.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's not going to beat me up when we meet, is he?&quot; I then asked, sensing that the original plan to avoid Darren had failed.<br />
<br />
&quot;He might if you challenge him in any way,&quot; Night answered, &quot;If you're submissive, he might just put on some show of &quot;dominance&quot; to let you know who's boss and what he will and will not allow. Another reason to leave his Pack and form our own, if you ask me.&quot;<br />
<br />
By that time, the dishes and utensils we'd been eating with were in the dishwasher and were on their way to being clean. The conversation left me nervous as it gave me more things to worry about with regard to Darren. I didn't want to get in a fight with someone that could probably kill me if he wanted to, but given that he'd spied on Terri and I, the fact that he was running what was for all intents and purposes a harem of werewolves, and that he had had sex with Terri had a part of my mind willing to fight him. And for the moment that made me the most nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we will, Night,&quot; Terri sighed, &quot;but that'll take time and planning. It's 5:50 now and we have the night for some fun. Let's watch a little TV while we wait for moon-rise. Planning how to get away from Darren can't be done tonight... and given how good you're smelling John... I'm not going to be able to focus on making such a plan at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then came and embraced me in a hug. As she had somehow sensed with me the night before, I could smell and hear some signs of arousal on her and on Night. Moon-rise was getting closer and none of us would be able to really hammer out any serious details regarding dealing with Darren, his &quot;loyal harem&quot;, or his spy for a little while. As we began to move toward the living room, I was soon kissing Terri and with my hands drifting down to grope her bottom.</p>
