<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The home Ty had made was simple and comfortable. Resembling a rustic cabin in the woods, though in a hollowed tree, the embers of a warm fire crackled down under the hearth, offering a warm glow over the slatted floor. In the center there sat a simple living area with an ornate carpet matching Camille&#39;s pinkish-white dress, ringed with flower designs, and a comfortable sofa that somehow reminded Ty of his former humanity. There was a simple area for food prep, a wood stove, and most importantly, a closed off area at the back. That was the bedroom, cozy and furnished, with a double size king bed appropriate for two giant deer people. Should the need arise.<br />
<br />
Cuddled under a warm blanket, absolutely content, Ty laid his face against the softness of Camille&#39;s top set of naked breasts and used her very much like a pillow. The doe embraced her lover in her furry arms and let her worries fade away. As the fire eventually smolderedy out and died away, the night passed by without incident, the two animal people warm and happy under a lovely flannel comforter that Ty had given them.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
&quot;It felt weird.&quot; Camille admitted. Ty had dressed her in a hillariously human night gown that reached her knees, with a big pink heart in the middle of it. She leaned over the stove and sizzled a delicious smelling omelette in her skillet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we just acknowledge you&#39;re cooking for me?&quot; Ty stared in wonder. &quot;How do you even know how to do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The deer woman shrugged her shoulders and turned her head in bewilderment. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I guess it&#39;s part of whatever knowledge you infused me with in the first place. I just do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, it&#39;s interesting, because that&#39;s my favorite...&quot; Ty trailed off, and both of them exchanged a &#39;whoa&#39; look. &quot;Hey, is that what happened? I sort of... copied my subconcious into you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re asking the wrong doe. We leave the metaphysical to you.&quot; Camille snorted, flipping her breakfast with a deft movement. &quot;I&#39;m pretty good at this, though, hey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So sleeping was weird.&quot; Ty grinned, realizing he had forgotten to add a place to eat and conjuring up a set of hardwood table and chairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I mean, it&#39;ll take some getting used to.&quot; She yawned slightly and scratched her side through the nightie. &quot;I know sleeping on hard damp ground. In the grass. That&#39;s cool. Being all warm and tucked into bed with you was... well, it was nice. But just weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty set the table as Camille deftly removed her breakfast from the top of the cast iron stove and took a sniff. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re gonna love this.&quot; She took a heavy knife, cut it in two, and walked over to flip one half onto Ty&#39;s plate and then her own, returning the skillet to a nearby tray to cool.<br />
<br />
The giant anthro deer and the humanoid fae creature sat down, Ty in a chair comically undersized for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I kind of like you this way.&quot; Camille grinned slightly. &quot;You look small and adorable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Down girl.&quot; Ty laughed, catching the deer&#39;s lustful gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot; The deer sighed. &quot;So, let&#39;s talk about the crows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Ty grabbed a fork and dug into his meal, mmmming as he hit some fresh green onion and tomato.<br />
<br />
Camille watched him use his fork carefully and picked up her own, staring at it intently and copying the way he held it. &quot;What&#39;s this called?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fork.&quot; Ty responded, stuffing his face.<br />
<br />
Camille stared at it for a moment more, shrugged, and took a bite. &quot;Fork.&quot; She repeated. &quot;I know how to cook but not what anything is. Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, let&#39;s rip off the bandaid. The crows want you to apologize. Seems like a good chance for us to go back and make things right. I think the male is super pissed at you. And you need to give them names. They want names.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay.&quot; Camille said nervously. &quot;Um...&quot; She paused, dropped her fork gently, and rubbed her head. &quot;Did they... tell you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of.&quot; Ty paused to lick his lips. &quot;Do you want to tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; The doe lowered her head sheepishly. &quot;Like I said, I got carried away. I wanted to give them what you gave me, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were unwilling. And new. It wound up doing more harm than good. So, we&#39;ll do better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I forced them to have orgasm. And I may have... I may have jerked the male off.&quot; She blushed deeply, even under her fur, and Ty stared at her with a little hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;It makes sense now.&quot; Ty nodded. &quot;What he said last night makes sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you hate me?&quot; Camille&#39;s ears actually fell. &quot;F-For touching another guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you were excited.&quot; Ty gulped. &quot;I don&#39;t know if I would have been able to resist either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you still love me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing, Ty finished off his omelette, rose from the table, grabbed Camille&#39;s hand, and pulled her away giggling towards the bedroom.<br />
<br />
As promised, Ty was still man enough to please a creature three feet taller than him.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Having returned to his full sized buck after another good post-coital cleaning under the waterfall, the two deer were now dressed in casual and comfortable clothes, having almost abandoned the &quot;king and queen&quot; persona entirely. Had they not been animal people, they wouldn&#39;t have been out of place walking down the street.<br />
<br />
As the morning rose around them and the peaceful sounds of the forest kicked in, Ty and Camille approached the last known whereabouts of the crow family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; A young voice called from one of the trees, and the two cervines stopped to look around. Seeing nothing, there was a younger girly giggle from the treetops that Ty easily traced back to a young crow girl staring at them from about twenty feet up on a thick branch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiii!&quot; The girl called. &quot;Are you looking for my mom and dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes, yes we are!&quot; Ty said nervously. &quot;Are they in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; The girl pointed east. &quot;They&#39;re at the pond! Looking for fish, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, do you have a name?&quot; Ty called up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m River!&quot; The girl called down. &quot;My brothers are Sky and Cloud!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty chuckled slightly and threw a thumbs up into the trees. &quot;All right! Thanks River! Thanks guys!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Byeeeee!&quot; Another young boy&#39;s voice called. Then there were three childish giggles and the rustling of leaves as they continued playing.<br />
<br />
Camille cracked a smile, despite her clear guilt. &quot;Cute kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Further down the trail, just past the trees, the valley opened up into a small pond. Camille&#39;s heart sank as she saw the two adult crows sitting with their clawed feet in the water, kicking gently, and embracing in each other&#39;s wings as they talked, smiled, and cuddled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning!&quot; Ty called, catching the attention of the crows, who turned, looked, and both seemed to sigh annoyedly in unison at the sight of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should go.&quot; Camille pointed back. &quot;Uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we&#39;re going to talk. And what happens happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
The birds rose gently and stood by the water&#39;s edge, waiting, as the two deer approached and stood. The male shot Camille a death glare that she visibly withered from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.&quot; The female said testily. &quot;I hope you&#39;ve come to apologize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We ha-&quot; Ty began, but a clawed wing finger shot up and silenced him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I want to hear it from her.&quot; The female pointed sharply.</p>
