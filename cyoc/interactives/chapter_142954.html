<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jett and his boys rushed through campus, heading towards the stadium locker room. Pike and Tuck stuck close together, tailing Jett, worried that others would see them parading around in their white jocks with their muscled bubble butts hanging out. A few strangers whistled as they sped past eliciting an embarrassed moo from both boys.<br />
<br />
Rounding the corner, the stadium came into sight. The structure was rather large, meant to hold 10,000 hulking bears for a variety of activities like concerts, graduation ceremonies, but most importantly, football.<br />
<br />
Jett had been the proud captain of the football team, The Bulls, for two years now and he was sure to keep the title into his senior year. He worked his time long and hard, taking his team to championships last year for the first time in 15 years. He met his two subs when he joined the team, his alluring, masculine spell cast on them as soon as they laid eyes on the alpha male.<br />
<br />
Nearing the door, Jett spied a colorful poster hanging on the concrete wall.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
ALPHA BEAR COMPETITION<br />
<br />
TONIGHT @ 8 ! ! !<br />
<br />
WHO WILL BE CROWNED ALPHA BEAR ON CAMPUS? CUM ENJOY THE FUN TO FIND OUT!<br />
<br />
SIGN UPS TAKEN AT ENTRY<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
‘Shit!’ Jett thought to himself. He forgot all about the Alpha Bear Competion tonight. He had gotten too distracted changing reality and messing with his studs. Luckily, sign ups weren’t limited before the competition. He could slip in there last minute and take the whole thing with his eyes closed if he wanted.<br />
<br />
Tuck took a few quick steps and opened the locker room door for his master and Pike, relieved to be out of the public eye for a little bit. <br />
<br />
Jett’s heart stopped when as soon as he entered the room. In the middle of the changing men was a short, handsome bull. Dark brown hair coated his perfect frame, from his head down his broad back and perfect ass. A swishing tail flicked back and forth and Jett’s eyes were drawn up as the bull pulled a red jockstrap up his thick legs and over his cute, fuzzy rump. He looked up to see the bull’s face and instantly knew: it was Dan.<br />
<br />
He didn’t know Dan had joined the football team. This must be his first practice. He looked right at home with the team, already deep in conversation with a few teammates. The bull slipped on some shorts and a tight tank top and then turned around. His eyes met with Jett’s and gave him a half smile as he walked over.<br />
<br />
“Hey, you’re Jett right? We met earlier today. I didn’t have a chance to tell you I’m on the team!” The short bull looked up at Jett with dark, sincere eyes. Jett could get lost in them, and almost did, until Tuck touched his shoulder and woke him from his reverie.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me, Master. Pike and I are to dress in just a jock, cleats, and pads like usual right?” Tuck was bashfully staring the man he adored above all else, but he couldn’t help noticing the cute cub he was talking to. <br />
<br />
Jett hds to think for a second. That’s right! He got rid of all of his boy’s clothes, so of course they were forced to practice in nothing but jocks. The thought made his cock stir.<br />
<br />
“Yes Tuck. And don’t interrupt me, I’m taking to our new teammate Dan here. You should get along, he’s a bull like you!”<br />
<br />
Dan and Tuck started to chat as Jett went over to get changed. With a lustful look back at Dan, he signed and stuffed the tablet in his locker, exchanging it for his practice jersey and shorts.<br />
<br />
‘I’ll impress you tonight at the Competition. You’ll be mine, Dan, just you wait.’<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
The team headed out to the field and started to stretch before practice. Jett finally had a chance to see how far his changes had reached, as far as the team was concerned. There were a total of 3 other bulls, plus Dan, Jimmy, and his boys, on the team. He was both relieved and slightly disappointed that the team didn’t have any more shorter members. The bulls he created were sexy, cocky, and slightly dumber than their human counterparts were.<br />
<br />
After stretching, the team huddled up and Jett explained what they would be working on that afternoon. Before breaking he introduced Dan to his teammates.<br />
<br />
“And just cause he’s new doesn’t mean you get to wimp out when playing with him. Give em a hearty Bull’s welcome, boys, and show em what we’re made of! 1-2-3-BREAK!”<br />
<br />
As soon as Jett shouts break, the team erupted in a short, deep “MOO!” It seems changing the team had some other side effects he had not expected. He’d have to remember that for future meetings.<br />
<br />
Overall, the practice went well. The team trained for 3 hours in the warm evening sun while getting drenched in sweat. More than a couple times he had to break up his bull teammates who were getting handsy with each other, unable to resist the musky scent of fellow bulls wrestling on top of one another. His boys put up with a fair bit of teasing, the teammates poking fun at their dedication to their master’s orders of wearing not clothes. He could tell they were uncomfortable and enjoyed it greatly. Their performance wasn’t great at times, but as soon as he asked them to step it up, their submissive nature kicked in and allowed them to focus for a few minutes. <br />
<br />
Practice was wrapping up and a few guys were headed back to the locker room. Jett was keeping an eye on Dan, wanting to trail him inside so he could share a shower with the fireplug bull. <br />
<br />
“Good work today, boys! I think we’re ready for our game on Friday, so go hit the showers!”<br />
<br />
A couple guys cheered and most of the team headed in to change. Jett watched Dan and started to walk behind him, a chance to watch the cub’s ass bounce in his sweaty practice shorts. Suddenly there was a call.<br />
<br />
“Dan! Over here! C’mere real quick!”<br />
<br />
Jett and Dan both looked up. On the other side of the field was Patrick, the ginger haired stud waving a hulking arm trying to get Dan’s attention. Dan’s face lit up and he hustled over to greet his friend.<br />
<br />
Jett scowled and turned away, his plan foiled. That damn Patrick, always ruining his chances. He knew Patrick didn’t care much for him and he couldn’t let Dan end up with another guy. Unfortunately, they seemed to be fast friends. Jett stomped into the locker room, perturbed. He knew how to fix this problem.<br />
<br />
He hurriedly opened his locker and took out his tablet, opening the Chronovac app and getting ready to type. Before he could get started he noticed a couple guys crowded around something in the corner. They were murmuring excitedly among themselves, watching something on the floor.<br />
<br />
Jett put the tablet into his locker and walked over. He was greeted by the sight of a few teammates taking turns sucking off the musky bulls. Typical locker room behavior. He guessed the bulls needed some extra release; the guys weren’t usually this into it. <br />
<br />
Jimmy was on the floor with another bull and came as if one cue when Jett arrived. Two guys sucking his huge bull cock and squeezing his balls, slurping up drop after drop of seed. Strangely, before Jett’s eyes, the guys servicing Jimmy seemed to be a bit bigger than before. What was going on?<br />
<br />
Another guy went down on the other bull, his skilled tongue making quick work of the bull, and was soon drinking a mouthful of cum. As he swallowed, his body shifted and gained mass right before Jett’s eyes. Two more guys came over to get their fill, one sucking on the still-cumming cock and one going for the bull’s...leaking nipples?<br />
<br />
Jett couldn’t help but grope himself. His hand shot down his pants and started to jerk, his sweaty jock providing a small amount of musky lube as he watched the growing members of his team. His team was getting larger, stronger, more horny. Soon the entire team was sucking off every bull on the team. A cacophony of moos echoed throughout the locker room as many loaders were taken and lapped up by the horny footballers. Jett came twice, watching over his teammates as they got into an all-out orgy fueled by hard work and bull cum.<br />
<br />
Jett was struck by an idea and slipped away, licking cum off his fingers and wiping his hand on his shorts. He took out the Chronovac and started typing.<br />
<br />
He noticed Dan hadn’t been among the orgy, but this worked out perfectly. He was going to make the rest of the team bulls, along with some extra adjustments. His plan was to lure Dan into his new harem of bull men. He knew he couldn’t resist being part of a big family of horny, submissive bulls.<br />
<br />
>>make everyone on the football team a bull. Make every member except dan totally submissive and horny for me and only me. Make them leak constantly from their cocks and nipples and give them udder sacks good for milking.<br />
<br />
As excited as Jett was to lure Dan in, he also had the idea to capitalize on the powerful growth effects of bull cum. If he could harvest enough cum, he could grow him and his team to greater sizes than ever before and start a business selling the “milk” to willing customers. He had the Chronovac, he could easily set up a company, right?<br />
<br />
>>INTERPRETED COMMAND: PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ALTERATIONS……..SAVED<br />
<br />
A powerful shimmering flowed through the room as the mooing grew louder and louder. Jett put the tablet in his locker and walked around the corner. In front of him was a writhing mass of sexy bulls. These bulls were different, their nipples were much larger and all leaking milk, and each huge bull sack was adorned with four lactating nipples. The floor was coated with milk and cum and the room was filled with the musk of 20 horny animals.<br />
<br />
Jett clapped his hands, beaming. “Alright, that’s enough! You all are coming to the Alpha Bear Competition tonight, right?”<br />
<br />
The crowd hushed and all looked at Jett, their collective master who they all loved and worshiped.<br />
<br />
“Yes Jett!”<br />
“We love you Master!”<br />
“You’ll definitely win, you’re the sexiest man alive Sir!”<br />
<br />
All the bulls erupted in praise for their perfect dom; they had no doubt he would win. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright bulls, shower up and let&#39;s get moovin! The competition starts soon!” <br />
<br />
Jett slipped off his shorts and cum-soaked jock and flung it into his harem. The bulls mooed in delight and took to licking and sucking their masters cum and sniffing his used shorts. A few followed him into the showers.<br />
<br />
‘This is it, Dan. After tonight, you’ll be part of my herd.’</p>
