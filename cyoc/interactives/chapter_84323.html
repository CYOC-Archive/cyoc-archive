<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After hir phone call with Danna and Mikkie, Sally moved into the nearby living room where Jess and Nikole were laying down and watching television. They had successfully assisted getting Casey to the room where Ryles lived. The homes that they all had in Janace were not mansions, but they were certainly bigger than anything they had had in Fee City.  For the most part, they did have their own homes, but as Ryles went from fox to Foxkat and Angel and Demon came from Sydney, and Sammy and Gloria moved in, many of them began sharing homes. Charlie and Sally shared their home with Luna, Lia, Midnight, and Talia, though Luna and Lia had a home for themselves being built. Angel and Demon lived with Alexis and Flake. Ryles, and now Casey, lived with Jess and Nikole, and it was agreed that a new home would be built for them shortly. Maurice and Snowy would be sharing their home with Mina so long as Mina decided to remain in Janace. Sammy and Gloria had moved in with Mikkie and Danna, and there was talk about another home being built for them. Though, despite all the sharing of homes and how much this would probably annoy most people, the Kats seemed enjoy much of it. It raised some ideas that Kats instinctively lived by a fairly communal nature.<br />
<br />
Jess and Nikole had been helping Ryles and Casey settled in, though it was entirely pointing out where Ryles&#39;s room was. Once that was done, Jess and Nikole had settled down to watch some television and to let Fluffy and Mary cuddle between the pregnant bellies of Jess and Nikole&#39;s taur halves. And that was how Sally found them. Fluffy lay against Jess and Mary lay against Nikole. Sally could even hear hir month old soughters that shi had sired purring away against the furry bodies of their grandmother and aunt. Sally had been with them initially, but had gone out into the yard <br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Sally asked to hir mother-in-law and hir sither.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; Jess answered, and then reached back to softly pet Fluffy&#39;s head, making the infant Chakat purr some more, &quot;and these two are so precious I didn&#39;t want to get up...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could also go for a bite to eat,&quot; Nikole added, and then purred back, making Mary coo back, &quot;and these two are precious. You and Charlie have done well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Sally smiled, and hoped onto the couch that Jess and Nikole were laying in front of  and leaned hir human torso down so that shi could reach and rub Jess and Nikole&#39;s swollen wombs, which looked gravid, but not yet so much that birth was imminent. &quot;But I think they&#39;re mostly knowing who their family members are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As good as that feels... I&#39;m still hungry,&quot; Jess purred in response.<br />
<br />
Sally shook hir head, &quot;and what do you want to eat?&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in Moscow, things were not particularly good. Someone&#39;s decision to attack Danna&#39;s fashion show had essentially ruined it, not that it was really all that big. Danna had originally felt that the show would be in New York City, as the phone call shi&#39;d received did come from a New York company. Then came disappointment. Danna had done A LOT of work that had to be done to get plant matter to be woven into an effective fabric and making it fashionable. After all, simply sewing cactus plants together wouldn&#39;t necessarily be fashionable. They were too large, thick, and bulky that doing that would give people the impression that the wearer was wearing some clunky suit of &quot;plant armor.&quot; Armor was NOT fashionable. No one went around trying to look like combat infantrymen going into battle or SWAT personnel going to arrest someone. Not to mention that since cactus stayed alive in deserts by reducing how much water they lost, sewing them together would leave them a rather sticky mess. Danna spent a lot of time in making all of the vests and outfits that were worn, in weaving the plant fibers together and making sure the weave was so fine that they wouldn&#39;t irritate their fur and that they would still be fashionable, and shi felt that that work that shi had done so that Kats could live with humans and not end up turning their communities into nudist colonies, like the way Fee City became according to Sally, Charlie, Jess, and Nikole, was worth some real recognition...<br />
<br />
But while the New York company had agreed to put on the show for an American audience, they did not agree to do it live and in New York. It was to be done in Moscow, Russia, one of the most inhospitable places for Kats. A small handful had willingly become Kats, and all of them had been arrested by the Russian government in accordance with Russia&#39;s anti-gay laws. The fact that Kats didn&#39;t have a single gender and any relationship was heterosexual for them didn&#39;t matter. Putin decided Kats were homosexuals, and that was the end of the discussion. The New York company had gotten permission to have the show in Moscow, provided it was in a controlled setting and that no serum was to be distributed. The attack had essentially ruined that too. Danna knew that they might be able to get out, but they&#39;d all seen enough on the news to know that Russia was not a good place to be if you were a Kat. Especially considering the news reports that while there were protests, Putin had the support of the Russian Army and a dictatorial level of control over the Russian government, and with regards to his anti-homosexual laws, enjoyed enough support from the Russian people that any protests against it were soon met with &quot;counter-protests&quot; and near riots between each side. And when the police intervened, they typically arrested the pro-gay protesters and rewarded the pro-Putin protesters. Russia was NOT a good place to be a Kat.<br />
<br />
The end reasoning for the company&#39;s decision for this was that having the show in Russia was cheaper and and taping it would mean that it would reach an American audience... eventually. That all had left Danna somewhat depressed from the start, because it was a slap in the face to all hir hard work and that in order to try and win anything that might give them real recognition for their work, and the fact that Kats weren&#39;t mindless creatures, normally, would mean the show would have to go perfectly. The events of this had made it clear that hir show was ruined.<br />
<br />
But shi couldn&#39;t let her disappointment and probably even depression control hir. Shi watched in horror as a woman in a rather tight dress stood up, screaming in surprise and horror. What got Danna&#39;s attention however was that her... or rather hir dress was beginning to rise up at hir waist. Shi was becoming a Kat, and the first thing shi was growing was a penis. As it grew, it also grew erect and was pushing hir dress upward. Brown fur began growing on hir arms as shi continued to scream in in pain. Danna then gasped in surprise as hir face began to push forward into a large square muzzle, covered in brown fur and tipped with a black nose. At the same time the woman&#39;s body began to put on a lot of additional muscle. As shi grew larger, hir dress finally lost the battle against hir body leaving hir naked and with a very large erection between hir legs and a strong scent of feminine arousal as well. Shi finally fell as hir body began to lengthen to take on the taur form that most Kats had. It was only once hir forelegs had grown out that the new Bearkat got to hir feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;MUST FUCK!&quot; Shi bellowed in a voice that actually frightened Danna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danna!&quot; came Mikkie&#39;s voice, &quot;Danna! We&#39;ve got to bar the doors! Keep them inside!&quot;<br />
<br />
That shook Danna out of hir fright, and as the rest of the people who had been hired or had come to see the show on their own began transforming, and those that had transformed could soon be heard mating with each other, Danna began to run as fast as she could for the exits to the building. Shi and Mikkie were only about a month into their pregnancies, so if it was &quot;visible&quot; it was only an inch or two and most wouldn&#39;t even be able to see that they were pregnant.Sammy and Gloria swelled up quickly, but they also laid eggs that hadn&#39;t hatched and showed no signs of being ready to hatch, yet. That left Danna and Mikkie on the gestation period that humans and Kats had, nine months, and it wasn&#39;t really until the fourth month that it became visibly obvious that they were pregnant. As such, Danna could still move quickly. Doing so wasn&#39;t too hard, and the door locks were manageable. Once they got the doors shut, they managed to regroup near the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay the doors are locked,&quot; Danna spoke as shi panted out.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Mikkie nodded, &quot;Of course it means we&#39;re locked in here with a bunch of horny Kats...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound too bad,&quot; came Angel&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
Danna and Mikkie turned to see Angel and Demon approaching with an unusual prize. It was a human male that they were dragging by his feet. The man was also unconscious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Angel... Demon... what did you two do?&quot; Mikkie groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;We locked all the doors like you said, Mistress,&quot; Demona answered, using the same references to Kats that had been human before becoming Kats, just as Ryles commonly referred to Jess as &quot;Mistress.&quot; &quot;We found this one running toward the doors, but he was the only one and he said we were freaky ugly...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not freaky ugly, are we?&quot; Angel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Mikkie spoke quickly, &quot;Both of you are beautiful and will make fine mates... this guy... this guy&#39;s just closed minded that&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was clear that Angel and Demon had caught the man that had thrown the gas bomb that started all this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Danna said slowly, &quot;at least Putin will have someone to send to Siberia...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s worry about him AFTER we&#39;ve gotten all these Kats under control,&quot; Mikkie said, &quot;The doors may be looked, but I&#39;d bet that they might be able to get through them with a determined effort... especially since so many of them are based off of bears or tigers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danna looked out to now see a horde of mating Kats, the ones being mounted spraying the floor, upturned tables, seats, chairs, and other Kats  with semen and not caring much about it. Many of them were Bearkats with brown fur of varying shades, though there were also a couple of Bearkats that looked like they had black fur. The rest were Chakats that had been based off of tigers.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how are we to deal with all these Kats again?&quot; Danna asked, &quot;I only just called Alexis, and while Paris is closer that Janace, it&#39;ll be a few hours for them to get here and we don&#39;t have any of the vaccine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we do,&quot; said Angel.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do? Where?&quot; Mikkie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We ARE the vaccine,&quot; Angel answered as Danna watched Angel&#39;s own penis slide out of its sheath, &quot;Mistress Jess explained it to Ryles and us... when a Kat is vaccinated, the Foxkat Vaccine fills it completely and moves just like the Virus... but it doesn&#39;t transform people, it merely vaccinates the Kats and helps them get their minds back...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Mikkie began.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to do it,&quot; Demon spoke, making Angel giggle, &quot;With no darts or syringes our only other option is to wait until the others get here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikkie and Danna both traded looks.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;re both already pregnant!&quot; Danna pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which helps,&quot; Demon answered, &quot;If you are pregnant, you aren&#39;t in heat. Being in heat is to be ready to have kittens. You are already having kittens and thus are not in heat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides... sex is fun...&quot; Angel commented.<br />
<br />
Danna and Mikkie only sighed and then looked to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is only to vaccinate them,&quot; Danna and Mikkie both said to each other, &quot;I will always love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danna then began to squeeze the muscles shi had around hir scent glands at the base of hir tail. In doing so, shi began to spray a fine pheromone that smelled even to a human nose extremely good. They knew that a Skunkat&#39;s spray... &quot;perfume&quot; would arouse other Kats that smelled it, but at one point Jess got curious and they tested to see what its effects would be on people. And so, during the six years between Paris and Sydney, a couple (both in terms of numbers and in terms of romance) who had come to buy the Serum were asked to participate in an experiment first. Danna and Alexis both essentially sprayed the room the two humans were in with Mikkie and Flake also being present. The result was fairly obvious, Danna spent an hour mating with Mikkie and Alexis spent an hour mating with Flake. They hadn&#39;t been in heat back then, so no pregnancy occurred, but Jess did get the answer shi had been looking for. The couple that had volunteered for the test also had sex for an hour. The conclusion was to be as careful as possible with their natural perfume, as while Flake and Mikkie had no problem with it, in private, they didn&#39;t want to create &quot;rape cases&quot; by accidentally arousing people in public.<br />
<br />
The result was to be expected as Danna felt blood rushing to hir sheath and hir penis beginning to push out between hir rear legs.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
A few hours later, Alexis and Flake&#39;s plane came in for a landing at Moscow, only to be greeted by Russian security personnel. All of them were heavily armed and none of them looked particularly pleased. They were lead by an officer in a dress uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are here to remove the trouble makers?&quot; the officer questioned in an icy voice. He spoke English well, but with a heavy accent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trouble makers?&quot; Alexis asked slowly and raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring the prisoners forward!&quot; the officer than shouted in a loud voice.<br />
<br />
Alexis and Flake then watched as a large number of Kats came forward. Most were Bearkats and there were several tiger based Chakats. At the head of them were Danna, Mikkie, Angel, and Demon. Between them was a human male. While the Kats weren&#39;t in restraints, the human male was in cuffs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You arrested them?!&quot; Flake demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We detained them when we arrived at the scene,&quot; the Russian officer answered, &quot;we only tolerated your homosexual presence in our country because the company has worked with Russian models and has had a good reputation. Since your friends and all of the victims are American citizens, we cannot charge them with a crime formally, and since the victims of this attack are not to arrest the attacker...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexis looked to the human male between Angel and Demon and then remembered why Alexis and Flake had been sent to France originally. Chris had been found in Rio and by finding him, they had found one of Li Sang&#39;s labs and arrested the scientists working there. They had been sent to Paris to check one of the outside branches of the new Chakat Industries to make sure it hadn&#39;t been infiltrated. They hadn&#39;t found much that would really indicate anything super serious, but that didn&#39;t mean that there were other labs. In fact the scientists seemed to give the indication that there were more labs.<br />
<br />
&quot;We thank you for delivering the terrorist into the UN&#39;s care, and we will take him back to Janace in due time,&quot; Alexis spoke, &quot;However, the terrorist is likely an employee for Li Sang... and while his master is now in prison and awaiting trial, his followers must be hunted down to stop the spread of the Virus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you saying?&quot; the officer questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ask that you allow myself, my mate, and the four that originally came here for their show, to work to find the lab where this guy got whatever weapon and counterfeit version of the Chakat Virus/Serum that he used.&quot; Alexis spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t law enforcement!&quot; the Russian officer roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;With regard to these outbreaks, thanks to the UN, we are,&quot; Flake answered, &quot;Danna and Mikkie&#39;s fashion is a side project.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if we don&#39;t find the lab, you could be facing more outbreaks in the future,&quot; Mikkie spoke up, &quot;It wouldn&#39;t look good to the world&#39;s press if you end up arresting people who&#39;s only crime was that they were a victim of someone else&#39;s crimes!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Russian officer sighed and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuri!&quot; the officer ordered to a nearby soldier, &quot;Go on board and inform the pilot and crew that as soon as they are refueled they will be taking these new victims back to America.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Comrade Colonel!&quot;<br />
<br />
The officer then turned back to Flake and Alexis.<br />
<br />
&quot;And know this, queer,&quot; the Russian officer said firmly, &quot;I will be watching you closely. You infect anyone! Anyone! And I will turn you into Swiss cheese. Am I clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Crystal,&quot; Alexis grumbled back in an equally icy tone.</p>
