<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tad really didn&#39;t have any great ideas &quot;rules&quot; that werewolves were to follow. After all, he was still fairly new to Moon Lake and had really been learning a lot about the pack&#39;s rules and Moon Lake&#39;s rules from Amy, Jay and Leon&#39;s older sister. The fact that she was a stunningly beautiful white furred werewolf when transformed and actually had interest in him was a different issue. For the moment he simply enjoyed the pizza that the Howlers had ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... where did your parents go?&quot; Tad wondered to Amy before taking a bite from the slice he was holding.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know for sure,&quot; Amy gave a shrug, &quot;Sunday has always been &quot;date night&quot; for mom and dad. Sometimes they go to the Local Diner... sometimes they go to Seattle... Sometimes they go to the campgrounds by the lake and have a cookout while looking at the sunlight and then moonlight reflected off the water. As such, it&#39;s meant that since I turned sixteen, I had to babysit these two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah you love us!&quot; Jay declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um-hm,&quot; Leon agreed with his cheeks stuffed full of pizza.<br />
<br />
Amy gave her brothers a small smile and leaned to a side so that she could rub Leon&#39;s head. Tad chuckled a little bit as Leon finished chewing and playfully swatted Amy&#39;s hand away. It was interesting to be able to see siblings get along and interact with each other, especially from the fact that he didn&#39;t have a younger sibling. As such he kind of envied Amy a bit, as Jay and Leon didn&#39;t seem like bad kids and they responded well to his presence there. So it couldn&#39;t be all bad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be a lot of responsibility,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;but from what I&#39;ve seen... your brothers aren&#39;t bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They aren&#39;t,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;Sometimes... sometimes they&#39;re little brothers and can be annoying, but I do love them. And with them through their first transformation... there is a great deal of relief that things turned out well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I couldn&#39;t have been more accurate,&quot; Tad said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... yours and your mom&#39;s idea worked in terms of all the training... acceptance and so on,&quot; Jay said quickly, &quot;It really didn&#39;t hurt... at least it wasn&#39;t like what Amy went through with her first transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad gave a slow nod remembering what Amy had told him on what had happened with her. In that sense he was glad that he&#39;d been able to be of help in preventing anything like that happening again with Jay and Leon. The biggest surprise had been more with the timing of Jay and Leon&#39;s first transformation in that it came even earlier than had been originally expected. But it did work out.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do you want to do before everyone has to turn in and I have head home?&quot; Tad asked to the group. <br />
<br />
A few things ran through his mind, but that would only be with Amy, and with her brothers there, his ideas wouldn&#39;t work. He&#39;d gotten his homework done during the day and figured that Amy and her brothers had done the same. Hunting could be something... but Tad figured that was probably better served done with their parents as a family bonding sort of adventure for them, not to mention that Tad had no experience hunting in his wolf form prior to coming to Moon Lake. There were times where he could manage to transform and have fun... But given the locations where the Decker family had been living being close to major urban centers and military bases, hunting was a big &quot;no-no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d actually thought a good game of forest tag could be fun,&quot; Amy gave a small smile, &quot;everyone&#39;s all caught up on their homework... and these two have some energy to burn...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it this involves running in the woods in wolf form?&quot; Tad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Along with chasing each other and tagging each other,&quot; Amy smiled further, &quot;we may start with a bit of a hike into the woods behind the house, but that&#39;s just to stretch and get loose. From there, it isn&#39;t unlike any other game of tag.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like fun,&quot; Tad commented and then glanced over to Jay and Leon, &quot;Of course... I&#39;m sure your folks have talked with you on the rules and when you can transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay and Leon both nodded. With that the four stood up Tad followed Amy toward the back door, which included a small sort of area where clothes and shoes could be placed before heading out. What then followed was obvious as clothing was slipped off and neatly lined up in a designated spot.  Seeing Amy naked did remind Tad of some of the other ideas for things to do, but again, he remembered that her brothers were there. Tad felt his cheeks flush a little as he knew he was naked, but the giggle he heard from Amy soon reminded him that in Moon Lake among weres there was less concern about nudity than there was in other parts of the country, not to mention that as a werewolf and one of the larger were species, Tad&#39;s were form was too big safely wear clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still getting used to Moon Lake&#39;s different mores?&quot; Amy gave a small giggle as white fur grew across her body and covering up her skin and in an unaroused state was enough that her nipples weren&#39;t easily seen. In fact, as she changed, while the hair on her head didn&#39;t change color, her pubic hair DID change to match her white fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it IS different from all the Marine Corps and Naval bases my family&#39;s lived at,&quot; Tad replied as began to transform and rose up onto digitigrade legs, &quot;I mean... those guys are all tough, but not all of them are weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marines and Navy...?&quot; Leon asked curiously, marveling Tad and Amy&#39;s transformation. Both of them grew in size and strength, one white furred and one black furred.<br />
<br />
Tad was about to answer, but at that point in his transformation, his muzzle began to push forward. It caused him no pain, as he was well used to transforming, but there were limits to what he could do physically while in the process of transforming. The result was actually a series of short and almost happy sounding barks. As his transformation finished, Tad perked his ears and slowly wagged his tail as he felt the same rush that he always had when he transformed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Marines aren&#39;t a fully separate branch of the US Military,&quot; Tad explained, &quot;They operate under the Department of the Navy. This includes amphibious assault, as was done in World War II but also is used in the capture of ships. Every ship the Navy has will include some complement of Marines for basic security and operation of the ship&#39;s weapons... This will also include boarding enemy ships at sea...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like pirates?&quot; Jay asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorta... but not quite,&quot; Tad slowly scratched the back of his head as he looked to the two young werewolves in Jay and Leon, both fully transformed and looking to him with tails wagging. &quot;Pirates are criminals, who do what they do to steal money or the ship. When the Navy sends the Marines to capture a ship, it&#39;s because America is at war with the nation that owns the ship and the ship that is targeted is a warship. The Marines aren&#39;t sent after civilians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; Jay and Leon said together.<br />
<br />
It was at that moment that Amy cut in, &quot;If the discussion on defense organization is done... the sun is down. I believe we are free to go out for some games of tag.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy then opened the door, and revealed the trees that had been planted between the spokes that made Moon Lake&#39;s streets. The sky was dark and they could see the stars twinkling above the trees. Jay and Leon both walked by both of them. Tad was the last to head out and he smiled a bit to Amy as he walked by her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve played tag before, right?&quot; Amy asked with a grin as she shut the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a kid... yeah,&quot; Tad answered and followed Amy. &quot;I couldn&#39;t transform then... but I&#39;d think the rules of the game haven&#39;t changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, because you&#39;ll be &quot;it&quot; first,&quot; Amy spoke and then jogged off into the woods behind the Howler home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Tad called and jogged after her.</p>
