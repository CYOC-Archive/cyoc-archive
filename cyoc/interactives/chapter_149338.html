<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sorry, this one&#39;s a little rough in parts grammatically.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having been printed on (and hence magically linked) to ordinary paper, the detachable Jen posters began to degrade. Of course, the curse wouldn&#39;t let Jen come to harm, and hence be unable to further spread the curse she did not yet remember she had. And so while the paper containing her original body was kept magically pristine, the papers containing her copies were not, and the students of Glendale one by one found the poster to have reverted to a simple drawing of a girl instead of her actual holes.<br />
<br />
For Jen herself, she had soon found most of the action happening in her lower orifices dying down. Her mouths and tongues however, having been printed on sturdier index cards, would remain for a year or two. Having (somewhat) grown used to constantly performing oral on the student body, Jen had begun complaining to Kyle about her boredom being on the bulletin board, as well as fear that someone would one day throw her away due to seeming like a normal drawing that was arbitrarily placed there. At first, Kyle had responded by placing her in the wall of the boys&#39; bathroom with in a viennese oyster position, her stuck-out genitals the only parts outside the wall. But Jen had gone right back to asking Kyle to take her out of school when he re-emerged her face again. Kyle wouldn&#39;t admit it to her, and barely even to himself, but he actually <i>missed</i> hearing the voice of his former tormentor when during her silent time as the bathroom sex-fixture of building C. He placed her in a sheet of paper again and took her home.<br />
<br />
As the weeks went by, Jen and Kyle had, haltingly, grown more familiar with each other. Jen spent most of her time as a upper torso on Kyle&#39;s bed when he was home. Of course, he pusher her back into being a drawing on his bedding when he left for school, and often pulled <i>other</i> parts out when he got bored or horny. It was on one such evening that Kyle and Jen were talking. Jen was stomach down with her legs and lower back embedded in Kyle&#39;s sheets, leaving the hump of her ass exposed along with her ribcage & up, including her arms. Supporting herself on those arms while Kyle bounced onto her offered rear, Jen spoke to Kyle over her shoulder. &quot;Y-you know, (UH!) as much (AH!) I hate t-to (ERR!) say it, dwee(EE!)b....aaaaAAHHH!....you last a pretty long time. Almost too long, my pussy was starting to get sore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Panting, Kyle replied &quot;Hah...hah...And <i>I</i> can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this, but thanks Jen. I appreciate the compliment. You&#39;re not <i>quite</i> as bitchy as I once thought. I mean, you are, but not as much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still new to me too, to be honest. Where the flippin&#39; hell are your parents anyway?! I make so much noise every day when you&#39;re going at me, they <i>must</i> hear me.&quot; Kyle slid over and pulled her body completely out, save one of her feet (since the curse would have her completely submerse herself in the nearest object whenever she was totally free). He looked down at the bed for a long moment, before moving his eyes upward to her and saying &quot;They&#39;re gone. My dad passed away early, and my mom works so much to support us that she often doesn&#39;t come home at all, sleeping in her car between shifts for days at a time. That&#39;s why sometimes I won&#39;t pull you out of the bed, <i>that&#39;s</i> how often my mom comes home when I&#39;m awake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Part of Jen&#39;s mind was completely stone-hearted at this, keeping the depths of depravity that Kyle had subjected her too. But close physical proximity over a long time can have odd effects, even on people who don&#39;t like one another. To her ever-lessening surprise, she found it fought by another part of herself that looked back on all the things <i>she</i> had subjected <i>him</i> to. Out of the perhaps hundreds of times big and small that she had tormented him for her own amusement and others, she thought of one incident in particular; it was storming that day, and Glendale Middle School was drenched in the continuing, uncharacteristic downpour for that season. Still a hardy midwestern town, the school had let out the student to go home normally, and Jen had snatched Kyle&#39;s umbrella out of his hand when he walked past before her boyfriend at the time (only her second) had on cue pushed him into the mud puddle right outside of the covered area. Laughing, she had held the flimsy dime-store umbrella between her two hands, as Kyle tried to scramble to his feet. Slipping again, he had screamed at her, his face screwing up into tears &quot;DON&#39;T! MY MOM BOUGHT ME THAT!&quot;. Knowing that the kids around her watching would be entertained by the display, Jen replied &quot;Ohh, your mom bought you an <i>umbrella!</i> Pft, guess she&#39;s gonna have to buy another one dork.&quot; before snapping it with her knee and tossing the pieces into the puddle with him. They had laughed and laughed as the awkward, pimply boy lay crying in the rain, an example of the special cruelty children sometimes display.<br />
<br />
Her mind continued replaying the event from her perspective, before thinking of how the day must have looked like when Kyle was given the umbrella; His mother, perpetually-exhausted, handing Kyle the special gift with a pat on the head. Kyle gratefully accepting it practically as treasure. His anguish at the token of his family, his only family&#39;s love for him taken away and destroyed. The hatred of her it must have engendered. And she felt a weight in her chest; dragging her down, but not into the bed. Even deeper, into the ground. Pulling her all the way down, straight to hell.<br />
<br />
Her eyes began to water. &quot;Kyle...oh my god Kyle, I&#39;m so fucking sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
The seconds ticked on as Jen looked at her former victim-turned-victimizer with horror. Horror, but not at him. At herself. She reached out to him; Kyle reflexively started to pull away from the cause of his scars. Jen saw the flinch; the weight grew ever heavier.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t make fun of you! I <b>promise you</b> Kyle. I promise!&quot; After a moment, he tentatively embraced her back. There was a long silence.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jennifer hugged Kyle, but her eyes were open as she considered something.<br />
<br />
Jen finally asked the question that was gnawing at her. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you...like, turn me into a dog turd or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>What?!</i>&quot; Kyle moved away, looking at Jen as if she had suddenly grown a third arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, you hate me. You could have turned me into something that essentially killed me. Hell, you could have reduced me to just my pussy and kept me in your drawer forever, I would have eventually just gone insane from the sensory deprivation. What you did to me was pretty fucking bad, to put it mildly. But you could have done so many things that just ejected me from the universe. There would never have been anything to remind you of me ever again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because...well, yeah I hated you. But making you not exist anymore or driving you insane is a whole &#39;nother level. You were a bully, but you didn&#39;t <i>murder</i> me. You didn&#39;t chop off my arm or anything. So I wasn&#39;t going to do anything that killed or maimed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you would do something that made me the whole school&#39;s sex toy.&quot; Jen crossed her arms. &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still <i>really</i> hate that you did this to me. My tongue is still in my best friend&#39;s asshole, and she doesn&#39;t even remember me. To say I feel violated is an understatement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.....I&#39;m sorry Jen. God, I never thought I&#39;d say that, but it&#39;s true. I&#39;m sorry for cursing you, and for what I did after.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen kept her eyes downcast. &quot;I see how I deserved it though. Not <i>this</i>-&quot; she gestured at herself, &quot;but some sort of comeuppance. Some sort of humbling. I do appreciate that you didn&#39;t turn me into a turd though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle looked away thoughtfully. &quot;And I appreciate that you haven&#39;t cursed me to be impotent or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, <i>WHAT.</i>&quot; Jen&#39;s jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
Kyle looked back at her quizzically &quot;What? You didn&#39;t know? After someone is cursed, the curse is passed onto them. I made sure to keep your mouth submerged for a few weeks, but I know that the curse works to maintain it&#39;s spread; I couldn&#39;t keep you silent forever. After I decided I was satisfied if it ended now, I pulled you out, come what may.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s face saddened again, &quot;You hated me so much you literally risked your life to get revenge...Kyle, I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;....if I can ever buy anything again, I&#39;ll buy you a new umbrella. A good one.&quot; Jen said finally.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? Are you <i>sure</i> you&#39;re alright mentally?&quot; Kyle asked with genuine concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, dork. I&#39;m buying you a fuckin&#39; umbrella.&quot; Jen glared icily at him for a moment, before her face softened into a laugh. &quot;But to answer your question, of course I&#39;m not sure. <i>You</i> try sucking off ten people simultaneously while spilling your guts out to someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was laughing along with her, &quot;I think I&#39;ll pass on that! After all, sucking people off is your speci-&quot; WHAPP! Jen flung Kyle&#39;s own pillow into his face. &quot;I <i>said</i> shut up! I wouldn&#39;t if you&#39;d given me <i>teeth</i> you know!&quot;<br />
<br />
They settled down after a moment. Kyle looked deep in thought about something, almost as if he was in an internal debate. &quot;Jen...I understand if you still want your revenge, or if you just don&#39;t trust me. But you can&#39;t undo your own curse, it&#39;s not allowed under the rules of it. But, if you give me the curse, I&#39;ll undo as much of yours as I can. I promise. And you&#39;ll have it again afterward. I went overboard. Power corrupts, as they say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You don&#39;t want a built-in sex toy inhabiting your bed anymore?&quot; Jen was skeptical for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do. But I don&#39;t want to continue hurting someone who I&#39;ve more than paid back....and whose company I&#39;ve honestly come to enjoy.&quot; Kyle said, acting incongruously shy with the final part given that he had taken her doggystyle just ten minutes before. Yet despite the sheer amount of sex they had had, there was still a tension similar to that between crushes.<br />
<br />
Now it was Jen&#39;s turn to debate within herself. There <i>was</i> still a portion of her that considered whether it was all a trick to get out of being counter-cursed, but Kyle&#39;s words came across to her as genuine. Still, there was no rush if that were the case, and besides that she saw an opportunity that she felt should take advantage of now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m ready to trust you on that yet. I&#39;d rather hold onto the curse for now. But how do you know so much about the curse? I&#39;ve only heard the stories.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, there was a bunch of old books in the library archives that I took notes on. You want to see them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve spent most of my time over the past few months staring at people pleasuring themselves with me in class, at the stalls of the boys&#39; bathroom, and  at your ceiling. I <i>almost</i> miss studying. Almost. And magic sounds like a fun subject.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle dug under a bunch of clothes in his closet before coming back with a binder of notes. He handed them to Jen. &quot;Thanks Kyle. I&#39;ve got one more favor to ask though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Hungry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a little later. I was actually wondering if you could push my back in.&quot; Jen said, laying on her stomach again and spreading her legs slightly while she opened the binder.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kyle just stared. He stood there for a long moment perplexed.  &quot;.....Sorry Jen, I don&#39;t really know that much about massage. I could probably learn, just need to google-&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen shot him a withering look. &quot;Holy shit Kyle. I&#39;m talking about fucking, nerd. As in, come here and fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Later that evening, Jen (still partially embedded in prone bone position) leafed through Kyle&#39;s notes while eating some chicken and mashed potatoes on his bed. Kyle was talking about his family&#39;s financial struggles.<br />
<br />
&quot;The most frustrating thing is knowing I don&#39;t have any special talents that can get me a good job after school. I&#39;m smart, but not quite as smart as the other nerds like Shen or Tim. And forget any sort of athletics.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked over and raised an eyebrow. &quot;I don&#39;t know, you seem pretty athletic to me. I mean, your height is a minor problem, but still, if put some work in at the gym and you wouldn&#39;t be getting beat up so easily. I think it&#39;s a limiting belief for you, that because you&#39;re nerdy you can&#39;t also be fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what makes you think I&#39;m athletic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve known people with less <i>stamina,</i> if you catch my drift.&quot; Jen said with a smirk as she looked away in thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a little TMI.&quot; Kyle said pursing his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up Kyle! You&#39;ve been inside my ass <i>and</i> you gave it to every boy in the school! Are you <i>really</i> going to get grossed out by ex-boyfriend talk?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle froze for a moment. &quot;....yeah I guess that&#39;s fair.&quot; He sighed. &quot;But it&#39;s not about getting beat up. I want to make a lot of money so my mom doesn&#39;t have to work anymore, but I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m even good at.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what you did with me, I can tell you you&#39;re pretty damn creative.&quot; Jen chuckled knowingly.<br />
<br />
Kyle rolled his eyes. &quot;I mean, sure, but making magic sex toys isn&#39;t exactly a marketable skill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen turned to him with an odd look. &quot;Except, what if it is? I&#39;ve been thinking about your offer. I want to be free again. Not to mention, I&#39;d like to see my family again. At the same time, I can&#39;t walk back into my house without thinking about yours, and what you and your mom go through.&quot; Jennifer Smith belonged to one of the richest families in town, and one of the most influential ones in the state. Hell, her aunt was the former mayor of Washburn just 50 miles away. &quot;Especially when I see a way to fix it. I trust you enough to give you back the curse. Do you trust me enough to go into business with me after I&#39;m free?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was shocked. &quot;Business? What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah! See, that&#39;s the difference between my families and most. We&#39;re taught to seize opportunities, not give them away.&quot; Kyle thought Jen&#39;s haughty tone was somewhat comical given her position as a head, shoulders, and ass. He slapped her defenseless tush before straddling it. &quot;OW! What&#39;d you do that for?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just seizing an opportunity.&quot; Kyle tried to play it serious, but his smile was impossible to hide as Jen looked back. She smiled back for a moment before turning serious again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Touche. But I&#39;m not kidding. You&#39;re sitting on a gold mine and you don&#39;t even know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still don&#39;t get what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, you&#39;re <i>literally sitting</i> on a gold mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle looked down, looked back up at Jen, looked down again, before looking back up with his jaw dropped. &quot;You really mean...?!&quot;</p>
