<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Chapmans made their way through the town&#39;s streets with little real difficulty. Megan and Jenny didn&#39;t follow them and Cupple never appeared before them again. It was something that Jeff felt relieved about given the general situation they were in. It was unlikely that any of them would be human again, or at least not without gaining real help to counter Edward Cupple&#39;s magic that was likely controlling Megan and Jenny, and as such, he really didn&#39;t want to have to have a running fight as they tried to make their way toward the town&#39;s Catholic church and hope that the monks or others could help them. It let them all move along without pursuit or other worries.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think Megan and Jenny will leave the house now that we&#39;re not in it?&quot; Zoe asked as they crossed one street as they began to make their way to the town&#39;s Catholic Church. &quot;Or would Cupple have them stay there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Given how much they talked about establishing a hive,&quot; Lucy grumbled, &quot;it&#39;s probable they will be sent out after another family or one of our neighbors. After all, they already said they got the house across the street from us, so they don&#39;t need our house as a base...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now that we&#39;re not in it, they don&#39;t need to hold it,&quot; Jeff commented, &quot;as their efforts were to get us to become Slug People and to serve Cupple. They got the former but did not get the latter... and as such, they have no reason to really be involved with our house anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though they may go after our neighbors,&quot; Grace commented, &quot;most are on our side of the street... but there would be some others as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why were&#39; on our present mission to get help and can counter Cupple&#39;s magic,&quot; Lucy assured grace and let Grace to catch up to her while moving rest one arm around Grace&#39;s back, &quot;hopefully... it&#39;ll we&#39;ll get the help we need quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Grace answered her oldest sister and welcomed the physical comfort.<br />
<br />
They then continued to make their way through the town. Things remained calm and quiet as they slid along on their tails. There were occasionally some other people out on the sidewalk as they moved along, but despite their nudity, no one seemed to notice. Though, this was also something that had long been there with Slug People. Their slime tended to eat through clothing fibers and thus they didn&#39;t wear clothes, and on certain levels this was something that Lucy knew sat at the heart of many people having distrust of Slug People, that humans had to wear clothes while Slug People didn&#39;t be because they couldn&#39;t. Though, given their transformations into Slug People and how they were brought about, both Lucy and Jeff had the sense that some of the inherent defensive magic that had long protected Slug People as a species from eradication by humanity was a big part of why they&#39;d had no problem as they slid through town. They could only hope that things would get better as the town&#39;s Catholic church came into view.<br />
<br />
The church wasn&#39;t big or as ornate as many of the great cathedrals in Europe or even some of the bigger American cities, but it was well known as a sturdy brick building that was laid out in the shape of a cross. The Chapmans didn&#39;t often come here, as they&#39;d generally attended a protestant church that wasn&#39;t too far from where their home was, but Jeff had remembered going past it when he&#39;d go to and from college during their various breaks. It now felt a bit strange to him that he was coming there to look for help, but the actions that lead to him and his family turning into Slug People was such that the strangeness was not the focus on his mind. They found a lone man that was out pruning a set of bushes that were near the main entrance to the building. At first Jeff didn&#39;t think the man had noticed them, but as they approached him, the man spoke while he kept trimming the bushes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid there is no mass today,&quot; the man spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;You heard us?&quot; Whitney said in surprise.<br />
<br />
The man finished one last clip with his clippers and sending one part of the bush floating into the air and then landing on the sidewalk and in the shadow of one of Jeff&#39;s eye stalks. He turned and gave a bit of a startled gasp at seeing the five Slug People there on the sidewalk leading up to the building, but quickly recovered. He gave a polite smile as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call it a sixth sense of sorts,&quot; the man spoke, &quot;Father Moughlin, what brings you to my perish. Slug People tend to stay centered around their own village to the north of town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; Whitney spoke as she came forward, &quot;I&#39;m Whitney Chapman, these are my children. My son Jeff, his twin sister Lucy, then Zoe, and my youngest daughter, Grace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A pleasure to meet you, Ms. Chapman,&quot; Father Moughlin answered, &quot;I take it you fell in love with a human man, and he returned the affection?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Lucy spoke before Whitney could answer, &quot;our father was human and so were we! But these two Slug Women... Megan and Jenny, we never got a last name...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If they were born Slug People, they wouldn&#39;t have a last name,&quot; Father Moughlin answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless, they are either in league with or have been enslaved by a human sorcerer, Edward Cupple,&quot; Whitney spoke, &quot;and they exposed us to their magics at levels that we would transform into Slug People.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were hoping you might have some ideas on how to stop Cupple and whatever scheme he has,&quot; Jeff added, &quot;counter his magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Moughlin didn&#39;t immediately answer. He looked down and held his hedge clippers to his chest. For a moment it seemed like the man was about to offer them a way he could. However, his hands fell to his sides, and he looked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am afraid I cannot offer much more than sanctuary,&quot; Father Moughlin spoke, &quot;the Church has dealt with wizards dealing in black magic... and in that sense, I believe what you say. And all Catholic Churches and monasteries are properly consecrated, preventing any malevolent magics being used, but I cannot take more action than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t help us?!&quot; Lucy demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is not that I wouldn&#39;t want to help you,&quot; Father Moughlin answered, &quot;as to rob one of oneself against their will is a grave sin, but I can only give you what the church has told me about its interactions with Slug People and offer the protection of consecrated ground. But I have neither the skills nor the ability to go out an actively counter a sorcerer that would do this... and even if I did, I lack the legal authority to do so. Separation of Church and State and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, it&#39;s more that you can&#39;t help us...&quot; Jeff said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the way you&#39;re asking,&quot; Father Moughlin answered, &quot;some priests and holy orders are trained to counter sorcery and know how to use the white magic that God has gifted all, but most of them are all in bigger cities and locations that would be more obvious targets. My parish is too small for that. I could ask for help, but that might still require hard proof of this Edward Cupple&#39;s sorcery... and that would go beyond your transformations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they were forced on us!&quot; Grace pointed out, &quot;we know this violates what you and all churches believe in and what the Slug People govern themselves with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I agree when you say this,&quot; Father Moughlin nodded, &quot;and that is why I would offer you sanctuary and protection. But my superiors are not here, and they may choose not to believe your story. I am sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But couldn&#39;t you just state what has been done and point to that magic and otherworldly nature?&quot; Zoe demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could... but most Americans are Protestant,&quot; Father Moughlin spoke, &quot;and at the same time... even if they were Catholic, your country&#39;s legal system would prevent me from actively calling for an arrest without proof. And the city&#39;s police will probably have even less trust in &quot;magic&quot; than my superiors would.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thus, we&#39;d need concrete evidence,&quot; Zoe said slowly, &quot;aside from Cupple admitting it to us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we didn&#39;t record him admitting it,&quot; Lucy said to her sister, &quot;he&#39;d only deny it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoe only gave a defeated sigh at that and then looked up to Father Moughlin, &quot;and you really can&#39;t help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beyond sanctuary and shelter for the moment?&quot; Father Moughlin spoke, &quot;no... I will try to get in touch with my superiors in the Church and see if they can get in touch with the appropriate holy orders that may be able to help and investigate a bit deeper, but that would still take time. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</p>
