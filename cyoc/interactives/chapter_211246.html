<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There&#39;s no reason for you to deny it. No — it&#39;s more than that. You can&#39;t even deny the idea when Roy&#39;s smell is pushing all contrarian thoughts from your head. You&#39;ve smelled it before, and you are quite familiar with its hints. But somehow, it feels so new. It&#39;s better, it&#39;s enticing. You gulped as you approached Roy. You assume that you&#39;d be the only one to enjoy this, but your older brother has this smile on his face. He makes feeble attempts of hiding it, but you know better. Edward is not the only one with sick fetishes here. <br />
<br />
You raised your nose to his armpits. That minor scuffle made Edward a bit sweaty. And it seems he hasn&#39;t used a deodorant nor taken a bath since this morning. His smell hit you hard, like a punch to the gut. It reeks and your mind is compelling you to get away from the smell. But your body is speaking a different tune. You smelled it, let it fill your lungs with its musk. And in time, you began to lick it. Lucky for you, Roy kept his armpits cleanly shaven. <br />
<br />
&quot;E- Edward... I...&quot; Roy closed his eyes and let the pleasure take over his armpit. He knows it&#39;s not his brother, but it won&#39;t hurt to assume that he is. &quot;Mmmm... more...&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy unbuttoned his polo and wrapped his arms around his little brother. Edward used to be so little, so weak. But now? He nearly stands as tall as he is. He may remain thin, but his growth spurts have been kind over years. It&#39;s nice that with his best friend in control of Edward&#39;s body, he could get a closer look at his little brother&#39;s improvement over the years. <br />
<br />
You broke off the feast of Roy&#39;s armpit and moved upwards where your mouth met his neck. It&#39;s as delectable as the prior one. You sucked on his skin, feasted on the taste of flesh, and left faint hematomas in your wake. You wanted to feast on the other side but Roy guided your chin so you two can embrace in one sloppy kiss. You&#39;re amateurs to this, you both know that. You two don&#39;t know how to maneuver your tongues. And what makes it worse, is that Roy&#39;s bigger tongue doesn&#39;t give you many chances to discover his mouth. He invaded your mouth and blocked off the entrance. He wrapped around your tongue and made sure to let you taste his prior buttery breakfast. This would be your first kiss, and you didn&#39;t expect it to come from Roy. <br />
<br />
While this is happening, Roy maneuvered his hand to your bare pink nipples. His index danced around the areolas which made your nipples stand as hard as your dick. Then he played around it, pinching them while making circles. Since this is a virgin body, all tactile sensation feels novel. And being novel means... it&#39;s ah! You made broke off your kiss and made a quip. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah- are you alright?&quot; Roy asked. Unbelievable. Roy&#39;s pale face is as pink as strawberries. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s just... I didn&#39;t expect Edward&#39;s body to be this sensitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the novelty of being a young virgin. I still remember the day I lost mine. I was squealing like a pig.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that even relevant right now? Now, flip over.&quot;<br />
<br />
You wanted to pry further, but he&#39;s right. That is his business, and it&#39;s not important to the situation at hand. You&#39;re just wasting precious seconds that should have been pleasure-filled. You flipped over, with your ass pointed in Roy&#39;s direction. You lean back to see him lubing up his fingers with his saliva. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wh- what are you doing?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re already complaining about your nipples, how about you try this one for size?&quot; Roy slowly slid his thick finger up your asshole. It&#39;s just the index and it feels like you&#39;re already getting ripped apart. It filled you with heat and pain, and yet... he touched this pocket of flesh deep inside your asshole and it filled you with pleasure you could scarcely put into words. It made your knees weak. They barely gave up but your arms held steady ground. Roy inserted another finger and made them rotate at every angle possible. He hit that sweet spot again. And ah! Fuck! You&#39;re singing a choir of moans. Tears are pouring from your eyes because of the pain you&#39;re feeling. But you wanted more. You&#39;re hungry for more. <br />
<br />
There was a moment of calm when Roy pulled out his fingers from your asshole. But calm always precedes a storm. You looked behind you to see Roy getting his dick comfortable up your ass. The thing he was doing before, he&#39;s just loosening you up! Not like you should be complaining.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to put it inside,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Y- yes, please. Roy put your dick inside me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me big brother,&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t argue. &quot;Yes, b- big brother,&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy pushed his hips and held onto your sides for leverage. He was slick as he was quick. His dick slipped right in, uncaring for the screams of pain you made. You gasped a breath of air as bullets of sweat rained down from your head. You tried to breathe another, but... slap! The flesh of your hips came crashing together, his dick reaching farther distances inside of you. It hit that sweet spot like a truck and made you squeal like the pig that you are. You&#39;re really hungry for your big brother&#39;s cock, aren&#39;t you? <br />
<br />
A constant rhythm of slapping flesh chorused in the living room. Barely a minute passed before the two of your moans joined in. Roy keeps muttering Edward&#39;s name, with demands between each cycle about what he wants you to call him brother. For a moment, you seemed to believe it. That Roy is your older brother. At that moment, it made all of this seem so taboo. Incest between brothers? Isn&#39;t that shunned? You should be feeling bad, and yet, the sheer atrocity of it made it more exhilarating. You called him big brother, making sure to fool yourself that he really is one. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m— I&#39;m close, Edward...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As am I, big brother...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of your grit your teeth, and screamed in unison. Together, you&#39;ve reached your absolute climax. Seeds were spurred and minds were momentarily lost in the madness of pleasure. You could feel Roy&#39;s warm and thick semen empty inside your bowels. You feel it squirm around his dick. He continued to rail you senseless, and his movement became slicker with his dick more lubed up by his semen. As for your release, you made sure to catch most of your semen. You don&#39;t want to ruin their good sofa. Roy slowed down in his movements, before finally pulling out his dick. A small string of semen connected his dick and your ass, before finally breaking off.<br />
<br />
The two of you sat there on the sofa. Time passed without you two breaking a word. Roy stood up and hit the showers. What did you do next?</p>
