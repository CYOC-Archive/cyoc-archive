<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Sean Walker woke up in a prison cell inside the Moon Lake Police Department. He could hear someone talking just outside his cell. Two officers it sounded like, but he couldn’t make out what they were saying. <br />
<br />
“Maybe they’ll let me out soon. They can’t keep me here much longer. Maybe Johnson won’t come down.” Sean thought. He rolled over and sighed. His mind raced with questions, mostly about the small town. <br />
<br />
What was their secret? His theory about the town being radioactive was seeming more and more plausible. That, or this place was the sight for secret experiments that resulted in everyone looking like Greek gods and goddesses. <br />
<br />
Around the corner, Officer Ryan Connor and Chief Douglas Cooper were discussing their prisoner. Ryan told Cooper about what Walker asked him about last night. The news didn’t ease any of Cooper’s concerns. <br />
<br />
“Curiosity killed the cat.” Cooper thought, the irony of the situation taking away some of the stress. <br />
<br />
“What do you think we should do? We’ll have to let him go today, we don’t have much to hold him for. The only things we have against him are the items he took from the bureau without permission, and for trespassing on private property.” Ryan said. <br />
<br />
“Hopefully once Walker’s superiors get here they’ll be able to do something about Agent Walker. And maybe that’ll be the end of him.” Cooper said. <br />
<br />
“The items in his car, was there anything ‘incriminating’ in there?” Ryan asked. <br />
<br />
“Incriminating how?”<br />
<br />
“Well, did he see anything he shouldn’t have?” <br />
<br />
“Based on what he had with him, no. The camera we found didn’t have any pictures on it. And all the gear he had was legit. Granted taken from the FBI, but the guy is a fed. Nothing we can hold him on.” <br />
<br />
“No proof of US?” Cooper asked. <br />
<br />
“Nothing.” Ryan said, showing the chief the photos he’d taken earlier. Cooper looked them over, surveying the images of Walker’s car for anything that might suggest Moon Lake’s secret. He was relieved to see it just looked like the inside of a normal sedan. <br />
<br />
“Alright. I suppose we’ll just have to wait and see what the other agents say when they get here.” Cooper set the photos down and went to his office to make a call. Ryan remained outside to keep an eye on their “prisoner”. <br />
			---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Across town Martin Stovall was leaving for work when he got a phone call from the Moon Lake Police Department. He was hoping this wouldn’t have anything to do with recent events (i.e what he was calling the “Bower family invasion”). But as usual, the universe seemed to be against Martin’s wishes. <br />
<br />
“Yes?” <br />
<br />
“Hello sir. I hope this isn’t a bad time. I’ve got some news you’ll want to hear.” Cooper said. He could tell by Martin’s voice the mayor was stressed. Though about what he couldn’t say. He could only imagine how hard a job like Martin’s was (made all the more complicated with Alyssa’s arrival). <br />
<br />
“It’s always a bad time. But go on.” Martin sighed. <br />
<br />
While the chief filled him in, Melissa watched her husband on the phone from the kitchen window. Martin was outside his car, looking very worried. She wondered if it was that blonde bimbo who waltzed into her house yesterday. Melissa had to give Alyssa that, she had nerve. <br />
<br />
“Mom?” Melissa turned around and saw Julie ready for school. <br />
<br />
“You need a ride?” Melissa guessed. Julie nodded, and then asked if something was going on outside. Melissa knew it was pointless to lie, and told Julie her father was out there talking on the phone. <br />
<br />
“Oh. You don’t think it’s…”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t put it past him, or her.” Melissa said sourly. She was starting to be thankful she hadn’t shredded those legal papers after all. She might need them after all. Because as soon as Julie was out of the house, and on her way to college, Melissa wanted nothing to do with Martin. If he went back to his cheating ways, she was dropping him faster than you can drop a bowling ball on the Moon. <br />
<br />
“I know you’re angry at Dad, I’m a little upset too. But can’t you give him the benefit of the doubt. Yesterday, he really did seem surprised to see Alyssa. What if he’s telling the truth?” Julie asked. She didn’t want to see her parents split up.<br />
<br />
But then, Julie also understood her father’s side of things more so than her mother’s. Which was also why she’d decided to go without underwear today. Thankfully her mom was too preoccupied to notice. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know anymore. I can’t trust him.” Melissa said bluntly. She told Julie to wait for her while she went to get her keys. But Melissa slipped upstairs and to her bedroom window so she could hear what Martin was saying. <br />
<br />
“…alright, I’ll be over in ten minutes…. Don’t worry about my meeting, this is more important. When did you say Agent Johnson would be here?… And Agent Walker is cooperating? Good, I’ll see you in a bit Doug.” Martin then hung up and got into his car. <br />
<br />
Melissa took a moment to wonder what that call was about. She was relieved it wasn’t about Alyssa. But why was Martin talking to Douglas Cooper? Was something wrong? He’d mentioned two agents, maybe there was another situation. <br />
<br />
“Have I been too hard on Martin? Maybe Julie’s right. Maybe this time Martin’s not the guilty party. Still, what are we going to do about Alyssa?” she thought. <br />
<br />
“Mom? Dad’s gone now.” Julie called from downstairs. <br />
<br />
“Alright, be right down!” Melissa called back. Pushing thoughts of Martin from her head for the time being, she went back downstairs to take Julie to school.</p>
