<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Honaka was a bit nervous as she approached the Horizon Building for her own conversion. A lot of it related to her own condition, in that while her situation had not been as bad as Jen&#39;s had been before her conversion, she was burdened with a pair of over-sized breasts that weren&#39;t quite typical for anyone. She&#39;d managed some research online and found that the average Human woman was in the B to C cup range at the largest. In this, those with anything larger were rarer, and in her case especially rare. Though that rarity was not something she actually liked.<br />
<br />
Her large breasts gave her back pain from time to time trying to support their weight and a fair number of boys that she&#39;d gone to high school with had rather openly joked that she wouldn&#39;t be good for much more than certain types of entertainment. And while she had worked hard to demonstrate she could overcome the impediments her chest gave her with regard to archery or that her mind was not &quot;harmed&quot; by the weights on her chest, that didn&#39;t stop people from making jokes. Jokes that she did not like, for despite her build, she had her pride and had no interest in being the next Hitomi Tanaka. And that had driven much of her drive to remove that issue...<br />
<br />
And ultimately Animalia had presented that option. For while Animalian females were known for having rather curvy bodies and an average chest size of a D to E cup bra, she had noticed that outside of the Sauropod Dinotopians, non-mammal Animalians were on the smaller end of that curve. Some might be in the large C cup range or only just fit into a D cup bra. That was something that made her more interested, as it would essentially mean that it would be likely that her present chest would get smaller in becoming an Animalian. She might not shrink down to the same size that most of the bird Animalians, but she would accept having a smaller chest than what she had now.<br />
<br />
The nervousness, though, was more in that her knowledge of English was somewhat limited. She could manage a bit of conversation and the paperwork thanks to some English/Japanese dictionaries, though they didn&#39;t necessarily cover grammatical issues that she&#39;d had to work from memory on. She&#39;d done okay on the forms, but still had some nervousness that her weakness in English or her build might create problems. However as she came into the Horizon building, she found some relief and a slight surprise. Waiting for her was a Red Crowned Crane Animalian in the waiting area.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Ms. Metsui, Honaka,&quot; the Red Crowned Crane Animalian spoke slowly, using her tongue to compensate for the lack of flexibility in her beak, &quot; I am Yurikazi, Maho and I was told you wished to be a Red Crowned Crane...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re Japanese!&quot; Honaka spoke in shock in her own language and recognizing that Maho had spoke in Japanese.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Maho answered, &quot;my daughters and I converted quite some time ago now and we&#39;ve wished to help were we can. And should you need a translator, I can help with that... and since I am already a Red Crowned Crane Animalian, things could be managed that you would not need shots should you not wish to have them for your conversion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m okay with shots... but non shots...?&quot; Honaka wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The vaccine in my system would be countered and I would offer you some of my milk, and THAT is how you would join Animalia,&quot; Maho answered, &quot;it is one of the options provided... obviously in a controlled environment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Honaka nodded, understanding the rules that played into Animalian conversions and that Maho was as well curved as any other Animalian. She also knew that all Animalian females over the age of 17 years were always lactating, regardless of pregnancy. Animals not used in dairy production might not lactate as much as those that were used in dairy production, but it was still something that was well known. From Honaka&#39;s research into the news reports, how that happened was an unknown. There were some theories on that much of the Animalia Virus being created in relation to work with the Brown farm and its cattle, thus allowing for higher meat yields and more nutritious milk without added hormones, but that didn&#39;t explain how other bovine features entered into the new Animalian species or why those new Animalians took on a more Human-like form, despite the fact that reports indicated that Human DNA was never used in the testing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine with shots,&quot; Honaka said after a moment, &quot;but I wouldn&#39;t mind having some one to talk to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Maho replied with a nod, the tip of her bill going up and down as she did so.<br />
<br />
With that they went in and went through the process of helping Honaka finish Horizon&#39;s paperwork. She managed to do okay with the English she knew and what the forms required, but there were a moment or two where the secretaries asked questions in a way that Honaka was a bit uneasy with. Maho was able to explain the meaning of the statement to her and they were able to progress forward. Honaka was glad for that and insisted on letting Maho come along when an Orangutan Animalian in a lab coat came for her. She was then lead to a private room for her transformation and the shots were administered.<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t hurt, but the effect was practically immediate as Honaka began to feel warmer. In some places under her clothing, things began to itch a little bit, and she assumed that was dealing with the first feathers beginning to grow in, which would largely be white for the Red Crowned Crane. The red was largely from the patch above the eyes with black feathers covering the neck along edges of the wings. The rest of the bird was covered in white feathers. Honaka was quick to begin removing her attire, if only to see and witness her changes, though there would also be the need to allow for room for her wings. The Red Crowned Crane was a bird, and one that could fly. In this, she knew she would grow wings on her back that would complicate things with regard to the bra she had on, regardless of its cup size. She couldn&#39;t have her wings pinned against her back.<br />
<br />
As she got her shirt off and unfastened the K cup bra she wore, while she could see white feathers growing out from her skin, she could also see beads of sweat running down her breasts. It wasn&#39;t milk, as it was clear and wasn&#39;t coming from her nipples, but the sweating did seem to shrink her breasts, if only slightly. As this went on, the sweat seemed to mix in with her growing feathers, which lead to a smell she didn&#39;t like much. She walked from the bed toward a mirror that hung on a nearby wall, listening as the bones in her feet cracked shifted to become the three toed feet. Her neck stretched upward a little bit. When she reached the mirror, she looked into it and noted the changes so far.<br />
<br />
Her forearms and legs had the grayish-black skin that the Red Crowned Crane normally had on its legs and a decent coat of white feathers were covering her. They were particularly thick on her arms, shoulders, stomach, and waist. Flexing a few muscles, Honaka could even see  her growing tail feathers spread out behind her. It was on her breasts where her growing feathers were a bit thinner and for the moment were a bit matted because of all the sweat, but based on what she could see Honaka felt that the prime goal she&#39;d looked for was achieved. Her breasts were still big, even for an Animalian, but they had shrunk from a K cup down to a G cup and were perfectly round and firm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Honaka said to herself as her lips began stiffen, &quot;it&#39;s not perfect... but it is better... and hopefully these won&#39;t weigh me down...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her words became a bit slower as at the same time, her bill began to push forward. Her lips hardened and merged into her teeth and jaw bones in the process. Honaka could see it in the mirror pushing forward from just below the red patch of feathers, even if they were mostly obscured by her human hair, which was still there. The beak pushed out until it became a sharp point and would be unbending, as a bird&#39;s beak was. She&#39;d seen the consequence of those transformations. Uplifted birds and converted bird Animalians often talked slower than other Animalians, often because that hard beak couldn&#39;t move in the same way a person&#39;s lips could move. This meant that Bird Animalians and Pterosaur Animalians, like Sophie and Roland, had to compensate for this by using their tongues and this slowed their speech, and tremendously at first.<br />
<br />
But to a certain extent, Honaka didn&#39;t care about that for the moment. And as her wings began to grow out from her back and spread out, she lifted her head and smiled a bit. For the biggest thing that she&#39;d converted for had been achieved. Yes, her breasts were still big, but now they&#39;d be counter balanced by her wings while standing and at the same time the were smaller than they were before on her. Which meant the issues provided by their weight were no longer there, or at least wouldn&#39;t be to the same degree. Being a bit less top heavy was something she wanted and she didn&#39;t need something as risky as surgery.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; Honaka cheered to herself.</p>
