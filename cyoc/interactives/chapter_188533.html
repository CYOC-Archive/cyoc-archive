<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the next few days Gloria, Caleb, and there friends met and worked together, often times meeting at the comic book shop where Diane and Naomi worked. During these meetings Caleb and Duke shared as much info as they could. Quickly it became apparent, they were going to need help.<br />
<br />
It was finally decided that not only would Gloria bring her sister Katie in, but that they would meet up at the Moreland home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we really need to go to their house,&quot; Duke asked nervously. Gloria turned from her spot in Katie&#39;s car, seeing the nervous expression on the half vampires face. &quot;Dont worry Duke,&quot; Gloria reassured. &quot;Caleb already told his family about you and Katie is here too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus ill be here,&quot; Sasha stated as she grasped Dukes hand. Duke turned giving Sasha a warm smile. Gloria of course couldn&#39;t help but notice how close the two were growing. Duke was definitely Sashas type. Quiet, thoughtful, and intelligent the damphir also had many of the same interests as Sasha. From music to movies to wrestling the teen couple not only complimented eachother they covered eachothers weaknesses.<br />
<br />
For Gloria though she found her relationship situation to be quite e different. Caleb was confident without being arrogant. Incredibly skilled and charismatic and amazingly attractive. Gloria felt her face flush just thinking of the teenage hunter. Shoulder length hair that Gloria thought was even better than hers not to mention a body like a Greek God. Gloria remembered all to well how she had gawked at Caleb when the teen had come by Felicias pool, she didn&#39;t think someone could have an actual six pack of abs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well here it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria shook herself from her daydreaming as she watched Cakebs home. The Morelands appeared to have bought two story home in a more secluded part of town. Already it appeared Mrs. Moreland had put her touches on the home. A recent paint job and some flowers made the small home appear like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting.<br />
<br />
&quot;This place is so cute,&quot; Katie fawned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tigers are cute too til they attack,&quot; Duke grumbled as he warily gazed at the Moreland home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry Duke I already told my folks about you,&quot; Caleb stated. &quot;Trust me you&#39;ll be safe here.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the group now approached Gloria and Katie paused. The two wizards sensing a great deal of protective magic surrounding the property. &quot;My folks take alot of precautions,&quot; Caleb said. &quot;So if you&#39;re sensing something its just that.&quot; As the group now approached the front door, they were surprised as a young boy with a mop of dirty blond hair open it. <br />
<br />
&quot;You guys with Caleb,&quot; the boy asked, his face forming in a scowl as he glared at Duke. &quot;We don&#39;t serve vampires around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey we got an invite,&quot; Sasha exclaimed. &quot;So beat it shrimp!&quot; As Sasha now glared the preteen she was shocked to see a massive presence now appear behind him. Sashas eyes now went wide as she gawked at a living Amazonian marble statue. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who you calling shrimp? Shrimp.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang it Connor,&quot; Caleb groaned. &quot;You knew about Duke. Now stop being a pest and call of Daphne.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daphne,&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shes a golem,&quot; Caleb stated. &quot;A couple years back dad rescued Jewish family from a djinn. As a token of appreciation they gifted us a protective golem. She&#39;s kinda my kid brothers nanny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and Gloria now studied the living statue. She was probably about 7 1/2 feet tall, her body sculpted to give her the appearance of an Amazon warrior. The golem body possessing rippling muscles, shoulder length hair that somehow seemed to move and massive breasts that appeared bigger than their heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; Naomi gushed, rushing forward to take a closer look at the golem. &quot;So does she possess any supernatural powers or anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can bench press a school bus,&quot; Daphne shrugged, unsure of what to make of these wizards. &quot;Now you coming in or what? Not trying to let the bugs in. And don&#39;t forget to wipe your feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Entering the home Gloria and the others now inspected the home, Katie admiring the country motif Mrs. Moreland. As they entered the kitchen the group now noticed a woman in her late 40s. The woman was sporting a floor length dress, giving her an almost stereotypical farmers wife appearance with her sandy brown hair tied in a bun. &quot;Hello I&#39;m Caleb&#39;s mom,&quot; Nina Moreland smiled. &quot;Why don&#39;t cha take a seat, dinner is almost ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom what about the vampire,&quot; Connor stated. Sasha immediately glared at the preteen as both Duke and Caleb groaned in annoyance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now stop that Connor,&quot; Nina replied firmly. &quot;The boy did nothing wrong.&quot; Nina now approached giving Duke a warm smile as she guided him to the table. &quot;Poor thing,&quot; she said softly. &quot;You&#39;re just skin and bones.&quot; Nina now presented a plate of food to Duke, the damphirs mouth salivating as the smell wafted into his nose. &quot; Chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, and cornbread. Just let me know if you want seconds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina now called everyone to the table, Gloria and Caleb watching as a small nude fairy sailed into kitchen, taking a seat at a doll sized table, setup on the actual kitchen table. &quot;Grub smells great Nina,&quot; Spark exclaimed. &quot;Whats for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes,&quot; Nina stated. &quot;Jacob on his way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hes just cleaning up,&quot; Spark said as she shoveled her meal into her mouth. <br />
<br />
As the everyone now sat, Gloria couldn&#39;t help but feel completely comfortable in the cozy home of the Morelands. Nina Moreland appeared to try and keep things incredibly normal, which seemed impossible considering a fairy, a golem, and the skull of an immortal skeleton warrior sat with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good see everybody&#39;s here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria and her friends turned, watching as the 50 year old Jacob now entered. Removing his cowboy hat, Jacob groaned before placing a skull next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it,&quot; Gloria asked apprehensively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vampire skull,&quot; Jacob replied non chalantly. &quot;Ever since Duke told yall about coming to town I&#39;ve been clearing out nests. Found this one holed up at an old factory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How many nests have you found,&quot; Duke asked, paling slightly as he stared at the skull.<br />
<br />
&quot;Four in the last few days,&quot; Jacob said softly. &quot;The vamps been busy. Chances are I&#39;ve only scratched thw surface. Kinda why I needed ta meet the wizard that took down, what was his name? Villar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah that was me,&quot; Katie replied sheepishly. Jacob nodded, studying the young woman carefully. &quot;Heard a rumor,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;Heard you had something special from Merlin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded, surprised that Jacob would know she had Excalibur. &quot;Got my sources,&quot; Jacob answered, gesturing to Jim. &quot;After what went down last year the supernatural world was talking. Lotta rumors mostly, lotta demons and cut rate villains saying they saw it. Still, even the most outlandish rumors got a shred of truth. Just wanna see for myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie simply nodded, taking a deep breath before summoning forth the mystical blade Excalibur. &quot;Well the rumors are true,&quot; she said. &quot;As you can see the sword is mine. Still getting used to it though, it takes alot out of me to use.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob nodded, thanking Katie as she now returned the sword to its resting place. &quot;I appreciate you showing me,&quot; Jacob said. &quot;Excalibur is a holy weapon, perfect for taking out vampires. And we have a lot of then to deal with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re that worried,&quot; Nina asked. Jacob nodded, glancing down at the skull by his side. &quot;Miro is mart enough to only go after those that aren&#39;t going to be missed,&quot; he said. &quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean those that are turned are smart. This guy here is 4th generation, means he&#39;s four steps removed from Miro. Vamps don&#39;t get that bold until their numbers are up. The one that sired him was sloppy too. This guy here happened to pop up in a missing persons report, business man was reported missing yesterday. This was him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and Gloria nodded as the others studied Jacobs grim expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said rumor has it Miro wants to turn a wizard,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;Miro ain&#39;t gonna try to make a move against anyone you til his numbers are close to 1000.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;1000,&quot; Felicia exclaimed. &quot;Geez how many are their right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say they number in the hundreds,&quot; Jacob stated as he rubbed his chin. &quot;And while tall seem pretty capable worry about any youngins. Heard theirs a few of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded, her throat going dry at the thought of the kids being in danger. &quot;So what do you want us to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Need your help in doing what I do best,&quot; Jacob smiled. &quot;Hunting vampires.&quot;</p>
