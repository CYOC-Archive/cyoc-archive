<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Spark and Connor nervously watched as Calista entered with her family. She, along with her husband and daughter offering the teens a warm smile as the pair studied them carefully.<br />
<br />
Mitch was tall, perhaps a shade under six feet tall but surprisingly thin. Sporting wild dark brown hair, a slight sunburn, glasses and a full beard, the man appeared to be in his mid to late thirties. By his side Spark and Connor noticed their daughter Maggie. The precocious 5 year old wearing a purple dress that matched her mother&#39;s hair and a pair of light brown pigtails. Maggie excitedly waved to both her parents and the teens before sprinting to the counter. Spark and Connor noticing the lights in her sneakers blinking with each excited step.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark, Connor, so glad you could make it,&quot; Calista smiled. &quot;This is my husband Mitch and our daughter Maggie.&quot; The teens offered a polite wave, Connor noticing Mitch appeared somewhat shy as he gave the pair an awkward smile. &quot;Mommy, Mommy,&quot; Maggie called excitedly. &quot;Can I get a brownie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course sweetie,&quot; Calista answered. &quot;Mitch why don&#39;t you talk with Spark and Connor while I get our order.&quot; Mitches eyes bulged, the man looking to argue before Calista drifted off to the counter with Maggie. Taking a seat, the man now fidgeted as he stared at Connor and Spark. &quot;So...you&#39;re friends with Calista?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah we went to school together,&quot; Spark replied, Mitch casting the teen a curious look before Spark replied. &quot;I know don&#39;t look like it. It&#39;s complicated. Anyway, Mitch this is Connor my boyfriend.&quot; Connor now extended his hand, the two shaking hands as Sparknow studied the man carefully. &quot;So Mitch,&quot; Spark asked. &quot;I take it you&#39;ve never meet any of Calista&#39;s friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No can&#39;t say that I have,&quot; Mitch replied, sheepishly rubbing his neck. &quot;Honestly, she never really talks about...um...back home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you do,&quot; Connor asked, trying to find a subject that Mitch would possibly be more comfortable with. &quot;Oh I&#39;m an oceanographer,&quot; Mitch stated, feeling a bit more at ease to talk about his job than his wives heritage. &quot;I&#39;ve been studying the sound and the Atlantic Ocean for years now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Connor stated. &quot;What does that entail?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Migration habits of sharks,&quot; Mitch began. &quot;Ocean currents and temps, fish population, pollution levels in the environment, I actually had a paper published recently on the resurgence of the bluefish population.&quot; Connor and Spark nodded, offering a polite smile to Mitch&#39;s statement. It may not have seemed very interesting to them but it at least made Mitch more comfortable. &quot;So what about you,&quot; Mitch asked. &quot;What do you two do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Connors from a family if demon hunters,&quot; Spark stated. &quot;As for me, well, I&#39;m his brothers partner.&quot; Mitch balked, a befuddled look crossing the man&#39;s face as he looked to Spark. &quot;I&#39;m sorry did you say demon hunters?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark,&quot; Calista called. &quot;So glad you and Connor could come.&quot; As Calista now sat with her daughter, passing out drinks, her husband appeared relieved to have his wife present by his side. &quot;Did you two have any trouble getting here,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No it was a smooth ride,&quot; Connor stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy, Daddy,&quot; Maggie asked between bites of her brownie. &quot;Who are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maggie this is mommy&#39;s friend Spark and her boyfriend Connor,&quot; she said. Maggie nodded, leaning in closer to look the two teens over before lowering her voice to ask another question. &quot;Are they the secret word?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Secret word,&quot; Connor and Spark asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark is Maggie but not Connor,&quot; Calista replied before turning to the two teens. &quot;Maggie knows that I&#39;m....a bit different. I had to explain to her that she can&#39;t go telling everyone what I am exactly so we came up with secret word.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just out of curiosity,&quot; Connor asked. &quot;Has Maggie here shown any signs of being, the um, secret word?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No not really,&quot; Mitch shrugged. &quot;She does have a sweet tooth like her mom and she loves being outdoors. Other than that though nothing out of the ordinary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the sweet tooth makes sense,&quot; Spark shrugged. &quot;I know I&#39;ve developed a taste for slushies over the past year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god slushies are the best,&quot; Calista exclaimed. &quot;On our second date Mitch bought me one. It was so good I asked for a second and a third!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then doubled over with the worst case of brain freeze I&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; Mitch smirked. Connor and Spark now chuckled as Calista blushed, playfully elbowing her husband as the couples now began to talk.<br />
<br />
***************************<br />
<br />
As the portal began to open inside of S.P.E.A.Rs office, Sarah and Jacob waited patiently, watching as a small group now exited.  Standing before them was Duke and two vampires dressed in Victorian gowns. &quot;Cassandra, Duchess,&quot; Sarah asked, to which the vampires nodded. &quot;My name is Sarah McMillan, Director of S.P.E.A.R. thank you for coming on such short notice. Please, right this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassandra and Duchess nodded, the teenage vampires eyes now resting on the retired hunter. &quot;So what Duke was saying was true,&quot; she said. &quot;Human governments are establishing an agency to deal with the supernatural. I take it Jacob is your...right hand man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More like the ...father of all this,&quot; Jacob countered, the two old enemies exchanging murderous looks at one another for the verbal slights. &quot;Cassandra,&quot; Sarah stated, trying to remain diplomatic. &quot;Mr. Moreland is an advisor. What we&#39;re trying to do is establish diplomatic ties with various supernatural communities. To avoid any, unnecessary conflicts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Wyatt mentioned something to that effect,&quot; Cassandra stated. &quot;As my Lord&#39;s ambassador I shall honor his request in meeting with you Director.&quot; Sarah nodded, guiding the pair of vampires towards a conference room. As the vampires traveled they could see that S.P.E.A.R was slowly beginning to take shape.<br />
<br />
Various agents were now milling about the office building. Cassandra noticing large crates containing office supplies, computer equipment, and weapons that were unfamiliar to her. &quot;Sorry about the mess,&quot; Sarah stated. &quot;We&#39;re still settling in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you met with any of the other families,&quot; Cassandra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you&#39;re the first,&quot; Sarah replied. &quot;Hopefully the next time we see eachother we&#39;re up and running.&quot; Cassandra nodded, a sense of pride washing over her. For too long the vampire nation had been ignored, that the American governments first act would be to pursue diplomatic ties with the vampire nation would greatly enhance their reputation. Regardless of whatever else happened, she had little doubt Lord Wyatt would be pleased to hear this news. As they now entered a conference room, Cassandra and Duchess beheld a young Asian woman waiting for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duchess Jenkins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Duchess replied, casting the young woman a curious look. &quot;My name is Michelle Wong,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ve been looking for you.&quot; Duchess raised an eyebrow, watching as the young agent now reached into her coat pocket producing a picture. Slowly the vampire now approached, gazing down at a picture of herself and another young woman that seemed familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her name is Wanda Jenkins,&quot; Michelle said softly. &quot;She and I are close friends. You might say she&#39;s my best friend. She also happens to be your little sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duchess gazed at the picture of the smiling women. There was a faint sense of familiarity with the photo, the vampire trying to root through the memories of this body in hopes of remembering some sort of emotional connection. &quot;She looks familiar,&quot; Duchess said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I talk with Wanda all the time,&quot; Michelle continued. &quot;When her sister, you, disappeared last year she was despondent. I promised I would try to find you, hopefully bring you back alive.&quot; Duchess sadly shook her head, sighing as she gazed down at the photo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Silly girl,&quot; Cassandra sighed, shaking her head. &quot;The Duchess Jenkins that was this girl&#39;s sister is gone. Didn&#39;t the Moreland tell you that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress if I may,&quot; Duchess said softly. Cassandra paused, casting the woman a curious look before bowing her head solemnly. &quot;Michelle,&quot; Duchess said, a sad expression on her face. &quot;Unfortunately your friend Wanda&#39;s sister is gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re not gone your standing right here,&quot; Michelle exclaimed, her eyes beginning to fill with tears behind her glasses. &quot;No Michelle I am,&quot; she stated. &quot;Duchess Jenkins, the one Wanda knew is gone. I am what is left.&quot; Michelle bit her lip, she didn&#39;t want to believe what Duchess was saying. Surprisingly the vampire now approached, placing a comforting hand on the womans shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may not be Duchess Jenkins anymore,&quot; she said softly, a small grin spreading across her vampiric face. &quot;But, I remember how much she cared for this Wanda. She is very fortunate to have a friend like you.&quot; Michelle sniffed, her head hung low as she now whispered a question. &quot;What do I tell her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell her her sister died peacefully,&quot; Duchess stated sadly. &quot;Our people can arrange for a body to be returned to Wanda and her family. It would have to be a closed casket but they would at least find closure and, I think for the Jenkins family they would be able to find some measure of peace from that.&quot; Michelle simply nodded, the vampire now turning from Michelle as she looked to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and Michelle,&quot; Duchess called. &quot;Keep an eye out for Wanda, for me. She&#39;s very lucky to have a friend that cares about her this much.&quot; Michelle nodded, the vampire giving the agent a small smile as she now exited the room.</p>
