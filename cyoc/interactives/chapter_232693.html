<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyra looked at the plate of cooked meat and freshly picked apples and roasted vegetables and salivated at the tasty food that was being served for dinner. An entire day to play and explore the village was a nice treat after waking up from her transformation into a Sorraia centaur filly. Even in the setting sun obscured by clouds, her dirty brown fur, with auburn mane and tail had a glossy sheen to it as she walked to the table she and the other fillies have taken for themselves; despite being adopted in the morning after breakfast, the girls did feel a kinship and a need to stick together. That doesn’t mean though that a few have been stealing looks towards where the colts were sitting and eating their dinner. Despite being yearlings, Kyra noticed seeing Maggie continuing to let her eyes wander to where Tim was sitting; sensing that the two might be forming a bond already, Kyra had to admit she was glancing towards the boys. Letting her eyes lingering along Adam’s Abaco Barb equine torso as she slowly trail towards his more buff physique. While he may still be a teenager in the middle of puberty just like her, Kyra couldn’t deny the fact the both her hearts beat heavy with yearning as she continues to stare.<br />
<br />
“This is different,” Beth examining the meat she just tasted; looking at the portion on her fork as she compares it to the rabbit and buck that is also on her plate. “It has a gamey taste to it,” the Latino Dales filly trying to figure out what it is.<br />
“Its black bear,” Maggie answering; the zebra taur with curly red hair biting into a carrot; telling everyone that the former deputy was the one who fought and killed a bear as it ran after Malcolm. Noticing Beth making a surprised gasp and seeing the centaur looking at Caspian Centaur colt. “It’s a bit fatty,” Maggie taking a bite of the meat; “and it tastes okay.”<br />
“You must be happy Kyra,” Beth looking at the oldest of the girl scouts now a centaur filly; “what with your Muslim faith.” <br />
“Just because I abstain from pork,” Kyra sighing as she is getting tired of this conversation the Beth likes to start; “doesn’t mean I pray five times a day and view dogs as unclean. My grandparents are that extreme,” Kyra putting down her fork; “my parents, act like broken wild steeds.”<br />
<br />
Aiko and Helios were not sitting far from the foals. They sat down after cooking the food and helping putting it out on the buffet tables letting everyone serve themselves. Despite being next to Ben as he tells Lucy how he witnessed Josephine kill the bear they were feasting on. The shire centaur mare was more focused on listening to what Kyra was say. Explaining that her parents were forced into an arraigned marriage back in Iran; while it was a loveless union, it wasn’t abusive or hostile. That hatred Krya sensed was more directed to her grandparents for forcing them into the union that neither wanted. Soon they fled Iran during a crackdown of political descent. First arriving in Italy and then France as refugees; they won some sort of lottery and soon got fast tracked for immigration to America.<br />
“Mom and Dad soon stopped going to mosques and praying constantly, now that they were no longer under their parent’s thumb. While they didn’t separate, they didn’t exactly stay together,” Aiko listens a Kyra talks to the other filles.<br />
<br />
“Ben why are you still wearing that watch?” Amanda interrupting the Trakehner centaur from adding embellishments to his story; “it’s not as if it will keep accurate time here.” Amanda referring to the fact the day is thirty hours long and the watch is designed to keep time on a twelve hour day/night cycle.<br />
“I suppose its for sentimental purposes,” Ben looking at the time piece and giving up try to adjust it; seeing the sundial at the village square did give him some comfort at being able to tell time. But the sundial was only good if the skies were clear. Being overcast since afternoon did make it difficult to tell time, for the centaur stallion. “I guess now it’s nothing more than a simple bit of jewelry.”<br />
“Oh that reminds me,” Lucy smacking her forehead; “I had an appointment to get my ears pierced. Guess I’ll have to go without, unless someone here know how to do it.”<br />
“Ask Zoey,” Chris keeping silent during the exchange; only chiming in as he picked out a tiny bone he had in his portion of rabbit meat. “Zoey did Jenny’s ears if I recall. I think she can hoop you up,” Chris chuckling at the thought of Lucy galloping around with ear rings dangling about.<br />
<br />
Josephine slowly ate her meal. Taking care to not inhale, despite being hungry; the nakota mare did feel like she earned this feast. Having to kill a bear to keep it from hurting Malcolm or worse; it made most of the centaurs look at her in a new light. Instead of a mare to scorn behind her back, while pitying her; they now saw her as someone who was willing to put life and limb on the line to protect the foals. Realizing that was what she did, when she was a male and barged into the church armed; a few offered silent prayers to Epona to forgive her actions as, while they were wrong; the actions were meant to protect and if necessary fight for the children. While it won’t change her back, the prayers may help ease her mind and make her more comfortable being female.<br />
<br />
“Penny for your thoughts?”<br />
Josephine looks up and sees the Russian Don with the human torso of a Samoan standing across from her and placing his plate of food on the table as he sits down.<br />
“Is that the right phrase to say for when you see someone in deep thought;” the centaur looking at the mare and noticing her frozen look. “Are you okay,” the stallion looking concerned; seeing Josephine’s checks getting flushed and her breathing becoming deep and forceful.<br />
“I’m fine, Rasputin,” Josephine exhaling; seeing the stallion brought forth those feelings and desires that still confuse her still male mind. Knowing her body is screaming to be mounted and claimed by the virile stallion sitting in front of her. Instead of being horrified like she was in the morning, these feelings felt less intense; but still strong. She thought of the stallion’s earlier words, that she would be the one to make the first move. That move being romantic, leading up to them coupling and climaxing in carnal bliss; Josephine wondered if that would be soon or later tonight, after the sun has fully set.<br />
“Just trying to sort out my emotions,” the nakota centaur going back to picking at her meal.<br />
“I heard about your excitement,” Rasputin biting into one of the turnips Aiko harvested as she tilled one of the fields for a crop of corn. “Fighting a bear,” Rasputin eying the dental floss stitches on her left arm. “Quite the brave and selfless act,” the stallion sampling the gamey protein that was cooked over an open fire; “it tastes interesting, not unlike some of the meat I had last night.”<br />
“You’d think if I’d talk to Epona at the church,” Josephine thinking on Maggie’s words a few hours prior; “that she would listen to me? Would she be warm and welcoming to me like she has with everyone else?”<br />
“I don’t see why not,” the Samoan centaur answering back; “from what I have heard from the other members of the Haras, Epona wants us to be happy and to multiply.”<br />
“Even for someone like me who waved a gun in her church and called her an offensive name,” Josephine cutting her carrots into more manageable pieces before eating them; “I was once a man. Now I’m a mare.”<br />
“And a lovely looking mare you are,” Rasputin answering; noticing the flush of arousal building in her as he complimented her looks. “Why not finish eating your meal and we can walk to the church afterwards.”<br />
“I think its best if I stick around,” Josephine watching Chris getting up to help Starlight who was resting in barn being escorted out with Zoey and Pegasus in tow. Steve not being far behind as the Percheron draft centaur was bare chested; giving his shirt to Starlight so the newest Arabian-Berber centaur mare had a bit of modesty as they made their way to the communal dining area for a plate of food and happy company.<br />
“I don’t want to be accused of flaking out again,” Josephine noticing Sarah now the dun-colored Nordestino centaur mare she was hoping to become eating a double helping of meats and roasted vegetables with Jessica next to her and also a centaur mare. Wondering if Epona did cure Sarah of the cancer currently growing in her body. “Plus the remaining horses have yet to change,” the Nakota mare chewing through the bear meat; “Most if not everyone will want to talk to me and ask me to describe what I was thinking of when I fought the bear. Plus I need to talk to,” Josephine rambling off another statement before Rasputin placed his hand over Josephine; staring into her eyes.<br />
“Make time for yourself,” Rasputin doing his best to be comforting despite knowing his touch is most likely driving the mare mad with lust; “Tell them you would like a few minutes alone at the church. I’m certain will give you that,” Rasputin smiling as he notices Josephine’s breathing becoming labored and intense.</p>
