<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gail fidgetedin place, not wanting to undergo a makeover this evening.  While the idea of watching Yurikoperform magic, the auburn haired teen had another idea. One that would take thw focus off of her.&quot;Neela should text Ewart,&quot;<br />
<br />
A pillow now sailed through the air, striking Gail in the face. &quot;Shut up Gail,&quot; Neela replied nervously. All focus now trained on the Indian teen as she blushed crimson. Gail could only smirk as she no longer found herself the center of attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should totally text Ewart Neela,&quot; Stella exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; Pam added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry who is Ewart,&quot; Yuriko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neela&#39;s best friend,&quot; Gail stated. &quot;And she has a HUGE crush on him.&quot; Neela frowned, launching yet another pillow in Gail&#39;s direction as the teens giggled. &quot;Ewart,&quot; Abolith asked between bites if pizza. &quot;That skinny child that hangs around you four?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He went through a growth spurt,&quot; Neela replied. &quot;And he&#39;s not that skinny anymore. He&#39;s in really good shape, his voice stopped cracking, he&#39;s starting to look kinda cute....&quot; Neela sighed, trailing off as she now began to think of the boy she had know since they were 6 years old. It didn&#39;t make sense, how could she think of the goofy kid who used to be afraid if the dark as cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;See totally crushing on him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neela frowned, furrowing her brow as she glared at Gail. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you guys rather see Yuki cast a spell,&quot; Neela offered. &quot;I mean Gail was adorable when she was six. I mean, wouldn&#39;t it be cool to relive our first sleepover again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your desperate Neela,&quot; Pam smirked. &quot;Just text him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Neela groaned, her shoulders slumping. It made no sense, Ewart was her best friend, why was she so nervous. Tentatively she now took out her cellphone, typing a message to Ewart before hitting send. &quot;What did you say,&quot; Stella asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi what you doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before anyone could ask, Neela&#39;s phone beeped, the teen gathering close as they all read Ewarts response. &quot;Hes watching a game,&quot; Gail stated. &quot;With Robbie and Darren?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t realize the Catalyst considered this boy a friend,&quot; Abolith shrugged. The teens now waited, watching as Neela texted back and forth, explaining their plans for the evening. After a few moments they learned of the teenage prodigies plans, as well as the Catalyst and his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like Ewart invited them over to watch a basketball game,&quot; Neela said. &quot;Ewart bought a new holo TV and wanted to show it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should totally go over there,&quot; Pam exclaimed.  The others balked, Gail&#39;s eyes going wide in fear. &quot;Are you nuts,&quot; she hissed. &quot;My mom would kill me if I snuck out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can actually help with that,&quot; Yuriko offered. &quot;I can cast a sleeping spell. Your parents would fall asleep and be none the wiser. They would never know we were gone and we wouldn&#39;t be that long.&quot; Now it was both Neela and Gail who seemed uncomfortable. Sneaking out of the house and visiting Ewart made both teens wish everyone had just agreed to go back to Kindergarten.<br />
<br />
Thirty minutes later, the girls now found themselves staring at Ewarts home. Yurikos spell had worked as expected, causing Gail&#39;s parents to fall asleep. Neither adult would be aware anything happened, allowing the young teens to go to Ewarts home. &quot;So now what,&quot; Pam whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will go and see what this crush of yours is up to,&quot; Abolith sighed. &quot;You should all stay here until I return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why Abby,&quot; the teens asked. Abolith furrowed her brow as she gazed at the group.  &quot;Because none of you are very quiet,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;I&#39;m surprised they haven&#39;t noticed you yet considering the ruckus you&#39;ve already caused.&quot; The girls blushed, nodding in response as Abolith now crept towards the home.<br />
<br />
Despite the elfs reduced age, she still maintained the skill necessary to remain unnoticed. Scaling a nearby tree, Abolith now deftly began moving along the treetops, before landing quietly on Ewarts roof. Quietly she now began to peer inside, noticing Ewart, his parents, and the Catalyst.<br />
<br />
Ewarts parents were in their room,  quietly watching TV. Neither adult noticing the teenage elf peering through their bedroom window.  Obviously the boys were making too much noise as the parents had shut their door. Abolith simply shook her head, humans had grown so comfortable in the suburbs that they never considered themselves in any danger. If the assassin had wanted, she could have easily eliminated the parents without alerting anyone else in the house.<br />
<br />
Shaking herself from her dark musings, Abolith now crept along the roof. Listening she could now hear three boys cheering wildly beneath her. Lowering herself to her stomach, the elf assassin now cautiously peaked inside.<br />
<br />
The young teens were all sitting on a couch, watching as the holo TV displayed a basketball game. Holo TVs had grown quite common over the decades, allowing people to feel as if they were sitting front row at any event. The boys now excitedly screamed as they watched a player drive the lane, slamming the ball down. Abolith had never been interested in sports, despite keeping herself in peak athletic form. Games were for children and she was no child....usually.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are they doing Abby?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith frowned, glaring at the group of teenage girls. None of them seemed to appreciate the idea of stealth, their voices carrying far too loud for the assassins taste. Quickly placing her finger to her mouth, she tried to indicate for the girls to quiet down. Unfortunately none of them seemed too follow.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you say we can&#39;t hear you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith sighed, noting that Ewart and the others now seemed to pause. Groaning in disgust, she now tried to signal for the others to hide as Ewart and the others made their way towards the front door.<br />
<br />
Darren anxiously followed behind Ewart, he and Robbie had enjoyed going to Ewarts home. With Hannah, Misaki, and Crystal busy this evening the two Freshman found themselves at their former teachers home. Ever since graduating from Junior High, the two young teens had enjoyed spending time with the teenage prodigy. Despite Ewart being a teacher, they enjoyed hanging out with him. He was their age after all and had similar interests to them. The teen also had more money than they had, 15 year olds didn&#39;t have alot of bills meaning Ewart could splurge on items Darren and Robbie could only dream of.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Darren, he had more worries than either Ewart or Robbie. Morgan, the Normal, these were concerns that other teenagers didn&#39;t have to worry about. When the trio heard something outside, Darren had immediately gone into a state of readiness. Had Morgan tracked him down? Were the Normal trying to attack in a moment of weakness? Darren now prepared himself, ready to defend himself and his friends if need be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s there,&quot; Ewart called. The teenage boys scanning the darkness. Neela and the others had quickly ducked behind a set of bushes, trying to shush eachother as they anxiously gazed at the three teens. Neela could feel her cheeks flush crimson as she gazed at Ewart. She felt so stupid right now, hiding behind some bushes as Ewart scanned the darkness. &quot;This is so stupid,&quot; she thought. Taking a breath, the teen now stepped from behind the bushes, her cheeks flushing in embarrassment. &quot;Hey Ewart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neela,&quot; Ewart asked in confusion. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Neela fidgeted in place, a wave of shyness washing over her as the other girls now filed in behind her. Darren gawked as he noticed a now teenage Yuriko.<br />
<br />
&quot;This one wished to talk with her crush,&quot; Abolith stated, causing the boys to jump in surprise.  Darrenspun around, shocked to see the regressed assassin. &quot;Abolith,&quot; Darren exclaimed. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A sleepover,&quot; she stated. Darren and the others stated slackjawed, realizing their quiet night was about to get alot more interesting.</p>
