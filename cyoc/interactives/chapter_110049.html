<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martin Stovall would be the first to admit it was good to see Moon Lake again.<br />
Born and raised here long before he entered politics, let alone became the town&#39;s mayor, Moon Lake was his home first and foremost.<br />
A place he was and always wanted to be proud of.<br />
The moment the hands free phone system of his car said he was within range, Martin&#39;s second call after talking to his loving wife Melissa was to the town hall, where he got a situation update concerning the deceased rogue wererat Lionel Ulysses in Seattle, and the consequences his murder might bring for Moon Lake.*<br />
&quot;Thanks in part to the FBI agent that&#39;s on our side, the media buzz is starting to disappear, with most people believing that the <i>tail</i> was a fake because Ulysses and his gang had some kind of weird fixation with the legendary Vegas Rat Pack**,&quot; explained Town Chancellor Samantha Twist, who had the call on speaker phone in a private room at the Town Hall, since she was still in the middle of a strategy conference.<br />
&quot;Is this Agent Green a were in hiding?&quot; wondered Stovall.<br />
&quot;Not yet. His wife is, and when the two of them can arrange some vacation time, they plan to visit us again so he can join were society to be with her.&quot;<br />
&quot;And he hasn&#39;t joined already because...&quot;<br />
&quot;She&#39;s a werecat,&quot; explained Samantha.***<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Anything else I should be aware of?&quot; asked Martin.<br />
&quot;The situation with Dieter Wilhelm and the Harper-Jenkins wedding is heating up,&quot; replied Samantha, before explaining about the first suspected henchman committing &#39;suicide by cop&#39; instead of implicating his employer, and the new henchman that was in town now. &quot;We believe that he&#39;s supposed to help the first, but isn&#39;t aware of what happened yet. We also suspect, but can&#39;t prove yet, that they have orders to kill the groom to be at the first opportunity.&quot;****<br />
&quot;DAMN!&quot; swore Martin. &quot;I&#39;m about 20 minutes out right now, so—&quot;<br />
&quot;As much as we appreciate the offer Mayor Stovall, the situation is under control at the moment between your capable police department and security personnel in my employ,&quot; said Tachibana no Akane.<br />
&quot;And if you&#39;re 20 minutes from here, that means you&#39;re only 10 away from your wife. Take the rest of the day off and be with Melissa,&quot; suggested Samantha. &quot;For whatever reason, the guy&#39;s still holed up in his motel room right now, and we both know how stressful things are going to be by this weekend.&quot;<br />
&quot;Only if you take your own advice Mrs. Twist. When you get off work today, go home and hug your wife,&quot; replied Martin.<br />
&quot;You know I will,&quot; answered Samantha with a smile.<br />
<br />
Melissa Stovall paced the floor of her living room, anxious for her husband to return.<br />
<i>I&#39;m as antsy as a kid on Christmas morning,</i> she thought to herself, just as she heard a car pull into the driveway.<br />
Looking out the window, her eyes lit up as a smile crossed her face.<br />
Martin Stovall wasn&#39;t even completely out of his vehicle as his wife came running to him.<br />
&quot;OH HONEY!&quot; she said, embracing and kissing the man.<br />
&quot;I missed you too dear,&quot; said Martin, holding her close. <i>The warmth of her body, the scent of her hair... Samantha was right. As much as the town might need me, I need Melissa.</i><br />
&quot;How&#39;s your mother?&quot; asked Melissa, once she was able to compose herself.<br />
&quot;Her usual cranky self,&quot; said Martin, as Melissa led him inside by the hand he wasn&#39;t carrying his suitcase in. &quot;Being a sister were-mermaid, she was just about healed when I left, but to keep up appearances living among normals, she has to wear the cast until at least after Thanksgiving.&quot;<br />
&quot;A skateboarding accident at her age,&quot; commented Melissa as they walked in. &quot;Here&#39;s hoping we&#39;re still that active and young at heart by the time we reach her age.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know they&#39;re in school right now, but Julie&#39;s still bringing Eric over so I can see for myself these blue-green scales he has?&quot; wondered Martin, as they sat together on the living room couch.<br />
&quot;Yes. He&#39;ll be staying for dinner. I hope that&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure. How are they doing since...&quot; being her father, Martin could not finish that sentence. <i>How are Julie and her boyfriend doing since they gave each other their virginity and he became a were-merman?</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Deeply in love and as happy as can be,&quot; was all Melissa Stovall would say. She had already told her husband that Eric Anderson was now the latest member of were-mer society, but the fact that he and their daughter were also engaged was a fact that needed a little more preparation to be shared.<br />
&quot;Well, we knew it would happen eventually. Julie kept referring to herself and Eric as us in reverse,&quot; commented Martin, snuggling up next to her. &quot;I know it took you a while, but the moment I first saw you...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know dear, and it&#39;s the same for them. I just hope they don&#39;t waste 10 years of togetherness and bliss like I did, before my mind realized what my heart probably knew from the start,&quot; replied Melissa.<br />
&quot;The fact that originally being a normal, it took you longer to realize the special connection between us still bothers you after all this time?&quot; asked Martin, looking at her. &quot;I told you before that I would have waited as long as it took.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know my love,&quot; said Melissa, before passionately kissing him. &quot;Thankfully the only things Eric and Julie have to wait for are your blessing and high school graduation.&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
And then Melissa Stovall told her husband the rest of recent events between their daughter and her beau, including the single pearl necklace Julie now proudly wore around her neck and the prophecy dreams they had about Eric Junior and Melinda eventually entering the world after their parents graduated college.****<br />
