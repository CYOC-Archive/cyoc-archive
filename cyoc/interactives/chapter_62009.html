<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The buffet? Dutch looked at Mike quizzically.<br />
<br />
Yea. <br />
<br />
But I am already fat!<br />
<br />
Well this is a start. I set the chronivac to change you back once you gain another 300 pounds.<br />
<br />
But that's 700 pounds! I'll never get that big.<br />
<br />
Then you will never get back your body.<br />
<br />
If I did I would be immobile.<br />
<br />
Naw I will make sure you can always move till you get to that size.<br />
<br />
I don't want to be fat!<br />
<br />
Well you like fat boys and now you are going to realize what it is like to be one.<br />
<br />
Yea I like fat boys I don't want to be one.<br />
<br />
Too bad. You can stay this size or you can try to get to 700.<br />
<br />
Dutch sat down and started to eat. Mike would get plate after plate for Dutch. Dutch wasn't even hungry when <br />
they got there but he sat and ate until they threw them out.<br />
<br />
They stopped at another buffet and stuffed Dutch there till they threw him out of that one.<br />
<br />
It was getting late and Mike took Dutch to the bear bar that Dutch would take his fat toys to. Everyone there <br />
looked at the fat boy that waddled through the door and thought they recognized him but no one could tell <br />
exactly who it was. One of the bears that Dutch had dated eventually cornered him and found out that it was <br />
Dutch. The buzz went through the bar that it was Dutch and now they realized why they hadn't seen him in a few <br />
months. Mike had put in the chronivac that Dutch had been on vacation for a few weeks.<br />
<br />
As the word got out guys would come up and rub his belly.<br />
<br />
Get up on the dance floor Mike ordered. <br />
<br />
I am too stuffed and if I am going to get fat wont that make me lose weight.<br />
<br />
I can push it up to 800 if you want!<br />
<br />
OK OK I will do it.<br />
<br />
Dutch got up there and took up a large part of the center of the dance floor. He tried to dance but all he <br />
really did was jiggle. A crowd of his previous dates surrounded him and watched him jiggle.<br />
<br />
Dutch's face got red from the exertion and probably would have been red from embarrassment as he dance. It <br />
wasn't long before he was so winded that he waddled himself off the stage, dripping in sweat, and found Mike. <br />
Can we go now! <br />
<br />
I think you need a beer. Mike produced a pitcher and Dutch downed it quickly. He really needed a drink. <br />
<br />
Here have another.<br />
<br />
Dutch did again.<br />
<br />
Mike let him rest and some of his former lovers that felt to be Dutch's toys would come round and play with <br />
the big boy. Mike would tell them that he fattened up Dutch. Mike pretended to be an encourager and that <br />
Dutch's real desire was to be fat.<br />
<br />
Mike found out that there were several guys that found that an apt turn for Dutch. Mike let them know that it <br />
wasn't exclusive and that he shared his toys and several of the chubbies wanted to go out with the newly <br />
fattened super chub Dutch and help with the fattening.<br />
<br />
Dutch didn't dare protest but he was so embarrassed by the idea that he would now be the object of the boys he <br />
use to use.<br />
<br />
When they got back home Mike continued his ritual of weighing Dutch on the industrial scale he had the <br />
chronivac create.<br />
<br />
400 pounds. <br />
<br />
What? I ate all that and drank all that beer and nothing?<br />
<br />
Looks like it is going to be a lot of work for you.<br />
<br />
Dutch began to cry but Mike had ordered pizza on the way home. And about that time the door bell rang and Mike <br />
told Dutch to go answer the door.<br />
<br />
It was the chubby delivery guy that Dutch had a crush on but had never been with.<br />
<br />
Where's the party this time the delivery boy said as Dutch opened the door. The delivery boy's eyes popped out <br />
as he looked at Dutch. Dude what the hell happened to you.<br />
<br />
I got fat. Dutch said dejectedly.<br />
<br />
Damn you look good.<br />
<br />
Wish I could be that fat.<br />
<br />
Mike said come on in. It's lard butts feeding time you want to join in? He jumped at the chance and soon both <br />
Dutch and Gerry were chowing down. This would be a constant companion for Dutch.<br />
<br />
Lets weigh you on Dutch's scale it goes real high. Gerry jumped on and it stopped at 260. Damn light weight <br />
mike said. we need to chub you up. <br />
<br />
The delivery guy just chuckled. I know Dutch will like that.<br />
<br />
Wanna see what Dutch weighs?<br />
<br />
Get up here fat boy show him how much you weigh. <br />
<br />
It was hard for him to lift himself from the sofa but he eventually lifted off and waddled over again.<br />
<br />
400 again.<br />
<br />
Damn that's huge.<br />
<br />
Tell him your goal tubby.<br />
<br />
I am shooting for 700.<br />
<br />
You wont be able to move.<br />
<br />
I hope I can I want to show this off Dutch said looking up at Mike for his approval.<br />
<br />
Maybe more too.<br />
<br />
Well I want to get fat but I am thinking I don't want to be any bigger than you are now.<br />
<br />
That excited Dutch but no one noticed because that was one of the things Mike hadn't changed and as Dutch had <br />
grown his penis remained small and was engulfed by his belly fat even when hard.<br />
<br />
Mike left the two on the sofa where Gerry fell asleep resting against the chubby Dutch.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow would be the first of Dutch's dates with him former lovers.<br />
<br />
And Mike would never let Dutch know that the story about him getting to 700 was total lie. He never set the <br />
chronivac to change him back but by the time he got to 700 the bad eating habits would be so ingrained in him <br />
that he would never lose weight and even if Mike made him small again his habits would soon fatten him up <br />
again.</p>
