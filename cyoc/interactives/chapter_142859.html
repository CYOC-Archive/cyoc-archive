<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When I woke up, I was in a pool of jizz. It was great! Jakey still had his cock in my ass and Taylor&#39;s cock was still around my lips. There was a little bit of pre still on there. Yum!<br />
<br />
I got up and began looking around. Chase and Danny must&#39;ve have passed out 69-ing each other based on how they fell asleep. There was so much cum that I knew we were gonna have a great breakfast.<br />
<br />
Before I could dive for it though, I started hearing a lot of noise outside. I opened the door to check it out and people were walking around moving boxes and suitcases.<br />
<br />
I turned and saw a piece of paper taped to our door. It had a bunch of big words, though and trying to figure out what they meant made my head hurt.<br />
<br />
Instead, I tapped on this cute brunette&#39;s shoulder. He wasn&#39;t carrying much around and was completely naked. All he had was one small pink suitcase with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you read the note sexy? The quarantine totally failed. Apparently, something like 96% of the world&#39;s adult population has been affected. So they&#39;re letting us go cause they think one cutey here is immune and they wanna research him,&quot; he explained.<br />
<br />
He said a lot of big words that I didn&#39;t understand, but I did get one thing. They&#39;re letting us go! That means the virus thingy was probably gone. Yay!<br />
<br />
I wanted to celebrate, so I looked down at the brunette&#39;s cock, licking my lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, hon. My family&#39;s waiting for me downstairs and my step-dad says he&#39;s got a special present just for me. I&#39;m, like, so excited!&quot; he stated, and basically skipped down the steps.<br />
<br />
Darn, I wanted more cum! Maybe Taylor was in our room and I could get some! I almost ran to my room to tell Taylor the good news and to celebrate.<br />
<br />
When I got there though, someone else was at the door. He had light brown hair and clearly stole a police uniform, because there was no way a police officer would be so skinny. Then again, he wore a police hat and a bulletproof vest, so I guess it made sense. He turned to me and I realized who it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;R-Ryan?&quot; I asked. He looked totally different. He looked hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, sexy,&quot; he said, walking up to me and squeezing my ass. &quot;Since you&#39;re leaving, I thought I would give you back your phone since I took it. You&#39;ve got a ton of calls from some girl named Lisa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa? Oh wait, my girlfriend! Well, ex-girlfriend now. There was no way I&#39;d could be with a girl now, and besides, Taylor was my boyfriend. Guess I&#39;d have to break up with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you got a lot sexier in one day. You&#39;re much more twinky. And that ass had to have grown,&quot; Ryan noted. I blushed hearing that compliment. &quot;I got an idea. How about you call your girlfriend with a video chat, and she can watch me fuck your brains out?&quot;<br />
<br />
I liked that plan, but I had to make one change. I grabbed his hand and opened my door before saying, &quot;Sure, but, like, what brain?&quot;<br />
<br />
We began furiously making out before Ryan turned me around, slapped my ass hard, and bent me over my desk. I called Lisa just as he slipped himself inside me and by the time she picked up, my eyes were in the back of my head and I was already moaning uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiya, sweetie!&quot; I heard her say. Something seemed different about her voice. I tried as hard as I could to focus on her. Her hair was just as pink as mine and her eyes matched that color. Her breasts were almost the size of her head and her lips were almost as thick as mine. There was a name for someone like her, I just couldn&#39;t remember it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, I&#39;m a bimbo now. Oh, and I&#39;m only into girls now. So I think we might have to break up,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhmm,&quot; I responded. The old me would&#39;ve have been turned on by her, but now I just wanted me dick. &quot;I&#39;m gay! And my name is Slut!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds great sweetie. Hope you have fun! Oh, Jess just walked in! She&#39;s as fun as me! Gotta go!&quot; she stated, before hanging up. Thank God. Now I could focus on getting fucked like the slutty twink I was.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, that was hot! She didn&#39;t even care! Guess they were right. My bosses told me that the virus basically made people gay and generally feminized everyone who came in contact with it. Hair color was dependent on different strains. Apparently, everyone made sure to sanitize the showers and filter the air vents, but no one expected the food to be contaminated since it had been all canned. In other words, someone, accidentally or not, was working against us the entire time,&quot; Ryan explained, not that I understand anything he said. All I could focus on was that hot, thick length pumping in and out of me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, honestly, I can&#39;t say I blame them. This feels so much better than when I was straight. I couldn&#39;t imagine a better life,&quot; Ryan continued. Then he chuckled. &quot;You don&#39;t understand a word I&#39;m saying, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
I moaned in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;You. Just. Want. Cock. And. Cum. Right. Slut!&quot; he yelled, thrusting into me with each word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yes! Cum in my slutty, twinky hole!&quot; I replied. I needed it so bad!<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Slut! Here it comes!&quot; And with that, my insides were thickly coated with a fresh new load. I immediately came, covering my desk with my juices. When our orgasms subsided, we dove for the remains, snowballing after we did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, thanks for breakfast!&quot; I giggled after swallowing. Then, from the door, I heard a gagging sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, that was disgusting!&quot; Some guy yelled. He looked weird. He was the first guy I had seen in a while that didn&#39;t look like a total twink. &quot;At least, close the fucking door.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then started sniffing the air. &quot;Why does it smell like strawberries?&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t see it, but his hair, which was black, seemed to be getting lighter. I looked at Ryan in confusion and he just smirked at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think our friend here needs to be quarantined in your room for a few hours. What do you think?&quot; Ryan suggested. I quickly pounced on the guy and brought him inside my room, causing the guy to giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t, but it&#39;s okay. He won&#39;t soon, too!&quot; I replied. I didn&#39;t need a brain anymore. Nothing felt weird or unnatural now, so why have a brain when you can have unlimited cock and cum instead?</p>
