<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing Edwin noticed was his hair falling around his face. That didn&#39;t startle him at first, his hair was naturally long, but what did surprise him was the fact that his hair was darkening and becoming longer right in front of him. Edwin watched in shock as his hair went from dark brown to black and became straight as opposed to curly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Edwin, are you okay?&quot; He could hear Gabby say in a worried tone, still beside him as the changes progressed. Edwin managed a nod, and relaxed his body against the ground, seeing no purpose in fighting the changes anymore. Speaking of said changes, his skin color was next as his dark caramel tone slowly became replaced by a whiter, more pale tone, starting from his head and going down throughout his body.<br />
<br />
His body tingled all over as his frame began to shrink, becoming more feminine as he lost a couple of inches as well as his muscle fat. His arms and hands slimmed down and shrank, his nails being painted a nice cherry red as the same thing began to happen to his legs and feet, Edwin kicking off his shoes in discomfort as the changes only continued. <br />
<br />
With a sudden crack, Edwin felt his spine fold backwards, giving his body a bit more curve as the changes began to place his muscle fat into places more fitting for a female. His nipples began to swell, poorly hidden by his now ill fitting shirt, growing more sensitive as fat welled up behind them. Two perky mounds began to push their way out of his chest, causing Edwin to stifle a moan, his new breasts stopping at a solid B cup. <br />
<br />
The rest of his muscle fat began to pool out onto his rear as well, his butt becoming softer and perkier, as it began to stretch out his underwear, forcing him to shrug it and his pants off. Gabby couldn&#39;t help but sport an erection at the sight of Edwin&#39;s changing body, but he made sure to act as a shield against prying eyes. <br />
<br />
The next thing that Edwin felt begin to change was his face, as it began to painfully shift. His skin was already changed, so that was done, but his face still looked very much like a man&#39;s, until it became more petite and feminine. His eye shape shifted as well, becoming almond shaped and feminine. His eyelashes grew considerably, as his lips began to fill out. His Adam&#39;s apple quickly disappeared as well, causing Edwin to cough in his new girl&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it over yet?&quot; Gabby asked, still by his soon to be girlfriend&#39;s side, receiving a shake of the head from Edwin.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No,&quot; He said in his new female voice, giving a little shudder as he did so, looking down at his male dick, which stood out against the rest of his feminine body. Even now, his mind was telling him that he was female, and that his dick would be gone soon enough.<br />
<br />
True to form, his testicles began to go inside his body, them and the rest of his male reproductive system transforming into their respective female counterparts. Edwin couldn&#39;t take the pleasure however, as she began to see her dick move inside oh so painfully so. She moved Gabby&#39;s hands to it, urging the newly changed boy to help her dick along.<br />
<br />
Gabby blushed a deep red, but he obliged, quickly shoving the alien penis into Edwin&#39;s body. It made a loud schlorp! as it went in, causing Edwin to moan loudly as it inverted into a vagina. She, now officially a she, had her first female orgasm as she squirted cum everywhere, passing out once she had done so.<br />
<br />
Gabby, removing his hands from her private area, watched as Edwin&#39;s clothes began to change right before his very eyes. First off, purple bra and panties materialized on her body, covering up some things. Next, her shirt began to morph into an anime t shirt, fitting her body as it was covered by a fleece sweater. Tight jean fitted themselves around her lower half, as high tops encircled her feet.<br />
<br />
In her mind, Edwin found herself unable to think of herself as a male, or even Edwin or that matter. Instead, she found herself referring to herself as Sumire, beginning to remember a passion for being a manga artist. She still found the strength to remember other things, but she couldn&#39;t help but feel her newer memories were more real.<br />
<br />
She came to, slowly, waking up to meet Gabby&#39;s eyes. &quot;G-Gabby?&quot; She asked, to which Gabby nodded, helping her up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s me!&quot; The boy said, still using a feminine tone. &quot;You&#39;re still in there, Edwin, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sumire frowned, looking down at herself. &quot;Well.... I still remember being him, but the Chronivac made it so I think like I&#39;m someone else now.... call me Sumire until we fix this, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was probably the orgasm...&quot; Gabby thought to himself, as he simply nodded. &quot;Since I&#39;m still entirely concious of who I am...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, did anything else happen while I was out?&quot; Sumire asked, this time more worriedly, in case of any changes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that depends...&quot; Gabby said, rubbing the back of his head as he looked around. People changed into animals by the Chronivac still were running amok, some still being changed presently. &quot;Did you or I get hit by the wave that&#39;s turning everyone into animals?&quot;</p>
