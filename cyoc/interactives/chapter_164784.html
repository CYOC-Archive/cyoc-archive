<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Justin ultimately decides he should test it and see if it even works. It would be absurd to assume something like this is real. Browsing through the software, he chooses to try something he&#39;s been curious about, what it&#39;s like to be a girl. Sure it&#39;s not something he&#39;s is dying to know but if he has the chance, he&#39;s gonna take it. From a quick glance, all he simply needs to do is flick the switch from M to F and hit apply, it seems it even has a change history too so he won&#39;t have to worry about reverting any changes. To hurry up and get the disappointment over with, he presses apply without hesitation.<br />
<br />
After a long awkward moment of flicking his eyes between his body and the screen in front of him, Justin clenches his fist. &quot;I knew it, it&#39;s just junk, why would someone make something like this? Is it a movie prop or something? Whatever. I&#39;ll just go see if my comic got here yet.&quot; In a aggravated motion, Justin closes and tosses his laptop into a pile of dirty clothes lying on the floor. With that, he goes about his day. He can&#39;t help but think back to the Chronivac the whole time, occasionally checking his body for any noticeable change only to lead to more disappointment.<br />
<br />
The day begins approaching the usual time Justin goes to bed. Considering the disheartening day he&#39;s had from the elaborate joke that was the Chronivac, and the lack of the comic book that he now worries is lost in the mail, he doesn&#39;t hesitate the thought of going to sleep despite being off from school for the week. Justin goes about his nightly routine of taking a shower, and brushing his teeth. After the last spit of water into the sink, he looks at himself in the mirror thinking something&#39;s off. His eye&#39;s narrow, and suddenly widen on the realization. &quot;Oh that&#39;s right, I was gonna get a haircut soon. My hair is getting way too long.&quot; And with that solved, Justin lies down in bed, fantasizing the day if the Chronivac was real.<br />
<br />
Justin suddenly wakes up, looking out his window and seeing almost no light outside. &quot;What time is it?&quot; he thinks to himself, but he quickly finds that&#39;s about 4 A.M. by looking over at his clock. In a slow movement, he leans up in bed trying to see what woke him. With a quick glance around the room, Justin notices that his laptop was still on despite being closed. Before he can even decide if he wants to turn it off or just go back to bed, he&#39;s fully awake the second he catches a glimpse of his arms and torso. He has small chubby lumps sticking up through his shirt, but he didn&#39;t weigh that much, he was far from it actually. But he soon notices that it doesn&#39;t seem to be the case anymore as his arms look like they belong to someone else. His hands and forearm look slightly skinnier, and there is no muscle tone at all. What he couldn&#39;t tell in the dim blue light he has from the morning sky, was that the skin of his arms were softer, and looking a tad pale. &quot;Is all of this.....from the Chronivac?&quot; He thinks while lifting his pajama shirt.<br />
<br />
As he already saw, the flesh around his nipples looked like they&#39;ve gained a bit of weight which looks out of place with the rest of him not matching his new additions. Justin pulls the cover off of his lower half and looks them down. Immediately he notices a lack of leg hair, but he didn&#39;t have a lot to begin with at his age so he wasn&#39;t too concerned as it could easily just be the light playing tricks on him or at least he assumes. Even weirder, his investigations lead him to find that his underwear seems loose. And with all of that, he gets out of bed to put an end to his curiosity.<br />
<br />
Pulling the laptop out of the pile of clothes, Justin sits down on his bed with the laptop in his lap. Butterflies fill his stomach as he opens the laptop. The bright screen forces Justin to squint his eyes but still he opens the laptop and rushes to lower the brightness. And with that he inspects the Chronivac software but finds the program doesn&#39;t respond to any input. Confused, he goes to close it but notices that there was a second instance of the software open. He clicks on the new window and it&#39;s just a small box in the center of the screen labeled &quot;Progress&quot; with a bar filling up and the percentage stating 46%. &quot;No way&quot; he audibly says, not putting any thought of others in his house hearing him. &quot;Am I really turning into a girl, that would explain everything but...&quot; he thinks to himself while looking down at his underwear.<br />
<br />
Justin almost tosses the laptop with the speed he puts it to the side. He stands up and drops his underwear to the floor, then begins an awkward stance to look at his privates to see if anything has changed. &quot;Nope, looks about the same, but what about my nipples...I guess it does say 46 percent.&quot; He sits back down and thinks about the edits made to his body, and with that he looks over at the Chronivac and thinks &quot;Wait a minute, this is still way to much. There&#39;s no way this is for real. It&#39;s gotta be a dream, I&#39;m just gonna lay back down in bed and everything will be normal when I wake up.&quot; Not wanting to suffer anymore disappointment, Justin closes his laptop and puts it right back where he got it from, then lies down trying to calm himself so he can sleep yet bothered by the lumps adorning his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;BEEP BEEP&quot; his alarm sounds, startling Justin. With his eyes still closed, he stretches out an arm to turn off his alarm. Still half asleep he thinks to himself &quot;That was such of an annoying dream&quot; while observing that it&#39;s about 11:30 A.M. Everything just wants to get my hopes up, even my own brain. I guess I should see if I turned off my laptop though.&quot; Justin turns to his side, lifting and propping himself up on his elbow in bed. But he felt something brush up on the back of his arm, and then an odd sensation hits him as he feels 2 weights hanging from his chest. In a swift motion, he moves his free arm up to his chest and finds breasts appropriate for his age (15) along with a wave of a bit of nausea from the disbelief of the situation.<br />
<br />
After stalling for a second, hand cupped on a breast, Justin decides that the first thing he should be doing is checking the Chronivac and not inspecting his body. Right as he&#39;s slipping out of bed, a chill runs down his spine from the absence between his legs. Resisting the urge to just shove a hand down to his nether region out of curiosity, he continues getting out of bed. Finding it where he last put it, except the light on the front is now red indicating low battery but that wasn&#39;t Justin&#39;s concern. He picks up the laptop and sits down on his bed much like the last time he checked in on the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Upon opening his laptop, he&#39;s greeted with the same progress bar except this time it says 74%. &quot;What took it so long?&quot; Justin thinks to himself as he looks back at the still unresponsive Chronivac software. Almost immediately he saw a box he missed before labeled &quot;Transformation Length&quot; with 1 hour filled into it. Now with the mystery solved, and the knowledge that his parents are at work and his only sister at a friends house, time to check out his changing body. Filled with excitement, Justin doesn&#39;t know where to begin first. He takes off his shirt and heads into his parents room where they have a full body mirror. On the way he can feel his new long hair and flows his hands through it. The walk there is already proving to be an interesting experience for him from the lack of something between his legs as he walks to the feeling of having any sort of weight on his chest. Finally arriving, he gets a clear look at his body and finds he can hardly recognize himself. <br />
<br />
Starting with his face, the first immediate changes he sees is his long straight hair hanging down, then he notices that his face looks the same but more feminine. He can&#39;t quite put his finger on what exactly but he can tell that his cheeks are a bit wider and his eyelashes seem longer. Next he finds that the little facial hair he had was entirely gone, but considering it was just small patches, no facial hair is looking better to him right now. The more he looks at Justin looks at his face, the more he beautiful he finds his new face. Moving on, he gets to see his new breasts in full. They&#39;re not the biggest thing in the world but he&#39;s happy with them, and the Chronivac isn&#39;t done so he gets excited at the thought of it finishing. &quot;Wait a minute, I don&#39;t care how big my boobs are, I&#39;m just testing it out. Oh well, let&#39;s see what else.&quot; he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Continuing checking out his body, Justin finds that his whole body seems to be lacking muscle mass much like his arms from the night before, or maybe he gained weight. He really couldn&#39;t tell how but the few muscles he had at his age were visibly gone. Along with that, his underwear like last night is looking loose, and is actually hanging down from his waist a bit. Yet the same time, his thighs are looking a tad bigger, if they weren&#39;t it looks like his underwear would be hanging down even more. Lastly, he notices that he overall looks a bit more pale, but he could barely even tell. He takes one last look at his whole body and says to himself &quot;I&#39;m looking pretty good, and I have a girls voice too, I could use this to pull a prank on someone. Now to check out one last thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin excited for this moment, quickly disposes of his underwear. There it is, his new vagina. Looking at it just makes him get all kinds of weird emotions. Not seeing the usual almost makes him question if it was ever really there. With his left hand, he slowly moves in hopes of figuring out what to do before his hand gets there. Justin uncomfortably sticks out one finger and touches right in the middle, filling him with new feelings that force him to draw his hand back and his knees to buckle, sending Justin forward to lean on the mirror. &quot;How, how do girls handle this...&quot; Justin says in an exhausted tone. Almost scared to touch it again, he instead puts the same hand up to his breast ready to tickle it slightly. Yet again his knees collapse causing Justin to drop to the ground. He doesn&#39;t usually masturbate a lot but compared to the few times he had, this was a whole different world.<br />
<br />
Feeling like he wasn&#39;t ready to walk the path of fully exploring his body, Justin puts his underwear back on that he so happily got rid of earlier and went downstairs into the kitchen to get some food. He needed break from the roller coaster that was his new body. Much like any other day, he went downstairs and got himself a bowl of cereal to begin the day. While Justin was eating he noticed that his hair was really messy so once he was done, he head back upstairs to borrow his mother&#39;s hairbrush and began doing what he came up here to do in the bathroom. It was an odd experience for him, the most he ever managed his usually short hair was washing it in the shower and now he&#39;s brushing it to straighten it out because it&#39;s long and messy.<br />
<br />
Now that he&#39;s not a guy anymore, he considered borrowing his Sister&#39;s underwear since it would be more appropriate considering he&#39;s been wearing boxers this whole time. Feeling all kinds of shame, he walked up to the door that lead into Alisha&#39;s room. He began twisting the knob as he&#39;s thinking &quot;Why am I doing this. I&#39;ve only even been in here a few times, I don&#39;t even know where her underwear is&quot; and after a bit of searching through this pink hell of a room, he finds the underwear drawer along with the panties he&#39;ll soon be wearing. Not wanting to grab something that looks too girlish, he looks and looks for something remotely dark colored, all of it&#39;s hot pink. Letting out a sigh, he grabs one on the top and heads back to the full mirror.<br />
<br />
Ready for the embarrassment, Justin takes off his underwear to the usual sight of his new privates. Taking a deep breath, he begins sliding the hot pink panties with cat paws all over slowly up his legs. His face getting redder as they come up to the top. Every single time he has to deal with his new body, it feels like he&#39;s exploring uncharted waters. Looking at his new panties, he thinks he would just fall apart if anyone saw him wearing these, not putting much thought into how he doesn&#39;t look like his usual self. The only thing easing him is how comfortable they are compared to his boxers. Yet now that he&#39;s just sitting here wearing only panties, he feels something is missing. &quot;Ah right, a bra. Maybe I&#39;ll even grab one of her shirts to match.&quot; she says out loud. <br />
<br />
Justin heads back with another quick search. Luckily Justin&#39;s sister has a plain white bra. The more difficult part was finding a shirt. Most of them were childish pink designs but there was a yellow tank top with a brand logo on it that looked good enough. She puts them both with ease. &quot;I think I&#39;m looking pretty good now. I&#39;m only missing pants but I can put some on if I go out. Oh wait, I haven&#39;t checked on the Chronivac in a while.&quot; Justine says as she begins heading back to her room. Checking in on the Chronivac, it now says 100% along with an okay button replacing the progress bar. She does a quick check over her body and there isn&#39;t any noticeable change. &quot;I wonder what that last 30 percent was. Oh who cares, let&#39;s look what else this thing can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justine starts looking through the list of what it can do once again, interested to try something on herself again since she still has the time before someone comes home. Yet trying something with her sister or parents would also be fun. &quot;They even have mental changes and change reality options so no one will even notice&quot; she says to herself, not noticing that mental change was turned on for her change. &quot;There are just so many options, which to try first.&quot;</p>
