<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria&#39;s conversation with Merlin was quick and concerning. Explaining herself and her vision, Gloria noticed the long pause on the other end of the line before Merlin insisted that she come by tomorrow and tell no one in her family. What was truely odd hos insistence that she bring along two close friends, no more, no less.<br />
<br />
Gloria was puzzled by Merlins request but finally decided to bring along Jackie and Sasha. Of all her friends they were her closest. Trying to get there though in secret was a bit trickier, fortunately the girls had Mr. Harris&#39;s number. As Derruck now pulled up to the Magic Shop he gave the three teens a worrisome look.<br />
<br />
&quot;So let me get this straight,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;The three of you need to meet this wizard Merlin and we can&#39;t tell anyone? You do realize your sisters are going to kill you, then me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Mr. Harris,&quot; Gloria apologized. &quot;But this was serious. Our sisters could be in some real danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick sighed as he now headed towards the Magic Shop. &quot;Okay girls,&quot; he sighed. &quot;But don&#39;t think I&#39;m just waiting in the car. If Claudia is in trouble too then I&#39;m helping.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the four entered the Magic Shop they could see Merlim waiting for them. The elderly wizard had a concerned look on his face as he beckoned them forward. &quot;Glad you could come Gloria,&quot; he smiled as the group stood before them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Merlin whats up,&quot; Sasha asked. &quot;What&#39;s with all the secret agent stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin sighed as he now sunk into his chair. &quot;Unfortunately,&quot; he said. &quot;It appears Morgan is making a bold move against Gloria&#39;s family. While I am not sure exactly what that is, I do know someone with more experience in dealing with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Merlin beckoned towards his rear, Gloria and the others jaws dropped. The other Kellie and her father Merlin now emerged. Derrick gaped at the two as he looked between Gloria and them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait hold on,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;How is it there are two Merlins? And why is Kellie a teenager?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm Mr. Harris,&quot; Gloria said sheepishly. &quot;Those two aren&#39;t from around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria and Merlin now explained to the Derrick and Gloria&#39;s friends the existence of the other timeline and the dopplegangers that existed there. Derrick, Sasha, and Jackie gaped at them as they tried to wrap their minds around this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria this is crazy,&quot; Derrick exclaimed. &quot;Other timelines? Alternate realities? Tgis stuff doesn&#39;t exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of agreeing with Mr. Harris on this one,&quot; Sasha stated. &quot;Also why are we just meeting them now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its complicated,&quot; Gloria groaned. &quot;For now though can you guys just trust me?&quot; Sasha, Jackie, and Derrick looked at one another before shrugging and nodding. Kellie and her father smiled as they stepped forward. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Kellie smiled. &quot;Now we can tell you what we think is happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria and her friends now listened intently as tbe other Merlin explained Morgan Lefay and her grudge against Gloria&#39;s family. The group was somewhat dumbfounded about all this and asked nemerous questions as to why Morgan would try to interfer on Katie&#39;s relationship. &quot;An interesting question,&quot; the other Merlin stated. &quot;And myself and my doppleganger were perplexed by this as well, until my daughter figured it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie stepped forward, a sad expression on her face as she looked everyone over. &quot;Morgan isnt trying to get Katie,&quot; she said gravely. &quot;Shes trying to anger Kellie and use her to get rid of Katie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie now explained how she had splintered reality years ago by eliminating someone from the timeline. That action had destroyed her world and splintered reality, making the two worlds they resided in possible. Kellie hypothesized that Morgan was now going to use Kellie in a very similar way. If this worlds Kellie erased Katie in anger useing her magic, she could destroy this world or alter realitt to such an extent that everyones lives would be affected.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we need to do,&quot; Jackie stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to stop Morgans plan,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;We have to keep Kellie from detroying Katie and try to find out how this guy became involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how though,&quot; Sasha exclaimed. &quot;I mean yeah you have some magic and so does Gloria but we don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin smiled as he now reached under the counter producing two rings. &quot;That is until now,&quot; he smirked.<br />
<br />
Sasha and Jackie gaped as he beckoned the two girls forward. &quot;This was sooner than I anticipated,&quot; he said. &quot;However desperate times call for desperate measures.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasha and Jackie were speechless as the two rings floated to their new masters. &quot;Sasha,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;This is the Ring of Transformation. It shall allow you to change the physical nature of anything, including yourself.&quot; Sasha stared in wonder as she fastened thw ring on her finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackie,&quot; he said. &quot;While usually their is only one Ring of Age, due to our friends Reality alterations, their are now two. I give this second ring to you. Keep it safe and use it wisely.&quot; Jackie nodded numbly as she looked at the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Gloria said. &quot;So I guess the four of us try to stop Morgan from turning Kellie against Katie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Kellie smirked. &quot;It will be six of us.&quot; Gloria paused as Kellie now called to the back room. As she did Gloria and her friends watched as three girls exited the room. Gloria and the other immediately recognized them as teenage versions of Katie, Lisa, and Mary Elise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; Derrick whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Katie said. &quot;How is this going to work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well girls,&quot; the other Merlin smirked. &quot;How would you like to go to college?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how would we accomplish that,&quot; Mary Elise asked. &quot;We dont exactly look like college students.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Kellie smiled. &quot;Jackie? Think you can change that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; she said quietly. Kellie smiled as she now appriached the girl. &quot;Okay good,&quot; she said. &quot;Now I want you to wish me, Gloria, Mary, Katie, Sasha and your self to 20.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey what about me,&quot; Lisa exclaimed. Kellie turned to her friend, a concerned look on her face. &quot;Lisa I need you to stay back with Derrick,&quot; she said. &quot;Neither one of you have magic right now so we need you to provide support. We probably need your insight on things in case we miss something. Its nothing against you Lisa, just keep an eye out and gelp in case we overlook something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa huffed as she frowned at her friend. &quot;Okay fine,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;But you owe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled, assuring Lisa she would indeed make it up to her. Turning back to Jackie, she smiled placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. &quot;Okay Jackie now focus on making us physically 20,&quot; she said. &quot;Make sure you word it like that or reality could alter.&quot; Jackie nodded as she looked down at her ring, making a wish.<br />
<br />
The teens felt a ringle course through their bodies as the wish began to take affect. As the girls looked over their bodies, they watched as they negan to mature. Slowly but surely the girls raced through high school, growing an inch or two as their curves expanded. Sasha and Gloria hefted up their breasts as they swelled towards maturity.  As quickly as it began the process completed leaving Katie, Kellie, Mary, Gloria, Sasha and Jackie very beautiful and mature looking college girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh I could get used to this, &quot; Sasha smirked as she admired her d cup breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls,&quot; the other Merlin interrupted. &quot;You&#39;ll have plenty of time to examine yourselves later. Right now I need you all to focus.&quot;<br />
<br />
The now college age girls paused as Merlin lookrd at them gravely. &quot;This could be quite dangerous,&quot; he said. &quot;Morgan is out in the open and she appears to have an ally. Your mission is simple, find this ally of Morgan and learn his intentions. As much as you may want to try not to come in contact with Katie or Kellie if possible. They may be bewitched and might be unreasonable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Claudia,&quot; Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you have to,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;But still be careful. Morgan is making a bold move to eliminate Katie and Kellie. If she suspects your involvement she may make a move against you. Make no mistake, if she finds you, she will destroy you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls nodded as they gravely looked at one another. The stakes were high, their lives would be in danger. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay everyone,&quot; Gloria said. &quot;Let&#39;s so this.&quot; Merlin nodded, wishing the girls luck as he transported them to Katoes college.</p>
