<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The walk back to Molly's Uncle's small home was a slow and fairly quiet one. I was certain that Molly was enraged at being used, though I didn't know if her anger was directed at Mr. Beauregard or at her Uncle. I wasn't about to push and find out though. What irked me about the man was how unapologetic he was... and by the way he opened the interview. I had been forced to watch a total stranger practically feel up my girlfriend. It made me want to grab a tire iron and beat him for it. Molly had lot let touch her in that way, and the man proceeded to do what even I was not allowed to do. And then he refused to apologize for it, and even dismissed it as something important.<br />
<br />
His hatred of wolves and insulting me I could let go. No one agrees on everything, but to violate Molly in that way, and then not to apologize for such inappropriate behavior... that was my last straw as far as dealing with Mr. Beauregard was concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe that man...&quot; Molly gave a low growl after a few minutes, &quot;sees that I'm a victim of some freak show and decides the best thing is to do is to have me fight various predators to protect his cattle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess to him, his cattle are more important,&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm not even good at self-defense type stuff,&quot; Molly grumbled, &quot;you're the one who took all the classes... but he just assumes that because I'm a tigress that I'm going to fight animals that will either be bigger then me or outnumber me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he over-estimates your hunting instinct,&quot; I commented, &quot;and to be honest, I don't really know how martial arts will help against animals...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But to want to USE ME because of what that freak show did!&quot; Molly growled, &quot;doesn't he have any compassion or care about what that freak show did to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure he has those things, but they're directed toward what he cares about,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hamburgers,&quot; Molly cut me off before I could say anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greed can be a powerful motivator,&quot; I told her, &quot;unfortunately, it doesn't produce good results.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly didn't say anything for a moment, but I could tell that she was agitated as we continued on our way back to Frank Rhoer's home.<br />
<br />
&quot;But to treat me like I'm some mare or stallion to be used as a beast of burden, and when I let him know that I didn't like what he was doing, he decides I have a problem!&quot; Molly said after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't explain that beyond being an escalation of the way a lot of people have reacted to you,&quot; I sighed, doing my best to hide my own anger, and failing miserably.<br />
<br />
&quot;I seriously wanted to maul him for the way he groped me,&quot; Molly spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm right with you,&quot; I told her, &quot;I guess we both restrained ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wish we didn't have to,&quot; Molly sighed, &quot;we're victims, George. Me for being transformed, and I'm afraid I've drug you in with me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You jump, I jump,&quot; I cut her off, &quot;I go where you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, people should understand that I'm not some animal out to eat or entertain anyone, and that I'm not to be used like...&quot; Molly paused while looking for the words to say, &quot;...like I some beast of burden. It's all so frustrating, and it's really starting to piss me off!&quot;<br />
<br />
We were beginning to arrive again at Frank Rhoer's home again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things have to get better eventually,&quot; I sighed trying to be optimistic.<br />
<br />
&quot;It SHOULD have done that two MONTHS AGO!&quot; Molly responded, still clearly angry, &quot;It's... it's...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let it out,&quot; I urged.<br />
<br />
&quot;RRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!&quot; Molly roared out her frustrations at the situation, with enough volume that I'm sure that the people in the town heard. Once done she sighed and looked to be, &quot;I feel a little better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we go into town,&quot; I sighed, &quot;we can drop off your resume, if you still want to leave it with the school here... I can cheek with the local police, see if they have openings or if they know if the state troopers in this area have openings while we're here... I could also file a report if you want...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's probably got the police in his pocket,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;all we'd amount to is a nuisance case.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And we're up to were you meet me,&quot; Dave replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you keep repeating that?&quot; I asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I think our meeting was memorable,&quot; Dave shrugged.<br />
<br />
I only sighed, &quot;we're getting there, yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Going into town was fairly simple. Once Molly went in to get her resume and my truck keys from the guest room, I waited outside by my truck. Once she returned, we were quick to go about our mission. Since the schools were likely out for the summer, we would need to find the town's Central Office to drop off the resume, which would actually take a bit of looking. Molly had actually borrowed the phone book from her Uncle's home and was going through the pages as I drove toward town.<br />
<br />
That part wasn't too hard. The phone book was actually for a fairly wide area, but Molly was able to pin it down from her position in the back seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;While you're at, can you get the address for their police station, or the local sheriff's office?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; she respond, and looked up the address for both.<br />
<br />
We then spent a while to actually get to the address of the Columbia Falls School District's Central Office, mostly as I didn't know the streets. We passed one lone park in the process, but I was fairly sure Molly also saw it. Once we got there, it appeared there was a little activity going on, but not much. So it didn't appear that things didn't always shut down for the summer. I found an open spot to park and then began the &quot;process&quot; of letting Molly out.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may take me a little while to deal with my business at their station an/or sheriff's office,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can wait here,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;they have bench over there to sit on, and I think I'd enjoy the sunlight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll promise not to chase any deer if they wander by?&quot; I teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try not to,&quot; Molly gave slight chuckle, &quot;It's not hunting season.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; I smiled back, &quot;I'll try to be quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It took me about five minutes to find the Columbia Falls Police Station, and I cursed myself for my lack of unfamiliarity with the streets. I found a place to park and then entered the station. Once inside, I approached the desk officer on duty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something you wish to report, sir,&quot; the desk officer spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is George Wayne, I don't actually have anything to report, actually,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;I'm actually looking for employment, actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do not handle unemployment issues, sir,&quot; the desk officer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me explain,&quot; I argued, &quot;I studied to get into law enforcement in college and a looking to see if your station has any opening or can provide the appropriate training.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're looking to work for the Columbia Falls Police Department?&quot; the desk officer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm asking if you have the openings... and if you do, I'm asking for the appropriate information on how to apply and where I can get the training you require.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait here a moment,&quot; the desk officer answered.<br />
<br />
The desk officer then left the desk area and walked into an office that was nearby. A few moments later she returned with a uniformed officer following.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Chief Roger Harold, my desk officer says you're interested in law enforcement?&quot; the man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I only inquiring at the moment,&quot; I answered, &quot;I don't know if you have any openings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chief Harold slowly nodded, &quot;It'd be best if you came with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then led me into his office. We both sat down, and he quickly came down to business.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what makes you interested in the Columbia Falls Police?&quot; Chief Harold asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my girlfriend I were thinking about moving to a place like this that has a bit more open space then where we're from,&quot; I explained, &quot;and she's learned that your school district might need a teacher's assistant, and is trying get her own application in right now. And I've always had an interest in protecting people, so I thought I would ask you if you had any openings, and for the appropriate information on how to apply and get the training required.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Chief Harold said slowly, &quot;At present we have no openings, but in a few months one of my older officers will be retiring, and we'll be putting out the ads then. From what my desk officer says, you haven't had formal training yet, so we can't accept you until you've gone through training... but I do admire good go-getters who want to help their society. If you can get me a resume and a copy of your college transcripts, I'll help you with the paperwork to put you in &quot;the academy&quot; in Kalispell. Once they get you to the point to send you on field training, write down Columbia Falls as your desired station, and they'll take it from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd do that for me?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to have a lot of heart for this sort of thing,&quot; he said, &quot;Not the smartest on the application process, but a lot of heart. Reminds me of my nephew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I ask where he is now?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a police Captain in Helena,&quot; Chief Harold gave sort of fatherly smile.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were joining the county sheriff's office,&quot; Dave commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Columbia Falls PD,&quot; I relied, &quot;I'm not sure where you got the county sheriff's office from... unless I misspoke earlier...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think you did,&quot; Dave replied.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The talk with Chief Harold left me feeling rather optimistic, especially since Molly and I wouldn't have to associate with Mr. Beauregard to do it. The return trip to the school was quicker time as I had figured out the easiest way between the two points. I found Molly seated on the bench with several kids around her, and some had even volunteered her as their jungle gym. A nervous teacher stood nearby, but I could see that Molly was very calm with the children. I got out and slowly approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Molly,&quot; I quipped, &quot;You seem to have become the center of attention since I last saw you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're district runs a sort of &quot;day-care&quot; for their younger kids,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;I appeared to have walked right into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the tiger-lady?&quot; one of the kids asked me as he tickled a little girl's neck with the tip of Molly's tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know her very well,&quot; I gave a chuckle at the apparent nickname, &quot;I am her date.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Date?&quot; the boy cringed &quot;ewwwwwwww!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys are icky,&quot; the girl said to Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;George isn't,&quot; Molly told her, and rubbed her head with one of her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are George Wayne?&quot; the teacher asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Maria Fitzpatrick, one of the kindergarten teachers here, and I run the district's &quot;summer sun&quot; program, &quot;Ms. Rhoer has told me she's looking for work as a teachers aide... and the kids here have taken to her very well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that,&quot; I gave a slight smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, well, because of it, I'm willing to give her a shot,&quot; Maria answered, &quot;she'll need to complete the &quot;summer sun&quot; program before anything final is done...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll hire her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the summer works out,&quot; Maria answered.<br />
<br />
I did the only thing I could think to do, I cheered.</p>
