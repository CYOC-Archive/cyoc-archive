<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike was coming home from a ten hour shift at a library. The library was on campus and routinely walked to work and home. It was an easy  job and enjoyed the library patrons and his coworkers. He was a pretty good looking guy, 27, half Hispanic and Caucasian, 5'11&quot; and 185#s.  His hair a almost black but lightened to a brownish red when the sun passed through it. Big expressive brown eyes were his best feature.<br />
<br />
After passing a campus engineering building that was made up of a corrugated metal exterior and passing through a lot of land which was fenced off previously, he found an amulet.  The base of the amulet was composed of a gold or bronze colored metal and on top there was a triangle with intricate designs sketched, in the center was an ominous purple stone of some sort.  The gemstone was cloudy and semi-transparent, Mike wondered what it was worth.<br />
<br />
After arriving home he got on the computer and fantasized an old teacher he used to have in middle school, Mr. Kilcoyne was his name. When Mike was in 6th grade he was attracted to the vice principal of the school, Mr. Anthony.  Mr. Anthony was not very attractive to most people's standards, lanky, bald and prejudiced, but Mike admired the power and authority he had.  He wished he was Mr. Anthony.  One day during a school presentation Mr. Anthony, who liked western clothing, wore a pair of tight corduroy wranglers. Mike saw the bulge in his crotch and couldn't keep his eyes off of it. No one seemed to notice except Mr. Kilcoyne who was a coach at the time. As Mike was leaving the presentation he noticed a light rubbing on his arms and was shocked to see the intimidating junior high coach who yelled at his students like a drill instructor while making his class do calisthenics was rubbing the hairs on his knuckles on Mike's arm and smiling at him.  Mr. Kilcoyne knew Mike liked guys.  Being in shock Mike fled, but this was not the last time he would meet Mr. Kilcoyne.<br />
<br />
When Mike was a little older he yelled at a Spanish teacher and was sent to an alternative school called the guidance center. The first morning was entered his new school he was getting used to the discipline and new routine it required. There were metal detectors in the entrance a student had to pass through successfully, and there was a strict code of silence in the sense that talking was a punishable offense. A student was supposed to stay quiet. Mike saw Mr. Kilcoyne and wondered what were the chances of him becoming his teacher.<br />
<br />
Mr. Kilcoyne was a few years older, and a few pounds heavier. He wore grey slacks and a tucked in collared white shirt with cuff links in a professional manner. His domineering personality that existed in junior high school seemed to have been replaced with one of passivity. Mr. Kilcoyne also had a completely white head of hair and a double chin from his additional weight. His ancestry was Irish and looked extremely Caucasian.<br />
<br />
As the beginning of the school period approached the new students were told which teacher they would have at their new school. As luck would have it, Mr. Kilcoyne was Mike's teacher during his time there. Mike could not believe it.<br />
<br />
Something changed in Mr. Kilcoyne since his first encounter with the coach; he was more docile. During Mike's first day some other new students were having trouble finding their newly respective teacher, Mr. Kilcoyne, and a female teacher screamed &quot;THIS IS KILCOYNE!&quot;. Mr. Kilcoyne slunk his shoulders in shame as his body language conveyed the message of a man who was passively defeated and ashamed while all eyes were on him.<br />
<br />
Mike knew who Mr. Kilcoyne was and though he was afraid of reciprocating affection to his teacher, he wanted to. He wondered if his teacher would make any more advances.  In class Mike observed Mr. Kilcoyne. Teachers were not to talk in class either, the environment was almost complete silence. His new school was a very boring place to work, observing Mr. Kilcoyne was almost exciting.  There were a few peculiar things Mike noticed. Mr. Kilcoyne would sometimes type on a computer and have a very rigid posture, it was as if Mr. Kilcoyne had something in his rectum. Also, sometimes a bullying student would have fun even with Mr. Kilcoyne and he would submit to the young person's demands. For instance, once a student asked Mr. Kilcoyne about his cuff links, the student had very little interest in what they were and only liked dominating his teacher. Mr. Kilcoyne answered all the badgering students questions even if he was slightly annoyed. The teacher had catered to the student and now the boy raised asked for larger demands and asked if he could see the cuff links.  Mr. Kilcoyne emitted a barely audible sound as he exhaled his gasp at the increasingly audacious request and submitted; he gave up. Mr. Kilcoyne would not stand up to even an adolescent now.<br />
<br />
Mike observed these things in Mr. Kilcoyne and secretly wanted to become like him. There was something perverted but sincere about being Mr. Kilcoyne.<br />
<br />
When Mike got home from work he took out the amulet as he fondled a piece of paper his old teacher, Mr. Kilcoyne, wrote a memo on and...</p>
