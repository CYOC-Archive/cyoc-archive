Nicole took a short while to think about Nolan&#39;s offer, it along with his apology seemed genuine and <br />
after seeing the watch in action figured; if they he was going to harm me or anything else, he&#39;d have <br />
done it by now.<br />
&quot;ok Nolan, I&#39;ll take you up on that, you&#39;re going to let me use that watch as I want until a say otherwise&quot;  <br />
she said as she crossed her arms and shot him a glare so cold Nolan could feel the hairs on his neck <br />
stand up. <br />
&quot;deal&quot; Nolan said &quot;well what do you want to do first then&quot; Nicole was stumped, she wasn&#39;t sure what <br />
she wanted. She&#39;d thought what she&#39;d want if she&#39;s ever gotten a chance like this. It was like a genie in a <br />
bottle but with unlimited wishes. But now she was drawing blanks. Then it came to here, a memory, or <br />
rather the memory of a feeling.<br />
How her skin had felt as the fur was creeping up her skin, the cool refreshing feeling that had been <br />
smothered by fear and disbelief. How the clacking of her hooves rang out across the floor, each step <br />
she&#39;d took felt like and accomplishment maintaining her balance. But most of all how her udder had felt <br />
as it swelled with milk and how Nolan had eased the pressure and replaced it with pleasure.<br />
She snapped out of her trance when she noticed Nolan giving her a strange look. Without thinking it <br />
through Nicole blurted out &quot;I wana transform again!&quot; Nolan was shocked, he hadn&#39;t been expecting her <br />
to jump to that. For the most part he&#39;d expected her use the watch to exact her revenge. There was a <br />
long pause between the two of them. &quot;but not into a cow again!&quot; Nicole began &quot;it wasn&#39;t very <br />
comfortable, the pressure and all. I wana pick what... what I... become&quot;<br />
Saying it out loud made Nicole realize how real her situation was. Here, laid out in front of her she could <br />
become anything she wanted but still drew a blank as to what she wanted to become. Nolan began to <br />
fiddle with the watch. &quot;well what do you want to turn into then&quot; he asked. Nicole hesitated &quot;I don&#39;t <br />
know yet, I&#39;ll need some time I guess, this all still feels imposable&quot;<br />
Nolan stopped his fiddling &quot;ok well... what do you want to do in the meantime then?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know that <br />
ether&quot; she replied holding her sides and turning her head away, embarrassed to be so empty headed.  <br />
She continued &quot;but I know I want to do it somewhere more comfortable then here&quot; she gestured to the <br />
kitchen. &quot;I take it you have someplace in mind&quot; asked Nolan. &quot;yeah, we can go to my apartment, it&#39;s just <br />
a few blocks down the road&quot; she turned her attention to the kitchen door. &quot;but I can&#39;t close the shop <br />
with all those customers still here&quot; <br />
&quot;I can handle that&quot; Nolan walked past her and to the door. He aimed the watch through the crack and <br />
sweeped it across the crowed that had gathered within the caf&#65533;. Nicole joined him and peered through <br />
the door.<br />
Slowly the customers one by one finished there drinks, some looking at their watches, others their <br />
phones, but they all left the shop in a matter of a few minutes. The two walked into the center of the <br />
empty shop. Nolan smirked &quot;think you can close now? Nicole walked to the door and flipped the sign <br />
over &quot;let me guess, the watch&quot; Nolan nodded his head &quot;how? Will they be alright?&quot; she asked. &quot;Another <br />
function of the watch is control; I just made them all think they had forgotten something or had other <br />
places to be. They&#39;ll be confused for a little but they won&#39;t get hurt if that&#39;s what your concerned about&quot; <br />
he explained<br />
Nicole shot him a glair &quot;you didn&#39;t...&quot; Nolan through his arms up in defense &quot;I didn&#39;t use it on you I <br />
swear!&quot; by now Nolan had seen that look in her eye a half dozen times. He knew that if given the chance <br />
she&#39;s back up the threat behind her glair.<br />
She made her way over to the register and began to cash out for the day. While she did her closing <br />
procedure Nolan took the time to reflect. Just this morning he&#39;d gotten the watch, mostly moved into <br />
his apartment, cast punishment on the noisy neighbor, played with Nicole, then played with her some <br />
more. <br />
He wondered how it was that he could change, what was her name... oh Maggie? How could he change <br />
Maggie so dramatically without even a second thought but then do the same thing to Nicole and be so <br />
torn up inside over it. Sure the filter had been on in Maggie&#39;s case she&#39;d never know that she&#39;d been <br />
transformed into a giant pig woman. was Nicole&#39;s reaction to the changes enough to shake him up? But <br />
afterward she&#39;d seem to come to terms with it, then again she&#39;d also had his apology and offer as a kind <br />
of buy off.<br />
He pondered after a bit and found his resolve in the watch. He made the decision, with the watch he <br />
had a golden opportunity to do what he pleased. He may as well take advantage of it. From now on he <br />
would change people as he wanted but with discretion and not without good reason or good fun. But he <br />
still owed it to Nicole to finish his part of the deal, besides it might be nice to have a friend along for the <br />
ride.<br />
&quot;okay, ready to go?&quot; Nicole asked, she was staring at Nolan lost in thought, she waved her hand to his <br />
face, catching his attention. He snapped out of his train of thought &quot;sorry, was thinking of something&quot; <br />
They made their way to the door and onto the street heading for Nicole&#39;s apartment .they didn&#39;t say <br />
anything to each other for the first block they walked, or the second. Nolan noticed the awkward silence <br />
setting in, he was eager to break it seeing the pattern of hostility coming from Nicole, he couldn&#39;t blame her after what had happened. <br />
&quot;sooo, Nicole... umm can you tell me about yourself&quot; Nolan meekly broke the silence. She returned with <br />
a puzzled look &quot;like what? Is this a dating show or something?&quot; she chuckled trying to shake off the <br />
question. &quot;well I mean I&#39;d like to know you a little better, I guess&quot; he was trying not to blush over how <br />
bad this was going. &quot;ok well what would you like to know&quot; she entertained the questioning. &quot;have any <br />
family around town?&quot;<br />
&quot;my mother and father live a few hours away from the city but my sister lives just on the other side of <br />
town. She&#39;s a waitress at a rather high-end restaurant&quot;<br />
&quot;oh, are you two close?&quot;<br />
&quot;mmmmm kinda we talk on the phone once or twice a week but never really hangout that much <br />
anymore&quot;<br />
&quot;how about the coffee shop? Are you the owner?&quot;<br />
&quot;yeah I work the books and pay the bills, I&#39;m lucky that business has been steady.&quot;<br />
&quot;so any friends, do anything for fun?&quot;<br />
&quot;well the shop keeps me pretty busy, it&#39;s a one person job for how small it is but when I can I go out to a <br />
bar nearby with a few friends.&quot; She came to a stop &quot;here we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
The apartment building seemed new but with a simple design, it was two stories high with stairs leading <br />
to landing on the second floor, with two doors on both floors. Nicole led them up the stairs to the first <br />
door, sorted through her keys and made her way in, Nolan following shortly behind her.<br />
Nicole&#39;s apartment was much larger than the building led on to believe. The kitchen was well made with <br />
oak cabinets and a lot of counter space. The living room was well furnished with two large sofas and a <br />
few coffee tables at each end. They didn&#39;t seem to be from the same set but still complemented each <br />
other. <br />
Nicole made her way into her room and came out with a towel &quot;I&#39;m going to take a shower, I still don&#39;t <br />
know what I want to do yet and well I guess the water might help me think. Make yourself at home, just <br />
be respectable&quot; she closed the door and soon Nolan herd water running from the shower.<br />
Nolan kicked off his shoes and left them by the door. He began to make his way around the apartment <br />
he began to examine her movie collection a small book shelf filled with DVDs. He noticed she had a large <br />
handful of monster movies even a few Godzilla classics. He made his way to a desk in the corner of the <br />
room, her laptop was plugged in and charging next to it was a Nintendo 3DS also charging, he flipped it <br />
open and viewed the screen, he nodded his head in agreement and made his way to the bookshelf next <br />
to the desk. A number of glass figurines rested on display on the top shelf.<br />
Nolan sat on the one of the sofas and began to explore the other options of the watch as he waited for <br />
Nicole to figure out what she would do with it, he began to brainstorm some options for her in case she <br />
still hadn&#39;t bade up her mind...</p>
