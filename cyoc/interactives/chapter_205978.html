<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The chairs start to move again. Douglas now spun around and tilted forward. Head pressed against Yrk&#39;s chest, as the orc&#39;s own seat rises to pierce into the man. Their instincts taking over as Doug surrenders and the devices are put to work. Short and hard thrusts made into his ass, all the while he snuggles against the brutes&#39; hard pecs. Getting comfort from his fellow orc, as the changes progress at a slower pace. His small head growing to the size of the greenskin&#39;s pec. His chest heaving with heavier breaths as it spreads out and matches the creature before him. His mind simplifying to primitive needs and desires. An orc once more born, before they two are separated and the pipe snakes its way down Doug&#39;s throat. Forcing the antidote into his system as he goes back to a mostly human form.<br />
<br />
Though even after this dose, two thumb length tusks jut out of his mouth. Course hairs sit across his chest and arms. Body remains a foot taller than any human could be. Even his mind is in a complete daze. There&#39;s more loyalty to this facility and to these researchers. Douglas struggles to form any words of offense to them, just getting deep groans and grunts as the head of this group restates the command.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Repeat the process&quot;<br />
<br />
The third time around, the seats force Douglas to suck on the orcs cock. Sinking it far down his throat as the same changes progress. Reborn again as a strong and dim-witted orc and cured into a more human state by the pipe. Though stronger than he was as a mere human, taking more of this orcish influence into him as the fourth procedure begins. Doug first grinded against the brute&#39;s body. Allowing him to explore the detailed muscles with his nose and tongue. More eager than the previous times as he takes in every detail of this monster, knowing just how good it feels to be just like him. Strong, so very strong. With no need to worry about anything but what your dick needs and what these researchers want. The barely human man lowering to once more be deepthroated by the beast before him. His changes this time far slower than before. Not able to reach the extremes of a full orc, but still taking on more of the orcish traits. <br />
<br />
His skin becoming a dull green in its entirety. Head squared with two finger length tusks jutting out. Brows thick and nose enlarged, neck short and connecting to a body easily 21 inches wide. The now 7ft tall creature having arms like tree trunks and legs to match. Hairy, but not enough to hide the muscle and skin underneath. Cock almost as thick as a man&#39;s fist and easily reaching to ten inches in its current state. Two bull-like balls hanging from underneath, still filled with cum even after his several climaxes. <br />
<br />
As he drinks the last drips of what Yrk offers, the full orc&#39;s chair descends down below. Dissapearing from sight as the floor returns, alongside the pipe from above. Douglas feeling more control over himself compared to the last few times. Opening his mouth willingly, letting the liquid fill him, and seeing not a single alteration to his new self. He remains a brawny half-orc, and he wouldn&#39;t want anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems he developed an immunity to it. I&#39;d say test successful. Right, mate?&quot;<br />
<br />
The lead researcher asks, gesturing to the new monster who responds with a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Feels good. Offer to join your company still up?&quot;<br />
&quot;Course it is mate. Long as you&#39;re willing to let us in on whatever you were up to.&quot;<br />
&quot;I live for TrueVision, anything you want to know, I&#39;ll say it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas speaks with clear confidence. The bracelet having finished imprinting into his mind. Wiping away former loyalties as they forged new ones. Pictures entering his thoughts, the various executives of the company that he has nothing but respect for. The CEO who he would do anything to serve. Everyone else means nothing to him, his former friends and allies discarded... at least partially. Vince would make a good executive with him after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rest of you, bugger off and finish up your notes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The older man says to the others in the room. Letting out a jovial laugh towards the end, as they hurry off and have the door shut behind them. The roof opening one last time. Hoses and nozzles descending from the sky and washing Doug clean. The new monsters vision obstructed by the water, and when it clears, he sees something different than the singlet wearing man from before. Though the clothing is still the same, the person is not. Rather than looking at an older human, he&#39;s seeing a grizzled werebear. Douglas&#39;s bindings loosen and his bracelet falls free, as the bear offers a handshake which the half-orc eagerly accepts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never told you my name. It&#39;s Kraig.&quot;<br />
&quot;Douglas. I&#39;m guessing all executives are monsters?&quot;<br />
&quot;Smart boy, you&#39;re right. We&#39;re monsters that kept a hold of our senses after the change. But that change... it&#39;s euphoric isn&#39;t it, mate?&quot;<br />
<br />
He had only just finished his transformation, but thinking back to that process was delightful to the former human. How his weak and feeble body was granted new strength. How he watched his thin chest bulk with two meaty pecs. How he was close to such a sexy monster like Yrk, and took in every detail of that attractive brute. It was all still clear in his head, especially his thick dick. In fact... he had a nice ass, maybe he&#39;ll put it to use when he feels pent up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just cleaned you mate, don&#39;t make me get the hoses again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug looks to his leaking cock and pre-stained hand. Having rubbed the tip while lost in thought, and cleaning it off by running his hand through the metal seating. The half-orc spotting Kraig&#39;s own hand being wet and sticky, with a clear tent in his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might need them for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hah! It&#39;s hard not to rub when you think of it. I was in early testing, they put me through a hell of a process, and ended it with the CEO&#39;s dick down my throat. My congratulations into joining the company, choking on dragon dick.&quot;<br />
&quot;Think I&#39;ll get to experience that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Course mate! CEO always welcomes a new exec like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two men are speaking, an announcement rings out from the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alert. Final stages are beginning. Please go to your stations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kraig looks to the direction of the sound with a grin. Handing over a vest and shorts for Douglas to change into, before clasping an arm on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect timing. Fun&#39;s about to start! I&#39;ll explain it while we work. C&#39;mon.&quot;</p>
