<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><b>Flash<br />
Flash<br />
Flash</b><br />
<br />
As soon as the flash ended, I immediately felt pain in my stomach as I’ve went up against the wall again. <br />
<br />
‘Oh come on.’ I muttered as I held my stomach, and I refocus to the front of me at the person who apparently just punch me. It was Hank McAllister the school bully; 16 years old now and at this time a rising football star on our school team. Big burly dude and he was glaring at me; seething with anger.<br />
<br />
“What’s your problem, Hank?” I asked trying to get answers.<br />
<br />
“This is your fault you and this odd magic.” Hanks spat back.<br />
<br />
“Pardon me?” I asked looking confused.<br />
<br />
“Before all this, I had a semi happy life. My parents were happy together granted my dad was not the best of people but at least he didn’t do those things and now I have a few younger half siblings when I was happy at being an only child.” Hank said. Oh so this was this is all about, since this whole wish of everyone at the party experiencing Brad’s birthday parties resulted in a lot of relationships changes. From what I overheard during Brad’s third and eighth birthday parties; I guess it was Hank’s father that had an affair with Trixie and raped Mrs. Brockman’s maid staff. However, he is now in jail for the crimes and not to mention had a few illegitimate children.<br />
<br />
“If you’re gonna ask me for apology, you better not. Because this is literally changed our history and there’s nothing I can do about it.” I said, standing up straight. Hank just got angrier and was about to punch me only to be the grabbed then restrained by Gretchen, Mrs. Brockman’s German maid with the body of a muscle builder. And just like with Nadia, Mrs. Brockman appeared in front of him. Mrs. Brockman was wearing a stylish bikini with a theme of leopard spots.<br />
<br />
“I should’ve listened to my guts and ban you from these parties thirteen years ago.” Mrs. Brockman stated earning a shock look from Hank. “After the stunts your dad pull, I watched you closely. Your mother even stood up for you even though she said you were developing the same anger issues as your father. Now you attacked one of my guest, in fact, one of my most important guest.”<br />
<br />
“But all of this is because of him everything that has hap…” Hank trying to come up with something until Mrs. Brockman cut him off.<br />
<br />
“So what? If you gotta ask nicely after all this was over you probably had this change. But now you wasted that opportunity you are here by forbidden to come back here unless you were invited by my son himself.” Mrs. Brockman said as Gretchen began taking Hank away. As Mrs. Brockman watched Gretchen drag Hank away, 22 year old Monique came up to me and checked over me.<br />
<br />
“You okay Joey?” Ask Monique. I grunted and just nodded in response. She looked towards Mrs. Brockman, who just gave her a nod and started leading me somewhere. <br />
<br />
“Where are we going?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“The Jacuzzi, you need some time to recover.” Monique said and then got closer and she led me and whispered. ‘I’m sorry about Nadia. In the previous life, she was always looking down on me and being superior. I guess you practically sent her over the edge. She’s currently in France being looked after by relatives and to make sure she graduated college correctly and not bother you.’ With that we stopped for a bit as she turned my head towards her and gave me a kiss on the lips. <br />
<br />
“It’s okay.” I said with a smile as we continue our journey out of the mansion and into the back yard. Sure enough this birthday party was another pool party with the maid staff and Monique being lifeguards. That’s why I’m still wearing a swimsuit and an orange T-shirt. We did get a few stares as Monique led me to the Jacuzzi. Once we got there, I took off my shirt and got in.<br />
<br />
The water felt nice and warm as I said in the Jacuzzi for the next 30 minutes, I even close my eyes a few times. However after 30 minutes, I heard a commotion and open my eyes to look in the direction of where it was coming from. I saw, and I wasn’t the only one staring, Mrs. Brockman along with 15-year-old Brad, 15-year-old Jessica, and finally 14 1/2 year-old Gabe and I was catching the talons of a argument.<br />
<br />
“How dare you talk about my son like that. You’re supposed to be his girlfriend?” Mrs. Brockman ask before giving a chuckle. “Not a chance.” Before turning towards Brad. “Brad, honey I am sorry, but you are not allowed to date this girl.”<br />
<br />
Brad hung his head as if he was just scolded. Jessica was going to say something until Mrs. Brockman head maid Natsumi came up to them.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi take this girl to the foyer and call her parents to come pick her up.” Mrs. Brockman ordered Natsumi nodded her head as she grabbed the shocked Jessica and let her away. Mrs. Brockman then let her to where I was and got into the Jacuzzi with me. She gave a sigh as she.<br />
<br />
“Well, that was something.” I commented. She then look at me with a smile.<br />
<br />
‘One of a few things I like about what happening right now that I can ‘correct’ a few things. I really never approve of Jessica.’ Whispered Mrs. Brockman as we turn our heads to look at Brad, who looked devastated, but was being comfort by Gabe. From my new memories, Gabe was still a shy nerd but he came best friends in the form of me and Brad causing all of us to form a trio of sorts. However, in all honesty, he liked hanging out with Brad more often than I did.<br />
<br />
‘If I’m being honest, I think Gabe would’ve been a better match for Brad. If only he was born a girl.’ Whispered Mrs. Brockman. Now there was an idea for a trick. As Mrs. Brockman close her eyes to relax I got out the Jacuzzi, dried off, and put back on my T-shirt. I had inside the mansion to the place that I know where the stage will be when we’re back to back to normal. I silently made the wish to fast-forward to the next birthday party. Only two birthdays to go.</p>
