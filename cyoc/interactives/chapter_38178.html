<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Several days had passed since Steven's
change. Things were still far from normal,
but the trauma of her experience had faded
at least a little bit. She no longer woke
up shocked by her new body, and she was
beginning to sleep easier as she realized
that her abductors really weren't coming
back. Of course, every silver lining has a
cloud, and Steven was still not even close
to being used to her new body, let
<i>alone</i> willing to face the prospect
of life as an Oni girl.</p>
<p>And new stressors had sprung up to fill
the void; for instance, her growing taste
for very spicy food. This, she knew from
the manga, was an Oni trait, and it
frightened her to think that her
personality might be changing. There was
some relief to be had in the fact that
this was the <i>only</i> noticeable change
in her behavior, and it was entirely
possible that she just had a biologically
higher tolerance for capsaicin now, but it
still bothered her.</p>
<p>There were also areas she was doing
okay in. She was pretty much past the
trouble she'd had with hygiene; after all,
she hadn't really had much of a choice
about going to the bathroom as a girl, and
once she had gotten over that, it had only
taken a couple days for her to decide "the
hell with it" and start taking showers
again. And it had helped, when she was
coming to terms with wearing women's
underwear, that her mom wasn't pressuring
her to dress femininely.</p>
<p>But the only thing she had truly
accepted was flight. Steven loved being
able to hover in mid-air, and often found
it more comfortable than sitting; in fact,
about the only times she rested on
horizontal surfaces any more were at the
table (at her mother's insistence) in the
bathroom and during sleep. Unfortunately,
it turned out that clothing <i>did</i>
impair her aerial mobility, which had led
her to stick pretty much with bikinis, but
she felt it was worth the tradeoff.</p>
<p>On this particular morning, Steven was
listening to <i>Close To The Edge</i> and
sorting through the manga she'd bought
that fateful night. Things were going just
fine until she finished sorting, which was
when she realized that a volume of
<i>Elfen Lied</i> she'd bought was
missing. The series had been recommended
to her by an online friend; she'd been
told it was good, but also that it was
terribly violent and quite a downer. She
was willing to give it a shot, although
the only thing she knew for sure about it
was that it was about a race of mutants
with small horns and telekinetic
powers.</p>
<p>Steven was busy looking for the missing
volume when she heard a car coming up the
driveway. She looked out her window and
saw it was the nondescript vehicle driven
by the Men in Black. Since there was no
need to hide with them,she simply opened
the window, scooted through, and drifted
down to a few feet above the ground. She
wondered whether they might have found a
way to change her back, but the look on
Agent Fields's face was too grim for
that.</p>
<p>Agent Thomson got out of the car as
well, but neither of the men showed any
inclination to talk until Steven's mother
came out. "Well," Fields said, "first
things first you ought to know that HQ has
finished the 'official' version of your
story. It will be arriving in a couple of
days, in the form of a medical case
document on Steven's 'experience.' We
would suggest that you wait a month or two
before re-introducing her to the public;
after that, the officiality of the
document should allow people to
retroactively remember Steven as showing
nonspecific warning signs the last time
they saw him."</p>
<p>"That sounds good," Steven's mother
said. "Is there anything else?"</p>
<p>Fields sighed. "Yes. I'm afraid we need
to ask for your help. We found another
victim, apparently a target of the same
ship that altered Steven. Her changes
snapped an already strained relationship
with her family, and she has no place to
stay."</p>
<p>Steven's mother laughed. "Is
<i>that</i> all? Of <i>course</i> she can
stay here. We have plenty of room in the
house, and more than enough privacy to
keep her a secret if necessary."</p>
<p>Fields allowed himselfa half-smile. "We
do appreciate your willingness to assist,
but there's more than that. She's
obviously troubled, and although she
hasn't turned violent or given any such
indication, it's possible she might. And
if she does, you and Steven could be in
grave danger."</p>
<p>Steven looked at her mother, who seemed
contemplative. "Well," she said, after a
minute, "we'll take that risk. I doubt you
have any better place to put her, and I
won't just sit by and let some poor girl
go homeless. Besides, Steven probably
understands what she's going through
better than anyone."</p>
<p>Fields nodded. "Very well. Anna, why
don't you get out and say hello?"</p>
<p>Thomson opened the rear passenger door
of the vehicle, and a girl stepped out.
She looked much like any other teenage
girl except for her deep blue hair and the
small, triangular horns on her head. Her
face was tear-streaked, but right now she
just looked...numb.</p>
<p>Thomson handed something to Fields, who
in turn handed it to Steven. "She had this
with her," he said. "We believe it's
yours."</p>
<p>It was the missing volume of <i>Elfen
Lied.</i></p></p>
