<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike sat down and browsed the machine, he wasn’t the most tech savvy man out there but despite that he was able to quickly locate what he was looking for. Obviously he wasn’t the only one with the curiosity for it to be so easy to find. <br />
<br />
He made the modification to himself and his son and clicked submit, making both of their genitals detachable.  He de-selected the default option of making the appendage fit the body, instead he opted to make the person’s perception to others fit the appendage.  They would swap roles and genitals, but not bodies.<br />
<br />
While that was processing, Mike grew nervous about what his 16 year old son would think about his shamefully kinky endeavor.  <br />
<br />
He went into Jeff&#39;s mental status made a key  change.  Mike added an itch of curiosity to his son, what that would make me curious of what it would be like to have a piece of his father attached to him.  He made sure to give his son the same sort of bashful longing he  himself had towards the idea. Mike submitted that change as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was easier than I expected.&quot; Mike said, signaling he was done to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff gave him a quick up and down. &quot;I don&#39;t notice any difference, did you play with the reality settings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but my... um, our... bodies won’t really be changing but…&quot; Mike began hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on.&quot; Jeff said, intrigued and a tad excited to hear what plan his dad had in mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this may seem strange but I made our genitals swappable...&quot; Mike paused and Jeff just looked on with interest. <br />
<br />
“Well the reason I did this oddly specific change is just…” Mike took a deep breath before he took his son on a trip down memory lane. <br />
“Jeff, son, do you remember grandpa Hank?  Growing up, your gramps was as strict as a man could be.  He was firm in his beliefs of what separates men from boys and he hardly gave me any freedom growing up.  I rarely ever called him something as familiar as ‘dad’.  It was always ‘Sir’ or I was talking to a wall.”  Mike closed his eyes, he could remember the lectures like it was yesterday.  When he opened them he looked down at himself and faintly chuckled. <br />
“Not to brag or make you feel awkward in anyway son but nowadays, I think look pretty good for a man in his 40s.  But growing up, that was far from the truth.  I was what you might call a ‘late bloomer.’ Didn’t really grow into my looks until I was around 21 and your grandpa wouldn’t let he hear the end of it!  I guess what I’m trying to say is that I want is a sort of… do-over?  Well, a partial one at least.”<br />
<br />
Mike sighed and continued. “Your gramps sure was an odd one.  Always would go on and on about how the junk between a man’s legs determines his lot in life.  Whether or not others can even see it our not, it’s there, and it matters.  At least that’s how he put it anyway.”  Mike blushed as he began to explain what he did when with the chronivac, at least partially. <br />
“Well, by swapping our um… ‘parts’… down there, your machine here will shift the perspectives of the people that see us. They’ll perceive me as a teenager, your son. I’ll get a chance to temporarily experience my teens, but in a more developed body.  I remember being in a rush to grow up at your age son and now that you&#39;re almost an adult... it... well... I thought... maybe... if you wondered what it would be like... umm...&quot; Mike was at a loss for how to further describe his highly specific interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I get you dad... and I do wonder.&quot; Jeff cut in. &quot;I still remember not wanting to grow up ever and birthday parties with piñatas, but now that I’m 16 going on 17, I kinda like… settling here?  It’s like, I want to stay me but… I want to try to see firsthand what it looks if people’s perception of me change. If they… saw me for more that what I really am.  Dad this is kinda embarrassing but… I just really feel trying to carry that ‘part’ of you.  Is that weird?”<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the little mental nudge from the chronivac must have been working.  Mike nodded along as he let his son speak of his developing thoughts further.<br />
<br />
“I can relate to how much things change over time, and being in the middle of my puberty years, I’m curious about what its like to be past this in… um, a ‘certain area’ at least, so I can appreciate it more as I&#39;m going through it?&quot; Jeff looked to the wall deep in thought. <br />
“Dad, if I knew what adulthood felt like without having to completely leave my teenage body behind, maybe I&#39;d know when I&#39;m there and I... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike smiled, placing a hand on Jeff&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Feel a little more prepared for it?&quot; he offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Jeff said with a heavy sigh, his shoulders slumped as he released the newfound anxiety that had been scratching its way ever closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we can both see what its like on the &#39;other&#39; side of our roles.&quot; Mike reached into his pants and an audible whirring sound was heard as his penis detached. &quot;If you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated, he knew that this was an important moment but it felt like such a minor thing, after all it was reversible, and temporary, and what he wanted,.. right? Jeff thought back to his only reference of this situation, cartoons or movies where children grow up or swap places, but this was different. He and his dad were in it together from the start, and he isn&#39;t at risk of aging to death since their bodies themselves wouldn’t change.  Also, all those shows skip over sex, alcohol, and vacation getaways, and without those, what&#39;s the point of being considered an adult? <br />
<br />
Jeff reached down is own waistband, gripped his penis and pulled. With a little resistance his penis and testicles came off as a complete package along with some of the surrounding pubic area... &quot;Yeah, lets try it.&quot; Jeff said nervously.<br />
<br />
Mike locked eyes with Jeff and made a display of putting his hand out facing up. then his hand bearing his junk came out. <br />
<br />
Jeff was awestruck, in his father’s large hands was what can only be described as a true specimen of “manhood.”  It was soft. but he could still notice a subtle shimmer by the tip of the foreskin.  It hinted at precum.  His father’s 8-inch cock and hairy balls were barely held in an open grip, it was the only way to grasp it all.  <br />
<br />
Jeff placed his hand under Mike&#39;s penis, the hairiness of the testicles felt so foreign.  <br />
<br />
Jeff pulled his own junk from his pants, placing it over Mikes outstretched hand. <br />
<br />
Mike carried what would be his new boyhood with great care.  Despite Jeff being in the throes of ever approaching adulthood, his crotch told a story similar to his fathers.  Despite Jeff physically appearing more mature than Mike was at his age, his young cock would certainly have been deemed by his grandfather as that of a mere boy. <br />
<br />
After the handoff was made, the exposed penises were placed into their new homes. The penises aligned themselves automatically as they seamlessly reattached into their rightful position. The immense treasure trail pubes that had disappeared from his fathers lower torso has grown and found it’s way onto Jeff’s otherwise unaltered body.  The jungle of hair centered around one location on the otherwise hairless teen only made the newly swapped part even more prevalent. <br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s original penis obviously had more heft to it.  Jeff almost seemed to have shift his stance to accommodate the new appendage.  The treasure trail spreading up from his groin was more like a route to riches.  But now instead of leading up to Mike’s hairy pecs, it ended at Jeff’s smooth yet trimmed chest.<br />
<br />
Mike looked down at his own crotch and back at Jeff, prompting him to say, &quot;I think you&#39;re winning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled nervously, unsure what to say or do in this situation. &quot;So, um... What&#39;s going to happen now and how long should we keep this up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, ...&quot; Mike began. &quot; we still have the Chronivac, anything we like about our new situation we can keep and anything we dislike we can undo, right? The purpose of this is to enhance our awareness of our roles while experiencing new ones, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-right!&quot; Jeff replied. &quot;But people are going to start being seen me as more mature, right? How exactly will everyone respond to me now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody&#39;s going to find anything out of place... However, our roles and lives might change more as things progress... just go with it and see where you end up. Then go from there.&quot;</p>
