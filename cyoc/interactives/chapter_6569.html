<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A minute passed.  Nothing had happened.  I was trying to be as patient as I could be.  But patience was a virtue that I never possessed.  I looked at my reflection and felt utterly humiliated.  There was no one else to see me standing naked, but the whole world might as well have seen it, I thought.  I had hit absolute rock bottom.  I didn’t think my feelings could sink much lower than they were.<br />
<br />
Just as I was about to let my tear ducts empty, I felt something prick the palm of my hand.  I lifted up my arms to see that I clenched my fists together a little too tightly.  I must have been digging my nails into my hands a little too hard.  Not wanting to injure myself even slightly, I relaxed my fist and let my fingers separate.  <br />
<br />
As I separated my fingers I was greeted with the shock of my life.  The reason I had pinched my palms was not because I had clenched my fists tighter, but because my fingernails were longer!  Even now as I looked at them, they were growing right in front of me!  Could it actually be happening, I wondered.  Is my dream finally becoming a reality?<br />
<br />
My nails continued to lengthen.  They grew over the edge of my finger by half an inch or so.  The pale tan color began to fade as a bright pink filled the nails throughout their length.  As I watched the changes in my fingernails, I saw the changes spread to the other parts of my hands.  The fingers themselves become slender and smoother.  My hands decreased in size.  They were actually becoming smaller as I looked at them!  <br />
<br />
The faint brown hairs on my hand receded into my flesh as my hands grew smaller.  My attention was drawn to my arms as the hair there disappeared as well.  I looked over my body and saw hair disappearing everywhere.  My legs and chest, in addition to my arms were becoming smooth as the day I was born.  I felt my backside and, where there had been a few hairs here and there, there was nothing left save skin.  After a minute the only hair that remained on my body was on my head and between my legs.<br />
<br />
But even the hair between my legs was not immune to the change.  I never maintained my pubic hair at all, so it was a messy triangle of untrimmed hairs.  Now the hairs were disappearing there, too.  They were not disappearing everywhere, however.  As I looked into the mirror in order to get a better view, I thought I saw hair remaining in one neat line above my penis.  I determined that I was being left with one, thin, fine line of pubic hair.  Just like Kristy, I remembered.<br />
<br />
I ran my now feminine hands over the newly smooth skin, feeling the neat manicure of hair that was being left by my change.  In the process my hand brushed against my penis.  It hurt.  Usually, I could merely touch it and not feel anything either way.  Now it seemed as though it had become extremely sensitive.  It also appeared to be smaller.  I was amazed.  For whatever reason, I thought that would be the last thing to change.  <br />
<br />
I felt around my scrotum and noticed something very obvious.  It was empty.  My testicles had already shrank into oblivion.  As I continued to touch my empty ball sack, it split apart.  I could see two distinct, loose flaps of skin pulling back towards my body.  They took position on either side of my penis, which was now noticeably smaller, and drew inwards.  I quickly guessed that my scrotum was about to form the opening to my new vagina.  <br />
<br />
My eyes were fixated on the changes happening to my genitals.  I felt so many odd sensations; it was too hard to describe.  My guess proved to be correct, as my scrotum completed its transformation to my new vaginal lips.  My new vagina was swallowing my penis, if it could still even be called a penis.  Feeling it transform into a clitoris produced another indescribable feeling.  I felt the urge to touch it.  Slowly I reached my hands down and brushed them against my shrinking member.  Instead of feeling pain this time, I felt a surge of pleasure.  It hit me so hard that my knees buckled.  It was extremely sensitive.  My hands continued to touch it ever so slightly, producing an intense reaction to even the slightest of touches.  <br />
<br />
My penis continued to lose both its size and its form.  While it was still outside my body, it started to look more and more like a clit.  I began to rub it madly, giving into the sensations it produced.  I soon found myself helping it retract, as I pushed it closer to my pussy lips.  <br />
<br />
Just then I felt something brush against my shoulder.  I quickly turned my head and was greeted with a wad of hair smacking me in the face.  My tightly cropped mane of brown hair was now spewing down from my head.  I thought I could actually tell it was becoming thicker and fuller.  As each individual strand ran over my shoulders and eventually my chest, it looked exactly like the hair of models from shampoo commercials.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I felt my fingers slip inside my opening.  I looked back down at my crotch and could no longer see what was left of my penis.  I laughed and noticed that my voice cracked and sounded higher.  While my clitoris found its place inside my body, I let my fingers further explore my womanhood.  I felt like I was going to fall over from feeling too much pleasure.<br />
<br />
I kept my hand inside my pussy and looked at my feet.  My toenails were now also painted a bright pink, matching my fingernails.  My feet were also shrinking before my eyes.  Somehow I was able to maintain my balance.  I didn't know how I was able to do that, as my feet became shorter and narrower.  They now looked very petite, almost cute.  If you could describe feet as cute.<br />
<br />
The changes continued up to my legs.  I felt them become thinner, yet thicker at the same time.  My arms began to feel the same way.  Soon I realized why I felt in such a way.  Slight muscles were adding to both my arms and legs.  I now realized that this was my vision of the woman I wanted to be.  Just like Kristy, just like Torrie Wilson, I wanted to be well toned and well built.  Not overly built, but also not frail and waifish.  Indeed, my arms and legs both lost size overall.  But the outlines of muscles were now evident where previously there had been none.  I was very happy with this change.  It seemed that I would be much more fit as a woman than I ever had been as a man.<br />
<br />
A jolt of pain rocked my body.  It came from my shoulders.  Not being able to really see them anymore, thanks to the long hair I now sported, which had stopped growing just above my stomach, I couldn't quite tell what was happening.  The pain I felt told me that they were narrowing as well.  I didn't have very broad shoulders to begin with, but evidently some change was still necessary.  I threw my hair back over my shoulders in order to better see the changes.  Slowly but surely I could tell that my shoulders were creeping closer to my neck.  <br />
<br />
As the pain subsided in my shoulders, I felt a new touch of pain in my chest.  My rib cage contracted, as I suddenly found myself short of breath.  My chest and stomach both ached as they flattened themselves.  I had a bit of a pot belly.  Now that excess flab was disappearing as my stomach muscles tightened.  I didn't know if I developed what they call &quot;washboard abs,&quot; but they certainly felt much stronger than they had a few minutes ago.<br />
<br />
My 34 inch waist started to feel pressure now.  I already guessed what was going to happen.  The same pinching pain I felt in my shoulders was now affecting my waist.  Only this time the pain was worse.  Somehow I was able to bear it.  Then I realized my fingers were still inside my pussy.  I rubbed them inside once more, and the feeling of pleasure they produced were able to counteract the pain coming from my contracting waist.  <br />
<br />
While my waist continued to narrow, I began to feel my hips expanding.  This sensation felt much better.  I didn't know why, but seeing my hips get wider made me feel good.  It must have been because I knew that I was going to possess the classic hour-glass figure.  That thought made me squeal with glee.  Once again I noticed that my voice sounded higher.  Not knowing what to make of it, I said, &quot;Hello?&quot; and found almost no trace of my masculine voice.  My voice was now much higher, though it was hard to tell how high because it still cracked.  But my voice was definitely feminine now.<br />
<br />
My waist finished its change.  I wasn't sure of how big it was, nor did I care at the moment.  The expanding feeling that had taken over my hips was now felt in my ass.  I wanted to feel this change in my hands, so I removed my hand from my pussy.  Keeping the mirror in front of my, I turned my self to one side in order to see the change in the mirror.  I placed both hands on my ass cheeks and felt the smooth skin become bigger in my hands.  My ass did not become huge, but rather shapely.  I ran my hands over it and felt a round shape where before it had been flat.  I removed my hands from my ass and looked at it in the mirror.  It was certainly on par with any Playboy model's ass.  &quot;Eat your heart out, J-Lo,&quot; I said.  My voice now contained no hint of masculinity.  It was completely feminine.  I loved the way it sounded.<br />
<br />
While I was still running my hands over my ass, I felt a twinge in my jaw.  I guessed that my face was changing.  Not wanting to miss this, I got as close to the mirror as I could.  Again, I brushed my hair out of the way in order to fully see what was happening.  I was amazed by what I saw.  The sharp lines of my chin and jaw were disappearing.  My cheeks were becoming round, just like my ass.  I could see slight touches of red develop in them.  My nose also narrowed becoming petite and less pointed.  I touched my throat and could feel no trace of an Adam's apple, though I guessed that changed when my voice changed.  I looked at my eyes.  They were still blue, but now the blue appeared to become brighter.  I saw the lashes extend out from my eyelids.  My lips started to grow larger, filling out to feminine proportions.  I could barely recognize the face that was staring at me any longer.  Suddenly I felt a sharp twinge in both cheeks.  It was somewhat painful and forced me to close my eyes.  I felt again for a few seconds.  It actually felt like my face had become clay and someone was molding it to their liking.  About 10 seconds later, the feelings stopped.  I opened my eyes and looked back into the mirror.  I gasped at what I saw.  My face was gorgeous.  I couldn't believe how beautiful I was.  &quot;Hello, beautiful,&quot; I whispered.  I ran my hands over my face.  The skin was baby smooth.  It was without blemish.  It seemed perfect.<br />
<br />
Quickly I shook my head.  I realized that I was starting to sound vain.  I hoped this wasn't changing my thoughts.  I really hoped that this was all just reaction to what was happening.  I reassured myself that it must be.  After all I wished to be &quot;the woman I want to be.&quot;  I didn't want to be some selfish, stuck-up bitch.  That I knew for sure.<br />
<br />
I was now almost completely feminine.  But for one big difference.  I felt my nipples grow hard again.  I looked down at them and saw they were at full attention.  But they were also growing wider.  The areolas underneath them were also becoming larger.  I ran my hands up and down my chest, waiting for my breasts to grow.  Then I felt it.  As I ran my hands back up my chest, I felt a slight jiggle.  As in they moved up and bounced back down.  I removed my hands from my chest in order to admire the change that was about to happen.  I watched as my nipples started to push outward.  The flesh underneath them expanded, growing into breasts.  In a few short seconds I was about to experience 4 or 5 years of development.  <br />
<br />
The tugging feeling that my growing breasts produced made me feel intense waves of pleasure once again.  I wanted this moment to feel as good as it possibly could.  So I put one hand over my growing tits, teasing them as they grew, while I put the other hand back into my pussy.  My tits reached A cup size just as my hand found my pussy again.  I squeezed my nipples with the other hand and soon my tits were B cups.  When my hand found my clit again a loud moan escaped my lips.  I knew exactly what I wanted to do.  Soon my tits became too big for my hand to envelope.  They had reached C cups and were still going.  I started pumping my hand in and out of my pussy.  My tits reached D size.  I pumped faster.  I finally had to close my eyes as my moaning grew to intense levels.  I could feel it coming.  As I felt my tits stop growing, and my knees buckled, I exploded into my first orgasm.  Not my first female orgasm, but my first orgasm ever.  I quickly collapsed on the bed.  <br />
<br />
After a minute of regaining my breath, I reopened my eyes.  I looked at the two immense mammaries on my chest.  They were definitely D cups.  I knew they were bigger than Kristy's were.  I withdrew my hand from my pussy and felt fluids drip on my body.  <br />
<br />
My transformation was complete.  I stood back up and admired my exquisite figure in the mirror.  &quot;What should I call myself?&quot; my higher pitched voice asked.  &quot;Josephine is too obvious.&quot;  Just then I had an idea.  I'd postpone that decision until later.  Right now, I had to go somewhere.</p>
