<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power – Prince’s Prophecy – by scriptboy – idea by scriptboy and drakkenfyre<br />
<br />
It was very early on a September morning, and all in the house were sound asleep. Ty was in his room, as so was Dustin. Peter was in his own bedroom, but he wasn’t asleep. He had woken up when he heard a voice call out his name. He turned around and was startled when he saw a tall, dark figure standing next to his bed, looking down at him!<br />
<br />
“Wake up, my boy. I need to talk to you about a very urgent matter…” the voice said calmly. Peter got up in his bed and flipped the light switch on. There stood the man he called Prince, wearing a white robe, a white headband, white long slacks and white boots.<br />
<br />
“Good morning, Master! I’m happy to see you again.” Peter said to him, with a smile on his face. <br />
<br />
“Good morning, my loyal apprentice. How has your training been going? I gather you must have become stronger in the use of your mighty transformation powers” Prince responded.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Master!” the boy answered politely.<br />
<br />
“And how is your Cousin Tyler doing, my young wizard?” Prince asked.<br />
<br />
“He has improved a lot, Master. He is doing quite well!” Peter answered him. “Shall I wake him up so that you may see him yourself?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, my young wizard. Please ask your Cousin to join us in here.”<br />
<br />
Peter got up, quietly opening his door. Then he went into Ty’s bedroom, and gently woke him up by sending him a message using his telepathic abilities. When he was awake, Peter signaled him to come into his bedroom and to sit on the edge of his bed, next to him.<br />
<br />
“Greetings, Tyler. How are you?” Prince asked Ty.<br />
<br />
“I’m fine, Sir!” Ty answered, wondering why he was here at this hour.<br />
<br />
“First of all, I bring you good news and bad news” Prince began to tell the boys. “Peter, your parents send you their regards. They are thinking about coming here soon, so they can meet your cousin Tyler in person. I told them that you were doing well, and that I could sense that you have grown and become even stronger than you were before.”<br />
<br />
“The bad news is that many of the other white transformation wizards have been lost. They have allowed corruption, greed, pride, and a hunger for power turn them away from doing the good works they had initially started, and they have fallen away. They have become dark wizards, and they are spreading chaos and calamity all over the world. One of my best students has turned into a dark wizard, and he is only interested in gaining more power for himself, by killing or converting the remaining white wizards. With my best student gone, that now leads me to you, Peter.” Prince explained, in a serious tone of voice.<br />
<br />
“Me, Master?” Peter wondered out loud, as he pointed his finger at himself.<br />
<br />
“Why are you calling him Master?” Ty asked Peter.<br />
<br />
Prince slowly turned to Ty. “Cousin Tyler, why do you think your Cousin Peter is so strong in his powers?” he asked him. Ty just shrugged, not knowing what to say.<br />
<br />
“I’m the one who secretly taught him everything he knows, way back when he first got his powers. He was still living in Canada when I trained him for a few weeks. I needed a young, powerful Transformation Wizard to take the place of the older wizards who have died, been killed, or have been converted to dark wizards. It is because of Peter’s generosity and humility that he is now my most powerful weapon, and our enemy’s greatest threat!” Prince explained, leaving both boys in shock.<br />
<br />
“So, what do you want us to do, Master?” Peter asked Prince.<br />
<br />
“Dark times are coming. Several Dark Wizards will come looking for you and they will try to rob you of your powers, in order to use them to serve their own purpose. And they only care about power and greed! If they can’t have your powers, they will try to kill you. So I’m here to warn you that you will find yourself in battle very soon. It may take another year or so, but you must be ready for it!” he said in a very serious tone of voice.<br />
<br />
“In the meantime, I have an assignment for you” Prince continued on.<br />
<br />
Prince turned towards Peter. “Peter, you are my youngest and strongest wizard. You are at level five, and you need to reach level seven within a year. That means you should be capable of transforming yourself, anyone or anything into any other form. You must learn those difficult transformations, like liquid, transparency, clouds, invisibility, and the like. And you must master them quickly, for there is little time.”<br />
<br />
Then Prince turned towards Ty. “Tyler, you are a level four wizard and you need to be at least at level five or six within a year! That means that you will need to be as powerful as Peter is right now. Peter is your master, only because he has received the most training. You must become just like him, and just as powerful! That’s one of the main reasons why he’s here, to train you and to make you stronger.”<br />
<br />
Prince took a few steps back. “Arise, my young wizards!” Peter and Ty stood up and looked him straight in the eye. “Peter, allow you and your Cousin to stand before me wearing the proper attire of a great Transformation Wizard” Prince ordered. <br />
<br />
“Yes, Master” Peter said. He concentrated, and both Ty and Peter were suddenly wearing a white robe with white belts around their torsos, white headbands over their foreheads, white pants and boots. They looked like the Japanese Ninja warriors, but dressed completely in white.<br />
<br />
“Get on your knee” Prince said, as he grabbed a handle out of his pocket. Peter got down on his right knee before Prince. <br />
<br />
The handle in Prince’s right hand suddenly grew a blade of a sword which had a blue glow around it. As Peter closed his eyes and bowed his head, Prince tapped the flat side of the sword on Peter’s left shoulder. “I will now knight you and you will be known as a Transformation Master. Your task is to train others with similar powers, and to seek out and educate others who have the power as well. You may be interested to know that there are others like you and Ty who have the power, even though most of them won’t even know it. They will seek you out. As a matter of fact, you will meet another wizard who lives in this city very soon! But he does not know how to use his powers, and you must teach him. For we are in a battle, there are those who want to rob us of our powers and they will kill us if they do not succeed!”<br />
<br />
Prince gently raised up his sword, and stepped back.<br />
<br />
“Get up, Transformation Master!” he ordered. Peter slowly stood up. Then Prince placed his hands on his shoulders as he looked him in the eyes. Then he embraced him, and he whispered “Congratulations, Peter, you’re a Master now!”<br />
<br />
“Now, Tyler, get on your knee before me”. Prince said to Ty. Ty got on his right knee and bowed his head. Prince stood before him and bent forward, gently resting the palms of his hands on Ty’s shoulders. <br />
<br />
“Tyler, from now on you will be called a Transformation Wizard. Your task is to master the transformation arts and to prepare yourself for battle with the Dark Wizards, who want to kill you. Look after your cousin Peter, for he is now responsible for your growth. Guard your heart, your mind, your strength and your power from the Dark Wizards, and protect and defend other White Transformation Wizards.”<br />
<br />
Then Prince stepped back, and allowed Ty to stand besides Peter. <br />
<br />
“I can’t tell you how proud I am of the two of you” Prince concluded, “I want to make sure you understand your purpose and realize what your responsibilities are and why you have your powers. You are not to use them for personal gain alone, but mainly to help those around you. You are not to harm or kill anyone using your talents. You are to look after one another and support each other. Both of you may be called upon to fight very soon, and you will need to be perfectly united in mind and thought in order to survive!”<br />
<br />
Peter got a very worried look on his face when he heard that.<br />
<br />
“Master, will Ty need to fight, too?” he asked Prince.<br />
<br />
“Yes, if you can’t fight your battle alone, then Ty will need to assist you when the time comes. You are responsible for Ty and for other wizards as well. I will need you to lead them into battle!” Prince said to him.<br />
<br />
“Oh no… No… Please, Master! Don’t make Tyler fight!” Peter said, as he began to plead with Prince. He became very emotional, and tears came from his eyes. “He’s my only cousin with powers! He’s all I got! I don’t want anything bad to happen to him, please don’t make Ty fight!” he cried, as he began to break down in tears.<br />
<br />
Ty looked over as he was shocked when Peter began to cry. He had no idea Peter cared about him that much, and it touched him deeply that Peter was so deeply concerned about his safety.<br />
<br />
“Peter, I know that the responsibility I have placed on you may seem overwhelming. But I would not have done it if you weren’t capable of handling it, and right now, you’re the best I’ve got! Do you understand? I need you, Peter!” Prince said calmly, as he stood next to Peter and rested his arm on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Master. I understand. I’ll do whatever you say” Peter whispered, as he wiped the tears from his eyes using his fingers.<br />
<br />
Then Prince walked towards Peter’s bedroom window. He turned around and faced the two teens once more. “Be alert and be strong. I will be with you.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly lightning struck, and the light in Peter’s room went out, leaving Peter and Ty standing in the dark.<br />
<br />
“I love you guys” Prince said quietly.<br />
<br />
Then the light came back on, and Prince had disappeared. Where he stood, there was now a small, thin book with a white cover. Peter walked over to the window and picked it up, and started to flip though the pages. “This has all the transformation skills listed in it!” he said, as he smiled while he began to read.<br />
<br />
“Alright, well I guess I’d better get back to sleep, right ‘Master’?” Ty said to Peter, who just looked at him and chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Good night, ‘Master’!” Ty said teasingly, as he turned to the door.<br />
<br />
“Quit calling me that!” Peter said out loud, “Prince is the only one here who is worthy to be called that!” he said.<br />
<br />
Peter sat back down at the edge of his bed as Ty closed his bedroom door. He looked through the book for a minute. Then he set the book down on his bed. He stood up and walked towards the window, looking out over the starry, dark sky. For a moment, he felt as if he must have had a dream. But then he turned around and noticed the little book on his bed, which reminded him that everything that happened was real. <br />
<br />
Peter walked back to the bed and sat at the edge. He felt tired, but also excited at the same time. Was he really knighted by Prince? Why did he call him a Transformation Wizard? He felt guilty, in a way, like he had received a gift that he didn’t feel like he deserved. He couldn’t believe that Prince told him that he was his strongest wizard. Somehow he felt like others have made him out to be stronger than he really was. Or was he simply scared? Was he afraid, that perhaps he really was the strongest? <br />
<br />
Then Peter realized that Price would not make that kind of mistake. He needed to boost his confidence, he needed to test himself. Was he really as powerful as Prince had said? He grabbed the book and looked through it. He read three pages from the book, and then got up and stood in front of the large mirror. <br />
<br />
His robe disappeared, and suddenly Peter was only wearing his shorts. He looked at himself in the mirror and smiled. His pectorals expanded an inch, his biceps increased in size. His abdominals become more defined, and his quads suddenly showed some veins running over them. He chucked, as he looked at himself. He resembled a body builder, although he didn’t want to look too big. Suddenly, he grew an inch taller, and he noticed that everything around him seemed smaller and shorted. He loved having his powers, and there was nothing he enjoyed more than to grow his own muscles!<br />
<br />
Peter decided to try one of the tricks in the book that Prince left behind. He made himself transparent, just like a ghost! He chuckled as he looked at himself in the mirror. Then he decided to test his new form by walking straight through the bedroom wall and into Ty’s room. He smiled, as he saw Tyler on his bed, sound asleep. <br />
<br />
He walked up to the bed and stood next to it, looking down at Ty’s face. Then he took a step further, his transparent figure walking right through the bed! He found himself standing directly over Ty, with his own body going straight through Ty’s torso!<br />
<br />
Suddenly Ty awakened with a jolt! “AAAAHH!” he yelled, as he shot up straight, sitting up on his bed. He flipped the light switch and noticed that it was Peter, but he looked like a ghost!<br />
<br />
“Shhhh!!” Peter said, holding his finger in front of his lips, signaling Ty to be quiet. <br />
<br />
“Good grief, dude! You scared the tar out of me!” Ty said, with a relief. <br />
<br />
Then he noticed that Peter was still standing in the middle of the bed, with his legs going right through the mattress. “Holy cow, what happened to you? You look like ghost!” Ty said, as he began to realize that Peter was experimenting with his powers.<br />
<br />
“I know! Isn’t this cool?” Peter said, as he walked to the middle of the bedroom. <br />
<br />
Ty got out of bed and stood up, in front of Peter. Then he took two steps forward and turned around, finding himself standing at the exact same spot as Peter! “This is weird! I’m standing at the same spot as you are!” he said, looking down at himself and realizing that he was covering most of Peter’s transparent body, except the top of his head. Since Peter was slightly taller than Ty, a part of his head and his hair was sticking out above Ty’s head.<br />
<br />
He then crawled back on his bed, looking at his cousin, who now looked like a ghost. “You got teach me how to do that, okay?” Ty asked him.<br />
<br />
“No problem, I’ll show you in the morning! Good night, Ty!” Peter said, as he turned around and walked towards the wall. <br />
<br />
Then he walked through Ty’s other bedroom wall, and he found himself looking down at Dustin. He felt happy; he made himself transparent for the first time, putting something into practice which he saw in the little white book. Then he walked through the walls again and found himself back in his own room. <br />
<br />
“Wow, Peter, you can do anything!” he said, as he looked at his transparent body in the mirror. His body became solid again, and he reached out his finger and touched the mirror just to see if he could feel it. <br />
<br />
He then looked out the window and gazed at the stars. “Thank you, Master” he whispered, as he turned towards his bed, climbed on it, and fell asleep.</p>
