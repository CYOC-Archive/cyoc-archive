<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My eyes shot back open suddenly. Staring up at the ceiling, I saw slats of sunlight reflected through the window blinds. I could hear the muffled, but still aggravating, sound of my alarm clock going off in the next room. I was still lying on the couch, clothes crumpled around me, a white stain now all dried and crusty on the pants I&#39;d been wearing yesterday. <i>Did that all really happen?</i>, I thought to myself.<br />
<br />
But as I looked down at my own half-undressed body, everything looked completely normal to me. There was my bare chest, skin completely free of all that fuzz - and not much regular body hair either, which was something I&#39;d always been a little insecure about. Below that, my ordinary human dick, which was now totally flaccid without a hint of morning wood. I checked my hands. Normal, if a little stickier than usual.<br />
<br />
I felt gross all over, a coating of dried sweat sticking to every inch of my skin like I&#39;d just been out for an intense jog on a warm summer day. And yet I seemed to remember something about being unable to sweat. Maybe I was just experiencing a bunch of vivid hallucinations all of a sudden. Maybe I needed to get that checked out. But the distant, incessant buzzing of the alarm clock over in my bedroom reminded me that I had no time to worry about that now. It was a Monday morning. I had to get ready for work!<br />
<br />
I ran over to turn that alarm off and then hopped into the shower, figuring that I would deal with the mess I had made on the couch later. It wasn&#39;t like I was planning on bringing any girls home straight after work anyway. I let the water wash away any remaining traces of what I had done last night. And not just the sweat and the cum: there was an unusual, and particularly pungent, smell clinging to me when I woke up, which assaulted my senses even more as I stepped under the stream. My nose twitched uneasily as that unfamiliar musk was replaced - or maybe just covered up - with a sweet-smelling body wash.<br />
<br />
As I got out of the shower and prepared to put my business-casual clothes on, I took one last look at my naked body, just to confirm there was nothing weird growing on it right now. Nope, it looked pretty normal to me, although I didn&#39;t have much time to look myself over. I must have taken too long in the shower, because one glance at the clock told me I was officially running late now. I got dressed as quickly as I could and forgot all about breakfast as I ran out to the driveway and started my car.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t help but stare at the hood in front of me as I turned the key in the ignition. Still not a dent or scratch on it, despite that bizarre false memory of mine that kept replaying in my head. There was one unusual thing I noticed about my vehicle, though, as I prepared to pull out onto the street. The position of the driver&#39;s seat, which I always had set just how I liked it, now seemed totally off. My feet couldn&#39;t even reach the pedals from here. I shifted the seat a few clicks forward until it seemed just right, and then put that mystery in the back of my mind, behind all of the other ones.<br />
<br />
I slipped into the office a few minutes late, hoping nobody would notice except the time clock. But I knew that was too much to ask the moment I spotted Dirk in the hallway in front of me. He was the last person I wanted to see right now - or ever. And there was no way I was going to just sneak around him without letting him notice me. Before I could even think to look for an alternative path to my cubicle, he looked up and grinned at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; Dirk said in a teasing sing-song that grated at my ears and made me flinch. I wasn&#39;t sure if it was just something in the way he cocked his eyebrows above a menacing, toothy smile, but he seemed a lot more intimidating than usual. And he was enough of a bully on a good day. His bright, cold blue eyes were staring right through me. &quot;Look who decided to show up. You must&#39;ve been out late partying all weekend, huh, Josh? You look awfully frazzled this morning... not to mention twenty minutes late.&quot;<br />
<br />
It dawned on me slowly that I was staring <i>up</i> at him as he taunted me. I was positive we were normally about the same height, but in that moment, he had to have at least six inches on me. So unless he was somehow getting taller... I must have shrunk. I guess there was one change I&#39;d experienced last night that wasn&#39;t just a dream or a hallucination.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#39;t about to explain any of this to Dirk, though. Or anyone else I knew, for that matter, even if it made a pretty solid excuse for why I was late to work today. I just had to hope he wouldn&#39;t notice anything was different. &quot;Oh, h-hi, Dic- Dirk,&quot; I stammered out. Now was not a good time to let him know how I really felt about him, either, although I was sure he knew that anyway. &quot;No, I just had some c-car trouble this morning.&quot; Technically true. Nervously, I decided to push the envelope a little further. &quot;I guess you must have been a l-l-little delayed, too, huh? Since you&#39;re not at your desk yet and all...&quot;<br />
<br />
I was hoping that would throw him off, but Dirk seemed more amused than anything. &quot;I was just getting up to replenish my coffee,&quot; he said. &quot;But I guess we&#39;re not really supposed to do that after the clock starts, so you got me there. I won&#39;t tell the boss... as long as you don&#39;t, shorty.&quot; Then he laughed sharply to himself as he walked off toward the breakroom.<br />
<br />
I hurried over to my cubicle, hoping that would be the end of that. When I sat down at the desk, I was immediately confronted with another issue - my computer monitor was no longer at eye level, and I had to tilt my head up to see it from an awkward angle. Well, that proved it - Dirk was definitely not the one who had suddenly <i>grown</i> a couple inches in the past few days. I reached down and pumped the lever under my chair a few times until everything looked totally normal. Then I lost myself in a haze of spreadsheets and TPS reports, eager to have something else to think about.<br />
<br />
After that, it was mostly a normal workday. Mostly. I did eat my brown-bag lunch at my desk, rather than taking it to the breakroom like I usually would. I just couldn&#39;t risk running into Dirk again - or anyone else who might suddenly be several inches taller than me, for that matter. And when I pulled the bag open, the ham sandwich I had packed immediately smelled off to me. The meat must have gone bad - it hit me with this strong, disgusting odor like it was rotten.<br />
<br />
I tossed the slice of ham in the wastebasket at my feet and nibbled at the plain bread that was left, wondering if maybe my fridge had lost power or something. No, that couldn&#39;t be it. Everything else I&#39;d brought along in my lunch tasted fine. Especially the little baby carrots - those had to be the sweetest I&#39;d ever tasted.<br />
<br />
When the clock finally struck 5 that afternoon, I was in no rush to get out of my cubicle. I waited a little while, making sure that the office had basically cleared out so I could slip out of the building without talking to anyone. And then, when I went out into the parking lot and got back into my car, I was dismayed to find that the driver&#39;s seat was still set too far back for me. Somehow, I must have shrunken even more in just the eight hours while I was at work. I pushed the seat as far forward as it would go, and it was still awkward and uncomfortable to reach the pedals from there.<br />
<br />
As I drove westward toward home, I watched the sun sinking lower and lower in the sky. As I squirmed in my seat, pretty sure I could feel some of that fuzz growing in again under my clothes, I couldn&#39;t help but pick up on the pattern. Whatever was happening to me, it was getting stronger the closer it came to midnight.<br />
<br />
I pulled up at a red light, and casually glanced over at a department store on the other side of the street as I waited. In the windows were a whole bunch of colorful pastel banners and stickers, one of them prominently saying &quot;Remember - Easter is this Sunday, April 20&quot;. Just below that was a cartoon poster of a little bunny holding a large, polka-dotted egg in its paws. I stared at the design of the rabbit, and its crudely-drawn white, fluffy fur. And something finally clicked in my brain. <i>No. For fuck&#39;s sake, no. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m turning into the goddamn Easte-</i><br />
<br />
I was startled out of that thought when a car horn honked loudly behind me. I turned my head away from the window display and realized the light had turned green. I stepped on the gas, stretching my leg out as far as it would go to do it, and kept on driving.<br />
<br />
By the time I finally pulled into my driveway, I&#39;d made up my mind about what to do next. I wasn&#39;t going to just give in to these changes and let them take over my body without a fight, like I had last night. Not that I had the slightest idea what a &quot;fight&quot; would be in this situation. What I was planning was the next best thing: just ignore it. Refuse to acknowledge it. Okay, that didn&#39;t sound like much of a plan, either. But I was still pretty sure this was all in my head, so maybe I really could just shut my eyes really tight and wish for it to go away.<br />
<br />
So I was going to fix myself a quick dinner and then send myself straight to bed, like a misbehaving child who had just been grounded. I figured that forcing myself into unconsciousness would be a lot easier than pretending I couldn&#39;t see what I was seeing, feel what I was feeling. But the first part of that plan fell apart immediately, when I realized that I didn&#39;t feel the least bit hungry. Even though the only things I&#39;d eaten all day were two bare slices of bread and a little baggie of mixed vegetables, my stomach was full. I wasn&#39;t tired, either - a warm energy coursed through my veins. I felt fueled up and ready to run a marathon if I had to.<br />
<br />
But I wasn&#39;t about to listen to what my body was telling me. As I came into my living room and spotted the congealed mess I&#39;d never cleaned up, now stuck to the surface of my couch, I reminded myself just how badly it had gone the last time I let primal urges lead the way. I stopped there just long enough to grab a paper towel, run it under the sink, and wipe the stains off the faux leather. There. Let that be the end of this, I thought, as I tossed the clothes I remembered shrinking out of in the basket with the rest of the dirty laundry.<br />
<br />
And then, even though it was barely past 6 in the evening, I went into the bedroom and started to pull open the covers just as soon as I was out of my work clothes. As I laid down, rolled over, and switched the bedside light off, I could see out the window that the sun had not even finished sinking below the horizon yet. Perfect, I thought. I had to do this now - my changes, whether real or imaginary, were only going to get worse after sunset. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to block out the brilliant orange light streaming into the room between the window blinds, and tried to clear all thoughts from my mind.</p>
