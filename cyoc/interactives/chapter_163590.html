<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Though Jeff was still vaguely aware of the world around him, his thoughts were sluggish and single-mindedly focused on the overwhelming lust that he’d been worked into.  All he could think about was how badly he needed to get off.  However, struggle as he might, he could only seem to twitch his newly reduced body against bed sheet beneath him.  It only teased him, driving him mad.  He desperately craved to be touched.  Caught up in his arousal, he paid no mind to the voice that began to speak above him.<br />
<br />
“Woah, what happened?  Did it not work?” the ‘new’ Jeff asked as his senses came to him.<br />
<br />
He looked around in confusion, head swimming a bit as he tried to piece together what had just occurred.  He remembered entering the transformation into the Chronivac and hitting save, then he suddenly found himself completely naked, standing on the other side of the room.  With a huge erection, he added mentally, as it twitched against the bed.<br />
<br />
The new Jeff turned back to the computer to try to see what went wrong.  This only served to frustrate Jeff the cock, as his sole source of contact and stimulation was lost to him.  He began to twitch more and more, trying his best to provide any kind of relief to the desire consuming him.<br />
<br />
On the screen, new Jeff saw the old configuration that he’d entered accompanied by a small pop-up window with a timer that was counting down.  It currently read “00:000:00:55:48:731”, and he saw no immediate options to interrupt or interact with it.  He picked up the emitter and looked to see if there was anything wrong with it.  When he pointed it at himself, it came to life again, displaying “SCANNING” on its small screen.<br />
<br />
Back on the computer, the old window collapsed into a tab in the bottom tray with the countdown, and a new set of options appeared.  Once again, it defaulted to his rough description with many more options available to open and configure.  He tried to look through the windows to see what had gone wrong, but it became harder and harder to focus as his erection kept distracting him.<br />
<br />
Frustrated in more ways than one, he decided to go ahead and take care of it.  For some reason, he was really worked up by this whole thing, and though he wanted to wait and see how he could use the Chronivac to get off, his erection wouldn’t seem to go away on its own.  In fact, it only seemed to be getting harder, and he inexplicably couldn’t seem to stop twitching his member.  Giving in, he grabbed some lotion and tissues.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After struggling without release for what felt like lifetimes, Jeff suddenly felt a cool liquid touch his skin.  Before he had a chance to process what was going on, he felt something warm and somewhat soft wrap around him.  It squeezed him lightly and began to move up and down his form, rubbing the oily substance in.  If he thought he lust from before was intense, it paled in comparison to the pleasure that this simple action began to elicit throughout him.  He’d never felt anything like this before.  He would have moaned if he could, but all he was able to respond was to throb and pulse against whatever miracle worker was bringing him this sensation.<br />
<br />
He felt the grip around him begin to tighten as the caress accelerated.  Each part of his form brought forth its own unique thrills as he was squeezed and massaged, though the most intense was easily his towards his head.  With each stroke, he thought the pleasure couldn’t increase any more, and with each additional stroke, he was proven wrong.   Soon, he felt something begin to build deep inside him.  His whole form began to tense and tremble in anticipation.  The sensation became stronger with each pass of the squeeze around him.  The feeling concentrated into a pressure, which built and built to a point that was unbearable.  He felt as though he were about to explode or puke or scream or do all of them all at once.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, something gave.  In an all-encompassing burst of pleasure, Jeff felt his whole form lurch again and again as a thick liquid from deep within him erupted forth from his mouth.  All thought was completely obliterated by the ecstasy that washed over him.  As his convulsions eased, his mind was completely enveloped in a fuzzy warmth that mirrored the pleasant feelings coursing through his body.  He felt something wiping the liquid off of himself as he began to shrink, but wasn’t able to pay it any mind.  Slowly as he softened, he was lulled into a sort of happy sleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After cleaning up, the new Jeff just sat and basked in the post-orgasm glow for a minute or two, unsure why that particular one was so satisfying.  In fact, it may have been the best he’d ever had.  His thoughts went back to the strange instance from his first test of the Chronivac, but he figured that he may be able to understand what, if anything, happened if he just played around with it more.  With his head cleared, he sits back down at his desk.</p>
