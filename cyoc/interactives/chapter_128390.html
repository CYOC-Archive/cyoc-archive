<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You enter the stables, your mind becoming muddled through the various enchantments once more. It&#39;ll be hard to try and call out to Dizzy from here with your thought-speak, so you decide to walk toward his area of the structure in hopes of finding him. As you plod along on all fours at a leisurely pace, you think you can make out some kind of sound emerging from one of the far stalls. It sounds like a soft chugging noise mixed with small rumbles and an occasional sharp hiccup. It&#39;s very strange, but you advance towards it.<br />
<br />
As you round the corner from where the noise is being created, you are stopped in your tracks by the sight laid before you. In probably the most cutely, pathetic thing you&#39;ve ever seen is your blue boy, Diz. He&#39;s laid himself flat on his side with his hind legs tucked into his abdomen, his fore-limbs spread out in front of him as though he were prostrate before of some unseen deity and his head laying by his limp wings, which are unfurled and draped across his scaly, azure frame. Tears streak across Dizzy&#39;s muzzle which appears to be wrapped around something... Plush? Is that a pillow? Something soft at any rate. He either doesn&#39;t notice you or decides not to look in your direction as you sidle up to him.<br />
<br />
{{Hey}} You say kind of awkwardly, {{How&#39;s it going...?}} you wait for an answer, but it doesn&#39;t come, so you press on {{It has been a hell of a time these last couple of months, since you found me stuck in the mouth of a cave, since you nursed me back to health... since you gave me my name}} you see his ears twitch a little, the little spikes and flaps of membrane giving away the nostalgia he is feeling. At least he hears you. {{Look, I may not know everything that is happening in this world right now or what has happened in this world to make it the way it is, but what I do know is that you gave me a world to live in. You found me, helped me survive, shaped who I am and gave me an identity to live by. Who cares what some old drakes said did and didn&#39;t happen in the past, it doesn&#39;t change who you are and who you&#39;ve made me into.}} You pause for a moment when you see your scaly compatriot stir a little. He raises his head to meet your eyes, his are a little swollen with a red tinge to the sclera.<br />
<br />
{{You don&#39;t get it...}} He laments, {{Everything we were taught, all of the traditions that were drilled into our heads, all the bodies that our civilization was built on, all the events that we&#39;ve come to believe are what define us... It was all lies!}} Dizzy starts to tremble a little bit, fresh tears staining his draconic visage. {{How can I go back home? How can I look my elders in the eye and listen to what they have to say? Will I ever be able to believe or trust any of them again? They&#39;re my family! How can I not?!}} The chugging, rumbling, snorting sound resumes as Diz continues to lose himself to his sorrow. {{Everything that has shaped me, nurtured me to become who I am, was a work of fiction... If all that wasn&#39;t real then, what does that make me?}} He keeps his eyes on you, his fangs showing a little as he pours his heart on to the stable floor.<br />
<br />
{{Hey.... Hey, you don&#39;t live your life by the past.}} you begin to comfort your smaller counter-part. You lower your muzzle to his and let your tongue roll out, licking the tears off of his face, {{Who you are is reflected by what you&#39;ve done... You were the one who found an injured dragon and decided to nurse him back to health, you are the one who continued to fly into the territory of a dangerous elder dragon despite what could have happened, you are the one who rescued that dragon once again on the sheer ascent out of the ravine.}} You press your muzzle close to his, giving him a tender kiss... well, as tender a kiss as two scale-bound creatures could have. {{I was confused, unsure of who or what I was. You took me and made me everything I am. If that doesn&#39;t make you something, then I don&#39;t know what would.}} You pull out of your kiss and give Diz a warm look.<br />
<br />
{{I-I&#39;m sorry...}} He bows his head in shame, embarrassment etched across his features, {{I know what I&#39;ve meant to you but... How can you be so... alright with all of this? Did that bump on your noggin really send you through such a loop that you can say only I had anything to do with who you are? Could you really say &#39;let&#39;s do this, damn the consequences of ignoring all of the elder&#39;s teachings and blindly put our faith into this madman who kidnapped us&#39;?}} Diz looks at you as if searching your soul for some answer, some secret meaning to your words. Eventually, he just sighs, looking very tired all of a sudden. <br />
<br />
You look down at his dejected form wanting to comfort him, he&#39;s very much a part of you now and vice-versa. You crave what you had with him but a few nights prior, you want to see Diz back to his usual self. You can&#39;t let him do this to himself! You move his head aside with your muzzle, getting under him. He resists a little, but with the right leverage you manage to get your head under his right fore-limb and flip Dizzy-tail onto his back. Before he can manage to scramble onto his belly again, you drop your full weight onto his front, embracing him for all you&#39;re worth. As you lie on top of Diz with your head curled under his chin and your chest against his, tails beginning to entwine, you speak up again, {{You&#39;re my everything, without you I&#39;d be nothing. I don&#39;t want you to throw away everything you believe just to be with me. Hell, if you want to escape and go home right now, just know that I&#39;ll follow you to the ends of the earth and through Hecate&#39;s gate to see you happy again. Just... where ever you go, I want to be there with you. Please...}} <br />
<br />
You tenderly lick and nip at the scales of his neck, slowly but surely moving your ministrations downward. A rumbling starts to flow from your cerulean lover. It&#39;s deep and throaty and is followed by a flash of heat as his scales warm with the increased blood-flow from his increasing heart-rate. You go even lower, your forked tongue flicking out, tasting his flesh and giving him sweet licks across his naval. Soon the pungent musk of his emerging dragonhood hits your nose. You can&#39;t help but pause what you&#39;re doing just to inhale his scent, it&#39;s making your mouth water and your heart race.<br />
<br />
You continue to work your way down and slowly maneuver around the blunt tip of his shaft as it begins to poke you under your chin. You make your way even lower, stopping only to put your muzzle right into his crotch for another big whiff. It certainly has an intoxicating quality, that scent, it smells so delicious... You wick out your tongue, taking little licks around the lips of his vent, really giving him the cleaning he deserves. This act gets a little growl to pour out of your animated friend, his instincts getting the better of him as he thrusts into the air attempting to achieve more friction and a quicker release. You&#39;ll have none of that.<br />
<br />
You quickly pin his hips down with your fore-paws, steadying him as he whimpers a little in protest, {{P-please, it feels so good, don&#39;t stop...}} He whines, wiggling a little, but stopping when he realizes you aren&#39;t gonna move back until he stops. Once he has stilled himself the best he can, you move forward to resume your licking.<br />
<br />
{{Good boy, I want to show you how much you mean to me. Look how sincerely I want you to know that we are a product of each other and not of the world that we live in}} you let your long tongue go further down across his taint and snake across his tail-hole. He shivers at the familiar sensation of having your dexterous tongue tease him at his back gate. You flick your forked organ across his opening and press in just enough to wring a little cry out of your dragon. You see his aching spire spit and dribble pre-cum on to his stomach, the slightly flared head bobbing with his heart beat. Your tongue continues on its advance into Dizzy&#39;s tight embrace until it comes across a conspicuous little bump next to his quivering wall. His prostate makes for a delicious target as you curl and undulate your tongue right into Dizzy&#39;s soft-spot. Your kyanite dragon moans and lets loose a few spurts of clear fluid from his hen-breaker. He seems pretty worked up now, so you move on to the main course. Letting your oral organ retreat from Dizzy-tail&#39;s back portal, you move your head to just above his shaft and open your maw.<br />
<br />
Only to press his mast forward with your fore-claw until it smacks his belly with a wet *splat!* Diz&#39;s pre-cum splattering to all sides. {{Waste not....}} You begin to say as your tongues re-emerges to lap up his juices, {{Mm, so tangy and delectable...}} You savor his taste as his carnal battering ram throbs below your scaly, paw-like fore-limb. Soon enough, your lover has been thoroughly cleaned of any excess juices, but is clearly, terribly, in the throws of ecstasy. His iron-hard rod, thickly-veined, pulsing with the ferocity of a caged animal. Your own love stick had made its presence known some time ago, but you&#39;ve neglected it thus far to keep your stubborn, little drake on the edge of his seat, so to speak.<br />
<br />
Deciding he has had enough teasing, you release his cock from your adamant grip. Letting it spring toward your face, giving you a little love-slap on your snout. The warm musk leaving a lasting impression in your nostrils and clouding your vision with a haze of lust. You slam your maw down over his rigid pillar, taking it almost to the hilt in one go. You just barely get past his ring of prepuce when you start to gag on his immense cock, being a little too ambitious on your first try. You make a gurgle and slurping sound as you quickly retreat off of Dizzy&#39;s slab of meat only to catch your breath for a second before going down on him again.<br />
<br />
{{Oh, Hecate save me, your mouth is too good... I&#39;m not sure how long I can hold back!}} Diz is panting hard and struggling to keep himself in check, but you press on. Your tongue has wrapped itself around his shaft in a vice-grip, milking it for all it&#39;s worth, the back of your throat opening wide enough to accommodate his flaring shaft with ease. Soon you&#39;re sucking his shaft down as far as it will go, your throat feels stretched and sore, but you can&#39;t stop, you want his delicious seed in you. {{I-I&#39;m about to... I-!}} Dizzy-tail fails to complete his thought as he is rocked by wave after wave of orgasmic bliss. You press your muzzle right into his crotch, squeezing your eyes and practically snarling as you continue to milk his shaft with your throat, his throbbing cock sending a deluge of whelp-batter into your stomach.<br />
<br />
Feeling full but not satisfied, you pull off of diz and let the dragon flop to his side in contentment, while you turn to finish yourself off. You lower your head down to your crotch and it doesn&#39;t take any time at all to coax your own sizable load on to your tongue. Leaving it there, you move over to the dragon you owe your entire existence to and plant a sloppy, creamy kiss right into his mouth. Dizzy&#39;s eyes open wide in surprise, but your flavor mixed with his has him quickly melt into your impromptu cum swap. You continue to savor the moment of your afterglow together, but eventually you have to turn to your drake-friend and get some answers.<br />
<br />
{{So... have you decided what you want to do?}} You ask, hoping against hope that he wants you with him. He holds your gaze for a long while, many scenarios clearly running through his head. He is slow to project his thoughts into yours.<br />
<br />
{{I... I want to make this work... I don&#39;t think I could just go back home until I&#39;ve fully come to terms with what I heard. Things seem upside down right now and I feel like I&#39;m falling out of the sky with broken wings and you are the only thing I have to hold on to... and-}} You lock your jaws around his in another passionate kiss, stopping his tears from falling to the ground.<br />
<br />
{{I&#39;ll be there for you...}} You tell your emotionally drained dragon-mate, {{When everything looks ready to fall apart, I&#39;ll be there for you, just as you have for me. We&#39;ll get through this... together.}} Letting the poor drake out of your embrace, you both get up on unsteady limbs. {{So, what shall we tell that old lizard out there?}} you ask Diz with a toothy smile. He returns your gesture, flaps his wings as if shaking out any remaining doubt as to what he wants to do and says....</p>
