<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ten years went by. A now 26 year old Jeff had become a software engineer and programmer. He studied this field for the sole purpose of fixing the Chronivac program and hoping to bring Rose back. Both he and Kevin had stayed in touch and they also visited Rose at the zoo any chance they got. Rose had mated with the make chimp at the zoo and had a baby female chimp about a year into her captivity. The female chimp was now full grown. Eight years into captivity the male chimp had died, leaving just Rose and her daughter.<br />
One day Kevin got a call. It was Jeff.<br />
“Kevin! Get over here fast, I think I have done it! I’ve fixed the machine!”<br />
Kevin excitedly rushed over. “Are you sure?”<br />
“Well, there is only one way to find out!”<br />
They made their way to the zoo, which was now closed as they broke in through a back gate as the zoo was not a very security conscious place. They made their way to the primate exhibit where they spotted Rose, who was sitting grooming her daughter.<br />
“Ok, here goes nothing.”<br />
“Jeff got Roses stats back up as it just showed a chimp on the screen as he hit the restore option the machine came to life. Rose immediately sense something was wrong as she hissed and chattered. Then suddenly she jumped and screamed a loud chimp scream and collapsed on the ground as she seemed to be growing in size and shape. The chimp went into the fetal position as her daughter looked on concerned. Rose was evolving through time.<br />
The centuries flew by as she continued to evolve as hair started disappearing and receding. They could tell she was evolving into a Neanderthal as bones cracked and re-arranged themselves. Rose continued to grunt and scream in pain. However they guys could not see her front or face as her back was to them. Memories started to reform in Rose’s mind as basic language skills started to emerge. “Hurt! Me Hurt….ing!” What happen….neng…to.. mje?” she cried out in a low and rough voice.<br />
Time kept moving forward as she began to lose muscle mass as her body lengthened and thinned, but something seemed off to Jeff.<br />
“It’s working Jeff! It’s working!”<br />
“Yea, but something is not right.”<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
“Well I thought this would restore Rose either back to her 16 hyear old teenage self or at least she would perhaps be our age now, 26, but look at her hair.”<br />
Kevin looked and he could see gray streaks of hair mixed in with her dark hair.<br />
“What’s happening to her?”<br />
“Oh god, I just figured it out.” Jeff said as he whipped out his phone and got on the internet and did some searching.<br />
“That must be it.”<br />
“What?”<br />
“Well while Rose was a chimp, she did not age the same as you and I. A chimp’s lifespan is considerably shorter than ours and so they age at a faster rate than us. So ten years for us has been 30 or so years to Rose’s physiology. “<br />
“So she is going to evolve back into a 46 year old woman?”<br />
“Afraid so, and with only the memories of a teenage girl.”<br />
“She won’t remember her time here?”<br />
“Only vague impressions.”<br />
By this time was finally fully evolved. As she struggled to stand up she slowly turned to see the guys staring in awe at her as she was now fully human but also completely nude. Her breasts were large and sagging a bit from age as her whole body was not as taught as it once was as a teenager,  her hair was an even mix of gray and black as she looked like a mature middle-aged woman. Her face has aged well but had laugh lines and crow’s feet around her eyes and her legs were long and sexy, but considerably worn from time as well. Rose was very much an attractive mature middle-aged woman now.<br />
“Thanks guys, that was…whoa! What happened to you two?” she said as she did not see two horny teenage boys, but two young men in their twenties.<br />
“Did you guys age yourselves while I was crawling around? Oh, and my voice, I need some water, I am starting to sound like my mother. And what am I doing here at the zoo?””<br />
Jeff walked over to her and wrapped a blacked around her body And led her out of the primate pen. “Well Rose, it is like this….” Jeff told her the whole story about her hitting the computer and de-evolvnig more into a chimp and such.<br />
“So it’s really been 10 years since this happened? Wow! You mean I’m 26 years old now? That’s way cool! I’m a grown up! I guess that’s why my voice sounds different and I feel older!”<br />
“Well, there is something else you need to know. You see, while you were a chimp, you aged faster than us humans.”<br />
“Well how old am I?” she asked looking a bit scared.<br />
“I’d say you are between 46 and 48 years old.”<br />
Rose’s jaw dropped.<br />
“You need to get me to a mirror right now!”<br />
They led her to the woman’s bathroom and she got inside and saw herself in the mirror and then let the blanket drop to the floor. Rose began to cry. “Oh, look at me! I’m older than my own mother now! I was so hot, I am just a teen aged girl I’ve missed graduating, college, my young adult years and even my thirties. I should have a daughter who is 16 now y this time in my life and I have nothing to show for it! What am I going to do? I’m just an old woman now. Look at me!” she sobbed as Jeff tried to comfort her. “46 is not that old Rose, you’ll see.”<br />
Rose stopped sobbing and looked up at Jeff. “Do you, I mean, do you still think I’m pretty?”<br />
“No Rose, I think you are beautiful.”<br />
Rose had always had a crush on Jeff and so she wrapped her arms around Jeff and hugged him tightly/ “Promise me you will not leave me Jeff. I can stay with you, right?” Jeff looked down at the middle-aged woman and smiled. He had always had a thing for Rose too, but both of them as teens were too scared to act on it, but now he was really quite turned on by this older, sexy woman.<br />
“Well Rose,” said Kevin as he felt he needed to say something, “you actually do have an adult daughter.”<br />
“What are you talking about?” asked Rose.<br />
“Come here.” As they walked out of the bathroom, Rose holding Jeff;s hand tightly, as they walked back to the primate pen and Kevin pointed to the only Chimp left in the paddock.<br />
“That’s your daughter. You mated with a male chimp and had that child.”<br />
Rose’s jaw dropped again, but then a strange maternal instinct seemed to confirm that it was true.<br />
“Well what can we do about it?” asked Rose. That was when Jeff said……</p>
