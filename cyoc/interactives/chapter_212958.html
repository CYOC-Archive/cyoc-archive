<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Andy woke up in the morning, the tightness of his pajamas had vanished, and the remains of his pajamas laid in tatters around him. Andy sat up, amazed by the destruction around him, and gazed at the pole between his legs, a stiff morning wood claiming his attention. He wrapped one of his enlarged hands around the long shaft and began to stroke, moaning loudly in a voice that was much deeper than it was even the night before. Andy laid back down, using one hand to stroke his massive cock and the other to grab at his pecs, squeezing them into further arousal. Within moments, ropes of cum went flying as Andy roared. <br />
After calming down and cleaning up, Andy observed himself in the bathroom mirror. Gone was the small 14-year old boy, and instead he saw a massive 6’2” bodybuilder with what looked like shaved but still visible hair on his chest and jaw. His 6-pack abs replaced by a tight 8-pack, pecs so large that they had begun pushing against each other for space. His arms were the size of watermelons, and his thighs big enough to crush a skull between them with ease, and of course the large cock swinging pendulously between them. It was easy to assume that Jesse had continued to mock Andy while Andy slept in the next room, resulting in him looking like the 20-year old bodybuilder he saw in the mirror. Andy mimicked some of the bodybuilder poses he had seen in movies, feeling adrenaline rush through his veins from the excitement. <br />
Once he was done, Andy decided he wanted to go visit Madame Illusia one last time, just to ask about how long this new situation would last. Knowing he couldn’t go out to see her nude, Andy quietly sneaked into Jesse’s room, looking for anything that could fit his new, enlarged size. After a lot of searching, he eventually found a jockstrap that would be filled by his newly engorged junk, athletic shorts that were normally fairly loose on Jesse, but looked painted on for Andy and emphasized his package greatly, and a sleeveless T-shirt that he’d seen Jesse wear before too, that was semi-tight on him, but was almost like a second skin for Andy’s new size. He loved the way the shirt wrapped around his pecs, and he noticed you could actually see his abs through the shirt. He grabbed Jesse’s sandals and made his way out of the house unnoticed.<br />
Deciding he was too big for his bike, Andy decided to jog back to the fair. It still took some time, but he arrived much faster than he expected thanks to his new power and size. Before he walked in the tent, he noticed that the shirt he stole was now drenched in his own sweat, and it somehow seemed smaller on him as a result. Smirking, he entered the tent to see the tent full once again for another show. He sat at the back, not wanting to disturb the show until it finished. While he did, he watched a small petite woman turn into a older, rotund man, two brothers that were closer switch ages with each other, and a older, bear-like man turn into a 20-year old twink. He felt his dick twitch looking at the newly minted twink, feeling a desire to fill the tight virgin hole the young skinny man must’ve now had.<br />
Just before the end of the show, Madame Illusia said “Before we end our show, we have a return visitor I’d like you all to meet. Come up here, Andy!” Andy stood and the crowd looked at him in awe as he walked up to the stage with new confidence. Madame Illusia explained to the audience Andy’s transformations, which only caused the audience to become even more intruiged.<br />
“Now Andy, what being you back here this time?”<br />
“I actually had a few questions… like how long will I be like this? Am I still fourteen? And just how big-“ Almost as if on queue, Andy paused as the audience watched him grow taller, the soaked shirt pulling upwards and exposing his belly button, before his muscles pulsed larger still, causing rips in his shorts. The hair on his face filled out even further, becoming a thick beard. He took a deep breath in, and as his lungs expanded the shirt ripped apart at his chest, exposing his shaven pecs for everyone to see. <br />
“How big am I going to get?! I don’t have anything that fits me anymore.”<br />
Madame Illusia put her thumb to her chin in thought. “Well I can see how that can be an issue. Looks like I forgot a couple of my usual failsafes in my excitement for you. So, first off…” She snapped her fingers, and the crowd watched as the split in the shirt rejoined, and the shirt grew longer to adjust for his new height, though the shirt still remained as tight as it was when he entered the tent. The rips in the shorts also mended, and the shorts grew outwards so they weren’t as tight against his legs, though his bulge stayed pronounced. “There! Now all your clothes will always fit you perfectly! So will anything you buy or try on. For example…” She reached for one of the audience members who had traded his adulthood with a small 8-year old boy, and he handed his tiny Tony the Tank Engine shirt to Andy to put on. Andy took of his shirt and hesitantly started putting on the kids shirt, and the audience watched it grow to fit Andy, though the shirt changed slightly, becoming sleeveless and gaining a deep V- neck, exposing his pec cleavage. The shirt was tight around his chest, but fell loosely against his stomach. The logo for the kids show remained, though now looked quite ironic on the large bodybuilder standing on stage.<br />
“Wow, this is awesome!” He took off the shirt, and the shirt remained his size. “Uh, sorry kid, guess this is mine now.” The kid laughed, immaturely enjoying being shirtless in public. Andy shrugged and put the kids’ shirt back on, liking the way it fit.<br />
“As for the rest of your questions, I have this.” Madame Illusia held out a silver watch, and placed it on Andy’s wrist. “This watch is special. It has this dial on the side, see? Only you can turn the dial, and when it’s turned upwards…” To demonstrate, she turned the dial, and as she did so, Andy felt something change, but couldn’t quite figure it out. “…you’ll be living the life of your physical body. meaning right now, you’re a 22-year old man!”<br />
Andy looked at her confused, and almost out of instinct, reached to his back pocket and pulled out a wallet that wasn’t there a moment before. Inside was an ID for a 22-year old version of himself that went by Drew instead of Andy.<br />
“Hm, should we call you Drew then, sir?” She asked the big man on stage, He smirked and nodded. He liked it. “Yeah, I think I’ll go by Drew as an adult then.” <br />
Madame Illusia contributed her explanation. “You can turn the dial downwards, and you’ll be back to living as 14-year old Andy, and everyone will treat you as a very tall, muscular 14-year old. I must warn you though, when you’re Drew, you’re the big brother, meaning you’ll have to be nice to Jesse or you’ll lose your size. You’ll have to pleasure him too to keep your size too, so remember that.” Drew smiled. “I think I can manage being the big brother he never was.” Madame Illusia smiled at that. <br />
“One last thing. In about 6 months, a button will appear on the watch. When you press it, you can choose one thing to change back. You could change back dicks, or go back to being small, or lose your perfect clothing magic for whatever reason. But it’ll only be one thing, got it?”<br />
Drew nodded. “Thank you so much!” He hugged Madame Illusia before heading out of the tent as a new man - literally.</p>
