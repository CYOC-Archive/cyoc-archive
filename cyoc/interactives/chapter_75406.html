<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We seemed to run out of things to say to each other.  Brian went back to playing his video game.  I just sat <br />
on the couch and thought about things.  Maybe Brian was right and my wish made things a little too complex.  <br />
It was something to consider.  But I was not convinced.  How could he make such a determination after one <br />
experience anyway?  I felt that the matter needed more…investigation, so to speak.<br />
<br />
It took me a little while of just sitting with my thoughts, but I came up with an idea.  “Brian, how much are <br />
you making right now?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” he replied.<br />
<br />
“Ballpark it, will ya?” I requested.<br />
<br />
“I think it’s supposed to be about $35,000 a year,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Gross or net?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Gross,” he said.  <br />
<br />
“Hmm,” I said.  “That’s about the same for me.”<br />
<br />
“Well what do you expect?” said Brian.  “We’re just out of college, entry level.  We’re going to be on the low <br />
end.”<br />
<br />
“Naturally,” I said.  “I’ll bet there’s a way we could make a lot more.”<br />
<br />
“Phfft,” he scoffed.  “Sure there is.  Crystal meth lab?”<br />
<br />
“No,” I answered.  “Sex.”<br />
<br />
Brian paused his game and looked at me.  “Just how would we get paid for sex?” he asked with irritation clear <br />
in his voice.  I responded by smiling out of one side of my mouth.  Suddenly it dawned on Brian what I meant.  <br />
“Are you out of your mind?” he yelled.<br />
<br />
“Not at all,” I said.  “I think I’ve got a good plan.  Why don’t you listen to it before you fly off the <br />
handle?”<br />
<br />
He sighed in disgust.  “Fine, fine, let’s hear the dumbest, craziest, most ridiculous thing that’s ever <br />
entered your mind,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Here’s what I figure.  We both liked what we just did.  I want to feel that again, and I think you do, too,” <br />
I said.  He looked about to protest but I didn’t give him the chance.  “Deny it all you want, but you <br />
practically admitted it,” I said.  “So if we want to do that again, I say why not get paid for it?  Obviously <br />
there could be a lot of problems.  But that’s what this ring is for.  From what I’ve seen so far, I can’t <br />
think of a scenario where the ring can’t help us or protect us.  Go ahead, name a problem and I’ll have the <br />
solution,” I challenged him.<br />
<br />
“Easy,” Brian answered.  “Cops.”<br />
<br />
“I can wish for any cops to ignore us,” I said.<br />
<br />
Brian pondered for a moment.  “OK, I guess,” he said.  “How about diseases, pregnancy?  Other prostitutes?  <br />
Worse, how about pimps?”<br />
<br />
“Again, I can wish for other prostitutes and pimps to ignore us, just like cops,” I explained.  “I can wish <br />
that we can’t get pregnant.  I can wish that we can’t get diseases, either.”<br />
<br />
“Starting to sound a little too convenient,” he complained.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” I said.  “It’s not my fault that the ring can do what it can do.  Any other objections?”<br />
<br />
“Yea, how ‘bout our real jobs?” he asked.  “I’d still like to have a real job.”<br />
<br />
“Me too,” I said.  “I think there’s a couple of options we have.  We can wish it so that we’re on vacation or <br />
leave of absence or something.  We could probably make it so that we’d still get paid, too.  Or if you <br />
honestly still want to go to it either day, we can wish it so that we wouldn’t feel fatigued or tired at our <br />
real jobs no matter how much sleep we may or may not get.”<br />
<br />
“I think I like the latter idea better, to be honest,” he said.  “Sounds like less complications.”<br />
<br />
“Not worried about sensory overload or anything?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I suppose we’d find out,” he answered.  “When do you propose to start this little endeavor?”<br />
<br />
“Why not tonight?” I said.  “Do you have something else better to do?”<br />
<br />
“No,” answered Brian.  “But I’m still a little worried about being…dumb like that.  Are we sure that our alter <br />
egos can handle themselves properly and how we want them to?”<br />
<br />
“I have already wished that I won’t forget how to use the ring as a woman,” I said.  <br />
<br />
“But it’s not that,” said Brian.  “What if something completely unexpected, that you haven’t thought of, that <br />
requires quick thinking happens and you’re slow to react?”<br />
<br />
“I guess I’ll need to make another wish to cover that,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Such as?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“To wish that if an unexpected situation that required a quick, snap decision arose, I would know exactly what <br />
to do,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Who is going to make these wishes?” asked Brian.  “You or Barbie?”<br />
<br />
I thought for a second.  “I suppose Barbie will have to,” I said.  “Since if I do it, the ring might interpret <br />
it as you and me, not Barbie and Briana.”<br />
<br />
“Better write it all down for her,” he muttered.<br />
<br />
“Yea, good idea,” I said.  I got off the couch and went back into the kitchen.  We kept a small pad on the <br />
refrigerator.  I took it down and began to write down everything that we needed to be wished.<br />
<br />
“Make it legible,” said Brian as he walked into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
It took me a few minutes but I finally got down everything I needed.  At the top of the paper I wrote, “Barbie <br />
– make these wishes.  OR DON”T GO OUT!”  I showed it to Brian and asked, “Think she’ll get it?”<br />
<br />
“She’d better,” he answered.  “Notice how we’re referring to her in the third person.”<br />
<br />
“Yea,” I said.  “I think that’s what we’d better do.  We’ll share bodies and memories and know what the other <br />
has done, but otherwise we’ll be separate.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, here’s a wish you’d better make yourself,” said Brian.  “Make sure that no one in this building notices <br />
different people going in and out.”<br />
<br />
“You mean make sure that nobody notices Barbie and Briana?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Well…while we’re…they’re in the building at least,” he answered.<br />
<br />
“OK,” I said.  “I wish that no one in our apartment building will notice Barbie and Briana ever going in and <br />
out of our apartment.”<br />
<br />
Brian picked up the glass.  “Where’s the water?” he asked.<br />
<br />
I retrieved it from the refrigerator.  “Why do you want it?” I asked him back.<br />
<br />
“Barbie seems to think it’s what changes us,” he said.  “Might as well keep it that way.”<br />
<br />
“OK,” I said.  “I wish that whenever we drink water from this glass and this glass only, that we’ll turn into <br />
Barbie and Briana.  And I wish that when Barbie and Briana drink water from this glass and this glass only, <br />
they will turn back into us.”<br />
<br />
I poured the water into the glass.  As I did so Brian quickly stripped off his clothes.  “Don’t feel like <br />
having to repair the shirt again,” he said.  “And frankly I don’t care if you see my dick.”<br />
<br />
I decided to follow suit and removed my clothing as well.  “Back at ya, pal,” I joked.  “Mine’s bigger <br />
anyway.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, for Christ’s sake,” Brian said as he snatched the glass away from me.  “Let’s do this before I come to my <br />
senses.”  He quickly downed the glass and slid it back to me.  I filled and emptied it as quickly as I could.<br />
<br />
The changes began just as quickly as they had before, but they were different this time.  “Look, our hair is <br />
changing first,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Yea, our faces, too,” added Brian.  He was right as I felt my face alter back into a female shape.  The <br />
changes continued in almost exactly the reverse order as before.  Our genitals changed sexes, our legs and <br />
arms thinned, and our feet and hands grew smaller.  Our fingernails lengthened.  Our stomachs flattened, <br />
waists narrowed, hips grew wider and asses grew larger.  Our voices changed just as our breasts blossomed out <br />
again.<br />
<br />
The last change was the mental change again.  I felt my normal thoughts, feelings and likes going away.  Then <br />
everything grew hazy for a minute and finally…</p>
