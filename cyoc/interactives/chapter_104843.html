<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Train them all,&quot; Chris replied, as the Trainer chuckled. <br />
<br />
The offensive line of the college football team eagerly headed down to the basement gym, where the beastly trainer was waiting for them. He smirked evilly as the eight burly young men stood before him, each player excited about the prospect of training with such a muscle beast. Chris walked up behind them, and went up to the trainer, shaking the big man&#39;s hand. &quot;These guys are for you. Make them into what you want. They&#39;ll do it gladly,&quot; he told the trainer, as the other man&#39;s grin became wider. <br />
<br />
Chris turned back to the team. &quot;Okay guys, this trainer is the best there is! As you can see, he did an amazing job with me!&quot; Chris raised his monstrous arms and flexed them for emphasis, pleased by the team&#39;s reaction as they openly ogled his giant arms. &quot;Twenty-six inches, guys,&quot; Chris boasted, &quot;and I&#39;m not even pumped! That would get me up to twenty-eight!&quot; The team murmured with admiration. Chris stepped aside. &quot;Do what the trainer says. The results will be incredible!&quot; The team cheered in agreement, and Chris walked upstairs, leaving them to their fate. <br />
<br />
*   *   *<br />
A day later, Chris headed down to the basement, to check on their progress. As he recalled, a day in the world above was like eight years with trainer. He couldn&#39;t wait to see what had become of the team! <br />
<br />
What Chris saw surprised him greatly. He saw seven men working out, each a different size. Some were huge, some were just muscular, and one looked toned but surprisingly slender. Looking at his face, Christ recognized the offensive lineman, once the biggest member of the team, now the smallest! Chris walked around toward the back of the gym, and finally saw something more familiar: the eighth man, a huge, 500 pound beast of muscle. Walking up to him, Chris recognized him as the cocky quarterback. &quot;Damn, you seem to be the only one who really made the most of it, down here!&quot; Chris remarked. The quarterback turned to him, looking worried, almost frightened. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Chris asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s his year,&quot; came the Trainer&#39;s deep-voiced reply. Chris turned, then took a step back, eyes wide as he gazed upon the Trainer&#39;s massive body. The huge man was easily 800 pounds of solid muscle, packed onto an eight-foot tall body. He was packed into gym shorts and a tank top that could barely contain him, his muscles bulged so freakily under the tight garments. He flashed his shark grin at Chris and the quarterback, causing both smaller musclemen to shrink back in alarm. The trainer stepped forward, reaching out with his huge arms, picking the quarterback up off the floor, easily lifting up the other man&#39;s quarter-ton body. &quot;This is his year to feed me,&quot; the Trainer cooed, &quot;And it&#39;ll be the biggest feast yet.&quot; <br />
<br />
As the Trainer stared deep into his eyes, the quarterback&#39;s look of fear vanished, replaced with quiet obedience and desire. The Trainer set him down, and the player slowly stripped off his sweaty workout gear, dropping it in a pile on the floor. The Trainer smirked, then walked around his trainee, running his big hands over the player&#39;s bulging body. &quot;He&#39;s done well, hasn&#39;t he, Chris? He became everything that I wanted him to. And now it&#39;s time for him to serve out his purpose. You want that too, don&#39;t you, boy?&quot; The quarterback nodded, his erstwhile cockiness replaced by blissful obedience. <br />
<br />
Trainer chuckled evilly, then slowly pulled down the elastic of his gym shorts, revealing his huge cock and balls. His dick rose swiftly, rising to 14 freaky inches. He grabbed the quarterback again, lifted him high into the air, and slowly brought him down onto his dick. The football player cried out in pain and pleasure, as the rest of his team crowded around to watch the show--one that each of them had previously personally been part of. Trainer began to pump his dick in slowly, back and forth, each thrust making the quarterback&#39;s body shake, the smaller man&#39;s cries turning into moans of pleasure as his ass stretched to accommodate the huge rod that was invading it. <br />
<br />
As Trainer fucked his student, the quarterback&#39;s body began to shrink, the huge muscles looking a bit less firm, a bit less thick. The Trainer&#39;s body was undergoing the opposite process--the more he fucked, the bigger he got, his already huge muscles swelling and throbbing bigger and bigger, becoming even more bloated with size and power. Chris watched with growing horror and arousal as the Trainer turned into an even more massive beast, slamming his dick harder and deeper into the quarterback, draining the smaller man&#39;s muscle faster than ever. Panting heavily, his giant chest rising and falling dramatically, the Trainer went wild, plowing the football player&#39;s shrinking ass with fury. Suddenly the huge beast let out a roar as he came, his giant dick pumping a substantial load of cum into the quarterback&#39;s diminishing body. The once-cocky football player&#39;s body shrank down until it looked painfully thin, lacking even muscle tone. The Trainer pulled him off of his hard dick and dropped him to the floor. <br />
<br />
Slowly, the Trainer turned to face Chris, a huge, evil grin on his face. He raised his giant arms, flexing them arrogantly, the giant balls of muscle rising up in a freakish display of power. &quot;I never get quite as much as they lose. But that 400 pounds should have added 200 to my already massive body,&quot; he explained, sneering down at Chris. &quot;Your genie didn&#39;t create me, after all. They can alter reality, but it&#39;s always easier for them to borrow, rather than create something new. I&#39;ve been borrowed, to become your trainer. And when you generously offered these to me...&quot; he reached out with one huge arm, sweeping it to indicate the team, &quot;how could I say no?&quot; He let out a loud, booming laugh that filled the gym with noise, echoing all around. Chris had never been as scared and turned on in his life.</p>
