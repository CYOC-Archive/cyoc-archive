<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...A middle aged man, early 40&#39;s. Streaks of gray ran through his otherwise dark hair and a goatee you didn&#39;t care much for was distracting you from having a look at the rest of the body. <br />
<br />
But how was this possible? Was all that about having your brain in a new body true? <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to MY body?&quot; You asked. &quot;Well, that body died almost a month ago, in your accident. Prepping your brain for this surgery is not easy work, you know. Then we had to wait for a useable body to put you into. But I believe you were cremated. What was left of you anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... dead?&quot; You asked. &quot;In a way, yes. But as you can see in the mirror in-front of you... You&#39;re quite alive. And if I may say so myself - you could have done a lot worse than that. And even better, the body is fresh. So most likely there won&#39;t be any lasting damage.&quot; The voice said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Dr. Michaels by the way. I&#39;ll be guiding you through what happens now. And we got quite a bit to cover.&quot; He explained. &quot;We&#39;ll start by unstrapping you and getting you something to wear.&quot; He told you. &quot;I bet you&#39;re cold and this is all a bit much. But all will be explained&quot; He finished, with a smug look on his face.<br />
<br />
Soon enough you were dressed and back in bed. Dr. Michaels told you about what was going on. That this was a secret lab, run by powerful and rich people in well connected positions in the top of government. He also told you that you&#39;d be taking over the life of your new body. People couldn&#39;t know about what was going on. As long as you did what you were told - you&#39;d be paid good money through some made up insurance, so nobody would be able to trace it to anything... nefarious. If you tried to tell anyone, they&#39;d make sure that you&#39;d disappear and this time you wouldn&#39;t get to enjoy a second chance at life. <br />
<br />
He told you about your new life. You were now a man named Adam North. 42 years old. A wife, also 42 years old named Olivia, but no kids. 6&#39;1, 190 lbs. He had worked in finance. He was shocked by a stun gun when he erupted at the office after being fired. Apparently he got fired for the fact he had been quite abusive towards his colleagues and sexist against his female co-workers. Either way, the shock had made him fall weird and hit his head. He had been brain dead at the spot. When he got into the hospital, the people behind the brain transplant project acted quickly. Soon all news about his death had been swept under the rug and your brain put into his viable body. All this took them no more than 3 hours. <br />
<br />
The lab had decided to tell his wife about the whole ordeal thought. They figured paying her off/threatening her would make things easier in the long run. Faking amnesia and a quick divorce might have worked, but they were afraid it would look strange as well as you might slip up early in the process. So, why not simply have the wife be in on it? At least for a few months until people wouldn&#39;t think too much about this.  They weren&#39;t particularly afraid of getting caught from you divorcing the wife or you slipping up - but you didn&#39;t run top secret labs with &#39;maybe&#39; and &#39;what ifs&#39;. Threats and money was a safe bet as well as making sure no one would even look at the circumstances twice. <br />
<br />
So, you were to assume his life. Live with his wife, in his home, in his body for a few months and then you&#39;d get a divorce, settle out of court and go on your marry way. The only thing permanent would of course be his body. Your new body.  <br />
<br />
The very same day, Olivia came to pick you up and take you back to your new home. Olivia was blonde, 5&#39;3&quot; and had quite the hourglass figure. Her breasts wasn&#39;t large, but definitely not small either. But the more you peeked at them, the more you couldn&#39;t help think they were fake. Her ass was wide in all the right places. Not that any of that mattered. Her face was pretty square and her skin white as porcelain. The square face made her look quite elegant and she was by all measures pretty. <br />
<br />
As you got to Olivia and Adam&#39;s house, it looked perfectly normal. As you got inside, nothing stood out either. Expect the sofa that was turned into a make shift bed. Which someone had been sleeping in, so it was not made for you coming here. Maybe they had been in a fight? Considering that Adam apparently had a rage issue, that wasn&#39;t inconceivable. Olivia looked visibly bothered by you looking around. But so far all you had said to each other was more or less &#39;hey&#39;. This was incredibly awkward. Why wouldn&#39;t it be? Her husbands body, with someone else in it, was walking around in Olivia&#39;s home.<br />
<br />
The fact you had been looking at the couch clearly caught Oliva&#39;s attention. &quot;He got drunk and we had a fight, I slept down here to get away from him. Okay?&quot; She said, with apathy. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to stare&quot; you replied. Things felt even more awkward. But seemed you had been right on the money. &quot;Don&#39;t apologize, I&#39;m just a little bit shocked about the whole ordeal.&quot; She said, this time with a slightly warmer tone. &quot;Tell me about it&quot; you replied. You chuckled at your own &#39;joke&#39; if you could call it that. But it seemed to have lightened the mood because Olivia chuckled as well and said &quot;Well, I guess you got it worse than me. You&#39;re someone else. I can&#39;t imagine how surreal that is&quot;. <br />
<br />
It was surreal. But so far, you hadn&#39;t really thought too much about it. &quot;Haven&#39;t even started to think about it yet&quot; you answered. But you were probably about to. &quot;But I do need to use the bathroom, may I?&quot; You asked. &quot;Well, this is your home as well now, no one is stopping you. But please remember to flush. Adam always forgot.&quot; Olivia replied.</p>
