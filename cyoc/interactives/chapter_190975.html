<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>-Steven &quot;Steve&quot; Jaye, lvl. 8 female Lupin (werewolf) Ranger, bonded as Mariel&#39;s animal companion (milking bitch)<br/>
<br/>
> More non-con sex.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luma stretched her hand towards Steve, speaking the words of power. The female shuddered as she felt something pluck at her essence, drawing of the lycanthropy bound to her soul.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is well when employing werewolves to know how to direct their curse -- or blessing, as you will in time perceive it.&quot; Luma lifted her hand slightly, and a grey cloud rose from Steve, coalescing in the shape of a wolf&#39;s head trailing into vapour. With a gesture to Mariel, the phantasm coiled around and plunged into her chest, making the Elf scream, as much as in shock as for the pain of muscles suddenly drawn tight.<br />
<br />
Luma resumed casting, even as the wolf spirit worked its way in and bonded with Mariel&#39;s soul. While the werewolf transformation took precedence, this spell would insure that Elf no more would Mariel be, but Lupin like her mate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Had you come here in peace to give yourselves to my service,&quot; the wizardess resumed, watching Mariel writhe against the tentacles&#39; grip in vain effort to relieve her agony, &quot;I would have given you the Lupin transformation first; for it is always painful for a human to become a werewolf for the first time. It gives me little pleasure to see you tormented; but you chose to attack me, so now you suffer.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a feeling of fire, pale grey fur began to spread across Mariel&#39;s form. She screamed again as her muscles cramped tight, growing bulky and corded. Her legs snapped as the joints shifted to digitigrade; claws tore through her fingertips in little spurts of blood. Cracks echoed amid harsh panting as the woman&#39;s face pressed out into lupine snout, her pointed ears growing furry, moving to the top of her head amongst hair becoming wild mane. Tail forming as vertebrae cracked and multiplied.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are beautiful,&quot; Luma complimented as tears began to spill from Mariel&#39;s eyes, which smarted as they too changed, taking on a pale golden hue. &quot;But not yet in the way you were meant to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Luma strolled forward. Her tails curled around, to coil about the struggling, shifting woman. As with Steve the tentacles withdrew, beginning to dissipate now that they were no longer wanted. Despite Mariel&#39;s increasing strength, she had no more hope of wrestling free of the magic-infused appendages than she had the rubbery black tendrils.<br />
<br />
Last to go was the tentacle in her cunt. And immediately Luma&#39;s tail stabbed up in its place, Mariel shuddering as the exotic pleasure of the fluff on her sensitive flesh pierced the pain of her transformation. Luma&#39;s own breath caught and released in a laugh as she felt the now-lupine snatch clench around her appendage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy the feeling while you can, slave. It won&#39;t last much longer. You,&quot; Luma lifted her finger, playfully pressing it against Mariel&#39;s developing nosepad; &quot;are about to be refitted for your role as a breeder.&quot; <br />
<br />
The druid was too lost in lycanthropic pain and the horror of what Luma meant to even snap at her. Twisted by the conflicting feelings, knowing her hold on her identity was slipping, all she could do was pant, half protesting, half pleading.<br />
<br />
&quot;N... nuh... no...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, yessss...&quot; Luma&#39;s voice became breathier as she wrapped her arms around Mariel, their furry bodies making contact for the first time. She began to thrust, grinding her thick cock between the tightness of their bellies. Her own tail rubbed maddeningly against her ballsack as she forced it in and out of Mariel, going deeper with each thrust. Menawhile her other tails forced Mariel out of her spread-eagle pose, pinning her arms behind her and guiding her longer, digitigrade feet to stand on the ground, spread apart to give the Mistress access.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be,&quot; she whispered, her voice thick and husky with arousal. She ran her hands up the thickening fur of Mariel&#39;s back, pressing on the rear of the werewolf&#39;s skull to make her meet her gaze. Mariel had to wonder if the wizardess had cast another spell, as she could not look away from the lambent golden gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;A strong male proud to breed his Mistress&#39; bitches for her, giving her litter after litter of healthy werewolves to fill her milking pens and the ranks of her guards. Imagine them, boy... the she-wolves, on fire for you, tails lifted in invitation...&quot;<br />
<br />
The tip of Luma&#39;s tail nudged Mariel&#39;s cervix.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now.&quot;<br />
<br />
There, deep inside the female&#39;s core, she fired the spell held in her tail. The werewolf gasped as new heat flared in her cunt, igniting another orgasm. Her last female orgasm. That realization flickered for a moment, then her mind broke before the pleasure vibrating through her flesh. A low half-howl poured from her throat as she felt her insides glow and melt in Luma&#39;s magic, her muscles relaxing in the grip of the soft, steely tails.<br />
<br />
&quot;It begins.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luma slowed the pace of her humping for a moment. Dropping Mariel&#39;s head, hung in panting exhaustion as she feebly tried to recover her mental grip, the Kitsune brought her hands to the werewolf&#39;s furry breasts. Massaging them, while she felt Mariel&#39;s tunnel collapsing around her tail, squeezing tighter as the cervix dilated for an instant before disgorging two precious orbs, and sealing behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yess, slave...&quot; she hissed, thrumming her thumbs across diminsihing nipples, breast tissue shrinking back and spreading out into muscle beneath her hands. Mariel&#39;s whimpers deepened, growing rough as tendrils of masculinity began to work their way up from her core.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel it... The losss... You do not have breasts; you shall want them. You shall <i>need</i> that soft flesh pressed against your chest, spilling between your claws...&quot;<br />
<br />
The thrusts of Luma&#39;s tail grew shallower and shallower as the forming ballsack, ovaries now fully converted to testes, passed down the vagina. She could feel the werewolf&#39;s clit growing, expanding with the throb of her heartbeat, rubbing against her own, encouraging the vixen to grind harder. Drawing another deep, growling whimper from Mariel&#39;s throat. The werewolf&#39;s hands strained against her tails, seeking to feel the changes for themselves, but Luma would not let them.<br />
<br />
&quot;And to get those breasts...&quot;<br />
<br />
She ran her hands down Mariel&#39;s front, now flat and barreling, across more pairs of vestigial nipples hidden beneath the shaggy fur, then up again to smooth across broad pectorals.<br />
<br />
&quot;<I>Strength. Feel</i> it,&quot; she repeated, insistent, hypnotic. &quot;The strength to take what you need! <i>Feel... it...</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
The sensation of Luma&#39;s tail finally forced to withdraw as heavy balls dropped between the former female&#39;s thighs. Her clitoris suddenly surged with power, doubling in length to become a proper penis, pre-knot beginning to swell as it frotted against Luma&#39;s own canid bulge. Another whimper, but this was more of a growl as the rising masculinity began to pierce Mariel&#39;s brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; The word was ragged, alien to her ears. &quot;Argh... heavy...&quot; Everything was strange... the muscles, the faint teasing from the many little nipples, the size and hardness of her... her cock... So hard. Balls so heavy. She couldn&#39;t think. She was...?<br />
<br />
Male. He was male! His eyes came back into focus as Mariel finally succumbed to the intoxicating male lust. The werewolf struggled against the vixen&#39;s tails, trying to free his hands to grope himself and the teasing femme. But he could not. Luma held him fast, a grin of triumph baring her fangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeeessss. That&#39;s right. Balls heavy with seed, cock primed to sow it; to show those bitches your strength and give them your pups. But. There will always be one stronger than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her tail, fur matted with Mariel&#39;s female juice, slithered up between them, cradling sacs and penises. In this tight furry tunnel, Luma picked up the pace of her grinding. The werewolf whined and writhed, baring his own fangs. But he could not escape Luma&#39;s grip, and he could not hold her gaze. His ears drooped, Luma&#39;s chiuckle ringing in them as he averted his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy. Know your Mistress!&quot; Suddenly the werewolf felt her hands on his head again, and his muzzle was plunged into her cleavage. &quot;Breathe deep, slave! Know my scent, know my flesh! Want my breasts above all others -- want and never possess! Rather <i>be</i> possessed: my breasts, my cock, my seed; desire them, worhsip them, serve them. Ha!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a jerk she pulled his arms to the sides and his feet forward. His back hit the earth, tail pinched against the pavement, his yelp cut off as Luma came down heavily atop him. But, apart from the stab of his abused tail, he found his body hardly felt it; fur and thick muscle and heavy bone, they absorbed the fall with ease. <i>So powerful!</I> But still not enough to break free.<br />
<br />
Luma laughed and continued to frot, her pace increasing as release neared. And, despite the humiliation and rough treatment, the werewolf felt himself tense as his own moment drew nigh, balls clenching, knot puffing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah ah!&quot; A minor curse flared in Luma&#39;s tail, locking around the werewolf&#39;s maleness. &quot;<i>You</i> do not cum yet. Only once you have knotted your lover like the beasts you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Growls and whimpers were in vain. Despite balls drawing tight and veins throbbing, he could produce nothing more than precum. But Luma was under no such restraint. A minute more and she braced her hands on his mighty chest, pushing herself up a moment before screaming in vulpine ecstacy. Pearlescent fox seed shot up across the wolf&#39;s torso, coating it in her scent.<br />
<br />
Enflaming his lust still more even as it locked in his submission to the Kitsune.<br />
<br />
And off to the side, anoher also cried in release. An Orc guard, hands in his pants. He had come to make report, but finding his Mistress occupied respectfully waited. Watching her turn the female into a horny male, he could not help pleasuring himself, remembering when Mistress had done the same to him. Luma&#39;s ears swivelled to the sound; she had been aware of him, but she still did not deign to notice him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... ah...&quot; Slowly Luma&#39;s tails uncoiled, and she rose to a kneeling position. &quot;Here...&quot; Reaching down to the wolf&#39;s released cock, she ran two fingers along it, collecting the mixed juices, then rubbed them along the male&#39;s lips. &quot;Savour it, wolf. Your taste... your Mistress&#39;... Your treat for being such a good boy. Ha...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Mistress rose to her paws, taking her own time to savour another triumph. Watching the lupine&#39;s tongue tentatively dab at her offering, his eyes blinking up at her as he tried gather his wits, her scent filling his head.<br />
<br />
Luma stood aside, stretching. She was going to need another bath after this, she reflected with amusement. But the cum did little to tarnish her allure -- to judge by the eyes of her slaves on her. The male werewolf, cock still painfully erect, began to scramble to his feet, eager to try to get himself off on -- or in -- the vixen once more. Luma shook her head, and pointed to where Steven -- the she-wolf -- lay, femcum from uncounted orgasms mixing with the milk on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is your mate, boy.&quot; Then to Steven: &quot;On all fours, bitch! Present yourself to him!&quot; The she-wolf hastened to obey, pressing her front down as Luma had shown her, her damp tail lifting and waving, engorged vulva displayed and open for the male wolf.<br />
<br />
He started forward, then paused. <i>Steven...</i> The male shuddered as the sight of his degraded lover stirred fragments of Mariel&#39;s hatred and anger, stabbing painfully into his mind. But the lust... he needed... He found himself standing over Steven, tongue lolling in desire as he regarded the plump, upturned rear. The heady lust pounded from his balls and cock with his mighty heartbeat, the hundreds of pounds added to his frame born easily on his brawny legs. Lost amidst his own power, Mariel&#39;s voice struggled to be heard.<br />
<br />
<I>I need it! It&#39;s mine! But... I can&#39;t...!</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Why hesitate?&quot; goaded Luma. &quot;She humped you for years under the Stone Witch&#39;s curse. Now it&#39;s your turn! Show that bitch who should be on top! Take your prize, the first and the sweetest, as my new wolf stud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mariel,&quot; whispered Steve, looking over her shoulder, hopeless lust in her limpid eyes. &quot;I am just a bitch now, and I need you. Forget Mis- Luma. Just... let me feel --&quot;<br />
<br />
The female&#39;s words cut off with a gasp as the male seized her hips and plunged in. Mariel faded again; having accepted Steve&#39;s plea, she could just be the stud, and enjoy breeding the bitch. No, not just <i>a</i> bitch -- this was his mate. Luma was forgotten, in the moment, as wolf knotted wolf. Mariel voicelessly sang his love for Steve as his hot load seeded her womb, the curse released as the stud fulfilled his role.<br />
<br />
Then the pair collapsed, thoroughly spent, on the path. Wearily the male wolf licked at his mate, not resisting the pride felt as his shaft pulsed out the trailing end of his canine cream.<br />
<br />
Luma smiled down at them, gently stroking her own shaft as it retreated. She too felt pride. While they were not quite broken, yet, they had both given submission. And in that, they were her slaves -- and as her slaves, she was happy to see them happy. Still, she had to remind them again of their place before she moved on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, Steven and Mariel,&quot; she mused aloud. &quot;I already have a Stephanie... and besides. Those names don&#39;t really suit a couple of animals like you. So.&quot; She stroked a tail along Steve. &quot;You will be Soot, and you&quot; she caressed Mariel &quot;will be Ash.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two werewolves sighed. They did not even put up a mental struggle, too tired and besotted by Luma&#39;s enchantment. The new names sank in, entwining with the afterglow. And soon, their dreams; Luma murmured another spell to make sure they caused no trouble until they were chained in her kennel. Their post-coital drowsiness made them readily succumb to Sleep. <br />
<br />
She stroked over them with her tails a few moments longer, then turned to the guard. &quot;Report.&quot;<br />
<br />
He bowed. &quot;A pair of trespassers were apprehended. Both male humans. They would not give their names or identities, though one is likely a knight or paladin by his armour, and the other a rogue by his gear. They&#39;ve been stripped and taken to the dungeons; the grounds are being swept for any other parties.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luma nodded. &quot;I suspect they were on the same mission as these two. Good work. Nobody was injured?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of ours, Mistress. The knight is rather banged up; a few bones broken, maybe. The clerics should be looking after him now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Luma contemplated her options. <i>Rest now, or later?</i>  To the east, the Sun was poking above the horizon. Ordinarily she would sleep for another hour. But she was up, and now had more prisoners to deal with. And she did want that shower before she did anything else.<br />
<br />
<i>Later,</i> she decided. She needed to confirm her supposition that this second pair were also here to rescue Ty. And, if so, to prepare a fitting reunion for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take these two down to the milking kennels,&quot; she said, gesturing to the sleeping lycans. Their bodies were slowly losing their feral bulk as they reverted from werewolf to Lupin form, in the process freeing the male&#39;s knot from the female&#39;s grip. &quot;See that they&#39;re properly secured; they aren&#39;t ready for my collars yet. I&#39;ll see our other guests after I&#39;ve showered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress.&quot; The Orc bowed, then went to fetch some help to haul off the two wolfmen. Luma strode back to her suite, ideas for the punishment of the remaining intruders already forming in her mind. She smirked to herself.<br />
<br />
