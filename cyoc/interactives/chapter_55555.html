<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin and Ty continued their stroll down the busy high school hallway, content with their changes to the bodies of their classmates.<br />
<br />
“Dustin… Who’s the most timid guy in our class?” Ty asked his half-brother.<br />
<br />
“Umm… There are several… I’d say Eddie is one of the most timid guys I know!” Dustin replied.<br />
<br />
“Ahh yes… Little Eddie! I wish I knew where he was now…” Ty sighed.<br />
<br />
Instantly, a vision appeared in Ty’s mind, of Eddie sitting at a desk in an empty classroom. Eddie was a short, skinny kid with glasses and curly, blond hair. He was reading a book when Karl, another kid, walked in.<br />
<br />
“Lunch money… NOW!” Karl growled at him.<br />
<br />
Since Ty had seen in which classroom Eddie was, Ty and Dustin began to walk over there right away.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Eddie had gotten up and ran to the back of the classroom, while he was being cornered by the bigger Karl, who had demanded his lunch money.<br />
<br />
“Gimme your lunch money, you runt!” Karl sneered.<br />
<br />
“Come on, man! L-l-leave me alone!” Eddie pleaded with him, as he was pushed into the corner at the back of the classroom while Karl stood right in front of him, blocking his only way out. Karl was big, fat and husky, so little Eddie had no way to escape.<br />
<br />
Just at that moment, Ty walked up to the classroom door, and he was what was happening through the glass window in the door. <br />
<br />
“Darn it! Karl is harassing little Eddie!” Ty gasped. “I’d better get to work… fast!”<br />
<br />
“Uhhh… Ty… Eddie is VERY timid! What are you gonna do to him?” Dustin wondered.<br />
<br />
“I can’t stand it when big guys bully the little, weaker guys! Time for the little guys to stand up!” Ty announced, as he began to concentrate on Eddie’s muscles.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Eddie’s biceps and triceps started to inflate, just as Eddie began to dig into his pockets in order to pull out his change.<br />
<br />
“Hurry up already!” Karl sneered.<br />
<br />
“H-h-here!” Eddie stuttered, as he pulled some change out of his pocket. Unfortunately, the poor kid was so scared, that he dropped his nickels, pennies and dimes on the floor!<br />
<br />
Karl immediately noticed that Eddie seemed a little more muscular, but he decided not to say anything.<br />
<br />
“You klutz! You dropped everything on the floor! Pick it up!” he growled.<br />
<br />
As Eddie turned around and squatted down, revealing his legs and his calves (since he was wearing shorts), Karl noticed that Eddie’s calves began to inflate like balloons! What was going on? Karl rubbed his eyes in disbelief. Was Eddie hulking out before his very eyes?<br />
<br />
Eddie had finally picked up the last coin before he had risen to his full height before turning around to face Karl.<br />
<br />
Karl’s jaw dropped wide open was he noticed how Eddie not only looked far more muscular now than a minute ago, but also taller than before! In fact, Eddie seemed to be a good six inches taller than him! Eddie’s pecs were sticking out by almost a foot and his abs were incredibly defined, like rocks! <br />
<br />
“What’s going on here?” Karl asked him.<br />
<br />
“W-w-what do y-y-you m-m-mean?” Eddie stuttered.<br />
“Where did those muscles come from? How did you grow so big all of the sudden?” Karl wondered, just as Ty and Dustin entered the classroom.<br />
<br />
“Gosh, Eddie, why are you so afraid of Karl?” Ty grinned, as he leaned against the desk with his arms folded. “After all, you’re bigger and stronger than him!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Eddie! Don’t let Karl push you around like that!” Dustin added.<br />
<br />
This gave Eddie a little more confidence as he realized that he was indeed taller and stronger than his tormenter.<br />
<br />
“H-hey… You got my coins… Those are mine… Give them back!” Eddie suddenly ordered.<br />
<br />
“What? You gave them to me!” Karl growled.<br />
<br />
“Says who?” Ty sighed.<br />
<br />
Before Karl could say anything, Eddie reached out with his thick, muscular arm, and grabbed Karl’s right hand, which was holding Eddie’s coins. His grip was so strong, that he made Karl drop all the coins into Eddie’s left hand.<br />
<br />
“Like I said… Those are MINE!” Eddie smiled, as he put the coins back in his own pocket.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Give that back!” Karl shouted, as he gave Eddie a push against the shoulders. <br />
<br />
Eddie didn’t budge, however, but he reached out with his thick, muscular arms, and he retaliated with a mighty shove of his own, which sent Karl flying against another desk, before he fell with his back on the floor.<br />
<br />
Karl quickly got up and ran past Ty and Dustin before stumbling out the door, realizing that he was no match against Eddie!<br />
<br />
Ty and Dustin were about to leave the room, when Eddie shouted something to them.<br />
<br />
“WAIT! I… This isn’t me… I-I normally don’t act like this… I’m no bully… I-I’m sorry…” Eddie stuttered, practically breaking down in tears.<br />
<br />
Ty walked up to him and rested his arm on the broad shoulders of the big, muscular boy who had always been known to be incredibly shy and timid.<br />
<br />
“Eddie! We know that! You’re no bully! You weren’t bullying Karl! You were defending yourself and taking back that what was rightfully yours!” Ty explained. <br />
<br />
“Ty… I-I’m s-s-scared…. I don’t know what happened to me…” Eddie stuttered.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about?”<br />
<br />
“When Karl was teasing me a few minutes ago, I began to grow bigger! I don’t know what was happening to me! Now I’m all bigger and taller! I’m scared!” Eddie said to Ty, with a really concerned look on his face, as he looked down and examined his muscles.<br />
<br />
“From now on, Eddie, you will find it normal that you’re big and muscular, okay? Nobody will bully you anymore!” Ty said with a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“Ohh… Oh yeah… I work out in the gym every day…” Eddie said. <br />
<br />
Ty and Dustin walked out of the classroom, as they listened to this big, muscular boy, who couldn’t stop talking. It was funny how Ty was able to change this kid, who used to be terribly shy and timid, into one of the most vocal kids in school…</p>
