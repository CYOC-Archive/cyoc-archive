<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The female division of the IAC Bodybuilding Competition got plenty of people watching it. Of course, many of the people watching had an ill-concealed ulterior motive. For in order to be on as equal footing as the male division, the females were showing off their bodies were as little as possible. All they wore were thongs and pasties to cover their erogenous areas. And unlike most human female bodybuilders, the Animalians had very pronounced breasts. In fact, there were extremely few female Animalians who were small-chested, and that was mostly because they were still young and have only been exposed to the virus once.<br />
<br />
Still, the members of the (mostly male) audience were expected to restrain themselves. There was pretty much nothing that could be done to reign in the catcalls. However, if anyone got too raucous or foulmouthed, they would be immediately escorted out by the security team there. That didn&#39;t make everyone on their best behavior, but at least they weren&#39;t on their worst behavior.<br />
<br />
Though truthfully, it was rather challenging for any hot-blooded man to NOT get excited over this. This was a living wet dreams for furries. Beautiful animal women posing in nearly nothing at all? Who could resist? The participants had a lot to show off: their long, shapely legs, their muscularly petite arms, their hardened stomachs, the tight curves of their asses, and the almost-completely displayed grandeur of their breasts. Each one of them was a work of art.<br />
<br />
But the competition was more than merely showing off their Amazonian bodies. They had to prove that their muscles weren&#39;t just glamorous, they were functional. And it was done in more ways than just lifting weights, even though the weights would have crumpled most men. The metal bars and stone blocks were not as big as the ones in the male divisions, but it was still very impressive to see them bend and break them respectively. It was certainly more than what humans were capable of.<br />
<br />
But the greatest test of strength was reserved for the larger weight classes. It wasn&#39;t considered unfair because everyone considered this challenge daunting. This test was none other than the Atlas Test. To prove their strength, the contestants would have to hold a huge stone globe on their backs for a whole minute. Of course, there were safeguards to make sure no one was hurt. The globe was lowered onto their backs by a crane harness that remained attached. The harness was given slack as soon as the contestant had a purchase on it, allowing the full weight down on them. But if it looked like it was going to slip or the contestant would collapse, it would be lifted away at once.<br />
<br />
There were plenty of very contestants in the Super Heavyweight division, which was made up mainly of large animals like different kinds of bovines. But none of them were like Iphis and Ianthe. But then, there was really no one like Iphis and Ianthe. The two-headed anaconda was considered the ultimate specimen for multiple reasons. Not only were their internal systems perfectly built to accompany their two-headed nature, but their muscles were a lot larger than any other snake Animalian. Technically, they didn&#39;t quite belong in the female division since they were a hermaphrodite, but their physique was closer to the feminine design. They had been doing moderately well in the competition so far, but Ianthe&#39;s arm still hasn&#39;t caught up to Iphis&#39;s and it cost them points for symmetry. Still, the anaconda twins were proving they were a mighty force.<br />
<br />
But their final test was still the Atlas Test. The anaconda slithered out onto the stage, directly beneath where the globe would be lowered. They coiled up their tail to allow for maximum stability. The globe slowly lowered down it was touching their shoulders. Reach back around, they gripped the stone orb as tight as they could. Once they had secured their grip, the harness&#39;s tension was loosened. Almost immediately, they found themselves struggling to keep the globe up. Ianthe was particularly shaky. Despite putting as much effort as shi could, her arm still hasn&#39;t bulked up to same size as Iphis&#39;s. But even so, Iphis was finding shi was having trouble keeping the globe up as well.<br />
<br />
But despite their instability, they were able to hang onto the globe for quite a long time. It was very impressive when you considered the globe weighed 1000 pounds. But no one was expected to hold this great weight indefinitely. Only 1 minute was the maximum. Still, the globe started to get rather wobbly, especially after they got past the 50 second mark. Eventually, Ianthe&#39;s arm buckled and the globe started to roll off. The crane quickly pulled back up and the globe was lifted away. But even so, the crowd roared with delight. Iphis and Ianthe had held up the globe for 55 seconds, which was still an amazing feat. The two of them waved at the crowd, even though their shoulders felt rather stiff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry for dropping the ball,&quot; said Ianthe, &quot;I should have hanged on longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; said Iphis, &quot;In two years, we&#39;ll have evened out. Then we&#39;ll see if we can get the gold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good thing we were only shooting for silver,&quot; said Ianthe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve got a good chance for that,&quot; said Iphis.</p>
