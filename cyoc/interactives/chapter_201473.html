<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His body trapped between that of a bipedal and a quadruped, he refused to give in to what it demanded he do and drop down to all fours. Hips aching, a dull throb that went down his legs and up into his back, he lurched down the hall past doors. Their handles too high for him to reach, he looked to find one that was already open, hoping that on the other side would be something would help him. Unable to stop himself, he uttered a whimper to express the discomfort he was in, a noise that wasn’t even human, a sound that matched what he’d become, had almost turned completely into.<br />
<br />
Pace unsteady, he stumbled and when he dropped to the all fours, he moaned at the titbit of relief it brought. Struggling to make himself get back up onto two legs, he gasped out, “Nuh, oh. I, wuh, ohn’t guh ih ve ih n,” the words managed and not coming out properly, his mind having trouble focusing on them and his transformed mouth and throat had problems forming them.<br />
<br />
Slaver dripped from his mouth as a tongue that wasn’t human lolled out of his mouth and he started to pant. Against his body’s wishes, desires, he managed to stand back up. Forelegs, for they really couldn’t be considered arms any more, hung limp before him and he stared down the hall. Whining, “Juh uh st ah nuh ther step, juh st ah lih tuh l wuh ays muh or,” he tried to take a step, but was so uncoordinated, the pain he was in spiking worse, he couldn’t. Squatting down into a sitting position, what were now his back legs splayed out to either side, he was unable to stop himself as he opened his mouth and panted, finding it strange that it helped relieve him a smidge.<br />
<br />
The dark hallway before him seemed to stretch on forever, and as he gazed down it, he tried to focus on it, to figure out how what he saw was possible, but was disturbed that he wasn’t able to. Part of it was that his mind was now caught between what he’d used to be, a human, and what he almost was now, a dog. And yet, it was more than that. Sitting the way he was, he found himself forced to acknowledge how much he’d changed. His hands now paws, two dewclaws all that remained of his thumbs, he held them limply before him, refusing to place them on the floor. The things that were now more forelegs pressed into his chest, against the six teats that he now had, which he found to be sensitive and left him with an ache for the feel of a pup to nurse upon them. Grimacing at such sensations, he found it hard to ignore them, especially when he could feel his neo-genitals pressed against the carpet, an alien perception to them that he could only describe as an buzzing tingle that went up into his body, centred around an opening he’d used, but was still unused to, frightened by, and left him with a longing that grew stronger the more he tried to deny it.<br />
<br />
From somewhere behind him, he heard a soft tapping sound which he knew was caused by his whip-thin tail as it knocked against the floor. He wanted to stand on four legs and keep it held it up, to present himself.  Trying to resist the heat cycle his body was in, and what it wanted him to do, he continued to stare down the hall in an attempt to focus his mind on anything but the unfamiliarity of his new form. Unable to do that, he found himself looking instead at the part of his face that now extended outward.<br />
<br />
Unable to call it anything but what it was, a muzzle, he crossed his eyes and stared down it. Light brown fur covered it, the same colour fur that also covered his body, whilst at the end of it his nose was now a black, wet, and had whiskers. Twitching ears that were now atop his head, hearing almost as much as he could smell, he reached up with some difficulty and ran a toe of his front paw over the inside of his mouth. Sharp teeth, canine teeth, could be felt, and he took his paw away. Dog tongue hanging out, he continued to pant, thinking it over with some issue that his trouble with human speech might be in some way connected to how he’d lost his human tongue and had developed a canine muzzle. Opening his mouth as wide as he could, he took a moment to focus his mind before he worked out the words, “Duh am yuh oo. Duh ih ss ah yuh or fuh ah ll tuh.”<br />
<br />
But, even as the mangled speech left him, he was forced to reconcile with the truth it wasn’t all the fault of the girl he was unable to remember the name of. That he was as much to blame, as much as his brother, his friend, the girl’s sister, and friend’s little brother, whatever their names had been. In a way, it was the blame of all six of them for coming to this place in the first place.<br />
<br />
“I kuh nuh ah t be ss tuh kuk luh I k duh ih ss. I wuh ah nn t tuh be huh man ah guh an,” he whimpered as realised this, and bothered by how muddled his thoughts were, he took a moment to try to work out that what he should do was find a way to undo what had happened to him.<br />
<br />
Anything beyond that, he soon found it was difficult to plan that far, but considered he should either find the others, or get the hell out of the house before something else happened to him, possibility worse than what had already happened.<br />
<br />
Content with this line of thought, he forced himself to stand. Awkward in his movement, taking a couple seconds to orientate himself, he tried to take a step forward, but his body betrayed him. Dropping to all fours, he couldn’t stop himself right away as he took several steps forward. The ache he’d experienced when going about on two legs not as bad, but still present because of the in-between state he existed in, he almost gave in and accepted. Angry with himself, he couldn’t stop himself as he uttered a series of yips and barks of annoyance as he walked over to the wall  on all fours and pulled himself up.<br />
<br />
“I am not a chihuahua bitch,” he snarled and yapped, finding it was easier to talk if he uttered his word in the speech common of a dog. Pushing himself away from the wall, he barked out, “I am human. I am, well I don’t remember my name,” and with an unsteady gait, he tried to lurch to the middle of the hallway, but instead reached out a foreleg and placed his paw against the wall.<br />
<br />
The whimpers he let forth as he steadied himself conveyed the sudden spike in arousal he felt, and unable to stop himself, he reached down with his other paw and rubbed his toes over his female genitals. His noises growing, he found it hard to focus on what he planned as he yapped out, “Need, mate,” as his claws stimulated him as best as he could, as with what his hand had become, he was unable to fully sooth the yearning sensation.<br />
<br />
Privates slick with body fluids, he looked back the way he’d come. Somewhere, he didn’t how far back, there was an open door that led to a room where he had undergone the majority of his metamorphosis before he’d just managed to stop it. Inside that room was also a way to satisfy him, to sate his heat and lust, a way he’d already given into a number of times. It would be so easy to go back, to give in, to accept what had happened, to find a way to finish the transformation and give himself over to being a female dog. Hating himself for even considering such an option, he slowly took his paw away, and unable to stop himself, he sniffed at it.<br />
<br />
Canine sense of small able to detect his body’s lubrication, oestrus that meant he was ready to carry life, he wanted to squat down again and stick his nose into his privates and lick at them. His paw shaking, he forced himself to lower his foreleg as he resisted the urge and pushed himself away from the wall. Trying to keep his mind on his plan, he lurched down the hall, away from the room. His thoughts drifting, he found himself thinking of the others, struggling to recall what had brought them to Spelstorm Manor as he asked himself what had happened to them.</p>
