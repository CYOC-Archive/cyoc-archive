<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bruno entered an hour later, he was fucking pissed, at least the sauna was still hot.  He reset the timer, and raised his arm extending his middle finger at the sign on sauna wall, which read, &quot;SWIMSUITS REQUIRED IN SAUNA.&quot; <br />
<br />
He had done his ten laps, and then tried to enter the locker room from the walled outdoor pool area.  The door to the showers was locked.  It was a heavy steel door, and the sun had set.  It was getting cold.  He hated falling back.  Sure he gained an hour of sleep, but it got dark so early.  He pounded on the door, and shouted.  Nobody heard, or they were being pricks.  It was cold so he jumped back in the pool and swam a few more laps.  He was sure everyone was still in the sauna, but when they went to shower afterward, they would hear him knocking.  They didn&#39;t.  Finally, Bruno ended up shimmying over the 8 foot block wall that surrounded the pool. He ran around to the field entrance to the locker room, it was locked too.  He pounded on the door shivering. <br />
<br />
Coach Sinclair opened the door, he was carrying his briefcase, and holding his keys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bruno, what are you still doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got locked out,&quot; Bruno said quickly as he dashed inside, he was shivering.<br />
<br />
Coach sighed, &quot;Okay, Bruno, you go warm up in the sauna and shower.  Everybody went home.  I&#39;m sorry you got locked out.  The big game starts at 6PM, so I&#39;m heading out to watch it.  Normally, I don&#39;t like leaving students unsupervised, but you&#39;re 18 and responsible.  Just be sure you have everything when you leave because you&#39;re alone, and make sure the showers are off, and the sauna is off.  The lights are on a motion detector, so they will cut off after you leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everybody left?&quot; Bruno sounded said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We thought you had left already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said to do ten more laps,&quot; Bruno answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did the laps?  Great.  See, how responsible you are.  I gotta book, Bruno.  Travis can only hold my barstool for so long.  Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
The door slammed shut behind, the coach.  Bruno walked into the darkened locker room.  The motion detector lit the place up.  He was alone.  He made a beeline for his locker, and retrieved a big bottle of Malt Liquor. Then he headed for the sauna. He set the empty bottle on the floor of the sauna, as he entered.  He wanted to bake the chill out of his bones.  <br />
<br />
In the sauna, thank goodness it was still hot, Bruno turned the timer back on, and then looked up at the sign.  He shook his head, and raised his middle finger at the sign.  Then he peeled off his suit, and hung it on the wooden rail next to the furnace.  Then he lay face down on the wooden plank on the top bench.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Plank, thanks.  I knew you wouldn&#39;t leave without out me,&quot; Bruno said in is best Johnny voice. He laughed at himself, and lay his cheek against the wood that was Chad&#39;s face.  Bruno&#39;s hand slipped under him and began working his cock.  It was a weird fantasy, but it was Bruno&#39;s.<br />
<br />
He whispered, &quot;You know, Chad, I mean, Plank, I really&#39;ve had a crush on you since we were in grade school.  You were always silent, but I knew what you were thinking, and oh, - uh, Ed said you are cedar, but I&#39;m smelling sandal wood, maybe it&#39;s from all those guys sweating on you.&quot;  Bruno raised his ass, and started humping the plank with his stiff cock.  &quot;Oh, yeah, Ed did  a fine job sanding you.  Feels so smooth.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, Chad, I&#39;m, I&#39;m, I&#39;m- oh!<br />
<br />
SPLOOGE the hot cum splattered on Chad&#39;s former crotch and abs, and he absorbed it, as Bruno&#39;s sweaty body collapsed on him.<br />
<br />
Chad sputtered, Bruno&#39;s weight on him knocked the air out of him.  He was human again.  He was naked with Bruno and his cum on top of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bruno, I could kiss you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruno didn&#39;t need a second invitation.  He wasn&#39;t sure if he was dreaming or not.  Whether Chad had been plank or not, he had asked Bruno to kiss him.  Bruno&#39;s mouth locked with Chad&#39;s open mouth and his tongue slipped inside.<br />
<br />
A couple minutes later, Chad and Bruno were sitting buttcheek to butt cheek on the sauna bench slats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I wanna thank you, Bruno for changing me back.  That Ed was planning to leave me here forever,&quot; said Chad shaking his head.  He normally wouldn&#39;t sit this close to another guy, but after being wood for a while, he really needed to feel human skin against human skin.  &quot;I don&#39;t know how to thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how I changed you,  I guess it was my cum? Maybe you&#39;ll change back, if you don&#39;t get more. You can thank me with a blow job,&quot; Bruno said brightly.<br />
<br />
Chad could smell the alcohol on his breath. He glanced at the bottle on the floor.  He looked at the bench on which he had been sat upon, farted on and cum on.  He swallowed hard.  What if Bruno was right?  He did owe him, and it&#39;s what Plank would have done for Johnny, right?  Okay having had a brain that was solid wood for a few hours, meant Chad&#39;s brain wasn&#39;t really firing on all cylinders now that he was human again.  So he shrugged, got down on the lower bench, and started sucking Bruno&#39;s cock. <br />
<br />
Bruno glanced down at Chad&#39;s cock and commented, &quot;I thought your cock was bigger, Chad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is - or it was?&quot;  Chad said pulling back from Bruno&#39;s cock and looking down at himself.&quot;It is smaller, I guess cause Ed sanded it flat?&quot;  He absentmindedly licked Bruno&#39;s rod.  His head hurt when he thought, so he decided not to think, but instead to focus on getting Bruno&#39;s cum inside him.</p>
