<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian sat alone on his bed slowly rubbing the balloon giraffe he twisted his penis into with <br />
his left hand.  With his right he continuously honked his nose with ever increasing <br />
frequency.  Bridget had gone home to shower and change, and Brian took advantage of the <br />
alone time.  After he finally came Brian couldn’t help but think how masturbation was <br />
going to be a totally new thing from now on.  He cleaned up and went downstairs to wait <br />
for her.  His appearance very much the same from yesterday, the only difference is that his <br />
eyebrows finally finished transforming into the perfect upside down U’s located high up on <br />
his forehead.  Brian noted that his butt, which made its usual whoopee cushion sound as <br />
he sat down, was now beginning to get very sore.<br />
<br />
Brian turned at the sound of the door opening, lifted a butt cheek and let out a fart.  <br />
Bridget entered carrying a shopping bag and wearing very tight jeans, a pair of small <br />
boots with a 2-inch heel, and a very tight leopard print sleeveless shirt.  “Hey there!  <br />
How’s ole Stinky Butt?”  Bridget teased.<br />
<br />
Brian got up and looked cross with her.  “That’s not fun…” A loud fart escaped Brian’s butt <br />
filling the room with a horrible stench, “…ny,” Brian finished and hung his head in shame.<br />
<br />
“Hey don’t worry about it fatty big butt.  I brought something to help with that.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“This,” she smiled as she pulled a gas mask from the shopping bag.  She laughed at <br />
Brian’s obvious discomfort.<br />
<br />
“Oh your a riot Bridget, hyuck”<br />
<br />
“Did you just hyuck?”<br />
<br />
“Y…Yeah.  I couldn’t, hyuck, help myself.”<br />
<br />
“Something new everyday,” Bridget said as she was marveled at her own handiwork.<br />
<br />
Brian began tenderly shifting from side to side squeaking each time as he redistributed his <br />
weight.<br />
<br />
“What’s up with you?” Bridget inquired<br />
<br />
“My, duh, butt hurts.  Nuk, Nuk.”<br />
<br />
Bridget shook her head at Brian’s new speech patterns and looked back at him.  “Your butt <br />
hurts?”<br />
<br />
“Yep.”<br />
<br />
“Must be all the gay clown sex.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not funny, hyuck.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds like you thought it was.”<br />
<br />
“No it really hurts, like , der, something is trying to get out.”  All of a sudden Brian’s butt <br />
exploded in one fart after another.  They just wouldn’t stop as both of them began to <br />
panic.  Bridget panicked because she thought her chronic flatulence list item was out of <br />
control, and Brian because he couldn’t even slow down the streams of farts.  Bridget began <br />
pushing Brian outside the front door.  “What are you doing?!?  I can’t go out there!”<br />
<br />
“Yes you can!  No one is going to recognize you!  And if you don’t hurry we’re going to <br />
suffocate in here from your stank ass!”<br />
<br />
Brian faced with no real choice stepped outside into the night air.  He lived at the end of a <br />
cul-de-sac and there were very few houses, to attract too much attention.  Once outside <br />
Brian headed for the street.  Once he found the pavement he doubled over in pain, the <br />
farts getting louder and more intense.<br />
<br />
Bridget watched in horror.  She wanted revenge, sure, but she didn’t want to torture him <br />
with pain.<br />
<br />
Brian in the mean time felt something leaving his butt as the farts became more intense.  <br />
Finally with one mighty fart the pain was over and out popped a unicycle that he <br />
instinctively mounted.  He was amazed how he knew exactly how to ride it, and seemed to <br />
have perfect balance.  “Hyuck, No way, Hyuck,” he whispered to himself.<br />
<br />
Bridget was both relieved and amazed as she watched Brian peddle around the cul-de-sac <br />
as if he had been riding that unicycle since birth.  She watched as he made sharp turns, <br />
moved forward and backwards, sped up to almost ridiculous speeds, and slowed down <br />
without any problems.  Brian then began to circle around her very tightly.  <br />
<br />
“Throw me some, duh, objects,” he said to her.<br />
<br />
She looked around, “Like what?”<br />
<br />
“Anything!”  He shouted more out of need than anger.<br />
<br />
Bridget picked up a few rocks, about the size of golf balls, and threw them to Brian as he <br />
peddled around.  He caught them and started to juggle.  He started with 3 rocks, but as <br />
Bridget threw more and more he ended up with twelve in total.  He had no problem <br />
keeping up with the numbers and juggled with two hands, then one hand, and then split <br />
the group up and juggled six in each hand separately.  All while peddling around on the <br />
unicycle.  It was one of the most amazing things either of them ever saw.  Finally he was <br />
finished and threw them to the side.<br />
<br />
Brian then halted the unicycle in front of Bridget.  He gave a little hop up and came down <br />
on the unicycle, which amazingly went back up into his butt.  He fell to the ground and <br />
immediately popped up onto his feet, with a small fart. <br />
<br />
“Where did it go Bridget?” asked as she checked the back of Brian’s pants and couldn’t <br />
find a hole for it to have slipped into.<br />
<br />
“I…I don’t know,” he replied as he inspected his own bottom.<br />
<br />
“Can you bring it back?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know.  Hee Hee.  Let me try.”  And with that Brian concentrated and farted loudly <br />
and sure enough the unicycle appeared under him again.<br />
<br />
“Make it disappear.”<br />
<br />
Brian then made it disappear the same way he had before.  He made it appear and <br />
disappear a few times, until both were satisfied he could do it whenever he wanted to now.  <br />
<br />
Bridget spotted car lights coming as Brian did little tricks on his new toy.  “Better get <br />
inside if you don’t want anyone to see you,” she told him.  She was amazed to watch him <br />
ride up his front walk and into the house, even riding up the two small steps at the door, <br />
like it was nothing.  She walked behind him and watched as he picked up the TV remote, a <br />
vase, and a medium size knick-knack of his mother’s and began to juggle them again, <br />
almost as if it was relaxing and natural for him to do so.  She smiled to herself about how <br />
her revenge was working out and closed the door and shouted to Brian, “Hey I think we <br />
may need to air the place out!  You know because of your gas attack earlier, Fattie Stinks-<br />
a-lot!”</p>
