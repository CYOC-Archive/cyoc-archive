<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex nodded appreciatively as he explored his villa. The whitewashed walls with blue accented windows, shutters, and roof stood out against the luscious mountain. Complete with a small pool, it looked picturesque like something found on a postcard under loud lettering proclaiming <b>Visit Beautiful Greece!</b><br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking Eric.&quot; He laughed as he stepped inside. The interior was spacious and open, with a wide squat bed and a small kitchenette. The table had a bowl of grapes and a glass of wine artistically displayed with a welcome card that contained a list of the amenities the resort offered: dances, wine tasting, dining, hikes, labyrinth tours, historic sites, parties, mermaid swims, werehorse rides...There would be plenty to due during his stay and he couldn&#39;t decide which he wanted to try first.<br />
<br />
Maybe he&#39;d ask Orion. <i>Maybe Orion would give him a tour...</i> He let his mind wander as he continued to explore.<br />
<br />
The first order of business, however, was definitely a shower. Maybe he&#39;d hop in the pool later, but right now he just felt gross after the flight and short train-ride. He hoped he&#39;d get used to the humidity sooner than later. He grabbed a handful of grapes and popped a few in his mouth as he kicked off his shoes and tossed his bag next to the bed.<br />
<br />
The shower was out in the open in the bathroom, and he was relieved he was staying alone. The waterfall showerhead stuck out from the wall, and the tile floor was shaped to look like rocks as it sloped towards a drain that likely fed into pipes below. Alex stripped and started the shower, testing the temperature before stepping inside to sit on the stone bench within. He sighed, relaxing as the water washed over him.<br />
<br />
Orion&#39;s muscled form came to his mind, the white fur glistening in the twilight of his thoughts. The werewolf was quite the sight and <i>that sheath</i>. He wondered what it felt like as his cock grew hard. He traced his fingers along the shaft as the fantasy continued. The tail, wagging slightly as they spoke, walking up the mountain. The fur looked so soft, too. <i>It would probably feel amazing against his back as...</i> He started to stroke himself, his throbbing dick slick with the water. The thoughts were unusual, but welcome.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could help you with that if you want, &#931;&#941;&#958;&#953;.&quot; A singsong voice spoke suddenly, purring with a heavy accent from nearby as Alex jumped and hit his head on the tile behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHA--OWW! FUCK!&quot; He looked around wildly towards the source of the voice as he realized he didn&#39;t know where the towels were. He awkwardly shoved his hands in front of his pulsing cock. &quot;Who the fuck are you? Haven&#39;t you heard of knocking?!&quot;<br />
<br />
A satyr, about 5&#39;6&quot; feet tall, grinned at him from the doorway, his emerald green eyes shining wickedly as he fingered at his own throbbing erection, which was easily at least a foot long and vaguely human-shaped, though more cylindrical near its leaking head. He had olive skin, which disappeared into thick brown fur at his hips, his legs ending in distinctly caprine legs complete with hooves. The fur on his hocks and chest was feathered, though moist with a light sweat. His body was lithe and toned with a gracefulness to it. His face was beautiful and masculine, with a thick goatee and framed by a wild mane of hair, out of which jutted two horns about 6 inches long. A golden chain dangled from his right horn and connected to the piercing in his nose. Alex could smell him from where he sat, and the musk went straight to his dick. He smelled of pure sex, which is what he was offering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrzej, pleasure.&quot; He approached, his hooves clicking on the floor, and Alex felt deeply conflicted. He couldn&#39;t remember feeling this horny in a while. &quot;I bet you taste &#915;&#955;&#965;&#954;&#972;&#962;, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex shook his head, feeling light headed. He put out a hand to stop the Satyr. <i>This was too much.</i> &quot;No. I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m not...interested.&quot; He couldn&#39;t help but stare at the massive dick between the Satyr&#39;s legs, which he flexed invitingly.<br />
<br />
Andrzej frowned and nodded as Alex&#39;s head immediately began to clear. The cloud over his mind began to abate. &quot;You&#39;re no fun. What&#39;s your name, Human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex. Wait, was this your doing?&quot; He gestured to his dick as it began to soften.<br />
<br />
The satyr grinned mischievously looking guilty, but he didn&#39;t admit to anything. &quot;I just wanted to give you a nice warm welcome. You&#39;re cute, you know. I&#39;d love to play with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex blushed but he held firm. &quot;Next time, maybe ask my name first? Besides. I just got here. Andy? Was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrzej laughed, the sound was more bleat than anything, &quot;No. But that works.&quot; He turned to leave and Alex saw a short, fluffy tail above his voluptuous furry ass. &quot;If you change your mind, <i>Alex</i>, I&#39;ll be in the Tityroi Vinyard. I hope to see you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon Alex was alone again as he laughed at the absurdity of what had just happened. He&#39;d heard stories of Satyrs, but that was on another level. He&#39;d have to be careful. He decided he was done with his shower and began to look for a towel. He&#39;d also need to start locking his doors. Hopefully Orion would have some advice on dealing with the locals.</p>
