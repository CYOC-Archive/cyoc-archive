<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nathan&#39;s newfound friend was currently shuffling her feet uncomfortably as they stood in front of her house.<br />
 <br />
Nat just spent the last few minutes giving Mary a tour of the town.<br />
 <br />
She had a lot of fun showing Mary around. Though sometimes she wondered if she had ever seen a town before. Why would she ask what a store looked like? At least Mary seem eager in asking questions. It made things more interesting.<br />
 <br />
Nat made a mental note that Mary hadn&#39;t said much since she suggested staying for the night, but she assumed it was due to her being rather self conscious about her personal appearance and hygiene. Come to think about it, she did smell a little...<br />
 <br />
“Don’t worry.” Nathan assured. “I’m sure my parents will let you take a bath and wash your clothes before you leave tomorrow.” Nat reassured with a smile. After a thought she added, “On second thought, with my mother involved, it’s <i>GUARANTEED</i> that you will be smelling like a freshly born cloud by sunrise.<br />
 <br />
Mary didn&#39;t look reassured. In fact, she looked like she was ready to bolt. It was as if she didn&#39;t want to take a bath.<br />
<br />
<i>&#39;Weird.&#39;</i> Nat thought.<br />
 <br />
But before Mary can say anything, the front door of Nat’s house cracked open.<br />
 <br />
“Nathan? Is that you?” A feminine voice called out as a woman’s head peeked out the door.<br />
 <br />
“Yes mommy?” Nat answered back.<br />
 <br />
“I told you to call me ‘Mother’!  And you better have a good excuse for being late! And who are you talking to?” The woman hollered back.<br />
 <br />
“She just arrived at town. She is on her way to a nearby village on her map and I offered to let her stay for the night.” Nat quickly explained.<br />
 <br />
A bright light flooded Mary’s bewildered face as the front door fully opened. Behind it was a grown woman who she could only assume to be Nat’s mother. Oddly enough, she had battle gear equipped over her dress. It was as if she was ready for a rescue mission. And knowing her mother, she probably is. Nat is glad that she came home when she did. Wouldn’t want a repeat of last time she was late.<br />
 <br />
“Nathan! What did I tell you about inviting people without our permission!?” Nat’s mother complained.<br />
 <br />
“But she needed help!” Nat whined.<br />
 <br />
Nat’s mother doesn’t respond. Instead she walked up to examine Mary more closely. Mary suddenly felt terribly self-conscious. The intimidating presence this woman gave off made her feel exposed. It was as if she is looking into her very being.<br />
 <br />
She then turned to Nat with a curious eye.<br />
 <br />
“She doesn’t look like any of the kids who live here. Is she new here? Did you kidnap this poor girl?” Nat’s mother deduced and questioned, leaning towards her daughter.<br />
 <br />
“Of course not!” Nat denied and debunked in a flustered fashion.<br />
 <br />
Nat’s mother paid Nat no heed as she turned to address Mary.<br />
 <br />
“Where are your parents young one?” Nat’s mother asked in a gentle tone.<br />
 <br />
Mary’s eyes remained downcast. “I- M- My Parents are not here. I am traveling alone back to my village.” She stammered.<br />
 <br />
For some reason, her mother didn’t look convinced, but then again, Nat also had her own doubts that Mary traveled through the forest alone. She couldn’t imagine how dangerous it could be outside of town, especially without anyone to keep her company.<br />
 <br />
“She was planning to travel back to her village during the night.” Nat gestured to the setting sun for emphasis.<br />
 <br />
Nat’s mother raises an eyebrow “Is she…?”<br />
 <br />
Nat’s mother kneeled down to Mary’s level. “What is your name young one? Have you traveled through the forest at night before?”<br />
 <br />
Mary respectfully shook her head. “I am sorry madam. But I currently don’t feel comfortable enough to tell my name to more people than I should. And to answer your other question, yes, I have traveled through the countryside at night. I must get to my destination as soon as possible.”<br />
 <br />
Her mother’s eyebrow cocked with sarcasm. “My! Aren’t you the brave one! Then you must know how dangerous it is to travel alone through the forest at night?”<br />
 <br />
Mary nodded with certainty in her eyes. “The only real threat are the ursulas. I just fight off the lupines and run away from the ursulas.”<br />
 <br />
Surprise riddled Nat’s and her mother’s faces. Dealing with the wildlife with just a fencing sword is no easy feat. Especially for someone as young as Mary.<br />
<br />
“Am I hearing that right? The moonlight makes everything in the forest glow, making everything blend together and harder to distinguish with just your sight. Not to mention that the animals have other means of tracking you than just sight.” Nat’s mother gave a questioning look, as if to confirm that Mary wasn’t joking.<br />
 <br />
“It’s not a problem. I figured out how to use the moonlight to my advantage against certain animals. For example, ursulas may be strong, but they rely more on their ability to sense moisture than their eyesight. Kicking up bushes to spread mist has allowed me to distract them while I made my escape.” Mary explained.<br />
 <br />
“Really...” The skepticism was practically drooling from her mother’s lips.<br />
 <br />
Nat’s mother took the time to examine Mary. The girl’s clothes were ripped in places. She’s practically wearing rags. Nat’s mother would even go as far as call them indecent. No. It&#39;s worse than indecent. She is a fashion disaster. Whether or not she was telling the truth, she certainly looked and smelled the part of someone traveling through the forest for days. <br />
<br />
“Were do you sleep during your travels?” Nat’s mother tested.<br />
 <br />
“Anywhere that can be used as shelter.” Mary casually answered.<br />
<br />
“Do you have a sleeping bag?” Questioned Nat’s mother.<br />
 <br />
Mary patted her “clothes”. “No Madam. All I have is my sword.”<br />
 <br />
Nat’s mother’s face hardened with purpose.<br />
 <br />
Nat sensed the signs, and tried to divert the incoming storm…<br />
 <br />
“Now, now… We don’t know much about Mary. For all we know, she probably didn’t have the choice to worry about hygiene. Maybe she couldn’t get better supplies? Either way, I’m sure she would have taken care of herself if she had the chance.” Nat said.<br />
 <br />
Skepticism was practically dripping from her mother’s face as she eyed her daughter. “You don’t say…”<br />
 <br />
Her mother directed her attention to the strange girl. “Say Mary… If you did have the ability to take a bath, and wash yourself during your travels, would you do it?” Her mother asked.<br />
 <br />
To the female’s utter shock, Mary shook her head.<br />
 <br />
“No. I can’t waste time doing stuff like that. Unless taking a bath proved to be efficient in any way I rather use my time for things that will help me survive.” Mary replied.<br />
 <br />
...The attempt to advert the storm has failed.<br />
 <br />
Nathan’s mother gave Mary the look of disapproval. “Young lady. I may not know what you’ve been through, but I’m still a mother. And as a mother, I say your clothes are too ripped up and smell too much of sweaty men. You do realize that the stronger your sent, the more you’ll attract animals. And I’m assuming that you haven’t had proper rest since you started your travels. Your mind can’t stay sharp continuously without proper sleep. You are staying with us for the night and that is final. I’m sure your family will understand.”<br />
 <br />
Mary’s eyes filled with panic.<br />
 <br />
“B-but! I’m only came to visit for a few minutes! I must get to my destination tonight!”<br />
 <br />
“Where was the last place you slept young lady?” The adult asked. The panicked girl quickly paused.<br />
 <br />
“Uh... under a bunch of bushes.. on the ground... It&#39;s a good place to stay undetected from the bigger animals. And I have made sure that the bug bites were not poisonous. And the lupine pee helps keep me undetected.” Mary answered with a confused look, a nervous smile creeping onto her face as she recounts her achievements.<br />
 <br />
The mother almost wept for the poor girl.<br />
<br />
A resolute look overtook the mother&#39;s face. “I rest my case. A proper lady must have higher standards than that. Come with me.”<br />
 <br />
Leaving no room for argument, Nat’s mother grabbed Mary’s hand and dragged her into Nat’s house without a moment wasted.<br />
 <br />
Nat was suddenly left standing alone in her front yard. Unable to contain herself, she cracked a smile and giggled as her mother had directed her wrath on a soul less fortunate than her for once.<br />
 <br />
Nat’s mother poked her head through the front doorway again, glaring at her daughter menacingly.<br />
 <br />
“Don’t think I’ve forgotten about you! Help your father prepare dinner while I teach your friend a lesson about personal hygiene!”<br />
 <br />
“Coming!”<br />
 <br />
With a smile on her face, Nat ran into the house after them.<br />
