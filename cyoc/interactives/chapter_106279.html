<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt couldn’t help the surge of dark thoughts that ate through him, ‘With this I can have some revenge.’ He had not ever been abused, but his none-blood relatives came very close pretty often with their teasing and bullying. So now it was time to turn the tables, Matt chuckled and then moved towards the hallway of their home. Now Matts’ relatives lived in a modest two story house, on a nice street, in a good neighborhood, and in most cases one would assume that this was the vision of the American dream. Well they would be wrong.<br />
<br />
Matt took a moment to think, amongst his family certain individuals treated him better than others, but all of them treated each other much better than him. So he would go down a list and with it complete his revenge. First up mommy dearest, the poor women was in her early forties and it was starting to show. Small lines began to appear in her face, and limbs. Skin began to sag in places she once treasured above others. Her hair became dry and unappealing, almost becoming the texture of hay, but retaining some youthful glow. <br />
<br />
He started walking towards the kitchen where he could hear the women humming some old show tunes as she cooked, completely absorbed in her work. He stood in the doorway taking her in, she was dressed in relax wear and had a white apron covering her chest as she stood over the table setting the table. Her hair was tied up in a bun, excusing a few stray strands that leaked downwards. She stood up and wiped her hand across her head, collecting a sizable amount of sweat before she noticed Matt.<br />
<br />
Her face turned into a scowl and he could see her eyes harden, she had never liked him and often treated him the very worst. “What are you doing in her?” Her cruel tone rang out. “You know that you eat dinner in your room, not down here with the rest of us.” She turned her noise up and the thought of eating with Matt.<br />
<br />
‘I’ll teach you.’ Matt thought dangerously before focusing on an image in his mind. The woman was always afraid of how she looked, so it was only fitting that her punishment fit the crime. “Arial I was just here to ask you a question?” Matt spoke with a sickly sweet tone as his face portrayed an innocent child, contrary to his intentions.<br />
<br />
“What question, done think I will let you stay here! Dinner starts in a few minutes and my sweeties don’t need to finish their day with the sight of you.” The women had a shrill voice as she complained about having to even partake in the conversation. <br />
<br />
‘Oh don’t worry mother dearest, soon it won’t matter what you want’ Matt was walking towards her and was within arm’s reach in moments, leaning forward he stared deep into her eyes. “Do you love me?” The question was honest, but the tone flat. Even as Matt said the words he already knew the answer, this was simply part of the plan.<br />
Ariel’s face scrunched up at the thought, and her eyes filled with disgust. “I could never love something like YOU!” She finished before turning around and returning to her cooking with a huff.<br />
<br />
Matt was silent, his face void of all emotion. He was still as marble before he simply whispered, “Fine by me.” He turned away from her and focused all his willpower on an image, as well as a set of stipulations to follow the image before he turned back around facing his mother. “I think that you’re a terrible mother, always treating me like trash. Well you know what? I am fed up of being the beating bag for your emotional problems so I think it’s time that you reap what you have sown, don’t you?” Matt spoke calmly but his voice wavered with emotions as it came to a close. Ariel turned around, her face swelling with red anger but before she could speak Matt said, “I think that you should be the same on the outside that you are on the inside, you filthy pig.”<br />
<br />
As soon as he said the word Ariel gasped, she felt sudden indigestion and bowed over from pain. Looking down at her Matt repeated himself, “You are nothing more than a pig!” She fell on the floor arms spread, pain radiating from her body. It started to feel bloated like she had eaten too much, the pain grew with the sensation. “Pig!” Matt repeated face turned into a sneer, Ariel let out a loud shriek that sounded more like a squeal. Ariel was still on the ground but her form was trembling, her skin had already started to darken a few shades of pink, and something was pressing against the seat of her pants.<br />
<br />
“What have you…oink...done to me?” She gasped out as her body began to tremble, gaining weight ever so slowly. Her now pinkish skin expanding with her frame, the clothes on her body pushing.<br />
<br />
Matt smiled, something dark and sinister lurking beneath it. “Why I am simply returning you to your form mother, didn’t you know? You were never a human; you have always been a PIG.” <br />
<br />
Ariel let out another gasp and spread her arms and legs apart even more, the skin had reached a breaking point and was pooling over the stretched out clothes, now too many sizes too small. Her pants busted outwards and her panties ripped, revealing a fleshy twirled pink tail that grew with the rest of her. She started to pant, and with each breath of air her face slowly pushed outwards. First a small point that she could barely see, then it was a half-snout that stood off her face. <br />
<br />
“SQUEL! What have you…oink…done to…oink…me?” She tried talking but her new mouth was a part of her snout making speaking hard. She started making more piggish noises, as her body continued to change. <br />
<br />
Her hands began to harden, much to her dismay. She tried to stop her fingers from bending inwards, but it was a futile gesture. Ariel watched as her fingers darkened and slowly grew together, into a three fingered hand, yet it didn’t stop there it kept hardening and shifting until she was the proud owner of two new trotters. She tried to stand up, the strain visibly on her snouted face. The ears had started to point and moving upwards. With a loud “SQUEL!” She managed to stand up, and as a consequence her clothes burst off her frame, now too small for her pig body. Naked she looked more pig than human; already rows of teats started pushing out from her chest, even as her breasts grew smaller to match them, the tail at her rear had grown to full sized and swayed behind her, the front of her body began to bloat and expanded outwards warping her form even more. Matt watched in satisfaction as Ariel began to titter her feet turning into trotters as she stood on them.<br />
<br />
“Nooooo…. SQUEL!” Her face pushed out into a full on snout as she fell on the dinner table. Her weight crushing the thing into splinters, even as her arms and legs rotated to the front of her body. She was almost completely a pig now; the only thing human remaining was her vagina. Though that wasn’t for much longer, her womanhood started pushing backwards and growing in size, moving until it was right under her pulsing piggy pucker. Her new piggy vagina, started to leak as the now sow began to grunt and squeal as she entered heat.<br />
<br />
Matt walked out of the kitchen and deeply satisfied smile on his face. ‘One down, four more to go.’ He thought as he moved onwards.</p>
