<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff shook his head a bit as he watched his dad run off to the other room. With how much the older man seemed to know about furries and more how specific he was with his wish; it was pretty hard to think that he didn&#39;t find them, at the very least, sexually interesting. And the extra testosterone that must have been running through his body now as well probably helped a bit as well. So, Jeff turned back to his computer. <br />
<br />
However, he was surprised to find that a progress bar was still filling. [Finalizing changes.]<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What more needs to change?&quot; Jeff wondered. He scratched at his neck trying to think about what else needed to really change. It wasn&#39;t a nail that itched his neck, rather a sharp claw. &quot;Oh shit...&quot; he cursed pulling it back to see a massive claw jutting out of the end of his finger. &quot;Abort. Abort. Abort,&quot; he looked around for a screen to cancel the transformation, but nothing seemed to be there. He swung the mouse around and finally went to the top right of the screen to click the &#39;X&#39; and close everything down. Nothing happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck...&quot; he groaned as he felt the changes start to speed up. Unlike his dad, he wasn&#39;t a very athletic guy. The two barely shared any interests at all. Though that was rapidly changing as his muscles started to swell. Biceps appeared where none had been before. He could feel the tightness of his shirt, pressing against his shoulders and his chest. But that quickly changed as the sleeves seemed to disappear and only two thin straps remained. He looked down to see his chest starting to block some of his vision. No longer a completely flat slab, instead there were two hard muscles pushing out in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; Jeff felt a stupid smile fill his face as the raw power from his growing body started to hit him. Muscle seemed to build on top of muscle just making him all the stronger. He stood up and found a full length mirror hanging on his wall that hadn&#39;t been there before. Naturally, he went over to it and flexed his muscles watching them bulge. What had barely even been 12 inches round quickly turned into 15 but then only grew to 17 inches. &quot;Look at those babies,&quot; he gave his left bicep a slap, not noticing the deepening of his voice or the fur growing up his hands.<br />
<br />
White fur with black striped continued to grow around his body. Jeff didn&#39;t seem to care as he continued to flex and pose for himself in the mirror. Just watching it cover his six pack abs or run down over his calves, making them bulk up even more just seemed to excite him. He continued to flex and pose showing off his growing ass. Even as his spine elongated behind him, he only let out a bit of a grunt, not even noticing the hole in his shorts designed exactly for it.<br />
<br />
With his excitement for his body, Jeff didn&#39;t even notice the changes happening to his room. No longer was it stock full of obscure video game or anime paraphernalia, but instead it had weights and books on working out. His bed had nearly doubled in size and all his clothing had changed to fit his bodybuilder physique. Jeff put a finger up to his face watching as the white and black fur covered his widening chin. He cocked a smile as his face grew more masculine.<br />
<br />
Just like his father, he had to open his mouth and twist it slightly as new larger sharper teeth filled his mouth. It was only a bit awkward as his face stretched and the structure of his skull changed to that more of a tiger&#39;s. He smiled as he saw his ears slide up the sides of his face and then round out into rounder. His sharp eyes stared at his handsome tiger body. Even as he stretched taller and his weight shifter to the front of his foot, he never lost sight of himself as the mirror grew to accommodate him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; Jeff smirked. An arrogant aura seemed to surround him a bit more as he clearly knew he was hot. &quot;I&#39;m so glad dad&#39;s a tiger. Makes everything so much easier...&quot; New memories were starting to worm their way into his mind as he ran his clawed fingers over his hard furry muscles. Each time teasing himself a bit more. Blood flowed through him even more rapidly. He looked down with another cocked grin. &quot;Really big guy?&quot; His cock was straining against his shorts. <br />
<br />
He shook his body and pulled up some pictures for inspiration. He&#39;d always been fascinated with big bodybuilders. Mostly with how hard humans had to work to get there. But just like his football team, he&#39;d made all of them look absolutely tiny just by being there. Muscle seemed to just grow on him and he loved wiping the cocky grin off their faces. His 20 inch arms were still growing and looked lean only because of how tall he was. But he loved it when he&#39;d take one of the other college guys down. He&#39;d offer them a smirk then see their face go red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck yeah...&quot; Jeff pulled some inspiration up on his phone and made his way back to his bed. He continued to jerk himself off to the new memories forming. Mostly the ones where other guy&#39;s girlfriends would come up and &#39;pet his fur.&#39; It was obvious they wanted to feel his muscles as they continued to grope him and lean their small bodies against his big arms. But it was more satisfying watching the boyfriend stare off in a bit of anger, unable to do anything. Not that Jeff would have minded. He would have been totally down for a threesome or even just beating his ass right then and there. <br />
<br />
Jeff let out a hearty grunt as copious amounts of cum unloaded from his dick. The tissues he had weren&#39;t nearly enough to properly contain the load he&#39;d just made. It jumped up onto his furry abs and he naturally rubbed it in, even giving it a bit of a taste. Then paused. &quot;The hell?&quot; he paused again just now realizing that was his voice. He quickly jumped up, dick still out and looked at the mirror. This time more closely at his body. His long ropey tail swished back and forth as he contemplated what had just occurred. No longer was he the short scrawny kid with glasses, but now a 6&#39;8&quot; 300+ pound bodybuilder tiger. Every bit of him bulged. Even as he flexed again he felt blood running into his cock engorging it to a full on 11 inch mast. <br />
<br />
He reached for his head again, feeling the two memories running against each other. On the one hand he&#39;d never looked up to anyone other than his father in his life, on the other he couldn&#39;t remember anything other than feeling absolutely tiny. He remembered being the absolute perfect athlete that nearly every coach begged to have on his team, while also knowing full well no coach would even look at him twice. It was just so confusing. But with the weights and posters of other bodybuilders lining his walls, it was pretty obvious which memories were true towards this person. He reached at his head again. It was just so hard to think. Everything felt significantly harder to process. Jeff rushed back over to the computer to see that the progress bar had filled. <br />
<br />
[Process complete. What else would you like to change?]</p>
