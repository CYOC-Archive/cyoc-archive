<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Kevin!&quot;<br />
<br />
Carrie&#39;s jerky ex-boyfriend was walking right toward her, the same jerk she&#39;d dumped a month ago for consuming too much porn (he loved the big titties) and flirting with half the girls that crossed his path.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
He could not see her! He must not! Not now! Not like this! Fuck that! No way!<br />
<br />
Mashing her tits against the door, she rebounded back and stumbled away to the nearest hiding spot, which just so happened to be behind a new books display, and waited breathlessly for him to pass. Thankfully, he walked right on by. She let out a sigh of relief. Another one of Kevin&#39;s virtues, besides the aforementioned sexual cravings, was his lack intellectual curiosity. Really, her best hiding place was behind any source of knowledge. She chuckled quietly. Yeah, if she really wanted to hide, all she would have to do is wrap books around herself. She would be all but invisible to him.<br />
<br />
Why did she ever date him? she wondered. Okay, yes, he was sexy as hell... but also a total ass hat, she reminded herself. To put it simply, their breakup had been one of the proudest achievements in her adult life. For him to see her like this... well, goodbye, pride.<br />
<br />
As she watched his cute butt walk off, she noticed a problem. Shit! Her backpack was still sitting where she&#39;d left it when that asshole had shrunk her into mini-stripper hell. Kevin might recognize it. He might take it. Gasp! She might have to talk to him!<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
She had to grab it before he could. She stood up and immediately remembered that she was not standing with as much up-ness as before. Christ, this day had gone to shit fast. Her little legs and meaty curves made running an impossibility. She would need stealth... a disguise.<br />
<br />
Looking up at the books, she asked herself aloud, &quot;Would that really work?&quot;<br />
<br />
This is stupid, she thought to herself seconds later as she held an open book in front of her face, pretending to read, while mincing along toward her bag and Kevin, who was quickly approaching it. Hurry! The gap closed between them, and then, just has he noticed the bag, she passed him and grabbed a shoulder strap with one hand as the other held the book up hiding her blushing face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; Kevin said with a mixed note of surprise and intrigue. She peeked over the book and watched as his eyes ran down and up her ridiculous body. It was a short trip, though he did take a long pit stop while gazing at her enormous tits. She would have smacked him right then if she could have reached his face. Stupid stubby arms!<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s quite a load you&#39;re carrying there,&quot; Kevin said. &quot;Maybe I could... give you a hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
What a perfect asshole, she thought. &quot;No thanks,&quot; she said trying to make her voice squeak a bit to disguise herself even more. She grunted as she hefted the suddenly very heavy bag onto her shoulder, nearly tipping herself over in the process. She pressed the book firmly against her nose to hold it in place. &quot;I&#39;ve got it just fine,&quot; she said while muffled behind the book. What a crap lie. She could barely stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Kevin asked. &quot;I am always ready to help out a lady in distress.&quot; He smiled that stupid beautiful smile of his.<br />
<br />
She was about to kick him in the shin and tell him to go fuck off, when a leggy blonde approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kevin,&quot; the blonde said and then stepped up to give him a peck on the cheek. A new girl, of course he had a new girl already, and she was tall and beautiful and blonde. Fuck my life, Carrie thought. The blonde looked down at her with a mix of curiosity and defensive jealously. Clearly, Kevin&#39;s new girl had sized up his tastes and saw Carrie for the potential threat that her new busty body was. She stood up tall and straight and asked, &quot;Who&#39;s your little friend, Kevin?&quot; Clear emphasis on the word, &quot;little,&quot; there.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-Nobody,&quot; he stuttered. &quot;Just some girl I almost tripped over.&quot; The blonde looked unconvinced. &quot;I was just going to help her pick up her bag,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blonde looked down on Carrie again, this time she was miles above her, as aloof as a sexy skyscraper. Carrie was no threat anymore. She was nothing. She was a bug, a curvy distracting bug. If the blonde could have squashed her under her shoe she would have, Carrie realized. But, she didn&#39;t have to. Kevin had done some quick math and had calculated that he should stick to the girl he knew. After all, he had never even seen Carrie&#39;s face behind the book.<br />
<br />
Carrie backed away from them both still concealing her face, while stumbling under the weight of the bag on her shoulder. At her diminished size, her old bag weighed approximately a metric fuck ton. It took all of her strength to keep walking. Just get to the door, she thought as she trudged on unsteadily backwards, unwilling to take her eyes off of Kevin. Just get away from this hell.<br />
<br />
The blonde possessively wrapped an arm around Kevin&#39;s elbow, and was about to lead him away when, suddenly, an alarm went off.<br />
<br />
The book! Carrie had reached the door, but the book masking her face was not checked out. Everyone turned to look at her as the alarm blared. Dozens of eyes on her miniaturized, hyper-sexualized form. Run! she thought. Get the fuck out of there. She leaned against the door hard but was immediately reminded of her old problem, it would not move. It was still too heavy for her. She took a step back and rammed the door. It barely budged. She searched around desperately for an escape and quickly spotted her salvation: the handicapped button! She smacked it with her little hand and a pair of doors automatically swung open for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; a woman called. &quot;You need to check that out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carrie turned toward the doors, dropped the book (&quot;Hey, be gentle with that!&quot; the librarian cried), and ran to freedom as fast as her stubby legs would carry her.<br />
<br />
Sweating and panting as she scrambled away down the sidewalk, a realization hit her: she had needed the handicapped button. She was handicapped now. Todd had handicapped her. Tears mixed with her sweat. Her nose ran, and so did she... but not far. Only a short distance from the library doors she ran into someone.<br />
<br />
It was...</p>
