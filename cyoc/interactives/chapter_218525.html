<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taylor Cunnings droved back home with the strange device in tow. She wasn&#39;t quite sure why she bought it, nor didn&#39;t really hesitate to spend that much on it. It didn&#39;t sound like a product with practical applications, more so for having fun or getting revenge. Regardless, she now owned it and would decide how to use it later. <br />
<br />
Once home, she sashayed her way through the front door, putting the remote with its manual on the side table right next to it. Her son, Jimmy, wouldn&#39;t be home for a few hours, since he was out with friends. That gave her some time to take a nap before he came home, which would also be about the time she had to make him dinner before heading to work for the evening shift. She hated that shift, since it was when all the obnoxious customers came out. Snorting at the though of it, she slipped her flip flops off and went to her bed. She always slept in the nude and naps were no exception, so she took off her tight clothing as well. Turning off the lights, she got comfortable and drifted to sleep within minutes. <br />
<br />
Half an hour later, Jimmy entered the house. His friends had to go do their own thing early into their hangout, so he just went home. He saw his mom&#39;s car in the driveway and realized she was here. &quot;Probably napping again.&quot; He surmised, kicking his sneakers off. Stretching his arms, Jimmy&#39;s hand brushed against the side table, whereupon he noticed the remote. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; He pondered.<br />
<br />
Within minutes, Jimmy knew all about the remote and what each function did. If it was real, he could have so much fun with it! But, he had to test to be sure, and he&#39;d certainly have to use the blue button so there&#39;s no problems. For the sake of convenience, he chose his mom, Taylor. Sneaking upstairs, he crept into the darkened bedroom where she slept. Pressing the blue button and aiming at her, he zapped his unsuspecting parent.<br />
<br />
Once the process was complete, Jimmy definitely believed in the remote&#39;s power. For he now stood there, naked, with his mom&#39;s body from the neck down. &quot;Incredible!&quot; He whispered, hearing his mother&#39;s voice leave his lips. Tiptoeing over to her closet, he shut the door and turned the lights on. He was still in shock to see he had now become a mature woman. His mom had K cup boobs, which helped with getting more tips, but gave her back pains after a long day. Her wide hips and huge butt were perfect eye catchers in any clothes, her long, shapely legs and dainty feet would make anyone gain a leg and foot fetish just by seeing them. Yes, indeed, it was the perfect milf body. And now it was Jimmy&#39;s. <br />
<br />
He spent no time in deciding he wanting to dress his new female self up. Jimmy found a pink tube top and put it on, the tight fabric making his cleavage burst out the top of it. A g string was nestled between his now very moist pussy lips, as a micro skirt showed off his thick ass and thighs. He didn&#39;t even know why she owned these, but he now wore his mom&#39;s 8 inch tall black platform flip flops, extending his now shortened height back up to a tall 6&#39; 3&#39;&#39;. Smirking to himself, he hobbled around a bit to get used to walking, before leaving the room carefully. He made sure to take his mother&#39;s previously discarded clothes, since they wouldn&#39;t be fitting her anymore. <br />
<br />
It would be incorrect to say that Jimmy didn&#39;t love this. His mom&#39;s hot body was now under his control, so he spent his time getting acquainted to it. That included fingering himself and sucking his tits until climax, getting his bed absolutely soaked in mature woman sweat and sex juices. It was at that point that he decided to keep her body permanently. Using the blue button meant Taylor would never know what happened, nor would anyone else. He was free to live his life as a guy with a milf body forever.<br />
<br />
His mom eventually did wake up, not surprised by herself now having her son&#39;s body under head. She didn&#39;t remember why she was still fully clothed, yet still got changed. However, she had to go to Jimmy&#39;s room to get her attire; since he had more clothes than her, she remembers they just decided to use each other&#39;s dressers and closets. Dressing up in clothes that were the right color for her work uniform, she headed downstairs to greet her son. <br />
<br />
Jimmy sat on the couch, watching sports as she came down. &quot;Hey, mom.&quot; He greeted with a smile. &quot;Afternoon, Jimmy.&quot; She cheerily said in his voice. Seeing her son with a mature female body, dressed in revealing clothes and outrageous shoes was not out of the ordinary for her. It was always how he dressed his body from what she remembered. So, she quickly made him pasta for dinner and stepped out to the car, making sure to take the remote and manual with her, in case she wanted to use it at work. Jimmy held back a smirk as she walked away, giving him plenty of time to have many more female orgasms all night.</p>
