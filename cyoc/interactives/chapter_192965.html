<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You do need to use the lavatory, of course, but you&#39;re one of those people that almost <i>has</i> to have something to read while doing so.  You almost grab the magazine but...something about it just turns you away.  The bottle marked &quot;Skunk Lotion&quot; though is too intriguing to pass up.  Why...in the name of all that&#39;s reasonable...is skunk lotion?  Lotion for skunks?  Lotion that smells like skunks?  Lotion invented by a guy <i>named</i> skunk?<br />
<br />
As you set down and begin to work things out, you read the bottle.  It&#39;s hand lotion apparently.  The bottle doesn&#39;t at all explain why someone would want skunk-scented hand lotion, but a quick sniff indicates that it isn&#39;t even particularly skunk-scented.  So you&#39;re unsure on what makes this lotion skunkish, probably some marketing ploy.   You shrug and wipe a little bit on your hands anyway and start rubbing the stuff in.  Heck you&#39;re already trespassing in someone&#39;s home and using their toilet so you may as well use their weird hand lotion as well.<br />
<br />
The stuff turns out to be more difficult to rub off then you anticipated.  After several minutes of rubbing you still feel like the stuff is on your hands.  You even spread some on your thighs and wipe some on your gut and you still manage to get some on your tush when you&#39;re wiping up and flushing.  You&#39;re about to wash your hands when you hear a pounding on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re in there!&quot; calls a female voice with a noticeable southern drawl.  <i>Crud</i> you think to yourself.  There&#39;s no windows in the bathroom, or at least none you can crawl through.  You have precious little choice but to face the music.  You take a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry...it&#39;s just I was in a park and I got lost and...&quot; you stammer out a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and you thought you&#39;d come into my house and use my bathroom?  Who raised you, pirates?&quot; she responds angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know, I&#39;m sorry.  I didn&#39;t take anything I just used the bathroom and - oh my god!&quot; as you open the door, what you were expecting to be a woman is most certainly not.  Well not a human one anyway.  She does have a female frame, and quiet a shapely one at that.  Slightly plump but noticeably well endowed.  But her skin is covered with black fur with white in certain areas, such as on the torso and with a stripe of white on the head.  Her face, isn&#39;t quiet human either, baring more of a resemblance to a skunk.  The large black tail with a pair of white stripes running down the length of it definitely tells you that this woman is an anthropomorphic skunk.  An angry one at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you look here, mister, I don&#39;t know where you think you get off.&quot; she says and pokes a finger into your chest.  She pauses for a moment as her skunk-like nose begins sniffing your general area.  Her demeanor changes abruptly as a sly smile crosses her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You used more then my bathroom, didn&#39;t ya?&quot; she asks<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; you ask, still somewhat in shock at the half-woman/half-skunk before you.<br />
<br />
&quot;My lotion.&quot; she says, still with that smile &quot;I can smell it on ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Yeah, sorry, I used a little.&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then I&#39;m actually very happy to see you.&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh,&quot; you say &quot;well again I&#39;m sorry I intruded.  I&#39;ll leave right now.  Sorry.&quot; you say.  In response she place her hands on either side of the threshold, blocking you from leaving.  Her eyes narrow and her smile takes on a slightly leering quality.  She shakes her head slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no no no, sweetie, we can&#39;t have that.  You entered my home unannounced and uninvited, you intruder you.&quot;  She says sweet-but-scolding tone &quot;Now you owe me something in return and I want the pleasure of your company.&quot; you begin to reply but she quickly interrupts &quot;Now now, I&#39;m not taking no for an answer, sweetie, now you just come with me.&quot; she grabs you by the wrists and pulls you out of the bathroom and tugs you into what appears to be a study.  Her demeanor is very friendly now, but her grip on you is so tight that it&#39;s actually making your fingers tingle slightly.  She sits down on a comfortable looking loveseat and practically forces you into the seat next to her.  Her large fluffy tail rests against your back, which she doesn&#39;t seem to mind.  In fact the way the end of her tail rests over your shoulder, you&#39;d say she encourages it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.  What shall we talk about?&quot; she says.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; you begin but she quickly interupts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t we talk about what&#39;s happening to your hands?&quot; she says eagerly.  Confused, you look at your hands.  You gasp as you see that your hands are thicker and covered with black fur.  She smiles at your reaction and places her own hands against yours, showing that they&#39;re a match for hers.  You try several times to speak, but the shock is to great for you to do much more than stammer.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could also talk about how any part of your body that lotion touched, is going to start changing as soon as my sexy skunky body touches it.&quot; she says.  You try to stand but she quickly grabs you by the wrists before you can.  Her tail coils around you as she pulls you into a tight embrace.  Her hands trail down your back and down towards your...oh no.<br />
<br />
She slides her hands under your jeans and beneath your underwear.  As soon and she touches your tailbone a bulge begins to form.  The bulge begins growing longer and furrier.  It&#39;s not long before your new skunk-tail is pushing against your jeans.  You hear the sound of ripping fabric and popping stiches just before the tail rips through your trousers and boxer-briefs.  Your thighs begin changing slightly where the lotion touched them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, how ever did you get lotion there?&quot; she giggles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look the stuff sticks to your hands like those Cheeto dust, alright?  It got on a lot of places.&quot; you say struggling to escape the skunk-woman&#39;s affections.  She&#39;s having none of it of course.  She wraps her legs around your waist and tightens her grip on your back.  Your whole body is now pressed firmly against the very warm, friendly and increasingly sexy skunk anthro.  She giggles again when she realizes how aroused you&#39;ve become.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop struggling, sweetie, the damage is done.  You may as well enjoy it.  I can tell ya want to.&quot; she whispers into your ear.  You admit to yourself she has a point.  You grind against her, almost involuntarily.  It&#39;s all the encouragement she needs.  She helps you slide yourself into her.  Her warm and wet walls clench your manhood nearly as tightly as her arms and legs are.  You begin thrusting into her with sudden wild abandon.  The concerns melt away with any lingering inhibitions you may have had.  Her moans and cries inspire you that much more and before you know it you feel the sudden pressure and subsequent release as you climax with her still wrapped entirely around you.  You both pant with the exertion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Atta boy.&quot; she says as the afterglow takes you both.  She stands up and takes you by the hand, guiding you to one of the bedrooms.  A quick snuggling session later and you&#39;re fast asleep.  You&#39;re not sure how long you&#39;ve been out, but it&#39;s well into the evening when you do.  Through the dim light you can see her straddling you.  Her hands caressing your chest.  Your much furrier chest.  You bolt upright in bed and look at your body.  It&#39;s covered entirely in black and white fur.  She smiles and wiggles the bottle of skunk lotion with a triumphant smile on her face.  Rolling out of bed you rush to the mirror.  Even through the darkness you can tell that you&#39;re entirely transformed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...&quot; you begin to say, but you can&#39;t bring yourself to finish the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re mine, honey.&quot; she says and rolls out of bed herself and wraps her hands around you.  She rests her head on your shoulder.  &quot;I&#39;ve been lonely in this house all by myself.  I&#39;m gonna love having a husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
You should be terrified, but just her being near makes it difficult to think of anything but more sex.</p>
