<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Less than a week had passed since Madam Illusia had stolen Aaron&#39;s manhood and given it to Kyle. Since then, Kyle&#39;s growth has been astounding, making Aaron feel like a pathetic pipsqueak.  Today was no different. <br />
<br />
Aaron woke up just before his alarm and slowly got out of bed. He would normally have an early morning wank at this time, but since he was stuck with Kyle&#39;s tiny cock and balls, he couldn&#39;t even get hard anymore and had no sex drive. He shuffled out of bed and walked to the shared bathroom, but he found the door locked. He heard deep grunting and moaning in the bathroom, with some soft slapping noises too. Gross, Kyle was beating off AGAIN. How many times was Kyle beating off, it seemed like that was all he ever did! Aaron went back to his room to wait for his bigger, little brother to finish up. A few minutes later he heard a deep grunt, louder than the rest, and the door open. Aaron waited until his brother was back in his room; he didn&#39;t want to run into him and give him the opportunity to tease him about his small body. <br />
<br />
As he slunk into the bathroom, he was disgusted by what he saw. The bathroom trash can was overflowing with used tissues, and the whole room smelled like cum. Gross! Kyle was turning into a hormonal beast! How much was he beating off at this point?! He figured he must have more hormones than usual, with his own hormones and the ones he stole from Aaron. Aaron ignored his disgust and stepped into the shower.<br />
<br />
After his shower, Aaron got dressed and ready for school and went down to the breakfast table. He was hoping to avoid Kyle, but unfortunately, he was sitting at the breakfast table, wearing a white tank top and baggy gym shorts. Aaron gasped as he saw his brother, sitting down next to him in silence and shame. His brother has incredibly thick sandpapery brown stubble on his face, which was currently shoveling in food an at alarming rate. Kyle had clearly grown again, overnight. He was at least a few inches taller and he had gained about 15 or 20 pounds of muscle. He almost looked like a high school senior, if not a college aged student! Aaron saw that Kyle now had long dark brown hairs all along his forearm, which were starting to be covered in thick veins. They hairs and the veins led up to his large, defined biceps. His impressive muscles were on full display since he was wearing a tank top. As he shoveled food into his mouth, Aaron also spied flashes of incredibly hairy bushes of pit hair under his kid brothers arms! Even with Kyle&#39;s arms down, dark curly hairs still stuck out visible from the bush. His brother was going through puberty at an alarming rate at this point! Not only that, there was a heavy, musky scent that filled the room. It smelled a bit like BO. Kyle was starting to smell a bit.<br />
<br />
Kyle saw his &quot;little&quot; brother sit down next to him. He turned and flashed a cocky grin; &quot;Hey bro&quot;, Kyle grunted. Holy shit, his voice was so deep now! Aaron saw a huge adam&#39;s apple sticking out from his kid brother&#39;s throat now! With Kyle turned towards Aaron, he saw a ton of thick brown hairs curling over the top of the white tank top on his brother&#39;s chest. Holy Shit! His brother had seemingly grown a rug of chest hair overnight! the hairs were thick, long, dark, and curly. Aaron was at a loss of words at the sight. &quot;H.... H.... Hey, K... Kyle....&quot;, he meekly sputtered out. Kyle just grinned, seeing how pathetic and sheepish his brother was acting. Kyle theatrically started to scratch the thick forest on his chest, obviously showing off to Aaron. &quot;Oh wow, my chest is so itchy today for some reason....&quot;, Kyle muttered. Aaron was transfixed at the fingers raking through the thick chest hair. Aaron was burning with jealousy, and felt totally emasculated. His brother was so huge and hairy and masculine, and here he was stuck in the tiny pathetic boyish body. He should be the bigger brother! This wasn&#39;t fair! His brother saw Aaron flushed with envy and he just chuckled. He raised one of his muscular arms and slowly scratched his armpit. Aaron tried not to look, but it was obvious he was transfixed. Kyle scratched the heavy bush in his pit nonchalantly. With his arm up, Aaron was yet again hit by his &quot;little&quot; brother&#39;s powerful stink. Fuck, his brother stunk like a locker room! He would have to try to get Kyle to wear some deodorant from now on. Kyle put his arm down and focused his attention on eating more and more of the breakfast food.<br />
<br />
Kyle let out a huge, loud burp as soon as he was finished. He pushed his chair way and stood up. He stretched himself up to his full height. &quot;Oh my god&quot;, Aaron thought to himself; &quot;He must be 6 and a half feet tall at this point!&quot;. Kyle saw his meek little brother staring up at him with awe and a little bit of fear. Kyle loved how big he was getting, and he felt himself get a little bit hard in his gym shorts. Getting a bit turned on showing off his new body, he theatrically stretched his arms up towards the ceiling, almost grazing his fingers against the top. His tight tank top rode up his stomach a bit, showing off his defined abs. Aaron could see a very thick rope of hair leading up from his waistband all the way to his belly button and higher. The brown hairs were all over his brother&#39;s stomach! And they were thick, too! Not only that, his boxers and gym shorts were sagging a bit, showing off a bunch of brown hairs too thick and curly to be anything but the start of Aaron&#39;s pubes. Gross!<br />
<br />
With Kyle stretching and Aaron still seated, Aaron could see he was face to face and level with another recent development of his brother&#39;s; he was only inches away from the huge crotch bulge in his kid brother&#39;s shorts! The bulge was huge, and the gym shorts left nothing up to the imagination. Kyle&#39;s thick shaft was plainly visible, hanging a thick and soft 7 inches down. Likewise, the two lemon sized balls were clear to see, with the mesh shorts hugging them. Kyle saw Aaron gawking at his massive manhood, and decided to show off a bit more. He reached his hands down his short and began to scratch his balls. Aaron saw that Kyle had seen him peeking; he flushed a bright red and looked away.<br />
<br />
With that, Kyle turned to go back upstairs. As Aaron heard the heavy footfalls of his brother as he climbed the stairs, he knew he had to do something; this was getting out of hand!</p>
