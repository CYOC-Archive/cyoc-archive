<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave looked at Chris, startled.  "What do you mean?  That <i>is</i> my name...  David Isaac Keene."<br /><br />

The words in the center of the board swirled again, becoming mist once more before forming the new words,<blockquote><i>"No longer..."</i></blockquote>

The slender student hung his head and sighed, closing his eyes.  "Not your full, birth name..." he replied, sadly.  "Oh, God, there's no telling what's going to happen now..."<br /><br />

Tyler pounded his fist against the card table, making the pieces and dice jump.  "But ... but that's not fair!" he shouted, angrily.  "Chris, what can we..."<br /><br />

"Look:  it's started."<br /><br />

Sid's quiet, leonine voice almost went unheard against Tyler's outburst but all eyes turned to Dave.<br /><br />

A wave of heat traveled through him accompanied by a ripple of pure emotion.  It was like stepping into a sauna; the sheer passion of existence inundated Dave's will and mind as he could literally feel the emotions of the other three in the room.  "Oh, God," he moaned, half-closing his eyes.  "This ... this is ... <i>incredible</i>..."<br /><br />

The others could only stare and watch.  As Dave leaned back in his chair, his University sweatshirt began to slowly pull tight across his shoulders and his hair began to darken from its normal light brown towards something darker.  Twin bumps started to grow from his forehead, looking like budding horns.  His skin grew more golden in color, deepening in its shade to an inhuman tone.  Even his eyes, mostly hidden by his largely-closed lids, began to swim in an inhuman color.  The whites began to change to an iridescent lavender, swallowing up his normal, brown eyes and a sea of solid hue.<br /><br />

"What ... what's happening to him?" stammered Chris.<br /><br />

"Don't you know?" asked Tyler, standing up and starting to head around the table.<br /><br />

Chris looked helpless and shook his head.  "Hey, I only study myth; I don't know anything about the real thing...!"<br /><br />

Dave continued to change.  He could feel the eruption of the black, glossy horns from his forehead as if an orgasmic burst.  In front of his eyes, he could see every color of the spectrum suddenly radiate out from his forehead and inundate the world.  He moaned, moving his hands to his crotch and rubbing himself lewdly through the fabric of his jeans.<br /><br />

"Is it just me or are his clothes getting tighter?" asked Sid, his lion-like body having not changed its mass one bit.<br /><br />

Tyler walked around Dave and nodded.  "And that's not all..." he said.<br /><br />

The others suddenly stared as Tyler pulled out his pocket knife and flipped out the largest blade.<br /><br />

"Tyler!"<br /><br />

"STOP!  DAVE!"<br /><br />

Both Chris and Sid, stunned by the sudden action, could do little as Tyler made a swift, sudden stabbing motion down along Dave's back.<br /><br />

A rip of cloth could be heard and both men sitting next to Dave half-expected to see a spray of blood erupt over Tyler.  Instead, however, Sid's roommate merely groaned in relief and pitched forward, leaning against the table.  No longer massaging his groin, his hands clutched the edge of the gameboard as -to the startled eyes of Chris and Sid- a large pair of black bat wings unfurled from their friends' back and expanded into the room.<br /><br />

Tyler jumped back to avoid them, each one having a wicked barb on its tip.  Still scowling, he circled around behind Chris and headed back to where he'd been sitting.<br /><br />

"It's a demon," Sid said, unnecessarily.  "He's turning into a ... a demon."<br /><br />

By now, the tight-fitting sweat shirt and jeans that Dave had been wearing had burst several seams and the formerly five-foot-ten student was a looming, seven feet tall!  His skin was a rich, burnished gold in color and his hair had darkened to deepest black.  Long, cascading waves of hair ran down past his shoulders to the middle of his back and his body, now toned and muscled like an Olympic swimmer, shivered as the transformation came to an end.  Slowly, his lavender eyes opened and a faint glow emanated from them, casting a faint, eerie shadow across his own face.  From his forehead now stood twin, glossy black horns; slightly curved and rising about two feet above the top of his head, each one ended in a sharp barbed tip.<br /><br />

"Well," came Dave's voice, low and sensuous.  "Maybe this game ain't so bad after all..."<br /><br />

From behind their friend, a long, spade-tipped tail rose, poking up through the waist band of his jeans.  The new demon looked at his friends and smiled, sharp, pointed canines framing his alluring and powerfully supernatural smile.  "What's wrong, boys?"<br /><br />

Chris couldn't say anything.  Even though he'd been screwing around occasionally with Dave for a month or two, the expression on his face told the tale:  he was completely bewitched by the supernaturally handsome man sitting next to him.  Sid, too, couldn't say anything.  His leonine muzzle hung open as he stared at the tall, adonis-like demon to his left.<br /><br />

"Guys?"<br /><br />

"Dave," said Tyler, sighing.  "Look in the mirror."<br /><br />

A confused look came over his face (nearly breaking the hearts of the men watching him, to see something so beautiful, become confused or perplexed.  Rising, the demon crossed the room and looked into the full-length mirror he and Sid had installed outside their bedroom when they'd moved in.<br /><br />

His eyes grew wide.<br /><br />

"That ... that's me...?"  His voice rumbled in a deep, resonating pitch that carried the promise of lust and satisfaction to all who heard it.  He shivered at the sound of it and stared back at the others.  "What ... what am I?"<br /><br />

Tyler looked away, trying to focus on anything but his friend's blinding beauty.  "If I don't miss my guess, you've become an Incubus ... the male form of a Succubus."<br /><br />

Chris nodded, still staring.  "A demon that ... that sucks out the souls of sleeping mortals by ... by sleeping with them..."<br /><br />

"Dave, you don't feel anything ...unusual... do you?" asked Tyler, cautiously.<br /><br />

The demon looked confused again.  "Uh, who are you talking to, Tyler?" he asked, looking around.  "My name's...  Uh..."  He trailed off, the truth of the situation dawning on him.  "Oh, my God...  My name...  What ... what's my name?!"<br /><br />

Sid rose and crossed over to the former human.  Chris, likewise, leaped up and joined him, both men reaching the Incubus at the same time and putting their arms on his shoulders.<br /><br />

"Look, you'll be Ok..." Chris said, "I'll watch out for you..."<br /><br />

Sid snarled at Chris, seeing his friend -for some reason- as the grasping, sexually compulsive boytoy that he'd always been but they'd always forgiven.  "Knock it off, Chris; I'll take care of Dave..."<br /><br />

"That's not his name anymore; he needs someone who knows about these things..."<br /><br />

"Oh," snarled the lion, "and that means you, I guess..."<br /><br />

"Well, who better?"<br /><br />

"I'll tell you who better..." said Sid, tugging on the Incubus' arm.  "Me.  That's who!"<br /><br />

Chris' face darkened in a glower.  "Oh, I'd like to see you try, <i>Simba</i>..."<br /><br />

"Boys...?"<br /><br />

Sid and Chris ignored Tyler's voice and continued their argument.<br /><br />

"Look, just because you suck his dick every night doesn't give you exclusive rights to his ... companionship!"<br /><br />

"Oh, no...  But who'd want to fuck a reject from a 'Meow-Mix' commercial anyway?  Not him!"<br /><br />

The Incubus looked at each of his friends, the full impact of his new form dawning on him.  Desperately, he brushed them off and tried to back away towards his chair.  "Look, Sid ... Chris; you're not making any sense.  I...I'll be fine..."<br /><br />

"BOYS!"  Again, Tyler's cry went unnoticed.<br /><br />

A look of sheer bliss came over Chris' face as he listened to his One True Love's melodic voice.  Looking at the Incubus, it felt as if his heart would burst through his chest as the towering, male God spoke to him.  "Oh, don't worry yourself, hon...  I'll take care of you ... I promise!"<br /><br />

"Take care of his dick you mean," snarled Sid, grabbing Chris and pulling the smaller man away from the demon.  "You're so transparent!"<br /><br />

"Oh, like you're not?!"  Chris jerked his arm away and half-crouched, curling up his hands into fists.  "Let's see if you really are 'King of the Beasts'!"<br /><br />

"Bring it on, boytoy..." the lion snarled, baring both claws and fangs...<br /><br />

"GUYS; MY PIECE MOVED!"<br /><br />

This time all three of the others in the room turned to look at Tyler.  Each of them, even the nameless Incubus, stared.  The dice, having been jostled when Tyler slammed his fists into the table were now on a "1" and a "2".  His piece, having moved three spaces, had landed on a red square which now had the word "RANDOM" on it.<br /><br />

In fact, were the others to examine the board more carefully, they'd see that all of the red spaces were now labeled "RANDOM".  However, they were too busy staring at Tyler.<br /><br />

"We...we'd swapped chairs after we picked our pieces," he said, looking at Chris.  "When I ... I smacked the table, it counted it as a roll..."  In the center of the board, the words had re-formed, this time reading:<blockquote><i><b>TEMPORARY CHANGE<br />
- 3 turns -</b><br /><br />

"As so you fear, so shall you be;<br />
The bitterness and fighting, they sting.<br />
'Tis true, the quarrel shall may them free,<br />
But at your expense, this change shall be."</i></blockquote>

And, beyond a doubt, Tyler was changing...</p>
