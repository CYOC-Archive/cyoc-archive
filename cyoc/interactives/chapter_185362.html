<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">George and his partner (Matthew had forgotten her name) returned. The female George must have had a good night. She had a smile on her face. She was still unsteady on her feet. Matthew guessed practising walking in her heels had not been high on her agenda for the last 3 hours. They bought a swap Scotch and Matthew gave them keys to a room.<br />
<br />
Jake returned. Matthew had learnt he was the duty manager and he spent time in the various bars in the establishment (there were other rooms that only sold conventional drinks in the hotel). He suggested to Matthew that she should start cleaning up. Evidently after 2 am they were unlikely to get too many new customers. <br />
<br />
So between serving drinks Matthew had to visit unoccupied tables, pick up empty glasses and rubbish then wipe the tables down. As she was doing so she kept an eye on the time. She began to despair that Sabrina was not coming back.<br />
<br />
The lesbian couple returned to the bar and enquired whether the ‘Gentleman’ Matthew had spoken about earlier was returning. All Matthew could answer was “I hope so”. The girls ordered another drink each.<br />
<br />
At 2.37 Sabrina returned. She seemed pleased with herself and gave Matthew a thumbs up as she made her way to the bar. It seemed the lesbian couple had noticed his entry as well. They promptly returned to the bar before Matthew could ask whether Sabrina’s errand had been successful. <br />
<br />
It was Stacey, the femme who spoke first. She spoke to Sabrina “Are you the gentleman who Sabrina spoke about? Who is willing to swap with Megan for the night?”<br />
<br />
“Um…..” She looked at Matthew with a puzzled look on his face “I guess so”<br />
<br />
“I’m Stacey and this is Megan. We are so grateful. We’ll pay for the drinks and even give you a bonus” With that Stacey pulled a roll of notes from her purse. “There’s $2000 dollars here. We have been saving for this for a while. You can keep the change”<br />
<br />
Megan spoke up. “We were beginning to get worried you wouldn’t return. It’s tonight or never” She had a pleading look on her face.<br />
<br />
Again Sabrina just looked at Matthew. “Umm … Maybe. Could I have a private word with Sabrina?”<br />
<br />
“Sure. We’ll return to our table” the two women left, returning to their table at the back of the room”<br />
<br />
As soon as they were out of earshot Sabrina asked Matthew “What’s the deal?’<br />
<br />
Matthew replied “We swap back. Then I’ll use that money to swap with the butch girl. Even when I swap back again I’ll be way in front”<br />
<br />
“That won’t work. The bar is closing soon. If you swap with me then it will be another 3 hours before you can swap again. The girls won’t be getting what they want tonight”<br />
<br />
“Oh I hadn’t thought of that”<br />
<br />
“The only way this could work is if you stay as Sabrina for the night. I can do the swap with the girl now. I swap back with her as soon as the bar re-opens tomorrow. Then 3 hours later you and me can return to our proper bodies. Does that make sense to you? It will actually work out better as I’m not working tomorrow and we wouldn’t have to hide that we are swapping”<br />
<br />
“Um what time does the bar reopen?”<br />
<br />
“Mid-day on Saturday’s. It’s my day off. So sometime after 3 tomorrow you would have this body back. That would suit me as I have concert tickets for tomorrow night”<br />
<br />
“Well I have to admit I wouldn’t mind time in this body while I’m not working. If the girls can promise to be back here when the bar re-opens tomorrow that would be okay with me” <br />
<br />
“Watch out here come’s Jake. I guess he wants to call last drinks. I’ll go and talk to the girls” Sabrina went across to the girl’s table.<br />
<br />
Jake did want to call last drinks, or more specifically he wanted the person who he thought was Sabrina to let the remaining patrons know the bar was closing in 15 minutes. So Matthew spent the next several minutes going around the room, informing each of the tables.<br />
<br />
By the time Matthew returned to the bar a queue had formed. Sabrina was third in line.<br />
<br />
Jake had remained at the bar and was serving the first in line.<br />
<br />
Matthew nodded to Sabrina to indicate she would serve him but the couple second in line moved across to her. They wanted a Swap Scotch. The ‘man’ chatted to Matthew as she processed their order. Evidently they had swapped bodies as soon as the bar had opened earlier in the day and had spent the evening going to the theatre as each other. It was their anniversary. <br />
<br />
By the time Matthew had given them a key to a change room. Jake was already serving Sabrina, Megan was at Sabrina’s side. Matthew could not listen to the conversation as another couple were also ordering a last drink. At least this time it was just a couple of rum and cokes. Matthew could only watch out of the corner of her eye as Megan downed a pink drink and Sabrina a blue. They took a key and retreated to a change room.<br />
<br />
Matthew cleared the queue of waiting customers then at Jake’s command began to clean up and lock up the bar. While Jake took on the task of cleaning up the ‘Swap Scotch machine’ and clearing the till, Matthew had to wipe down the benches and lock the conventional drinks away behind a grill. She was still completing this task when Sabrina and Megan returned. Well they returned to the table Stacey was at. The lesbian couple detoured via the bar as they left, thanking ‘Sabrina’ (Matthew) for helping arrange the swap. Matthew couldn&#39;t help but notice the bulge in the front of Megan’s dress. She guessed Megan was rather excited about the rest of the night and didn’t know how to hide that fact.<br />
<br />
Sabrina, still in the guise of ‘Matthew’ but apparently missing a vital part, not that it was noticeable, also came via the bar. “I’ll wait for you in the foyer” It was now right on 3 am and all the patrons were leaving.</p>
