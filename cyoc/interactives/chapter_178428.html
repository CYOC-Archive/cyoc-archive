<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke was thrilled by the time he was seated back at his desk, he kept having to brush his hand against his crotch to confirm that the change was real. Luckily this action was hidden due to the way he sat, but it was keeping him in an uncomfortable state of half-erection. He couldn&#39;t wait to get home and give his new tool a work out.<br />
<br />
Dennis was still acting like himself though. The loss of his cock didn&#39;t do anything for his cockiness. With his pitch black hair swept back, bright green eyes, and gym-toned body he was still attractive enough to all the women in the office that he was still acting like the king of the roost. Hell, Luke might have slept with Dennis if he wasn&#39;t sure the man was as straight as a broom handle. He just wanted to knock the guy off his throne.<br />
<br />
Stealing his body completely was the most obvious answer, but didn&#39;t appeal much to Luke in the moment. Muscles would be nice but that also didn&#39;t feel like exactly the right answer. The right one did come when he almost ran over Keith outside Luke&#39;s cubicle. &quot;Sorry, Keith, didn&#39;t see you down there.&quot; Dennis said with his usual mocking tone. Keith was the shortest guy in the office at 5&#39;8&quot; which wasn&#39;t terrible but Dennis&#39; 6&#39;2&quot; made it obvious.<br />
<br />
He needed to cut Dennis down to size. He could copy his own height onto him, but his own 5&#39;11&quot; didn&#39;t seem enough. Maybe he could copy Keith then swap with Dennis. No, that still wasn&#39;t enough. Then a though passed through his head. &quot;Why was he only considering men?&quot; He looked across the aisle to one of his office friends. Valerie was a kind young woman with a chipper personality and one of the few in the office who didn&#39;t give in to Dennis&#39; charm. Mostly because she was in a happy relationship with her girlfriend. She was also a rather unassuming 5&#39;2&quot;. A whole foot. It was perfect.<br />
<br />
Luke picked up a can of nuts he kept on his desk for snacking, popped the lid and ate a few. Then he stuck it out into the hallway towards Valerie&#39;s cube. &quot;Nuts?&quot; He offered, trying to sound like he wasn&#39;t up to something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank god, something to distract me from the candy bar in my desk.&quot; She responded, reaching out to take a few from the can. Luke positioned his finger to brush her hand as she got her share and thought of copying her height. &quot;Thanks, Luke.&quot; She smiled at him and went back to her work.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t even notice he was changing right in front of her. His whole body seemed to need to adjust as he suddenly lost nine inches in height. He stayed pretty much the same build as he had before, nothing else about him really altering, so a little smaller in width as well to keep proportion, but the change was seamless. Even his clothes adjusted to the change right away, retailoring themselves to fit his new proportions. He had to use his hand to check between his legs through the fabric of his trousers. That was unchanged, and actually felt even bigger now compared to his smaller self.<br />
<br />
Now for part two. He grabbed his empty coffee cup to make his way into the break room the moment he saw Dennis making his way over there. Luke got to his feet, finding the new perspective very odd. He hadn&#39;t been this height since middle school. Something about it almost made him feel like a kid again, or maybe it was just that he was playing pranks.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it isn&#39;t shorty!&quot; Dennis&#39; annoying mocking tone greeted him as he entered the break room, the two of them being the only ones inside for now. It was nice to know people really didn&#39;t seem to notice the changes, the fact that he walked by three desks with no comment on his new shorter stature was proof enough if Dennis&#39; jibe hadn&#39;t been.<br />
<br />
He stepped up beside Dennis to pour coffee. &quot;Bet I got a bigger dick though.&quot; He muttered under his breath, just loud enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;What as that?&quot; Dennis sounded, well, like Luke hit a sore spot. Someone&#39;s not as confident in his manhood anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pass the creamer?&quot; Luke said, like that was what he had originally said. Dennis grabbed the bottle and thrust it towards Luke in annoyance. He made sure his fingers came in contact with Dennis&#39; fingers as he took it and poured. This time focusing on swapping heights instead of copying.<br />
<br />
He turned and walked out of the breakroom, already feeling his stride lengthening. It was awkward keeping his pace steady as he shot up a whole foot in height in a matter of seconds, giving him a moment of vertigo as he had to adjust perspective. He could resist a look back over his shoulder to Dennis who was now stretching to reach something in one of the top cabinets of the break room kitchenette.<br />
<br />
Luke took his seat with a smile, his chair already adjusted once more to fit his new height. It wasn&#39;t much more than he had before, but watching Dennis scurry back to his own desk on shorter legs made it worth it. As the day passed he noticed Dennis really wasn&#39;t quite the king of the office that he once was. Sure, he still was good looking, and had a nice body, but make him one of the two shortest people in the office and, well, in the business world perception really is everything. Dennis just wouldn&#39;t have a chance with the ladies. Some guys Luke knew would find a short, cute guy an irresistible bottom, and suddenly, he had to wonder.<br />
<br />
The bracelet could do physical attributes, did sexuality count? Some said it was partially genetic.<br />
<br />
Luke sat at his desk working on some projects he hadn&#39;t gotten to today due to playing around with the bracelet, trying to be the last one to leave. Dennis finally got up from his desk and grabbed his stuff to leave. &quot;Dennis.&quot; Luke said as the short man walked by his desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke..&quot; He sounded unsure, though did come to a stop, looking at him suspiciously.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, since I started working here I know we got off on the wrong foot. I want to say, maybe for sake of work environment, I&#39;m going to try to be.. better.&quot; It hurt Luke to say those words, but he knew it might play to Dennis ego. &quot;You know. Try to work together better.&quot; Then he held out his hand for a handshake.<br />
<br />
Dennis squinted at him. &quot;I guess I can be a little, difficult. Fine, for office harmony.&quot; He took the hand to give it a shake. At the contact Luke focused on copying his own sexuality onto Dennis. Too bad there would be no physical signs that it actually worked. Though, did that awkward handshake suddenly ease and maybe linger just a bit too long. Or when Dennis headed to the elevator and looked back at Luke, was it less confusion and more.. something else?<br />
<br />
Luke was probably imagining it. He finally packed up to go himself, thinking of how he would spend his evening, or rather, what he would do with the bracelet this evening.</p>
