<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A week later...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not really sure what to do with Kai.  It seems like he has forgotten about who he was, what he became and the maker.&quot;  Jae told Park as they boarded home after school.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a good thing...I guess...but don&#39;t forget how he punked us.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love your little brother, I really do, but what he did was messed up.  He let his drive to win control him to the point that he changed us into different people.  And what he did to the twins...well that&#39;s really fucked up.  They haven&#39;t said anything about it so I don&#39;t know if they remember.  He needs to be watched.  I just wanted to let you know I&#39;ve been doing that.  Before you say something, listen to me.  You are the leader of this crew, you brought us together so understand when I tell you the only time I ever touched the program was when you emailed it to me.  After that I never touched it.  You&#39;re the only one who knows about my copy.  If he ever touches the program again, it will alert us, especially if he makes changes&quot;  Park said anxiously, not sure how Jae would react.<br />
<br />
Jae abruptly stopped and thought for a minute, as Park backtracked to where Jae had stopped; suddenly Jae grinned &quot;That&#39;s genius dude!  I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got everyone&#39;s back.&quot; He grabbed Park pulling him for a passionate kiss.  &quot;That&#39;s why  I love you.&quot;  He gave Park a kiss on the cheek and then started skating.  Park stood there for a moment, blinked and realized what happened as Jae yelled for him to hurry up.<br />
<br />
As they rounded the corner, they saw a member of the marching band getting beat up.  The bully was kicking him while shouting and calling him a faggot.<br />
<br />
Without thinking, Park yelled &quot;What the hell?!?&quot; as he threw himself into the fray.  He recognized the bully as Bobby Keller, who was on the football team.  Despite the damage to his shirt, Park held his own, finally getting a good punch in the face that caused Bobby to tumble back and fall on his ass.  &quot;You&#39;d be wise to remember that THIS faggot just mopped the floor with your ass.  You got some problems Bobby, I don&#39;t know if its because of some inferiority complex related to your tiny dick, or you&#39;re just in denial about how badly you want to suck cock!&quot;  Bobby got to his feet and popped them the finger as he limped away, mumbling under his breath.<br />
<br />
This was a side of Park that Jae had rarely seen.  Ever since he got picked on in elementary school, his dad had enrolled him in boxing lessons and tae kwon do to defend himself.  He was one of the smallest kids, then in middle school and high school he got a growth spurt.   In both middle and high school he either defended himself or others, including Jae, against some bullies.  Jae found this side of Park so sexy, that he started to get hard.<br />
Jae then extended to help the kid up. &quot;You ok?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah...I&#39;m ok...its pretty routine.&quot;  he said<br />
&quot;That&#39;s terrible...nothing like that should be routine.  what&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
&quot;Conrad&quot; he said meekly.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Jae and Rocky over there is my boyfriend Park.&quot;<br />
He looked over at Park and responded &quot;Thanks...I appreciate your help but he&#39;ll be back tomorrow and probably more pissed.  Its been like this since third grade.  I tried everything to fit in - first my dad enrolled me in pee wee football, that only made things worse because I sucked at the sport; then he enrolled me in karate - same thing.&quot; <br />
&quot;Wow!  I&#39;m sorry to hear that.  That fuckin awful.&quot; Jae said angry.<br />
&quot;Thanks for trying though...wait aren&#39;t you guys on the soccer team?&quot; he suddenly asked.<br />
&quot;Yeah...how did you know?&quot; Jae responded curiously.<br />
&quot;Sometimes marching band has practice at the same time near where you practice, sometimes I will watch just to escape...thanks again&quot; he grabbed his trombone and book bag, walking away, head down like usual.<br />
&quot;This is terrible.  This kid, probably 14 or 15, has been beat down by the world at such a young age.&quot;  Jae said.  He then pulled Park over and kissed him.  &quot;That was so damn sexy...and I&#39;ll have to thank Bobby for ripping your shirt in all the right places.  You&#39;re my hero...I&#39;ll reward you when we get home&quot; Jae whispered into Park&#39;s ear, licking it.<br />
He then pulled out the maker, saying &quot;it doesn&#39;t look like its going to get better for him anytime soon.&quot;<br />
&quot;I feel for the kid...I really do.&quot;  Park said, cracking his knuckles.  &quot;But with everything that has happened, don&#39;t you think you should give it a rest?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nah....we&#39;re fine...unless you plan on losing your mind&quot; he laughed.<br />
<br />
The next day, things were pretty routine at school.  After school, the boys who played soccer gathered for practice.  The boys who watched, like Ty, Luca and Marco, gathered on the bleachers.  In the band room, Conrad struggled to get his trombone case open.  As he continued to struggle, sweat dripped down from his forehead.  After about 10 minutes, he grabbed the case and carried it outside, annoyed.  As he exited the band room he felt a jolt go through his body, causing him to drop his trombone.  Conrad tried to bend over to reach the instrument but just couldn&#39;t, it was like it was out of reach even though it was right there.  He became nervous and confused.  He felt his heart racing.  He tried to call out but couldn&#39;t move his mouth.  He began to swear more.  He felt it pouring down his face.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his trombone case changing.  His shoes suddenly felt roomy and realized he could wiggle his toes.  As he did so, the shoe began to fit much better.  What he didn&#39;t realize was his size 7 penny loafers had become size Adidas Adizero Fire and Ice Cleats.  Just as his feet grew, so had his body, from 5&#39;4 to 6&#39;0.  He also aged from 14 to 18.  His increase in height had allowed his body to distribute the fat slightly but he was still overweight.  His waist shrunk from a 42 to a 32, causing his marching band pants to pool at his feet.  Hi could feel his legs strengthen from years of running, playing lacrosse, swimming, surfing and skating.  He moaned in pleasure as his cock lengthen and thickened as his balls grew causing him to cum on himself and his clothes.  Then the fat in his stomach burned itself off until he had an admirable six pack to go with his Adonis belt.  His chest grew more muscular as did his back as it broadened.  At this point the shirt was on the floor in shreds.  His biceps grew to 17 in and his forearms thickened with muscle.  Conrad was confused.  It was like a dream.  Everything comes with a price, he could feel his face change and could see his skin change from a pale oily white to a golden brown.  His memories began conflicting.  Rather than growing up a chunky child, he was always active.  He fell in love with lacrosse in middle school, about the same time he also fell in love with skating, swimming and running.  He remembered going to a mosque with his family and the hatred he experienced.  He remembered moving with his family and being surprised when came to his family because of how supportive they were.  It was then that he met Jae through Ty.  Ever since they hung out together.  Hakeem picked up his lacrosse stick and headed out to the bleachers and wait for practice to start.</p>
