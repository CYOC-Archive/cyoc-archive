<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With people more worried about the coronavirus, there weren&#39;t as many new people wanting to go through conversion as there has been. Certain projects has slowed to a crawl, including Project Chimera. There didn&#39;t seem as many unusual animals to uplift, at least none that can be easily transported to Lyre. The latest feature developed by Project Chimera, the one that could give people 2 extra arms has not been in high demand. Quite likely, some people found the idea of extra arms too extreme, even by Animalian standards. But there is at least one variety of Animalian in which the extra arms seem to work best with. Since people would already be losing their legs by becoming snake Animalians, the idea of becoming a four-armed snake actually sounded rather appealing. In fact, there are a few snake Animalian who were wishing they had gotten the four-armed option. But since retroactive mutations seem about as likely as being able to revert to human form, that didn&#39;t seem like an option any time soon.<br />
<br />
The newest person to go for this package has caused a bit of a stir. He was one of the newest members of Project White Lily. Zak had once been a nerd with body image issues who went into bodybuilding to deal with them. However, his drive to get bigger drove him to cut corners, such as taking steroids to speed up results. When he was found out, he was blacklisted from professional bodybuilding circles, a tale pretty common in Project White Lily. However, what really compelled him to join Animalia was the fact that his steroid abuse had weakened his immunity system. And with Covid-19 running loose, he did not want to keep himself at risk. And since he was a fan of the naga races in Dungeons & Dragons, he wanted to become like them. But he wanted to be more exciting than just getting injected. He wanted something more fitting a fantasy theme. Fortunately, the currently only four-armed cobra was willing to play along.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t really expect a tarot reading involved in this,&quot; said Zak. Otherwise, things were shaping out like his fantasy pretty well. Madame Madge&#39;s apartment already had a supernatural vibe with her Indian-inspired decor. All that was really needed were the right costumes. That&#39;s why Zak was just wearing a loincloth right now and Madge looked like a shaman mystic, one that revealed a lot of skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bear with me,&quot; said Madge, &quot;This is outside of my comfort zone. And I&#39;m curious as to what the cards foretell for you.&quot; It was a bit hypnotic to watch Madge shuffle her cards between her four hands, when Zak&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t linger on her cleavage.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Madge placed a card face down in front of Zak. He picked it up and frowned at the sight of a skeleton rider on a pale horse. &quot;Death?&quot; he asked skeptically.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Death card is more of a symbol of change than actual death,&quot; said Madge wearily. People always jumped to the worst conclusions about the tarot. Plenty would mistake the darker cards like the Tower or the Hermit for death as well.<br />
<br />
When Zak picked up the next card, it was a much more pleasant image. It showed a woman holding a lion&#39;s head on her lap. &quot;Strength, eh?&quot; he asked, &quot;Well, it would match what I&#39;m aiming for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Strength card is more about inner strength than physical strength,&quot; said Madge, &quot;Self-control, courage, and virtue over brute force. I am a bit curious though. Why choose a four-armed serpent over others?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a unique look,&quot; said Zak, &quot;Besides, I want to see what kind of body I can build with four arms and the muscles that comes with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you do,&quot; said Madge before putting down the final card.<br />
<br />
Zak looked at it and raised his eyebrow. &quot;Well, well, look what we got here,&quot; he said as he showed her the picture of Adam and Eve on the Lovers card.<br />
<br />
Madge&#39;s face flushed, or it would if it could have. &quot;It doesn&#39;t mean what you think,&quot; she said, &quot;It could mean that you&#39;re at a crossroads with a choice to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it just my choice?&quot; asked Zak, &quot;This is also your decision. You could just convert me in a non-romantic way.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was true, but Madge found herself preferring a more intimate approach. She could just blame it on her enhanced libido and the fact that it&#39;s been years since she&#39;s been with a man. And Zak was a handsome man. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t presume this would make us mates for life,&quot; said Madge as she rubbed Zak&#39;s hips with one pair of hands while her other pair was starting to untie her bra, &quot;But I suppose you should be feeling some pleasure to counterbalance the pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pain?&quot; asked Zak, a bit nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your legs are going to be taken out of their sockets and attached to new shoulder blades,&quot; said Madge, &quot;I would imagine it would be quite discomforting. I had the benefit of astral projecting myself while my change was going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t know-&quot; started Zak but he lost his train of thought when Madge&#39;s breasts were bared. She had quite a respectable pair, perkier than most due to being supported by two pairs of pectoral muscles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Accept the pleasure, young warrior,&quot; said Madge as her lower hands started groping his groin, &quot;Strive through the pain to claim your reward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zak didn&#39;t need much more encouragement than that. He put his lips to one of Madge&#39;s nipples, noticing her scales gave it a noticeable texture. Her milk was not sweet, but nor was it bitter. It went down his throat pretty easily. He tried to take her advice and focus on the pleasure and not the upcoming discomfort.<br />
<br />
The feeling of his skin turning to scales wasn&#39;t so bad, nor of his hair falling out. He felt the difference as his mouth was starting to form a snake&#39;s muzzle, including the fangs. He tried to pay more attention to how his neck was extending and growing a hoot rather than how his hips started to ache. He bit down a bit when he felt his legs pop out of their hips sockets. Madge gave a hiss of pain at that. &quot;Sssorry,&quot; he hissed, his tongue already becoming forked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to focus more on the pleasure,&quot; said Madge, &quot;Let me help you with that.&quot; His loincloth had snapped apart when his legs dislocated, making it easier for her to grope his cock and balls. The latter became harder to hold as they were being drawn into his body. The former was becoming more of a handful as it grew longer and twice as thick. The reason for the thickness became clear as a crease appeared right down the length of his shaft. Madge&#39;s lower hands rubbed on it until she was holding a serpentine hemipenis in each hand. She continued stroking them as she guided them towards her slit.<br />
<br />
The feeling of his dicks entering her helped Zak not focus on the more uncomfortable parts of his changes. As his legs were being relocated upwards, his spine was extending further down. His small coccyx was growing longer and more massive until he had a tail twining with Madge&#39;s. His relocated legs underwent more changes to match the arms above them. His feet wen through the most drastic changes as his soles shrank to become palms while his toes extended into fingers. He wasn&#39;t yet familiar with his new hands to make complex use of them, but he could as least hold Madge as he started thrusting with more vigor.<br />
<br />
Madge hissed with pleasure as she humped the growing cobra beneath her. She noticed that his muscles, which were well-defined before, were becoming even larger. He certainly needed the broader shoulders for his four arms. His secondary pectorals were becoming just as large as the first pair and everything between them and his groin were solid abs. Speaking of his groin, his two dicks were filling Madge quite a bit more than she imagined. And she could feel they were close. She held tight with her four hands as she met his thrusts. With a final hiss, she felt him shoot thick jets of snake seed into her. Madge let out a hissing sigh. She hadn&#39;t felt that good in years.<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasss fantassstic,&quot; hissed Zak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can see that the cards were right about a few things,&quot; said Madge, looking the muscular four-armed cobra beneath her, &quot;A great change and great strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the loversss?&quot; asked Zak.<br />
<br />
Madge gave a pleased hum as she slid against him, &quot;That&#39;s for the future to reveal.&quot;</p>
