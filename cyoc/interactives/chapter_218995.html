<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">May brought about a fair number of changes, particularly as thoughts of summer came about. Things were truly becoming green as temperatures continued to become warmer, and at Juliet&#39;s chateau one could now truly see the green from the grape vines that made up a fair amount of grounds around the chateau itself. The vineyard provided for much of the money that Juliet had to pay for workmen and the maintenance of the chateau, her school, and the budding Animalian colony bustling around it. Most were students, and all of the female students that she&#39;d had had become Animalians. They were even looking at moving in full time, and Olympe actually looking into helping with working with the vines. Juliet was happy to see that interest in Olympe, who had commented that she would be quite happy to work with them, provided carrots and apples were available to snack on.<br />
<br />
The others were less than planned out for what to do next, beyond at least finishing school. For them, it often meant that Juliet was now also helping work out with forms and paperwork related to college applications and how they would qualify for them within France&#39;s system. It provided some extra hurdles, but they were also ones that Juliet was fairly happy to go through. The young men and boys, who were the newest students were simply happy to see the end of the school year, as would be expected from most kids in school. Only two of them, Charles and Renaud had become Animalians. Of them, it was Charles, who&#39;d become a Spanish Fighting Bull Animalian had expressed the interest in being a &quot;knight,&quot; and it was that desire that then brought things up with another event in May.<br />
<br />
The surprise came in when the acting troupe that had been doing the &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; series showed up at the chateau for their next episode. One that was having historical and literary figures seem to cross time and reality adventuring to face both literary villains, allies of their historic villains, and sorts of other things. It was something that when Charles had found out about the troupe&#39;s arrival and using parts of the chateau and its grounds for their next episode, is where he took a great interest in it. He and the other boys tended to watch the show when they didn&#39;t have classes or other things to attend to. Thus, noting that with one of the characters from the episode being &quot;King Louis,&quot; Charles wanted a part in order to be a &quot;knight.&quot; That then brought about a bit of interaction with the show&#39;s producers as they came in film and set up.<br />
<br />
&quot;A knight?&quot; the Human producer spoke as he sat across from Juliet as they discussed things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, a knight,&quot; Juliet answered, &quot;it&#39;s a film production, so it won&#39;t affect any sort of real world rank and it would make Charles&#39; day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t do this for fans,&quot; the producer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are wanting to shoot your episode on various parts of my vineyard and within my chateau,&quot; Juliet spoke firmly, &quot;forcing me to alter my class schedules and move my students around as well so you can have your series episode take place in a &quot;French chateau.&quot; If you want my cooperation, you will give a fan a moment to shine. He wants to be a knight... all with the image of shining armor and protecting the proverbial kingdom. And he may look into being a policeman... essentially serving out part of the roles that Medieval knights served...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but we also wanted you to serve as the host... that the characters would come and you would welcome them as they need to discuss their planning against the demons,&quot; the producer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And which interrupts my work and my schedule,&quot; Juliet answered, &quot;it is an interesting piece and the episodes have been tactful... and there is nothing in what you want said that would have me do anything that would jeopardize my license to teach. Which is in part why I&#39;ve accepted this... BUT I would also want you to give young Charles a small moment. It would mean a lot to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; the producer sighed, likely getting the sense that Juliet wasn&#39;t going to be steamrolled by anyone.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And Juliet largely had reason to make sure she wouldn&#39;t get steamrolled. In early May, much of the French school year was still ongoing, and while the end of that school year was getting closer, there were a lot of hurdles to go through, and many of the Human students were also due to return to their own homes for the summer, outside of those that might have too long of a journey. And Juliet had been planning out trips and vacations to the towns and villages where those students that couldn&#39;t easily get the transit to and from the chateau have that opportunity. It would let students see their families and would provide for some means of PR and dedication to her work.<br />
<br />
Which was something that was needed. As Juliet had suspected, her double, Kasumi Bindo, using her name as part of some ideas to have fun out at Heiya Island, did make the internet and drew some negative attention. The only thing that saved Juliet from losing everything was the fact that Kasumi admitted that what the people were paying attention to wasn&#39;t the actual Juliet Renard-Argente and that the fact that the two Silver Phase Red Fox Animalian women having the same name turning to be one of the biggest set of coincidences in modern memory. Juliet counted that as something to be lucky over, but it still couldn&#39;t hurt to try and maintain some good PR and provide the measures that would differ her from her double, which did have to point to the differences in their eyes, since both of them looked remarkably alike otherwise.<br />
<br />
The filming of the episode did interfere with all those works, as Juliet had to take some pause from her own work for a few short moments to provide the welcoming scene for her meeting with the characters playing the heroes for the &quot;When World&#39;s Collide&quot; series, along with other moments. She and Violet also had to make sure that the filmed fights with the demons elsewhere on the grounds didn&#39;t damage any vines or interfere with the required work. Blancheur voiced concern and puzzlement at the number of men and props needed for all of this, though Violet explained that filmed television series that were telling a story were not the same as the Animalia Ambassadoria segments that tended to do carry a more news sort of reporting and thus didn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; a set. And while it was trying, Juliet did manage to keep things clear, which ultimately provided for Charles to get his moment in his asking to be knighted... And everyone did watch from the side as that ceremony took place in one of the larger rooms of the chateau.<br />
<br />
&quot;A young bull like you wishes to be a knight?&quot; the actor playing King Louis asked to Charles who was kneeling before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, to protect my family and friends... and the lady of the manor,&quot; Charles spoke, &quot;to stand against those that are wrong and with guard ready...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And with your horns sharp,&quot; the actor playing King Louis noted, &quot;but young one... it isn&#39;t an easy life, and you could well fall in this service.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;d still be a hero,&quot; Charles answered, &quot;and Lady Juliet is smart and a wonderful teacher on all other things. It may let me be a smart knight who may not only show great strength... but great cunning as well, and thus see that the battles are not always contests of brawn.&quot;<br />
<br />
The actor playing King Louis then nodded, &quot;then I dub the Sir Charles of the House of Argente. May you learn from your lady in your quest to better yourself and those around you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Charles answered with a smile. He knew this was for some of the television specials that Animalia had provided, and he wouldn&#39;t quite be a true Medieval knight, but he would have a moment that would let him stand up for Juliet as a guardian and protector when he grew up. It made him happy, and he hoped it would advance other things that would ultimately help things for Juliet going forward.</p>
