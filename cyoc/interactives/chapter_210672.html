<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When she opened her eyes, for just a moment she felt like things were completely wrong, like she should be in a different body somewhere. <br />
<br />
Her enormous breasts, bulbous ass, and fat stomach stuck out in ways she wasn’t used to, and she was briefly overcome with an alien sensation that she should be both taller and much, much thinner. And… not a girl?<br />
<br />
She blinked a few times and the feeling faded like a good dream. Of course, she remembered she’d started porking up from a young age, and her insatiable libido lead her to being Chad’s (“Chad…” she moaned lustfully, against her will) personal toy, which ballooned her body up even further. Of course, her posters all over her walls didn’t let her stop thinking about him. His stacked body, his dominating demeanor, his… enormous package…<br />
<br />
She tried to look away but the posters were everywhere. And also… she just couldn’t. That dick had slipped into her mind and now it was all she could think about. It was like he was fucking her very thoughts….<br />
<br />
She almost came on the spot, and felt the instant soppy mess between her legs just at the memory of how good the sex had been. Despite it lasting just a few minutes, it had been the single greatest experience of her life that she could remember. <br />
<br />
It had just come at a terrible cost.<br />
<br />
“Finally awake, are we, dear?” Joanna twitched on hearing her mothers voice as she burst into the room. Wanting to be ready to face her, she rolled herself to the side and then struggled to force herself to sit up. The process took a long, awkward moment, her mom chatting happily the whole time.<br />
<br />
“I know you felt like wanting to drink with us last night, but I think you don’t understand how hard it is for all the rest of us, who have accomplished so much, to let you join in on the celebration. It takes a certain something away from the rest of us to see… Well, I want to say something kinder than ‘a useless fatass slut’ but nothing comes to mind… joining in like you’ve accomplished something other than being extremely promiscuous. I was trying to think of some reason you couldn’t join in, and it hit me this morning!”<br />
<br />
Finally getting into an upright position, her feet dangling above the floor and looking absolutely pathetic next to her incredibly tall, fit, gorgeous mother, Joanna saw she was holding up a pregnancy test kit.<br />
<br />
“Mom, I couldn’t be pregnant, I’m on birth control. And anyway, Chaaaaad…. ” on saying his name, she opened her mouth, letting her tongue drop out from between her enormous lips.. She felt a pulse from between her legs at the memory of him fucking her, and her eyes nearly crossed before closing. After what felt like forever, the feeling subsided, and she could talk again.<br />
<br />
“He only fucked me last night. A pregnancy test wouldn’t be positive that soon.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you, I figured something out last night.” Joanna’s sister leaned into her room while passing by, “When I picked up your birth control from the pharmacy? I told you it was in my purse each time, but you kept grabbing the wrong bag. You took the one with an experimental research chemical we’ve been working on in the lab.”<br />
<br />
“What!?” shouted Joanna. She knew her sister was doing important pharmacological research into infertility treatments, but this didn’t make any sense. “My birth control looked the same as always! It was in the same package it always was! And why were you just carrying experimental pharmaceuticals around with you along with my birth control!?”<br />
<br />
“Those are the same packages we put our experimental chemicals in for ease of distribution. One package is a single monthly dose for 28 patients. And it’s a highly unstable, radical, potentially dangerous new treatment for infertility, of course I’m going to keep it on me and not just leave it in the lab. Sorry I didn’t count on my loser sister stealing it.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t steal anything!” Joanna squirmed, and rolled herself off the bed. She moved to catch herself on her feet, but unable to see past her massive, swollen breasts, tripped over the thick, long, veiny rod that was her dildo of “Chaaaad!!” she yelled in ecstasy as she fell. She landed on her breasts, milk leaking out of her nipples that were too fat to fit in her hands. Her ass pointed straight up suggestively, pointing directly at one of the cameras in her room, putting her gargantuan rear and dripping, swollen snatch on full, direct display for a camera that was angled perfectly to capture just this moment. She groaned, but it came out more like a moan as she looked behind her at that camera with wide eyes and a face that she was sure looked more like a desperate invite for anyone watching to use her as they wished, and not the visceral frustration she was feeling. <br />
<br />
She turned back to her mom and sister, who both now loomed over her with condescending smiles. They looked like giants from her spot on the floor. While trying to get up, she was able to get her knees under herself, but then struggled to move further, and she realized this must look like she was kneeling before them. If they weren’t going to take her seriously before, they definitely weren’t now.<br />
“I keep them next to each other, and they’re in the same packaging. But you’ve been grabbing the wrong set of pills for eight months! You had a fifty-fifty chance of getting the right pills each time but you grabbed the wrong ones eight times in a row? There’s only a 0.4% chance of that happening.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve been taking the wrong pills for eight months!?” Joanna yelled, still struggling to stand. Her sea of boob flesh rocked and fought beneath her, keeping her from getting any leverage. Her arms pushed up against the floor, but they were so weak she wondered if she’d ever be able to stand again.<br />
<br />
“Don’t play dumb. I’ve seen the medication regimen Chad has you on, and everyone knows you love it. I’ll sell your ‘it was an accident’ story to the university, but we all know the truth.”<br />
<br />
“Joanna!’ Her mother scolded while clutching at her pearls, “how could you! It’s bad enough that you’ve done all of this to ruin your own reputation, but did you have to damage your sisters, too? And think of all those poor patients who thought they were getting treated for infertility, but instead were taking birth control. How cruel!”<br />
<br />
“It’s all good, Mom!” Her sister beamed. “It turns out that, in the form of infertility we’re studying, birth control is a cure! We’ve had a 100% success rate! It’s totally unprecedented, and the paper I’m writing on it is going to launch my whole research career.”<br />
<br />
Oh, great, thought Joanna. Her sister would get to be a respected scientist while she’d get to rack up mean comments on a social media platform built just to humiliate and bully her.</p>
