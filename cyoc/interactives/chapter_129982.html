<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason, the PE teacher, looked lost. He simply wanted to finish the emergency assembly quickly so he could get on with his class, and now it seemed like soon there&#39;d be no more students left for a real gym class, he believed. All around him, students were turning into these swishy faggots and there was nothing he could do. In his reverie, Chase Becker, the other PE teacher, yanked him aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Snap out of it, we need to find a way out of here,&quot; Chase whispered. Having spent years in the army, the bald, incredibly fit man knew how to keep cool under pressure and was using his training actively at this moment. Jason nodded as the two coaches quietly snuck out of sight of the twink horde. If they could simply get out of the school they could contact the authorities: the police, the CDC, the Vatican. Someone had to be able to do something. It wasn&#39;t even possible for them to fathom using their phones right now, thanks to Sean&#39;s programming.<br />
<br />
Given that the exits off stage were all blocked by the infected, the two coaches had to find something up on stage. Surely, there had to be another exit there, right? Perhaps the twinkified principal hadn&#39;t thought of it yet.<br />
<br />
They snuck towards the stage, watching in quiet horror as they saw the rest of their colleagues transform. The infection left none of them older than 21, with the youngest, a student teacher, being a mere 18. Generally, the slight extra age the staff had on the students was the only distinction between the two groups. The staff was just as slutty as the students, if not sluttier. Most, barely wore any clothing and those that did made sure that outside of the school they&#39;d still be charged with public indecency for how they dressed. Jason and Chase tried to remember what each teacher taught but they were confused by it. Did Jose always teach intro to anal toys? Was Gary meant to teach advanced blowjobs? When did Mason become so involved in the orgy department? Is that why he was slowly rallying the other teachers into a massive one right now? The gym teachers had no time to ask for answer such questions, in part because based on the giggling and dumb smiles coming the staff, it didn&#39;t seem like they&#39;d be intelligent enough to answer them anyways. As they skimmed around the side of the stage, they were even more horrified at the grand view of the auditorium. No matter where they looked it didn&#39;t seem as if there were any students or staff that hadn&#39;t been twinked up and sluttified. All the dildos were being used in one way or another, and those that hadn&#39;t been able to get to them just coupled (or tripled or quadrupled) with those next to them. Friends and enemies alike became lovers and fuck buddies and the two remaining teachers were powerless to stop them.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for them, they soon wouldn&#39;t want to stop the party. They managed to get to an exit, one that wasn&#39;t covered by the principal&#39;s boys, only to find Peter and Dan fucking doggy style like jack rabbits. The boys, having found their empty hallway a long time ago, were too focused on each other to even bother with the announcement for the assembly. Jason and Chase, now hairless from the nose down, were both dejected and terrified to realize that their fates had been sealed as Dan&#39;s moaning grew louder and higher pitched with each thrust from Peter.<br />
<br />
Soon, Jason&#39;s resignation turned to anger. These little shits can&#39;t control me, he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get the fuck out of our way! You fucking faggots and your homo lifestyle will not stop me from getting out of here!&quot; Jason proclaimed, not realizing his voice was higher with each sentence. His blonde hair, originally close cropped, was already starting to become wavy and cover his left eye while his roots started turning a sharp green. &quot;Now move!&quot;<br />
<br />
The now green haired muscle man with blonde highlights tried pushing past the sexy, unaware couple, however, as he touched them, he gasped and fell backwards onto his growing bubble butt. By touching their bare skin, the teacher now had a massive dose of the infection coursing through him and his changes were rapidly progressing.<br />
<br />
Chase, on the other hand, stayed quiet. Being a closeted gay man in such a close-minded area was difficult, but he wasn&#39;t sure if he wanted this. Sure, it would solve his problems, but at what cost? Would he really want to become like the boy he was watching getting fucked in the ass? He seemed to be clearly enjoying himself, and if he didn&#39;t want to be fucked before, he certainly did now. Normally, Chase would&#39;ve thought things through more, but with the small amounts of the infection coursing through his veins, he thought more with his dick. He walked up to the boy with the multiple earrings and slipped two fingers into his asshole. When they returned, they were covered in the sweet substance that had caused so much trouble. It smelled amazing, he thought. In fact, as he brought the liquid to his lips, it smelled delicious, he thought, taking a greedy lick to cement his fate.<br />
<br />
As Chase&#39;s mind started fogging over and he started rimming Peter, Jason was struggling through his changes. The straight man was firmly rooted in his sexuality, not only having a wife, but also a mistress on the side. At some point, he figured his wife must have found out about it, but given his body and his skill in the bed, she couldn&#39;t complain so long as he came back. Yeah, he had a hot body, he thought with a smile as he smacked his large, creamy globes. He paused after his action. Did he just do that? Besides, it was clearly his biceps that complemented his muscular physique so well that was his best feature, right? Wait, that wasn&#39;t possible, he didn&#39;t have the muscles for that. Sure he went to the gym enough to keep in shape, but it was definitely not enough to gain much muscle. Besides, cardio was much more important for him; it gave his bountiful cheeks time to jiggle around and distract all the hot boys at the gym. His master loved it when he did that, he thought with a slutty smirk. The last of his hard earned muscles withered away to a taut but smooth body as degrading tattoos started appearing all over his body. Of course, he did everything he could to impress his master, and it got him even more aroused to watch his girlfriend&#39;s reaction to every new thing he did for the boy. His favorite reaction was when he got the tattoo above his tiny cock that said, &quot;Closed, for good&quot; in block letters. Of course, his girl friend and bff was so happy for him, especially when he got the matching tattoo on the opposite side that said, &quot;Open, for good&quot; on the small of his back. They went shopping afterwards to celebrate, getting the sluttiest, yet most fashionable clothes they could. With his heterosexuality now gone, the green haired, fashionista twink went up to Chase, his master, and went straight for his cock, sucking it like it was the most delicious treat in the world.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Chase, having already been gay, didn&#39;t react to the infection the same way the homophobic general school population did. Yes, he still lost almost all his muscle, only keeping enough to keep him slightly more firm than the rest of the twinks. Yes, his years training in the army turned into years being a towel boy for the army, answering to the beck and call of anyone who wanted him for any reason. And yes, he did speak in an incredibly flamboyant manner with gay mannerisms and bright red hair streaked with blonde that covered his right eye perfectly to boot. None of that meant, however, that he didn&#39;t keep his intelligence. He simply had it refocused to be solely on his sex. It wasn&#39;t that he couldn&#39;t think about anything else, it was that he didn&#39;t want to anymore.<br />
<br />
He took a break from rimming the twink who&#39;s name he still did not know to look down at Jason, now Jace, or slave, as he preferred both. He was so glad they happened to work at the same place. Here, they taught students the art of seduction and technique, and Jace was devoted and determined to make these students as slutty as possible before they left here. He put them through rigorous training exercises, mainly to work their asses and core while training them to take on the biggest cocks they could. The gym was constantly filled with potent aphrodisiacs so that, when the period was over, Jace and Chase would have plenty of snacks all over the floor to clean up. It was the perfect job and the two were perfect for each other for it. With red and green hair, the duo constantly looked like a Christmas delight, as emphasized by Jace&#39;s Christmas lights hung provocatively around places like his neck and cock. It was just part of his fashion sense, he explained if anyone asked, and Chase loved it.<br />
<br />
Finally, realizing their new jobs, Jace Suckaton and Chase Peckers regressed down to the perfect age of 20 years and removed themselves from the copulating boys. They had to make sure the student body in the auditorium was up to par with their standards of how sluts should act and, if they didn&#39;t, then the duo would have to help them out. In fact, the sex teachers were already disappointed in the two boys they were messing with-- they&#39;ve probably only fucked each other today! It was unacceptable!<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on boys,&quot; Chase motioned. &quot;I know it gonna be totes hard to get off each other without getting off on each other but, babes, it&#39;s so time to broaden your horizons.&quot; As the teachers brought the boys back into the massive orgy occurring in the auditorium, four remaining young men were hidden out of sight hiding for their lives, or so they thought.</p>
