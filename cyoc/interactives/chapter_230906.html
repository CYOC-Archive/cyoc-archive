<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jill smiled in the mirror at herself and her little cute daughter, who had a frown on her face, with the girl being a man now in a little girl&#39;s body, and mostly getting himself into this himself, but Jill was just happy that nothing else could go wrong, seeing Ian who for the day in the dress that matches her own, with them going to be a matching pair of mother and daughter today. And she was only going to call the little girl her daughter&#39;s name &quot;Melannie,&quot; so she said while picking up Melannie carefully not to mess up the little amount of makeup on the 6-year-old face and the styled hair and said, &quot;Come on, it won&#39;t be that bad. I know you would prefer to be back in your own body, but you are doing this family a great favor?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ian/Melannie sighed, clinging onto her part-time mom and said, &quot;I know, and well, I just thought I was not going to stay as Melannie this long, but well, I just feel like I just want to be back into my own body, but the $200 kind of makes this worth all this hassle.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jill, seeing her daughter&#39;s smile after she mentioned the money, but before they could continue talking, Bill came in, leaving the front door open, making a trumpet sound and announcing, &quot;Ladies and ladies, let me please introduce to you for just one day our new member of the family... LUKE CRIMSON, he&#39;s new and improved, can read, write, do maths, and knows history!&quot; While smiling and after he stopped talking started to clap, and said into his wife&#39;s jills ear “he wanted me to do that, introduce the new him, he says he saw it on a tv show?” <br />
<br />
and while Bill was listing off the things what the new Luke can do (wisping to his wife&#39;s ear) the 9 year old boy, Luke, jumps through the door with a big smile and strikes a 3 pose’s in his new boy&#39;s suit (blazer tie slakes and a white button shirt) before running up to his mom and hugging her, saying, &quot;Mom, mom, do you hear what dad said? I can read now, like really read. I just started to read the names of shops out loud, and then dad realized I was reading things that I couldn&#39;t before. He made me read the car manual while sitting up at the front of the car, what I can do it with being so tall. Then he made me spell things, and I found the words just appearing in my head. I knew every word dad said, and then I could do a lot of maths. Dad says I must have gained the knowledge with this body, and this body, being a boy is amazing. I love it. I can stand up to pee now, having what dad said is called a penis, but to call it my dick. I feel so much more... well... well, good, like I can run a hundred times more further and faster than i could ever go, from being a stupid little girl. This body feels so good, and all of this knowledge is great, and being older and taller is so cool, I really do love all of this&quot; <br />
<br />
Luke said all of this jumping up and down, looking up at his mom with his hands wrapping around her and getting all of that out in less than 5 seconds, while his mom, Jill, looked down at him, rubbing his now blond hair which had some sort of gel in it that  pushed his shaggy back out of  his eyes, with it being scruffy before, and smiled, saying, “Well, that&#39;s amazing, honey. But remember, after today, you will be going back to being your little girl self agen, so don&#39;t get too attached to being Luke, okay?” with having some worry in her mind of him getting too attached to his new body and mind, not likening the idea that that body might change her sweet little girls mind, when she is back to being herself. <br />
<br />
Luke obviously did not like that, with his smile suddenly turning into a frown, and walking to his dad, Bill. Bill straight away put his hand on his new son, what he could not help but love the idea of having a son for a day, with him having an amazing morning with him, and said, “Come on, honey,” to Jill, “you do not have to ruin the boys fun.” Then he looked down at Luke and said in a quieter voice, “Look, buddy, you still got all today to have fun as you are, and I know there are boys your age who are going to be at the wedding, and you are going to have so much fun with them. And remember you are now a big brother to Melannie now, and you are going to have to be a good big brother to your sister, aren&#39;t you?” <br />
<br />
And surprisingly to Ian who had not been around kids before and does not know how fast kids can go from one thing to a new one in minutes, seeing Luke suddenly smile again and run up to me and said in a long voice, “Of course, I&#39;m going to be the best big brother ever,” with him wrapping Ien/ Melannie into a hug, which surprisingly felt quite nice, and Ien/Melannie hugged back, but still would prefer to be in Jill&#39;s/part-time mommy&#39;s hands still, with her putting me down when Bill and Luke come in, and then Luke said, “Mom, Dad, can I give Melannie a ride on my shoulders to the car like dad does to me?” <br />
<br />
Jill and Bill found themselves holding hands seeing their kids hugging and finding it so nice. But then Jill realized the time, and they need to be at the wedding soon with Luke mentioning going to the car, and said, “Yes, just be careful,” not seeing the freaked out face on Melannie/Ian’s face, hearing Jill say she is going to have to go onto her new brother&#39;s shoulders. She only finally felt fine with being held by Jill now, with having been picked up so meany times, but now she is going to have to go on this 9-year-old&#39;s shoulders, but before she could say anything, she was being lifted up quite roughly by said 9-year-old, with her letting out a little scream, but finding herself on Luke&#39;s shoulder in a matter of 2 seconds. <br />
<br />
And Luke happily holding onto his new sister/his old body&#39;s little girl&#39;s legs, while Melannie/Ian was holding tightly onto the 9-year-old boy&#39;s head, with the boy giggling, saying, “So this is what it is like holding me. Okay, sis, let&#39;s go to the car and have a little explore around the carpark, just don&#39;t cover my eye, okay? Oh, and do you know that there was an American Independence War, and that is how this country was founded, and all the leaders where so cool, and we had to fight against the British...” And Luke went on and on talking amazingly fast, going out the door.  <br />
<br />
With Bill and Jill happily looking at them, seeing their son being so good to his little sister, and then following, listening to Luke telling Melannie/Jen who seemed to be starting to calm down but not listening to Lukes, rambling on about what he know knows, but looking around, now with her being higher than she has been for the last 24 hours. She is thinking, what is this wedding going to be like, with her now stuck as Melannie and having a brother who wants to spend time with his &quot;new&quot; little sister? <br />
<br />
And well, the wedding was well... a wedding. When they got there, Luke gave Melannie/Ien a piggyback ride instead of shoulders, which Melannie/Ien much preferred if she had to be lifted at all, and was put down at their table. After making Ien/Melannie play with him for 10 minutes, which was not really working with Ien/Melannie being two heads smaller than Luke now, Luke found some boys around his new age and found himself running around and exploring the wedding area and playing with them, with it being the after-party. kids were not always at the ceremony. <br />
<br />
But Luke seemed to be happy having fun with his new friends, and them laughing at stupid jokes they were saying and shoving each over. What showd how much like any other boy he was behaving like. <br />
<br />
 But that still did not stop him from wanting to be a great big brother, getting Melannie/Ien to dance with him when Jill and Bill went to dance, and then ending up with him tickling her, with her on the floor lathing her lounges out, but which did not end well, with Melannie/Ien kicking Luke in the groin, which ended up with Luke on the floor feeling the pain of what every boy/man goes through when he gets hit there. <br />
<br />
 Melannie/Ien went back to where she had been for the whole day, sitting on her chair waiting to go back to the hotel and get this deal over with.  <br />
<br />
 Jill and Bill tried to get her to play with the other young girls around 4-7 years old, but Ien/Melannie just did not really know how to or really wanted to, so that is why Ien spent the wedding. But she did apologize to Ien when Jill and Bill asked her to, with her only kicking him there by accident and did feel sorry knowing how painful it is. and let Luke give her a hug again, not helping to rest her head on his chest with it feeling so nice, and which seemed to make Luke happy again and call himself a great big bro. <br />
<br />
And well, Jill and Bill did what most people do at weddings: they talked to family and friends, danced and drank, and also had to explain that Luke is their foster son, who was one of their close friends&#39; kid whom they took in 2 months ago, with their fake friends dying and leaving him nowhere to go but to them. What they didn&#39;t even think twice before adding him to their family. They also made sure to check their daughter for the day, that she wouldn&#39;t give anything away. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
But by the end of wedding it was 7PM, with it being 12h from changing the real Melannie into Luke, and they were in the car on their way back to the hotel with Ien/Melannie nearly falling to sleep, and Luke wide awake holding onto a a piece of paper with all of his new friends/cousins friend codes for games/ social media (Fortnite/discord and such) smiling with it being his best day ever, but that might change with Jill looking at the back seat where Luke and Ien/Melannie where sitting and said looking at her son Luke “well im glad you enjoyed yourself honey, but i bet you are looking forward to becoming your cute little girl self again?” with a smile on her face. <br />
<br />
But Luke looked suddenly looked annoyed haring his mom say that and said/shouted “no, I&#39;m got going back to being a stupid little girl! I&#39;m a boy now and i love being a boy, i love being able to read and right and have cool friend who play video game and playfights with me, and i  understand things like.... money and... sex and stuff, so no I&#39;m not going back to being a little girl who can only count up to 30 and who some time even wets herself at nights, i even now understand dads work, and i know her can make it so i am your adopted son, with him working in that part of the government, right?”  <br />
<br />
Jill just frowned and Bill seemed shocked, while Ien/Melannie was now awake with the boy next to her being lound and not liking where this could go, and Jell said “no honey, you being Luke was only going to be today, and even if we wanted you to stay as Luke what can we say what happened to Melannie, if you don&#39;t go back to being her. <br />
<br />
But Luke was only 9 and he knew he was never going back to being a little girl and said “well i don&#39;t care, we can move somewhere where nobody knows us, and start a new life, or fake my old life death, but im not Melannie anymore im Luke and there is nothing going to make me turn back in to a stupid little girl, you might as well leave Ien as Melannie and let her be your daughter fall time because I&#39;m got going to!!!” <br />
<br />
Jill did not know how her daughter now son felt so strong about wanting to stay as he is, but... They can&#39;t let him stay and do one of the things he said... could they?, yes Bill can quite essay make up a new person, she had herd him complain how there really is nothing to stop anyone who gets into the system to do so, but does she want a son, she could have both? Maybe Ien would stay as Melannie for good, or maybe trap him? But that is pretty messed up, but still seeing them hugging and dancing was amazing, it made her really feel like she wanted Melannie to have a sibling, and well how they are now is quite great, all she had to do is say she lost the Medallion, or say it was taking like they feared it would be, but is that the right thing to do she looked at bill seeing he is thinking about this, and Jill thought that she will just agree with what bill think is right and said “well... bill what do you think?”</p>
