<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lewis went to the subway to head to the mall. As he got his ticket he thought about it a decided to change more people to see the limits of the amulet&#39;s powers. He decided to start with small changes to see what he could do. As he waited for the subway train to stop at the station he looked around and saw man who he could tell was rude to others from how he was acting to a couple of people near him. He thought about that man becoming a female anthro rabbit who was submissive slave he brought. The man changed into his new form Lewis thought of and while it was happening Lewis noted no one was panicking from the sight of it. The man became a woman first growing  a set of mid d-cup breasts and wide firm hips. Then she grew fur and her face changed some as she grew rabbit ears and a rabbit tail. She looked around and saw him and stood beside him. &quot;Is their anything you want me to do master?&quot; She asked him. &quot;Just head home and wait for me to return May.&quot; He told her using her new name. She nodded and left the subway station.<br />
The train stopped at the station and Lewis got on. As it headed to the next station her looked around and picked a woman who is pregnant but didn&#39;t look happy about it. he was wondering why when he found himself in a alleyway at night where he saw her being raped by two men. He was then back in the subway. He realized that he could see other people&#39;s past if only to learn why about their feelings of something. He looked at her and thought about her being a pregnant cat woman because if her mate. She begin to change into a cat woman. Fur grew on her as her face became cat like and cat ears and a tail grew. Soon she was a new person as she looked happily at her belly. <br />
The subway stopped at the station a block away from the mall. Lewis got up from his seat and saw the new cat woman about to get up. He walk over and helped her off her seat and out of the train. She give him her thanks and he when up the stairs and exited the station. He walked to the mall and looked around to see what&#39;s there. He went through several stores while turning 13 people into anthros and give 7 ears and tails of animals. He stopped at the food mart area and went to a Subway and got a sub. He looked around and saw 4 people acting shifty. He used the look in the past ability and found that they plan to use a bomb in the mall. He thought of them becoming true cats and placed them in the pet shop and their plan was given to another group who were caught two months ago. The change happened and he gained new memories about watching a news report about that. Other than that the rest was the same.<br />
Lewis headed home after he finished eating his sub. He took the subway again but didn&#39;t change any one having finished testing the amulet&#39;s ability. He came home and found his new slave wearing a skimpy maid outfit. &quot;Master your back! How may I serve you?&quot; She asked him. His mind took a perverted turn walked up to her and grabbed her breasts. &quot;I think you know.&quot; He told her as he played with her. He took her to his room and toss her on his bed. &quot;Remove your clothes.&quot; He ordered her. She followed his order and was naked and laid on her back with her pussy spread open. He removed his clothes and thrust his cock into her. He had grew his cock at the mall into a 1 foot long 3 inch thick cock. He took her hard and fast breaking her barrier. She moaned in pain and pleasure as the two clashed in her. Soon pleasure was the only thing she felt as her master&#39;s cock go deeper into her towards her womb. He grabbed one of her breasts and sucked on the other one causing her mind to start to blank out. Soon her womb was being attacked by her master&#39;s cock and her mind was overwhelmed by the pleasure. Suddenly Lewis&#39;s cock had violated her womb causing her to cum. The feeling of her cumming set him off as well. May was knocked out from the pleasure while her master cummed into her inflating her womb making her look 3 moths pregnant. He pulled out of her and laid beside her and fell asleep.</p>
