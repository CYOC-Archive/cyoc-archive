<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pete thought for a moment. &quot;Any animal or insect! What&#39;s it to be?&quot; Pete decided that he&#39;d like to become something quite scary, powerful and potentially dangerous. &quot;A dragon? No, that&#39;s not real, it&#39;s mythical. Nearest equivalent? Yes! A Komodo Dragon, the largest living lizard on the planet!&quot;<br />
So that he&#39;d not be disturbed or discovered, Pete decided to go to a secluded place to make his first transformation. He knew of an old disused quarry a few miles away where hardly anyone would ever venture. He jumped into his car and drove off towards his destination. As he drove he still couldn&#39;t believe for sure that these inner voices which had told him of the power he now had to transform into any animal or insect were just a figment of his imagination, but nevertheless, he had to prove it!<br />
Raughton Quarry was a 20 minute walk away from a layby in the road which in summer time would have a stall selling food and drink to passing motorists. The stall was never there in the autumn time, so the layby was empty as Pete turned into it. He remembered this place well as a spot where he and his friends when they were kids used to cycle to and walk around together. The path they tried was a little overgrown now, but Pete followed it, through a small, dense thicket of bushes which gave way to larger trees which completely hid the quarry. The quarry was open to the air and the sunlight streamed in from the blue sky above. As Pete entered the quarry, he could smell the  damp and dank smell of autumn and he could feel the seclusion of the place. He wouldn&#39;t be disturbed here.<br />
&quot;So&quot; thought Pete &quot;This is it. A Komodo Dragon. If this is going to work, I&#39;d better strip off, I don&#39;t want to get tied up in human clothing!&quot;<br />
Pete was not a little apprehensive whilst he stripped off, mainly for fear of being discovered, but he carried on until he was naked. He put his clothes into a neat pile on the top of a nearby rock which had a dry surface because it was bathed in sunlight and warm to the touch. Not really knowing how all of this would work, he nevertheless began. Trusting that, if these powers really worked, they would guide him in his transformation step by step and, by instinct, tell his body what to do, his mind turned to the object of his first ever transformation - a Komodo Dragon.<br />
&quot;This is madness, it&#39;s not worki...&quot;<br />
Suddenly, he felt compelled to lay flat on the damp surface of the quarry floor with his arms and legs by his side. Through the skin which covered the bottom of his spine, Pete could feel something beginning to build up, a sort of pressure, which began to get more and more intense. Finally, this pressure split the skin and a large, scaly tail burst through. As this somewhat painful part of the transformation was happening, Pete could feel the texture and thickness of his skin changing. He tried to move one hand to feel it, but it was imobile. He did manage though to turn his head around to see that the entire surface of his body was now become the skin of a lizard. The next change began almost at the instant that he turned to look at his skin. With a crunching sound, the bones if his arms and legs began to rearrange themselves and his hands and feet twisted and turned until they lifted his whole body off the ground. The leathery lizard skin then began to cover his  limbs and join with the rest of his body&#39;s skin. He felt his cock and balls suck into his belly. All that now remained of his human form was his head. His hair began to suck into his scalp. He found that he was compelled to push and push out his tongue rather like the pressure he felt when his tail was bursting through his skin. As he pushed on his tongue, it began to lengthen and he could feel the texture changing from soft to leathery. As he looked he could see it getting longer and leathery in texture and with one final enormous push, it shot right out of his mouth and divided into two at the end to form the typical lizard forked tongue.<br />
The final stage of Pete&#39;s transformation began once the whole of his body had elongated and pushed out, expanded and enlarged massively, until it was about twelve feet long from the tip of his tail to his head.<br />
Pete was conscious of every twist and turn, every contortion, every crunch of his transforming skeleton. It was like he was in a dream...<br />
The final change was perhaps the most bone crunching of all. Once again, Pete began to feel that now familiar pressure in his nose and his jaws. It built and built in intensity until at its peak, his nose began to push outwards beyond his lower jaw and his teeth and jawbones began to crack audibly as the mounting pressure forced them to reshape his whole head into that if the lizard. He felt his ears being pulled into his skull and his vision began to alter as his eyes took on that familiar lizard-like slit. As the final changes were made and with the most intense grinding and grating sensation of the whole transformation process, his skin turned leathery as the rest  of his body was. He was now completely a Komodo Dragon.<br />
It was true, the voices in his head were true to their word. He had the power to transform. And he enjoyed every moment of it!</p>
