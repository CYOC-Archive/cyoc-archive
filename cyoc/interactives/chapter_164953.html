<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once the army truck hastily left the base, we saw the Lieutenant turn his head towards us. Like a lightning bolt, Doug reached for the window and closed it, pulling the blinds down. I don’t think he saw us. There, we stood, completely silent. That was, until Doug spoke with his usual excited tone.<br />
<br />
“I fucking knew it! Genetic experimentation!”<br />
“We don’t know that for sure.”<br />
“Oh come on Alex, we just saw it!”<br />
“No, it can’t be real.”<br />
“We just saw Connor get fucked by a literal giant. How did you not see that?!”<br />
<br />
The two naked soldiers continued to argue, as Doug’s hard-on swung violently around. It wasn’t going down. I’m pretty sure I saw it throb, like it was basking in the open air. Andy’s gaze was fixed on it, his face turning bright red. As much as I wanted to join him, I needed to find that vial, fast. When I turned to face my bed, I felt my body turn cold.<br />
<br />
My pillow. It wasn’t on my mattress.<br />
<br />
It must’ve fallen to the ground during the kerfuffle, and was now mixed with the rest of them that are strewn about on the floor. It could be in any of them. My eyes darts everywhere, hoping to see the vial poke through the fabric. I couldn’t find it. Meanwhile, Doug and Alex were finishing their argument.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just agree to disagree, OK?”<br />
“Fine. I don’t know how you can dismiss what you saw, but whatever. The first thing we should all do is put this room back to the way it was. I’ll make myself decent.”<br />
“Can we open the window. It boiling in here.”<br />
“No, the Lieutenant must not know we saw. If you need to sweat, then sweat.”<br />
<br />
The stench of the guys’ musk already clung to the walls of this room, so I didn’t really care. I continued scanning the room for the vial. Maybe it fell out, and was under the bed frames or something. Maybe it was somehow under my mattress. I was starting to lose hope. Doug picked up his pillow and held it over his crotch again, pressing his boner against his chest. As the rest of the squad reached for the first mattress and pillow they could find, my situation grew ever more dire. That was until I heard Doug behind me.<br />
<br />
“Hey, what’s this?”<br />
<br />
He moved his hips slightly, his cock was rubbing against something very odd in his pillow. Reaching in, he pulled out the vial. Of course he would be the one to pick my pillow. Just my luck. He studied the vial with a curious and confused expression. The liquid inside moved like a purple cloud. Doug turned to the rest of us.<br />
<br />
“Who’s is this?”<br />
<br />
Silence. Owning up would be suicide, especially after the Lieutenant’s visit. Doug laughed as he wiped the sweat off his forehead.<br />
<br />
“Well it belongs to one of you.”<br />
“Check the label of the pillow.”<br />
“Oh yeah…Liam?”<br />
<br />
Fuck. I’m dead.<br />
<br />
I felt a small drop of sweat fall down my face. I could feel their eyes on me. Seeing the morning sun shine on Doug’s glistening body almost made me explode in my shorts. I needed to block those thoughts out. Now was not the time. I tried to act normal again, casually leaning against my bed frame.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s mine.”<br />
“What is it?”<br />
“Just some sort of incense. I use it to relax. Don’t touch it though, it can burn.”<br />
“Seriously?”<br />
“Yeah. Most incenses are like that.”<br />
“I never took you as the incense-type of guy. What scent is it?”<br />
“L…lavender.”<br />
<br />
I don’t know how, but I think they bought it. Andy watched it closely, like he was studying it. It was weird to see him stare at anything other than Doug. Maybe he didn’t believe me. Doug carefully popped the cap off. A column of purple fumes escaped from the vial, and Doug held it close to his nose, taking a deep breath. His eyes narrowed as he frowned, before putting the cap back on and giving it to me.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know what scent that is, but it’s certainly not lavender.”<br />
“What did it smell like?”<br />
“It didn’t really smell like anything….except maybe-“<br />
<br />
Doug suddenly stopped speaking, which was rare for him. He looked slightly uncomfortable, as he reached his hand into the pillow to adjust his cock. When I say adjust, it looked like he was trying to discreetly jerking off. Suddenly, he lunged towards his bed, and pulled out the trunk from underneath. His quick pants filled our ears. He grabbed some of his clothes and frantically tried to put them on. During all of this his cock was still hard as a steel rod, and his balls began to pulsate. I was sure I saw them swell up. After last night, anything is possible. We all looked on, worried.<br />
<br />
“Dude are you okay?”<br />
“Yeah I’m fine. I just need to use the bathroom.”<br />
“You heard the Lieutenant. We all have to stay here.”<br />
“But I need to go!”<br />
“You can’t!”<br />
“FUCK!”<br />
<br />
Like a lion he pounced on his bed and firmly thrusted his hips into his mattress. His low moans quickly grew into grunts as we watched him fuck his bed. We were stunned. I never thought seeing Doug get off would be so arousing. Alex was the only one freaking out, as tried to stop him, but Doug was just too strong for him. He grabbed Alex by the arms and threw him onto my bed. If he wanted to, he could’ve picked Alex up and fucked him instead of the mattress. Judging from the way he looked at him with those lust-filled eyes, I think it was something he considered. Alex’s voice was being drowned out by Doug’s moans.<br />
<br />
“What the hell are you doing?!?”<br />
“I don’t know! I just can’t help it! OHHH FUCK! What is in that thing Liam?!”<br />
<br />
His thrusts grew quicker, as the entire bed banged against the wall. Large drops of precum began to flood from his cock. His display only caused the barracks to grow even hotter. His entire body was dripping with sweat. He’s always been a horny guy, but I’d never seen him so sex-crazed before.That was when I put two-and-two together.<br />
<br />
The fumes. It must cause some kind of hormonal boost or something, which would explain Alex’s intense session last night. However, before I could explain, Doug’s deafening shrieks of pleasure pierced our ears. I wouldn’t be surprised if the whole base heard him climax. As he leant back a huge stream of his seed launched across the room. He came a ridiculous amount. The stench of it was overpowering. As the door to the barracks was being covered in cum, I was so tempted to join him.<br />
 Judging from the tent in Andy’s pyjamas, I wasn’t the only one who had that temptation. Alex stepped back in disbelief as his squadmate shot the last of his loads, and collapsed on his mattress. He was still conscious, but was just breathing heavily. His torso was mostly submerged in a thick, white puddle. It didn’t look like he cared. Once again, the barracks fell silent, until Alex turned to me, bright red.<br />
<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON LIAM?!”</p>
