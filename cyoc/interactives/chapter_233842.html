<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the sun began to set, the Solar Guardians found themselves growing hungry. Hearing this Martin smirked, raiding Missy&#39;s fridge as he began to grill hamburgers and hotdogs for the Guardians to enjoy. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we help him,&quot; Miranda asked. &quot;Only if you want him to get angry,&quot; Marilyn replied. &quot;It&#39;s an unwritten rule when it comes to men. Never, ever, help them when they&#39;re grilling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite Miranda&#39;s concerns, Martin continued to grill. Balancing a tray with more hamburgers and hotdogs than they could possibly eat, the Guardians now filled their stomachs after a long day of training. &quot;Mmm these are so yummy,&quot; Tess exclaimed happily. &quot;Thank you Mr. O&#39;Toole!&quot; Martin smiled, thanking the youngest Guardian as he leaned back in his chair. A look of pride on his face as the Guardians filled themselves to almost bursting.<br />
<br />
As night came, the Guardians now talked of what tomorrow would hold. Pokoyo was pleased with their progress yet he felt more training was needed. Missy, Marilyn, and Tess were still new to their powers. If they were to face the Dark Garden or whatever else the Normal had planned, they needed to be ready. That, though, would have to wait for tomorrow as Marilyn stood. &quot;Tess dear,&quot; she said sweetly. &quot;We have a long day tomorrow. Why don&#39;t you head upstairs and take a shower. Afterwards I&#39;ll help you get ready for bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to,&quot; the 10 year old moaned. &quot;Everyone else is staying up. Why can&#39;t I hangout with the other Guardians?&quot; As Marilyn was about to answer, the sound of someone banging on the door echoed throughout the beach house. Puzzled, the Guardians glanced towards the backdoor. &quot;Missy are you expecting any visitors,&quot; Martin asked. &quot;No,&quot; Missy replied slowly, the group suddenly nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s your mom,&quot; Jenna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if it&#39;s the Dark Garden,&quot; Marilyn added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t let it be another pint sized Guardian,&quot; Lilith groaned.<br />
<br />
Cautiously Missy now approached, Martin standing behind her wielding his cane like a club. As Missy opened the door, she was surprised to see a pale Asian woman with a dark skinned woman in bandages behind her. &quot;Lilith here,&quot; the Asian woman asked gruffly. &quot;Bong,&quot; Lilith gasped, coming into view. &quot;What the hell are you doing here?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Looking for you,&quot; Bong grumbled.&quot;Misery got worried when she didn&#39;t hear from you so she sent us. Paid a nice chunk of change to do it too.&quot; Lilith frowned, she had told Misery about this training exercise, it annoyed her that the Dark wizard would be so worried. Quickly she stopped sulking as she curiously gazed at Bong and Set. &quot;What do you mean us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;PINK KITTY!!!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith shrieked in alarm as Jolie bolted inside, lunging towards a startled Pokoyo. Squeezing the pink cat in a bear hug that made his eyes bulge, Jolie now smothered the cat in kisses. &quot;Oh I missed you Pink Kitty,&quot; Jolie said lovingly. Pokoyo was only able to utter a simple kuyi as Jolie smooshed his head into her breasts. &quot;Look,&quot; Jolie said excitedly. &quot;I got you something. Do you like catnip? I made it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pokoyo paused, watching as the necromancer pulled out a small bag. Holding in front the pink cat, Jolie now let him smell it. The odor alone was intoxicating, Pokoyo instinctively rubbing his face against the bag. &quot;Aww pink kitty likes it,&quot; Jolie said happily, opening the bag and dumping a large mound of homemade catnip on the floor. Placing him on the ground, Jolie giggled as Pokoyo now dove in, rubbing his body in the mound as he began to eat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah we brought Jolie,&quot; Bong sighed. &quot;Luca and Bob too. Now can someone invite us in before the sun comes up?&quot; Lilith sighed, inviting the vampire inside as the rest of Death Riot followed suit. At the sight of Luca the werewolf and Bob the anthro zebra demon, Tess screamed ducking behind Marilyn. &quot;MONSTERS!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who’s the kid,&quot; Bong asked, gesturing towards a terrified Tess. &quot;She&#39;s the newest Solar Guardian,&quot; Lilith sighed. Bong raised an eyebrow, studying the young girl carefully. &quot;What the hell you guys are recruiting third graders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I&#39;m going to be in fifth grade next year,&quot; Tess shouted back, pouting at Bong. &quot;Um Lilith care to introduce your friends,&quot; Marilyn asked, trying to comfort the distressed Tess. &quot;Yeah fine,&quot; Lilith groaned. &quot;Everyone this is Bong-cha, Set, Luca, Jolie, and Bob. They&#39;re in a punk band called Death Riot.&quot; The other Guardian nodded, offering a polite hello before turning to Lilith. &quot;So how do you know these guys Lilith,&quot; Jenna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve kind of been living with them for the last several months,&quot; Lilith replied with a shrug. &quot;Okay let me get this straight,&quot; Missy exclaimed. &quot;Are you telling me you live with a werewolf, a mummy, a freaking vampire, and...whatever the hell Bob is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Demon,&quot; Bob replied. &quot;Plus Jolie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; Missy yelled. Lilith nodded, it seemed weird to others but she had grown accustomed to the odd ball family. &quot;Well,&quot; Miranda shrugged. &quot;One of my best friends mom is a vampire. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that.&quot; Miranda now stepped forward, the shy teen extending her hand as she smiled. &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah sure,&quot;  Bong stated. Slowly the other Guardians now approached, making conversation with the oddball monster punk rock band. After 15 minutes, the initial shock and terror wore off, with even Tess now comfortable in the presence of monsters. &quot;Hey where&#39;s Pokoyo,&quot; Jenna commented. Turning the group now beheld their Guardian familiar.<br />
<br />
Pokoyo appeared dazed, his eyes as wide as saucers as a long string of drool hung from his open mouth. The pink cat now giggled mindlessly, dangling his three tails in front of his face. &quot;I have three tails,&quot; he giggled. &quot;And LOOK...they make rainbows!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it Jolie,&quot;  Bong sighed. &quot;How strong is that shit you made?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that strong,,&quot; Jolie frowned.&quot;Bullshit,&quot; Bong yelled, pointing at Pokoyo. &quot;Look at him! His ass is orbiting Pluto right now!!!&quot; Pokoyo giggled, the cat swooning from side to side. &quot;It&#39;s not that strong and I&#39;ll prove it,&quot; Jolie exclaimed. Before Bong could say another word, the necromancer stuck her head inside the bag. The sound of Jolie snorting the contents of the bag rang out through the beach house, much to everyone&#39;s shock. As Jolie lifted her head, Bong could only facepalm in disgust.  Jolie eyes were crossed, the effects of the catnip already causing her to sway unsteadily on her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she wheezed. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s a bit too strong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bong cursed under her breath, picking up the intoxicated Pokoyo before hoisting Jolie over her shoulder. &quot;Ugh I&#39;m going to put these two to bed,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Are the bedrooms upstairs?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;ll show you,&quot; Jenna stated. &quot;And I&#39;ll give you a hand,&quot; Missy added, the two Guardians now following Bong as she ascended the stairs. Slowly Everyone else filed out of the room. Marilyn taking Tess to bathe as Martin showed Bob and Luca a spare bedroom. It was now just Set and Lilith, the goth teen folding her arms as she frowned. &quot;Ugh I can&#39;t believe Misery sent you here to babysit me,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;And worse, she had to pay you to do it!&quot;Set now stifled a laugh, confusing the teen who gave her an annoyed look. &quot;What&#39;s so funny?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are,&quot; Set laughed, trying to keep her voice down. &quot;Do you really think Misery paid us to watch you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um maybe,&quot; Lilith stammered. &quot;But still, I can&#39;t believe she would send you guys to watch me like I&#39;m freaking five.&quot; Once more Set stifled a laugh, shaking her head. &quot;Geez you dense,&quot; she smirked. &quot;Misery didn&#39;t send us, she only told us where you were.&quot; Now Lilith was utterly confused, if Misery didn&#39;t send them who did? Feeling more foolish by the second, Lilith now asked in a small voice, who decided to come here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait Bong dragged you guys here,&quot; Lilith exclaimed. &quot;Of course dingus now keep your voice down,&quot; Set shushed. Lilith was flabbergasted, sure she got along well enough with Bong but the vampire was always so emotional distant. &quot;Look kid,&quot; Set said warmly. &quot;Like it or not Bong adores you. I&#39;ve know her for centuries and I&#39;ve never seen her care so much about someone before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how come she doesn&#39;t say anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how she is,&quot; Set stated. &quot;She&#39;s a hard ass especially when it comes to saying she likes someone. She worries about your safety all the time. I know she sees you as family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Lilith said in awe. &quot;I didn&#39;t know.&quot; Set smiled, placing an around the teens shoulder. &quot;Well now you do kid,&quot; she said warmly. &quot;You&#39;re family to us and we make sure our family stays safe.&quot;</p>
