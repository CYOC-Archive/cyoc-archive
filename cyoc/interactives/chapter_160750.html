<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gustavus Amehr and Quintus Fives&#39; front man for their &quot;resistance&quot; movement to the big reveal, known only as Charles, eventually had to make his way to his own job and spent much of the day there worrying over what the results of his request for a formal protest.  A lot of this had to do with some of the other things that had gone on. Amehr and Fives hadn&#39;t started any fights on the issue, at least so far as Charles knew, but he also knew that fights had occurred with a massive one occurring at the college. To Charles, that was simply proof of the problem and the threat that Tom Herald posed to Moon Lake&#39;s security. For if Moon Lake was ready for it, or if the world was ready for it, Moon Lake&#39;s weres wouldn&#39;t be fighting over it. And privately, Charles figured that every fight was instigated by some liberal were that supported the reveal.<br />
<br />
That was why he was so determined to expose Tom Herald for the fraud that he was. He didn&#39;t care about weres, for if he did he wouldn&#39;t support something that was causing them to fight. The world when humanity believed weres were real was full of superstition that treated weres as though they were bloodthirsty monsters, and it was only humanity began to believe that weres were nothing more than made up creatures used to scare people and weren&#39;t real that things got better for weres. It was something that made the were secret so critical to protect, as it was the only thing that was preventing those old medieval biases from coming back, and while people could always talk of &quot;progress,&quot; there was often plenty of information that showed that the progress they spoke of wasn&#39;t really there.<br />
<br />
But from what he&#39;d found out in the morning, there were still those that supported the reveal and looked to be active in support of Herald&#39;s idea, regardless of how foolish it was. That meant that there was likely a fair amount of planning that the city had to do with what they would allow for and where the protest could be, if they would allow it at all... at least for the day. It was that sort of thing that hung on Charles&#39;s mind as he went through his work day, and that wasn&#39;t made any easier when he didn&#39;t get a call from City Hall on that issue. He&#39;d given them his cellphone number so that they could contact him at work, if need be, but he hadn&#39;t heard from them, and now that things were getting close to the end of the work day, things would become rather difficult to work with. Particularly as while Moon Lake had its fair share of businesses in Moon Lake, many were small businesses that only needed a handful of employees, and that meant that a fair number of Moon Lake&#39;s residents commuted to and from other places to work... and that could make coordinating things difficult.<br />
<br />
Thankfully his cellphone finally did ring as he made his way out from his job. He pulled it out of his pocket and noted that the number did come from Moon Lake&#39;s City Hall, it was later than he expected, but given all that had gone on in relation to all the other debates going on. Charles couldn&#39;t understand why the debates were going on, but after what he&#39;d heard in the morning, he wasn&#39;t going to try and pretend that no one supported Tom Herald&#39;s ide. He continued on his way to his car as he answered the call.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Charles spoke into the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Sire?&quot; came a woman&#39;s voice through the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking... I take it this is about the permission request I filed this morning?&quot; Charles wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; was the reply, &quot;I&#39;m sorry for not getting back to you sooner... but between the pro reveal group wanting to &quot;demonstrate&quot; and the fact that both of you wish to do so on the same day... today... there has been a lot of back and forth between our office, the Mayor&#39;s office, and the Moon Lake PD... all with public safety in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not knowing that his benefactors intended to ultimately kill Tom Herald, Charles answered, &quot;Well... I would assure you that I would have no wish to see anyone hurt and would be sure to let all of those I&#39;ve been in contact with that you would desire to keep things civil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; was the answer, and it then continued in a serious tone, &quot;for your request has been granted that you may stage your protest outside City Hall, starting at six PM.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Outside...&quot; Charles couldn&#39;t help but interrupt.<br />
<br />
&quot;The main plan, as it is developed is to be done in private and the situation is tense enough that it doesn&#39;t need people arguing over whether or not the plan is to be done or not at the same time,&quot; the City Hall spokeswoman answered, &quot;You may protest... but it won&#39;t be inside the building.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles gave a sigh as he reached his car and opened the door with his free hand. That wasn&#39;t quite what he figured Gustavus and Quintus would have wanted, but he figured some of that made sense. As he sat down in the driver&#39;s seat, the City Hall spokeswoman continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are not to fight with those in favor or the reveal,&quot; the City Hall spokeswoman informed him, &quot;they will be across the street from you in front of the Moon Lake Post Office. You are not to fight with them or anyone else. No rocks are to be thrown or bottles or cans or anything else. And the Moon Lake Police Department will have officers on hand to monitor the situation from either group. Should anyone, and I mean anyone, start anything... all permission will be revoked on site. That comes from the Police Commissioner. Am I clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Charles answered, &quot;and I&#39;m to trust that those college hooligans understand this as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They do,&quot; the city spokeswoman answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear,&quot; Charles answered, &quot;hopefully, I&#39;ll see you at six as part of the voice that speaks for reason and rationality, which knows that exposing weres is wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
He got no direct answer and only heard the phone click as whoever he was talking to from the city hung up. With that, Charles tossed his phone softly onto the passenger&#39;s side seat and pivoted in his seat. He sighed a little as he leaned to his left to pull the car door shut, as the news was late and that would mean he&#39;d have a lot of calls to make in a short period of time once he got home to make sure that everyone that had showed up outside the Stevens home earlier in the week would know of the authorized protest, which Charles figured would outnumber whatever group that the school had gathered to support Herald and would make it clear that Tom Herald&#39;s message was not to be trusted because of his status as an outsider to Moon Lake and because he hadn&#39;t been a were all that long, and as such didn&#39;t know how important the were secret was. That was all that mattered... at least to Charles, and once he could get home from work, he&#39;d start making the calls needed.</p>
