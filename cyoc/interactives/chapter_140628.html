<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bob walked in on a cold Friday morning several months after Frida had been released and put in school. The first test had been a rousing success and the state had quickly ordered more transforming injections to take place. They wanted a few more trials before it went into full operation. His desk had files on it contained in thick envelopes that no one else was to read. He just skimmed through them lazily before pouring a coffee and getting to work.<br />
<br />
His second subject was a man named Sam Grey. He was getting up there in terms of years having already spent twenty three years of his lifelong sentence in that very ward. He’d been arrested for some rather agregious hate crimes. The man was filth of the worst kind, going out of his way to make blacks as uncomfortable as possible. He’d followed them home shouting insults and threats with a bunch of other boys, except unlike his compatriots he’d decided to act on those threats. When he’d been called out for his words by a local man the criminal had murdered him in his front lawn, dedicated on his corpse, and murdered the man’s wife right in front of his children. He’d then set the house ablaze to get the kids outside and had mutilated the elder child before the cops showed up. It was a horror story and the man still said the same things every time he saw Bob.<br />
<br />
“I don’t like chocolate,” Sam laughed referring to Bob’s own skin tone in a way that sent ice down the officer’s spine.<br />
<br />
“Can it Grey,” Bob ordered before motioning into the cell. The doors were pulled open and Sam rushed Bob. He stood there and took a punch to the face before the other officer’s grabbed the murderer and restrained him.<br />
<br />
“YOU’RE FILTH! THERE’NO PLACE FOR YOU OR YOUR CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY!” Sam screamed as he was dragged down the hall. Bob simply wiped his cheek, he didn’t hit girls.<br />
<br />
Sam continued to struggle once he was strapped in. He began shouting about how the death penalty was gone and made jeering comments about how Bob was a killer just like everyone else with his skin. Bob simply got the officers to leave and was handed a briefcase by one of the lab techs. He opened it to find the needle and several vials of liquid, all varying in colour. Small notes say next to each one regarding their exact effect. The order had been placed by a very specific CEO and like before had been left pretty blank. Certain crucial details were absent and Bob wasn’t about to pass up on a look of horror crossing the racist’s face. He picked up the various vials and began mixing the colours together. His end result was a deep blue liquid that he loaded into the syringe. He then shoved it in Sam’s arm and stepped back.<br />
<br />
It took a few minutes before Sam let out a groan. He shuddered and clenched his fists in pain. His teeth clenched onto his lip as the greasy unwashed colour faded to a natural ivory tone. He gave a shout before shrinking. His arms got smaller, his muscles faded, and soon enough he was just scrawny. He panted and cringed as his hips widened and his shoulders cracked inwards. Fat began to fill his rump and it expanded to a curvy and womanly size. Next his body hair reversed followed quickly by his manhood. The penis pulled back into the convict and she let out a roar when this happened. Then her waist thinned giving her a pear shaped body. Her next addition was the growth of two large breasts on her chest that inflated with each breath she took. Sweat dripped down her frame as her loose clothes shifted around. Then her face rearranged into a beautiful look with a broad nose. Hair shot out of her head becoming a deep brown in colour before her skin tightened and she began to get younger. The deaging stopping when she was roughly twenty five. Sam panted in her seat glaring at Bob for a few seconds before an itch crossed her skin. She paused and looked down before going wide eyed.<br />
<br />
“No! NO!” Sam screamed as the pigment in her skin began to darken. She struggled against her bonds as her skin got darker and darker until she was black. Her eyes cracked open filled with horror and Bob watched as that look of horror faded, replaced by a blank look and drool running out of her mouth. Sam’s last moments in existence had been spent as what he hated.<br />
<br />
Headphones were put on Sam’s head and Bob began inputting commands, sitting down before a microphone and reading out details of her life in monotone from the folder. Sam’s eyes drooped shut and when she opened them she yelped in surprise finding herself in an office building.<br />
<br />
“You’re hired,” the black woman in a suit stated from across the desk. Dam rubbed her head finding her hair was done up and she was wearing a suit. She was there for an internship, she was there for an internship.<br />
<br />
“I’m here for an internship,” Sam repeated while her boss just smiled.<br />
<br />
“Need some water there Samantha?” The woman asked.<br />
<br />
“No.. I need to... I need to get back to work,” Sam replied before stumbling to her feet while intelligence swirled in her brain. She was now a lawyer working in a law firm and unbeknownst to her her boss smiling behind her was the little girl whose family she had killed.</p>
