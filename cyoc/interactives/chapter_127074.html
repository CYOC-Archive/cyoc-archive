<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Randy stood there, steadily swinging the watch back and forth in front of the two mesmerized jocks, thinking about all the things he could do to them. He then looked at the locker room clock and saw that he should probably do something quick, just to be on the safe side.  He knew exactly what he wanted. “What are your names?” Randy asked the two tranced jocks. <br />
<br />
“Jason,” “Sam,” the two jocks said in monotone voices, eyes glazed over and void of any awareness while watching the watch slowly and rhythmically swing back and forth. Jason, clad in nothing but blue shorts was a 6ft 4in stud with broad shoulders, nice large pecks, and coble stone six pack abs, all of which was complimented by a nice bronze evenly tanned skin. He had hazel eyes, short brown hair and a bit of facial hair around his square jaw and chin. Sam, wearing a white t-shirt and jet-black shorts, was a few inches shorter than Jason and not quite as big but he could tell that Sam was just as well built and defined as Jason, from what he could see.<br />
<br />
“Sam, take off your shirt,” Randy commanded. Sam obeyed and slowly peeled of his shirt to reveal his wash board abs, big pecs, and impressive shoulders. His biceps and forearm muscles where large and impressive like Jason’s, though more proportional to his size, and his skin had a nice tan color, but not as tan as Jason’s. His black hair was over an inch longer than Jasons’ with bangs that came a little bit above his sleek eyebrows that seemed to contrast with his Icy-blue eyes. His smooth hairless face was more rounder and softer than Jasons’ more angular features but was angular enough to give him a handsome manly look. The only other features that Randy found that distinguished Sam from Jason was Sams’ legs, which were slightly more muscular and defined than Jasons’, especially his calves, and his butt which was bigger and rounder than Jasons’; not exactly a bubble butt but it was defiantly not flat.<br />
<br />
Randy lustfully grinned at Sams’ nice butt, imagining how better it could look bigger, but quickly started to focus back on the task at hand.<br />
“Jason, what do you think of gays?” Randy asked.<br />
“They are disgusting freaks.” Jason dully mumbled, with a hint of aggression in his tone.<br />
“What do your parents do for a living?”<br />
“Ma likes to volunteer at the food bank but other than that she’s a stay at home mom. My old man is a pastor for the southern Baptist church a few blocks from here.”<br />
‘Figures,’ Randy thought to himself after hearing that last part, rolling his eyes. “Are you religious?” <br />
“No.” Jason replied. ‘I can work with this.’ Randy thought.<br />
<br />
“Sam, what’s your family’s view of gay people?”<br />
“Not sure,”<br />
“Explain,” Randy commanded.<br />
“I’ve never heard my dad say anything about homos and my mom has a gay brother but she doesn’t like to talk about him.” ‘Interesting’ Randy thought, not particularly sure what to think of what Sam said.<br />
“What do you think about ‘homos’?” Randy asked.<br />
“I don’t mind them as long as they don’t try to hit on me or anything.”<br />
“How long have you two known each other?” Randy asked. “Since 3rd grade.” The two jocks responded obediently. ‘Good’ Russel thought to him-self.<br />
<br />
“Both of you listen carefully,” Randy commanded, “With every word I say, the both of you can feel yourselves getting more and more relaxed, more and more entranced, and more and more obedient. You’ll find that everything I say is believable. Everything I say is the truth. Everything that I describe is your reality. Nod your heads if you understand what I’m saying.” Both jocks instantly, but slowly, nodded their heads.<br />
“I want you two to think back on the friendship between the two of you. Think about how you two have had so much fun over the years and how both of you enjoy each other’s company.” As he said this Randy could see a hint of a smile creep on both jocks faces as they briefly remembered all the fond memories between them. “Now, I want you to think about how nice it is to be with each other, how close the two of you are, and how great it feels to greet each other.” The grins on the two jocks start to widen. “You two are so fond of each other sooooo much that over the years your feelings for each other have changed from being friendly to being romantic.”<br />
<br />
As Randy said the last part of his sentence, the two jocks faces slowly changed from happy to confused, but still looking wide eyed and dazed while looking at the swinging watch, with Jason slowly letting out a low “hu?”<br />
<br />
“In grade school you two were best friends but shortly after you guys entered middle school you both noticed that your friendship was starting to get more intimate and your feelings for each other started to grow into a crush. You both tried dating girls, trying to ignore your feelings, but you both found that you just couldn’t make yourselves like girls. Sure some girls are nice looking with their makeup and pretty outfits, but girls aren’t as attractive as men. Girls can be so hard to understand. Girls are just sooooooo different from guys. Don’t you guys find girls to be sooooooooo complicated and verrrrrrry difficult to deal with at times?”<br />
<br />
Both guys slowly nodded their heads and grunted an affirmative “uh-hu,” and “yeah.”<br />
<br />
“Men, on the other hand,” Randy continued, “are much easier to understand. Men aren’t complicated and difficult. Isn’t just sooooooooo much easier to just hang with men, to please men.” The two jocks nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
“Soon after freshman year the two of you just couldn’t hide the truth from your selves or each other anymore and started to accept the fact that not only do you two like each other but that you found yourselves to be more attracted to men than women. Men have such nicer bodies, it’s so much easier to appreciate and admire a mans’ body and features. From their hard-chiseled muscles, rugged facial features, and all the soft contours of their body. You also can’t help but admire another mans’ dick and balls, from the thick loooong shaft to that nice plump smooth head leaking shiny precum and big smooth round low hanging balls. You two can’t help to look and admire an impressive looking groin of another man.”<br />
<br />
Normally the two jocks would have been revaluated by what Randy was saying at this point but under the influence of the watch and Randys’ conditioning the two jocks couldn’t help but nod and make soft grunts of agreement as his words flowed into their heads and solidified in their minds as truth; changing their interests, their perceptions of people, and altering their memories to better fit what Randy was saying. <br />
<br />
“Shortly before starting your sophomore year the two of you started to fully acknowledge the truth that you two are gay and have feelings for each other. If people saw you two together as a couple they would say you two are perfect for each other, but unfortunately you two aren’t open about your sexuality to the public because you’re scared of everyone negatively reacting to you two being gay, especially your parents. You two are always extra sure to maintain a fully hetero appearance from every homophobic comment you’ve ever said to any girls you may have hooked up with was all an act. Granted, there are somethings you two do that you genuinely enjoy like sports.”<br />
<br />
“But whenever you two are alone and are confident that no one will accidently see you two, you guys show your true selves to each other and have your intimate moments like your make out sessions which slowly evolved to the occasional masturbation and hand job sessions over time. Neither of you have ever tried to do anything more sexual than that but you both are always curios about what it would be and feel like to get more intimate with each other; to feel what it’s like to suck each other off and swallow each other’s warm cum. To feel each other’s hard-naked bodies rubbing against each other. To feel your hard-sensitive cock slide into another mans’ tight hole or to feel what it’s like to have your ass slowly penetrated by another mans’ thick hard cock for the first time.”<br />
<br />
The two jocks let out low soft moans of pleasure as they listened to Randy words reprograming their sexuality and vividly imagining what he was saying, stirring and stimulating new found sensations and urges that they had never felt before. Randy felt himself starting to get hard hearing the two jocks moaning and seeing that both were starting to tent underneath their shorts.<br />
<br />
“Do ether of you know a place in the school that’s secluded, hardly anyone knows about, and can be locked from the inside?” Randy asked.<br />
“Yes.” Both jocks answered.<br />
“Where?”<br />
“The small storage room in the back of the locker room?” They both answered again.<br />
Randy took a moment to register the pleasant surprise, and slight shock, of his luck.<br />
“Have you two been in there before?” Randy continued to ask.<br />
“Yes.” Replied the tranced, and partially aroused, jocks.<br />
‘Perfect.’ Randy thought.<br />
<br />
“That storage room in the back of the locker room is where you two like to have your secret intimate moments at school. Always careful to not go there too often to arouse suspicion, to not let anyone see you when you go in there, and to be sure that the door is locked when you two enter.”<br />
<br />
“Now,” Randy continued, “I want you two to close your eyes and take a few moments think about all the good times you’ve had in your secret room and all the things that the two of you like about each other physically and emotionally, still in trance. Whenever you hear your name called you will stop what you are thinking to listen and obey what I have to say. Do you understand?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Obeyed the two jocks.<br />
<br />
“Good,” said Randy, feeling pleased with himself, “Now close your eyes and think about each other.” The two jocks quickly closed their eyes and thought about all the things that made the two love each other, smiling as their brains made new memories of them being together as more than just friends and solidifying their new sexuality. Randy took a moment to look at the two friends turned lovers like a sculptor examining his own finished work, feeling very satisfied, before looking at the clock to see how much time has passed.<br />
<br />
‘Hmmm, might of went a tad overboard with the conditioning.’ Thought Randy seeing that he went a little longer than expected. Thinking fast he pocketed the watch, closed the box that held the watch while making sure that everything in Marks’ locker was as it was before he opened it, and then closed the locker. After taking a minuet to let Jason and Sam relish in their new memories he said, “Jason, Sam, in a moment I’m going to count from one to three and when I reach three you two will wake up from trance and when you do, you two will be two closeted gay jocks as I described previously. Other than that, you two will act and behave like the typical straight jocks that you both normally act like. You will go about your day as you usually do but latter today after practice, when no one’s looking, you two will go to the secret room to make out with each other and forget to lock the door. Furthermore, both of you will have no memory of me opening Marks’ locker or me hypnotizing you two and will only remember talking and getting to know the new transfer student; and finally, Sam, you will feel more comfortable and confidant working out shirtless. Nod if you understand.”<br />
<br />
Both jocks obediently nodded that they understood their commands.<br />
“Good,” said Randy, “one…two…three.”<br />
<br />
The two jocks snapped open their eyes feeling slightly dazed for a moment but thought nothing of it.<br />
“So,” piped up Randy grabbing Jason and Sams’ attention, “What positions do you two play?”<br />
“Oh, I’m quarter back.” Replied Jason.<br />
“and I’m a receiver,” answered Sam.<br />
“Cool. You two getting ready for some running or something?” Randy asked trying to sound casual. “Oh, we were just going to hit the weights before classes started.” Jason replied, “Wana join us?” “Nah, I’m good. Already pumped some iron earlier this morning.” Russel said while flexing his melon sized bicep and flashing a cocky smile. “Cool, well we better get going so we have enough time to get plenty of exercise before classes start. You should seriously consider joining the team, coach would be syked to have someone your size on the team.”<br />
“Not that everyone on the team sucks,” chimed in Sam.<br />
“But the ones that do just suck sooooooo bad that it’s not even funny!” Jason remarked with a hint of annoyance.<br />
“I’ll think about it. What were your names again?”<br />
“Oh, I’m Jason.”<br />
“Sam.”<br />
“Name’s Randy, nice to meet you two. Catch ya on the flipside.” Randy said trying to sound cool.<br />
“Cool, later,” Jason responded before heading off to the weight room with Sam following him giving a quick “See ya,” to Randy before exiting the locker room.<br />
<br />
Randy felt ecstatic over what just happened and the new-found power he possessed. With the power of the watch he could make anyone bend to his will and do more than just make straight jocks gay. Quickly coming back to reality, he remembered what he came into the locker room for but then thought about Mark and wondered how often he uses his locker room locker and how long it will for him to notice his watch was missing. Should he go find Mark first before going to Russel/Simon so he could make sure he would not interfere with him resetting Russel/Simons’ mind or just go straight Russel/Simon and fix him ASAP.<br />
