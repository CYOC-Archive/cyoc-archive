<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We have received many requests for a new transformation and you will go through it with a partner.&quot; the cock-woman said<br />
<br />
&quot;But we don&#39;t have transformations with partners.&quot; Heather said<br />
<br />
&quot;If you had come to work as you should have known about the news. You are going to partner with a newly hired by the company and I believe you will get along very well working together.&quot; the cock-woman said and left the room, returning after a few accompanied by a man that Heather readily recognized as Josh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh? What are you doing here?&quot; Heather asked<br />
<br />
&quot;The company people came to me and offered me the chance to work with you. I was too embarrassed to speak before but I had been fired from my job.&quot; Josh said as he was placed on the machine behind Heather with his back to her, so that she could feel his ass touching hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that everything is ready we can start the live broadcast.&quot; the stick woman said and seeing the couple&#39;s surprised face continued &quot;Its transformation is much awaited and will be broadcast live. We already have thousands waiting to get started.&quot; and pointed to the connected camera in the corner of the room<br />
<br />
Receiving a signal from the creature with the pussy in its face before, the cock-woman turned to the camera and said &quot;Hello everyone, welcome to our broadcast. This is Sally, your favorite cock-woman. As you asked today we will launch our new stars and you will have the chance to see live as they transform.&quot; she approached and said pointing to them &quot;They are Heather and Josh, who will soon transform to never return to normal.&quot; <br />
<br />
She then read some comments from people eager to see what was coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that we have finished reading the comments we are going to the main event, I hope you enjoy and come a lot watching our couple transform&quot; and left the scene.<br />
<br />
Soon a compartment on the machine opened, pouring a colorless and viscous substance. Heather and Josh couldn&#39;t help it and swallowed some of the substance.<br />
<br />
After 1 minute they were released from the machine, yet Heather and Josh were unable to look at each other as their asses had merged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Their transformation is beginning. For this transformation we are using a new technology, the substance that covered them is full of nanomachines that will alter their bodies at the molecular level, making our old equipment totally obsolete.&quot; Sally said<br />
<br />
Josh then doubled over by placing his hands on the floor, his arms quickly turned into a pair of legs and his hands into feet. He realized that he had something different under his new feet and stood up to look, discovering that he had a vagina on the sole of each foot. Josh&#39;s shoulders and chest rearranged to form a new ass.<br />
<br />
Hather and Josh then grew up, their entire bodies except for Josh&#39;s original legs and his cock, until Heather was 16 feet tall and Josh was 8 feet even though he was on all fours. Then Josh&#39;s dick and balls left where they were and ended up between his new legs, turned and doubled up before they grew until there were two 9 foot long cocks and the balls big enough to fit one person inside under him.<br />
<br />
Then Josh&#39;s original legs passed between Heather&#39;s legs and rose in front of her, losing definition and becoming cylindrical until the tip opened to reveal the tip of the 4-foot cocks in front of her that it had become. A huge balls formed between her legs with testicles the size of golf balls. Heather put her hand over it to feel her new bag, especially the irregular shape, realizing that her testicles were too small for her ballsack, but there were several inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think of their new ballsack? In this one we want to innovate and instead of a pair of huge testicles they have a total of 200 testicles the size of golf balls inside.&quot; Sally said, receiving several approval comments afterwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;oon after, Heather&#39;s fingers were absorbed by her hands, which lost definition and the skin opened to show that her arms had also been transformed into dicks. Then three more pairs of breasts grew just below hers and all grew until they were huge even to her new size, and all her nipples turned into vaginas with cocks growing in place of their clitoris.<br />
<br />
Josh, with the string on his butt that belonged to both him and Heather now, could only see the changes through a monitor in front of him. This was not necessary for much longer as his neck stretched to an impressive 15 feet in length, then the skin on his neck stretched so that it covered his entire head, thickened completely, and opened again revealing that his head was now an almost perfect tip of a dick, all he still had of his original face were his eyes.<br />
<br />
Heather&#39;s head also changed with her mouth and nose disappearing and giving way to a vagina, her hair then fell out, revealing a red part with an opening over her head, clearly resembling an urethra. The last change was at least 20 long dick-tipped tentacles that grew on their backs.<br />
<br />
By the end of the transformation, Heather and Josh had become a huge sexual monster, standing on their four feet in their taur form, 8 huge breasts, 13 vaginas (Heather&#39;s original vagina was still there, much larger than before.) and 34 cocks of various sizes across their bodies.<br />
<br />
Both Heather and Josh looked incredulous at the creature they had become. What they do?</p>
