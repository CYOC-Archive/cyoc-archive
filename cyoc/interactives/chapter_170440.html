<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At dawn Alec found that he still had his large breasts. Worse, they didn&#39;t even seem any smaller. <br />
&quot;Very interesting. You appear to have a very high sensitivity to the frog slime. Does this have something to do with the ingredients you need?&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe, you&#39;re the expert. You tell me. But can you fix this now? I&#39;m not looking forward to walking for a whole day with these huge heavy things dangling off of me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I do not have the required components to help you here. Rest assured, I would expect them to disappear by tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not feeling reassured here.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I can give you some support if you want?&quot; Vivian said as she held up two large cloth triangles connected by a thick string from the inner points. From the two remaining points of the triangle a thick strings dangled. &quot;Well? I&#39;m good at this right?&quot;<br />
Alec didn&#39;t want a bra. He was still a guy. <br />
Vivian&#39;s eyes narrowed and her smile faded. &quot;Okay, I can see from your face what you&#39;re thinking. So let me be clear here. You&#39;re going to wear this bra. <br />
I let it slide yesterday because we were in a swamp. But we&#39;re going to be traveling across the open plain, where we&#39;re an easier target. If we get attacked and you just let those huge knockers flop about in a fight, it&#39;s an actual liability. So suck up that manly pride of yours again and put this on. We can help you if you can&#39;t fasten it properly.&quot;<br />
She tossed the bra at him and he reluctantly caught it.<br />
<br />
He struggled to take off his shirt, it had gotten far too tight now with his newfound breast fat. His large breasts painfully flopped free as he pulled it over his head.<br />
He held the makeshift bra before him and found that Vivian had twisted and sowed the bottom a number of times, making it thicker and possibly giving more support. <br />
As he struggled, he suddenly felt someone pull the string tight behind him before tying it together. Vivian stepped out in front of him and grabbed his tits with he cold hands. &quot;Damn, these are heavy. Respect that you let them hang all day yesterday you fool.&quot; She shook and pushed them into the triangles. &quot;There, try this.&quot;<br />
He got up and he had to give it to her. They didn&#39;t hang so painfully from his chest anymore. He could still feel his back and the strings cut into his shoulders, but at least his skin didn&#39;t burn from the weight anymore. He moved to pick up his shirt and, while they still shook it was much more subdued. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t mention it.&quot;<br />
&quot;You really are good at this.&quot; He said with as much smile as he could muster.<br />
&quot;Told you so Tits.&quot;<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t call me that.&quot;<br />
&quot;But it fits you so well right now!&quot; She said as she grabbed Alec chest and shook them. Seeing so much breast flesh moving like a stormy sea would&#39;ve normally hypnotized him, but these were his. He batted her hands away and the flesh slowly came to a halt.<br />
Vivian just winked and smiled in response, before starting to pack her things.<br />
<br />
The trip back looked quite different to Alec, for one he was traveling in the opposite direction, for two he was upright giving him a new perspective on the surroundings.<br />
They made good time and only used the lake campsite for a brief, yet welcome, rest before continuing on. Dark clouds had started forming over head, threatening to make the trip back a lot wetter than the trip towards. However no rain fell. He&#39;d been pretty lucky with the weather at least, maybe there was a god looking out for him. In it&#39;s own strange perverted ways.<br />
Neka was galloping along, occasionally disappearing the tall grass before returning with a mouse or a rabbit before dropping it before Alec&#39;s feet. If he didn&#39;t know any better, she was making fun of his own hunting attempts back in her body when she was still an adult.<br />
There were no good places to stay on the plains as sun slowly started setting. They had no choice but to set up camp in the open.<br />
After dinner Vivian jumped up and clapped her hands &quot;All right, to your feet Alec. We haven&#39;t practiced in far too long.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t feel like practicing with these stupid things.&quot; He motioned at the breasts in his lap.<br />
&quot;Breasts have never stopped any woman from practice, now to your feet mister Tits and let&#39;s see if you remember what I taught you.&quot;<br />
Alec sighed and hoisted himself up. He was really in no mood for this. He just wanted to sleep and wake up the following morning without two sacks of fat dangling from his chest. &quot;I was thinking, how about instead of swordplay you teach me how to throw my knives or use a bow?&quot; <br />
&quot;Why? You don&#39;t have a bow and your swordplay can still use a lot of work.&quot;<br />
&quot;Because when I swap bodies having basic skill in a lot of things might be more useful than being really good at one thing. Had I known how to shoot a bow I could&#39;ve taken the shot at the witch myself instead of risking waking you.&quot; He really had been thinking about that, but he also just really didn&#39;t want to work hard on his form with those stupid heavy tits.<br />
She seemed to consider it before responding. &quot;I&#39;m not sure. Basics in a lot of thing isn&#39;t going to save you when someone with experience tries to run you through. But what you say makes sense as well. Fine, your choice tonight, but I would not recommend slacking off on your swordplay.&quot; <br />
&quot;Let&#39;s try my knives then.&quot; He felt relieved not having to do that dance with Vivian right now.<br />
It seemed so easy in the movies, but he quickly found that there was a lot of technique involved. <br />
<br />
After the practice session they rejoined Andrea at the fire. As Vivian sat down she said &quot;Maybe you should ask Andrea to teach you some spells, in case you ever take over another wizard.&quot;<br />
Alec sat down, resting his breasts in his lap again. Happy to not have to carry that weight on his shoulders and back anymore. &quot;Maybe, that&#39;s not a bad idea.&quot;<br />
Andrea had been studying a wand thoroughly and either didn&#39;t hear or ignored them as she responded &quot;This appears to be a spell displacement wand.&quot;<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; Alec asked staring at the thin wooden rod she was holding.<br />
&quot;A spell displacement wand. If you cast a continuous spell, this allows you to move it without having to recast it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh okay. But wouldn&#39;t it be easier to just recast it?&quot;<br />
&quot;It can be useful if the spell in question is either very difficult or maybe you just made a mistake. Spells cost mana and this could save you a lot of mana.&quot;<br />
&quot;How does that even work? You still have to cast the displacement spell right?&quot;<br />
Andrea sighed, &quot;The idea of a wand is to anchor a prepared spell so it doesn&#39;t cost mana to use next time. Very useful for simpler and/or often used spells. I carry some wands with some minor spells prepared.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why just minor spells? If it&#39;s as simple as preparing them, then why not simply load up a meteor on a wand and get it over with.&quot;<br />
&quot;The more magic the wand needs to contain, the better the components have to be. I can theoretically grab any twig and use it as a wand, but even a simple spell could make it explode as it is no sufficiently strong to handle the strain of magic.&quot;<br />
Alec looked at the thin wand in her hands. &quot;Can I see it?&quot;<br />
She gently extended her arm to hand him the wand. &quot;Please. Do be careful with it.&quot;</p>
