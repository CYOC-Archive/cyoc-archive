<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer tossed and turned during her slumber. She’d gone to bed at only 4 PM, but she slept until her alarm went off the next morning. Unbeknownst to her, Susan had been making more changes.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
<br />
Jennifer woke up in a daze. She looked around her room. There were a bunch of posters of naked women, along with her familiar sex toy collection. <br />
<br />
<br />
“Isn’t this kinda trashy? I don’t remember having these big boob models all over my—-“ Jennifer said, before she felt a headache come on.<br />
<br />
Blinking, she wondered what she’d been so worried about. She glanced at one of her beloved posters. “Such a nice pair of tits!” She said, licking her lips. “But not as good as mine.”<br />
<br />
She walked over to her mirror and admired her topless breasts. Big, firm M cups. Bigger than Martha’s wonderful fake tits. Almost as big as her mom’s - and natural, just like Susan’s. “Wait, why am I naked?” She thought, before that annoying headache came back. She always slept naked, what was she thinking?<br />
<br />
She walked to her attached bathroom and warmed up the shower. Of course, Martha had left her fresh towels and an outfit for the day.<br />
<br />
Jennifer took a long, sensual shower, masturbating with the wand attachment. After making herself orgasm a couple of times, Jennifer rinsed off and got dressed.<br />
<br />
A G string, a tight pair of yoga pants, and a tube top with no bra. The perfect outfit in Jennifer’s mind. She loved the way her nipples poked through the top.<br />
<br />
She blinked. Had she always been this… trashy? That fuzzy feeling came once more. Someone… a mentor had taught her that people who think “sexy” is “trashy” is because they’re ugly and jealous. Jennifer was beautiful and loving. She needed to show off her body.<br />
<br />
But who was that mentor? As Jennifer pulled on some flat shoes, she looked over at her night stand. A picture made her headache come back for a split second.<br />
<br />
Of course! How could she forget?? Her step mom! Felicia taught her everything she needed to know about anything. Jennifer and Thea had no relationship, and Susan was too busy getting off to do much. However, Jennifer didn’t blame Susan - Susan provided for her, and she knew her mom loved her, even if she loved her own dick even more.<br />
<br />
Jennifer walked downstairs, pinching Martha on the ass and giving her a long, sensual kiss.<br />
<br />
“See you later, Martha. Gotta get to class.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
Martha looked a bit disappointed when Jennifer broke the kiss. However, the maid didn’t dare speak up. “See you tonight, Miss Jennifer!” She said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Jennifer walked out to take the bus when—<br />
<br />
There was that damn headache again. She fished through her purse and found the keys to the luxury car Susan had bought her. She started the engine and took off.<br />
<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
<br />
At a stoplight, Jennifer looked at a billboard in shock.<br />
<br />
A topless woman had her large breasts covered only by another woman’s hands. The other woman’s head was resting on her shoulder from behind.<br />
<br />
The text at the top read “They’re real if you can touch ‘em!” and at the bottom said “Sultry Smith’s, now hiring: ask about our generous enhancement program.”<br />
<br />
How could something like this be made? It was softcore porn! And her mom was the one that—-<br />
<br />
Buzzing. Pain. Warmth. That familiar headache had come in. Jennifer was staring at an average billboard from her mom’s company. Why?<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s Beth’s mom! That’s right.” Jennifer said, chuckling to herself. Beth was Jennifer’s best friend. Lucille, Beth’s mother, was a higher up in Sultry Smith’s, and her wife, Diana, was a gynomorph that Susan particularly liked dominating.<br />
<br />
Jennifer noticed the light turn green and continued driving to school.<br />
<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, she arrived. There were only a couple weeks left of school at this point, and then she’d be a high school graduate. Jennifer’s birthday was in July, so she’d be 19 soon, too. Her and Felicia would have to celebrate. “Mmm, Felicia…” Jennifer thought, groping her breast. However, a knock on her window snapped her out of it.<br />
<br />
She rolled it down and saw Beth… with big breasts. Had… had they always been that big? They were at least F cups, and they were definitely fake. Beth was wearing a cleavage bearing shirt, and Jennifer looked right down her top, feeling even more aroused.<br />
<br />
<br />
“You like em? I just got cleared to come back to school. The enhancement program really paid off! It’s so generous of your mom to extend the program to families, too. I think I’m gonna do my ass next.” Beth said.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt that headache again before remembering that Beth used to be flat as a board, but that she was taking time off to get implants.<br />
<br />
“They look great!” Jennifer said, getting out of her car. She passionately kissed Beth, who happily reciprocated.<br />
<br />
Breaking the kiss, Beth looked sensually at Jennifer.<br />
<br />
“So, who else are you gonna choose?” She said.<br />
<br />
“Choose? Choose for what?” Jennifer asked, dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
“Um, duh. Your team of whores. Your mom told you to bring at least four when your step-MILF lets you take over BunCorp.” Beth said.<br />
<br />
Jennifer had the strongest headache of them all at that moment. Clutching her head, she desperately tried to remember. She was supposed to go to college, right? She wanted to be a teacher and—-<br />
<br />
<br />
That was a silly thought! What did she need college for? Her mom was rich enough for her to do whatever she wanted, and Felicia was letting her become the CEO of BunCorp right after her birthday. “Silly me! You’re right, I do need to pick some more sluts to keep around.” Jennifer said, smacking Beverly’s ass.<br />
<br />
Beverly leaned in on Jennifer’s arm, her fake tits squeezing around it. Jennifer loved the way they felt.<br />
<br />
“So, who else? Brandy, obviously. But who else?” Beverly said.<br />
<br />
“Brandy? Who’s Brandy?” Jennifer thought.<br />
<br />
Another headache. Jennifer’s boyfriend, Brad, captain of the football team changed. In his place was another gynomorph. Long, black hair. D cup breasts, natural and ready for enhancement. A nice, plump ass. A tiny little three inch cock, with fat egg sized balls. An asshole perfect for Jennifer to fuck with a strap on like she’d done so many times before.<br />
<br />
In fact, there were no men in town. Glendale had become populated completely by women, some with vaginas, some with cocks. Jennifer didn’t know what she’d been thinking.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, I’ll get back to you on it. Let’s get to class. We need to look good for the last couple of weeks.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, right. Your mom could buy this school if she wanted to. You wanna skip instead?” Beverly said, looking into Jennifer’s eyes.</p>
