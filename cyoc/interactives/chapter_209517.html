<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a long, cold night outside in Amsterdam. The well lit, close packed hostels, buildings and locales however kept things from being at all unwelcoming, however. The sky was dark, the moon was fat, and the stars lit up the sky. The many travelers and backpackers keen on enjoying Europe&#39;s premier party city were on their way toward their destination now if not already there. It would be a long and enjoyable night for all involved. There were whispers of a new kind of &quot;service&quot; offered by some of the working ladies in the city however. Something that the authorities were as of yet curious about - but didn&#39;t know if they wanted to pursue.<br />
<br />
It sounded like something from some sort of story of fantasy, a thing to draw in the most daring and some might say gullible travelers. Rumors of a kind of sexual service combined with some form of magic - a reward for stamina if nothing else, but an experience that would prove transformative for those who undertake it.<br />
<br />
The truth, whatever it might be, remained in the confidence of the ladies of the night. Those who walked the streets and dwelled in the heady brothels were in no mood to spoil what had become known as a prolific earning service for those willing to put up with some of the more bizarre and unorthodox results. <br />
<br />
For this alleged service most often drew repeated audiences and loyal buyers, eager to experience what was truly one of the most unique services available. Despite its popularity, there were some stories of some truly unusual transformative experiences. That some didn&#39;t entirely enjoy what was done to them, even when the changes faded after six hours. Long enough most nights to suffice as the rest after a long and sordid sexual episode.<br />
<br />
This sexual service is, indeed, one that as the talented - and some might say magical - practitioner works her sexual gift upon the individual, that person would slowly transform. There seemed to be an element of randomness to it. Some people simply grew more muscular, stronger, and more handsome - becoming more virile versions of themselves. Others changed into the opposite sex. Still others turned riotously into animals, their human mind intact within their new animalistic form. There were even some allegations of stranger changes yet. The changes would slowly work themselves on the person in question, and finish when that person experiences their orgasm. The transformation would go longer the greater the stamina the person who changed had - and according to many, the changes themselves felt simply amazing.<br />
<br />
Despite what one might think of such a change, all accounts - however reliable they are - allege the change is very, very pleasing indeed. The change continues however long the talented harlot is in physical contact with the person. Though even if she pleases another in the room, if someone ends up achieving orgasm independently, they barrel toward their ultimate transformation.<br />
<br />
Such is the nature of this alleged transformative pleasure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let us see, then,&quot; the winds fly through the streets, &quot;One group of young men and their introduction to it...?&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
The group from the United States at the Emrath Hotel in Amsterdam consisted of five friends - all eager to experience the world before they had to return to the States to begin their next college years. Why not acquire the maximum amount of pleasure possible before returning to the obligation to begin their studies...? Of course, them being modern day Americans, they had their skepticism about this purported &quot;sexual spell&quot;, but having heard the rave reviews in the pubs they couldn&#39;t not try it at least once...<br />
<br />
Though the set up for the occasion was ruffling a few feathers.<br />
<br />
The five young men sat in a rough semi-circle on five chairs, all naked and awaiting their &quot;lady&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why,&quot; Peyton asked as he crossed his arms in front of his bare chest, &quot;Do we have to be naked all at once for this? This is way more homoeroticism than I&#39;d bargained for on this trip.&quot; Seated at the middle chair in the generously sized room was Peyton Gilbert. He was a bushy brown haired, lean and muscular young man with matching brown eyes - something of the local playboy. He&#39;d lost track how many women he&#39;d slept with - and he&#39;d been quite keen on getting some financial benefit from his good looks and muscular if not bulky body...<br />
<br />
&quot;Peyton, you have an Onlyfans. I think half your followers are gay men that hope against hope they can get with you. Besides...chillax. This is Europe. Nobody&#39;s gonna take issue with this.&quot; Seated to Peyton&#39;s left was Jonathan Bryant, a blond haired, blue eyed All American Face of a linebacker, handsome and well formed. He was larger and more beefy than Peyton, but that came with being much less toned. His pecs, shoulders, back, legs and arms all bulged with muscles...but his midsection puffed out in a prodigious gut. Whereas Peyton tried to cover up, Jonathan leaned back into his chair and gladly showed off his body. As far as he was concerned, he had nothing to be nervous about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bro...just relax, the lady&#39;s gonna be here soon. You don&#39;t wanna get any dysfunction, do you?&quot; Calum Rivas simply rested arms down on his chair, his long black hair somewhat greasy and hanging a bit in his face, green eyes glancing around. Calum was something of the group stoner - his form was thin, willowy, and not exactly athletic by comparison to the other guys. While he covered with his usual detachment, Calum had something of an interest in the way the night&#39;s events might go - for some reason, the idea of Jonathan transforming in some wild way had him pretty excited - not that he would show it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there any way to make sure that we don&#39;t uh---end up like, girls for the next six hours or anything? I mean, I&#39;m just saying---&quot; Joshua Keller covered his groin with his leg as he sat in his chair. The light brown haired, blue eyed Joshua was deeply closeted bisexual, and would rather never admit it - he was one among those people so interested in Peyton. He always more energetically involved himself in the group&#39;s chase for pussy - all in order to make it less obvious that when they had sex close by each other, he&#39;d be every bit as interested in his lady friend as he was in the pumping, muscular ass of his good friend.<br />
<br />
Luke Cooper spoke up from his seat, &quot;Guys, just calm down. We&#39;re here to have a good time, and so far we&#39;ve banged the hottest babes in Amsterdam. We gotta try this.&quot; Luke had been a male cheerleader at their old high school, and fittingly had a thin but very fit, athletic body, fit for the dynamic maneuvers of cheer squad. Despite the stereotype, and the fact that Luke was among the more androgynously handsome of the group, he was among the most sexually active of the group - largely with the cheer squad. It didn&#39;t hurt that, despite his lithe and effeminate look, he had a very sizable manhood indeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m just supposed to be all good sitting in an---an arrangement with a bunch of naked dudes?&quot; Peyton asked, &quot;How am I supposed to---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Peyton. We all signed up for this. Would we be pranking you if we&#39;d end up caught up in the prank?&quot; Jonathan smiled and looked toward the door, hearing something - someone coming up toward the doorway, &quot;Well. It seems our entertainment is almost here. You fellas ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready!&quot; Though Peyton&#39;s statement to the fact was less enthusiastic than the others. He figured he was just nervous. Worried that something might happen. He&#39;d admittedly gotten a bit of a complex about himself, thanks to his OF data. But he figured that was something to think about when he wasn&#39;t about to engage in this grand sexual episode.<br />
<br />
The door slowly opened up before long, and a gorgeous Dutch girl walked in. Her golden blond hair cascaded down past her neck, her body was lithe and athletic, breasts making a sizable impression through her cocktail dress. She looked every bit the high class hooker. And true to form, hiring her had taken quite a little bit out of Jonathan&#39;s trust fund allowance. Her slate light blue eyes looked around the room, and she spoke up in a calm, confident voice, &quot;Party of five, paid for by Jonathan Bryant? I&#39;m Adriana, I&#39;ll be your lady of the night for the evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be us.&quot; Jonathan piped up from his seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to know. I always verify to make sure I&#39;m not doing this to someone who doesn&#39;t know...&quot; She then walked forward, sitting in the middle of the room, knowing as she did she was being glanced at in libidinous fashion by the guys. &quot;You&#39;ve likely heard about the Service of Mutatio. Or...whatever it&#39;s called by the daring travelers. I&#39;m quite gifted in it, and I can tell you guys what you&#39;re in for.&quot;<br />
<br />
She breathed, seeming to ready herself for the night&#39;s events, &quot;I trust you all know how it works, right? The moment you cum, the transformation will all hit you in a hurry. As I touch you, and give you pleasure, the changes will slowly build up. They&#39;ll feel really, really good. So try and control yourselves if you want this to really take...&quot; She seemed to pause, and then recalled something, &quot;Ah, yes. The transformation - from the moment it completes - will last six hours. Then you will revert to your normal form. Once you start in on one transformation, that&#39;s the one you complete when I&#39;m done. When I resume with you, you&#39;ll continue on what I started before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nods around the room. Peyton glanced around, suddenly feeling a bit worried about this. She was gonna do this. And nobody knew what kind of transformation it was gonna be until the changes were...what, some degree of the way done? Would she just go to town on one guy until he was done? &quot;So uh. Are you just gonna transform us all one by one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no. No. I&#39;ll give you guys five minutes of my time, and then I&#39;ll move on to the next. Do try and control yourselves during that five minutes, mm?&quot; Adriana nodded, and looked around. &quot;Any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I be first?&quot; Jonathan asked with a cocky chuckle. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure since I&#39;m paying I deserve that. But...also, will anything happen to our minds?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your minds will be informed by whatever instincts of the form you end up in, but you&#39;ll be in complete control. The instincts will inform, but not overpower.&quot; Adriana then nodded and said, &quot;I believe that&#39;s fine. And besides. I figure you fine folks need a demonstration of what&#39;s to come.&quot; <br />
<br />
Luke glanced at Josh, noting the guy&#39;s interest in the proceedings with a wry smile - as if he knew what was going on with the closeted young man. Calum, meanwhile, leaned forward as Adriana started toward the still unshakably confident Jonathan. It should be interesting at least to see what ended up becoming of the big, tough jock. Adriana knelt down, deciding to start her five minutes of pleasure on Jonathan with fellatio - and Jonathan...</p>
