<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rusty enjoyed what he had done, not to mention the thrill of being a werewolf. This was amazing and his dream self was right, Rusty would not give this up... especially not if he had any say in it. The new werewolves looked at Rusty, wanting to go and change all the men in the wing as soon as possible, so that the estate could be their permanent werewolf den. Rusty nodded, the energy from the portal diminished, revealing the main door back to the men&#39;s wing. To be sure Marcia would not be able to interfere, Rusty used the energy to remove all of the doors from the partitioning wall between their wing and the rest of the estate. Ensuring this was so, Rusty saw that the door Marcia and Christine went through was still gone, then when he went to the main hall, Rusty saw that the doors were all gone.<br />
<br />
Rusty howled loudly, proud of himself for taking Marcia out of the picture so that he could continue his personal mischief. Dropping down to all fours, making his traversing the men&#39;s wing faster and more efficient, Rusty hurried so that Ben and David would not have all the fun. However, Rusty knew it was his work ultimately, even if it was vicariously accomplished by his two new werewolf brothers.<br />
<br />
Getting to the main area of the wing, Rusty noticed that Ben and David had already made short work of the men that were out in the open. Several of the male staff were either just beginning their transformations or they were just finishing up, only to go and do the same to the normies. Rusty smiled, knowing that this was a fast takeover, but then a certain scent wafted to his moist and leathery black nose. Immediately, Rusty recognized that the smell was fear and it was very close to where he was. Returning to two feet, the more human stance, Rusty slowly moved while sniffing the air tracking down his prey. Suddenly there was a stronger waft of the smell and Rusty jerked his head to the right, then saw the door. Rusty moved quickly, kicking down the door and then growled.<br />
<br />
Rusty moved slowly into the room, enjoying the more intense scent, getting stronger every second. When Rusty was in the main part of the room, he saw a huge lump in the bed sheets and chuckled at the feeble attempt to conceal himself from the werewolves. Standing at the foot of the bed, Rusty yanked the bedding away and revealed the man who was so fearful of what he would inevitably become. He was a thirty-five year old, medium tanned, well-built man with dark brown hair with streaks of black hair scattered, making it appear even darker. The man had powerful hands that looked soft at the same time and realized that the man must have been a masseuse. Rusty chuckled again and just stood there looking over the man&#39;s muscles that were also nicely covered in his normal body hair. The man eventually stopped shaking and just sat there, wondering why the savage animal before him had not made quick work of him like the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you afraid of me human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... what... do you want from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That depends on what you want. I will give you a choice human, just because I think the world doesn&#39;t need to lose another attractive man like yourself, since it is full of ugly people. I want strong men to become werewolves in my army to make this place for ourselves. What is to happen after the portal is safe, I am not sure, but... we will deal with that later. You can either leave the estate and my brothers will know not to harm you or you can stay and become one of us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens to me either way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you leave, your life is yours to do as you please... as long as you don&#39;t come back here. If you stay, I can make you like me and you will enjoy what it has to offer. I will say, I am hoping that you stay because if you do... I will make you my second in command, even though I changed Ben and David first. What do you say, human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will stay here and be like you Rusty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... how did you know it was me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since the portal has been open, I have had strange dreams and you were in them, both as you are now and as your human self but after the transformation. You and I are always together, but I never knew why or what happened to get us to be in that form of a bond.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... in that case...&quot; Rusty trailed off with a big grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Rusty placed his knee on the bed and slyly crawled up to where the man still sat. With the end of his muzzle within a hairbreadsth of the man&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your move human!&quot;<br />
<br />
The man looked Rusty dead in the eyes, smiled and bore his neck to the werewolf. &quot;By the way, my name&#39;s Chad, and the move is now yours!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rusty chuckled then brought his clawed paw to Chad&#39;s handsome face, turning it to look him in the eyes, then Rusty planted a deep kiss on Chad with Chad&#39;s eyes widening quickly from the unexpected kiss. Chad wasn&#39;t gay, but he didn&#39;t mind the kiss either for some reason and it made him relax entirely. As Rusty pulled off the deep kiss, he pricked Chad&#39;s tongue, infecting him immediately.<br />
<br />
By the time Chad could say &quot;Ow!&quot; he was already changing and within minutes, Chad was a werewolf like Rusty. Chad looked himself over, liking the fur that matched his human head of hair, not to mention his slightly bigger muscles that could have even rivaled Rusty&#39;s. Happy with the turn of events, the two howled together and walked out of the room. Rusty looked down and saw a huge number of werewolves all ready and waiting for his command. Rusty then looked over to the newly changed Chad quizzically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you have worked with everyone here I am assuming, is this everyone for the men?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Rusty, this is everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, then we are ready to make our move and take this place for ourselves. Long live the portal!&quot;<br />
<br />
At the end of Rusty&#39;s words, all the werewolves howled together in perfect harmony. This was the moment that would define the new species, but more over... Rusty wondered if he could end Marcia&#39;s life when push came to shove.</p>
