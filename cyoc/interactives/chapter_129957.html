<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Every time I saw Jessie, I have to confess, my blood started to boil. She was a bully, and seemingly proud of it. I couldn&#39;t wait to become her, to make everyone think she was a saint, and then watch as she struggled to make sense of it all. It wasn&#39;t quite the revenge I had envisioned, but neither me nor my friend Jeff would get in trouble because of it.<br />
<br />
But there was time to think of this later. Right now, I was heading to one of my favorite classes, Literature. The teacher was one Ms. Penny Podaski, a tall, dark-haired woman who looked like she was auditioning for a role in a high school drama. Pardon the pun, but I had great expectations for today&#39;s class.<br />
<br />
Until that class actually started. We were supposed to be reading the Crucible, but less than 10 pages in, most of the class was dozing off or had otherwise stopped listening. Ms. Podaski clearly noticed, but instead of trying to get people to focus up, she just kept reading as though she were the only person in the room. It was almost merciful when the bell finally rung and everyone took off. <br />
<br />
Later that day, I heard the soft sound of crying coming from the Literature classroom. Inside, Ms. Podaski was drunk off her ass from a bottle of wine, sobbing into a hard-backed textbook. I asked her what was wrong, and while translating her drunken rants was a little difficult, I managed to piece together that she was indeed a former actress who had started a new career, and this was her first actual job as a teacher. But she clearly couldn&#39;t do it, so she was going to quit and find something else to do. I felt sorry for her, and it was then that the wheels started spinning in my head. I asked Ms. Podaski if she would be willing to let me try something for tomorrow&#39;s class. Still boozed up, she agreed.<br />
<br />
Ms. Podaski arrived for class the next day in a form fitting dress, the top down slightly to expose her cleavage, and she had on makeup that showed off her high cheekbones, perky lips, and shaped eyebrows. Her long black hair was tied back in a ponytail. The new look clearly had the intended effect, because everyone was staring up at her the moment she entered. Now she had to keep their attention. <br />
<br />
How? Simple. Through interpretative methods. Today&#39;s section of the Crucible was one of the most important scenes, where John Proctor was accused of bringing a witch into court. For this, several girls were needed to scream their heads off, run around, and generally as though they&#39;d been possessed. And boy, did the girls have fun with that!!<br />
<br />
In the back, quietly scribbling notes, was a very nondescript, quiet woman. She had an oval face, with a similar facial structure as Ms. Podaski, glasses that needed a good cleaning, and hair that was also long, but with a tinge of blonde. Her name was Alma Greenmere, and she was one of the two vice principals at our school. Because Ms. Podaski had experienced some trouble with her first day, she was reviewing her teaching style today.<br />
<br />
Class ended, and everyone left except for Ms. Podaksi and Ms. Greenmere. The latter packed up her notes, as if she was ready to leave. She then walked over to the former.<br />
<br />
Ms. Podaski was expecting a congratulations or some words of praise, but instead Ms. Greenmere bent over, grabbed her face, and kissed her right on the lips. Ms. Podaski was surprised, but soon she kissed her back. A hand found its way up her dress, to where her thong was, and started to gently pull it down, exposing her wet pussy. Just as Ms. Podaski was getting ready to rip her clothes off, the door started to open. Ms. Greenmere panicked, and in trying to break loose, tripped and fell right on top of her lover. Somehow in the process, both of their faces were torn off, leaving me in Ms. Podaski&#39;s now ill-fitting dress and stockings, and the real teacher in a cheap blouse and jeans.<br />
<br />
Had our guest been anyone but Jeff, we would have been screwed. But it was him, he was able to patch up the damage to our faces so we could put them back and leave the school with out anyone noticing.<br />
<br />
Ms. Podaski, still dressed as the vice principal, thanked me for my help. She was going to take charge of the classroom tomorrow, and prove to me that she was capable of change. She also apologized for trying to get in my pants, but apparently my look was too sexy for her to resist. <br />
<br />
I forgave her and gave her a quick kiss. She asked me if I wanted Ms. Greenmere&#39;s face back, but I told her to keep it. It never hurt to have an ally in the school administration.</p>
