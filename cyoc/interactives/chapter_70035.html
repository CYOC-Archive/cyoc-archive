<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David arrived at just after 10pm and headed straight to the bar. He wasn’t really sure why he’d come. He <br />
didn’t really want to see Tony and be reminded of what was going to happen to him so...was it just because <br />
he’d been told to and he liked following orders? He didn’t normally – David always liked to know why he was <br />
doing something. At work this was easy: “paying customers want their food dammit!” in the words of Mrs Somers. <br />
But tonight...he hadn’t bothered to ask himself that question. He shrugged it off.<br />
<br />
The barman turned to him and said “Hey bud, what can I get you?”<br />
<br />
He was cute, David noticed, frowning as soon as he realised he’d thought a man was cute. But he was: trendy <br />
blonde hair, button nose, butt-chin, obviously worked out, tanned...David almost asked him for a Screaming <br />
Orgasm but stopped himself.<br />
<br />
“I’ll just have a beer,” David said instead. Immediately he was shocked the words had come out of his mouth – <br />
he hated beer! Why the hell had he ordered that? Oh well, may as well take it in case I appear rude, he <br />
thought. While the barman poured it, David focussed on the girl standing at the bar next to him. She was tall, <br />
slender, wearing a very flattering black dress that showed off her tits and ass. And David felt nothing. <br />
‘Fuck,’ he thought. While he didn’t mind everything else that was happening to him that much he really wasn’t <br />
keen on becoming gay. Was it worth it to look like he’d always wanted?<br />
<br />
The barman soon returned with the beer. David paid, and took a sip, almost reeling back in surprise. This <br />
was....this was good! Really good! Refreshing and malty, the bubbles tickling his throat – before he realised <br />
he’d had half the pint. Better slow down, he thought.<br />
<br />
Just then he felt a buzz in his pocket. Taking his phone out he saw a text:<br />
‘Booth by the jukebox. Tony’<br />
<br />
David immediately went over, and he saw Tony’s eyes casting the room. David was only a few steps away and he <br />
was still scanning for someone he recognised. He still looked like himself though...didn’t he?<br />
<br />
“Tony,” David said when he was at the booth.<br />
<br />
Tony looked up and was visibly surprised, “Holy shit man, David?! You look totally different, come here <br />
fuckhead!” he said as he threw his arms around him in a big bear hug. David was surprised how familiar Tony <br />
was with him, and how at ease he in turn felt around Tony. He breathed in the musky scent from Tony as they <br />
hugged – fuck he smelled good! He felt his dick stirring as he thought that, and Tony obviously noticed.<br />
<br />
“Wow, packing down there aren’t we?” he said as they sat down.<br />
<br />
“Hehe yeah,” David replied, “Measured today, eleven inches.”<br />
<br />
“Eleven? You’re shitting me man, at two weeks in! How big were you before?!”<br />
<br />
“Seven.”<br />
<br />
“Shit....I bet you’ll be a fucking monster. All over I mean man – I mean look at you! You must be what, two-<br />
ten already?”<br />
<br />
“Two-twenty,” David replied, flexing a bicep as he spoke.<br />
<br />
“Fuck....man you got me sprung. Gonna need to do something about that later...anyway, I just thought it’d be <br />
good for us to catch up. You’re going through some big changes, in more ways than one, and I thought I’d try <br />
offer what advice I can. Did you see the card I left you?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I checked the website. What’s the New Man Initiative?”<br />
<br />
Tony took a sip of his drink and smiled, “A science experiment gone wrong. Sounds all comic book-y but it’s <br />
totally true. Some scientist in Indiana wanted to try cure obesity and he thought – hey, at the same time why <br />
not make everyone more attractive? Cos let’s be honest, that health bullshit is at most 50% of the reason <br />
people want to lose weight, the rest is image. So he makes this virus in his lab which is meant to infect host <br />
bodies, turn the fat into as-close-to individual atoms as possible, and then give instructions to use the <br />
atoms to make the host more attractive, different instructions depending on gender, you know. Wouldn’t want to <br />
give a guy huge knockers right?<br />
<br />
“So he sends his report to the government and asks for funding. Gets flat turned down. Seven times. He gets <br />
desperate. So late one night, when he’s at his lowest low, this guy fills a syringe with the virus, plunges it <br />
into his forearm, and...nothing – well, not straight away anyway.<br />
<br />
“Now you can guess what happened. This scientist, who was an ordinary family man, wife and two kids, God-<br />
fearing, middle-aged, workaholic, bit of a belly and never went to the gym – over the course of a few weeks he <br />
turns into a muscular gay guy who has no interest in his wife any more, and is finding men more and more <br />
attractive. Now when the guy realises what’s going on, he’s understandably terrified. He’s 45 years old, known <br />
exactly who he was all his life, and then – bam! Everything changes as-near-as-can-be overnight. So he runs <br />
out on his family, his work, everything. Comes right out here and, again, while feeling pretty low, realised <br />
he needed sex. Not just a normal need when you’re real horny, but as in if he didn’t have sex like now he was <br />
going to die. I’ve been there once or twice, I swear to God that’s what it feels like. So he runs out of his <br />
apartment and sees this homeless guy on the street. Now I’m warning you David, when these kinda primal urges <br />
take over you’ll do anything – and I mean ANYTHING – to satisfy them. He didn’t kill him if that’s what you’re <br />
wondering but it isn’t much to be proud of.<br />
<br />
“So the scientist goes up to the homeless guy – mid-twenties, down on his luck, poor guy – offers him a <br />
thousand dollars if he’ll suck him off. The homeless guy isn’t too pleased about this, he hadn’t been on the <br />
streets too long and he’d done alright so far, was hoping he’d be able to avoid prostitution. But he needed <br />
the money so he reluctantly went into a back alley with the scientist, and gave him oral to the best of his <br />
ability. He’d never done it before but he thought he’d probably need to swallow to get the whole thou’. So the <br />
scientist cums, and then takes the homeless guy in, gives him food and shelter, explains what’s going to <br />
happen to him and helps him through it. He knew the change was going to happen instinctively, but he only <br />
found out afterwards that the virus is sexually transmitted – at first he thought it was confined to him. But <br />
the scientist realised that at least there was some good he could do with this and help guys adjust to their <br />
new lives as easily as possible.<br />
<br />
“So as you’ve probably guessed, the scientist was Matthias Coren, the guy who made the website on the card, <br />
calling it the New Man Initiative to sound all legit.”<br />
<br />
David thought for a minute, mulling over the story, “Ok...but how do you know so much about the homeless guy?”<br />
<br />
Tony grimaced a little and stared into his drink, replying, “That was, erm...me. Actually I used to go by Ant <br />
but after the change I preferred Tony, brought out the Italian look in me. I mean as far as I know no-one in <br />
my family’s Italian, but this change somehow brought out some in me, don’t you think? Some guys change their <br />
names completely but most change it just a little bit – it’s hard to live with the same name but a different <br />
body. <br />
<br />
“But see for me, this change and how it happened was a huge life preserver for me. I never would have survived <br />
on the streets I’m sure, but with looks like these I do some modelling, some acting, some porn, all sorts. So <br />
I count myself lucky really.”<br />
<br />
After a little pause to let all that sink in, David asked, “The website couldn’t say for certain how I’d <br />
change. Is everyone pretty similar?”<br />
<br />
“So far as we know. We think about twenty guys total have changed so far, including you, and as the website <br />
says none of them change in quite the same way. Everyone gets better hung, goes gay and needs to change other <br />
guys. Most guys seem to put on muscle, but not all at the same rate. Until I changed you I held the record for <br />
most muscle gained, I’m pretty sure you’re going to beat me easily! Some guys get fatter, and it seems like <br />
everyone either puts on muscle, or fat, or both. So we’ve got some real svelte bodybuilders in our ranks, some <br />
big fat daddies and muscle bears in between. I got some hair growth and that’s pretty common, a bit over half <br />
of guys get hairier. We’ve had one guy go from being Scandinavian to like Latino, another from African to <br />
Japanese, but racial changes are quite rare, I think there’s just those two at the moment. And that’s all we <br />
know for sure right now, there may be the scope for other changes we haven’t seen yet. But enough about us, <br />
let’s talk about you fucker, what’s happened to you?”<br />
<br />
“Well I’ve put on a bit of muscle-“<br />
<br />
“A bit? Dude you’re a house! I can’t wait to see how big you get,” Tony interrupted with a cocky wink.<br />
<br />
David giggled in reply, he felt very warm and a bit nervous talking to Tony, but he carried on, “My dick’s <br />
grown, I’m thinking less about girls and more about guys. I don’t like that and I’m trying to hold onto being <br />
straight, but it doesn’t feel like it’s working,” he thought for a moment, there was something he was <br />
missing...oh yes, “And I’m finding it harder to concentrate on stuff. I’m getting orders wrong at work, I <br />
forget things. I used to like crosswords, but I tried one today and I got bored real easy...if I think too <br />
hard my head hurts so I just shrug it off...I think that’s it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh that last one’s interesting – is David getting dumber?” Tony said with a big grin, “Now that’s a new one. <br />
That’ll be fun, can’t wait for it. Were you smart before?”<br />
<br />
“I guess so, did well at college but couldn’t get a job I wanted so I wait tables waiting for something to <br />
come up.”<br />
<br />
“And you’re fucking up waiting tables now? Fuck Dave, you’re going to be dumb as shit by the end of the month, <br />
haha. Well that might be all you get, or there could be something else. I only got the hair growth in the <br />
middle of my fourth week, just woke up one morning and I’d gone from smooth as a baby to covered in hair. I <br />
didn’t think I’d like it but I do, so it got me wondering if I just liked it because it was me or if the virus <br />
changed what I like, just like it did with my orientation...anyway I think that’s all I need to let you know, <br />
but there’s one thing I wanna do before I go.”<br />
<br />
“What’s that?” David asked.<br />
<br />
Tony smiled and lent in close, “See that monster cock of yours, of course.”<br />
<br />
And with that, Tony went into the bathroom, beckoning David to follow. David was unsure at first, but he felt <br />
strange, like he needed to be near Tony. So he drained the rest of his pint and ran into the bathroom, locking <br />
the door behind him.<br />
<br />
“Alright fucker,” Tony said, “Let’s see it.”<br />
<br />
David undid the tight jeans and pulled them down as quickly as he could over his big ass and legs. Suddenly <br />
though, his semi-hard dick flopped out, by now nine inches of power, which Tony looked at enviously. He drew <br />
closer to David and slowly kissed him on the lips, before slowly moving down his body to kiss his dick.<br />
<br />
“Won’t it change you?” David asked.<br />
<br />
“You only change once – me and Coren found that out early on,” Tony replied with a grin, before slowly taking <br />
David’s quickly-hardening cock in his mouth and sucking on it earnestly.<br />
<br />
“No...no....Ooohhh fuucckkkk,” David moaned as muffled moans came from Tony – he swore he heard the big man <br />
laugh but he couldn’t tell, Tony’s mouth was too full of cock to make out any words.<br />
<br />
David felt incredible – he knew even as a virgin that Tony was an expert cocksucker, and within minutes he was <br />
ready to cum.<br />
<br />
“Fuck Tony are you ready?” he asked as he wrapped his hands around his head and moaned in pleasure as his cum <br />
shot into Tony’s throat. While David was still breathing heavily from a first class suck, Tony came up and <br />
gargled with David’s cum before swallowing and licking his lips.<br />
<br />
David couldn’t control himself any more and pulled Tony close, kissing him full and hard. After a few minutes <br />
of saliva swapping, Tony released and asked, “How do you feel?”<br />
<br />
David thought a moment and replied, “Well I think I’m starting to like guys a bit more...”<br />
<br />
Tony smiled, “My boy,” he replied as he clapped David on the shoulder, and they walked out of the bathroom and <br />
into the bar, “I’ve got to go now David, but if you need me call or text and I’ll make the time to see you. <br />
Let me know how you get on with the rest of the month!”<br />
<br />
And just like that he left. David felt a little let down and a bit alone, but shrugged it off and went home <br />
too, ready for his third week to begin...</p>
