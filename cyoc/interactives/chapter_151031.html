<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Looking back at the first description, I&#39;m only counting six women instead of seven. I&#39;m adding the seventh one in this chapter.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There are certain events which quickly become a part of urban lore. Stories that quickly spread around, often exaggerated or skewed in some way. These stories aren&#39;t always exclusive to tragic events such as suicides or terrible accidents. In this case, it was a particularly wild night in Animalia that frat boys can only hear about in amazement. The infamous &quot;Seven on Four&quot; Night has already garnered a lot of notoriety at UNLV. Four college guys with booze check into a room at the Worldmeet Glade. Seven former prostitutes who just had their brothel shut down enter with viable doses of the Animalian virus. After one particularly wild night, all eleven of them wake up with pounding headaches as double-dosed Animalians, the room a total mess from their big night.<br />
<br />
That was the simplest, bare-bones description of that night. However, more exact details were being kept quiet by the PR-MD. But that did not keep tongues from waggling and conjecture being made about just what happened that night. Already, some details were being distorted. Some people say that it was the college guys who crashed the former prostitutes&#39; conversion party. Some were saying they were secretly being observed as some sort of kinky science experiment. Some even said that the drinks had already been spiked with the Animalian virus. There were plenty of unfounded rumors being told about the &quot;Seven on Four&quot; Night, including one that the events will be recreated as a porno. But all descriptions of the &quot;Seven on Four&quot; Night were very far from the truth, except for this one:<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Andrew, Biff, and Dean were what you&#39;d expect from fraternity guys; rough around the edges, a little rowdy, and certainly looking for any occasion to drink. For this occasion, they definitely had a good reason. Their friend, Caiden, was finally turning 21 and was now of legal age to drink. And they were going to make sure that Caiden got pretty drunk on his 21st birthday. And they weren&#39;t going to just any place to get drunk. Sure, there were plenty of bars to go to in Las Vegas, but those bars can be pretty rough, particularly for first-timers. Not to mention there were a lot of people who could take advantage of a drunk person there. Animalia was a much safer place to be as street crime was nonexistent there. They just booked a suite at the Worldmeet Glade for themselves and their booze.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, did you bring the booze?&quot; asked Biff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I ever,&quot; said Dean, &quot;We&#39;ve got Jack Daniel&#39;s Whiskey and Kentucky&#39;s Bourbon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, guys, shouldn&#39;t we start with something lighter?&quot; asked Caiden, &quot;I don&#39;t think I can handle something that strong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, you want to develop a taste for this stuff as quickly as you can,&quot; said Dean, &quot;You can go for the soft stuff once you&#39;ve built up resistance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That seems rather backwards,&quot; said Caiden.<br />
<br />
Just then, there was a knock on the door. Andrew went to the door and partially opened it. Then he turned back into the room and asked, &quot;Ok, who ordered all the hookers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Caiden and Dean turned to look at Biff. &quot;I only ordered one hooker,&quot; said Biff.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re getting special today,&quot; said a woman&#39;s voice. Andrew opened the door fully and no less than seven women walked in. There was little question they were &#39;ladies of the night&#39;. The dresses they were obviously meant to provocative and they certainly had a worn look to them. Some of them looked pretty old, early 40&#39;s at the most. One of them was carrying a chest while another was carrying a small cooler.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, this is a bit much,&quot; said Caiden, &quot;I&#39;m only turning 21. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m having a bachelor party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;re having our big party here,&quot; said one woman, a blonde who for some reason had a smaller chest than she ought to have had.<br />
<br />
&quot;What party?&quot; asked Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you really want to know,&quot; said the woman they&#39;ll learn later was Sarah, &quot;Our little, uh, &#39;clubhouse&#39; just went under. We&#39;re all that&#39;s left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, I knew it was cheap, but I didn&#39;t think it was that cheap,&quot; said Biff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe somebody should have been looking after the money better,&quot; said the woman they&#39;d later learn was Lisa, looking at another woman in a semi-accusing tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;We weren&#39;t getting enough business,&quot; said a black-haired woman, &quot;There just wasn&#39;t enough money to watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, uh, what exactly does that have to do you with being here?&quot; asked Dean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;ve already sold the old house and what we could,&quot; said a rather short woman named Lexi, &quot;Since you&#39;ve already paid, we decided we may as well have one last big night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is if you&#39;ve got the booze,&quot; said the woman who&#39;ll later learn was Sylvia, &quot;You do have alcohol, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not quite sure if it&#39;s enough for everyone,&quot; said Dean.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll make it last,&quot; said the Vietnamese woman.<br />
<br />
After that, the whiskey and bourbon started flowing freely. This was the strong stuff too, sot it didn&#39;t take long for everyone to start getting tipsy. It only took a little prodding for the girls to reveal what was in the mini-cooler they brought. With the last money they&#39;ve managed to scrounge up, they&#39;ve been able to buy doses of Animalian virus. Some of them were a bit more pricey than the others, particularly Sylvia who wanted a particular fancy breed of horse. And it didn&#39;t take much prompting for the girls to start dosing themselves, despite their inebriation.<br />
<br />
For the guys, it was the show of a lifetime. The ladies were attractive enough before, but watching them grow fur was its own brand of sexiness. Though in Sarah&#39;s case, she was growing scales as she was becoming a Gila monster. They half-expected Betti to sprout antlers, but she didn&#39;t become that kind of deer. They did get to see her breasts grow as big as when she used to have implants. And it was a particularly big treat to watch Dao grow four extra breasts.<br />
<br />
Of course, as a consequence of their conversion, the new Animalians were feeling particularly frisky. And the conversion didn&#39;t flush the alcohol out of their system. And with four young men present, they didn&#39;t resist very long.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we should give the birthday boy a very special present,&quot; said Kelly, now a white rat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I want to have him first,&quot; said Lexi, who was now a mouse.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m claiming first dibs,&quot; said Kelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and what army?&quot; snapped Lexi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies, ladies,&quot; said Caiden, who was more than a little plastered, &quot;There&#39;s enough of me for both of you. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a way to make both of you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause before Lexi said &quot;Dibs on the bottom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dibs on the- Darn it!&quot; snapped Kelly, a second too late.<br />
<br />
The next thing Caiden knew, his pants and underwear were off and Lexi was riding him hard. The next thing after that, Kelly was sitting on his face, giving him little option but to start licking her. It appeared that Lexi was the influencing one here as the fur spreading out from Caiden&#39;s crotch match her fur.<br />
<br />
The other girls were getting pretty rowdy now. For instance, Lisa was holding Betti upside-down, which was easy with her new hyena strength, and licking her doe pussy out. Dao was making out with Betti, which left her ass raised up.<br />
<br />
Dean and Andrew were watching the lewd show. Dean in particular couldn&#39;t get enough of Dao&#39;s ass and her many jiggling breasts that seemed to get bigger as she double-dosed. &quot;I&#39;m gonna do it,&quot; said Dean, &quot;I&#39;m gonna get me some pork loin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, no,&quot; said Andrew, his voice a little slurred, &quot;You&#39;ll turn into a pig.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean gave him a lopsided grin and said, &quot;I&#39;m already a pig.&quot; With that, he staggered towards Dao, fumbling with his pants.<br />
<br />
Sylvia soon spotted Andrew by himself. &quot;So, stud,&quot; she said in an alluring tone, &quot;Feel like riding a wild mare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I mean, maybe,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;I haven&#39;t rode horseback in a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You never forget how,&quot; said Syliva, &quot;And you&#39;ll never forget this.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Biff, the planner for this party, had ended up with Sarah. However, this was getting a bit more than he expected. &quot;I&#39;m not much of the bondage type,&quot; said Biff, pulling at his handcuff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, it&#39;s a lot of fun,&quot; said Sarah, fishing around in her &#39;toybox&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t there something else we can play with?&quot; asked Biff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;ll get to play with a lot,&quot; said Sarah, stroking one breast while she pulled out a vibrator, &quot;But you&#39;re going to have earn it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure how I can earn anything with one hand tied,&quot; said Biff.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to be creative,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;If you aren&#39;t, I&#39;ll have to start shackling you more.&quot; Biff gulped at that. &quot;But you do want this, don&#39;t you big boy?&quot; asked Sarah in a sultry tone.<br />
<br />
Biff couldn&#39;t deny that Sarah&#39;s Gila monster was giving him a monstrous turn-on. &quot;Yeah, I really do,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said Sarah before straddling him, &quot;Then you better not disappoint me.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Things only got more wild from there. No one was limited to just one partner. There was little doubt that everyone was double-dosed before the end. But as the night drew on, details blurred together, everything became a swirling vortex of sex and pleasure. No one was really sure when they nodded off. But come the morn, the pleasure they felt last night was vastly overshadowed by the pounding headaches they felt. Some of them barely remembered that they had converted so it was a shock for them to wake up in the body of an anthro animal.<br />
<br />
The complete details of the &quot;Seven on Four&quot; night may never be fully known. But that hasn&#39;t stopped speculating. The participants would neither confirm or deny some of the theories they heard, except for the most outlandish ones, of course. But even some parts of that night would be left to the wider field of fantasy, it was certainly going to be a story that would be told very often at UNLV, both in the normal frats and in Pi Eta Tau.</p>
