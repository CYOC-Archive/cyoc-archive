<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harvey flipped through his phone again to make sure he had the correct room and time. He was supposed to have an &quot;advanced algebra&quot; course at this time - a supplementary for his finance degree rather than part of the core courses. Technically, he could take whatever he wanted, but he was going to try and get a math minor if he could take some bird courses along the way. It was common knowledge that this course was hardly worth being called &quot;advanced&quot;.<br />
<br />
He slid into the lecture hall and sat near the back this time, seeing the room already pretty full. It wasn&#39;t a large lecture space, more of an auditorium than a classroom, which wasn&#39;t quite what he was used to. He looked around, and didn&#39;t see any of the other students that he normally had his core classes with. He thought it was a bit odd, as this was supposed to be a fairly easy course, but he supposed it didn&#39;t truly matter if other students were taking other electives. He wasn&#39;t stupid, he could hold his own in the course.<br />
<br />
A couple of minutes after he had sat down, a relatively young professionally dressed woman entered the room and set up at the podium. She started handing out the syllabus to the students at the front of the room before pulling out her laptop, and setting up a powerpoint on the screen above her. The title of the class was in bold font in the middle of a white screen: LIT2550 Bollywood Film and Portrayal.<br />
<br />
Harvey was taken aback, this was definitely not the room he was supposed to be in. He dug out his phone and logged into the online system for his school again, checking his schedule. He saw the block for the current class, and saw it being booked for the room he was currently in. He clicked the block for more information on the class, and there it was: LIT2550. Surely this had to be some sort of mistake. He figured leaving would be a poor idea if he was technically enrolled in the class right now, but he went to the timetable to find the class he was previously enrolled in. Upon entering the math department&#39;s listing, there was a message below the course code saying that the course wasn&#39;t offered this year.<br />
<br />
Harvey&#39;s shock was interrupted as the student in front of him nudged him. &quot;Hey man, syllabuses.&quot; he said, handing Harvey the stack of papers. Harvey grabbed them, thanked the student, and passed them on. He looked through the paper, seeing that the class was mostly about watching movies and writing analyses about them. Lectures would switch between watching a movie and talking about film analysis methods. He kept reading and looked at the list of movies and saw titles like Anand, 3 Idiots, and Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India. He already knew all of these movies! He was taken aback, he didn&#39;t remember actually watching them at any point, but he could very distinctly remember the plots, the actors in the movie, and certainly that he&#39;d enjoyed them very much.<br />
<br />
He looked back up, the professor was already introducing herself. Harvey started paying attention to her preamble, introducing herself and her passions as a film analyst. She rambled on a little bit about why she was so attached to Bollywood, before talking about the course and her expectations as well as the course breakdown of marks. She then jumped into a very short lecture about movie expectations and the differences between Western and Bollywood movies. Harvey had entirely forgotten that this was the wrong course as he was taking notes on what she said and what was on the board. Before he knew it, she was dismissing the class due to it being the first day and not having a full lecture planned.<br />
<br />
Harvey approached the podium before he left the classroom, trying to get a word in with the prof. She was quite receptive - he introduced himself and she reintroduced herself as Dr. Becky Farrell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything I should be doing if I&#39;ve already watched all of the movies that are on the syllabus?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well that&#39;s not usually the case!&quot; replied Dr. Farrell, calmly. &quot;I think that the analysis is important, and watching the movie casually versus trying to critically think about the elements in the movie are very different things though. So you may find things that you&#39;ve missed before. Some students sign up for the course thinking that it&#39;ll be easy and they just have to summarize the movies, that isn&#39;t what I&#39;m looking for in this case.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harvey smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that, I&#39;m not here for just an easy credit, I think this course will be very interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Harvey, I hope to deliver!&quot; she replied, cheerfully. <br />
<br />
Harvey smiled again as he bid the teacher adieu and began to head back to his dorm, previous thoughts of being in the wrong class completely gone. He had to take some downtime before going to the meeting that Professor Martinez was basically forcing him to attend. It had been a long day and he needed to get his thoughts together now.</p>
