<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as Johnathan began readying his changes to Tyler&#39;s spell, the doors to the church burst open. Standing at the doorway was quite a sight. A tall, blonde man stood at the doorway, wearing nothing but a small, navy blue jockstrap, just slightly darker than the blue of his eyes. Even mostly naked, the man was highly intimidating, his eyes serious and piercing through everyone in the room. On top of that, his scowl would&#39;ve been enough to soften most of the class&#39; erections had it not been for Tyler&#39;s wish.<br />
<br />
The man&#39;s eyes quickly zeroed in on its prey, and he began walking towards his target. His firm set of muscles glistened from the sweat that had accumulated from the harsh sunlight and it would have given him the appearance of being an oiled muscle man had it not been for the pelt of hair that adorned his body. As the man closed the distance between him and Tyler, the brunette preacher couldn&#39;t help but notice the overwhelming smell of a hard day&#39;s work on the farm from the man. That and the man&#39;s cold stare made Tyler immediately feel the need to get away.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in tarnation do ya think you&#39;re doing Tyler? I heard the nonsense you been spewing. Don&#39;t ya know these devil-lovin&#39; sonuvabitches ain&#39;t gonna change just cus you want &#39;em to?&quot; the man asked Tyler, his southern accent dripping from his voice. &quot;For Pete&#39;s sake Tyler, it&#39;s bad enough that you can be heard from outside the church talkin&#39; gibberish, don&#39;t make it any worse by talkin&#39; to these Satanists. Not to mention, some of those things you said were just downright faggy, and that ain&#39;t okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler was rendered momentarily speechless due to being caught. He didn&#39;t intend to be disturbed while he worked, much less by his only friend. &quot;C-Calvin? What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, what do ya think I&#39;m doing here? I came here to see ya and pray. What else do I do when I got free time? But I sure as heck didn&#39;t think I&#39;d find you messing around with a bunch of faggots,&quot; Calvin explained, his fists clenching as the last word. The blonde had a clear and overt disgust of anything even slightly &#39;faggy&#39; and made sure people knew it. If it weren&#39;t for the fact that they were physically inside the church, it was clear the Calvin would have spilt someone&#39;s blood.<br />
<br />
Tyler took a moment to survey the situation. Calvin had clearly heard everything Tyler had said, right up to the point of wishing to be gay. Tyler knew Calvin would&#39;ve approved of some stuff, such as making the crowd wear the church uniform, but others, such as making them horny, probably made the blonde livid. He should&#39;ve been more careful, Tyler thought. Calvin had been homeschooled his entire life as a result of his parents being converted to the church well before his birth, so there was no way he&#39;d have been brought to the church with Tyler&#39;s wish despite them being the same age. In fact, it became one of the reasons why Calvin was one of the most bigoted people Tyler knew. Without a doubt, the blonde was ready to pummel the brunette&#39;s face in and given their size difference, there was no way for Tyler to stop him. Years of working on his father&#39;s farm gave Calvin strength that Tyler would never know.<br />
<br />
As Tyler was soon brought down to mere incoherent babbling out of fear, Johnathan smiled, liking where this was going. He didn&#39;t know that the blonde man had been spying like he did, but the genie could definitely work with this. Since he still had Tyler&#39;s prior wish in his hand, he could easily manipulate it to fit the situation. Reversing time back to before Calvin had entered the church, Tyler now spoke his new wish. &quot;I wish I KNEW CALVIN was gay and WE loved it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The genie&#39;s eyes glowed, and the doors swung open once again. This time, however, a smiling figure appeared at the door. As Calvin walked down the aisle towards Tyler, he made passing glances at men in the audience. In particularly, he made sure to measure up as many packages as possible.<br />
<br />
As the blonde closed the distance between him and Tyler once more, he ended his walk with a hug for his best friend. Not an ounce of the cold, harsh stare he had before could be seen on the joyful face Calvin now wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in tarnation do ya think you&#39;re doing Tyler? Was all that stuff you said part of the church&#39;s rules now? That&#39;s gonna be so hot,&quot; Calvin exclaimed, ending with a laugh. He was completely comfortable with his new sexuality when he was with Tyler. The brunette was the first person he came out to, after all. Originally, he had come with the hope that the pastor-in-training could help him, but once Tyler had told him all about his parents&#39; attempts to make him gay, and how the brunette secretly wished he was gay, Calvin was overjoyed. If the pastor&#39;s family was so welcoming towards homosexuality, it couldn&#39;t be bad, right? Even if the pastor ranted about its &quot;sins&quot; in his sermon, at the end of the day, Calvin knew it was okay. Sure, he couldn&#39;t come out to his parents just yet, but he could do just about anything else to accept his sexuality and he would make sure he did.<br />
<br />
Tyler was glad he first made sure that Calvin had changed before he changed himself. It was important to Tyler that he his best friend had his back before the brunette made such a huge change to his life.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re not mad? Not even about the whole college partying thing?&quot; Tyler asked. Being homeschooled meant Calvin didn&#39;t become a part of the partying craze that had swept up Tyler&#39;s class. He never got many of the contacts Tyler got and even if found out where a party was being held he never had an excuse to go to them. As a result, Tyler always felt that Calvin seemed to resent partying and in their past reality, Tyler never brought it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are ya crazy? I&#39;d gosh darn love to see all those men wearing next to nothin&#39; and dancin&#39; like their lives depended on it. It&#39;d be so darn hot,&quot; Calvin explained, chubbing up a little at the thought. While his perception of college parties had been skewed due to the class&#39; more nude outlook on partying, Calvin&#39;s heart was in the right place. &quot;It would be much better if the church accepted it like we did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler thought about for a moment. &quot;You know what? You&#39;re right. But in order to have that, I have to do something first. Johnathan, I wish I became gay and loved it,&quot; Tyler wished.<br />
<br />
Johnathan wasted no time (no pun intended) in changing Tyler&#39;s wish. Besides, it was time to advance Tyler&#39;s changes anyways. &quot;I wish I became A gay TWINK and CALVIN loved it,&quot; Tyler now wished, his lips puffing at the last word.<br />
<br />
Calvin quickly grew hard at the sight of his friend changing, even if he had no idea how it was possible. Tyler&#39;s face was the first thing to change. His nose shrunk and upturned to become a button nose as his blue eyes permanently widened to give Tyler a more innocent look. Next, his jaw line narrowed, from a strong square to a heart shape as his beard receded. Overall, his face softened to give Tyler a more &#39;cute&#39; look.<br />
<br />
His mind now shifted as it became much more flighty and decidedly gay. Images of cock and ass filled Tyler&#39;s head as any desire towards women drained out of him. Now, much to his parents&#39; joy, he preferred those Playgirl magazines to women in bikini. Next, his personality became far more flamboyant as the pastor-in-training&#39;s jockstrap faded in color until it became a bright pink, to match the budding twink&#39;s new attitude.<br />
<br />
Tyler body changed last. As Tyler hadn&#39;t spent much time in the gym, his muscles didn&#39;t really diminish much. Instead, his body became smooth and taut. The slight paunch he was beginning to grow vanished as Tyler&#39;s feet and hands became more dainty. The result gave Tyler the perfect twink physique that turned Calvin on to no end. The blonde farmer&#39;s son now had a twink fetish and Tyler filled that role perfectly. In fact, he filled it so well that they were beginning to look like the perfect couple. Now that Tyler was gay, his parents were more than happy to let Calvin come over to let them have their alone time. After all, in order for Tyler to be as gay as possible, he had to able to explore his body as much as possible and Calvin would be able to help with that. On top of that, they no longer took issue with Tyler partying, allowing him and Calvin to frequent colleges to have fun, as Calvin now had excuse for where he went all the time. All in all, life was great for both of them.<br />
<br />
Tyler smiled as his new life came into being. &quot;OMG, this is so much better,&quot; Tyler realized with a giggle. Apparently, the changes meant that the brunette now had a more effeminate dialect.<br />
<br />
&quot;It sure does,&quot; Calvin confirmed, wrapping an arm around Tyler. &quot;So what next?&quot;</p>
