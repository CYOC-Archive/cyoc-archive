<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up the next morning with your fellow heads, and all of you felt extremely sluggish. &quot;Ugh, does anyone else feel big?&quot; Your left head asked and then your right head replied,&quot;We&#39;re a giant four-headed lizard. We’re bigger than the trees around us a...&quot; <br />
<br />
Your left head then growled,&quot;I meant fat! I mean that I feel fat, or...we feel fat.&quot; Your right head then replied,&quot;We were fucked, but I doubt that we’re pregnant after o....&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly your lower head roared,&quot;HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!&quot; You now couldn’t take the sound of your heads so you roared as loud as you could, but you suddenly felt a sudden surge of a very sharp pain in your lower stomach and whimpered,&quot;Oh....f...fuck....&quot; <br />
<br />
You didn’t know what was wrong until you peered down at your body, and you immediately noticed why your lower head freaked out earlier. All of your breasts were swollen up to almost double their size from earlier, and your gut was immensely larger and you already had a dire feeling that you knew why.<br />
<br />
&quot;I....Is this....are we filled with eggs?&quot; You asked then your lower paused for a few moments and whimpered,&quot;Oh god....I think I can feel them, it’s eggs.&quot; Your other two heads looked to one another and whined, and then the right head whimpered,&quot;Oh god are we about to lay them? Please tell me we aren’t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be more worried if we weren’t ready to lay them to be honest. Just imagine how much larger we&#39;d get if gestation was longer.&quot; Your left head exclaimed and then suddenly you realized something that you had ignored earlier because of your pregnant surprise. &quot;Where’s Xolun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your others heads paused once you said this and they began looking around in a frantic search for him. However there was a large thumping sound and the sounds of destruction in its wake coming from the forest. At first you feared for the worst putting into the account that you were much slower due to your condition, and you were also carrying a possibly large number of lives besides your own. However you watched as Xolun bursted out of the wilderness leaving a trail of destroyed trees that had fallen over behind him. <br />
<br />
All of your heads stared at him at what he had done, your left and lower heads had their mouths agape. &quot;Where were you?! Did you know about this?!&quot; Your right head suddenly snarled, and you looked over at her and asked,&quot;Where did that come from?&quot; Your right head looked back like it was panicking and it said,&quot;Okay look, are you not freaking out too over this?! These eggs might be due in a matter of minutes and you aren’t freaking out about this?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Xolun ran up to you as you talked with your own head and his right head cleared his throat to get your attention. You looked with your right head and Xolun&#39;s right head said,&quot;We woke up in the middle of the night, and we were surprised as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is also very alarming, gestation doesn’t seem like it takes much time.&quot; Xolun&#39;s left head said and then his lower head added,&quot;We’ve been searching for a cave, but...only one.&quot;<br />
<br />
You groaned again as you felt a second surge of pain, but this time it was worse. &quot;Ack...&quot; You growled clutching your stomach a bit, and then you growled,&quot;Well, whatever the complications are they can wait. That one was worse than the last one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse then the la....wait contractions? You’re having those NOW?!&quot; Xolun’s lower head roared, and you nodded and said,&quot;Last one was...maybe 10 minutes ago? I’m not sure what that means because well...we’re this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Xolun&#39;s heads all paused looking to one another then his central head said,&quot;Yizara, I think we should move, like as soon as you can stand we should get there as soon as we can!&quot; <br />
<br />
You paused now suddenly feeling afraid about what was going to happen. -Where was this cave? What if you gave birth out in the open and had to carry your eggs to the cave? Would you even have the strength to move? If so, how many eggs could you carry a once?-<br />
<br />
All of those thoughts and more flooded your mind, and you slowly got to your feet with the assistance of Xolun. &quot;Easy now, we’ve got you, everything is going to be alright.&quot; Xolun’s left head said, and your right head whimpered,&quot;I hope so, just tell us where is this caaarrrgh!!&quot; <br />
<br />
You felt another contraction, and you and your heads started hyperventilating, but you and them were able to control this breathing after awhile. &quot;Shit! Are you okay?!&quot; Xolun’s central head asked and then you roared,&quot;You did this to us, so where is the fucking cave?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Xolun’s heads all nodded to you and in unison said,&quot;This way! We’ll guide you!&quot; You nodded and walked very slowly while trying to clench your womb shut to give yourself as much time as you could.<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s it dear, it’s not far at all. Just a little bit past the foliage here.&quot; Xolun’s central head said actually guiding you down the path that he charged back from. &quot;Not sure...how long we can keep them back!&quot; You growled as tears welled up in your eyes, the pain now starting to get closer towards your uterus.<br />
<br />
&quot;They’re g...gonna come soon!&quot; Your left head snarled and then Xolun’s right head growled,&quot;Almost there! You’re going to make it Yiz....&quot; Xolun paused as you roared out from another contraction and you felt some sort of liquid burst out of your womb. <br />
<br />
Afraid, you looked back and saw that it was clear and you roared,&quot;Our water just broke! We&#39;re going into labor NOW!!!&quot; Xolun’s central head then snarled,&quot;Not yet!! Just past these trees! Just two puny trees!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and you clenched your womb as tight as you could, and you slowly followed Xolun past a couple of trees beyond the path, and directly behind them was a shallow, but large looking cave that was close to the ground. &quot;Yizara are you okay?! Speak to us!&quot; Xolun’s central head roared and you nodded,&quot;Starting t...to feel them move! S...Starting to....&quot; You then feel something drop into your uterus and you make a mad dash for the cave caring little for anything else at this moment.<br />
<br />
Once inside of the cave you flopped onto your side against the back wall, and you and your other heads let out a cry of pain and roar out. &quot;IT&#39;S COMING!!!&quot; You roared now feeling a large object push itself up against your vaginal walls and Xolun ran up to you as fast as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m here! Just push now! Push with everything that you have!!!&quot; Xolun’s central head roared and you nodded to him and started pushing. Immediately you felt your pussy stretch open wide, wider than your own mouth as you screamed out in agony. &quot;It’s too much! I wasn’t born for this!!&quot; Your loser head roared, and then Xolun’s lower head growled,&quot;Don’t you dare doubt yourself! Push harder!! It’s going to hurt much more, but it’s going to pass quicker!&quot; <br />
<br />
You gave Xolun’s lower head a quick nod and took a deep breath then roared and pushed with everything you had, and eventually you felt the object escape your womb and onto the cave floor. You got a glimpse of what appeared to be and egg the size of your own massive head before the next egg hit your womb. &quot;Oh, fuuuuck!!!&quot; You roared and started to push again, and Xolun watched as this all happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got one, now comes the second! Just do the same thing!&quot; Xolun’s central head growled then you pushed one more time and you felt the egg slide out of your pussy and join its sibling. &quot;Xolun, we love you! Just get us through this please!!!&quot; Your left head roared as a third egg fell into the domain of your uterus.<br />
<br />
Xolun smiled and  his left head said,&quot;I know, just keep going!!&quot; You nodded to him and started pushing once more, but you noticed this egg was different. It was less painful and you felt aroused by your stretching and flexible pussy as the egg passed out your body. <br />
<br />
Every egg following that was less and less painful, and your cries of pain turned into moans of pleasure. &quot;S..So big!!&quot; Your lower head roared as you were in the middle of egg number nine and still going. By the twelfth egg you found yourself orgasming to each new egg, and you didn’t feel guilty at all by this.<br />
<br />
The lust from laying eggs was incredible, and after you finished you had laid a total of 17 eggs. You then gathered them all up and you and your heads all cleaned them off with your tongues. &quot;Is that all Yizara? Are you finally done?&quot; Xolun’s central head asked and you smiled and giggled at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re parents now, and I’ll say this. I wouldn’t mind going for a second round if you’re up for it.&quot; You said with a mischievous grin on your face, and Xolun paused then the heads all laughed and the lower head exclaimed,&quot;Wow, didn’t know you were so eager.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m just a gal who discovered that she likes giving birth. Speaking of which could you make us a nest? Like a nest for all of us me, you and our future little hatchlings.&quot; You said, and your right head nodded then said,&quot;Just don’t do it in front of the kids hun. We don’t want them getting any ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and your heads all yawn at once now and you let out a small and tired laugh and said,&quot;We just woke up and we’re exhausted, heh. Hey, mind making us a nest while we take a nap and warm the eggs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Xolun’s central head smiled and said,&quot;You deserve it Yizara, sleep well.&quot; You nodded to Xolun weakly and laid down on top of the clutch of eggs that you just laid. You slowly dozed off with your fellow heads again, and you began to dream about your motherhood, when your eggs might hatch, and when you could get Xolun to fuck you again and impregnate you once more.<br />
<br />
Though, you cave could only probably support three creatures the size of you and Xolun. It was perfect for a couple, but small for a family of hydra caliber. However you didn’t worry about such things, just how incredible it was to be a mother.<br />
<br />
You woke up the next day and you saw a large nest sitting right next to you. Xolun was gone, and you wasted no time in moving your eggs into the nest, being extremely careful of course. You laid down atop them again and looked out into the distance again.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly your other heads hadn’t woken up yet. However you spotted some feral deer that you assumed that Xolun left for you. You weren’t quite sure if you should accept raw meat just yet, but then....</p>
