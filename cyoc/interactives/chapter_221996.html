<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The &#39;go&#39; signal that Eric was waiting for on Friday evening was a specific message from Haylee -- her choice of the eggplant emoji was weird so he figured it must be an in-joke. The moment his phone buzzed and he saw the symbol, he focused on the ring and performed the swap. Eric was with Brandon at the Montgomery household, and although he had become more open with the younger brother about what was going on with Jared, he had kept the ring&#39;s powers secret, sticking to the &#39;young wizard&#39; cover story he&#39;d been peddling from the start.<br />
<br />
In fact, Brandon had warmed up to the idea a LOT, even believing that Eric&#39;s &#39;magic&#39; would be enough to both protect him and change things for the better. Those thoughts were evidence enough, and Brandon listened when Eric told him to strip off in preparation, promising that he would want to watch it happen. Embarrassed though he was, Brandon did as recommended.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t disappointed.<br />
<br />
Grunting in surprise, Brandon&#39;s mouth fell open as his junk morphed and swelled into a completely average teenage cock, with a pair of completely average teenage balls. It was halfway hard already for some reason, and it immediately went all the way stiff, causing the new owner to draw in a sharp breath. Eric estimated -- and he had become quite the expert at visually judging cock length due to his adventures -- that it was just under six inches. Nothing out of the ordinary for a seventeen year old, but on Brandon it was positively majestic.<br />
<br />
Not as majestic as what belonged to Eric, of course, but that was beside the point. He wasn&#39;t about to rain on Brandon&#39;s parade.<br />
<br />
&quot;This- ... this is mine now?&quot; Brandon squeaked. He touched the shaft and withdraw his hand nervously in surprise when it twitched in response. &quot;It&#39;s so ... hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all yours. Just take care not to show it to your brother.&quot; Eric giggled. &quot;He&#39;s gonna behave himself from now on, but maybe don&#39;t tempt him to act out. Do you like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah ... I- ... I do like it.&quot; He kept staring at it. &quot;You were right, it is kinda cool being bigger. It feels weird, but ... nice?&quot; Brandon began to pull up his pants, attempting to tuck it all away, and looked up at the younger Morales. &quot;Eric ... um ... thanks. For everything you&#39;ve done for me. It means a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad I could.&quot; He stood up, depositing his phone into his pocket, and smiled. &quot;I know I said we could hang out for a bit, but I shouldn&#39;t stay. Jared will be on his way back soon, and I don&#39;t think he should see me here. Why don&#39;t we play some games online when I get home, though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! Let&#39;s do that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll message you when I&#39;m back.&quot; Eric waved, and Brandon waved back with his free hand, the other trying to stuff his new junk into his old underwear with somewhat limited success.<br />
<br />
&quot;See ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Eric made his way out of the room, and then the house, and he began the walk home. It was still early in the evening, and he had a spring in his step.<br />
<br />
He had fulfilled his personal vow -- Jared&#39;s lesson had been well and truly learned, and this meant that he would allow himself to swap again. Once he got home, he was going to have fun with his friend. Brandon, with his newly acquired six inches, and himself with his rightful ten plus, just lazing around playing video games. Two preteens who had triple and quintuple what their older brothers had, respectively. Eric couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it all the way back.<br />
<br />
He had been SO patient and disciplined.<br />
<br />
It had been nearly two weeks, after all!<br />
<br />
Once he got inside the house, he skipped rapidly through in eagerness, all but running to his room. Closing the door soundly, the ring worn on his clenched right fist, he pulled off his pants, then Jared&#39;s speedo.<br />
<br />
Ugh. He was sick of wearing it, but now things were about to be better.<br />
<br />
Without hesitating and with the biggest smile, he grabbed a pair of Ethan&#39;s old boxers and pulled them on.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It was four days earlier on Monday that Eric had surprised Ethan with his recovery of Brandon&#39;s cap and the subsequent return to his original size. Being rescued yet again by his little brother had been some kind of wake-up call for Ethan. The admission that he had to learn to control his itch and go cold turkey was a difficult one, but he had accepted Eric&#39;s suggestion. The next time any swap happened, he would be ready for it and able to weather his emotions, to resist the urges instead of letting them overcome him.<br />
<br />
With his head in a better place and his body back to &#39;normal&#39;, Ethan made a point of tracking down Lucas on Tuesday and apologising for being so distant and weird. He also sheepishly accepted the offer of becoming official, if it was still available, to which a surprised and overjoyed Lucas told him it definitely was. They shared another covert kiss -- though not as spicy as the one at the cinema -- and Lucas was adamant that they would be as discreet as possible so as to not stress Ethan out.<br />
<br />
For Ethan, it was the good kind of scary. Not only was he finally -- and belatedly for the resident school stud --  taking a chance on a relationship, but it was also with a guy. He&#39;d always assumed it would be a girl, but he didn&#39;t feel odd about it.<br />
<br />
He liked Lucas a lot.<br />
<br />
Tuesday led into Wednesday, and then Thursday. Being fully big-cock Ethan again made the terror of his past mistakes dissolve, but it didn&#39;t take long for his itch to return. First it was echoes, then pangs of want, and finally full on desire.<br />
<br />
Now though? He was ready to deal with it. He suppressed and squashed that itch whenever it flared up. The feelings of addiction were put out of mind and minimised. His self-confidence at being &#39;whole&#39; definitely helped, and although the episodes of psychological struggle made him just as uncomfortable as at the cinema, he persevered and got through it.<br />
<br />
It was as if there was some part of his psyche that was independent, but perverted and kinky, a representation of his mental state that came purely from the size obsession. It wasn&#39;t exactly a split personality, but this splinter of his mind was trying to get him to give in, to convince &#39;normal&#39; Ethan to embrace his freakdom.<br />
<br />
Like withdrawals from a drug addiction -- Ethan could only assume, as he&#39;d never done any drugs -- once he was past the worst of it, he began to feel better and each instance got easier. By Friday afternoon, he was in a great mood, with almost no thought of swapping in his head at all. The itch had been reduced to a dull background ache that felt like it was gradually fading away.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t get much time with Lucas outside school during the week, as they had homework and other events getting in the way. With the weekend on the horizon, Ethan wanted to make space for him, and Lucas had hinted that he might be free on Saturday or Sunday, depending on his family. Getting some quality recreation in with his boyfriend -- a word that conjured butterflies -- was just the icing on the cake of him getting his life back together.<br />
<br />
They spent a couple of hours txting each other after school, and thankfully for Ethan, his father was out of the house. Eric had gone over to hang out with Brandon, but he made sure to say he wasn&#39;t going to be back late, and it was just a short visit. Ethan was glad Eric was making more friends around his own age, even if it was Jared Montgomery&#39;s little brother. He didn&#39;t hold Brandon&#39;s family against him though. After Lucas excused himself and stopped responding to go socialise at some family game night, while Ethan had the house to himself, he took a nice relaxing shower.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, back in his room, naked and drying himself off, he thought he heard the distant sound of the front door closing. It was followed by the quick footsteps of Eric making his return, and the much closer sound of Eric&#39;s bedroom door hastily opening and shutting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back already?&quot; Ethan thought to himself, amused. &quot;Maybe Eric got bored. I should ask him if he wants to watch something online, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s-&quot;<br />
<br />
That thought was interrupted by a tingle that he knew well.<br />
<br />
What was-<br />
<br />
Oh ... no.<br />
<br />
His eyes flicked down to his crotch in time to feel the pinch as his penis shrank rapidly, his testicles pulling up in tandem.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, there it was again.<br />
<br />
Little.<br />
<br />
Smooth.<br />
<br />
Young.<br />
<br />
His?<br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s mouth went dry, his heart pounding.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no-... I- ... it&#39;s- ... it&#39;s not me!&quot; He whispered hoarsely. &quot;I don&#39;t want this, I-&quot;<br />
<br />
Like a blast of desert wind, the itch roared back to life, instantly filling his brain with fog. The repressed desire pulled at him, made ten times stronger by already being physically swapped and now just wanting him to relapse and dive in headlong. The perverted independent sliver of his conscience hissed, taking up an inner voice like it had before.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes, you do. It&#39;s right there and you LOVE it. You WANT it. You can&#39;t think about anything else. This is who you are. This is your future!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I- ... um ... &quot; he tried to form a response, but he couldn&#39;t speak properly, couldn&#39;t do anything other than stare at the horrible perfection of his groin. There was a strange foreign pressure that was growing in his head, getting stronger by the second, and pushing against his mind as it tried to get inside. Reality was hard to understand, and he felt like his brain was stuffed full of cotton wool. &quot;I&#39;m not ... I&#39;m ... not ... uh. I ... um.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was slackjawed, his face red as he failed to argue. Stupefied, he knew he had to counter it, but the thick fuzz was everywhere, like a choking cloud that made him confused and silly.<br />
<br />
&#39;It IS you,&#39; the internal voice confirmed, as if merely stating the obvious, &#39;and you&#39;ve always been this way. You KNOW this.&#39;<br />
<br />
No, that wasn&#39;t right! Ethan tried to pull his thoughts together enough to deny this. He was ... swapped? Swapped with ... someone? With ... Eric?<br />
<br />
Mouth open, staring dumbly at his own crotch, Ethan was lost in the clogging mist.<br />
<br />
Swapped ... ? Was that really true?<br />
<br />
At that moment, the mental pressure reached its insidious persuasive peak, and ...<br />
<br />
... something in his mind cracked.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
No ... it wasn&#39;t true, right?<br />
<br />
Of course he wasn&#39;t swapped.<br />
<br />
He was being silly. He had ALWAYS been this way, and he wasn&#39;t sure how he could think otherwise.<br />
<br />
He knew this to be true -- why was he even questioning it?<br />
<br />
In a second, his thoughts became clearer as the fog miraculously evaporated, the pressure mysteriously vanished, his heart slowed, and his breath evened out.<br />
<br />
Ethan sighed, calming down as he wondered what he was getting so worked up and nervous over in the first place. This was who he was! Growing up with an extremely small penis wasn&#39;t anything to get upset about. There was no reason to needlessly worry about what was clearly the result of unlucky genetics.<br />
<br />
No, it wouldn&#39;t do to get stressed out at the hand life had dealt him. He began pulling on his underwear as he rationalised it. Nobody knew he had a child-sized dick, nor that he was secretly Babycock Ethan, a private identity that was more natural to him than what everyone else saw. Not even Eric was aware of THAT, and his sibling knew just about everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Babycock Ethan murmured as he pulled on a shirt, &quot;perhaps my &#39;little&#39; brother can lift me out of this weird mood. Wonder if he&#39;d be down for a movie or something like that.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what came over me, but I&#39;m glad I snapped out of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Eric was busy gaming online with Brandon, though he called out and to say that in an hour or two they could hang out. In the meanwhile, Ethan went back to his room, put on some music, and just relaxed on his bed. With his thoughts idle, he began to reflect on his earlier angst, and his mind wandered to thinking about the past.<br />
<br />
It had never seemed fair that while most of his body matured, one particular area had not. Like others boys going through adolescence, he had become taller and grown muscles -- everywhere blossomed! Everywhere except for his cock. When his classmates sprouted hair, gained length and thickness, Ethan had remained the same. At first, he thought he was just late starting, and he waited expectantly for the effects to kick in like they surely had to, but ... nothing happened.<br />
<br />
First the other boys were weeks ahead, but that turned into months. Eventually it was more than a year, and then a second year. They were turning into men in all the ways that mattered, while Ethan?<br />
<br />
He had a missing part -- a critical piece.<br />
<br />
By middle school age, that one aspect was still unchanged from elementary, while all his peers were, developmentally, transitioning to adulthood. Ethan quickly learned to hide his childish shame, and he focused on swimming and keeping in shape to compensate. From early on the secretive tasks of stuffing his crotch and avoiding others while getting dressed were things Ethan elevated to art forms. He mastered them so well that, outwardly, by high school, nobody knew any different. In fact, he had become such an expert that he gained a reputation as a prize catch, and he fearfully maintained that public reputation. It was a facade he thought of as Studly Ethan, a fake persona of the well-hung swim-team jock -- the version of him that was &#39;normal&#39;, one he badly wished was real.<br />
<br />
Privately though, he knew that was a lie.<br />
<br />
Having the veneer of puberty everywhere else didn&#39;t change that he was child-size Ethan in the one place that counted.<br />
<br />
Then there was Eric.<br />
<br />
By contrast, his little brother had always been abnormally endowed -- Ethan recalled specific memories, quite clearly -- even from very young. Eric still hadn&#39;t entered puberty, but despite that, every year his groin was inexplicably and progressively larger. By the time he was eight, Eric was a match for average adult size, and before his tenth birthday, he was packing more than most porn stars, and probably bigger than ninety-five percent of full grown men. Still, this blessing didn&#39;t give Eric an inflated ego, and he treated Ethan the same -- Eric knew about his deficiency, and stayed supportive. Ethan was grateful, though at the same time he felt totally inadequate.<br />
<br />
What kind of older brother couldn&#39;t give advice about puberty because he hadn&#39;t experienced the most important part himself? Eric did have questions about his body, but Ethan? He didn&#39;t really know how to answer them and what to say.<br />
<br />
But ... a few weeks ago, something amazing but strange -- supernaturally strange -- happened.<br />
<br />
Eric had acquired a ring from an odd little shop he found on the way home from school. The store owner informed him this ring had magical powers.<br />
<br />
At first neither brother had believed it, but it took only one brief experiment to prove that it was indeed a magic ring! Somehow, it bestowed on the wearer an ability to swap a body part with that of another person, provided a clothing article of the target was worn at the time. After a bit of fooling around with random silly swaps, Eric had offered Ethan something more serious, something he didn&#39;t think was possible: the chance to be &#39;normal&#39; and temporarily trade crotches.<br />
<br />
There was no way Ethan could turn down a dream opportunity, and so he eagerly accepted, desperate to embody the public image he privately failed to match. In fact, Eric was such a cool little brother that he lent his junk out multiple times, thinking it was an awesome gift -- like a favour to Ethan -- and he was right!<br />
<br />
To Ethan, it WAS super cool, only ... somehow ... it just didn&#39;t work.<br />
<br />
Whenever Ethan accepted that gift, something about it wouldn&#39;t make sense. Physically, the new enormous penis was attached to him, but there was a vibe of ... misplacement, like it wasn&#39;t connected properly. The organ was heavy in a way he wasn&#39;t used to -- and thick! -- and he could definitely tell the sensations of his hand&#39;s touch on it, and the warmth of his body&#39;s pulse and blood within it, but otherwise?<br />
<br />
It felt like it was detached, and for some reason using it was incomprehensible. Logically, he knew it was just a dick, but he just couldn&#39;t figure out how to act with it. He tried playing with it, but each time it lay there, stubbornly soft. He attempted peeing with it more than once -- he made sure to try when he needed to use the bathroom, just to encourage his body to go -- but he couldn&#39;t even do that! He did everything he could to make it synch up with the rest of his physiology, but it seemed like the cock was asleep, hibernating because he wasn&#39;t meant to have it<br />
<br />
Like it was refusing to recognise him as the owner because he wasn&#39;t worthy enough, and it was completely unwilling to play along.<br />
<br />
The situation was so confusing and Ethan couldn&#39;t comprehend why. He didn&#39;t let Eric know, of course, that his brain couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t operate the much larger penis, and he pretended that he was loving it, and that everything was great! But ... it was basically useless on his body and the humiliating situation was made even worse by the fact that he was meant to be ENJOYING Eric&#39;s generosity. He knew it should be natural, that anybody else would quickly adjust like breaking in a new pair of shoes, but ... why wasn&#39;t he?! Why COULDN&#39;T he?! What was stopping him from taking charge and *becoming* Studly Ethan whenever Eric gave him this gift?<br />
<br />
Was he simply destined to remain small because it fit him in a way nothing else could?<br />
<br />
The most distressing part though, was swapping back.<br />
<br />
Each time he reverted, everything was better.<br />
<br />
Shrinking back to his tiny-dick self and that confirmation of his fears was mortifying but totally undeniable.<br />
<br />
Being small felt normal -- everything made sense! -- and it horrified Ethan how relieved he was to be child-size again.<br />
<br />
The sound of Eric&#39;s bedroom door opening and closing snapped Ethan out of his contemplative daydream, and it spurred him to get up too. Emerging to the lounge, he discovered Eric standing in front of the TV, remote in hand, as he picked a channel. Turning, he tossed the remote onto the couch and caught sight of Ethan as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ethan! Dad&#39;s gone out tonight, so I&#39;m not wearing anything, and we can watch out here instead.&quot; The younger brother was bright-eyed and in a great mood for whatever reason, though Ethan was caught completely off guard by the fact that Eric was stark naked from head to toe. &quot;I&#39;ll grab us some sodas. You should get comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Eric was gone toward the kitchen, leaving only the image of his departure; slender arms and legs and back, a round little butt, and the glimpses in between of a long thick cock lightly swaying as he walked.<br />
<br />
Flustered, Ethan sat on the couch. He didn&#39;t have time to collect himself before Eric was back, plopping down next to him and handing him a can. Immediately, Eric leaned in, his shoulder resting comfortably against Ethan&#39;s, while he instinctively spread his legs, giving the &#39;prize&#39; some space.<br />
<br />
Cracking open their sodas, they both took a swig and turned their attention to the screen. Ethan&#39;s attention lasted all of a couple dozen seconds though, because he couldn&#39;t help himself. Stealing glances at his brother&#39;s lap, he wanted to admire the impressively fat lengthy penis resting on the couch fabric between Eric&#39;s thighs. It went more than halfway to his knees, practically obscuring the material beneath, and Ethan found it difficult to NOT stare at the magnificent sight. Why did a record-breaking porn-star cock look so natural on his eleven year old brother? <br />
<br />
Why did Eric own it so effortlessly?<br />
<br />
Ethan wished he were blessed from birth like that, and he snuck another look or two at the amazing image. Eric was taking a sip of his soda with his left hand, and the right slipped under his balls. He lightly scratched them, like he was doting on a favourite pet, before cupping the pair while he gazed at the TV. Absently, Eric lifted his fingers, stroking through his pubes, and Ethan wondered what it would be like to grow hair around his groin. Finally, Eric&#39;s hand slid down again and encircled the shaft -- his digits and grip seeming tiny in contrast to the girth of what they were wrapped around -- and he squeezed gently. Nudging his cock against the left thigh with his palm, he adjusted it so it draped comfortably along his leg like a snake basking in the sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you can just strip off too.&quot; Eric&#39;s giggle was proof enough he knew Ethan was watching. Caught red-handed! &quot;You can join me! We don&#39;t need to be shy when it&#39;s just us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Was it really okay to do that? He wasn&#39;t much of a big brother, after all. If anything, Ethan felt more like the little brother being encouraged by the older sibling, but if Eric was cool with it, then he could at least be more open around home. Nobody else was there to discover his secret, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;I ... um ... yeah. Okay,&quot; he said, softly. <br />
<br />
With a slight hesitation, he slid his boxers down and then pulled them off. Eric beamed at him, all smiles, and turned back to the TV, not giving Ethan&#39;s fresh nudity a second thought. It was reassuring that he didn&#39;t seem to care about how Ethan was.<br />
<br />
Still, he couldn&#39;t help himself. He had to get another look; it was as if he were sitting next to the Holy Grail.<br />
<br />
With a final glance to Eric&#39;s crotch, his eyes flicked down to his own, performing a comparison. Eric liked to manspread because it was clearly comfortable for his size and naturally easier since his upper legs were slim. But the older brother? His athletically-toned thighs left less room, and Ethan&#39;s face reddened as he realised even if he imitated Eric, spreading his legs wider and deliberately lowering his pelvis, his balls wouldn&#39;t touch the couch -- they wouldn&#39;t even get close.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re too small for that.&quot; He thought to himself, his eyes flicking up to the TV, so he could at least feign watching it. &quot;I can&#39;t do it like he can, like most guys can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, are you okay?&quot; It was an ad break, and he had Eric&#39;s attention. His little brother&#39;s boyish shoulder was pressed close, and Eric was looking up at him with concern, either not having noticed Ethan&#39;s previous self inspection or just not passing judgement. &quot;You seem really spaced out today. I&#39;m sorry if I surprised you by swapping again too soon. I should have said something to you first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Swapping again?<br />
<br />
Ethan didn&#39;t understand what Eric meant.<br />
<br />
They weren&#39;t swapped at all -- everything was au naturel.<br />
<br />
When did this happen? What was Eric referring to?<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh ... I&#39;m- ... I&#39;m okay.&quot; He managed to pretend as if he knew what Eric was talking about. &quot;Nothing&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, nothing out of the normal, at least. Just the same old fear that other people would discover he was a faker with a tiny immature penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. So long as you&#39;re not feeling weird because of anything I did.&quot; He nodded. &quot;Tomorrow is Saturday, so are you gonna go out anywhere? Maybe you could see what Lucas is doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas! A burst of thrill crossed with fear shot through Ethan&#39;s chest. He was very apprehensive but also anxiously excited about meeting up with Lucas. Completely unprompted, his cock twitched and quickly rose into a rigid two inch erection. The faint breeze from the lounge aircon tickled the surface, the skin stretched closely around his mini-shaft.<br />
<br />
Hot and stiff, his penis felt so strained, so youthfully shrunken, his naive juvenile arousal wrapped in a covering small and skintight for even his tiny size. His balls were drawn taut as well, churning with what meagre contents they had; little sensitive marbles, in a sac boyishly snug and smooth. Ethan wished they at least LOOKED teenaged -- maybe some looser skin or wrinkles or wispy pubic hair -- anything that would make him appear a bit older, so he could pretend he was just really small.<br />
<br />
But ... he couldn&#39;t escape the ever-present developmental lag.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t merely that he was incredibly under-endowed. It was more that he was physically 17 years old, but sexually not even in his teens.<br />
<br />
Ethan nervously swallowed and tried to keep talking, wanting to touch the terrible perfection of his cock, but even more to keep Eric&#39;s concentration from wandering downward and noticing his embarrassing indiscretion before the ad break was over.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think, um ... maybe ... I might see him. I haven&#39;t decided.&quot; He quickly changed the subject, trying to ignore the distressingly pleasant throbbing feeling that his boyfriend&#39;s name had evoked, how unavoidably stiff he had become from the mention alone. &quot;Do- ... do you want to do anything tomorrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. I think I&#39;ll just stay home, or maybe go to the park later on.&quot; Eric bit his lip as he thought. &quot;Actually, do you think you can drop by the mall and pick me up some more underwear? I thought we got enough last time, but I guess I need a few more spare pairs. I don&#39;t want to go back borrowing your old ones,&quot; he chuckled.<br />
<br />
Borrowing his old ones? Just like the &#39;swapping again too soon&#39; line, Ethan didn&#39;t understand this. Why would Eric borrow anything of his? There was NO WAY Eric&#39;s junk had ever fit Ethan&#39;s old clothes -- that didn&#39;t make sense at all!<br />
<br />
Still, it was probably a good idea to get them both a few more pairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool. Thanks Ethan.&quot; Eric drained what was left of his can, then abruptly sat up and stood, his cock sliding off his leg to swing back and forth. &quot;Must be thirsty, I&#39;m getting another soda. I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, he was off, his oversized junk bouncing proudly as he padded out to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
With a burst of horror, Ethan knew Eric would see his uncontrollable little hardon the second he reappeared, and he didn&#39;t want that! Without stopping to think, his mind went to Lucas, and he gripped the thin hard rod between his thumb and index finger. He hardly had to move at all to rub up and down the whole length, knowing the shameful truth that he wouldn&#39;t need long at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good thing I have the stamina of a kid, and I&#39;m sensitive as a kid,&quot; he whispered to himself, stifling a moan as he masturbated faster up and down, before he let out a soft gasp, &quot;because I&#39;m Babycock Ethan, and I- ... &quot; he tensed up, less than ten strokes in, &quot; ... am really- ... hggh! ... really- ... nngh! ... small!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a muffled groan, Ethan&#39;s tiny cock spasmed, spitting out a couple of splashes of milky liquid onto his leg, a burst of intense humiliating pleasure jolting through him. Snatching up his discarded boxers, he hastily wiped himself clean, the scant evidence of wetness gone in two seconds, before he dropped them right back where they had been.<br />
<br />
The next second, the younger brother was walking through the lounge entry, new soda in hand and package on full casual display.<br />
<br />
All Eric saw was his fit older brother, sporting the same weird confused-clueless expression he&#39;d had all evening, staring glassy-eyed at the TV, pink-cheeked like he&#39;d just gone for a run, and with the little borrowed soft 11 year old dick nestled serenely in his crotch.<br />
<br />
He loved his brother SO much, but Ethan really was acting like a space case.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the unannounced swap actually had surprised Ethan somehow?<br />
<br />
He thumped back onto the couch, and snuggled up against his brother&#39;s side again.<br />
<br />
On second thought ... nah. Eric turned his thoughts back to the TV, the ad break finishing. He was imagining it. There was nothing wrong with Ethan. The older Morales just been busy with school all week. All he needed was a break and some time outside the house. A trip to the mall should do it.<br />
<br />
Maybe he could even txt Ethan&#39;s crush to meet him there?<br />
<br />
If there was one thing that could fix his brother&#39;s mood, it had to be Lucas.</p>
