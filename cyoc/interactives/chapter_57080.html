<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Don't think so loud Sarah... &quot; Kira, AKA Monkey Prince thought back to her, &quot;Do you know <br />
WHY their barrier of perception exists?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It exists so people don't feel uncomfortable around us. Don't feel like they need to <br />
constantly ask how we're doing like we're invalids. So people don't worry about us getting <br />
stolen or broken. This way, they peacefully accept us as we are. Also, it means we can <br />
serve our purpose without worry about taxes or a draft.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds somewhat dishonest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What would be dishonest if went inside a theater, became a decoration, then walked out <br />
when the show was over, or stuffed our faces at a restaurant and then became a Cigar <br />
Indians . . . We give up a lot for this existence beautiful. I mean a lot. But it's always <br />
peaceful, you're always as you want to appear, you get to see some truths of people, and <br />
you get to see history roll by.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah said, &quot;Tell that to Penny's fiancee who was in the museum with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me I know. This becomes a curse if you didn't chose it. But there's always the <br />
difference between the hermit and the exile. Killing someone out of self defense, and <br />
murdering someone who can't fight back. ... The still world ain't for everyone beautiful. <br />
And it wouldn't be right if it was, what's the point of a audience without a show? And me? <br />
If anyone else wants to play the game and win they're welcome to it, but I've had my fill of <br />
that constantly moving chaotic world, I'll stick with the still one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Death is still too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't scared of death, I've done some things that earn me a <br />
place in Hell. BUt that actually wasn't believe it or not my reason.  And if this was death, <br />
you wouldn't have front row seat of The Moving doing their thing. Besides, it's not like <br />
we're a total non-factor in existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you figure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ame-no-Uzume-no-mikoto.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was Ulysses!  Sarah turned her perception (not wondering how she was able to turn <br />
her view when her body was frozen in place), and saw the teenage purple lupman lad <br />
before her... why was he so small? It took Sarah a moment to realize that she was the one <br />
who had gotten bigger, she had been so intrigued by Kira that she hadn't noticed she was <br />
now the the size of the room like the other statues. 'Other statues.' That choice of words <br />
rang through her head.<br />
<br />
Ulysses looked up at the giant wolf headed woman, a strange look of respect on his face. <br />
And something about his body language seemed different, but not in a bad way. &quot;I just <br />
want to say thank you, you've always been an inspiration to me. I may not be part of Amy's <br />
religion, nor do I want to be. But your story has always inspired me. And I want to thank <br />
you or that.&quot; Ulysses said knowing he was talking to 'just a statue' and felt slightly silly for <br />
it, but it felt right.  <br />
<br />
Ulysses figure both Amy and Anne would throw a fit over what he did next if they found <br />
out but he hugged the giant purple statue.  <br />
<br />
Sarah had no idea what happened next, as she felt a tingling actually go through her entire <br />
body when Ulysses made this simple gesture. What was even more disturbing is how she <br />
was sure that she could feel him even though he was no longer touching her, she could <br />
feel where he was, what he was feeling, almost what he was thinking! <br />
<br />
&quot;The goddess of Dawn and Revelry, who brought the sun goddess Amaterasu out of hiding <br />
and saving the world from freezing over... &quot; Ulysses said smiling at the statue. <br />
<br />
He looked at Sunny and smiled and nodded too, &quot;Not that the rest of you aren't beautiful <br />
too.&quot; <br />
<br />
He looked at Sarah/Ame-no-Uzume-no-mikoto again and left.<br />
<br />
But Sarah COULD STILL FEEL HIM, even as he went into the next room, she knew exactly <br />
where he was in that next room, it was like a shadow of her was walking along side him <br />
almost constantly. <br />
<br />
It didn't occur to Sarah once to simply leave the still world, she told herself it was to make <br />
sure Sydney didn't do anything foolish, but at the same time, she was intrigued by what <br />
just happened. <br />
<br />
'He called me beautiful.' Sydney thought, when was the last time anyone had called her <br />
beautiful? For the last couple decades she had felt like nothing more than a fixture at her <br />
job, now at least she was called beautiful! <br />
<br />
Sunny said, &quot;By process of elimination, and by the platter you're holding, that makes you <br />
Uke Mochi... a food goddess who the god of the moon killed after the way she produced a <br />
feast from her body openings disgusted him.  That avatar Kira mentioned said something <br />
about the story now having a 'kiss and make up' by proxy epilogue with us...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sydney heard and understood what Sunny said (except for the 'avatar' thing). <br />
<br />
The siblings Terri and Sandi walked through the entry way, barely giving the five statues <br />
any mind, after all, they had been commissioned since before the two of them were born.  <br />
<br />
Sydney thought about this, and realized, 'They ignore me, and I didn't feel bad about it...' <br />
Sydney thought. 'Uke Mochi huh? A goddess who made food out of her rear and was <br />
murdered for it?... Alright then.' Sydney thought. She then 'looked at Luna' 'I forgive you.'<br />
<br />
'Huh?'<br />
<br />
'I forgive you for killing me.' <br />
<br />
'Uh, that wasn't me you know, and that wasn't you.'<br />
<br />
'All the same, I forgive you.'<br />
<br />
Luna wasn't sure what was wrong with her when she replied, 'I accept your forgiveness.' <br />
<br />
The Monkey Prince didn't know if Ame-no-Uzume-no-mikoto would chose to stay or not, <br />
but Uke Mochi it seemed was already coming around. <br />
<br />
Later, when Luna's mind nodded off, she had a dream, of walking on the moon. And <br />
meeting in a circle a Felman and Leoman with fur patterns much like hers, a dragon whose <br />
scales matched her fur, a gargoyle carved to resemble the serpent like oriental dragon, a <br />
human male with a sword in a kimono.  She didn't remember what they all talked about <br />
when she woke up. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't just a matter of mind control of course.&quot; Marie-Eliza said, &quot;While the witches had <br />
destroyed the people they once were, and had rewritten them -again- whenever they <br />
deviated from what the witches wanted...  The witches had basically let the familiars run <br />
wild doing as they please without much if anything in the way of discipline. And being <br />
children, certain concepts of good and evil simply went above their heads. They witches <br />
had given them total reign over the witches house, and Marie Cruz had taken that away... <br />
they wouldn't be tripping over themselves to thank her for that....  <br />
<br />
The towns people on the other hand, they with the fog of the witches geass gone from <br />
their minds, were more than ready to accept Marie Cruz had done the right and proper <br />
thing as a 'witch hunter' and they called her as such positively even though she loathed the <br />
title. <br />
<br />
Free, and the witch pride minus Twilight would of course now by default of the power <br />
structure change their fidelity to Joella once the witches were dead. And Joella of course, <br />
being what she was, had no desire for violence of ANY kind against other people of Man.<br />
<br />
The children driven mad by the candy of course had to heal the old fashioned way as they <br />
found a balance with the infinite chaos within themselves, and the former mob members <br />
were already quite sane but had no families as they remembered them to return to. <br />
<br />
Like I said, not all or Marie Cruz's companions approved of her choice to let the former <br />
mob members, Ben's family, the witch pride, and of course Joella be... But it would not be <br />
the only thing.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
1689<br />
<br />
Gaal, Gogatha, Gomorrah awoke to their minds in a fog, and wrapped in rope and their <br />
hands bound and tied, along with their eyes blind folded and in a sitting position that was <br />
not pleasant. That was when they heard the dog's voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am only going to ask this once. Where are your animal familiars? Where are any of all text <br />
you own regarding to your arcane talents?&quot;<br />
<br />
They tried to turn her into ashes, or crush her wind pipe or boil her blood... but it was like <br />
their magic was smoke they could not grasp. <br />
<br />
They screamed and rants for three whole minutes before they felt someone strikes in the <br />
face in succession. <br />
<br />
&quot;Will you answer?&quot; The dog's voice again. <br />
<br />
&quot;NEVER YOU BEOTCH!&quot; Gaal swore for her little sisters. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sister Kathrine. Linus. Leave. Father Draco, as is required by law: stay.&quot; <br />
<br />
They hear the putting on of gloves, and the grasp of instruments. <br />
<br />
The dog said again, &quot;When I said I was going to only ask once? I lied.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Kathrine covered her ears, her tail going into knots at the screams that came through the <br />
door. Linus simply went about trying to put their other 'prisoners' into some semblance of <br />
order. <br />
<br />
She looked fearfully at the door, 'Is that really Marie doing that? How CAN she do this? <br />
SHE'S A NUN! We aren't supposed to do acts of violence...' Kathrine realized what she just <br />
thought and thunder struck her mind. <br />
<br />
She looked at the two female leomans who guts she had cut open, and vomited. She then <br />
took the spear she had brought from home all the way from Europe ... and threw it in the <br />
unlit fire-place. She then vomited again. <br />
<br />
She then took her rosy and locked herself in a room, sobbing and praying was heard on <br />
the other side for the rest of the day. <br />
<br />
Marie came out several hours later, not a speck of blood on her (after all, to draw blood <br />
during torture was uncivilized), with Father Draco staying behind to guard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you find what you wanted to know?&quot; Linus asked in a calm even controlled, restrained <br />
voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I found out what I needed to know.&quot; Marie heard Kathrine's sobbing on the other side <br />
of a door next to her, and tried to open it to find it locked. <br />
<br />
Marie shuddered.</p>
