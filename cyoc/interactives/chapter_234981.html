<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus was in a panic. As he was driving home several were-beasts could be seen. he narrowly avoided abandoned cars as he finally got to his neighborhood. he about had a heart attack when he saw a broken mirror and the warped sticky mailbox. he fumbled for his keys as something watched him from behind a tree.  <br />
<br />
the figure licked their lips and watched the man run into his house. Marcus rushed in not caring if he shut the door. he had to get his kids and wife out of the area. &quot;Lucy!&quot; he yelled. he had reported to several outbreaks of Lunar Ecstasy in the last few hours.  <br />
<br />
he didn&#39;t know what had happened to his wife. was she safe or infected? he prayed that she had picked up the kids today and drove out of the city before dusk. reaching into his pocket he dialed her number. his breath caught in his thought as he heard her ringtone. the theme of &#39;the dark and the light&#39; was heard as he approached the recliner and saw her phone&#39;s light as it rang in the gap between the seat and arm. he reached into the gap of the recliner and pulled out a large scrape of cloth with a pocket.  <br />
<br />
the phone continued to buzz within it. &quot;LUCY!&quot; he yelled even louder as he ran to check the rest of the house. he followed a series of large dents in the floor to a broken door. shards of wood were on the floor next to a trash can filled with even more and a broken mug. Marcus was in full panic as he went to his and his wife&#39;s bedroom.  <br />
<br />
Lucy&#39;s bathrobe was missing from its place in the closet and she was nowhere to be seen. he couldn&#39;t believe this. he reported to scenes of were-beasts all day and never thought to call his wife. distraught he flopped down on his bed and rubbed his eyes. gabbing his phone he dialed 91... before he pressed the final number a slam could be heard from the front of the house.  <br />
<br />
he immediately got up and went to his safe in the closet. he put the numbers in and pulled out his gun. he hoped it was his wife or kids coming home but even so if they were infected they might not be in their right minds. however, it could be a were-beast intending to infect him. truth be told he didn&#39;t want to kill or even hurt them but he had heard that fear can sometimes knock some sense into their lust-fueled minds.  <br />
<br />
even if it worked for just a moment he knew that if he could make it to his car he could drive out of there before the were-beast knew what happened. he opened the door as quietly as he could and walked down the hall. a pair of eyes followed him as he passed by the bathroom. it silently stepped out from behind the bathroom&#39;s curtain and approached him. approaching the living room he saw the door was shut and the coat rack was blocking it.  <br />
<br />
all of a sudden a maroon-furred hand wrapped around his mouth as another grasped his gun. A struggle happened before the gun was thrown shattering a picture on the wall of the family in the mountains. Marcus was then thrown back into the hall landing on his back. he was wheezing as he struggled to open his eyes, when he did he saw a were-unicorn approaching him. They had both breasts and a cock so it was a herm.  <br />
<br />
while it looked no bigger than him he knew that were-beast&#39;s strength was stronger concerning their muscle mass than a human&#39;s. they pounced on him and stripped off his pants and underwear in one fell swoop. when Marcus attempted to scoot back the were-unicorn placed their hand on his abdomen and grabbed his cock with the other. &quot;please don&#39;t. you bot thinking clearly&quot; Marcus pleaded. smirking the unicorn replied. &quot;Don&#39;t worry neighbor. You&#39;ll like it trust me&quot; Though their voice was a mix of man and woman Marcus recognized it as Mr. Chen.  <br />
<br />
Chen then put his equine lips over Marcus&#39;s cock and began to suck. Marcus couldn&#39;t help but moan as the process began. Golden brown fur started appearing on his arms his red hair began to grow longer and encircle his head. tan fur covered his growing balls as his cock gained barbs. the tan fur spread up his front and covered his growing muzzle.  <br />
<br />
his blue eyes glowed as he cumed. &quot;not even done changing and cuming already&quot; Chen said as he gulped the precious liquid down. suddenly they were pushed off of Marcus as his muscles tore what remained of his outfit. a fur-less tail grows as his nails darken. he crouched on his raised ankles and pads and ponced onto the unicorn.  <br />
<br />
a tuft of fur grew on the tip of his tail and he plunged his cock into them. the last remnants of his shoes and socks fell off and he humped the herm with reckless abandon. this time it was the unicorn who moaned in pleasure while Marcus kept growing. soon the eight-foot lion had the muscles of a bodybuilder. both he and the unicorn cummed causing him to be covered in Chen&#39;s cum.  <br />
<br />
Marcus passed out as Chen&#39;s lust came down. looking in front of him he was regretful at the memories of what he had done. he should have at least asked how Marcus wanted to change. he then dragged the heavy were-lion to the bedroom. hopefully, he would wake before the sun rose. the picture fell to the ground after they slammed the door. Marcus, his wife Lucy, Cameron the oldest, Kate the middle child and Samantha their youngest all smiled with a large rip down the picture. it then tipped over hiding the faces of the family as they used to be a few months ago. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Cameron sighed as she looked around the cafeteria. the city officials had quarantined them in this room due to their exposure to lunar ecstasy. two days had passed since that drug dealer had dumped the stuff into the vats and in that time their school got new sugar packets and other items made with the tainted sugar. she remembered the outbreak that happened during lunch. she and her friends grew breasts except for Justin and Simon.  <br />
<br />
Simon became a hulking seven-foot male were-raccoon while Marcus gained a vagina and became a were-dragon herm. this caused an orgy at the high school. Cameron never thought she&#39;d lose her virginity from this. The six-footed rabbit sighed at the fifth shot she had gotten. it had to be given every hour due to their libido or they would be like those outside.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Kate pumped his cock while he sat on the bleachers of the gym. The seven-and-a-half-foot horse was the only were-beast without a mate and it was torture. the police had sealed all the doors to the gym until morning just because the coach had given them all tainted lemonade without realizing it. speaking of the herm bear was being pleasured by both the basketball captain and the head cheerleader. both the kangaroo and elephant (the head cheerleader) had their cocks plunged into their mouth and pussy, it was so hot.  <br />
<br />
after cuming again a brief moment of clarity came to him. he was in middle school how did he have this adult body? As quickly as it came it went away. he then decided to settle for one of the girl&#39;s were-beasts mouths instead of their pussy&#39;s. outside the police held themselves at the gym&#39;s inner entrance. &quot;they&#39;re just kids&quot; a female officer sighed. &quot;yeah but that lunar stuff is only made for adults and at the most late teens so...&quot; the man next to her jabbed behind him at the sight behind the small windows in the doors.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Samantha drugs his long tail out of the school. he was sick and tired of jacking off his twin penises. the ladies inside that did know how to please him were already occupied. the were-snake sniffed the air with his tongue. the schoolyard was in a state of destruction.  <br />
<br />
Several doors were busted open. the cars outside were dented and flipped. cum from both cock and pussy covered several surfaces. flopping down Sam used his instincts to slither rather than run. he found he was very fast this way. a were-rhino waved at him as he slithered away. suddenly a thud was heard.  <br />
<br />
turning his long neck the were-snake saw the rhino was now out cold. he hissed as he saw a group of were-beasts with dart guns. they wore SWAT-like armor and were varying in terms of animal. not willing to run or back down Sam charged at them. the were-crow flew up and voided his jaws.  <br />
<br />
then he felt a sharp pain on his left leg and grabbed the syringe with his arm. it was too late though as the sedative did its work very quickly. &quot;outside of the elementary school is secured&quot; the were-crow said. &quot;good work jones&quot; the leader said. he was a nine-foot werewolf with the words &#39;leader&#39; on his right shoulder.   <br />
<br />
the mayor had requested that several were-beats who were officers would go in and prevent further spreading of the virus. Lincoln was one of the first officers to get his with the stuff during the first year of the product. he then went on to train any officers who were infected to be able to control their new instincts during the night. a large armor-plated van came down the road and they put the two into the back. &quot;sir at this rate the zoo will be jam-packed with these guys in no time&quot; Officer Trevor (first name and no relation to Winston).  <br />
<br />
the were-cat had a point. the male section was the most of their problems. the aquarium is where they put the herms and the high school is where the female were-beasts went. keeping the three apart helped lower their &#39;issues&#39; except for the herms of course. &quot;if we can clear out the elementary school then it can be used as a secondary location.&quot; Lincoln said. the were-swat went inside to secure it while the van drove the male were-beasts to the zoo for now. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Lucy passed over the fallen picture frame and gun. he didn&#39;t even care what that meant. what he knew was that he could smell a female in heat. he approached his bedroom and found the door locked. unhindered Lucy punched the door knocking it off its hinges and leaving a large impact spot. he then saw a were-lion the same size and build as him plunging his cock into a unicorn herms pussy.  <br />
<br />
he should be the one with that unicorn. it was his house and how dare some were-beasts use it instead of him. With a below, he charged at the lion as he wanted that pussy for himself. the were-lion felt himself be pulled off of his partner and thrown into the closet causing several clothes to fall on him as well as breaking one of the doors. looking up he saw Lucy approach him in a challenging stance all were-beasts knew instinctively. grinning the were-lion leapt from the ground and lunged at the bull.   <br />
<br />
however, Lucy anticipated this and ducked before grabbing his leg and swinging the were-lion into a vanity. the more used to being a were-beast the more control one has over most of their instincts. As a result, Lucy was just slightly more experienced than the were-lion. the were-beast charged at Lucy and got a swift kick to the family jewels. As a result, a hurt meow was heard as he dropped to his knees. Lucy took this opportunity to put the lion into a choke hold. As he struggled Lucy got a scent from the were-lion familiar yet different. all the while the were-unicorn watched the men fight over them as they pinched their nipples and jacked off.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
officer Patrick threw another smoke grande into the quarantine zone. the smoke was mixed with lavender and several other chemicals that scientists learned to work well on were-beasts. a male were-Cerberus and herm were-triceratops fell into a peaceful slumber as they stumbled out of the smoke. Several others were also out when the smoke cleared. &quot;how many more do we have&quot; a fellow officer went to check for him. &quot;we only have seven left&quot; the officer replied.  <br />
<br />
Patrick sighed as they had over thirty at the beginning of this quarantine. they weren&#39;t prepared for an outbreak of this scale. &quot;fine call them in and get a team here to put them in the designated areas&quot; Patrick commanded. none of the officers noticed some dark shadows high in the sky. Several flying were-beasts passed over them. a were-falcon landed outside the quarantine zone and saw a target. he flapped his wings rose from the roof and chased the unknowing target.</p>
