<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leah woke up the next morning feeling more rested and refreshed than she ever had in her life. Her dreams had been filled with warm cuddles and soft soothing voices instead of the usual surprise quizzes or forgotten pants. She reached down and felt the soft padding between her legs. It was thicker than the pullups she had been wearing and it forced her legs to remain slightly spread as she lay on her back. She could also feel that it was still dry, though she soon fixed that. She released her hold on her bladder and felt the padding grow warm. A second check showed that the diaper was barely damp. Leah estimated that it could take a few more wettings before it would begin to leak.<br />
<br />
She climbed out of her bed and stood barefoot on the carpet. It was a strange feeling wearing such a thick diaper. she took a few experimental steps and found that it was difficult to walk without a distinct waddle. She paced up and down her room for a bit until she got the hang of it. Then she decided to experiment with crawling and got down on all fours. It was much easier to move that way and Leah spent several minutes crawling around, smiling broadly behind her pacifier. Before long her belly let out a slight rumble and Leah realized just how hungry she was. She hadn&#39;t eaten anything since yesterday and that was just a little snack. She decided it would be a good idea to fix that now.<br />
<br />
Leah crawled to her bedroom door and reached up to turn the knob. When the door swung open she crawled through and made her way down the hall to the stairs, crinkling all the way. When she arrived at the stairs she contemplated standing and trying to waddle down but dismissed that idea. Instead she turned and scooted down backwards like a small child would. Reaching the bottom in one piece, she turned and crawled into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Leah,&quot; said a voice, startling the girl, &quot;I thought I heard you coming down the stairs. Glad to see you&#39;re taking to your new role so well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina was sitting at the kitchen table, wearing her bathrobe and drinking coffee. She looked down at Leah who had frozen in the entrance to the kitchen. Leah blushed as her stepmother looked her over with a critical eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re probably hungry right now. Do you need a change before I feed you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leah shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. It will take a bit for me to make you breakfast. I&#39;ll get you a bottle to tide you over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina stood up an walked to the fridge. Leah watched as she pulled out a jug of milk and then reached into a cupboard and retrieved a baby bottle. The bottle was bigger than a standard one, large enough for her. Tina filled it and then walked into the living room, gesturing for Leah to follow. She did, crawling along after her stepmother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crawl up onto the couch,&quot; Tina said, &quot;I&#39;ll put some cartoons on and you can drink this while I cook breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leah obeyed, clambering up onto the cushions and making herself comfortable. Tina took the pacifier from her mouth and handed her the bottle before returning to the kitchen. Leah sat and drank from the bottle while she watched her favorite Sunday morning shows. Drinking from the bottle was odd, but not unpleasant. She enjoyed the way the nipple filled her mouth as she suckled. It took her a while to  finish off the contents, and by the time she did Tina had returned to tell her that breakfast was ready. Leah moved to climb off the couch but Tina didn&#39;t bother waiting and simply picked her up. She carried the small teen into the kitchen and deposited her into her usual seat at the table before sitting down next to her.<br />
<br />
Breakfast was scrambled eggs. Leah reached for her fork but Tina picked it up first. She scooped up some eggs and began making airplane noises as she brought it towards Leah&#39;s mouth. Leah giggled at the absurdity of it an opened her mouth to accept the bite. Tina fed her her entire breakfast this way. Sometimes she would fake the girl out, eliciting a giggle from the diapered teen. When the bowl was empty Tina took it to the sink and rinsed it out. Then she refilled the bottle and returned to the table.<br />
<br />
Leah reached for the bottle but Tina held it up out of her reach and stooped to pick the teen up again. She carried Leah back into the living room and sat down with the girl on her lap. Tina adjusted her stepdaughter&#39;s position, laying her down so her head was nestled in the crook of her arm. Then she held the bottle up to her lips. Leah got the message and opened up to accept the rubber nipple. She closed her eyes for a moment and drank deeply. When she opened them a again she looked up at her stepmother and then hurriedly tried to look away again.<br />
<br />
When Tina had sat down her robe had fallen open slightly. When she had been pushing Leah into position it had shifted even more and now one bare breast was entirely exposed. Leah kept trying to turn away from the sight but Tina&#39;s firm grip kept her captive. Tina noticed Leah&#39;s discomfort, then noticed her own wardrobe malfunction, and misinterpreted it completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;No no, sweetie.&quot; She chided, pulling her robe partly back into place. &quot;Mine don&#39;t work like that. I haven&#39;t had a baby before. I&#39;ve heard that you can get some pills, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
She trailed off, lost in sudden thought. Leah did not like the way this was going. She tried to wiggle away from the bottle so she could correct her stepmother, but Tina just held her firmer. She then tried to drain the bottle quickly, but between her earlier one and breakfast she was feeling quite full and the nipple didn&#39;t allow for fast drinking anyway. To make matters worse, when Tina had pulled her robe back over she had left it hanging loose. Leah could still clearly see her entire breast and, as she watched, Tina&#39;s nipple seemed to swell and stick out even more. Leah closed her eyes again again, in defense this time, and focused on draining the bottle.<br />
<br />
When she finally started sucking air instead of milk Tina pulled the bottle away. Leah turned to roll off her stepmother&#39;s lap and make her escape, but Tina didn&#39;t release her grip. Instead, Leah found herself being pulled closer. She cracked one eye to see what Tina was up to and opened both in shock. Tina had pulled both sides of her robe fully open and Leah was staring down a large pink nipple as she was drawn inexorably towards it. She made the mistake of opening her mouth to protest and Tina chose that moment to pull her fully onto her breast. Tina&#39;s nipple seemed to fill her mouth even more than the bottle had, even though it was smaller. She tried to push it out with her tongue, but once again Tina completely failed to understand her stepdaughter&#39;s actions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t lap at it.&quot; She explained calmly. &quot;You need to lock your lips around the base and suck. Try to keep you teeth away, they&#39;re sharp and I&#39;m a little sensitive. I know I don&#39;t have any milk, but feel free to suckle as long as you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leah kept struggling for a bit longer, but her stepmother just kept holding her and explaining the proper suckling method over and over again. Eventually she had no choice but to give in. With great reluctance she formed her lips into the shape Tina demonstrated for her and gave a few experimental sucks. It was an extremely odd feeling, far odder than the pacifier had been when she first tried it, but at the same time it was even more soothing than the pacifier as well. Without knowing quite how, she soon lost herself in the sensation. After some indeterminate length of time she felt Tina gently pull her away. She released, but glowered up at Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t give me that look.&quot; Tina admonished. &quot;I&#39;m just switching sides. My nipple was starting to get a bit sore and babies should feed evenly anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
She helped Leah turn around on her lap and attach herself to the other breast. As Leah suckled she found herself wondering what breast milk would taste like. She swore that she had read somewhere that it tasted like very sweet milk. She thought about Tina&#39;s comment about the pills and wondered if that meant she might get to taste it someday. She dismissed the thought. It was just too silly. She continued to suck for several minutes more, then Tina gently pulled her away again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, that&#39;s enough for now. We can do this some more later if you feel like it, but I&#39;m going to need some time to recover.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina helped her to the floor again and then stood up. Her robe had come completely undone and now swung open. Leah was left face-to-face with her stepmother&#39;s well-trimmed pubes. Tina didn&#39;t seem to care. She casually walked out of the room and up the stairs leaving Leah alone with her now rather flustered thoughts.</p>
