<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Deep underground in the middle of the Nevadan Desert, a vast, expansive underground laboratory base stretched as far and as wide as a small town, all dedicated to the study of what could be deemed &quot;anomalous extraterrestrial material&quot;. The main laboratory level however had a mixture of a standard set up - replete with various beakers, holding areas that contained various mutant life forms that occasionally squirmed and paced within their containment zones, and tables holding a large variety of tissue samples - and a strange folksy home area. The home location of the deepground base was decorated as if one was nostalgic for the 1980s.<br />
<br />
Various sports banners hung up on the walls, old pictures of famous musicians, and an assortment of distantly remembered fashions stuffed into a large wall closet, kept in a certain order. Pants, then shirts, then tank tops, then jackets and coats. A dresser pressed against a wall, holding a few more clothes as well as headbands and gloves. You could almost be forgiven for thinking this was someone&#39;s attempt at their own themed home amidst this vast scientific undertaking.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t, however, exactly the home of any of the scientists.<br />
<br />
The bed at the corner of this odd part of the laboratory, flanked by a weight set and a boom box, was presently where an odd young man sat, dressed only in a pair of tight red boxers as he finished up a set of bicep curls, arm pressed against his inner thigh. In many ways he looked like a charming throwback much like the rest of the room. He seemed to be roughly eighteen  years old, his blond hair was styled into a thick, curly 80s mullet, he stood about six and a half feet tall and was impressively muscled - befitting the golden age of fitness and bodybuilding. His body was tan, and from a distance, one might mistake it for simple tanned skin.<br />
<br />
However a closer look would show that his body below the neck was covered in a thick exoskeleton, by far stronger than human skin but still giving the look of impeccable musculature. The young man was impressively sculpted, his body in the form of a sort of peak human masculinity despite a close look denying that he was fully human.<br />
<br />
His ears were flush to his skin, small and barely present yet every bit as capable as a normal human ear.<br />
<br />
A spike, visible through his boxers, extended where his tailbone might&#39;ve been, giving the impression that whatever species the young man originated from, they likely had some form of spiked tail. Yet all that remained of it at present was a spike above his rear. <br />
<br />
His fingers ended in slightly longer nails than what most humans had - and sharper, too.<br />
<br />
His eyes were the best hint that this was not at least wholly a human - they were bright purple in coloration, with far less sclera than most humans. However even with his alien eyes, the young man still gave a charmingly boyish look. A good natured young sportsman energy from the era he had been styled to reflect. The natural armor was smoother and softer looking on his face, the most human-like.<br />
<br />
Once he felt he was done with the weight, the young man dropped the weight - and then cheekily grinned, turned to the mirror by his bed and flexed his arms. All he had known for most of his life had been this place. This context. This odd little condition - but he&#39;d seen a couple of the scientists do this when they worked out, and felt proud of their exercise. And he felt very proud of the burning in the muscles underneath his exoskeleton.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoying your fitness routine, Adam?&quot; <br />
<br />
The young alien humanoid turned to look at the door as it slid open in tune with the entrance of a pair of scientists.<br />
<br />
Doctor Lucas Mendrick was a 45 year old man with dark brown eyes who styled his black hair back to try and disguise the much lamented decline in his hairline. For a man used to being very attractive, this decline was a thing he tried his hardest to deny. Yet even still, Doctor Mendrick kept himself as fit as he could. His abs showed through his tight white shirt a bit, and though his pecs weren&#39;t as big as his young creation&#39;s, they were still reasonably impressive. He wore his white lab coat tight, and his black pants similarly a size too small - every small display of vanity he could manage in spite of his encroaching age. He was at least grateful he hadn&#39;t developed too many wrinkles.<br />
<br />
Doctor Mina Lambert was a young prodigy - 29 years old and already participating in such clandestine, underground activities as this for the government. She had long, flowing blond hair, green eyes, and a slightly pale countenance. She wore a white blouse under her coat, and the fit was tight enough that Adam would, every time she visited, find himself biting his lip and trying to not glance at her prodigious breasts. Not helping matters were her tight pants, all the better to show off her rear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Mina said as she looked over the data from Adam&#39;s workout routine, &quot;You seem to have been trying harder lately. Really pushing the amount of weight you&#39;ve been handling. Anything causing that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam was the name they chose for the young alien hybrid they&#39;d so created. A combination of strange alien biomass harvested and then combined with human genetic information - the result being the young specimen currently sitting on his bed. &quot;Well,&quot; Adam said with a smile, &quot;I really liked the movies you got me. But I noticed the men in them were so much---so much <i>bigger</i> than me. Arnold Schwarzenegger I think the name was. He has such a body! And I wanted to look more like that!&quot; <br />
<br />
Adam flexed an arm, grinning when he saw how well it seemed to be going already. &quot;I know I&#39;m not exactly human. But I---I wanna look as good as a movie star! Maybe one day I could even be the first hybrid leading man...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s...cute, Adam. It&#39;s great that you&#39;re so motivated.&quot; Mina said, concealing a blush at just how endearing the young hybrid could be. She knew it was completely unprofessional, possibly even illegal. But she could feel a degree of attraction to the hybrid athlete. There was a degree of sweetness to him that seemed absent in the more jaded, older men here. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright young man, let&#39;s get the examination going. Drop trou!&quot; Doctor Mendrick said with a smirk. &quot;We can see how buff you are, let&#39;s see how well everything else looks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam lightly bit his lip - being that he had natural armor instead of skin, he couldn&#39;t blush as well - but the body language communicated it as well as anything. He stood up and pulled down his boxers. He felt especially awkward around Doctor Lambert. She made him feel...well, there were some of his movies that had intimate scenes. And whenever the movie got to that point, the way that the man acted...well. Doctor Lambert made Adam feel like that. He&#39;d picked up on the word &quot;horny&quot;.<br />
<br />
Doctor Lambert wasn&#39;t exactly dissuaded by the state of Adam&#39;s genitals. His testicles seemed to be pulled up against him in an armored singular organ, and his manhood looked like a slick, thick tendril ending in a crest with a slight opening in it. <br />
<br />
Doctor Mendrick leaned forward and pulled on a pair of gloves, pressing his hand against Adam&#39;s strange, alien sex organ. <br />
<br />
Being Adam was not entirely socialized, the moment he felt the hand press against him in such a way, Adam gasped and groaned, &quot;Mmm...my cock! My cock feels so good! Keep---keep touching---!!&quot; He&#39;d only ever really touched himself down there in the dead of night, when curiosity took hold. He&#39;d only rarely had someone handle him like that for an examination.<br />
<br />
Lucas for his part just chuckled as he looked over to see a blushing Mina. &quot;Adam,&quot; the older male doctor said with a slight scolding tone, &quot;Are you really that wound up? Do you just need a moment to not overreact...?&quot; He then chuckled. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m sorry, sir,&quot; Adam looked down, biting his lip, &quot;I didn&#39;t know that people weren&#39;t supposed to let it be known like that...your hand just felt so good!&quot; Every day, there seemed to be some social cue he missed or thing he said that didn&#39;t mesh with expectations set among humans. All Adam wanted was to fit in, to be like them, but it seemed he had a lot to learn. <br />
<br />
Lucas looked down at the nude Adam, admitting to himself that Mina wasn&#39;t the only one to have odd feelings for their experiment. Lucas had gone his entire life as a straight man, but seeing and meeting Adam had him thinking about things he hadn&#39;t ever really considered. Maybe it was some kind of scientific ego within him, thinking about sex with this hybrid as one more step for him in terms of what he&#39;d achieved - being the first man to do something like that. Some Captain Jack stuff as it were.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re fine, Adam.&quot; Lucas then looked at Mina and back at their experiment. &quot;Do you need a moment to achieve release? So you&#39;re not quite so overcharged when I give you the examination?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mina bit her lip.<br />
<br />
And Adam pressed his hands into his bed, gulping, &quot;Uhh, you mean---masturbate?&quot; He then awkwardly grinned, &quot;I---I mean, I&#39;ve---it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve---&quot; Adam then calmed himself down a bit from his flustered state, &quot;...Yeah, yeah I think I could do with some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas then glanced over at Mina, and both nodded at one another as if accepting that they both had some... ideas. Then Lucas looked Adam in the eye and said, &quot;Or. We could get ahead to another phase of the examination. If you&#39;d like it, Adam. We need a sample of your bio-data to confirm how your reproductive systems are handled. Would you like Doctor Lambert to assist you in calming down? Or would you like me to help you out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam sat there on the bed. He&#39;d be blushing like crazy if he could. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d long, LONG wanted - even fantasized about - Doctor Mina Lambert touching him in that kind of way. Letting him touch her like in those movies. Let her feel his smooth exoskeleton, run her hands through his hair, he could flex for her and let her see how strong he&#39;d gotten. Ohh, man, Adam wanted to press his cock within her. Let her feel it move, thrust...just thinking about her touching him made him feel giddy inside.<br />
<br />
But Doctor Lucas Mendrick had a unique presence to him. He was a strong, manly guy - and that kind of contact could allow for Adam to talk to him in the heat of the moment. More man to man about lewd matters than he&#39;d ever been allowed to before. Letting Lucas handle his arousal like that was...also exciting.</p>
