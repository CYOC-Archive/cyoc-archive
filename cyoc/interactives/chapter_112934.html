<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke had difficulties concentrating. “I-I don’t know, man. I think I need to sit down for a second”. With that he stumbled to the couch, closing his eyes and waiting for the world to stop moving.<br />
“Are you alright?” Matt was concerned. It seemed like Luke has caught something, he was sweating heavily and loosening his shirt collar while he leaned against the couch. Matt’s thoughts were racing. He didn’t know much about medicine, only having completed a first aid course some years ago, but it seemed like Luke was burning up and his shirt was constricting him.<br />
“Let me help you”, Matt said and approached Luke carefully. As the other guy nodded slightly, Matt began to unbutton his shirt in order to give him room to breathe. After the first few buttons, Luke helped and crawled out of it as they were finished, leaving him topless.<br />
Matt let his gaze wander over Luke’s upper body. He never noticed how well build that guy was; Matt had to be going to the gym rather regularly, he figured, as you did not get that kind of body from history majoring. As he was looking at Luke however, he suddenly felt a new feeling – it was like… he wanted to touch that body, to run his tongue over it, embrace it…<br />
He snapped out of these thoughts. That wasn’t him! He was straight. His body seemed to have another opinion though, as he found his jeans visibly tented by a throbbing erection.<br />
Trying to conceal it, Matt plumped down on the couch next to Luke – realizing too late that it was a rather small couch and he had lots of contact to Luke’s exposed skin now.<br />
Luke felt like his head was made of cotton. Just thinking was becoming really tiring and it felt like his concentration and knowledge was draining by the second. Suddenly, he felt Matt arriving next to him and opened his eyes, steel blue now. <br />
“Dude! What are you doing? Are you fucking queer or something?” he exclaimed. The language surprised him for a moment, but then again, he always cursed a lot. It’s how you talk to your homies on the street after all. It was like there was something so very important to remember about that last part, but it just wouldn’t come to him. <br />
“S-sorry Luke”, he heard Matt reply. “But uh, I needed to sit down and… Do you – have you been working out?” What kind of shit was this? Was that queer hitting on him? He looked at the guy, which seemed to have dwindled in mass and jumped up at once. “Are you hard?! You fucking fag!” He almost spit out. That guy shouldn’t get near him again or he’d beat him to a pulp.<br />
“W-what? No, I’m…” Matt responded but didn’t finish. In truth, he wasn’t even sure about it. He found Luke so very attractive it was unreal. He blinked. Did Luke have the tribal tattoo on his right arm a minute ago? And his hair was definitely longer then, he almost looked like he shaved it short. All that only managed to his sex appeal. He couldn’t help but fondle himself through his jeans. “Perhaps I am” he managed to blurt out, blushing. His whole body felt strange. Light and tingly.<br />
“I can’t believe it! Stay were you are, you fucking freak!” He heard Luke say, but Matt didn’t listen. He needed to touch that man. As he got to his feet, he felt his shirt being very loose on him. It didn’t matter. Almost on autopilot, he discard his shirt, his shoes, and socks, even his jeans. He just wanted to hug Luke really tight. Only in his underwear now, he stepped forward again. His skin was tingling all over, and he looked really pale but all that didn’t matter to Matt.<br />
Shit! Luke’s hand flew to his jeans pockets. Where was his knife when he needed it? He remembered being in a knife fight more than once, as several scars on his body could tell. One especially big formed in his face and several others on his torso. Well, no knife, but this fucking fag stepped up to him. Without thinking much (and thinking wasn’t really his specialty now), Luke made a fist and struck hard against Matt, hitting his chest full frontal. He was surprised how rough his skin felt and how light he was. Just that one strike sent him flying backwards, a visible dent in his chest.<br />
Matt barely felt pain, as Luke hit him hard. He was sent flying backwards and lost balance completely. In the short seconds while he was flying, his body underwent dramatic changes: His skin whitened and took on a rough fabric texture. At the same time, his legs, arms and even head retracted into his torso. It felt almost erotic as his cock dwindled away, leaving him as only a white fabric chest. As his back hit the ground, he could feel air escaping from his inside. Apparently he was completely hollow, no organs or bones remaining, as he collapsed to a flat piece of clothing, but still able to feel everything.<br />
He sensed Luke stepping up to him and lifting him from the ground. “Yo, neat. A new wife beater!” He heard the dumbed down voice of his fellow student and felt being stretched around Luke’s naked torso. It was like heaven for him. His entire body was now in skin contact with luke. If he still had a cock, he surely would have shot his load now, but this orgasmic feeling was staying for as long as he was worn.<br />
With a screeching sound, the exit door opened. Luke, the thug quickly left the place with his new wife beater.</p>
