<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff sat in the cupboard buried in the jar of cum leaking spent condoms next to dozens of similarly filled <br />
jars.  It may have been weeks, months, maybe even years. Every once in a while (Jeff assumed it was once a <br />
day, but maybe it was only once a week - how often did they clean that filthy bath house?) for a few minutes, <br />
the janitor would open the cupboard and add a new jar or two. Then he'd shuffle the jars around, and close the <br />
cupboard door  plunging Jeff and the jars into total darkness until next he opened the cupboard door.<br />
<br />
Then finally, one day the janitor took a dozen jars out of the cupboard and closed it back up. Jeff had no <br />
idea what happened to those jars of condoms, but the fact that they left the nearly eternal darkness and <br />
solitude of the cupboard encouraged hope in him.  Even being part of a landfill would be better than sitting <br />
in the darkness for four years - or maybe it was only 2 years now? He had completely lost track of time.<br />
<br />
He had long since become use to the crushing weight of the oozing rubbers on, and the disgusting taste and <br />
smell. How could this be his life?  At least he still had hope of the Chronivac returning him to normal.  <br />
Initially, he assumed it would transport the condom back to his room and then change him back, but as time <br />
passed in the dark solitude of his captivity his mind began to run wild.  <br />
<br />
Would he transform back into human inside the packed jar?  Would he be scarred for life by the chards of glass <br />
as he exploded out of the jar?  Might their be nasty viruses or bacteria growing in the decaying cum?  Would <br />
they infect him, and reduce his life span considerably?  Perhaps the jar wouldn't shatter?  Perhaps he would <br />
end up compressed bloody pulp inside the jar?  Perhaps he would be reduced to bloody pulp as he expanded prior <br />
to the jar exploding?  The police would have an awful time figuring that one out?  Yes, from the amount of <br />
blood, bone fragments, and tissue at least one person died, but the forensic evidence suggests that he was <br />
inside the shattered jar.  But it was too small to fit all a head in let alone a whole body? His nightmares <br />
occurred as he slept or while awake. In the perpetual darkness, he no longer knew if he slept or was awake. <br />
When the door opened or closed, he wondered if it really ever opened or if that too was a hallucination or <br />
dream? It was maddening.  He was sure unless the Chronivac restored his mind to its previous condition, he <br />
would be stark raving mad. He prayed. He became fanatical in his prayers and pleas.  He promised to do good <br />
works if only someone would rescue him.  Then his unanswered prayers made him bitter, and he cursed God and <br />
Satan, and his parents, and the scientists who had designed that infernal Chronivac, and the Chronivac itself. <br />
<br />
If he had been a shade saner, he might have recognized the parallels in his own feelings and those of the old <br />
Arabian Nights tale which had been corrupted into his endless nightmares.  It was the story of the genie in <br />
the bottle.  In his dream, Jeff as he was before walked on a beach and found a bottle with a powerful djinn <br />
trapped inside.  He unstopped the bottle and a plume of white watery cum sprayed out of the vessel and became <br />
the biker who had christened him as a condom.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you had released me after the first thousand years, I would have granted you limitless wishes!&quot; the genie <br />
intones in his black leather arabesque costume with golden chains.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Unlimited wishes?&quot; gasped dream Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you didn't release me then,&quot; snarled the genie, &quot;So I vowed if I was freed I would grant my rescuer three <br />
wishes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I can live with three wishes,&quot; Jeff said eager, &quot;First, I -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silence, mortal. That promise was only binding for the second thousand years of my captivity inside that <br />
lightless cramped bottle! And you did not rescue me in the first thousand years, nor in the second thousand <br />
years!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were in that bottle for over 2000 years?&quot; gasped Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, over,&quot; the genie growled.  He seemed to be growing bigger and bigger as he spoke.  He had started out <br />
as a large man, and now towered several stories over  Jeff. He continued, &quot;If you had rescued me during the <br />
next thousand years, I would have granted you one wish.&quot;  He paused, and added, &quot;But you didn't!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was silent staring at the massively growing leather clad bulge in the genie's loincloth pouch. The <br />
leather seemed to be ripping at the seems as it swelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then during the fourth thousand year period of my captivity, I vowed that the one who liberated me would get <br />
no wishes at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that's okay,&quot; Jeff shrugged, &quot;I really wasn't expecting any wishes anyway when I opened your bottle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha,ha, ha!&quot; laughed the genie ominously. &quot;But those four thousand years are long past. In my fifth millennium <br />
of captivity, if you had liberated me, I would have killed you swiftly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since I'm still alive, I guess you were in there longer than five thousand years?&quot; Jeff said uncertainly with <br />
a tinge of fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Verily, well over 5000 years!&quot; he snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, then I don't suppose you decided to go back to the limitless wishes option?&quot; he asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mwahahahahaahahahaahahaahahaahahahaahaha!&quot; the genie laughed darkly.  <br />
<br />
Black clouds blotted out the sky. Dream Jeff shivered on the beach as the air turned suddenly cold.  But at <br />
least for this brief time, he thought he was human rather than a condom floating in a jar filled with the <br />
fermenting cum of 200 men. Jeff was silent.<br />
<br />
At last the genie spoke again. He bent down to eye Jeff more closely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Foolish mortal, as if I would ever grant you unlimited wishes! Though you were close.  I vowed that if <br />
liberated in my six thousandth years of imprisonment that I would grant my freer one wish - the wish of how he <br />
would like to die!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish to die of old age!&quot; blurted out Jeff.<br />
<br />
The genie guffawed so hard he fell on his ass. Sand exploded behind him and the ground shook. Jeff lost his <br />
balance due to the shaking and fell to his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you should be so lucky!  After those 6000 years of perpetual darkness, I decided that whoever was foolish <br />
enough to liberate me would die 10,000 deaths.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff knelt there shivering. The genie was back on his feet, and his gap opening between his stretched leather <br />
pouch and his crotch was large enough for Jeff to stand in now. He was quiet and prayed the genie would forget <br />
about him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But seven thousand years came and went. No one liberated me.  I decided death would be too good for that man <br />
or woman. So I decided I would give my liberator a wish of eternal torment and servitude to me, if he should <br />
liberate me after 8000 years of captivity. But again, no one came to liberate me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff's mind was racing. Every time the genie spoke of his imprisonment, he promised a greater horror to Jeff.  <br />
Jeff had to stop him before he delivered Jeff his reward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, wait a minute! I don't believe a big guy like you was ever in that tiny little bottle!&quot; he shouted. &quot;You <br />
were hiding nearby and when I opened the bottle you jumped out from maybe behind that boulder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How dare you doubt my word!&quot; roared the giant.  Lightening cracked and arced in the sky above him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you really were in that bottle, you should be able to shrink down and go back inside to prove to me <br />
that it wasn't just a bottle of exploding cum! I dare you to get back in that bottle!&quot;<br />
<br />
This time the genie turned red as he glared down at Jeff. Then he burst into laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fool! Do you think I would fall for that same trick twice!  Even in 10,000 years, I should not be that <br />
forgetful or stupid as to allow myself to be trapped the same way! 8666 years ago, I was liberated from that <br />
bottle by a fisherman by the Red Sea. I told him what I told you, as I had been trapped for five thousand <br />
years before he liberated me. He too challenged me to get back in the bottle, but when I did, he sealed me <br />
back up and cast me into the sea. There I have been trapped in the darkness of the bottle ever since until <br />
this day when you freed me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you going to prove to me you can fit in the bottle or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess it's really more like a jar than a bottle.  It's got a pretty big mouth on it for a bottle. <br />
Still there's no way you could fit in it! Your cock probably couldn't even fit in it let alone your whole <br />
body!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tsk! But your taunt gives me an idea!&quot; the genie released the gold catch on his leather jockstrap-like <br />
loincloth, and the whole thing came crashing down three stories into the sand at the giant's fee. His giant <br />
member swung free and upward like a missile launching into the sky in slow motion. Jeff was covered in sand <br />
that had been thrown up by the crashing loincloth. He rubbed the sand from his eyes. When he looked up the <br />
genie's hand was closing around him. He screamed. The genie stuck his tree trunk like fingers into Jeff's <br />
mouth and stretched it wide. It amazingly stretched as if Jeff was made of rubber. He was made of rubber!  No!<br />
<br />
The giant stretched Jeff's tiny body over his huge cock as if Jeff was a condom. Good grief, he was a condom. <br />
He is a condom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now!&quot; roared the giant, &quot;I shall rape every man in the universe while wearing you. This shall be your eternal <br />
torment as there are new men born every day, and by the time I finish with the billions currently alive, they <br />
will be replaced by billions and billions more. Mwahahahahaha!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff awoke with the taste of the biker's eight loads fresh in his mouth. He was a condom.  He really was a <br />
used condom!  He was trapped in darkness, but if he ever became a man again, he would reek such vengeance on <br />
everyone they would never do that to him again. The irony of his thoughts relative to the dream were totally <br />
lost on Jeff in his irrational state.<br />
<br />
Finally, the door to the cupboard opened. The janitor started shuffling jars. Through the glass, Jeff could <br />
see that dates were written on the jars. The older dates were the jars he took. The janitor picked up Jeff's <br />
jar.  Jeff's heart soared.  At last he would be free from this cold dark captivity. His heart soared as he and <br />
the other jars of condoms were pushed in an old shopping cart out of the store room and into the janitor's <br />
backyard.  The janitor lived on rather big parcel near the train tracks on the outskirts of town. The shopping <br />
cart bounced and wobbled across the uneven ground of a weed patch that passed for the janitor's back lawn. The <br />
janitor was taking his cargo to a dilapidated sheet metal shed that was nearly completely hidden by overgrown <br />
bushes and a scraggly old tree. He undid the padlocked chain securing the door, and pulled the cart over the <br />
two by four threshold and into the shed. All the jars clanked noisily. Jeff was amazed that the jars hadn't <br />
shattered. Inside the dimly lit shed, Jeff could see what looked like a still made from old oil drums. A fire <br />
simmered whatever the janitor was brewing.  Probably, corn mash Jeff thought.  If he could have smelled the <br />
acrid air then, he would never have thought it was corn.  But he would soon be smelling it.  <br />
<br />
The janitor started opening and emptying the jars of condoms into a large plastic wash tub. He shook each jar <br />
to get every last drop of liquid out. Finally, Jeff's jar was opened and he too was dumped out into the <br />
growing heap of used rotting condoms. Two more jarfuls were dumped on top of Jeff. The acrid air made Jeff <br />
think that the house must be next to a dump that was burning tires.  Then the janitor opened the lid on the <br />
first drum.  It was nearly empty. A clear layer of liquid covered the melted rubber residue which coated the <br />
bottom and sides of the oil drum. The moonshiner emptied the washtub of condoms into the boiler. He closed the <br />
liquid leaving Jeff trapped in his new dark hot hell. A bit later, the janitor pulled back the lid he emptied <br />
another washtub of cum and condoms into the mash and added some buckets of water. Then he locked the lid into <br />
place.<br />
<br />
It dawned on Jeff that the lunatic was actually distilling fermented cum.  All these months or years, Jeff and <br />
his fellow condoms had been fermenting the cum inside and on them.  Now that fermented cum, and probably some <br />
of their latex was ending up in the fermented mix too. Jeff realized with horror that he would be melted and <br />
added to the growing amalgam of layers of rubber which now lined the oil drum bottom. The hardened rubber was <br />
probably inches thick after years of use.  He would be eternally mixed with the rubber of the other condoms, <br />
the Chronivac would never be able to restore him now!  He was doomed. He vaguely wondered if there was a <br />
market for recycled rubber- maybe he would end up as a condom again or maybe a handball?  It would be sort of <br />
like reincarnation.  Then he remembered the genie's promise: he was living eternal torment. Damn that <br />
Chronivac.  Damn its makers. Damn everyone. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt a gas bubble growing in him as the fermented cum inside him began to boil. He felt his mouth forced <br />
open for the first time in what felt like an eternity. Out rushed the gas adding another bubble to the <br />
janitor's process for producing his Potent Penis-Produced Potable.</p>
