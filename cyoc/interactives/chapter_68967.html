<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking at the medallion, which he had started to think of as Zulu's Necklace, he thought about how he didn't want to be female because he hadn't been born as a girl. But then he thought about how he had always felt that there was something in his life that was missing and how it felt that whatever that something was, it was somehow tied to the opposite sex and gender.<br />
<br />
Asking himself, &quot;Can you really do this?&quot; he decided, after a couple seconds of mental contemplation, that in the name of curiosity, science and a better understanding of the human race, that he could and collecting all of what he picked out, he touched the items to Zulo's Necklace and then to his exposed hand.<br />
<br />
For a full two minutes, Drake stood there, holding the clothes and the medallion, making sure that it all touched together and in turn came in contact with his hand. Squeezing his eyes shut when it became apparent that nothing was happening, he silently counted to sixty and opening his eyes, Drake noted that he had clearly not transformed, which he was actually glad of. Feeling like a fool, figuring that it was most likely either his imagination or, if the young woman had indeed changed into a boy, it had been something else, Drake placed Zulo's Necklace back round his neck and glared at the women's clothing.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;You are a sick pervert, Drake.&quot; he hastily began to put back the garments where he had gotten them.<br />
<br />
As he put The Perfect Bra back, he paused, noting that at some point somebody had opened the package and had taken the contents from within out. Wondering if it had been him, he muttered a curse and then quietly told himself, &quot;Get a grip. You're acting like some sort of weirdo,&quot; and dumping the box on a shelf, he turned and quickly made his way back to the men's section of the store.<br />
<br />
Collecting a couple new packages of socks and a couple pairs of pants in his size, Drake headed for the checkout and purchasing his items, he began to walk home, wondering what had happened to the woman-turned-kid and what it was that had caused her to transform.<br />
<br />
Home, he pulled the tags off the new pants and extracted the socks from the packages. Dropping his purchases into the laundry bin in front of the washer, he headed for the kitchen and began to make himself a bite to eat. Sitting down to eat in front of the computer, he booted up the machine and soon began to search various search engines for anything about Zulo, magick and people turning from one sex and gender to another. After a couple of hours of only fantasy stories, pictures and a lot of sites devoted to Transsexuals and Transgenders, Drake cleared his browser and shut the computer down.<br />
<br />
Taking his dishes to the kitchen, he began to wash them, thinking about what he was sure he had seen and anything that could logically define what it was that he witnessed. Heading back to the living room, he thought about trying to search again for information of Zulo's Necklace, but instead flopped down in front of the television and began to surf.<br />
<br />
When it became apparent that there was nothing on, he turned off the set and stared at the computer, mentally going over ways to revise his searches. Reaching for one of the books he kept neck to the recliner, he flipped to the page he had left off on and began to read, stopping only when his mother called, as she normally did, at nine. After talking to her for a bit, mostly to reassure her that he was fine, he thought about returning to his search, but instead placed the book he was reading on the stand next to his chair, stood and headed for his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Stripping down to nothing but his boxers, Drake pulled a tank-top out of his dresser and pulling it on, he took the amulet from around his neck and stared at, trying to glean some sort of secret from its graven image.<br />
<br />
Still unable to quite make out what the two images were, Drake eventually returned the medallion back around his neck, worried about choking and taking it off, dropped it onto his dresser. Clicking off the bedroom light, he lay down on his bed and stared at the ceiling, thinking, &quot;Can a man, or a woman, switch sex and gender without using surgery?&quot; but found himself drawing a blank and after a bit, he rolled over onto his side, suddenly feeling more comfortable lying on his side, and within moments, he was asleep.<br />
---<br />
<br />
A buzzing noise quickly drove away sleep and wondering why he set the alarm clock, knowing he didn't have any reason to get up early, Drake slapped off the clock and rolling over, he pulled up the covers and started to drift back to sleep.<br />
<br />
Immediately a familiar voice called out, &quot;You'd better not be going back to sleep,&quot; and opening his eyes, he looked in the direction and seeing his mother standing in his doorway, Drake blinked and asked, &quot;Mom?&quot; but was cut off from saying anything as she stated, &quot;I don't want to be late for work, so I cannot take you this morning. Now, get up!&quot; and turning, she disappeared into the hallway.<br />
<br />
Wondering why he was waking up to his alarm clock and his mother telling him he was going to be late for school, Drake glanced at the clock, noted it read six eleven, and climbing out of bed, he stumbled toward his dresser. Seeing the amulet, he asked himself, &quot;Is it something to do with Zulo's Necklace,&quot; and glancing down, as he opened the top drawer, he took in the fact that he was clearly still male and thinking, &quot;Maybe something went wrong,&quot; he began to take out of the dresser the clothes he was going to wear for the day.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, showered and dressed, Drake headed downstairs, everything around him he noted was the same as it had been when he had grown up. Taking a seat at the table, he failed to hear his mother saying, &quot;I'll be home late tonight Tess, so you'll just either have to find yourself dinner from the fridge or go over to one of your friend's house,&quot; as he reached for the box of cereal sitting on the table.<br />
<br />
Pouring himself a bowl of cereal, he missed his mother saying, &quot;Have a good day sweat heart,&quot; as his thoughts were elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Aware that she was talking to him, Drake mumbled, &quot;Yes mother,&quot; she kissed him on the top of his head and then told him, &quot;See you later,&quot; as he started to eat his bowl of cereal, still trying to wrap his mind around the fact that he was expected to go to school.<br />
<br />
After breakfast, he started to collect his shoes and backpack, which he found after a short search through the house, and was about to leave, but stopped and headed for the bathroom. Inside, he took a closer look in the mirror, but only found his normal, thirty six year old self staring back at him. Exiting the bathroom, thinking, &quot;What did you expect,&quot; he headed for his room and collecting Zulo's Necklace and placing it round his neck, he hurried to where he was supposed to catch the bus.</p>
