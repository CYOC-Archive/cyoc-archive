<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where have you been, bro?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
Ty explained to his brother what happened, and how was feeling since he had his new updated powers. Dustin was amazed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah! That&#39;s awesome!&quot; Dustin said. &quot;Your powers arrive just in time. Look there.&quot; he said and pointed to a place full of people.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on there?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are preparing a beach wrestling championship. If you get to the first place, you can get a cool trophy!&quot; Dustin said. Ty was curious and both walked there.<br />
<br />
When they arrived they saw a lot of muscular men waiting for being registered as participants. All of them were big and wide and were wearing tight wrestling clothes. Dustin couldn&#39;t do anything but smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah!&quot; he said amazed. &quot;I&#39;d like to participate here!&quot; he exclaimed. Then he felt how someone pushed him so hard that he fell on the sand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of here, little brats!&quot; the man laughed. &quot;This is only for strong men like me, you kids better stay at home with your mom!&quot; he said laughing.<br />
<br />
Ty looked at his big brother. &quot;Come on, bro, let&#39;s go...&quot; he said calmly as he took Dustin&#39;s hand. He guided his brother to a place where no one could see them. Ty was smiling because he knew what was going to wish his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty... Please... I wanted you to turn me into a wrestler before. But now I need more, I want a revenge!&quot; Dustin said very nervous. &quot;I want to defeat that man. Please... I wish... I wish... I wish I was the strongest wrestler in this beach!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish granted!&quot; Ty said happily. Dustin was very used to grow into a muscular boy. And sometimes, Ty had to turn him into an adult. In fact, he turned him into an adult that day because he needed to drive the car to the beach. When they arrived, he regressed back to his original age. But that time it was going to be very different. He wished to be muscular, but also an adult man.<br />
<br />
First, Dustin clothes disappeared leaving him naked. Then his body was overcome by a warm feeling. Dustin started to feel all his muscles growing. Starting by his legs, they began to widen as well as deepen. They got almost three times as thick as before. After that, they started to become longer too. He was growing! His calves grew bigger, they got at least three times bigger. His quads grew bigger and wider, as well as longer. He also got a thin coat of hair on his legs.<br />
<br />
He started to feel his cock growing longer and wider. Next was his torso. It started to widen too. All his upper body continued to grow in all directions. He got hard pecs and another layer of hair. Then, his arms began to grow too. He got the biggest biceps on the beach, they seemed bowling balls.<br />
<br />
Finally, his face started to change and become more and more adult. He got the &#39;cool&#39; beard he never had, while his cock was still growing.<br />
<br />
After some seconds, the changes stopped. Before Dustin could say something, Ty turned into a mirror in order to show his brother how he changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I can&#39;t believe it!&quot; Dustin started to talk but he stopped when he noticed his new adult voice. It was louder and had a lower pitch. &quot;Haha!! This feels so cool! I never had a body like this!&quot; he said. He started to do poses staring at the mirror, he made a fist and flexed his right arm, admiring the bulging bicep which popped up on his arm. He rubbed all his muscles... It felt great...<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah! Brother, you look very cool!&quot; said the mirror-boy. Suddenly, Ty returned to his human body. &quot;You can&#39;t go naked! Let me give you some clothes.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Then a black fabric appeared on Dustin&#39;s body. &quot;Hey, these wrestling clothes feel great!&quot; Dustin said. They were very very tight, but Dustin loved it. Then he noticed that wearing his clothes made appear a bulge on his crotch. It was like a large bubble. He gently touched it with his hands enjoying that feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then... I&#39;m ready! Thank you, Ty!&quot; Dustin said and hugged his brother who was now very small for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a moment bro...&quot; Ty said smiling. &quot;You are not the only one who is going to participate.&quot; And in quick flash, Ty became another adult. He wasn&#39;t wide as his brother, but he was still stronger than the other men at the beach. He created a blue wrestling suit for himself too. &quot;Finally I am as tall as you. You seemed a giant!&quot; Ty said with his new man voice. Both laughed.<br />
<br />
They reappeared together on the beach and went to register. Both started to train together until the championship started.<br />
<br />
Dustin and Ty reached to the semifinals easily. All their opponents were weak for them. They were definitively the strongest men on the beach.<br />
<br />
Ty won his semifinal match, so he was going to be in the final match. Now it was Dustin&#39;s turn. He was going to fight with the man who pushed him before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready... Fight!&quot; the referee said.<br />
<br />
Dustin could hear the crowd supporting him, he was the star of the championship. Ty used his telepathic powers and talked to him in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do it, bro! Humiliate him!&quot; he said. Dustin smiled.<br />
<br />
The man ran as fast as he could to Dustin. But Dustin took him by his legs and raised him. Then Dustin noticed he could lift that man with no problem! The man started to shout loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave me! Leave me! I accept my defeat but leave me, please!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Dustin wanted to enjoy a little more and after some seconds he threw the man to the sand making him the winner of the match.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin is the winner!&quot; the referee said. &quot;That means he is going to fight with Tyler on the final match! It will start in 30 minutes, so you have time for a breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty ran to his brother and hugged him. &quot;You have been awesome!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Dustin looked at the defeated man. He was leaving the beach lonely. Dustin and Ty followed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you!&quot; Dustin said. The man turned and saw Dustin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, don&#39;t hurt me!&quot; he said with tears in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you participate? This is only for strong men... Like us... You are only a little kid...&quot; Dustin said.<br />
<br />
Ty quickly understood and started to turn him into a kid. First he made disappear all his clothes leaving him naked. Then all his muscles and body started to regress to a 8 years old kid. After that, Ty made him a cute red wrestling suit for him. He was now a lovely wrestler kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said... You are a kid.&quot; Dustin said. The boy started to look at his new body, he wasn&#39;t sure how those giant men made that but he knew they were the responsibles of his transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will spend some hours as a little brat. That way maybe you will learn how to treat little kids. Enjoy it, muscle boy!&quot; Ty said and both returned to the beach laughing.<br />
<br />
After some minutes, the championship resumed. Ty and Dustin were on his positions smiling to each other. While the referee was doing the presentation they started to chat thanks to Ty&#39;s telepathic powers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t let you win, bro!&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll never win. Look at both. My body is wider, and I&#39;m stronger than you, you know it.&quot; Dustin said.<br />
&quot;Ready... Fight!&quot; the referee said.<br />
<br />
Ty ran to Dustin, took him and tried to make him fall. But he couldn&#39;t do it! Dustin was definitively stronger than him. He continued trying to hit him, but Dustin seemed to be made of steel, nobody could defeat him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Ty. You know it&#39;s impossible.&quot; Dustin said. Then he quickly pushed his brother carefully, and Ty fell on the sand. Dustin held him there some seconds. &quot;Sorry.&quot; he said smiling. Ty tried to get rid of him, but it was useless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin is the winner... He is the champion! Congratulations!&quot; the referee said excited as he raised Dustin&#39;s hand. Ty smiled. The crowd was applauding.<br />
<br />
After the trophy ceremony, Dustin and Ty returned to the car. The sun was starting to disappear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah! It has been a funny day! We must repeat something like this! It&#39;s very cool having these bodies, isn&#39;t it? Look, look at my biceps!&quot; Ty said excited and doing poses.<br />
<br />
Dustin seemed to be more serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... What happens Dustin?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... This body is so cool. I love wearing this tight suit and my manhood, but...&quot; he said.</p>
