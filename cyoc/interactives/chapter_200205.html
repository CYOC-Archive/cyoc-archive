<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Herself, Ky-Kyl, his D&D group, and now the cheer squad, that made thirteen goblin families. <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen wrote up a list on his phone titling it, &#39;&quot;Goblin Clan Interests&quot;, so she could keep track of anymore goblins added by reality retcons. She also check social media on the cheer leaders. <br />
<br />
There was Kim&#39;s younger brother, little brat had been called a genius when human, now he was list as just above average&#39; for a goblin. Kid hadn&#39;t even built his first atom smasher. His glasses had been replaced by googles. <br />
<br />
Tan-Tan&#39;s older sister had been an upcoming fashion model... she still was... but now her &#39;fashion&#39; was expensive jewelry that did nothing to hide anything humans would&#39;ve considered &#39;modest.&#39; She also now did quantum physics in her spare time. <br />
<br />
Ril-Ril&#39;s two older brothers were twins, and now two miniature mountains of muscle (by golem standards). College courses were childplay&#39;s to them (but they were to Jen too, she stayed in highschool just for the socialization). <br />
<br />
Sue-Sue&#39;s younger brother and sister if anything were more adorable as goblins, with their grinning faces full of shark&#39;s teeth. Her older brother and sister meanwhile, had been now developing cold fusion as a hobby. <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen Smith F and parents (3)<br />
Kyl-Kyl Perkins M and parents (3)<br />
Dav-Dav Schmidt M and parents (3)<br />
Gar-Gar M and big sister and parents (4)<br />
Jam-Jam M and older brother Bru-Bru and parents (4)<br />
Meg-Meg F and four little brothers, and parents (7)<br />
Ger-Ger F and little sister Sar-Sar and parents (4)<br />
<br />
Kim-Kim F younger brother and parents  (4) <br />
Ray-Ray F and parents (3)<br />
Tan-Tan F older sister and parents (4)<br />
Ril-Ril F and twin older brothers and parents (5)<br />
Sue-Sue F and young brother and sister, and older brother and sister, and parents (7)<br />
Sam-Sam F (goth witch, remember being human, speaks like humie) and parents (3)<br />
<br />
There hadn&#39;t been any goblins in existence this morning, and now there were already 58 of them! <br />
<br />
Ger-Ger&#39;s little sister, Sar-Sar, in this reality had gain a following of being the &#39;cute and clean&#39; goblin, and using her status to push for more nature preservation. Jen-Jen not see point, nature there to be exploited to the hilt. If Jen-Jen could turn whole planet into giant computer for gobbos to live on, she would. &quot;Hopeful Sar-Sar grow out of cleanliness and tree-hugging.&quot; <br />
<br />
If how fast they&#39;d created more goblins and changed the world in a day, Jen-Jen wonder how come others not do with curse... maybe they had. Jen thought Ruth Doe... the kitsune said not to fear her wrath, but her boredom. Maybe others had tried to &#39;end&#39; or &#39;finish&#39; the game, but had run afoul of her instead. There was also multiple online ads for the dragonness harem pleasure palace including several sexy looking kobolds. &#39;Kobolds reptiles, how heck kobolds have beasts? It curse, it not need to make sense, but if it not make sense, not universe implode since universe must make sense?&#39; <br />
<br />
While goblins were having a strong influence on Glendale economically, and Jen-Jen now had a long list of people wanting to have sex with her like she wanted as a goblin sextoy, goblin influence on cultural norms within Glendale might have been reaching their limit. Gobboing their grandparents was the only way for goblins have a deeper rooted grasp on what was considered &#39;civilized&#39; and &#39;natural&#39; in Glendale. <br />
<br />
Culture went the way the money went, the wealthy and powerful dictated to the media what to tell the people was normal and sane. But it still needed time to influence minds no matter how much propaganda you blared in their faces. If goblins wanted to go more degenerate and taboo, they&#39;d needed their grandparents gobbo&#39;ed retroactively. And Jen-Jen would have to look up who still had great-grandparents alive (out of thirteen families with teenagers, it was hardly impossible). If they could gobbo their still living GREAT-grandparents, not only would the technological progress the humies owed to gobbos sky rocket, possibly straight to the moon (or Mars, or Venus, who knew?), but goblins would have four generations of wealth and power to influence what the humanies saw as &#39;normal.&#39; <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen would have her fantasy of being publicly treated as a disposable sex object fulfilled in no time. She still knew that her state of being was due to Kyle&#39;s curse. But she couldn&#39;t care well what humie Jen would&#39;ve thought of of gobbo Jen-Jen. The fact she has humie Jen&#39;s memories was just useful information to spread gobbo influence in the direction she wanted. Besides, none of us decided our fetishes anyway. Who cares as long as she was (technically) not hurting anyone?<br />
<br />
&#39;Hmm. Might be faster to gobbo great-grandparents... but reality might go weirdo if gobboing reality that far back that fast.&#39; <br />
<br />
Glendale could go from a town to a CITY soon enough, possibly become the state capital! And that meant a larger population to make gobbos, or use as test subjects. <br />
<br />
Kim-Kim shouted, &quot;Jen-Jen check social media all day or practice gobbo?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Gobbo coming!&quot; <br />
<br />
While the goblins were all nudists, uniforms weren&#39;t technically clothes. So the gobbos puts on the cheer squad uniforms, but only the uniforms, not bothering with underwear or bras or anything else that wasn&#39;t explicitly part of the uniform. <br />
<br />
The cheer routines... weren&#39;t actually that different from before reality had been rewritten. They still did their acrobatics, they still repeated their cheers for the home team, but they also now included taunts for the visitor teams, including things like &#39;loser lizards&#39; and &#39;draco-dummies&#39; for some reason. <br />
<br />
It was... kinda refreshing really... Jen-Jen had been rewriting reality all day... it felt GOOD for there to still be a baseline she could grasp onto to keep herself sane. Sure, she was still gonna gobbo as many people as she possibly could, make gobbos masters of the world if she could... but it was about the small things after all. <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen realized she&#39;d have to make an app to keep track of which gobbos had the curse with them so Jen and Kyl could continue to &#39;borrowing&#39; it from the others. They needed to curse, er, gobbos their grandparents and great-grandparents still after all. <br />
<br />
Once practice was done, Jen could just go home, heck, she could any time, she wasn&#39;t learning anything she didn&#39;t already know at this place anyway. She still had another class... But she thought of Mrs. Johnson... And some odd struck Jen. <br />
<br />
&#39;She never look happy.&#39; <br />
<br />
As a selfish teenager, she never thought about it, now as a SMART selfish teenager, this might be an opportunity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kim-Kim, give Gobbo curse, gonna need it for experiment!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! What experiment?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It secret!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Squad no keep secrets.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a joke?&quot; Sam-Sam said. &quot;We keep secrets from each other all the time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not much in new universe,&quot; Jen said. &quot;But wanna keep it hidden till results are in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, Transform or Dare Jen-Jen,&quot; Kim-Kim said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare you to tell me what secret is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AGH! Me gonna curse Mrs. Johnson to transform somebody gobbo thinks is already cursed and maybe get willing servant out of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of the squad laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, why teacher? We no need favors to pass!&quot; Said Ray-Ray said. <br />
<br />
&quot;She most likely cursed gobbo know. Gobbo go now, gobbo not wanna search for humie after skool!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen did find Mrs. Johnson in her class, gathering papers to take home to grade. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Jen-Jen, anything I can help you with?&quot; She sputtered out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare Mrs. Johnson,&quot; Jen said at once. <br />
<br />
Mrs. Johnson paused... then blinked away tears Jen was sure were seaman too. <br />
<br />
&quot;T-transform!&quot; She looked like she wanted to say more but began choking when she tried.<br />
<br />
&quot;You become non-penis person nekomimi maid like in Kyl-Kyl&#39;s anime, shapely, no nipples, no belly button, and you be total asexual, you neither seek nor feel sexual pleasure and you&#39;re happy with that. OH! And reality change so none but you and me know different!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Mrs. Johnson&#39;s body became a mass of light, floating hands connected to the shaft, legs became more shapely, breasts move upwards, taking a fully human form before the pointed cat ears and tail formed. As the light faded, there was Mrs. Johnson, looking like an anime character come to life, with a large smooth chest with no visible nipples. <br />
<br />
Tears, real normal tears, didn&#39;t just stream down her face, they came down in a FLOOD. <br />
<br />
She fell to her hands and knees sobbing. &quot;THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Every day was torture, but I couldn&#39;t say anything to anyone, or ask anyone to use the curse to help me! And I couldn&#39;t even kill myself if the torture got to be too much! Stupid brat cursed me rather than use the curse to make himself smarter or make me give him a passing grade! After I rejected his mindless offer to seduce an asexual. THANK YOU JEN-JEN! I can never repay you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; Jen-Jen said. &quot;You be Jen-Jen&#39;s servant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mistress!&quot; She said without hesitation. &quot;I shall be a good maid!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You swear to do as Jen-Jen say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ANYTHING!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You swear not to use curse on Jen-Jen or other gobbos?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I SWEAR IT! Ask for my life, to set the world on fire, I don&#39;t care, you&#39;ve rescued me from my endless torture! I&#39;m yours!&quot;&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Cat-humie good servant. Gobbo figure need servant not addled with thinking &#39;bout sex all the time, just in case. Need test of loyalty. You got husband?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; ... Yes. But after my curse... he wasn&#39;t consciously aware anything had changed... But I knew he was uncomfortable around what I&#39;d been turned into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cat-humie say asexual already, but cat-humie have husband?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Romantic love is more than sexual attraction mistress.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You prove loyalty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mistress!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen was going to order Mrs. Johnson to turn her husband into an identical cat girl maid to her, to think alike, look alike, be alike, to be her identical twin. Two perfect identical twin servants. <br />
<br />
But seeing the anime catgirl sobbing before her in gratitude... Jen wonder if Jen have brain tumor or something, why she now hesitate to give order? Her being an asexual BEFORE her curse wasn&#39;t something Jen had counted on. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Cat-humie come with gobbo, use curse on maid Martha, curse into exact copy of cat-humie, think same, feel same, act same, be same, except name. Be twin-sister for rest of world &#39;cept you and Jen-Jen.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As my Mistress commands, it shall be done.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen hadn&#39;t been to her home since that morning, when she was the only goblin and actually found a note left from herself of THAT reality. Of course that Ken wouldn&#39;t have even retroactively existed now that there were 58 goblins in the world. <br />
<br />
At least the Draconian Harem Pleasure Palace had always acted as a great landmark in Glendale, seen from almost anywhere within the town borders. <br />
<br />
The estate was even bigger than before, lewd works of art depicting goblins in various poses were everywhere. And kobolds in humiliating violent deaths were included for some reason. <br />
<br />
Including fountain head showing a little girl gobbo Jen-Jen smashing the head in of a kobold in with the cutest look on the statue Jen-Jen&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
The style of the estate and house hold itself was a twisted mishmash of the lewd, the high-tech, and the tribal. <br />
<br />
Engraving and symbols of each of the thirteen goblin families hung on the wall of the entrance hall, looking wooden and hand painted. There was also a holograph map guide right next to the front door, and EVERYTHING was connected wirelessly. There were also &#39;free to borrow&#39; vibrators hanging on the wall like keychains. <br />
<br />
And the smell of grass clippings and damp moss was -everywhere!- The front lawn had patches of extra strong grass, no doubt from goblins taking casual dumps on their own front lawn. <br />
<br />
Mrs. Johnson didn&#39;t react to the smell at all. She stayed behind the goblin who was her student but was also now her savior she&#39;d sworn her undying loyalty to. <br />
<br />
Jen-Jen effortlessly familiarized herself with the house database, found Martha&#39;s phone number and dialed it up. She gave it to Mrs. Johnson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cat-humie know what to do.&quot; Jen-Jen said.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Johnson nodded. The phone rang until, &quot;Hello?&quot; Asked a woman&#39;s voice that Jen recognized instantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha Jones?&quot; Asked Mrs. Johnson. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s me, what is it? This is my day off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wha-what!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You heard me, you had sixty seconds to decide or you get both, but that was ten seconds ago. And I&#39;d advice against choosing dare, I promise, your transformation will be far kinder. You know what kind of people are out there and what they use the curse for. Your life as you knew it is over. But you&#39;re that eager to find out-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-Transform, oh God.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will become my identical twin sister, we shall look alike, think alike, feel alike, act alike, be alike. We will support each other. None but me and my mistress will remember reality was any different.&quot; <br />
<br />
Reality blurred. There was now an identical living anime catgirl staring face to face with Mrs. Johnson. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Pearl! I know today is my day off, but I wanted to see if you or mistress needed anything!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing Martha, but than you for coming,&quot; Pearl smiled and nodded. She belonged to mistress now, of her own will, but at least she got a mirrored sister out of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who do you two serve?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We serve you mistress, for now and forever,&quot; the two echoed and bowed with the same mannerism and voice. They were used to mistress reaffirming their loyalty. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl meanwhile, had finished his philosophy class, a class that had little to do with inventing doomsday or mind control devices in your spare time, which was why he had signed up for it in this timeline. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d gotten the curse back from Ger-Ger... in exchange for him happily calling her mistress and enjoying her whipping and beating him for a solid hour. But goblins were made of harder stuff than humies. <br />
<br />
The Oasis Palace had stood for decades as a retirement home for the elderly in Glendale. Now that he was involved in the curse, Kyl honestly wondered how many there had been aged into senior citizens thanks to someone&#39;s spiteful use of the curse, or how many had been saved from it. <br />
<br />
Kyle the human was ashamed to admit, he hadn&#39;t visited his grandparents in years. Not since his grandparents had gotten too old to take care of themselves, and they&#39;d sold their home. <br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl the goblin was surprised to learn his grandparents were STILL in the retirement home... instead of living like royalty with their now much more successful family. <br />
<br />
And Kyl-Kyl realized something else too... the place was exactly the same. All the retroactive advances in technology and affordability hadn&#39;t done diddly squat. <br />
<br />
The computers were outdated even by humie standards, the air-conditioning needed replacement, garden was overgrown with weeds... TV was black and white and fuzzy and didn&#39;t have cable. Kyl-Kyl thought food looked alright, but knew humies not have same tolerances as gobbos. <br />
<br />
Worst part though was caretakers. They not even look at Kyl when he come in. Some gossiping among themselves. Others busy on their phones. Kyl see one lady who walk right passed old man who&#39;d wet the bed. <br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl had thought he was passed caring about these humies. Gobbos were going to be in charge, and humies would be the lab rats and love it. <br />
<br />
Kyl went to the nurse at the front desk who was more interested in her &#39;pay for a another turn&#39; puzzle game on her phone. He whispered right in her ear. &quot;Transform or dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t even notice him as she continued to play, the j-pop music blaring from the phone. <br />
<br />
A minute later he said, &quot;You get both. Transform into a perfect obedient, helpful, nurturing, and loving caretaker golem, you exist to look after the elderly. Any caretaker here whose treated the residents here with less respect than due someone&#39;s pet, you&#39;ll touch and they&#39;ll transform same as you with the same effect. No one will think anything is wrong with this or be alarmed in anyway, any of you with dependents will nurture them too. For your dare, you&#39;ll transform or dare me to use transform or dare on my grandparents and turn them retroactively into goblins.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood up, dropping her phone and said, &quot;Transform or dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare your grandparents into goblins.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl marched straight to his grandparents room. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile the nurse changed. Her body became gray class, her clothes vanished, the Jewish word for &#39;Truth&#39; was engraved somewhere on her body. She was like a doll, no nipples, no belly button, a completely smooth crotch and the like. She marched straight to another of the caretakers who made no reaction to the sight of her. Even the nurse she was playing cards with did nothing as her partner became a clay nursing golem. <br />
<br />
Soon the Oasis Palace was FILLED with golems genuinely caring for their charges. <br />
<br />
Kyl found his grandparents sleep. He looked at their medication, his superior goblin brain knowing they were the kinds most known for making the residents drowsy. <br />
<br />
He shook them both awake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, Kei-Kei, you came to visit,&quot; said her grandmother. <br />
<br />
&quot;No Gram-gram, gobbo not papa, gobbo Kyl-Kyl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course dear,&quot; his grandmother said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare. Please chose transform. Gobbo helping you escape from here.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two were so out of it they did as they were told and said mostly together, &quot;Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Becoming gobbos like gobbo and Jen-Jen and all the rest, reality change so you always be gobbos, only Kyl-Kyl and Jen-Jen remember old world.&quot; <br />
<br />
Reality blurred. So many changes at once. His grandparents clothes vanished, their clothes vanished and their bodies shrank as they became faded shades of green. <br />
<br />
By the time reality came back into focus, Kyl-Kyl found his grandparents wide awake, residing in a pair of hover chairs with built-in vibrators. The room had multiple holograph screens showing the stock market and progress of several research projects. Along with their favorite black and white shows from when they were kids.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice for you to visit Kyl-Kyl,&quot; said his grandfather, folding his legs over his giant member that hung down from the hover chair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gobbo still live here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This were friends are, gobbo understand when gobbo older,&quot; said his grandmother, her giant breasts hanging over her knees. <br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl open his phone. His eyes bulged. Papa had been an only child... now he had two sisters, who had given birth to human-goblin hybrids. In fact... he realize he now had a brother away at boarding school overseas! <br />
<br />
The truth hit Kyl-Kyl.<br />
<br />
&#39;Gobbos love sex, what natural end result of sex?&#39;  <br />
<br />
In fact... he realized there were now several goblins who were listed as &#39;adopted&#39; by the Clan Interest itself who were all in grade school. He did some quick online digging. <br />
<br />
And ten years ago his grandmother had released the first of the Nurse-Maid-Droids, robots in the shape of lady goblins who could take &quot;unwanted&quot; pregnancies from a mother and bear them to term, with the condition they&#39;d be slowly mutated into a goblin before birth. It had been seen as the ultimate golden solution by society and ending decades of brutal and bloody debate. The goblins had more than enough resources to take them in, after all, more goblins meant more goblin brains to invent new renovations to improve society even more. <br />
<br />
&#39;If this happen from gobbos grandparent being gobboed, what &#39;bout other gobbo grandparents?&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;Gram-Gram, Gramp-Gramp, gobbo gotta go, something big just come up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just use curse to turn us into gobbos didn&#39;t you?&quot; Asked his father.<br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl&#39;s jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;It obvious from distortion in space time continuum,&quot; his grandmother said showing him a holograph screen of some graphs with equations that even above his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make more gobbos! More gobbos! More brains to think!&quot; His grandpa clapped. <br />
<br />
Kyl-Kyl nodded, &quot;Yes Gramp-gramp!&quot; Kyl hurried out of the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, another distortion in time-space happen in room next to ours just now,&quot; said his grandmother looking at her screens.<br />
<br />
Kyl&#39;s eyes widened and he ran into the next room. He saw a baby dragon with pastel blue scales  laughing and running in circles. There was a old folks gown that Kyl just had time to see vanish into nothing, then wonder what he just saw, but remembered but gram-gram say about changes in reality. <br />
<br />
A nurse golem gently picked up the baby dragon and let him ride on her shoulders. The two went out to the garden and Kyle noticed what was also here... a kobold... scaley and orange, as naked as Kyl-Kyl, but lacking anything visible on the outside, then again, they were reptiles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! You just use curse to make old-folk baby dragon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, no?&quot; The Kobold said.<br />
<br />
Kyl just glaring. <br />
<br />
The Kobold sulked. &quot;Okay, yes, I do. Technically, me here to trigger cascade curse, old folks residents with no children here to become baby dragons. Get to live life longer and better.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. But Kyl-Kyl gobbo grandparents of gobbos.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine by me. Kobold&#39;s honor, and dragon&#39;s honor for good measure. We both upgrade boring humies! ... name Jak-Jak by the way.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyl-Kyl, nice to meet you.&quot;</p>
