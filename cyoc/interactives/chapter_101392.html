<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy let a very sympathetic smile cover her white furred muzzle as she stood in front of Tad in her full werewolf form. He was a remarkably attractive male and with the large member growing erect member growing out of his sheath between his legs, she felt he was well worth the effort. A part of her fantasized about being with him and raising pups with him, in a sense to have her life mirror her mother&#39;s. Her parents had met in high school, got married in college, and had her nine months after college graduation. And while her younger brothers might tease her from time to time, she had enjoyed having them as younger brothers, as they completed a happy family, and that was very much what Amy Howler wanted in life.<br />
<br />
&quot;See something you like, big boy?&quot; Amy teased to him playfully as she ran her paw-like hands along her generous white furred curves with her nipples poking through the white fur on her breasts. Her cup size might not be as big as a werefox&#39;s, but a werefox would never be as strong as she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you... you...&quot; Tad managed nervously, barely noticing the massive erection between his legs.<br />
<br />
Amy slowly shook her head and approached him. Tad nervously backed up until he backed into the trunk of a tree. Once she had him pinned against the tree, she carefully moved up and gently gripped Tad&#39;s hips and held them together, though she didn&#39;t begin any sexual adventure yet. The black furred male was still a virgin, that much Amy was sure of. It made some sense if Tad had never met other weres while moving with his family from post to post. All weres had a higher libido than normal humans, but they weren&#39;t lost to their libidos and even in Moon Lake they were educated to try and be careful to avoid &quot;revealing&quot; themselves to normals. A were that had been outside Moon Lake probably had to be even more concerned with those sorts of things, as technology was growing better and in many places... people lived close enough together that Tad&#39;s parents probably would have alerted their neighbors with howls and &quot;meows&quot; if they were as sexually active as many of the weres in Moon Lake were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, me,&quot; Amy smiled, &quot;Did your dad ever tell you about the things werewolf packs do from time to time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About being rather... active,&quot; Tad said nervously, &quot;Yes... but he also always said to be careful and not to let myself think with my...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s eyes watched Tad&#39;s look downward. She then looked down between the valley of cleavage formed by her breasts to see Tad&#39;s erect member with its canine knot at its base.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes, I&#39;m sure he told you that,&quot; Amy smiled and licked Tad&#39;s nose at the end of his muzzle, &quot;but that was because you were outside Moon Lake and had to make sure you didn&#39;t expose weres to humanity. That makes sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re IN Moon Lake, now,&quot; Amy said carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Tad answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means you don&#39;t have to hide quite as much,&quot; Amy stated, &quot;and you&#39;re with an attractive female werewolf... you do find me attractive, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very,&quot; Tad said nervous.<br />
<br />
Amy licked his nose again and smile, &quot;so... why so nervous? I know we&#39;ve pretty much only just met... but you&#39;re a nice guy... if a bit clumsy and unused to Moon Lake... strong and handsome... and from some things we&#39;ve talked about today... quite good with knowing right and wrong and very well disciplined. I find that rather attractive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do?&quot; Tad asked, and tried to wag his tail, but the tree he was backed up against wouldn&#39;t allow that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Amy smiled, &quot;and in that... I&#39;m looking for my future Mr. Right... who will be with me, father pups with me, have fun with me, be a good father,  and pretty much be what every girl wants. And you seem to fit that role pretty well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I may not be any good,&quot; Tad said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... so THAT&#39;S his concern,&quot; Amy thought to herself. That made some sense. Most young weres, who had been born weres, generally lost their virginity shortly after their first transformation as a were&#39;s heightened libido kicked in with them and Moon Lake&#39;s were society was far more open in that regard. Tad was coming to Moon Lake and was meeting all of that for the first time. Amy had long made her decision to support Tad and help him get used to his new home. This would be no exception.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Amy smiled and pulled Tad away from the tree and into a tight hug, &quot;I&#39;m here and I&#39;ll do all I could help you. I&#39;m sure that you at least know the basics with regard to what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy then leaned forward and managed to kiss him, not easy to do with a wolven muzzle, but she managed. Tad actually smiled in response to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;With time and practice,&quot; Amy said with a smile, &quot;by the time we graduate college and get married... you&#39;ll be a master.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a minor miracle Tad didn&#39;t faint from the suggested prospect of ultimately marrying Amy, but it did serve Amy&#39;s purposes as it did spur him to action, and he felt his paws reach to her breasts. Tentative at first, as he he was trying to see what they felt like, but Amy did give a confident smile as Tad began to clumsily massage them. It wasn&#39;t great, but it wasn&#39;t necessarily horrible, and made sense since she was likely Tad&#39;s first. Amy managed to keep them close so that Tad couldn&#39;t just push himself into her, for while Amy could feel just how big he truly was through her fur, and that alone was making her wet, she still needed to be sure she was ready for such a large member. The two were also soon eagerly licking at each other&#39;s muzzles, even as a chorus of howls rose from the woods around them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re behind all of them,&quot; Tad said slowly as they paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let them rush,&quot; Amy answered him as she lay down in front of him, her legs spread wide to invite Tad to her. She also softly rubbed her vulva for a moment, if only to try and entice Tad further. &quot;They aren&#39;t doing this for true love like we are...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad smiled at the idea that it was true love for him and Amy and got down and came up to the white furred she-wolf on all fours. He carefully licked at Amy&#39;s vagina and gave her a few loving licks along her belly, up to her breasts, and then up to her muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t this be a bit early to assume it&#39;s true love?&quot; Tad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least dating,&quot; Amy smiled and licked Tad&#39;s muzzle, &quot;just be gentle...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Amy soon felt Tad begin to push his huge erection into. Thanks to her efforts earlier, she managed to make sure that she was ready for him. She could feel Tad begin the shudder with pleasure as he thrust into her. She then thrust against him to keep going, leading to both of them giving very pleasure filled barks and growls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome... to... Moon... Lake... Tad,&quot; Amy spoke slowly as she thrust her hips to counter Tad&#39;s thrusts into and feeling the pleasure build within her.</p>
