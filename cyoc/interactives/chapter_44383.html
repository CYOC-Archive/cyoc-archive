<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I get dressed I surprised the hell out of Drew, saying what he least expected, “Do I have to go?” Shocked, Drew opened the cell door, motioning me to follow him. Thinking to close the cell door as I go through, I straighten my hurriedly put on hoodie and stood beside him as he get in his chair, grinning.<br />
<br />
	Drew grinned back at me, putting the cell keys back in its proper place as he stood up, pausing before stroking my arm and headed down the one step to the doors. &quot;Shi-... grab the drugs, we have to take care of them ourselves&quot; Wondering exactly what 'take care of them ourselves' meant, I grab the drugs anyway and catch up to Drew, following at his side almost like an eager puppy. Drew put his arm around my waist, having a significant size advantage over me. We both could easily walk down the sidewalk and still cling to each other. It was still dark out but the next cop was probably on his way now. So Drew helped me get in the car, quickly closing the door and getting in the driver’s seat and heading off. Looking over at me occasionally, he could see me taking quick, deep breaths with a smile on my face. I was obviously excited, my demeanor was so different from when I was in the back. I was still quiet and I didn't know what was going to happen to me, just like before, but this time, I was eager to find out.<br />
<br />
	I noticed that I was in a different part of the town, I wasn’t going to MY home at all. Drew was bringing me to HIS home. He put his hand on my thigh to ease our nerves as we pulled into a driveway. &quot;You can stay here as long as you like&quot; Drew informed me. My face lit up, not even missing my shoddy home at all. &quot;Really?&quot; I say, putting my hand on his, showing my enthusiasm… and affection for him. &quot;Yes,&quot; he smiled sitting in the car, unbuckled now, more excited than I could see on his face as he turned to me &quot;If you want to move out of your old place... I would like for you to stay here…&quot; Drew was unsure if he was digging himself into a hole. But I needed help and Drew thought he could help, so he decided that he would. <br />
<br />
	My grin widening was all the answer Drew needed, but I unbuckled myself, and remembering how much I loved it before, leaned over to this big cop, who found his lips locked with mine. I pushed him against the door with my arms locked behind his head, he slid my body between himself and the steering wheel. It was more of a empty space around this neighborhood, so if I accidentally hit the horn, it would be okay. We began to make out slowly as he eased me down, my tightly stretched pants hit a tented boner right below my ass. Drew eased up on me so that I didn’t have to bend in a painful way. Between moans and grunts, and an occasional beep of the car horn, our make out session was getting hot and heavy.<br />
<br />
	Even though I hated the idea of getting fucked again, I started to rub that nice tent of his against my ass. I hoped, as Drew played with my lip, gently grabbing it with his teeth, that he knew that I definitely had no problem with moving in. He thought that, in this situation, he had no problem with me staying with him. Him being my provider, for as long as I stayed out of the wrong side of the law. He had no problem... right now however, he wanted me on all sides of the law, particularly, himself.... He was tempted to unzip his fly and test the strength of my pants’ fabric. The drugs along with the rest of his uniform were in the back seat, which really needed to be cleaned now. But he had extras to wear to work anyways. Drew had one more day of work and then his first vacation in 5 years was coming up. This also may have prompted him to be so impulsive. I stopped for a moment, my hands resting on his big shoulders as I just smiled at him and grinned. I realized that I was wrong before; this was the best thing to ever happen to me in my life. I didn’t talk much, but neither did Drew. He figured it was because of the whole arrest thing... He guessed I would warm up to him the longer we were together. &quot;Alright, Kid, The car is beginning to stink like my B.O.&quot; Drew unlatched the door letting me out first. <br />
<br />
	I crawled over him, but slowly, &quot;Yeah, well think I like your B.O.&quot; I grin, taking a step back once I was out, to give Drew room to get out. I started having thoughts of maybe one day being his partner, so that maybe I'd be able to spend more time with him. He sluggishly got out of the car with a visible boner and stretched. &quot;Ahh, you’re a raunchy little guy, huh?&quot; He joked scratching his chest and then his balls. Drew shut the door and opening the back, grabbed his things as well as my... his... THE drugs. &quot;Well...&quot; I smiled at you, &quot;When a sexy cop...&quot; I bite my lips a bit, but I was still smiling. I was pretty sure he got the message anyways. Drew grinned, grabbing my ass, making sure a finger found its way to the crease of my cheeks while he literally guided me to the front door with his hand on my ass. He was acting like a sex starved teenager, he felt like a sex starved teenager.<br />
<br />
	Drew fumbled with his keys, unlocking the door, &quot;There are three bedrooms. You can have any of the three.&quot; He wasn’t sure if I wanted to sleep in his room or not, yet. &quot;One and a half bathrooms and you can see the rest for yourself.&quot; it was a one story home with a basement, pretty spacious with a open floor plan, the half bath for guests and a private one attached to the master, Drew’s, bedroom and the first guest room. As soon as Drew said that there were three bedrooms and I could sleep in any one of them, I instantly wanted to know which one he wanted to be. I knew I was, until recently, a virgin. So I wanted to stay around the guy that had taken it. Especially since I was liking him more and more. But then I got embarrassed, I didn't even know his name. All I ever called him was 'sir.'<br />
<br />
	It never occurred to Drew to tell me his name, his partner had never said it either, but Drew still thought that I knew his name. After all, Drew knew mine. Once again, it never occurred to him and probably wouldn’t. &quot;Well… go in,&quot; he laughed, &quot;Pick your room.&quot; He stepped inside the door way closing and locking the front door, turning on the light. He knew that he would probably have to buy me new clothes, since these were probably the only ones I had. Even though he knew I was equal to him as a man, he still saw me as a down-on-your luck type of guy. &quot;Um... which is your room... sir?&quot; I ask, almost asking two questions at once. It would be extremely embarrassing if I was to ask my new lover what his name was. He grinned, &quot;You don’t have to call me ‘Sir,’ unless it gets you off. Drew is just fine.&quot; Drew threw his coat on a chair &quot;Down the hall and the second door to the right is my room.&quot; He smiled proud of my choice.<br />
<br />
	Unable to resist a yawn, I followed him still. I remembered just how late.. well, early it was. Looking at Drew, I figured, that if I had a type, then he would fit it perfectly. I looked away from him to down the hallway, looking for the right door. 'Almost 3... he must be tired too...' I hoped. And with a glance at Drew, seeing him smile, I nod and go straight to the master bedroom. Drew did look weary, tired from his long, yet exciting day/night. &quot;Gonna jump in the shower, I'll be in a little bit.&quot; He says, heading into the bedroom and then through the connecting door to the bathroom with a nice large mirror that spanned across the counter, wall to wall. Since he worked so hard on his body during his free time, he liked to look at it as well. He shut the door slightly. Normally, he wouldn’t have bothered shutting it at all. As he stripped off his damp t-shirt and uniform pants. He threw them into the hamper and turned on the shower. I wasn't sure what to do, looking at the bed and Drew’s slightly ajar bathroom door. 'Does he want me to peek?' I asked myself, 'Does he want me to strip and wait for him on the bed?' Either way, I decided, I was going to strip down to my boxers.</p>
