<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As it happened Stacey and the group she was a part of we’re greeted by this rouge but wise looking Centaur male, mid 40s by Stacey’s own reckoning but carrying the features of wild shoulder length black hair and matching uncombed beard and as expected towering slightly over the humans he was to guide “you must be those that passed the most recent of the interviews. This way if you would” the Centaur kindly instructed, his voice showing his wisdom yet masking his strength. Stacey like all of her group merely silently followed him along this quite path from the landing zone and through some of the woodlands to what one could surmise was the only modern-style building upon the entire Island were everyone was usurer inside.<br />
<br />
Before long everyone from the plane had been seated while this Raven-haired teenage Centauride wearing a white labcoat came around asking and taking samples before leaving, doing so unusually professionally for her age while retaining something of an innocent spark. After that all anyone could do was pass the time while reading these provided books of various subjects from comedy to foreign literature for nearly 3 hours before the teenager returned “Alright then folks, from here on out I’ll be calling names and if called out your to head through the hallway to the marked ‘Director’s’ office behind me” she started “once done I will return to announce it with the flight staff and those who I didn’t call are to head on ahead with them ready for tomorrow afternoon, food and drink provided, until cleared for takeoff”. This got Stacey worried that she might have been mixed up with a different group until the calling out started. “Stacey Davis” the teenager called out first. “Right here” Stacey answered in relief. “Through you go then... just be sure you keep things within an hour” the teenager requested as Stacey headed on through the hallway.<br />
<br />
After going through the Hallway and quickly finding the Director’s Office Stacy entered to find the guide centaur now wearing a Labcoat of his own alongside this Red-headed female about the same age as him that in some aspects could otherwise pass as the teenager when she reached her late 30s to early 40s. “So you’re Stacey Davis. One of the perspectives for the Island school... Secondary Division based on your CV” the Centauride welcomed. “By skills with Maths and if needed History and Geography” the Centaur followed. “I admit in some ways my CV looks somewhat...lacklustre but I assure you-” Stacey started in dread. “What Lakapius means is if you succeed here you by employment as it were are expected to help assure the students know their Numbers and Algebra as your top target. Just if needed you can cover for the other school staff in case of events transpiring today us failing to meeting all criteria” the Centaur Lakapius calmly interrupted.<br />
<br />
“Lakapius... Lakapius Mox, formerly Donald Lawson... the Ma- Centaur responsible along his wife in setting this place up?” Stacy then questioned over the name. “See our reputation has grown vast hon” the Centauride noted with a chuckle “Argiala Mox, formerly Amanda Lawson. Bet you didn’t expect your final interview in our process to be with us did you Miss Davis?”. “Honestly not with you both... and certainly not Lakapius himself leading us” Stacey admitted. “So from the videos you were shown what are your thoughts on Centaurs and Centaurides in general?” Argiala then asked. “Well... good looking, strong... fast of course... Heck in some ways I wouldn’t mind being one myself... they are overall breath taking in whatever way your orientation is pointing” Stacey listed before quickly covering her mouth. “Relax Miss Davis. Orientation of all kinds is accepted here, Heterosexual, Homosexual, Bisexual... we are quite far into the 21th century here” Lakapius assured. “Oh...well you see... I’m, well maybe... I see myself as Bi” Stacey confessed. “Anyhow from your answer to the video based question we can easily guess your coming answer” Argiala then noted “Are you willing to undergo the process to become a Centauride?”.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t it... very costly?” Stacey pondered. “By this stage combined with our investments off Island not at all and in practice as a possible resident a requirement for the job. True some of your fellow interviewees outside already can’t go this far as their DNA limits their converting capability, reasons for our Daughter Eunosa’s asking for samples when you entered” Lakapius explained. “I...see” Stacey accepted. “If you agree to this you just need to fill in these final papers confirming you did this of your own accord and if you desire, to like us change your name to fit in as a Centauride” Argiala then said while handing Stacey the 2 sheets of paper required. Without a second thought Stacey signed up as willing to be a Centauride while asking to from now on be known as Semope Davis. “Is it alright I just change my given name?” Stacey asked. “No problem... actually honestly we’re the only ones to have changed our family name. All others even with given changed kept the family” Lakapius confessed.<br />
<br />
Sometime later Stacey or Semope as she decided to be in advance was placed within this wired room alongside two other female from the flight and all had been stripped naked. “Your that Stacey girl right? First one asked through?” this bob-cut blond-haired woman in her mid-20s asked Semope. “Semope now... I chose to change my name” Semope answered. “Same... I’m Kallatea” this early-20s Redhead in a pixie cut followed. “Lisa... I chose to retain my name” the blond stated. “Ladies ready?” Argiala called through a com system to the now sealed room. “Just tell us what we do from here” Semope answered. “Don’t reject the mist. Let it pass through your systems” Argiala answered...<br />
<br />
...suddenly a wired green mist started filling the room that at first Semope and the others tried to avoid breathing but then recalled Argiala’s words and allowed themselves to breath in this mist...<br />
<br />
...the outcome after awhile then brought all three women to the ground in pain all below their waists. Turning around to check Semope was gob-struck as she noticed her butt pushing outwards as her muscle mass started expanding, further and further while her feet were pulled into her legs. A second set of legs started to appear from her finishing expanding butt with hooves forming on both sets. Then light brown horse hair started rapidly growing all under her waist while a tail matching her hair colour sprouted from her rear. Even her upper body underwent a few changes as her breasts expanded from B to C cups while her waist and arms reformed into a more athletic build. Also Semope noticed that Lisa and Kallatea had undergone the same process with all three of them now being Centaurides. The finished results being more clear as the fog faded:</p>
