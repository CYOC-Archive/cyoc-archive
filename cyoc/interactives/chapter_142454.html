<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John was a bit of an average guy given an unaverage blessing with this vacation. 5&#39;8&#39;&#39;, shaggy brown hair, probably had a few too many snacks but still would look a bit scrawny with his clothes on. Regardless it was a long ride to the resort and he felt being in the Sauna for a bit and then rinsing off the sweat in a shower would be nice. In the changing room he got naked and wrapped his modesty before entering the steamy room of sweat. Entering the room he saw what must&#39;ve been a half dozen or so other guys including Mark. John found himself a spot and decided to sweat and chat with the other guys. <br />
<br />
As the guys sweated Tyler, a bit of a prankster noticed that there was some sort of setting box hidden on the side. There was settings for coal heat and other Sauna settings, and then TF settings? Currently they all were off, but there were settings for aging up or down, height, different types of animals, gender? Tyler thought that messing with this would be funny, but seeing a bunch of naked girls running out of the Sauna would be both funny and give everyone else some nice sexy memories. Now there was his question. Did he want to have a pair of tits himself? <br />
<br />
John noticing some plastic nozzles here and there picked up one next to him and saw a trigger and gave it a squeeze and some steam came out of it. He asked &quot;Hey what do you guys think we have these things?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark guessed &quot;Maybe if someone wants more steam they can just spray themselves with it?&quot; <br />
<br />
John said &quot;Seems kind of odd though, it feels more like a gun with a long reach spray see?&quot; He sprayed Mark who was sitting on the opposite side of the room with a decent amount of mist. <br />
<br />
Mark shrugged and said &quot;Who knows maybe it had TF functions in other wings? Regardless maybe after we get out of the resort I could help you with a gym membership. Looks like your getting some man boobs.&quot; <br />
<br />
John looked down and his chest did look a little bulkier than usual and said &quot;I don&#39;t remember them being this big...&quot; he muttered &quot;have I started eating too much?&quot; Then looking at the other guys chests they seemed to be a bit bulky as well. Another guy came in, John thought his name was...<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyler!&quot; Mark said &quot;Welcome to the Sauna. Come in and join our chat!&quot; The trickster took a seat next to John who started feeling a bit more weird and self conscious. He was a bit too preoccupied with his swollen chest and wasn&#39;t noticing his body hair start turning to sweat and vaporize into the mist. Then their manhoods started to slowly turn to sweat and vaporize away with Tyler having retained more of his manhood from him getting in earlier. <br />
<br />
One of the guys commented &quot;Hey Drew, didn&#39;t you forget to shave today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another guy presumably Drew said &quot;Yeah, woke up late and didn&#39;t get a chance.&quot; as he stroked his face only to feel smooth skin. Then he started rubbing more as he started to get what the other guy had been getting at. His facial hair had vanished. John put his hands down in his lap as he thought about why some guy&#39;s facial hair would vanish, and then noted something felt weird between his legs. Or more accurately a lack of something.  He peaked under his towel and saw a toothpick of a penis melt away into the mist. Now that he thought of it it wasn&#39;t just his breasts that were swollen, but his nipples were also a bit engorged as well oddly. John took a deep breathe in and let out a short girly shriek as his vocal chords got coated in a lot more steam. Everyone else inside looked towards John&#39;s shriek and noted his voice being a bit higher pitch than normal, and his man boobs were looking a bit more plump for man boobs. Tyler was just happy that he was a decent actor and had a pretty good surprised look on his face.<br />
<br />
John said &quot;My dick&#39;s gone! What the fuck is happening?!?&quot; in her new voice. <br />
<br />
The other guys checked themselves and noted their own manhoods were shriveling up and turning to mist as well along with most of them having no body hair and breasts that were around the AA-A range. Although Tyler being in the mist for less time mostly just had his body hair turn to mist. <br />
<br />
Tyler started chuckling and said &quot;You guys are fucking girls now! Maybe I should get out now while i&#39;m sti-&quot; John sprayed Tyler with a mist nozzle in the chest for a few seconds surprising most people inside.  As the mist left Tyler was now sporting C-cups.<br />
<br />
John said &quot;Still half a man?&quot; He had a hunch Tyler probably had something to do with everyone in the Sauna now being a girl. Except maybe Tyler, John didn&#39;t want to stare at his crotch as she wasn&#39;t gay... or was it she wasn&#39;t straight at this point... was a lesbian? Either way how did the other girls react to their situation</p>
