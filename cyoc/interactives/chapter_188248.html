<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After about a minute or two, the force you feel starts to gradually diminish, and eventually led to a stop. The teleportation seems like it’s finished doing it’s thing. This whole transformation process seems to be completed, but you still can’t see, smell, taste, or feel anything inside this peel. The peel concealing your whole form, prevents you from knowing where you are. But it does feel like you are around something of heavy weight, but you don’t what it is. You can hear slight muffles from the outside, but you still can’t make out where you are at currently. As you concentrate more on what these sounds are... Sound like a beautiful humming female voice, and running shower water from the outside of your world. Are you in some sort of bag? As you ponder more, you conclude that there is a possibility that you are inside some female’s bag, and the owner of this bag is probably also taking a shower. You wonder who the owner of this “bag” belongs to…<br />
<br />
While zoning out staring at complete darkness, you were bored out of your mind! It’s been around 5 minutes! You hope that once this mysterious female gets out of the shower, she will notice you, and hope you get eaten while at it! You were thought about adjusting things now, but you decided to be patient, and wait to see what will happen. At the same time you are a little worried, if you get eaten, is it true that will you still be alive? With this powerful thing at your possession, will you be able to regenerate/transform back? Will you ever go back to being your normal self again? Was the description of this option said was true? “Who will eat me?” You were wondering to yourself, until you hear that shower water turned off. The humming voice is starting to get louder, and louder. The voice was getting more clear as a door unlocked, and began to open. Being that the more clear voice is mixed in with the loud stepping sounds, it’s still hard to identify. But once all of those stepping sounds started to settle down, and eventually stopped at a moment, the humming female voice is starting to sound familiar... Which sounds kind of like your Mother!?!?<br />
<br />
Her name is Maple, the adoptive Mother of Jeff. You never met your adoptive father. She now currently 36 years old, she will soon turn 37 in a couple months. She have been married with your father for 8 years, they both immediately got married right after they were done with graduating high school. A few months after that time was when your sister was born, and she is two+ years older than you. Your Mom and Dad, met each other ever since middle school, they were friends, and later got closer becoming a couple. You were told by your sister, that your Mother was a bit more of a happier women when your Father was alive. She would never get sad nor angry before your Father died from some unknown cause. It was believed that it was some sort of stroke. He died ten years ago, and days after that was when your Mother adopted you at the age of six+. She is still a happy and positive woman who loves her family, but she can get a little depressed whenever she is reminded of your father. She works for a hospital as a nurse. She became one after your father passed away, and which as a result made her realized the thought of loosing someone near and dear to them. She feels that she wants help the others, preventing other&#39;s on what she has been through. You judging by her appearance she’s a, cute, beautiful, and gentle person! Your Mother&#39;s is such an innocent angel, and you really love your Mother&#39;s whole personality. She has beautiful emerald eyes, a small cute nose, and has a cute little beauty mark on her upper right cheekbone near where her eye is. Overall she has a cute but also at the same time, a beautiful face. At most flawless! She has silky soft shoulder length wavy blonde hair, whenever he gets herself ready to do exercises she ties her beautiful hair to a pony tail. Your Mother’s height is probably hitting around 175.3cm(5’9), pretty tall for a women with by the comparison of you being 165.1cm(5’ 5). and her weight maybe being around 110 or 115+ lbs? Her bust size looks to be like a high C, almost hitting a mire D! She has a slim belly, with toned abs, and a nice hour-glass figure included with a heart shaped ass. She takes really good care of that goddess of a body she has! She has very silky smooth white skin, and with a little bit of tan. Once or twice during each week, she lays down under the sun to get her Vitamin D. She is very hygienic and includes a lot of healthy food in her diet, including the right vegetables, meat, fruit, etc. She goes to the gym, and also does yoga at home to keep herself healthy and in flawless shape. She is the only one that works out in the family, and she never breaks her own healthy dietary rules.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe I ended up near where Mom is! Everyone else is out this morning, it’s just me and her… This will be interesting...” You thought to yourself, wondering if the bag you are currently in is actually your Mothers gym bag. Since today is Sunday, she usually goes to the gym in the morning every weekend, being that she has a day off from work today. If it’s true, how would she react by noticing a random fresh ripe Banana in her bag? Before she ever starts going out to the gym in the morning, she makes herself a protein shake for breakfast. You also wonder if she already ate breakfast this morning. You wonder if she will eat you, save you for later, or give you to someone else later? Maybe she will include you as a part of her shake? That is if she did not eat before. You wonder how it would feel being shredded into paste by a blender, and you hope that you will not feel any pain, or hope that you wouldn’t die! I mean, there is one thing which both you and your Mother have in common, both of your all time favorite fruit is bananas! It most likely your own Mother will eat you.<br />
<br />
You really love your Mother to death. Ever since you were adopted you always admire and look up to your her, sometimes you love her a little too much. When ever your friends hang out at your place, they always talk about how hot your Mother is. You always feel embarrassed, whenever they complement her behind her back. She also gets embarrassed or a bit annoyed whenever someone start’s flirting. You always think about your mom’s sexy figure, wondering what it&#39;s like being trapped, squeezed, and pleasured inside that tight toned abdomen without her knowing. Your always curious what your Mother look’s like from the inside. How would her body would react to you, since you are now just any ordinary piece of food? Since you can’t communicate in the current form you are now, you can’t call out to your Mother… The thought of you not really being human, nor her son anymore, is starting to turn you on a little.<br />
<br />
As she was in the middle of getting ready, she decided to go check in her gym bag to see if she has all the things she needs… Then the beautiful humming continued to gradually get even more louder, which made you come to the realization that your Mother is heading towards you! “She is heading towards me!” You thought to yourself as you hear the loud stepping sounds of her bare feet, which sounds like explosions being detonated. It’s getting louder, and louder, as she heads near the bag.</p>
