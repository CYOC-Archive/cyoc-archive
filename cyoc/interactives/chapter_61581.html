<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back within the gym, Rico and Isaiah proceed to unravel their towels before entering the washroom together. Rico turns away from Isaiah, sets his bottle of soap on a bench in the corner, and removes his towel first. Isaiah, despite reiterating to himself about self control continuously beforehand, irrepressibly gazes at Rico’s hirsute derriere as he hangs his towel on a stand. As Rico grabs his soap, his wash rag, and steps onto the shower floor, Isaiah sighs and forcibly turns his head away as he could sense another erection building forth. “Christ, I’m such a fag now…,” mouths the teen without speaking. <br />
<br />
Rico scratches his bicep and turns around. “Hey, you comin’ in or what?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah...! Hold up!” replies Isaiah before removing his towel and setting it on the bench. He then hoists his loofah and clutches it tightly. “This is it!” he yells to himself in his head. “Go with the flow; stay calm. I’m only dippin’ my foot in the water here. Don’t let these emotions take control of you. Be yourself! Be a man!” Still anxious, he turns around anyway and makes his first step onto the shower floor.<br />
<br />
The first thing that catches Isaiah’s attention is Rico. Under his light treasure trail is a silver stud pierced within his belly button. It complemented his faux hawk haircut, his thin curtain beard, and the large silver studs on his ears very well. Unlike his chest and biceps, Rico possess quite a fair dosage of shagginess under his belt. Beneath his pristine cut abs lies a large shrub of lanky brown pubic hair. His pubes engross his entire crotch area and has also grown along 2 inches of the shaft of his penis. His member is completely flaccid and the head could be seen barely poking out from the foreskin surrounding it. Overall, its length and girth is slightly above the average flaccid male. While it isn’t particularly lackluster, it doesn’t possess any noticeable qualities that truly set it apart from other males. Rico’s hefty sized testicles’ endows his penis with an exaggerated appearance which makes it seem slightly bigger than what it really is. Further down, his toned thighs and calves are masked in a luxurious road of wet hair which ceases an inch above his ankles. His feet are firm and look to be a size 13 &frac12;; a foot larger than his own. Finally, small tufts of brown hair are cutely adorned on top of each toe.<br />
<br />
Isaiah then looks around in the shower room. The size of the floor is relatively average and has about 7 shower heads each along the side walls. On each side are 2 waterproof wooden benches that stretched from the front wall to the back. The benches are lodged on the floor and away from the side wall which makes it convenient for a visitor to either stand or sit while they wash. Each shower is complete with a built in hose and a small rack for bath products. Just next to Isaiah is a Rubbermaid&copy; trash can mounted against the front wall. The can is overfilled and has trash stuffed in the shoot. In fact, the washroom throughout is relatively unkempt as various wrappers, cigarette buds, &amp; even used condoms spread throughout the whitish granite floor. Some hoses lay on the ground and aren’t hanged properly, buckets lie on its side in the middle of the wash room, and some showers had abandoned bath products still on its shelf. “This room is a frickin’ dump man...,” groaned Isaiah.<br />
<br />
Rico nods. “I know right? I hear the head janitor quit last week actually.”<br />
<br />
While Rico gets situated under a shower, Isaiah avoids the nearby trashcan and approaches him. With each step, Isaiah’s confidence and control grew. Just before he sat at an adjacent shower, Rico mentions, “Whoa wait brah, I wouldn’t sit there if I were you. That water knob’s broken.” Rico scoots a tad to his right. “Try the one on my left here.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah crosses under Rico’s shower and stands under the one previously mentioned. On the floor lies an empty bucket, a shower hose, and a pair of black Easton&copy; shower sandals. “These sandals yours?” asks Isaiah.<br />
Rico turns his shower on. “Naw. They’ve been there since I got here.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah looks back at the sandals and shrugs. “Finders Keepers I guess.” He kicks the sandals up straight and slides his feet into them. Even though they looked really cool, his size 12 &amp; 1/2 feet is much too small for them.<br />
<br />
Rico laughs, “Haha! Dude, take those off. They’re way too big for ya.“<br />
<br />
Isaiah raises his knee and eyes the large sandals as they dangle from his feet. “Err yeah, I see what ya mean.” He lowers his knee down. “Meh, they’ll do ‘til I get my shoes back at least.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah adjusts the shower head and turns his shower on. As he raises his loofah, it then occurs to him that he’s without soap. He glances over at Rico’s bottle to see if he has some; however, it looks like there’s hardly anything left inside. Isaiah searches around and happens to find an almost empty bottle of AXE body wash on the shower shelf next to him. “Wow, guys here really do forget a lot of stuff….,” he mumbles to himself as he grabs it and proceeds to soak his loofah.<br />
<br />
As Isaiah begins to wash his body, Rico takes a peep at Isaiah’s backside. “Sooo… Where ya from?” he asks as he continues washing.<br />
<br />
“I’m from a town up north from here.”<br />
<br />
“Oh that place huh? Ya like it up there?”<br />
<br />
“Eh… not really. It’s kinda borin’ actually; too suburban if you know what I’m sayin’.”<br />
<br />
“Heheh, I hear ya brah. Most small town peeps your age feel that way. I was kinda like you actually.”<br />
<br />
“You wanted somethin’ different to huh?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, the city life’s just too fast for me man; too loud. I wanted to stay in an area much more chill and in tune to my rhythm.”  Rico sits and begins washing his legs. “So, I decided to hit up the country life and here I am now.”<br />
<br />
“I bet you didn’t expect to find a gay joint way out here.”<br />
<br />
“Tell me about it! I was like spazzin’ out when I heard of this place.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah sits down and washes his arms. “You really do like it out here, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Definitely; the guys here are rad compared to the gays you meet in the city. Everyone knows everyone and they all look out for one another.”<br />
<br />
“But why a bar full of bears though?”<br />
<br />
“Why not? It’s not like there’s another set-up out here. Besides brah, there’s nothin’ better than chillin’ out with a gruff bearded dude as they give me head.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah couldn’t ignore how arousing that sounded.”I… uh... agree,” he stutters as he tries to get used to the homosexual flow.<br />
<br />
Rico sets his rag on his lap and the 2 continue to talk. He asks Isaiah about football and their conversation soon shifts into a history of the sport. Rico babbles on about his favorite team and their competition this season, while Isaiah listens and gives some opinions of his own. Both were enjoying the others’ company and they grew quite fond with each other.  Their conversation came to an abrupt halt as Isaiah’s stomach begins rumbling. “Eh… Sorry ‘bout that man,” apologized Isaiah as he clutches his waist. “I’m starvin’. I haven’t eaten anything since this morning’.”<br />
<br />
“You like Barbeque Pringles? I got some in my bag if you want.”<br />
<br />
“Aw, that sounds delicious man. I’d like that.”<br />
<br />
“Cool. Let’s finish up in here first, alright?”<br />
<br />
Isaiah nods and the 2 continue bathing. Rico watches as the teen stands, soaks his loofah, and proceeds to give his crotch a good scrubbing. “Y’know dude, I kinda don’t tell this to other guys but… you got a really big dick man.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah instantly stops and looks at Rico. “Huh…!?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’ve come across lots of guys and yours is pretty big in comparison.” Rico looks down at his own penis. “It kinda makes me a little jealous actually.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah didn’t know what to say. This is the first time a guy (a gay guy no less) ever complimented his endowment. He became oddly thrilled from hearing such flattery; especially from such a… handsome hunky man like him. Wait, a handsome hunky man? Isaiah blushes, turns around, and continues to scrub his growing rod. “Thanks man… Uh... um, you don’t… need to be jealous. I-I think you got a… n-nice ass! Y-yeah, you got a really nice ass, dude!” Isaiah couldn’t believe he returned his compliment; it felt rather good and very relieving to do so as well. For once, he actually thought that he could get used to being a homo now.<br />
<br />
Rico stands and scrubs his neck with his rag. “Nice ass eh? Geez, why does every guy think I’m some bottom?” The teen continues to proudly scrub his fully erect rod as Rico further soaks his rag and steps forward a little. While soaking, he checks out Isaiah’s cut monster again and whistles at the sight. “Damn brah, look at that thing! I’d kill for some of that length.” Rico then jokingly slaps Isaiah’s hard pole causing it to bounce up and down. <br />
<br />
“Dude, what the hell?” instantly replies a shocked yet aroused Isaiah.<br />
<br />
“Haha! You better be a top like me with a dick like that man.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah pauses for a bit as the great pleasure he feels from Rico’s little action subsides. At this point, Isaiah was finding it extremely difficult trying to control his sexual urges. He stares deeply at Rico’s incredible physique; and all of a sudden reaches his hand out and firmly squeezes Rico’s thick buttox. <br />
“Whoa-ho, easy there brah!” smiles Rico. <br />
<br />
Isaiah is astonished he had done such a thing. What really bothers him is that he did it out of reaction! He quickly grew into a panic as he needed to relieve himself before he totally loses control. “Hey, I got-gotta take a wiz man,” says Isaiah as he grabs his AXE bottle and quickly walks out the showers.<br />
<br />
“Yo, I’ll be out in a sec. Wait for me at my locker.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah gives him a heads up and absentmindedly winks at him. He then dries himself off with his towel while he makes haste to the restroom. As he enters, he hears someone occupying the far stall. Not paying much attention to the unknown user, he goes into the closest stall and locks it. He pulls down the toilet seat, falls on top, and unravels his towel which reveals his still fully erect penis. The teen lays back, closes his eyes, and begins pumping his marvelous rod up and down. In no time, Isaiah became buried in a wave of sheer ecstasy. Images of Rico and his incredibly physique course through the teen’s mind like wildfire. Just the thought of Rico’s moist armpits, his sweaty biceps, his hairy feet, and his firm ass in his grasps drives him over the edge. As Isaiah continues to drown himself with pleasure, the unknown visitor in the far stall lets loose a big one. The rancid smell quickly airs towards Isaiah way and only makes him think of Rico’s rear even more. He grits his teeth and begins utilizing both of his hands. He wants him; no, he NEEDS him. He badly needs to shove his pride inside that gorgeous jock’s rear. He viciously needs to work that hole until he cries for daddy. He needs to extinguish his masculine seed within that stud and show him who’s truly a man. Isaiah cracks an eerie smile and chuckles deeply as he reiterates these same images in his head over and over. The teen finally clocks in at his climax and expends his supply of man juice with great zest. As a final testament to this immense felicity, he deeply inhales a vast amount of the strong odor in the air – and coughs. <br />
<br />
Isaiah shakes his head and opens his eyes as his sexual desire swiftly diminishes. He glimpses upon a large amount of nut as it drips from his fingertips and into his dense pubes. He moans with great delight as that masturbation session was truly something out of this world. Although he couldn’t deny how great he feels, he became somewhat worried by his actions and thoughts during that episode. “Sweat, feet, pit’s and… ass?” he asks himself in his head. “Did I… develop some kind of odor fetish?” He sniffs the air again and gags a little from the disgusting stench. Oddly enough, his member twitches a little. “Oh great…” he thought, “Not only am I a homo now, I’m a homo who apparently gets off to guys who stink…” He sighs in disbelief of it all really.  “Dammit, why me?” Just then, his stomach churns again as it calls out for food. He scratches his nut-drenched abs and silently moans for food.He shoves out some toilet paper from the dispenser and prepares his still wet loofah, then begins to clean himself. Afterwards, he stands, wraps his towel around his waist, and proceeds to leave the stall. Upon exiting, he sees a much older male washing his hands at the sink. “Must be the guy from the other stall” thought Isaiah as he approaches the sink furthest away from the man. He turns on the faucet and examines himself in the mirror as he washes his hands. He scratches the side of his face and notices his skin is beginning to show signs of dryness. Hoping to alleviate it somewhat, he splashes a handful of water on his face and proceeds to also rub his itchy arms with water as well.<br />
 <br />
Just then, the other guy finishes up, walks towards Isaiah, and roughly caresses the teens shoulder as he passes by. “Try not ta make yer yank sessions so obvious kid. Ah heardja gruntin’ like a wild boar” whispers the man. Out of reaction, Isaiah replies “Thanks” and returns the older man’s flirt by giving him a heads up, winking, and even airs a kiss to him. The guy chuckles under his breath, shakes his head, and exits the restroom. Isaiah on the other hand looks at himself in the mirror with confusion. “Wow. I’m… really starting to get into this,” he awes. He smiles, grabs his belongings and exits the restroom with strong confidence.<br />
<br />
==========================<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Lester comes up empty handed at the bar and is unable to find his cousin, Monty. He decides he should check at home next to see if he’s there. After crossing the lot, he unlocks the house door, and enters. Sitting on the sofa in the living room is Mark and a very frustrated C.J. “Huh? Ah figger you fellas were seein’ yer friend. What happened?”<br />
<br />
“Your lunatic dad told us to wait her for a minute,” answers Mark.<br />
<br />
“Hmph! We’ve been sitting here for almost 20 minutes!” yells an angry C.J. “What’s taking him so long!? He better not touch Isaiah!” <br />
<br />
“Now now, lil’ fella. Ah’m shure mah pa has good reason.”<br />
<br />
“Good reason!? What “Good Reason” is it that it takes a whole 20 minutes just to see our friend!?”<br />
<br />
“Woah, settle down.” Lester pauses for a quick second and thinks his words carefully this time. “Hey, how ‘bout you 2 wait heer and ah go see what’s keepin’ mah pa, ahright?”<br />
<br />
“If you’re going, then we’re going to!” demands C.J.<br />
<br />
Lester didn’t want to say no or else they’ll really become suspicious. “Ahright, have it yer way. Ka’mon.<br />
<br />
With that, Lester leads the 2 downstairs and into their basement. They walk past a nicely furnished game/lounge room and arrive at a dead end. <br />
<br />
<br />
“Dude, what the hell…?,” groans Mark. “This is a brick wall!”<br />
<br />
“I knew he was just leading us on!” retorts C.J.<br />
<br />
“Gosh darnit, hush!” Lester listens closely to the wall and hears footsteps approaching. “Move back a bit fellas. Someone’s comin’.”<br />
<br />
Confused, C.J. and Mark look at each other and take a couple steps back with Lester. Just then, buttons are heard and the brick wall slowly slides open.<br />
<br />
C.J. gasps, “A secret door!?”<br />
<br />
Out from the bizarre passageway comes Maxwell; the Arctos Agent, Pryce; and to C.J. and Marks great surprise; Isaiah. Isaiah looks as if he’d just woken up and rubs his eyes. <br />
<br />
Maxwell steps forward. “Huh? What you boys do—“<br />
<br />
“Isaiah!!” yells the 2 teens simultaneously, interrupting Maxwell. They both rush past the Arctos agent and quickly surround their friend. <br />
<br />
“Are you alright!? Are you hurt!? They haven’t done anything to you have they?” asks an anxious C.J.<br />
<br />
“Dude, we were worried to death! What were you doing down there!?” questions a surprised Mark.<br />
<br />
Isaiah staggers back a bit as they were too close. “Woah, guys! Chill! I’m fine!”<br />
<br />
Maxwell ignores the trio, uses a remote to shut the brick wall, and approaches his son. “Why the hell them boys down here Lester!?” yells Maxwell in an oddly non-thunderous tone. “And ain’t you sposed (supposed) ta be in the gym tendin’ to our guest!?”<br />
<br />
“Well pa, I… um… them… uh-” Lester was too scared to explain himself.<br />
<br />
Maxwells grunts. “Hmph! Just forget it. Somethin’ been up wit’ you boy. We’re gun’ have a LONG talk later, heer?” Maxwell turns around. “You fellas hungry? I got myself a whole cache of barbeque left from a hootenanny we had the other day.”<br />
<br />
“Th-that’s okay, sir. We REALLY need to get home. Right C.J.?”<br />
<br />
C.J. became a little hesitant. If they were to leave now, they probably would never find their other friend [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]. There’s also the fact he hadn’t eaten anything since Lunch during school. “Actually guys, I think I’ll take them up on their offer.”<br />
<br />
“Dude, no!! It’s almost 8:30 at night!! Let’s go!” roars Mark.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, but I can’t leave just yet…”<br />
<br />
“Why!? Are you THAT dead set on finding [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]!? Forget it man, he’s gone!”<br />
<br />
“Don’t say that, Mark!” answers C.J. loudly. “He’s not gone!! I know he’s not!”<br />
<br />
“C.J…!” says Isaiah in a bewildered yet quiet tone. <br />
<br />
“I…I’m sorry, guys. You wouldn’t understand… I just have to find him.”<br />
<br />
Pryce, the stern Arctos Agent, steps forward. “Sorry to intrude in your conversation; but if you 2 would prefer, I could arrange a ride that can escort you boys home. This way, this child here can stay if he so desires.<br />
<br />
Mark and Isaiah looks at C.J. and he doesn’t respond. “Yeah… Alright mister, let’s do that,” answers Mark.<br />
“Same here,” says Isaiah. “I don’t think I can stand another minute hell hole.”<br />
<br />
“Very well, let us proceed to my driver at hand; if you would excuse me, Maxwell.”<br />
<br />
“Uh-huh,” he replies as Pryce leads Mark and Isaiah back upstairs.<br />
<br />
Just before they leave, C.J. tells them “I’ll see you tomorrow guys.” His friends don’t respond and ignore him.<br />
<br />
After a brief moment in silence, Maxwell steps up to C.J. and says “Well, guess it’s jus’ you n’ me now, eh? Don’t worry boy, I gots all kinds of barbeque that’ll make yer mouth water!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” mumbles C.J.<br />
<br />
Lester taps his dad on the shoulder. “Hey, Pa. C’mere for a sec, will ya?”<br />
<br />
“Um… ‘Scuse mahself son. Just a second, alright?” Lester leads his dad to the other end of the basement floor. “What now, boy…?”<br />
<br />
“Ya happen to know where Monty at, Pa? He went and gon’ stole our guest’s clothes.”<br />
<br />
“What? Tell me what happened.” Lester briefly tells him what had went on, and Maxwell sighs. “Ehh, so that’s why you’re still here. I tell ya, that idiot always be messin’ up stuff. It don’t matter now though; after tonight, he’ll be a changed man.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, so you guys have started doin’ that to him now, huh…?” replies Lester as he got the hint and asks in a very unsurprising tone. “You know where he put his gym bag at?”<br />
<br />
“Go check up in his room. He might’ve left it hangin’ on his closet like he ahways do.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, thanks Pa.”<br />
<br />
“Hey soldier, while you at it, go ahead n’ bring our future family member here. I wanna get ta know him better before I lay the brick on him.”<br />
<br />
“Huh? But what ‘bout—“<br />
<br />
“Shh!,” he utters quietly. “It’s alright; we’re jus’ gon’ wipe his memory anyway. ‘Sides, I reckon that boy won’t leave ‘til he finds his friend he keeps yappin’ on about.”<br />
<br />
“Well okay, Pa; if you want.”<br />
<br />
“That a boy, soldier. Now git goin’”<br />
<br />
Lester and Maxwell re-approach C.J. and Lester heads upstairs. “I’ll be back in a giffy, fella.”<br />
<br />
As Lester leaves the building, Maxwell steps ahead and motions for C.J to follow.“Alrighty then, how ‘bout we head on up as well.”<br />
<br />
C.J. nods his head nervously and proceeds. At the same time, Mark and Isaiah continue to approach the front parking lot with Pryce.<br />
<br />
“So what’s with that red plaid get-up, man?” asks Mark.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” answers Isaiah as he keeps pulling up his pants and boxers. “This crap was on me as soon as I woke up.” His left foot slides out from the Tennis shoe causing Isaiah to go back and retrieve it.<br />
<br />
“Haha! Dude, you look so ridiculous. It doesn’t fit you at all”<br />
<br />
“I know, right?” he replies as he inserts his foot back into the large shoe. They soon arrive at a large limousine. Pryce circles the expensive vehicle and notifies the driver on what’s going on.<br />
<br />
“So what was with you earlier?” asks Mark.<br />
<br />
“Huh?”<br />
<br />
“You know, in that bar when you went all crazy.”<br />
<br />
“I went… crazy? What?” Isaiah couldn’t recall anything of the sort. All he could remember was that awful nightmare he had as that gay brute while he was asleep. “Did somethin’ happen?”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean “did something happen”? You tossed me and this one big guy around like it was nothing! <br />
<br />
“I did?”<br />
<br />
“Pardon me, young sirs” interrupts Pryce as he approaches them. He pulls from his suit 2 stacks of sticky notes and a pen, and then hands them to the teens. “Would you please write your addresses on these sticky notes please? The driver will need them for his GPS.”<br />
<br />
“Uh… alright,” replies Isaiah as he opens the pen and write his address down. He hands it over to Mark and he does the same. Once finish, he hands the notes and pen back to Pryce.<br />
<br />
“Thank you.” He says as he puts them in his pocket. “Before you leave, there is something I would like to show you.” Pryce pulls out his grayish-blue leather gloves, slides them on, and cups his hands together.<br />
 <br />
“Is this some kind of magic trick?” asks Mark.<br />
<br />
“You… could say that,” replies Pryce as he closes his eyes. Soon after, his gloves began to emit a familiar blue aura.</p>
