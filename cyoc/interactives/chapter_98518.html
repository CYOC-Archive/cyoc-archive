<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(I&#39;m backing up in the chronology a little bit to tell something that happened before the wedding and then I&#39;ll get back to after the wedding.)<br />
<br />
Steve had an uncle named Laban. Laban was a Southern Baptist fire and brimstone preacher although he fell into disfavor within his church because of his extreme views. So Laban established his own church of about 100 loyal followers. Laban was one of those preachers who believed in the homosexual conspiracy sent from Hell to wage war against Christianity.<br />
<br />
When Laban heard about Steve playing dollies, Laban wrote several letters to Steve urging Steve to repent &quot;before God pours out his terrible wrath and judgment&quot;. Laban even prophesied plagues that would fall on Steve and on Sheryl&#39;s side of the family for their unGodly ways. Steve ignored the letters because even though Laban&#39;s words were harsh, they were just words.<br />
<br />
Steve had warned Sheryl and her family that Laban might attend the wedding even though he wasn&#39;t invited. Sheryl said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;ve dealt with those kind of people before. Our family has survived far worse than the wild ramblings of a mad man. Just pretend that Laban is mentally ill, like those homeless people that talk to their own reflection. Then you won&#39;t care what he says.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if he becomes violent or worse, brings his followers with him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will deal with that as well. We will have the dollhouse at the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laban did have an influence on Steve&#39;s dad, Jabez. Although Jabez was a lot more mellow and easy going, he was a Southern Baptist too and so there were times when Jabez listened to Laban&#39;s advice and there were times when Jabez did not listen to Laban&#39;s advice.<br />
<br />
Laban did attend the wedding. He did not cause a scene at the wedding but the hate in his eyes was seen by all. Laban even kept his cool at the beginning of the reception. He whispered to Steve, &quot;Well so far, that has been a respectable wedding. I&#39;m surprised your wife kept her clothes on. I half expected her to rip off her clothes and start an orgy. Maybe I misjudged her. She can&#39;t help coming from a family of degenerates but maybe she herself is on the straight and narrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh, . . . Thank you for attending.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now listen son. You have been like a son to me being kin and all. I&#39;m only looking out for you because I care about you. I love you with the love of God and I don&#39;t want to see you wind up in Hell. I know I&#39;ve been harsh in the past but one day you&#39;ll realize it&#39;s all been in your best interest and you&#39;ll thank me for it. I&#39;ve been praying that you don&#39;t wake up one day to find yourself in bed with a demon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle Laban, Aunt Orpah is not a demon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She got shingles. That&#39;s the mark of her demonic bloodline.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve did his best to politely put an end to Laban&#39;s ramblings and Laban did move on to talk to someone else.<br />
<br />
It was soon after this that Steve found himself standing naked on top of the cake. When Laban and Jabez were at the table getting their pieces of cake, Laban said, &quot;That&#39;s quite a son you raised there. When Noah showed off his dangly bits, he cursed all the descendants of Ham with black skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what the Bible says. If Noah&#39;s nudity had been a sin, why wasn&#39;t Noah cursed? Ham was cursed for the sin of mocking, not because he saw nudity. Also, the Bible never says that any of Hams descendants were black.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jabez, your son throws that n word around so much he&#39;s bound to be cursed. You&#39;ve been too easy on him. You needed to take the strap to him more often. Spare the rod and this is what you get.&quot; It looked for a moment like Laban was about to spit on Steve and all over the wedding cake but Laban just turned his head and walked away without any cake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Son, do you have to antagonize him? It&#39;s hard enough trying to enjoy a piece of wedding cake without thinking about your pickle leaking it&#39;s juice onto the cake.&quot; Jabez didn&#39;t take any cake either. Most people though were fine. A few of the more squeamish ones asked specifically for pieces from the cake furthest from Steve and even then, inspected the cake thoroughly before deciding not to have any cake. None of Sheryl&#39;s side of the family were squeamish and neither were several of Steve&#39;s friends.<br />
<br />
There was wine at the wedding: several bottles of 2007 La Grenouille Rouganté. Although everyone on Sheryl&#39;s side of the family including Matheo had a small wine, none of them were heavy drinkers. Very few even asked for a refill. The ones who kept going back for refills were mostly from Steve&#39;s side of the family and the one who drank the most was Laban.<br />
<br />
Then Matheo grabbed Steve and started passing him around. It wasn&#39;t too bad at first, especially when he was in the hands of Sheryl&#39;s side of the family. A lot of them simply asked Steve about football, completely ignoring his nudity. If they did mention his nudity, it was typically about the muscles he used while playing football.<br />
<br />
Steve&#39;s friends were a little more raucous. Also some of the teenagers at the wedding made dirty jokes. Steve blushed a lot which made them laugh more but all they were interested in was making jokes at Steve&#39;s expense. Thomas and some of Sheryl&#39;s relatives had to step in occasionally when the jokes got too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were just having a little fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but roasting his nuts over a candle flame isn&#39;t fun. You could seriously injure him. Now please wash the honey off his testicles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I ain&#39;t touching his junk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t have a problem drizzling honey onto his junk. Now either use a wet napkin or lick the honey off. You should be kinder or we&#39;ll make you take a turn as a dolly and let a kid roast your nuts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy, Steve&#39;s friend and teammate, quickly used a wet napkin but that wasn&#39;t very effective so Thomas encouraged him to lick it off. &quot;Steve, it&#39;s a good thing you&#39;re all clean shaved.&quot; Steve tried to keep from giving Billy a taste of pre-cum but if Billy did taste anything other than honey, he never said.<br />
<br />
A little later, another guest said, &quot;I am just curious like a kid with a dolly. There is nothing sexual about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care. You&#39;re nineteen and legally an adult. You&#39;ve long past the age when you get to be curious. I&#39;m sure you already know about male anatomy and if you don&#39;t, you can examine your own. Now get the q-tip out of his ass. Sorry about that Steve. That is not the kind of treatment we allow kids to do with dollies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve did get erections from all the attention. He was told to ignore it and it would go away but before his erection could ever fade, someone else did something to bring it back. Steve asked to put a stop to this.<br />
<br />
Thomas said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry if a few people were a little too rough but I&#39;d say that most people have been fairly well behaved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But everyone can see my erection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what. It&#39;s just a natural physiological response, a reflex. Let em look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they are touching it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like this?&quot; Thomas pressed Steve&#39;s dick down until it was pointing at the floor. &quot;When they point your dick down for you they&#39;re shutting off the flow. They are keeping you from leaking despite your erection. You can use this technique with Sheryl to keep from orgasming too soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s causing me a massive case of blue balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well don&#39;t worry about that. You&#39;ll get a chance to take care of that later and I&#39;m sure Sheryl will appreciate the help we&#39;re giving you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheryl came by, &quot;What help is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re keeping him from orgasming and teaching him how to delay it for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank you Thomas. Steve, I appreciate so much what you are doing. I&#39;ve been swamped with all the guests wanting to talk with me. I haven&#39;t even had a chance to eat anything myself. Thank you for keeping the guest entertained.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But does everyone have to keep touching my penis?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas said, &quot;You do have a large penis. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if yours is the largest in the family. We need to compare you to Hugo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheryl interrupted. &quot;We don&#39;t have time for that. We&#39;ve got to take wedding pictures. Bring Steve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about my tuxedo and my size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, no time.&quot;<br />
<br />
So in all the wedding pictures that Steve was in, he was naked and only eleven inches tall while some relative held his penis down BUT they did nothing to hide it. They went to great lengths to make it look like Steve&#39;s penis was hanging naturally down and flaccid. Everyone was making so much noise that no one could hear Steve express his wishes for how the pictures should be taken.<br />
<br />
Eventually, in all the chaos of the pictures, Steve was handed off to Laban who snuck away from everyone and found a quiet place to be alone. He was severely drunk and Steve could almost taste the alcohol on Laban&#39;s breathe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laban take me back to the party. There are still more pictures to take.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You little devil. You demon from Hell. hic. I&#39;ve been watching you all night trying to seduce me with that plump ass of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? I&#39;m not seducing anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes you are my little luscious he devil. You&#39;re seducing me and it&#39;s working. I know what you want. Oh yes, I-I-I-I-I know what you want. You want to meet my little friend. Come meet my little friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laban lowered Steve and Steve noticed that Laban&#39;s ~little friend~ was hanging out of his pants. It wasn&#39;t that little. The glans alone was bigger than Steve&#39;s head and as Steve got face to face with Laban&#39;s little friend, he realized that his head could fit inside Laban&#39;s piss slit. The whole penis was old and gnarly and not completely clean.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Uncle, No.&quot; But his words were muffled as his face was plunged into a wet, throbbing world.</p>
