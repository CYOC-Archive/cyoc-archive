<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim began to suckle. Almost immediately he could feel the changes begin, Gradually his body began to move against Sally as he shrunk. His clothes felt a bit loose. He had to readjust his body so that he could continue to drink the special youthening milk. At one point he almost stopped thinking he would have to get to class in college. But why would he have to do that? He hadn&#39;t graduated from high school yet.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Sally broke the connection with her finger. She looked down at the boy at giggled. She now had transformed Jim into a young fourteen year old, just barely in High School, and completely returned to his thin, short, and gawky phase of long skinny limbs, too large hands and feet, and a voice still having not settled into its complete maturity yet.<br />
<br />
Jim was having problems with his clothes. He had almost tripped over his too long pants. His shirt was baggy on him and the shirt shelves extended several inches beyond his hands. Sally had already begun to adjust his clothes much as a mother would do. She tightened his belt and started to roll up the pants to accommodate his now shorter inseam. She had to ignore the firm bulge that was in his pants as she did. It wasn&#39;t as large as it had been when Jim had first begun to drink from her breast, but he definitely was on the wrong side of puberty for Sally. She wanted more babies not a horny high schooler.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you doing this? If I drink more it would solve the problem,&quot; Jim pleaded in a voice that was on the edge of breaking higher.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ll have more, and soon your be my little man she said as she kissed his check. But first I have a little job for you. There were two women out at a table, remember them? I want you to get them to enter the women&#39;s bathroom next door. You&#39;ll need playmates when you&#39;re young enough for me,&quot; said Sally.<br />
<br />
Jim wasn&#39;t happy. He wanted more of the milk so that he could be a boy again. Girls were nice, but he felt awkward around them, and wouldn&#39;t know what to say to girls his own age, let alone two grown women.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just say that your older sister is having a little trouble in the bathroom, and if they could check on her for you,&quot; said Sally rather expertly.<br />
<br />
Jim immediately felt more comfortable with his assignment and diligently nodded his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now hurry along,&quot; ushered Sally who practically pushed Jim out of the bathroom, then just as she was about to scoop up the infantile Henry, Sally noticed a forgotten remote on the tile floor. Curious about it, she picked it up and then scooped up Henry before leaving the Men&#39;s room, and entered the Women&#39;s room, where she settled Henry down on a diaper changing station and diapered him. As she did, her breast once again poked out of her blouse and too big bra, and Henry looked up and immediately reached up and grabbed for the breast, pulling it down to suckle. As he fought to pull the breast closer he kicked the remote that she had placed on the changing station next to Henry, to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, all right, I guess a little won&#39;t hurt,&quot; said Sally, before giving up the fight to allow the three month old to suckle his fill. He continued to shrink as she scooped him up off the changing station. The diaper she had just fastened so securely now slipped off his shrinking form as weeks melted off her baby boy until suddenly with a pop, Sally was sent to the floor feeling as if a mack truck had just run her over.<br />
<br />
Her clothes felt out of proportion, and her pants having ripped open, unable to stretch as far as her nine month belly had. This sudden change however brought a new discovery as she tried getting herself up, she saw the small remote was on the floor beside her. She picked it up and tried flipping the switch labeled clothes. A green button lit up which she pressed and suddenly her pants, blouse, and bra were stretching and shrinking to fit her expanded youthful body.<br />
<br />
Sally eventually managed to get into something of a sitting position on the bathroom floor. Both admiring and cursing her large belly. She placed her hand protectively on it and could feel baby Henry moving inside of her. Sally mused about her new belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s so big, how am I going to get around? Hell, how am I going to get up?&quot; thought Sally rubbing her stomach.<br />
<br />
Sally then looks at the remote and observed the numerous options on it like age regression, transgender etc.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;This is quite a remote&#39;&#39; thought Sally &#39;&#39;I want to try it out.&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
As she was admiring the remote, she heard the door to the bathroom open.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Must be Jim with the women&#39;&#39;, Sally thought and turned to look at the door.<br />
<br />
To Sally&#39;s dismay, Sally sees...</p>
