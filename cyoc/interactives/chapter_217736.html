<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Three anxious days passed, and Hank waited, but no Familiar had arrived. Although, Hank put much of his free time to valued use; by his studying the magic wheeling Tome. Hank was no wizard, witch, or magician, but whoever wrote the Tome knew well how to describe, as teach using layman’s terminology and no abbreviations. The Tome held its contents in four specified books, the beginning dealt with spells, the second with curses, the third with potions, and the fourth the most difficult dealing as contractual devil and demonic planned blights.<br />
<br />
When the Tome registered Familiar first spoke to Hank, it mentioned as to their meeting, informing Hank to check page 3, of paragraph 6, the preface and read aloud the invitation for its coming appearance.<br />
<br />
Hank opened the Tome and flipped through the preface pages to page 3, did focus his attention to paragraph six. &quot;Opening of a portal, an invitation makes, as enhanced vitality does commence. As to forever beginning then as that you are one cursed, great gains come by the acquaintance and knowledge from a devil-familiar. Your first spell tried made of you to knowing the form being a male donkey animal; it is from this temptation you need to choose, as remain the real you a donkey at stud, or a human, capable to control the powers held by the Tome?”<br />
<br />
The paragraph read and Hank began to wonder, he remembering his first reading of the caption paragraph, as it read in general terms, and not so pointing as directed to him living with his present situation. The more that Hank sat, stood, or walked, he began thinking about the Tome as leading of people to regard of worshiping sensuality; and he the feel of having still an equine penis.<br />
<br />
Hank felt an urge to use the  Tome and he then return to being either a stud donkey, or avail his youthful fantasy of becoming a pony equine; he then capable to join the ponies residing at the Pale Valley Ranch, a Pony stud farm.<br />
<br />
His expected devil Familiar having not arrived to foster his delights, suggested he should make further use of the Tome to signify his symbolic allegiance. Yet, of what was he loyal to, as doing of evil to others, as if for gaining then what?<br />
<br />
The stiffening and rise of his donkey cock to an erection worthy for mating or masturbating; he realized as came from emotion. So, as what was emotion, a personal sense of passion, enhancing of recalled sensations, creating similar to new feelings of want. As then want, a yearning desire, as in his present sensual situation, he recalled the lusty feeling to dominate, while thrusting, enjoying the sensuality of his masculinity.<br />
<br />
Hmm, what goes then comes full cycle to enhance and propagate of what he felt as sincere.<br />
<br />
Hank turned and gazed upon the Tome, he seeing it with a sense of clearer thinking, knowing that its ways and means led those who made us of it to dooming of others; while asserting of damnation to they who put their faith in magic and evil.   One thought was for sure, as from all that Hank had read from the Tome, there were numerous ways to defame and disfigure, but no methods for the returning of those doomed to their original origin of self.<br />
<br />
As Hank thought more, he then reminded about what became of his father, the man who never had the time available to being a Dad. <br />
<br />
There was something bothersome about the spells and potions held within the Tome, and that being the preferred manner of doom was to put people on hoofs. Something about hooves seemed ideal for the devils to defame and disfigure people as becoming partially or full-on of bodily form as brute animals.<br />
<br />
The Tome offered sensual forms of domination, delight, or dismay. He when a donkey felt the obvious feelings of male delights; although domination like lorded over his jennet, donkey-transformed father never materialized. Hank thought, after he had so brutally bred his albino, all white fatherly jennet, and mate, left him a sad feeling and virtually, no sense of personal satisfaction.<br />
<br />
His lucky escape did thrill him, and the fact he never mated that fourth, as final breeding session what would have doomed him to remain then a male donkey.<br />
<br />
“No, I just can’t bring myself to giving thrills to those who rule in Hell,” Hank voiced aloud a sense of determination!<br />
<br />
The Tome lying there on the kitchen table was in the mindset of Hank, of it being the essence of evil.<br />
<br />
A thought bloomed then, as Hank turned and stepped close to the Tome, his one plan then was to destroy the Tome before he would dare use it to give him a thrill.<br />
<br />
“I would much rather that you wouldn’t,” spoke deep, baritone voice!<br />
<br />
“Who what, oh my holy…,” Hank exclaimed, as he turned and saw standing there as if in the naked flesh, what he recalled of him having wished he was physically, when sitting in his car and looking at the sign advertising the Pale Valley pony stud farm.<br />
<br />
Standing there with Hank in the kitchen was a devil-creature being of mostly pony stallion, it black of fur, mane, and tail. It had a human face, and hands, but otherwise stood upright, on hind legs with pony hoofs.<br />
<br />
“Maybe you do not know, but there is only four other copies of that same Tome left unspoiled upon the planet earth. Two of the four became as buried when their owned died, and the one other viable as is yours sets in a museum.  <br />
<br />
However, if from what you thought about as done for you by me, your’ Familiar could and can make that lusty desire as quite real, I could even now gift you accordingly.<br />
<br />
“Doing what for me,” Hank as asked?<br />
<br />
 “A man bearing the cock similar that to a male donkey could never make love to a human wife,” that is what you thought about, as almost said your wish aloud. So, allow me to offer you help with feeling capable,” he said, he the devil-pony-Familiar said.<br />
<br />
“Ack, what is this,” Hank yelped, as his stout twenty-two inch long donkey cock began to shrink of girth and length.<br />
<br />
“Indeed my Master, a man having the genitals similar to those of a pony stallion could then fit inside a woman; and when as if the urge and need arose, would work as well when mating a pony mare. See Master, take hold of it and have a good look at my handiwork,” said the stud minded pony Familiar.<br />
<br />
Hank took hold of his cock in both hands, seeing as realizing how his donkey cock dwindled down to the size of what many a pony stallion has as its prized male tool. All happened as unexpected while Hank’s cock shrank, his scrotum did swell, and both cock and testicles became the proper to a large breed, male pony.<br />
<br />
“Now my Master, time to feel again some stallion style joy, as try masturbating with it but doing so equine style using that libido, and no hands, begin bonking it against your belly. Oh yes, I see, your being human the belly is not distended or the same as when you were a donkey. That is an easy fix, let me help again; as what you need to making belly beating as sensual requires belly fur. Hmm, belly fur should start then body fur with black, as weather tough pony hide, but not just along that gut,” said the Familiar.<br />
<br />
“To what is this,” Hank excitedly exclaimed, he seeing the black skin of his scrotum and sheath begin to spreading, encompassing up his torso, as followed by pony fur, it also tweaked his buttocks, thighs, legs, feet, and to a whole self physical change. “Damn it, you are making me to become a pony stallion, a Dun tan with black tail and a mane. Why, I am becoming more a pony animal; and you are doing this as why…,” groaned Hank, as he saw and felt of similar such changing, of what happened when became then a donkey.<br />
<br />
“Hey, hey, my ears, my head, leave me the ability to speak at least,” Hank said his last words as the transition engulfed his head, jaw, teeth, and tongue. As his nostrils merged with the mouth to forming again a equine muzzle, Hank let go a whinny.<br />
<br />
‘’Ah yes, Master your Norwegian heritage shows an apparent flux that changed what I expected of you to become a Shetland stallion, has created a Fjord pony, grown and worthy to begin being at stud.<br />
<br />
Now show me, oh yes Master, you remember how an equine masturbates. Swing up with your libido, and let that sensual cock bonk against a furred belly. Yes, and release the strained pressure to let your cock fall, as swing down hard. Do it, as do it again, very nice rhythm to your cock bumping, yes, yes…, a little more and then…, wha…lah, as there it blows a gusher!”<br />
<br />
Hank by then could only whiny, snuffle, or snort to express any vocal sort of communication. His bold ejaculation felt similar to what came when a Jack donkey masturbating. Hank whinnied a sense of equine glee, as obviously having done what he did three or four times daily when a donkey. As down deep he knew the devil Familiar was working had to captivate Hank back to preferring living equine a lifestyle.<br />
<br />
Slowly the flow of pony spunk dwindled to a trickle.</p>
