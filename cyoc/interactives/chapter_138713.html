<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vect was first to awaken among the group, much to his suprise. With the injuries he sustained yesterday, he thought he might be out cold. Taking in his surroundings,  Vect saw that at some point in the night Sara had rolled closer to him and her tail was curled around his thigh. Glancing over to where Jack and Lelu were sleeping he saw they had shifted right next to each other in their sleep and had their arms around each other. Moving as carefully as possible, Vect pulled Sara&#39;s tail from around his leg and stood up. He felt his chest give him some discomfort as he flexed some and brought his hand up to where he had been hit. Expecting to feel at least a scab over his orc, Vect was surprised to find only 6 scars where the claw hit. Running his fingers over the tissue his eyes drifted over to Sara&#39;s sleeping body and saw that her breast was completely free of any markings she had gained from the healing ritual from yesterday, as was Jack and Lelu.  By now the totems that they were given had begun to lose their power and the cold was hitting them pretty hard. Vect&#39;s nipples stood at attention. Instead all the injuries they had suffered from their battle were healed and left only scars for the deepest ones. &#39;What? How can we heal overnight,&#39; asked Vect silently and turned toward where the kill from yesterday was laying.<br />
<br />
Instead of the bear&#39;s body laying there, Vect saw it completely skinned and the fur laying in a bear pile in front of it. The head had been. Removed and stripped of all fur and flesh leaving a bare skull next to the pile of furs. The rest of the body was stripped of all but the skeleton as well. A note lay on top of the furs. <br />
<br />
Kneeling down, but looking everywhere for any sigh of movement, Vect used one hand to shake Sara awake.<br />
As Sara opened her eyes slowly to Vect&#39;s gentle shaking, she rolled over and saw Vect&#39;s package inches from her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vect what are you d-mmmm,&quot; Sara started until Vect covered her mouth with one hand, still looking around trying to find something hiding. Sara looked back to Vect&#39;s package and felt her body grow hot from arousal.  She knew she should be alert and help Vect search, but something inside her was focusing all her attention at the member in front of her. She felt her own member begin to harden and she began to get wet. It wasn&#39;t until Vect looked down and saw her staring intently at him that he realized how close he was to her and shifted his body to one side and use his leg to shield it from her view that Sara snapped out of her trance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Someone skinned the bear last night,&quot; Vect indicated furs. &quot;Go wake Jack and Lelu. I&#39;ll see what the note says.&quot;<br />
Sara crept over to Jack and Lelu, and awakened them. They were more than surprised to see each other in their arms, and even more so that Jack&#39;s dick was sandwiched between them. As they rapidly untangled themselves, Vect opened the note and began to read aloud:<br />
<br />
&quot;Your performance during the initiation trial was exemplary. It has been some time since we&#39;ve seen a kill this spectacular, even Gorg was impressed. I took the liberty of healing your wounds and had the observers finish what you started and prepared the clothing for you. We look forward to seeing you at camp.<br />
- Gratz, Shaman and druid&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We impressed them,&quot; Jack asked dubiously. &quot;We barely survived.&quot;<br />
&quot;We still brought it down in the end,&quot; chimed in Lelu. &quot;I&#39;m glad they prepared the fur for us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Before we head back there is something I want to do,&quot; said Vect as he took some thin strands of leather from the pile of clothing and walked over to the dire bear skeleton. When he finished, Vect gave them each a spike from the bear he had turned into a necklace. &quot;A trophy for our achievement,&quot; he explained.<br />
Jack hesitated when offered his, but took it anyway. As they dressed they saw the clothing was made like a fur dress bottom with a slip up the right side for mobility to cover their legs, with a vest for their torsos. The vest had used bone fragments tied to the front as makeshift buttons to fasten it in place. No shoes were present, which was fine for them, as they had gotten used to traveling barefoot, Vect even seemed to enjoy it. After a week of being nude, Sara found wearing clothes strange. Not quite uncomfortable, but somewhat restricting even though the furs offered no limitation on movement. <br />
&quot;Damn succubus blood,&quot; muttered Sara as she readjusted the vest leaving the top 2 fasteners undone due to it not being the right size on her giving a good view of her cleavage. Vect and Jack had to forgo the fasteners completely as their torsos were too big, especially Jack.  Lelu was the only one to close her vest completely. <br />
<br />
They started to walk back, but the idea of getting back to the Camp was so thrilling they all began to run faster and faster, Jack holding the skull in his hands. They reached the BTC much faster than they had left it and were still full of energy as they slowed to a walking pace upon entering the outer area of the camp. <br />
<br />
As they reached the center they were grabbed by many of the other trainees and held up above them in celebration.  Confused as to why they were given this welcome, they saw a giant green orb floating in the center of camp. On it a replay of their fight was shown to all.<br />
&quot;You gave us a good show newbloods,&quot; rumbled the giant orc from last time. &quot;You are deemed worthy of training here as the top ranked trainees for your mastery of defeating a dire bear.&quot; Some of the students grumbled at their drop in ranking, but most were overjoyed to have seen the fight.<br />
&quot;We held a vote among all those here on if we should heal you and finish your clothes,&quot; spoke up the hobbit, Gratz must have been him. &quot;3/4 agreed to it, even Gorg here,&quot; he said happily as he patted the large orc&#39;s leg.  Gorg shrugged, &quot;you did what some seasoned fighters couldn&#39;t do. You deserved some praise, especially the berzerker you had hidden.&quot; Lelu was astonished to be getting any sort of praise directed at her here.<br />
&quot;Now let the feast begin,&quot; roared Gorg as some drums began to beat.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to be a fun year I think,&quot; said Sara as she gladly accepted a mug of soft ale and joined the celebrations.</p>
