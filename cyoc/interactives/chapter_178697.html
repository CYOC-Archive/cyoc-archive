<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let&#39;s begin with you.&quot; Ben said as he grabbed a small and thin boy who was hiding behind Richard. He had messy brown hair, blue eyes and pale skin. He looked like a typical skater kid. Ben held it by his torso as he typed on his phone. He didn&#39;t even care what was the kid&#39;s name. <br />
<br />
Ben finished typing and clicked &#39;Apply&#39; as he got up. He had adjusted the program for a fast transformation. It wasn&#39;t instant because he thinks it will be fun to watch. Ben put the kid in a glass just in time to watch him reel as the wave of sensation overtook his tiny body. As he tried to clear his head, the changes began.<br />
<br />
His height began to increase, pushing him upward slowly but constantly. At the same time his body began to broaden, his torso and hips staying roughly the same boyish proportions then diverging, his waist staying relatively small while his shoulders continued to widen leaving him with a dramatic v-taper. If he wasn&#39;t doll size, his stature would be that of a prime male specimen, but he still retained his baby fat and boyish face.<br />
<br />
Ben was really enjoying this despite Richard and the other bullies were terrified of what they&#39;re seeing. Everything was happening so fast! Before his body had stopped growing, The boy&#39;s face and body had begun maturing quickly, moving through puberty at lightening speed.<br />
<br />
His jawline defined and became angular. His cheekbones developed as his face took on a masculine, chiseled look. At the same time, his former thin bod sprouted muscles. Broad, square pecs popped out of his chest while ridges of abdominal muscle were cleaved from his midsection. His legs grew thick, heavy muscles on their long bones and these, in contrast to his narrow waist, completed the athletic frame that Ben expected to see.<br />
<br />
Thick dark brown hair began to sprout all over the young man&#39;s developing body. His pubes pushed out first -- a super-thick bush of hair that was significantly larger and more noticeable than Ben had expected. Out of this, a dark, silky treasure trail shot up the thick abs to his pecs fanned out into short, flat swirls that set off the athletic pecs perfectly. The same dark hair had quickly crept up his thick legs and arms, and dense dark patches had even grown in his deep pits.<br />
<br />
The hair growth on the young man&#39;s legs continued up in back to cover what was fast becoming a pretty big bubble butt. Ben grinned as he remembered his ex boyfriend&#39;s butt that catches every guys&#39; eyes. This kid is going to get a bod that guys could be following down the street and flinging themselves at!<br />
<br />
The development was continuing in front as well. The guy&#39;s package was growing bigger by the second. Ben realized that he may have overdone it a bit there, but he always had dreamed of abnormally big cocks – so why can&#39;t he have some extra fun by giving the kid a big equipment to match his big bod? He watched the young man&#39;s cock and balls swell up huge. If we wasn&#39;t doll sized, his cock would easily pop the tape at 10 thick inches, and the balls would look like two billiard balls in their low-hanging scrotum.<br />
<br />
Preoccupied with the growth of the boy’s genitals, Ben modified a little his transformation so he would get more and more muscular as well. The smooth athletic physique was quickly giving way to a more beefy one. The boy&#39;s arms and pecs bulged and thickened while his abs tightened into rounded bricks. His legs swelled and widened and finally his back exploded with huge lats that gave his v-taper an even more exaggerated appearance.<br />
<br />
Ben was satisfied, his first victim was getting a bodybuilder body just like he wanted. The boy&#39;s body has buffed out so much that he now resembles a tiny action figure. His entire body looked manly and powerful and the thick arms, pecs and thighs, the tiny waist and rippled abs all combined to make him one hunky stud!<br />
<br />
Soon, the program had run its course. Ben watched the guy closely as he shook his head and gained his balance. Ben has programmed him to completely forget that he had been a kid a moment ago. Moreover, Ben had re-programmed him completely to make him think he&#39;s a tiny toy slave. Ben had even programmed him to forget his friends and his family. He wanted to keep him for a while. Finally, The young man’s new sexy, deep voice said &quot;Whoa, man. I feel so weird. But... Hey… do you want to play with me? Or do you want me to play for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. That sounds lovely but I want to bring more toys before we start to play!&quot; Ben smiled as he realized his reprogramming had worked. He watched as the former boy started to pose for him, flexing and showing off his newly buffed muscles. Ban glanced at the other kids who seemed truly terrified after watching what happened to his friend. &quot;Now you know what your future holds for you.&quot; Ben smiled. &quot;Who wants to join his friend as a real life action figure?!&quot;</p>
