<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For an adorable young girl of 5 years old, Amy as Jeff’s sister could never fathom the powers that the Chronivac wielded in its entirety. As said before, time could not be unwound or undone… But it could always be transferred from one area to another, in some cases, such a result would be even better than the original outcome. So, as Jeff had created a rift where his father once was by transforming John into Anita, the Chronivac, and by extension, the universe required something to take up the missing components and time that was taken away from John in reference to filling the void Jeff created to please himself.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac hastily created its reality warping instructions, the most suitable replacement for the former patriarch of the Kendrick family had some very… “unique” characteristics of the former’s makeup, and those traits it would indeed recreate in the product… But the term “replacement” did not always meaning simply transplanting a carbon copy in its place. No, instead, the Chronivac would <I>redesign</I> the necessary traits of the patriarch and their accompanying subject.<br />
<br />
Amy hummed to herself as she continued doing her math homework on her bed, as John had begun to feel the effects of the Chronivac while spending “quality” time with Jeff, Amy felt a shiver up her spine just as the blueprints of the perfect successor to John was being crafted by the machine. The first mandatory trait of the Kendrick patriarch was to be male, a simple task, if at all a chore. Amy instinctually shuffled from lying on her princess pink bedsheets, finding herself uncomfortable as a wave of warmth spread through her body. Her pigtails had loosened and the longer strands began to fade away as her hair thinned into her scalp and her lower body tingled. Feeling herself budge and move, Amy felt her stomach lurch as her body continued to stir, and as she sat up once more, she did not realize that her neck began to widen to match her changing shoulders. <br />
<br />
Amy whined as she heard her favorite pony t-shirt had stretched, the neck seams were beginning to tear as her back begun to broaden, the Chronivac made sure to articulate the next mandatory design trait: The new male patriarch must be strong, and in this scenario, strength was measured by a perfect body to suit a perfect replacement for John. Amy huffed, pulling the neck of her tightening t-shirt downwards, unaware that as her pudgy body had begun to grow, so too was her legs as they sprouted taller and longer. <br />
<br />
Her math homework was becoming fuzzy, while the familiar pink room and bedsheets were slowly fading into an entirely different place altogether. Amy groaned again, as she felt her thigh were aflame as something began to poke outwards and make its presence known to her. Attempting to shift her body comfortably, she grunted, a bulge was becoming more and more prominent in her neck as her voice lowered into an almost primal growl. Homework was not even on her mind, Amy was more concerned with this uncomfortable feeling as she felt her arms lengthen and her body adapt to the increasing amounts of testosterone that was being pumped into her. <br />
<br />
“I don’t feel so good…” <br />
<br />
Amy croaked, feeling her body tremble with heat, what was once supple, chubby arms had leaned out into lanky limbs, while her thighs had stretched to accommodate reaching the cereal box she vaguely remembered doing with ease. It wouldn’t be out of place to call her a growing teenager, though, as Amy whimpered, it was becoming easier to see she was becoming something more than a mere tween. Her broadening shoulders flared out, the seams of the pretty pony t-shirt straining to contain powerful trapezius muscles that had begun to temper her once plain neck. The seams came undone even easier as her lower back bulged tremendously, ripping the bottom sleeves as she felt her arms close in to the sheer mass now growing from within her.<br />
<br />
“I’m… I’m so…”<br />
<br />
The arm sleeves of the shirt extended, pushing towards the larger forearms before the material changed completely, the pony fading into a solid pink shirt. Amy continued to murmur to herself as the pink shirt toughened into an ironed dress up shirt, the buttons forming where the original design once was and invisible needles stitched and hemmed the shirt correctly. Amy huffed, lifting her neck up as she felt the collar swelling and nearly swallowing her neck before settling down and keeping her broadened neck leashed by its captivity. <br />
<br />
“But, I don’t <I>like</I> buttons…!” Amy complained, her neck swelling as a thicker lump began to form, voice becoming slightly darker in tone. As if on cue, she felt a pressure in her chest as its once shapeless mass lost its own blueprint and was replaced with the Chronivac. Amy’s chest pushed out, rippling sinew erupted from her canvas like body, the sheer width of the mass was enough to scatter two buttons from her pink shirt, the breast pocket forming just as her denim skirt parted and extended into denim pants. The once pastel pink room took on a more darker shade, a mauve, as Amy slowly slid off the bed. There was an unknown pressing need within her mind, something was calling out to her. Something very powerful, and something very indulgent.<br />
<br />
As the denim jeans slid over her legs, Amy felt her calves flare up, as if she had run through an entire marathon and her body was in overdrive as they bulked up, thighs thickening in proportion. Amy, or, Andy as she preferred to call herself, couldn’t shake the wooziness from her head, her hand flew to her forehead in an attempt to stabilize herself as her biceps grew in further. The strain of the pumped up musculature tore at the sleeves of the classy dress shirt, and to her ears’ disdain. She always hated when her shirts weren’t big enough to hold her up, she recalled, annoyed at having to have a tailor custom make her clothes growing up. That was right, the sound of tearing fabric was never a good sign for Andy, because it meant more kids making fun of them for their broad back or how hard it was to find a nice shirt like that.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac hummed as it began to complete the process, Andy feeling his crotch tingle as his new tool erupted from his nether regions, gasping as the heat tore at his mind and restraint to not immediately dig into his pants. &quot;Fuck..!&quot; He knew it wasn’t a good idea, someone could catch him, he chuckled once at the idea of Jeff, his… his brother, catching him. Andy grunted, feeling his newly blossomed cock throb harder and harder as blood flowed through and creating a well appreciated bulge in his pants. He recalled how in high school it wasn’t so hard to get a date with how much heat the “Kendrick” family gene was packing. He wasn’t called <b>“Long Schlong Kendrick”</b> for nothing, and as Andy wiped his forehead off of cold sweat, his denim jeans tightened over his waist. <br />
<br />
The material darkened, just as his previously lighter brunette hair as some slight subtle flecks of gray appeared, it occurred to him his old high school nickname followed him to college, as years of sports and high honors were fashioned by the Chronivac’s efforts. What was once queasiness became warmly invited thoughts of his… Girlfriend? …No, that wasn’t right, Andon didn’t have anyone, at least that he thought. Though, he couldn’t blame anyone for wanting to graze against him as he adjusted his shirt, the bulky pectorals were on full display as he felt the familiar itching of his body hair dusting across his body. A decent, trimmed amount found itself on his chest, and he grunted as he felt his jaw crunch and reshape from a soft rounder shape into a chiseled image of the replacement Kendrick patriarch the Chronivac deemed the perfect man to fill the void.<br />
<br />
 Andohn rubbed his mug, trying to think about the fading pain as he felt his stubble filling in the space of his chin and cheeks, conjoining with the sideburns that completed his beard altogether. Deep in thought, he closed his eyes as he tried to reach into his brain to understand what he was going through, dark colored eyes brightening and shifting to oceanic blue. His eyebrows furrowed, smirking as he remembered graduating college easily and beginning his new job, his darling wife was by his side, but… <br />
<br />
She soon faded from his memory as well as his brot… No, his son Jeff and… Chris? Those boys were all he had from his wife’s passing. He frowned, recalling the vague memories, but hissed as his nipples began to yearn for attention and his free hand flew to meet them, applying a tender caress. Andohn groaned, the shirt had tucked into the black jeans, just as a black leather belt had slid across his waist and buckled in… But immediately as his toughening hands groped his sizable chest Andohn’s hardened abdominals were forged as he felt himself up. Andohn gasped, his glutes bulging and bouncing as it amassed increasing amounts of muscle, the cheeks filling the space in the rear of his pants beautifully as they sloped against his vast thighs. Giving an audible slap, Andohn smirked, all the squats were paying off, and if there were any indication with how enlarged his quads were from years of practice, they&#39;d crack even a melon.<br />
<br />
The mauve background darkened even further, before contrasting into a modern gray, child’s dolls disappeared and furniture modernized to fit the successful patriarch the youngest Kendrick was being shaped into. The strong, confident replacement for the void had no need for childish posters of cartoons, or makeup kits, they were replaced with an extensive array of men’s products and Andohn chuckled as he gawked around and found his own reflection comforting. His forearms were graced with dark fur that enhanced his cultured image, the girlish bracelet that Amy once wore had become an expensive platinum watch, which was swiftly taken off and placed onto his mahogany dresser. He felt his mind waver watching his handsome reflection in the mirror, he wasn’t a college jock anymore, not since having his two boys, but, he loved staying in shape. <br />
<br />
And “shape” was an understatement as he hadn’t noticed how large his silhouette was that it wouldn’t <I>fit</I> in the mirror’s width. <br />
<br />
John chuckled, that was exactly what he was told by many people, it wasn’t gonna end soon enough, but boy was it worth it he thought. He patted his treasure before he trailed his thick hands across the buttons of the shirt, which had become unbuttoned and displayed his perfect body to the world. The Chronivac, acknowledging confidence would be necessary for the new Kendrick, had applied a dark spot on John’s skin, which had essentially traveled and streaked across his body: A pleasant tan that showed off the months of travel to luxurious resorts with his sons and frequent beach visits in only his tight speedos to the delight of many. John looked at himself and smirked cockily, bringing up his arms to a boisterous flex as he kissed his mountainous biceps. He was so fuckin’ beautiful. He knew it. Everyone knew it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck. Me.&quot; He cupped his pecs and triumphantly bounced them to his delight.<br />
<br />
Amy was no longer Amy anymore, in her place was the Chronivac’s version of what was needed to fill the void of what John had left behind: The need for a strong, confident, virile father who could support Jeff and Chris and even Anita if she so joins their family. He needed to be what John wasn’t, and that was an upgrade all in the same.<br />
<br />
John sighed, looking over at the nightstand that held a gleaming gold ring, and placed it onto his ring finger. He did miss his wife, of course, but he remembered in life one must keeping moving forward regardless of the circumstances. <br />
<br />
“Keep moving forward…” John murmured, smiling softly, before tearing off his dress shirt and locking his bedroom door. He had some work to do, and if there was any indication of his throbbing tool in an all too thin thong, he knew it would take some time before he went down to go see Jeff and his girlfriend Anita. Chris wasn’t home yet, and the dog was somewhere else. Far as he was concerned, John had all the time in the world, and all the more a canvas to slather with the bottle of oil in his drawer. The new Kendrick patriarch was created, but what else could happen now that he was even better than his predecessor..?</p>
