<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle sat for a while longer, hands messaging his massive perky breasts, enjoying the feeling a little, and thinking. The curse made it so that everyone, including himself, believed his body was the same as before, the call to Jarred had made that clear. So how could he make this work out? His mom thought that she was still her hot and curvy milf self, so cursing her would be a delicate situation, since he couldn&#39;t rid himself of the tall and busty amazon below his neck now, maybe he could word the curse to at least give her her body back. Maybe telling it to clone his busty body on her would work, but then she would think that her body wasn&#39;t like that before. Kyle shook his head, “I&#39;ll figure it out, she didn&#39;t deserve what Jen did to her, at least she can be a woman again.” <br />
<br />
Kyle got up, getting a slight sense of vertigo from his now seven foot height and walked over to the mirror that hung on the back of his door. He looked at himself and froze. “Damn.... this is.... really hot.” Kyle final took a minute to take in the beauty of the body he now possessed, slightly freaked out by hearing his mom&#39;s voice say that, and admired his Amazonian self. Turning to the side he looked at his chest, his breasts sitting large, round and proud, almost like a pair of implants with how impossibly round they were, looking down, all he saw was a massive valley of cleavage. It was now that his pussy started to stir, he ignored it, feeling a little turned off by the knowledge that it had once been the womb that birthed him. <br />
<br />
“Later girl, I just got you, I&#39;m not ready for that.” Kyle patted his crotch, he used to do that with his dick, so force of habit he thought. A light bulb clicked in his head, he now had his mother&#39;s voice, and he had always wanted to hear one of his fantasy lays seduce him, so he thought of something to say.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm, Kyle... you&#39;re so hawt, you wanna have some fun, he he he.” He put on his impression of the sexiest thing he could think of and recoiled, to him that was his mom wanting to fuck him. “Ohoho no! Don&#39;t do that again, hoof.” He shuddered, the feeling in his crotch having disappeared at this. <br />
<br />
“Well, this is me now.... permanently.... hot milf Kyle coming through.” He muttered, and walked out into the living room, sitting down on the couch, he decided to just relax, and found that his body now took up most of the couch, and left the luscious legs of his hanging over the arm. Kyle would stay there for most of the day as he thought of how to outsmart the curse, and just as his mother got home, he had an idea. <br />
<br />
His mom, wearing his body in drag, opened the door to their home, stepping into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Kyle honey! I&#39;m home!” She walked into the living room, “Oh good, are you feeling okay? You had me worried.” Kyle&#39;s mom was the sweetest woman he could think of, fawning over him and making sure everything was okay, it had been suffocating at times, but now he was glad for it.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m okay. Hey I want to ask you something. Do you know about the old town curse?”<br />
<br />
“OH! That old fairytale? Is that what this was about?”<br />
<br />
“Yeeah...” Kyle faked relief, “Someone called me this morning and gave me a curse, and I got really worried.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, well aren&#39;t you just silly. What was the curse? You&#39;d grow a second head or something?&#39; <br />
<br />
“Yeah, you could say that, it was weird, I can&#39;t really remember it completely, but can I curse you? Please?”<br />
She looked at him and rolled her eyes, “Okay, you&#39;re really seriously worried about this? Okay, you can curse me, and I&#39;ll pick both, just so you can feel better.” She chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Okay, Transform or Dare.” Kyle said. “This is it Kyle, last time your gonna use this curse for this, hope it doesn&#39;t fuck with you.” He thought.<br />
<br />
“I pick both.” She smiled and rolled her eyes again.<br />
<br />
“Okay... for your transformation, you&#39;ll gain a copy of my physical body, not the one you see, from the neck down. You clothes will change to fit that body, and you and everyone around you will believe that you&#39;ve always been like that. After you change and pass the curse back to me you&#39;ll forget that any conversation about the curse ever happened. For your dare...” Kyle took a deep breath. “You&#39;ll make it so that people can see the body that I physically have, but they&#39;ll still treat me like I&#39;ve always been like this, and you and everyone else won&#39;t think it&#39;s strange if I put on a bra.” Kyle finished and held his breath.<br />
<br />
“Really? I&#39;m going to be a teenage...” His mother was cut off as her chest expanded suddenly, her body filled out rapidly as her once male body became a copy of her seven foot self. “Kyle? What did that curse do to you?” She stared at him.<br />
<br />
“She had me swap bodies from the neck down with you, and made it so that no one would ever see that body, as well as making my clothes the same as before.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no... Honey, you can&#39;t...” She looked at him with pity.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s okay mom, I&#39;ll be fine, I tried to fix it and they made this permanent. I&#39;ll get used to it, could you just?”<br />
<br />
“OH! Sure...” She reluctantly started. “Transform or Dare.”<br />
<br />
“Transform.”<br />
<br />
His mom stared at him for a few minutes. “For your transformation, everyone will be able to see your current body, and treat you as the sex that goes with that body.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, that&#39;s!”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not finished, you won&#39;t be given any trouble about the clothing you wear, even if you stay a tomboy.” She finished and her eyes went blank, for a few minutes she stood there staring off into space. <br />
<br />
“Mom? Mom?” Kyle said, he felt his head get a little light as it evened out with his, now her magnificent body. “Kayle?” She stopped and shook her head. “I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s been a long day, I&#39;ll get dinner ready. And for goodness sake girl, put on a bra, these puppies...” She pointed at her own massive breasts, “Are nothing but trouble!&#39;<br />
<br />
“Tell me about it, but I didn&#39;t feel like a bra today, ya know, cause I stayed home.” <br />
<br />
“Speaking of that, are you feeling okay?” Her mom walked over and put her hand to her forehead.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I just wasn&#39;t feeling right this morning.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I&#39;ve had days like that, but hey, at least it&#39;s the weekend! You&#39;ve got a few days to get better. I&#39;ll get dinner started in a few minutes.” She sauntered off, Kayle watching her ass as she walked away, catching herself and then sighing, <br />
<br />
“You&#39;ve got one just like that Kayle.” She caught herself, realizing what she just called herself, and letting it roll around in her mind. “ She got up and walked back to her room, looking around her drawers she found that all of her clothing was still the same, a size too small for her, to show off her body, but still her old male self&#39;s taste, her underwear however was perfectly fitted for her luxurious curves, at least the curse had consideration for her comfort. She decided to take a shower, that would be a good start for getting accustomed to her body, all the while she thought about what she could do with that curse she held right now, Jen needed to pay for what she did.</p>
