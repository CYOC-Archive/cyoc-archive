<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>this was a lot longer than i thought it would be. to be honest. Lets all go nuts and add more to this story!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“It&#39;s about that item you sensed,” Josh spoke. “It can grant you your wish.” He blushed.<br />
<br />
Her eyes widened. “You&#39;re kidding.”<br />
<br />
Josh shook his head. “No, I am not. Let me grab it.” complying with his wish. Crystal let Josh go to the place that he hid the book. “Listen this book can alter reality.”<br />
<br />
“Bullshit,” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“That’s rich coming from a vampire. If you are a vampire then why would you call my words a lie?”<br />
<br />
“Because even if it is magic, nothing can just alter reality.” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
Josh rolled his eyes. “Well, I can prove it.”<br />
<br />
“How?”<br />
<br />
“Look around you. Why else would the world be this milky! All females would not make so much milk. Have nice and mega tits and us men wouldn’t also make milk in our balls.” Josh told her.<br />
<br />
“You humans was always like this!” She slapped his balls. He blushed as all the milk sloshed around. “And by extension we vampires grew into the same way because of your blood we feed off of.”<br />
<br />
“Wait you are only like this because of our blood.”<br />
<br />
“Yes. It’s why all vampires blend in with you humans.” She nodded.<br />
<br />
Josh decided to switch topics. “Back to the prove it. How about I make your dream come true?”<br />
<br />
“What?” Crystal said with disbelief.<br />
<br />
“I’ll turn you into a milkpire with the book.” Josh said.<br />
<br />
“Very funny.” Crystal rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
“It’s true just read what I wrote in the book!” Josh opened the book and shoved it in her face. Crystal just sighed and started to read over it.<br />
<br />
“Josh…. You just wrote it in here as if humans and vampires were never milky to begin with.” She closed the book to smack him on the head.<br />
<br />
“Ow!” Josh yelped. “What was that for!”<br />
<br />
“For not telling me what the book can actually do.”<br />
<br />
“That is! And I can prove it!”<br />
<br />
“How?” Crystal crossed her arms.<br />
<br />
“I’ll make your dream come true. I’ll make you a milkpire!” Josh told her with a huge smile.<br />
<br />
“A milk pire?” Crystal raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Well instead of blood like a vampire. It&#39;d be milk so you would be a Milkpire.” Josh explained.<br />
<br />
“But there is one thing I got to know.” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“Yes?” Josh asked.<br />
<br />
“What if you change me and I don’t notice then I might want to be turned back.” Crystal told him. “And no. I still don’t believe you about the book. But if it&#39;s true then I’d rather have you consider that.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll make you aware of it.” Josh nodded. He pulled out a pen. “Let me write it all out.” Crystal sat down on the floor and leaned against his balls.<br />
<br />
<em>Crystal is currently the only Milkpire in existence. As a milkpire, she needs human breast milk or nut milk to feed on to live instead of a vampire that needs blood.<br />
<br />
Crystal is aware of being turned from a vampire into a Milkpire. In her case, my milk is the sweetest and silkiest that she&#39;ll every taste and be her favorite.</em><br />
<br />
Once he stopped writing the text flowed gold. Once it stopped he closed the book. “There do you feel any different?” Josh turned to loom at Crystal. Her eyes widened as she reached up to take out her contacts. She looked at him in the eyes. Right then he saw what was different about them. Her iris was a milky white. A breast milk white or nut milk.<br />
<br />
“That tickled,” She slowly spoke. “I felt my body change…” She smiled. “Thank you, Josh.”<br />
<br />
Josh only smiled at her. “Your welcome.”<br />
<br />
“Although I am very hungry.” She grinned at Josh who paled. “I need a drink~” She sung as she stood up to move over to his cock. She zipped down his pants.<br />
<br />
“Hey what are you doing?!” Josh cried in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Getting your hard rod out.” She said. “I want to drink my friend’s milk for the first time!~” She smiled.<br />
<br />
He gulped, “W-well... I-I guess…” He let her pull his underwear down for her to reach out to gently grabbed his dick. Letting out her fangs, he shuttered but when she bit his dick. She bit the top. It was not hard or a pinch. Felt more like she was sucking on it.<br />
<br />
She hummed as her fangs sucked out the ball milk that was being produced from his nut boobs. Bliss, pure bliss shot through his body. It stirred in his balls and then made his hard rod get hot. But then… it traveled into his legs. Making them go weak. <br />
<br />
She gulped down his milk, filling her belly So much that it started to push her clothes out. Her face blushed hard as she felt her belly force her shirt up. She then pulled her head back a bit. Stroking her boyfriend&#39;s cock with her lips.<br />
<br />
Even more bliss shot through his dick and into his balls. <em>‘I can&#39;t hold it!’</em> Josh mentally cried before he shot out gallons of milk into her fangs. Somehow her fangs were able shuck in most of the milk and sent it coursing through her veins. While the rest shot down into her belly making it look like a 9-month year old pregnant belly.<br />
<br />
She took one hand to reach down and stroke her belly as she felt it swell with milk. Her boyfriend’s breast nut milk! With her closed eyes she sucked harder on his rode. Her hand got forced down and out of the way as she felt the floor by her belly. Quickly she felt her body getting raised up by her belly which grew past a yoga ball at this point. <em>‘No… I need more. More! MORE!~’</em> She thought in pure lust as the belly started to break past the 4 foot mark and reached the 5ft mark. Only then did she release her fangs. With lust in her eyes she starred at the panting Josh.<br />
<br />
“Fuck!~” She moaned. “Your milk is way too good!~” She smiled. “I love it!~”<br />
<br />
Josh just nodded slowly. “You… sucked me… hard.” He looked at his dick that had two holes on the tip. Then before his eyes they closed. A sloshing was heard as Crystal stop up with her hyper belly. He looked at her blushing face. “Damn that took a lot.. out of me.” <br />
<br />
She nodded. “I hope we can do that again~ But this milk.” She hiccupped while she rubbed her belly. “Will last me a full week!~”<br />
<br />
Still recovering Josh asked. “A-a w-week?”<br />
<br />
Crystal slowly stepped over to him and smiled. “Yeah. And thank you for my first meal~”<br />
<br />
“heh eh.” Josh weakly laugh. “Your wel-welcome.”<br />
<br />
“Now… back to what we chatted about before.” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“Huh? Wait the bonding?” Josh asked.<br />
<br />
She nodded. “Yes. I want to use that book to do it.” She told him. “that way we can make a very personal one. A unique bond that perfectly fits us.”<br />
<br />
Slowly Josh nodded and laughed. “I see… well I guess we can.”<br />
<br />
Crystal smirked as he stood up. “So shall we get it started?”</p>
