<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“...porn stars. I wonder which ones they have for the simulation?” Jeff asked, more to himself out loud than to me. We both checked the boxes and at 9:00am the specialist came to retrieve the paperwork. He went through it all with us, affirmed our choice, and that was that. It would take roughly 45-50 minutes to get everything set up, at which point they would call us back to start our mini vacation. I took Jeff’s hand in mine and squeezed. <br />
<br />
“Hey, don’t worry. I’m sure this is all super safe. We have nothing to worry about, and we get to experience a whole different life for a few days.” Jeff said, noticing I was still nervous about the whole thing.<br />
<br />
“I know, you’re right. I’m just overthinking it.” I replied, looking into his eyes. We talked through who we thought the simulation would place us as right up until the specialist re-entered the lobby and beckoned us to the back. He sat us down in fully reclining medical chairs while he explained the process. Attendants attached electrodes to various parts of our heads and bodies while the specialist readied the machines. It was a full headpiece with a disconcerting number of wires attached. First he affixed the headpiece to Jeff, then he put mine on.<br />
<br />
“Alright gentlemen. I’ll activate the program in a minute. When I do, all you have to do is close your eyes, focus on your breathing, and start counting backwards from 100. You will feel like you’re falling asleep, and when you ‘wake up’” He used finger quotes, “you’ll be in your new temporary bodies. Any final questions?” Both Jeff and I shook our heads no. “Great!” He walked to his desktop computer. “There we go! You’re all set. Just close your eyes....” We did. “Starting counting back from 100...”<br />
<br />
“100... 99... 98...97... 96...”<br />
<br />
“And have a great time! These guys are a lot of fun.” The specialist said. It was the last thing I heard before I slipped under.<br />
<br />
When I came to, I found myself in a lavish yet modern bathroom. I felt groggy, and my vision was blurry, though it was quickly clearing. I was facing large mirror. The reflection in the mirror, staring quite intently back at me, wore nothing but a pair of stark white briefs that contrasted nicely with his dark brown skin. The stranger in the mirror was thickly muscled. He had smooth skin and he was completely bald. He was leaning in to the reflection, both hands resting on a granite countertop. I realized he could feel the granite under my fingers, but I was unable to move them.<br />
<br />
“Wha... what’s...” I  tried to stammer, but found I wasn’t speaking out loud.<br />
<br />
The reflection smirked. “First time?” He asked.<br />
“Where... where am I?” I thought. “Who are you?” As I thought these questions, I noticed that the reflection in the mirror was alone in the room, and I remembered how I had got here. “Wait... whoa. Am I you?”<br />
<br />
The reflection laughed, showing a set of perfect white teeth. “Aha! You’ve got it. Welcome to your Ride Along!”<br />
<br />
“Wow. This simulation is amazing! I didn’t expect to have a conversation with myself. Is this like an orientation to the program?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s not a simulation...” the man said, but was cut off.<br />
<br />
“This tech is amazing.” I interrupted. “I could swear I’m feeling the granite. But why can’t I move?”<br />
<br />
“Here, I’ll explain. The first time always take a bit of getting used to. They’re still telling people it’s a simulation then?” The stranger in the mirror asked.<br />
<br />
“Uh... yeah...?” I replied.<br />
<br />
“It’s easier that way. Most people wouldn’t believe what’s actually going on until they experience it. This is 100% real. Your body is in a stasis back in the lab and your consciousness is here with me. I’m Chris by the way.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, hi. I’m Ben.” I stammered. <br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you Ben!” Chris said, his hand groping his stiffening dick through his briefs in a makeshift handshake.<br />
<br />
“Oh God, I felt that. This is amazing, but how is this possible?” I exclaimed in Chris’ head.<br />
<br />
Chris chuckled. “You know, they explained the tech behind it when we signed up to be hosts, but most of it went over my head. Basically, my man and I got the call from the agency about an hour ago that some guys wanted to live like porn stars for the weekend. We were available so we gave the go ahead. He and I will get a nice chunk of change, or credits at the agency in case we want our own weekend in a Ride Along. From there, I just had to make sure I was wearing this bracelet at the specified time so they could transfer your consciousness into me.” Chris said, unfastening the bracelet and setting it on the counter. “I like to do it front of a mirror so when the guy comes to he gets a real nice view of the body he’ll be in. My man on the other hand likes to make sure he’s fully hard and stroking himself when the guy comes to, so that’s probably what your man is experiencing right now. Anyway, it looks like you guys will have the full weekend with us. We’ll put the bracelets back on at the end of your time period, and they’ll suck you guys right out of us and put you back in your bodies.”<br />
<br />
“Well, Chris. You seem like a really nice guy, and your body is amazing. I’m definitely looking forward to watching your life for the next couple of days. Thank you for hosting us!” I exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Hey man, you’re welcome. It’s fun for us too. Maybe by the end of the weekend we’ll convince you to host my man and I for a weekend” Chris said with a wink.<br />
<br />
“Oh I don’t know. Our lives are probably pretty boring compared to yours. Would you really want to watch us all weekend?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“There’s more to it than just watching. It’s your first time, so I’ll be driving longer than normal. Once you’re comfortable though, I can let you take control and then I’m just watching what you do with my body.” Chris said.<br />
<br />
“No way...” I whispered.<br />
<br />
“Yup. Some of the more advanced clients have the option of a complete swap. If that were the case this body would be yours for the weekend and my man and I would be walking out of the lab in your bodies right about now. We’ve done it a couple of times, but I prefer it like this. We’re gonna get to know each other real well this weekend.” Chris said, smirking. “Plus, there’s another reason I’ll be driving most of today. My man and I have a scene we’re filming this afternoon. We’re gonna treat you guys to front row seats of the filming of a porno. It’s a threesome by the way, have you ever been spit-roasted?”<br />
<br />
 “Uh, no. I’m mostly a top.” I stammered in shock.<br />
<br />
“Well, you’re completely versatile this weekend, and from the script I read we’re gonna be spit roasting and spit roasted. Don’t worry though, I’ve had total tops Ride Along before and they’ve told me they can’t believe how good it feels to take a dick in my body” Chris replied matter of factly.<br />
<br />
“That would explain what I assume is a giant butt plug in your hole” I said.<br />
<br />
Chris laughed. “Yeah, the studio prefers if we come ‘pre-stretched’” Chris used air quotes, “Anyway, after the shoot my man and I have dinner plans, so you’ll both mostly be riding along for the rest of today. We both have tomorrow off, so you and your boyfriend can have practically the whole day driving our bodies if you’d like.” Chris said.<br />
<br />
 “That would be great!” I exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“All part of the package you guys paid for man, plus it’s a little bonus for us.” Chris said.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, I don’t know if the developers of the tech built this in or are even aware of it, but I can also shift my consciousness or yours to, erm, other parts of my body.” Chris said.<br />
<br />
“Okay...” I trailed off, not fully understanding where this was going.<br />
<br />
“So, at some point or points tomorrow while you’re fucking my man’s body, I’ll shift down into my cock. He will probably do it do while your boyfriend is fucking my body.” Chris said.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow. Um, okay...” I stammered, a bit shocked by the idea.<br />
“Hey man, it’s intense. I lose my sight, hearing, and taste, but I can still think and feel. The pleasure you experience as just a dick while you’re in a nice warm hole or in someone’s mouth, it’s unreal. And the orgasm, my God. Plus, once you’re comfortable driving I might just switch down to my dick to take a nap in my briefs. It’s super comfy down there.” Chris said. By this point his dick was fully erect in his tight white briefs.<br />
<br />
“I think... I think I’ll take your word for it.” I replied.<br />
<br />
“No way man. You have to experience it at least once. Hey, actually, you could now.”  Chris said.<br />
<br />
“What?!” I exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, my man and I are going to suck each other off before we get ready to head out. Don’t want to be firing off our first load of the day on set, you know?” Chris explained.<br />
<br />
“Well, yeah. Makes sense.” I said.<br />
<br />
“So how about it? Your first orgasm of the weekend as my dick?” Chris asked with a gleam in his eye.<br />
<br />
“Uh, no. I’ll take a regular orgasm, thanks. This is already a lot to take in.” I reasoned.<br />
“Suit yourself. I’ll have you between my legs at some point before the weekend is over.” Chris said, winking to his reflection. “Now, let’s go meet each other’s’ boyfriends.” Chris turned away from the mirror and walked toward the entrance to the bedroom, his fully erect cock bobbing along in his briefs.<br />
<br />
Chris did a quick scan of the oversized bedroom giving Ben a tour of sorts. “This is where you’ll be staying for the weekend.” He said, walking around. “Over there is a walk-closet, we have a 52” 4K LED TV over here... though I doubt you’ll be watching much TV” Chris snickered before turning to the bed. “And over here is our California King bed,” and fixating his gaze on the man in the bed, “and that would be my king, Trent.”<br />
<br />
Even in thought I stumbled over my own words. Even laying down I could tell Trent was a tall man. Tall and thick. He didn&#39;t have the visible abs that Chris did, but that&#39;s not to say he was out of shape, far from it. His arms, chest, thighs, even his calves were the most muscular I had ever seen in person. I imagined what his ass must look like, and Chris chuckled in my head. He had approached the bed while I took in the sight before him/me. Trent&#39;s skin was a shade lighter than Chris, and he had a trace amount of visible hair on his head. His jaw was square, he was clean shaven, and when he locked eyes with Chris and I saw his shockingly blue eyes I swooned.<br />
<br />
Chris was on the bed, on all fours, making his way toward Trent. “I think he likes you babe” Chris said. He leaned in for a kiss and I felt Trent’s lips.<br />
<br />
Trent leaned back. “Yeah babe, my guy likes you too. Especially...” he said, trailing off as he glanced at Chris’ cock still encased in tight white cotton. I mentally rolled my eyes.<br />
<br />
Chris laughed. “That’s right, you got the bottom. Well, I told my guy my we’re versatile and that he would get plenty of chances this weekend to experience the joy of taking some good dick.” Chris was slipping out of his briefs. Trent was still completely hard. <br />
<br />
“Jesus, I hope what I experience is ‘joy’ with that monster” I thought. Chris laughed. <br />
<br />
“Shall we?” Chris said with a smirk, eyeing Trent’s cock, “we should get going soon.”<br />
<br />
“Babe! Where are your manners! We should at least introduce ourselves first, don’t you think? We don’t wanna be crass.” Trent said.<br />
<br />
“Ha, you’re right. Ben, I would like to introduce you to my man Trent” Chris said, reaching out to grab Trent by the dick.<br />
<br />
“Oooh. And Jeff, this is my man Chris.” Trent said, returning the gesture as he wrapped his hand around Chris’s dick. They both did a sort of stroking, handshaking gesture, and I moaned in Chris’ head.<br />
<br />
“Tell him it’s a pleasure” I thought at Chris. <br />
<br />
“He knows” Chris thought back at me before he leaned down to place his lips on Trent’s. The two men continued to softly stroke each other’s erect cocks while they kissed. Chris’ external moans coupled with my internal ones must have made quite the cacophony for him. It wasn’t long before I felt Chris leaking, and felt Trent’s precum on Chris’ hand. They broke the kiss, looking into each other’s’ eyes. Chris kissed Trent’s nose, then repositioned himself on the bed so that he could take Trent’s cock into his mouth and Trent could do the same.<br />
<br />
“Hold on a sec babe” Trent said. Chris and Ben saw Trent close his eyes, as if concentrating, before opening them a moment later and smiling at Chris. “Cool. All set” he said.<br />
<br />
I almost had the chance to ask Chris what that was about before I felt Trent’s lips wrap around Chris’ cock. I moaned again as Chris wrapped his lips around Trent’s. Chris slipped his tongue into Trent’s foreskin, pushing it back and exposing the head. Trent paused his sucking and groaned around the cock in his mouth. I must have yelled out a bit loud in Chris’ head when Trent did the same.<br />
<br />
“I’m guessing you’re cut back home, huh?” He chuckled at me.<br />
<br />
“Uhh, ohh, yeah. Yeah, I am.” I panted. Trent was lightly touching Chris’ balls while he ran his tongue around the head of the most sensitive penis I had ever experienced.<br />
<br />
“Man oh man. This is gonna be a great weekend for you.” Chris thought at me. He withdrew Trent’s dick from his mouth to deeply inhale. “Sorry, we’ll definitely draw this out much longer later, but right now we have to get ready to go soon or we’ll be late.&quot; He thought at me. With that he opened wide and took the entirety of Trent’s cock into his mouth and throat in one fluid motion. I was pretty good at deep throating, but nothing like this, especially with a dick the size of Trent’s. I could feel the fullness in Chris’ throat. I was amazed to feel the muscles in Chris’ throat milking Trent while having no control over the action. I could smell the sweaty musk between Trent’s legs with Chris’ nose nestled into his sack. Then I felt Trent deep throat Chris in the same fluid motion and I almost passed out. These guys must really be in love, I thought to myself, knowing exactly how to give each other pleasure like this. I could feel Chris’ orgasm coming on strong, and I felt Trent gushing pre down Chris’ throat. The orgasm was nearly blinding. I felt more cum leave Chris’ balls than I could produce even after a couple of days of holding back ejaculating; just the same as I felt spurt after spurt hit the back of Chris’ throat. I thought of Jeff, thinking he must be feeling the same astounding pleasure I was and made sure to thank him for convincing me to do this the first chance I got.</p>
