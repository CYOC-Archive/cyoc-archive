<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wah?&quot; he mumbled. With eyes closed, Andrew reached over and turned of his buzzing alarm He hit the big snooze button and silence. Why was it on? He wondered? And then he remembered that in a fit of excitement Andrew had set his clock to as early as possible.  He breathed a sigh of relief after the annoying noise was silenced. But as he shifted his weight and moved his arm around he noticed something different. He felt bigger, like he was heavier. Hair rubbed against his neck, and he felt his hair rubbing against his blanket. His eyes were still closed and he was still half asleep, but the moment he realized what was going on he opened his eyes just a little. He looked down slowly, and his jaw dropped. <br />
<br />
A Beard! Not huge, but big all right, his vision was still a hazy, but it looked like it was maybe even bigger than his dad's. The dark hair restricted his view as he lay down. He could even feel the hairs move as he opened in mouth in awe. &quot;holy...&quot; he mumbled. He moved his arms around, and felt additional size, more weight on them, and he could even feel the hair under his arms against his skin. Suddenly Andrew remembered the events of last night and it occurred to him that he must of changed. But he wanted to know how much hair he had on him. A smile spread across his face. He wanted to know what had happened to his body, but he was too tired to As he shifted his weight again and tugged on the blanket he could distinctly feel hair on his chest rubbing against his skin as he moved his comforter around. Andrew was thrilled. <br />
<br />
He started to move again. He was so tired, but so excited to see what had happened to him. He moved his arms up, turned his head to see them, and even though his eyes were still half way closed<br />
They DID look bigger, he could tell. Not huge, but much thicker than normal. Andrew stretched a little in bed and then grabbed the blanket and removed it. <br />
<br />
He felt the heat of his bed vanish; He closed his eyes, waiting to see what happened to him. As he tried to sit up, he noticed it took more effort than he had assumed. He was heavier all right. But how much heavier? Andrew finally sat up, and felt bigger. He didn’t know how much, but there was now definitely more on his frame. <br />
<br />
Andrew moved his legs over the edge of the bed and let them hang for a second, finally he opened his eyes and looked down.<br />
<br />
Although his beard was obstructing his view, Andrew noticed a thick patch of hair on two big pecs below him. He was thrilled. He moved more, and sat up straight, closed his eyes again and allowed his hands to start moving over his shirtless torso. <br />
<br />
He was pretty hairy, his chest was covered in coarse hair, and his pecs had grown large and round. Unexpectedly round. Andrew Finally stood up. The floor creaked a bit as he stood up from the bed. 'Man' the thought 'it really worked, i must be pretty big'.<br />
<br />
Andrew could tell he wasn’t huge. His body  was bigger but not freakishly so. His arms were thicker, he turned his head, once again he opened his eyes, he extended his right arm and flexed. It felt good. And it looked even better. A big mound of muscle grew when he flexed his right bicep. <br />
<br />
&quot;whoa... &quot; Andrew mumbled. He still felt so groggy. He turned and began to walk, and as he did so he could feel the weight on his feet. Not only that- but his boxers, normally roomy, felt snug. He dragged his feet in front of his mirror on the wall. <br />
<br />
Opening his eyes he saw this big, shirtless guy in front of him. He didn’t even recognize his own body, or even his face. His face had this big old beard on it, and he looked like a completely different person, much older, like a real man. His body had become thick and hairy, not unlike his fathers. His stomach wasn’t ripped at all, and he had formed a little gut that stuck out a little over the waistband of his boxers, but it was covered in brown hair. He was wider there too, and had grown love handles, but that was no matter, his arms were thick and muscular. “Holy shit!” he cried. He couldn’t believe it had been so easy to gain so much mass. ‘I must be dreaming’ he thought, but it was way too real. He had literally gone from scrawny, 140-pound kid to this big, hairy guy overnight. <br />
<br />
He turned to his side to look at his arms in the mirror. They had grown alright, not massive, no, but certainly muscular. He seemed bigger everywhere, his legs felt enormous, and most important, his manhood. <br />
<br />
Andrew reached into his boxers to examine himself. Indeed, he felt big downstairs. He couldn’t tell if he was huge or not,  but as he grabbed himself, he noticed his hand didn’t reach as far around as normal. He had grown there too. ‘How big?’ he wondered. He noticed then, that he didn’t have that typical morning wood. Nope, he was completely soft. “Damn!” he cried enthusiastically. <br />
<br />
Andrew couldn’t get over his transformation. A thick patch of hair on his chest, a full beard, big muscles. What more could he possibly want? It was so strange to him, walking around, he was a new man, quite literally.  Andrew thought back, where were the jars? He looked around calmly, then he remember, he had put them safely away in the second drawer of the desk in front of him. <br />
<br />
He couldn’t wait to weigh himself. How much had he gained? By his estimation he looked to be about 200 pounds. Not huge, no, not even unusual. But to have gained so much so fast, that’s what made him feel so strange. Andrew walked down his open the door to his room, still, his head was still under the grip of sleepiness. He felt energetic, but his eyes wanted to close, his head wanted rest. His felt his weight in the steps he took. They weren’t very heavy, but it was more than his body was used to. <br />
<br />
He pushed on, though; into the bathroom Andrew couldn’t help but gawk at his reflection in the big mirror. That beard really made him look like a man…it was too weird. He stumbled over to the old scale. He was excited, even nervous to see his new weight. But then it hit him. What was he going to tell his father? His mother? People don’t just gain 60+ pounds over night. Maybe, he thought, he could hide it under baggy clothes? He didn’t know, but as he felt his chest he knew he wouldn’t be able to hide his transformation that well. Not only that, but his Beard! What was he going to do? He didn’t have a razor upstairs, as he didn’t shave. How would he rid himself of this? <br />
<br />
Andrew put these thoughts aside and stepped on the scale. He was so excited, how much has he gained? The little electric lights flashed for a second and then, the numbers appeared: 198.5 it read. <br />
<br />
“Whoa” he said under his breath. He really had grained 60 pounds. He wondered if he had grown too much. He turned back to the mirror with the reflection of the large man. He wondered if this size going to be a problem, that he was fat or something. His little hairy belly could attest to the added fat he had gained, but the overall sense was that he was pretty muscular. <br />
<br />
‘Bulky’ Andrew thought to himself ‘I’ve become somewhat bulky’. He knew he wasn’t the biggest guy he’d ever seen, but he didn’t know if he wanted to be this big either. It had felt so good, and still did, but he was having second thoughts as to the consequences of this. <br />
<br />
Then something caught his attention, he heard the TV on downstairs. “That’s odd, he thought, my Dad should be at work….” Andrew then a little nervous and confused, What if his dad saw him like this? Nevertheless, Andrew had his doubts about someone being home, after all his mom wasn’t going to be back for another week and this was a weekday, his dad probably just left the TV on or something. Andrew decided to look and see if his dad was home….  just to be careful.</p>
