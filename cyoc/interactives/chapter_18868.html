<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle, Gabe and Jen stood by the open double-doors of the gym, looking up at the bleachers full of hundreds of high school students. The school marching band was blasting out a poorly-tuned version of a recent pop song, and the students were, for the most part, ignoring the proceedings, as was customary at high school pep rallies. The song ended, and some scattered applause echoed in the rafters of the gymnasium. A banner displaying the rally slogan, TIME FOR A CHANGE, was hung over the door.<br />
&quot;That's our cue,&quot; said Jen, licking her lips in anticipation. Grabbing Gabe, she kissed him deeply, and he slid his hand up under her tight cheerleader's shirt to tease her nipple as he bit her lip. &quot;Cool down, alpha,&quot; gasped Jen. &quot;We have a job to do. Mustn't change now. Soon.&quot; Brushing up against him, she stroked him once surreptitiously through his pants, and then turned and bounced off to join the cheerleaders for their number.<br />
Gabe grabbed Kyle by the collar and looked straight into his eyes. The human could see flecks of gold in the werewolf's retinae and definite points to his canine teeth as he spoke, probably brought on by the arousal with Jen: &quot;Time for you to do your part, meat-boy.&quot; Kyle gasped and stammered, &quot;After this, you promise to ch... change me?&quot; &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Gabe, growling a little, deep in his throat. &quot;I promise. You won't be human by the end of the day, if I have anything to say about it. And as you know, I do. I'm saving my T.O.D.&quot; Kyle shivered at the thought of his transformation, later today, but something in Gabe's tone made him afraid. He had no choice but to obey, though. Quietly, Kyle slipped out of the rally into the empty hallway.<br />
The students stirred in their restless indifference as the cheerleaders took the stage, male students particularly interested in the counterpoint of their well-built bodies as they gyrated their hips and leaped through the air. Jen performed a triple flip which even the other cheerleaders couldn't help but be amazed at... never had her performance been so athletic, so wild, so impressive, or so sexual. The way she wiggled her ass onstage, it was almost as if she were thrusting herself upon a lover's tool. But, though difficult, Jen managed to cage her desires and the differences in her act were subtle enough that the principal and the twenty teachers present didn't put a stop to it, and yet sensual enough that most of the males and even some of the females in the auditorium were feeling warm. Finally, the other cheerleaders formed a pyramid, and she vaulted to the top effortlessly. The music ceased with a final thump as Jen spread her legs and arms, holding her pompoms high. Taking a deep breath, she yelled the fateful words into the hanging microphone above the stage: &quot;TRANSFORM OR DARE?&quot;<br />
The magical words entered the ears of everyone in the auditorium. Some thought they heard wrong and dismissed it... some merely laughed it off as nonsense. Only one out of the five hundred students present actually answered it: high in the bleachers, alone in the crowd, sat one lone girl, reading a book of fantasy. She had never had many... or even any... friends at the school, spending her days dreaming about distant worlds, about being other things. She would often walk alone in the forest, dreaming about being a wild animal and living a free, pure life. So it was that when the question came, although she thought it a joke, Ashley Wright quietly answered aloud, &quot;Transform,&quot; expressing her heart's wish, though she didn't expect it to matter at all.<br />
After confused applause for the cheerleader's skit, the cheerleaders left the stage, the rest of the squad giving Jen strange looks. Jen, for her part, blew the audience a kiss and ran off behind the stage to meet Gabe, where hidden from the eyes of the rest of the gym, they shared a few mooments of passionate groping while the principal announced, &quot;Next we have Gabriel, our student body president, performing an inspirational skit.&quot; Jen pushed Gabe off of her. &quot;It's time,&quot; she growled in a sultry voice. &quot;I can't wait to get out of this constraining clothing once and for all. Are we ready?&quot; Gabe looked over at the gymnasium doors, which were closed. Through the frosted glass, he could see brooms and mops thrust through the outside handles. Kyle had done his work... nobody had escaped during Jen's performance, and none would escape their fate now. Everyone in the auditorium was doomed.<br />
The lights went up on Gabe and Jen, both cuddling in a large sofa in the middle of the stage. &quot;Mmmm, I love you, Gabe,&quot; said Jen. <br />
&quot;I love you too, Jen,&quot; he answered, &quot;but don't you wish we could... you know... do what we want to?&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean, take off all our clothes and fuck like wolves in heat?&quot; she asked, slowly easing Gabe's shirt off of his body.<br />
&quot;Well, we can do that now... and we will,&quot; answered Gabe with a smile as he ripped the front of Jen's cheerleader uniform right down the middle. She hadn't, of course, worn a bra. Everyone was now watching in shocked silence. &quot;But, I mean... wouldn't it be nice to never have to wear clothes ever again? To fuck wherever we want to... in school, or in the woods, or while shopping downtown? Anywhere, anytime?&quot; By now, Jen had pulled his pants off of his body, one leg at a time, leaving him naked.<br />
&quot;Ooh,&quot; she cooed at the welcome sight of his member. &quot;Oh, yes, Gabe. That would be so cool! But how can we do that?&quot; she asked as Gabe viciously tore her cheerleading skirt in two, leaving her in her socks and shoes alone.<br />
&quot;We can do that if everyone thinks like we do. Let's show them, Jen, how wolves do it.&quot;<br />
Jen approached the front of the stage and got down on all fours as Gabe approached her from behind. Holding his penis at her entrance, he whispered into her ear, &quot;Do it,&quot; as he plunged into her. He could see the principal coming down the stairs from the back of the auditorium to put a stop to their performance. In seconds, it wouldn't matter.<br />
&quot;OH!&quot; cried Jen as the transformation seized her body, muscles quaking, fur beginning to spread, new breasts erupting down her chest. &quot;Every student... oh!&quot; she called into a nearby microphone, &quot;will transform into a werewolf... like... us! Oh!&quot; The students shuddered as they felt some kind of change rip through their innermost being. &quot;And for the dare... you will all know us as your ALPHAS!&quot; Immediately, every student in the auditorium felt their wills chained to the will of Gabe and Jen. All five hundred of them would do anything for their alphas, anything at all. All of them except one, the one who had chosen &quot;Transform&quot; alone. &quot;For the teachers and the principal,&quot; Jen said, displaying growing fangs and rubbing her nipples as she was taken from behind, &quot;I just dare you to keep completely silent.&quot;<br />
&quot;Change, now!&quot; roared the alpha male as his face pushed forward into a muzzle and his transformation into a rutting he-beast was completed. &quot;And become complete!&quot;<br />
The teachers were witness to the sudden, violent transormation of the entire student body. Girls screamed as their new teats swelled, ripping open their shirts, and boys yelled in pain and pleasure as their growing muscles slowly destroyed their clothing. Half-naked transforming teenagers, still clad in the rags of their humanity, stroked themselves wildly, encouraging their changes. A few of the more bold students mounted others, inspired by their alphas' mating, and fucked each other through their first change. The teachers wanted to scream in terror, but found themselves struck dumb by the dare. Running for the exits, they found them locked and barred, and could only watch. At last, the mass transformation of the student body into an army of werewolves was complete, and now they looked for more completion, as their alpha commanded them. Still aroused by the heat of their change, they lustily pounced upon their teachers, ripping into them with their teeth and claws and devouring their flesh. Once each had eaten, they backed off to allow others to the feast. Now, all of their minds were transformed like Gabe and Jen's, full werewolves with no remnant of their humanity. The command to obey their alphas was unnecessary now... they wished to obey their creators. Now, even when in human form, they would know only thoughts of spreading their curse and living wild, mating and feeding as they pleased. Never again would they wear clothing, except when they needed to lure others in to join the pack or when their alphas commanded it.<br />
Ashley had transformed with the rest of the students. This beautiful body, a cross between human and wolf, full of freedom and strength, had been her fantasy for years, and the sights, sounds and scents of five hundred mating werewolves had aroused her enough to transform her completely, although she had hidden from marauding males during the confusion and had not been mated. Nor had she feasted on human flesh, and so her mind had not undergone the Darkening. A beast she was, yes, but still a free beast, and she did not want to become evil like the rest of her fellow students. No one had noticed that she had not partaken of the forbidden feast yet, and thinking quickly, she bit her own arm and wiped the blood around her muzzle, to make it look as though she had dined with the rest. It would only be a matter of time before someone found out that she was not truly one of them, though. Sniffing the air, she looked around for an escape...</p>
