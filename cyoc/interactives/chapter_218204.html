<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Van woke still on his couch, outside the windows the sky was just beginning to brighten. Paul had fallen asleep on the couch as well, and Van&#39;s head still rested in his lap, though Paul had slumped slightly to the side once sleep took him. Slowly, he got to his feet, careful not to wake him as he stood and wandered into his bedroom, then to the bathroom beyond. He closed the door and turned to look in the mirror. &quot;Abaltis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to give up?&quot; Came the now familiar voice. He appeared sitting on the edge of the tub, today dressed in a pair of sparkling pink, skintight shorts. He laughed as Van made a face. &quot;Like them, pet? I think this will be your uniform while you&#39;re serving me, with a pink harness to match, maybe some rhinestones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; Van said, turning around, his voice a harsh whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Several things. Be more specific, pet.&quot; Abaltis pulled out his pipe, sticking it in his mouth and puffing away, his smirk breaking through his red beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;This.&quot; Van said, tugging on the front of the harness he still wore. &quot;And..&quot; His hand flung in the direction of the door. &quot;Paul.. That&#39;s not me. You&#39;ve been messing with me, you broke the deal, I know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I broke nothing!&quot; The fairy said, his gruff voice suddenly ramping up with anger as he stood. Van was several inches taller, but the fairy seemed to fill the whole room. He jabbed Van in the chest with a finger and the room seemed to spin, then instead of looking down at Abaltis they were suddenly eye to eye, maybe Van was even a little shorter, and the fairy&#39;s extra bulk made him seem even more imposing once Van no longer had the height advantage. He grabbed the front of the harness and yanked Van in close until their faces were inches apart. &quot;This,&quot; He said, roughly shaking the harness, &quot;Has always been you. You&#39;ve been attracted to men since your brain woke up to what sex was. You&#39;ve just repressed it even more than your buddy Paul out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice calmed as he let Van go. &quot;Well, maybe me dumbing you down made it harder for you to bottle up. Like I&#39;ve told you, fairies know desires and I can read yours like a book.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Look at that, you made me waste my change for the day. Ah well, I was going to do this at some point anyway, but I was going to be nice today to celebrate your first date with Paul, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room was still spinning, and the new perspective wasn&#39;t helping either. &quot;What did you do?&quot; He asked, keeping his tone measured less he spark that anger again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I made you ten inches down below so I took ten inches off the top.&quot; The fairy almost seemed to giggle. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, being short&#39;s not so bad. And it makes your dick look even bigger in comparison.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten?&quot; Van said, his voice cracking a little. He did some math which his brain could still do and paled. Five foot four. He&#39;d be five foot four now. He just went from the tallest of his friends to the shortest by a good margin. He could feel a few tears of frustration building in the corner of his eyes. Everything before had been something he could live with or even liked. This time Abaltis had taken something he was actually proud of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want out of our deal. I can shrink your dick and go, sadly the rest of the changes stay. Or.. you could agree to serve me and I&#39;ll even undo what you don&#39;t like at the end of your service.&quot; The fairy came up behind him, squeezing one of Van&#39;s ass cheeks. &quot;Give up, pet, it&#39;s just going to get harder the longer I have to mess with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you&#39;d return me to normal any time I wanted!&quot; Van said, suddenly panicked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, and at the time the only change was your magnificent new cock, that&#39;s all the contract cares about, the rest of it is payment. One day of having a big dick, one change as payment. You still kept it for those days without serving me, payment is forfeit.&quot; He frowned as Van stared at him. &quot;You can&#39;t get payment back for renting a hotel room the nights you stayed just because you end the trip early.&quot; Van paled a little, he felt like throwing up. He knew that contract had too many loopholes. &quot;You want your brains or height back? Agree to serve me and you can have them back at the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abaltis stepped forward and plucked the pipe from his mouth. &quot;I will have you, pet. In the meantime, I&#39;m going to watch to see how long you can resist riding Paul&#39;s cock.&quot; And then he vanished as quickly as he appeared.<br />
<br />
Van balled his fist to punch the wall, but let it fall before doing so. He was backed into a corner and he knew he was no longer smart enough to find a way out, if he even could have before. With a sigh, he left the bathroom and walked back out to the living room.<br />
<br />
Paul was off the couch, his voice instead came from the kitchen in a low but harsh whisper. He was on his phone looking annoyed. &quot;I didn&#39;t know..&quot; He frowned as whoever was on the other side cut him off. &quot;I would have put them off limits.&quot; Van couldn&#39;t make out the other side of the conversation, but from Paul&#39;s expression he was glad he couldn&#39;t. &quot;Can we talk about this in person?&quot; He sighed and hung up the phone, looking over to see Van looking at him. &quot;Work drama. Be glad you don&#39;t have to manage people. Nothing but problems. Sorry, I gotta go in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine.&quot; Van replied. &quot;I got work soon anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul walked closer, and Van had to crane his neck a bit to look up at him. Not too much thankfully. Paul may have been fit, but he was a more average five foot ten in the height department. Greg was the new tallest of their group at an even six feet. Still it was strange to be looking up at someone he was used to being taller than. Paul leaned in and kissed him, the franticness of last night was gone, this kiss was caring and sweet, gentle, basically it was more like Paul&#39;s normal self. &quot;Can I come by tonight after work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Van nodded. &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot; After another quick farewell kiss, Paul left the apartment, leaving Van to get ready for work himself. Strangely, he felt kind of wrong taking off the harness and setting out his work shirt for after his shower, like the former outfit fit him better than this one. He grumbled to himself, &quot;No way I was always like this,&quot; and headed off back to the bathroom to finish getting ready.</p>
