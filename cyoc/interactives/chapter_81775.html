<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting on the cement floor of the men's toilet, gazing at the row of urinals, cubicles and sinks, I wonder who looked the door and why. Frustrated, not just because I was locked in, but also because it was just something added to my now long list of problems, including that I was turning into a girl, I suddenly wanted to curl up into a ball and cry. Thinking, &quot;Get a hold of yourself,&quot; I eventually force myself up off the floor, deciding that there must be a way out.<br />
<br />
After trying to push and pull on the door a couple more times, I give up and instead stare at it, trying to see if there was any noticeable moving parts for the locking mechanism, like a dead-bolt handle or sliding piece or even a knob. When it became clear that none of those items were present, something I wasn't too surprised about, I turned my attention away from the door and wandered over to the far wall. Gazing up at the window, I guessed that it had to be at least eight to ten feet straight above me and heading for the nearest cubicle, I entered, grimaced and then started to figure out a way to climb up.<br />
<br />
When I was finally able to find a way up, going first from the toilet to the mounted toilet-paper dispenser to hanging off the back of the door and then shimmying my way up, I sat for a moment, balanced precariously, staring at the window. After a couple seconds it came to me what appeared off.<br />
<br />
The first thing I realised was that even though I was pretty much level with the window, there was no way I could actually get to it as it was several feet away from me and that I would either have to make a ridiculous leap or learn how to fly. The second thing I came to understand was that even if I could actually get to the window, I still couldn't get through it as I saw that this was the type of window with a double pain of glass and what looked like chicken wire in between the two pieces. Sighing, my frustration deepening, I slowly climbed back down, muttering dark my thoughts about wasting time.<br />
<br />
Sitting back down on the floor, not really looking about the loo from where I am sitting, I reach up and slowly began to knock my fist on the door, thinking as I do so. Wanting only to get out of the men’s room, I find myself at a loss as to how I am supposed to do so as the window was inaccessible and the door behind me was locked. Closing my eyes, I let my arm drop back down.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
I really wasn’t aware of the fact that I’d began to drowse, just one minute I was sitting with my back to a door and the next minute I was lurching forward, confused as to exactly where I was. Seeing the urinals, the sinks and the toilet cubicles, it suddenly came back to me that I was locked in a restroom and settling back down, I start to feel myself drowse once again.<br />
As I did, something caught my eye and suddenly I fully awake and peering at the object in question, I mutter, “That wasn’t there before,” as I slowly get up.<br />
<br />
Walking over to the sinks, I hunker down and gaze at what I could clearly see was a grate covering. Leaning closer, I saw that it led into an air shaft and that if I had to guess, was no more than two to three feet long. Blinking, confused as to where it had come from, I eventually settle on that it had always been there and that a lack of proper lighting in the room in the room prevented me from seeing it.<br />
<br />
After staring at it for some time, I finally shrug and thought to myself, “Whatever. It’s here and that’s all that matters,” but then stop as I wonder if there was any point in crawling through it as I figured that if the men’s toilet was locked, so was the woman’s, which I figured was were the grating led to.<br />
<br />
Turning away from the grating, I gaze about the room, breathing through my mouth, as I still really couldn’t stand the smells. After some time, I decide that if I am going to be caught in a locked restroom, it might as well be the right one and turning my attention back to the grating, I first hunker down and then sit down on the cement floor, trying to see how it was the grating opened or came off the wall.<br />
<br />
Eventually I am able to figure out that the grate merely lifts up and away and setting it aside, I peer inward. For a moment I am confused because I had thought that the ductwork was about two to three feet in length, but without the covering it appeared to be no longer than six inches to a foot. Unsure how such an illusion would actually work, with the cold airway looking longer with the covering but shorter without, I hesitate, feeling as if something was off.<br />
<br />
Standing, I turned away and gazed at the far way. Heading for the door into the bathroom, I turn so that I was facing inward, with the sinks on my left side and the urinals and the cubicle toilets on my right. Closing my eyes, I pictured myself walking up to the public toilets, approaching the doors that would either lead into the men’s or woman’s loo. On my right, the door to the woman’s toilet, while on my left was the door to men’s toilet. Opening my eyes, I peer at the grate, and the hole in the wall, and realise what was off.<br />
<br />
Confused, sure that I was remembering the layout of the building correctly, I crawled toward the hole and peered through it. On the other side I could just faintly make out a room and leaning closer, I was sure that I was looking at bottom part of a door and a toilet. Figuring I must be looking at the row of cubicles in the woman’s loo, I paused before deciding that whatever had rearranged the building so the woman’s toilet was now on the left must be the same something that had kept the sun from moving, as well as moving in the opposite direction. Taking a couple deep breaths, I finally decided enough was enough and if I couldn’t get out on the other side, I could always either wait or come back through the ductwork.<br />
<br />
Leaning forward, I stretched my hands and arms out as far I could and realising that I could grasp the lip on the far side, I pause as it comes to me that the grating was missing on the other side. Mentally shrugging, figuring there was nothing I could do about it, I pulled myself forward.<br />
<br />
At first it was a tight fit and for a moment, I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to squeeze through. Shifting about, my pants coming down a little, exposing my underwear in the process, I am able to eventually crawl through and standing, I gaze at the mess that is covering my shirt and underwear, guessing that the duct between the two rooms must not have been cleaned in well over twenty years. Pulling up my pants, deciding that as soon as I got out I would head back to the hotel and get a clean shirt and pair of panties, I gazed about the room.<br />
<br />
Behind me I noticed a row of sinks, complete with mirrors above them, all unbroken unlike the men’s loo, which had several broken mirrors. Across from the sinks I see a row of cubicles toilets, complete with a toilet paper dispenser and a trashcan. On the wall nearest to the door were two machines, which I knew dispensed either tampons or pads, as I had asked my mother once and she had explained this to me.<br />
<br />
Shaking my head, suddenly realising what I was thinking, I silently told myself, “You never asked mom about those when you were little. Even before she died.”<br />
<br />
Feeling unnerved, I took a step toward the exit, but stopped. Seeing something draped over the last sink, right before the door, I walked to the end of the row and picked it up. Seeing that it was a girl’s one-piece bathing suit, I shuddered, mostly because I had a sudden urge to strip down and put it on. Closing my eyes, I whispered, “You are not a girl. You are a boy who just happens to be a cross-dresser,” but found this train of thought to be off somehow.<br />
<br />
Setting the swimsuit back in the sink, I stepped away from it and towards the door. Reaching for the handle, I was just about to grasp it, when I instead let my hand fall back to my side. Turning, I looked at the swimsuit, white with purple shoulder straps and three diamonds on the right side, just above the leg hole, and once again I feel an overwhelming urge to wear it. Taking a step toward the sink, I start to reach for the swimsuit, but gritting my teeth, I shouted, “NO!”<br />
<br />
As the word echoes about the empty bathroom, I felt the need to wear the one-piece swimsuit slip from me and before it could come over me a second time, I turned, headed for the door and grasping the handle, I prayed, “Please let this be unlocked,” as I pull.<br />
<br />
To my surprise, the door opened much easier than I thought it would and for a moment I am caught off balance. Reorienting myself, I blink against the bright light that I see flowing into the woman’s toilet and taking one final look back, barely noticing that the swimsuit had vanished, I rush out of the bathroom. Outside, I note that the men’s room was to my right now, but not wanting to dwell on it too much, I begin to hurry away, sure that I just barely managed to slip away from what was surely another transformation.<br />
<br />
“Or another step towards my transformation into a girl,” I thought grimly as I stopped and attempted to get my sense of direction.<br />
<br />
Looking about, I thought that I am still in a park, just not the one I had first entered. Spying a building, I began heading for it. When I get close enough to it, I saw that it had at one time a sign of individual letters up on one side, but all that remained of it was the word JUNCTION. Walking closer, I peered through the only window that wasn’t soaped up, stepped back, used my already dirty shirt to wipe away some of the dust and then, stepping closer, peered back through the window.<br />
<br />
Inside I saw a table with chairs sitting upside down on top of them, what appeared to be long table-top counter now broken in several sections and a large metal wall, which I figure must be a pull-down screen that would open up into the kitchen and be where the cook placed the orders when he or she finished cooking them. Figuring that it certainly hadn’t been open in years, I stepped away from the window and idly began walking toward the dirt and gravel parking lot. As I turned the corner, coming out in what I was sure was the front of the restaurant at one point I stopped and stared at something I haven’t seen since I was a little kid.<br />
<br />
Sitting atop one another, numbering about ten in total, were a set of old, turnstile-style type crank vending machines that you could put either a quarter or two quarters in the top, just above the crank. Turning the crank, I knew that a series of springs would contract and release and egg-shaped object that contained a prize. Approaching the machines, I noted that all except one was empty, and reading, ‘MYSTERY PRIZE EVERY TIME’ on the front, I wished that I had two quarters to put into the slot.<br />
<br />
“Just like I did when I was a kid,” I thought as I idly turned the crank.<br />
<br />
To my surprise, the crank didn’t stop where it normally would have and instead spun a full three sixty. Inside the machine I could hear the familiar ‘CRONK’ noise as the innards went to work. Shortly afterward I heard a ‘CLICK’ and lifting up the metal plate at the bottom of the machine, I withdrew not one but two egg-shaped prizes, something I had never had the luck of getting.<br />
<br />
As I thought, “Cool! Double prizes!” I was about to twist and pull apart the first of the two egg-shaped objects, but stopped.<br />
<br />
Hesitant, suddenly remembering that I was inside a computer programme and that magick had a tendency to run rampant, often causing unwanted transformations, I thought about setting the egg-shaped objects down and backing away. Instead, I gazed at them for a bit longer, before deciding, “What’s the harm. The chances are it’s silly putty or some such stuff. And if it is something unwanted, I can just ditch it,” as I figured I would wait until I got back to the hotel before opening them.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Making my way through the new park, sure that it wasn’t the same one I had originally took a walk through, I eventually found my way out and finding myself looking at the familiar resort town, I thought about finding Rei and how I should locate her to explain all I had and had not found. Instead, I figured that I would eventually run into her at the hotel and coming to the conclusion that I had enough exploration for one day, I gazed about, got my bearings and started for the hotel, hoping that I was going in the right direction and that I had made the right choice by wanting to wait for the other girl at the hotel.<br />
<br />
When I finally arrived back at the hotel, I paused for a moment, listening. When I heard nothing and nobody, I called out, “Rei?” and receiving no answer, I confirmed what I suspected; that the other girl still wasn’t back yet.<br />
<br />
Heading up to our shared room, I paused outside the door and gazed down at the double prizes I had won. Suddenly wanting to toss them away, I turn away from the door and head down the hallway. Stopping in front of a window, I opened it and breathing in the breeze that was now coming though, I raised my arm, preparing myself to toss away the egg-shaped objects, sure that they would nothing but trouble.<br />
<br />
Instead, I turned away from the window and walked toward the shared room. Opening the door, I paused again and peered into the room. Seeing that it was empty, I stepped across the threshold. Closing the door behind me, I headed for the bed I had slept in the previous evening.<br />
<br />
Dropping the prizes I had won onto the rumpled comforter and sheet, I turned away from the bed and walked over to a chair, which had a robe laying over it. Unsure if it was mine, or if I had even left it there, I shrugged off this feeling of confusion and instead begin to strip. Tossing my clothes to one side, I picked up the robe and pull it on, tying the sash around my waist as I do so.<br />
<br />
Liking how soft the robe felt against my skin, I wonder for a moment if I had ever liked the feeling of something soft pressing against my soft skin. Unable to answer this, wanting only a shower, I glance once more at the egg prizes, turned away and head for the bathroom. Inside, I closed the door, headed for the tub and turning the spigots, I began to work them until I had a water temperature I was sure wouldn’t be to hot or too cold.<br />
<br />
After engaging the shower, I slipped off the robe, hung it on the back of the door and slipping under the water, I stood there for some time, content with the feeling of the warm water running over my body. When the water began to turn cool, I adjusted the spigots and then, reaching for the shampoo and conditioner, I started to lather and wash myself, the feeling of wanting to be clean overriding any other thoughts I was feeling or thinking of. After I had finished, I slowly toweled myself off, put my robe back on and headed back into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Upon seeing the two egg-shaped prizes lying on the bed, I glanced about and noted that Rei still wasn’t back. Turning my attention back to the double prizes, I told myself, “Either open them or toss them away,” and striding toward the bed, I picked the closer of the two.<br />
<br />
Peering at it, I noted that, like the other one, it was purple in colour. But unlike the other, this egg prize was a couple shades different.<br />
<br />
“All most a shade of blue,” I thought as twisted and pulled.<br />
<br />
With an audible ‘CLICK’ I felt the piece I was working on give way and peering at the object that was rolled up inside, I at first couldn’t figure out what I was looking at. Gently pulling it out, I noted that it was light blue in colour and had some sort of printed images on it. Unrolling it, I immediately could see that the images of several dark blue stars and dots, as well of images of a unicorn pony. But from what show this image was from, as I was sure the image was from a television programme, eluded me, as well just then.<br />
The moment I saw these images, I realised that what I was holding was a pair of girl’s underwear. Shifting the garment in my hands, I noted that the elastic bands around the leg holes and the waist were a strip of blue, a stripe of white and then another stripe of blue and that it felt rather soft in touch and would certainly be comfortable to wear.<br />
<br />
Wondering who would roll a pair of underwear up and stuff them into an egg-prize that came from a vending machine, I tossed the underwear onto the bed. Realising what I was thinking, I was suddenly hesitant about opening the second egg.<br />
<br />
Again, I reason out that if I don’t like the prizes, there was nothing saying I had to keep them and picking up the second egg, I twist until it too opens.<br />
<br />
Inside I find once again another piece of fabric rolled up tightly and scared that it was more underwear, I almost tossed it aside. Instead, I withdrew the object from the egg, dropped the two halves onto the bed with the other two halves from the previous prizes, and unfolding it, I stared.<br />
<br />
I don’t know how I knew what I was holding, just that I did and that it was called a leotard. It was white in colour, had long sleeves, with three diamonds over the right leg hole. I thought I had seen something similar but couldn’t remember where. On the front was the outline of what appeared to be a unicorn and for some reason, I thought I should know the image, but once again couldn’t place it. Scared, wanting to toss both the leotard and the underwear in the trash, “Or even out the window,” I muttered at one point, I instead picked up the panties and thought that they could easily be worn under the leotard and nobody would know as they looked like they would ride high and be thin enough not to leave any noticeable lines.<br />
<br />
Suddenly unsure, wondering how I knew such stuff, I wanted more than anything to try on both the leotard and the underwear, thinking to myself that I could wear a pair of bib-overalls over the leotard.<br />
<br />
Taking both the underwear and the leotard into the bathroom, I dropped them onto the sink and peering into the mirror, I stare at the feminine reflection staring back. Wishing that there was a way to undo what had happened to me, I wonder if there was really any point in continuing to fight the transformation. Slipping off my robe, I adjusted myself so that my penis and testicles were tucked back. As I stared and marvelled at how much I looked like a girl, also wishing that my chest wasn’t bothering me so much, I finally came to a conclusion.<br />
<br />
As I decided that if I could turn into a girl, then I certainly could turn back into a boy, I absently reached for the underwear and slipping them on, I adjusted myself so that there was no noticeable bulge. Next I reached for the leotard and holding it up in front of me, I giggled, unaware that it sound high and really feminine, and thought how soft the fabric felt and how it would probably stretch, accenting certain areas of my body.<br />
<br />
Squatting down, I rolled the garment up slightly and then stepped into the leotard. Pulling it up, I paused as I once again adjusted, this time to make sure my panties would not be seen, suddenly feeling self-conscious about wearing such a tight a revealing item. Oblivious to the strange feeling in my groin and lower abdomen, figuring it was probably connected with how tight the clothes I was wearing and how they were really pressing against my privates, I pulled the leotard up the rest of the way, slipped my arms into the arm holes and then adjusted for a third time. When I had finished, I stood in front of the mirror, admiring how cute I looked, how you couldn’t tell that I was wearing underwear underneath the leotard and how the fabric was so soft, it didn’t even bother my sore and tender nipples.<br />
<br />
Again, I uttered a giggle and turning away, I was about to take a step, when I felt a twinge start in my feet and suddenly rocket up through my body.<br />
<br />
Groaning, suddenly realising the feeling in my abdomen and groin didn’t have anything to do with what I was wearing and had begun to build, I doubled over as I felt a cramping sensation erupt in my stomach, shoulders, arms, hands, legs and feet. Understanding that something was happening to me, and that it might be connected with the clothes I had just put on, I tried to turn back around so that I was looking in the mirror, but instead slumped to the floor.<br />
<br />
The cramping feeling spreading to my face, I thought I heard a cracking noise, but was too distracted by the pain in my hips, pelvis, waist, spine and shoulders. Gritting my teeth, I suddenly wanted to scream in both pain and terror as I watched my fingers fuse together and then disappeared as my hands took on the appearance of hooves. Uttering a high pitch noise that sounded like a whinny of terror, I screamed, “NOOOO!” as I tried once again to get to the mirror, but only succeeded in beginning to spasm about.<br />
<br />
A burning sensation in my ears alerted me to the fact that my transformation had reached that point, but not really caring, I simply squeezed my eyes shut, wishing that whatever was happening would finish as the burning feeling mixed with cramping sensation. And within minutes, I got what I asked for as both the cramping and the burning sensation began to slowly dissipate. When it was nearly gone, I decided that now I would be able to stand, and taking it slowly, understanding coming to me that I no longer had the ability to walk on two legs, I gingerly stood and turned my attention to the mirror. And when I finally was able to see my reflection, all I could do was stand before the reflective device and stare.<br />
<br />
In the exact centre of my forehead I could see a horn. My eyes had turned a brilliant shade of blue and my hair was now a purple mane. White fur covered my head and my nose and mouth extended out into the muzzle of a filly. Furthering boosting myself upward, I saw that I did indeed have hooves now instead of hands and fingers, while it took me a moment to puzzle out what was moving behind me. After a moment, it came to me that I swishing my tail and dropping down from the sink, I turned my head and gazed at the three diamonds on my flank. Suddenly realising something, I lifted one of my hind legs and thinking, “No, no, no, no,” over and over, I lay down on the bathroom floor, rolled over on my back, rolled over on my side and then stuck my muzzle in my crotch.<br />
<br />
Understanding that I was indeed now fully female, I struggled back up into a standing position and gazing back into the mirror, I muttered, “Great! I really have have become a filly unicorn!”<br />
<br />
As I stared at my reflection, trying to come to terms with what had happened, understanding that somehow my name was no longer Alex, I heard, faintly, a door opening and closing, followed by Rei’s voice asked, “Alex? Are you back?” and dropping my forelegs to the floor, I sighed.<br />
<br />
Deciding that I would have to sooner or later face the music and that Rei deserved the truth, I glanced one final time back at the mirror before calling out, “Yeah. And you’re never going to believe what happened to me,” as I turned away, mentally shuddered at how feminine my voice sounded and started for the bathroom door.</p>
