<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I wish I could tell you that I stopped after that. I wish I could tell you that I pulled up my pants, cleaned up my mess, and walked out the door. At the very least, I wish I could tell you that I stopped fantasizing about a guy as I kept jerking off.<br />
<br />
I&#39;d be lying if I did.<br />
<br />
Instead, I must&#39;ve spent the entire day focusing on containing the pleasurable sensations coming from my cock. It was incredible. I had never blown that many loads or produced that much cum. And every time I did, it was cause I pictured Jacob or Daniel or Chase or Taylor or some other guy. For the life of me, I just couldn&#39;t cum while thinking about Lisa. I would furiously pump myself and concentrate as hard as I could, but eventually I was forced to concede and think about one of the guys just to get that sweet release.<br />
<br />
Boy, was it sweet though. I never tasted it (though I had to stop myself from unconsciously gravitating towards it), but it felt ungodly. Everytime I came, the high left me feeling even fuzzier than the last. The result was that by the time I realized that I wasn&#39;t going to go soft tonight, my head was a cloudy haze and I had to truly focus to do anything, especially put my pants on.<br />
<br />
I eventually managed to pull myself out of a stall and look at a mirror. I was a mess. My clothes were wrinkled and out of place, my lips were dry, and my fatigue showed. I wanted to fix myself a little, but my one hand was still cupping my ass and my other was now gravitating towards the other cheek. I had no idea why, but for some reason, my hands were obsessed with my ass. I didn&#39;t receive pleasure from touching it, but it satisfied some vague addiction that I couldn&#39;t ignore.<br />
<br />
For a moment, I worried that someone would question my disappearance. That worry left me the moment I heard another man moan from the stall next to mine. I had heard multiple people come in with the same goal in mind, though some only came in for one quick one before leaving due to lack of space. As a result, the floor was practically covered in cum, and it took everything in me to drag myself away from it and just leave the bathroom, my hands in my back pockets, cupping my ass.<br />
<br />
I managed to shamefully and sheepishly begin walking back to my room, careful watching for any familiar faces that I&#39;d have to run away from. I had almost made it back unseen, too. Unfortunately, right before I turned the last hall, my black-haired, weird friend walked out the door, an odd, dazed smile on his face. He seemed to be completely zoned out and lost in something that was euphoric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel? You okay?&quot; I asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he giggled out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem a little...&quot; I didn&#39;t want to use the word I was thinking of, but I couldn&#39;t think of anything else. &quot;Ditzy?&quot;<br />
<br />
In response, Daniel giggled again. &quot;Ditzy? Fuck, that sounds hot. Ditzy sl...&quot; he began murmuring something to himself that I couldn&#39;t understand, giggling randomly to make it even harder.<br />
<br />
I studied his face for a bit more, trying to understand what had happened to him. He looked more disheveled than me. Although, looking closer, I noticed his hair was dry and hard. Like something sticky had dried in it. It couldn&#39;t be...<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when I noticed it. Just by the side of his lip. A small droplet of something white and a little milky. Fuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel, is that fucking cum by your lip?!&quot; I screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, did I miss some?&quot; the black-haired man. He began licking around his lips until he got it. &quot;Oh, thanks man!&quot;<br />
<br />
What the fuck?! &quot;YOU&#39;RE A FUCKING FAG?! GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!&quot; I yelled, pushing him aside and walking past him. The fag couldn&#39;t even respond. All he did was fucking giggle.<br />
<br />
That was it. I needed to leave. I needed some fresh and to clear my head. I was going nuts. I ran downstairs in no time, completely missing my door. I knew of a back exit in the lobby, so I just had to hope that no one was guarding it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, luck wasn&#39;t in my favor today. Instead, guarding the door was the same officer from before, dressed in the same, full body armor. His sharp, brown eyes narrowed as he focused in on me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You again? What the hell are you doing here?&quot; he asked, his voice smoother than I remembered.<br />
<br />
I had to come up with something if I wanted to be let out. I studied him better this time. Ryan was his name, as evidenced by the tag on his vest. He was quite imposing, given his muscle mass. It felt like he was almost twice my size. I guess that&#39;s why it felt so weird seeing how smooth his face was. It was like he had no hair below his nose.<br />
<br />
Still, there was no way someone could get that sculpted without years in the gym. I immediately had plan. &quot;Look man, I&#39;m just trying to find a way to work out. There&#39;s nothing here to use and it&#39;s killing me. I just need 10 minutes. It won&#39;t even be like I&#39;m gone,&quot; I reasoned.<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s face softened. He had to know the dedication required to obtain our bodies and calisthenics just didn&#39;t cut it. It looked like my idea worked!<br />
<br />
&quot;I get that. Nothing you guys get in your rooms will suffice. But I can&#39;t just let you out. You leave, you don&#39;t come back, and you don&#39;t wanna be outside right now. Look, here&#39;s what I&#39;ll do. I&#39;ve got some weights I use in my room here. Tomorrow, when I get off my guard shift, I&#39;ll give them to you. We can share them. Alright?&quot; he bargained.<br />
<br />
I wanted to open my mouth to protest, but I was cornered. He solved my fake problem completely. Plus, I got something I actually wanted out of it.<br />
<br />
I decided to cut my losses and simply nod in agreement. Slightly defeated, though excited for the small semblance of normalcy, I walked away and slowly trudged up the stairs. My long session in the bathroom was finally starting to take it&#39;s toll on me and the fog that had slightly disappeared by talking to Daniel and Ryan was returning. Honestly, by the time I got to the door of my dorm room, I just wanted to fall on my bed and--<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck Taylor?!&quot; I yelled.<br />
<br />
There, on his bed, my roommate lay naked, his hand furiously pumping his straining dick. Just like mine had been before, it was purple and throbbing, just with red pubic hairs dusting the base. I couldn&#39;t stop staring, and when Taylor looked up, he noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, bro. I was holding in it for so long and you were gone all day. I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d come back now!&quot; he explained, still jacking off incessantly. &quot;Although, it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re complaining.&quot;<br />
<br />
I followed his eyes to find my dick, still hard as steel. I had no idea whether it had actually gone down since leaving the bathroom, but it didn&#39;t matter. All that mattered was that my roommate and best friend was naked and jacking himself and I was hard in front of him.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I was horny.<br />
<br />
The fog in my head grew too thick to see through, and my body went on autopilot. I slowly walked up to his bed and leaned on it, staring directly into his eyes. Cautiously, I reached lower and lower until my hand grasped his warm, hard organ. In my defense, the redhead had removed his hands to give me space. I looked into his eyes, finding the confirmation I needed. I began stroking.<br />
<br />
He let out a light moan in response. Then, his hands moved to the hem of my shirt, begging for its removal. I conceded, tossing my shirt to the ground. Soon after, my pants and boxers followed, and we were completely naked in front of each other. Of course, we&#39;d seen each other naked before in gym showers and such, but never like this. And in those showers, I never jacked him off. And he never jacked me off.<br />
<br />
But that&#39;s what we were doing. Neither of us stopped looking into each other&#39;s eyes and neither of us stopped moving our hands to pleasure the other. The hand that wasn&#39;t jacking the other off was used to feel each other up. I focused on his nipples, his abs, his ass. Fuck, I wanted him, and the haze in my mind wasn&#39;t helping me out.<br />
<br />
The roaming hands and the connection we were sharing soon became too much for us. I could feel it when Taylor was close. His breathing became short and heavy and his cock began twitching. It wasn&#39;t long before he blew, spraying his load over my chest and even getting a little on the top of my lip. His orgasm triggered my own, causing cum to stain his bed and cover his face.<br />
<br />
The haze in my mind got even stronger and I finally broke my gaze with Taylor. Cum was practically everywhere and it felt great. I loved how hot Taylor looked, smiling and covered in our cum. I had never felt such a connection with another person before, even when I fucked my girlfriend. Instead, it was my best friend who had me feeling this way. It felt ridiculous but great, and I could tell Taylor felt the same. It made me want to laugh, so I did.<br />
<br />
Except, instead of the hearty laughs we were used to, a different tone came out. Lighter and slightly more feminine. Like a...<br />
<br />
Like a giggle. Shit.<br />
<br />
The realization hit both of us and sent us into panic. I quickly jumped off of Taylor and dove for my bed, wrapping myself in the covers. I didn&#39;t care how much cum stained my sheets or how awkward it would be tomorrow morning. Neither of us was even willing to turn off the lights. I just squeezed my eyes shut and prayed that this would be over tomorrow morning, but not before my tongue unconsciously licked my lips, tasting the small dose of redhead that Taylor left for me.<br />
<br />
Fuck, I thought. That shouldn&#39;t have tasted so good.</p>
