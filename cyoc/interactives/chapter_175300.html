<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Ty was back inside, he quickly closed the back door and made sure it was locked. He took his free hand and felt June squirming inside his closed fist. She must be very tiny! He carefully opened his fingers, palm up, and gasped at the sight of teensy tiny June lying disheveled on her back in the middle of his hand. She stared back in fresh shock.<br />
<br />
She was barely three inches tall!<br />
<br />
&quot;T-Ty!&quot; June whimpered nervously, &quot;Please! I&#39;m getting too small!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, little toy.&quot; Ty grinned deviously. &quot;I won&#39;t let anything happen to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s hardly reassuring...&quot; June retorted, gulping slightly as she bounced and swayed while Ty carefully carried the toy sized woman up the stairs with him and returned to his bedroom. Shrunken and shrinking June had no choice but to hang on in the literal palm of Ty&#39;s hand, feeling herself dwindle ever smaller. Helpless, growing concerned, she laid back in nervous disbelief. Everything was terrifyingly huge to her now. Ty&#39;s bedroom was an expanse large enough to fit an entire town. The ceiling seemed to be thousands of feet above her. Worse still, he was still letting her shrink. During the journey upstairs she was lost a few more milimeters, which at her size was a significant amount.<br />
<br />
Ty sat down on the edge of his bed and stared at little naked June in wonder. She started back, blushing, and realized what was happening. She gulped hard, broke out into a sweat again, and went beat red with flushed arousal and fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-Be... be gentle.&quot; She squeaked, about two and a half inches tall. Her voice was squeaky and high pitched to the point it was growing inaudible to Ty. He had to lean in to hear her and watched her cringe as his massive head drew near.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you liked it rough, my little bitch.&quot; Ty smirked deviously, giggling as June laid back in his hand and her face registered a combination of anxiety and anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty...&quot; June called up, alarmed as her shrinking continued. &quot;I&#39;m getting too small!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you?&quot; Ty grinned playfully. &quot;Maybe I should let you go microscopic. I do have a microscope, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, no!&quot; June suddenly flew to her knees and steadied herself in Ty&#39;s palm. &quot;W-What if... what if I get eaten by germs or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do to make me stop it?&quot;<br />
<br />
June pleaded now. Putting her hands together and clasping her fingers, shaking her clenched fists emphatically. &quot;Whatever you want! Just like I said! Please! I&#39;m getting scared!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty leaned in closer and raised the tiny two inch tall woman to his view. She knelt in the palm of his hand, terrified, and waited with a slack jaw and wide terrified eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please!&quot; She repeated, her voice decreasing in audibility and raising sharply in pitch, closer to a quiet squeak now than anything resembling human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or I could speed it up...&quot; Ty offered, watching her body language fall. &quot;I could hold you in my hand as you pass a grain of sand and vanish under my eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; June screamed, standing up and frantically waving. &quot;Please, don&#39;t! I wanted to be your friend! I can still fix things! I thought we were going to be friends! I can make you feel good! Don&#39;t shrink me out of existance! Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment Ty had a choice between cruelty and mercy. He held the object of his worst torment in his hand and she was fast vanishing from the world. If he let her go... if he let her keep going... she would be gone forever. Lost to sight. Forever shrinking until she eventually grew too small to either breathe, live, or even exist. She would shrink past matter, molecules, whatever else was even possible. Or he could keep her living in the microverse. The idea of her forever trapped in a nightmare world and struggling to survive, terrified...<br />
<br />
It made him sick. Ty was many things, and he owed a great deal of retribution to June in particular - especially with his new powers - but he was no monster. He let the dark thoughts pass by and focused on a crying and waving June, now so small that she couldn&#39;t be heard. While he had zoned out, she was reduced to mere milimeters, growing so small that his hand was now a rolling hill of flesh to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus!&quot; Ty spat, realizing. He quickly willed June to stop and watched the spec of a woman crumple in relief and grab her head sobbing desperately. She was absolutely hysterical.<br />
<br />
In a panic, Ty willed her back to twelve inches tall, and she quickly regrew to a handful. He watched her with guilt and fascination as she knelt and held herself in his hand, spilling over it and dangling her legs to the side. She clutched herself, shook, and still sobbed quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You were going to shrink me to nothing.&quot; She managed, lips trembling, tiny body shaking in horror. &quot;I-I saw your face. You were going to end me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I... I got distracted. I started thinking bad shit. I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry, June. I wouldn&#39;t... I couldn&#39;t hurt you for real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;P-Put me down.&quot; June began to panic, squirming in Ty&#39;s hand and starting to pant. &quot;Please put me down! I need a minute!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty complied, gripping June&#39;s waist and setting her down on the bedroom floor. She began to pace nervously, shooting him mortified looks and clutching herself. Eventually, she began to calm. She took several deep breaths into her tiny lungs and exhaled. She closed her eyes, centered herself, and looked up at watching Ty nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I&#39;m a fucking bitch.&quot; Her voice wavered. &quot;I know I&#39;m a cruel heartless fucking cunt.&quot; She paused, tearing up, and put her hands to her mouth, breaking down again. &quot;Please don&#39;t kill me. Please. I don&#39;t want to die. Torture me, hurt me, punish me. Don&#39;t take my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t hurt you!&quot; Ty promised. &quot;June, please calm down! I fucked up, okay? I went to bad place.&quot;<br />
<br />
The shrunken woman turned, burst into full tears again, and threw herself down beside the bed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; She wailed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I never wanted kids! I never wanted to be married! I hate myself, my life, and I just wanted to make other people hurt!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey, hey!&quot; Ty quickly consoled, reaching for the doll sized woman and picking her up. He cradled her in his arms, letting her cry it out, and blushed as she cuddled into him and grabbed his shirt, sobbing with racking grief.<br />
<br />
When at last she had let out everything she had, June looked up at Ty, eyes red, little face sore and exhausted, and stared at him meekly. &quot;I... I really wanted to... to... I wanted you to do stuff to me. I haven&#39;t felt that excited in forever. It&#39;s fucking weird, and crazy, and perverted, but... but I was really starting to like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... did a great job on the yard.&quot; Ty admitted, gulping. &quot;It was... it was so sexy watching you work so hard with your body shrinking down like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It... it was?&quot; June gulped. &quot;I was?&quot; She realized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Such determination. Such strength. There&#39;s so much more to you than I realized.&quot;<br />
<br />
June blushed a little but still felt miserable. &quot;Maybe. It was... it was so surreal. All I could focus on was getting it done before I got too small.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you did awesome.&quot; Ty blushed. &quot;And... and I guess after this shit you... you kind of deserve a reward.&quot;<br />
<br />
June&#39;s eyes widened and she let a smile crack. &quot;O-Oh! What did you... what did you have in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing too drastic.&quot; Ty began to tremble. &quot;Uh... I mean, before today I&#39;d never even seen a girl naked before. Besides, like, internet porn, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; June blinked, suddenly self-conscious of the nudity she had gotten used to over the last few hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I... uh... check you out? Like... at full size?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Check me out?&quot; June smirked. &quot;Only big me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Ty blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Punish me later?&quot; She smirked, blushing again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if I... actually... um, if I&#39;m capable of that. A lot of that was... anger. Control. You know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you&#39;re ever pissed off at me again, I do like it rough, big boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noted.&quot; Ty gulped. &quot;So, uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
June laughed in embarrassment. &quot;Yeah... I don&#39;t know. It feels right to be, uh... your pet when I&#39;m a fucking doll. I don&#39;t know about being... big. I mean, there&#39;s the age, there&#39;s... there&#39;s... a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it.&quot; Ty gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... fuck it.&quot; June looked up excitedly, startled and breathless. &quot;Let&#39;s... let&#39;s fucking do it. You&#39;re still the one in control. Make me big, Ty. Do whatever you want.&quot;</p>
