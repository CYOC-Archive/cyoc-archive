<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter is inspired by and based on <a href="/interactives/chapter_98990.html">#98990</a>, written by Xander6981 <a href="/interactives/user_2745.html">Author #2745</a>, so don&#39;t be surprised if some part of it is eerily similar to his creation.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, most of it is Sarah being the one trapped in the werewolf-library instead of Nate, but with Nate still being the werewolf lover.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah opened the large wooden doors and walked into what was clearly the library of the castle. It was a huge, open room with the wall to the left made up several windows that illuminated the room. The sun had set and the full moon had begun to rise on the castle. She walked into the room, noting the antique wrought iron spiral staircase leading to the second floor as well as the two couches, both upholstered in red fabric facing each other with a table in the between them in front of the carved stone fireplace. At the far end of the room was a large carved wooden desk with many books stacked upon it. She walked over and started looking over all of them in the dim light. To her amazement, they were all about werewolves. “A shame Nate isn't with me, he would have loved this room.” she was thinking out-loud. Nate had always been interested in werewolves, as much, if not more, than Sarah was interested in him. She sat down in the ornate chair and began paging through the books, which despite being centuries old looked incredibly well preserved, in the hope to impress Nate by reciting their content. She was so absorbed in the book she didn't notice the double doors to the room slowly close. She was startled from his reading when he heard the latch click.<br />
<br />
"What the..." muttered Sarah as he walked over to the door. She tried the knob but it wouldn't budge. She banged on the door a couple times. "Guys! Hey guys! This door is stuck."<br />
<br />
She was startled further when the logs in the fireplace suddenly burst to flame with a loud whoosh. Sarah spun around and watched in shock as every candle on the candelabras on either side of the mantel ignited on their own as well as the one on the desk. Sarah's heart raced as her mind tried desperately to find a rational explanation. Justin rigged the room, she thought. That had to have been it. And that was when she noticed it. On top of the mantel was a small bronze statue of a howling werewolf. Curious, Sarah walked over and picked it up off the mantel. It had some heft to it. She noticed an inscription inscribed in the base of the statue. She brought it over to the candlelight to read it better, the dark patina of the metal obscuring it somewhat.<br />
<br />
Sarah read the inscription aloud, "Under the light of the full moon, let the beast of this castle rise again in me." She chucked as he looked over the statue of the werewolf, reminding him a bit of the wolf man, except this one had a snout. Nate would have thought it would be cool to be a werewolf like this. Sarah read the inscription aloud again, surprised at it's simplicity.<br />
<br />
With the second incantation, the statue's eyes glowed red and Sarah heard a low growl emanate from it. Scared, Sarah dropped the statue and turned to run away. She only made it a couple steps when he froze at the sight of the large, full moon shining down upon her. Sarah began to tremble, wondering what she had just done. She turned back to look at the statue again only to find it back on top of the mantel. She turned back to look back at the moon. She stood there in the large open room transfixed by the giant lunar orb.<br />
<br />
She felt a sudden jolt of pain followed by a loud cracking noise, followed by another one. Sarah cried out and dropped to her knees. This can't be happening, she thought. This can't be... She stopped when she saw her this fingernails tear away and be replaced by sharp, black claws. Her entire body radiated with heat and pain as the transformation overtook her. She felt some loose items in her mouth and spit them out on to the rug with a mixture of drool and blood. She was horrified to see they were teeth. She felt around in his mouth with her tongue and felt the fangs start to grow in their place. She pulled off her sweatshirt, shocked to see a thin coating of brown and grey hairs growing in over her previously hairless body. She cried out as his muscles began to reform and her chest barrelled out. She felt her ears begin to grow out to points and shift upwards on her head. She shifted his position, sitting down and moving his legs in front of him. She pulled off her sneakers and socks, watching in awe as her toes' nails became claws similar to the ones now on her hands. She felt another wave of pain as he rolled over onto her stomach, propping herself up. She cried out, feeling a single tear escape from her eye and roll down her fur covered cheek.<br />
<br />
"It hurts...it hurts," she cried out softly, as her tail-bone stretched, growing into a fully formed Lupine tail. After mere moments, the transformation from teenage girl to werewolf was complete. She stood up and as he looked over her newly transformed self, scared.<br />
<br />
She tilted her head back and let out a howl. The door to the room unlocked and swung open, revealing an hawestuck Nate on the other side. “Sarah? Is that you?!?” When the still shocked werewolf shyly noded, her longtime friend and love interest added “You're so… Sexy.”<br />
<br />
Sexy? SEXY?!? She had changed into an heary monstruosity, and he had the gall to find it SEXY!?! That did it for the now enraged Sarah, who didin't even register the pain as she became more and more of a giant wolf.<br />
<br />
Sarah slapped Nate with the back of her hand before it become a paw, not wanting to claw at him, not wanting to change him. Becoming a werewolf was all he ever wanted after all, and she wasn't about to hand it to him that easily! Face to the giant wolf that used to be Sarah, a wolf making a low growl at him, Nate ran away from the beast as fast as he could.<br />
<br />
At first, Sarah's new instincts made her glad she hadn't contaminated him. After all as her future pack's alpha, she needed a strong male. But as she calmed down, slowly coming back to the form in which Nate had called her cute, part of her realised the implications of what happened. She had chased him away… He had called her CUTE, and in return she had scared him AWAY!<br />
<br />
Looking at her clawed hands, Sarah decided to run after Nate, hoping to bite him before he got changed in another kind of monster and possibly breaking any hope of becoming his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Sarah had broke free of the haunted castle's mental influance, and said castle wasn't pleased at all, even if she was still about to spread its influence. But how could it punish the bitch?</p>
