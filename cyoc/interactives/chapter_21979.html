<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gary Olsen had two greatest passions and one major disillusion in his life – He was a journalist but above everything, he was passionate about writing, he couldn’t be any happier than earning his leaving by doing what he loved the most. Gary also was passionate about the male body – its beauty, its virility and powerful structure; he loved everything about male muscles and he couldn’t get enough, his wondering eye always caught the enormous variety of incredible handsome men in the streets – not just the obvious bodybuilder types, but also the “blue collar” muscle, the sheering muscularity on different types of athletes like bikers or swimmers, even the “casual” muscle of the average men, the exciting surprise to notice a well toned biceps or a broad-chested stranger in the subway, always made Gary’s day better.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, to Gary’s greatest disappointment, his enthusiasm by the male physique had no greater reflect on his own body – Gary had the average height for a male adult, about 5’8”tall but out of shape unhealthy built, although he only weighed 147 pounds his frame still carried “love handles”, he had noticeable saggy “tits”, his shoulders were very narrow which gave him a fragile look – In sum, although Gary had a somewhat appealing facial look with straight dark brown hair, big brilliant hazel eyes, his big eagle-shaped nose along with his almost unnoticeable chin, gave him the overall appearance of a pale unhealthy scrawny man. Not to mention that his wardrobe didn’t do him any favor, baggy ugly clothing tried to hide his unattractive built, but instead it only increased the sensation of his unfitness – Olsen tried to change that many times, since he was 13 he’s been going on and off gym, no matter how hard he tried at first, his body never showed any noticeable progress, not only he “didn’t have the genetics” but his own frustration passed to his personal trainers, no matter how well they meant, how different and innovating the technique used, it always comes to the very same result, Gary simply couldn’t pack anything – not to mention the many injuries he collected over these years of frustrated attempts – his back, his knee, his elbow joints, everything hurt to the point he was advised by many physicians to avoid working out with weights, his body simply couldn’t handle that kind of stress.<br />
<br />
Since he couldn’t make that passion a reality in his own life, Gary had more of his time to develop his writing skills – whenever he wasn’t working in the articles for the Science magazine he wrote for, Olsen was always in search of any interesting book, or novel, or ancient writing tools such as old typewriters, scroll paper, feather pens, or any similar gadget. His own house resembled a museum, with lots of shelves clustered with many old volumes preserved in plastic bags – from old comic books issues to encyclopedia collections summing 150,000 dollars in rare books over the years – Being a 31 years old single man with a decent salary and no greater expenses meant that he saved enough money for traveling around the world in search for new items to his collection – In his latest trip to Italy, Zachary found this 18th century pen, it was exquisite, with silver body and golden end – The shop owner said it once belonged to the legendary Lord Byron, and even though it couldn’t be attested, the American collector simply felt that he had to own that pen.<br />
<br />
That was just last week, but Zach never felt more proud and at the same time sillier in his own life, he just loved to hold that fine instrument in his hand – the grip was so firm, so comfortable – to the point Zachary broke the #1 rule of collecting – he decided to use that pen – taking the chance he could ruin it forever, the journalist needed to feel that ancient tool doing what it was intended to do. Zach knew all about computers and state-of-the-art software, to him nothing beats the actual pleasure of writing something with the very hands – Usually he has to type his ideas straight in the screen, but whenever he can, Zach loves to draft his text in this leather covered notebook he keeps in his bag along with his computer, everything from groceries list to errands, and ideas for another “possible” romance, written down in this fine handwriting, delicate and yet very firm and masculine, another practice that Gary liked to practice – the art of calligraphy.<br />
<br />
This morning, however, not even the enthusiasm of his recent trip could wash the disillusion off Gary’s face, when he saw his reflection in the mirror – he still had the reddish tan of his Mediterranean destination, but unfortunately, all the abuses of his excursion to the “home” of pasta and pizza now showed the unwelcome results, his body looked even worse, he was surely at least 10 pounds heavier but in the worst possible way, his pants were tight around his waist, his gut got even rounder, and his chest even more flaccid – “My therapist will finally buy the chalet in Aspen he dreams of…” he sighed, brushing his teeth – nothing worse than having an unfit body is trying to get his “former shape” back, it only causes more frustration spending hours in the gym to lose the extra weight, knowing that the aftermath of this hard task will not be satisfying at all – that was clearly the major problem on Zach’s life – his own disappointment to himself and low self-esteem regarding to his body and looks, helped the young man to have a decent love life – Olsen was actually a loner, a lonely man with very few close friends, at most, he prefers the solitude than the constant worry he caused on his friends for being such a depressed unhealthy loner.<br />
<br />
According to his therapist, he should strengthen his own interior before he could make any improvements on the outside. That meant he should start developing a better view of himself – there were many “exercises” that could bring to this result, but frankly, Zach was skeptical about most of them, the only one he actually liked to do was the “Personal goals record” – he should keep a journal where he would write down everything he wanted to achieve in his life, emotionally, materially and even physically – like a notice to his future self – he should be able to help his own mind to accept the changes he wants to make in his own life, therefore he won’t “sabotage” his own plans – although it sounded like crap at first, he knew it would be better try it out, since it involved writing his favorite hobby. So, this morning Gary decided to start a new life – at least to write about it – “At least it is an excuse to write with that silver pen” he considered with a smile on his lips.<br />
<br />
He grabbed his leather covered notebook, opened it in a blank page, and filled the old pen with special ink, considering what he should achieve in a very close future, Gary smiled for one moment and then he started writing in his fine handwriting:<br />
<br />
“I am Gary Olsen, 5’8” 31, years old, 142 pounds – In just a week, I’ve not just lost the extra weight I’ve packed during my last trip to Italy, but I actually managed to lose extra five pounds, but I also dropped 3 points of my body fat percentage to the point that I look even better than when I was up to my regular weight – that’s because I’ve lost fat mass and developed muscular mass, reducing my waist size and finally being able to see my own abdominal muscles. I’ve never been this lean in my whole life and I feel better than ever!”<br />
<br />
Those were the silliest lines Gary ever written, feeling like they belonged to some weird “infomercial”, but he did have a good time writing such infantile expectation. Gary closed the notebook, grabbed his key and headed to gym – he should give another “last try” to workout – if he kept fattening like that soon he wouldn’t have any clothes that fit him. Like every previous time, Gary’s body hurt from being unused to exercise, but this time he actually felt a little better, he noticed his pants were normally fitting in less than three days of his new routine, although he was surprised, Olsen concluded it should be caused by the loss of liquid, but just like every other time, since he couldn’t keep his commitment to the gym due to his own laziness, Gary just went a couple of times since he got back to the health club.<br />
<br />
Soon a week passed by, after a nice bath Gary chose his clothing for work when he noticed the leather notebook sitting over his nightstand – “Oh yeah, the infomercial!” – he said grabbing the book to read it, laughing from his expectations – “This is non-sense! Let’s just face the truth” – the dark brown haired man hopped up on the scale just in his briefs, surprisingly it read 142 pounds. Gary couldn’t believe in his own eyes – 142 pounds – precisely.<br />
<br />
“I should go to a casino!” he grinned, getting off the scale, he picked his pants, but there was a problem – they were too baggy around the waist! Gary shook his hand, tied the belt even tighter than usual; picked a shirt, taking a few seconds to look at his own body – it was still the same thin body but he definitely looked leaner, his once flabby muscles now showed a great definition, even his abdominal muscles were noticeable, like he had been a naturally athletic man all his life – “But I only went to the gym two or three times, no way I could have lost all the weight and still get that pump!”<br />
<br />
Gary considered this situation – he knew he hadn’t really put any effort at the gym in the few times he showed, he didn’t diet or cut down the calories in any significant way, he spent most of his day working at the articles. Once more he, got just on his briefs and checked the reading, 142 pounds. Come to think of it, he did look better than never, his now lean built, showed his newly found muscles, the mirror reflected an image Gary would never acknowledge to be his own, but deep inside he knew it was him, a leaner, better built version of him.<br />
<br />
“This is wicked!” The man said once more, sitting on his bed, trying to figure out a possible explanation for all that instant chaos, suddenly, he glanced at the old silver pen – the only different aspect in that whole picture was the fact he wrote such things with that pen. Gary grabbed the pen, without any hesitation he wrote down in the next page of his notebook – “I’ve gained 20 pounds of pure muscle just after I wrote these words”. He wanted to prove his skeptical mind once for all that it was just impossible that such pen could be magic in anyway, because there was no magic, everything deserved a logical explanation…<br />
<br />
But just as soon as he finished writing, Gary felt his body tingling all over, starting by his groin, he felt this sensation spreading all over his body, but different from an erection, the hardening sensation affected his chest, his pectoral muscles, his abdominal muscles, his thighs, his shoulders, his biceps and triceps, that was an extraordinary exciting feeling – each muscle involuntarily flexed, only to grow thicker and harder, his shoulders packed some considerable size, for someone who had always been very scrawny, even Gary’s chest broadened as his body grew more muscular, his once long and thin arms thickened as well, the biceps grew harder and cutter as his triceps engorged the size of his now baseball sized arms. His development got even deeper, giving him an incredibly ripped 6-pack washboard stomach, and his once thin flabby legs now changed into thick vascular thighs and impressive calves – Gary even felt his own butt growing harder as his cheeks contracted hard, to make his once unnoticeable behind a perfect round muscular bubble-butt. Even his slightly curved back adjusted when the intercostals muscles strengthened, his deltoids and lats grew stronger and harder. He changed from a wary skin guy to a muscular athletic man in no more than a couple of minutes, his briefs got even looser around his waist, but now this thick thighs felt uncomfortable in such small boxers.<br />
<br />
Astonished, Gary Olsen still insisted on checking the scale reading, only to attest that he now weighed exact 162 pounds – 20 pounds heavier than just a few minutes ago. The man got off the scale, his image was simply incredible – 5’8” 162 pounds of muscles, each group could be perfectly traced, even when relaxed, the definition and depth of those muscles defied reality, but they were real indeed, they felt strong and hard, Gary couldn’t deny it – his body now had the look and the feeling of a bodybuilder!<br />
<br />
The beauty of the pen once more charmed the stupefied man – if there was an explanation, it had to be that pen, and somehow it had made his wishes come true. Gary once more grabbed his “magic pen” to write down “I just won one million dollars”, and waited for the results – Unlike the muscle gain, nothing happened, which made him conclude, for the time being, that only changes in his body could be possible by that magical instrument. Even though he now looked better than never – Gary knew he still had to work, since no money would come from his new toy, but at least this time he looked forward to getting out of his place – Gary dressed in the best clothes he could find – the trousers and shirt never looked better on him, if they were once baggy, now they fit just like a second skin around his recently developed muscles. Gary adjusted his stance as he felt that even his walk had changed, his now confident posture, the big smile on his lips, he would face life in a different way – a better way, that’s for sure.<br />
<br />
Everyone seemed to notice the changes on Gary, at work all the other colleagues complimented him on his great development, assuming that he’d been working out during his vacations, it was an indescribable sensation for someone who had always tried to hide himself from the public eye – now Gary simply stood tall, showing his impressive magically acquired physique to the world. The commercial time never passed so fast, soon he was about to head home – but why did he have to go straight to home? After all now he had the perfect body to go to a gym! Olsen stopped at a sports fitness store, bought some new clothing to valorize his big hard muscles and necessary gym gadgets, going directly to the town’s most frequented gym, the real temple for physical fitness and bodybuilding, a place he would never dare to enter yesterday, now Gary felt perfectly suitable for such task.<br />
<br />
He did feel like that, at first, but being a 5’8” 162 pounds of hard muscle inside an office is impressive, even walking down the street dressed in tight gym clothing is remarkable to a guy at his size, but another completely different thing is trying to impress someone in that gym – Where the biggest and strongest hardcore bodybuilders trained and struggled daily to establish some kind of unwritten hierarchy, each period had its “big dog”, the guy who everybody respected, usually the biggest guys never trained at the same time, only when a big newcomer wants to establish “his territory”, then during this time, he and the “challenger” try to give the best impression of their strength and muscular size, which frequently causes the “loser” to change his training schedule and avoid another confrontation with the reining “dog”.<br />
<br />
Gary’s new size and strength apparently went straight to his head, but a few minutes inside that heavy duty gym brought him back to reality – In that place he looked good but also ordinary – most of the men who had the guts to train at the same gym the biggest amateurs and professional bodybuilders frequented were just as big, most of the times bigger and much stronger than Gary. The dark brown haired man felt his recent acquired confidence fading away as the bodies got bigger and stronger. Sweat, strength, muscles and hard work really paid off – those men were much more dedicated and focused than Gary could ever imagine – their muscles looked that big without any help from any magic pen – they were the result of true daily struggle and dedication. But instead of feeling bad for “cheating” Gary actually felt even more motivated to go deeper in the possibilities this new world brought to his attention – He always loved the imagery of hard muscular men, but never considered the possibility he could be one of them. Olsen grinned as he applied for full-membership, the attendant was a very good looking buffed hunk, hired to show the candidates that belonging to that gym also meant a commitment to your own body. Gary smiled when the receptionist complimented him on his physique – “Thanks, I’m always looking for improvement!” he replied handling back the application form all filled up.<br />
<br />
After that, Gary just went to the locker room, grabbed the notebook with his secret magic pen and locked himself at a vacant stall. Sat on the toilet, Gary considered what he should try this time, the evil grin showed he was up to something very interesting:<br />
<br />
“When I get out of this stall, I’ll be 30 pounds heavier in perfect muscular form, my muscles smooth and incredibly veined, and I’ll have the strength of 3 huge powerlifters, so that my workout cargos will be simply mind blowing, each time I finish one set, I’ll be slightly bigger and more muscular, so once I finish my work out I’ll be 20 pounds heavier than when I left this stall”<br />
<br />
The beginning of a magical growth spurt was definitely an unforgettable feeling – the tingling sensation spreading all over his body, getting more and more intense as it builds up bringing all your muscles into a frenzy of power and strength – Gary looked down at his own chest, noticing how fast his pecs engorged, his nipples thickened and grew bigger, his abs got even deeper and stronger, his legs grew massively muscular, his shoulders widened, his arms swallowed, the veins over his growing muscles thickened, the growth increased as Gary felt the cramps reaching his calves and butt, he could feel his butt readjusting to the new fibers, his calves growing very impressive, even his delts and lats now pressed the new gym clothing he bought. Olsen felt something different this time, he could feel his muscles “burning” but not in a painful sensation, he could feel them becoming thicker but yet, they were growing stronger, he could just tell, it was like everything became easier and lighter, he just felt he could do much more than his already big muscles showed. Gary flexed his growing body, making it look even harder and more impressive, the growth accelerated, the muscles packed with new massive size as his held his breath, letting it go in a loud growl, Gary laughed at his new behavior, he was definitely enjoying becoming a muscular man.<br />
<br />
The third stall in the men’s locker room opened at once, an incredibly muscular man got out of there, all pumped and glistening from hard work. His winning smile shone as he faced the other guys in there –Gary said nothing, just kept his grin, proceeded to the mirror, checked his newly-grown muscles for the first time, he loved the fact that he could change so much in such short time, he flexed each muscle and felt its hardness and power. The guys tried to pretend they weren’t noticing that, but Gary didn’t care – he now was a 5’8” 192-soon-to-be-even bigger-pounds muscle stud with the strength of three huge powerlifters. He would have the work-out of his life! He just turned around carefully kept the notebook and the pen inside the gym bag, making sure he took it along with him, as left for the weight area he just stopped by the door, looked back to the puzzled guys, hit a most muscular pose and yelled &quot;TIME TO PUMP SOME IRON!!!&quot; - Gary left the room laughing from his own attitude. He would really have the work out of his life.</p>
