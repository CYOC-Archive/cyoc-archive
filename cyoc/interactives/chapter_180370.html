<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wes meanwhile just hoped that Bryan was not getting into any trouble for skipping school like that. He himself wouldn&#39;t skip school at all - he liked to think he could eventually get a perfect attendance trophy. Even though he had grown more muscular, and indeed &quot;more like Ross&quot;, the core of what made Wes who he was it seemed was not changing. He did admit though as he walked to his PE class that it had been kind of odd. He really enjoyed moving over to kiss Bryan on the cheek like that, but he also found he had enjoyed fucking that delinquent girl. If this was supposed to be making him &quot;like Ross&quot;...<br />
<br />
Hm, something to consider later. For now Wes had to make sure he got to his class!<br />
<br />
Before this, Wes had been ill at ease with PE, owing to his poor bodily condition. He had decent strength, but he couldn&#39;t run very well, and he often ended the day utterly exhausted and dealing with his legs feeling like they were on fire. But now, with Wes being as buff as he was, he saw no reason to be quite so afraid of PE. Rather, he was actually starting to look forward to it. He beamed as he walked, looking forward to whether this would be a day where they went outside for a workout, or hit the school weight training facility up.<br />
<br />
Wes ran a hand through his hair as he heard some girls gossiping and checking him out as he walked. He couldn&#39;t help but overhear; &quot;Hey isn&#39;t that Wes? Like, Oh My God! He&#39;s so hot! And have you seen him touching Bryan like that? It&#39;s so cute! Do you know if he&#39;s gay or bi?&quot; &quot;No idea, Cheryl. But I heard he&#39;s still up.&quot; &quot;Really!? I mean, can you imagine having a guy who can bring another guy into bed with him? INSTANT boyfriend material.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Wes feel...honestly kind of mixed. He loved that he was desired, and in fact made him feel so hyped up on that he could feel his manhood getting a little bit aroused, pressing against his jeans, but it also made him think of Bryan. Would Bryan still be up for that kind of thing? He seemed kind of nervous about that kind of thing now. Did something happen with Bryan that Wes hadn&#39;t heard about or realized?<br />
<br />
Hm, well, from now on maybe he should invite Bryan along for any hook ups. It just seemed like the friendly thing to do considering how Bryan was.<br />
<br />
By the time Wes arrived at the locker room to get dressed into his PE clothes, he remembered that his clothes would be kind of tight...and he hadn&#39;t fully calmed down from that episode earlier. He gulped a little, and then shook his head, &quot;Ah, what am I worried so much about? I&#39;m bigger than some of the jocks here!&quot; He proceeded inside and found his locker, near the back, where he typically got dressed and undressed not far away from Bryan.<br />
<br />
But today Bryan was gone, and Wes was left looking around. He hadn&#39;t remembered who else he had this class with due to the way things were now. But when he did check, he found himself looking across an aisle of lockers and seeing Ross getting dressed near a couple of other jocks. He and the other footballers in this class typically had specialized PE circuits made for them due to their needs for their sport. Hence why Wes probably didn&#39;t much remember seeing him around.<br />
<br />
As the crowds started to clear out a bit, the other jocks heading out, it was obvious Ross noticed Wes. Both the fact he hadn&#39;t changed clothes yet - and the fact Wes still had an erection sticking up in the front of his pants. &quot;Woah man! Wes? That you buddy? Damn, I thought you had potential before, but damn. You really muscled up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wes couldn&#39;t help but notice the fact that Ross was dressed only in his small size PE shorts - standing there a muscled bastion of masculinity. Wes gulped - he was reacting now to Ross in the same way he reacted when that girl made advances on him. His dick gave a decided jerk of interest. &quot;Y-Yeah, just been really keeping an eye on my health lately. You know how it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I do. And I heard you and Bryan did some experimentation. That true?&quot; Ross said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...uhh. It&#39;s...&quot; Wes started, blushing pretty intensely, looking Ross over, &quot;We just...y&#39;know, tried it out. Just to see what works and what doesn&#39;t.&quot; Wes wondered why he was reacting this way - did he need to do that kind of a thing again with Bryan? Or...or with Ross?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, testin&#39; the waters.&quot; Ross looked around and leaned in, &quot;I can tell you&#39;re pretty high strung. How about we unwind you a little bit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ross suddenly moved in and kissed Wes on the lips, gently at first and then incrementally getting more passionate. Wes for his part blushed, almost moaned, and leaned into the kiss. Fuck he was so full of need these days...! Before Ross could react much more to this, Wes suddenly grabbed him by the hip and shoulder and pressed the jock against the wall of the locker room, kissing him much more intensely. With even greater need.<br />
<br />
Wes barely even realized what he was doing - he was acting entirely on need. Fuck. He fucked that girl out there and---and now, he wanted to fuck Ross just the same way. &quot;Dude...&quot; Wes finally got out between kisses, &quot;I wanna fuck...&quot;<br />
<br />
Even though he could tell Ross was getting just as aroused, going by the way he was going into this just as well, Ross managed to regain control and shook his head, &quot;Dude, control...control. We&#39;re due for class. People&#39;d get pretty damn upset if they went looking for us and found us banging away in here. Tell ya what. I&#39;ll talk it over with Diego, and see what we can do after class. That okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wes - after hearing that - realized what he was doing and calmed down. He breathed and backed off, &quot;Woah...woah...sorry about that man. Sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all good, just kinda surprised me is all. Damn, you&#39;re a monster when you get worked up enough.&quot; Ross lightly punched Wes&#39; shoulder, &quot;Now let&#39;s get dressed for PE. Before Coach gets tired of waiting for our slow asses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wes went back to his aisle of lockers and managed to cool his jets. What the hell was that? With control restored to him and no longer acting on his carnal needs, Wes realized he had almost well fucked Ross right then and there right before class! Definitely not what was in their plan. Well, at least he could say due to what happened that he could have sex with women. So maybe it wasn&#39;t entirely changing his sexuality - more broadening it. That was a theory he needed to think on.<br />
<br />
Wes got dressed in his PE clothes and sighed. They were made for someone with a much different build than him now. And so they were quite tight - and even more showy than Ross&#39; own choices in size of clothes ended up being. He just hoped nothing else happened here.<br />
<br />
As Wes headed out shortly after Ross, the Coach looked at them and shook his head, &quot;Well, my two biggest men seem to be the slowest. I won&#39;t log you as late this time, but I&#39;ll have you two do two extra laps around the track before going in for your workout today in the weight room.&quot; Wes looked down guiltily, figuring it was his fault owing to that episode he had.<br />
<br />
But when he and Ross joined the others running around the track, he found himself able to run with a greater ease than he ever had before. It was like even though he was still pretty heavy, he could carry himself a lot better. And honestly, he could enjoy this. Running in his clothes like this kind of felt oddly enjoyable. By the time he was half done, his clothes were streaked with sweat and clinging to him. He found himself gaining on Ross, who seemed a bit distracted by something about Wes.<br />
<br />
Once the two ended their longer run, Wes grinned as he stood by, looking at Ross, &quot;Hey, looks like I got better at running now too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my man, it did help that I was kinda distracted. Something&#39;s...up, dude.&quot; Ross looked at Wes, scanning him once and then twice, &quot;Couldn&#39;t really concentrate when I noticed...&quot;</p>
