<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ann sighed as she gazed at her computer. It had been a long week at work. After an eventful Thanksgiving Ann returned on Monday with renewed energy and motivation. Unfortunately, as the week wore on she quickly became disheartened as petty office politics and an end of the year report now had her working late.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh,&quot; Ann sighed. &quot;I just got back from vacation and I need another one. Maybe I seriously should start looking into something else.&quot; A knock on her office door caused Ann to wearily call the person in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to bother you Ms. O&#39;Toole.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann smiled wearily as her secretary Megan entered. &quot;That&#39;s okay Megan,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Just trying to finish these reports before the afternoon board meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan nodded, brushing a stray brunette hair out of her eyes.  &quot;Understandable,&quot; she said, laying several reports on Ann&#39;s desk. &quot;Which reminds me Stephanie was here earlier. She was asking a bunch of questions about how your report was coming. &quot;<br />
<br />
Ann groaned as she now thought about Stephanie Marsh. The woman was Ann&#39;s rival at the company. Stephanie had recently been primites to the board, becoming its youngest member at 36. The curvy, raven haired woman was a bully and classic mean girl, useing her d cup breasts, classical beauty, and flirtatious ways to try an usurp Ann&#39;s position with the CEO, George McIntyre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope she didn&#39;t bother you too much Megan,&quot; Ann said with concern.  Megan shook her head before smiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m used to her nastiness at this point,&quot; she smirked. &quot;You know how she is, always wearing a business suit a size to small and sticking her chest out. After a couple of backhanded comments from her I kind of tuned her out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably for the best,&quot; Ann said. &quot;Stephanie is just insecure and power hungry. Mr. McIntyre is on to her games so she wont be anyones boss anytime soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god,&quot; Megan sighed. &quot;Shes like....such a bitch and a poopy head to boot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann paused as Megans words registered in her head. Slowly she looked up from her work to gaze at her assistant. &quot;Megan you feeling okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
The young brunette was now twirling her brunette hair playfully as she looked at Ann. Rubbing her eyes Ann looked at the 28 year old. For some reason Megan looked different. The womans juvenile mannerisms seemed out of place while her blouse and skirt seemed somewhat ill fitting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like feel fine,&quot; Megan said in a bubbly tone. &quot;Im like so totally ready for the weekend though. Hey! Maybe you and me can have a sleepover or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann began to worry as she looked at the woman. Megan looked more like a collegw student than a professional woman in her late 20s. &quot;We&#39;ll have to wait an see,&quot; she said cautiously. &quot;For now Megan why dont you take a break. You look tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan squealed in delight before skipping out of the office. Ann watched her go anxiously, becoming lost in thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did she start getting younger,&quot; she thought nervously. Ann shook her head rubbing her eyes. It couldn&#39;t be, Katie and Gloria were back at school and their was no way wither would use their magic on her when she was working. Shrugging it off Ann glanced at the clock before returning to her work.<br />
<br />
At 1 p.m. Ann finished her reports and began to sort them. The board was going to be meeting in 15 minutes to discuss the quarterly reports of the company. Thankfully for Ann she had done great work for the company and was ready to present them. She knew once she presented her reportss McIntyre would be happy. Hopefully she could leverage that into a bonus or even a much needed extended vacation. Exiting her office she gazed around the floor at her employees.<br />
<br />
Something was different about her subordinates as she looked them all over. The men and women that worked for her seemed different. Ann noticed everyone seemed alot fresher, the grave faces of adulthood replaced with energetic youthful faces. Ann also noticed that thwie clothing seemed somewhat baggier, too many people seemed to be adjusting loose skirts and pants or adjusting their seats. Finally Ann could see how they were acting.<br />
<br />
Instead of adults doimg office work, Ann had an impression that she had just walked into a study hall. Employees were engaged in idol gossip or playing games with eachother. Ann watched as a group of three women giggled secretly as they gazed at a handsome man playing paper football. Ann blinked momentarily, stunned by their actions. These people not only seemed to be acting younger they looked younger too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get a hold of yourself Ann,&quot; she thought. Quickly rifling through her purse she pulled out a compact and looked herself over. <br />
<br />
The face in the mirror still looked like an adult. As she critically judged her appeaarance she became worried. Perhaps it was her imagination but she appeared fresher. The fine lines weren&#39;t as pronounced as before. &quot;Stop thinking like this,&quot; she thought. :Your still an adult and so is everyone else, you just have ageing on your mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the board meeting got underway Ann looked at the other board members. Their were 12 members on the board, of which Ann was the fourth highest member. Stephanie, the newest member, was seen as a fast riser and viewed Ann as her chief rival. As Ann made her presentation Stephanie would go out of her way to question Ann&#39;s numbers and reports. Ann had prepared for this, quickly able to counter any criticism.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastic Ann,&quot; McIntyre said happily. &quot;You really did some great work this quarter.&quot; Ann grinned as she looked at the 78 year old man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sir,&quot; she said. &quot;The people in my department deserve alot of credit. I wouldnt of been able to do this without them.&quot;<br />
<br />
McIntyre nodded as Ann now took her seat. She smirked as she saw the sour look criss Stephanies face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well things seem very promising,&quot; McIntyre said. &quot;Now on to new business and it is quite important. We need to decide on the theme for the seventh grade winter dance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann&#39;s eyes went wide as she now looked at the other board members. Looking at the 10 men and 2 women Ann could clearly see they all appeared younger. The mens grey hairs and lines appeared to have vanished while their suits seemed slightly baggy on their diminishing frames. Looking at Stephanie she was shocked to see the professional raven haired woman looking more like a high school senior. Slowly Ann turned towards McIntyre and gasped.<br />
<br />
McIntyre now appeared to be at least 30 years younger. The mans receding grey hair was now back to its original brown, while the wrinkles she had grown accustomed too had been wiped away.  As she watched the board more closely she could see them all growing progressively younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you will excuse me for a moment Mr. McIntyre theirs something I need to attend to for a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; a now 45 year old McIntyre sighed. &quot;But be quick, were going to play 7 up in a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann rushed from her quickly youthening board members and made her way into a nearby bathroom. She now found herself hyperventilating. As she looked over her appearance she cursed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap Im getting younger too.&quot;<br />
<br />
While older than the others, Ann could clearly see she was now 10 years youmger than she should be. Umlike the other though Ann was not becoming mentally younger, however, she worried if it was only a matter of time before she began to mentally grow younger.<br />
<br />
Ann now fumbled through her ourse searching for her cellphone. She was goimg to need some magical help. Dialing a number Ann now waited for an answer.</p>
