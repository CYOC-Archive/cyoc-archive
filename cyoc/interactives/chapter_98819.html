<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frances did escort Harry and Jenny out as their session finished. It had provided Frances with a good starting point to work with Jenny&#39;s mental healing. Though Jenny&#39;s prime concerns were a bit of a surprise. In many cases where incomplete transformations required therapy the issues usually revolved around the one that had transformed them. Either on attacks by the transforming were or battling with it. It often created problems when the cause of a transformation being incomplete was an accident and that the transformation was planned between lovers, though Jenny&#39;s case was the were that transformed her was a rogue. That made Jenny&#39;s concerns being more with her family being a bit of a surprise, though at the same time, the concerns were certainly valid. Tough parents were always difficult to deal with.<br />
<br />
&quot;They look good together,&quot; Rudy commented as they left, making Frances smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;They do indeed,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;though... we&#39;ll likely have plenty of work ahead to help her settle into to things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rudy nodded and then turned to manila envelope on the counter. Stamped on the envelop was the Moon Lake hospital&#39;s address. He lifted it and held it out to Frances. She paused to look at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;This came in for you while they were in their session, Frances,&quot; Rudy spoke politely as he handed her the envelope.<br />
<br />
Frances took it and noted that it came from the hospital. She figured it was probably the test results that would give her some answer to what was wrong with Yvette. Knowing that meeting with Yvette to begin her psychological evaluation was the next big appointment for the day, she thanked Rudy and took the envelope and took it into her office area. She sat down quietly in her chair and ran one finger under the adhesive that held the envelope shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... let&#39;s see what&#39;s wrong with you physically,&quot; Frances sighed as she also remembered the odd request of Yvette asking for her and then followed by her declaration of being a lesbian or at least bi as a result of completing Jenny&#39;s transformation.<br />
<br />
The first set of papers were the exact tests carried out from the first set. They marked Yvette&#39;s hormone levels, her blood type, and just about everything one would be able to expect from blood tests. Frances recognized a few of them in that they related to were-beast reproduction. Female were-beasts were highly fertile in that it was actually easier for them to get pregnant than normal human women and that they went through a heat cycle, that while it went once a month like humans, it carried the same drive to mate as it did with the animals were-beasts were based off of. Male were-beasts were also more potent than human males, though with Yvette&#39;s case, male fertility wasn&#39;t an issue. Some of the numbers didn&#39;t fully look right to Frances, but she had to admit to herself that her specialization was in mental health. She couldn&#39;t be fully sure on whether or not the numbers were wrong or not.<br />
<br />
The next set were from the tests that Frances herself had ordered after the meeting with Yvette. Her reasoning for these tests was to actually see if completing Jenny&#39;s transformation had actually caused a physical change in Yvette, simply because Yvette&#39;s declaration of being a lesbian or at least bi was so odd. Werecat transformations had the potential to change sexuality in normals, but werecats were all female and had a history of being at least bisexual, like Martha, if not lesbians, like herself and Samantha. Geneticists had never been able to how the werecat transformation could effect normal sexuality, but then at the same time, Frances knew that normal sexuality wasn&#39;t something that could be explained genetically. To do so would give the implication that people were born with the sexuality that they had, logic would then state that only heterosexuality would exist in order for species, be they were-beasts or normal humans, to perpetuate themselves, as the knowledge of artificial insemination was a 20th century development.<br />
<br />
Regardless of that, Yvette and Jenny were werefoxes, and the werefox transformation had never been known to change sexuality, and even if it had, why would it change Yvette&#39;s sexuality and not Jenny&#39;s? Frances couldn&#39;t know for sure based on the numbers alone, but she wanted to make sure she knew as much as she could before really digging into Yvette&#39;s mind. If she didn&#39;t know enough based on Yvette&#39;s biology, she was fearful that her own biases might lead her into asking questions that would set to a predetermined outcome. Frances knew she might not intend to do that, but if she did know that at times imbalances of hormones or other sorts of biological problems could lead to behaviors easily mistaken for psychological traumas. She didn&#39;t want to make a decision or ask any question without all the proper information, which she hoped these test results would give.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re the same,&quot; Frances said slowly as looked at the second set of test results. They showed nothing different from the first set of tests. It meant  that there hadn&#39;t been any real change after completing Jenny. She wanted to crumple of the paper in frustration , but knew she would need them for her own references and there was still the note from the hospital&#39;s lab staff to explain the test results. She set the results down on her desk, and they actually lay on top of the keyboard to her computer. She then pulled out the last slip of paper that was the note from the hospital staff.<br />
<br />
The note read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor Frances Twist:<br />
<br />
In looking through both sets of test on the subject, Yvette Smith, we could find several issues in her system. Chief among them would an excess of estrogen in her system, which could cause mood swings, anxious depression, migraine headaches, and foggy thinking. We&#39;ve also detected signs of over-active ovaries leading to a shorter period of time between her periods of being in heat and possibly making her periods of being in heat more pressing than it normally is for any were-beast. We also detected a slight progesterone deficiency, which can cause anxiety, cyclical headaches, and infertility. There are other potential signs and symptoms of these, but for the most part they were not noted during the examination of the subject and the symptoms mentioned are the ones we think are the most likely based on what we know of the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances sighed, but figured that could make sense. From what she knew, Yvette had been trying to get herself pregnant, but had largely failed, and mood swings and &quot;foggy thinking&quot; could explain her initial obsession with William Anderson and her sudden switch after Jenny&#39;s transformation was completed. However, they didn&#39;t outright say that these deficiencies or excesses would drive a were to not only obsess over a normal that showed no romantic interest in the were, but to also act on that obsession. Frances only kept reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, with these issues, I cannot say that they are the reason that Yvette Smith chose to obsess over the normal, now werefox, William Anderson. Not on their own, anyway. While I would leave the evaluation of her mind to you, I would think that the case with Yvette Smith is a perfect storm of medical and mental problems. For while her medical issues may not have caused her to target William Anderson, they could very well have driven her to be as sexually forward as she has been described and clouded her judgement. This likely reinforced any and all mental issues she had going into this whole affair, and they where what helped her chose her William Anderson to be her chosen mate.<br />
<br />
Hopefully these tests and my judgement on them provide you with the information you need to perform her psychological evaluation. Please let me or a member of my staff know if any further tests are needed.<br />
<br />

<br />
Frances sighed at that, but it did support her theory that Yvette&#39;s actions had more to do with her mind than with anything in her blood. While she pondered over the questions she would ask of Yvette in her evaluation of the rogue werefox, Frances picked up her phone and dialed a number. She got a very familiar answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up, hun?&quot; came Samantha&#39;s voice on the other end of the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just got through with Jennifer Harper&#39;s first session, and it went well,&quot; Frances reported, &quot;I&#39;d think she&#39;s adjusting okay and even enjoying being Harry Jenkins&#39; werevixen...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sense a but coming,&quot; Samantha sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s afraid of how her family and friends from Alabama will react to the new her,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;not what I expected as her main fear... but it might be something she&#39;s consciously concerned with at present... given her upcoming wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Halloween, I believe is the date that she and her fiancee have planned,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;I take it that family of the bride will be coming to Moon Lake for the ceremony?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t ask, but that&#39;s probable,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;which could very well complicate matters regarding Moon Lake&#39;s secrecy and Jenny&#39;s safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would they be hostile to us?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t say for sure... but based on what Jenny told me, they certainly won&#39;t respond well to Jenny&#39;s new figure and that learning about the real reason for that figure may not go well,&quot; Frances sighed, &quot;which will mean the Moon Lake guests will need to be on their BEST behavior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Samantha answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Including us,&quot; Frances told her wife.<br />
<br />
Frances thought she heard a sound of coughing on the other end of the line, and hoped Samantha hadn&#39;t been shocked into doing a spit-take.<br />
<br />
&quot;WE are on the guest list?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I was told,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;but that isn&#39;t an issue so much as it is the potential reaction from the parents of the bride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Samantha commented, &quot;is there anything else?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;I did get the test results on Yvette Smith... they are pretty much what I expected. She has some problems... too much estrogen, overactive ovaries, and a slight progesterone deficiency... but they aren&#39;t enough by themselves to have caused her actions. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve gotten a copy, as has the DA... but I thought I&#39;d let you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the hospital sent test results to City Hall, I haven&#39;t seen them,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;but then I had my own crisis meeting this morning, so the mayor might have gotten it... or haven&#39;t gotten to my own mail, yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did your meeting go?&quot; Frances asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rather well,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;definitely seemed interested in were-beasts. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have a problem with him. Anyway, I&#39;ve got some other stuff to get to. Thank you for the update, hun.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Samantha and Frances both hung up.</p>
