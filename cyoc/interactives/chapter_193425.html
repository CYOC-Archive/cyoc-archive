<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gaz opened his genie mouth and said &quot;Dude, you don&#39;t even have to stay out here. We could always have some fun with the people inside one of these buildings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carter looked a bit surprised at Gaz. The road they were on was apartment blocks and offices. &quot;But we can&#39;t just walk into someone&#39;s home and start fucking with them. I mean, they&#39;d just call the cops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gaz gave Carter a quizzical look. Ryan laughed &quot;Sometimes you&#39;re really dumb hun. It&#39;s a good thing you&#39;re pretty.&quot; He said, running his finger down Ryan&#39;s cleavage cleft, which was exposed by his low hanging top. &quot;We have Gaz, and Gaz can do anything, isn&#39;t that right Gaz?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gaz grinned, &quot;Practically anything, so get wishing already you horny stud.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan blushed before spotting a taxi pull up and he watched a businessman get out of the cab. This guy had obviously let himself go through a stressful business career, but he held himself confidently and walked toward an office block with determination in his stride.<br />
<br />
Carter couldn&#39;t help verbalising &quot;I wish that guy had been as addicted to working out as he has been to making money.&quot; Gaz said &quot;Granted&quot; and the guys reality was re-written in seconds. Gaz liked really big bodybuilders, and so the was the lens with which he interpreted this wish. The guys watched his flabby middle suck deep into his shirt, his posture shifted as his shoulders broadened and his fat ass firmed up. His face lost its double chin and his skin tightened around a very attractive square jaw. His obsession with money now revealed and only rivalled by his obsession for the gym.<br />
<br />
Ryan said &quot;And I wish his suit hugged his big muscles, leaving very little to the imagination.&quot; Gaz muttered &quot;Granted&quot; and his suit became perfectly tailored, tightening to reveal every bulge, every mound of muscle, each perfectly formed cheek.<br />
<br />
Carter said &quot;I wish we were invisible to everyone inside that block, and I wish they couldn&#39;t hear us.&quot; With a smirk Gaz once again spoke &quot;Granted&quot; and they walked into the reception without any challenge.<br />
<br />
They watched the businessman approach the male secretary who was a pretty average build, mousy brown hair, in his mid-twenties, an easy guy to ignore.<br />
<br />
He looked up at the impressively built man and sucked in his breath at the intimidating display of power that this man exuded. &quot;Welcome to Mortimer&#39;s Manufacturing, how can I help.&quot; The receptionist spoke in his tenor voice, trying to deepen it to feel any semblance of being male in the presence of this god of a man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here to see Mr Mortimer&quot; the man rumbled with his deep bassy timbre.<br />
<br />
Ryan whispered, &quot;I wish Mr sexy’s last name was Dick and no-one would challenge him on it, but take him completely seriously.”<br />
<br />
Gaz said loudly “You don’t need to whisper master, but sure, Granted” Of course Gaz added a new first name as well.<br />
<br />
“The names Hughe Dick.” Hughe said, with an emphasis on his first name.<br />
<br />
The name wasn’t lost on the receptionist, but he didn’t challenge the guy, nor did it occur to him that this was anything other than the name his parents gave him at birth.<br />
<br />
Carter said cheekily “I wish Hughe’s Dick lives up to his name and its always obscenely visible in his pants.”<br />
<br />
Hughe moaned as his cock thickened and lengthened to an obscene 11” soft.<br />
<br />
Ryan elbowed him in the ribs “Dude, his cocks too big for any use now. Gaz, what are you playing at? I wish Dick’s cock is both fuckable and suckable. I mean, we can’t leave a guy without the ability to have sex. That would be immoral!”<br />
<br />
Gaz said, “Granted” and nothing seemed to happen. Hughe’s penis stayed at its unnaturally large 11” soft shape which was evident through the thin material of his pants.<br />
<br />
Ryan turned on Gaz, “What’s the deal man. You said you’d grant my wish but nothing’s changed.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you wanted me to change him did you?” Gaz said in mock shock, “I just made it so that anyone who goes to blow him or ride him would find their body permanently adapting to accommodate his tool. Was that not what you wanted?” His eyes now playfully taunting Ryan.<br />
<br />
<br />
“But wouldn’t that then leave the men who he fucks always lusting after freakishly massive cocks?” Ryan asked, and Gaz only answered with a sly grin.<br />
<br />
Carter said “I’ve got to see this. I wish the receptionist makes a pass at him right now.”<br />
<br />
Gaz grinned again “Granted” with no intention of making the receptionist gay at this moment.<br />
<br />
The receptionist, who’s eyes were still on the intimidating Hughe, found his eyes trailing down the man’s titanic body. He didn’t even think it was possible to see a well-built man’s pecs through a jacket, but somehow this guys clothes seemed to reveal all. As a straight guy, the most he’d ever done was appreciate particularly handsome guys, but he’d never spent so long eyeing a bloke up before.<br />
<br />
“Well, are you going to show me up to Mr Mortimer or are you going to keep undressing me in your faggot mind?” Hughe was obviously straight to, and didn’t appreciate the unwanted attention.<br />
<br />
Carter looked pissed “And after all we’ve done for him, to berate our boy like that. I wish Hughe only plays the straight hunk to intimidate and humiliate men to turn them on. I wish that when Hughe belittles most men, they start to become more beta, and more open to being fucked around by him. I wish only the strongest men physically and mentally can retort and rebuff his insults, and those who do are the only ones who will top this fuck hound. I wish Hughe is exclusively a man’s man and enjoys toying with smaller guys.”<br />
<br />
The receptionist couldn’t help himself. He knew he was straight, but he also knew his heart was racing as he was disrespected by this client. He couldn’t help but be slightly turned on by the insult.<br />
“Look Mr Dick, I’m not a faggot, but you are an incredibly attractive man.” He stood up and walked round the desk to face Hughe.<br />
“I’ve never seen anyone like you before and I’m finding it hard to concentrate. You don’t mind if I touch your muscle do you?” He placed his left hand on Hughe’s right pec and with used his right hand to squeeze Hughe’s Anaconda which spasmed at the touch of his hand.<br />
<br />
The mid-twenties guy was struggling to reconcile what was happening with his feelings. He knew he didn’t want anything sexual to happen between them, but his body seemed to be telling him something different.<br />
<br />
“You’re a slutty little gay boy, and you know it.” Hughe spat at the younger man grabbing a handful of his hair. “We’re going into that empty office in there and you’ll enjoy my sucking me off you little pervert.”<br />
<br />
Something shifted in the young man’s mind. If his body was enjoying this so much, maybe he was a bit gay?<br />
<br />
Carter spoke out “Gaz, I wish we could see and hear everything that happens in that office.” And to two men and the genie, it appeared as if there was no wall between them and the interior of the office.<br />
<br />
The receptionist felt himself pushed and shoved into the small office, and then he was released by the titan, and he scuttled to close the blinds and lock the door of the small office. He pushed the table against the wall to make space for the two of them, and as soon as the furniture was rearranged, Hughe shoved his the dudes head down and he felt his knees buckle. Without any foreplay, Hughe released his growing junk and slapped the young guys face with his club three or four times, before lining his growing 13”er and sliding it in.<br />
<br />
The guy kneeling panicked as he couldn’t see how such a thick shaft could even enter his mouth, and he considered that breathing would be impossible unless through his nose, not to mention the assault on his throat. But to his surprise, his mouth opened wide enough and Hughe’s cock slid in its entirety passed his oesophagus and down his throat which thickened, expanding his neck permanently.<br />
<br />
But Hughe’s cock wasn’t at full thickness nor length yet, and as it swelled inside the 20’s throat, his neck grew to accommodate him. There was no gag reflex for this dude anymore.<br />
<br />
He looked a little clumsy until Ryan said “I wish all guys that Hughe fucks become pros at using the orifice which he owns to pleasure men.” Gaz always smiled at wishes like this and spoke “Granted” as the lad with the bull neck became expert at sucking huge cock, and his career changed with it. Part of his job at the firm now included being a professional cock sucker.<br />
<br />
Hughe pounded the young guys mouth for 15 minutes before emptying his load down the receptionists unusually swollen neck. Thick reams of jissm continued to fill his gut from the impossibly sexy man leaving the younger man panting and sweating in his shirt. Hughe, for the first time since entering the dude, was gentle in handling his cock now. He didn’t want any drop of cum to exist outside of this dudes body, and as he unsheathed his shaft from the throat, he made sure to tickle every wall of his breathing passage, sending waves of pleasure through the cocksucker.<br />
<br />
With a great effort, he managed to restrain his slowly diminishing cock into his pants, 16”s clearly on show. Then he looked at the exhausted receptionist and spoke condescendingly “So are you going to show me to Mr Mortimer or am I going to be late?”<br />
<br />
As the dishevelled young man got up and led Mr Dick to the elevator, Carter grabbed Ryan and slammed him into the wall. His own lust getting the better of him as he made out with his husband.</p>
