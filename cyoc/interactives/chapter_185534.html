<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No no no no no, that&#39;s for later dear!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both women yelped in surprise before turning around, finding that their goddess had decided not to bother with waiting for them. It was probably a good thing, too, as Mallory had been proving to be stronger than expected in her efforts to drag Kayla over to the pool full of beckoning people. Saved from some horrible orgy of sin and decadence - perhaps Lilith was less inclined than Kayla had believed to force the knight into lustful situations.<br />
<br />
Well, that possibility vanished Lilith grasped both their hands, and an electric tingle traveled up Kayla&#39;s arm. The knight quivered visibly, drawing an amused glance from the goddesss before she addressed her champions further. &quot;Trust me, we&#39;ll get to the group stuff later, but right now you two need to get the one-on-one handled. Come along now, we&#39;ve much to do!&quot; <br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t any resisting for either woman as Lilith hurried them down the polished black streets, winding through crowded thoroughfares thick with an atmosphere of desire. Kayla had once heard that such places as these streets were a den of devilry, places where the darkest of evil forces drove men and women to engaged in unspeakable acts of indecency. Such acts were right on the streets, in the form of people engaging in sexual activities right in broad daylight... and yet she could not sense any demonic or evil presence anywhere. How was that possible?<br />
<br />
So many questions burned in her mind as Lilith led them into a grandiose temple, a place of white marble and shining gold that stretched into the sky, putting to shame even the grandest cathedral in Averan. Mallory had the glint of a thief in her eye as she studied the numerous golde and bejewled decorations inside, but she was forced to keep her hands to herself for now, only able to dream of walking out of here with a fortune&#39;s worth of divine valuables.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a pretty extreme solution, but your world is a bit fucked, and not in the fun way,&quot; Lilith explained as she brought her two little crusaders deep inside the temple, past a conregational hall that seemed to stretch to infinity and into the most inner sanctum. Behind a door of shining steel blessed by the goddess herself, lined with plates of platinum and trim of whitened silver, the two were brought within a warm chamber dominated by a lavish, heart-shaped bed, its crimson sheets of the purest silk fit for a king.<br />
<br />
The goddess motioned for them to stand before the centerpiece of the room, a pillar of pure white marble around which danced thousands of mystical runes, glowing in a rainbow of colors. &quot;You see this, girls?&quot; She asked, jabbing a thumb at the pillar. &quot;What you&#39;re looking at is the one big support column holding up life itself. Anything that&#39;s ever been and ever will be, all that you love, all that you know, creation itself - it&#39;s built upon this one little bit of marble.&quot; She paused. &quot;Well. Metaphorically speaking, it&#39;s... it&#39;s not literally a marble pillar, but... look, if I showed you what it really is, your eyes would melt out of your heads. Which would be a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kayla&#39;s eyes briefly darted to Mallory - the other woman was transfixed on the column. &quot;Anyway - the air in ehre, it&#39;s... well, when I was making the universe, let&#39;s just say I never cleaned out the stains I put in the carpet.&quot; She giggled. &quot;That warmth you&#39;re feeling? That&#39;s the same feeling I had when I created reality, imbued into this room and now being echoed within both of you.&quot; She stpped back towards the door, smiling to the two women before closing up behind herself with one final statement. &quot;I think you&#39;ll be able to figure things out from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the goddess sealed them within this chamber, Kayla found her own mind fixating on the feeling Lilith had referenced. It was growing stronger by the second, emanating out from the column that Mallory now took a single step towrads. A feeling that ought to have been more familiar to her than it truly was - <i>love</i>. Pure, unconditional, adoring love, the sort that rejuvenated even the most aching of hearts. Pure, unbridled affection for all living things, bringing with it an understanding and desire to comfort. The same love that had coursed through the veins of the goddess as she created the universe - it now permeated into both women.<br />
<br />
The paladin stood, wandering nearer to Mallory as the assassin came to a stop in front of the pillar. They both stood there, motionless, for a few moments... before she looked down to find that tears were streaming down the other woman&#39;s face. &quot;So many lives...&quot; A small gasp of shock left her mouth. &quot;So many people I... killed... people who were loved...&quot; The guilt was evident in her face as the magnitude of every wrong she had ever committed was made plain to her. For a moment, Kayla thought her own tears might flow at the sight; the disdain she held for this woman vanished as she came to realize the enormity of what now dragged down upon her soul.<br />
<br />
Kayla carried no guilt herself - but now, bathed in the love of the goddess, she found her own heart was heavy with something else. Emptiness. All her life, she had dedicated herself to nothing more than to be a pefect envoy of Lilith, and in return, she knew that the goddess had showered a great deal of affection onto her. Yet her arms had remained empty, her body untouched, her needs unfulfilled. The love of the goddess was a powerful thing, but in the end, it could not satisfy all the needs and desires of mortals - and this, she realized, was by design. Only mortals could sustain other mortals - and thus, if they wished to survive, they would be forced to rely upon one another.<br />
<br />
The eyes of Mallory and Kayla met, and an understanding was instantly formed. An assassin, brought to realize the horrors of what she had done, was in need of forgiveness; a paladin, lonely her entire life, desperately required to at last know the gentle touch of another. Two people who were exactly what the other needed. Without even thinking about it, their hands reached out, bodies being pulled tight as they embraced, no longer viewing one another as enemies. Gazes lingered a moment longer before their eyes closed, as they leaned into press their lips together. The first time Kayla had ever been kissed - she felt anxious, and yet the experience of Mallory rang true, her tongue and lips carefully guiding and instructing the naive paladin.<br />
<br />
Knees gave way almost at the same time as they languidly spread out onto the bed, the desire building and burning within both women. Pure, true love surged within both as hands began to remove clothing, clearing away all that lay between bodies that so urgently needed to become entwined. She loved this woman, as much as her goddess loved all living beings: endlessly. That love filled her mind completely, leaving her with no greater desire than to show the assassin that she was still adored in spite of her crimes - and to in turn receive the affection that had so long been denied to her.</p>
