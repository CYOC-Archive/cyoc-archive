<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh stop being such a pussy and wear the damn skirt already Sam&quot; argued Megan, Sam&#39;s girlfriend. Sam held the fabric in his delicate hands, and nodded. He stood up,  carefully doing his best to not pinch his swollen testicles as he stepped into the skirt and pulled it up. Last night, his testicles underwent a dramatic size change again, this time swelling from the size of golf balls to a pair of softballs. His scrotum was stretched tight against them too, really emphasizing their size. He knew men often have their balls swell as they mature, but he didn&#39;t know they could get this big, if not even bigger. And due to their new size, he officially was forced to forgo wearing most types of  pants for the rest of his life. <br />
<br />
From now on, Sam would be wearing skirts, dresses, and rarely leggings when it got cooler out. This also meant that he would now start having to purchase scrotal lingerie, as wearing his normal panties was no longer an option. Scrotal lingerie was a relatively new fashion trend that practically became normalized overnight by the women. Every female expected big balled boys and men to now wear it when out in public. <br />
<br />
It was conceptually designed to be sexy, so there was nothing &quot;modest&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; about it. It is essentially a super sexy bra for balls. It was commonly called a &quot;bla&quot; too. It functioned in one of 2 ways. Either by lifting the balls up so that they rest underneath a males ass while being pulled back behind their thighs, or it would pull them up and wrap completely around the dick, burying it in the scrotum&#39;s stretched skin, creating the appearance of cleavage, which would then be put out on display with special clothing that has been designed showed off a male&#39;s crotch cleavage. 80% of them have some kind of lace pattern too. <br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s girlfriend had actually taken the initiative and purchased the new clothing for him. She choose an open front skirt and a sexy sheer black bla. Sam stepped into the loops of the bla and pulled the straps up over his hips, which meant that some portion of the strap was actually above his skirts band. His balls were pushed together around his dick and pulled forward, presenting themselves as best they could as the fabric of the skirt framed them perfectly.<br />
<br />
Sam felt really embarrassed, his dick was now fully encased by his ball sack, and he would be expected to go out in public like this. Megan pinched his ass, causing Sam to let out an involuntary moan as she moved behind him. She cupped his balls with one of her hands and began massaging it, sending Sam into a moaning fit. <br />
<br />
A man&#39;s balls are said to be 2-5 times as sensitive as a woman&#39;s breast, and big balled males can be even over 10 times. The trade off of course, is that the larger a male&#39;s balls get, the less painful it is to have then touched, squeezed, and/or hit. The pain is quite literally replaced with pleasure. Whike Megan continued fondling her boyfriend, she slowly began to get aroused herself, as her pants began tenting outwards due to her swelling clitoris. <br />
<br />
Sam could feel her clitoris brush up passed his ass, and a twinge of carnal lust shot through him momentarily. He, only for a second, wanted nothing more than to impale his asshole on that swollen and thick clitoris that he knew his girlfriend had ever since she made him suck on it once. This was back when they were not yet dating, and when Megan was a lot less concerned for his own enjoyment too.<br />
<br />
Sam leaned a bit back into Megan&#39;s muscular torso. She was in amazing shape, and feeling her abs and how strong and hard they were really turned him on even more. He looked up over his shoulder at her, as he was almost a full head shorter than her, and kissed her chin, as it was the highest point he could reach on her body with his lips. <br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t have anywhere to be today, so of course this didnt just stop with a simple chin kiss. Nope, Megan knew that her boy bitch was feeling horny and she was more than ready to help him out with dealing with it. <br />
<br />
She pulled down his too, exposing the 2 small mounds on his chest as she turned him around. Sam quickly covered his small breasts out of embarrassment. Most males do not grow breast tissue. But Sam was, and quite fast too. He had grown a pair of fully formed, B cup breasts, in just 48 hours, and they showed no sign of slowing down either. It was a known side effect of having big balls though, a the bigger the pair of balls a male has, the bigger his chance to naturally start developing real breasts becomes. <br />
<br />
His golf ball sized nuts gave him his B cups, but what size would his now softball sized testicles grow his breasts too? Sam didn&#39;t want to think about it. He would have to get even more revealing outfits if they eventually grew above a D-cup, as then he would have to choose from the outfits designed by the perverted woman who loved big boobed males and wanted them to show off their titties and balls to the rest of the world. Low cut tops were practically the standard, and many of them were also crop tops. There were actually quite a few backless designs too, as well as sleeveless ones that would show off more of a male&#39;s side boob than his cleavage.<br />
<br />
Megan would not allow him to wear anything but the sluttiest outfits these days. And if he were to grow big tits too, he can basically kiss any chance of having any public decency goodbye. He couldn&#39;t argue with Megan, and was too submissive towards her to disagree with her whims. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go put on some heels first, then we can have some fun. You need the few extra inches so I do not have to squat every time I want to kiss you back. Sam nodded and quickly scurried over to his closet and disappeared inside for a moment. About a minute later, he returned wearing a 8&quot; tall pair of thigh high pleaser boots that brought him up to being only an inch or so shorter than Megan. Megan lifted one of her boyfriend&#39;s legs and wrapped it around her waist as she picked him up by his amazing ass and carried him over to her bed, tossing him down onto it, and spread apart his legs, revealing his beautiful pair of orbs that were hiding his cock. <br />
<br />
Megan pulled off his bla and watched as his balls flopped down onto the bed. His cock finally free of its fleshy prison, quickly hardened. It had been already pretty wet before it was free due to it leaking out precum while still trapped between his nuts, but now it was fully erect and dripping. &quot;God you are soaking wet, you must really want it badly&quot; smirked Megan as she lowered her head down and began licking the area just around Sam&#39;s cock and balls, causing him to let out a number of moans.</p>
