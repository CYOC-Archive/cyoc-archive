<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heather and Jeremy&#39;s trip to Vilcabamba was not quite as great as Mieni Atoll. Considering they were larger than humans and a fair amount of Animalians, there were some places they couldn&#39;t go, such as the tree village. Exploring the rainforest was a bit limited as the undergrowth made it hard to walk through and there was a chance that someone could get lost after stepping off the path. While Heather did find the Mesoamerican ruins interesting, there was something about the place that was making her nervous. Even though Jeremy and Tyra tried to ask her about it, Heather just told them it was nothing.<br />
<br />
Eventually, things did come to a boil. It happened one night while Heather and Jeremy were sleeping in one of the huts built for the larger Animalians, though it was still a little small for them. Jeremy had been asleep when Heather started tossing and turning in her bed. Her movements eventually woke Jeremy up and he looked with concern as his wife seemed to be having a bad dream, particularly the way she kept saying &#39;no&#39; in her sleep. Suddenly, Heather snapped her eyes open and cried, &quot;No!&quot; She panted hard as she realized she was awake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heather, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t have a nightmare about nothing,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t a nightmare,&quot; said Heather. Jeremy gave her a level look. &quot;Ok, it was a nightmare, satisfied?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was it about?&quot; asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember the drug lord I helped bring down?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;By accidentally running past where his hideout was?&quot; asked Jeremy a little dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, so I wasn&#39;t that involved with it. I might not have known he was there, but he definitely knew I was,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
Jeremy&#39;s expression turned grim. He had heard about what the drug lord did after he learned about Heather. &quot;He put out a reward for your head as a hunting trophy, didn&#39;t he?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Heather shuddered and said, &quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do know he&#39;s in jail right now,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;Nobody&#39;s going to be collecting that reward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell that to my subconscious,&quot; said Heather, &quot;And don&#39;t think that there isn&#39;t someone depraved enough to want to be the first man to bag a dinosaur, even if they used to be human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that what your dream was about?&quot; asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was kept in a cage,&quot; said Heather, &quot;There was some creepy guy gloating about what he was going to do with me after I&#39;m stuffed and mounted. The worst part was that he already had several mounted heads.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whose heads?&quot; asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much everyone in Project Dinotopia,&quot; said Heather, &quot;Norrie, Andrew, Jen, Sora, Yuki, Sophie, Roland, Tyra, Rex, even your head.&quot; She gave a great shudder at that.<br />
<br />
Jeremy pulled her close and gave her a hug. &quot;Nothing like that&#39;s going to happen. No big game hunter&#39;s going to come after anyone. Trust me, no one is going to ever let that happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I won&#39;t be able to get back to sleep while that&#39;s still in my head,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then perhaps we should find something to take your mind off of it,&quot; said Jeremy, pressing his body against hers.<br />
<br />
Heather gave him an annoyed look and said, &quot;You really want to have sex after I just had a nightmare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;ll clear your mind,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
Heather gave a small sigh and said, &quot;You know what, I&#39;m actually horny enough to go with it. Stupid dinosaur libido. But I want something a bit more exotic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, like what?&quot; asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ever heard of 69ing?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;69?&quot; asked Jeremy. Heather leaned in and whispered what it was. Jeremy jumped a bit and said, &quot;Er, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m comfortable with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why not?&quot; asked Heather, sounding offended, &quot;I thought every man would want their wife to go down on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but most men don&#39;t have wives with flesh-rending fangs,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t really think I&#39;d bite your dick off, do you?&quot; asked Heather flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not on purpose,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, how about we try it this way?&quot; asked Heather before pulling aside the covers. She grasped Jeremy&#39;s dick, half-out of its sheath, and started rubbing it. She encouraged it to go all the way to full mast by giving it a few licks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, no bitey,&quot; said Jeremy nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be such a baby,&quot; said Heather. Once his dick was fully erect, she placed it between her breasts. Grasping her tits, she started sliding up and down it. Her tits were more than enough to encompass Jeremy&#39;s dick. Jeremy grunted as his wife&#39;s boobjob was pleasing him more than he was expecting it too. He turned him on even more as Heather was giving him flirty winks and licking the head. Putting her lips around the head and sucking soon proved too much for Jeremy and he spouted deep into Heather&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
Heather pulled herself off of Jeremy, coughing loudly. &quot;Wrong...pipe...&quot; she gasped as she spat out Jeremy&#39;s cum. Jeremy patted her back as she gagged up the cum that was lodged in her throat. &quot;Why did you have to cum so hard?&quot; asked Heather once it was all out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I can control the force of it,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, my turn to get off,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just give me a minute to recharge,&quot; said Jeremy, rubbing his length.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not with that,&quot; said Heather, &quot;I deserve something extra special for that favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What then?&quot; asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
Heather looked Jeremy up and down before saying, &quot;Give me your tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My...tail?&quot; asked Jeremy with confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it looks more than enough,&quot; said Heather as she grabbed her husband&#39;s tail. She aimed the tip at her netherlips before pushing it in. Heather gave a moan of satisfaction before saying, &quot;Ok, push it all the way in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a <i>Syntixisaurus</i>, not a chameleon,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;My tail isn&#39;t that prehensile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then, just hold still,&quot; said Heather as she pushed herself on Jeremy&#39;s tail. Her husband&#39;s tail didn&#39;t make a particularly suitable dildo, considering it tapered at the end and required more moving around inside to stimulate her. Jeremy wasn&#39;t really getting anything off of it. All he was getting was a wet, warm sensation at the tip of his tail, which didn&#39;t do a lot to turn him on. Eventually, Heather was able to work herself up enough to orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we need to put a bit more thought into what counts as &#39;exotic&#39; sex for us,&quot; said Jeremy as he pulled his tail out and wiped it on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, maybe we should look at that Animalian Karma Sutra book,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we can find a copy in Maelewano,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good thing we&#39;ll be going there soon,&quot; said Heather as she snuggled up to Jeremy, eager to sleep again.</p>
