<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Reshaping June’s Reality<br />
<br />
Like Mark, June changed slowly instead of fast, in part because Ty expressly wanted to watch the gorgeous young woman gradually change as he pleased himself. It began with June’s feet, as she happened to look down to see why they were tingling so nicely. She watched in fixated amazement instead of horror as her toenails very slowly started to grow longer. June gasped her astonishment and sat down on the floor to pull her left foot close and examine what was happening to it.<br />
<br />
As she flexed her leg and held her foot close to her view, she watched with a strange fascination on her face, as her toenails became thick and darkly colored, capping the entire front of the toe instead of just the top. The nails curved into a sharp angle and grew completely rigid as they stretched to a couple inches in length, leaving June with deadly looking talons on the end of all her toes. A quick check of her right foot revealed the same change had occurred.<br />
<br />
June stood up again and looked down at both feet with dumbfounded interest, as now her toes themselves were stretching longer, becoming thinner bony digits measuring nearly three inches. Oddly, her big toe on each foot was now visibly shrinking in size while the other toes were growing to almost perfectly uniform length. Her foot reshaped slightly as her big toes shrank away entirely and disappeared, leaving her new toes facing like a slightly deformed “W” shape. June experimentally wiggled her toes and grinned as all eight made clacking sounds on the floor as her new talons hit. The overall shape reminded June of a bird’s foot<br />
<br />
June pulled up a chair from the kitchen table and sat down now, clearly enjoying her change. Her toes grew flaps of skin in between, which turned into fleshy webbing in between each of her digits. Her heels began to rise upward independent of her feet themselves, slowly pushing into hocks as her ankles reshaped from the changing bone structure underneath. Now June would have to stand on the front of her feet instead of being balanced by a heel.<br />
<br />
Her eyes went wide as she rubbed her hands over her strangely dehumanized legs and felt her bones reshaping all the way up, her joints making crackling noises. The shape of her leg shifted and rearranged all the way up to her thighs, leaving her with legs that resembled a bird’s as well, though they were clearly not the proper shapes to be a bird. She flexed and bent her legs and found they were able to move in new highly flexible ways and new places all together.<br />
<br />
As her legs finished their changes, June felt the same pleasant tingling sensation starting in her hands. With a big smile, she held up her hands to witness their change too. Slowly, but steadily, June’s fingers underwent the same changes as her feet. Her fingernails became long and pointed, and grew until they covered the tips of her fingers. The stretching claws arced slightly into curved blades, and grew much longer and heavier than her feet talons had. As soon as this was completed, June watched with amazement as her middle finger on each hand shrank away completely, leaving her with four fingers on each hand spaced by the gap where her missing fingers had just been.<br />
<br />
Now the most significant change began to manifest, as June’s pinky finger began to stretch longer. She watched the change with deep fascination and puzzlement as the extending finger on each hand became disproportionately long and kept growing. Soon, June’s pinky finger had thickened at the base, filling a good portion of her palm, and was tapering off into a long oversized digit, which she found she could still flex despite the added weight and girth. Her three clawed fingers grew longer as well, but not nearly as much as the strange digit that now reached halfway down her body.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take June long to recognize what her oversized finger was becoming, and she gasped with sudden realization as another bone formed in the finger itself, and the entire digit grew longer than her entire body. The shape of her hand was distinct and unmistakable. She had seen it many times in pictures and anatomical drawings. “A wing!” she gasped excitedly. Not just any wing, she realized, as the shape of her hand suggested. She watched intently as sure enough a thin membrane of skin formed at her armpits and began to join to the skin on her arm and side. The fleshy membrane looked almost transparent at first, with thick veins running it’s length, but soon it thickened and stretched as it traveled down June’s arm and joined to her hip. She cried out in delight and flexed her arm as the membrane grew down the elongated finger, which eased the movement of her bones with the added strength and grew down to the very edge of the finger’s tip. Wing tip, June realized. She now had wings! Eagerly, the changing woman stretched out her brand new wings to their full span with a whooshing breeze of air, her expression one of utter delight. She looked from side to side and grinned warmly, estimating her wingspan to be well over 18 feet.<br />
<br />
She flexed her wings and moved them about, finding she still possessed a very human hand with opposable thumb, and came to rest her very welcome new limbs in a folded position at her sides. She couldn’t wait to try them. Could she really use them? Would she know how? The possibility made her tremble in excitement, even as her face began to stretch. Suddenly aware of what was happening, June’s eyes looked down just in time to see her nose and mouth begin to push outwards from her face as her skull reshaped painlessly. She gasped and gripped her mouth with her new fingers, feeling the flesh stretching and her jaws turning into the point of a slim and long beak. She felt a bump at the back of her head and full realization dawned on her. The wings, the feet, the long slender beak that was protruding to fearsome length from her changing head. The crest at the back of her head that was even now growing into a long angled swoop upwards.<br />
<br />
June couldn’t really believe it, but her young and sexy body was transforming into an equally young and sexy Pteranodon woman. The day was getting stranger and stranger. June’s eyes became reptilian slits, her ears shrunk into her head and her beak grew to almost two foot long, coming to perfectly pterosaurian shape as her skull altered to accommodate it. Her aerodynamic head crest completed, as the back of her head changed as well, and then June possessed a slender crested head of a Pteranodon complete with a beak.<br />
<br />
Eagerly, June sprang from the chair, wobbling uneasily on her unfamiliar feet, balance off by much, and she gently raised to her full height, nearly falling over from her shifted perspective and unusual new stance. This wasn’t helped by the fact her neck was stretching upwards, allowing her to hold it in a flexible S curve. Completely ignoring Ty, who was well hidden, June ungracefully bounded up the stairs, tripping at least once, to get a look at herself in the bathroom mirror.<br />
<br />
She was met with a bizarre sight. A hybrid human and Pteranodon with the body of the former and the distinctive features of the latter. She was clearly a Pteranodon, albeit a pink-fleshed humanoid one. June leaned in closer, staring at her reflection intently as now all of her body began to tingle at once, and bumped her beak into the mirror. That would take some getting used to, among other things. A short tail bulged from above her rump, and then June watched with excitement as her body hair began to shrink back and completely disappear from her skin. Her skin, in turn, seemed to lose every wrinkle and line as it smoothed into a glossy sheen. This was short-lived, as a thick leathery texture appeared over her skin, washing from the top down, covering every inch of her transformed flesh and taking on a deep blue pigmentation, with a lighter blue under her lower beak and down her belly.<br />
<br />
Almost completely changed, June gaped in amazement at her new form. It was the best combination of human and Pterosaur and she found herself sexy. Even as this thought played through her mind, June’s hearing became subtly sharper, her sense of smell deeply refined. Her body grew sleeker, more aerodynamic, and she gasped in sudden unexpected arousal as she felt her muscles grow tighter than they were already, especially around her wings and chest. The last thing to happen was that June felt lighter all over, a result of her bones hollowing out to give her the ability to fly. Then, the tingling stopped, and June was left completely transformed into a deliciously sexy and svelte young Pteranodon woman.<br />
<br />
She breathed heavily, gasping as she felt her youthfully virgin and untouched vagina begin to ache in need. Excitedly, she brushed her clawed hand on the outside of her leathery opening and observed with shock the sudden gush of feminine fluids that ejaculated from inside, lubricating her groin and soaking her winged hand. The scent of her own freshly spilled intimate fluids made her distinctly horny. It made her tense up and her body beg for orgasm, her pristine vagina pulsing and aching for what she knew would be the first touch all over again. But June’s young impulses were easily controlled by her adult mind, and in minutes she calmed her body and let her arousal fade. It was hard, as she could feel the strange mixture of pubescent human chemicals surging through her young reptilian body, begging her for sex and reproduction.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Ty wondered how June was doing and if she had successfully changed into her new form.</p>
