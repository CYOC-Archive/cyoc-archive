<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During his conversation with Oakmoss, Karyu found himself looking at his life with new eyes, although it had taken Karyu becoming a demon for him to realize it. In his new body, which was black with a red underbelly, he felt so much more powerful and more free. This had made him more open to hearing Oakmoss&#39; words.<br />
<br />
Karyu realized that Luka, in spite of all of her good intentions, could never see him as a person. He was above petty anger at Luka. He acknowledged that Luka most likely really did love him, but she would only ever love him as someone would love a short-lived pet animal. She might be unhappy about losing Karyu, but in truth, Luka really ought to consider going back to Rebecca. Michael was most likely hurting from not having Luka there, in his life. Karyu recognized that he was to blame for that, taking a father away from his children.<br />
<br />
Karyu thought enough of Luka to write her a letter, explaining his new situation. Its contents were, &quot;I have fallen in love, with an equal. You and I might see each other, in time. Wait to hear from me.&quot; Borrowing a little bit of Anija&#39;s magic, which she had taught to Karyu, the letter was sent along, in a puff of smoke.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss was looking a little regretful. &quot;I don&#39;t want to feel like I am forcing you to leave everything,&quot; he said, shyly.<br />
<br />
Karyu shook his head. &quot;I plan to stay in contact with them,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Oakmoss replied, actually looking genuinely relieved.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want them to know you, someday,&quot; Karyu added.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss blushed shyly at that, ducking his head as his oakmoss-green and gray scales showed a hint of crimson under them. &quot;If so, I hope they will like me.”<br />
<br />
Karyu leaned his head over to nibble Oakmoss&#39; neck. &quot;You are beautiful,&quot; he said simply.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss was rendered speechless, his body becoming immediately aroused by the bite but his voice unable to say anything. He just stood there, with his face flushed and his cock peeping out between his legs. This was the most dominant that Karyu had been with him, usually being a soft and easy lover when he chose to be on top. It was different, but Oakmoss was kind of liking it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am going to fuck you,&quot; Karyu announced.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss changed his posture in a clear assent. &quot;Put it in there, you demon,&quot; he said as his tail flagged like that of a hen in heat. &quot;Rut that ass,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
Karyu reared up on his hind-legs, and he positioned his rock-hard cock so that it was bumping up against Oakmoss&#39; undertail. &quot;You know that there is a price for seducing a drake,&quot; he hissed into Oakmoss&#39; ear.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss giggled as Karyu sprayed his ear a little bit, and he turned his head back wryly. &quot;You know that I am loving this, don&#39;t you?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Karyu paused for only a second. &quot;I do,&quot; he deadpanned, smiling joyfully. &quot;I&#39;ll still be starting with that first inch, though,&quot; he said. &quot;Let me know if you need me to slow down,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; Oakmoss whispered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I you,&quot; Karyu whispered back. With that, he bumped his cockhead gently against Oakmoss&#39; anus, grinding the fluids that were dripping from his cock against it. He took his sweet time, waiting for the smaller dragon to relax his sphincter just that little bit. He listened for hints in Oakmoss&#39; breathing, and he kept his forepaws gently on his hips, making sure that his muscles were relaxed. As he sensed an opening, he gently thrust his cockhead forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh,&quot; Oakmoss said in a descending tone, keeping his head bent and one hind-paw cocked-up slightly but not raised. As his body started to feel the obstruction, he let his head raise itself up in a cry of surrender. &quot;Ah!&quot; he said aloud.<br />
<br />
Karyu felt the muscle dilate a little more at that, and he shoved in dominantly. &quot;Say you desire me,&quot; he growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I desire you!&quot; Oakmoss whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say you want me to fuck you,&quot; Karyu demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to fuck me, Karyu!&quot; Oakmoss cried out.<br />
<br />
Karyu leaned his head down and grabbed Oakmoss&#39; neck in his teeth, and as he latched on firmly with his teeth, he gave a firm thrust with his hips, pulling back quickly and thrusting again.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss was certainly not about to go back, now. He let his voice cry out submissively as his ass was fucked, and he spread his legs out to let the other drake drive his wisdom home. &quot;Oh!&quot; he cried incoherently. &quot;Ohhhhh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon, though, Oakmoss had loosened up enough that Karyu was sliding in and out easily and in a good rhythm. He let go of Oakmoss&#39; neck, giving a few licks at the few pinpricks of blood that showed where his jaws had been sunk in. Nothing too serious. On this occasion, though, Karyu did something he usually didn&#39;t do--except for once, in the instance of one young, surreally beautiful but perilously lonely drake that Karyu had been especially concerned about, at least until that young drake had found a constant lover that truly deserved him more than Karyu--he leaned down, and he licked Oakmoss&#39; cheek.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss turned his head, though, and he parted his jaws to join those of Karyu in a kiss, with Karyu&#39;s dick still planted deep in his bowels. Gently, as they held the kiss, Oakmoss ground his hips back against Karyu, successfully masturbating Karyu with his ass as they kissed. This amazing mid-coitus kiss seemed, for both of them, to last a lifetime. It was a kiss of impossible love, and their tongues weaved peacefully about each other for several long minutes.<br />
<br />
As they broke the kiss, their minds having spaced out quite a bit from it, they tried to assess where they were...and even who they were. They realized soon that Karyu was fucking Oakmoss, and Karyu slammed his hips forward, a growl building in his throat.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss let out a cry with each thrust by Karyu, letting Karyu&#39;s cock take control of him. He totally surrendered control over his prostate, which was being pumped so expertly by Karyu&#39;s experienced cock. His hind-toes began to curl as he began to inevitably be pushed into an orgasm by the action. His eyes went closed, and he began to toss his head as it began to creep over him.<br />
<br />
Karyu sensed that Oakmoss was near, and he quickened his pace, growling as he slammed against Oakmoss&#39; ass. His own jet-black ass tensed as he began to lose control, his orgasm taking on a life of his own, and he soon began pumping his load of seed into the oakmoss-green and gray dragon&#39;s bowels, just as Oakmoss himself burst out also in helpless cries of orgasm.<br />
<br />
As they collapsed together, they began to snuggle in the afterglow. Karyu held Oakmoss protectively in his mighty grasp. &quot;I&#39;m committed to you, now,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever loved before?&quot; Oakmoss said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was too young,&quot; Karyu admitted. &quot;A drake nearer his age found him before it could get too far...and I was grateful that this one could make him happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are such a good dragon, Karyu,&quot; Oakmoss said with a smile, nuzzling Karyu lovingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though I am a demon,&quot; Karyu giggled, and he joined Oakmoss in another kiss. This one, though, would not be broken for a long time to come.</p>
