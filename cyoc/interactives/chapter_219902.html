<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I could feel my entire body quivering from delight. At some point, I had stuck my hand down my panties and began to massage my sopping wet throbbing clit; what was the point of having modesty at this point? I writhed and moaned and just....rode the wave! What the hell else could I do? Might as well enjoy the absolute insane turn my life had decided to take. Underneath the blimps that my boobs had become, I could feel more houses beginning to crumble - they were but minor inconveniences at this point. I covered not just my own house&#39;s street, but the street behind us as well - and I could feel the asphalt cracking and bending underneath the massive might of my mammories. <br />
<br />
You&#39;ll have to forgive me. I left sanity behind around the time my tits turned my bed into bits of scrap metal and cloth. <br />
<br />
Loud pops and creaks and groans emanated from all around me - the speed of the growth had gone up again. I felt my breasts brushing aside houses like they were toys. Trees flattened. Cars were crushed. I could feel the rubble and debris - all while my nipples ground into the ground beneath me, sending a white hot sensation of pleasure straight to my cunt. God, even as I thought that, another orgasm swept through me. The wide expanse of titflesh beneath me seemed to tremble with the sensation. <br />
<br />
To think I&#39;d once been worried about not having breasts big enough.<br />
<br />
Thanks universe. What a great fucking joke you&#39;ve played. <br />
<br />
At this point, I just hoped my mom and grandparents were safe. If anyone was still in their house as my breasts came in...<br />
<br />
Well.<br />
<br />
From my vantage point now, I could see the entirety of the city stretched out before me. Skyscrapers that had once seemed so tall now seemed comically small compared to my massive tits - at this rate it wasn&#39;t going to be long until I was knocking those down too. <br />
<br />
At a certain point, I became aware of the sound of a helicopter. Soldiers lowered down from a ladder and dropped onto my tits - I could actually feel their boots stepping across my skin. It was an odd sensation - especially since I could still feel the myriad of buildings beneath me. Houses were being crushed now at an uncomfortable rate - the wanton destruction being caused was like a massage. <br />
<br />
The soldiers came closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am - can you hear me? Your name is Bronwyn, correct?&quot; one of them asked. It was a female soldier. Maybe they thought I would respond better in that case. Maybe the male soldiers just didn&#39;t feel comfortable enough. Who fucking knew. I didn&#39;t even bother taking my hand out from my panties. Let them stare.<br />
<br />
But I did at least nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to try to help you, okay? But we have a question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet,&quot; I muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is the Beastinator?&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, they got my full attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;The WHAT?&quot; I demanded. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Breastinator,&quot; the soldier continued with a grim expression. &quot;It looks like a ray-gun. It&#39;s...a very powerful device. It&#39;s the only thing capable of causing something like this. We thought it was destroyed. It SHOULD have been destroyed. The amount of destruction it can cause...well...I don&#39;t think I need to explain it to you,&quot; the soldier told Bronwyn. <br />
<br />
Bronwyn pushed up against her breasts so she could better see the soldier. She could feel her heart pounding - beyond the sexual pleasure of the sensations beneath her. With rage. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. WAIT. Wait, fucking wait - there&#39;s - there&#39;s something out there - there&#39;s something out there that DID THIS TO ME? ON PURPOSE???&quot; Bronwyn shrieked. &quot;All those months I was struggling with my breasts...the growth...the...it did this...it...someone did this...SOMEONE DID THIS?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid so. It&#39;s imperative we find it. It&#39;s the only thing that can reverse this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME???? WHO WOULD INVENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS? LOOK AT ME!&quot; I screamed. &quot;I&#39;M A FREAK!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand...please...if you know anything about it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never even heard of it!&quot; I yelled. &quot;Holy fuck! The Breastinator? What the fuck is wrong with you people?? When I find out who did this to me I&#39;m going to KILL THEM!&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Across town, from the vantage point of his apartment, Jim looked out the window with a mounting sense of disbelief.<br />
<br />
It was the oddest sight of his life.<br />
<br />
And...a fantasy he&#39;d never thought would come true. One he&#39;d only thought possible through photo manipulations and stories written online.<br />
<br />
When the sirens and alarms had started to blare, he&#39;d turned on the TV to an incredible, terrifying, impossible sight. A pair of breasts growing large enough that they had crushed a house and were going on to crush the rest of the neighborhood around them. And...Jim knew that house. He knew it too well. And he knew who the girl was who had to be attached to those breasts. Bronwyn - his niece. With a numb state of mind, he&#39;d gone to the window and looked out and watched in silence as the breasts continued to grow, until they dominated the landscape beyond. Even now, as he watched, they were growing more and more.<br />
<br />
Bronwyn...<br />
<br />
The breastinator. <br />
<br />
It had just...it had just been a dumb prop! Hadn&#39;t it? He&#39;d bought it because he thought the name was funny. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d shot it at his pregnant sister as a joke because he hadn&#39;t actually thought it would work...<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
It had. He&#39;d become more and more suspicious of it every time he saw Bronwyn. It seemed like every time he saw her lately, her chest had gotten larger and larger - and then to the point where no one could explain just how they had gotten so big.<br />
<br />
Except Jim knew. He had been responsible. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d felt so guilty. Every time he saw Bronwyn...<br />
<br />
He wanted to get the breastinator and explain and reverse it. <br />
<br />
He also wanted to get it and start shooting it every woman he could find, until he was surrounded by a mountain range of massive tits. <br />
<br />
Silently, he went looking around his apartment, going through a variety of boxes of old stuff...until he found it. It looked so simple and boring...but...the results were outside the window. Bronwyn was now a force of nature - a speck attached to mountains. <br />
<br />
He could fix this.<br />
<br />
Or.<br />
<br />
OR.<br />
<br />
And he hated himself for this.<br />
<br />
He truly did. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d been avoiding seeing his sister and Bronwyn because the sight of those massive melons was...intoxicating.<br />
<br />
He could fix this, or...he could go out in a blaze of glory. If one shot fourteen years ago had resulted in this...what would a more direct hit result in? It would certainly result in the destruction of the city, himself, and maybe even the state. Hell, maybe even the entire continent, or the world itself. But it would certainly take him out as a result - but then, he would never have to deal with the guilt or the shame or admit what he had done. <br />
<br />
And maybe a small part of him - he didn&#39;t like it, but...maybe a small part of him wanted to see just how far Bronwyn&#39;s tits could go.</p>
