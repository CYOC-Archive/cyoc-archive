<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Much like physical injury, emotional injury did not automatically heal in a day, or a week <br />
for that matter and in the end could leave scars that might not ever go away.<br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny's guilt over their well meaning but reckless scheme of using the Omegas as <br />
their shadow puppets to prove their worth to the rest of the pack was something they'd <br />
never forget. And for eight cubs, the loss of their mothers was NOT something that a day <br />
off from school and a performance by the Omegas and kindness by a fellow cub could <br />
magically make go away. The truth of the loss had finally hit them. The grieving process <br />
would not be over in a day.<br />
<br />
The fact these blows had been struck down on -children- would make the repairs only a <br />
longer process. Yes, this wasn't something that could be just cured in a day.<br />
<br />
While Felicity was in no way Elise, nor could be Elise, nor would ever be Elise, Felicity was <br />
still Brian's Prime Mate, and with that came a responsibility to Moja, Mbili, Tatuli, and <br />
Nneli, her Prime Mate's children. She would be there to teach them the things that simply <br />
weren't covered in school.<br />
<br />
That left Tano, Sita, Saba, and Nane still without a mother or mother figure.  Penny loved <br />
Kirk, and was the only person she'd want for her Prime Mate. But Fox had been Penny's <br />
best friend and it felt wrong to leave her litter out in the cold, true, there was the rest of <br />
the Pride would be more than willing to take care of them, but to teach them to be <br />
lionesses was something only a woman like Penny could do.<br />
<br />
Penny admitted to herself that she had little clue on how she could reach a understanding <br />
with the litter's father over this. She had no intention of becoming Gary's Prime Mate nor <br />
was she about to try and steal his own litter from him, she simply wanted to provide his <br />
litter with a positive female role model.<br />
<br />
'Maybe he and the litter can just move in with me and Kirk once we get our own place,' <br />
Penny thought, after all, co-habitation between families of the Pride wasn't that strange. <br />
Homes were all joint owned by the Pride as a whole anyway.<br />

Gillie didn't know when she lost track of what she was supposed to be asking, instead she <br />
had asked her grandmother questions any grandchild would of their long lost <br />
grandmother. What were her grandparents like in their youth? What details did the history <br />
books leave out from the historical events they themselves had lived through?<br />
<br />
Of course this also ended up giving Gillie a new history lessons on events that had <br />
happened different (again) from how she remembered.<br />
<br />
As Mother Glen, as her grandmother, continued to speak about the incredibly long life she <br />
had led giving finer detail about event she had witnessed, Gillie thought, 'They're not <br />
human. Not in the least.' Of course Gillie already knew that just from looking at them. But <br />
it was more than that. Human beings had a limit on how many people they could <br />
empathizes with. How many persons they could comprehend as persons all at once before <br />
needing to shrink them down into categories before going mad at trying to recognize them <br />
all -individually- as fellow sentient beings.<br />
<br />
The more Gillie listened, the more it became obvious that Mother Glen saw any person she <br />
spoke of as if she knew them personally, it was as if there was no such thing as <br />
'impersonal' with them.<br />
<br />
'I guess it makes sense,' Gillie thought, 'If the conditions of the Transform was for everyone <br />
who was transformed to be civilized, and their children to be civilized, and so forth, you'd <br />
have to have them genetically inclined to empathize with anyone and everyone...'  What <br />
honestly scared Gillie was how that DIDN'T make her head hurt like it should have! Even as <br />
Gillie thought about it, she thought of each of her officers, and realized how much each of <br />
them meant to her. Of course they already had before, she wouldn't be much of a police <br />
chief if they hadn't meant anything to her. But something felt different about it.<br />
<br />
'I just hope I don't go insane from having software for completely different hardware!' Gillie <br />
thought thinking of her brain structure.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we best head back down.&quot; Her grandmother said, &quot;It would be rude for the meat to <br />
go to waste for breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already ate.&quot; Gillie said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's being there that counts sometimes.&quot; Mother Glen explained, and I can escort you <br />
downstairs dear while you visit your pridemates...&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie sighed and nodded wondering precisely what Tabby had become a sister or a <br />
husband for Wanda by now.<br />
<br />

1682<br />
<br />
For the Omega Mary it was just as bad as the wolf pups who had come with the ever loyal <br />
and ever obedient (and picture perfect example of what an Omega SHOULD be) silver twins <br />
had come home with the pups sporting amber colored fur and bizarre mixes of reds and <br />
yellows and various shades of purple.<br />
<br />
Was it some new disease? But besides the odd fur color nothing about them had seemed <br />
amiss. And the pups talked about some rainbow colored she-wolves that had given them <br />
all their new fur colors.<br />
<br />
&quot;And of course,&quot; Glass Marie said, &quot;They never found them. The witches did this trick one <br />
more time adding various other colors to the lupman genome. This of course led to some <br />
nasty rumors back in Europe that lupmans there were mating with felmans, who of course, <br />
are known for their bright and unique fur colors.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddex said nothing about Marie saying the obvious since his daughters were present and <br />
to his knowledge hadn't met a felman face to face before.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this, of course,&quot; Marie continued, &quot;Just added fuel to the fire almost a century later <br />
that drove the chasm between the European and the North American branches of the Big <br />
Bad Wolf pack even further. There was no love lost when the two branches were on <br />
opposing sides during the revolutionary war.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddex glared at glass Marie and shut her trap. There were somethings little girls like his <br />
twin daughters DIDN'T need to know about until they hit puberty. And Marie chose to <br />
respect Maddex's decision as a father.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Kathrine just kept on trying?&quot; Betty asked, &quot;You think after that incident she'd have <br />
tried to find someone else to be friends with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kathrine was incredibly stubborn, which is how she was able to keep up the pretense of a <br />
happy go lucky personality that was expected for her 'fur caste'. And so through Christ <br />
Masses, Easter Sundays, and Naming Days, was near Marie Cruz...  Marie at one such event <br />
punched her after one session of trying too hard on Kathrine's part and Kathrine hid in her <br />
room for a month before coming out looking as perky and determined as ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like that?&quot; Betty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh she cried to herself a lot in those following weeks, but eventually she decided she had <br />
already set course and left port and was going to see the voyager through to the end.  And <br />
Kathrine did prove useful at last to Marie in taking care of Mutt. The dog spent most of his <br />
time sleeping now and Marie didn't have the time to spend anymore to look after her <br />
beloved dog. What stunned her more than anything was how Mutt -didn't- freak out at <br />
being around Kathrine... after all.. to Mutt, Kathrine was part of the same group as Marie, <br />
so there was no logical reason to be hostile towards her in the old dog's mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He thought Kathrine was a dog too?&quot; Lilly HAD to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Close enough. Dogs are like that. Chester is also much the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HOW do you know about Chester-?!&quot; She exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have more knowledge and more power right now than ANY person has a right to have <br />
mostly from Kurse being inside all your heads when she was destroyed.  Gita finally turned <br />
eighteen. Of course it was celebrated. But of course the three girls had their own <br />
celebration. And Gita felt inspired.<br />
<br />
 She came to the logical conclusion that the power the witch and the two witchlings had <br />
simply wasn't enough, couldn't be enough, to completely topple order in their lifetime and <br />
they were worried that their experiments for eternal childhood were finally being noticed <br />
by their father and by those even with only a passing element of the gift.<br />
<br />
Their patience was running out, as they entered the world of adults themselves they were <br />
growing increasing desperate. They were TERRIFIED of becoming 'evil adults' and loathed <br />
the idea of being 'one of them' astoundingly. Their familiars of course were saying how <br />
they needed more time, more practice, and that the power they had already dwarfed a <br />
typical witch twice their age already!  Truly, the power they had already -was- greatly <br />
unbalance and unreal when considering how naturally it all came to them. In short, they <br />
had gained great power, WITHOUT EVER having to really WORKED FOR IT.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie shuddered, 'Like me.' Sadly this power was ingrained into her, she couldn't wish it <br />
away than she could her own blood stream.<br />
<br />
Glass Marie continued, &quot;But it STILL wasn't enough. They wanted to be able to turn the <br />
entire world on it's head, not just Glendale, which I suppose was a blessing in disguise <br />
because well before they faced Marie Cruz, Kathrine, Fire, and Vadican and his companion, <br />
they had more enough power to turn Glendale into their own little kingdom, but they were <br />
not interested in just one town...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How could Marie and the others POSSIBLY of stood against THAT? And force them to face <br />
due process to be hung as well-?!&quot; Lawrence asked the perfectly logical question. <br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see soon enough...&quot; Glass Marie said simply. &quot;And the two witchlings and the witch <br />
however as I said were still angry, hurt, and immature children at heart who refused to <br />
accept the death of their loved ones. In their hearts, they never grew up. In that way at <br />
least they succeeded in cheating the world of adults... They began drawing plans for <br />
basically a town sized rune that would cause all the world's magic to be drawn towards <br />
them, basically stealing power from the rest of the world to feed theirs... but none would <br />
realize the cause, save Marie Cruz. And once they put this plan into motion, their power <br />
would grow beyond what a human brain was capable of handling and they'd become the <br />
maniacs that Marie Cruz and her companions would have to put down. Their familiars <br />
convinced them to wait until all three had reached adulthood. Which would be two more <br />
years. And it would take them a year to draw a rune the size of a town ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that rune still exist?&quot; Beth asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No... the curse became self sustaining once it was placed, it stopped at Glendale simply <br />
because that was the mold it was cast from for lack of a better term.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So how did Kathrine and Marie finally become friends?&quot; Casandra asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;A Turk spy infiltrated the Vatican and was popular with all, including Marie, Patricia, and <br />
the rest. He was with them for a year and a half building up trust before putting his real <br />
mission into action. He needed three virgins of three different species of man to sacrifice to <br />
summon a demon of Hell to destroy the heart of the enemy. Marie and Vatican were both <br />
involved in stopping this scene from ever getting near step two.  It was this encounter that <br />
would be the final lesson Marie needed to see her 'friendship' with the witches for what it <br />
was.  When Marie managed to bring him back alive, she personally saw to his interrogation <br />
since he technically no longer existed anymore according to formal records, than she <br />
officially didn't exist so it was a practical match.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean his torture.&quot; Betty said earning a very harsh glare for Maddex and a confused <br />
look from Samantha, Lilly and Casandra. <br />
<br />
&quot;She was an Inquisitor, she knew her trade. And he is not the sort of man you'd have felt <br />
sorry for. To her credit, she tried her absolute hardest NOT to enjoy her task and NOT use <br />
methods that were illegal. And torture was at the time considered by some to be an act of <br />
compassion, punishing a person in life so they wouldn't be punished in the afterlife.<br />
<br />
 And of course there was one other thing, Marie realized that night felmans' personalities -<br />
weren't- slave genetically and Kathrine acted the way she did because of her family's <br />
expectations and her own choices, not cause her DNA told her so. She very much didn't <br />
want Kathrine involved in her world because she'd be hurt, but at that time she also <br />
realized a kinship she had with Kathrine, both had worn masks because they had to, not <br />
because they had chosen to.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like one big ugly chaotic MESS.&quot; Samantha said at last reminding everyone she <br />
was there. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was... Marie vanished from the scene for a year after that incident... by the time she <br />
came back, she was through pushing away Kathrine, or Vatican... who had continued to <br />
watch over her silently even though they had rarely spoken, Gargoyles aren't known for <br />
going back on their word after all...   &quot;</p>
