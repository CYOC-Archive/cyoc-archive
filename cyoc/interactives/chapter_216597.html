<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah followed the Great River with Chatok and Aminu in tow. He saw Ruut waving at him and Maa&#39;ti next to him. <br />
<br />
Sarah saw that Maa&#39;ti look startled while looking in her direction. Sarah knew that she had changed, but was it really that much? Sarah didn&#39;t want to consider it, so she focused on processing what was left of the kill while crouching low - the low working stance common among the tribes hunters. Her height hadn&#39;t changed much since she hadn&#39;t been much taller when she was as girl, but she knew that a boy her current size will likely be quite large, and broad. She was extremely proud of that fact. <br />
<br />
She began to wonder if it would a bad thing to be a man. Sarah had few memories of the modern world and what she remembered she didn&#39;t like, besides as a man there were fewer expectations.<br />
<br />
She looked at the hunters and found that she was jealous. She saw their powerful muscles and she wanted the same. Sarah thought back to the hunt and remembered the excitement. Her new fathers pride, and the young boys faces full of awe and respect. Chatok hanging onto every word. The girls looks of desire.<br />
<br />
Sarah finished her work, and stood to deliver the spoils. Her path took her near the banks of The Great River. Sarah felt her eyes being drawn further down the river, where the women of the tribe were just finishing their evening bath. She found that she couldn&#39;t look away from the girls. The stunning girls with colorfully decorated braids. Their brightly-colored beads glittered in the evening sunlight, damp braids framing their faces perfectly. Sarah couldn&#39;t resist flexing her arms in the air to give them a show; her biceps and pectorals were ephasized. Sarah had never found herself looking at another girl like this, but every so often his brown eyes locked with one of the girls their smiles sending a feeling of pleasure down Sarah’s spine and gave her a pleasurable feeling between her legs.<br />
<br />
Sarah had the flat chest of a teen boy, and realized she didn&#39;t miss her breasts. Where once was fat was lean muscle. Her arms were different too, they were thicker with dense muscle. She felt a strength that she didn&#39;t have before. She felt her body losing its softness. Her legs lost their silkiness becoming more suited to a teen-aged male. Her legs started to itch and knew it meant that she was sprouting leg hair. Sarah looked at her arms and watched her skin darkening to match the tribe, she felt her scalp itch and knew the hair on her head become her new peoples dark brown brown - her dirty blond coloring faded away.<br />
<br />
Sarah looked for Maa&#39;ti, but she couldn&#39;t find her. Sarah knew time had almost run out, but she couldn&#39;t find it in herself to care. She heard Aminu saying, &quot;Those girls are attractive aren&#39;t they?&quot; Chatok muttered, &quot;I&#39;m not interested, but Saa&#39;rok might be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah agreed with Aminu, but said nothing and crouched at the riverside alongside Chatok to wash herself. She washed her arms, and saw the changes. The once light skin now had the same dark pigmentation as the rest of the tribe. She washed her face and felt its shape with her rough hands - her once thin nose was now broad, both her eyes a different shape, and he mouth had wider lips. She could no longer imagine herself as the white girl she was.<br />
<br />
In fact, the thought of having light skin made her insides squirm. She now understood intimately the pride her black tribe(class)mates had shown in their heritage. It made her feel ashamed of her past dismissal. Now she suspected she was in the distant past among their forefathers, the boy she was becoming might even be one of their ancestors. Even if she could go back to being a girl, she wasn&#39;t sure<br />
she wanted to lose her wonderful dark skin even with the very real discrimination that existed in her world.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts were interrupted by Nequi, &quot;Deep thoughts, son?&quot; he asked. Sarah could feel herself slipping into Saa&#39;rok mindset in the presence of his father. Saa&#39;rok answered, &quot;No, father I was distracted.&quot; Nequi&#39;s eyes gleamed with humor. &quot;Perhaps you were looking at the girls?&quot; Saa&#39;rok admitted his admiration, &quot;Yes, Father I was.&quot; Nequi placed his broad hands on his son&#39;s back, &quot;My son do you are becoming a man. It is only natural you would take interest in the women. One day you will take a bride, and I will see your union.&quot; Nequi stood and said, &quot;Now, I will leave you to your thoughts. I will await you at the tribe&#39;s feast.&quot; Sarah had seemlessly became Saa&#39;rok, and she couldn&#39;t tell herself apart. She could feel a yearning in her soul to be Saa&#39;rok, and welcomed it.<br />
<br />
Sarah grabbed a water bowl a topped it off. She saw her reflection and saw how masculine she looked. She watched how the last traces of femininity faded, her excitement grew as she bulked up. Her hands rough and calloused grew fully to male proportions much like her bare feet which had never seen coverings. Shoulders broadened and hips narrow. She felt pride that she was becoming a man.<br />
<br />
She once again looked at the girls, and she felt aroused. She knew what was coming; it would mark that she was fully male. She found a secluded area and took of the tightening loincloth. She adjusted the posture of her crouch to let her legs spread a bit wider. Sarah felt pleasurable sensation and groaned as a penis and testicles took the place of her vagina. The new man felt incredible in his new body; the testosterone flowing through his body made him feel powerful. He refastened the loin and went to meet the others. He was Saa&#39;rok now, a hunter of the ancient world to whom modern technology was foreign, and he would live out his days as a man of the tribe.</p>
