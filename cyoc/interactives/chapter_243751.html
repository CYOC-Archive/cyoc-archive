<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In truth, the direct aftermath of performing the essence transfer and making his choice permanent, through to the remainder of the afternoon and evening passed like a blur for Ethan. Maybe it was some coping mechanism that his brain was using, or perhaps he was in some kind of shock, but from the moment of departing Eric&#39;s room all the way to the following morning when he was getting ready for school, he didn&#39;t recall very much.<br />
<br />
It was only when he was dropping Eric off -- his little brother&#39;s cargo shorts highlighting a plump rounded bulge, and with a grin plastered from ear to ear -- that his brain was properly kicked into gear for his own day at school.<br />
<br />
This was it -- his first day in a world that had changed.<br />
<br />
Well, technically, it was him that was different, and not the world itself, but there was a distinction from how things previously were that could now never be undone.<br />
<br />
In a way, it was still the same as being swapped, but in another sense, everything was COMPLETELY different.<br />
<br />
He was pulling into the school parking lot when he realised something else too: he was wearing a pair of his childish underwear, having put them on without even thinking because they were so comfortable and fitting. Not only that but he hadn&#39;t stuffed them at all, and it was only the saving grace of having a loose pair of jeans on that prevented it from being all too obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I might need to buy more briefs like these. My old ones are too roomy. I don&#39;t need as much space now.&quot; Ethan was caught up thinking about it all the way to his locker and then through most of his first couple of classes, absently responding to greetings from other students and questions from teachers as the minutes and then hours ticked by. The fact that it wasn&#39;t an indulgence anymore, but now an actual practical consideration was mindblowing for him. He also knew it was bizarre for a seventeen year old to be thinking about what kind of cartoon art and vivid colours he wanted, but he couldn&#39;t help it. &quot;I think I&#39;ll get at least one of every design. I need comfortable kid underwear that fits my kid cock, though I can&#39;t let anyone at school see.&quot;<br />
<br />
What would they think if they could see that part of him today? Would they wonder where the stud had gone, with the plain satin boxers overstuffed with his teenage endowment? Would they laugh, or just point in shock at how he appeared?<br />
<br />
It was these thoughts that stayed in his head as he ate lunch and vacantly went along with the conversation of the guys that he often sat with. Those self-involved thoughts continued up until he went into the boys&#39; bathroom right before the bell to relieve himself, when he saw the urinals.<br />
<br />
For some reason ... he felt compelled to use one.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t even sure why exactly. He just knew that it was how big boys peed -- and despite his change, he was still a big boy, right? He was normal, a teenager turning into an adult, and he was going to do it like the other guys did! He just didn&#39;t want anybody to see, so after doublechecking the coast was clear, he unzipped and positioned himself. Knowing the stream wouldn&#39;t go far enough, he was half straddling the bowl, left hand on the wall for balance while he pulled himself free with his right.<br />
<br />
Wanting to watch but feeling too embarrassed to even look down, he stared at the wall tiling in front of him, directing the action by touch alone. Holding himself between thumb and index, he took extra care gripping his tiny shaft. It was impossible to take it in hand like the average teen would -- like he USED to -- and even as attentive as he was being now, his fingers still felt enormous and unwieldy on his delicate child-size cock, like a giant was doing the job for him.<br />
<br />
Even though he&#39;d experienced it before when swapped with Eric, now the details felt exaggerated and shocking, like a slap in the face. The thin higher-pitched sound was one thing -- like a younger boy peeing -- but moreso was how SLOW it was. What normally would have taken him less than ten seconds with his former python, was only going at half the rate. When it finally dribbled to a stop, he had counted a couple of seconds past twenty. Face red, Ethan shook it dry and tucked himself away without peeking, knowing that from now on, it was just a fact of life.<br />
<br />
Bathroom breaks were just going to take a bit more time.<br />
<br />
Coming into the home stretch of classes, he began to get himself into the right headspace for swim practice. Of course, it was the most apprehensive portion of his day, with the most potential risk attached, and though he had been through similar many times previously -- as with everything in his strange new world -- it felt very different now.<br />
<br />
Ethan lingered after the other guys had left the changing rooms for the pool, donning his speedo and pulling out the bundle of stuffing. As he began applying it, thoughts were racing through his head. Before, it was justified because he was experimenting with swaps and it was necessary when borrowing his little brother&#39;s junk. Now, the truth was simply that he was really small, and he couldn&#39;t let his teammates see. His fake secret had become a real one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to do this now. It&#39;s necessary because I&#39;m- ... I&#39;m not swapped,&quot; Ethan whispered to himself, as he tucked the fabric pieces into the speedo pouch. &quot;It&#39;s necessary because I have a really small cock, and I&#39;m going to have to do this a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
At least, he thought, as he finished up and left the changing room to join the others, it wouldn&#39;t matter if he got hard.<br />
<br />
Nobody was going to see it -- getting aroused wouldn&#39;t be a problem now.<br />
<br />
Despite his nerves, practice went smoothly, and he got his laps in, making some decent times, before relay training with the others and a chat from the coach. Then it was back to the changing rooms, where he managed to dress without raising any suspicion, just like normal. Then he did something he was even more scared of doing.<br />
<br />
He sent a message to Lucas.<br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s boyfriend hadn&#39;t been at swim practice because of a scheduling conflict, so he sent a text asking Lucas to come over after school. Ethan knew he had to take this step and show Lucas how he now was, for the sake of their relationship going anywhere further. Though Lucas had encouraged Ethan to do what he thought was right -- and had implied he would be fine with whatever Ethan chose -- there was still some fear that he might get cold feet once he saw the results.<br />
<br />
Still, Ethan knew he had to show him.<br />
<br />
Stopping by his little brother&#39;s school, Eric got in the car and Ethan was surprised to see him holding his bag in front of his body. As soon as he was safely inside, it became clear he was shielding his crotch, because his shorts were pushed out in a massive tent. Immediately, he began to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the morning, it was under control, but I&#39;ve been thinking about it all the time. Like, ALL the time! I was growled at more than once for not paying attention.&quot; Eric was rambling. &quot;I thought I was used to it from before, you know? But after lunch it was too much! It was like halfway hard first, then it kept going all the way, for, like, minutes a time! For my last class I had to walk all the way here with my bag like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Right as he finished talking, the day&#39;s novel frustration finally off his chest to the only person who could understand it, Eric did what he had been waiting to do. Without even asking permission, he unzipped and let his new monster pop free. In relief, the discomfort gone, Eric sighed and relaxed in the car seat.<br />
<br />
With nothing really to say and no advice to give that hadn&#39;t been heard before, Ethan just nodded and began driving them home. Every so often though, he would glance down at Eric&#39;s lap, the enormous specimen on display next to him. Eric was just being Eric, and the oversized hardon looked right at home on him -- more natural than ever.<br />
<br />
The moment they got home and it was clear their father wasn&#39;t around, Eric turned directly to Ethan and flatly told him: &quot;I&#39;m gonna suck it until it stops being hard, so I might be busy for a while. Later!&quot; Then he made a beeline for his room, his bag clutched excitedly in one hand, his long thick naked erection waving back and forth as he hustled away.<br />
<br />
Ethan simply let him go and headed to his own room. He couldn&#39;t help but say it out loud, because it felt too silly as just a thought to be real.<br />
<br />
&quot;My younger brother can blow himself.&quot; The phrase sounded ridiculous on its own, so much so that he had to repeat it with more detail. &quot;My eleven year old brother is so well hung that he can suck his own dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuckling to himself, he closed the door to his room, dumped his own bag, and sat down on the bed.<br />
<br />
Everything felt so absurd, like he had stumbled into a hallucinatory trip -- and the essence transfer&#39;s bodily change seemed half-real, a fever dream that may or may not have actually occurred. There was a part of it that didn&#39;t seem real yet, even close to twenty-four hours later, like what he had chosen was on the mental backburner and couldn&#39;t yet sink in.<br />
<br />
Yet, a new text from Lucas saying he would be over in a few minutes did the job to shake Ethan out of his fog of surreality.<br />
<br />
He had to have his mind in order for when his boyfriend arrived -- he needed to be mentally prepared for whatever response he would get, and that meant not getting lost in his own thoughts and introspection, and properly accept how he now was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to MAKE it sink in. I&#39;ve gotta accept it. I need to get naked and see myself for how I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Ethan began to strip.<br />
<br />
His eyes were closed as he removed the last layer, his underwear, and stepped out of them. Opening them, he looked down at himself.<br />
<br />
There, in the middle of his groin, sat his new and permanently tiny penis. Smaller than what his brother formerly possessed; with girth less than his pinky and length a little more than an inch, it was the true definition of a child-cock. His balls were not more than small cherries, and drawn close in a sac that was delightfully tight. All of it was not just reduced in size, but youthfully smooth, soft, and unable to grow hair, as he literally had the genitals of a preteen kid version of himself.<br />
<br />
Perhaps most amazing of all though, was the coloration.<br />
<br />
When swapped with Eric, the skin tone hadn&#39;t matched for either of them.<br />
<br />
Now, it did.<br />
<br />
What had previously just masqueraded the part, was instead a seamless naturalised replica of it.<br />
<br />
He now looked as if his miniature penis was something he had been born with, the appearance of it fitting him like a glove.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s mine, and it&#39;s not much more than an inch long soft,&quot; he whispered to himself. &quot;Just one inch. One.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was something about that number.<br />
<br />
A knock on the door brought Ethan sharply out of his self-inspection, and he snatched up a towel and put it around his waist before opening the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Lucas slipped into the room. Catching sight of Ethan&#39;s state of undress, he gave a wink. &quot;Were you getting ready for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I was.&quot; Ethan took in a nervous breath, and backed away next to his bed, though Lucas followed him with careful steps. &quot;You just arrived sooner than I thought. I- ... I want to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-show me? Right?&quot; Lucas interrupted him. &quot;I bet you&#39;re really scared about it, but you don&#39;t have to be. Why do you think I came over here so quickly? I want to see!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh.&quot; Ethan mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why don&#39;t you just take the towel off, and let me check you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
He hooked his finger in the hem, and when Ethan didn&#39;t stop him, despite the sheer terror of the moment, Lucas pulled it free, and dropped the towel down and away.<br />
<br />
Where once had been one of the most impressively big pieces of teenage libido, was instead the most juvenile dick he had seen on anyone after elementary school age. Even as Lucas watched, Ethan gave a mortified whimper and his cock stiffened, rising to its full glorious length of an inch and a half from just the attention alone. In one sense it was almost comical, as if someone had taken an image and digitally shrunk and de-aged the crotch to an extreme degree; an absurdly small child&#39;s genitals on a teenager&#39;s body. All the newly unoccupied additional prepubescent skin seemed like a massive smooth expanse surrounding Ethan&#39;s tiny junk. What should have been a disparity wasn&#39;t though, because -- and Lucas wasn&#39;t even sure why -- it just seemed right. Even the fact that Ethan was technically a kid in that crucial spot somehow didn&#39;t seem that bad at all.<br />
<br />
Actually, as Lucas stared a little longer, he felt something unexpected.<br />
<br />
He was becoming aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; His inner monologue exclaimed, his own cock stiffening from the sight. He was sure he&#39;d be able to accept Ethan, accommodate being a different sort of couple, but he wasn&#39;t expecting to be INTO it. &quot;I&#39;m ... really getting turned on by him like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t stop looking at it, and it was becoming this weird combination of chibi cute, and ... HOT. For some reason, on Ethan&#39;s well-built teenage body, the tiny stiff childish shaft with its pair of smooth tight balls, simply oozed sex appeal. Crouching, Lucas brought his finger up and lightly brushed it along the bottom of Ethan&#39;s miniscule testicles in fascination. They felt so soft and taut, the skin like silk, and Ethan moaned out loud from the touch, the sound making Lucas&#39; heart race.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sensitive!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas let both of them rest on his index finger, marveling at how light and small they felt. This was Ethan&#39;s entire boyhood! Then he began to gently tickle along the underside with his fingertip, causing Ethan to begin moaning softly but uncontrollably, the sound forced out as an involuntary response to being played with.<br />
<br />
&quot;He really can&#39;t help himself when I touch him there,&quot; Lucas thought. He jiggled the right testicle with the same finger, causing it to move inside the sac, and Ethan moaned again on cue, his mini dick twitching too.<br />
<br />
Why was this all SO much sexier than he was expecting?<br />
<br />
In a swift move, Lucas quickly leaned forward, sliding the entire package into his mouth in one go. The scent and taste were even somehow not like a teen, lacking the muskier hormonal feel, and was almost ... sweet? Lucas didn&#39;t know if that was the correct description, but Ethan&#39;s tiny immature cock was a delicacy that hardly made it onto his mouth properly. His lips covered most of the shaft, and with the tip of his tongue he stimulated all of it at once. He moved in quick swirling circles around and around, and it took only three rotations before Ethan groaned, his dick spasming as he came. There was a splash of liquid that Lucas barely noticed, but to his amazement, Ethan was hardening again only a few seconds later, his refractory time as small as his genitals.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s so sensitive! I- ... I can&#39;t-&quot;<br />
<br />
He cut himself off with renewed moans as Lucas began to suck instead of swirling, and they only made it another five seconds or so, before Ethan let out a second humiliated orgasmic staccato. The child penis shuddered in Lucas&#39; mouth and another light smattering of cum hit his tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I- ... it happens so fast! I can&#39;t hold it, I just-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush.&quot; Lucas only had to move his head back a fraction so the mini package left his mouth and he could talk. &quot;You&#39;ve got a superpower, actually. It feels extra good for you and you recharge extra fast. So why don&#39;t we see how many times in a row you can get off?&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Lucas leaned in again, and everything was sliding back into the pleasurable slippery wet warmth. Ethan wanted to reply, but all he could do was make incoherent sounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooohhhhhh,&quot; he exclaimed in a breathy whimper, thinking at the same time that he, too, very much wanted to find out.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
For Eric, the events of that Tuesday afternoon were unforgettable. There had always been a level of uncertainty, in his mind, whether or not Ethan really truly wanted to go through with it. In fact, as exciting as the &#39;essence transfer&#39; thing was, Eric was fully prepared for Ethan to back away and return to the arrangement they previously had. It was why the older brother&#39;s decision was both a surprise and the mental shock of realising he was about to transform himself physically, and irreversibly.<br />
<br />
Then, the transfer itself.<br />
<br />
Thinking back on it afterwards, Eric wished it had taken twice, three times, four times as long. He wished he could have stood there for an entire hour, watching it, feeling it happen, knowing he was becoming larger and larger, bit by bit.<br />
<br />
Everything about the experience was both magically and sensually alluring. The subtle incremental increase in weight as he grew, the base of his erect shaft and balls widening and thickening as it slowly expanded outward into the empty skin of his groin. The satisfying way his balls went from not touching, to brushing, to insistently pushing against his thighs as they swelled and the space diminished. The pubic hair growing in, first fine, but then a little thicker, until it matched what Ethan previously had.<br />
<br />
Except, of course, it was HIS pubic hair -- with HIS colouring, HIS skin tone underneath.<br />
<br />
More than anything though: the pushing sensation of the transfer itself.<br />
<br />
There was something about the internal pressure of his genitals growing that felt very gratifying. The way his erection stayed fully hard, but continually crept outward, millimetre by straining millimetre, was addictive.<br />
<br />
Even after reaching the end, there was the additional happy surprise of getting a half inch more than he was expecting. It was poetic that his age and the number of inches on his cock were the same number, and that fact was especially fun to think about. There was even a part of him that thought it would be cool if he grew an inch every year until he was eighteen and had the largest cock in the world.<br />
<br />
As badly as he wanted to masturbate once he was alone, Eric opted to exercise his willpower. He decided he wasn&#39;t going to do any kind of self pleasuring until after school on the following day, for two main reasons. Firstly, that he wanted to test his resolve was still strong, and there was no better time to do that when put next to a very sizable temptation. Secondly, that letting the anticipation build would make it feel even better, and what rush was there anyhow?<br />
<br />
This was his cock, and it wasn&#39;t about to go anywhere.<br />
<br />
Then, Wednesday.<br />
<br />
Right up until around midday, everything was firmly under control. In an emotional sense it was perhaps one of the best days ever for Eric, as he had never felt more confident or more alive than he had before. His body was truly correct now -- just like he had told Ethan, the ring had made them how they were MEANT to be.<br />
<br />
Physically, however, Eric began to realise that being the temporarily-swapped owner was not the same as being the original owner. He always thought he had everything managed, but now that it was fully and completely his, those urges turned out to be a lot stronger than anticipated. At first, it was just semi-hard on and off, then fully so every few minutes. By the final class, it was completely stiff with no suggestion of calming down at all.<br />
<br />
At home after school, Eric did what he had to in order to fix the problem, and got busy with that the second he reached his room. Still, even though he sucked himself off twice, his cock kept randomly getting excited anyhow. He couldn’t focus properly on his homework, and it took a lot longer to finish than usual.<br />
<br />
Thursday brought with it more of the same. Though Eric enjoyed it when people noticed his pride and joy, the random erections were still concerning because it wasn’t exactly the way Eric wanted to be noticed. For the most part, he was able to keep it minimised, though gym class presented a challenge. In particular, it made him think about a couple of things that had certainly been present during the temporary swaps, but not really occurred to him before. It seemed the details were jumping out at him now it was all permanent, and Eric had to wonder if Ethan was noticing his own details and changes too, like he was seeing what had previously gone unnoticed.<br />
<br />
One thing was that when both sitting and standing, his stance was instinctively wider. Standing it felt natural just to have his legs ever so slight further apart. Sitting, he would manspread somewhat, not out of any desire to show off, but merely because it was more comfortable. Walking too, because the comparative weight meant his centre of gravity had shifted lower. His stride was different, and he had to think about the way he moved. Adjusting his habits wasn&#39;t completely automatic, and this led to some awkward moments with things like jogging, playing various class games, doing the agility course, even rope climbing. The latter activity had been a clumsy one, with Eric&#39;s added crotch weight making his shorts sag as he shimmied upward with his hands occupied, causing his pubes and boxers to creep into view and his classmates to snicker.<br />
<br />
By Friday, the randomness was less random and more frequent, and Eric&#39;s arousal was more a worry than a simple concern. It felt like teachers were less patient with him and with a lower tolerance for any time-wasting or disobedient behaviour, as if he had morphed into a recalcitrant teen a couple of years early. At soccer practice, the coach even took him aside to talk privately, and although the man never outright said it, at that point Eric was very much aware of the subtext behind what was being spoken. It was a short friendly-ish lecture about expectations and presentation, and how some people are lucky to be &#39;blessed with certain gifts or talents’, but that individual pride shouldn&#39;t come before team spirit, etcetera. Eric dutifully listened, though in his head he understood the coach was talking circles around the main message, which amounted to: &#39;you have a very large penis which is remarkable for a boy your age, but please don&#39;t advertise it too much on the field.&#39;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t like Eric was choosing to make it obvious, but he nonetheless nodded and agreed.<br />
<br />
Then came game day, on Saturday.<br />
<br />
Normally, Ethan would have taken him to play, both as transport there and supporting him from the sidelines as any good big brother would. This week he couldn&#39;t, because of a swim meet that both he and Lucas were attending. Eric knew Ethan wanted to come to the game and had tried to rearrange things to make it happen, but the timing simply wasn&#39;t possible. While it would have been nice to see him there, Eric wasn&#39;t bothered too much by Ethan&#39;s absence. He had been preparing himself both physically and mentally for playing, the coach&#39;s tactfully-expressed message still in mind. He was determined to control himself and enjoy the day.<br />
<br />
There was one slight problem. In the rush to get to the grounds on time, Eric managed to leave behind his soccer shorts with the clean laundry at home. That wasn&#39;t a serious issue, as there were spares. Unfortunately, the only free ones were from the next grade down and were smaller than the comfortably loose style of his own. Though ill-fitting and almost too tight, they were the same slippery fabric, and Eric thought with a bit of time to get used to them, he would be fine.<br />
<br />
He could deal with this, he reasoned. He wasn&#39;t about to let some wardrobe problems mess up his day. He was in control!<br />
<br />
What could go wrong?<br />
<br />
Being a substitute, Eric spent all of the first half on the sidelines, waiting to see if he was needed to go on. He remained benched for all of the third quarter, but as the final quarter was underway, the coach told him to do a couple of laps around the field to get warmed up again. Finally, Eric thought. This was what he was waiting for.<br />
<br />
Except, that was when the REAL problem began.<br />
<br />
He had barely gone fifty feet when the first effects kicked in. It was a combination of the constricted smaller soccer shorts, Eric&#39;s overactive unruly cock, and the amazing satin-type fabric. Every step had his entire crotch bobbing up and down where it was confined, the friction on his sensitive parts feeling far too good. The rubbing fabric felt progressively better the further he ran, and with an increasing heart rate and growing fear, he tried to go slower, to not exacerbate it -- but that didn&#39;t work.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s problem only got worse.<br />
<br />
All his psychological control and discipline of mind was failing him, and his pants were pushing outward at the groin, no matter that they were so carefully secured. He even caught some hushed comments from some of the parents watching the game, and glances his way that seemed scandalised by his increasingly-obvious indecency. He was just a kid, but he could feel it in their gazes, could almost hear them saying even kids these days could be strange degenerate weirdos.<br />
<br />
His face was hot and he felt kinda scared, and strangely upset. Somehow, he finished his first lap, but now he was fully hard, his undersized shorts tented out obscenely. Eric was starting to panic, his thoughts full of dismay at how many of the spectators had noticed him, and also how good he was feeling.<br />
<br />
Dangerously good.<br />
<br />
A part of him knew the stimulation was far too much, that he couldn&#39;t keep doing what he was doing.<br />
<br />
In fact, he knew he was probably not more than a couple of dozen seconds from having a terrible ... accident.<br />
<br />
But, thankfully, the coach interrupted him first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you forget about the warmup and head back to get changed, son.&quot; The man gestured to the changing room, a not-unkind but quite serious expression on his face. It was phrased like a question, but clearly it wasn&#39;t a suggestion. &quot;You can go put on your normal clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Eric couldn&#39;t look him in the eye, and turned to head towards the changing room.<br />
<br />
Even walking still felt good, but at least he was able to calm slightly. Taking deep breaths, he felt himself teeter from 99% of the way there back to 98, 97, and away from that terrible brink. Trembling, he made it to the entrance to the changing room just as the final whistle went, the game finishing as he staggered inside.<br />
<br />
With immense care, Eric very slowly pulled off his shorts and shirt. He didn&#39;t want ANYTHING touching him there, because he was FAR too sensitive to risk it. He just stood unmoving, at last given a chance to cool off in the open air.<br />
<br />
Until ... his teammates arrived.<br />
<br />
Buoyant after winning the game, there were four boys in the first group to enter, well ahead of the others. They saw him straight away, standing next to his clothing and bag, his massive erection on display as he tried to relax. Before Eric could say anything meaningful, they were clustering around him, their voices a mix of awe, jealousy, and surprise at seeing him both naked and hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Eric. I didn&#39;t know it was THIS big!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap, that&#39;s amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whooooa!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are SO lucky!&quot;<br />
<br />
And then ... touch.<br />
<br />
Eric was physically smaller than all of them, so he wasn&#39;t about to stop them, and the first&#39;s lack of resistance was followed by the other three. Exploratory and not intentionally sexual, four hands lightly touched him, and like overactive guests at a petting zoo, began to squeeze and feel Eric&#39;s shaft. His mind went blank, the pleasure spiking, and he was again at 97, 98, and rising. Paralysed by it, feebly wanting them to stop but unable to concentrate on speech, Eric couldn&#39;t do more than shakily exhale.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t even masturbation. It was just touch, but on the feverishly aroused skin, each movement was like ripples of pleasurable lightning. One hand was lightly gripping him near the base, another squeezing the spongy glans, the other two sliding across the top of this shaft, the movement of their touch leaving burning trails that felt incredible.<br />
<br />
It took less than a dozen seconds of attention from four pushy preteen boys, and Eric was back at 99, then ... 100.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuunnnnghhhh!&quot; Eric groaned. His cock jerked, and thick goopy ropes shot out of it. The two boys directly in front got most of it, the cum spraying onto their hands and legs. He groaned again, further pulses of it splattering onto their fingers and forearms, as the unbearably mortifying joy of it surged through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahah! Gross!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, that&#39;s so awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It went everywhere!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, mine doesn&#39;t do that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get out of these, the others will be here soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys were laughing and wiping off their hands, pulling off their shirts from the mess, the marvel of Eric&#39;s enormous penis temporarily forgotten in the aftermath of his explosive release. Kicking his previously frozen body into gear, Eric rapidly turned to his stuff. Swiping his towel once over his softening python to clean the worst off, he snatched his street clothes up, pulled his pants and tee on, crammed his belongings into his bag haphazardly, and bolted for the door.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
The walk home for Eric was difficult. He managed to escape before the rest of the team arrived and made sure to vanish before any adults could see him and say anything. It took a good number of minutes to walk, but it wasn&#39;t too far for him to go on his own, and there was absolutely no way he was willing to accept a ride from anybody at that point in time. He was upset, embarrassed, ashamed, and scared by what had happened. He didn&#39;t want to be around his peers or their parents or anybody that had attended the match.<br />
<br />
More than that, he was also angry at himself to some degree, that he hadn&#39;t been able to control his own body. Being swapped was one thing, but it seemed like owning it for real was a lot tougher. He knew he couldn&#39;t go repeating what had just happened anywhere else, because he&#39;d start getting in trouble for it with adults. He was eleven, but he knew more about orgasms and self-pleasure than boys who had actually entered puberty and were years older, except ... the rest of the world wouldn&#39;t see it that way.<br />
<br />
To them, he was just a kid, and kids weren&#39;t supposed to be doing what Eric was doing.<br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t his reality, though.<br />
<br />
By the time he reached the front door of the house, the stress had subsided, though he still felt pretty bad about it all. Dumping his dirty boots, he went to the bathroom first, stripped off, and then stepped under the warm shower spray for just long enough to clean himself off. Not bothering to get dressed, Eric wandered back to his room, still feeling glum, and plopped down onto his bed.<br />
<br />
He needed to deal with this issue.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t let this same problem happen again.<br />
<br />
Staring down at his crotch, he admired it.<br />
<br />
Even soft, it sat on his plump balls, long and fat, with smooth skin and fine hardly-visible veins. Eric didn&#39;t know anything about aesthetics, but to him it looked like some work of art.<br />
<br />
It was perfect.<br />
<br />
He needed to be good enough for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; He told it, the apology delivered in a soft voice. &quot;I want to be better for you. I- ... I promise not to take you for granted. I&#39;ll get better at handling you, making you feel satisfied! I don&#39;t think I understood before, but I&#39;ll work at it. I&#39;ll be worthy of you, I swear!&quot;<br />
<br />
As if responding to the apology, his cock began to harden and swell, rising from his lap towards his face, like a flower meeting the sun. It was almost as if it was reaching out to him, and Eric felt a rush of relief at his body&#39;s seeming acceptance of the promise. Impulsively, he bent down and lightly kissed the tip.<br />
<br />
As his lips made contact, for a moment Eric wondered what it was like to kiss someone the way older teens in relationships did. It didn&#39;t seem fair that he had a mature penis, but he wasn&#39;t allowed to kiss anyone like that because he was eleven. Instead though, there came the sudden compulsion to learn how, and then he had a brainwave. He could learn by practicing -- on himself.<br />
<br />
With that, he leaned in again and planted another kiss, except this time, in his imagination, it was another person. Closing his eyes, he tenderly held his shaft, his lips and tongue slipping around the head. It was fantastic; thick and swollen and warm, sliding around his lips in answer. Eric couldn&#39;t think of it like a toy now. It was more akin to a lover, and he began to wish that it could kiss back -- who needed girls when he had something this amazing between his legs?<br />
<br />
For the next couple of minutes he practiced and practiced, with everything gloriously stiff and wet and slippery. Finally Eric pulled back, dazed, his mouth and chin wet with saliva, his pupils dilated from sheer pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a good teacher,&quot; he told it, his speech nearly slurring with sex-drunk happiness. &quot;I wanna ... suck you now, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he was in yet again, and the whole thing slid into his mouth and the kissing was sucking instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmrmmmmphhhhh,&quot; he mumbled around it, slobbering and pressing forward, wanting to worship and praise it, tell it why it was so great. &quot;My cock is really large. It&#39;s so long and thick.&quot; Slurping, voice muffled, he concentrated on how girthy it was, how his lips stretched around it. &quot;Nothing can beat it. It&#39;s the biggest. I&#39;m the biggest.&quot; Pushing down, he felt his dick forcing its way further in, like it had so many times before, and he relaxed more to let it do so. &quot;My penis is huge and awesome and amazing ... and I&#39;m gonna make sure it&#39;s happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, Eric began to repeatedly swallow, the wet lining of his throat squeezing and massaging his glans and making him see stars, his tongue lathering all over the shaft. His manhood pulsed, swelling even further, and he let out a low moan as it began to shoot, a blissful smile crossing his face as he finally completed his apology to his cock.</p>
