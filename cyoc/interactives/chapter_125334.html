<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer stepped outside. The cool, dew-soaked grass and soft dirt caused her malleable feet to somewhat sink into the earth. Moving to one leg, she brushed off of the bottom of her heels, yet still felt something was a little off. She opened a large hole in the sole of her foot and saw that a rather sharp pebble had somehow ended up completely burrowed into the soft flesh. Picking it out, she was suddenly struck by the bizarre reality of the situation and the nonchalant attitude she had taken up when dealing with it. Placing her foot back in the ground while reminding herself to keep it slightly more firm, she laughed gently at her good fortune. <br />
Still laughing, she casually leaned one hand on the cabin’s exterior. Each finger thickened to the width of a water bottle and shot out rapidly. Her thumb and pinky finger darted in opposite directions, curving bonelessly around the corners of the cabin to either side, while the other three went over the roof. All five eventually met and merged on the side opposite Jennifer. With a sneer, she clenched her misshapen parody of a hand, and the sound of creaking wood filled the quiet night. Support beams snapped in two and the ancient planks collapsed inwards. Closing her grasp while thickening her fingers, the debris of the entire structure was soon bunched up into a pile half the size of the concrete foundation it was built on. <br />
Thinking something wrong, Jennifer realized that the idiot she had left gasping in the living room probably hadn’t even left before her little display of power. Shooting her neck up a good fifty feet over the treeline, hair trailing behind like a comet, she scanned the nearby back roads for any cars or trucks passing by. Seeing none, she swelled the rest of her body to match her height. With two massive hands, she simply pushed all of the rubble into the river the cabin had been built beside. Shrinking down to a more human size, she walked to the now vacant concrete slab of foundation and lay down, gazing at the stars.<br />
It was a clear night, and the noises of animals startled by the clamor had already died down. The concrete was rough and jagged, and the surface was still littered with splinters that dug into her back, but she decided not to let it bother her. The constellations were out in full force that night, and shined brightly to the point that they looked close enough to touch. Jennifer could, of course, do exactly that, but spending a few centuries for the reward of a burnt hand didn’t sound like her idea of a fun time. She did, however think that taking the time out of a couple days to punch the moon would be pretty cool, but she ultimately shelved that idea for later.<br />
What DID she want to do now? She began toying with her fingers; pulling them off one hand, sticking them on the other, forming a makeshift Jacob’s ladder, then balling both hands together into a uniform mass before reforming and restarting. The one thing she knew she desperately needed to avoid was boredom; she had a very long life ahead of her and it would be a crime to blow all of her opportunities in a week. Large scale destruction and domination of the world’s population definitely needed to be saved for for the future, as it would be a little bit hard to calm things down after that. Melding her long locks of hair into a rough hand, she pushed herself upwards into a seated position, and let a few ideas go through her head. Starting some kind of urban legend, superheroism, thievery... hell, even just going home and leading a double life had some sort of deceptive charm to it…<br />
Jennifer’s thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a rather cold gust of wind, and for the first time in a while, she became acutely aware of her own nakedness. She still was in the exaggeratedly curvy form she had taken back in the cabin, and she soon found herself becoming increasingly aroused as the cool air continued to tickle her skin. Now standing up again, she let her skin loosen up as a visible tremor trickled up and down her torso. “I don’t see anything wrong with a little reward after such a successful day…”<br />
Before she had even finished her sentence, she had already formed a sizable member out of her right hand. She fell backwards onto the concrete, causing the backside of her now completely claylike body to deform from impact as her entire right arm extended farther and farther. It made a full circle around her prone body, slithering to and fro until it found its destination right between her thighs. Like a snake, the appendage reared up, poised directly over her welcoming slit. <br />
However, the impending strike never came as she was interrupted yet again; this time by a flash of inspiration. With a crack of her whip-like arm, the entire phallic extremity detached and was flung a fair few feet away towards the very edge of the foundation. Losing all shape as it hit the ground, the mound twitched as it multiplied in size several times over. Not bothering to repair the damage caused by her falling about, Jennifer’s viscous body rushed half-formed, like a breaking wave, towards the swelling mass that was now beginning to form five distinct protrusions.<br />
The five-pointed blob was now taking a very clear human form, one that was very much to Jennifer’s liking. Biting her lip, she watched in giddy anticipation as her second mass began to grow a very distinct sixth point, right between the now almost completely formed legs. <br />
The new body, now fully defined, had been made to look like a popular pro athlete Jennifer had spent an embarrassing amount of time fantasizing about back when she was human. She doubted, however, that even the real version owned a rod as impressive as the specimen before her. She had him stand up as she wrapped an elongated torso around him. Small wisps of herself caressed him gently as she spoke to him in a drippy, breathy voice. <br />
“Well… I didn’t expect to see you around here…” Her torso had now made two full clockwise rotations around his muscular chest. One hand was on his shoulder as she sent the other spiraling down counterclockwise. “But it looks like you are just as happy to see me as I am to see you…” she continued, ending her hand’s journey with a very bold grab. “What say I show you what fun I can have with this new body of mine?”<br />
Unfortunately, her half-closed, lust-filled eyes shot open with embarrassment when she realized her stupidity at waiting for an answer. Reminding herself on how to manage multiple faces at once, she livened up her “boyfriend’s” dead-eyed expression as she let him let out a masculine laugh. Clearly, brushing up on her acting talent was going to be a big concern for her in the future. But for now, mood restored, she was ready to finally take her prize.<br />
The great loops of Jennifer’s body that had wrapped her man so tightly dropped away, coalescing above him as he was pushed to the hard floor. Jennifer had restricted the stretching ability of his segment of her body, but the mutable flesh was still able to withstand the blunt force. The stretchy ball of Jennifer that was over him exploded into what could barely even be called a humanoid form anymore. There were still four limbs, but they bent without joints in many directions, and extended several feet past standard limitations. Her face was relatively normal, but the hair that burst from her head like a firework consisted of thick, vibrant, strands that clung and grasped at her lover. Figuring she had wasted enough time as it was, she ordered his shaft to immediately jump to full attention. Her vagina opened up on her ill-defined form, far wider and somewhat higher up than it would be on any other woman, while the pseudo-muscles of its inner walls writhed independently. <br />
Jennifer herself was the smaller of the two forms (stretched-out limbs notwithstanding), yet she showed a very clear control of the situation. She thrusted herself down upon his body as the near foot of his manhood was swallowed without a trace between her thighs. Once inside, his shaft was bombarded by the shifting planes of flesh that made up her insides. As they brushed up against it, additional clitorisis reached out, rubbing their way along. Any human would have likely been injured in this labyrinth of flesh, but the malleability of Jennifer’s male counterpart allowed his rod to be bent and battered, all while remaining fully erect. As a near reflex, she increased the raw elasticity of their bodies, causing their efforts in pushing together to bounce back with great force and amplifying the power of their thrusts. The fiery expression she had donned during Kyle’s torment returned to her as waves of pleasure crashed over her, striking her to her core and serving as the catalyst for more changes. A second penis grew directly above the original on the crotch of her double as Jennifer grew an additional mouth just opposite on her torso. Her lips stretched out and latched around this second member, while her tongue branched and forked around it, assaulting it from all sides. <br />
Jennifer then threw aside all illusions of restraint as she allowed every inch of her body to gain the tremendous sensitivity that her clitoris had. At this point, anything Jennifer did to modify her form bought intense spikes of pleasure. Her hair grew out, wild and disheveled, and two additional rows of arms sprouted from her shoulders, rubbing and gripping at her counterpart top to bottom. Caught in the throes of ecstasy, her entire body began to develop in a dazzling display of abstract beauty. Small tendrils blossomed into organic fleur-de-lis and spiraling patterns danced across her skin. Pieces that had become detached in the process found their way back, stretching in wide arcs over the sea of sexual chaos before incorporating themselves back in, accompanying the action with a sensual tingling feeling. <br />
Finally, she could bear it no longer. Transferring all sense from both bodies into herself, her dutiful lovemaking companion began to dissolve back into a featureless mass. Every inch of her tightened and quivered before finally piercing the orgasmic veil. <br />
It was so far beyond anything Jennifer had ever felt before, she could hardly control herself. Every movement of her overly sensitive flesh compounded her pleasure, which in turn led to even more wild stretching. She had entered an unending loop of undiluted joy, and her enchanted body reflected it. Tendrils, limbs, and full bodies all expanded from the central point of her lovemaking, covering large swaths of the clearing. The concrete cracked, trees were uprooted, and moaning was heard by the woodland animals long into the night…<br />
____________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Jennifer sat on top of the town’s tallest telephone tower, dressed in a winter coat and jeans, watching the sun turn the sky pink as it rose over a misty mountain range and the nearby forest. She had darkened her both of her eyes, pupils and whites, in order to allow herself to stare directly at the sun itself, and she was stunned by its beauty. Despite her big time status at school, she scarcely left the confines of her hometown, and the mountains had always seemed so far away. Today, however, Jennifer saw for the first time how close they really were, and how ready she was to make the journey beyond.<br />
When she had entered her orgasmic feedback last night, she eventually reached a point that she could not comprehend her own amounts of pleasure, and just stopped. She awoke an hour later as the memories of her experimentation made themselves known. She also realized that her hitting her “limit”, so to say, had only pushed the ceiling up even further. There truly was no end to the things she could do with her power. <br />
A few cars could finally be seen making their way across the roads way off in the distance. Early bird mortals heading off to mundane jobs. Jennifer coiled her way down the telephone tower. She took one last look at the cracked concrete, the ruined debris of the cabin, and her town as a whole. It was time to go over the next mountain.</p>
