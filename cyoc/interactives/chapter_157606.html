<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A little information before the story begins: <br />
<br />
You are a 16 year old teenager named Jacob Harrison, you are very shy and hate being in public places like schools, and parks. You enjoy writing when you are alone, however, and have a broad imagination.<br />
<br />
Your mother is 38 and named Samantha Harrison, she loves social activities like parties and plays and in many ways is the exact opposite of you. She doesn&#39;t understand being introverted and gets upset when you act shy out in public, she became worse when your father died of  a freak accident at his work. She isn&#39;t the best mother in the world to you but treats your sisters like saints.<br />
<br />
Your eldest sister is 19 and is named Kaitlin Harrison, she has many friends and her own car that your mom bought her for her birthday last year. She treats you like shit and will usually throw you under the bus and get you in trouble. She will support your mother in anything she does.<br />
<br />
Your older sister is 17 and is named Charlotte Harrison, she is well respected at the school you both go to and is usually the prettiest girl in the room. She isn&#39;t a complete asshole and will try to relate to you when you both are alone but as soon as Kaitlin or your mom was anywhere would start to throw you under the bus as well. Will mostly agree with your mom on anything she does but will disagree on some topics.<br />
<br />
Your dog who is 6 years old and a Sr. Bernard named Joshy, Loves everyone in the house but especially you and is partly the only reason you haven&#39;t ran away. Your mom will usually brag about him to her friends and will regularly bring him to events. And your sister wish he spent more time with them instead of you.<br />
<br />
Now let&#39;s begin....<br />
<br />
You had always been a very shy kid and never liked socially interacting with your peers any more than you had to, that was was why you had locked yourself in your room when your mom had organized a pool party with her friends and encouraged them to bring their children. Your mom was never an understanding person, this was evident when she forced him to where his swim clothes for her party, &quot;I don&#39;t care how shy you are! You&#39;re going to participate in my Backyard Bonanza whether you want to or not!&quot; you just nod as she hands you your new swim clothes.  &quot;I expect to see you in those clothes by the time I&#39;m finished getting ready&quot; she said as she headed for her bedroom, Your father died a couple years back only further driving your mothers bitterness and your older sisters were always trying to get on her good side. You sat on your bed and started to sigh, &quot;they&#39;ll never like me, so why bother&quot; you locked the door and lay down on your bed  hoping your mothers eventual wrath wouldn&#39;t come soon.<br />
<br />
That was when you noticed a tiny glint of light underneath your dresser...was that a ring?  You slid off your bed and crouched down to see a tiny ring that was somehow glowing, &quot;how did that get here?&quot; you say as you pick it up and slide it on, &quot;huh perfect fit, I guess I&#39;ll keep it on&quot;. You hear pounding on your door as your mom shouts from the other side, &quot;Jacob! Come out now! Guests are arriving&quot; You hear the doorbell ring and hear your mothers footsteps retreat from the your door and towards the front door. You again sigh as you look at the ring, &quot;I wish I could see the world through her eyes for once&quot; the ring suddenly glows bright temporarily blinding you causing you to stumble into a chair and you brace for the impact of the floor...but it never come. You open your eyes and instead of being in your room your staring at the front door and...are you taller? <br />
<br />
You spin around to get a better reference on where you were, as you do so you feel something on your chest spin with you, &quot;What? Oh my gosh! I have boobs!&quot; You say in surprise as you look down to see a set of large breasts protruding from your chest. You turn around again to face the hallway mirror that your mother had set up, so she could have a last minute check of her make up and stuff before leaving the house, and there she was staring back in confused awe. &quot;Oh my gosh, I-i&#39;m mom!&quot; you say as you admire your new form, She appeared to be wearing a blue one-piece swimsuit that covered her breasts and vagina from prying eyes, for extra protection she had wrapped and tied a beach towel around her wide hips, she also had a sun hat on to block her made up face from being covered in sun, and to top it off she even had flip flops on. You smiled and your mother smiled back, you bent down and your mother bent down as well exposing some of her cleavage, you grabbed a tit and your mother did as well, &quot;heh this is soo cool!&quot; you say and your mothers voice came out. Suddenly the door bell rung yet again and that startled you so much you find yourself back in your room...and your face collides with the hard wood floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Owww! What? But I was just in...&quot; suddenly the ring began to vibrate and you couldn&#39;t stop yourself from staring until you felt yourself leave your body and into the glowing ring. &quot;Greetings, Jacob Harrison, I am the ring of possessions/body swap&quot; a booming voice said seemingly everywhere &quot;huh? where am I? What do you mean?&quot; you say in confusion as you heard loud chuckling from every direction, &quot;slow down with those questions, boy, I&#39;ll explain now&quot; You seem to relax more than you did before for some reason. &quot;As I said before I am the ring of possessions/body swap, I&#39;ve transported your soul into my domain so I could have a chat with you, and now that I have your complete and utter attention allow me to begin&quot; the booming voice says again and then allowing his words to sink in. &quot;I saw how your life has been over the past few years, I truly am sorry for your father, but there was nothing I could do to save him. but back to present day, I believe you are ready to use my abilities for your own purposes whether that be revenge, lust, knowledge, or power.&quot; You couldn&#39;t believe what you were hearing, could it be possible that he now had the ability to possess/swap bodies with other people? &quot;You can either possess one singular person and leaving your body in a hollow state or swap bodies with someone leaving the other swapped person in your body. You had possessed your mother earlier if you were wondering, but you don&#39;t have to be in the experiment if you want, you can swap two people by saying both of their names or tell one to possess another as you watch from the comfort of your body. Finally, in case you were wondering, I follow where you go so no one but you can use my abilities&quot; you felt in complete awe, you now could be anyone you wanted! <br />
<br />
You were so exited that you didn&#39;t even hear the ring say, &quot;enjoy my abilities Jacob, but be wary who you inform of me, for they may grow jealous of my abilities&quot;. And with that you were now back in your teen body with the ring no longer glowing but still vibrating with power, &quot;awesome, now who to use it on first?&quot;</p>
