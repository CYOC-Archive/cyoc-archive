<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gabriella continued to think about what to do next. So many options, and well she had the rest of the night to enjoy them, not think about them. She was a big WOMAN now not some little girl, she wanted to experience so much. This was way better than having to wait to do the fun stuff. Then something crept her mind. <br />
<br />
“Hmm, Hey Shane?&quot; she turned towards her struggling brother, &quot;We bother wondered what it was like to grow up, right? What&#39;s the harm in joining your &#39;sister&#39;? After all, twins share everything don&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair had always wondered what it feels like to become a grown up. Mainly out of a curiosity of all the stuff adults could do without restrictions. Well, they both new about like police and the law but following those rules seemed easier than what adults expected of kids. No more running to the closet or diving under a bush to hide; they wouldn&#39;t let anyone bully or tell them what not to do. <br />
<br />
Besides, having fun with a sister was more enticing than going off by herself. <br />
<br />
She walked over to the closet and rummaged around. The candy box was covered in a few clothes that had been knocked to the floor in the struggle. Oddly there didn&#39;t seem to be any candies on the floor, which was odd considering both of them had taken handfuls of them and Shane should have dropped a bunch of them during his flight. <br />
<br />
Putting the box to the side she got Shane tied to a small play chair from her tea set. It would have to do for now but she was pretty sure it wasn&#39;t going to last. Carefully she reached into the box and fished around. As if reacting to her, when she pulled her hand out she had two wrapped chocolates of just the flavors she wanted. She unwrapped them before smashing the pair together into a mushy mash in her hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Shane; time to stop whining and  grow up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane shook his head and kept his mouth close. That wasn&#39;t going to stop Gabriella. She stepped on his foot, hard, to force his mouth open. Her brother was prone to shouting when his foot hurt, more so than other kids or even adults. He&#39;d gotten into trouble over shouting curses he wasn&#39;t supposed to know when he banged his foot on something. So it was an easy trick to get him to eat and swallow the chocolate. <br />
<br />
First thing she noticed changing was his height. His legs rippled before stretching out like taffy, quickly over taking the chair and resting in an awkward angle now, with the rest of his body growing to match. He was growing like a weed as he left his childhood behind. His dusty blonde hair grew longer until it was near his lower neck and his face smoothed out, losing the pudgy young child look. <br />
<br />
Puberty started to work it&#39;s magic on him, only not the one that was going to normally happen. His chest rippled as his two nipples grew from pennies to quarters as they begin to get all puffy. With a crack, his hips started to move away from each other, giving him a little more curve than should be expected of a boy. His hands, which had grown to that of a male teenager, became softer and a little more dainty while his finger nails grew. His nose and lips grew bigger while his hair grew past his shoulders while the pigment of the hair color darkened. Any blemishes he would get during his teen years faded away as his skin started to tan and darken.<br />
<br />
The flesh around his pointy nipples grew until they became soft rounded mounds about the size of a baseball, then doubled in size as it surged forward. His height increased some more as his legs grew longer. His larger body made him tumble out of the play chair. His hips expand some more, creating curves around his waist as his ass started to bloat. As his body grew, it was developing some muscle tone as well forming a strong core on his stomach before moving out to his limbs and back.<br />
<br />
His groin pulsed and tighten, his male parts slowly growing smaller and smaller until it inverted, the boy finally turning into a female. His.. well her, face was loosing its teenage awkwardness as she was entering adulthood. Her formerly blue eyes now reflected the same dark eyes of her sister. <br />
<br />
Her breasts started to pulse growing in size with each one. Her hips grew out and creating the bottom of an hourglass figure. Her rear end started to blow up and become rounder. She started trying to move her arms, ripping the weak fabric apart with her stronger dark colored arms.  Nail polish appeared on her growing nails, as its color was a turquoise blue that was marred a bit when she started to use them to rip the long sleeve shirt binding her legs. More make up appeared on her skin as it darkened in color. Light blue lipstick appeared on her lips and light blue eyeliner showed up on her eyelids. Her PJs by this point had torn away, becoming a bra and her panties both in a bright light blue color. <br />
<br />
When Shane? slid into her 20&#39;s, something slammed her mind. Hidden magazines from mom, maybe a few glaces at some of the older women and girls in the locker rooms before images experimentation with other girls floated into her head. Something warm grew in her body, down below. She then instinctively placed her hand on her crouch and slowly rubbed it, licking her lips in reflex. She moaned in pleasure as she felt around her new genitals, and she continued to rub it harder and faster. <br />
<br />
 As she was enjoying her self pleasures, the changes were starting to finalize. All the while as Gabriella sat at the edge of her tiny bed, playing with her self. A fingers at her lower hips while a hand squeezed a breast tightly. She paused for just a minute in her own act to fish out another chocolate. <br />
<br />
Shane&#39;s? breasts grew into a C-cup and were bouncing up and down while her body gyrated against her hand and the floor. Her hips were very wide and her waist had a killer hourglass figure. Her ass was now a large bouncy heart shaped ass that could probably stop traffic. Her arms and legs were shapely and built, making them look equally toned and alluring. All her blemishes were gone, replaced with smooth shiny black skin. Her lips were full, her nose was elegant, and her cheekbones were thin and flat. <br />
<br />
Her dark brown hair grew down to her mid-back, before starting to wrap it&#39;s self around each other, forming into a long series of braids. Her bra shifted again to a tight lace, strapless bra as her panties thickened and shorten to turn into a tight thong. Still keeping the same bright blue color in contrast to her chocolate skin tone. <br />
<br />
She was reaching the end of the transformation. A hand groped her still growing chest while her other one continued to play between her legs. The now young woman took quick breathers and grunted uncaring of who heard her. She couldn’t hold it for much longer. She wanted to cum, she had to cum. Her mouth started to open up as she went to cry out. <br />
<br />
A sweet taste entered her mouth which she reflexively bit into what ever it was and swallowed.<br />
<br />
She could almost hear the &#39;crack&#39; in her soul as her body pulsed again. Her underwear fought to keep what it was containing well.. contained as another wave of growth surged through her body. Her bright blue bra tightened and ripped at the edges as she blew completely past past D cup and right into F cup. Her hips and butt became EXTRA THICK and bouncy as her height increased along with her muscle mass to carry everything. Not to mention a few more inches all around. <br />
<br />
She lay there, panting in the after glow... but still hadn&#39;t cum. The Transformation had overridden her own building arousal. She grumbled as she tried to get up only to see a hand outstretched. She took it and stood, looking at her twin who mirrored her in every way. Tall, large built body, and plenty of meat in all the right places. Only her hair was shorter, and her underwear was different. <br />
<br />
&quot;What took you so long?&quot; she asked in a sultry voice, as her arms draped over her twin&#39;s neck. &quot;I was waiting for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;MMMM, sorry, just... growing pains.&quot; she responded as her own hands went behind her twin&#39;s back and groped her large ass, &quot;Come gimme some sugah.&quot; <br />
<br />
Their lips locked as they moaned into each other&#39;s mouths, their hands groping wherever they could reach as their tongues fought for control. Their thighs pushing inward to gently caress the other woman&#39;s privates. Gabriella, or at least the woman that had been Gabriella, had fed herself and her &#39;sister&#39; another pair of  strawberry and dark chocolates. While the Dark part of it couldn&#39;t do much more than a few body buffs here and there, the Strawberry had a more noticeable effect. <br />
<br />
Thoughts of family bonds or sinful feelings evaporated as the sweet taste spread throughout their bodies and minds. Both were now porn star experts of sapphic love to anyone that looked good enough in their eyes, and who could be better than someone you&#39;d spent every waking moment with already and looked just like you. <br />
<br />
The twin flavors of chocolates lead them to being to being big black butches with a taste for deep chocolate themselves, regardless of where it came from. They weren&#39;t just sisters or twins, but partners, lovers, and sinful soulmates; each one knowing JUST how to get the other off.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Shanique, what do you wanna do tonight?&quot; she asked her new lover as she finally broke the kiss for air, the two resting their foreheads against each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides you, all night, Gabbi?&quot; her large hands swatted her lover&#39;s ass, &quot;I dunno. I&#39;m up for anything tonight.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Anything eh?&quot; a grin widened on Gabbi&#39;s face.</p>
