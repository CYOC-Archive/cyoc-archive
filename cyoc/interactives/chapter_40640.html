<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danielle and her mom went up to what had been Kat's room. As Dan she hadn't been allowed in here but now she was. She took this opportunity to really looked around. The walls were painted a pastel purple color with pictures of Kat and her friends hanging on them, the carpet was a very light tan, there was an old fashioned oak wardrobe, an oak computer desk with what looked to be the latest computer on it, an oak nightstand with an antique looking lamp on it, an oak bed with bedding the same pastel purple color as the walls, an oak make-up table with a large mirror on it, and there was one of those hair dryer stands for the hand held hair dryers next to the make-up table.<br />
<br />
Danielle's mom was looking around too and said &quot;Well it seems like Kat was busy in here before you came home from school.&quot; She shook her head and continued &quot;I don't know why she couldn't be happy with what we had bought for her. I hope she also remembered to reinforce the floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh Mom&quot; Danielle said. &quot;What are we going to do about my friends and school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don't worry about that&quot; her mom said waving her hand like it was no big deal. &quot;It's taken care of. Everyone outside of our family now knows you as Danielle. Would you like me to add memories of your life as Danielle to your memories?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think that would be ok&quot; Danielle said hesitating just a little bit.<br />
<br />
Her mom pointed her wand at Danielle and said a few words. New memories suddenly flooded into her mind. Her new memories had her growing as an only child. She recalled how nervous she was on her first day of school, her first sleepover party, the fear she felt when she had found blood in her panties, her sixteenth birthday party where she had her first kiss, and many more. She stumbled a bit and almost fell but her mom caught her. She looked at the pictures on the walls again and saw that they were now pictures of her and her friends. Also the walls had changed color to a pastel yellow along with the bedding.<br />
<br />
Danielle saw her mom at the wardrobe selecting a dress for her. She turned around and said &quot;Since it's a fancy restaurant you'll need to wear one of your best dresses. This blue strapless dress should do. Oh I suppose I should change Kat too match.&quot; Another spell and Kat had changed from plain white cotton panties to blue low cut silk panties. Kat's face was still stitched into the front. &quot;Go take a shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle went into the bathroom that she and Kat had shared between their rooms. She smiled as she took off her bra and then Kat. Holding her up she said &quot;I don't know if you can see or hear me. If you can then you should know that I'm thinking about extending your time as my panties. I'm not stupid you know. If I have Mom change you back tomorrow you'll just use your magic to make me pay for this. I may have to wait until I'm eighteen so I have a chance to defend myself. I know that means that I'll have to remain as a girl but I think I'll like being a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed and carefully put Kat where she could see her if she could still see. She turned the shower on and stepped in as soon as it was hot enough for her. The feel of the spray on her breasts was different than what she was used to. She noticed that her nipples were getting hard and poking out. She experimentally rubbed her breasts and a wave of pleasure coursed through her. She did have memories of doing this before but the memory of the feelings weren't as clear. One hand drifted down to her pussy and began rubbing. The pleasure she felt was more intense than playing with her breasts had been. She began to rub faster and harder. She inserted a couple of fingers in and out and she moaned in pleasure. She spent the next twenty minutes pleasuring herself. As the minutes ticked by the pleasure she felt built upon itself until finally, she shuddered in orgasm. Her whole body tensed as she let out a loud moan.<br />
<br />
After her orgasm Danielle braced herself against one wall with her hand and panted while the water cascaded down her head and back. &quot;Damn!&quot; she said once she had gotten her breath back enough for her to talk. &quot;I never realized... girls had such... powerful orgasms. I don't want to... go back to being... a boy... ever again.&quot; She stood back up and put some lilac scented body wash on a pouf. She soon discovered that this simple act was sending waves of pleasure throughout her body again. Once again her hand slid down to her pussy and began to rub it. Her orgasm came faster this time but no less powerful. &quot;No wonder... Kat spent... so much time... in the shower&quot; she said panting.<br />
<br />
Catching her breath Danielle washed the soap off and picked up a bottle of lilac scented shampoo and conditioner. After washing her hair she turned off the water and stepped out. She looked at Kat and smiled wondering again if she was aware. She would have to ask her mom about that. She proceeded to wrap her hair in a towel and another one around her. She picked Kat up and went back into her room.<br />
<br />
Once she was back in her room and went to the make-up table. She took her hair dryer out of one of the drawers and put it in the stand. After plugging it in and turning it on she removed the towel. She picked up a hair brush and started brushing her hair while drying it. It didn't take long until it was dry and she shut off the hair dryer.<br />
<br />
By the time her hair was dry the rest of her was dry as well. She unwrapped the towel from around herself and put Kat back on. She liked how Kat felt sliding up her smooth legs. The fabric Kat was made out of now was so much better and smoother than the cotton she was. She liked the way Kat felt against her flat groin and again thought that she didn't ever want to return to being a boy. She went to her dresser picking out a pair of knee high stockings and then pt them on. She picked up the dress that her mom had picked out and put it on. She knew that she would need some help with the zipper so she opened her door a bit and yelled &quot;Mom! I need you to zip me up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm coming!&quot; her mom yelled back.<br />
<br />
It wasn't long before her mom was in the room and zipping her up. Danielle decided to ask about Kat while she had her mom here. &quot;Mom&quot; she began. Taking a deep breath she asked &quot;Is Kat aware of what happens?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course she's aware&quot; her mom said. &quot;It wouldn't be much of a punishment if she wasn't. Why do you ask? Were you teasing her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well a little bit I guess&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess you're entitled to rub it in a bit&quot; her mom said with a giggle. &quot;You do know that she's planning how to get back at you. The only way you'll be safe is if you stay a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already thought about that&quot; Danielle said sitting down at the make-up table. &quot;I want to stay a girl now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; her mom said with a smile on her face. &quot;I would advise you to wait until you're eighteen to have her transformed back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking that&quot; Danielle said with a smile of her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; her mom said nodding. &quot;I'll have at least one daughter who won't abuse her powers. Now finish getting ready and come downstairs. We'll be leaving in about an hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom&quot; Danielle said as she picked up some blush. She applied it as her mom left. Next she put on some eye shadow and mascara. Next she applied some lipstick. Finally she decided to paint her nails. She did a white base coat, a blue coat, and finally a clear top coat with silver sparkles in it. After each coat she dried them in a dryer designed to dry fingernail polish.<br />
<br />
By the time she was done it was almost time to go. She put on a pair of blue high heels, grabbed her purse, and went downstairs. To her surprise her mom and dad were sitting in the living room. &quot;Well it's nice to finally see that you're ready&quot; her dad said with a slight smile. &quot;You were ready much earlier before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle smiled and said &quot;Well I am a girl now. It takes me a little longer to get ready. Just be glad I didn't need to shave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her dad laughed and said &quot;I know that girls take longer to get ready. At least those that don't have any magic. Well it looks like we're ready s let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle's parents got up and they left the house.</p>
