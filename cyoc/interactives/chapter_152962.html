<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ava&#39;s morning was fairly calm and it so far seemed like the day would be a bit quieter than the first day. At least she didn&#39;t hear any rumors about a fight going on in the morning. She hoped that that fight was merely just venting some frustration and surprise at this reveal that Moon Lake was likely nervous over and that things would quiet down, though Ava also knew that some of that would really be something that couldn&#39;t be controlled. If this debate had only happened just before the Ross family came to Moon Lake, it would be unlikely that the city would have a full plan ready or full information on what the effect would be at the present time. All of that would be something that everyone would just have to wait and see on.<br />
<br />
The thing that was most on Ava&#39;s mind was the discussion from breakfast, that she&#39;d have to wait until she was eighteen before she could go through with any decision on being a were. Some of that didn&#39;t seem fair to her, as she had met some weres that were her age and had joined were society, though a couple commented that their induction might have been due to being drugged by some aphrodisiac over the Halloween Dance, but there were plenty that had said that they had joined willingly and one blond haired weremer she met said she&#39;d turned her &quot;one true love&quot; willingly because of their being in love. That left her tapping her pencil as she sat through her first class, doing her best to pay attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still worried on your brother?&quot; came a whisper from Ashley when her first period class ended.<br />
<br />
Ava looked over to see her new friend approach. Ava noticed that the werecat had a warm but concerned smile, which probably came back to the things the two of them had discussed the previous day, largely in relation to what Ava had overheard and thus built on her worries for her brother. However, the thing she was dwelling on for the moment was more on rules and approval that would come down on her over things she wanted to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Ava answered quietly as they fell toward the rear of the line of students heading out, &quot;I think that is settling out... there are some concerns... but right now, I&#39;ve gotten some assurances that I can let it play out as it were. The thing that is going on right now is in relation to some things I want...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Ashley wondered, &quot;Which is...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I know I&#39;m not gay or bi, but given the guide&#39;s drawing for a weremountainlion and what you and your dad described his fursona as like a large Abyssinian, I&#39;d felt that might be a good option,&quot; Ava answered, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be as oversized as a werelion or weretiger. I wouldn&#39;t have the markings that really differ from a House Cat that a wereleopard would have. So that was a good idea to go with...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley nodded, as Ava had mentioned something along those lines the previous day.<br />
<br />
&quot;But because of the sexual nature that comes along with being a were and becoming one,&quot; Ava continued, &quot;My dad I&#39;d have to wait until I&#39;m eighteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... the unwritten rules that parents have,&quot; Ashley gave a small chuckle. &quot;That&#39;s going to be pretty universal, even in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;ve talked with a few people that are my age and became weres or are my age and turned a normal human,&quot; Ava commented, &quot;so... that has to be... okay... here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s really hard to be keen on,&quot; Ashley said slowly, &quot;by law, even among weres, it is illegal for someone over 18 to be with someone under 18. Now, sometimes there are instances where it happens and to a degree... it&#39;s often overlooked because of how high were libido runs, but that doesn&#39;t change the law.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But then why all the references to weres turning others at younger ages and others saying they joined were society at younger ages?&quot; Ava wondered as they now entered a hallway and headed for a flight of stairs to head up to their second period classes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those cases have generally been with people of the same age and thus technically skirts the issue and Moon Lake on the whole has tended to &quot;look the other way&quot; with it,&quot; Ashley answered, &quot;things like safe sex are taught and females taking their birth control pills is stressed... but Moon Lake doesn&#39;t get too deep into the issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Ava said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;There have been cases where statutory rape charges have been filed... rare, but they have happened,&quot; Ashley said slowly, &quot;and that might also be part of the reason why Moon Lake is nervous on the reveal issue. Things have gone reasonably well as they are and a fair number wouldn&#39;t want to se a push back that sees the laws tightened or the enforcement of the laws tightened. Particularly as many normal families that come to Moon Lake often bring their beliefs with them. Just because Moon Lake is different doesn&#39;t mean that your folks will change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Ava said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And besides, it not as though your dad will bill the only parent with unwritten rules that can be a bit... chaffing, as it were,&quot; Ashley answered, &quot;because I&#39;m a werecat... I lack a lot of the size and muscle that other weres have. I may be stronger than a human, but its not by that much and given some of the rivalry that weres have with mundane animals... my mom and dad both worry about me going out at night and running into a deer. If its a buck and its antlers are free of velvet... it may well attack and I might not be able to fight it off. That sort of thing. Not to mention that because our house is on Main Street and runs right through town, there&#39;s also the fear of being spotted by someone from outside of Moon Lake. So every parent has their rules even if we don&#39;t always like them. Can&#39;t say much more on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but thanks for the help and understanding,&quot; Ava commented.<br />
<br />
Ashley nodded as the two reached the point where they&#39;d have to part ways for the day, &quot;Yeah... and remember, given how long a were&#39;s lifespan can be... four years isn&#39;t much to worry about.&quot;</p>
