<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul lived in a remarkably upscale place - supposedly his parents were stacked. His dad had a job at a computer company, and his mom was a model even in her early forties. Thus, the place that Paul called home was a tremendous three or four story place covering a pretty astonishing amount of land. There was a pool off to the right side, which saw quite a bit of use in pool parties (so long as Paul always cleaned up after himself), and the left side was a garage where Paul&#39;s dad Dylan kept his share of midlife crisis cars. The man&#39;s interests in them were fairly transparent.<br />
<br />
In comparison to the rather shabby upbringing that Jeff had, it always astonished him a bit when he came by Paul&#39;s place. The Gilliams had quite a charmed life. As Paul drove his car up to his home, parking, he looked over at Jeff, noting he&#39;d been pretty quiet the way home. He had guessed he was listening to his music or something, usually the two could chat about babes or something. But no. This time, Jeff was just quiet.<br />
<br />
The larger of the two got out and then walked around and opened the door, &quot;Is...something up, bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, just...felt kinda weird on my way to your place, man. Could I borrow a bed for the night? Kinda feeling funny tonight. Maybe I had some bad food at the fair.&quot; Jeff responded, getting up and out. He&#39;d need to get a look at himself. His clothes were feeling pretty tight right now. And the feeling he was getting was not entirely bad per se. Just unusual and kind of alien - enough that Jeff hoped that the sensations playing havoc on him ended soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, man. We got lots of beds open, and you&#39;re always welcome to stay over for the night.&quot; When Paul clapped Jeff&#39;s shoulder, he noted his friend shivered for a moment before clapping him back on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
As they headed in, Paul looked at a note on a dresser by the door as he closed the doors behind them. Seemed like mom and dad were going to be out for the night. Dad had some expo he had to prepare for, and Mom had a modeling shoot she was going to. Paul shrugged and figured that this just meant he had a whole night with his best friend on the football team. He thought he heard Jeff heading upstairs into the first bathroom up there...<br />
<br />
Hm. He hoped that nothing was too terribly wrong with Jeff. Paul was himself staring to feel like he had an odd tingle to him - though more in the sense of needing a good workout. Sometimes he got these feelings when he hadn&#39;t worked out lately. Rest days were necessary, but man did they ever suck.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Upstairs, Jeff looked at his reflection in the mirror, shivering again - this time in odd joy. Was...was this a result of his wish?<br />
<br />
Jeff looked into the mirror, seeing the reflection of his muscles, grown somewhat larger and more well toned. He hoped it wouldn&#39;t impact his speed all that much. He didn&#39;t need much more scolding from coach. His slightly short, buzz cut trimmed auburn hair though seemed slightly longer than usual and oddly softer in feeling. Huh. Jeff started flexing his arms, enjoying how the peaks pushed up with greater intensity than they usually did.<br />
<br />
He bounced his pecs a few times and tensed his core, seeing his six pack in greater clarity and with better obliques complimenting it than ever before. Jeff felt like he was a sexual dynamo. He&#39;d be a sure fire hit with the ladies here at this rate. Everyone knew the more buff guys got the most action here. And Jeff was increasingly looking like one aesthetic motherfucker. As he felt at his pecs, Jeff tensed them and noted the granite like consistency. Oh, he felt incredible like this...!<br />
<br />
And then his finger brushed over his nipple.<br />
<br />
It was like igniting a fire inside of Jeff. He gasped and groaned, hoping that Paul did not hear that. He felt his muscles tense and an electric shock sensation traveled down his spine, his back flexing in response. He even felt his ass, now in more of a muscular bubble butt look, clench a bit, making Jeff choke down a moan. He didn&#39;t want anyone to know he was a moaner when it came to sex...!<br />
<br />
But the sheer sensation was absolutely undeniable. He couldn&#39;t really help himself with that in mind. Jeff was in general eager to follow whatever felt good, but now he was definitely inclined to enjoy this. Jeff started pinching his nipple between his thumb and forefinger, breathing harshly as he felt his manhood erect to full strength. Fuck but this felt good. It was like nothing he had ever experienced before. Jeff needed...more!<br />
<br />
He pinched his nipple tightly and rolled it in his fingers. And then gripped his cock underneath his pants, roughly jerking off and, before long, pulling his pants down so he had better access. Jeff shook on his feet, almost feeling like a kick of his leg was coming even though he was standing. Jeff gasped, &quot;Fuck, I-I think I&#39;m gonna cum all over myself...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff gasped and fulfilled that thought not a moment later when he pinched his nipple particularly tight. His emission almost knocked him out, and for roughly five minutes, Jeff just stood there letting his tool drain out everything it was gonna shot during that orgasm. He was honestly amazed by his volume by the time he came back to, and looked down to see a mess on the side of the sink. Jeff grinned a little despite himself.<br />
<br />
He detected that his manhood was slightly smaller than usual, but it seemed thicker as far as his estimation. So he deemed it a worthy trade off for now. Fuck, so he&#39;d grown bigger muscles now, and on top of all of that, his body was more sensitive and sexually charged? Talk about a win. Jeff cleaned up his mess before long and started thinking of what to do for now. He could see about trying to find Paul, or he could...mm, try for that again. Or text some of the other guys from school. For some reason he felt more inclined to chat a bit with the other guys from the soccer team.</p>
