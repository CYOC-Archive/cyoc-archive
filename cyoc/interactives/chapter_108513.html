<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The wolf officer had just written down the newest uplifted animal as well as his current location when the radio crackled to life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dispatch, this is Sky-Eye 12 reporting a mass Animalia virus outbreak.&quot; The wolf jumped slightly. He knew the Sky-Eye units. They were uplifted hawks and eagles whose job it was was to function in a similar way to helicopter units, but their job was also to locate wild animals affected and/or uplifted by the Animalia virus and pinpoint their location. It was also found out that their eyes had something similar to a built-in zoom function. A similar role for night watch was found for owls. But at the mention of an outbreak, not to mention a mass outbreak, of the Animalia virus, the wolf immediately routed the call to the dispatch offices of both the Lyre Police Department and their own office as well as the government office that was studying the virus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sky-Eye 12, name location of outbreak.&quot; Said the officer wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lyre Zoo.&quot; Answered Sky-Eye 12. The wolf officer heard the officer at the LPD swear slightly, as well as the contacted government official. Lyre Zoo wasn&#39;t a really big zoo, but it had a decent amount of animals from around the world. It also had an exhibit that was a combination of an aquarium and a very small Sea World, as advertising described it. It&#39;s main attraction was a show featuring a pair of killer whales.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Fortunately the virus had only spread to the reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals, and it was easily contained and purged. During the &quot;cleanup&quot; of the virus outbreak, new things were discovered about the virus:<br />
1. When megafauna, such as elephants and rhinoceroses are uplifted, their heights max out at nine feet tall. The only ones that were taller were the uplifted giraffes, who topped out at eleven feet tall.<br />
2. Animals with disproportionate body proportions, such as giraffes are often &quot;evened out&quot;; with shorter, more flexible necks, shorter limbs (in order to retain humanoid proportions), and longer torsos. They all still have well muscled bodies, with females having enough feminine muscle not to subtract from their new femininity.<br />
3. Uplifted animals from a certain region, such as Africa, are capable of speaking English, but it is often accompanied by a certain accent, and a certain language. For example, animals from Africa would instinctively know the Swahili language, and develop Swahilian accents, while those from around the area of China instinctively learn Mandarin Chinese, and develop Chinese accents.<br />
4. Uplifted animals with large, swollen midsections, such as pandas and hippos develop smaller, yet still muscular midsections in males, while females obtain feminine slimness with only a slightly protruding, yet still muscular tummy.<br />
5. Uplifted aquatic mammals without lower limbs, such as the dolphins and the two orcas, often develop well-muscled legs with 4-toed, webbed feet, but do not automatically know how to walk upright. They also retain their tails, rearranged to be on top of their new humanoid buttocks. There is also a kind of sexual dimorphism in them. Males would have their dorsal fins in the middle of their upper backs, while females would have their dorsal fins on the back of their heads, a few inches behind their blowholes, and both genders retain their blowholes, which relocate slightly to the apexes of their new skulls. They also develop the usual well-muscled arms with five-fingered hands, but these were also webbed, with smaller dorsal fins remaining on their forearms. The orcas had also developed sharp claws on their fingers and toes.<br />
6. Primates, such as gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees, were the least changed on the outside. They still had gained humanoid intellects, but the physical changes were minor, at best. They had gained the ability to remain on two legs for most of their lives, like humans, but resembled characters from the modern remake of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. Monkeys, such as gibbons and spider monkeys, would retain the prehensile feet and tails, but they gained the ability to walk on their hind legs much like humans.<br />
<br />

<br />
There was also the discovery, during the Lyre and Lyre Zoo outbreaks, there were those who wanted to join Animalia, either to join with their newly transformed pets (in the Lyre outbreak), or for various personal reasons. The government decided to bring these new policies into effect:<br />
<br />
1. No change shall be forced onto another person. All transformations and &quot;double-dosings&quot; must be taken upon the person of their own free will.<br />
2. A 24-page form must be filled out, stating that the transformee must be capable of sustaining themselves financially, including new clothing, new health and grooming products, etc.. Children under the age of 18 must have their parents or guardians sign the form that they have given their consent for their child or children to be transformed. A separate, 26-page form must be filled out for double dosing, with similar conditions on it.<br />
3. After a transformation and/or a double dosing, identification paperwork must be filed with the &quot;town hall&quot; of Animalia. This must include species, chronological age, species that exposed them to the Animalia virus (for humans), etc. and must have both the transformer&#39;s signature (usually a thumbprint until they learn to write), the transformee&#39;s signature, the signatures of the parents or guardians, as well as the signature of a witness from Animalia.<br />
4. Also after a transformation and/or double dosing, the transformee, whether animal or human must undergo a complete physical examination, both to determine any health problems that might have been in place before or will result from the transformation, and determine the physical, mental, and sensory abilities of the transformee.<br />
5. Any transformee not out of high school must complete their education, and must use the same precautions against spreading the virus and not worsening the relations between humans and Animalia that Abby Brown is subject to.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Mr. And Mrs. Wesley were the first ones that the government studied in &quot;willing administering of the Animalia virus&quot;. As it turned out Mr. Wesley, was not only somewhat okay with his daughters&#39; condition, he had a buried furry fetish that he had not indulged in since high school. Both of them exposed themselves to the virus by the milk of their daughters, as well as double dosing. During the mandatory physical, it was determined that the moderate heart defect suffered by Mr. Wesley had been completely cured.  After they were completely finished with their change and double dosing, Mr. and Mrs. Wesley were an inch taller than their daughters and had bigger musculatures (having been restored to their prime) than their daughters.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Lyre Zoo was not far from the Brown Farm, and it was an easy task to merge both properties into a single new town district. However, unlike the city in &quot;Zootopia, the buildings were a lot smaller, and there were no high rise apartments or skyscrapers. The only modern looking building was the &quot;Great Hall&quot;, which functioned as both a town hall, a performing arts center, a YMCA, and a research laboratory (for government officials only), while the houses and apartment complexes were similar to the &quot;log cabin&quot; style that was already present.<br />
<br />
One of the things that the government finished during the study was a way to neutralize the virus in uplifted animals, and, at the request of the Belgian Blue cows on the Brown Farm, in the milk of those uplifted animals. It was also determined that eating the unfertilized eggs of the uplifted chickens didn&#39;t count for the &quot;no eating changed kin&quot; rule. It was also determined that a new medicine would be developed to help uplifted animals, especially those who were once humans and were still in high school when they double dosed themselves, with heat and rut, and act as a contraceptive, as long as it is taken throughout their school careers.</p>
