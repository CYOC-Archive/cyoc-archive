<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim parked his car in the garage of his parents old home. Three years ago they gave him the house when the cold of winter brought a decission to retire in Southern California.<br />
<br />
Tossing his coat in a chair he sat down to what he was told a new game program. Unable to type on the keyboard he pecked away as the program came alive. The screen welcomed his opening and as with Ben the strange shocking feeling held his fingers to the keys.<br />
<br />
As Jim read the game material and rules the delight of what he had expected drained away. The more he read the more the program sounded perverted. A long standing religious person he held to strick rules to his lifestyle. Computer games was his prime outlet for agressive behavior.<br />
<br />
Remebering the input he had placed on Ben's screen he decided to call Ben and chide him as to this program.  The phone rang and rang till a lady's voice said &quot;Hello!&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Johnson told Jim that Ben was not at home and about the beast he was keeping in the apartment. Jim listened and thought of the input he had placed into the laptop of Ben's. All the while he looked at the screen in front of him building a long line of suggested changes.<br />
<br />
Hanging up after twenty minutes of the old woman nagging about his friend Jim turned to his computer. Thinking about what he was told and still not believing the story he had to try something himself.<br />
<br />
As before he X'ed in body parts to be changed. Seeing the Special Changes he added more direction to the program's silly questions.<br />
Then when asked for a reply to Genius he could not come up with and answer. Angry he could not put the program on hold while he checked the internet for a possible answer.<br />
<br />
Finally he typed in a remark of &quot;dumb ass question!&quot;<br />
<br />
The screen flickered and then went on to suggest how long before starting and if the changes should become permanent.<br />
<br />
Enter, enter, he double clicked.<br />
<br />
Getting up he thought to go use the jon and left the computer to whirl in flickering and constantly changing screens.<br />
<br />
Taking only three steps brought Jim to his knees ans a blinding pain made him close his eyes and clench his teeth. The pain was as a knife cutting into his skull. As it moved deep into his brain the feeling spread right, left, up, and down into his head.<br />
<br />
Having only checked a few options on the body changes he had left open many spaces. The pain drained from him as if somebody had poured a bucket of cold water on his head.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the floor he opened his eyes and blinked a dozen times. The view seemed to wide and yet he could not look directly in front of his face. He now had a strange blind spot which he could not strain his eyes to view. The now loud sounds coming from the whirling program running on his computer turned his attention to a machine gone wild.<br />
<br />
Rolling over he pushed himself to a standing position. As he got closer to the computer desk the blind spot became more troublesome.<br />
Cocking his head to one side he was able to look at the screen. Odd he thought, &quot;as I look with my right eye to see the screen the left eye still looks out into the room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reaching to poke at the buttons Jim was horrorified to see a dark brown hairy limb ended in a solid one toe hoof come into view. Now he was really thinking strange thoughts. Jumping up he ran for the bathroom and the full length mirror. <br />
<br />
Peeling clothes off as he went, Jim entered the bathroom clicked on the light and gasp! Looking back at him was a very strange form indeed. His head was not human, if fact it was covered in dark cocoa brown shaggy fur and looked the head of a Donkey or Ass. <br />
<br />
The muzzle was a mealy sandy brown with long feeler hair jutting out in all directions. As he tried to mouth some words the rubber black lips offered on aide in forming any speach.<br />
<br />
Jim's dark large eyes spread far apart now made it plain why he could not see directly in front of his nose. The furry dark hairs spread down a thicker and long neck than one he has an hour ago. His shoulders although covered in fur were to be normal human composition. Yet too his arms were most definatly fore legs and hooves of some beast.  <br />
<br />
The cocoa dark fur covered his chest, back, belly, butt, thighs, and LEGS! Legs yes but the sight almost stopped his heart. Hind legs, hind feet of some breed on horse. His thighs were broad and he stood hunched over. He looked out proportion as his body was human in size but his hind quarters were larger and beastial.<br />
<br />
The changing and stirring of his form made a sensual feeling that like with all equine's show's it's head coming out of a sheath. As he stood wavering about trying to keep some balance the sight of a growing horse's cock pushed out into the light.<br />
<br />
Wide eyed he watched the flat ended member move like a great snake out of a black hole. Arching at first the bloating cock first push itself out to a massive size and length. Slowly as the sensual feel increased so did the stiffening. In a minute or two the jet black shaft strained out straight. The dark veins pulsing and his very large testicles churning.<br />
<br />
Suddeenly for some reason his body started a pelvic thrusting action.<br />
This only heightened the stress and then the wild desire to release his seed. The cock looked like a clog coming down it's length and with a few drips of milkiy cum a load of thick chunky semen shot out and clinging splattered the mirror.<br />
<br />
As his pelvic thrusts continued so did the spewing of the semen till it ran down the mirror. Finally stopping Jim stood in awe of his actions.</p>
