<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“We need some food, heading toward up town!” yelled a female voice as Taylor stood under a dockside shower washing away some of the salt from the ocean which she had just went swimming in. <br />
<br />
“Alright, can you pick up some more lemonade mix we are out?” yelled Taylor as she poked her head out of the shower.<br />
<br />
“Not a problem!” yelled the female voice back as Taylor went back to her shower, washing away the salt. She looked up toward the upper deck to see her boyfriend Sam watching her shower with a huge smile on his face. She smiled back as she began to put on a show, slowly running her hands over her C cup breasts contained in a small yellow bikini top and down her narrow sides. She did a few bends lifting her legs into positions she would never use in a shower but some she had used often in the bedroom and on the gymnastic mat before that. She could see him looking down at her with those dark eyes and darker hair and she knew his manhood was at full attention. She loved to play games with him, even if he was a little bit of a stick in the mud sometimes.<br />
<br />
Still she couldn’t stay in the water forever, and wrapping a towel around her waist and ringing the water out of her long blonde hair she headed up toward the upper deck. The beach house was separated into two decks and upper deck which sat 8 feet off the water but had a large outdoor cooking area and patio area. The second deck was smaller and narrower sat at beach leave was mostly used to dock the small fishing boat the other boys had taken out but it had a shower to wash off sand and salt which is what she was using now. <br />
She walked up the stairs stopping for a moment as she winced a bit, she pulled out a stupid shell she had stepped on and tossed it back into the water. Not really taking note of it nor the head of the figure which was floating under the dock behind her.<br />
<br />
“Enjoying the show?” laughed Taylor as she kissed her boyfriend on the cheek. Sam was a very fit man, a strong man, with broad shoulders and if he didn’t have a six pack it was close enough. His skin was very fair which required a lot of sun tans and he couldn’t tan to save his life. He was perfect in almost every way, the only thing Taylor would change was that he was currently trying to grow a beard and it was failing badly and he had a short male pony tail like some character in a show he likes had. Those where cosmic issues and she could complain but in the end it didn’t matter in the long run. He was more straight lace then she was but he did enjoy her games and he helped keep her in check.<br />
<br />
“You know I was.” He answered as he kissed her neck, earning a moan from her. She looked around and spotted that they were alone. <br />
<br />
“Where is everyone?” inquired Taylor<br />
<br />
“Two of them headed to the shop to get some food. Another is inside watching a show, the guys are out on the boat somewhere and Rose and Nate are well you know.” Answered Sam as Taylor nodded, Rose was Taylor’s best friend and Sam was Nate’s so they gone a few double dates together during their time in college the four of them where best friends. They had even joked considered a double wedding when the time came and once another one of their friends almost convinced the four of them (all of whom where drunk) to have a 4 way while they watched. “I am just hear making sure, this great piece of meat is cooked to perfection for tonight.”<br />
<br />
The meat did smell great, and Sam had been slow cooking it for hours and it would be a few more hours before it would be ready.<br />
<br />
“So we are alone?” inquired Taylor in a playful mood.<br />
<br />
“For the most part.” Said Sam as he took a step only to wince in pain.<br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Taylor as Sam lifted his foot up and pulled a shell which he had stepped on. “That just happened to me.”<br />
<br />
“Must have been sitting in the gap between boards.” offered Sam as he looked at the gap between the deck boards, he thought he saw something under the deck. But it moved away and it seamed to be some kind of giant fish.<br />
<br />
“Is something wrong?” inquired Taylor<br />
<br />
“No, thought I saw something.” Explained Sam as he moved to give her a kiss, which quickly turned into a make out season. Taylor was about to pull off his black T-shirt when a voice filled the air.<br />
<br />
“Sam!, Taylor!” yelled Nate’s voice coming from the beach area.<br />
<br />
“Damn that load mouth is back.” Complained Sam as they broke off the kiss and looked over the edge. Nate was a little bit off shore in the water, Rose was with him but something seamed odd. <br />
<br />
“What is it?” yelled Sam <br />
<br />
“Come to the beach!” yelled Rose back as Taylor shrugged and headed toward the beach followed by Sam. They reached the water’s edge and looked out. <br />
<br />
“Did you do something with your hair?” inquired Taylor as she looked at the now much brighter red hair of her best friend. <br />
<br />
“You could say that.” Said Rose as she dove under the water as a red tail appeared above water for a second. Nate did the same, only with an orange and gold tail, within seconds they where semi out of the water and they could see the massive changes which had happened to their friends. They had become merpeople. <br />
<br />
“What happened?” inquired Taylor in stunned horror as Sam’s eyes widened.<br />
<br />
“The same thing which is happening to you.” Added a new voice as a third mermaid appeared only this one was holding what looked to be a blow gun but with a dart like shell. A shell they had both seen before and had pulled out of their feet, they both looked down to see scales already forming on their feet. <br />
<br />
“We just had to share this gift with you.” Said Rose with happiness in her voice as her best friend looked down in horror as she began to change.</p>
