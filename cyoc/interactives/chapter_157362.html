<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cole quickly fell back into his usual, work routine. Maintaining a business as usual appearance as much as possible without having a young man in a wheelchair to keep his attention on.<br />
<br />
As strange as it was going spending his days at the office without a physical person to watch over, Cole found himself enjoying the situation. His mind was busy processing the potential breakthroughs the dicking technology could have for his work. As it would be very hard for someone to know if your dick was really your dick or another person, unless they had seen it before.<br />
<br />
He grinned, quite thankful that he had not been so quick to post his workout progress online like many of his colleagues did. A leaked dick pic or visible penis line in a social media post could potentially be the end of a career now. Although not quite for the reasons most would suspect.<br />
<br />
While Cole was enjoying the change of pace in his work, Nico felt like he was in hell.<br />
The bulletproof shell fit him snugly, and had warmed up to body temperature rapidly, but it kept him in a fixed position. He could try to get hard, as he was a shower, but the shell kept him tucked down and curved, causing any attempts to get hard to become quite uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Worse, Nico was in the cage almost 24/7, only being taken out to shower daily. No other breaks, even when Cole needed to piss. Cole had taken to using a stall so no-one would see the cage by accident at a urinal, and had kept Nico silent the entire time.<br />
<br />
For Nico, he felt bored and trapped, just like when he was stuck in the wheelchair, but now he couldn’t even watch TV or read a book. His life had been reduced to sitting around waiting for the only stimulation he would get. Cole’s daily shower.<br />
<br />
Even then Nico wasn’t able to get any relief. Cole talking to Nico but keeping him muted, explained that masturbating Nico had been crossing a line, so instead Cole used ice daily to cause Nico to soften after his shower, before he promptly returned him to his cage.<br />
Nico felt like he was losing his mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nico had been locked up for ten days when Cole was called into Gerald’s office to give him an update on his son.  Cole giving a factual and detailed account of the security steps he had taken. His face showing no emotion when Gerald told him to drop his pant’s so he could see the cage.<br />
<br />
“Very functional Cole, good work! Now let me talk to my son.”<br />
<br />
“Very well sir.” Cole replied, unlocking the cage and allowing Nico out during the day for the first time in a long time. <br />
<br />
Nico was disorientated, having adjusted to long days without freedom, the cage muffling noises so he only had a vague idea what was going on. He wanted to jump for joy, his fleshy body filling with blood rapidly as he realized his father was talking to him.<br />
<br />
“Dad! Turn me back. I can’t stand this anymore. It’s worse then being stuck in the chair!”<br />
<br />
“Whoah, whaoh, calm down son! I’m sure you are over reacting. Take a moment, then tell me what’s wrong.”<br />
<br />
Nico throbbed a few times slowly, his body flexing as if he was taking several large breaths, before relaying to his father his time spent in locked up isolation, being muted the entire time, and not getting any free time to enjoy himself.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Cole had a justification for each and every one of Nico’s complaints, leaving Gerald conflicted. He personally loved being a dick, capable of multiple ejaculations and the accompanying mind bending pleasure, but he also loved his son and didn’t want to force him to stay this way.<br />
<br />
Gerald told Nico he would spend some time thinking about what to do but that nothing would change for at least another day, but that Cole would have to continue on as normal until he made a decision.<br />
<br />
Cole muted Nico’s mid plea before sliding the angrily flexing Nico back inside the uncomfortable black cage. Using the discomfort of trying to bend while hard to force Nico to soften. Taking  15 minutes to what would normally be 5 minutes with ice.<br />
<br />
Gerald, having seen the seen, cancel led his afternoon meetings before calling Richard for advice.<br />
An hour later Gerald ended the call and started putting together a new contract.<br />
<br />
The next morning Cole released Nico in Gerald’s office again, where Gerald revealed his plan.<br />
<br />
“Son, it’s clear the security requirements of being attached to a hired bodyguard are putting you in a difficult decision. So I have spent some time and thought of a solution, which I have discussed with Richard and already got signed off.”<br />
<br />
Gerald’s aide handed a file to Cole, opening a second one on the desk right in front of Nico.<br />
<br />
“This new contract would mean that we continue to keep Cole in our service, while working to ensure our new dick department continues to be perceived positively by our staff. As you are both reading, Cole is going to be managing an on site gym for our male staff that will be open within the next two weeks.”<br />
<br />
Cole raised his eyebrow at the proposition. Giving his employer a quizzical look.<br />
<br />
“You will perform the duties of the on-site manager, and encourage the company specific rules within, namely, shirts and shoes allowed but otherwise full nudity. This will allow our transformed staff to interact with the other employees of the company.”<br />
<br />
“Sir, the security risks of me walking around with your son exposed all day are monumental!”<br />
<br />
“Let me finish, Cole. The entire floor will have extensive security, with a locked chamber for staff to be scrutinized by on site security before being allowed to reach the stairs of elevator. Also you will have a panic button on your wrist that locks down the entire building and calls in the every single one of your colleagues on our payroll. So don’t press it by accident.”<br />
<br />
“So I’ll be allowed to stay out of the cage?”<br />
Nico asked, his head bobbing up and down eagerly.<br />
<br />
“During work hours, which considering the nature of an on site gym can be quite flexible. You will of course have to remain in your protected case outside of the gym, but this way you are protected and still allowed some freedom. Is this acceptable to you Cole?”<br />
<br />
Cole spent a long minute processing the situation, figuring all the angles before nodding,<br />
<br />
“I’ll need to be involved in setting up the security systems, to prevent any weaknesses your enemies could exploit.”<br />
<br />
“Of course”<br />
<br />
“And I need to be allowed to cum!”<br />
<br />
“That will be an expected part of Cole’s work, son. Ensuring that our transformed staff are given the opportunity within the locker rooms to function fully as dicks. In the meantime, Cole, I am giving you the express instructions to allow Nico to cum at up to three times a day until the gym is up and running. To make up for the weeks of chastity.”<br />
<br />
“Three times a day! That will surely interfere with my ability to protect him sir.”<br />
<br />
“You have your orders Cole, and if you read the contract you are receiving a significant pay increase into you designated secret account, along with an increase in your public account to match a gym managers market income in such a large company. Now.”<br />
<br />
Gerald said with an air of finality.<br />
<br />
“Its, nearly 4:30pm, so you best get moving, as you have less then 8 hours to help Nico cum three times…”  <br />
Gerald’s tone caused Cole to nod, quickly signing the papers before taking his copy and leaving.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having just arrived home, Cole ordered a pizza, and then hopped in the shower. The shower feeling the only place it would be acceptable to be nude in his apartment.<br />
<br />
Slowly lathering up his body, he attempted to ignore Nico bobbing angrily up and down while he Cole cleaned himself. Finally turning the volume chip up so they could talk.<br />
<br />
“Finally! I want you to make me cum, right now, before you even think of eating any pizza.”<br />
<br />
Cole sighed quietly as he gripped Nico with both hands, rapidly stroking the oversensitive shaft and occasionally pulling down on his large balls. The sudden stimulation after so long with out relief caused Nico to erupt all over the shower wall. The thick heady smell of cum filling the bathroom as Nico’s pleading went quiet for a short moment before he starting demanding round two.<br />
<br />
Cole sighed, shaking his head as he reached down and silenced Nico’s voice chip, knowing the entitled brat would be mentally screaming, but unable to do anything about it until Cole was ready. <br />
<br />
Cole smirked as he dried himself off, opening the bathroom door to hear the insistent buzzing of the front door. Glancing at the clock, he realized he must have been in the shower longer then expected. Entirely his fault for spending so long avoiding his duty to Nico before giving him a rushed orgasm.<br />
<br />
Wrapping the towel tightly around his waist, Cole rushed to the door. Apologizing profusely to the pizza guy as he opened the door. <br />
<br />
“Oh! Uh-Whatever man, that’ll be $22”<br />
The young man clearly surprised at the tower of muscle standing before him, dripping wet and…<br />
Cole looked the pizza guy right in his green eyes, seeing the sudden panic and the flushing of his cheeks. Cole could read body language very well and knew the telltale signs of arousal. <br />
<br />
Not acknowledging the young mans embarrassment, Cole told him he would grab his wallet, walking back to the bathroom where his pants we lying on the floor. He was smirking slightly, thinking about the guy, guessing he was around 19 or twenty, barely a man in his eyes. Cole was used to the attention his large muscles got him, yet it was always the college aged twinks that seemed to have the biggest physical reaction, no matter how much they tried to hide it.<br />
<br />
Walking back with his wallet in his hands, Cole was pulling some cash out of his wallet, when Nico, who was rock hard, and pissed off at being silenced again, throbbed as hard as he could, causing the towel to come loose and fall to the floor.<br />
<br />
Cole froze mid-step, knowing how this must look to the young pizza guy. Knowing that Nico’s vigorous bobbing up and down would be interpreted as an invitation. The script like something out of a cheezey 80’s porno.<br />
<br />
The pizza guy swallowed, his green eyes wide as he stared at the thick cock bouncing up and down before him.<br />
<br />
“Do, do you want a hand with that?”<br />
<br />
Cole looked down at Nico, his eyebrow raised as Nico started bobbing up and down vigorously.<br />
Transfixed at the strange sight of this large meat with a silent mind of its own, the pulsing need flowing through it into his own body, making his heart race.<br />
<br />
Cole barely had time to look back up, as the pizza guy dropped the box on the nightstand by the door and dropped to his knees, his lips wrapping around Nico’s flared head, his tongue lapping insistently as Cole moaned. Nico’s cock body sending multitudes more pleasures signals directly to his brain.<br />
<br />
“Damn this kid is trouble.” Cole muttered as his mind fought against the pleasure while Nico throbbed in approval, his response causing the pizza guy to take more if him inside his mouth.<br />
<br />
Prior to being turned into his own cock, Nico had been a virgin. Cole’s two quick masturbation sessions with him being the only sexual thing he had down with another person. <br />
The resulting overload of pleasure on his unaccustomed mind was incredible, and the effect was blurring into Cole. <br />
<br />
Cole’s entire body felt like it was on fire with pleasure. The warm wet lips sliding up and down his shaft. The tongue cradling the underside and spreading the copious amounts of saliva around. All of this mixed with the heavy flow of precum that Nico was now leaking. A sensation he could only describe as drooling out pure pleasure. <br />
<br />
Opening his eyes, Cole found his hands gripping the back of the pizza guys head as hips bucked involuntarily. He was quickly reaching the point of no return.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna shoot!” <br />
<br />
Every muscle in Cole and Nico’s body started to tense up, the pressure bubbling up until it burst out. The entirety of Nico’s cock body spasming simultaneously with Cole’s muscular frame, the pizza man gagging and spluttering, unable to keep up with the massive flow of thick heady cum.<br />
Strained groans escaped Cole’s lips as his chest heaved, his body coated in a thin layer of sweat from his exertion, pleasure lighting up his brain like fireworks.<br />
Yet only a tiny fraction of what was flooding Nico’s entire mushy cock-brain. <br />
The tiny part that had overflowed into Cole’s body.<br />
Still a small part of Cole’s mind struggled to keep its composure, to think of how he was going to regain control of the situation and the wilfully disobedient piece of meat between his legs.<br />
<br />
Then, as the tidal surge of cum started to die down to a slow trickle, Cole did the one thing he never expected himself to do.<br />
<br />
He blacked out.<br />
<br />
<br />
A few minutes later Cole woke with a start, the sound of the sink in his bathroom alerting him that someone was in his apartment.<br />
Rising to his feet quickly, he found himself still woozy from the most extreme ejaculation in his life, but still managed to stumble down the hallway to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
The pizza guy was in his bathroom, having just finished gargling some mouthwash noticed Cole in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Hey man. Sorry I didn’t ask but you were kinda out cold and I still have a few more hours of deliveries. I can’t be rocking that cock breath if I wanna get enough tips to pay my bills.”<br />
<br />
“Uh- It’s, It’s alright. Um- Sorry about that. I normally don’t do…”<br />
Cole trailed off into silence as the young man smirked at him, clearly full of pride in the effect of his oral skill.<br />
<br />
The silence was broken by the young brunettes phone vibrating.<br />
<br />
Frowning slightly, he pulled a business card for the pizza place from his jacket pocket, and scribbled a number on it, before heading towards the door.<br />
<br />
“Gotta get back to work, but call me when you’re ready for round two. Oh and I still need the $22 for the pizza.”<br />
<br />
Cole picked his wallet off the floor, handed the young guy the $50 note and nodded when he looked back up at him with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
“Thanks!” He replied cheerily before quickly dashing down the hallway.<br />
<br />
Sighing again Cole closed the door, sitting his nude body down on the couch and flipping the card over in his hand. <br />
<br />
The pizza guys name was Nathan.<br />
Up until today Cole had considered himself straight, but now he had doubts. About himself, about Nico and about having another person swinging between his legs as a large cock with a mind of its own.<br />
This was the most complicated bodyguard job he had ever taken.<br />
<br />
Checking his watch, Cole saw it was 9:30, so head still had a few hours to provide Nico his third release for the day. Turning Nico’s voice chip back on, Cole was greeted by welcome silence as he slowly rose to his feet, made his way to the bathroom, dressed himself including Nico’s protective cage, and then sat down to enjoy his almost cold pizza.<br />
<br />
As Cole enjoyed his pizza, Nico basked in the afterglow of such an intense orgasm, his mind blissfully empty.<br />
It would be a while before he would be able to form coherent thoughts again, but he was too happy to care about anything like that right now.</p>
