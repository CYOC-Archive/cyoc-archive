<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Opting to start small, Cupid came to the decision that he’d start with the petting zoo. Since it was a weekday, the area was fairly quiet with just enough humans to fall victim to his scheme.<br />
<br />
The petting zoo was decorated like a colorful barn, since it catered more towards little kids. The residents of this area of the zoo included goats, sheep, miniature cattle, miniature donkeys, some pigs, chickens, and a pony. Cupid plopped his small bottom on a fence post and tapped his finger to his chin, looking for his next victim. Maybe making more farm animals wasn’t the most good he could do in the grand scheme of things, but at least he could take some humans out of the picture and give them a new role in life. <br />
<br />
Nearby, a mother (Samantha) chased her son through the petting zoo as he ran up to greet all the different animals. “Joshua, slow down this instant!” She called after him. The boy zipped this way and that, overstimulated by all the different animals. At least, until he stumbled upon the largest pig he had ever seen. “Woah, look at this guy, mom!” He exclaimed, giving the sleeping behemoth a few hearty slaps. “Can you give me the food bag? I wanna give him some treats!” His mother, winded, was finally catching up to him with a brown paper sack of animal pellets in tow. “Honey I don’t really think that guy needs more pellets, just look at the size of it.” She said back to him, but it was too late. He had already pulled out his best puppy dog eyes. His mother sighed, handing him the bag as she rolled her eyes. <br />
While none of the child’s previous actions woke the creature, the rustling of food in a bag did just the trick. Joshua spilled some pellets out onto his hand to feed the porcine beast. As her son got his hand covered in sticky pig saliva and the beast munched away, his mother read the sign above the pig’s house. This animal’s name was Carol, and she was a huge black potbelly pig. She was so well fed, that her eyes were barely visible under the swollen folds of her face. Her bloated cheeks jiggled joyously as she made quick work of the pellets. Suddenly, Joshua jumped. “Ouch!!” The boy exclaimed painfully, wincing. “What’s wrong, did it vote you? Don’t tell me that thing but you, this zoo has lawsuit written all over it.” His mother continued rambling angrily as she rushed forward to check on her son. “No mom, it’s fine. Must have been some kind of big bite. I’m okay. I think this pig really likes me!” He explained, rubbing the pigs ears with one hand as he fed her with the other. She cocked her head for him, drool frothing from the corners of her mouth. ‘Disgusting animal.’ His mother thought to herself. Her kid could always see beauty in things nobody else liked. As much as that trait was the bane of her existence, she was proud of him for it. Although, she could do without him constantly trying to bring gross animals home, like orphaned opossums or injured geckos. She shuddered. She figured he’d be preoccupied by the pig for a bit, so she quietly decided to have a much needed rest on a bench in the shade while he made friends with the pig.<br />
<br />
Little did she know, Joshua was about to be much more than friends with the pig soon. Before he knew it, he had fed her all the pellets in the bag. “Sorry, I’m all out of food.” The pig grunted curiously, sniffing the boy. Her flat nose pushed into his neck, her hot breath tickling him. He laughed playfully, now aware of just how large and strong this animal was as he was unable to push her away. It was like pushing a living boulder! Carol licked her new companion across the neck, leaving sticky drool behind and tickling him more as he laughed and laughed. She wagged her coiled tail like an excited puppy as she pushed him to his back, licking his face now and grunting playfully. That was when he realized his chest was feeling tight, so he reached down and noticed an odd swelling under his shirt. It felt like he had several huge insect bites all up and down his abdomen. “Huh?” He struggled, his pig companion making things difficult. He pulled back the collar of his shirt and noticed…. BREASTS?! His pectorals were swelling by the second, jiggling with each breath like water balloons. “Woah….” He reached down to cup one, gasping at the sensitivity of his swollen nipple that now tented his shirt. That was when Carol suddenly started tugging his shirt, until RRRRRRRIIIIPPP!! The pig tore his shirt in half! Joshua suddenly started feeling hot all over, his new budding bosom free to the world. The pig was also entranced, and licked his exposed belly, tickling him once again. “No, stop that!” He managed to protest between giggles. A new development awaited him as his nipples began to produce milk! Droplets of the stuff gathered in beads on his sensitive nipples. That was the least of his worries, as new breasts began to swell up down his belly. When he reached a hand to inspect them, he found that was changed too! He now had pig trotters for hands! Now his breath quickened, he started to panic as large triangular ears flipped over his head. He was starting to fatten up. “Mom!!” He squealed, now starting to sound more like a pig. “Joshua!!” She screamed, seeing her transforming child. That’s when she, too, felt a distinct prick on her rear. She could have sworn she heard a faint giggle in the air. Everything started to feel… foggy. She snapped back and looked back down at her son, now half pig with massive breasts growing down his underbelly like a beast! <br />
Joshua now has a tent in his shorts, and he had worked up a thrusting motion in the air. “Something is wrong, we need to call a zookeeper!” Exclaimed the distressed parent. She reached for her phone, but it slid out of her hands as they changed to match her son’s. She noticed a throbbing pain in her crotch, and dared to look down. A small tent was growing in her tight mom jeans. Now, Carol walked over and shoved her massive head in the mom’s crotch, huffing heavily. She was frozen in fear as the pig took in her scent, then grabbed the fabric of her jeans and began tugging. They did start to feel so tight.., and hot… she gave in, assisting the pig in removing her pants, exposing her new changes. A swollen pink scrotum bounced freely as the clothing was removed, anointed by a growing pink nub. That’s was the sow was after. Carol began licking away at the developing pointy penis of the changing human. Samantha gasped heavily, grunting. The pleasure was intense, and new beastial hormones surged through her changing body. The sheath moved up Samantha’s belly quite a bit, making room for the long, corkscrewed equipment growing inside. She looked up groggily to see Joshua having climaxed several times into the air. His equipment had shrunk, and he was now MUCH larger. He struggled to kick off his shorts with changing legs, his boxers ripping to shreds moments after, exposing his plump rump and dainty tail. Distracted, Samantha came suddenly for the first time with her new equipment, runny pig spunk spattering onto Carol’s wrinkled face. Samantha’s penis had finished developing, and her breasts were being swallowed by her ever expanding fat. Joshua was almost fully a sow as he, no she, waddled over squealing, and presented her newly minted rump to her former mother, looking back with a mix of embarrassment and feral need. Her face was quickly losing human features. Carol too, lines herself up next to Joshua and exposed her rump to Samantha. Lost in new feelings and not in control of her actions, Samantha lined himself up with Joshua, putting his trotters on her hips. The pink, hard tip of his spiraled penis started poking in and out of his sheath, ready for penetration. For all it was worth, he held himself back as long as he could, until Joshua backed up her rear onto the undercarriage of the changed beast behind her. This is all he needed, and Samantha thrusted into the sow below him. They were livestock now, not mother and son, and they only had one purpose. The boar on top thrusted hard into the sow below him over and over, both still gaining mass as the final changes took place. Joshua felt the curly equipment darting up and down rapidly within her freshly made birth canal, learning new pleasure as new muscles inside her massaged and contracted around the shaft plunging in and out. Samantha began to feel feverishly hot and began thrusting as fast and deep as he could, engorged testicles feeling tight and close as they slapped Joshua’s plump pink thighs. Finally, he had his second male orgasm, ensuring himself a litter in the new sow. He shot his load for several minutes, then finally dismounted. His work wasn’t done however, as he almost immediately got to servicing Carol. The new sow wandered off as her mate got busy again, the petting zoo having gained two new pigs with more on the way soon.</p>
