<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So tell me, what do you want girl?&quot;, Joan said this with curiosity in her mind. Melissa felt stuck in the doorway, almost afraid of moving.<br />
<br />
&quot;The....the...the...smell.....&quot;, Melissa could barely even speak as she was overwhelmed with the smell of goat. Joan now noticed the girls face was changing right in front of her eyes. Melissa&#39;s once human nose has turned black, and shrunk a bit on her face, almost looking like a mushroom, or you could say it looked like a dogs nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, she&#39;s horny&quot;, Knowing that Melissa had the beginning of a dog muzzle made Joan extremely horny, but she wouldn&#39;t give in to those pleasures yet. Joan than got up off of her painting chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why... Are you still naked?&quot;, Melissa wanted to change the subject, as she got a good look at Joan. Joan&#39;s face looked totally different with a goat muzzle, almost creepy. She couldn&#39;t help but feel aroused from Joan, even with the muzzle. It was definitely from her own confidence, thats why beautiful women can marry men who might not seem as attractive. Beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someday you will understand how good it feels to be naked like a animal girl&quot;, Joan slowly walked towards Melissa. &quot;How it makes you feel like a animal, Just a dumb furry animal&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never just strip my clothes like you. You old hag!&quot;, Melissa regained her composure, and felt somewhat threatened. She curled her lip, and almost had the instinct to bark, before getting interrupted.<br />
<br />
Joan had a theory, a very juicy theory on what this girl mentioned earlier. &quot;She mentioned a smell right, could she mean my........ Goat urine&quot;, Joan couldn&#39;t help how her urine would come out, or obviously the pungent odor. Henry had hated the smell, which at the time really hurt her feelings, &quot;But dogs are different..... They love anything, they sniff butts, they eat cat poop, and its obvious this girl is becoming a dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here girl, smell this&quot;, Joan closed the distance between the two, and in her hand was her painting brush, laced with her own smell.<br />
<br />
Melissa staggered backwards, looking at the blue tinted brush that was being offered to her. This made her furry black tail begin to wag in excitement. Before she could even think, she put her smaller, but intense nose near the brush, and sniffed it.<br />
<br />
Joan was right! This girl, her sons bitchy girlfriend was sniffing her goat urine brush.... This was so heavily erotic, and fucked up at the same time. As Melissa was enjoying herself, Joan could only think of her future in the cabin. Did she want to lay down, and fuck a goat? No, that seems so boring now, but this girl was different. Maybe it was the fact that someone actually liked her smell, but her thought process was changing.<br />
<br />
&quot;This girl could be my mate.....&quot;, Dog and Goat sounded silly, but maybe it would work out. Joan originally wanted herself, and Henry to become goats, and why not? They were both married, it was ironic though that even that didn&#39;t work out. There marriage was pretty bad at the later stages.&quot;Jess was probably a better wife for Henry anyways&quot;, Joan thought this with a ounce of sadness. <br />
<br />
James was another chance for a mate, but that thought was quickly thrown out the window, as he is slowly becoming a mare, a mare that would have no need for Joan. Now there was this girl... Melissa and they both hated eachother even before the cabin. She was a bitch, a daddy&#39;s girl, a bitch, probably a gold digger, a bitch, a primadonna, and finally a bitch. At least that was how Joan viewed Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she could be my bitch&#128149;&quot;, Joan now realized this could work, Melissa could be her mate, this is why she&#39;s here. If she could make this girl leave James, and come to her, it would be like Anakin Skywalker joining the darkside. She could corrupt this girl, never in lightyears would she have imagined herself in a relationship with this girl, but the cabin worked in mysterious ways. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot; I should be embarrassed, but Wow this smell is so good, bloody hell&quot;, Melissa kept on sniffing the utensil, as Joan was lost in thought. Of course her muzzle wasn&#39;t even half grown yet, she would need a sexual encounter to actually seel it.<br />
<br />
Joan finally lifted the brush away, making her move.      &quot;Hey why did yo......&quot;, Melissa was so lost from sniffing the brush, that she forget where she was for a second. Melissa noticed Joans nice breasts as they hung down slightly from her body, normal for a borderline 40 year old woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look up at me Melissa&quot;, Said Joan with intensity. This sentence was actually very powerful, It obviously pointed out that Melissa was staring at her breasts, which brought her instantly in the conversation, and slightly humiliated her. Two, Joan for the first time since being in the cabin actually called Melissa by her actual name, instead of &#39;girl&#39;. It was the idea of taking something away from someone, and bringing it back. Being called &#39;girl&#39;, was something Melissa was used to being called now. This was a physiological battle, and it was very powerful, and made Melissa almost obedient in just one sentence !<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, What... Joan&quot;, Melissa was clearly nervous, and was fidgeting her fingers in angst.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like this smell don&#39;t you&quot;, Joan was done playing games, and being very blunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, it was bloody good&quot;, Melissa whispered this as she couldn&#39;t believe she admitted that openly, Joan being so open, and honest made Melissa honest also!<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember what I told you two days ago?&quot;,<br />
<br />
Melissa knew what she was on about, and instantly was aggressive!<br />
<br />
&quot;Im not leaving James!!!&quot;, Melissa spoke up, and showed a bit of backbone.<br />
<br />
The naked Joan was happy that she was still fighting this fact, it would be more juicy when she eventually joins her at her side. She loved the mental struggle, but she was sure she would win this!<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa... Bleat...darling, its your choice, but I have a choice for you to make&quot;, Joan was getting serious now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave my son, and join me ...Bleat...by my side&quot;, As she was getting more excited, she could barely control her bleating. She wanted this to come out as clear as possible, so she would hold the next few in.   <br />
<br />
Now Joan was inches away from Melissa, and stared right into her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seduce, and fuck Henry. If you do this my door will be fully open!&quot; joan knew she made a promise with James to stop conspiring, and seducing the family, but he never said anything about Melissa doing the seducing &quot;Kekekekek&quot;, she internally was laughing. She had shook Henry&#39;s hand, and promised a truce, but her finger was crossed, nullifying the entire promise.<br />
<br />
&quot;And before you go dear I promise you this, I can be whatever you want me to be, I can be your mom, your dad, your lover, even your master.......&quot;, She let that last word hang, however she wasn&#39;t finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will give you all the attention you will ever desire, I will fuck you night and day!&quot; As Joan said this she pushed Melissa out the door, not wanting to give the girl any more attention, and also wanted to let her words stew in the brunettes mind.<br />
<br />
Fully out the door, Joan shut, and locked her door, leaving Melissa in the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I Dont even know what to think&quot;, as Melissa mumbled this her nose turned whiteish, and her face was back to a humans. She was truly now left with her own thoughts.</p>
