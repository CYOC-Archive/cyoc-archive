<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryan was making his way upstairs to go to the bathroom, silently cursing at his trick knee with every step. <br />
Before he reached the top, he thought he heard his son's bedroom door open and close, yet Simon was watching <br />
TV downstairs. His hearing aid must be acting up again. But sure enough, Mark came walking towards the stairs, <br />
offering to help him up. He rejected the offer. He didn't need his grandson's help to do something so simple. <br />
He might not be as fit and healthy as the heavily bearded man, a thing that irritated him because he taught <br />
his grandkids to be proud of their hefty bodies and Mark seemed to do his best to rid himself of it, but he <br />
wasn't some senile, incompetent, old man just yet. He still had a bit of life in him, even if he needed a <br />
cane. Mark frowned and waited for Bryan to reach the top of the stairs before making his way down. Bryan <br />
wondered what he was doing in Simon's room, but that would have to wait for his bladder to empty. He entered <br />
the bathroom and fiddled with his belt before managing to relieve himself.  His felt the heft of his penis in <br />
his hand while he urinated. He hadn't been able to see it in decades as his rotund stomach developed. Not that <br />
it mattered since he developed erectile dysfunction around the same time. Nevertheless, he finished his <br />
business and left the bathroom, seeing Danny run down the stairs with his workout gear. He shook his head in <br />
shame. Following in his brother's footsteps with that health mumbo jumbo. He himself ate whatever he wanted <br />
and barely exercised throughout his life and yet, despite numerous health scares, he had made it to 80 years <br />
old. He was even disappointed by the boy's hair, which had barely even started to recede despite being 25 now. <br />
At least he still had Jay to be proud of. Bryan let out a dismayed sigh and entered his son's room to see what <br />
Mark was doing. Nothing looked out of place, but then he noticed some sort of device on the desk at the foot <br />
of his bed. He was no expert in technology, but he knew he'd never seen anything like it. After a bit of <br />
fiddling, he turned it on. His success went downhill quickly once he noticed the words on the screen were too <br />
small for him to read, even with his prescription glasses. He looked for anything that looked like it could <br />
help, and could just make out the words &quot;increase&quot; and &quot;decrease&quot; somewhere in the middle. It couldn't hurt to <br />
try. He clicked on the increase button multiple times, realising that it did nothing to increase the font <br />
size. Irritated, he switched the device off. It's not like technology ever enriched his life anyway. He <br />
grunted as he got out of the seat and made his way back downstairs to join his son on the sofa.<br />
<br />
Danny started up the car while he waited for Mark to come by. While he sat there, he felt a bunch of shivers <br />
go up his back in succession. It was a chilly day, but it didn't feel that cold in the car. His thoughts were <br />
disrupted as Mark opened the passenger door and they drove off. What neither of them realised was that Bryan <br />
had accidentally started up the Chronivac onto the quick changes page, designed to make any adjustments to <br />
ongoing transformations, where he had increased the speed of Danny's aging from 1 year every 48 minutes to 1 <br />
year every 4.8 minutes. It was already becoming apparent as his hairline started to recede again, now <br />
disappearing faster than ever, and his stomach started to expand slightly. The drive to the gym was long, <br />
about 15 minutes if traffic was clear, but the road could jam up pretty quickly at times, sometimes taking an <br />
hour just to get there or back. It may of been inconvenient, but it was the cheapest one close to their home, <br />
even taking in the price of fuel. Luckily for Danny, it was a smooth journey, making it there just as he <br />
reached 28 years old. His hairstyle had changed again, being more closely cropped so as to not emphasize his <br />
hair loss, which had taken a couple of inches off the front and a small bald spot was developing at the back. <br />
His goatee had extended further along his jaw as it connected to his sideburns, leaving his cheeks and upper <br />
lip free of hair, or as free as it could be given the stubbly shadow. He had put on a bit of weight during the <br />
journey but his muscles still remained visible, barring his stomach which had bulged out a bit more. Mark had <br />
noticed how much he seemed to have changed on the journey, but he chalked it up to being similar to how he'd <br />
changed during his first jog to the shop. But by the time they'd made it into the gym and gotten changed, Mark <br />
was getting a bit concerned about his now 30 year old brother. He'd lost another inch of so off his hairline, <br />
with a thin strip of hair separating it from the enlarged bald spot at the back, and an island of hair <br />
floating in the sea of skin at the front of his head. His chin curtain beard had a few stray grey hairs now <br />
littered amongst the brown. His body hair seemed to increase a bit more, a healthy growth now sticking out of <br />
his vest in all directions. Danny seemed to be aware of the changes as well, self-conscious of his hairline, <br />
but he kept repeating to himself that he wasn't getting older quickly, his previous memories were just a <br />
dream. They both separated to work at different stations, yet Mark wanted to stay close by and observe his <br />
brother's changes more. He was sure he should by 26 by now, yet his memories told him he was 30 going on 31. <br />
Maybe leaving the Chronivac by itself wasn't such a good idea.</p>
