<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was Thursday by the time Ethan met up with Haylee again. They crossed paths right before swimming practice, and immediately she pulled him aside, and asked about the fair.<br />
<br />
&quot;You set me up!&quot; He was still miffed about her interference. &quot;Putting me on the same thing as him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, but I&#39;m not sorry. I did what had to be done!&quot; Haylee folded her arms. &quot;The real question is: did it work? Like, at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. I mean, yes, I had fun. Yes, he&#39;s sweet, and kinda charming, and I- ... I enjoyed myself, but that was it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you DID hit it off!&quot; Her eyes lit up, and she gave him a calculating look. &quot;I&#39;ve actually got an idea. Are you going to the costume party tomorrow evening? The one Mindy is hosting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, she made a point of inviting me, but ... eh.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;I wasn&#39;t going to. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because a certain somebody is definitely gonna be there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; She grinned. &quot;We&#39;re gonna put you in a disguise, like a male Cinderella, and you&#39;re gonna go get your Prince Charming!&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
The costume that Haylee chose was a superhero costume that was very close fitting and didn&#39;t leave too much to the imagination. Perhaps more importantly, it came with a mask that almost completely obscured his face, making for a near perfect identity-hiding disguise. Ethan could admit that it flattered his physical fitness a great deal, which Haylee was eager to remind him was the point -- she was insistent he &#39;flaunt all that work in the water&#39; by showing it off, but at the same time he felt like a piece of meat on display. Still, if it meant he could maybe talk to Lucas in a social setting and maybe find out if his interest was mutual, that had to be worth it!<br />
<br />
The party was fairly close to the Morales house, so Ethan simply walked the few blocks to the venue. Mindy&#39;s parents were wealthy, like a lot of those Ethan went to school with, and their house was big. It was mid-evening, and there were already a few people around, but they were mostly clustered inside. He joked around a little with the comments about his spandex-clad look, playing it off as a joke when he got some wolf-whistles from the girls -- and also a couple from the guys -- though none of them appeared to recognise him, with his anonymity intact.<br />
<br />
After that, Ethan explored the place a bit -- if Lucas had already arrived, he was somewhere else. The backyard was expansive and well-tended, and the pool was beautifully maintained. The only thing a little overgrown was the bordering hedge -- it hadn&#39;t been pruned in a while, and there were tendrils of it poking out at weird angles. They were the scratchy kind with deceptively sharp foliage. Ethan didn&#39;t think much of it at all, until he was exiting the pool enclosure.<br />
<br />
Brushing away the intruding hedge branches as he tried to squeeze out the gate, he didn&#39;t realise one of them had snagged on his costume. Pushing the errant branch free, he heard -- and felt -- the material catch and rip as a hole was torn from where it lay hooked. The material was stretchy, but both layers -- the outer and the inner under -- parted as if sliced by a surgeon&#39;s scalpel. Ethan could only stare in surprise and horror at the hanging flap of fabric -- in the worst possible place! -- with the skin of his crotch exposed underneath.<br />
<br />
No!<br />
<br />
There was a sound from the patio of a door opening, and Ethan couldn&#39;t think of anything but being caught by another guest, before his panic took over. Making a beeline for the gardening shed, he slipped inside and pulled the door to. Waiting a few seconds to make sure he was safe, he calmed a bit and looked down to assess the damage.<br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s heart was still pounding rapidly, and he inspected the costume&#39;s condition. The accident had opened a gap that couldn&#39;t have been more accurately chosen even if it had been intentional sabotage by a tailor. Not only that, but it was a clear and direct open window into his most embarrassing secret.<br />
<br />
Two tiny balls and a soft thin penis, young and smooth, all together in a hairless package at the middle of his groin.<br />
<br />
Without knowing better, anyone would think they were looking at someone half his age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; Ethan thought to himself, staring at his conundrum. &quot;How do I get out of this? At least nobody knows it&#39;s me.&quot; He fiddled with the torn material, trying to pull or fold it into a protective position so he could at least temporarily hide himself, but there was no way he could make it cover what it needed and stay in place. He had basically shot himself in the foot -- or groin, perhaps -- by accident. &quot;Maybe if I send Eric a message? There&#39;s no guarantee he&#39;ll answer quickly though, and I might need him to. I can&#39;t hide in this shed all night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he could formulate a better plan, the door clicked open, and another person stepped in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought I saw someone come here in a hurry.&quot; Lucas was dressed as a Japanese ninja, with all black clothing, fake nunchucks, and a couple of plastic shuriken on his belt. &quot;You okay there, Steve Rogers?&quot; The joking tone didn&#39;t last long, until his gaze swept over a frozen Ethan&#39;s crotch, taking in the clearly diminutive state. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s, um, quite the wardrobe malfunction you&#39;ve got going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck! Why did it have to be Lucas, with his helpful nature, friendly attitude, and stupidly charming smile?<br />
<br />
Out of ALL the people ... why him?!<br />
<br />
Even worse, Ethan knew he couldn&#39;t say anything, because while probably most other students weren&#39;t able to identify him just by voice, after the amount of time he&#39;d spent with Lucas recently? It was a sure bet he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, are you cool? Sorry I didn&#39;t knock, but don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t, um, say anything. Just thought you mighta needed help after how quickly you ran in. What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
His name.<br />
<br />
He had to say something!<br />
<br />
The secret would be out soon enough, so maybe just ... tell the truth?<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Lucas, it&#39;s- ... it&#39;s me.&quot; Ethan reached up and pulled off his mask. &quot;I&#39;m, uh, sorry I was hiding from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas blinked, not saying anything for a few moments as he processed what was in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s a surprise.&quot; Then, a thoughtful look. &quot;I should have known it was you, not many people from school can accurately pull off a superhero&#39;s physique.&quot; He gave a flirtatious wink, and the reaction being a compliment was so shocking that Ethan&#39;s mouth just about fell all the way open. &quot;But, uh, what&#39;s happened to your ... y&#39;know?&quot;<br />
<br />
He pointed down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s like this.&quot; Ethan clenched his fists nervously as he explained, his face red. &quot;I found this magic ring that lets you swap body parts. Since Eric&#39;s been teased at school, I let him swap our junk to boost his confidence. We&#39;ve kept doing it regularly, because, uh,&quot; he hesitated, but decided to say it, &quot;we both enjoy it a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A magic swapping ring? If the evidence wasn&#39;t in front of me, I would think you&#39;re lying.&quot; He glanced down again, seeming completely unfazed by how small and immature Ethan was, staying just as composed as he&#39;d been earlier. &quot;So, that&#39;s Eric&#39;s penis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ethan agreed shakily, though he didn&#39;t say more than that.<br />
<br />
No reason to tell him it&#39;s mine too, Ethan thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, I think it&#39;s amazing you&#39;d do something like that for him, take that risk. He&#39;s lucky to have a big brother like you.&quot; Lucas&#39; expression softened, and he pulled a couple of small items out of a pouch at his waist. &quot;Let&#39;s get you fixed up. A ninja always comes prepared.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan stared, his mouth open as Lucas crouched in front of him, unable to believe this was happening. With deft fingers, Lucas pulled the torn pouch into the correct position, and while holding it in place, began to stuff a wadded-up handkerchief through the gap. With a flirty glance up, his eyes met Ethans and he smiled. &quot;Can&#39;t forget this, the superhero has to look the part.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, he slid a couple of safety pins through the material, anchoring it, before standing again.<br />
<br />
Had that actually just happened?<br />
<br />
The entire time, Ethan was dumbfounded, and even as he watched Lucas calmly fasten the material together, he had to repress the strange pleasant sensations of fabric rubbing over his sensitive crotch. The moment it was out of sight, he couldn&#39;t hold back, and with secret horror, felt his dick stiffen and push out into a tiny erection, straining desperately into the cotton.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t just the sensations, it was also Lucas&#39; calm-and-collected response that was seriously turning him on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since we&#39;re being honest, I should probably tell you,&quot; Lucas straightened, and then gave a relaxed shrug, like it wasn&#39;t a big deal, &quot;I like you, if it isn&#39;t already completely obvious. I was interested from the very start. You had my attention the moment we shook hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W- ... what?&quot; Ethan spluttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true. Attraction at first sight, if you like.&quot; He smirked and then pointed a thumb at the door. &quot;Hey you wanna get out of here? And by that I mean leave the party, not just this garden shed. I only came because I thought you might be here too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; He pushed open the door, and together they emerged, though Ethan was still feeling incredibly unsteady from what had just happened. &quot;Don&#39;t mind a party every so often, but eh, I was kinda &#39;take it or leave it&#39; on this one. Didn&#39;t think THIS would happen though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too. Um, I mean, I only came because someone said you would be here too. I&#39;m not big on parties.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that news Lucas perked up even more. &quot;Can I take you home, then? You didn&#39;t drive tonight, did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, I didn&#39;t drive. I live too close.&quot; His nerves began to finally calm. &quot;So yeah, you can walk me. Let&#39;s go!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, they threaded their way back through the house, made apologies to Mindy, and were out the door and away.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It was only a few blocks back home, but the two of them walked and made harmless small talk along the way. Ethan felt like he was floating through some kind of bizarre dream, and before he knew it, they were at the Morales front door. The conversation turned serious again, and Ethan felt jittery, though this time it was a different sort of anxiety. Lucas had stepped in close, closer than a normal friend would stand, but to Ethan it wasn&#39;t uncomfortable, just ... intimate, in a way that really made his heart race.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so you know, this -- this evening, I mean -- hasn&#39;t changed anything for the worse. Actually, it&#39;s the opposite. I&#39;m even more curious now.&quot; He scratched his chin thoughtfully, and smiled coyly. &quot;Though, I&#39;m a little disappointed I didn&#39;t get to see the &#39;normal&#39; you. You made the swim meet super memorable.&quot;<br />
<br />
The &#39;normal&#39; him? Swim meet? Then Ethan remembered: he was full-size in the showers with no towel.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I hope someday ... maybe you&#39;ll let me?&quot; Lucas handed his phone to Ethan. &quot;Can I get your number?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sure.&quot; Ethan flushed red, and added himself to the contacts list, before handing the phone back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll text you.&quot; He grinned. &quot;Have a good evening, say hi to Eric, oh ... and ... Ethan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas leaned in, and quick and natural, and planted a kiss. He lingered for just a second, his lips wonderfully soft and warm, before he drew back again. There was a momentary playful look, and he was off, a big smile all over his face as he stepped onto the footpath and then down the street.<br />
<br />
Fumbling for his keys, Ethan pushed open the door, and closed it heavily, leaning back in shock. His heart was pounding like mad, his chest was tight, his face was hot, but most of all, his short extra-hard super-sensitive cock was throbbing with an unbelievable sexual appreciation.<br />
<br />
Completely without meaning to, his right hand absently, and lightly, brushed his thigh, and ... that was enough!<br />
<br />
Clapping his left over his mouth to stifle the moans, Ethan&#39;s butt and calves clenched, and his hips pushed forward as his tiny child-size dick twitched and trembled. Splashes of liquid sprayed through the crotch stuffing, in a series of desperate humiliating attempts by his juvenile penis, to prove that it was worthy of a kiss.</p>
