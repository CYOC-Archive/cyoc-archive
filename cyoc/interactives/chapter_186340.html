<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The kid barely flinched when Ken&#39;s gelatinous body clung to his shorts. Sure, Ken&#39;s form has a thin membrane preventing him from wetting the kid&#39;s shorts. But at the very least, he must have noticed the heaviness behind him. The two passed by a glass window and saw the kid fidgeting with his Misfit phone. Typical…<br />
<br />
The kid turned and entered a shop. From the coldness and the sweet smell lingering in the air, Ken assumed that they just entered an ice cream parlor. Like the rest of the amenities on the island, the ice creams here are also free. The shop has two floors, downstairs where patrons could dine in a public setting and upstairs where they can eat their ice cream in the privacy of their private lounges. The kid went upstairs and chose a room adjacent to the farthest wall of the shop. Inside the room is a conversational sofa with a complimentary coffee table shaped according to the curves of the sofa. There&#39;s a television above but it&#39;s muted. The kid sat on the sofa and felt a strange squish on his butt. He turned around to check but saw nothing. Ken was too slow to pull out one of his remaining appendages but pulled it out nonetheless in the time the kid turned around to look. The kid changed tabs in his Misfit phone and ordered himself a simple sundae. There is so much more he could order and yet, he went for the simplest one. He probably picked the place, not for the ice cream but for the privacy it could give. <br />
<br />
Ken was about to jump on the kid when the door opened. That was quick. The scantily dressed waiter settled the sundae on the table. He looked around the room and mentally judged the kid for being another bum using the establishment as their private lounges. Then he noticed a familiar glint hiding underneath the sofa. He worked on this island for years, and he&#39;d recognize a slime when he sees one. Nevertheless, he left the room without a say. As he turned, Ken could see the waiter&#39;s exposed butt which earned a snicker from the kid.<br />
<br />
Slithering underneath the coffee table, Ken prepared himself for a jump. He backed out a bit and gathered his momentum. He was slow but the kid was so busy with his phone that he only noticed when he felt a slithering feeling underneath his shirt. When he looked down to see, half of Ken&#39;s body was already inside his shorts. More are getting inside by the second. The kid tried to fling the watery mess but his small fingers were just passing through. He tried to call for help but it&#39;s futile. The room is soundproof and the waiter from before is holding the door tight. <br />
<br />
Ken struggled. It&#39;s dark and the kid&#39;s thrashing is making this harder. Nonetheless, several of his appendages found an orifice to attack. They gathered momentum as he did before, and went straight in their holes. The easiest to enter is the kid&#39;s mouth. The kid was screaming which made his mouth the ever inviting hole. Next in the difficulty is the ass. The kid is clenching his asshole as if he&#39;s holding diarrhea. His current predicament, however, is the opposite. Viscous tendrils are squeezing inside his clenched asshole and no amount of holding can completely block him. And then there&#39;s the most difficult of the three holes Ken is entering. The kid&#39;s flaccid 4-inch dick. Ken didn&#39;t even think that the kid had a dickhole in the start because he couldn’t grasp the hole. Then he realized that the kid just had a thick foreskin that hid his hole well. Finding it is half the battle. The other half is thinning himself and slithering inside his vibrating shaft. <br />
<br />
The more Ken&#39;s body entered, the more he felt what the kid was feeling. His mouth is in desperate need of a gasp of air but found it difficult when a viscous creature is filling his esophagus whole. His ass is a mess. The kid is mustering all his strength just to keep his asshole clenched but his energy is wasted as Ken could easily sneak between the cracks. Have you ever had a long satisfying piss that left you shaking at the end? That&#39;s what their penis is feeling right now. In this case, that shaking feeling is every second that Ken is pushing himself inside that dick hole.<br />
<br />
The struggle is done. The waiter smiled behind the door and left when he heard nothing but silence in the room. There was no distinct transition between his gelatinous body and this new juvenile one. There was the darkness of all the holes he&#39;s entering, the wetness of his entrails - then there was the vision of the lounge getting clearer every passing second. He&#39;s still wet though. Not because of the wet innards, but it seems the kid is perspiring buckets from the struggle. His eyes are heavy with tears. Snot is drooling out of his nose the same way saliva overfilled his hanging mouth. Then there&#39;s also this tightness inside his shorts. Ken raised his new teeny hands and reached to open the zippers of his shorts. His dick plopped out, hard as a rod and leaking heavily at the tip. Ken wasn&#39;t sure if that was pre-cum or it was his gelatinous form. But when the liquid zipped inside his shaft, causing him to squirm in ecstatic pleasure, he knew that liquid was himself. <br />
<br />
Ken propped himself on the sofa and stood on the leather-coated surface even though his knees were still weak. Above the sofa are rectangular panels of mirrors that lined the three walls of the room. Ken could see his reflection on the surface. It&#39;s a boy on the cusp of adolescence. He&#39;s got looks but otherwise, looks typical for a guy his age. His hair is sunflower yellow; two are blocked where the top and crown are long, and the sides are cropped and dyed brown. His eyes are amber but at the right angle, they shone like coins. Ken talked in babbles. Ridiculous but a good way to describe his rich and deepening voice. <br />
<br />
Ken sat on the sofa. He wiped the tears, snot, and saliva from his face, then tasted the melting sundae on the table. Ice creams are one of the many victims of his gluttonous sweet tooth. But when the ice cream hit his tongue, it tasted... okay? It&#39;s not as delectable as he remembered it but not bad either. Ken ate more but abandoned it after a few more bites.</p>
