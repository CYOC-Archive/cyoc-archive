<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I don&#39;t know, do something funny,&quot; I finally relented after some thought. <br />
&quot;What am I, a magical clown?&quot; Lara scowled. She looked across the way and noticed a group of students gathered. Her ears twitched. They were talking about succubi. No- they were talking about a board game. Something along the lines of Dungeons and Dragons. Oddly enough there was a handful of students male and female. &quot;Odd, when last I was Earth-side, gaming was dominated by men. Women were always so adverse.&quot;<br />
&quot;When you were last here?&quot; I asked, thinking she must have come here a long time ago. <br />
&quot;It was before I was a full-fledged succubus. I was doing research for a class.&quot;<br />
&quot;What the fuck...&quot; I asked in barely a whisper. <br />
&quot;You want to see something funny, here,&quot; she announced, turning and marching towards the gamers. I called after her but to no avail. I just had to run her down and figure out what she was up to. Just as I sprinted across the courtyard Lara had already been welcomed into the gamer group and was all smiles. &quot;Oh, Jethro, meet Jake, Drew, Adam, Eliza, and Mary-Beth,&quot; Lara introduced the group. I could only grimace at the cliched sounds of their names. It was no wonder they were all gamers. &quot;They were just going to tell me about their game Blades and Babes and what roles they prefer to play as.&quot;<br />
&quot;Blades and Babes?&quot; I asked, cocking an eyebrow. It sounded like a really horny knock-off of Dungeons and Dragons that likely involved scantily clad witches and the ability to fuck them. <br />
&quot;Hey would you two like to join us?&quot; Jake asked, flashing a smile that Jethro figured must have cost his parents a small fortune. <br />
&quot;Uh, no thanks we were just leaving,&quot; I answer, gripping Lara by her arm and trying to drag her away. I was actually intrigued by the game. I loved gaming and grew up with it, one of the sole comforts my father could always guarantee. Alyssa didn&#39;t care for them and as long as my Dad payed for them Mom couldn&#39;t do anything about it. The problem was that I knew if Lara actually used her powers to &#39;do something funny&#39; it would be at these guys&#39; expense and I couldn&#39;t have that on my concious. <br />
&quot;Hey, you wanted me to prove I have magic,&quot; Lara hissed at me, barely audible. Mary-beth seemed to hear though as she suddenly went stiff. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to let you make these five the butt of a joke,&quot; I insisted.<br />
&quot;W-wait, Lara did you say you have magic?&quot; Mary-beth asked, looking like a hopeful little girl on christmas morning. <br />
&quot;Yes&quot;<br />
&quot;No&quot; came our simultaneous answer.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s cool. I prefer to play as a knight, myself,&quot; Jake noted, butting in on the conversation.<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t pretend to have magic, I actually have magic,&quot; Lara insisted.<br />
&quot;No you don&#39;t,&quot; I retorted.<br />
&quot;Yes I do.&quot;<br />
&quot;No you do-&quot; I was cut off by Lara snapping her fingers towards Jake. He stumbled back a bit, likely surprised by the sudden gesture. Then he began to fidget. Drew, a stocky individual asked if Jake was alright to which he replied he was uncertain. Just as he did, a five o&#39;clock shadow form and gradually grew into a full beard and mustache. His hair, once neatly trimmed and parted to the side grew out down the back of his neck. His stature increased a few inches until he stood five foot, ten inches. His muscles began to bulge and all around him his clothes changed to a suit of shiny armor and a longsword at his side. <br />
&quot;You are now Sir Jake,&quot; Lara announced with a broad grin. <br />
The entire group looked at her and Jake dumbfounded. &quot;Holy Shit this is so cool!&quot; Jake exclaimed, suddenly reaching up to his throat as his voice had deepened considerably and held a hint of a British accent. <br />
&quot;Me next, me next!&quot; Eliza squeeled like a giddy little girl wanting to go on a ride. <br />
&quot;What do you play as?&quot; Lara asked.<br />
&quot;I prefer the She-Elf,&quot; Eliza answered. <br />
&quot;Done,&quot; Lara replied snapping her fingers. Just as she did the changes came instantly. Eliza who looked to be of Arabic origins suddenly paled, her skin tone paling to nearly alabaster and her hair to gold. Her eyes became a sharp blue while her face and body thinned and stretched. She now stood five foot, eight inches, and slender. Her ears came to a point and her dress became white and satin. &quot;Well, what do you think?&quot; Lara asked, crossing her arms. <br />
&quot;I think you look beautiful,&quot; Jake declared.<br />
&quot;Well, I do but... I was kind of hoping for bigger...&quot; she refused to say, but motioned with her hands to her breasts. &quot;More curves I guess.&quot; As though automatic, no sooner had she uttered the words than her chest began to balloon. Her hips spread, thighs thickened, and ass bubbled out, drawing the gaze of the three males up and down her. &quot;This is great!&quot; Eliza squeeled as her boobs grew and grew and grew until they were H cups. &quot;Oh,&quot; Eliza sighed, lifting her breasts up with her arms. &quot;I love them. Suck it Jennifer, you big-titted bitch!&quot;<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;d be willing to suck them,&quot; Adam interjected nervously. Eliza grinned, looking down at the short lad with glee and cooing lustily.<br />
&quot;What would you normally play as?&quot; Lara asked, hoping to keep the transformations moving. <br />
&quot;I always choose the minotaur, but-&quot;<br />
&quot;Done,&quot; Lara snapped. <br />
No sooner had she done so than he began to grow, his muscles bulging and hair growing all across his body. Within moments he had grown to a full seven feet high and raw muscle. &quot;You didn&#39;t let me finish,&quot; he protested. &quot;I still wanted to be somewhat human.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, my mistake,&quot; Lara apologized, snapping her fingers again. Adam&#39;s bovine face retracted, reforming to appear human. While his hide remained dark, much of the hair receded. He seemed satisfied with this and so did the girls who stared at a rather sizeable bulge beneath his yet untorn boxers. <br />
&quot;Next.&quot;<br />
&quot;Centaur,&quot; Mary-Beth shouted. Once again Lara agreed and snapped her fingers. Mary-Beth groaned as her butt seemed to explode and a horse&#39;s body replaced everything from the waist down. To finish it out, Lara changed her ears to that of a horse, lengthened her hair to a main and inflated her bust to compete with Eliza&#39;s. <br />
&quot;Wow... centaurs are... really hot,&quot; Adam muttered, his erect member gaining an extra few inches of length. Mary-Beth giggled and turned around, her tail swishing to play a game of hide and seek with her ass. She gave him a playful wink to which he licked his lips.<br />
&quot;I play as a witch,&quot; Drew interjected. A sly smile crossed Lara&#39;s face.<br />
&quot;Unusual, but okay,&quot; she admitted before snapping her fingers. Drew began to change instantly, the fat seeming to melt away before migrating to his chest. <br />
&quot;Wait- no- but I-&quot; he sputtered, voice gaining octaves as he began to transition to a woman with long black hair, DDD breasts, an hourglass figure, and doll face. &quot;Whoa,&quot; he exclaimed, taking in his thoroughly feminine figure. &quot;Listen, I should have explained, there are male witches too,&quot; he stated, as though hoping Lara would change him. <br />
&quot;But damn, bro you look hot!&quot; Jake interjected. Drew stopped to take another look at himself, mostly his newfound tits.<br />
&quot;Damn, you right, you right. But... I kinda miss my...&quot; He suddenly stopped, a surge running through his gut as Lara re-endowed him with his lost manhood. He opened his witches leggings to confirm it was there but also noted a slit still present.<br />
&quot;The best of both worlds,&quot; Lara confirmed. <br />
&quot;Damn, if I don&#39;t feel sexy,&quot; Eliza exclaimed still hugging her boobs. &quot;I kind of want to test these out.&quot;<br />
&quot;You? Look at me!&quot; Adam exclaimed, ripping his boxers to shreds to show off his fourteen inch rod.<br />
&quot;Looks like he could use some release,&quot; Mary-Beth interjected, walking over gracefully in all her centaur glory. &quot;Think I&#39;m big enough to take him?&quot; she asked turning about. Her scent drifted to his nostrils giving him an additional two inches. <br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; he muttered before ramming himself into her. She shrieked before he began thrusting forcefully. From the outside, all could see his dick press and stretch her womb. <br />
Eliza took in the sight, sitting down to play with her massive tits. She heard a huff, looking over to see Jake stroking her engorged cock. They locked eyes. &quot;You want to?&quot; she asked the brave knight. <br />
&quot;Fuck yes,&quot; Jake replied, rolling over to her and ramming himself into her snatch. <br />
&quot;Play with my massive melons, Jake. Make them feel loved.&quot; He did as asked, grabbing them with his hands. They sank into the boobs like a hammer through jello. She squeeled with the sensitivity. <br />
Drew, unfortunately was left without a partner, sadly looking on as he tried to both stroke his member and rub his snatch.<br />
&quot;Hey Drew,&quot; Lara called, the hermaphrodite with looking towards her. &quot;Go to Mary-Beth&#39;s front. I think she has something for you.&quot;<br />
He did as was told only to find the centauress rubbing a newly formed vagina between her first pair of legs. She flashed Drew a demanding come hither look before he plunged into her. She moaned. &quot;Oh, oh, getting fucked at both ends by such massive studs. Oh, oh, yeah, oh suck it Jennifer you whore!&quot; she squeeled. <br />
I couldn&#39;t help it. On the one hand all of this was just too weird and on the other well... my hard on spoke volumes. <br />
&quot;Now do you believe me?&quot; Lara asked as she walked up and fingered my head. &quot;What do you want to do now?&quot; she cooed, lusty eyes boring into my brain.</p>
