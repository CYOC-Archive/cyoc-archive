<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the alarm sounded, Tom groaned. Groggily reaching for the alarm clock, Tom glanced at the time before sighing.<br />
<br />
The glowing red numbers said 6:15. In less than 3 hours, Tom would find himself starting his new job as an agent of S.P.E.A.R. Before that though, he needed to shower and have some coffee.<br />
<br />
As the warm water washed over him, the 24 year old thought of his unexpected journey to the secretive government agency. He graduated from college, became a police officer whose career was on the rise, then an unfortunate incident incident derailed everything. That is until Hailey Meyers approached him with a job opportunity.<br />
<br />
That opportunity translated into Tom solving a decades old cold case. Wyatt Tepes, one of the most powerful vampire lords within the vampire kingdom was cleared of assault charges. The vampire hadn&#39;t ordered the attack on the Moreland family, a dark wizard named Rick Morgan had. The ghost of Rick confessed to the crime, implicating Casseus, the CEO of New Horizon as an accomplice. While evidence linking Casseus was scant at best, the confession of Rick eased tensions between the Moreland and Tepes families. Wyatt was eternally grateful for S.P.E.A.R and Tom&#39;s actions and gave the young wizard a second chance at a promising career.<br />
<br />
Finishing his breakfast and pouring a thermos full of coffee, Tom appraised his appearance. Thankfully Hailey Meyers let Tom keep his beard, the young man neatly trimming it as he adjusted his tie. He couldn&#39;t help but smirk at his appearance. A dark suit, dark tie, yeah he definitely looked like a secret agent. It was going to take awhile to get used to this.<br />
<br />
Pulling into S.P.E.A.R&#39;s parking lot, Tom now studied the non-descript government building. Technically speaking, as far as the government and public at large was concerned, S.P.E.A.R didn&#39;t exist. Sure the various supernatural realms were aware of the agency, respecting their work, but humans? The less the human population knew about a secret government agency that dealt with the supernatural the better.<br />
<br />
As he entered the building, Tom could see a receptionist offer him a small wave and a smile. Tom reciprocated, studying the petite woman carefully. To the untrained eye, anyone looking at the young woman with brightly colored hair was just one of the many people who colored their hair in an attempt at rebellion. Young people of a certain political persuasion had done that for years. For Tom though, he was aware of who or more specifically what the woman was. She was a fairy.<br />
<br />
S.P.E.A.R was large employer for the supernatural realms, often employing numerous young members of the population. For Tom, who had grown up around these supernatural beings. He could quickly pick out who was human and who wasn&#39;t. There was always a small tell, something so subtle that most people would miss. Colored hair, eyes that seemed to have odd colors or shapes, teeth that were a bit sharper than normal, ears with a slight point, even small marks or tattoos on skin. All were indicators of someone&#39;s supernatural nature.<br />
<br />
Wanting to make a good impression, Tom now reached into his backpack, producing a small bag of candy mints. Sugary treats were always a favorite of fairy&#39;s. &quot;Tom Harris,&quot; he stated, handing off the candy bag. &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fairy receptionists eyes went wide, Tom could practically see the girls mouth water as she eyed the mints. &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; she said checking over her visiting list. &quot;The director mentioned you would be joining us full time. Are these for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Tom said. &quot;Know they&#39;re a favorite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d be right,&quot; the fairy said, quickly grabbing the bag. &quot;The name&#39;s Ja&#39;nella but everyone just calls me Jane. How did you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My aunt is married to one of the Morelands,&quot; Tom shrugged. &quot;Paid attention to everything my uncle Rick taught us. He always said I was a natural detective.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s nice to meet you Tom,&quot; Jane smiled. &quot;But next time, how about a caramel latte. To early in the morning for candy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind,&quot; Tom chuckled as he now made his way towards the elevator.<br />
<br />
Exiting onto fifth floor of the S.P.E.A.R office, Tom now studied his surroundings carefully. The building itself stood about ten stories tall. Not a tremendous height but enough to stick out. The majority of these floors were offices, cubicles stretching the length of the floor with small offices, a break room, and a few conference rooms. What only those who worked at S.P.E.A.R were aware of were the additional ten stories that descended underground. It was here that S.P.E.A.R&#39;s more secretive operations took place.<br />
<br />
Underground was where S.P.E.A.R held their medical bay, research labs, portal rooms, training areas, and holding cells. These areas could only be accessed by senior personnel, meaning Tom would only gain entry with permission from senior agents. For the time being, the young wizard would be confined to the office areas until he had put some time in.<br />
<br />
As Tom made his way through the the office, he could see Natalia MacGregor waiting for him, and small smile on her face. &quot;Good to see you Tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see you too Nat,&quot; Tom stated. &quot;So, are you my new boss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Nat chuckled. &quot;At least not yet. I&#39;m only a Senior Special Agent. Director Meyers just wanted me to meet you to give you the ten cent tour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Appreciate that,&quot; Tom said. &quot;But if you&#39;re not my boss, who is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Assistant Director Vermax,&quot; Nat replied, causing Tom to raise an eyebrow. &quot;Judging by that look you&#39;re confused. He&#39;s a silver dragon. Nice enough guy, personable, expects the agents under his supervision to be professional. When he heard you took the job, he insisted on you joining his team.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t realize I was a celebrity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you solved the Moreland case,&quot; Nat shrugged. &quot;And your personnel file indicates you have an inquisitive mind. Vermax appreciates brains over brawn, but don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to take it easy on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never asked for special treatment,&quot; Tom stated. &quot;Just looking to do the best job I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat smirked, opening the door to Vermax&#39;s office. As the pair entered, Tom noticed a well built man with silver hair and a beard and a mousy looking woman with cat eye glasses. &quot;A.D. Vermax,&quot; Nat stated. &quot;This is Tom Harris.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vermax grinned, extending his hand. As Tom shook it, he was taken aback by the iron grip of the man&#39;s hand. &quot;Tom Harris it&#39;s a pleasure,&quot; Vermax grinned. &quot;Your reputation proceeds you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I read up on your file,&quot; Vermax continued. &quot;Graduated with a 3.5, earned a Bachelors in Criminal Justice, ferromagnetic wizard, and a stellar record as a police officer until....&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom shifted slightly, obviously Vermax wanted an explanation for the incident that jeopardized his career. &quot;I had to make a judgment call sir,&quot; Tom stated. &quot;Used my magic to keep a suspect from harming my partner and the victim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Vermax replied. &quot;And while I appreciate you looking out for a partner, there are protocols to follow. I&#39;m guessing magic wasn&#39;t protocol in your department?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vermax grinned, his eyes twinkling as he studied the young wizard. &quot;Lucky for you Agent Harris, magic doesn&#39;t go against protocol at S.P.E.A.R. Still, I do expect my agents to follow agency guidelines. I don&#39;t have patience for hotshots. This that understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vermax nodded, motioning towards the mousy yet curvaceous brunette sitting in front of his desk. &quot;I&#39;d like to introduce you to your partner,&quot; he said. &quot;Special Agent Alexa Ross. Alexa has been with us for the last three years so don&#39;t let her youth fool you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom watched as the 25 year old brunette woman now stood, nervously pushing her glasses up as she offered him a polite wave. &quot;Pleasure to meet you Agent Harris.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom paused as he studied the woman. Alexa was shy, self conscious despite her attractive nature. As he looked into her eyes, her noticed they seemed a bit off. &quot;You&#39;re not human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C..correct,&quot; Alexa stammered. &quot;I&#39;m a nekomata but, how did you know? Was it the glasses? It&#39;s the glasses isn&#39;t it. Ugh, I thought cat eye glasses were clever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it&#39;s not that,&quot; Tom said quickly. &quot;It&#39;s your eyes. I&#39;ve had experience with the supernatural. Your eyes...they kind of remind me of the cat familiar that visits my sister all the the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we&#39;re done with the introductions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom and Alexa quieted, standing at attention as they gazed at the disguised dragon. &quot;Very good,&quot; Vermax stated, handing the duo a pair of folders. &quot;Inside you&#39;ll find your assignment. Familiarize yourself with the briefing before you depart at 1100 hours. Good luck agents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom nodded, turning to Alexa and noticing the stoic expression on her face. The nekomata seemed anxious, perhaps even nervous about the assignment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay partner?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just get a bit nervous when I go out into the field,&quot; she blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Alexa,&quot; Tom grinned. &quot;I got your back.&quot;<br />
<br />
At Tom&#39;s assurances, the nekomata seemed to relax. As the pair made their way towards their desks, Tom reviewed the mission briefing as he also tried to steady his nerves. Hopefully this first assignment with a new partner would go smoothly.</p>
