<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was left alone, feeling absolutely humiliated and terrified.  Her mind now turned attention to the fact that she was completely naked.  Looking herself over, she noted each of her breasts was about the size and shape of a ripe honeydew.  Gingerly, she hefted one of her fruits to get a feel for its size and texture.  Then she noticed her hands had changed somewhere along the line, her arms as well.  &quot;I probably never noticed myself changing when those assholes grabbed me and stuck me in here&quot; she thought.  Her slender green arms and fingers had taken on a vine-like appearance, the same thickness but no joints or bones appeared to be present as she tested the range of motion of her morphed appendages.  Her finger nails now appeared to be made of a thorn-like substance and came to an appropriate point. She reached up and touched her hair, it too had be come angel-hair thin vines though covered in a a silvery fuzz much like a pussy-willow would feel.  She thought to herself, there is no way I'm going to let this ruin my life. She thought of the benefits, being a plant could afford her.  No-more sunburns, no more need to worry about having to use the bathroom.  And its not like she was hideous, just different.  She still had a killer rack, belly hips and ass.  She also noticed she wouldn't need to shave anymore.  Sniffing the air around her she smelled faint sweet honeysuckle which on a sheepish self inspection she found to be coming from her.  &quot;Its not all so bad...&quot; she said to no one in particular.  Still, she needed to get out of the greenhouse and would love to find some clothes.  She began to rock her planter back and forth, her large breasts begging for a bra as they wobbled about, until finally she tipped over and fell onto the cold marble floor.  Her now throbbing chest let her know it was a poor decision and as she attempted to use her new arms to pull her forward she found that this new planter was too heavy to move.  she found herself unable to roll the planter over so that she could possibly remove some of the dirt and now was stuck face first on the ground.  That did it for poor Jennifer.  Her sweet tears poured down her cheeks onto the floor.  A few minutes later she felt someone gently tapping on her shoulder.  She looked up to see a young man looking down at her and recognized him as one of her assailants and promptly spit in his face.  &quot;JERK&quot; she cried.  &quot;Yeah, I know I know.&quot; he said.  &quot;I should have said something or stopped them but...well... I'm uh... sorry for what its worth&quot;  Jennifer's mind went back to Kyle and realized her situation.  &quot;No... its ok.. I've been a jerk around my friends too&quot; she whimpered.  &quot;Listen I should get you repotted and take you to your next class&quot; he offered as he gently stood her up.  She realized again her nudity and tried to cover up again feeling her blood rush to her face.  &quot;OH yeah, I brought you your backpack from the class before.  Thanks for volunteering to show us about plant-person anatomy back there.&quot;  She ripped the pack from his hands.  &quot;Could you turn around please?&quot;  His back turned to her she threw the skirt over her head realizing she couldn't wear underwear anymore and then fastened the clasps of her bra breathing a sigh of relief finally throwing on her blouse.  &quot;Ok, I'm decent again thanks&quot;  He turned around. &quot;Jenn you're way better than decent, you're the prettiest flower in our class&quot;  She replied.  &quot;Are you seriously trying to pick me up with a cheesy line like that after what you just did to me?&quot;  Though her face was turning red(green) and she did feel flattered by his compliment.  &quot;NO NO NO, I would never... I mean I'd... well, I mean.&quot;  &quot;Oh, so then I'm some sort of freak to you&quot;  she teased.  &quot;NO WAY!&quot; He burst out.  &quot;You're like the hottest girl in our class.  The green skin and the hair is a total turn-on for me, I've had a crush on you since we were freshmen.&quot;  His face blanched at what he had just blurted out.  &quot;You treat all your crushes like this?&quot; she said gesturing to the soil on the floor.  He looked at the floor, embarrassed.  &quot;Well, I guess you DID say you're sorry but I think you should have to take me out all the same.&quot;  He was cute she thought to himself, a strong athletic upper body.  Two arms that looked as strong as oaks and eyes like the bluest pools of water.  His hair was brown like the earth in her pot. &quot;I uhm&quot; *gulp*  &quot;So you'll pick me up after school today?&quot;  &quot;Yeah, sure!&quot; He said meekly.  &quot;You know you could have just asked me&quot; She said &quot; You're a hottie yourself, and the fact that you think I'm pretty doesn't hurt a bit.&quot;  He then proceeded to dig her out of the planter and repotted her with care into her old one.  &quot;I'm REALLY thirsty&quot; she said.  &quot;Its probably from all the transferring, sorry again.&quot; he offered. &quot;Its ok, but could you please get me a a drink?&quot;  he reached over and grabbed the watering can and began to pour into her pot.  Remembering herself, she began to cry again.  &quot;What's wrong!?&quot;  he asked.  &quot;NOTHING.&quot; she snapped &quot;I just wanted a drink, not to be watered like some... some... weed&quot; Jenn was clearly upset. &quot;Sorry! I thought you said this was how you drank in bio class&quot;.  He came back with a paper cup filled with water.  &quot;Thank you.&quot; she smiled half-heartedly.  Didn't you say you'd take me to class?&quot; She inquired, attempting to gain some control of her emotions.  He nodded, much befuddled, and began to wheel her to class.  &quot;My names Tyler by the way.&quot;  She got a minor scolding for being late to class although her mind was anywhere but on class at the time being.  Her mind was racing as she took in everything that had just happened to her.  &quot;What a strange day&quot; she thought, absent-mindedly stroking her fuzzy hair, her green eye's staring off into space&quot;  She noticed her shirt felt wet and much to her horror saw it small circles of sap forming over her nipples which were so taut they looked as though they might tear through even her loose blouse.  She looked desperately over to Becky, who finally looked over to her friend and saw her pleading eyes and excused themselves to the bathroom.  <br />
&quot;Holy cow Jenn, you're practically an adult, you should know how to hold your water by now&quot;  Becky chided.  &quot;ITS NOT MY FAULT!&quot; Jenn insisted vehemently.  &quot;If you hadn't drank so much you wouldn't be in this situation&quot; her friend  advised &quot;I know that you really love the way it feels but you need to control yourself Jenny.  Thankfully you'll have your pump back soon, but I have to think you're getting tired of wearing a boob diaper all day.&quot;  Jenn snapped out blurting &quot;I don't even know what you're taking about Becky!  I never asked to be like this, this is all new to me and everyone is acting like nothing has happened and this is completely normal, but I'm the ONLY fucking person in this school who is trapped inside a goddamn pot of soil&quot;  Becky replied.  &quot;We all know you're different Jenn, its old news to&quot; &quot;NO, its not old news&quot; Jenn interrupted.  &quot;I... changed... today in front of all of you and for a short period it seemed like no one could even see me even though I was completely naked and turning into a plant&quot; &quot;I'm scared Becky, what if I lose my mind and completely turn and disappear?&quot;  Becky stood silent for a minute.  She then hugged Jennifer.  &quot;I don't know what happened to you Jenn, but you're my friend and you've been a plant through all the years I've known you.  I don't think you're going to completely change, but no one knows for sure since you were genetically engineered, I know you get scared a lot, but your dad is a brilliant scientist, hes not going to let you get hurt.  So what do you mean you transformed today... this all seems normal to me but you are like, freaking out.&quot;  &quot;I don't know, it was almost like... MAGIC!&quot; Jenn's realization spread across her face.  &quot;OH MY GOD BECKY, ITS THE TOWN CURSE... SOMEONE CURSED ME&quot;  &quot;Everyone knows that the curse isn't real Jenn... you were genetically engineered in a lab, crossed between an egg from your mother and DNA from various plants as an attempt to form a genetic resistance to cancers but it didn't go quite right.  Too much plant DNA or something, I don't remember, you should know.&quot;  Becky looked concerned. Jenn countered &quot;That's just it, its like I have amnesia, I don't remember any of this stuff you're telling me but I remember my whole life as a normal human being. I remember how terrifying it was to start transforming.&quot; Becky tried to be helpful &quot;Well if you REALLY don't know anything about your life, you should talk to your dad when you get home and fill yourself in so you don't have to be embarrased like this...&quot; she said gesturing to her ample friend's soaked blouse.  Her dark green nipples jutting out invitingly.  &quot;Plus... you really should learn to control those pheromones of yours&quot; Becky hissed through clenched teeth.  &quot;Here, we should really get you out of that top, into a new one and back to class.&quot;  Becky offered.  Her hands gently unbuttoning Jenny's silky covering.  Her skin the colour of light ivy, Jenny's massive breasts were then freed from the confines of her bra again. Her sticky nectar glistening on her rounded mounds.  &quot;I'm spending so much of today topless&quot; she giggled to her friend. &quot;Thanks for helping me undress, but I can do it myself Beck... Beck&quot;  Jenny was clearly unaware of the effect she was having on her friend as the pheromones her friend had mentioned permeated the room.  &quot;Jenny, listen... when you get emotional like that, you can sometimes....nnnn.... release a hormone-like substance in the air... and it can make people... REALLY really... flustered mmmmmm.  You normally can control it, but I guess...&quot;  Becky's eyes were fixed on Jenny.  Her hands were slowly rising from the bottom button of Jenny's top towards her breasts.  &quot;oh, I don't know why I'm resisting this so much Jenn, I've always admired your boobs... I love the way they firm up when you're full of water and the color of your skin... those perfect lime green nipples...&quot;  &quot;Becky?&quot;  Becky's hand gently carressed Jenny's right breast.  &quot;They're so tight... you're really full.. how much did you absorb?  This can't be comfortable.&quot; Becky murred pulling in closer to her green companion.  &quot;Becky... you need to mmmmmm stop.&quot;  Jenn moaned, as her friend's touch sent thrills through her body.  her taut nipples still leaking her dew-like nectar.  They were way too full, that much she was sure of, maybe she should let her friend massage them just a bit.... to get some of the fluid out.  &quot;Jenn, you gotta control yourself please! We're at school... &quot; Becky struggled as she began massaging the green flesh with her soft feminine palms, now covered in Jenn's syrup. &quot;How?&quot; Jenn begged.  &quot;You told me its based on emotions... so try that.&quot;  Becky's lips were dangeriously close to Jenn's... she could feel her warm breath kissing her.  Jenn almost laughed when she heard her friend tell her to control her emotions... she was getting so hot.  Becky was a cheerleader too... and not at all unattractive.  Her perfect C-cup breasts sat pertly on her petite 5'5&quot; body and her natural blond hair was the envy of every girl in the school.  Worst of all she had the cutest face imaginable.  One of those girls who looked so innocent that you just had to ruin it... like a perfect sandcastle.  Jennifer struggled to control herself feeling her friends hands slowly remove themselves from her melons with a twinge of regret.  &quot;Good... job, Jenn&quot; her friend sighed.  &quot;Remember the first time that happened?  We had such a time explaining why we were both soaked to the principle. Can you believe she actually fell for 'we spilled a perfume bottle on ourselves'&quot;.  Becky laughed. &quot;Well you look emptied a bit now at least.&quot;  Sure enough her chest had become less swollen, looking youthful, but natural.  They had become softer and tenderly bobbled with Jenn's heavy breathing.  &quot;Yeah... thanks.&quot; Jenn dazedly said.  Her lower region was positively soaked as well... but thankfully her friend wouldn't be able to see it through her skirt.  Jenn quickly redressed and checked herself in the mirror before heading back to class.</p>
