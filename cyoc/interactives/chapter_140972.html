<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being situated in between the cleavage of a giantess proved to be more than Jordan could handle at her significantly smaller size. Not that she disliked the experience, rather the additional bouncing of Tina’s second set of breasts increased the amount of jiggling around her body. Tina made it down the block before Jordan called out for her to stop. “I think I would much rather have you hold me in one of your hands.” Tina shrugged, and gently reached inside her shirt to grasp Jordan’s six-inch form in her upper left hand. Using her two lower hands, she held the large piece of gummy candy.<br />
<br />
“You didn’t tell me why we needed to bring this thing along,” said Tina.<br />
<br />
“So that you can eat some more to shrink as well,” replied Jordan.<br />
<br />
Tina gave her friend an incredulous look before raising the gummy to her mouth. Before she was able to bite into it, Jordan quickly said, “It won’t shrink you as much as it did me. You’ll lose an inch with every bite.” Tina bit into the candy and absentmindedly chewed. It was not noticeable at first to Jordan, but she felt a slight shift in her position, and Tina’s hand appeared different around her form.<br />
<br />
They continued their trek down the sidewalk, passing by several houses. Tina ate more and more of the gummy which resulted in her shrinking down to a third of her starting height of five-foot-six. Her clothes appeared loose and baggy on her diminished form, and she lost her shoes two houses back. Her one free hand was what prevented her from losing her pants along the way. The gummy chunk was eaten down to half its size before Tina had trouble walking in her oversized pants. Fortunately, her now larger shirt could make up the difference by covering her lower region. Tina stepped out of her pants and continued walking. Jordan decided to help her friend out by declaring, “It’s a good thing you’re wearing that leotard that stays the same size as you no matter what.” <br />
<br />
The once baggy shirt readjusted itself into a new, form-fitting attire, and the bottom hem reformed to enclose around her legs, completely covering her nether region. “I know, right? I was told I was crazy for buying this, but it’s clearly paying off,” Tina said with a mouthful of candy. At her current height of three-foot-two, she could easily be mistaken for a child if not for her womanly figure and four massive breasts, which looked impressive on her smaller body. Even more so as they were packed inside her newly formed leotard.<br />
<br />
Tina did not have to walk much farther as the two were a block away from Frank’s home. Due to her reduced size, Jordan appeared much larger in her hand. Before they managed to reach their destination, the path was blocked by a trio of adolescents from the neighborhood.<br />
<br />
They were three young girls who seemed to pay no attention to Tina. Her shrinking brought her down to two-and-half-feet in height, which was significant compared to the towering teenagers before her. As she approached, the teens looked downward to the four-armed, four-breasted woman holding a doll-sized cat-woman in one of her hands while eating something orange and red.<br />
<br />
“Whatcha got there, short-stack?” One of the girls, a blond with freckles who wore tomboyish attire, asked.<br />
<br />
“Shrinking gummy,” Tina answered in earnest.<br />
<br />
“Why would you eat something that makes you shrink?” The brunette in the group asked, with a look of incredulousness on her face. She had her hair tied up in a tail behind her head and wore athletic clothing.<br />
<br />
“Because it’s surprisingly tasty,” said Tina. “Despite the obvious drawback.” She then held the gummy, which is now a quarter of its original size, up to the trio before her. “Want to try some?”<br />
<br />
The third, raven-haired girl in a blouse and mini-skirt scoffed, and said, “As if we want to be as small as that kitten in your hand.” She pointed to Jordan, who decided to chime in with, “Come on, girls. You wouldn’t mind being a little shorter.”<br />
<br />
The blond considered this for a moment and nodded her head in agreement. “Actually, you’re right. I could stand to lose a few inches.” Her two friends felt the same way. “Alright, shorty. Hand it over.”<br />
<br />
After grabbing what was left of the gummy from Tina, the blond girl broke the treat into three, baseball-sized pieces and shared them among the other two. Jordan then quickly added, “In fact, you three can swallow them whole with no problems.” As if on cue, each teen opened their mouths wider than humanly possible before stuffing their piece of gummy into them. Like watching a cartoon, all three girls effortlessly close their mouths around the gummies, which in turn distorted their faces. Jordan and Tina watched as the large lumps in the girls’ mouths moved down through their throats and into their chests as the gummies entered their stomachs. The shrinking effect of the gummy acted quickly on the three girls as they slowly descended where they stood. They initially stood between five-foot-two and five-foot-five and were now inching close to Tina’s height. Their clothes quickly becoming too large on their bodies and fell off, except for their shirts.<br />
<br />
The three teens were now below Tina’s current height before their dwindling slowed to a stop. The tallest, who was the blond, was eye-level with Tina’s chest, while her friends were a few inches below her. Bemused, the blond said, “This is more than I hoped for, but I’m not exactly upset.”<br />
<br />
“I think we look pretty damn cute like this,” said the raven-haired girl, who was admiring how her blouse fitted her smaller body like a dress.<br />
<br />
The brunette nodded in agreement, and said, “Yeah. But now this means my little sister is taller than me.”<br />
<br />
“You mean that seven-foot-eight girl with the hourglass figure over there is your little sister?” Jordan pointed passed the three girls, staring up at the giantess walking toward them. Everyone turned their attention to the large being as she stopped in front of them. From what Jordan could tell from her vantage point, this newcomer looked like a younger version of the brunette, but her figure was anything but young. In relation to her size, her natural curves appeared greatly exaggerated. Her clothes looked to be makeshift in design, being a tube-top that is stretched taut around large bulging breasts and short-shorts that could be mistaken for underpants. Apart from Jordan herself, who was insignificant compared to the brunette’s sister, Tina was as tall as her knees, and everyone else came up to her shins.<br />
<br />
“Oh my gosh,” exclaimed the giant. “How did you all get so small?”<br />
<br />
“We ate some shrinking gummies and ended up like this. Pretty neat, huh?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll say. You all look so cute!”<br />
<br />
“That’s what I said,” said the raven-haired girl.<br />
<br />
“But how long will it last, though,” asked the blond.<br />
<br />
Jordan responded with, “Oh, a few days. Maybe a week, tops.”<br />
<br />
“I suppose we’ll just to have to stick it out until then.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” started Jordan. “I’m sure your sister will take good care of you.”<br />
<br />
“You bet I will,” said the giant above them. She then knelt before all five shrunken young women and proceeded to gently scoop up her sister and her two friends in her arms. She then carried them off away from Tina and Jordan. The two then continued their trek to Frank’s home.</p>
