<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Five hours.<br />
Twenty nine minutes.<br />
Fifty six seconds.<br />
<br />
Luis took slow, shallow breaths from his perch at the top of the bleachers.  With each inhale however he felt he was only being tainted <br />
more by the sprawling jungle around him, the jungle these beasts called high school.  He released the air in an angry puff as he scribbled <br />
furiously in his strange little book.<br />
<br />
Five hours.<br />
Twenty nine minutes.<br />
Fifty three seconds.<br />
<br />
He counted down the time as he wrote.  Home was little better but it was quiet and calm, like a short reprieve while his invisible tormentor <br />
takes a break to piss.  Luis was a freshman, perhaps smaller and scrawniness than your average freshman and definitely weirder.  He <br />
lacked a crowd to call his own, being a bit of a social mutt.  He wore skinny jeans and scene shirts and bracelets but still never made it in <br />
with that crowd because of his general... creepiness.  He was dark and brooding and always writing god knows what.  He was an author <br />
who enjoyed writing dark shit but no one bothered to try to discover much beyond that or look into what made him this way.  Back at home <br />
he had nothing.  At sixteen his American mom fell for a Mexican man who made her feel special but when he was deported she was left <br />
with nothing but his child.  Now working around the clock to support Luis by herself she had bece bitter with him, projecting her hatred for <br />
his father on him whenever she was around.  Luis brushed his long dark locks from in frog of his eyes and kept writing, it was the only way <br />
to stay sane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sup emo-bitch what are you writing?&quot; The deep voice of David, one of the school's senior soccer jocks, made Luis look up in fear and <br />
loathing.  &quot;Gym isn't for your creepy faggot stories&quot; he mocked, ripping the book out of Luis's hands &quot;go do something normal for a <br />
change.&quot;. Luis just stared without saying a word.  David was the exact opposite of Luis.  He was built, handsome, popular and smart.  He <br />
came from a wealthy and loving family that has catered to his every need yet instead of making him a good person it's made him cold, <br />
condescending and given him a sense of entitlement.  He knows how to play the social game though, sucking up to those above him while <br />
stomping those beneath him, like Luis.  &quot;What kind of fucked up book is this anyway?&quot; David opened it to a random page.<br />
<br />
'and as the jock read from the book he stole he began to notice a hot breath on his neck and even though he knew he shouldn't he turned <br />
around anyway and what he saw...' David DID notice a breath on his neck, he turned back around to see what that faggot was doing <br />
breathing on him.  Two monstrous red eyes ripped into him and he beheld a beastly monster shrouded in black.  Terrified, David lost his <br />
balance and fell down the bleachers.  He felt every hit as he rag dolled down, his bones smashing against the wood and making horrible <br />
sounds until he finally landed in the court.  Nothing seemed broken but his legs were bleeding pretty badly and he was covered in bruises.  <br />
<br />
&quot;David!  What the hell is wrong with you?&quot; David cringed at the sound of the coach's voice.  &quot;Get your butt in the locker rooms and clean <br />
yourself up!  You have a game this Saturday so for gods sake try not to kill yourself.&quot; David tried to point out Luis in the bleachers, still <br />
stuttering from whatever he saw... But the bleachers were empty.  Trembling, David realized he was still holding the book.  He knew he <br />
should throw it away but something was keeping him from letting go of it.  Confused and in pain, David headed towards the locker rooms <br />
still carrying the book.  Once in the locker rooms David opened the book again, there had to be an explanation for what just happened.  <br />
He opened to the same page as the book described all the events that had just transpired.  David flipped back through the pages an saw <br />
they detailed everything that had happened to him today from the time he woke up.  Had that faggot been following him all day?  David <br />
turned ahead in the book to after the fall.<br />
<br />
'Confused, the jock turned to the book for answers but the book only tells him he's about to cut himself just as the kids he steps on do from <br />
his torment.  He doesn't believe this, he thinks he's reading total bullshit...' David dropped the book.  Cut himself?  Fuck that.  He walked <br />
over to the mirror to check on his injuries.  He turned on the water but hen he looke up he saw Luis' reflection instead of his.  It followed <br />
his every movement, smiling, frowning.  Then the face started laughing.  Luis's weird laugh rang out in the bathroom,  David looked <br />
around before clasping his neck and realizing the laughter came from him.  The reflection began contorting in unimaginable ways.  The <br />
already tan Latino skin darkened more an more to night black as the eyes rolled insanely and drew back further and further into their <br />
sockets.  The hair flew in an unseen wind as the visage turned ghastly. Great arms emerged from the mirror and grabbed David's, pulling <br />
them over the sink, palms up.  David couldn't move his arms, they were paralyzed.  The shadowy appendages meanwhile conjured razor <br />
blades which they slowly lowered onto David's wrists.  Pain exploded in him and he screamed, feeling his voice get higher and stranger as <br />
he began bleeding all over the sink.  He continued screaming in Luis's voice as the blades cut deeper and the blood flow increased.  The <br />
room began fading out and a dull ringing overwhelmed his sense until everything was black and silent...</p>
