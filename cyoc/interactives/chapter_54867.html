<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was getting hot again listening to Amy talk about how big her vagina was and that it could easily accommodate him now. His tongue slid out of him mouth as he licked his lips. Amy noticed that Mark's tongue was now more massive and thicker as he ran it around his lips. It was even able to reach up and brush his nose, leaving a slimy trail around his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark!&quot; Amy exclaimed. &quot;Your tongue...is huge!&quot; Such a large, slimy thing should have disgusted Amy but the stirring in her vagina screamed for Mark to stop licking his lips and get over there and start licking her awaiting cow genitalia. She had to keep fighting the urge though!<br />
<br />
Among Mark's changes, his nose had gotten a little larger and was beginning to darken to shade of black. He sniffed the air and looked over toward the bathroom where Amy had left her mark earlier. Mark peered into the bathroom and laughed with a hint of a snort.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might wanna work on your aim...&quot; Mark joked.<br />
<br />
Amy blushed but snapped back at him, &quot;Yeah well I shouldn't be used to having to pee like a cow, remember!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if it makes you feel any better, at least you made it to the bathroom...&quot; Mark replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that supposed to mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess you better watch where you step in the kitchen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh gross, Mark!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark's sniffing increased and he drifted toward the bathroom where the scent of Amy's pee was coming from. As he got to the doorway, he moved in lower, hunched over at first, but then got onto his knees and started crawling toward the toilet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mark, what are you doing?&quot; Amy snickered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know. It just smells good in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark! Don't...&quot; but before Amy could finish the sentence her expression turned to a cringe of disgust as she watched Mark's large bull tongue begin to lick Amy's sticky piss off of the rim of the toilet. His enlarged nose started to run a bit as strings of slimy saliva dangled between his tongue and toilet with each lick.<br />
<br />
As gross as it was to watch her boyfriend savor licking the remnants of her messy accident, Amy was starting to feel a tingling coming from her ass. She felt a strong desire overcome her and she started getting hotter. Sweat from her furry lower back ran down, around the base of her tail and into her butt crack, tickling her vagina.<br />
<br />
Amy thought to herself, &quot;Mark shouldn't be cleaning up my leftovers! He needs to be over here licking it fresh from my furry cunt! Exactly! That's what cows do! That's what I need!&quot;<br />
<br />
The horniness Amy was feeling was overwhelming her and she just couldn't control herself any longer. Her human reasoning normally would have never even allowed her to think about doing what she did next, but the musky scent coming from Mark as he licked up her piss off the bathroom floor pushed Amy over the edge and no matter how hard she fought it, the instincts of the cow she was becoming kicked in at that very moment. Her subconscious overcame her and without thinking about what she was doing, she bent herself over the bed, sticking her large, furry ass into the air and pointed it towards the bathroom door. But that's not what would later scare her the most - after all she was very horny...<br />
<br />
Human thoughts screamed at her, &quot;Amy! No! Don't do this!&quot; But her body was acting differently. She HAD to get Mark's attention! She swung her smooth, beautiful dark brown hair over her shoulder and looked back, past her well-presented ass, over to Mark. Her tail instinctively rose up in the air.<br />
<br />
Mark sensed something going on in the bedroom and his nose lifted from the floor to take in a whiff of the air. He looked back toward Amy and just as he saw the glistening folds of her cow genitalia pointed right at him, Amy muttered one word:<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then it happened.<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, without a single rational thought, as if she had done it a million times this way, a hot stream of sticky, yellow urine began pouring out of Amy's hairy vagina, splashing onto the off-white colored carpet Amy had worked so hard to keep clean from dirty shoes and wine stains. All that hard work, and she just let her smelly piss stream from her ass to splash down all over the carpet. Her body told her to push and the stream of urine just shot out further into the middle of the room. As the tingling of her piss running out of her ass subsided and the stream tapered off, Amy screamed at herself inside, &quot;What did I just do! Eww! Why...Why did I just do that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
But in the back of her mind she knew why. She had a feeling of accomplishment. She had just gotten Mark's undivided attention. Just like a cow would.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy, you just peed out of your ass!&quot; Mark said in a slightly shocked and confused manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I know.&quot; Amy was clearly embarrassed. Tears started to well up in her eyes. &quot;I didn't mean to. Something just told me to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your ass smells wonderful!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Don't Mark!&quot; Amy's humanity tried to fight back, but it was futile. She had sprayed piss all over the room because she wanted Mark to do exactly what he was moving towards her to do.<br />
<br />
He quickly grabbed her furry hips, drinking in the wonderful aroma coming from her ass. He rammed his face into her ass and started licking it up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark! Stop it! Oooooooh God....!&quot; The heat within Amy was becoming overwhelming. Musky sweat clung to her hot body and the bedroom began to fill with an animalistic stench. Between Amy and Mark's sweat-soaked fur and Amy's smelly urine drying all over the carpet and bathroom floor, it was beginning to smell slightly like a barnyard.<br />
<br />
Unaware of the effect her horniness was having over her, Amy didn't notice how her short, white fur spread down her legs and over her calves as well as up her back from her already hairy ass that Mark was aggressively seeing to.<br />
<br />
He grabbed both of her furry butt cheeks and spread them apart even further to get better access to her vagina and anus and then rammed his nose and mouth back into Amy's damp crevice. Mark's large, bullish tongue coated the already seeping leathery black folds of her vagina and with each lick, a slimy string of saliva and snot dripped into Amy's exposed butt crack and ran down Mark's face, hanging from his chin. His blackening nose was getting larger as he lubricated his wife.<br />
<br />
Mark sensed that she was almost ready and Amy felt it too. In Amy's mind, her thoughts fought through the pleasure as her sensibility tried to kick in. She knew what she and Mark were doing was wrong, but their changing instincts were just so overwhelming.<br />
<br />
Getting pregnant would be a big mistake and Amy knew it. She had to try to fight the urges off, but could she?</p>
