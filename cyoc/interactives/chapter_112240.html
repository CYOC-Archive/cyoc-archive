<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the press conference over, Samantha Twist went back to her office as Mayor of Moon Lake. Alone, she sat behind the desk and stared at the picture of her life mate. <i>Frances honey, I hope you&#39;re all right. It would have been nice to have you by my side when I announced my candidacy, but you&#39;re dealing with something much bigger than me formally declaring my campaign for mayor.</i><br />
Then Samantha looked at the mountain of paperwork on her desk, checked her calendar, and made a decision.<br />
<i>Frances needs me more than the town does right now,</i> Samantha realized, hastily stuffing everything she had to do into her briefcase. <i>A quick trip to the grocery store, a quiet dinner for two, and a nice romantic soak in the tub afterward. Or at least a sympathetic ear and a lot of cuddling,</i> she realized, before locking up her office and leaving, after giving her secretary Suzy the rest of the day off.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Why do you keep looking at your phone sis?&quot; wondered Samson Carter. &quot;You already said that if you don&#39;t make it, you&#39;ve already made arrangements to reschedule that 4 pm client.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that. It&#39;s just that Samantha was expecting me for something important before finding out about mom came up,&quot; explained Doctor Frances Twist.<br />
She and her (somewhat estranged) family were having lunch at Grrrrrrr, the weres only restaurant, to attempt dealing with the news that Angelica Carter (Frances and Samson&#39;s mother) had untreatable pancreatic cancer.<br />
&quot;And how is... that woman,&quot; said Joseph Carter, biting his tongue to keep from expressing a more personal opinion of Frances&#39; wife.<br />
&quot;My wife is doing just fine,&quot; replied Frances, feeling one brief moment of joy in an otherwise dismal meal. &quot;In fact, since she&#39;s probably made it public by now, it&#39;s safe to tell you that Samantha has decided to formally run for mayor of Moon Lake, instead of just serving out what&#39;s left of Martin Stovall&#39;s term.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said Samson, surprised at hearing the news. &quot;She was on the fence and undecided about the matter for so long... But I&#39;m glad she decided to run. Samantha certainly has my vote.&quot;<br />
&quot;I...&quot; began Joseph Carter, and then caught the sad expression upon his weredog wife&#39;s muzzle. &quot;I shall weigh the issues and the merits of the ballot before casting my vote in November,&quot; he finally said. &quot;Besides, our Mayor Pro-tem is unopposed at the moment, so if that doesn&#39;t change, all she has to do is vote for herself and be declared the winner,&quot; he pointed out.<br />
&quot;Well, the filing deadline to run for any office in Moon Lake is noon Tuesday, so we&#39;ll see how it goes,&quot; replied Frances, not taking any of the tainted bait her father was offering, for it would only lead into another argument between them, which was the last thing her mother needed right now.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
&quot;Promise them anything you have to, as long as it&#39;s never officially on any record. Then we can always deny their claims later since they won&#39;t be able to prove them, but I want that project finished by the end of this month or you&#39;re finished!&quot; vowed Jack Crawford before angrily hanging up the phone.<br />
<i>Whoever said it was lonely at the top wasn&#39;t kidding,</i> he realized, looking over his agenda to see what was next.<br />
But a knock on the door of his private office within the penthouse suite he maintained in Seattle kept him from making his next business call as his wife Kenya Adaeze-Crawford came sauntering in. The newlywed bride was in her werepanthress fursona, gracefully slinking toward him, her tail and hips swaying seductively as she approached him.<br />
&quot;Will you be much longer?&quot; Kenya asked him. &quot;I&#39;m getting lonely and would <i>really</i> like some company,&quot; she mewed.<br />
<i>What you mean is your horny again and want a good rutting,</i> thought Jack as he smiled at her. &quot;Few more calls, then I&#39;m all yours till we leave for Moon Lake Monday morning. But you have to be more careful when you sashay around here in your fursona,&quot; he warned her.<br />
&quot;Why? You said the windows were made of special glass. We can see out but no one can see in,&quot; Kenya reminded him, as she leaned forward to make sure her husband got a good look at her impressive cleavage and their hard nipples.<br />
&quot;True, but what if I was in the middle of a teleconference on the computer?&quot; asked Jack, pointing out he was still fully dressed and in his human form, instead of displaying his own inner werepanther.<br />
Kenya realized he was right, but before she could admit it, Jack&#39;s private cellphone rang.<br />
<br />
Picking it up off his desk top and seeing who Caller ID said it was on the other end, Jack answered it and said, &quot;What&#39;s up Riley?&quot;<br />
&quot;I doubt it will make the news up there, but something&#39;s happened here that you should know about boss,&quot; said his informant, a local wererat on the Crawford payroll to keep his employer apprised of events in Moon Lake.<br />
&quot;Oh? What?&quot; asked Jack Crawford, even as his wife sat on the corner of his desk and tried to look even more sexy than she already did.<br />
&quot;Samantha Twist just announce her candidacy for Mayor,&quot; revealed Riley.<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; exclaimed Jack, which startled Kenya to the point where she almost fell off the desk.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Named Martin Stovall her campaign manager too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Did she say why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just the usual song and dance about doing a good job and wanting to continue with the people&#39;s blessing,&quot; explained Riley.<br />
&quot;Nothing about our plans for Monday, huh?&quot; asked Jack, thinking things over. &quot;The fact that she did decide to run after all wasn&#39;t totally against the odds, but as a long shot, one has to question the timing. Could they be on to what I have planned?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see how,&quot; replied his informant, knowing about his employer&#39;s plans to have his wife run for office. &quot;But everyone I&#39;ve managed to talk to have no problem with the idea of Twist continuing as mayor.&quot;<br />
&quot;Damn. Doesn&#39;t help our case, but in the long run it won&#39;t hurt it either,&quot; conceded Crawford. &quot;Okay Riley. Continue getting everything ready for Kenya&#39;s political debut Monday, and if anything else happens before then, call me immediately.&quot;<br />
&quot;Will do boss,&quot; promised the wererat, before hanging up.<br />
<br />
Jack Crawford sat and thought things over.<br />
<i>Martin Stovall is a seasoned veteran when it comes to politics, so he&#39;ll be hard to outfox. Unfortunately, being the were-mer rep on the Elders&#39; Council, I can&#39;t do anything to get Stovall out of the game even temporarily. Yet with his wife&#39;s impeding birth to twins, he&#39;ll at least be distracted, if not outright sidelined for a while when the babies come,</i> he realized. <i>With her inexperience, Twist shouldn&#39;t be a problem, but my wife&#39;s never been in politics before herself. The real issue will be building up a good platform for Kenya to win the election on.</i><br />
So distracted with his own plans, it wasn&#39;t until he felt a wet tongue licking his penis that Jack Crawford realized that the lower half of his body was exposed, let alone where his wife was.<br />
&quot;Should I even bother to ask?&quot; he asked Kenya, looking down to see the werepanthress between his legs. His pants had been undone and opened as much as they could be while he was seated, but his wife was taking full advantage of the situation.<br />
&quot;You say that sex is great stress relief, and after what I heard of that phone call...&quot; explained Kenya.<br />
Jack leaned back in his chair and started undoing his tie as his wife went back to orally pleasuring him.<br />
&quot;You know, maybe it&#39;s time for a good rut after all,&quot; he said with a smile.<br />
As soon as he was undressed, Jack planned to release his inner werepanther and show his mate who the true &quot;king of the jungle&quot; really was.</p>
