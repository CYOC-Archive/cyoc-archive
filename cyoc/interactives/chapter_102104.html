<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Eric sat there, enjoying pasta and meat sauce with Cassie O&#39;Sullivan and her mother, the three of them continued to chat.<br />
Anna O&#39;Sullivan regaled them with tales of life as a vet in the Seattle Zoo.<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t the other animals react to your presence, being a werewolf?&quot; he wondered.<br />
&quot;Some. Just the ones that would be worried about losing prey to a wolf, or becoming a wolf&#39;s next dinner in the natural animal kingdom,&quot; replied Anna. &quot;Also being a human seems to throw some of them off to the point where they don&#39;t know how to react around me, and those that wouldn&#39;t be bothered by a wolf nearby to begin with never show any signs of stress at all, although none of them like where the thermometer usually goes,&quot; she said jokingly with a wink.<br />
Having heard that joke before, Cassie just rolled her eyes and kept from groaning, while Eric actually giggled. Then Anna got Eric to open up more about his desire to be a police officer, which led him to becoming a werewolf.<br />
&quot;Once I got adjusted to Moon Lake, I never really had any problem with the basic idea of possibly become a were; but when, what, and why were always questions I couldn&#39;t answer until my dad was killed. My older brother Nate went wolf the moment he found out he could when Samantha Twist said one of us had to become the family were to comply with Moon Lake law, because he&#39;s always had lupine dreams and fantasies ever since he was a little kid.&quot; Not mentioning her bi nature or their marital troubles before then, he added, &quot;Mom became a werecat after my dad was involuntarily turned, because she would need to become a were herself if she ever wanted to have more... mature relations with him again.&quot; Eric found himself blushing thinking about sex, because that immediately led to new thoughts of him and Cassie together, and in more ways than just intimately.<br />
&quot;And after my father was killed and I finally started coming to terms with it, that was when I decided I not only wanted to become a police man after I graduated high school, that it would also be helpful to be a were to better serve Moon Lake, which led to my eventual decision of becoming a werewolf.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see. No college?&quot; asked Anna.<br />
&quot;I once thought of being a scientist or astronaut, but now I&#39;ll be going to Moon Lake College after high school for whatever&#39;s applicable for a career in law enforcement before I enter the police academy,&quot; said Eric.<br />
&quot;Well, my Cassie wants to be a doctor after high school. She&#39;s been reading all kinds of books on the subject, and the only good thing that came out of my husband&#39;s passing was the fact that the drunk that killed him was rich, so our lawyer sued the pants off him! I&#39;d trade it all to have George back, but at least there&#39;s enough in the bank now so that Cassie&#39;s higher education is completely covered,&quot; revealed her mother. <i>Technically, if I didn&#39;t love my job so much, I wouldn&#39;t have to work either, but that doesn&#39;t matter right now.</i><br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve yet to find a reason to discuss such things with my mom, but I&#39;ll do whatever it takes, within reason, to make my dreams come true,&quot; vowed Eric.<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; replied Anna. &quot;Now then. First off, Cassie&#39;s birthday is next weekend, so you&#39;re more than welcome to come to her party next Saturday afternoon if you&#39;d like.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you. I will,&quot; said Eric, thinking of the thought of spending more time with her.<br />
&quot;Now, if I may ask, what are your intentions towards my daughter?&quot; to which she heard an audible gulp from both children as they stared wide eyed at her.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
<i>Where is MY Eric?</i> wondered Julie Stovall, laying in her hospital bed, staring frustrated at the ceiling. <i>Surely he would have come to visit me by now? I&#39;d be out looking for him if I wasn&#39;t so tired and still restrained to this bed for some stupid reason. Why won&#39;t they tell me anything. Unless...</i><br />
But outside her room, there were others discussing her situation as well.<br />
&quot;I still don&#39;t understand it,&quot; said Doctor Tora Tachibana, addressing her parents. &quot;Technically, your daughter&#39;s vital signs have stabilized, but they&#39;re still well below that of a normal 14 year old girl, let alone those of your average 14 year old were-mermaid. Yet, letting her see Eric Anderson didn&#39;t help because she no longer recognizes him since he&#39;s become a werewolf.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is there anything we can do doctor?&quot; pleaded her mother.<br />
But before he could answer, everyone heard Julie scream.<br />
The three of them rushed into the room to see Julie crying and shouting at them. &quot;I just figured it out, but is it true? Is the reason MY Eric has yet to come see me because he&#39;s dead? Or is he in another room here in the ICU wing? ERIC! <b>ERIC!</b>&quot; shouted Julie, as her parents tried to restrain her while Doctor Tachibana ordered a new sedative for the patient.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Nate Anderson and his boyfriend Alex Ramsey were having a nice, romantic dinner at the local diner; or so Nate thought, until Alex once more brought up the one subject he didn&#39;t want to discuss.<br />
&quot;So stud, when are you going to tell your mother about us?&quot;<br />
&quot;Look handsome,&quot; began Nate, using his pet name for Alex, &quot;it isn&#39;t that easy. Especially since my father&#39;s death. Mom&#39;s still on egg shells at times as it is. But as far as the rest of Moon Lake and the world is concerned, I&#39;m out and proud of it. Even my little brother Eric knows about us.&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand all that, but better to hear it first hand from you now than second hand from someone else later, and upset her even more. Besides, at the rate you&#39;re going, you&#39;re mom might not find out until our wedding day.&quot;<br />
&quot;W-w-wedding day?&quot; asked Nate, nervously.<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; began Alex, while reaching out to hold Nate&#39;s hands in his, &quot;I already have some VERY strong feelings for you and someday, one of us is going to work up the courage to propose to the other. Yet, whether I become Mister Alexander Anderson or you become Nathaniel Ramsey, I think it&#39;d be nice to have your mother&#39;s blessing <i>before</i> we say &#39;I do&#39;.&quot;<br />
Nate thought long and hard about that. Even after realizing that he preferred men to women, Nate had stayed hidden until after moving to Moon Lake. Alex had not only ushered him into werewolf society, but had taken Nate&#39;s virginity and was the only one he had ever experienced sexual relations, let alone love with. The older Anderson boy was also reaching the point where he couldn&#39;t picture anyone else in his life but the one before him, yet what Alex was asking was still a big step.<br />
<i>Yet, what have I been afraid of?</i> wondered Nate. <i>Dad? Rejection? Discovering mom&#39;s bi was a big shock, yet she of all people should understand.</i><br />
&quot;Okay. If you agree to be with me, I&#39;ll do it tomorrow,&quot; promised Nate.<br />
Alex just simply smiled as he leaned forward to kiss his boyfriend.<br />
<br />

AFTERWARD: DIMENSIONAL DIFFERENCES<br />
The traumatic shock of losing his father prevented the Eric Anderson of Earth-3 from forming the emotional bonds and attachments that would have eventually led to declaring his love and consummating his relationship with Julie Stovall, ushering him into were-mer society in the process; like his counterpart in the Moon Lake of Earth-1 recently did.—tmw.</p>
