<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie spent the rest of the day frantically searching for Katie, Samantha’s words echoing through her mind. In her quest to have what she lost she had pushed too hard to bring everyone together, not taking into account how much things had changed, or how different everyone was.<br />
<br />
The whole Mary Elise and Lisa thing had shocked Kellie to the core. She had believed that Lisa was bullying Mary, keeping the girl from forgiving Claudia and bringing everyone together. What Kellie had not realized is that due to things beyond Kellies control Mary Elise had changed. The levelheaded, friendly girl Kellie had known and loved was gone. In her place was a twisted, dark, version that relished misery and pain. Kellie had not realized that, although Lisa was rebellious, she was still a good person. Lisa had been protecting the others from Mary. She had seen what kind of person Mary was, Kellie cursed herself for not having more faith. Lisa had always been a fantastic judge of character.<br />
<br />
As the final bell rang Kellie still had not located Katie. She had briefly seen Lisa, however when the girl saw her she turn and went quickly in the other direction. Kellies heart broke as she saw the look of adject dispair on Lisa’s face. Kellie had crushed the girl and destroyed her based on a theory. The confident look Lisa usually carried was gone, now instead was a frightened girl fearful of what Kellie could take from her.<br />
<br />
Sighing sadly Kellie slowly made her way towards her car. Samantha and Claudia were thankfully more forgiving of Kellies actions than she was. The two realized that Mary Elise had fooled them all, they kept trying to reassure Kellie they would of acted similar if they were in her shoes. While Kellie thanked them for the support it didn’t stop her from feeling guilty.<br />
<br />
As Kellie pulled into her driveway she rubbed her eyes staring sadly at Katie and Lisa’s home. Wiping her eyes she slowly made her way inside. “Hello Kellie how was school,” Merlin asked as he looked up from his work. Kellie looked on the verge of tears, causing the old wizard to make his way to his feet. “What happened,” he said, a look of concern crossing his ancient face. Kellie began to cry softly causing Merlin to now hug the girl tightly.<br />
<br />
“I screwed up bad,” she cried. “I....I was so desperate to get everyone back together that I was willing to believe the worse about Lisa. I....I...ruined everything.”<br />
<br />
Kellies cries became harder as Merlin now tried to soothe his Young apprentice. “Shhh,” he whispered running his hands through Kellies honey blond hair. “Kellie it’s okay. I know you tried your best, we learn from our mistakes.  Whatever happens always know that I believe in you.”<br />
<br />
Kellie was beginning to feel better as she felt Merlin’s warmth wash over her. While not related the man was the closest thing she had to an actual father. The two had been through so much over the years that the bond they shared had grown from friendship to a father and  daughter bond. “Thanks,” she sniffed. “You always know how to make me feel better.”<br />
<br />
“It’s what I do,” he smiled.<br />
<br />
Kellie wiped her eyes as she looked up at her mentor. “I need to go and talk with Katie now,” she said flatly. “I have to apologize now before things get worse.” Merlin nodded in response as he watched Kellie march towards the door. Turning Kellie smiled at Merlin before grabbing the door and flinging it open. As she tried to step outside she felt a hand grasp her around the throat. “Katie,” Kellie gasped as her former girlfriends fingers closed around her.<br />
<br />
Katie stared malevolently at Kellie as she squeezed for everything she was worth. “What did you do to my sister,” she snarled. Kellie tried to croak out an answer as she felt Katie’s grip become vice like. “Ka...” she choked feeling herself struggling for breath. Katie wouldn’t let her answer as she angrily slammed Kellie against the wall. <br />
<br />
Kellies head was spinning as she looked at Katie. She now understood what everyone was talking about when they said you didn’t mess with Katie. The blond girl had a look of righteous fury on her face as her hazel eyes burned with fury. Kellie watched as she balled her free hand into a fist, the ring on her finger glowing white hot.<br />
<br />
“Release her,” Merlin screamed as he tried tin rush toward some Kellie. “Stay out of this,” Katie screamed as she glared at Kellie. Kellie and Merlin were shocked by the power emanating from Katie. When the girl had screamed it had caused the entire house to shake. Merlin stumbled as he gazed at the girl. The ring on her finger, while like Kellies, also seemed to amplify any latent magic within her. As a result Katie appeared to be in possession of some very powerful chaos magic.<br />
<br />
“Katie please,” Kellie croaked. “I’m sorry let me explain.”<br />
<br />
Katie glared at the two of them before slowly releasing her grip. Kellie now collapsed to the ground gasping for breath. “Talk,” Katie spat. “And make it quick before I use this ring to do to you what you were thinking of dong to Lisa.”<br />
<br />
“What did Lisa tell you,” Merlin asked as he glared at Katie. “Lisa didn’t tell me anything she’s too shaken to say a word,” Katie said bitterly. “But Mary says you not only attacked her but threatened her that ring of yours.”<br />
<br />
“Damn her,” Kellie thought. Sighing Kellie slowly made her way to her feet. Rubbing her neck she could feel some tenderness around her throat, she would most likely have an ugly bruise by tomorrow. “Okay I’ll talk,” Kellie mumbled. “Please sit, theirs so much to say and well its going to come as a bit of a shock.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she made her way into the living room. Sitting in an easy chair she now angrily stared at Kellie and  Merlin. “Katie,” Meelin said angrily. “Kellie I said willing to talk with you and share some information that will be quite extraordinary. However, if you attack her again you will feel my wrath.”<br />
<br />
“She attacked my sister,” Katie snarled. “And no one touches my family. I don’t fear you old man or her. This ring has a lot more power than you would think. If you’re straight with me we’re okay. But theirs one thing. If either of you ever do anything to Lisa you will have to deal with me.”<br />
<br />
“Agreed,” Kellie stated. “I’m sorry about what happened with Lisa. I’ll explain what happened. I...I’ll tell you everything.”</p>
