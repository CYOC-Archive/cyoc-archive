<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;... my clone servant. Perfectly obedient, and able to act just like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Jeff bellowed bolting for his room. His voice had dropped an octave already.<br />
<br />
&quot;As soon as your free will is gone, report back to me.&quot; Dad called with a mirthful cadence in his voice.<br />
<br />
About 5 steps from his Sister-Chair and Jeff fell to the ground, though his shirt was simply tight, his pants were way to small for his suddenly adult frame. &quot;Gah, NO! Fuck you dad!&quot; Jeff roared in anger and fear but he couldn&#39;t move effectively without first dealing with his trapped legs. Jeff felt his body changing and knew his time was short, he just needed to stop or even pause the transformation so he could maintain his free will...<br />
<br />
Dad stepped into the hallway watching his son struggle with a huge grin on his face. &quot;Silly me, I told the machine to change your clothing AFTER your body finishes, you know, the same time your free will is repressed. Oh, and you&#39;re aging about a year each second and it looks like you&#39;re about to hit your 30&#39;s, or should I say, my 30&#39;s...&quot; Dad chuckled at his own joke. &quot;15...14...13...&quot; Dad walked back into the kitchen as Jeff struggled to get his larger foot out of the much too small pants leg.<br />
<br />
Jeff was entering a panic, the task became more and more difficult as he shifted from lean to a dad bod physique following his father&#39;s progression. Maybe he could hop? He might fall, but a slight injury is better than being a slave in your own body right? With a yank one leg was finally free, it had to be enough! With a heavy grunt Jeff raised himself off the floor and carried the loose pant leg, he raced up the stairs stopping half way up at which point his pants rewove themselves into nice dress slacks and his hoodie became a white button down shirt complete with tie. His body turned around and returned to the kitchen, &quot;Reporting to you as requested, Dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad had the biggest grin on his face. &quot;Have a seat Jeff, let&#39;s have a chat. First off, nobody in this house gets off to my wife except me. This is your punishment for that and eventually I&#39;ll work on forgiving you. Now let me set some ground rules, First, you are to act like me at all times. Your body will do this on autopilot, I simply had to state the command. Should someone other than the three of us be here, you are to pretend you don&#39;t exist and do what you can to maintain the ruse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff got up and began walking toward the stairwell. &quot;What? Stop! What are you doing?&quot; Dad cried in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s more than just you me and mom here so I&#39;m pretending I don&#39;t exist.&quot; Jeff replied calmly, betraying the inner turmoil he was feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who else is here Jeff?&quot; The question was dripping with venom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily, my sister is here.&quot; Jeff replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your what now?&quot; After much back and forth the full story came out, and it continued into what possessed Jeff to turn his mother into a poster and the rules were changed to disregard Emily until she is human again. The rules continued that Jeff was to turn down any of his mother&#39;s advances, not think about her sexually, and use of the Chronivac on himself was strictly prohibited. (Though Jeff wanted to use it on his father, he has to act the way his father would so that isn&#39;t an option, and circumventing his punishment isn&#39;t an option either.) Jeff was then given a laundry list of chores starting with dinner preparation and escalating from there. <br />
<br />
Jeff worked diligently, and when dinner was ready he sat at the head of the table, greeted his wife with a peck on the cheek and greeted his father in one of the ways his father has greeted himself in the past, &quot;You&#39;ve got this man!&quot; It took a moment to click and while not quite what was intended it did get a chuckle from Dad. That and several other affirmations were reserved for rare days or events that promised to be more stressful than normal. So he would look in the mirror, and greet himself with a sincere pick me up. So technically, this was how dad greeted himself, therefore...<br />
<br />
Although Jeff didn&#39;t have to think about the tasks, it was still his body and he felt tired from the day his new body had at work, the unexpected level of physical exertion fighting with tiny pants during transformation, the heat from cooking, and sore from now being in his mid forties.<br />
<br />
While Jeff was doing chores his dad was having sex with his mother. During dinner Jeff was told that he was going to cover work while his dad tries to figure out how to make his wife less of a bimbo, figure out how to re-add his sister to the family, and figure out a better punishment for Jeff.</p>
