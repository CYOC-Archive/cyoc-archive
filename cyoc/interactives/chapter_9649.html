<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Mendes finished off his extra large milkshake with a contented huff.  The boys grinned at each other somewhat deviously.  He had always ordered and extra large, it seemed to be a weakness, and after a few years of it, Mr. Mendes had become a little soft around his waist.  He perked back up and looked at the boys &quot;If you two are done eating, we can head home.&quot;  The boys nodded in unison.  Francisco moved his tray to the garbage and opened the door to the boys.<br />
--------------------<br />
  Francisco planned a nice calm night at home, but the boys were hyper.  He didn't know what was so entertaining in that book they had.  Then the phone rang.  A call came from the kitchen &quot;Ric, it's for you!&quot;  Ric dropped the book and ran to the phone.  &quot;Hey Josh, it's Alex, he wants us to come over for the night!&quot;  Josh ran into the kitchen and looked up to Mr. Mendes, asking please without even speaking.  Francisco rolled his eyes &quot; Okay, you can go.&quot;  he said.  The boys cheered &quot;Now go get ready.  The boys hung up the phone and ran to their rooms.  Francisco sat on the couch and picked up the book on the coffee table.  He placed it in the drawer in front of him.  &quot;I've told those boys not to leave these dirty things on the tables.&quot; <br />
  The boys ran down the stairs with a schoolbag each, and Mr. Mendes got up.  &quot;Come on, I'll drive you.&quot;  He walked outside to the car.  The boys looked around for a second, looking for their book.... but it was gone.  &quot;Oh no, where's the book?&quot;  Josh asked.  Ric looked aorund the room frantically, before Josh spoke up again.  &quot;I'll go ask Mr. Mendes where it is.&quot;  Ric tackled him &quot;No!  We can't talk to him about the book, he shouldn't even know about it.  Let's just go, if we can't find it, he probably won't either.&quot;  With that, the boys walked back out to the car. <br />
-----------------<br />
  At last, there was peace.  Mr. Mendes thought as he came back into the house.  He walked up his stairs, and into the bathroom.  He stripped down and got ready to take a shower.  He studied his body in the bathroom mirror, his tight chest and defined arms.... and his soft midsection.  He poked it, thinking that he had to work it off.  &quot;Good thing I'm big all over.&quot;  He said outloud, patting his cock.  It bounced back and forth on his groin, all 9 inches of it swaying.  He positioned his bulky member over the toilet and began to piss.  Unbeknownst to him, something was happening.  His dick began to shrink, becoming younger as he emptied.  His bladdered poured it's contents into the porceilin bowl and his dick shrank by an inch and a half.  He shook his seven and a half inches without a thought and began to get hard.  Blood flowed into his member stiffening it bit by bit until it finally stood at &quot;full&quot; strength.<br />
<br />
  As usual, he reached down and began to grip it, noticing something was wrong.  He looked down to see his hard dick, just slightly longer than its usual 9 inches.  He walked out into his room quickly.  He picked up a measuring tape from his drawing board and measured.  &quot;9.75 inches.... what the hell?&quot;  He knew that his usual erection was around 12 inches.  &quot;It must be cold or something in here tonight.  I'm sure it's nothing....  Just in case...&quot;  He picked up the measuring tape and walked into the bathroom with his erection.  He sat on the toilet, thinking it's better to not waste a good thing, no matter how small it was.  He gripped it with one hand and began to pump, finding it extremely pleasureable.  It was so hard, it hadn't been like this in years... not since he was in his twenties at least.  As he stroked he noticed what was happening.<br />
<br />
  As his hand pumped up and down the shaft, he saw his penis shrinking more and more.  It became less vascular and the hairs on his groin were retracting.  His other hand flew down to his balls to find them growing smaller as well.  Francisco tried to stop, but something was keeping him going.  His dick was getting smaller and smaller, and his groin was almost hairless and suddenly, he orgasmed.... but nothing came out.  He looked at his erection in horror... it stood firm at 4 inches.  It looked like it did when he was 12 years old.  He felt his balls, noticing that his sack had become tight and pulled his shrunken balls up into his body.  Then, once more, he needed to go to the bathroom.  He did it in a daze, looking at his erection as it softened down to three inches.<br />
<br />
  As his bladder forced out the last drops of his milkshake from that evening... shorter and smaller it became.  Less and less until it was less than an inch soft.  He prodded it, looking at the hairless groin and feeling his negligeable balls.  There were 1-year olds more hung than he was right now.  &quot;What the fuck!?&quot;  He yelled, about to place his fingers around the tiny head, but he pulled away &quot;No, if I do that again it will go away completely....  I've got to figure out what has happened..&quot;</p>
