<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Here we are mom,” Chris said as he led his mother into the room Samantha had assigned them and closed the door. <br />
<br />
Janice took off the blindfold mask she had been wearing. As she had walked with it on through the hallways of the clown wing, she had heard what she knew to be clowns talking to each other in those creepily silly voices and honking their noses. Even more unnerving was the calliope music playing in the background. <br />
<br />
Janice blinked and took stock of the room around her. “It certainly is-colorful.” <br />
<br />
If anything, that was an understatement. The four walls were either yellow with red polka-dots or the reverse while the ceiling and carpet were tie-dyed in a swirling pattern of colors that looked like a paint factory exploded. Even the bedcovers were colorful in mismatched patterns. Hanging on the walls were portraits of clowns and circus scenes that made Janice immediately avert her eyes. <br />
<br />
“Here.” Chris handed Janice one of the satchels Samantha had given him. “That lady at the desk said we’d start changing soon; we might as well get ready.” Janice simply nodded and headed into the bathroom. <br />
<br />
To her relief, at least least the bathroom looked normal enough. Well, except for the polka dotted cover for the toilet seat. <br />
<br />
‘C’mon Janice, you can do this,’ she thought before she opened the satchel. Inside were several pairs of sports bras, tank tops, leotards, baggie panties, and bloomers that were striped, polka dotted, or swirled in various colors. And they all looked at least three sizes too big for her. <br />
<br />
‘How fitting,’ she thought glumly, ‘even our undergarments look clown-like.’ <br />
<br />
Quickly she changed out of her clothes, bra, and panties, then picked out a massive sports bra and panties with matching pink polka dots against a white background. The hung loosely about her like she was wearing a tent. <br />
<br />
Stepping out to the room, she saw Chris had already changed into an enormous pair of blue boxers with read polka dots that hung loosely about his waist and came down to his knees. Janice giggled at the sight of her son; he really did look silly in them. <br />
<br />
“Well,” she said, “I guess we are ready.” <br />
<br />
Mother and son both felt a strange tingling sensation unlike anything they felt before. “Mom, heheyaha,” Chris giggled involuntarily. His voice was noticeably deeper with a goofy lilt. “I feel....funny, heheyaha.” <br />
<br />
“Me too, heheyaha,” replied Janice, then held a hand over her mouth. Her voice was much higher, as if she inhaled some helium. “What, heheyaha, what is happening?” she said, a curious mixture of giddiness with her usual fear. <br />
<br />
“We, heheyaha, we must be changing, heheyaha,” Chris replied as their mouths stretched into wide, fixed silly grins. <br />
<br />
The first noticeable change was in their complexions-Chris&#39;s entire body faded to a milky white hue from head to toe while Janice became a blight sugary pink with ovals of white reaching up to her forehead and a milky white muzzle surrounding her mouth. <br />
<br />
Next their bodies expanded as they both put on weight-Janice&#39;s trim aerobic body gave way to a plump matronly figure; her breasts expanded to fill out her sports bra and panties. Chris’s boxers were no longer so baggy but were now stretched tight against his thickening legs and the waist expanded with his big beer belly. His face too became fatter, and he had the beginning of a double chin. <br />
<br />
Markings appeared on their faces-wide black arches appeared high on Chris’s forehead, topping ovals of blue that almost matched in shape the white ones on his mother’s face. A big read clown smile of identical shape to Janice’s muzzle stretched from his lower lip halfway to his chin and ended on either side with red circles. Bright red blush appeared on Chris’s cheeks that suited his plump features quite well. <br />
<br />
Black arches topped the white ovals around Janice’s eyes, which were outlined in black with the lids shaded a light blue; her eyelashes lengthened and curled to an enormous size. A bright red cupid’s bow smile appeared inside her muzzle, which was bordered in soft red, completing her ‘makeup.’ <br />
<br />
Both Janice and Chris had dark auburn, curly hair that became thicken and curled into an ‘afro’ style before darkening to a cherry-red. Janice’s was wider and fuller, and highlighted with pink. <br />
<br />
Mother and son both felt crackles and pops as their feet expanded into enormous clown feet. Janice was a size 12, with 8-inch toes while Chris’s were at least a size 17, and his toes as wide as a shovel. <br />
<br />
Finally, a loud POP! Filled the room. Janice and Chirs blinked to see that both now had a bulbous red blown nose, bright and shiny, dominating their faces. <br />
<br />
The newly transformed mother and son looked at each other for nearly a minute, then turned to the gig mirror on the wall. The sight of their new appearances made their jaws drop. <br />
<br />
Gingerly, Chris touched his nose. Then he gave it a squeeze. <br />
<br />
HONK! <br />
<br />
Taking a breath, Janice squeezed her own nose. HONK! <br />
<br />
Any lingering traces of Janice’s old phobia were swiftly banished. How ridiculous it was, she realized, to be afraid of something to silly and funny.  <br />
<br />
And Chris felt relieved that he was not bald.  <br />
<br />
Waddling to his mother, Chris poked her nose. Honk! She poked him back. Honk! <br />
<br />
For an unknown amount of time, the two clowns kept honking each other’s noses and laughing, they both were SSSOOO funny. <br />
<br />
Finally, they stopped. “Mom, heheyaha,” Chris giggled, “what do we do now, heheyaha?” Honk! <br />
<br />
His mother sighed. Her phobia was gone, unlikely to come back. She wanted to go out and explore the Clown Wing and the rest of the resort, meet other clowns and visitors to this resort. <br />
<br />
Glancing at the closets full of clown clothes, Janice said in her high silly voice, “Well, heheyaha, we might as well get dressed, heheyaha.” <br />
<br />
HONK! HONK!</p>
