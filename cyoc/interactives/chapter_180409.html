<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Dan became a merman, his pet fish was left alone to sadly swim inside its tank on its former owner&#39;s boat with no one else to look after it.<br />
<br />
That is, until a splash erupted out of the water, and what came out was a cecaelia, who landed on the boat in front of the fish.<br />
<br />
The fish shivered as it recognized what it was looking at. Alora looked at the fish and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, here you are.&quot; The sea witch said as she picked it up with one of her tentacles. &quot;I&#39;ve been looking for you. Luckily, my contracts can track down any of my less... lucky clients. Let&#39;s change you back, shall we?&quot; <br />
<br />
With a snap of her fingers, the fish changed form, turning into a beautiful teen mermaid with long blonde hair, crowned by a tiara, and a blue tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m me again!&quot; the mermaid gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you are, my dear.&quot; Alora grinned as she pulled the mermaid in close with her tentacles. &quot;My magic is quite powerful you know. You haven&#39;t even aged a day since I turned you into that sad state you were just in.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mermaid scowled at Alora. &quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;ve kept me like that for the past two years!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now, don&#39;t blame me. You&#39;re the one who agreed to give up your royal human life on land and sign my contract.&quot; Alora chuckled. The sea witch did a mocking impersonation of the mermaid. &quot;Oh Miss Alora, I&#39;m so tired of my life as a human princess. Please help me get the merman I love to notice me! I&#39;ll do anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
The mermaid looked away from Alora as she laughed. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have signed the contract if I had known the merman already had a mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I doubt you would have.&quot; Alora agreed. &quot;But now you&#39;re mine. So I can do whatever I want with you. And right now, I have a mission for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A mission?&quot; The mermaid raised an eyebrow. &quot;What do you want me to do? Kill someone?&quot; the mermaid asked sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Far from it, my dear.&quot; Alora shook her head. &quot;You see, a few of my clients have managed to free themselves from my contracts. One of them was Damon, who got turned back into a merman along with another former victim, Apolla, who&#39;s now pregnant with his child.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mermaid put her hands over heart. &quot;Aww… That sounds so sweet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alora smiled. &quot;Indeed it is. However, there&#39;s a bit of a problem. You see, I&#39;ve been transforming people ranging from Dan, your former owner, Sharon, Damon&#39;s mother, and now I just recently transformed a former college sports couple, Jake and Nicole. I&#39;ve been developing quite the pod of merpeople.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay…&quot; The mermaid said. &quot;But what&#39;s the problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The problem is that this growing pod has no leader, no ruler that can enforce a sense of order in their community. It could lead to chaos if the pod gets to a high enough number.&quot; Alora said. &quot;But that&#39;s where you come in, Ms. Ella, former human princess of Britain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ella paused as she realized where she was getting at. &quot;You want me to rule over merpeople?! But I ran away from home just to escape my responsibilities!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alora shrugged. &quot;You&#39;ll figure it out. After all, you have royal blood in you.&quot; She then smirked. &quot;Of course, if you don&#39;t want the offer I could change you back into a fi-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! No!&quot; Ella yelled. &quot;I&#39;ll do anything to not be a fish again. I&#39;ll even rule as a queen, just tell me what to do!&quot; The mermaid begged.<br />
<br />
The sea witch chuckled at the sorry sight of this once cocky mermaid. &quot;Alright then, here&#39;s the mission. A college football star named Kyle was about to get Nicole as his girlfriend but she soon dumped him to join her merman boyfriend Jake as a mermaid. As you can tell, Kyle is certainly quite grumpy about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm.&quot; Ella nodded. &quot;So you want me to woo this Kyle? I&#39;ve always been interested in American Football but never got around to ever knowing any players. They&#39;re pretty cute, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot; Alora nodded as well. &quot;But here&#39;s where you come in. You will meet in front of Kyle and give him a choice. Either he joins you as a merman and rules over the pod as a king or he remains on land. If Kyle accepts the offer, he will be your husband and you&#39;ll be a mermaid forever. However, if he doesn&#39;t… It&#39;s back to being a fish for you.&quot; She chuckled.<br />
<br />
Ella gulped at this. She either will win over a stranger for a husband or be a fish forever. Not exactly a very ideal choice.<br />
<br />
Alora noticed this and said. &quot;You know. If Kyle becomes your husband, you will rule the pod not only as a leader but as a Queen. You&#39;ll have more power as a monarch of the sea than the boring &quot;constitutional monarchy&quot; you have in Great Britain. Absolute monarchy, Ella. Don&#39;t you want it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm…&quot; Ella thought. &quot;You know, you make a good point. Plus, Kyle seems quite attractive to me, especially since he seems powerful as an athlete. If you also include Kyle and I growing crowns on our heads and having our own underwater palace if he signs the contract, then count me in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Consider it done.&quot; Alora said as she shook hands with Ella.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Kyle slowly walked around the beach during sunset, still bitter that Jake got the best of him. Sure, he may have a football career but Jake gets the girl in the end. It made him mad to no end.<br />
<br />
He would have cursed out loud if he hadn&#39;t heard a soft but calming melody coming from the beach. He turns towards the water and sees a beautiful blonde mermaid with a lovely azure blue fish tail laying on the rocks - She was the source of the singing.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s admiration soon turned into a frown, memories of a merperson stealing his girlfriend still fresh in his mind. &quot;What do you want?&quot; He questioned.<br />
<br />
Ella noticed his demeanor and blinked at how cute he was. &quot;Well, I&#39;m here to make you an offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An offer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ella nodded as she took out a contract and a pen. &quot;Choose to sign, and you will join me as my mate, a merman. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll remain a human on land.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle raised an eyebrow. &quot;What do I get to benefit from sacrificing my football career to be a fish?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ella chuckled. &quot;Well if you sign, you will not only be my mate but you&#39;ll be a king.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle jumped back at this. &quot;A king?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ella nodded. &quot;Indeed. I was a human princess of Great Britain before I became a mermaid with the help of the sea witch Alora. If you become my mate, you&#39;ll be my husband and therefore be a King of a pod.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle let out an impressed wolf while at the prospect. Then he asked another question. &quot;Wait, what do you mean by a pod?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our pod consists of Alora&#39;s recent clients who became merpeople. It consists of Damon, his mate Apolla, Sharon and Dan, and Jake and Nicole.&quot; Ella explained. &quot;If you sign it, you will rule the pod as a King and I will rule alongside you as a Queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle nearly fell down in shock at hearing this. &quot;Does that mean that, if I sign, I get to rule over Jake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ella smiled. &quot;Now you&#39;re getting it.&quot; But her smile soon turned into a frown. &quot;Of course, I&#39;ve heard from Alora how much football means to you. I understand you want to remain as a football king but… If you don&#39;t sign it, you may remain a human but I&#39;ll be turned back into a fish and roam the seas forever with no one to take care of me. Please, think about this carefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle thought about his options. If he didn&#39;t sign, he would keep his growing football career and his legs. Yet, that would mean this beautiful mermaid would be back into being cursed as a fish forever. If he does sign, however, he may lose his football career but he&#39;ll not only gain this beautiful mermaid as his wife but also be a merman king - A ruler of not only a pod that could be a kingdom of merfolk but also rule over that blasted Jake as sweet revenge.<br />
<br />
Finally settled on his decision, he excitedly took Ella&#39;s contract and signed it without a moment of hesitation.</p>
