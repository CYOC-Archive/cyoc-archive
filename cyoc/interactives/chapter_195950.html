<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary didn&#39;t have much trouble getting back to her room.  Despite the drastic changes to her body she actually felt really good, and found herself surprisingly nimble and light on her feet.  Her many feet, she thought to herself, amused.<br />
<br />
Arriving undetected, Mary&#39;s first instinct was to flop herself down onto the bed... but of course that wasn&#39;t so easy any more and had only gotten harder when her eighth and tenth pairs of limbs had grown in.  The feeling hadn&#39;t been pleasant and she wasn&#39;t looking forward to it happening again, but she did have a sort of curiosity what it would be like to gain more and more segments.  She tried to picture herself with dozens of arms and legs, somehow able to control them all properly, what it would feel like.  A couple of her hands snuck down and began cupping their nearest breast, and she pulled herself out of the fantasy.<br />
<br />
No no, you have enough trouble already, she thought.  She brought all her hands back to her sides.<br />
<br />
Her room was pretty big, luckily, and she could move around easily at the moment even with this many body segments, but if this continued there were going to be problems.  Hopefully her father would have some errands to run and she could safely try to figure this out once he was gone.  Meanwhile, she just needed to wait.<br />
<br />
She thought back to what was in the lab, and what she had to work with.  The teleport pod had a check of some kind that determined the DNA of what passed through it, otherwise the error message she got yesterday couldn&#39;t exist.  That might mean there&#39;s a log of that data, and maybe some sort of filter could be rigged to get her DNA back to normal.  Hopefully that means she&#39;d return to her normal self, if she could figure out the filter idea.<br />
<br />
Standing in the room felt oddly silly.  She climbed onto the bed, wanting to lay down, but discovered it wasn&#39;t long enough.  Her first three segments fit well enough, but her new pairs ended up dangling off the end.  Well, not dangling, but standing there while she tried to turn onto her side and get comfortable.  No, this wasn&#39;t working.<br />
<br />
So she tried to curl up, sort of.  She brought her back two segments forward and bent her body into a sort of three-quarter circle, lying on her side.  This way she fit onto the queen bed, barely.  Her limbs were all on the inside of the curve, and lying like this she marveled at the sheer number of hands and legs she had crowded into the space.  She touched several of her hands together, still surprised by her degree of control.  It all felt so weirdly natural.  She wished she were a little longer so they had more room.<br />
<br />
What?  No, that&#39;s crazy, you don&#39;t... well, maybe she did kind of want that.  This body was interesting, and she felt oddly... aroused.  Really?  Do I?  She wondered about this.<br />
<br />
She tried to explore the feeling, and as her hands began slipping once again to touch her various breasts she realized something: She had so many sex organs.  Ten breasts, five vaginas, what might normally be a little horny was amplified dramatically.  And her body felt good, it felt new, no injures, no aches, just healthy and alive.<br />
<br />
And she had five pussies.  Four of them new.  And she felt them growing a little wet.<br />
<br />
Mary shivered a little, a thrill running down her very lengthy spine, thinking about that.  She twisted her uppermost torso and slid open the drawer of her nightstand.  She hadn&#39;t been shy about exploring her growing body, and had a few &#39;toys&#39; there.  She retrieved her favorite dildo, and had a mad sort of realization of what she was doing as she passed it down from her first right hand down to one of her lower ones.  She didn&#39;t have five toys, alas... but she retrieved four.<br />
<br />
Mary turned her front-most body back to her original position, curled up, limbs in the center.  Four of her hands now held a dildo of various sizes, none huge but they had different shapes and surface textures.  She slid her five left hands down and found some of her nipples, and began to give them a gentle tug.<br />
<br />
She gasped, a little.  Wow, her c-cup breasts had always been sensitive but apparently that added up.  She felt five sets of fingers exploring the smooth skin and just as many nipples being teased and it was electric in her mind.  She had her rear-right hand join in.  Six breasts, six nipples, all giving her that same feeling she&#39;d always enjoyed... but three times more of it.<br />
<br />
Wow.<br />
<br />
She spent a minute with her eyes closed, just enjoying the feeling of her self-caressing.  It was pleasant and thrilling and she became more and more aware of the toys her remaining hands had on standby.<br />
<br />
God, imagine this with more segments, she thought.  This time, she didn&#39;t immediately dismiss the idea.<br />
<br />
Mary shifted her lengthy body a bit, making a little more room in the center of her curled shape.  She moved her fourth-right hand down and found that segments belly, then slid downward.  A moment later she felt the smooth rubber dildo touch her pussy.  No, THAT pussy, she corrected.  She ran it up and down the folds and slid it into her opening, just a little.  Again, a shiver down her long spine.  Mmmm.<br />
<br />
She repeated the process with her second and third right hands, and before long she was getting a sort of rhythm.  Her left hands explored her breasts, her right hands explored her pussies, staying on the outside, taking it slow.  It took a little thought but felt so weirdly natural.  Her top-right hand held the vibrator, and she slid her top-left hand off her top pair of breasts long enough to turn it on.  It hummed quietly, and as her left hand returned to her original chest her right hand found its way to her original vagina.<br />
<br />
Mary closed her eyes as she ran the vibrating shape up and down her front-most lips.  She was so wet.  All of her was so wet.  She gasped as the vibrator touched her frontmost clit, then pulled it away a bit to avoid overwhelming herself.  Could she even handle this, she wondered.<br />
<br />
For a few more minutes she continued this gentle exploration, caressing all her breasts, teasing softly all her pussies.  It was the most intense experience of her life, but as she grew used to the feelings and the incredible layers of pleasure she eventually felt ready.<br />
<br />
Her fourth right hand slid its soft plastic toy between her fourth pussy&#39;s lips, and began moving it in and out slowly.  She felt her inner walls stretch and its subtly textured surface inside her, and after only a few pumps she was struggling to control all her limbs.  And only a moment after that her fourth vagina orgasmed, a gentle slow-burn that took a long minute to subside.  All of hands paused while she rode the wave of pleasure, and Mary for a moment was unable to think, only to lay curled on the bed with her long complex body shuddering gently.<br />
<br />
She came to a moment later.  Wow.  Was it even possible to get better?<br />
<br />
As her thoughts reasserted themselves Mary had lost all sense of hesitation.  This body WAS wonderful, if it could do this.<br />
<br />
Her hands moved in concert this time, all intentional.  Her lowest pair were squeezing and tugging at her ninth and tenth nipples.  Her remaining left hands all began to massage their accompanying tits.  Her other right hands all slid their toys down to their nearest vagina, and she began to pump in and out of her fourth pussy once again.  Then her third and second.  Her breathing was heavy now, her body reeling with waves of pleasure.  The three dildoes moving in and out in a slow but steady sequence -- second, then third, then fourth, then second again.<br />
<br />
As Mary found a rhythm, she could feel her middle pussies all being pleased.  Each one a little different — with different shapes, different textures penetrating them.  As she got used to the sensations she once again touched her original pussy with the vibrator, and gasped as it added to the cacophony.  Mary squeezed her eyes closed, and slid the vibrator into its tunnel.  The feeling was electric, and her entire body shuddered as her front vagina rippled around the intruder.<br />
<br />
It was the greatest orgasm she&#39;d ever felt, built to over these long minutes... and then it got even greater, as her second pussy joined in.  Then her third.  Then her fourth.  Her mind went blank, and her hands stopped their motion, all she could feel was her pussies trembling and her long body shaking and so much pleasure that it seemed impossible.<br />
<br />
Dimly, she realized her fifth vagina was still untouched.<br />
<br />
Her first orgasm of the day had been gentle, almost relaxing.  This was not, it was a trembling tidal wave of pleasure that ran up and down her five bodies, and pounded her single mind.  It seemed to last forever, traveling from one pussy to the next, the feelings from one setting off its neighbors.  Mary rode these waves for long minutes, trying to keep control, and just as she got used to the feelings and began to be able to think, the feeling would change as another of her pussies would orgasm once again, a little differently this time.<br />
<br />
Eventually, exhausted, her complicated body settled down.  Mary opened her eyes slowly, still floating in the most wonderful feeling of afterglow she could imagine.  She was still curled on the bed, but now her entire body was beaded with sweat, her limbs mostly limp, crowded in the center of the C shape her body was in.  Her hands had long since abandoned them, but she felt the dildos still in her third and fourth vaginas.  She&#39;d lost the vibrator somewhere, but could still hear its hum.  Lord knows where the second toy went.<br />
<br />
The clock on the wall says it had been more than an hour, but there was no way her masturbation had taken that... oh wow, she wondered if that was possible, did she really spend almost a half hour just riding an endless series of orgasms?<br />
<br />
She reached down and caressed all ten of her breasts, tugging the nipples gently.  She sighed happily.<br />
<br />
Then, remembering a thought she&#39;d had what might be many minutes ago now, she curled her body a little further.  Was it possible to pull her long body into a full circle?<br />
<br />
It was, though her multitude of limbs were very crowded.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s okay, she thought, as she gently squeezed her ten breasts, enjoying the feeling.  A hour ago that alone had been incredibly pleasurable, but she&#39;d had enough time to adjust now that she still had full control.<br />
<br />
As she curled her long body into a circle, she spread her rear-most legs, then craned her neck forward and found the lips of her fifth vagina, and gave a gentle lick.  There it was again, a feeling of warm pleasure, in a place she hadn&#39;t even had yesterday.  Her face between her own legs, licking her own pussy, that was something that she could never have done before she was gifted with this incredible body.  And it is incredible, she thought.<br />
<br />
She slid her tongue between her fifth pussy&#39;s lips, taking long ice-cream licks up and down her slit.  As she did so her middle pairs of hands found the toys still stuck inside her, within her third and fourth pussies, and began gently moving them in and out.  Her top pairs began rubbing their fingertips up and down her front slits, slowly and deliberately.<br />
<br />
This time, Mary had full control.  She brought her fifth pussy to orgasm, and a few moments later her fourth pussy followed, then her third, then second, and finally her original one.  These were gentle quiverings of pure pleasure, more intentional than before, as she knew what to expect now.  Mary sighed, enjoying every moment, and kept her mind as her body once again rode a long series of waves, this time comfortable and so relaxing that after dozens of sequential orgasms she drifted to sleep.</p>
