<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty waited for Derek to finally go to sleep, barely fitting in bed anymore. Ty ventured home to think of more fun he could have, and decided he wasn&#39;t quite done playing with Derek yet. He began to think of more things he could do to the canvas Derek really was, and found the idea he was looking for. <br />
<br />
The next day, Ty walked into school with a grin on his face, waiting to watch Derek enter. He put his junk in his locker, and then ventured into the hall with the school entrance. Numerous groups of students entered in, and then he saw Derek. It wasn&#39;t very difficult to spot him, because he was now so much taller and muscular than everyone else. His clothes were skin tight, looking like they were about to break at any moment, and his sweatpants showed a Clean outline of a massive soft cock stuffed deep in a pant leg of his. His large balls swelled in what little room they had in his pants, stretching them out. He stood about half a foot taller than the crowd, and. Was drawing attention fast. Ty quickly wished that nobody would notice his change yet. <br />
<br />
Derek stumbled through the crowds of people, making way to his locker. When it wouldn&#39;t open, he punched it, leaving an outline of his fist clean in the medal. He opened it, and took out his books, and put his bag in. When he shut the locker door, his still face bagan to twitch. Undoubtedly, Ty could tell that he was slowly getting Horner and hornier. And so, Ty made his wish, that every time Derek had sex of any kind, wether masturbation or entering another persons body, his body would grow taller, every muscle in his body would grow, and his penis would grow by another inch. <br />
<br />
Ty went off on his own, trying to find his next class through the mobs of people. He was exited to see what would become of his canvas by the end of the day. However, he had a second plan in his mind that was lingering. <br />
*****<br />
Derek felt overwhelming urges to pleasure. By the time the bell first rang, he ran into the bathroom and stuffed himself into the stall. He pulled out his cock just barely in time, before it became erect and tore through his pants. He hugged his cock, and moved his arms up and down, being the only way he can jerk it off. It took about 10 minutes before he finally felt enough to barely make himself cum. His thick and hot semen spurted out and covered the walls. <br />
<br />
Just then, he felt more pleasure flood his body. His muscles tightened and swelled. His dick tingled, and his bones throbbed. His dick began to swell, and grew an inch or two. His already bulging muscles swelled to an even further size, and his body stretched slightly. Derek thought That whatever happened to him last night and right now, was triggered by him cumming, so he put on a smirk and stuffed himself into his tight clothes, and decided to skip his classes and head to the locker room while nobody was in the halls. <br />
<br />
He jumped into the locker room real quickly. Nobody was in it yet, so he went into the shower room and jerked himself off once more, but this time, left all his clothes on. Once he came, he aimed it right for the open drain, so that it wouldn&#39;t get everywhere. His body felt waves of pleasure once more, as his body burst through his clothing. Just as he finished, a small group of guys walked in. Murmuring came from them, as they undressed and headed towards the showers, where  Derek was naked, and horny. As soon as the first one entered, derek picked him up. &quot;What are you doing? Hey!&quot; <br />
Derek placed the boy&#39;s asshole on the tip of his cock and pushed into the boy, wreaking him while he moaned and yelled. The other boys ran in and watched, and Derek blocked the only exit. He thrusted into the boy over and over again until he came, pouring nearly a gallon of cum into the boy before he grew once more. He threw the now wrecked and unconscious boy into the corner and moved onto the next one. Every time a boy came into the shower area, Derek would fuck them until he came and grew.<br />
*****<br />
Ty was getting anxious. It was only third period, and he was looking forward to his beefy project. &#39;He couldn&#39;t get that big, it&#39;s only 6 hours.&#39; He thought. And as the bell rang for fourth, he planned his next move.</p>
