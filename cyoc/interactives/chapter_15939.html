<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P align=left>Theja althought joined to Alan/Rehen swung around to lick at his sheath and bulge, and smiled a wolfish smile. "Rehen that was the greatest thing i have ever experienced in my 5 seasons here! Thank You!" Alan/Rehen said, "As if i had a choice with you licking my cock and putting off those wonderful smells!" They both laughed, as he said," i guess we really have to cuddle, huh?" as they licked each other clean.</P>
<P align=left>Dr. McDnuch watched with glee as Rehen and Theja bonded. This was better than she could've hoped when she was brought the new wolf from the authorities in town. Everyone had puzzled over the unexplained appearance of a nearly mature wolf in perfect health in the little town. it was even more of a mystery for her when she ran a blood sample from him and found out he was from&nbsp;previously thought extinct line of wolf that traced its bloodlines back to the early americans. She had made a thorough check of him and even named him. He was on her schedule to release in the morning into the enclosure with Theja and her sisters Rhelba and Zhusha. Theja had been given shots to ensure her onset of heat when she had gotten Rehen in hopes that she could reproduce the line long since thought extinct. Which explains why Dr McDnuch was sitting outside the wolf enclosure in the dark observing the interaction of the two when two boys came bumbling along in the darkness, this is when things got really interesting.......Now that's an understatement she thought to herself.</P>
<P align=left>While she had been musing the boys were still frozen in their furry forms, huge erections and all. Rhelba, the oldest bitch of the three sisters had made her way over to the frozen wolves and was making herself at home with Mitch's equipment, licking and trying to gain the kind of attention her sister Theja had done. Although lacking the full onset of her heat she was hoping to interest the fine looking young wolf. From the taste of the cum on the throbbing erection she was sampling was any indication she was doing her job. Yet to her dismay, he would not reciprocate and lick her juices. Was she doing something wrong? She was confused. Dr. McDnuch was amazed at the actions of the she wolf and she walked over to the boys and whispered into Mitch's ear,"Would you like to be free from your holding spell?" He could not move but he could whine, and whine he did.&nbsp; He was dying to get a hold of this bitch in front of him offering herself to him so freely. He had watched Alan/Rehen hammer away at his bitch for a half hour and he thought he would die while frozen here helpless, smelling her wonderful scent and getting this raging erection. "if i let you go you promise not to try and harm me or escape?" the doctor whispered. Alarm bells sounded somewhere deep inside of Mitch's mind. Escape, yes! he must get away! His bestial self was overwhelmed by the intoxicating scents from all around and the wonderful sensation of having his penis licked so lovingly. The Dr. was worried momentarily as she could sense his indecision, she whispered again,"wouldn't you like to slide that lovely erection into her moist slit and feel the wonderful sensations that Alan did?" She used the name Alan to reach the human part of his mind struggling with the doubt. She needn't have bothered the lust had already won in Mitch's mind. She released him and he immediately he went to work on Rhelba's canine cunt with his tongue. She quit licking his cock, and fearing he would once again be indecisive presented herself to him and assumed the position. Mitch wasted no time leaping on her back and was stabbing at her cunt with rythmic motion. He was so lust crazed he was not hitting&nbsp;her&nbsp;vagina&nbsp;and was getting frustrated as was the bitch. Doc was frustrated too as she was also getting aroused, and she surprised herself when she grasped his cock and guided it to paydirt. Both Mitch and Rhelba howled in union as they joined for the first time. The velvet warmth of her tunnel surprised Mitch as he thrust away he had never felt so great having sex as a human (where did that thought come from?) Mitch and Rhelba did not notice when the Doc had guided him in to her, and they didn't notice as she licked his juices from her hand. She was apalled and aroused at the same time. Her hand migrated to her crotch as if having a mind of her own. She was working her hand rythmically as Mitch pounded his bitch feverishly. As he reached his climax and squeezed his knot into her tight pussy locking them together, Doc McDnuch also reached hers and howled her glee to the sky. She was immediately aware of her surroundings and embarassed to be turned on by the wolves mating so furiously.</P>
<P align=left>As&nbsp;four lovers were locked by their genitals awaiting the release the Doc turned to gaze at Dale. Poor guy,totally out of the loop! If he were really a wolf she would have probably let him fight for his own place in the pack, but normal pack rules don't apply in this situation. the youngest sister bitch was in the zoo infirmary recovering from an infection and would be for some time. She got an idea and whispered into Dale's ear too low for either couple to hear. Dale nodded and she turned and strode from the enclosure with Dale right behind. This got the attention of the other four, yet while tied they couldn't go and see.</P>
<P align=left>She reached her cottage and opened the door, she hated lying to Dale, but it was the only way to get his cooperation willingly. She was giddy as she spun and refroze Dale. He whimpered in fear as she reached up onto a shelf and withdrew a very old leatherbound book. it was her grimoire! One of several actually, but that is a story for another time. She grinned devilishly as she approached Dale. "We can do this one of two ways and its all up to you." She pulled out a hypodermic and said, "i can give you this and you will be drugged and i will castrate you! Or...." She consulted the book, and said,"i will unfreeze parts of you and you will obey me!" She unfroze his head and stripped off her clothes. She was 32 with a very sexy body that she did a great job of hiding in her frumpy clothes. She noted his expression and said, "what did you expect i have a Phd and am a female, nobody would take me seriously." "Now you are going to use that glorious tongue on me!'</P>
<P align=left>Dale was so horny himself, yet very confused. She was human and he was a wolf, yet he was human. Oh hell how did this happen? She sat in the chair with the book in her lap and spread her shaved pussy lips right in front of his nose. he was scared earlier, but the smell wafting from her pussy was having the desired effect on him too. He gave a tentative lick, and she shuddered and began speaking in a language he didn't recognize.He whined and she consulted the book again as he felt a tingle go through his body. he was growing! He was getting more muscular and he risked a glance back at his equipment and he couldn't believe his eyes he was huge. As he licked he noticed she was getting another set of nipples, then another, and another, until...........Oh lord he figured out what she was doing. She was becoming a bitch in heat herself. She jumped up and set a video camera on a tripod pointed directly at them, presented herself on her hands and knees and unfroze him.............Dale then.........</P></p>
