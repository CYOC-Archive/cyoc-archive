<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Dude, nice set of wheels,&quot; Rickie Cho said as Guy stepped out of his new ride.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he's a beaut, practically drives him-itself,&quot; Guy said, as he climbed out of the bucket seat. He fished around in his pocket for the coupon Mr. Yuan had given him. He needed looser jeans.<br />
<br />
Rickie grinned admiring Guy and Hiro.  His uncle had called him the moment Guy had pulled away from the curb.  He didn't know Guy, but he was pretty sure from his uncle's description that this was probably the same Hiro who had stolen Rickie's girlfriend just over a year ago. He was eager to get his hands on Hiro to make sure that Guy wouldn't be turning Hiro back any time soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if I check it out?&quot; Rickie said sliding under Guy's arm and into the passenger seat.  He grinned as he ran his fingers over the leather seats and dash.  He fondled the shifter, and grinned as he squeezed it. &quot;Sweet machine.  With a little work it could be outstanding,&quot; he proclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Work?&quot; Guy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, like this shifter,&quot; Rickie said unscrewing the handle from the base. Then presenting it to Guy. &quot;You're a big guy with big hands, and this thing is small. We've got lots of custom sticks for you to choose from, and with that coupon and some other things I can work out a package to make your ride cherry for a fraction of what it would cost you elsewhere. Probably, get you some new wheels for your ride too.&quot; Rickie kicked the rear right tire as he leaned against the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess I might consider a few upgrades. I really came by for the free car wash and $5.00 hand wax on the coupon,&quot; Guy sputtered staring at the shifter in his hand and trying to guess or not think what body part of Hiro's might be in his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wash and Wax, sure thing.  Hey, Pedro!&quot; Rickie shouted, &quot;While Pedro get your car washed and waxed, we can talk about the car detailing.  I bet you're the sort of guy who would like a cobra or dragon or tiger painted on his car.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Paint this car? I don't know,&quot; Guy said hesitantly.  <br />
<br />
A short Mexican boy in a blue jumpsuit with a towel hanging out of his back pocket slid into the driver's seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Number 5 Special, the works,&quot; Rickie ordered. <br />
<br />
Pedro nodded, adjusted the seat and drove Hiro toward the carwash entrance.  Rickie reached up and put his arm on Guy's huge shoulder as he guided him into the shop area. Guy whisted as he looked at the sunset detailed on the side of van, and at the flames painted on the side of another muscle car. The muscle car had huge mag wheels with chrome and gold wheel covers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we can customize that car so it's clearly yours and not another &quot;factory&quot; car. Maybe a Japanese rising sun? I mean the car is from Japan, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm still not sure I want to paint it-&quot; Guy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's okay. Let's check out the shifters.  Now here's a push button number, we could put it in the dash, and give the car a Buck Rogers look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Push button shifter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, see here's P for park, R for reverse, D for Drive, D1, D2, D3, D4, we can customize it for whatever car transmission you have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Push button gear shift?&quot; Guy said with a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about a t-shifter,&quot; Rickie said pointing at a display, &quot;Or here's a larger version of the one your car came with, or a novelty one?  This one's shaped like a cobra head, goes great with the cobra paint job if you want it.  This one has a billiard ball as the head of the shifter - you can get whichever ball you want.  This one is a bird, and this one is well you can see what it is,&quot; Rickie said with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like a naked lady,&quot; Guy said running his hand over the chrome abstract female shaped shifter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a beer,&quot; Rickie said handing Guy an Asahi.  He failed to mention that he'd already added a little sake to beer.<br />
<br />
Three beers later, Guy was starting to get into the idea of redoing his car the way it &quot;ought to be done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Hiro was torn between heaven and hell. He had wanted to cry and then scream as that Rickie dude had started to unscrew his cock.  Even though it was no longer attached, Hiro could still feel it.  He guessed from the warmth and bulge under the fabric rubbing against it that Guy had shoved it into his jeans pocket. Then he'd felt Pedro reach and grip his stub to shift the car and drive him toward the carwash entrance.  His tires were locked into place on the track and cold suds was splashed on him.  The initial soapy rinse was quite enjoyable.  But the powerwash, particularly the undercarriage pressure wash stung like a fire hose. Then the hot wax dripped all over his body.  As the car rolled along the track pulled by the chain undercarriage, different liquids were squirted of sprayed on him.  Automated foam ribbons rubbed the suds away.  Finally, the gang of hispanic young men began to work on him with their spray bottles and towels. His glass and chrome shone. He was parked on the side, as the worked. Then Pedro walked over carrying a heavy duty electronic buffer. Guys were scrubbing his wheel wells.  Others were inside him massaging the leather with a shiny protective coating. <br />
<br />
Hiro couldn't understand Spanish, but some of the comments the way they were said and the laughter and pointing that followed made Hiro uncomfortable.  It seemed to him that these guys were indicating that they planned to chop Hiro up. The keys had been pulled from the ignition by a guy called Sammy.  He returned and tried the key in the door and then the ignition starting Hiro's engine again. Then he shut Hiro down and pulled the key out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect copy,&quot; Sammy announced dropping the key in his pocket and putting the original key back into Hiro's ignition.  <br />
<br />
Hiro had to tell Guy that they'd copied his key, but he was a car.  Maybe Guy would turn him back soon.</p>
