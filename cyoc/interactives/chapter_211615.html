<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Albert sat there trying his best to heed Revy&#39;s advice, he thought about his family and how there really isn&#39;t anything left of it. Mom passed away when he was very young, and Dad was more interested in drowning his memories than being a father. He still hasn&#39;t quite gotten over what happened last year, since then he&#39;s been living alone in a crappy apartment, and is currently between jobs right now. Finally there was the guys, he&#39;s begun to wonder why he was even friends with them to begin with. Tony was a jerk and has only ever gotten worse, Joe was well Joe, and Bryan the only person he liked hanging out with, was often to busy helping out with his own family and work that he rarely ever saw him. In fact they have been drifting apart for a few years now, this trip was actually a last hurrah to rekindle the friendship. Needless to say it hadn&#39;t been going very well.<br />
<br />
He then thinks about the Forgotten and their curse. He thinks about Sarah or now Kara as if this wasn&#39;t confusing enough, and how desperately he wanted to remember who she was. Then there&#39;s Revy who obviously seems to know him but he has even less of an idea of who she is. Her outburst earlier definitely left him more than a little terrified of her, but even then something about her feels so familiar. As for the other two, Sage seems friendly enough though she may just be really horny, seeing as they&#39;ve started to absent mindedly stroke her strange cock next to him. As for Fang, she seemed not just friendly, but motherly obviously caring greatly for the others. As someone who never really had a lot of time with his own mother, he couldn&#39;t help but want that kind of relationship. On top of all that the transformation looked very enjoyable, and he had to admit he was getting pretty fed up with the hole being a responsible adult thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hay do you mind if I talk to him.. alone?&quot; Kara asked nervously. &quot;Very well,&quot; Fang said a knowing smile on her face &quot;we&#39;ll be at the camp if you need us, come along you two.&quot; As the girls all made there way to the camp Albert suddenly grew concerned and asked &quot;wait I&#39;m not going to just suddenly forget them, am I?&quot; &quot;Did you forget them wen you turned around to masturbate?&quot; Kara asked. &quot;Um no I guess not,&quot; he replied feeling a bit embarrassed. &quot;Than you shouldn&#39;t have anything to worry about,&quot; she said &quot;it seems to be an area of affect kind of thing anyway.&quot; &quot;By the way,&quot; She said walking up to him on all fours looking oddly comfortable with her new form &quot;what do you remember about tonight?&quot; Albert thought for a moment before answering &quot;it&#39;s really weird, I remember everything that happened, I even remember that I was thinking about you.&quot; &quot;But It&#39;s like you&#39;re just suddenly gone, like if there wasn&#39;t anything to remember in the first place, but that makes no sense,&quot; he said clutching his head &quot;I feel like I&#39;m going insane.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Kara said before sitting next to him &quot;I pretty sure you&#39;re experiencing some kind of mental paradox.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How did you find out about these guys anyway?&quot; Albert asked trying to take his mind off of it. Kara thought for a second before answering &quot;I guess you could say it all started with Revy.&quot; &quot;About five years ago when she was &quot;Forgotten,&quot; she ended up leaving behind quite a bit of evidence, records, paperwork, and sometimes gaps in people&#39;s memories,&quot; she explained. &quot;Weirdly wile she did leave behind photos and videos, if you actually try to look at them you&#39;d end up just forgetting you ever saw them.&quot; &quot;Smelling a mystery there was no way I could resist, so I began my own investigation.&quot; &quot;It was a bit frustrating at first, but I eventually found enough evidence to suggest that there was indeed a person behind all this, someone that for whatever reason no one could remember.&quot; &quot;But I also found something else, this isn&#39;t the first time something like this had happened.&quot; &quot;Thirty years ago there was a horrible car accident, and a married couple was found dead.&quot; &quot;I found evidence that they had a son, and there&#39;s documentation that there was a search party sent out to look for him.&quot; &quot;however a few months into the search it&#39;s as if they forgot that they were searching for someone to begin with.&quot; &quot;Top it all off with the local legends of an impossible to describe monster called the Wabisca or White Fang that is said to live this very forest, and a very strange story started to emerge.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So how&#39;d you go about finding them,&quot; Albert asked completely invested in this tale. &quot;I actually started to hear about some food, drinks, and other stuff disappearing from a gas station not far from the same forest.&quot; &quot;What clued me into the idea that this was connected was actually the security footage. you see when anyone viewed it they would either not find anything or simply forget they were ever watching the footage to begin with.&quot; &quot;At first I got very frustrated repeatedly viewing the footage only to forget what I even watched or forgetting that I even watched it.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s when I decided to write down what I was seeing, and there it was I didn&#39;t remember writing it but now I had a decryption of two strange girls stealing drinks, food, and the people just forgetting that they were even there.&quot; &quot;So I started to stake out the place, and waited for these mysterious girls.&quot; &quot;When they finally showed up, I followed them, and I found this place,&quot; She said gesturing all around her. <br />
<br />
Kara smiled for a bit, enjoying the fact that she can now freely remember these events &quot;When I first met them they didn&#39;t really trust me.&quot; &quot;But after I showed them how I was able to find them, and after I promised to keep them a secret, they told me everything.&quot; &quot;I came back to visit every now and again, writing everything down in my journal to try and remember them.&quot; &quot;I began to truly enjoy my time with them, I learned things about myself that I never knew before, and for the first time in my life I felt like I could be myself.&quot; Her expression grew more somber as she continued &quot;It got harder to leave them, every time I forgot them it felt like I lost a part of myself.&quot; &quot;I suppose it&#39;s not to surprising that I ultimately decided to become one of them.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Albert sat there for a second before finally asking &quot;what did you mean when you said that you don&#39;t have a family to go back to?&quot; She looked to be on the verge of crying, taking a few minutes to compose herself before answering &quot;Do you remember my parents, Henry and Kathryn Smith.&quot; He thought for a second, only getting more confused as he realized that he actually does &quot;oh God that&#39;s weird, that must be what you meant by gaps.&quot; &quot;So I can safely say that you know that they tend to be extremely religious?&quot; Kara asked, Albert quickly nodded in response. &quot;They found my journal, and believing that It was somehow demonic burned it,&quot; tears began to fall down her face finding it difficult to continue. &quot;They shunned me, told me that their daughter was dead,&quot; She sobbed taking few moments to recompose herself before continuing. &quot;I had nowhere else to go so I came back here, I waited a few weeks for them to get rid of any evidence that I ever existed, and well you kind of walked in on the last part.&quot; <br />
<br />
Albert thought for a moment just taking in everything he had learned before asking &quot;what do you think I should do?&quot; &quot;Honestly, I think you should join us,&quot; Kara said &quot;we both know that there&#39;s not much left for you to go back to, especially after... well you know.&quot; A pained expression washed over his face &quot;the more I think about it the less of a choice I seem to have.&quot; Kara comes even closer to him &quot;do you want a little taste?&quot; she asked. &quot;What do you mean by taste?&quot; he said feeling a bit nervous. She gave him a kiss letting it last for a few minutes before pulling away and asking &quot;monster or human?&quot; His dick was absolutely rock hard as he looked into her glowing eyes &quot;I would like my first time to be with your human form.&quot; She smiled warmly at him before closing her eyes seeming to concentrate, suddenly her body began to shift back to her human form. However a few things were different from how she looked before, her hair and eyes retained the blood red color, her nails were more claw like, the ears looked pointed like an elf, and she retained two sharp fangs. <br />
<br />
She shivered as the transformation finished &quot;So where were we?&quot; Kara said removing his shirt before giving him another kiss. He felt her wet pussy grind against his saft as they continued to explore each other&#39;s mouths. He felt a hand gently grasp his cock before slipping inside of her wet snatch feeling her warmth envelope him. Almost instinctively he began to thrust up into her enjoying the feeling of slipping in and out of her warm folds. Suddenly she began to move, sliding up and down his saft, going faster and faster with each trust. She briefly broke off the kiss to let out a loud moan before wrapping her arms around him and continue the kiss a new. Albert began to feel himself reaching the edge as Kara&#39;s movements grew faster and more frantic. Suddenly he felt her clench up, experiencing an orgasm, Albert fallowing soon after squirting globs of cum up into her quivering pussy.<br />
<br />
Albert and Kara laid there still wrapped in each other&#39;s arms simply enjoying each other&#39;s warmth. &quot;I&#39;ve decided to join you,&quot; he said before giving her one more kiss &quot;I want to remember you.&quot; She smiled before tightening her hug practically crushing him &quot;you won&#39;t regret this!&quot; she said excited. She quickly stood up, helping Albert up to his feet as well before making their way to the camp. As he walked over he saw that Fang and Revy were both in their human form while Sage stayed in her monster form. Sage and Revy were engaged in what appeared to be some extremely wild sex looking more like a game of twister than anything he was familiar with. Fang was simply sitting next to the fire enjoying a drink, occasionally looking over at the two, and absent mindedly fingering her cunt. Eventually the white haired woman noticed Albert and Kara approaching &quot;did you two enjoy your alone time?&quot; She asked a lewd smile on her face. Almost immediately Kara ran up to Fang before excitedly exclaiming &quot;he&#39;s decided to join us!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fang&#39;s face hardens turning her attention to Albert &quot;are you certain of this?&quot; she asked &quot;you are of course aware that if you do this there is no going back.&quot; &quot;I am,&quot; he responded &quot;I&#39;ve thought about this, and honestly I don&#39;t have much of a life to go back to.&quot; &quot;Besides,&quot; he added &quot; this is literally the coolest thing that has ever happened to me, I don&#39;t want to forget you guys.&quot; Fang seemed touched by that sentiment smiling warmly before saying &quot;then I welcome you to our family.&quot; Fang stands up before walking in the direction of the shrine &quot;shall we begin then?&quot; she asked looking over at the two girls fucking each other. &quot;Ahhh sorry we&#39;re in to good of a flow ohhh yes!&quot; Revy screamed &quot;mmm its not like you need us anyway ahhh fuck me!&quot; Fang shrugs continuing to the shrine Albert and Kara following closely behind. <br />
<br />
Upon reaching the shrine, Albert walked over to the center feeling a little nervous as he sat on the alter just as Kara did. &quot;Ok!&quot; the red haired girl said excitedly &quot;me and Fang are going to transform, just watch us like you did earlier and you&#39;ll be one of us in no time.&quot; This time the two took positions closer to the alter giving him a more intimate view of their bodies. &quot;You probably know this already, but you should be aware that you&#39;ll more than likely develop a woman&#39;s body,&quot; Fang said as a blush forms on her face before slipping a finger into her wet vagina. &quot;Don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll keep the part that matters&quot; Kara added joining the white haired woman in masturbation. Suddenly the two moaned as light began to fill their eyes signaling that the transformation had begun. <br />
<br />
He felt his cock swell and pulsate as he looked intently at their growing clits, watching them change into the strange red monster dicks he&#39;s become familiar with. After only a few minutes he began to stroke his saft joining the girls in masturbation. Almost immediately he began to feel strange as some kind of energy began to flow into him, it felt good invigorating him. A golden light began to flicker across the alter, his dick grew slightly, and large amounts of pre began to flow out the tip enhancing the pleasure. He leaned back to get comfortable, watching enthralled as the girls Infront of him continuing to change, their skin darkening, long thick tails grew from their spines, long claws grew on their changing hands and feet. He began to stroke more frantically as the strange energy began to coalesce enhancing his pleasure. The golden light grew brighter spreading to the massive ring of stones. He feels himself coming to the edge as something forms inside his pubic area, a vortex of energy ragging around it. Suddenly it was all unleashed as he experienced an intense full body orgasm. Golden energy erupted from his body, leaving behind a faint current that flowed through him triggering the transformation. <br />
<br />
Albert spasmed and moaned as a seemingly perpetual orgasm overwelled his body, their cock changed becoming tapered, red, and smooth. Two rows of sharp, flexible spines grew along the underside, the testicles became drawn up into the body leaving behind a wet vulva in their place. Their skin grew darker becoming a brownish black, leaving it feeling soft and smooth. The bones restructured hips widened, shoulders and waist narrowed, their face reshaped becoming softer and more feminine. The legs sifted to a digitigrade structure the feat changing to become more flexible and better able to grasp things. Their hands reshaped the pinky shifting into a second thumb, long hard claws grew on the fingers and toes. A long, muscular tail extended from the base of their spine before a thick main of white hair grew down from the back of the head to the tip of the tail. Fat and muscle redistributed, arms became lean, their hips and ass became rounder and softer. Finally their chest began to swell developing into a pair of soft B cup breasts completing their feminine changes. Fur grew on their arms and legs obscuring the hand and feet leaving only the claws viable, and stopping at the elbows and knees. The ears grew long and fluffy, their eyes grew large with black sclera and glowing yellow irises, their mouth was filled with sharp teeth and a long tongue. <br />
<br />
Once the transformation was complete Albert experienced a final wave of euphoria as glowing yellow cum erupted from their cock covering their new beasts in what looked like liquid sun light. Recovering from the intense orgasm they just experienced they simply laid on the alter enjoying the new sensations they were feeling. Suddenly they heard laughing next to them making Albert look over to see Kara &quot;you actually turned out really cute&quot; she said. Albert looked up at her for a few moments before something clicked in their head &quot;Sarah, I had a crush on you!&quot; They blurted out not expecting their new voice. Kara looked taken a back by Albert&#39;s sudden confession &quot;is that why you were trying so hard to remember me?&quot; She asked. They simply nodded in response, &quot;your so sweet,&quot; Kara said giving them a deep kiss her long tongue slipping down into their throat. They quickly followed suit slipping their own tongue deep into her mouth wrapping their tongue around hers. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes of long sloppy kissing, Kara finally broke off allowing the two to breathe. &quot;Hey we probably shouldn&#39;t do this here,&quot; she said clearly aroused before helping Albert to their feet. &quot;Why?&quot; they asked feeling a bit bummed. &quot;There&#39;s still a lot about this place we don&#39;t really understand,&quot; she explained &quot;I don&#39;t want to risk something weird happening.&quot; &quot;Besides, don&#39;t you want to go somewhere more comfortable,&quot; she said before giving them a kiss and running back to the camp. Albert attempted to run after her, but as they haven&#39;t quite gotten used to their new lags and tail, they end up stumbling a few times and even tripping over their own tail at least once. Eventually the two entered one of the tents finding a large collection of pillows, blankets, and some animal skins in a loose pile on the ground. Albert turned to Kara giving her a passionate kiss pressing their cock against hers before falling back into the makeshift bed. <br />
<br />
The silver haired creature looked up at Kara with gleaming golden eyes, covering their beasts with their fur covered arms, and spreading open their legs revealing their pulsing cock and wet pussy. They were doing their best to look alluring, but ended up looking more timid and a little nervous instead. Kara crawls on top of them rubbing her dick against their moist snatch making Albert squeal in surprise. They looked up at the red eyed beast sprawled out over them, fear began to creep over Albert as the reality of what they&#39;re about to do became clear. &quot;Please be gentle,&quot; they blurted surprising themself with just how feminine they sounded. They felt a clawed hand cup their cheek &quot;sorry I forgot that this is your first time,&quot; Kara said &quot;are you ok or do you want me to stop?&quot; They focused on sensation of the throbbing length of Kara&#39;s dick pressing against the moist entrance of their pussy. &quot;Don&#39;t stop,&quot; They said still looking a bit nervous &quot;but please go slow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kara planted a delicate kiss on Albert&#39;s lips before slowly sliding her cock down to their entrance the soft spines stimulating their wet folds. Suddenly they felt the tip of Kara&#39;s fleshy spike slip into her womanhood eliciting a moan as it began to reach deeper inside her. Eventually the cock pressed against what she assumed was her hymen &quot;this is going to hurt, are you ready?&quot; Kara asked. The white haired girl simply nodded in response still looking very nervous. Kara wanting to make her as comfortable as possible gave her mate a long passionate kiss before pushing deeper into her braking the hymen. Searing pain radiated from Albert&#39;s groin causing her to wrap her arms and lags around her partner gripping her tightly. Her new body thankfully healed quickly as the pain subsides allowing her to enjoy the feeling of Kara&#39;s pulsing dick inside her. &quot;You can start moving now&quot; she said feel more comfortable and even a little excited. <br />
<br />
Kara began to slide out allowing the spines to stimulate her insides before trusting deeper into her. She started slowly pumping in and out of her, doing her best to be gentle. It felt strange at first but eventually Albert began to enjoy the feeling letting out a loud moan. Kara began to quicken her pace thrusting faster and harder as they grew more comfortable, and their pleasure began to rise. Albert had never experienced anything like this before, it was almost as if she was being wound tighter and tighter with every thrust, she was almost afraid that she might brake. Suddenly she snapped as a wave of euphoria rushed throughout her body making her clench up tightening her grip around her lover. Kara fallows close behind making one last thrust before releasing red, hot, glowing globs of seed filling her mate&#39;s pussy. Albert was surprised by how much she enjoyed the sensation of being filled up with Kara&#39;s hot jizz, and after a few minutes of simply laying there enjoying the afterglow, they both nodded off.<br />
<br />
Albert began to stir waking up to see that Sage, and Fang had also come to sleep on the mass of pillows, and blankets. They looked around for Revy but couldn&#39;t find her (she must be in a different tent or she went to go hunt Tony) they thought to themself. Their thoughts began to dwell on the guys, feeling a bit guilty about leaving them like that. They then noticed that the camp fire was still lit outside and decided to investigate, their legs feeling a bit wobbly as they walked out. Upon leaving the tent they saw Revy in her human form sitting on a log next to the fire drinking. Finally she addressed Albert &quot;so you still wake up in the middle of the night aye squirt,&quot; she said addressing them in that same moniker that they swear they&#39;ve heard their whole life. But frustratingly Albert just couldn&#39;t seem to put the pieces together. &quot;Still can&#39;t quite remember me can you?&quot; she said sadly &quot;I guess shouldn&#39;t be to surprised it has been about five years since I disappeared.&quot; <br />
<br />
Revy placed her hand on the log next to her inviting them to sit, Albert sat next to her before being handed a bottle. &quot;You still drink right?&quot; Revy asked, they simply nodded grabbing it and taking a swig before immediately spitting it out. &quot;You know I hate whiskey!&quot; they said before looking up at Revy with a somewhat dumb expression on their face. Revy swore she heard an audible click in their head when Albert&#39;s eyes became flooded &quot;Renay?&quot; &quot;Took you long enough squirt,&quot; Revy said wiping the tears from her eyes. The girl suddenly lunged embracing her sister in the warmest hug she could. &quot;I feel so horrible I should have never forgotten you,&quot; she sobbed feeling Revy return the hug. &quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault,&quot; She said &quot;It was this damn curse.&quot; The white haired girl pulled way wiping the tears from her face before asking &quot;how did this happen anyway.&quot; Revy looked a little hesitant at first before finally saying &quot;I suppose you now remember that me and Tony were dating, right?&quot; &quot;OHH!&quot; she exclaimed finally remembering why she hung out with those guys in the first place. <br />
<br />
&quot;Me and Tony came out to this forest to well fuck,&quot; Revy explained &quot;I guess we started to play around pushing each other and running around, and not really paying attention to our surroundings.&quot; She shuddered pressing her hands against her head seemingly try to push the memory from her mind. &quot;Let&#39;s just say that when Fang and Sage finally found me, I was at the bottom of a cliff,&quot; she said clearly uncomfortable with remembering these events. &quot;God,&quot; Albert said before remembering her sister&#39;s outburst earlier &quot;he ran away, didn&#39;t he?&quot; Revy nodded in response a familiar flame began to burn in her eyes before trying to calm herself back down. &quot;When I finally came to, I was already like this,&quot; she said &quot;I guess I was in pretty bad shape when they found me.&quot; She turned her back to her sister revealing a very nasty looking scare running along her spine &quot;the only thing they could do to save me was to make me like them.&quot; &quot;I have to admit I was pretty pissed off when I found out what they did to save me,&quot; Revy said. &quot;The resentment didn&#39;t last very long though,&quot; she added &quot;I&#39;m honestly very grateful for the life they&#39;ve given me, and I have to admit I really hated being human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even then I still really missed you and dad,&quot; Revy said &quot;I actually tried to talk to you before, to see if I could get you to remember me.&quot; &quot;Shit,&quot; Albert said &quot;I remember that now, God I feel like such a jerk.&quot; &quot;Again it wasn&#39;t your fault,&quot; she said giving her sister another hug &quot;we&#39;re together now that&#39;s what matters.&quot; She seemed to think about something for a second before asking &quot;how&#39;s dad?&quot; Albert&#39;s ears practically drop off her head as she looks up at her sister, tears once again flooding her eyes &quot;he&#39;s gone.&quot; &quot;What do mean gone?&quot; Revy asked not wanting to know the answer. Albert hesitated for what felt like hours before simply wrapping her clawed hands around her own throat. She embraced her sister before braking down and crying &quot;I sorry, I couldn&#39;t stop him, by time I got home he...&quot; she sobbed. Revy could only scream before returning her sisters embrace. The two simply sat there embracing each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you need a new name you definitely don&#39;t look like an Albert any more,&quot; Revy said whipping her eyes. She hesitated for a second before saying &quot;Lilly.&quot; &quot;No, that&#39;s mom&#39;s name,&quot; Revy pointed out before examining her &quot;it does kind of suite you thought doesn&#39;t it... fine your Lilly.&quot; Lilly seemed to think for a second before grabbing the whiskey and lifting it into the air &quot;for dad.&quot; &quot;For dad&quot; Revy said returning the sentiment before the two sisters took a long swig. For the rest of the night the two caught up, reminisced, and simply enjoyed each others company.</p>
