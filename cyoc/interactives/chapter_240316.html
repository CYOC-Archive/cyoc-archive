<br />
Lilith and Eliana sat in the middle of the large crowd of people with what seemed like hundreds of thousands of fans, that seemed to consist mostly of teenage girls and young women, including their daughters. Lilith had used the card Annie gave her to get in contact with Bong-Cha, but of course they mistook her for a crazy fan at first before Lilith said to pass along a message to ‘Bomb-Pop’ that only she would understand: a purple 1933 Plymouth roadster. Her message was passed along and a few days later, they received not only four tickets in the mail to Bomb-Pop’s concert, but also backstage passes and a meet and greet package, meaning that Bomb-Pop herself was serious about meeting Lilith again.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Alyssa and Rebecca were shrieking for joy when Lilith presented the girls with the tickets and passes. So the four of them had come to Bomb-Pop’s concert which was only a two hour drive from their home. Lilith and Eliana had sat in the front seat of their car listening to their daughters sing along to Bomb-Pop’s latest album and Lilith could hardly believe some of the songs that her old friend was singing, as they definitely were a different style than she had started out with; her appearance was so sanitized and girly. The outfit she had on only solidified this: she was dolled up with glittery vibrant makeup and her blonde hair was expertly styled in long waves. She wore what looked like a pink and blue marching band uniform with only a high cut thong-like article to cover her bottom. Shiny glittery platform stilettos on her feet and glittery white gloves.<br />
<br />
When they arrived at the performance hall, the girls begged their mothers to buy them Bomb-Pop shirts, which they obliged to doing.<br />
As they sat down in their chairs listening to Bomb-Pop’s vapid perky music. After the first set, the two moms decided they needed a little break and headed to the bathroom and tried to tell their daughters they would be back.<br />
<br />
“Alyssa, we’re going to the bathroom!” Lilith shouted to her daughter.<br />
<br />
“No mom, I don’t have to go!” Alyssa shouted back, not understanding what her mother meant.<br />
<br />
“No, I meant....fuck it, we’ll be back!” Lilith shouted to Alyssa and Rebecca over the crowd.<br />
<br />
Lilith and Eliana went into the bathroom to find a couple of teenage girls in there, but were relieved to also see a few women in there who were their own ages.<br />
<br />
“Your daughters drag you to this concert too?” One of the other mothers asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I got both of our daughters tickets to this and they are nothing but excited to be here.” Lilith said to the mom.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, our girls are as well. They’re back out in the seats, we just had to get away, you know? Just from all the noise for a while.” The first woman said.<br />
<br />
“And to have a little time to ourselves.” The second woman said as she held the first woman’s hand and it was only then that Lilith and Eliana noticed their wedding rings on the women’s fingers.<br />
<br />
“You two married? You look like a good couple?” The second woman asked as both Lilith and Eliana shook their heads and held up their hands stepping away from one another.<br />
<br />
“Oh no! She’s my roommate.” Eliana answered.<br />
<br />
“She’s also my best friend.” Lilith added.<br />
<br />
“Our daughters are also best friends.” Eliana further explained.<br />
<br />
“I’m a lesbian but we’re not—I mean, we’re just friends.” Lilith said feeling a little embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“So what about you honey? You got someone in your life?” The first woman asked Eliana.<br />
<br />
“I...I did, but he died a year ago. It’s just been me and my daughter for the longest time. But like I said, this woman is my best friend and like a second mom to my own daughter, just like I’m a second mom to her daughter.” Eliana said putting her arm on Lilith’s shoulder who put her own arm on Eliana’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that is so sweet. You two are so lucky to have each other. Just like this one is always there for me.” The first woman said kissing her wife on the lips.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well, it’s been nice talking to you, but my friend and I should really be getting back to our daughters now.” Lilith said as the other women agreed and also decided to get back to their own kids.<br />
<br />
Lilith and Eliana now got back to their seats just as Bomb-Pop was finishing one of her songs. Lilith and Eliana took notice that Alyssa was singing along while Rebecca was holding her hand to her chest.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow! You’ve all been like so awesome! I’ve gotta take a thirty minute break but you’ve been a great audience so far! Love you!” Bomb-Pop chirped, in her bubbly voice, into the microphone as she trotted off the stage in her shiny high heels.<br />
<br />
“Okay girls, that’s our cue, are you ready to go backstage and meet Bomb-Pop?” Eliana asked as Alyssa and Rebecca couldn’t contain their excitement and just squealed in anticipation at their mothers.<br />
<br />
“I think we can take that as a ‘yes’.” Lilith slightly joked as Eliana nodded and the four of them proceeded backstage with their passes and presented their VIP tags to security before being let in backstage.<br />
<br />
Backstage, the vampire superstar was wrapping her hands feeling a little nervous about seeing Lilith again, but very excited as well. When she heard people approaching and turned to see them, her eyes fell first onto Alyssa.<br />
<br />
“L-Lilith!? Holy shit! It’s you!” The vampire exclaimed and rushed over and pulled Alyssa into a massive hug.<br />
<br />
Lilith and the others walked over too. The black haired woman smirked, “No, that’s my daughter, Alyssa.”<br />
<br />
Bomb-Pop dropped the girl and swooped over to Lilith, she grabbed the woman’s hands and looked into her eyes.<br />
<br />
“It…It’s you…” the bottle blonde said quietly. Examining her every feature. “It’s really you…”<br />
<br />
The vampire looked to Lilith’s short hair. “You changed your hairstyle.”<br />
<br />
“Pfff. You’re one to talk ‘Bomb-Pop’!” Lilith smirked.<br />
<br />
The pop star backed away and huffed. Lilith smiled. It was good to see her again, even if she had changed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah well…it’s not like I chose this shit.” She almost growled.<br />
<br />
Lilith chuckled and introduced the girls as well as Eliana. Almost immediately the vampire assumed her pop star voice and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Hey hey! Omg! It’s so great to meet you. I knew you when you were babies! And you’re so grown up now!” She cooed perkily. Alyssa and Rebecca both could hardly say a word to her at the moment, Alyssa especially having just been hugged by one of her music idols.<br />
<br />
Lilith rolled her eyes at her ditzy persona. Bomb-Pop then looked to Eliana and her expression changed.<br />
<br />
“Uh…hiya…Eliana.” She said trying to keep up her cheery demeanor like her manager trained her to.<br />
<br />
“Bong-cha—Or Bomb-Pop…more fitting I’d say. Nice outfit by the way, very cute.” Eliana smirked.<br />
<br />
Bomb-Pop blushed but you couldn’t tell underneath the layers of makeup and glitter. She then thought back to her meeting with Setepenre and how poorly that had gone.<br />
<br />
“Eliana listen, Set came to me a while ago. She....she told me about Luca, I’m sorry I wasn’t...” Bomb-Pop began to say before Eliana held her hand up to her for her to stop.<br />
<br />
“Just know he still thought very kindly of you. He actually introduced Rebecca to your music.” Eliana said Bomp-Pop now looked at Eliana’s daughter.<br />
<br />
“Your dad really was a great man. You must miss him a lot.” Bomb-Pop said to Rebecca who nodded slowly.<br />
<br />
“Y-Yes....he gave me your first album....I loved your stuff from the start.” Rebecca answered nervously.<br />
<br />
Bomb-Pop smiled but she was embarrassed that Luca had introduced his daughter to her pop star stuff.<br />
<br />
“Aw, thanks sweetie. Now I don’t have too much time so I guess I’ll just ask you question and you can ask me one question. Lilith: my only question is....how? how are you back?” Bomb-Pop asked trying not to cry while asking.<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s....complicated but....the one who brought me back was my daughter, Alyssa.” Lilith said as Bomb-Pop now smiled at Alyssa putting her hand on the girl’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Alyssa, you have both your mother’s beautiful looks and her kindness. Never change that about yourself.” Bomb-Pop said kissing Alyssa on the cheek as the girl’s heart began to beat fast and she smiled and nodded while saying barely audible dialogue.<br />
<br />
“Now, what’s your one question for me?” Bomb-Pop asked as Lilith took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
“I got into contact with Annie a while back. She was the one who helped me get into contact with you. She also told me about Misery. Do you....know or have you heard anything about her?” Lilith asked as Bomb-Pop now thought for a moment and nodded her head.<br />
<br />
“I can’t be too sure about this. But I did hear rumors when we were traveling through a town just a little ways away from where you live actually. There was talk of a vigilante there and....from what I heard, it did sound like Misery. That’s about all I can tell you. It’s a town just west of where you live Eliana.” Bomb-Pop explained to them.<br />
<br />
“Okay, now, I’ve only got a few minutes before I get back on stage, so let’s do a photo op with you four first before I forget.” Bomb-Pop said as she stood in the center of the picture with Lilith and Alyssa on one side with Eliana and Rebecca on the other side. She posed in her usual preppy and cute poses.<br />
<br />
“Yay! I’ll send you guys photo copies in the mail. Now is there anything else you want to say before you get back to enjoying the show?” Bomb-Pop asked them as Alyssa suddenly had an idea.<br />
<br />
“It’s....kind of secret, can I whisper it to you?” Alyssa asked as she whispered to Bomb-Pop who nodded.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’ll only be a minute for me to call.” Bomb-Pop said as she took out her phone and made a video call. She was in a private conversation before she turned to look at Rebecca.<br />
<br />
“Rebecca, right? I’ve got a few friends here that would like to say hello to you.” Bomb-Pop said showing Rebecca her phone and Rebecca was almost out of breath when she saw her favorite band Passion Fire on the other side.<br />
<br />
“Hi Rebecca, it’s nice to meet you!” Passion Fire collectively said together.<br />
<br />
“We hope you have a great time at Bomb-Pop’s concert, she’s a really good friend of ours.” One of the members said as Rebecca was holding in her screams.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for being a big fan ours, you’re amazing!” Another one of the members said blowing a fire kiss.<br />
<br />
“Thank you!” Rebecca finally managed to slightly shout before covering her mouth in excitement.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I’ll meet you for dinner later in the week guys, bye bye!” Bomb-Pop chirped before hanging up her phone.<br />
<br />
“Okay it’s been great meeting you all again. Alyssa, Rebecca, you both be good to your moms now and thanks for listening to my songs.” Bomb-Pop thanked as she gave a quick hug to Lilith and Eliana before getting ready to head back on stage.<br />
<br />
“Bomb-Pop knows us!” Alyssa said excitedly to Rebecca.<br />
<br />
“She knows ‘Passion Fire’ and got me a video call with them!” Rebecca said excitedly to Alyssa.<br />
<br />
“She kissed me on the cheek!” Alyssa said to Rebecca.<br />
<br />
“She thinks we’re amazing!” Rebecca said to Alyssa.<br />
<br />
“This night has been amazing!” Alyssa said excitedly to Rebecca who nodded in approval and then both girls went over to their mothers giving them both a hug.<br />
<br />
“YOU’RE THE BEST MOM EVER!” Alyssa and Rebecca said to Lilith and Eliana who smiled at each other happy for both of their daughter’s approval.<br />
<br />
Lilith turned to the vampire and smirked. “Thanks so much. You’re a great pop star.”<br />
<br />
Bomb-Pop rolled her eyes and groaned as she headed back onstage putting a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
They went back to their seats afterwards and listened to more of Bomb-Pop’s songs before it ended in another hour or so. Then the four of them drove home with Alyssa and Rebecca sleeping in the back of the car with Eliana and Lilith smiling at their sleeping daughters.<br />
<br />
“We have the best daughters.” Eliana said to Lilith holding up a fist pump.<br />
<br />
“Hell yeah we do.” Lilith said returning her fist pump.</p>
