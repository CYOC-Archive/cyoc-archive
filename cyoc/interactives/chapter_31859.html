<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Stewie, undecided on what he was going to do, knelt down and placed the crystal ball in the dirt, crushing the wet grass below it. The choice he had to make, was one that was hard for him to do. Both options sounded good, both having definite pros and unknown cons. Stewie stood there, leaning over the central stone, resting all of his weight on his two wolven hands, contemplating the coice. Stewie wanted to take the power of the crystal ball, making him and anyone he turns into an immortal werewolf, able to live the rest of their days however they saw fit. Suddenly Stewie's ear twitched, picking up a faint rustling sound and a new scent in the air. Sniffing deeply, Stewie caught the scent, the scent of a man... but he couldn't quite tell whose.</br>
<br>Decidiing to deal with the intruder first and the crystal ball second, Stewie leaves the ball sit and heads toward the spot he heard the noise come from. When Stewie got about half way, the man walked out of the woods and bushes, coming into full view and Stewie knew who it was. It was his father, but Stewie could only help but wonder how he could have found this place on his own, not to mention Stewie in his new state. Stewie took a few steps closer to his father, being extremely cautious, not really knowing whose side his father was on, especially if he also found Megan's lifeless cadaver. Taking his last step forward, Stewie glared ominously at the man who he knew, hopefully scaring his dad off and into retreat.</br>
<br>Unfortunately his plan didn't work as his father still approached, only doing so slightly slower. He smiled toward Stewie, the beast, and walked up close enough to embrace.</br>
<br>"Well Stewie, I am definitely proud of you for finding the lost rings.</br>
<br>Stewie glared, still hoping to get rid of him, to continue what he was doing, only to find his dad later and turn him then.</br>
<br>"Stewie, you can drop that look of yours right now! It is not going to do any good with me young pup, I know who you are and more importantly I know what you are."</br>
<br>Stewie finally dropped his fasade, only to replace it by a look of wonderment, not sure of how his dad knew it was him.</br>
<br>"I know you are wondering how I knew who you were and what was going on and there is definitely an explanation. You see, much like you I am also a werewolf... by blood that is. You see, in my blood lays the gene for the werewolf and it was dormant in me, as it was in my father, and his father before him. Quite honestly, you are the first full fledged werewolf in the family, since... well... we locked that part of us away with these stones."</br>
<br>"So then when I stepped into the circle and read the print when Megan couldn't, I reactivated that part of our genes in me?"</br>
<br>"Yes, that is correct... and Megan honestly couldn't read the words. You see, she is a girl and women are not able to even contract the gene. Even though both of you are a combination between us, the werewolf gene is tied in with the Y chromosome of our sperm, so because she got an X chromosome, no werewolf gene and that is why she couldn't read it. Obviously because you are a male, you have the werewolf gene, you could read what was written in our werewolven language. Understand?"</br>
<br>Stewie simply nodded, really only understanding about half of what his dad said.</br>
<br>"You see son, the genetic marker was locked away in your blood, as well as mine. The key that unlocked it was of course the Wolven Rings. Son... I want you to bite me and activate the gene. Then we wll go out to slowly take over the town."</br>
<br>"Ok, but first I want you to tell me something dad, what should I do. Megan ran and hid when I took this form, then when I found her she had a witch's spell book and a crystal ball. She was going to read a spell to kill me, so in self defense I killed her first, then her blood got on the crystal ball and the ball absorbed the blood. When I got back here I read in the book that I could either absorb the power of the crystal ball making me and any person I turned into a werewolf, completely immortal an utterly invincible. It also said I could unite the power of the ball and the rings, tearing down the barrier between our world and of magic. What do you think dad?"</br>
<br>"Absorb the power of the crystal ball, become immortal and then make your first werewolf! The ball has both all the magic powers of a witch, but inside it was locked the true power of the werewolf. When you tainted it with human blood, the werewolf powers were awakened from its long slumber. An old witch, many centuries ago, took away our control and our immortality. From that moment on, it was our elder's decision to lock away the beast inside us until the day we could reclaim what was rightfully ours. Now, let's not waste any time. I long to be the creature I was meant to be since birth!"</br>
<br>Stewie and his father walked to the center ring. Stewie picked up the ball, tilted his head back and closed his eyes. The crystal ball radiated the blood red light, flowing into Stewie. An ominous and low growl could be heard as the light of the ball faded. Once the light was completely gone, Stewie opened his eyes and he returned to his head to it's neutral position. Before he could speak, the crystal ball cracked in half, then shattered into hundreds of tiny pieces.</br>
<br>"What do I do now dad?"</br></p>
