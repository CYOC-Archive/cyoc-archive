<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As we rode back to Morgana's I couldn't help but think about &quot;Queeny.&quot; Mostly because she wouldn't keep quiet, <br />
constantly humming or making rude noises with her armpit. At one point she sat on Morgana the toilet and <br />
proclaimed her a throne fit for a Queen. I admit her antics were amusing and I had to keep reminding myself <br />
who she really was to suppress my smile which made try to act the fool even more. Of course she had never been <br />
our real mother, who died when we were much too young to remember, but Rachel had raised us like her own <br />
children and I couldn't remember a time without her being there. Whilst father was off running the Kingdom we <br />
were taught to act with dignity and pride by her. She encouraged Andrew to become the brave Prince he was and <br />
was ever so proud of him. I'd looked up to her ass she taught me how a Princess should look and act. she <br />
dressed me in the nicest clothes and taught me how to dance. It wasn't until I matured that I rebelled against <br />
her a bit. I'd always thought she was intelligent and that me and her could help father run the country as he <br />
was always so busy but she said no &quot;Kingdoms are for Kings&quot; and other such nonsense. It was around this time I <br />
learnt that she wasn't of noble birth and that made the way she acted so high and mighty seem all the more <br />
ridiculous and pretentious. Foolish. Now she was a fool through and through.<br />
<br />
 When Arn complained of being too cold Queeny stepped up and gently pulled a piece of material from her ear. <br />
She kept pulling further and further  and the tiny piece of pink material grew larger and larger as it came <br />
out further from her head. Giving one last tug Queeny freed the clothing from her head shook it, holding it in <br />
front of her. It was a garish pink and yellow dress in a similar diamond pattern to Queeny's own attire. The <br />
hem was frilly and childish but Arn had little choice but to wear it. Dissatisfied and uncomfortable, Arn made <br />
the mistake of asking &quot;What about underwear?&quot; and Queeny quickly pulled a cotton diaper from behind her back. <br />
In a moment she'd knocked Arn onto her back and raised her legs into the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey, watch it. No I don't need to wear those!&quot; Arn protested.<br />
&quot;Hush little girl you've already made one mess and we wouldn't want you to ruin such a pretty dress!&quot; Queeny <br />
said as she expertly diapered Arn. As she finished she pulled Arns head up and held it to her plentiful <br />
breasts.<br />
<br />
We finally arrived at Morganas house in the woods. It took both me and Arn to carry Morgana the toilet into <br />
the house. I immediately got to work trying to find any spell that might help in her books while Arn went to <br />
look for less humiliating clothes. She returned shortly after complaining she couldn't take off her diaper. <br />
One problem at a time Arn. We continued looking through the spell books, even Queeny seemed to help. Soon my <br />
concentration was interrupted by a terrible smell. I looked at Arn accusingly who protested &quot;It wasn't me.&quot; <br />
There was a loud flushing sound  and we turned to see a bare bottom Queeny standing over Morgana. I was angry <br />
at her for acting such a fool &quot;Get away from there. You aren't helping!&quot; I pulled her by the wrists.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo Is Sara going to spank?&quot; she asked and my anger was such that I didn't even register the taunt. she'd <br />
been nothing but trouble and wasn't even trying to fight what I thought were foolish compulsions like she had <br />
when she first came to us in the jail. I sat and pulled her over my knee. Spanking her until her bottom was <br />
red.<br />
&quot;That's it. Yeeouch! Let... uhn... It... Out&quot; She said between smacks on her bottom. She seemed to be in pain <br />
and excited at the same time. Admittedly, I was quite excited too. I spanked her because I was annoyed with <br />
her lack of shame. I spanked her because she kept flaunting her body at me. I spanked her because she could <br />
see right through me. I spanked her because I felt ashamed and I couldn't admit to myself that a part of me <br />
envied her lack of decency, shame or regret. I spanked her because a part of me was attracted to her and other <br />
women. I stopped.<br />
&quot;Do you feel better now, lost little lamb?&quot; She asked and I nodded.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Soon we found a potion that looked hopeful and we carefully mixed the ingredients. Maedel and the guards <br />
arrived just in time to witness us pour in the last ingredient and the potion was ready. I stood over Morgana <br />
and poured it into her mouth. We all held our breath in anticipation. Morgana might thank us for changing us <br />
back or she may have us turned into toilets for using her like one. We had to take the chance. We waited for <br />
the change to begin. It didn't. Maedel opened up the book, her finger tracing through the ingredients.<br />
&quot;It needs one more thing,&quot; she said, &quot;a kiss with feeling...&quot;<br />
<br />
A mischievous smile crept over Queeny's face and she pushe me by the back of the head towards the toilet. <br />
Maedel, realizing the plan held my arms and helped push me down.<br />
&quot;What? I don't have feelings for Morgana! this is ridiculous!&quot; I cried, embarrassed.<br />
&quot;Pucker up Princess&quot; said Queeny as she squashed my cheeks toghether, forcing my lips out into a cartoonish <br />
shape of a kiss.<br />
As my lips touched the seat glittering sparks of light filled the air around the toilet and soon Morgana was <br />
squatting where the toilet had sat. Her head tilted up. Lips puckered for a kiss from me.</p>
