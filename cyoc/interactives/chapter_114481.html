<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I...I...don&#39;t feel well,&quot; Harold said weakly, the change going through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh...&quot; Virginia said as she helped Harold into the house.  &quot;It&#39;s going to be all right.  There&#39;s been a bit of an accident, and I need to take care of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going to happen to me?&quot; he asked as she carried him up the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to change soon, and I&#39;m going to help you.&quot;<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Meanwhile, Melissa spent the rest of her day in classes, thinking about the choices before her.  She was really interested in becoming a werevixen, but the idea of mourning if her soulmate died really turned her off on the idea.  She was definitely warming up to being a werecow to be with Trevor, but she hadn&#39;t given up on the idea of being a werevixen.  She sighed as she came to a realization that she needed a bit more information.  It would seem the impass between her brain and her heart still wasn&#39;t resolved.<br />
<br />
Melissa waited till the end of the school day before she approached Megumi.  &quot;Megumi?&quot; she asked as Megumi turned towards Melissa.  &quot;Is that offer still open?  To speak with your grandmother?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megumi smiled and said, &quot;Sure.  We can walk to my home together.&quot;  The two left the school to head towards the Tachibana home.  <br />
<br />
While the two were walking, Melissa started to ask, &quot;Um...Megumi...can I ask you a rather personal question?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megumi turned towards Melissa and said, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t see why not?  Considering what we&#39;ve been through, if it&#39;ll help, I&#39;ll answer anything I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...um...&quot; Melissa brushed a little of her hair away as she continued, &quot;Have you and Trevor...you know...gone all the way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, well, um...&quot; Megumi started, looking around quickly, &quot;Well, when a bunch of heterosexual boys and a bunch of heterosexual girls get together, and they&#39;re all weres, well, things happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...ok...&quot; Melissa said, her face starting to get a little red, &quot;Have you ever...had sex with him as a werebull...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...Ah!&quot; Megumi exclaimed, finally getting to what Melissa was asking.  &quot;Let me put it to you this way.  When it comes to werebulls, they tend to be a bit big.  But when it comes to werevixens, we can be a bit...stretchy.&quot;  Melissa&#39;s face went even redder as she heard this.  Megumi simply laughed and said, &quot;Man, Mel, you get flustered real easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa bumped into Megumi with a bit of a grin saying, &quot;Well, it&#39;s all your fault.&quot;  Before long, the two reached the Tachibana home and Megumi opened the gate, inviting Mel inside.  The two went to a room with a simple table, and Megumi left to get her grandmother.<br />
<br />
Megumi returned with a Japanese woman with streaks of silver.  &quot;Mel, I&#39;d like to introduce you to my grandmother, Tachibana no Akane.  Grandmother, I&#39;d like you to introduce you to Melissa Jenkins.  She has a few questions about being a werevixen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane smiled and said, &quot;Of course, dear.  Please, have a seat.&quot;  The three of them sat around a table before continuing.  &quot;What is it that you wanted to ask me about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve been trying to decide whether to be a werecow or a werevixen, and there&#39;s something that I wanted to ask about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane smiled kindly and said, &quot;Go on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Melissa said as she paused to think carefully.  &quot;Megumi told me about the special bonds that werefoxes form with their mates, and how loyal they are to each other.  She also told me what happens when their mates die and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Akane interrupted.  She gave a brief sigh, &quot;It is true that foxes form bonds so deep and so strong that virtually nothing can break them.  And when their mates die, it is also true that we do not seek new mates.&quot;  Akane paused as she gathered her thoughts, her lips going taut.  &quot;I loved my husband very much, and we shared a bond deeper than even the greatest of romance stories.  When my husband died so many years ago, I was indeed saddened by it.  I would be lying if I said that I was not saddened by it.  Even now, I miss him, and I look forward to the day when I can join him in the great den in the sky.&quot;  Melissa&#39;s lips pursed when she heard this.  &quot;However, in the time since, my grief has not stopped me from enjoying life.  Every time that I see my children and my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren, I see a little bit of my husband, and it fills me with such joy.  How happy it makes me to see my family.  And it has not slowed me down.  I am still involved with my skulk, and with the town.  My grief has not tied me down, but rather, it has made me appreciate what I do have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Melissa said as she thought about what she heard.  This was quite different from the way her father has grieved.  &quot;So, should I join the skulk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My child,&quot; Akane said softly as she placed her hand on Melissa&#39;s, &quot;I can not answer that for you.  That is only for you to answer.  I would give you this part of wisdom.  Many people come here to Moon Lake, and they change for different reasons.  Some change because they have no choice, and their choice was taken away from them.  It saddens me when I hear that, as they rarely ever fully accept who they have become.  Others change because they like the beast they become.  While they often find happiness, it is far too often they also find regret.  Some change because of who they love.  There is nothing wrong with this, and they often find joy and happiness throughout their lives.&quot;  Akane smiled at Melissa before she continued, &quot;However, the greatest of joy is when a person becomes something that reflects who they are on the inside.  There is great harmony with who they are on the inside and who they are on the outside that they experience the greatest happiness.  Whatever you decide you do, I would encourage you to follow whichever path brings you the greatest joy and happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa thought about her words and said, &quot;That&#39;s really helpful.  Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane smiled before the meeting was interrupted by a servant coming into the room and whispering something into her ear.  Akane frowned deeply and said quietly, &quot;I see.  That is most disappointing.&quot;  She turned towards Melissa and said, &quot;I am sorry, dear.  I have just been told that there has been a Statute 1A situation.  I am afraid that I am needed elsewhere.&quot;  When she said this, Tachibana no Akane left the room.<br />
<br />
Melissa turned to Megumi and asked, &quot;What&#39;s Statute 1A?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megumi thought for a moment, and then replied, &quot;It means that a normal&#39;s been turned without consent.  Grandmother&#39;s on the council, and she gets involved when this happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...&quot; Melissa started as she started to think, &quot;A normal?  Like me or my dad?&quot;  Megumi nodded her head.  Melissa got worried as she looked around.  She knew she was still normal so that left...  &quot;I need to get back home,&quot; she said quickly as she got up from the table.</p>
