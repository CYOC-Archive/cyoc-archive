<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leonard hooked both girls up to a special device. It was similar to the normal blood pressure measuring device, except it now seemed to collect the data from both girls at once. &quot;When merged, most of your body functions sync up. This includes things like your pulse, blood pressure, a few certain hormonal and chemical fluctuations that are tied to various emotional responses such as when you get aroused or angry, and even your breathing to an extent becomes synchronized. Of course depending on the situation, that may not always be the case, such as if Jen just bounced a great distance, she may be a bit winded, while you Rachel wouldn&#39;t be. So we take both of your tests at the same time while you are bonded in order to check how synchronized you are to each other. And from this test right now I can see that both of your heart rates and blood pressures are 100% in sync with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s kind of cool. I didn&#39;t realize that there was so much more to this whole bonding thing that happens when I sit on Jen&quot; honestly said Rachel. She knew why bonding was even a thing, but the details of it were never layed out back then.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is the beauty of this. There is so much yet that we still have left to discover and learn about bouncerbutts!&quot; said Leonard enthusiastically. &quot;Now Rachel, I would assume that as a female rider, you are currently bearing fruit in your womb, correct? Could you tell me what kind of fruit it is exactly?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Watermelon. Just 1 melon per day, but it is a pretty big melon.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Watermelon? Interesting. That is quite the sizable fruit. Certainly the largest I have on record currently. Do you think you could bring me one at full size sometime so I can both weight it as well as measure its dimensions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have one right now inside of me if you want it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You do? That would certainly explain the sudden abdominal swelling you somehow got overnight. Yes please, I would be happy to receive it for research and tracking it in your medical records.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel got off of Jen once again, and just removed her thong and skirt entirely, stuffing them back into Jen&#39;s apron. She would be giving birth to a melon infront of him, so why should she let being seen with only a top on bother her at this point. Plus she much rather preferred the unobstructed bonding of her and Jen&#39;s asses. <br />
<br />
After about half a minute of pushing and moaning, the melon was out of her once again. Jen picked it up and handed it to Leonard carefully while a few of her other tentacles picked Rachel up completely and placed her back on top of her booty. This action was not unnoticed by Leonard either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, if I may. From 0 to 10, with 0 being completely fine and content, how stressful is it to have Rachel on top of you?&quot; Asked Leonard curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I guess 0.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if she is just standing next to you, but still touching you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then maybe a 3 at least, but if for a long time, then higher.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if she isn&#39;t touching you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely a 5 at least after about 30 or so seconds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if she is not right next to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we still in the same room, is she far away, and is there anything between us, like furniture or a divider wall where I cant see her?&quot; Asked Jen, sounding just a slight bit tense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes to all 3?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;10.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;10? That is the highest you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then 11.&quot; Jen insisted.&quot;Huh&quot; said Leonard as he jotted it down. He then asked Rachel the same and she replied with the exact same numbers. <br />
<br />
&#39;That wasn&#39;t too surprising though, as what Jen feels, typically should be how Rachel feels as well, if the recent studies proved to be true. But for just a lack of visibility to bring both of them up to an 11/10 in terms of stress, maybe there was something going on here that was not yet observed? This is now 2 recorded cases so far of this, as earlier today, their two friends also said similar things, except they were even more dependent on being together, to the point Samantha wanted to always be in direct physical contact with Chiffon in some way. And that if she couldn&#39;t be, it was already reaching a 6 or 7. Probably should keep an eye on this for both pairs.&#39; Thought Leonard in his head. He and his wife could be apart for several hours, while he worked and she taught school, or stayed at home. A simple phone call or stopping by when he or she took lunch was all they needed to get through the day. Sure they felt some tension, but maybe a 2 at best, or 4 if they went the full workday with no contact.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about sleeping? Rachel, you don&#39;t sleep on top of Jen at night do you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No... but I do always end up spooning with her big booty.&quot; Answered Rachel, choosing to not mention how Jen tentacle fucks her to help get her to fall asleep each night.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. And you are not stressed too much by that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I would sleep on top of her if I could, but it isn&#39;t that easy to staying on her, and if I fall off, I could get hurt, so I sleep in a bed that was formed around one of those egg cup beds.&quot; Described Rachel.<br />
<br />
Leonard nodded his head. &quot;Well, you know that I have the exact same bed at home too. So I can agree with you that it is the ideal bed for bouncerbutts and rider couples to use. Anyways, aside from that last stress test, how do you girls feel? Any pain, complications, are you doing fine at night with your pipe Jen? How are things between you and the rest of your families? Stuff like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t complain. This has been the best few days of my life so far.&quot; Answered Rachel with a smile.<br />
&quot;I agree, I am very happy, and eating out of a trough is a lot of fun too.&quot; Jen added on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we are done here for now. Feel free to stop by the house whenever you want. Riley usually is there, if she is not at the school. Oh, and from now on, since you will be moving in near us, if you ever need something, I can just do a home visit for you. No need to literally haul your ass, all the way down to the clinic for something I can just walk a few hundred feet for.&quot; Offered Leonard, then let the bouncing duo out of his exam room and back into the main lobby.</p>
