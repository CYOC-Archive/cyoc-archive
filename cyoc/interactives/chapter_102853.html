<br />
The meet and greet went quite well at the Skulk meeting, and included a great deal of interest in conversation, and all four of the inductees knew it. The conversations were enjoyable and William got a first hand look at some of the flirting that Dawn had put on Martha earlier in the day. It wasn&#39;t bad or tasteless, but it was forward and let William know that Dawn was very interesting in seeing what was under Martha&#39;s dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is cut tight on you,&quot; Dawn commented as she looked over the dress that Martha was wearing, &quot;It&#39;s like you&#39;re one big present.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the dress was made to fit the normal me, not the were me,&quot; Martha gave a bit of a blush, &quot;the me with thinner hips, less of a butt, and smaller breasts. Now... I&#39;m bigger in all the right places.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That you are,&quot; William smiled to her and held Martha to him and then glanced to Dawn&#39;s husband, &quot;So... how long have you and Dawn been married?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About ten years,&quot; Douglas Hale answered and held Dawn to him, &quot;Dawn was the one who transformed me, and I can never think of anyone I&#39;d rather be with. And I&#39;ve always been open to allowing her to stay happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Open?&quot; William asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m bi-sexual,&quot; Dawn explained, &quot;rather rare... as most werefoxes are heterosexual, and Douglas has always been understanding. I&#39;ve bonded to him and always will be... but sometimes... I... I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fell the need for something different?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Dawn answered with a slightly embarrassed blush but also with a genuine smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... just between you and me,&quot; Martha pulled Dawn close for a moment, and then whispered so that even William could only just barely hear, &quot;the cat in me is very curious. If you&#39;re open... maybe we can work something out sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh!&quot; Dawn answered with some enthusiasm, &quot;I can bring Doug over and it can be a REAL party.&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas only smiled to his wife. William looked on with some interest and some puzzlement. His bond to Martha was firm and strong. If Martha wanted time with Dawn, he was more than okay with that. It would make sure that Martha remained comfortable with who she was and in a sense make up for his past unfaithfulness, but his bond also had him a bit uneasy with the issue of Douglas Hale being there. He was a werefox too, which meant he was likely just as bonded to Dawn as William was to Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;And... you&#39;re okay with this?&quot; William asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been a system that keeps Dawn happy and lets her enjoy the full breadth of her desires,&quot; Douglas answered, &quot;and last I checked I didn&#39;t have breasts of a vagina. If you&#39;re asking would I take your wife and you take mine, than no. Much of what has gone on in these sorts of get together has been more that we take our own respective mates while they kiss and massage one another.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dawn nodded, &quot;That&#39;s right, we don&#39;t break our bonds, but EVERYONE gets to have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Martha smiled, &quot;Will and I may have to take you up on that... though a bit more in advance than tonight... as our youngest and his girlfriend may be at the house for a little while after the ceremony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe tomorrow,&quot; Dawn mused, &quot;It&#39;s a Saturday and no school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...&quot; Martha commented, &quot;I do still have your number. I&#39;ll give you a call and we can set something up.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jenny and Harry meanwhile were grouped in another section of the room and had remained in conversation a bit longer with Tora Tachibana and his wife Keiko, as well as with Akane. In this, Harry and Jenny knew that they would be in Akane&#39;s den until Harry&#39;s brother&#39;s company could finish putting together the apartment for the two of them. Once that was done, they would transfer to Tora and Keiko&#39;s den.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really have to thank you all so much,&quot; Jenny spoke again, &quot;you&#39;ve provided so much for me when there has been no reason to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve had plenty of reasons,&quot; Akane assured her, &quot;what Yvette Smith did was wrong and brought shame onto us by her actions. It is only right for us to show you that we are not like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again... thank you,&quot; Jenny answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what are your plans for the weekend?&quot; Keiko asked, &quot;I would like to talk about some of the flower designs for the wedding you want to use.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be something we can aim for Sunday,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;as we&#39;ll have a lot going on on Saturday with regard to getting our plans ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jenny nodded, &quot;Tomorrow we plan to meet with Harry&#39;s brother... a first meeting for me, and he can show us precisely what he wants to do with the apartment space he&#39;ll be putting in for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once THAT is set,&quot; Harry added, &quot;we hope to meet with the Baptist minister for the ceremony. Explain the plan for two ceremonies and try to discuss payment. We may need to get in contact with the Twists for some of that too... but that&#39;s at least the plan for Saturday, and hopefully we aren&#39;t bothering the minister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane and Keiko both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;That can be a lot,&quot; Keiko spoke slowly, &quot;but I would be more than happy to discuss the floral arrangements at any time. I do wish to avoid conflicting with your classes or with your therapy schedule. Sunday would be most agreeable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be great,&quot; Harry and Jenny both agreed as the sounds of the meeting began to break up.<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry did notice some of the other werefoxes begin to go home, though not without giving a polite wave or bowing to Akane as a sign of respect to their leader. He also noticed his parents approaching as well, looking a bit tired. Not exhausted, but certainly closer to being ready for bed than not. He had found that he and Jenny had gained a great deal of energy and easily stay active for longer and recovered easier, but then, there were a lot of things weres could do that normals could not, and his parents were both still normals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, I think it&#39;s getting late enough that we&#39;ll need to get going,&quot; Harry said to Keiko, &quot;If we could get your number and address... perhaps we can call you when we have the time to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Keiko nodded and began going through her purse to get some paper to write a note for Harry and Jenny on.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
As the meeting began to break up and people started going home for the night, the Anderson family managed to regroup together and began to get on to their own agenda and plans for the immediate future.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think that went well, mom, dad,&quot; Nate commented to William and Martha, &quot;and everyone seemed rather friendly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very friendly indeed,&quot; William commented, though mostly to Martha, and then looked around to the rest of the group, &quot;though it would appear that most everyone is starting to go home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate glanced and nodded. Many were beginning to leave for the night. In fact he even noticed the Harry and Jenny lead his parents out after giving a polite wave to Akane. Things were beginning to break up for the night, and as much as Nate liked the fruit punch that had been provided, he didn&#39;t want to stay there all night drinking it. He and Alex had their own plans for the weekend, which had included an idea of going out to the lake and the recreational area near the lake that was for weres. A good part of this gave Nate the hope for plenty of fun with Alex while they were out.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I think we&#39;re covered for tonight,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;So... I&#39;d suppose it&#39;d be alright if we made our own way out too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom... about earlier... when I asked about staying with Julie for the weekend?&quot; Eric spoke up.<br />
<br />
William and Martha traded glances. After a moment, both gave a proud and weak smile. Eric watched as both his parents approached him. William put a hand on Eric&#39;s left shoulder while Martha put a hand on his right shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as it is okay with Mrs. Stovall, we have no problem with it,&quot; William said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose there is no problem,&quot; Melissa commented, &quot;Eric might need to to pick up some spare clothing first, but so long as he and Julie are respectful and stay under control, I have no problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric smiled. William smiled back and then nodded and looked to Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I suppose we have no problem,&quot; William said to him, &quot;but remember to keep control of yourself and be polite in someone else&#39;s home. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Eric nodded. Part of what his father was probably hinting at was what he expected from his parents that they would want him to wait until he was sixteen before really becoming active sexually. Some of that might simply be William&#39;s wanting for his sons to be better than he was and some of it might simply be pretty standard parental behavior. Eric understood that, and he really didn&#39;t have any plan be active with Julie over the course of the weekend. They&#39;d already gone through plenty of that in the sense of his own transformation and then the completion of his transformation. There was plenty of other things that he could do with Julie.<br />
<br />
Eric soon felt both his parents hug him firmly. He felt his mother purr while his father held him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Always be happy my son,&quot; Martha said to him, &quot;My little man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha then looked up to Julie who looked back at her with a weak smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for bringing Eric out of shell,&quot; Martha said to her, &quot;thank you for making him happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love him, ma&#39;am,&quot; Julie spoke, saying the last word on reflex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha...&quot; Martha corrected, &quot;or &quot;mom.&quot; No ma&#39;ams, Ms. or Mrs. okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Julie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And remember to stay on your birth control pill,&quot; Martha instructed, &quot;Will and I may prefer that you both wait before being fully active with each other... but with everything that&#39;s happened, it isn&#39;t as though that there is a way to prevent you two from having your moments. We just ask that you don&#39;t turn William and I into grandparents until you&#39;re at least out of college.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie only nodded, as that line had mirrored what her own mother had said she wanted. She even agreed that she and Eric weren&#39;t ready for children of their own. She loved him and he was very much a dream come true, but they were both young and having children now would be too seen. She would wait until after she and Eric were legally married and settling into life on their own before she would talk with him about starting their own family.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;you don&#39;t have to worry about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, because your father and I aren&#39;t ready to be grandparents either,&quot; Melissa said to her, &quot;but we are all glad that you&#39;re happy and healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie nodded and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And so, with things at an end for the night, why don&#39;t we head home,&quot; William spoke, &quot;Eric can pick up some things from the house for the night and the rest of the weekend, Nate can collect his things for his weekend, and we&#39;ll go from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Given how tight Martha&#39;s dress fit on her, and actually made her look even better thanks to her new curves, William had some ideas about what he wanted to do, though he didn&#39;t want to say those ideas out loud. There were a few nods of agreement, and together they made their way out.</p>
