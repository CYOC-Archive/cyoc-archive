<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before he could even fully register the words that spun through his head Jeff was assaulted by a foul bitter taste. Jeff fell to his knees as he hacked and coughed through noxious fumes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cough...cough...pffffft...&quot; It was only at that final sound that the meaning of Riley&#39;s words hit him. Riley wanted a fatter ass and Jeff was about to step right into that role. Almost on cue Jeff&#39;s legs started moving on their own; marching him right out of the bathroom and straight into His and Riley&#39;s shared room. <br />
<br />
There Riley was waiting for him seemingly hypnotized; his ass out, bare, and pointed Jeff&#39;s way. <br />
&quot;Wait stop Riley please this is so nasty!&quot; Jeff screamed in protest as his own two legs betrayed him and marched him closer to his doom. Riley said nothing in response, only a high pitched giggle escaping his daze. When Jeff finally reached his bare-bottomed roommate he lifted his foot and stepped into his ass-cheek. Jeff cringed in fear, as his foot seemed to slip into the globe of flesh; almost like stepping into a vat of butterscotch pudding.<br />
<br />
Desperately Jeff started to flail what few parts of his body he remained in control of, in a pathetic last ditch effort to retain his personal sovereignty. It was to no avail however as more and more of his leg disappeared into an unresponsive Riley. Jeff&#39;s other leg came up now; almost as if to insult him for even attempting to resist and, plunged itself into the other cheek.<br />
<br />
 With an unceremonious thump Jeff lost his balance and fell to the floor as he dangled out of Riley&#39;s pasty gamer ass. Jeff lay there with his face on the floor and tears trailing down his cheeks slowly being sucked into the ass like a lone spaghetti noodle. <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t hurt, though it was incredibly uncomfortable. As more and more of him sunk in, Jeff lost feeling in those parts. He could no longer actually feel either of his feet or ankles, but in their place a new feeling was coming online. A jiggling bouncy sensation as Jeff&#39;s nerves integrated into Riley, and more and more of his being was melted into booty meat.<br />
<br />
It took a full half hour for Jeff to get pulled in up to his neck. The pizza delivery guy had come and gone leaving their... Now just Rileys dinner there on the desk. Jeff had pleaded with the man to help; but he just muttered something about it being too dangerous to interfere, and left the two of them alone. Jeff had long since given up on calling for help. Now he just sobbed in defeat, as his head followed where the rest of him had gone. <br />
<br />
The two enormous cheeks seemed to tower over and dominate everything as Jeff&#39;s head sunk into their crack. Jeff&#39;s lips had already turned brown and puckered as his mouth became Riley&#39;s rectum. Much to Jeff&#39;s dismay he retained his tongue however and he felt something in the back of his throat that he deduced was Riley&#39;s prostate. The poor ass&#39;s eyes and nose shrank down further and settled in Riley&#39;s taint. <br />
<br />
As the last of the excess Jeff melted into Riley’s now much plumper derriere The femboy’s ball sack drooped down enveloping Jeff’s view, sealing him into his new home in the femboy’s undercarriage. With a final whimper of defeat Jeff passed out. <br />
<br />
A few hours later Riley awoke groggily in his bed with his face down and ass pointed skyward. “Damn what had happened?” he thought to himself as he sat up on his plush bubble-butt. Wait… that&#39;s not right Riley’s flat ass was his greatest shame as a femboy. With a sudden burst of energy Riley jumped out of bed and ran to his mirror. In it he beheld a booty that would put even the greatest porn-stars to shame.<br />
<br />
The jubilant femboy squealed in delight as he struck a few poses and snapped some pics. Giggling he squeezed his fat new ass. With a sharp thwack he gave it a smack and was surprised to hear a whimper of pain in response. <br />
“Oh my God, Jeff!” Riley shouted wide eyed as he finally put two and two together. “Jeff, you&#39;re my ass!”<br />
<br />
“Mmmph…” was all Jeff was able to muster up in response. His mouth had started to fill with Riley&#39;s next bowel movement. A solid turd slowly pushes its way into Riley&#39;s rectum, and in turn into Jeff&#39;s reluctant mouth. He could already taste it at the back of his tongue. A foul, earthy, bitter, sensation that made the helpless derriere sick to his now no longer existent stomach. Jeff wanted nothing more than to throw up right then and there, but that wasn&#39;t his function. Jeff was Riley&#39;s ass and Riley was by no means incontinent. Jeff would get his relief when Riley needed it, not him; and so the poor little booty found his lips involuntarily held shut. Jeff wondered in distraught silence just for how long he would have to sit back there sucking on Femboy shit.<br />
<br />
 Not that Riley seemed to notice or care. He was too busy trying to get a good picture of Jeff. The gamer boy was currently lying on his back with his legs contorted up in the air. Doing this he was able to finally get a decent shot of Jeff&#39;s pathetic face plastered on his taint. *snap* Riley frowned as he inspected the pic; if he&#39;d want a good shot then he&#39;d have to do a better job shaving. Still even with a few errant pubes sticking out of Jeff&#39;s face Riley wasn&#39;t about to throw away the first pic of him and his butt. He&#39;d have to send the pic to the group chat when he had a chance but first… *pfffftt*<br />
<br />
“Ah” Riley sighed in relief as the dorm room&#39;s air became tainted with the aroma of his bowels. “That must be why you&#39;re so quiet huh? Can&#39;t talk with your mouth full can you booty?” Riley snickered as his best friend was currently reeling from being used to release his gas. While Jeff was currently struggling through his fart induced daze Riley was on the move. It wasn&#39;t until he saw the tile of the bathroom floor that Jeff was aware of what was in store for him. <br />
<br />
Riley absent-mindedly hummed to himself as he sat on his toilet. The cold toilet seat sent a pleasant shiver up his spine upon contact with his brand-spanking-new bubble-butt. As for the bubble-butt in question however was a different story entirely.<br />
<br />
 The toilet water below him signaled the moment he had been dreading ever since he first started to change. He hung there above it in a moment that felt like it would go on forever only to be broken by the sound of a light trinkle. Steadily as Riley&#39;s golden piss drained out of his flaccid cock it stained the water below him a pale yellow. Oddly enough a part of Jeff felt contempt for Riley’s dick, it had it so easy after all not like him who had to work so much harder… No! Jeff mentally slapped himself. It had only been a few hours and he was already starting to think like a butt. <br />
<br />
*pfffftt* Jeff&#39;s inner turmoil was unceremoniously interrupted by the sudden burst of gas forced out of his lips. *pffffttthhhh* Quickly followed by another. *brrrp* And another as Riley strained above him to release his backed up bowels. The Femboy’s butthole felt his mouth completely filled with shit now. It was a creamy load; the kind that could use more fiber, and did taste faintly of chicken tendies: Riley’s favorite food. Although only faintly the vast majority of the flavor profile was absolutely shit, shit, and more shit. It seemed like transforming actually didn&#39;t do anything to alter tastes. After all Jeff&#39;s mouth now existed for the express purpose of storing and passing his best friend&#39;s waste taste didn&#39;t really factor into his ability to do that. <br />
<br />
Speaking of passing waste Jeff found his lips finally forced open by the oncoming mass of butt fudge. Like soft serve ice cream it coiled and snaked out before breaking off and landing with a *plop* in the piss stained water below. The resulting splash-back hit Jeff square In the face. Not that he could care at this point. He was currently massaging a load of gamer-boy waste in his mouth. He hardly had the energy left to devote to being grossed out by some pissy water.<br />
<br />
Another log broke free from Jeff&#39;s lips, as he bit down on it to split it in two. Or rather Riley split it with his sphincter muscles; Jeff&#39;s body wasn&#39;t exactly his to control anymore.<br />
<br />
 Riley absent-mindedly scrolled through tik-tok as he continued to fill the toilet below him. He wasn&#39;t oblivious to Jeff&#39;s struggles in fact he knew he&#39;d be having a rough go of it. But that&#39;s just natural for newly transformed objects and it wasn&#39;t like he had much of a choice otherwise. What was he going to do? Hold in his shit forever? No each burst of gas, each log of shit, each plop in the toilet was ripping off a band aid. Riley knew it was his duty to make sure his best friend could be the best butt he could be and that meant carrying on as normal to better help him adjust. <br />
<br />
For Jeff however, hanging above the toilet it felt like he&#39;d been abandoned. The only thing he was hearing from Riley was the occasional strained grunt as he Forced another log through him. Finally the last bit of shit was making its way through his mouth. Jeff, scared it might end up stuck there, tried his best to push it along with his tongue. *pffffft* Jeff spit up the final piece of Poop and found himself panting heavily. “Is… is it over?”<br />
<br />
Riley answered Jeff with a wad of toilet paper roughly scrubbed in his face. It took a few sheets but eventually the femboy wiped his friend clean. “Yeah it&#39;s over. You did such a good job. You&#39;re such a good booty.” <br />
<br />
“That was awful” Jeff whined “Riley, please you have to find a way to turn me back.” Riley was standing up now. “Shhhh.” He shushed his rear as he gently cupped one of his cheeks. “It&#39;s okay Jeff the first was always going to be the worst but it&#39;ll get easier I promise. And you know there&#39;s no reversal not for a human body part. That technology is decades away.” The words did little to comfort the booty but in his mind he knew it to be true. As his rear quietly sobbed, Riley looked at the massive load of human dung in the toilet and briefly thought about taking a picture to commemorate Jeff&#39;s first time but decided against it. After all, who would want a picture of shit just sitting on their phone. He thought, as he flushed away the most traumatic thing to ever happen to his best friend.<br />
<br />
When Riley walked back to their room Jeff was still whimpering. “Tell you what Jeff I know just the thing to make you feel better.” Riley optimistically said. There wasn&#39;t much Jeff could imagine that would make this easier, but there was little he could do and so he pensively asked. “What?”<br />
<br />
Riley didn&#39;t answer him right away instead he was fiddling with something on his dresser. Jeff got his answer when Riley suddenly moved into a deep squat and a lube covered butt plug came into view. “Don&#39;t worry Jeff in my experience butts love butt plugs so just open wide…” the metallic plug was now moving ominously towards Jeff&#39;s mouth. “Wait Riley I don&#39;t think I&#39;m re…” <br />
<br />
Jeff found himself cut off by the cold sensation of the plug being gently but steadily pushed into him. It was slow at first and the plug was probably a little too big for Jeff&#39;s first time but Riley persisted. Occasionally taking deep breaths as he worked Riley managed to fully shove the plug into his bro&#39;s awaiting mouth. <br />
<br />
The time Jeff would be able to speak was now cut short by the invading plug and foul tasting lubricant. Jeff almost preferred the taste of feces That still coated the inside of his mouth… almost. Jeff did have to admit though there was something strangely comforting about the plug.  It was almost like a pacifier and Jeff found that it was helping keep focused and keep his mind off things.<br />
<br />
With Jeff firmly plugged up Riley to one final look In the mirror to see Jeff obscured by the pink heart shaped gem that adorned the base of the plug. His eyes strained as they focused on the toy in his mouth. Giggling Riley took one final pic before throwing on a pair of boxer briefs and shorts. Sealing his best friend in. <br />
<br />
Riley settled down in his gaming chair with the now cold pizza and started up a game of rocket league. He had never been very good at it but it was his butt&#39;s favorite game and he hoped the sound would comfort him. In a way it did. Underneath the layers of Riley&#39;s shorts and underwear with his face cushioning his seat and mouth firmly plugged up Jeff found The muffled sounds of the game surprisingly comforting. Yeah his place in life had drastically changed over night but now in a way he was still gaming with his bro.<br />
<br />
After a few matches Riley checks his phone and sees the pictures he took of Jeff. With a mischievous grin he decides to post the pics to…</p>
