<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff reclined on the bed, unsure of exactly what was happening. Without thinking, she slowly stripped her pants away, already loose from the rejuvenating effects of the Chronivac. Her panties, something she would never have personally thought to wear, were discarded soon after. She stared up to Paul who loomed over her with a mischievous grin plain on his face.
</br>
</br>
"I...," Jeff started. <i>I don't think we should do this. I changed my mind. I am your son, Jeff. I am not Grace,</i> her mind screamed. She should say something, but there was a yearning building up in her. Her eyes roamed his youthful body, a body not much unlike the one he possessed only hours ago. Paul began to lean over her, his hand coming up to lightly cup her chin. His lips pressed in then, stopping anything that Jeff was possibly going to say. His tongue was a soft, wet thing that explored her, pressing in and igniting the fire inside of her.
</br>
</br>
Paul pulled away, his pleasure evident. "Do you remember those days, Gracie? The two of us? Reckless, wild?" His hands scooped her up, grabbing her ass and tossing her further down the bed as he collapsed on top of her. Jeff had never felt so light in her life. To be moved aside as easily as that left her feeling small and... powerless. That feeling of control that she had with her mother had flown out the window as she lay beneath Paul, his body controlling her every move. As if reading her mind, Paul grabbed her wrists, forcing them down as his mouth began to nibble and kiss at her neck.
</br>
</br>
"J...just... fuck me, Paul. Goddammit, fuck me," Jeff whispered into his ear.
</br>
</br>
Paul paused to look down at Jeff curiously. "You always complained that I didn't pay enough attention to foreplay." His smile proved to Jeff that he was in control. She knew, and she loved it. Paul took her wrists in his left hand and held them down to the bed, above her head while his right roamed across her stomach. The light touches drew ecstatic moans from Jeff. Jeff was still a virgin, in his former life, that is. At this point, he didn't know what to think or how to act. He just gave up all control and let his body react to Paul. While the thoughts flitted through her mind, Paul's hand found its way between her thighs. This drew a low moan from Jeff who wasn't ready for her nerves to suddenly light with electricity.
</br>
</br>
"Damn, Gracie," Paul marveled, "I don't think you were ever this wet." His fingers danced across her clit as he started to bring his hips between her creamy thighs.
</br>
</br>
"No, no," was all Jeff could mutter. Her mind was on fire as the pleasure rolled over her. She couldn't imagine going any further while her body still shook beneath her. <i>Much less,</i> Jeff mused, <i>I'm actually going to fuck for the first time and it'll be me getting my father's cock up my mother's cunt. This just can't be happening. I can't want this!</i> But for all of her anguish, she knew that she really did. She couldn't fight the yearning any more.
</br>
</br>
And just as suddenly, Paul eased his cock into Jeff. His thick member pushed her apart, as her cunt took him all the way in. Her moist pussy was more than ready to take all of him and before long Paul was thrusting into Jeff as his balls slapped against her newly youthened ass. Jeff, for her part was completely lost to the world. Noises escaped from her mouth that were halfway between a murmur and a squeal as her father slammed his dick back and forth into her. The warmth of him filled her as she felt her cunt constrict around him trying to feel more and more of his power. She had never felt so full in her life and she couldn't help but to want even more.
</br>
</br>
Suddenly, Jeff was pulled up, still speared on Paul's rigid cock as he grabbed her and hefted her into the air. They fucked for a moment like that, her legs wrapped desperately around his waist, her head thrown back as her radiant hair whipped against her. He seemed to go deeper as she was held there, immobile. A feeling began to grow inside of her, as though she was just a thin shell of a creature only meant to house this intense pressure. She knew that she could hold on no longer and the shell that was her would eventually erupt. Even as she thought this, it happened. Her shoulders locked up and her mouth looked for purchase on Paul's face as her breath came on short and ragged. Her hips were moving on their own accord as the orgasm began to grip her entire body. She chewed at Paul's lips as she moaned into his face, begging wordlessly for freedom.
</br>
</br>
They held each other there for a moment, her legs locked around his back and her head nestled against his bare chest. Paul buried his face in Jeff's hair, his large hands firmly holding her ass. "That...," she breathed, <i>...was wrong, was my first time, was incredible, was... Fuck!</i> "That was amazing, dad." Paul's eyebrows shot up in surprise before Jeff quickly added, "Daddy. That was amazing, daddy."
</br>
</br>
"Well, my little whore," Paul chuckled, "we aren't finished yet." He threw Jeff to the bed and flipped her onto her knees. Again, Jeff couldn't help but feel small in his hands. "I still need to finish and I think I know just the cunt to finish in." Without warning, Paul's cock plunged into Jeff's pussy once more while his hands wrapped around her ass, pulling her back into his thrusts.
</br>
</br>
Jeff couldn't even think any more as the pleasure numbed her muscles. Her face lay on the bed, a moan rising from her as her father pumped her tight cunt back and forth. The feeling of his balls slapping against her clit made her squirm as another orgasm began to build. Beneath Paul's hands, her ass jiggled as the flesh flowed over his thick digits. A quick swat of his hand made a resounding crack and brought a yelp from Jeff below. The hand reached out lightning fast to grab at Jeff's hair, tangling his fingers into the ruby locks. He pulled back as he thrust deeper into Jeff's cunt. She squeezed around him in turn, loving the abuse and rewarding his power.
</br>
</br>
"Call me daddy!" Paul shouted.
</br>
</br>
"Ohhhh, fuck! Fuck me, daddy!" Jeff said, an unconscious part of him mortified at the irony of it all. "I'm gonna... I'm gonna fucking cum!"
</br>
</br>
As Jeff's cunt tightened around Paul's cock, he, too began to cum. Hot cum sprayed into Jeff's pussy as Paul continued to thrust, his rhythm slowed from the intensity. Paul pulled his cock out of Jeff and she shivered as her sensitive pussy felt the thick dick graze her folds. Not another word was spoken as the two collpased into Jeff's bed together. Sleep came quickly to the exhausted couple.
</br>
</br>
Jeff woke hours later, as she heard the front door slam. Nikki, her... well, his older sister, must have come home. <i>Well,</i> Jeff thought, <i>it was fun, but this has gotten just a little too... fucked up.</i> She made her way over to her computer, still nude and prayed that Nikki wouldn't take the time to come into her little brother's room. Jeff quickly pulled up her profile and found that she couldn't make any changes to her programming. <i>Oh, shit.</i> She quickly scanned over her profile and found it. <i>Oh, shit!</i> Paul had changed the duration to "0"... Permanent. <i>No, no, no, no! SHIT!</i> Jeff panicked as she stared over at her father, his cock flaccid and draped over his thigh.
</br>
</br>
<i>What the hell do I do now?</i></p>
