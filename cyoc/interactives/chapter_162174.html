<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking down at my own body, I saw something strangely familiar. It was a white porcelain bowl, filled with a small amount of water. A toilet. Trying to talk, to ask about what was going on and what had happened to me, I found myself unable to move at all. I felt trapped unable to even move an inch of my body. I felt like a statue, an inanimate object... then it began to dawn on me. I wanted to scream and to cry, but there was nothing that came out. <br />
<br />
I was, somehow, a toilet.<br />
<br />
Larry confirmed my suspicions. &quot;Unfortunately as a result of some complications during the surgery, we thought we had lost you for good. Many of the chemicals we had used to prepare the brain for the process were highly dangerous unless soaked, so we were forced at such short notice to flush it down our bathroom toilet. An unexpected side-effect of this is that we noticed that your neurons were still kicking, so we got to work and were able to connect your neutral systems and nerves to the toilet. We were even able to give you full sensitivity - visual, auditory, touch, smell, even taste. It&#39;s quite impressive if I do say so myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
*Easy for you to say. You&#39;re not in the body of a fucking toilet!* I wanted to say, but it was no use.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mom!&quot; Said my &#39;son&#39; David, coming up to me. &quot;Looks like I really got the better end of the deal here, huh? Glad I&#39;m not in your position right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry agreed. &quot;Indeed, it&#39;s quite difficult to understate how unlucky this situation is. Unfortunately, as you both signed an airtight waiver before coming in you&#39;ll be unable to sue. I hope the family will be okay with the mother of the house being a toilet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, doctor. I&#39;m sure you did your best.&quot; said David, putting one of his hands on the tank of my new body. I could feel his slightly-cold hands on me. It felt just like somebody was touching my skin, although that was a feeling I would never know again. I was a fucking toilet, a porcelain bowl usually used for getting rid of waste. I felt gross thinking of all the times this body of mine had been shit in or drank somebody&#39;s pee. I was terrified about the thought that somebody would use me that way now. It wasn&#39;t like there was any way I could stop them. But surely they wouldn&#39;t use me as a toilet, right? Their own mother? <br />
<br />
David continued. &quot;We&#39;ve just been having troubles with the bathroom in our house and could use a new toilet, so this was very convenient timing.&quot; The tone in his voice seemed too earnest to be joking. I tried to shake my body to protest, to flush or something, but I was totally helpless. After all, it was a miracle they were able to put me inside of here at all, and toilets weren&#39;t designed to be sentient in the first place. I was purely an inanimate object now, totally at the whims of my family. &quot;But, uh, doc? Do you mind giving me and my mom some alone time for a minute? Just to introduce ourselves again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Larry said, leaving the room and leaving me and my son alone. It was hard not to feel angry at my former mom. While she was living my old life, in my young male body, I was a toilet. I would never again know what it was like in my old body - hell, I would never know what it was like to be a human, or move, ever again. I suddenly felt like I had been ungrateful for my former autonomy. And worse, &#39;David&#39; appeared to be smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re a toilet now?&quot; He said, subtly mocking me. &quot;I always knew you were talking shit, mom, but I never realized you took it so literally.&quot; I couldn&#39;t believe the nerve. If I was his mother now, then there was no way he should have gotten away with talking to me like that. I watched her reach down, cupping his crotch through his shorts. &quot;It&#39;s so weird being in a guy&#39;s body now... I guess you must be dealing with a lot more than me, but it feels great being young again. And being in a young man is so exciting. I mean, I have a cock now.&quot; He reached into his pants and pulled out his average-sized floppy cock, something I had seen a million times before but had never imagined giving up like this. &quot;To think, 16 years ago you gave birth this body, and now you&#39;re a toilet and I&#39;m an active young guy.&quot; He began waggling it in my &#39;face&#39;, clearly enjoying his new member. &quot;And you know, one of the first things I was really excited to try as a guy was peeing standing up. Well, I&#39;ve had a lot of water since I woke up, so...&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, her tone of voice sounded like she was being serious, though I didn&#39;t actually think she would pee into my body. After all, that was crazy. I was his mom now. There was no way, right? Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t long before I saw him grab his penis and begin to relieve himself, golden streams spraying out and into my waiting bowl. &quot;Sorry mom, I just can&#39;t hold it in any longer. You&#39;re happy to help your own son with stuff like this, right?&quot; Instantly I could taste her grossly sour piss in my &#39;mouth&#39;, feeling myself filled up with her waste like a toilet was meant to do. It was humiliating realizing that, if anybody wanted to, they could treat me the same way, filling my body with their waste like a toilet was supposed to.<br />
<br />
Eventually he finished, and I was left staring at him with his cock out, shaking out the last few droplets before tucking it away. Mercifully he then flushed me, reaching forward and pulling my handle and allowing the water to shoot through the S-bend and fill with fresh water from my tank, only the lingering aftertaste of pee still in my mouth. Getting flushed was a slightly pleasurable sensation, I had to admit. But it *definitely* wasn&#39;t worth being turned into a toilet. &quot;Thanks mom.&quot; David said, &quot;But let&#39;s keep that between ourselves, right? Wouldn&#39;t want the researchers to find out that I just pissed inside of you.&quot; I felt angry and gross, since he knew there was nothing I could do now.<br />
<br />
A minute later the scientists came back in and sent my son outside to meet the family, while they prepared to remove my body and deliver me home again. I wondered what it would be like to be a stationary piece of furniture in my home again. To have my children, formerly my brothers and sisters, having to deal with their own mother as a toilet. At least I hoped they wouldn&#39;t use me for the purpose that my new body was built for.</p>
