<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I tried to minimize the nudity as best I could with the impending transformations.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Why is it I’m not freaking out?” Sarah looking about as she takes a bite of an apple she put on her plate. With Jessica, the two Den Mothers who were with the girl scouts when they were transported to this realm. Sitting next to centaurs as well as horses and human’s on the cusp of transforming, the two adult women should be freaking out but seem strangely calm; almost as if they accepted the inevitable.<br />
“I should be having a panic attack,” Jessica responding; &quot;but I’m not. Does this have anything to do with this goddess?”<br />
<br />
“The more there are of us,” a centaur sitting next to them; “the greater Epona’s powers are. It is her kind nature that is making you relaxed at your impending change.” The centaur shifting his frame to face the two; introducing himself as Bolt to the women in a middle of a conversation. The former horse now Centaur smiled as he explained how he transformed.<br />
“It was discomforting,” Bolt speaking; “suddenly growing a human torso where my neck was. I screamed as the changes ripped through me. It wasn’t outright painful, but it was jarring. Once it was finished,” Bolt answering; I felt exhausted and passed out. Eventually I coupled with my mate Daisy,” Bolt sensing her embrace around his torso as he talks to the den mothers; “afterwards I felt fully complete in both body and mind.”<br />
“Being a centaur is really freeing,” Daisy adding; “and as centaur mare you get some great fringe benefits.”<br />
“Like what,” Sarah putting down her fork full of venison; “are we talking about the lack of modesty down below?”<br />
“Let’s see you try and put pants on a thousand pounds of equine bulk,” Daisy rolling her eyes. “No, I’m referring to a lack certain biological complaints that you human girl’s frequently experience.”<br />
 <br />
“Periods,” Lucy chiming on the other side to the pair; “no monthly menstruation, no need for pads and tampons. “Just an uncontrollable urge to rut with your mate once you go into estrus,” Lucy smiling as she casts a glance at Ben who was currently at the buffet helping one of the boy scouts carry his plate full of food. “That stallion is excellent father material,” Lucy remarking; “I can’t wait for him to sire foals in me.”<br />
“You will enjoy your first time,” Bolt ripping a chunk of meat off of a rib bone; “the moment of coupling; it’s indescribable.”<br />
“Trust me,” Lucy licking her lips with desire; watching Ben head back to the buffet to grab a few mugs of water; playing waiter to several of the children along with Snow, Wendy and Lightning. “I can’t wait to for him to mount me and fill me,” Lucy feeling her marehood quivering with arousal.<br />
“It’s a pity Steve has taken a liking to the Horse next to him,” Jessica sighing; finding the scoutmaster for the boys rather attractive; “A tumble in the hay with him would be nice.”<br />
<br />
“How about we change the topic,” Lucy seeing one of the den mothers looking on longingly; “what did you do back in Oregon apart from volunteering to a scout troop?”<br />
“Human resources for the University of Oregon Portland,” Sarah welcoming the change in conversation; “You’d be surprised how nasty university faculty can be.”<br />
“I was a part of an Equestrian team,” Lucy answering; for a university; “so I have an ideal how teachers can act towards students that are no longer considered minors and considered fair game for sexual conquest. What about you Jessica,” Lucy asking; causing Jessica to become distracted from her gazing.<br />
“School teacher,” Jessica looking down at her plate and no longer feeling hungry; “the girls under our care all came from the public school I work at. I teach English,” Jessica pausing; “or at least I did.”<br />
“You can still do that,” Lucy looking at the woman whose brunette hair was wrapped in a tight bun; “these children will soon become centaur foals. They will need to be educated so a teacher is a job you can easily do here.”<br />
“Just don’t be surprised if your lessons are more practical,” Bolt half paying attention half playfully feeding Daisy; “I may have been a horse originally, but as a centaur, I still instinctively feel a desire to be outside unless the weather is unpleasant. I can sense that will be the same for the children.”<br />
“So outdoor lessons,” Jessica responding; “not exactly a bad thing. But what would be practical to teach to what are you referring the children as?”<br />
“Foals,” Daisy answering as she grins while giving Bolt a slice of apple as he stares at the children; “our offspring are foals. Daisy,” Bolt looking at his mate, I can’t wait for mating season so I can plant my seed and watch your belly swell with our first foal. But I would like for us to adopt one of the children into our home,” Bolt watching a few talk; “it feels right to be a parent to these foster foals.”<br />
“I’d like that too,” Daisy smiling. &quot;And I sense both Wendy and Snow are feeling those motherly urges as well,&quot; Daisy adding as she watches her fellow herd sisters coo over the children as they stuff themselves silly with food. <br />
<br />
Jessica turned to look at Sarah and sighed; seeing her fellow den mother shrug her shoulders as she slowly goes pack to picking at her plate of food. Then it happened the first scream of the evening making everyone stop what they were doing. Jessica watches as two Centaurs calmly get up from sitting on the ground and walk to where the disturbance was.<br />
“It has begun,” the centaur calmly speaking as he crouches and assists the female removing the clothing save for the person’s shirt. “Take it easy, we are here and will help you,” he comments as he positions himself to allow Aiko a small bit of modesty as her now exposed woman hood transitions in the teardrop vulva of a mare out of the eyes of prying children eager to watch.<br />
“Thank you Chris,” Aiko gasping; “I had no ideal this would be intense.”<br />
<br />
“Ahhhhh!”<br />
Everyone’s attention on Aiko is turned to see the horse next to her; a tan furred Mustang with back fur on his legs fall to his side as he starts to groan.<br />
“It always comes in two,” Amanda speaking; kneeling down to offer comfort to the startled stallion. “Don’t be afraid,” Amanda rubbing the horse’s flank; “the discomfort will not last.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone stood stock still as they watched Aiko’s legs bend and stretch. The sound of bones popping and cracking as they reform to the hind legs of a horse, sounded un-nerving to the halflings watching. All but Jackson stared transfixed as Aiko’s rear started to stretch and expand. Barreling out as an extra set of appendages start to grow. They quickly grow to be her new forelegs as her once human feet fully turn into ivory white hooves. Aiko’s new equine half take on a dark chestnut brown fur while her hooves up to her equine ankles and elbows explode with pure white shaggy looking fur. Her new musculature implies she has the lower half of a shire horse. Chris doing his best to help steady Aiko, he couldn’t help but notice the Japanese girl’s upper torso looking buff and toned. She exhales loudly; both sets of lungs heaving as the pain slowly fade away.<br />
“Fuck that was intense,” Aiko swearing as her eyes flutter and she passes out.<br />
<br />
“Aiko,” the horse crying out as the fur on his neck flakes off while humanoid proportions begin to take shape. Filling out his new burgeoning frame, the soon to be mustang centaur had a bronzed skin complexion. His muzzle reshaping to a more human looking face; while newly forming arms begin to move, the fingers flexing as the new male centaur opens his eyes. Originally a deep brown; his eyes are now a brilliant blue as strawberry blonde hair grows; mixing with the silver mane that now runs down the middle of his new back.<br />
“She is okay,” Chris looking at the newest member of the Haras; “Aiko will be okay. She needs some rest.”<br />
“That’s good,” Helios smiling as he closes his eyes and passes out.<br />
<br />
“Cool,” a teenage boy shouts as the two new centaurs lay on the ground unconscious. “Will they start mating once they are awake?”<br />
“Not in public,” Lighting approaching the exuberant child; “and only if they have the energy after they wake up. The change takes a lot out of you.”<br />
“Which is why I’m insisting,” Chris trotting to the child crouching to stare at him with a smile; “you all eat hearty. “Once you wake up you’ll have two stomachs to fill and will feel hungry afterwards.”<br />
“Seconds and thirds,” Another teenager getting up; “I hope I get a shiny coat of black fur for my horsey half.”<br />
“Epona might grant you that if you pray and speak from your heart,” Lighting nodding; turning around to see Jackson was the only one to have his back turned. The sheriff deputy and volunteer scout master for a troop in Vermont, knew it was only a matter of time before Epona made good on her word to turn him into a Centaur mare. A punishment for insulting the goddess in her church.<br />
<br />
“As you can see,” Lightning approaching the man who has yet to eat; “both moons are up, and the sun has set.” Lighting removing the ropes that bind the man’s hands together. “Please get something to eat,” Lighting encouraging the man to join the group; “it will make things easier.”<br />
“How would you know,” Jackson rubbing his wrists; “were you a female before becoming a stallion?”<br />
“No,” Lighting bristling at Jackson’s crassness; “but I was gelded when I was a mundane horse. Getting my balls back and being able to rut with my mate has made me more of a man you could ever hope to be. So get something to eat,” Lighting repeating himself; “food will help keep your strength up. And regardless as to how you feel,&quot; Lightning placing a hand on the man&#39;s shoulder; &quot;you are a member of this Haras, and we look after each other.”</p>
