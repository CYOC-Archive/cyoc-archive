<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy was taping away at the device but Bo wasn&#39;t worried.  He was too busy getting ready for the after school rush.  He was on the last panel of the freezer case when he felt something cool on his midsection.  Looking down at his apron he realized his issue.  His udder was pressed against the bottom of the glass.  The light brown organ was there just as he remembered.  <br />
<br />
Backing away, he wiped the milky smudge he had left behind.  Looking down at the organ, he remembered the trips to the doctor his parents had taken him on as a young child, going from specialist to specialist seeking answers to his &quot;condition&quot; as his mom had called it.  <br />
<br />
Other than the organ sitting conspicuously where another boy&#39;s testicles and penis would be, he was normal and healthy.  He could still pass urine through the teats but he had to be careful on how he aimed.  It wasn&#39;t until he turned about 12 or 13 that the udder had started to cause him problems.  As he went through puberty, it had grown and started to churn.  The teats had gotten longer, topping out at around six inches apiece.  His mom had tried to keep him in normal pants but the swelling of the organ caused him too much pain to be contained in pants.  He remembered the first night that he had felt like the pressure was too much. He had slunk into the shower and without the water running, he began to knead the teats. After a couple of pumps, milk had started to jet out of himself. It had felt heavenly.  After about ten minutes of squeezing and learning his technique, he had felt the immediate need and pressure subside.  Panting, he had shakily wiped his face and with his milk soaked hand and then he had felt the urge to taste it.  Tentatively, he took a small lick of the liquid and realized it tasted like the gallon of two percent his mom had kept in the fridge.  It was a little thicker and had a deeper undertone but it tasted like milk. <br />
<br />
Bo remembered how he had told his parents sheepishly and then how he had eventually shown them.  They had been leery at first but eventually they had tried it themselves.  Bo had figured out that he could milk himself two or three times a day and the swelling wasn&#39;t an issue.  However, it was time consuming.  The breakthrough had come when his mother had gone to a feed store and bought the milking machine.  <br />
<br />
Of course, socially he had struggled at first. He wasn&#39;t like the other boys in school.  After it had started to grow, his parents had to request that the school permit him to wear a modified uniform that allowed the udder to be free.  At first they had bailies but his mother had gone through a list of situations that other boys in the school were allowed to go around with their nipples exposed.  In a sense, Bo could understand the concern of the school authorities. The teats of his udder were sort of risqué. They flared like some of the cocks he had seen in locker rooms. But, the persistence of his father and mother had won out and Bo V. Inez had been allowed to go to school udderly unmolested by the powers that be.  <br />
<br />
When he had entered college, Bo found that he could either fight the stigma and weird looks or he could lean in to it.  He ended up seeking a degree in Agriculture with a focus on dairy science.  After working in the field for about a decade, he had saved up enough to start his ice cream business, his true passion.  <br />
<br />
Now, he could be his true self, his udder prominently displayed outside of his black overalls and his white apron.  Crazy Cow was the culmination of hard work and taking what he&#39;s been given and making something out of it.</p>
