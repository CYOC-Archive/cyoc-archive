<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Screw it, I&#39;m not going to let this transformation control my life) Harpinder thought, (The turban usually falls off by itself eventually, right? I&#39;m going to class like normal). So he took his laptop and book bag and snuck off before Harri returned. Harpinder was starting to feel better while walking through campus. His life has been so consumed with sikh antics these past days, it was nice to see a diverse crowd of people passing through the Library Walkway. Some with their hair out, others wearing baseball caps or beanies, one woman with a swim cap that was still wet from the pool, and a single white turban. (White turban!?) Harpinder realized. It was Gursewak. He took notice of Harpinder and strolled through the crowd towards him with a calm smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sat Sri Akaal&quot; Gursewak greeted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sat Sri Akaal&quot; Harpinder replied, as if by habit.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was weird&quot; Gursewak&#39;s expression soured, showing the true Gus that lied underneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, this body can make you say or do things you usually wouldn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harpinder, is that you?&quot; Gursewak glossed over Harpinder&#39;s muscular form. &quot;I thought you were a little nerd!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, jealous?&quot; He grinned and flexed. &quot;My sikh body changes with different turbans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you chose to wear rainbow?&quot; Gursewak glared at Harpinder&#39;s questionable headgear.<br />
<br />
Harpinder scoffed &quot;obviously I didn&#39;t choose to wear all this color, did you choose to wear no color at all?&quot; Pointing out that Gursewak was wearing a white polo and plain white pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhg, this is the closest to normal thing I could find. All of my clothes have been replaced with white, and most of it is Indian stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that makes sense, wearing white is a namdhari thing.&quot; He stated nonchalantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah well I&#39;m sick of it! I&#39;m going to the library to see what info I can get from that nerd from yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Satvinder? Good idea, I spoke with him yesterday and he seems to know a lot about transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, you coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I&#39;m headed to class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Class!? Forget that, we need to change back now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Harpinder&#39;s face turned red as Gursewak&#39;s impatience struck a chord with him, his voice slipping into his accent, &quot;You wand do change back now? You&#39;ve been trransforrmed forr a day! I&#39;ve been like dhis forr almosd a veek!&quot; This sent Gursewak into his own rant, which Harpinder tuned out. (How did I get stuck with Gursewak as my only ally? He&#39;s so annoying when he&#39;s angry!) He thought, (I guess it&#39;s still better than before, his mental changes won&#39;t let him get physical. Heh, even if he did, I bet I could take him on now that I have a warrior&#39;s build! Then again, he&#39;s a bulky guy, he must have decent muscle under that. Maybe we&#39;d get along if we worked out together? I do need train my legs and glutes today... With all that muscle and bulk, I wonder if Gursewak has a thick ass?)<br />
<br />
&quot;Harpinder? Did you hear what I said?&quot; Gursewak asked, snapping Harpinder back to their conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What did you say?&quot; (What was I thinking about just now?)<br />
<br />
Gursewak sighed, &quot;I said give me the turbans.&quot; He held out his hand. &quot;You told me that if you transform again, I need to stop you from transforming others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good point.&quot; Harpinder emptied the turbans from his book bag into Gursewak&#39;s bag. &quot;Just be careful with these, okay? We still don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the only one who can accidentally transform others.&quot; He emphasized the last sentence, worried that the former Gus did not seem to think about his actions. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah&quot; Gursewak replied dismissively, &quot;I&#39;ll text you later if I learn anything.&quot; With their conversation ended, his face returned to a peaceful smile. &quot;Sat sri akaal, Veer ji.&quot; He looked befuddled for a moment for saying this, before returning to his smile as he walked to the library. <br />
<br />
(He does look charming when he smiles) Harpinder thought, before shaking his head and going to his first class. It wasn&#39;t until he arrived at the classroom that he remembered his class schedule had been magically changed. He wanted to turn and run out of the &quot;Religious Studies 372: Sikhism&quot; classroom, but he ended up just bumping into the bearish sikh behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Harpinder, hi. It&#39;s good to see you too.&quot; Gurpreet said, taking Harpinder&#39;s hand and leading them to sit down next to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gurpreet? Hey, I was actually about to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you think of the assignment?&quot; He had a proud smile between his fat cheeks as he held a 7 page report in his plump hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;The assignment? To be honest, I don&#39;t remember doing it.&quot; In fact, Harpinder didn&#39;t remember doing any school work since the semester started a few days ago. It felt like all his time was being taken by these transformation shenanigans. He pulled a binder out of his book bag, revealing a 20 page report titled &quot;5 K&#39;s: The Visibility of Sikh Identity&quot;. On further inspection, the binder had a long report for each one of his classes. (When did I do all this? It must have been when I turned into that nerd.)<br />
<br />
Gurpreet&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;You don&#39;t remember writing all this?&quot; He chuckled, &quot;I guess the 5 K&#39;s is a pretty basic subject for us sikhs. The rest of the semester should be more insightful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sat sri akaal&quot; greeted the elderly Professor Singh as he entered the class. &quot;If everyone cloud, please pass your assignments to the row in front of you for me to collect. I hope you found our study of the 5 K&#39;s useful, as it will serve as a foundation for our next lessons. What you&#39;ve learned about Kachera will be especially useful today as we are discussing sexuality.&quot; He took a dry erase marker and wrong &#39;Sexuality in Sikhism&#39; on the whiteboard. &quot;I know, a touchy subject to discuss sexuality and religion, but we are at this university to challenge ourselves! I&#39;ll make sure we have some fun with it.&quot; Professor Singh smirked and stroked his long white beard. He had high energy for such an old man. &quot;Can anyone give a brief summary of what we learned about kachera, and how it connects to today&#39;s subject? Yes, you up front.&quot; He called on a student in the front row who raised their hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kachera are an undergarment fastened by a fitted string. The commandment to wear them was given by the 10th guru of Sikhism, Guru Gobind Singh, as a reminder to control our sexual desire. Kaam, or lust, is one of the &#39;5 theives&#39;. The time it takes to untie is suppose to give one time to consider their actions, as remembering God can overcome kaam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A fine summary, thank you. This is of course an important tenant of the Sikh faith. However, according to statistics from our university health department, even our Sikh students give into a little kaam from time to time.&quot; Professor Singh winked, eliciting laughter from the class. Harpinder, however, was dead silent. That joke only reminded him of what he had done with Harri the previous night. His sculpted face practically turned red with shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harpinder? Are you feeling okay?&quot; Gurpreet leaned in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m fine&quot; Harpinder turned away. (The last thing I need is another sikh man in my face.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of taboos&quot; a student interjected, &quot;I didn&#39;t see any mention of homosexuality in our reading. Is that allowed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, there are different interpretations for that.&quot; Professor Singh nodded. &quot;Would anyone care to answer?&quot;<br />
<br />
A sikh student responded, &quot;The Sikh Rehit Maryada describes the importance of family life. Because same-sex partners can not have children, their relationship is forbidden.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gurpreet stood, &quot;However, those same partners can create a family through adoption. Marriage is a union of souls, and the soul is genderless. Everything about our outward appearance, race, caste, creed, and gender, is temporary. As a gay Sikh, it gives me pride that my faith does not discriminate against my queer community.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s beautiful&quot; Harpinder looked up to Gurpreet in awe. &quot;So, Gurpreet, you&#39;re gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
He sat back down. &quot;Yeah, didn&#39;t Harri tell you? I&#39;m a member of the Queer Student Alliance too. Not in their leadership, though. I already have my hands full as the New Student Liaison for the Sikh Student Coalition.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, Harri did say I would recognize someone from the SSC in the QSA. I just didn&#39;t expect a masculine guy like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gurpreet grinned, taking that as a compliment, &quot;Well we&#39;re not all skinny guys like Harri. After all, you&#39;re all muscle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? No, Gurpreet, I&#39;m not-&quot; (Gay. I&#39;m not gay!) Unable to complete his sentence, Harpinder turned away. Class continued like normal and both Harpinder and Gurpreet left together.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Harpinder, I still have to thank you for stepping in at the Bake Sale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you cutting me a piece of the profits?&quot; he joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, that would kind of defeat the point of the fund raiser&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then don&#39;t worry about it. I actually had some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could tell. I noticed you flirting.&quot; Gurpreet winked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really now?&quot; Harpinder&#39;s face lit up. (If Gurpreet remembers me flirting with Rupi, maybe I&#39;m bi in this reality. I might be able to win her with these muscles after all).<br />
<br />
Gurpreet nods, &quot;I mean, I thought you were just being a good friend when you agreed to help out last second. But then you showed up wearing a turban that matched my table cloth, and you playfully &#39;accidentally&#39; bumped into me&quot;<br />
<br />
Harpinder&#39;s smile fell, (Wait, is Gurpreet implying I was flirting with him!?)<br />
<br />
&quot;Then in class just now, when Professor Singh made that joke, your face turned red and you looked away from me. And you got shy and looked away again when I complimented your muscles.&quot;<br />
<br />
(This is insane!) Harpinder thought, (he&#39;s misinterpreting everything that happened!) What about Rupi? Didn&#39;t you see what I was doing with her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you gave her a complimentary meal? Yes, I found that very charming. You know how much I appreciate generosity, especially within our community&quot;<br />
<br />
(He really believes that was me flirting with him too! How can he think I would be attracted to a man? Especially a fat man like him. A fat, big bearded, rugged, handsome bear of a man...) Harpinder blushed.<br />
<br />
Gurpreet cupped his pudgy hands around Harpinder&#39;s. &quot;I think you&#39;re charming, Harpinder. And I want to return your kindness. We have a few hours before your international business class. Care to join me?&quot;</p>
