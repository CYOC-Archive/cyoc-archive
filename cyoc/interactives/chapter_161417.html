<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Tom relishes everything that has just happened to him, an urge started nagging at him. Something from deep inside him. A deep want for something more from this experience. He feels himself up one more time in front of the mirror. Exploring every roll, curve, and fatty deposit and it dawns on him. He needs to be bigger. He wants to be fatter. <br />
<br />
He goes back onto the website with a new mission. Find a potion of weight gain. After a few minutes he finds exactly what he wants and he can&#39;t hit the order button any faster than he did.<br />
<br />
A few days pass, and the package arrives at Tom&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
Though the house it arrives at is noticeably different from when the last potion arrived. Tom use to be a very cleanly person, living in a one story house by myself left it easy or him to keep it clean. Which he preferred, but after his transformation a few unforeseen side effects occurred. The once cleanly Tom is gone. His clean living room is now trashed with bags of junk food and take-out. His room looking much the same. In that time span he also found a few &quot;friends&quot; on the dating app. Tom shared his plan with them and he invited them over to share in the dramatic change he was about to undergo. <br />
<br />
There were three &quot;friends&quot; at the house when the package arrived. David, Henry, and John.<br />
<br />
David was on the younger side of 20, but he was on the higher end of 400lbs. He stands 5&#39;8 with soft blue eyes, short curly blonde hair, and no body hair to speak of. His build can only be described as fat. From his head to his toes. David was big. He was swooped up by Tom&#39;s suave words and daddy appeal. After spending a night with Tom, David knew he found someone who he could spend his time with. Whether it was eating, playing video games, or just shooting the shit. David was appreciated by Tom, and he practically melted in Tom&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
Henry was about as old as Tom is after his transformation. Henry also used magic to get to the way he was, but nobody else knows that. He stands at 6&#39;4 with a thick build. He wears his hair long and in a ponytail. His body is covered in hair similarly to tom, but without the salt and pepper look. Henry was all grey from head to toe. He is noticeably taller than anybody else in the room, and looks mean to boot, but under that gruff disposition is a sweetheart. Tom and Henry immediately hit it off with talks of what it&#39;s like being older men (even though both parties are new to that world). He looks like he&#39;s built like a truck, but if you touch his pecs you&#39;ll notice they aren&#39;t hard at all. He is just as soft as Tom and David.<br />
<br />
Lastly there is John. John is as average as an average Joe can get. He is 5&#39;10, 190lbs with a small belly to his name with short cut brown hair and a five o&#39; clock shadow. He is dressed surprisingly enough in a white button down that is starting to now fit well, and a pair of blue chinos. He is the most professional looking in the room. He met Tom and fell head over heels. John likes older men, he likes big fat older men. And, on top of it all he loves men who can eat. Tom fit the bill, and soon enough will break all expectations.<br />
<br />
Tom hears the doorbell ring and says to the group of men that he&#39;s got it. He lifts himself off the couch and walks towards the door. The Tom walking to the door is unkempt, smelly, and to the three men in the room utter perfection. He is wearing only boxers, which was the only thing he had that still fit him after the transformation. His walk is more of a waddle as he packed on another few pounds from all of the food he has been indulging in. <br />
<br />
Tom reaches the door, opens it, and sees the package in his name sitting nicely on the patio in front of him. In excitement he quickly brings it into the house. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright boys, its time for Daddy Tom to become massive!&quot; he says with almost childlike excitement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whats in the box Tom?&quot; David asks<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s in the box is something special for me, and maybe if i&#39;m being generous for all of you.&quot; He says as he rips open the package in front of everyone. Inside the box is a potion bottle similar to last time, but instead of a chocolate brown solutions the potion looks a light shade of pink. <br />
<br />
Tom lifts the potion, pops the cork off and says, &quot;Bottoms up boys!&quot; with a devious grin on his face. Tom proceeds to chug half of the solution and places it down on the table. The potion tasted completely different from the last one he drank. It was extremely sweet, and went down easy. After a few moments the effects start up.<br />
<br />
After his first transformation Tom roughly became 400lbs. But, that potion had multiple effects which diluted the power of the weight gain. This potion has no such restrictions and within seconds Tom ballooned past 450lbs, then 500lbs, 550, 600, finally coming to a stop at around 650lbs. Tom had quickly fattened and dwarfed the large David in size. Tom was massive. His face went from chubby to undeniably fat with huge cheeks. His once hidden second chin became a third chin that you could almost see under his dense beard. His once modest moobs were now massive. The only way to do them justice is to call them watermelon sized. His belly on the other hand was where most of his weight went to. It now pushed further out in front then he was wide and it droops covering his crotch. His arms now not to dissimilar to hairy chicken wings. His rear, once flat even after his first transformation can only be described as a bubble butt. A huge mass of soft cushiony flesh for him to sit on. His thighs also grow almost monstrously. Each thigh easily being a few inches wider then his waist was a few weeks back. <br />
<br />
As Tom escapes the pure euphoria of the experience he just went through he looks around at the 3 men who saw that all take place. Each of them stunned, and each of them extremely turned on by what they just witnessed. Tom cracks a huge chubby smile, and proclaims, &quot;Well boys what do you think? Do you like you&#39;re fat daddy now?&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
All three men just had their jaws to the floor. Which of the three answers back?</h3>
