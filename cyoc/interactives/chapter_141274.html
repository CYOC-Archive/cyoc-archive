<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bus&#39;s next stop was mine, I raced home worried I had just dreamed what had happened.  I had felt that boys penis, and balls, and ass. I had pulled down his pants. I could still imagine what it felt like.  I had to make sure it wasn&#39;t a dream, I rushed into his house and up to my room.  I sat on his bed, winded from the speed I had moved.  I looked around the small room, which had been a large closet at one point. I concentrated on a pile of my clothes and reached out with my mind again.  I could feel the fabric, I could lift it up and move it. The appendage was like a ghost hand, if I concentrated hard enough I could even make it do two simple things, like two hands, but that was hard.  I had more questions than answers but one thing was sure I wasn&#39;t going to let this gift go to waste.<br />
<br />
I could hear my meat head brothers downstairs watching some game and cheering loudly, probably drunk. Aaron was 18 and Chris was 19, they had been the pride of the family.  Both athletes who got scholarships for football at minor state colleges their trophies were displayed prominently in the house and at the high school.  They were dumb as rocks but knew how to stay in shape, run fast, and catch a football.  My meat head father liked to relive his glory days vicariously through them.  I on the other hand was the shame of the family, smart but unathletic. I was a waste in their eyes and they made me pay for it by torturing me, needless to say I avoided them at all cost. Drunk, dumb brothers might be easy targets though, so I decided to take my chances. I reached out with my mind again, trying to will it out of my room and down the stairs, however it stopped as soon as i tried to make it turn the corner out my door.  I had to be able to see my where it was going it would seem. <br />
<br />
 As quietly as I could I snuck back down the stairs, stopping when I could just see them both on the couch, a pile of empty beers in front of them, and I would guess more in the case in front of them.  They were hammered, judging by the slurring.  I made my way down the stares a little less quietly now and picked out a spot in the dining room adjacent to the family room where I could hide under the table with a clear view of those two.  I had really gotten the short end on the looks genes.  Aaron and Chris were both over 6 feet and had been since high school.  Their bodies had been honed into almost pure muscle machines. They had the same dark hair with blue eyes that as me and my dad, but besides that there was little family resemblance.  If my mom and dad hadn&#39;t been so close I&#39;m sure my father would have assumed I wasn&#39;t his. I reached out with my mind again.  This time it went further than in my room or even in the bus, reaching out into the living room to where Aaron was sitting.  <br />
<br />
Just as I reached him, Aaron got up and headed towards the bathroom.  He cut through the dining room missing me under the table, hidden by the table cloth.  I turned and watched as he headed into the little bathroom opposite the dining room, I reached out after him and held the door back as hard as I could.  I wanted to test my strength.  I could feel the grain of the door as I pushed against it, Aaron stumbled in and tried to close the door, but it wouldn&#39;t give, I could feel his effort but it wasn&#39;t overpowering me.  My mind arm was stronger than my real arm apparently. Aaron gave a few more pulls before giving up, his urge to pee was great and his fear of anyone seeing him pee small.  I released the door and reached for Aaron.  I grazed his back, he didn&#39;t feel it, I reached around front, apparently being able to see the subject matter was enough to reach around front, despite not being able to see what was there. My hand was low and made contact with Aarons&#39;s balls first.  They were big and felt warm to the touch as I gently rolled them, getting a sense of their massive size.  I couldn&#39;t believe I was doing this, but I also couldn&#39;t stop myself.  I groped up and found his shaft, a quick idea came into my mind and I pulled it down splashing his legs, shorts and underwear with piss, confused about what was happening.  I pulled my mental hand back afraid he would figure it all out somehow. He muttered angrily to himself, about being too drunk and after a second of consideration, stripped out of his piss wet clothes leaving only his shirt on and headed back to the living room. Through the kitchen, not giving me much of a view of my brothers naked body.  <br />
<br />
Chris looked up at Aaron and smirked, &quot;pissed yourself?&quot; he asked.  Aaron nodded back and Chris laughed out a little &quot;light weight&quot; Aaron retorted, &quot;or maybe I just cant handle that big o&#39;dick&quot; shaking his hips.  All I could see was his well toned ass moving slightly left to right. &quot;I&#39;ll make bitch boy do my laundry&quot; Aaron slurred out, &quot; didn&#39;t he get home a while ago?&quot; I saw my opportunity and seized it.  I quickly left my hiding spot and walked through dining room into the kitchen behind the living room where the boys were sitting.  &quot;Hey&quot; I offered as I approached them Aaron still standing watching the game. He didn&#39;t even look at me as he issued his command his eyes locked on the game, &quot;Ohh good, go do my wet laundry in the bathroom&quot; he barked.  &quot;Ok&quot; I said, my eyes locked on his massive cock.  Once again I had gotten the short end of the stick.  He was hung like a horse, the large, thick, shaft hung down maybe 8&quot; over orange sized balls to a large circumcised head which neatly accented at the end with its size and shape. I had to pry my eyes away as I gasped a &quot;yea right away!&quot; If he caught me staring I would get a beating from him, Chris, and my dad. This gift I had developed seemed to making up for a lot that I missed out on, such as my pathetic penis. It was thick, but not that thick, and short.  It looked like half a crayola marker kids used to color. I made my way to the bathroom and cleaned up the clothes, depositing them in the washer before cleaning up the piss left on the floor. <br />
<br />
My brothers massive cock was stuck in my mind, I went back to the living room where he now was sitting on the couch, still naked, drinking another beer.  &quot;Its in the wash&quot; I said nervously, stealing glances at his unit, &quot;Ill come down later to dry it.&quot; He didn&#39;t respond his eyes never left the TV.  I thought about joining them, before deciding to return to my hiding spot under the table to continue playing with my power.</p>
