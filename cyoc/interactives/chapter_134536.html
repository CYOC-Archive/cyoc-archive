<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a few minutes, the group finished their short dine, most of them yawned and stretched after finishing their plates, the dragons already finished their food, and already started talking, Karyu and Oakmoss were talking about their life, meanwhile Astrid and Hilda were silently speaking of possible methods to flirt and seduce the two drakes into giving them more clutches, Oliver and Ethel easly heard their hens planning to mate with Oakmoss and Karyu, they didn&#39;t mind it at all, nor did Celestia or Luka, they allowed their dragons to do as they wished, as long as it didn&#39;t cause any form of damage.<br />
<br />
Celestia looked outside, after the transformation, her senses became sharper, she could see the smallest details that the naked eye couldn&#39;t, she could smell the most pleasant and unpleasant scents, while looking outside she could see that the sun was slowly setting, the beautiful sky got a coloration of orange, while watching the beautiful setting, Celestia also smelled the humidity of the atmosphere, it was also hot outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should go to that kingdom now.&quot; Suggested Celestia as she slowly got up, cleaning her adorable skirt.<br />
&quot;Aw come on Celestia! It&#39;s almost night time, we can go tom-&quot; Started Oliver, trying to persuade the young chemist, only to be interrupted by her.<br />
&quot;The kingdom isn&#39;t too far away from here, if we wait tommorow then a storm might arrive, and i don&#39;t THINK that you would like to go to a kingdom with your garb soaking wet.&quot; Said Celestia suddenly, with anger and frustration in her adorable voice, &quot;Besides, even if this form improves my senses, i don&#39;t want to have it, i bet lady Luka dosen&#39;t want it aswell.&quot; continued Celestia, &quot;No offense of course.&quot; finished Celestia, even as a child, she could easly create arguments using logic and reason.<br />
&quot;None taken.&quot; Replied Ethel, as he looked at Oliver, &quot;She&#39;s right Oliver, the kingdom isn&#39;t too far away from here, and if a storm does appear, then we might aswell be inside a inn.&quot; finished Ethel.<br />
At this Oliver sighed, &quot;Alright then, let&#39;s get ready.&quot; he said as he got up, preparing to leave with the group.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed, the group was walking on a peaceful countryside, the salt-sweet breeze pressed on the skin and scales of the group, the soft grass tickled them as they made their way towards the kingdom, infront of the group was Luka and Ethel who remained silent as they looked around, assuring themselves that no form of danger appeared, behind them were Oliver and Celestia, speaking together about their daily lives, behind them were the two drakes, Oakmoss and Karyu, with their tails entwined as they spoke about their plans on the future, and behind them were the two hens, Astrid and Hilda, still speaking of possible approaches to seduce the two drakes into giving them clutches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look Oakmoss, i know you don&#39;t want those two concubines to seduce me into giving them clutches because you want me to only be yours, but a drake has his urges to have offsprings.&quot; Said Karyu, his voice being calm and sympathetic, &quot;Just because you are into drakes doesn&#39;t mean that i also have to be into drakes, you are my mate, and i love you, but as i said a drake has his urges to have offsprings.&quot; continued Karyu, trying to reason with Oakmoss, &quot;Plus, i saw you staring at Elisa&#39;s dragon, you gave him &#39;that&#39; look, and he gave it back.&quot; finished Karyu, his lips shifting into a smirk as he teased the teal green drake.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that!&quot; Replied Oakmoss quickly, &quot;W-Well, i admit that i want you to be all mine, but i&#39;m into hens aswell!&quot; continued the drake, as a blush formed on his visage, &quot;Let&#39;s say that i lean unto male partners alright? And i do admit that i am starting to develop a small crush for Elisa&#39;s drake.&quot; admited Oakmoss, with a sad voice.<br />
Karyu smilled, he wasn&#39;t mad, infact, he was quite happy that Oakmoss confessed to him, signifying that he truly loves him, &quot;Well, i don&#39;t blame you, he&#39;s quite adorable.&quot; said the demonic drake, remembering the look on Hadad&#39;s face when the leviathan&#39;s eyes landed on him, at first he had an aggressive and menacing look, ready to harm anyone who came into contact with Elisa, but when his eyes saw Oakmoss, his expression suddenly changed into one of a love-struck fool, &quot;I don&#39;t have any problem if you share your love with anyone else, as long as i know you still love me.&quot; finished Karyu as he nuzzled Oakmoss, who nuzzles him back, the two hens looked at the two drakes, giving an audible &quot;Awww&quot; as they saw them loving each other.<br />
<br />
Eventually the group reached one of the villages near the castle of the kingdom, being instantly mesmerized by its beauty.<br />
The village looked like any ordinary village, aside from some differences, the most noticeable difference was the fact that there were no torches illuminating the streets of the village, they were replaced with small glowing orbs of fire wandering around the village, their light being brighter than three torches combined, the other diffrence was that the gates of the houses were entwined in vines, the mark of nature was around the village, the streets were almost completly crowded by its villagers, who quickly welcomed Luka and her crew, most of the villagers were dragon-born Kilins, others were human-born Kilins and sometimes a human would appear, it seemed like the perfect Utopia.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do we do? Do we straight up go to the castle and ask his or her highness for an audience?&quot; Asked Ethel with his arms crossed as he looked at Luka.<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s kinda late.&quot; Replied Luka as she pulled out a pocketwatch, &quot;His or her highness is probably asleep, so it&#39;s best that we settle down in an inn and wait for the night to pass.&quot; continued Luka as she looked around, instantly spotting the nearest inn, which was the tallest building of the village, the group quickly went inside the inn, renting the most expensive room in the inn.</p>
