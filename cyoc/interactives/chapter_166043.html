<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were once a zookeeper in the big cats section of the zoo. There were two tigers you always felt like you had a bond with, and they were appropriately brother and sister. They were found as cubs after their mother died in the wild and had been here ever since. But... when &quot;The day&quot; came and as you were cleaning their enclosure, playing with the two tiger siblings, then all hell seemed to broke loose. You were pumped full of some sort of sexual lust, passing out in mere moments after you saw your hands becoming large pawlike appendages.<br />
<br />
You awoke hours later finding two incredibly attractive tiger women looming over you. You thought you were dreaming until one of them got so frustrated she kicked you in the head causing you to snarl. The other woman pushed the first and the two started arguing as you got to your feet and looked down. Then as they quite literally were about to break out into a cat fight you screamed loudly upon seeing your body, and the two immediately rushed to your aid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?!&quot; They spoke in unison and you were freaking out basically for the next hour thinking you were in some kind of alternative universe full of anthropomorphic zoo animals, and you were one of them. This was until the two of them got sick and tired of you to the point where they tackled you into the small pond in the tiger enclosure, and told you their names, &quot;Jack and Jill,&quot; a reference to an obvious nursery rhyme that at the time was cute to call them when they were cubs.<br />
<br />
You immediately recognized the two names, and noticed the tags on their ears before feeling around your head, realizing you didn’t have any tags like them. You then pleaded to them, asking what was going on. Jack couldn’t tell you much, stating, he, or she passed out like you did. Jill however had quite a story to tell, and it made you blush heavily. <br />
<br />
After seeing the two of them had become humanoid and sentient and wrapping your head decently around the situation, and your new.... curvy body with womanly breasts, hips, and a bubbly ass. You told the both of them to stay put, and proceeded to check the other zoo enclosures. To your disbelief and dismay the entire staff along with a good chunk of the animals have all turned into anthropomorphic female versions of themselves. The ratio of former anthro animals was 1 in 5 it seemed, but this caused chaos, especially in smaller enclosures containing snakes, spiders, bats, and other endangered species. Thankfully, it seems that you or other members of the staff seemed to come to a consensus with the animals who did change to release them but allow them to roam freely, while also helping them adjust to society..... before society actually broke down. But for the most part things seemed to be under control, and the only issues there now were was convincing former feral predators not to hunt things that walked on two legs and spoke.<br />
<br />
After the government collapsed the apartment complex you lived in nearby turned chaotic. You grabbed whatever you could and ran off. You managed to get to the zoo and by the time you reached it, others were looking to take refuge there. Over the course of the next month the zoo and the surounding area became a safe haven for animal people, and animals alike. As for you, you needed help badly and it seems your only form of comfort in this time, due to the communication collapse worldwide shortly after the government’s collapse, were the two tigers you helped raise from cubs. They took you in, allowed you to stay in their enclosure, and they accept you as a valued friend. Overtime they helped you adapt to your body, give you emotional support and at times it seemed they were the only things keeping you sane. Every night you would sleep with them piled up on top of you, vise versa, and.... you’ve grown even closer to them like they were family. You didn’t really teach them how to be civilized because what was the point now as long as they knew who not to attack? Even then, the two were raised in the zoo so you were pretty sure they didn’t even know what hunting was. To this day they are your source of emotional support, affection, and love, and they were now basically your family. <br />
<br />
_____________<br />
<br />
Present day.....<br />
<br />
<br />
You woke up in the den on a mattress and saw that the two sisters were already up and moving. So you stood up and stretched, yawning and stretching your arms and legs. You were very muscularly built, and despite your large breasts you seemed to give off an aura of intimidation until you got to know whoever was talking to you. You walked outside and noticed Jack splashing herself with water in the pond, ironically the large cats seemed to love water more than hate it. You approached her and smiled watching her clean herself off, and said,&quot;Hey Jackie.... how’s it going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack turned around and smiled,&quot;Good morning Evan! How was your sleep? Any nightmares?”<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you it’s Elise now,&quot; You replied rolling your eyes,&quot;I’m fine, no dreams are good nights for me... heh..... where’s Jill at?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, sleeping in the sun like she usually does,&quot; Jack replied shrugging before she blushed a bit,&quot;Hey uh.... Elise..... have you every felt..... aroused by other females before?&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed heavily when you heard this,&quot;U-Uh.... J-Jackie you watched the news.....! Y-You should know we’re all lesbians...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What’s a lesbian though?&quot; Jack asked tilting her head.<br />
<br />
You paused for a moment then facepalmed,&quot;I keep forgetting you two weren’t ever really educated.....&quot; You then sighed,&quot;A lesbian is.... a woman who is attracted to other women... you know like in the wild males and females would probably be attracted to another? Well.... there’s only women now s-so....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Oh......&quot; Jack replied and blushed slightly,&quot;Hmm.... alright! H-Heh....”<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack are you attracted to someone?&quot; You asked her and Jack’s cheeks blushed brightly and she growled,&quot;N-No I’m not!! Not at all!! J-Just uh... s-stop staring at me perv!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two seemed to have the maturity of teenagers, which isn’t really surprising considering that most animals in the zoo are treated childishly their whole lives until they’re past their prime. You weren’t really intimidated by Jack, but you were confused by her reaction so you just shrugged,&quot;Uh... see you later?&quot; You then turned around and walked off to find Jill.<br />
<br />
After a minute or two you found Jill doing exactly what Jack said she was doing, laying in the sun, but also with her eyes closed and casually toying with her pussy. The moment you saw this you screamed,&quot;J-Jill?! W-What are you doing?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm?&quot; Jill turned around, pausing but still with her fingers on her moist pussy,&quot;Oh hi Elise! Is there a problem....?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You’re... h-hand is....&quot; You blushed heavily and covered your mouth and she looked down at her crotch and tilted her head,&quot;What? I’m allowed to do this aren’t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;J-Jill! There’s children in the zoo...! P-Please, don’t touch your vagina or...&quot; You lifted your breasts,&quot;These outside like you are, at least do that when you’re somewhere private like in the cave.&quot;<br />
<br />
“But what’s the problem with me doing it out here? The sun feels nice and warm,&quot; Jill replies stretching out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jill I will get you a heat lamp so you can feel the sun when you’re in the den, just please don’t do that here, or anywhere that others can see you, please.... for me?&quot; You asked and Jill sighed then stood up and walked up to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright, but you should know that Jackie’s been giving you some weird looks lately. I mean.... so have I, but she’s keeping it secret which is kind of... weird, right?&quot; Jill asked and you blinked twice, blushing,&quot;W-Weird looks like.... w-what?”<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you know, staring at your breasts and vagina, fantasizing how nice it would feel to groom you, clean your pussy, finger it.... massage your big and beautiful bre-&quot; Jill whimsically remarked and you felt your heart jump and your voice cracked,&quot;I gET it....!&quot;<br />
<br />
You covered your mouth and cleared your throat,&quot;Uh.... d-do you or J-Jackie know what uh.... th-this means, since you both are d-doing it so much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that’s why I wanted to ask you!&quot; Jill replied cheerfully and you blushed,&quot;I-I... uh..... n-need s-some time to figure th-that out too... Uh.... I’m going to go for a walk..... please d-don’t masterbate when you’re outside.... please?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill tilted her head then nodded,&quot;Okay then, but you better tell me what this is before I have to figure it out myself, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I promise, okay? J-Just.... behave, okay?&quot; You replied smiling awkwardly before you walked to the enclosure exit and just walked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are those two really attracted to me...?!&quot; You thought to yourself,&quot;I-I mean they are hot, and basically twins.... every night I do sorta wish I could....&quot; You stopped yourself mid-thought and screamed, or rather roared,&quot;Oh shut up! Elise just get a hold of yourself!!&quot;<br />
<br />
You then heard a familiar voice next to you,&quot;Uh.... is this a bad time Eli?&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed and turned to see a familiar coworker of yours, Alex, who was now a reindeer anthro and blushing slightly. You gulped upon seeing them and sighed,&quot;A-Alex.... y-your fine.... the two twins are just..... driving me crazy today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Usually they tend to do the opposite from what I’ve seen,&quot; Alex replied giggling slightly,&quot;Anyways I have a letter for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Letter?! Hold on we get those here?&quot; You asked tilting your head and Alex blushed,&quot;Well.... its more like a message from someone who just arrived and they would like to speak to you... they knew your Uh.... man name so I decided to pass it onto you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My... man name?! Who the hell would know that from around here?!&quot; You cried and Alex sighed,&quot;Well... I got names of course, said you would recognize it.... and they claim to be your....&quot;</p>
