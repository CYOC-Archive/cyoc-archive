<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick seemed to take Sanchez&#39; new training regimen in stride.  He knew Chad was seething, and a few extra hours in the pool would be worth it to break in Chad properly. <br />
<br />
The fact that Chad was sitting naked in front of his locker before Rick got there told Rick that Chad was trying to control the situation as much as he could. Rick was supposed to be totally in control. Chad should have arrived just on time or maybe a bit late. He should have been dressed. He should have pleaded, he should have- but he didn&#39;t. His clothing was probably neatly hung and folded in his own locker. The fact he was seated suggested he had been there at least 15 minutes early. Rick shook his head, no he would not let Chad control any aspect of his - no, its- life. Chad was Rick&#39;s Speedo. It had to accept that, it had to surrender totally to being owned.<br />
<br />
Rick grinned as he swam.  If he broke Chad completely before the end of term, he had promised Chad that he could go to prom and graduation as human if he wanted to do so, or he could go as Rick&#39;s Speedo under his tux and under his gown. With Sanchez training program, Rick was sure Chad would prefer to be worn. Chad probably had a date or dates lined up after the two hour scheduled practice. He was definitely missing at least one hookup, maybe two.<br />
<br />
Only as the weaker swimmers on the team exited the pool did Rick remember his own date later today! He swam harder and faster venting his anger with each stroke and breath.<br />
<br />
Only Bruno and Rick were left in the pool, when Sanchez blew his whistle. Rick pulled himself out of the water and glared at the pool clock. Nine and a half hours! He had half an hour to get to his date.<br />
<br />
He bolted for the locker room, rinsed off in the shower, toweled dry, spritzed himself with body spray, and dressed. He left his underwear hanging in his locker, and put his clothing on over Chad the living Speedo. He felt the Speedo twist and stretch and squeeze trying to get his attention, but Rick had decided to expand on Sanchez&#39; emersion training. Chad would be worn tonight - all night if Rick got lucky.<br />
<br />
Chad was furious. Initially, his anger was directed against Sanchez. Nine and a half hours as Rick&#39;s Speedo was hell. The dude was in constant motion stretching, twisting, torturing Chad with every movement.  Chad&#39;s sole reason for being as Rick&#39;s Speedo was to hug his buttocks, and cradle Rick&#39;s manhood. <br />
<br />
As usual, Chad had to be the best at whatever he was doing. Even if he was Rick&#39;s Speedo, he would strive to be the best Speedo he could be.  Thank god it was only for a couple hours each day. He was thinking that right when Rick flicked the back of his head, and he morphed from flesh and bone into Polyester and Spandex.<br />
<br />
Underwater, Chad had limited perspective. Everything was turquoise blue or Rick, the other swimmers were body parts and bubbles as they swam.  Chad thought he had memorized every vein on Rick&#39;s penis, every wrinkle on his scrotum. But after Rick pulled his jeans over Chad plunging him into darkness, Chad discovered new features in Rick&#39;s anatomy that he missed earlier. He realized out of the water, and in anticipation of his date that Rick&#39;s cock was swelling and his balls were contracting. TMI! Too much information but Chad the Speedo existed for all these details. Rick was sweating a sweet musky scent as he hurried to his car. Chad hadn&#39;t noticed it when Rick was swimming. Maybe he had, but the water had diluted it. Now it was a richer, more sensual scent. Chad felt comfortably reassured by Rick&#39;s scent as he cradled his growing bulge, and tight ass.<br />
<br />
The car stopped. Rick got out, and adjusted himself. He clenched his butt cheeks, thrust his bulge and chest forward and tried to saunter casually. Music blared in the background. Chad heard the sound of a chair dragging as it was pulled out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, babe, sorry to keep you waiting. Coach Sanchez decided to change the schedule. I just spent over 9 hours in the pool,&quot;  Rick said as he sat down.<br />
<br />
A voice replied, but Chad was much more focused on the precum oozing out of Rick&#39;s mushroom tip, and into him. Damn, it tasted delicious. Why did it have to taste so delicious ?<br />
<br />
Chad struggled to follow the conversation, but was only able to concentrate on fragments of conversation between dollops of cum leaking into him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be exhausted,&quot; &quot;Not too tired to make you scream after dinner,&quot; &quot;Mm, oysters sound good,&quot; &quot;Whassup with Chad? He was a total no show- not even a tex-&quot;  Splooge. Chad went blotto. Rick ejaculated, and Chad absorbed it. <br />
<br />
When Chad came to, Rick was lying on a mattress. He was still wearing Chad. There was a warm body lying next to him. Rick&#39;s date. Chad was supposed to meet up with Rick&#39;s date, and was a no show. The voice was familiar, but it was distorted by the loud music, and Rick&#39;s jeans, and probably a napkin and table.  Who was Chad supposed to see after 2 hours as Rick&#39;s Speedo? All that cum worked on Chad like bottles of Everclear. His mind was hazy. Maybe it wasn&#39;t the cum, maybe being fabric for 10 or twenty hours was stretching his brain a bit thin?<br />
<br />
Lemme see, thought Chad, 11 am Megan in the park, 1 pm Brad, Rod, and Dirk for basketball in his driveway, 3:30 pm after showering Chad was supposed to pickup Lena, and he penciled in Joy for six... so Rick&#39;s date was probably Megan, Lena or Joy? Hm, Rick never mentioned who he dated, Bruno had suggested once that he wasn&#39;t the only swim fag, and Rick was wearing Chad on his cock and balls- could anything be gayer? But Rick couldnt be in bed with Brad, Rod or Dirk, could he?<br />
<br />
Chad found his manhood filled cheeks press against a pair of butt cheeks in the dark. Rick was spooning with his date. Oh, damn, he was getting hard again. Whose butt was in bed with Rick? He couldn&#39;t see in the dark under the covers, but he could feel. He tried to focus on the butt, and not on Rick&#39;s butt or growing cock inside him.</p>
