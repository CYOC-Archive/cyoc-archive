<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh man,&quot; you moan silently to yourself as you sit on the toilet in the girl's restroom.<br />
<br />
Looking down, your shirt pulled up, you are currently taking in the pert swell of your breasts, which have now reached their full size as a B cup with a size 18 band; something that bothers you because only just this morning they were nonexistent.<br />
<br />
Pushing your shirt down, you stand and collect your backpack. A couple seconds earlier the final bell for the day rang and you ducked, naturally, into the girl's bathroom. There you made the discovery of how much your body had changed over the day. Stepping out of the stall, you walk up to the mirror and look into it.<br />
<br />
Your hair now falls past your shoulders and is soft and rather full looking. Your face is now even rounder and softer. You lips, jawline and nose accent how feminine your whole face looks. But the rest of your body, except for your breasts, still looks kind of masculine. Turning sideways, you look at your butt and then turn forward to face the mirror again, wondering when your hips, waist and butt will start to look for feminine.<br />
<br />
Lifting your shirt up again, you took in your breasts, gently and firmly cupped in the soft and silky bra you're wearing. Noting that the little armpit and chest hair you did have has vanished, you drop your shirt, grab you backpack and head for swim pratice.<br />
<br />
Upon arriving, the coach asks, &quot;What are you doing here? I thought you had a doctor's appointment?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly you remember that you did and thanking the coach, turn to leave. Outside the locker rooms, you again naturally entered the girl's locker room, you pause and then ask yourself, &quot;Don't I have something else that I do after school? Not swim practice. That's for the girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
And the it hits you that you are one of the girls, or slowly becoming one. But you can't remember what it is that you did before after school. Bothered by this, you exit the school and are immediatly greeted by your mother. Climbing in the passager seat, yout mother asks, &quot;How was school,&quot; to which you reply fine.<br />
<br />
A silence falls and then you ask, &quot;Do I have to have this appontment?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mother nods and tells you, &quot;It's important to make sure you're healhly and growing the way you should be. I had this very same appointment when I was your age and your sister will have the same appointment as well.&quot; Confused, you said nothing and the drive was finished in silence.<br />
<br />
Arriving at the clinic, you realise that your mom is taking you to see a female doctor. Wondering what the outcome of this would be, you sat in silence as your mother filled out the form.<br />
<br />
When the doctor, a woman doctor, called you back, your mother told you, &quot;I'll be waiting just out here,&quot; as you followed the woman back behind the desk and then through a door, where she asked you to remove your shoes and step on a scale.<br />
<br />
Watching the doctor, you noted that your weight had dropped, as you now weighed about ninety four pounds. But what really amazed you was when the doctor took your height and you only topped out at five foot three. Thinking, &quot;I've really shrunk. This is really happening. I'm becoming a girl,&quot; you collected your shoes and followed the doctor into a private room.<br />
<br />
There she asked for you to remove your pants, shirt and bra. Shivering, feeling uncomfortable, wondering what she would say about your penis, you watched as she pulled on a pair of latex gloves and then began to examine your breasts.<br />
<br />
Afterward she took your temperture, checked your pulse, listened to your heart, asked you to cough while she pressed the stephiscope to your chest and back and then asked you sit up on the table.<br />
<br />
Sitting there, dreading what the doctor might say, you waited as she checked your reflexes. Afterward, the moment you had been dreading came as she told you, &quot;This might be a bit uncomfortable, seeing as it's your first time. But I need you to lay back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Complying, you heard a noise and looking up you watched as she pulled the stirrups out from the table and then positioned your legs in them. Gently removing your underwear, she said nothing about your penis and testicles. Instead she pulled on fresh latex gloves, her third pair, and began to gently probe the area between your legs. <br />
<br />
What bothered you even more was when she picked up different instruments and began to prod you in the area you are sure had nothing. And then you could feel some of those instruments entering your body. Gasping, wanting to cry for some reason, you lay there on the table, quietly accepting what this woman was doing. After a bit, she asked you, &quot;Have you experienced your enstrual cycle yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
You think about it and for some reason the answer comes to you and you respond that your last cycle was about a week and a half ago. <br />
<br />
She nods and continues. Every once and awhile, she asks you another question. Something only a girl would know, but you answer easily. After the last question she tells you, &quot;All done. I'm going to step out while you get dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing her get up and then leave, you slid your legs out of the stirrups, collected your underwear and then paused. Looking down, you saw your penis and testicles, which you thought looked smaller. Hand shaking, you reached down past your male organs and then began to prod the area between your legs.<br />
<br />
This only confused you more as you clearly had nothing down there but smooth, flat skin and nothing about what you felt hinted at the tell-tale signs of a girl's vagina or vulva.<br />
<br />
Confused, you dressed and then stepped out of the room. Outside, the doctor handed you a cup and directed you attention to another room and explained, &quot;Please fill the cup as much as you can and then place is in the little cubby provided inside the room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Entering the room, you looked at the cup, saw that there was a toilet, looked at the cup, saw that it was shaped so that a girl could use it comfortable without peeing all over her hand and then undid your pants. If peeing sitting down was weird, then peeing in a cup was even weirder. After filling the cup three fourths of the way, you put the lid on, finished up and then set the cup in the cubby hole. Washing your hands, you exited.<br />
<br />
Immediatly you are greeted by the doctor, who shows you back to the waiting room. Telling you mother, &quot;We should have the results of the tests in a day or two,&quot; she wishes you both a good day and then leaves.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, that wasn't so bad, was it?&quot; Your mother asks as she guides you out of the waiting room and to the car.<br />
<br />
Looking at her, you tell her truthfully, &quot;It was humiliating.&quot;<br />
<br />
You mom nods and then says, &quot;But it is nesesarry to your health that you get checked out regulary.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have nothing to say as you get in the car and for the first time in three days, you think about tearing up the note. Next to you, your mother is offering you your favourite food for dinner. Nodding, you continue to think about ripping up the note. By the time you've reached home, you think that just because you had one uncomfortable experience as a girl, doesn't mean you should do something rash, like tearing up the note.<br />
<br />
By the time you get up to your room, which is now starting to look like a teenage girl's room, the note has been pushed from your mind and you are thinking about the homework you need to do, the date you have with Jake and wondering if mom will allow you to go over to a friend's house after dinner. &quot;Maybe I'll phone Melissa or Ann,&quot; you think as you deposit your backpack on the white and pink bedspread on your bed.</p>
