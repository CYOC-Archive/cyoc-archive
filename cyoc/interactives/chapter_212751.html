<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris and Mason weren&#39;t great friends. <br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t know each other very well. Chris was a jock; he was a runner for the football team. Mason on the other hand was a computer science major. They didn&#39;t have much in common, but they couldn&#39;t find their friends anywhere at the party. In a mutually assured away to avoid being alone, they were hanging for now… at least until their friends showed up.<br />
<br />
Chris and Mason were walking by the bathroom when the door opened. They saw a  hulking man dressed up like some sort of mechanic who proceeded to wave them over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I need some help. Go to the garage and get me a wrench. Quickly!&quot; The man spoke demandingly and with authority. <br />
<br />
They looked at each other with intense confusion. <br />
<br />
“Why?” Mason asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
“Because the toilet broke.” The man stood aside and let the two see the shattered remains of the former toilet. “I replaced it with a new one, but the sink is busted too. Now hurry up and fetch me that wrench.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh,” Chris shot Mason a look. The nerd just shrugged and nodded. While it was strange to be asked by a stranger for a wrench, they didn&#39;t care enough to protest either. The man had that air of authority real adults gave off. “Y-yeah, sure, be right back, man.”<br />
<br />
The plumber snorted and walked back inside the bathroom as the two college kids made their way to the garage.<br />
<br />
Opening the door, Chris was the first to peer inside and was suprised to see that it mostly empty. No one was hanging around in here. A super nice vintage car stood in the middle of the driveway, but not much else was of note in here. There was a suspicious fridge that seemed out or place, as two fridges were standing right next to each other. They didn&#39;t pay it much thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like everything duplicates in this house, ya know?&quot; said Chris.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we&#39;ll get lucky, and it&#39;ll duplicate a wrench for us,&quot; Mason replied.<br />
<br />
Without warning, the house lights flickered. <br />
<br />
Mason was overcome with an intensely pleasurable aura. He turned to look at Chris, who was rummaging through a nearby shelf. Mason didn’t know why, but he held out his hand, reaching for Chris. But the more he reached out, the more he felt hishand stiffen and gain a shiny, metallic sheen. <br />
<br />
It took less than a second for his hand to become impossible to move, all while his whole body clenched and tightened. The world grew around him, the garage expanding in size as he shrunk down. His diminished form was too tiny to contain his thoughts and Mason could feel himself slipping from his own body, as though the two were becoming separate beings, attached by only the most tenuous of strings.<br />
<br />
Mason could only watch as the floor rushed up.  His first instinct was to bring a hand up to shield his face or close his eyes to protect them.  But the closer the floor got, the more odd it seemed for him to even have a hand or eyes.  By the time the two collided, Mason couldn’t comprehend the idea of being anything more than a cheap metal tool, made in China, then shipped across the ocean to be used for a few months before being discarded.<br />
<br />
“Being discarded…” he thought to himself, “I wasn’t made to be…”<br />
<br />
Chris heard a loud clang behind him. He turned to see a pile of a clothes, Mason&#39;s clothes. Did Mason just strip? He blinked and then the clothes had disappeared. Instead, he saw a wrench lying on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo Mason? Where are you? I found a wrench.&quot;<br />
<br />
No response.<br />
<br />
Chris felt really annoyed. Where had Mason gone? They had promised to stick together; had he really abandoned him to strip? He called out again, but to no avail. Chris picked up the wrench and grumbled. Fucking asshole. Everyone at this party ditches.<br />
<br />
Chris walked over to the bathroom; wrench acquired. He knocked on the door, waiting for the plumber to open it. The door opened and he saw the plumber waiting for him, two inches of his hairy paunch exposed. The man smiled and pointed under the sink.<br />
<br />
“Can you hold the ring in place while I ready the replacement?” <br />
<br />
The cabinet below the sink was visible from the open door. It looked like a tight squeeze. Obviously the guy was too big to comfortably fit. Chris had a sinking feeling he’d end up doing most of the work.<br />
<br />
“Uhhh….”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, forgot my manners.” The man extended a calloused hand. “I’m Jim.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m Chris.” Chris shook the hand and looked under the sink. “Don’t you have an assistant who could help you? Or a son?” <br />
<br />
Chris paused as a warm red light engulfed him, making his body tingle.<br />
<br />
“Just have you, kid. Can you help me out or what?” The plumber smiled.<br />
<br />
He didn’t really want to. But then, gentle waves of warmth tingled in his brain, nudging him towards acceptance. Chris’ will wavered.<br />
<br />
“Uh, sure, I guess.” Chris shrugged, getting on his hands and knees and placing the wrench to keep the seal on the u-turn pipe closed. “Like this?”<br />
<br />
The warmth enveloped his ass. <br />
<br />
Chris’ loose jeans started growing tighter as his haunches swelled with fat and muscle. He moaned softly as the gentle waves massaged his cheeks, encouraging his growth. The seat of his pants began to press out as his two large, firm mounds of ass meat stretched them taut. <br />
<br />
“Lemme check.” Jim said, his eyes fixed on the young man’s well-caked ass as it wobbled invitingly.<br />
<br />
Chris waited as Jim approached, his footfalls heavy on the linoleum. For some reason, his ass was jiggling in tandem with those steps. Had he put on weight? His questions were put on hold when a soft, heavy weight settled on his lower back, spreading warmly over him.<br />
<br />
This time, Chris did spare a glance backwards as heavy huffing and hot breath on the back of his neck caught his attention. The plumber was covering his body, using his ass as a shelf for his gut. Chris wanted to protest, but the fact was the sink was a tight squeeze so complaining would probably be met with disdain. Best not to call it out at all.<br />
<br />
He felt the plumbers bushy beard brush the back of his neck and the man’s hot breath in his ear. Jim’s crotch was tight against the back of Chris’ ass, and he thought, with mounting horror, that there was a hard lump pressing against his rear. Was the guy getting off on this!?<br />
<br />
Before he could say anything, a thick, hairy arm reached over his and clasped his hand. Jim’s grip was gentle but firm. He helped Chris turn the wrench and tighten it. The bear’s hand lingered on Chris’.<br />
<br />
“Like this, son.” Jim whispered huskily.<br />
<br />
Chris turned his head, exposing his face to the light. He squinted his eyes against the pleasant red glare to stare at the older man. Jim was rather handsome, he realized, and his eyes were soft and staring at him with a sort of longing.<br />
<br />
He sniffed, and caught an enticing, musky smell. Chris realized that the man’s armpit was right next to his face. The warm waves coaxed him to lean into that hairy pit. It had the masculine scent of a real man. His tongue extended and he licked it, swallowing the salty sweat that had beaded at the ends of those long hairs.<br />
<br />
“Good boy.” Jim encouraged, his eyes twinkling brightly.<br />
<br />
The man’s other hand gently nudged Chris deeper into his pit. The young man was repelled at first, but the big hand pressed him more forcefully and he found himself lapping deeply. He moaned, enjoying cleaning the big man’s body. <br />
<br />
Finally, Jim pulled his arm away and smiled at Chris.<br />
<br />
The young man’s cock grew harder the longer he stared at Jim. He found himself leaning towards the bigger man. Jim took the initiative. The plumber leaned forward and kissed Chris lightly on the lips, his beard scratching the young man’s face delightfully. <br />
<br />
Then the plumber pulled away, leaving the young man with the taste of the man on his lips and the itchy beginnings of a five o’clock shadow on his face.<br />
<br />
“Thank you daddy.” Chris felt that big throbbing cock pressing against the seat of his pants and moaned. <br />
<br />
He felt the bear bump him with his crotch, on purpose this time. Jim kissed Chris’ scruffy cheek and slowly withdrew, hand trailing along Chris’ side, pulling off his shirt as he did, leaving the young man’s muscular upper body bare. <br />
<br />
The heavy weight of the plumber’s gut lifted, freeing him. <br />
<br />
Chris panted, feeling weirdly hot under the sink. The plumber rummaged through his bag, setting up a kit for the repair. All the while, the red light played across the jock’s form. He was too busy wondering why the bear of a man was turning him on so much to notice his muscles smooth over as a sheathe of fat layered him. Not enough to give him more than a small gut, but it was clear he’d gained the dread Freshman Fifty. Light hairs prickled across his body. Not thick like Jim’s, but it was clear in another ten years, he’d end up being a big hairy bear like the plumber.<br />
<br />
Jim came back with screws and extra piping and caulk. All the tools he’d need to fix the sink and the pipes behind it. He set them within reach of Chris’s plumper hand.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?” Chris asked, his voice a little deeper and warped. It didn’t quite sound like his old voice at all.<br />
<br />
“Enough play time for now. You’ve gotta learn as my apprentice. We can’t just fuck around all day.” Jim winked and rubbed Chris’ ass. “Get to work, son.”<br />
<br />
“Yes daddy!” Chris smiled back at his father brightly.<br />
<br />
He blinked and picked up the tools, unsure why he’d thought of Jim as his father. He was his…employer? Somehow that didn’t sound right either. Either way, he needed to fix this sink so his fa-so Jim would be happy.<br />
<br />
As he worked, his pants grew tighter and seemed to slip down his backside, revealing his crack. Chris didn’t notice the cool wash of air, and if he did, he didn’t care. He was busy. That was until a thick digit slipped down his sweat-slicked crack and gently probed his rosebud.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Chris jumped, almost bumping his head on the bottom of the sink.<br />
<br />
“Careful there, son.” Jim said, withdrawing his finger and giving it a sniff before licking it clean. “Don’t wanna hurt yourself.”<br />
<br />
Chris gulped and nodded before resuming his work. At first it was difficult, but that warm red light refocused on the back of his head. Suddenly, he was fixing it like he’d done repairs hundreds of times. When his father’s wettened finger returned to probe his hole, he just moaned.<br />
<br />
The blunt digit soon slipped through his tight pucker and began to rub something inside him that made him gasp in pleasure. He grunted and gasped as he worked, his father’s digits penetrating him deeply. As soon as his ring relaxed, more digits inserted themselves inside of him. <br />
<br />
Between the tingles and his father’s big finger playing with his asshole, Chris almost came right there. Behind him, he heard a slapping sound. Chris turned to see the fat plumber rubbing his thick rod. His hairy moobs jiggled mesmerizingly with each stroke. Jim pulled down Chris’s jeans, exposing his asshole.<br />
<br />
“Up on the counter.” Jim ordered gruffly.<br />
<br />
Chris knew what was coming and hauled himself up. It seemed more difficult to do that is should have been. His furry beergut jiggled when he got to his feet, which was confusing, because he was sure he’d been toned a few minutes ago. That didn’t matter, though. All that mattered was making daddy happy so he could ride his father’s fat cock.<br />
<br />
He leaned over the counter, facing the mirror, and froze.<br />
<br />
The person in the reflection couldn’t possibly be him. For one thing, he didn’t have a receding hairline, or a scruffy beard, or a wide, rough face that looked a lot like Jim’s if he were younger. And his body was alien to him as well. He didn’t remember being so hairy, or having a beergut hanging off his stomach, pressing against the cool counter, or an ass wider and rounder than he remembered ever having.<br />
<br />
Or…did he? <br />
<br />
The waves of tingles and warmth in his brain were growing rather intense. Something was off, but before he could think of what it was, Jim had positioned himself behind Chris and plopped his fat gut on his back. That big, throbbing cock pressed deep into his entrance, making Chris cry happily and press back, working the dick further into his hole.<br />
<br />
At first, the stretch of his dad’s cock in his hole was painful, but the longer the two lingered in the red light, the less it hurt. By the time Jim had started plowing his son properly, Chris’s hole was sloppy and loose, precum running in rivulets down his fat thighs.<br />
<br />
Chris had a hard time thinking properly. It was all so confusing. He could tell something important was slipping away from him with every thrust from his father’s mighty rod. Memories were beginning to crowd out his old life. He remembered learning about different wrenches from Jim. He was taught how to fixed leaky pipes, replacing broken parts of tubing. His proudest moment is when he finally confessed to his father how much he loved him. As he kissed Jim, he felt his father’s bushy beard and all his cares melted away.<br />
<br />
The former jock-turned plumber’s son railed against these memories. He had to escape somehow. He desperately tried to move his body, but it was impossible with that fat gut on him, pinning him to the counter.<br />
<br />
“Daddy, please, please, please!” Chris cried out, the cock bumping his prostate over and over. It all felt so good. The tingles increased and he found himself desperately tugging at his nipples and moaning incoherently. “Oh Daddy, daddy, daddy!”<br />
<br />
“Daddy loves you.”  Jim said huskily, his hands groping his son’s body. “I love you so. Fuckin&#39;. Much!”<br />
<br />
The fat plumber drove his cock deep inside Chris. His cock twitched and unloaded a torrent of cum inside of the tubby apprentice. Jim’s big hands gripped Chris’ love handles tight, his hairy gut pressing against the young man’s back.<br />
<br />
Feeling his own father cum inside of him drove all thoughts out of Chris’ mind in one bright red explosion of tingles. He shuddered and blew his load all over the bathroom counter. He sagged on top of it, sweating and out of breath.<br />
<br />
His father gently licked the sweat off of his back and took a few pictures for his social media. Chris was too tired to care, lost in a lovely after glow.<br />
<br />
The red light shut off, the Molder moving on to its next target.</p>
