<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Are you ready Anna? It is almost time to go&quot; David asked while adjusting his suit. <br />
&quot;Almost done&quot; her voice came from behind the door of the bathroom.<br />
&quot;Come on dear, we&#39;ll be late.&quot;<br />
The door slowly opened.<br />
Anna wore a beautiful long dress, it was dark blue and exalted her wide hips. A thin line of sparkle encircled her eyes and decorated the tips of her long ears.<br />
&quot;You are stunning.&quot;<br />
She smiled  and blushed.<br />
David looked at her again and saw something in her look.<br />
&quot;Is everything alright?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Sure&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well...about what happened this morning...&quot;<br />
&quot;You want to talk about it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes... I don&#39;t know...was it right? I was so horny and curious in that moment but now...i feel kinda bad. We came here togheter, we are letting our humanity go, but I...&quot; her voice was trembling &quot;...I don&#39;t want to let our love go.&quot;<br />
She was almost sobbing .<br />
&quot;I will always love you Anna. We are changing, our instincts are changing, our minds, our looks are changing but my love for you will never change. Now, come here.&quot;<br />
He hugged her, gently stroking her head.<br />
She slowly calmed down.<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to feel bad, we came here to have fun and be happy together and we both knew that those kind of situations are pretty normal here. You did nothing wrong, you did what felt right, you liked it and you made a new friend. Look at it as a new experience.&quot; <br />
He stroked her long soft ears.<br />
&quot;They are getting really long...&quot;<br />
&quot;You like them?&quot; <br />
Without replying he kissed her.<br />
&quot;Lets go now.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The Bacchus and Venus was one of the most renown nightclubs in Pleasure City, from the outside it looked like a Greek temple surrounded by hundreds of white marble columns.<br />
The main hall was filled with tables and in the center was a fountain richly decorated with statue of Venus and Bacchus. Bacchus was holding up a jar from which red wine was constantly flowing while Venus was drinking from a cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna! David! We are here!&quot; Clara called. <br />
She was sitting at a round table with all the others. She was wearing a white dress with an open back to let her tail out. Mark was next to her dressed in a stylish evening suite. Carl and Joan were both naked as were many of the people at the other tables. Paul was dressed with a simple shirt and long throusers but no shoes and Rich was without shirt.  <br />
Anna and David joined them at their table. <br />
“Hi guys, glad you are here. You must absolutely try this drink, it is fantastic.&quot; Clara was drinking from a tall glass a liquid of vibrant green color.<br />
&quot;We have to celebrate, Joan and Carl just received confirmation they can move to the countryside tomorrow.&quot; said Mark handing them two glasses with the same drink.<br />
&quot;Congratulations guys, but why are you moving so soon? You haven&#39;t changed much yet.&quot; David asked Carl and Joan.<br />
&quot;Hee haww heee, haaawww.&quot; Carl replied after taking another sip.<br />
&quot;Well ... we asked to move earlier than usual because Carl lost his voice completely this afternoon, so we will complete our transformation into a beautiful quiet farmhouse.&quot; said Joan brushing Carl&#39;s hairs. <br />
&quot;Good for you, it is a huge step&quot; said Anna as she raised her glass.<br />
&quot;To Carl and Joan, cheers!&quot;<br />
&quot;Cheers!&quot; the rest of the table joined her toast.<br />
She tasted the green liquid. The taste of alcohol mixed with the aroma of freshly cut grass and mint flooded her mouth.<br />
&quot;Wow... it is really good.&quot; she said as she emptied the glass.<br />
&quot;Yes it is very refreshing.&quot; agreed David.<br />
They ordered immediately more drinks.<br />
&quot;We will go live near the mountains when it will be time.&quot; said Paul.<br />
&quot;Yes, we will have a large pasture at the feet of the mountains with fresh water and clean hay every day.&quot; continued Rich taking Paul&#39;s hand.<br />
&quot;Sounds really nice guys, i&#39;m happy for you. What about you and Clara, Mark?&quot; asked David.<br />
&quot;We haven&#39;t decided yet, for now we just want to enjoy the changes and have fun.&quot; <br />
&quot;Let&#39;s drink some more! We are going to be all braying donkeys, we shouldn&#39;t be planning.&quot; said Clara as she gulped down another glass of green booze.<br />
&quot;Why shouldn&#39;t we? It is nice to have dreams and desires even if we are going to be donkeys.&quot; said Anna.<br />
&quot;Yes, we always wanted to become donkeys and have foals somedays here on the island.&quot; <br />
Clara stood up and inhaled deeply inflating her chest.<br />
&quot;HHHEEEE  HHAAAWWW&quot; she brayed loudly with all her strength, from the other tables more brays come in in response.<br />
&quot;See? We are going to be animals! We already are!&quot; she said while drinking some more. <br />
&quot;Clara, calm down please. All that booze is going to your head.&quot; Mark said.<br />
&quot;Why should I care? I want to have fun, I want to drink, I want to fuck.&quot; she yelled.<br />
She jumped on the table with unsure feet.<br />
&quot;HHHHEEE HHAAAAAWWWW&quot; she brayed again arching her back and moving her tail.<br />
&quot;Clara please, you&#39;re drunk, you&#39;ll get hurt.&quot; Mark tried to get her off the table while everyone else was ready to catch her if she fell.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a donkey! HEEE HAWWW&quot;  she took off her white dress and with a quick leap ran to the fountain.<br />
Clara entered the fountain and drank directly from the jar of Bacchus until she passed out and fell into the fountain wine.<br />
Everyone ran to help, worried about her. They took her out of the fountain, but she was still unconscious.<br />
&quot;Clara say something!&quot; Mark was desperate because she wasn&#39;t responding.<br />
&quot;Let me help her!&quot; David said pushing Mark aside.<br />
He closed her nose and blew air into her lungs several times, then began to rhythmically press his hands on her chest until with a cough she spat out some wine and regained consciousness.<br />
The club staff came right after with a doctor and helped her on a stretcher, she was still scared, drunk and barely conscious so they decided to take her away to rest.<br />
&quot;Guys, I&#39;m so sorry that the evening is ruined.&quot; Mark lowered his ears. <br />
&quot;Now I have to go to make sure I&#39;m next to her when she wakes up.&quot; <br />
He looked at David. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll never forget what you did for us. Thank you.&quot;</p>
