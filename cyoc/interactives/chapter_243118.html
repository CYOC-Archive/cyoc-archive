<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will made his way back home texting George on the way. He explained he wasn&#39;t the first this had happened to but it could have been worse if he had chosen to become a girl instead. He explained that he needed to cycle back and forth a few times with his dads loafers and he should be good but will need to watch himself over the next few weeks for a more rapid than normal puberty.<br />
<br />
Getting home he raced to the bathroom avoiding everyone and hoping he was still his usual fresh faced self but unsurprised by the midday shadow that was coming in. Despite still changing, it was much less severe than it had been, he could pass for a senior in high school but wasn&#39;t the bulky muscle beast who was clearly in his mid 20s. This was a win! Most pleasant, was the fact that it felt weird to have stubble, height, and muscle mass! He could still recall things he shouldn&#39;t from his dad&#39;s life, but it felt like a piece of knowledge, not a memory. He really was getting back to normal!<br />
<br />
Going to his room, he pulled out the loafers and began cycling through each identity. Like before, becoming his dad was faster than reverting, but only the first time. Once he had become his dad and reverted back, the speed slowed down making him feel as though the socks were getting tired of his bullshit... which made him chuckle in glee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully this means no more sporadic transformations!&quot; he exclaimed to his room.<br />
<br />
Finishing the third cycling between himself and his dad, he felt that he had sated his body&#39;s need to become his father, hopefully several times over. It was now mid afternoon so he felt that he should know if it worked by dinner time. <br />
<br />
What to do until dinner time? He considered staying in his room and playing video games but if he does still change in obvious ways, its safer to be out of the house. He remembered the advice of the store owner/wizard to have a backup pair of shoes in case he realizes a month or two from now he is still developing rapidly... but not overnight. He had enough time to walk into town and buy a spare pair of shoes and come back if he hurries.<br />
<br />
He desperately wanted to not bring a spare pair of shoes and the magic socks but thought better than to risk it until he knows he solidly fixed the transformation. He packed up an old grocery bag and placed his soccer shoes in there after wearing them to make sure he will actually return to normal if he needs to use them, along with the magic socks, and after realizing he wants his backup plan to work and he will need to test things before buying it, his dad&#39;s loafers. He told his mom he was going to run to the store and was soon on his way.<br />
<br />
He made it there without issue and went to the clearance section looking for a cheap pair of flip flops or frankly, anything that would be considered outside appropriate footwear. He only had $14 left after paying his friends back for the beer they got him last night. It was weird to even think he drank beer. He found what he was looking for, cheap sandals for $9.99. <br />
<br />
He slipped the cheap, size 12 foam on his feet, (opting for his dad&#39;s size to make it easier during reversion.) and took a few steps in them. They were bound together with plastic string and could only shuffle a few inches each step but that should count as him being the last person to wear them. He slipped them off and found a changing room. Inside he undressed and reverted to his father&#39;s form using the loafers and, once transformed, used the flip flops to change back.<br />
<br />
Again the transformations were slower than before but that could just be because he had done so many transformations today. But the point is, it worked! Will collected his things, made his purchase, and began the treck back with $3 and some change to spare.<br />
<br />
Will finally felt this chapter was coming to a close. He understood and defeated a curse, knows how to avoid it in the future, has a backup plan, and can proceed with a little more caution going forward. He felt great! As Will was on his way home he texted his mom that he was done at the store and may be a little late for dinner but was on his way. He got home and...</p>
