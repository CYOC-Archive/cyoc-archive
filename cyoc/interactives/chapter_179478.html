<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff scrolled through the options, considering each one and then rejecting it for one reason or another. This is silly, he thought to himself. I’m never going to be able to decide on something like this. I just have to go for it. He found the random button, lingered on it for a moment, and pressed enter. His cursor turned into a spinning wheel as the page reloaded. “Cake,” an automated voice said out loud.<br />
<br />
“Cake?” Jeff gasped. <br />
<br />
A pop up window appeared. It listed several customizing options. He could select a new environment for his cake form to exist in, or somewhere particular in his current environment he wanted to be. Jeff gulped. He typed in the name of his boyfriend, Kyle. He set himself as a full freshly cooked cake resting on Kyle’s kitchen counter. Kyle would be getting home from classes soon. The timing was perfect. Turned on, Jeff pressed enter. <br />
<br />
Jeff stepped back from his computer, and looked around the room expectantly. Nothing was happening. The screen said his transformation had begun, was this all a prank? <br />
<br />
A warmth had begun to grow inside his body, so subtle at first that Jeff didn’t realize he was feeling it until he noticed he was sweating slightly. It was a warm, pleasurable feeling. It was kind of like the feeling Jeff had when he was just starting to come down with a cold. It had the slight wooziness, but it was all pleasure. Jeff began to unbutton his pants. He pulled them down, then stepped out of his underwear. His feet were really sweaty, he noticed as he pulled his socks off. By the time Jeff pulled his shirt off, it was sticking to his chest. Throwing it on the ground, Jeff felt momentarily chilly as he shivered in his birthday suit in the slightly drafty room. But then the warmth grew stronger, and the sweating resumed. He must have some type of fever, he thought. But fevers don’t make you feel good, the way this did. What was happening to him. Absentmindedly Jeff’s sweaty right hand began to slide towards his penis, tugging at it gently as the warmth increased. He closed his eyes and began to enjoy himself. It felt terrific.<br />
<br />
If Jeff hadn’t closed his eyes in pleasure, he might have noticed the first changes. His body was sweating profusely, filling the room with the smell of body odour. But as the seconds dragged by, the odour Jeff’s body gave off slowly changed. It became a noticeably sweeter and inviting smell, while still retaining an undertone of the masculine scent of Jeff. As his odour changed, mushing sounds filled the air. Jeff’s torso began to condense. It began ever so slowly, as his belly button moved closer to his hips. His thighs began to swell slightly, gently deforming as they squished into each other and slowly began to merge, making a crunching sound that made Jeff’s eyes snap open. <br />
<br />
He looked around the room, noticing immediately that he was shorter than his usual 6 feet. He looked down, and saw that his missing height was because his upper legs had merged, and were pulling his upper body towards them. Jeff should have screamed, but a wave of the warmth washed over him, and a moan escaped his lips instead. His belly button slowly pushed outwards, becoming indistinguishable from his softening abdomen. Jeff felt a thickening sensation around his ass. He turned to his mirror and pulled his cheeks apart, watching his asshole pucker and close, and then pulling his cheeks together as those too sealed. Jeff looked down at his feet, watching his toenails sink into his toes, and the slight dusting of hair on his feet pull inside his body as his toes began to thicken and merge together. He held his left hand up, watching it do the same. His right hand kept gently masturbating his cock. <br />
<br />
As Jeff’s nipples glazed over and pulled inside his body, his chest began to crunch down into what had been his lower body even faster. As it did, Jeff heard more of the mushy sounds, and felt his torso thickening as it squished together. His lower legs were condensing now as well. Another wave of warmth came from within, causing him to sweat even further. His body felt heavier, as if the sweat was heavy, and his body had to support itself. Jeff held his left hand up to his forehead, and was shocked to find himself wiping a thicker substance than he had expected. He looked at his hand in astonishment. It was a thickening white substance, almost like cum... or icing. Jeff questioningly brought the hand to his mouth, and cautiously licked it. It tasted incredible, like cream cheese icing, but there was a different taste there too mixed in with the sweetness. It was his sweat, but it was also his icing. <br />
<br />
Jeff closed his eyes again as another wave of pleasure rocked his body. The crunching and mushing sounds were stronger now, because as Jeff bemusedly tasted himself, his bones and insides were softening as they simplified themselves. From the complexity of the human body, Jeff’s insides were liquefying, mushing, expanding and merging into a single substance, thick and warm yet also light and fluffy. His body continued to sweat droplets of sweet sweat, which was collecting and thickening all over his skin. <br />
<br />
The pleasure was building. Jeff began to stroke his cock faster and faster until he felt himself cum... but the pleasure continued even after he orgasmed. It was harder to look down as his neck began to thicken and squish, but Jeff saw that his cum was different. It was thick like his sweat was becoming. He touched his leaking cock with his hand and brought it up to his mouth. It was delicious, like his sweat had been. Sweet icing sugar and cream cheese, mixed with the salty sweet taste of his cum. Kyle was going to love him, Jeff thought. Jeff’s thoughts of Kyle were changing too, thinking of him less as his committed boyfriend and more of a living thing that Jeff wanted to get inside. The sexual thoughts made him shudder. More cum/icing oozed out of Jeff’s cockhead as his shaft began to pull towards his body, shrinking slowly. The icing began to coat his deforming midsection. Jeff looked up, seeing the desk of his computer above him. He closed his eyes in pleasure as they began to sink into his head.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jeff’s clothes were completing a startling transformation of their own. As the sweaty icing Jeff’s body produced dripped into them, they began to flatten and spread underneath his sticky, thickening feet. As they melted into a clear, cold substance that was in sharp contrast to the pleasurable warmth of Jeff’s increasingly inanimate body, the substance spread out, forming what looked like a round pool underneath Jeff. The pool thickened and cooled rapidly, hardening as it shifted back into three dimensions. Jeff flexed his feet in pleasure one last time before the joints dissolved, and his feet deformed and slowly spread outward along the now glass of his plate (thickening enough as they did to keep his body from falling over). The thick warm mush of Jeff’s feet flowed, then slowed and began to harden just as it came up to the rounded edges of the plate. As Jeff’s body weight decreased, the plate began to rise off the ground, a thinner base forming at the bottom of the plate as it stretched up slightly to become a serving platter. Jeff shivered as the bottom of his mushy body hardened nicely, forming the perfect crust. The chill of the cold hard glass contrasted nicely with the growing intense warmth inside of him.<br />
<br />
A loud crack filled the room as Jeff’s shoulders began to collapse into his changing torso. His arms were against the sides of his body, sticking to  the sweaty, mutating abdomen, and then slowly sinking into it. His body was shrinking in relative terms but thickening outwards and upwards in absolute terms. His deformed abdomen flowed and morphed alongside the hardening base of the cake, becoming a perfect circle shape. Strangely, Jeff’s birthmark (a small discolouration formerly located on his inner thigh) was visible on the side of the cake, showing slightly through the thickening icing sweat his body was producing. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s head had sunk into his neck, and now his groaning head was beginning to flatten itself on top of his also flattening shoulders. His hair and ears pulled into his deforming head, his nose softening and merging with his face. His eyes had now completely glazed over, the bones of his head softening as they lost shape. Another wave of pleasure made Jeff’s mouth open, as icing welled up in his throat. His mouth sunk down into the flat surface of the cake as his head melted, his open lips overflowing with icing as they were covered, leaving a subtle indent on the otherwise flat surface. <br />
<br />
With one final audible squish, the final internal  remnants of Jeff’s human body melted into sweet icing. It slowly oozed through the cake, moistening it and sectioning it (and sending waves of pleasure through Jeff’s still conscious body). Jeff’s brain no longer existed, long since taken over by icing and soft cake, but Jeff was still aware inside, even though his body was inanimate. His thoughts had changed, as he no longer thought of himself as Jeff, or even as a conscious being. He was food, an edible object whose only desire was to be eaten. Eaten by Kyle specifically. The cake did not remember why, but it knew it wanted to be inside Kyle’s body. This pleasurable thought made the cake’s internal warmth even stronger as it moistened further.<br />
<br />
The room began to flicker and dissolve, melting and merging as the cake and serving platter it was on top was transferred to the kitchen counter of Kyle’s apartment. Jeff’s warm, delicious smell with a barely noticeable hint of male BO wafted through the apartment. Kyle would soon be home.</p>
