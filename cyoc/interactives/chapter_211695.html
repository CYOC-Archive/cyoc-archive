<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Lauren and Annie slept, some changes that Lauren hadn&#39;t intended began molding her body. In her haste to apply the next day of punishment, she had forgotten to exempt herself from the reality changes that Annie&#39;s transformation would imply. As Lauren subconsciously turned on her side, her own ass began to fill out, causing a noticeable difference to her covered silhouette.<br />
<br />
But this wasn&#39;t the only change. She had assigned Annie &quot;C-cup&quot; breasts, but Annie was still barely even 21. Her breasts would continue to grow and swell to match the fertility suggested by her hips. Whose genes did she inherit this quality from? By the time the Chronivac had rewritten reality, Lauren was laying with an ample 36 G between her arms.<br />
<br />
Her skin began to darken ever so slightly, and her hair became slightly more curled. The ends of her nipples fading from their light scarlet to a deep chocolate. Although her breasts had been dry for years, the changes meant she&#39;d be lactating well into her 50s now.<br />
<br />
Her lips swelled and darkened ever so slightly, but enough to give Lauren a slight &quot;pout.&quot; She also subconsciously gained a greater attraction to giving head and anal, but those were activities she hadn&#39;t wholly minded in her youth to begin with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lauren tried to turn over on her back, but found that she was having some difficulty doing so. This stirred her out of her deep slumber. As she tried again, she felt a lot of unfamiliar weight between her arms and on her back. She used all her might and pulled herself as hard as she could and flopped to the left. She found her pelvis thrust in the air, as her massive cushions made her back arc. Meanwhile, her massive breasts pulled both ways; Lauren felt like her chest was ripping itself apart but each breast was resting squarely on the bed to her sides.<br />
<br />
She grasped for her phone sitting on her headboard, and turned on its light. She threw off her covers and was aghast at what she saw: Two massive breasts (&quot;what size? I didn&#39;t even know they could get this big!&quot;). Maneuvering her torso around, she took a look at what she was laying on. Even though she could definitely feel the familiar embrace of the bed on her ass, she was afraid to see what she already knew. Her tummy was well-toned, but she could barely make out the full shape of her legs. She felt around back and could make out a huge shelf where there wasn&#39;t one before.<br />
<br />
Struggling at first, Lauren hefted herself up. Once she was up, her body reminded her that she made it around just fine every other day. She got up and jiggled with every step to the bathroom to assess the damages. She could easily undo this whenever she wanted to and it was still a few hours before Annie would be awake.<br />
<br />
She flicked on the light and assessed the tanned stranger staring back in the mirror. With both hands, she hefted up one of her large breasts and inspected the nipple. The texture was a little different than she was used to. Then again, she was a little cold and her nips were responding accordingly.<br />
<br />
She turned around and checked out her ass. Whereas most people that had an ass this size would have weird fat distortions and dents; her ass was perfectly smooth and toned in spite of its impossible width. Out of curiosity, she gave it a light and playful spank. She felt a familiar warmth bubble up in the pits of her belly as a whispered moan escaped her lips. Her skin flushed with warmth.<br />
<br />
(&quot;There&#39;s no way...did I make it so Annie inherited her conditions...from me?) Lauren&#39;s breathing was a little quicker. She had to know if all the changes were in play. She smacked her ass twice more, each with increasing force. Lauren nearly screamed with the third orgasm, as she covered her mouth with a towel to keep from waking Annie up. She felt a long unfamiliar pressure build within her chest and release, as breast milk spurted out of her nipples.<br />
<br />
As Lauren used the towel to catch the liquid before it made a mess, she checked her reflection. As she had written, her lips had swollen just a little bit more. She now had a slight resting pout. (&quot;And I bet they suck a mean dick too...&quot;) her mind contributed unbidden. Lauren shook her head. Her libido was a bit higher than usual too.<br />
<br />
After finishing assessing her changes, she decided that she could live with them at least until after Annie had left for the day of classes. That would give her some time to sort out what went wrong while keeping Annie&#39;s day of punishment the same. She also wanted to mess with Annie a little, and planned to behave like nothing was out of place.<br />
<br />
She took her morning shower, noticing she was giving a little more love to her ass than she ever had before. Midway through the shower, she gave herself another spank and her knees wobbled a bit with the force of the orgasm, as her pussy juices flowed down the drain with the wastewater.<br />
<br />
She toweled off and got dressed. Luckily, the reality shift had meant that her whole wardrobe now accommodated her more demanding figure. Her panties had all become G-Strings (&quot;After all, there&#39;s no use even trying to fit into regular panties with thighs like this&quot;) She had plenty of properly-sized bras, though she had to struggle a little to fit into most of the pairs of pants she had. Most of them hugged her ass perfectly, left little to the imagination, and no matter what she did revealed just the slightest bit of asscrack.<br />
<br />
Lauren began getting ready for her day ahead.</p>
