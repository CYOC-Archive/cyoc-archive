<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You walked inside and shut the door behind you, and the first thing you saw was Joan, and all of the other cheerleaders ass naked sitting around the locker room chatting. &quot;Hey, you made it.&quot; Joan said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait isn&#39;t she that victim of Jock&#39;s?&quot; Another girl said, who you recognized as a a girl named Casey<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, which is why she&#39;s a perfect addition to the team.&quot; Joan said<br />
<br />
You told the others your name, and they seemed to accept it to a point. &quot;Why are you called that? It&#39;s a guys name.&quot; Another cheerleader, Stacey asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wasn&#39;t always a girl.&quot; You said obediently being honest <br />
<br />
&quot;Ew! What?!&quot; Stacey asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you calm down Stacey, it&#39;s fine, remember she&#39;s been harassed like us so she knows what it&#39;s like.&quot; Joan said defending you<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, still though you need a better name. How about Sam? It&#39;s unisex so you don&#39;t have to be embarrassed by anything.&quot; Stacey said<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, so what now?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you texted your parents yet? They&#39;re going to want to know.&quot; Joan asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap, let me do that now.&quot; You said pulling out your phone.<br />
<br />
You texted your mom, and explained that you were harassed, and that the cheerleaders wanted you to become one of them because they&#39;ve been harassed by the same person. You also explained that you were with them in the locker rooms right now, and that you would call her when you wanted to leave. Thankfully your mom responded back via text,&quot;Well if they truly want to help you then fine, just don&#39;t get over your head, and call me alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
You texted back,&quot;okay&quot; and put your phone away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m good now, so what are we going to do now?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we&#39;re just sitting around and gossiping, and just fooling around as we always do here. We&#39;re varsity so we certainly have a lot to talk about, so strip down and have a seat with us.&quot; Another cheerleader, Ashley said and you did as she said obediently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, girls we may want to stay close to Sam here in the halls. You see, Jock easily took advantage of her because she can&#39;t refuse an order, or a command. You know that little secret that I have right?&quot; Joan said<br />
<br />
&quot;That you&#39;re the decedent of a witch, and you have magical powers.&quot; Ashley said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot; You asked looking at Joan<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry Sam, but this whole magic thing isn&#39;t exactly my strength you can say. You see I was trying to put an obedience spell on my little brother, because he is an annoying little shit, but instead the spell sort of did its own thing. So when I heard about you I knew that you were affected by it, didn&#39;t intend to turn you into vixen though, so for what it&#39;s worth I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Sam said<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you turn me back?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I can try, but if my spell fucked up this badly, I could just as easily make things ten times worse for you.&quot; Joan said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, alright then,&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways as I was saying, she can&#39;t disobey an order, so if one of us is around when Jock is. Then we can basically tip the scales on his little &quot;fox orgy&quot; as he calls it.&quot; Joan said<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t remind me,&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s no wonder he went after you, your rack outranks any of ours. Just out of curiosity what sis Jock made you do?&quot; Ashley asked<br />
<br />
&quot;But before you answer, I would like everyone here to know that Sam had no control over the situation. As I said she has to obey any orders she&#39;s given.&quot; Joan said<br />
<br />
&quot;I...uh, he ordered me to suck his cock, and I obeyed under the influence. In any other situation I would have just ran, so please don&#39;t consider me a slut.&quot; You said blushing embarrassed <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we don&#39;t, you couldn&#39;t do anything there anyways. That&#39;s all behind you now, so let&#39;s just have some fun here while we can. As cheerleaders, and girls.&quot; Casey said<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and that collar you have on fits you, where did you get it?&quot; Stacey asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Jock put it on me after...you know, I was going to throw it away, but I thought it looked nice.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, didn&#39;t think Jock was such a furry lover, and Sam, do not tell anyone about that secret of my decent please?&quot; Joan said<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t, promise.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you won&#39;t, because that&#39;s just who you are. Also another thing that&#39;s cool is that you can just gain skills from commands. Like this, Sam you are going to love being a cheerleader, and you&#39;ll be great at it too.&quot; Joan said<br />
<br />
Suddenly you felt something small change about you, and you felt a little bit more peppy towards the school team. <br />
<br />
&quot;That a girl, everyone be careful about what you tell Sam here to do, because spells I have seen have a very litteral way of acting. So just be careful about what you tell Sam to do.&quot; Joan said, and one by one all of the girls nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;For now let&#39;s get to know our newest member. I have been wondering how your body feels with all of that fur too.&quot; Ashley said<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, how does it feel to be a vixen?&quot; Stacey asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s really weird for me, just because I&#39;m a girl now I guess. Besides that my tail gets in the way of a lot of things, and shoes don&#39;t go so well with paws.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;This may be an odd question to ask, but can I feel your breasts? I know it&#39;s a personal matter, and I have a boyfriend and all, but they&#39;re all furry.&quot; Ashley asked<br />
<br />
You blushed,&quot;Sure, I guess, I can see what you mean though. Just don&#39;t make things weird.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam, trust me, we&#39;re both girls so it&#39;s fine, I won&#39;t squeeze.&quot; Ashley said, and he ran her hand through the fur covered your boobs, and you felt aroused feeling the pleasure of your soft breast being caressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you like any boys at all Sam?&quot; Casey asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s my first day being a girl, and I was unwilling orally fucked in the bathroom by Jock. So what do you think?&quot; You asked rhetorically <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she hasn&#39;t hit that stage yet. Who&#39;s clothes are those anyways? If you were a guy then how do you have them?&quot; Stacey asked<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom, let me use them. I honestly can&#39;t believe that I actually fit into them.&quot; You sighed<br />
<br />
You talked with the girls for a couple more hours, and you gossiped about most people on the football team. Joan informed you that her mom was head of the cheer squad, and that she knows about the magic. Joan also admitted that she&#39;s grounded from most electronics except her phone for the next six months because of what she did with the spell. Joan signed you up for the group text, and she said that she&#39;ll arrange something for you with her mom so you can officially be on the squad.<br />
<br />
You left later with your mom, and explained what happened in the locker room and she seemed relieved. However, you didn&#39;t tell her about Joan&#39;s magic as you were obeying her orders. &quot;Your father is all worried and stressed out about this whole fox thing. Who was that guy you said harassed you?&quot; Your mom asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Some guy named Jock, he&#39;s been doing the same to the cheerleaders for some time now, and he put a collar on me. The collar looks nice, but Jock is certainly perverted. Also the cheerleaders and I found out something that kind of disturbs me.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Your mom asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t disobey anyone, any command I am given will get carried out by me. This is another reason why they said they want me to join, and they said that they would be careful in what they say to me so I don&#39;t end up doing anything risky. They also said that they will try to stay close to me in the halls so that I don&#39;t end up getting harassed again.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, okay anything else?&quot; Your mom asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but they are calling me Sam now, and that&#39;s because they want me to have a more feminine name. So they chose one that was unisex ultimately, but they&#39;re nice and they said that they would get things situated with the coach.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that&#39;s all right, now let&#39;s go home and deal with your father.&quot; Your mom said<br />
<br />
You got home and did the exact thing that you had done this morning with your mom, despite the fact that you explained everything to him prior. You did your homework, ate dinner and took a shower later that night in efforts to prepare for tomorrow. <br />
<br />
You woke up in the morning and....</p>
