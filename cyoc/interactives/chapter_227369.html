<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the morning he woke up, because the sun was shining in his face. He was still naked and the sunlight was warming his massive body. He sat and stretched his back and arms. He stood up and was looking at his body.<br />
&quot;It was the best gift from grandpas,&quot; he thought.<br />
His cock was soft and was a 18 inches long and 6 inches in diameter. He went to the bathroom and took a shower. When he was finished and dried his hairy body, he put his tank top and gym shorts on. He left his room and headed to the dining room.<br />
&quot;Good morning, son,&quot; David said<br />
Jeff grinned back at him and said, &quot;Yeah, I had a late-night snack after everyone went to bed last night.&quot;<br />
David raised an eyebrow in surprise. &quot;Really? What did you eat?&quot;<br />
Jeff hesitated for a moment before replying, &quot;Just some leftovers from last night&#39;s dinner and from the pot in the fridge. I was really hungry,.&quot;<br />
David nodded thoughtfully before saying and smiled, &quot;I know. I&#39;m keeping this food for you till you were 10. I increase the amount of food to fight your hunger.&quot;<br />
With this words Jeff&#39;s body reacts and he start to grow. His muscles was swelling, his tank top and shorts was ripping and his cock was growing. He was breathing heavily and his heart was beating faster. When he grew up, his clothes was completely ripped, and his cock and balls was a mass of muscles and hairs. He was 11&#39;3 tall and weighed over 1600 lbs. His cock was 22 inches long and 7 inches thick.<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s amazing&quot; Jeff said, and smiled, showing his white teeth.<br />
As Jeff continued to convince his family that he was growing at an incredible rate, he knew that he needed to find a way to convince them that it wasn&#39;t just food that was making him grow. He needed to find a way to convince them that he was lifting heavier weights than anyone else in their family and working out harder than ever before.<br />
He walked down the hallway and opened the door to his father&#39;s office. He entered the room and found his dad and grandfather sitting at the desk, looking over some papers.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up, kid?&quot; David asked.<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing, dad. Just wanted to ask you something,&quot; Jeff replied.<br />
&quot;Sure, kid. What is it?&quot; David asked.<br />
Jeff looked over at his grandfather and said, &quot;Can I speak with dad alone, please?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course, son,&quot; Elias said.<br />
The older giant got up and walked over to the door, and then exited the room, closing the door behind him.<br />
&quot;So, what did you want to talk to me about, son?&quot; David asked.<br />
Jeff looked down at his feet, and then back up at his dad. &quot;Well, it&#39;s kind of hard to explain, dad.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just say it, kid,&quot; David replied.<br />
&quot;Well, you know that I&#39;m working out a lot, right?&quot; Jeff said.<br />
David nodded, and the younger giant continued. &quot;Well, I was just wondering, since I&#39;m getting bigger, if you think it would be a good idea if I start using heavier weights. But my gym doesn&#39;t have...&quot;<br />
David interrupted his son and said, &quot;Oh, no worries, son. We have plenty of heavy weights here. I have a special set, I have never used. You can have it, if you like.&quot;<br />
Jeff nodded and his muscles started to swell, and his cock and balls was growing. He was breathing heavily and his heart was beating faster. When he grow up, his clothes was completely ripped. He stood naked in front of his father<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; Jeff said, a little embarrassed.<br />
David chuckled and said, &quot;You&#39;re welcome, kid.&quot;<br />
&quot;By the way, how did you know I was working out?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
&quot;Oh, well, I can hear the music coming from your room. Plus, you seem to always be lifting weights or running when you&#39;re not studying.&quot;<br />
Jeff smiled, and David continued. &quot;I&#39;m proud of you, kid. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a boy your age who works out more than you do.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; Jeff replied.<br />
David stood up and came over to his naked son. David was shoter almost 3 feet so his eyes were level with his son&#39;s nipples.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a good son, and you&#39;ll be a good man someday,&quot; the older giant said.<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; the younger giant replied.<br />
&quot;Oh, son, I believe you should change your room and live with your granddads on the ground floor. You became to heavy for the second floor and stairs. What do you say?&quot; David asked.<br />
&quot;Of course, dad. Thank you. But, where should I put my stuff?&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;Your room will be the second guest room. It&#39;s right next to Derek and Elias&#39; room,&quot; David replied.<br />
&quot;Ok, thanks, dad,&quot; Jeff said, and gave his dad a big bear hug.<br />
&quot;Now, let&#39;s go and tell everyone,&quot; David said. &quot;And please before that take something on&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, dad. But I have to change my clothes first. My tank top and gym shorts were ripped and they don&#39;t fit me anymore,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;I see. That&#39;s normal, son. I had the same problem,&quot; David said, looking down at his own clothes.<br />
Jeff smiled and walked over to his room. He entered the room,his bed was laying on the floor. The bed frame was cracked and the mattress was ripped.<br />
&quot;What the hell happened here?&quot; David exclaimed, entering the room.<br />
&quot;I... uh... grew,&quot; Jeff replied.<br />
&quot;Yeah, obviously, kid. I can see that. But, why is your bed on the floor?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, well, the bed couldn&#39;t hold me and it broke&quot; Jeff replied.<br />
&quot;That makes sense,&quot; David said.<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I couldn&#39;t find anything that could fit me, so I had to make due with what I could find,&quot; Jeff explained.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, son. You can have one of grandpa&#39;s old t-shirts and a pair of boxers,&quot; David replied. &quot;Mine are too small for you know, but Derek&#39;s should fit you&quot;<br />
Jeff nodded and his father handed him a t-shirt and a pair of boxers. The young giant pulled the t-shirt over his head, and the fabric was barely able to cover his huge chest and broad shoulders. He pulled the boxers over his huge ass and thick legs, and the elastic waistband was stretched to its limits.<br />
&quot;Looks like it fits perfectly, kid,&quot; David said.<br />
Jeff nodded and walked down the hallway to the living room, his father following close behind. Everyone was sitting on the couch and talking.<br />
&quot;Hey, guys,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
The group turned their heads and smiled at the giant, and Jeff continued.<br />
&quot;Dad and I have some great news.&quot;<br />
&quot;What is it, son?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve convinced my father that I&#39;m big enough to live with grandpas on the ground floor,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
Everyone smiled, and David spoke. &quot;And I&#39;ve convinced Jeff that he&#39;s ready to use some of the heavy weights we have.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really, son?&quot; Derek asked.<br />
&quot;Yep. And he should have a bigger bed,&quot; David said.<br />
Everyone laughed, and Derek got up and walked over to Jeff.<br />
&quot;Congratulations, son,&quot; the older giant said, giving the younger giant a big hug. Jeff squeezed his grandfather back, and the two giants were locked in a tight embrace. After a few seconds, Jeff and Derek separated, and the young giant turned to his other grandfather. &quot;I know this T-short. David, is it mine?&quot; Derek said.<br />
&quot;Yeah, and a pair of your boxers, grandpa,&quot; Jeff replied.<br />
&quot;He grew so big, he couldn&#39;t find anything that fit him, so he made due with what he could find,&quot; David<br />
&quot;OK. It fits you good. Do you want me to show you the home gym?&quot; Derek asked.<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, please, grandpa,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s go,&quot; the older giant said, leading the younger giant to the door.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna head down, too,&quot; Elias said.<br />
The four men made their way downstairs, and Derek opened the door to the basement.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a lot of room, and plenty of equipment,&quot; the older giant said.<br />
<br />
As Jeff stepped into the dimly lit basement, his eyes widened in awe. The space was vast and filled with an array of weightlifting equipment that seemed almost too heavy for any human to lift. Derek led him over to a large, sturdy bench press, its weight capacity clearly marked in bold, black letters.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is where the real work begins, son,&quot; Derek said, patting the bench affectionately. &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for someone like you to come along and carry on our family&#39;s legacy of strength and power.&quot;<br />
Jeff nodded eagerly, his heart racing with excitement. He had always admired his grandfathers&#39; impressive physiques and had dreamed of one day surpassing them in size and strength. He felt a sense of pride and determination wash over him as he looked around the room, knowing that this was his chance to prove himself.<br />
<br />
Derek handed Jeff a set of heavy dumbbells, each weighing over 100 pounds. Jeff lifted them effortlessly, his muscles bulging and rippling beneath his skin. He could feel the weight pressing down on him, but it was nothing compared to the weight he had been carrying around inside him for months. He had been growing at an astonishing rate, adding hundreds of pounds to his already massive frame. His clothes no longer fit him, and he had outgrown his bed, forcing him to sleep on the floor until a more suitable arrangement could be made.<br />
<br />
As Jeff lifted the weights higher and higher, sweat pouring down his face and neck, he could feel his muscles stretching and expanding. His pecs were so wide that they almost touched each other in the middle, his lats spreading out behind him like wings. His arms were thicker than most men&#39;s legs, and his hands could easily grasp a football or basketball with ease. His legs were tree trunks that seemed to go on forever, each one thicker than most men&#39;s waists. And all of this was just the beginning.<br />
<br />
Derek watched Jeff with a mixture of pride and concern. He knew that his grandson&#39;s growth was both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it was a testament to Jeff&#39;s dedication and hard work in the gym; on the other hand, it was a potential danger to himself and others around him. Jeff&#39;s size was becoming increasingly difficult to manage in everyday life, from finding clothes that fit to navigating through doorways and hallways without causing damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, my boy,&quot; Derek said gently as Jeff lowered the weights back down to the ground with a loud clang. &quot;I&#39;m proud of you for all the hard work you&#39;ve put in here, but I also want you to be careful. Your size is both a gift and a responsibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded solemnly, understanding the gravity of his situation. He knew that he couldn&#39;t let his size get in the way of living a normal life or hurting those around him. But at the same time, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation for what lay ahead. He wanted to continue growing stronger and bigger than ever before, pushing himself to new limits and breaking new records in weightlifting and bodybuilding competitions.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of frustration as he sat in front of his computer, staring at the Chronivac program once again. He had hit a wall with his family, unable to convince them that his rapid growth was not just a result of his diet. He needed a new plan, a new approach to convince them that he was truly growing at an incredible rate.<br />
<br />
As he scrolled through the program, his eyes landed on an option that caught his attention. &quot;Age Change.&quot; Jeff hesitated for a moment before clicking on the button. He had never considered changing his age before, but he knew that it could be the key to unlocking the next level of growth.<br />
<br />
With a deep breath, Jeff inputted his desired age, 13. He hit the &quot;Confirm&quot; button and closed his eyes, waiting for the program to work its magic.<br />
<br />
When Jeff opened his eyes again, he couldn&#39;t believe what he saw. He was still the same height and size as before, but everything else had changed. His face was smoother and less mature. His hair chest and pubic hair had also disappeared completely, leaving him with a smooth, hairless chest and groin area.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t help but grin as he looked down at himself. He was still the same size and height as before, but now he looked like a teenage boy. He knew that this would be the perfect opportunity to convince his family that he was truly growing at an incredible rate.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s fourteenth birthday was a day that he would never forget. It was the day that he officially outgrew his grandfathers, Derek and Elias, and became the biggest and strongest member of his family. His grandfathers had always been proud of him, but now they were in awe of the way he had grown and developed.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
As Jeff woke up on his birthday morning, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. He knew that today was going to be a day that he would never forget, a day that would change the course of his life forever. He got out of bed and looked in the mirror, admiring the way his muscles bulged and rippled beneath his skin. He could feel the weight pressing down on him, but it was nothing compared to the weight he had been carrying around inside him for months.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s grandfathers came into his room shortly after, bearing gifts and wishes for their beloved grandson. &quot;Happy birthday, Jeff!&quot; Derek exclaimed as he handed Jeff a large box wrapped in colorful paper. &quot;We hope you have a wonderful day filled with growth and strength!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled gratefully as he opened the box, revealing a new set of weights that were even heavier than the ones he had been using before. &quot;Thank you, grandpa,&quot; Jeff said with a grin on his face. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to put these to use!&quot;<br />
<br />
Elias handed Jeff a large cake decorated with colorful candles, each one representing a year of Jeff&#39;s life. &quot;Blow out the candles, Jeff,&quot; Elias said with a smile. &quot;And make a wish for your future growth and strength!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blew out the candles with a loud puff of air, making a silent wish in his heart. He knew that today was going to be a day that would change the course of his life forever, but he couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation for what lay ahead. He wanted to continue growing stronger and bigger than ever before, pushing himself further than ever before, all while being careful not to let his size get in the way of living a normal life or hurting those around him.<br />
<br />
As Jeff sat down for dinner that evening with his family, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of gratitude for everything they had done for him over the years. They had always been supportive and encouraging, even as he grew larger and larger every day. But now they were in awe of the way he had grown and developed, unable to believe that their son and grandson could grow so large so quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff,&quot; Derek said as they sat down to eat. &quot;We are so proud of you for all that you have accomplished over the years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled gratefully as Elias added, &quot;And we can&#39;t wait to see what you will accomplish next!&quot;</p>
