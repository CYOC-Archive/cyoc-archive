<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a weird week for Ethan. And to understand it, we need to come back a little earlier.<br />
<br />
Bill is walking casually toward Jeff&#39;s home, with Steeve, Tony and Paul, their mutual friends. They&#39;re talking and teasing each other, like any group of student would do. It was a beautiful morning, and they&#39;re gonna enjoy it fully. <br />
<br />
But when they got to a few step from the door of Jeff&#39;s house, everything went weird. <br />
Speechless, Bill found himself suddently naked, as all of his clothes vanished in a second. He was relieved noticing that he still got his underwear, but that wasn&#39;t for long. Completely puzzled and obviously moving against his will, Tony kneeled before him, grabbed his boxer and pulled it down to his ankles. Astonished, Bill looked at Steeve and Paul for help, but each of them seemed to be hypnotized, staring at him like if he was a piece of meat. As a strong resolution rose in their gaze, Bill gasped seing their clothes... starting to melt with them ?! Neither one nor the other paying attention to it, the fabric of their clothes was merging with their own skin, but they started to get closer to him, their face only showing a desire that was going stronger and stronger. That was the time Tony&#39;s mouth chose to kiss Bill&#39;s crotch. Surprised, the young man threw his hands toward him, but all he could grab was the cotton front of a jockey short. Looking down, Tony were gone, and some beautiful short was coating him. <br />
<br />
So here was Bill, his hand suspended along his waist, only dressed with a jockey short and trying to understand what could be happening, when Paul felt at his feet. Bill tried to make a step backward, but Steeve had kneeled behind him and was embracing his legs. Unbalanced, Bill toggled backward. He expected to land on Steeve, but he felt on the ground, his back slamming against the grass. Again, his friend vanished before he could see it. Raising up, he suddently felt an odd but very nice pressure around his feet. A look at them confirmed him that he was now wearing new casual shoes. Beautiful and comfy ones which somehow reminded him... Paul. And he wasn&#39;t done with surprises : brand new pants were now covering his legs too. They had the same pattern than Steeve former ones.<br />
<br />
A hand rose before Bill&#39;s face. He grabbed it, and the unknown young man in standing in front of him pulled him up. If Bill was completely puzzled, this stud was obviously amazed. He was fully naked too, but he didn&#39;t seemed to notice it.<br />
<br />
	- Do... Do you... Did you see what happened ?<br />
	- Yes, of course. I was here.<br />
	- How is this possible, what is...<br />
<br />
Bill get interrupted by the noises coming from the street, behind them. He turned back, to see a hudge chaos spreading everywhere. Amazed, he saw people collapsing on the ground, turning into clothing. Groups of people reduce to a single man or woman, just like him. Cars suddently stopped and breaks yelled. <br />
<br />
	- What the hell is...<br />
	- You&#39;re my... Oh, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m speaking to you right now..<br />
<br />
Bill&#39;s attention get back to the young man. He was in awe and so happy that Bill could do nohting but smile, besides every weird events still going gone around them.<br />
<br />
	- Tony pulled me off, and I was so annoyed. And then Paul send me away while he was aiming your feet. I flew and I landed there, and... I joined you !<br />
	- What are saying ? Do we know each other ?<br />
	- Yes ! I&#39;m your boxer ! I mean, I was !<br />
<br />
Bill stared at the man... It was completely crazy, but he felt so familiar to him. He payed attention to the touch of his hand, still holding his. He was so used to this touch, it was disturbing.<br />
<br />
And then, everything went quiet. Each crash or issue caused by the transformations solved themselves in some seconds. The entire world seems to stretch... and came back to its common shape. Bill blinked, and a vertigo took him violently. And then it vanished.<br />
<br />
He looked at his brother, Ethan, just aside him. He was wearing his black pants and tee-shirt, as usual, and was obviously proud to be with him, happy to go ppaying a visit to their friend.<br />
The new reality settled in their two minds, and both of them walk to the door, rang the bell and waited for Jeff and Justin to show up.<br />
<br />
	- How shorty, you ready for the week?<br />
<br />
And all went as usual : Jeff was still reluctant to turn into his jockstrap shape, Justin was unhappy to have to deal with feet in him while he&#39;s been worn, etc, etc. In the house, the group made some adjustments : Murray was finally taken off -jeff didn&#39;t even thank him- and he became the wearer for the next days. They eventually forced Jeff to let go and take a more suitable shape, and Justin and Bill found a agreement about who was gonna wear him for the week. Because there was no way Jeff stayed stubborn. He had to be boken to give in his were being ? Well, that was fitting his jockstrap&#39;s being, afterall. His friends would certainly not let him getting old and miss all the opportunities life was waiting to give him.<br />
<br />
Nothing of that was disturbing for Ethan. He liked his life so much. He was an optimistic, and probably one the most happy people on Earth about this were-situation. He was an underwear too. A so much nicer than Jeff, not meant to support guys during sport but for every day. he never had issues with that and had embraced his being with joy. He was lucky to be rare.<br />
<br />
And then he sat at Jeff&#39;s desk and discovered the Chronivac.<br />
Nobody was paying attention to him, all focused on Jeff&#39;s predicament, so Ethan got all the time he needed to explore the screen and scroll the machine history. His blood froze when he understood the situation. It was really crazy : according to this laptop, the whole world was going wrong and had taken a hudge deviation... Only an hour ago !? He couldn&#39;t believe it, but, somehow, he deeply felt it...  Right.<br />
<br />
	- So here we go, guys ?<br />
<br />
Bill kept Ethan from his reverie.<br />
<br />
	- Yes... Should we go straight to the field ?<br />
	- I think so, we lost enough time with our little friend here, I&#39;ll need to warm up properly.<br />
	- Does it bother you if I stay for  while ? I&#39;d like to check on my mail and my phone is still broken...<br />
<br />
Bill, Muray and Justin hadn&#39;t anything to oppose to him, so they left quickly, amused by Jeff&#39; situation, even if they were sympatizing with him.<br />
<br />
	- Well, whispered Ethan to the laptop, show me what you got. And I&#39;d need some time to think of a way to deal with you.</p>
