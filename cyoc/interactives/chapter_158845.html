<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your name is Connor.  Your a pretty buff guy who’s taking a semester off of college.  You were a football player in high school but weren’t all that popular.  It was most likely due to your very unlikely friendship with a guy that has stuck by you since elementary school.  Jake.  He was sort of your polar opposite.  Skinny, super talkative, and very gay.  <br />
<br />
You were on your way to go see him now to help him with something. <br />
<br />
As you turn into the driveway and get out of the car your greeted by his familiar boyish face, “Took you long enough.” He says smiling.<br />
<br />
“Ah well with your directions it’s a miracle that I made it here at all.” You say laughing; he then joyfully hugs you. <br />
<br />
“Thanks again for doing this.” He says, “yeah, yeah anytime Jake.” You sarcastically remark as you try to playfully escape his embrace.  He loved to mess with you. <br />
<br />
Jake had a little house cleaning business to make a little more cash on the weekends, nothing fancy usually just apartments and single story houses that he would straighten up for the owners. But this time was different, word had gotten around how good he was so he was contacted by a woman who wanted him to clean out an old house she had just bought, you know just make it presentable for any potential buyers, and she would pay triple his usual rate. He couldn’t pass that up, but it was bigger than he was use to so he called you for help, you didn’t mind you weren’t doing anything, he said he’s buy you a full tank of gas and lunch so you were happy.<br />
<br />
The two of you walk up the front porch steps and through the front door, “Okay now I just need you to take everything not bolted to the ground outside, furniture on the lawn and anything else just put it in the back of your truck. The guy said he already got all the valuable looking stuff but he would still like to sort through anything else we find.” Jake says.<br />
<br />
“Can do.” You respond <br />
<br />
“Okay if you need me I’ll be in the back filling boxes.” He says.<br />
<br />
The two of you then go your separate ways, from where you had been standing the house looked pretty empty so you decide to go upstairs and work your way down. Upstairs you found boxes, some empty, some full, and various items covered in dust laying around. So you start packing boxes and moving them down stairs. And then when it looked like you notice a rope hanging from the ceiling in the hallway. “Oh you’ve got to be kidding me, there is an attic too?” you say you then move the last of the boxes on that floor downstairs.<br />
<br />
As you move the last of the boxes to your truck and Jake’s van he was just coming outside, “Well first floor is done, did you get everything from the second floor?” he asks.  <br />
<br />
Yeah now it just needs to be swept, hey have you been up to the attic yet?” you ask hoping he had already taken care of it. He looks at you confused, <br />
<br />
“Attic? That’s funny the owner never mentioned anything about an attic.” He says.<br />
<br />
“Dang, well one more floor then.” You say walking back to the house.<br />
<br />
“Okay I’ll help you with that and then sweep everything down.” He says<br />
<br />
The two of you then make your way to the attic, at first you gently tug on the rope, but it wouldn’t budge so you tell Jake to stand back and you pull harder. Suddenly it shoots open in a cloud of dust. “Well I guess no one has been up here in a while.” You say, he two of you then walk carefully up the stairs into an open room with a desk, a chair, candles, and dozens of books. There didn’t seem to be any lights but you could see thanks to a single window. <br />
<br />
“Well I guess it could be worse. I’ll go get some boxes, open the window and see if you can get us some more light.” Jake says <br />
<br />
He then walks down the stairs as you step up into the room and make your way to the window. As you open the window the room is filled with an almost blinding light. Once your eyes adjust you make your way to the table where you find an open book. <br />
<br />
You then look down at the open book preparing to decipher the strange words when suddenly Jake walks up the stairs, “Hey what you got there?” He asks. <br />
<br />
“Nothing just books.” You reply closing the book and placing it on the bookshelf. <br />
<br />
“Okay I’ll box up the light stuff, you find out how to get the desk and chair downstairs.” He says, <br />
<br />
“Ah.. fun stuff.” You remark.<br />
<br />
After much time and frustration you manage to get them down them to the front lawn. You then sit down on the tailgate of your truck to catch your breath. Just then, Jake walks up carrying a box with a book on top of it. “Well that’s the last of it,” he says placing the box beside you. <br />
<br />
“Wait, I think you forgot one.” You say pointing to the book. <br />
<br />
“No, it just didn’t fit in the box.” He said picking it up and throwing it in your truck. “Okay the moving truck will be by any minute now for the furniture then all we have to do is drop this stuff off and get paid.” He says smiling, <br />
<br />
“Sweet, cause I’m starving. And you’re buying so I was thinking Olive Garden, maybe that Japanese place I like” You say smiling.<br />
<br />
“Hey! I said I’d buy you dinner I didn’t say you could pick.” He laughs.<br />
<br />
“Oh come on.” <br />
<br />
“Yep McDonalds dollar menu it is.” <br />
<br />
“Hey!” <br />
<br />
“Okay okay I guess you did earn a little more than dollar cheeseburger and small drink.” He laughs back. <br />
<br />
“Thank you.” You reply.<br />
<br />
Just then the moving truck pulls up and lets down its window, “There you go guys.” He says, “Alright lets head out.” He tells you.<br />
<br />
You then get in your vehicles and you follow him.  About twenty minutes later you arrive at a house even bigger than the old one, as you pull up Jake is talking to a woman while two other men unload his van, you then get out and begin unloading your truck, once the van was emptied the two men joined you and in no time both vehicles were unloaded. <br />
<br />
The woman hands Jake an envelope, thanks both of you, and walks inside. The two of you then get in your vehicles and drive away. He then buys you a full tank of gas and takeout from a reasonably priced restaurant and the two of you head back to his place to eat. When you get there you carry the food inside.</p>
