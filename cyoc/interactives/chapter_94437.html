NEXT CHAPTER – 5 MONTHS AND 29 DAYS LATER<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Well, It’s almost time for me to give “birth” now. Tomorrow is the day, and then thanks to my healing abilities, I will be impregnated about an hour later. I gently rub my belly, able to just barely feel the bumps of the hundreds of eggs inside me. Over the last month, the robots have been coaching me on the technique of the birthing. Apparently, the eggs coming out will not cause much pain, nor much effort, but it is tiring to get seven hundred and ninety three out. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The robots also told me that I will feel a definite twinge, and a contraction when it is time. Well, in terms of my life, it’s been going good. I have gotten used to the massive belly jutting from me, and it’s made life interesting. I love both the feeling of carrying something alien to our race, and just the challenges it presents of even the simplest of things. I cannot wait to get re-impregnated. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
NEXT DAY<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I woke up this morning, both feeling a sense of dread and excitement. On one hand, I was giving birth, but I was also getting pregnant again. I stood up, and waddled out the door, heading to the kitchen. Grabbing some food, in particular, a hamburger, I sat down and ate with gusto. While doing this, I rubbed my belly with my free hand. Soon, I returned to my room, having been told by the robots that I would have to stay in my room as the contraction could come at any time. And what a good decision it was. At that moment, just as I set foot back in my room, an intense rush of pain raced through my body. The contraction! It was here! Already? The robots came running, and I waddled slowly over to the birthing chair. I sat down. Now, the robots had told me the best way to deliver the eggs was to follow the chair’s position. I raised me legs up, past my belly in into leg slots near where the armrests were. My pussy was now in full view, and my belly was ready, a massive dome of taut skin which grew from my skin. I was ready. Over the last month, my hips had become “birthing hips”, larger and more voluptuous, making it easier to push things out. A collection tub was place right beneath my pussy. Soon, I felt something coming down my birth canal. I gave a short push, and it popped out. It was a little sphere, about the size of a large marble, or the size of a bouncy ball. It was still coated in the sticky fluids of my womb, and I grinned in success. Another came down and came out. Soon, egg after egg was coming out in quick succession. I barely had to give any effort. I pushed and pushed. Strangely, I found this quite arousing. After a few moments, I had an orgasm, my pussy spraying liquids everywhere along with a couple of eggs. Then, an egg got stuck. The robots informed me that I would have to push, and I did. I pushed and pushed, and the larger than normal egg’s crown was soon visible through my pussy lips. Then it popped out, and into the tub <br />
<br />
After a couple of hours, the robots informed me that five hundred of the eggs had been birthed.  I continued to birth them, each of them coated in the sticky fluids from my womb.  Sweat coated my entire body, as I continued to gently nudge them out. Tub after tub was taken and replaced from between my legs and I cried out.  <br />
<br />
It had been 4 hours, and I was finally finished. The robots informed me that each of the eggs was perfectly fine and healthy. They also notified me that when I became re-impregnated, I would be carrying more eggs than this time. I thanked them and removed myself from the birthing position, standing up. For a moment, I had to readjust myself, missing the massive weight of my belly. I went to clean myself up, and remove all the grime of the birth from my body. <br />
<br />
1 hour passed very quickly, and I eagerly waited it. I was now unused to not carrying an immense weight in front of me, and I missed it. I passed the time by taking  long shower, washing off the sweat of the birthing and washing away all the stress of it too. On the good side, I was able and willing to be able to have access to the area where I had been unable to during my &quot;pregnancy&quot;, and would soon be unable to do again.  Soon, I was heading back to the central area, back to where I would get impregnated once again. When I reached there, the robots shut the doors, and I eagerly awaited the arrive of my friend. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I didn’t have to wait long. Soon, I heard the footsteps of the massive creature, with his tentacles and monster cock. He stepped out of the tunnel, and approached me, and he grabbed me, like before, with his tentacles, restraining my arms and legs, and spreading them. This time, he used his tentacles and they latched onto my nipples, which were still full of the green liquid. I moaned as it began to suck on them, pulling the green fluid from my massive breasts. <br />
<br />
I began to get very aroused by this process, and I came within the minute, cum spraying out from my slippery nether regions. The monster sensed my arousal and lowered me towards the huge blue monster cock. I shivered with excitement. Then it lowered me onto it, and the cock thrust into me.<br />
<br />
I cried out and began to shiver with pleasure, and it pushed deeper and deeper into me, not playing with me as it had the first time. It pierces the entrance to my womb and entered, not wasting any time. Then I felt the familiar feeling of the eggs starting to be placed within me. The monster’s cock bulged right where it entered my nether regions, and I felt the lumps, which were the eggs travel down my birth canal and into my womb, where the head of the cock deposited them. It pushed egg after egg into me. At first, there weren&#39;t enough to make me feel other than full, but soon enough, my belly once again gained that 1 month pudge at first, before swelling into something bigger, It grew past 3 months pregnant, then 5 months, and seven months, soon reaching a regular 9 months pregnant belly. My belly button popped with a loudish SNAP! The monster cock continued to deposit the eggs within me, and I cried out in pleasure as I came around it, the juices soaking the large cock in me. I continued to grow, my belly soon reaching 9 months pregnant with twins, then triplets. One of the tentacles restraining my hands loosened, and a wrenched my hand free, resting my hand on my swelling belly. I could feel it growing, as egg after egg was coming into me. I soon attained the size of a 9 months pregnant woman with quintuplets. It wasn’t long before I attained the size I had been before.  <br />
<br />
But I kept growing, soon at least 2 times as larger as I was before. The cock pulled out of me, and the monster, as before, crawled away, back down the tunnel it had come. The doors to the rest of the complex opened, and I took a moment to admire my new swollen belly. The skin was pale and stretched taut, over the eggs which I now contained within my body.  A robot hurried over to me and scanned me, assuring me that my vital signs were okay. It also notified me that I now had one thousand,  seven hundred and sixty four eggs in me. I nodded, and then began to waddle back to my room, eager for the privacy of it.<br />
<br />
I loved being “pregnant” again, and I loved the challenges it made of everyday common tasks. I continued to waddle back to my room, welcoming back my massive egg filled belly as I did so. Gently rubbing the taut swollen skin, I could feel the hundreds of eggs inside of me, and I loved it. <br />
<br />
Soon, I reached my room, and now there were some upgrades. The computer desk now had a round niche in it, so that my protruding belly would not be uncomfortable when and if I worked. There were a few handles installed in places where I may lie down and then have trouble standing once more. Feeling the need to go to piss, I waddled over to the bathroom. I noticed that the door was wider, to allow me to go through. My womb, fuller than before, pushed against my bladder, reminding me all to much of my need. Plopping myself down on the toilet. I relieved myself. Then i grabbed one of the handholds and pulled myself up. <br />
<br />
Deciding to take a shower, I switched on the water and hopped in, the water spraying all over my belly and body. I grinned again, knowing that I was now unable to reach my legs once again. I rubbed my belly happily.<br />
<br />
Now, as I hopped out the shower, anew challenge presented itself to me. How would I dry myself. Luckily, I soon found a machine, which blow dried your whole body. I stood there, letting the warm air flow over me as I hugged my belly, welcoming it back. <br />
<br />
Once I finished my drying session, I waddled out of the bathroom. Waddling over to an over sized armchair, I sat down. I soon realised that my belly was now so large that It had to sit between my legs and rest in the chair. As a result, my legs were spread quite wide when I sat. This was quite interesting, and I rubbed my belly, the eggs bumpy surface just faintly able to be felt as I ran my hand over the taut skin. Pulling myself up once more, I walked over to the shelf and grabbed the stretch mark cream, rubbing it over my huge belly, and giggling slightly as I did so. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Repeating the makeshift measuring process I had done before, I found I was now as large as a woman with nonuplets, or nine children. I was amazed, but also fearful. If I got too big, would I explode, or grow immobile. Using the ring, which I hadn&#39;t down for six months, I wished that I would never be able to hold more than 3,000 eggs at a time, equalling a belly containing 15 children, decaquintuplets. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the right term. <br />
<br />
Then I decide I would go and visit my previous brood. Waddling over the door, I went through and back to the central hub, where thirty minutes ago I had been re impregnated once again. Heading down the pathway the nursery, I was amazed at the size of the place. A cry caught my ear, and I turned my head to see a creature looking at me from one of the cubbyholes on the wall. It tilted its head to the side, and I realised that it looked exactly like it&#39;s dad. It had an undeveloped blue cock and the tentacles only looked like hair. This was once of the many eggs which I had carried for 6 months prior. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It hopped out of its cubby and crawled over to me, barely bigger than my foot. It began to coo, and rub against my foot, obviously recognising me as it’s mother. I squat down, my belly large and full between my legs, and pet it, it squeaking in return. Laying down, the little baby creature crawls onto my belly and squeaks, as if saying hello to its unbirthed brothers and sisters. The it crawled over and began to suck on my breast. I gently stroke it, feeling my pussy get wet, as it continues to suck the green fluid out of me. After a while. However, it unlatches and runs away, looking a little drowsy.  I, with a little trouble, pull myself back up, returning to my standing position. Rubbing my belly, I continue down into the nursery. Squeaking noises come from the wall niches, and I smile and wave hello as I waddle past.  <br />
<br />
After about an hour of visiting my “children”, I return to my room. Rubbing my massive belly, I lie down, albeit a little difficulty ensuing. Rubbing my belly, I drift off to sleep.</p>
