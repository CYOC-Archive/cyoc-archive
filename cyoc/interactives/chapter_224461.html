<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat is a beautiful girl, she has long smooth blond hair, which reaches the middle of her back, she has green eyes and an athletic built due to her sport activities and cheerleading. The girl is also a witch, just like her mother, when a witch turns 18 is when she receives her powers.<br />
<br />
When Kat learned about this, she couldn’t wait to turn 18, you see… Kat has a brother Dan who is 16 years old, and she hates him! The reason for her hate is that from the moment he was born, all the attention she had gotten from her parents, especially from her mother, shifted to the little brat. Kat became more and more jealous, which caused her mind to break, the girl ended up going insane, but somehow she managed to hide this from their parents.<br />
<br />
Kat vowed revenge on her brother, learning about being a witch and getting her powers when she turns 18, made her decide to wait until she had her powers, with the power she will receive, she knew she could do anything and get away with it.<br />
<br />
So, when the day arrives, Kat wakes up early, “today is the day,” she says to herself, getting out of bed, “let’s see if I already have my powers.”<br />
<br />
The girl turns to her wardrobe and raises a hand, the palm facing the door of the wardrobe, when she swipes her hand, the door opens by itself. Kat grins, “let’s see if I can magically change my clothes,” she says. The girl is wearing a nightgown, but when she concentrates and wills herself to be dressed in a jeans, white t-shirt and white socks, her nightgown becomes those clothing pieces.<br />
<br />
Kat grins evilly and rubs her hands, “perfect,” she says, “now I can finally get my revenge!”<br />
<br />
The girl walks towards her brother’s room, she quietly opens the door and when she peeps into the room, she sees Dan sitting in front of his Laptop, playing a game.<br />
<br />
Grinning to herself, Kat mumbles something and her grin widens when she sees her brother’s body glow, the boy seeming to not notice. When Kat stops chanting, the glowing stops, the girl quietly closes the door and heads back to her room, “I’ll give it an hour to settle,” she says to herself, lying down on her bed, “I just hope it’ll work the way I want it to.”<br />
<br />
Back in Dan’s room, the teen is still playing his game, ‘you know, Dan,’ he suddenly hears a voice in his head, ‘your sister, Kat, she is such a sweet girl. You always pull mean pranks on her, humiliating her whenever you get the chance. You even stole all the attention of her parents from her. You should make it up to her!’<br />
<br />
‘Pff,’ Dan thinks, ‘my sister is a stupid bitch! She deserves to be humiliated!’<br />
<br />
‘Oh, come on, Dan,’ the voice replies, ‘you know that that is not true! You actually love your sister, you’d do anything for her, no matter what, right?’<br />
<br />
‘Um… nooooope,’ Dan thinks, ‘and why am I arguing with myself?’<br />
<br />
The voice chuckles, ‘because you don’t like to hear the truth,’ the voice says, ‘you don’t want to admit that you love your sister and that you’d do anything for her. That is the reason you prank her, to hide your true feelings towards her!’<br />
<br />
‘Ha,’ Dan thinks, ‘I don’t love her! She is so annoying! And a creep!’<br />
<br />
‘You know,’ the voice says, ‘I think the reason you are acting and being so mean towards her, is that you are scared, because you know the true reason why you were born!’<br />
<br />
‘Oh, really,’ Dan asks sarcastically, ‘and what do you know… you are just a stupid voice in my head!’<br />
<br />
The voice chuckles, ‘because I know you better than you know yourself,’ it replies, ‘I’m you subconscious. I know for a fact, that you were born for one purpose: to be her property! Kat owns you, think about it! Deep down you KNOW that you belong to her, that you would do anything to please her.’<br />
<br />
‘I…,’ Dan is starting to feel confused, ‘but if that were true… why am I acting the way I am?’<br />
<br />
‘That is because you are afraid that someone might find out,’ the voice says, ‘you don’t want anyone to know that you are in reality just an object, a toy, that belongs to Kat.’<br />
<br />
‘I… don’t understand,’ Dan says.<br />
<br />
The voice sighs, ‘it’s so easy, Dan,’ it says, ‘from the moment you were born, you belonged to Kat, but since only you and her knew this, you both agreed to keep it a secret, even from your parents.’<br />
<br />
‘I… I don’t remember agreeing to anything,’ Dan thinks.<br />
<br />
The voice chuckles, ‘you just forgot,’ it says, ‘luckily for you: I remember exactly what you agreed to.’<br />
<br />
‘Why should I listen to you,’ Dan asks, ‘you are just some voice. Why should I trust you?’<br />
<br />
‘Because I am you,’ the voice chuckles, ‘you trust yourself right?’<br />
<br />
‘Yea,’ Dan says.<br />
<br />
‘And since I am you,’ the voice replies, ‘you should trust me and believe me. I have no reason to lie to… myself, right?’<br />
<br />
‘No… why would I lie to myself,’ Dan asks, ‘that makes no sense!’<br />
<br />
‘See,’ the voice says, ‘now, do you want to know what you and your sister agreed to?’<br />
<br />
‘Yes,’ Dan replies.<br />
<br />
‘Then let me show you one of your memories,’ the voice says.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Dan’s vision goes black, but before he is able to panic, a scene suddenly appears:<br />
<br />
Dan sees himself and his sister, sitting in his sister’s room, Kat looks no older than eight and Dan himself seems to be six.<br />
<br />
“Mistress,” Dan then suddenly hears his younger self say, “why did you want to see me? Do you want me to transform into a dolly again?”<br />
<br />
The younger version of Kat giggles, “no,” she says, “I wanted to discuss something with you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” little Dan asks.<br />
<br />
“You know that only you and me know that you are my toy, my property,” Kat says, “our parents and friends don’t.”<br />
<br />
“Right,” Dan replies.<br />
<br />
“I figured, it’ll be best for both of us if they’ll never know about it,” Kat says.<br />
<br />
“Okay, but how should we do that, mistress,” Dan asks.<br />
<br />
Kat giggles, “you shouldn’t call me “mistress”, only if we are by ourselves, if our parents or anyone is near, you better call me Kat.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, mistress,” little Dan says.<br />
<br />
“I want you to act like any “normal” brother,” Kat continues, “be mean to me, pull pranks on me, just act like any normal brother would.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, mistress, if that’s what you want,” Dan says.<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “you are a good toy,” she says, hugging Dan.<br />
<br />
“I only do what you say is right, mistress,” little Dan replies.<br />
<br />
The scene disappears and Dan’s vision returns to normal, ‘wh-what… h-how could I forget that?’<br />
<br />
‘Well, you were young,’ the voice replies, ‘it’s just normal that over the years, that you have forgotten about this.’<br />
<br />
‘I… I don’t know what to say,’ Dan says, ‘I feel so confused!’<br />
<br />
‘I suggest you should go and check on your mistress,’ the voice says, ‘besides, it’s her birthday! You as her toy should make her a gift!’<br />
<br />
‘Like what,’ Dan asks.<br />
<br />
‘Become something she desires the most,’ the voice replies.<br />
<br />
‘But… how should I know what she desires,’ Dan asks.<br />
<br />
‘Try to sense her energy,’ the voice replies, ‘that should tell you what she desires.’<br />
<br />
Dan concentrates, he then feels a strange energy, ‘I… I can sense that she is hungry,’ he thinks, ‘but she also desires a sexy outfit for her party tonight. Which should I become?’<br />
<br />
‘Why not become both,’ the voice suggests, ‘you could transform into something edible, then when you respawn, you can transform into something sexy for her to wear.’<br />
<br />
‘But… I can also sense that she’d like to cook a meal for her guests,’ Dan replies.<br />
<br />
‘That shouldn’t be a problem,’ the voice says, ‘just ask her what she wants the most, either you become something sexy for her to wear, or you become the party dinner! Why don’t you go to her and simply ask what she wants!’<br />
<br />
‘Good idea,’ Dan thinks to himself, he ends his game and hurries out of his room, when he reaches the door to Kat’s room he knocks, “Mistress, may I come in?”</p>
