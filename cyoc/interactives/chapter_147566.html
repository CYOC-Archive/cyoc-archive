<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karen, after dropping off her clothes at the cabin, started to run through the forest.  Ever since her first transformation, she was experiencing the world through new eyes, so to speak.  She could feel the wind through her fur, the moonlight through her eyes, the sounds of the forest coming in louder through her new ears, and all sorts of smells through her new nose.  It took some getting used to, but by now, she was able to run on her new paws, and she found that she could move faster than in her normal human form.  She reached the top of a hill and looked at the nearby lake that was reflecting the moon.  She stopped to watch the new sight before her as Rich and Olivia were running behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen, wait,&quot; Olivia called out as she caught up to Karen.  &quot;I know you&#39;re new to this whole weretiger thing, but don&#39;t leave us behind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Karen called back, &quot;It&#39;s just...this view is amazing.  Everything&#39;s been amazing so far.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I get that,&quot; Rich said as he caught up to both Olivia and Karen.  &quot;I mean, I remember when I changed the first time.  Everything was just so new to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Karen started to ask, &quot;I sorta wanna know.  How long have you been a weretiger?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Rich started to reply, &quot;I&#39;m what you&#39;d call a natural born were.  My parents were weretigers, and I was born a weretiger.  Although, I didn&#39;t change until I was about 14.&quot;  Rich smiled as he sat down to look at the lake as he continued my thoughts.  &quot;I remember the thrill of my first change running through the woods.  It wasn&#39;t long before I had my first hunt, my first love, my first everything.  I guess I&#39;ve been a weretiger for so long that I&#39;ve forgotten how...exhilirating it can be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you, Olivia?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, unlike Rich, I moved here with my family when I was about 10.  My parents ended up joining were-society.  They decided to become raccoons for some reason.&quot;  Olivia sighed as she shook her head, &quot;To this day, I&#39;m not sure why.  Anyway, I enrolled in school here at Moon Lake.  The first couple of years were pretty normal, but as soon as I entered middle school, things started changing.  The first thing they did is bring us to some meeting where they started to explain the &quot;facts of life&quot; to us.  Not just about sex and reproduction, but also about were life and the warnings about the were-virus and whatnot.&quot;  Olivia paused as she held her head in her paws before she continued.  &quot;It was rather embarrassing for me at the time.  But it wasn&#39;t until our last year in middle school that things really started to change.  As kids started to turn 14, they go through their first change.  It wasn&#39;t hard to see who was a normal and who was a were.  The weres were easy to figure out.  One day, they look like scrawny kids who are just about to hit puberty, and the next they look like either football stars or cheerleaders.  Us normal kids had to go through the process naturally, and most of us wouldn&#39;t ever get to that point without joining were-society.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen took in what Olivia was saying before she asked a question, &quot;What made you decide to become a weretiger?&quot;<br />
<br />
Olivia stopped to think for a moment before responding.  &quot;When I entered high school, one of the things that I picked up is that weres aren&#39;t exactly shy about showing off their fursonas.  It was real easy for me to find a were-something, ask him or her to show her fursona, and learn from that.&quot;  Karen nodded as she remembered her own research.  &quot;It was a hard choice for me.  I&#39;ll admit that I was a bit torn between a werefox, werewolf, and a weretiger.  Ultimately, I really liked the fur of the weretiger, so I got myself some weretiger birth control pills.  When the next Halloween dance came by, I found a weretiger, and asked him to change me.  The rest, they say, is history.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Karen said as she took in what Olivia said.  &quot;So, how did you guys meet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We met a few months ago,&quot; Rich said.  &quot;It was at a weretiger meeting, and...well...it&#39;s hard to say, but I think it&#39;s safe to say that we had a mutual attraction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Karen said as she thought about what she learned.  There was so much to learn, but for now, she wanted to enjoy weretiger life.  She got off the ground and looked towards the lake before running towards it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen!  Wait!&quot; Olivia called out.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I swear,&quot; Rich said, &quot;We need a leash on that girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but at least she&#39;s enjoying herself,&quot; Olivia replied before running after Karen.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before Karen reached the lake.  The lake was calm and with the moon, almost looked mirror-like.  Karen approached the shore and knelt down to peer into the water.  Looking down, she saw her reflection in the water.  Her face was mostly orange with black stripes all over her face and a bit of white above her eyes.  Her nose and jaw were pushed forward to form a rounded muzzle, and Karen opened her mouth to see a row of pointed sharp teeth.  Her ears were rounded, and they moved seemingly on their own accord.  One of the unusual things about this whole thing was that even though she was in her tiger form, her hair was still largely human.  It was still brown and hung rather loosely on the top of her head.  It was a bit more wild, but still in the same style that she combed it that morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Karen said to herself as Olivia and Rich approached.  &quot;This is the new me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Olivia said, &quot;and you&#39;re as beautiful as you ever were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen smiled at Olivia and then asked, &quot;So, what&#39;s next?&quot;</p>
