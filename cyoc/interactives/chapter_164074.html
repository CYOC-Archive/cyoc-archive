<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> What is going on I yelled…well tried to.  I heard my voice but I wasn’t  in my head.  It was muffled, and my mouth didn’t seem to work right.  I  tried again, same result. The sound was coming from behind me.  I  couldn’t hear myself in my ears, the reverberations in my sinus, the  vibration in in my throat was simply not there but I noticed this time  that I felt something in my butt crack.  I tried again, what is going  on??? My mouth felt fat, like my face had exploded.  In though the  mouth, out through the nose I reminded myself.  <br />
<br />
My husband was by my side now.  He looked at me, he looked sad.  We made  eye contact, he looked away.  What? I asked, what happened? <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
The man in the suit said we need to talk.  I started to sit down and he stopped me.  I think it’s better if we stand, he said.  <br />
<br />
I don’t know of any other way to say this but you have been assaulted and the suspects got away.  <br />
<br />
Assaulted?  I asked, being more forceful, a task that caused unnerving  feelings starting from my lower abdomen extending down and centering  just below my sex.  <br />
<br />
He held up a mirror and I looked at my reflection.  I looked the same,  save for the red bandana covering my mouth.  I reached up and jerked it  down and stared.  Dumbfounded, I looked at my reflection. My eyes were  the same, as was my nose and cheeks.  What I was failing to comprehend  was centered between my nose and my chin was an anus.  My anus.  It was  pink and puckered and healthy and on my face.  Holy crap, on my face, my  anus is on my face! It moved, it relaxed and puckered as I clenched and  unclenched.    I suddenly beginning to realize why my voice was so  wrong and, oh my god, my mouth, my mouth is in my butt crack.  I got  woosey and sat down on the couch.  <br />
<br />
In through the mouth….I tried to repeat but sitting on the couch I felt  the rough fabric of the blanket wrapped around me press against my lips  so I jumped right back up again, biting my tongue again in the process.  <br />
<br />
Miss, we need to have you see one of our specialists.  We need to know  to what lengths the transformation has gone so please come with me.  <br />
<br />
You will have to stay here, he said to my husband and we walked off.  <br />
<br />
Putting another blanket over my head, we walked outside.  In walking I  could feel my butt cheeks rub agaist my lips….left…right…left….right.   Oh god I’m going insane I thought.  Walking also made breathing  difficult because as my thighs rubbed together, my lips would be forced  closed so I tried as much as possible to breathe through my nose.  <br />
<br />
We were outside, I could tell because we left the air conditioned  sanctuary of the concert hall but we stopped outside and heard him knock  on a door.     <br />
<br />
Here she is he said, take care of her.  She’s one valuable witness.  <br />
<br />
I was led up some stairs, the floor felt unstable so I believe I was in  an RV and it was confirmed when a voice said I could remove my head  cover now.  <br />
<br />
It’s ok, I’m a doctor, the male voice said.  <br />
<br />
I slowly pulled the towel from my head and looked down at my feet.    <br />
<br />
Here he said, handing me a surgical mask.  You can wear this, and then no one will ever know.  <br />
<br />
I placed the mask over my nose and pulled the elastic over my head and  looked up.  The doctor was young but not too young.  I was going to be  dammed if Doodie Houser was going to give me an examination in my  humiliated state.  <br />
<br />
Come, sit here on the examination table.  He said pointing to a standard examination table.    <br />
<br />
I sat down on the table and he said he needs to do a pelvic exam and  motioned to the two stirrups on either side of the table.  Great, all  this and a gyno exam I thought.  <br />
<br />
It was actually nice to be in the stirrups because for the first time  since the show, my mouth wasn’t feeling it was as being smooshed between  my butt cheeks.  I was not going to spend the rest of my life in  stirrups however.  <br />
<br />
The doctor started by asking me some questions.  I told him how old I  was and that we were at the show and I don’t recall much else except I  ended up like this and pointed to my face.  <br />
<br />
I think he was surprised at how well I could speak.  I felt him touch  the area around my lips and he said it looks as if most of the facial  muscles that control the mouth were transferred down there as well.    <br />
<br />
Say Ah he said.  I opened my mouth and I felt him prod around in there  with a tongue depressor.  All your teeth are ok, your tongue seems  healthy and over oral… health appears excellent.  <br />
<br />
He did a pelvic exam and proclaimed that my gynecological health was  also normal but without xray’s he couldn’t be totally sure about any  other issues other than my physical alterations.  <br />
<br />
Do you want to see? He asked and grabbed a mirror.  I shrugged and  nodded and he placed a mirror down between my legs and I said up  slightly.  It had been years since had even looked at my vagina in a  mirror, but it looked normal.  It’s outer lips ringed with dark blonde  pubic hair and down further past the peritoneum the corner of my mouth  began with it’s lipstick covered lips.  It was sideways, meaning my  mouth ran vertical with my butt crack which explains the smooshed  feeling I was having.  I opened my mouth, and sure enough if it had been  on my face it would look normal but looking at it now it was strange  and wrong.  I stuck my tongue out and licked my lips.  Wow is all I  could say and as I watched my lips mouth the word wow, I felt like  laughing and crying.  What am I going to do?  How am I going to eat?  Is  this my existence for the rest of my life?  I stuck my tongue out  further, it felt normal.  I ran it around my mouth and felt the stubble  of my inner thigh and tiny hairs that were in my butt crack.  I’m going  to need a wax job I thought as it all became too much to handle.  <br />
<br />
I need to examine your face the doctor said, interrupting my moment.   I  reluctantly let him pull the mask from my face.  I tried to look away,  ashamed at what I must look like.  I closed my eyes as he touched the  area surrounding my anus.  I felt his gloved hand probing my cheeks and  chin.  <br />
<br />
Just relax he said right before he slipped a lubricated finger into my  anus.  The sensations were bizarre.  I could feel his finger in the butt  hole, probing but I could also feel the rest of his hand on my chin and  nose.  Other sensations were hitting me as well.  When he inserted his  finger I could hear the slurping sound as his lubricated finger slid  into my anus.  I could smell the latex of his glove mixing with the  subtle odor of  KY jelly.  I wanted to vomit.  I felt and heard his  finger slide out of my anus.  I instinctively clenched my butthole,  marveling at the new sensations I had in my face as my cheeks were  sucked in, almost like I was puckering up to kiss someone.  <br />
<br />
Here you go, as he handed me a handy wipe to remove the excess  lubricant.  For the moment I had been breathing through my mouth but I  slipped and took a whiff, which was a big mistake.  <br />
<br />
The mixed odor of latex, KY and feces wafted into my nose and my stomach rebelled.    <br />
<br />
The Doctor, sensing I was going to vomit placed a garbage can between my legs, just in time.  <br />
<br />
I wretched and the first wave hit, and I tasted lunch as it passed out my  mouth and into the can.  I took a breath and heaved again, this time  straining.  The second wave emerged but this time my mouth was slightly closed so some of it sprayed against my inner thigh.  <br />
<br />
I strained again, a dry heave, which produced something I was not nor  could not be ready for.  Out of my anus came an explosion of gas and  particulate made up of poop and residual KY jelly.  Oh God, I saw it, I  heard it, I felt it, I saw it and I smelt it. I farted and it was right  under my nose.  <br />
<br />
I heaved again.  Oh God I screamed aloud why me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
