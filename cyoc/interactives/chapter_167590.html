<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After what felt like hours, Jeff finally returned to the room with a cardboard box under one arm and a camera in his hands. &quot;Sorry bro, I thought I knew where all this stuff was!&quot; Adam watched as Jeff put the box down out of his line of sight, then checked the camera for battery and storage space. He reached down to Adam with a wicked grin. &quot;I&#39;m just gonna get a few photos for posterity...&quot; He posed Adam, then aimed his camera at the clothes-less doll. He snapped a few photos, adjusting Adam into differing positions before finally setting the camera down and opening the box.<br />
<br />
Adam couldn&#39;t see what he was doing until Jeff turned around and slammed another action figure on the table. Adam would have cried nostalgically if he could. It was his old Action Adam toy! He couldn&#39;t believe his parents had kept all of this junk from when he was a kid. He had all the play sets and would spend hours with them. Action Adam had a big impact on his life. The toys, the TV show, even the awful live-action movie. He shared a kindred spirit with the toy due to their shared name. If it wasn&#39;t for Action Adam, he would never have joined the army.<br />
<br />
Now here they both were, his Action Adam toy and himself, both the same size. He studied the old toy up close, seeing the scuffs and scrapes from their dual adventures. But then Adam had a horrible thought. Why did Jeff bring his old toys out from the attic? What was this great idea of his. Action Adam looked pretty similar to himself with the buff physique and stubble-stained cheeks. Would anyone notice if they swapped places. Was Jeff going to replace him...?<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t help his suspicions as Jeff turned back to the box and dug out a pair of spare doll clothes. He grabbed Adam and fumbled with his plastic form, struggling to get the tiny clothes onto his tiny body. Soon enough, he was dressed like an army man. He was almost indistinguishable from his action figure counterpart. Jeff grinned and took a picture of the two of them. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Adam,&quot; he said as he returned to the box to pick out a toy jeep. &quot;I only want to get some pictures. And hey, you get to play with Action Adam again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam was a little flattered but also humiliated. He didn&#39;t appreciate that Jeff was treating him like the toy he&#39;d become. Plus, he had to admit it was a little exciting to have adventures with Action Adam again, only this time he was sat side by side with the plastic man. Jeff would dig out another set piece from the box, set Adam into position, then take a few pictures. It was unusual at first to be stretched and pulled into several poses but after the third or fourth set-up, Adam had gotten used to it. Some poses worked, like saluting a printed flag or gripping the side of a ruined building. Other poses not so much. More often than not, he&#39;d fall sideways or flat on his face. It didn&#39;t help that Jeff wasn&#39;t the most delicate handler. Sometimes he would get too rough and yank a limb too far. The fifth time he held a loose arm in-between his fingers, Jeff sighed and popped it back into place. &quot;No wonder these are for kids. I&#39;m far too big to be doing this correctly...&quot;<br />
<br />
Other than the occasional temporary loss of limb, things were going alright. Adam was beginning to enjoy himself. It was meditative in a way. But he couldn&#39;t help but feel relieved when Jeff declared &quot;OK OK, just one more pose and we&#39;re done.&quot;. He was desperate for this waking nightmare to end. Jeff put Adam down on the desk and turned to the side. If Adam could move or make any sound, he would have cried out in shock as Jeff pulled down his shorts and underwear in one quick motion. His cock flopped about, half erect and thick as a beer can. Adam was mesmerised by the swinging pendulum, it looked even bigger than him! Then Adam gulped, he wouldn&#39;t dare...<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned as he picked up his little action figure of a brother. &quot;Sorry bro, but let&#39;s consider this a little incentive to not tell anyone about the Chronivac...&quot; He pumped his cock with his free hand until he was rock hard, then brought Adam down to rest on top. He grinned, his cock was even bigger than his toy brother! He adjusted Adam&#39;s arms and legs to wrap around his thick girth, then turned his head to the side so it rested on his flushed cock head like a pillow. &quot;You comfortable there bro? I bet you&#39;ve never been this close to another man&#39;s cock before!&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam grumbled silently in his head. He was at the mercy of his brother and was clamouring on his dick like a monkey. It was also a horrid reminder that he still seemed to have all his human senses. Now that he was down at crotch level, he could smell the overwhelming musk coming from his brother&#39;s sweat. It seemed to cling to him. He thanked the lucky stars that his mouth was sealed tight as it was pressed straight into Jeff&#39;s squishy cock head. <br />
<br />
There were a few clicks as Jeff tried to find the best angle for his blackmail picture. Then he swivelled Adam around his cock so he was hanging from it instead of resting. Jeff sat down and propped Adam up to make it look like the small toy was giving his cock a big hug, or even trying to pleasure him. Jeff grinned impishly, he knew it was twisted to torment his brother in such a way. But he needed something to ensure Adam would keep his word. Hopefully he won&#39;t take it too badly... He took one last photo and tugged Adam&#39;s prying hands off of his dick.  &quot;OK OK, I&#39;ve had my fun. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re desperate to return to the land of the living.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff tossed Adam onto his bed and returned to the Chronivac once more. First, he uploaded all of the photos he took to his laptop, also ensuring they were backed up to his cloud account. He couldn&#39;t be too careful... Then he opened up Adam&#39;s profile on the Chronivac and prepared the process to revert the changes. A timer appeared on the screen and Jeff leant back in his seat, his hands behind his head. He turned and sniffed his armpit, reeling back at the smell. In all the excitement, he&#39;d forgotten to take a shower! Jeff looked at the timer and shrugged. No time like the present. It wasn&#39;t like Adam was going anywhere...<br />
<br />
Adam laid staring up at the ceiling, cursing his brother. He couldn&#39;t see anything but the ceiling, but he could hear Jeff moving about. Then he saw his shadow swoop above him and disappear through the open doorway. He&#39;d been abandoned. Again... But this time was different. Adam could feel a peculiar tingle sweep through his body, almost like pins and needles. Underneath him, he could feel the bed covers shifting and shaping underneath his flimsy body.<br />
<br />
Feeling began to sweep through his limbs. Adam grunted as he tried to move his arms. He glimpsed something out of the corner of his eye. Finally! It was his fingertips! With a lot of effort, Jeff finally gained control of his arms. How he&#39;d missed free movement! He slowly brought his arm down and watched as each individual finger snapped free of each other, finally able to spread and wiggle his fingers after what felt like days of locked up limbs. One by one, he could feel parts of his body begin to return to normal. He could tell he was rapidly growing bigger too, the bed he laid on creaking as he piled on more weight. After a few minutes of waiting, Adam heard the telltale chime of the Chronivac completing its task. Finally, he was human again.<br />
<br />
Adam savoured the mundane experiences of being a living being. He took several deep breaths, filling his lungs and expanding his torso with every breath. He left a hand on his chest and felt the ba-bump of his heart beating. After a few minutes of feeling alive, Adam finally pushed himself up and twisted himself off of the bed. He stood up, then sat back down, then stood up again, laughing as that horrid stiffness had finally abandoned him. It wasn&#39;t until he looked at himself in the mirror that he frowned. He was still dressed in Action Adam&#39;s army clothes. He pulled off the camouflage jacket and dumped it on the bed, leaving him with a flimsy string vest. After a small search, he found his real clothes resting on Jeff&#39;s desk, still miniature sized. He sighed and put them on the abandoned Action Adam toy. They were a perfect fit. It was almost like a weird dream.<br />
<br />
Adam pulled Jeff&#39;s camera out from his laptop and looked through the photos. He still couldn&#39;t believe that shoddy looking action figure was really him. There wasn&#39;t anything that revealed the plastic toy was really a human being, especially when paired up with the original Action Adam. The photos would have almost been laughable if Adam didn&#39;t know it was really himself cozying up to that massive dick... He swept through and deleted everything as fast as he could. He then jumped onto Jeff&#39;s laptop and tried searching for the folder that contained the photos. But instead, he found himself on the Chronivac&#39;s homepage. Adam checked the hallway and returned. He had some payback to deal...<br />
<br />
Jeff came back to the room from his shower to find Adam on the laptop. &quot;That shower took longer than I thought... How are you feeling?&quot; Before Jeff could react, Adam spun around and swiftly delivered a knock-out punch directly on Jeff&#39;s jaw, followed by another dead centre of his face. Jeff stumbled back in shock, wiping at the blood dripping down into his mouth. His mighty beard dampened the blow a little, but it still hurt like hell! He winced in pain as he touched his nose and mumbled &quot;I guess I deserved that...&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam rubbed at his sore knuckles and yelled &quot;You think!? I can easily say that that had to be the worst experience of my life, and I once fell off a cliff-side and lost my fucking leg! It was terrifying and humiliating. I can&#39;t believe you had me grapple with your cock, and for what? Blackmail? I was literally a toy, you can&#39;t even tell I was human to begin with! And would it have killed you to put me back in my original clothes? That was one of my favorite shirts...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff dabbed at his face with a tissue to control the blood flow. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Adam. I know I took things a little too far by the end of it. But I had to make sure you weren&#39;t going to blab. I trust you not to tell mom and dad. But then you brought up the army wanting the machine and I guess I got worried...&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam sighed. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you don&#39;t trust me after all this time... I&#39;m not going to hand it over to anyone. The last people who need this kind of power is the military... It&#39;s going to take a while to forgive you... But only because I can&#39;t get this dumb machine to work!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed nervously. &quot;Heh, you... You were gonna use the Chronivac?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to give you a taste of your own medicine and turn you into a toy too but I kept getting error messages. Then I thought maybe a slug would be fitting revenge. But it still didn&#39;t work. Apparently I can&#39;t turn you into anything non-human while your fucking aging simulation is running, and it also won&#39;t let me stop it so I can make a change!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed in relief. He didn&#39;t exactly want to be made non-human after what he did to his brother. But the Chronivac not letting him alter his own stuff? Maybe there was an owner deadlock on the system that prevented anyone from tampering. &quot;Well if it helps, you can make whatever changes you want to yourself, or anyone you want, any time. You know, until you leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Way ahead of you.&quot; Adam scrolled through the options, tapped a few buttons and shoved himself away from the computer. &quot;There we go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at his brother but nothing seemed to change. Even his fake leg stayed the same. &quot;Not to be nosy but what did you actually change...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nothing much. Just gave myself a bit of an enhancement.&quot; He winked at Jeff cheekily, then pointed his fingers towards his crotch. Jeff&#39;s eyes widened at the thick snake that was slowly crawling down Adam&#39;s leg. Adam pulled down his waistband and let his flaccid member swing free, a foot long sausage that almost reached his kneecap. His testicles had swollen to match his new size, huge egg-sized  balls that lazily swung low. &quot;Not so doll-like now, am I?&quot; He said with a big grin. &quot;I had to make sure I was still the big brother in some aspect of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t stop staring at the display, his own cock twitching in response. He mumbled &quot;Huh... Not gonna lie, I expected you to get your leg back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam laughed. &quot;Why would I get rid of my prosthetic? It&#39;s better than a real leg! People always underestimate me when they see it. I&#39;ve scammed a lot of people over the years... Plus, it&#39;s a great way to pick up the ladies too. They love a good sob story. I&#39;ve gotten a lot of pity sex that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled his eyes. &quot;Of course you always think with your cock...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say? I&#39;m a hot-blooded man.&quot; He threw an arm around Jeff and squeezed him. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll learn how to harness your charm one day. A big, hairy man like you is bound to get a lot of men heading your way.&quot; He stressed &#39;men&#39; in a knowing way, followed by a cheeky wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thank you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t tell mom and dad until you&#39;re ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About the Chronivac?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, that too. But don&#39;t think this means I forgive you! I don&#39;t want to stay mad, especially now I know what power that machine holds, but it&#39;s going to take a while until I can forgive you...&quot; He sniffed himself with a shudder. &quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m going to take another shower to wash the smell of your cock off of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Adam left him alone, Jeff fell back into his chair and collapsed into a relieved mess. That could have gone a lot better... But it could have been worse, he could be a slug right now. Jeff reached up to his face and yelped as his fingers brushed his nose. Adam had definitely broken it. Hopefully it would heal quickly. He could always use the Chronivac, but that felt like cheating. And after what had happened that day? Maybe it was best to leave it be. It could take a while before Adam fully forgives him...</p>
