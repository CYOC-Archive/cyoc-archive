<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">…that she was an attractive woman. Susan looked at the self proclaimed witch’s profile - not that she was doubting the woman’s abilities after her own stint with curses - and noticed one thing above all: the witch was HOT. She was 25 years old, and her profile picture showed a very seductive look on her face.<br />
<br />
Susan felt her cock twitch as she loaded up the witch’s website. Ophelia Jones was her name and she claimed to specialize in curses of all sorts, whether they were benevolent or evil. Once Susan saw another picture of Ophelia on the website, though, that was all she could focus on. Ophelia was wearing a low cut top, and though she didn’t have very large breasts (only around a B-cup or so,) Susan was entranced by the cleavage Ophelia was showing. She was wearing a black dress that hugged her body, her short black hair was done in a very gothic style, her face was adorned with piercings, and the black makeup she had on perfectly completed her look. Susan gulped. She needed Ophelia’s help, and not in a sexual way. She decided to call the number listed.<br />
<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
<br />
After explaining how dire her situation was, Ophelia agreed to meet with Susan immediately. <br />
<br />
Susan got in her car, which had changed from a sensible minivan to a bright red luxury convertible. Susan grimaced as she got in, her having new, conflicting memories of getting it to impress “babes” that she’d meet. “The sooner I get this done, the sooner life goes back to normal.” Susan thought to herself, driving to Ophelia’s apartment.<br />
<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, after more than an hour of driving, she arrived. Parking on the street, Ophelia answered the door, and Susan quickly came in. Ophelia led her to her studio apartment, with a small bed in the back and a professional looking desk near the door.<br />
<br />
“So, a curse that changes the world around you. And… from what you mentioned, it’s the legendary T.D. curse. This is truly something.” Ophelia said, with a furrowed brow and a deep frown.<br />
<br />
“Even when she’s pouting, she’s hot.” Susan said, licking her lips and feeling her cock rise before snapping out of her lust filled thoughts.<br />
<br />
“What were the physical changes?” Ophelia asked.<br />
<br />
“A-a-a… a penis and testicles… to replace my vagina. But I’ve changed more since then. My breasts have gotten bigger. Firmer, too, I think.” Susan said. “And the penis and… testicles have grown since I got it.”<br />
<br />
Ophelia looked surprised. “Interesting. I’m assuming you didn’t… want to dress like that?” Ophelia said, referring to Susan’s cleavage and tight jeans.<br />
<br />
“No. Every three days, I get… extra horny, and my clothes, and house, and job, and… everything changes!” Susan said, starting to cry.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay. Let’s see what we can do.” Ophelia said, taking one of her many books off the shelf. “Ah, here we go. This should, hopefully, stop the changes where they are. Then we can start trying to reverse some of them.”<br />
<br />
Ophelia started reading what sounded like backwards Latin. As she went on, a bright light engulfed the room. Susan was blinded, her head filled with fog as everything seemed to change once again…<br />
<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
<br />
When Susan came to, Ophelia was on top of her, riding her cock. But as Susan processed what was happening, she realized it wasn’t the same Ophelia she’d met before - and neither was the room.<br />
<br />
Instead of occult paraphernalia around the room, sex toys and posters of naked women had filled it. There were still quite a few “gothic” items, but it definitely wasn’t the office of a witch anymore, far closer to a poser who wanted to wear black lipstick.<br />
<br />
Susan was lying on a king sized bed; any semblance of an office had disappeared, the apartment now mostly a big bedroom.<br />
<br />
The woman in front of her vaguely resembled a nude version of who she’d met before - but far more… sexualized. Huge K cup breasts stood on the goth’s nude chest, barely moving up and down - underneath her perky nipples and at the bottom of the globes, Susan could see implant scars on the goth’s pale skin.<br />
<br />
Ophelia’s waist was just as thin as it had been, but her hips had vastly widened, along with a huge stripper rear. Susan moaned as she felt the huge ass cheeks bounce up and down on her balls.<br />
<br />
Ophelia’s face was hardly recognizable. Much heavier makeup, bigger lips, a smaller nose… she looked like a gothic porn star… or… or an escort.<br />
<br />
Susan’s head felt foggy again as she felt a load of cum build up. Her balls tensed up and she couldn’t stop herself from yelling…<br />
<br />
“I’m cumming!” She shouted, as a massive load of cum filled Ophelia’s waiting pussy.<br />
<br />
Ophelia climbed off of Susan.<br />
<br />
“I don’t usually ride cocks, but that was fuckin good, babe!” Ophelia said. “Anyway, you paid already, so you’re good to go.”<br />
<br />
Susan was shocked. The meek, polite witch was now a foul mouthed prostitute. Part of her remembered Ophelia always being like this. And the part of her that remembered her old reality knew that she was responsible for this. She’d angered the curse.<br />
<br />
Another new thought filled her head.<br />
<br />
“I… as a tip, there’s something in my purse. And take some cash. That was a good lay.” Susan said. She couldn’t believe she’d just said that.<br />
<br />
“Oh, thanks, babe!” Ophelia said, getting up. Susan lustfully stared at Ophelia’s fat ass as she walked naked over to a purse that Susan didn’t quite recognize - far more expensive than her old one.<br />
<br />
Ophelia grabbed a box out of the purse with her name on it - and a crisp hundred dollar bill.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you can take more than that, sexy.” Susan said with a wink.<br />
<br />
She could swear she almost saw the pale whore blush when she said that.<br />
<br />
“No… next time. If you’ll have me again.” Ophelia said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Ophelia opened the box. “Oh, awesome! I remember you said you made dildos, but this is fuckin great! I needed a bigger one!” <br />
<br />
She pulled out one of the newest products Susan’s company made - a rubberized horse dick shaped dildo. It was at least 15 inches long, and the balls, while only half the size of Susan’s, were still impressive.<br />
<br />
“Glad you like it. I gotta go - work calls. Have fun with your next… client.” Susan said, kissing Ophelia on the cheek and grabbing her clothes off the floor and her purse from Ophelia’s dresser.<br />
<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
<br />
On the ride home, Susan seemed to snap out of her delusion. <br />
<br />
“What the FUCK was that?” She said. Something had happened. She needed to find out just how much damage she’d done.<br />
<br />
Finally arriving home, Susan went inside and straight to her computer.<br />
<br />
Ophelia’s website was still up… and completely different. It was an obvious self-promoting porn site now, showing off Ophelia’s new and improved body. “Lesbian Goth Whore” was at the top, and though she didn’t advertise her escort services, Susan could tell that Ophelia had become a far more… *adult* content creator. Pages and pages of lesbian porn were on the site, all of Ophelia and some other online models.<br />
<br />
Susan looked at her search history and saw that instead of the occult sites she’d been looking up before, they’d all been replaced with lesbian porn sites.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God. I can’t believe this.” She shuddered  bit.<br />
<br />
She opened her email next - going back months, there were several corresponding with Ophelia. Nude pictures, pictures of Susan’s cock, Susan setting up a “date.” Susan sighed, going back to her email.<br />
<br />
A new one had just arrived from a hidden sender. “Beware,” the title ominously read. Susan opened it.<br />
<br />
“The curse can not be dispelled that easily. Punishment must be dealt.” Susan read to herself. The email suddenly deleted itself, and Susan braced for impact…</p>
