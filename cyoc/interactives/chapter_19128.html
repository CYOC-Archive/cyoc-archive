<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason got to Eugene's house where Max and Paul were already waiting.  &quot;So,&quot; Paul said, lounging back in the chair, &quot;Eugene said something about a game with nudie pictures?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how.&quot;  Jason handed a back to each of the guys, keeping the last three for himself.  &quot;I think it's like Magic or some of the other games.  There's theme decks.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guys opened their decks, while Jason inspected his.  The one he'd opened already had a sexy fox chick on the cover, wearing an open geisha robe and nothing else.  He took out the cards and went through until he found her, the card simply marked FOXIE LOXIE.  The other cards were in normal denominations like playing cards, but for suits had Porn Stars, Myths and Freaks.  There was also a Revert card, a skip a turn card, and card which allowed you to force another player to play one of their cards on themselves. There was also a special foil hologram card, the Tranny, which when he looked at it from one angle, showed a sexy woman, but when he looked at if from another angle, became a handsome man.<br />
<br />
He checked his other two decks, which had an anthropomorphic wolf on one and a simple black cat on the other.  He opened them as well, finding Big Bad was the name of the wolf, while King Mog was the black cat.  The special foil cards were the Alpha in with the Big Bad pack and Beauty in with King Mog.  Big Bad had Athletes in place of Myths, while King Mog had Countries in place of Freaks.<br />
<br />
&quot;What specials do you guys have?&quot; Jason asked.  &quot;There should be an animal and a foil in each, or atleast there is in mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got Draconis the Dragon,&quot; Paul mentioned, &quot;and something called the Compass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got Bubo the Owl,&quot; Eugene said, &quot;and the foil is the Book of Wisdom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max chuckled.  &quot;I've got Jack the Rabbit and damn is he hung.  And there's foil for the Love potion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hand 'em here,&quot; Jason said.  &quot;These collectible games are never much fun unless you use all the rares.  We can shuffle the others all together, then take a section of them and add the rares back in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the Revert cards and stuff?&quot; Max asked.<br />
<br />
Jason shrugged.  &quot;Let's not worry about the distribution.  If it gets too unbalanced, we can always play a second game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul looked at his direction sheet.  &quot;It says that the winner gets to revert as many of his changes as he wants.  That really doesn't make much sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eugene snorted.  &quot;It's a game.  It's probably been mistranslated or there was a printing error.  Let's just play and see how it goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max nodded.  &quot;Yeah, it's just an excuse to oggle the cards anyways.  I love the illustrations on the Sex Drive suit.  It's all hot chicks on cars.&quot;  He shuffled through his deck, and obvious erection in his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Jason said and let the other guys shuffle the other cards, giving him a stack about the right size and letting him shuffle in the special cards while they put the others back in the boxes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I vote we skip the pass the cards around phase,&quot; Max said.  &quot;That's pretty boring if we don't know the strategy yet, so why don't we just keep the hands we're played?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds reasonable,&quot; Paul replied.  &quot;For picking who goes first, why don't we each just take an extra card and play it upright in front of us?  Highest goes first, and that will let us play cards out early, give us a head start.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Copacetic,&quot; Eugene said.  &quot;Let's get going.  Jason?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason finished shuffling the cards, dealing out seven to each of them.  He then set the deck in the middle of the table.  &quot;Okay, let's see who goes first.&quot;  He drew a card from the top of the deck and the other guys followed suit, flipping them over atop the card table in front of them.<br />
<br />
Jason had drawn the Deuce of Kinks, which showed a pair of extremely sexy stiletto heels with an even sexier pair of feet in them, and he was filled with lust for both...not that there were any sexy female feet or shoes in the room aside from the picture on the card.<br />
<br />
Eugene had drawn one of the Country cards, showing a silouhette of India and numbered 5.  At once, his hair and skin began to darken and his features subtly changed, turning him for a nondescript brown-haired anglo high school student to a nondescript black-haired Indian high school student.<br />
<br />
Max and Paul had both turned over Kings, Max's the King of Athletes, showing a nude basketball center, and Paul the King of Studs, showing an incredibly hairy muscular man with a cock down to his knees.  Max began to stretch, taller and taller as his clothes began to rip and he screamed, frantically kicking off his shoes, though luckily for him they had velcro closures to rip out of, but rip they did as his former size nine feet grew to something at least size nineteen while he stretched up to over seven feet tall.  Paul, on the other hand, was having his shirt rip as well, but only sideway, but he was still frantically unzipping his pants to keep his mammoth cock and nuts from being crushed as they expanded and expanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, this is just freaky,&quot; Eugene said with an Indian lilt to his English, then touched his throat.<br />
<br />
Max looked down at all of them.  &quot;You're not kidding that this is freaky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I,&quot; Paul began and then stopped because his voice had dropped two octaves, &quot;I think we both have to draw again, we're tied with the kings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max nodded.  They both reached for the cards, drawing new ones and flipping them over.<br />
<br />
They'd both drawn the suit of Freaks, but Max had drawn the seven while Paul had drawn the ten.  Max started to get bigger, and bigger still, going from a basketball player height to absolutely freakish giant, while Paul's cock continued to grow larger and larger, going down past his knees and finally reaching the floor.  Max eventually stopped growing, but Paul's cock continued, not stopping until there were a couple extra feet dragging the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm,&quot; Paul rumbled, his voice having dropped even further, having gone from the King of Studs to the extremely freaky King of Studs, &quot;I guess it's my turn.&quot;  He inspected his hand, frowning at his cards, and finally, hesitantly, picked one.  The Four of Myths.<br />
<br />
It showed an ordinary handsome, if sexy, nude man on it, but the moment it hit the table it changed, the man sprouting small horns and a goatee, while his legs became hairy and his feet turned into cloven hooves.  The same transformation took place in Paul, though he was so hairy to begin with that the extra hair on his legs was hardly noticeable.  &quot;It's turned me into the devil!&quot; he rumbled in horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not the devil,&quot; Eugene corrected with his sing-song accent, &quot;you've been turned into a satyr.  Not markedly different from human, so about a four on a mythical scale, but something that makes sense with how ridiculously masculine you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul drew a new card, bringing his had back up to seven.  &quot;Well, it's someone else's turn.&quot;  He began to idly stroke his giant cock under the table with one hand.</p>
