<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For ten minutes, Ty listened to the Blue Jay about her time after visiting him the first time.  When he wished that the bird had human intelligence, she was confused and flew away.  But after five minutes, her mind got clear and she was looking at the world in a whole different perspective.  She flew close to humans and begin to get a better understanding on who they adapt, what they wear, where they live, the foods they eat, even raising younglings.  She was quite fascinated by all of this that she wanted to live in their world and not the world of the Blue Jay.  Just then, she remembered the boy she first met and wanted to meet him again.  After flying around, she spotted Ty as he was entering his house and approached the nearest open window to meet him again.<br />
<br />
“And that’s how I got here…” she said with a clear female voice coming from her beak.  Ty listened in on this story and finds it completely amazing.  He never really thought his wish would make the bird think more like a human but it became far more amazing then at leas expected.  “Wow…” he said in complete disbelief, “That was amazing.  I never really expect that you would study us and how we survive.”  The bird shook her head for a bit and responded, “Oh well, when you have a mind of a human, you need to know about them entirely.”  But as she said that, Ty begins to wonder about something and asked her a question.<br />
<br />
“Say, can I ask you something?”  The bird cocked her neck and pondered what he wants.  “Sure,” she said, “Anything.”  “Why did you come back to me?” he asked in a questionable expression, “Is it because you want to be with me or is it something else?”  The blue jay looked at him and lowered her head.  Thinking about it, she looked back at him and answered his question.  “It’s a bit of both.  You see, I want to see you to say thank you for giving me this gift.  But there something else I need as well.  Watching the humans live their own lives made me think I want to take part of it.  So I’ve been thinking if you can use your power to make me human.”<br />
<br />
Ty blinked a couple of times and found this completely shocking.  “You want to be human?” he asked in pure disbelief.  The bird nodded for a yes.  “But why?” he asked again in confusion.  The Blue Jay flew down to the floor and rest there, explaining her reasons of becoming human.  “Because once I thought you humans were careless and mean.  But now that I have the intelligence of that of a human, I soon realized that your kind is happy and caring while my life as a bird is too tedious and boring.  I don’t want to live in that type of life.  I want to live a life where I would see new sights and smell new scents, a life where I can eat anything but worms, a life where I actually have friends then being all alone.  I want to experience everything!  So please, if you have to power to give me intelligence and a voice, you can make me human.”<br />
<br />
Ty listened in and couldn’t believe it.  This bird he gave both thought and speech wants a full body.  He thought this out and didn’t know if it’s the right thing to do.  She doesn’t have family or friends of birds and she doesn’t know stuff about looking for jobs or making any money.  But he could tell in her expression, or her voice, that she wants to be a human being.  Looking down to her, he asked, “You sure you want to do it?  Cause you have no idea what our world is like fully.”  The Blue Jay looked up to him and nodded in approval.  “Of course,” she said with complete enthusiasm, “I really wanted this.”  Ty rolled his eyes around and sighed to himself.  “All right, fine…” he said in defeat, “I’ll do it.  But under one condition.  If things don’t go well, I’m going to return you to your bird form, both body and mind.  Got it?”  The bird looked at him strangely but thought it would be wise to follow him.  So she nodded her head up and down in approval.  To that end, Ty smiled and knew she would follow his advice.<br />
<br />
He slowly started to approach the Blue Jay and placed his hand over her.  Upon doing that, he started to say what he was thinking in his head.  “Turn this blue jay into a full human female.  But no ordinary female.  She would have the most beautiful sexy body with wide curves, smooth skin, long legs, and melon shape C-cup breasts.  She would have a face of a beauty queen and the toneness of a super model.  Plus her hair, pubic hair, and eyes have to be blue since she’s a blue jay.  The transformation should be slow and painless so that the blue jay can experience every second of it.  And I want the change to start with her growing to human size then the physical changes from her feet all the up to her head.”  Once he was done saying it, lightning sparks came out of his fingers and went straight to the bird.  The Blue Jay felt that and was shortly electrocuted, but it didn’t feel any pain.  Instead she felt a warm type of sensation she never expected before.  Ty sat on the bed and watched on as he saw the bird was changing right before his eyes.<br />
<br />
First of all, the bird started to grow expanding twice her normal side.  Then the physical changes took place.  First the three talon toes on both feet drew closer together, almost joining.  Then two of the toes of both feet started to until they split into another two separate digits, making her feet have five talon toes.  All the toes started to compress and grew smaller as the hard surface of her skin went from being dark to light.  The sharp claws at each end shortened and became less pointy.  Her bird legs started to grow as her knees reversed directions, which caused her to stand on her.  The hard surface of her skin softens as went from black to peach while the indents of her feet and legs faded completely.  Within moments, her bird legs and talon feet had become a pair of human legs and feet, standing up on her own account.<br />
<br />
Once the changes reached her legs, it moved up to her body.  First of all, her back snapped and caused her body to straighten up.  Her mid section started to thin out as the sides of her waist compressed in the middle, curving and shaping into an hourglass figure.  The fur like hairs begins to retract and sink right into her skin as it showed off her tone muscles as a belly button appeared in the middle.  Beneath her belly button, Ty could see the Blue Jay’s vagina as it rearrange itself to fit to its new position.  He even notice the remainder of her fur like feathers shrinking to peach fuzz around her private area, forming into a perfect V shape and changing into a blue like color.   Her rear then shifted to the back and plumbed up while her anus sank into her butt cheeks, hiding itself completely.  Soon after that, her tail feathers retracted and thinned to nothingness while her nub shrank up high above her ass.<br />
<br />
With the lower half out of the way, Ty continued to watch as the upper half was the next to go.  With all the hairs on that part vanished, two little dots appeared on her chest and expanded.  They continued to grow bigger and began to poke out, turning into puffy quarter size nipples.  Just then, flesh around those nipples grew out and expanded into a pair of breasts.  They continued to grow from small mounds, to cones, then A cup, to B-cup.  Finally, after much growing, her breasts had fully become a pair of tear shape C-cup breasts.<br />
<br />
Moving down to her wings, the blue jay could feel every bone in her body crack and arrange into something different.  But she didn’t feel any pain what so ever.  Instead, all she felt was pure enjoyment.  Tilting her head down, she watched as the physical changes took place.  Looking at her wings, she could see the feathers thinning and growing smaller.  But that wasn’t the only thing that changed.  Watching on, she spotted five of her feathers, separating and drawing away from each other.  She also spotted a small peach object growing at the end of her former wings.  It continued to grow as her five feathers on each end grew smaller.  Another thing she noticed was that something was growing on both her numbs and absorbing the feathers along the way.  The feathers then thinned away and became nothing but five pegs on both sides.  And the more the pegs shrink, the more the flesh on all ten nubs grew.  Finally, the pegs that were once her feathers sank into her skin and sealed themselves shut the same time nails grew in and extended above her nubs.  Inside, she could feel the pegs changing and arranging themselves, adding cartilage and hardening.  Once she looked at the changes, she soon realized that her once flyable wings have turned into a pair of human hands.  Slowly, she flexed them open and close and was amazed at the fact that her hands use to be her wings.  She was also fascinated that she had flexible arms that she could bend instead of the usual flapping on her wings.<br />
<br />
But then came the last thing that’s left.  Being her body changed, her head was still that of a bird.  But that would soon change as she could feel her head shaping up.  She could feel her neck thinning and rounding into that of a human neck.  When the changes reached her head she could see her beak getting smaller.  But the more she saw her beak, the more her vision got closer to each other.  For as she was watching, she begin to notice her eyes drawing closer together.  Her ears, which were nothing but two small holes on each of her head was growing some extra flesh around it.  All of the little hairs on her face went right into the skin except the tuft on her head, which was growing down at the top and down her neck.  As her beak kept on getting smaller, something else happens.  More skin continued to down her beak absorbing it in the process.  During that change, the two holes that were on her beak got sucked in but didn’t shut themselves.  The holes remain on the skin, but the skin was growing something pointy on her face.  When it finishes forming and had a shape of a side triangle, she now had a human nose with nostrils at the bottom.  Her eyes then started to dilute themselves, as her vision was getting blurry.  What she didn’t know was that her eyes were changing from birds to that of a human.  Once her sight was returned, she noticed that were vision was changed and it was completely clear.  She could feel her hair creeping down her shoulders and moving down her back.  As the final changes happened, the remainder of her beak disappeared into her skin as the hole that it sank through puffed up and became lips.  She could even feel her beak splitting apart and shaping up in her mouth, turning into a set of perfectly white teeth.<br />
<br />
After over ten minutes of constant changes, she looked down at herself and was amazed at what happened to her.  Curious by it, she looked at the full-length mirror that was in Ty’s room and gets a better look at herself.  What she saw was truly jaw dropping, for she was no longer a blue jay.  Instead, she was a 24-year-old female human without an ounce of her old self.  She had an amazing body with bouncy C-cup breasts, a curvy hourglass figure, long tone arms and legs, and a beautiful face that resembles that of an angel.  The only thing that reminded her that she was once a bird the color of her long flowing hair the goes down her middle back and her pubic hair, which was blue.  With her new hands, she placed them on her face and slid them down to feel her soft delicate skin.  She then moved her hands down her breasts and felt a new sensation she never felt before, squeezing them and caressing them like never before.  Sliding her hands down her hips, she moved them down to her lower region and rubs it a little bit.  That’s when she felt a type of arousal in that area.  She felt a little hot and was completely flushed by this new feeling.  She immediately let go and took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
Ty was watching all the changes taking place and was in awe by all of it.  He never thought that changing her from a blue jay of a human being could be so interesting.  And he never thought that she would feel herself.  But he guessed that she needs to understand about herself once she’s human.  Once she was done admiring herself in the mirror, she turned to him and had a wide smile on her face.  “Thank you, thank you, thank you!” she said in pure excitement, “You have made my life a whole lot amazing.  Look at this body!  I look absolutely beautiful!”  Ty watched on and could tell that she was happy.  “Well I’m glad you like it.” he said looking a little unsure, “But remember our deal we’ve made.  If things don’t go well, I will turn you back to a bird.”  She listened to him and nodded, knowing she has to follow it.  Brushing that aside, Ty had to think of something else.  He then said, “Now all you need is a name.  Since you are human, I can’t be calling you a blue jay or anything.  Now let’s see, what should I call you…”  He began to ponder that as he put together what he would call her.  After much debate, he came up with a name and said, “I know.  Why don’t I call you Jane?  That almost sounds like you were a blue jay and would honor your former appearance.”  The former blue jay thought about this and thought that would suit her perfectly.  “Hmm…  Jane…” she said rubbing her chin.  She then had a smile on her face and thought it would fit her right, saying, “I like the sound of that.”  Ty nodded and was glad that out of the way.  “Now that you have a name,” he then changed the subject, “you need to clothes.  You can’t walk around the streets naked.  Follow me please.”  He then left his room as the woman now called Jane followed him.  From there they went to…</p>
