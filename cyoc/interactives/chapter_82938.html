<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As far as invasions go, the conquest of Earth was a quick one.  No one could call it a war, since in a <br />
war the losing side has a chance to win, even if the chance is extremely slight.  That was not the case here.  <br />
We didn't have a shot in Hell at repelling our new overlords.  When the alien mother ship was spotted, NASA <br />
tried to communicate with it but received no response.  Once it entered our atmosphere the combined <br />
governments of the world authorized the use of deadly force.  Every country that had nuclear capabilities <br />
launched the majority of their armaments and those that did not used lesser types of missiles.  It was a <br />
wondrous sight to see all of humanity working in accord for the first time in history but sadly our efforts <br />
had about as much of an effect as an ant pissing on an elephant.  Right before impact, every missile, rocket <br />
and other explosive devices(including bullets) winked out of existence, both those that were shot at the <br />
mother ship and all the others around the globe.  In that very instance humanity was rendered defenseless.  To <br />
prove their complete dominance, the aliens then transformed every government official on the planet into <br />
either an animal or a harmless object.  It didn't matter if a person was a President, city councilman or <br />
tribal chieftain, if the person was a political, military or cultural leader then he or she was transformed.  <br />
With no one left to lead them, people begin to panic and the world was thrown into turmoil.  Then the <br />
transmission came.<br />
<br />
   All around the world, the message was the same and in the language of the people native to that area.  It <br />
came from every device that had a speaker.  It didn't matter what the device was or whether it was even <br />
plugged in, if it had a speaker then it broadcasted the message.  If an area had no electronic devices then <br />
the transmission came from the rocks and the trees.  Everybody heard the message and when they did they knew <br />
that their lives would be forever changed and no longer their own.  It lasted over an hour and is too long for <br />
me to transcribe here so I will summarize.<br />
<br />
     While their true name cannot be understood by human ears, the aliens called themselves &quot;The Jaded&quot;.  They <br />
are near immortal with each one living for more than fifty thousand earth years.  While incorporeal in their <br />
natural form, they can assume the guise of any living creature they come into contact with or even imagine.  <br />
They can manipulate matter of any type, whether organic or inorganic, and transform anything with simply a <br />
thought.  Their technology is more advanced than anything ever thought of on Earth, even in science-fiction.  <br />
The one technology they do not possess is faster than light travel, which wasn't a great hindrance since the <br />
437 earth year trip from their home planet to ours was a short amount of time compared to their long lifespan.  <br />
Almost like us taking a few day drive to get to Disneyland, which this was very much like for them.<br />
<br />
     Originally they did not set out to conquer humanity but rather to meet us as equals.  They had been <br />
monitoring our planet from afar for millenniums but it wasn't until the renaissance that we piqued their <br />
interest.  The creativity and new ideas that humanity had was a treasure to be sought out by a race of beings <br />
that had seen and done almost everything.  They had planned to offer their gifts of technology and natural <br />
ability of transformation in exchange for us using our creativity and ingenuity to entertain them.  Living a <br />
near immortal life can be a tedious and boring existence and  anything that is fresh, new and exciting is a <br />
worthwhile prize that they would pay dearly for.  Sadly for us, near the end of their long journey(about 30 <br />
years ago) they discovered that humanity had reached its peak and our combined creativity was waning.  Old <br />
ideas were being regurgitated in our entertainment mediums and an original concept was a ghost of yesteryear.  <br />
We no longer had anything of real value to them.  However, they had already made the trip and decided to make <br />
the best of things.  While our minds were no longer of value to them, our bodies could be used to act out <br />
various carnal activities that they had pulled from our minds throughout the years.  And thus, we became The <br />
Jaded's playthings.<br />
<br />
The Earth was divided evenly between the 144,000 aliens aboard the mother ship.  Each one became an Overseer <br />
of a province and invisible barriers were set between provinces so that no human may pass between lands <br />
without permission from his or her Overseer.  Each province usually had one or more small towns or even large <br />
cities of humans for the Overseer to play with.  Each Overseer could set special rules for his(The Jaded have <br />
only one gender but may assume either one when in human form) citizens to follow but otherwise they desire <br />
that we go about our normal lives.  There is one rule that is universal in all the provinces though.  Since <br />
The Jaded evolved without having bodies, the concept of clothing is new to them and something that they like <br />
to indulge in.  In human form they always wear the most spectacular outfits.  Since people are beneath them <br />
they are not allowed the privilege of wearing clothes and must always be naked. The exception to this is the <br />
few humans that are special to the Overseer.  They may be given permission to wear outfits that the Overseer <br />
picks for them.  However, with the aliens's taste in clothing for their slaves, it is usually better to be <br />
naked.  Each Overseer has a special area of interest or fetish, if you will, and will change his citizens <br />
along the lines of that fetish.  However, The Jaded see childhood as a sacred time and will not transform or <br />
play with a human before his or her 16th birthday(the onset of adulthood is different for them)<br />
<br />
It has been 5 years now since the aliens took over and life has returned to normal.  People have gone back to <br />
living their regular lives.  Most people don't even notice that The Jaded are there, since they usually pick a <br />
select few to play with and leave the rest of the citizens of their province alone.  But for those select few, <br />
life can be hell.  We are about to follow the story of one of them.</p>
