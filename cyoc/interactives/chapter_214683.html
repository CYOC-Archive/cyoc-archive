<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“We will start with this one.” Said the elder merman who seamed to be in charge as he swam toward Kim, she was restrained like everyone else and was struggling, twisting and turning trying to pull at the sea weed holding her down but she wasn’t strong enough.<br />
<br />
“Do not fear child, you have been chosen to become one with the sea. Whichever one of the Gods or Goddess choice you, will reform you into what you really are deep down in your soul.” Said the merman as other merman in less ornate robes/vests came forward with knives and cut the seaweed. Kim wasn’t freed but now still restrained the merman where able to pull her over toward the circle in the center of the clearing. She was placed facing the sky…well the surface of the water, her arms still tied down with sea weed pointed straight out while her legs tied together where pointed straight out in the shape of a T. <br />
<br />
The sea weed was tied down to rocks and everyone backed out of the circle.<br />
<br />
“We call upon the Gods and Goddess of the oceans, to help reform this woman into what her heart and soul really requires.” said the elder merman “Make her a child of the sea.”<br />
<br />
As he finished saying those words, the seven mermaids and merman who sat around the circle their knee’s/tails in the sand closed their eyes and folded their hands like they where in a church before they began to sing.<br />
<br />
It was a different song then before, it didn’t cause anyone to lose control of their bodies or wills but it was still breathtaking beautiful. It was the type of song that sticks in a person’s head, that only the best of the best professional choirs could even attempt to sing. There didn’t seam to be any words that any of them could understand, yet there was clearly words in it. Like listening to a beautiful song in a different language. <br />
<br />
That is when the six humans still tied up in the sea weed noticed that Kim was no longer struggling, she was no longer attempting to escape. Her arms went lax as well as her feet and she seamed almost at peace. <br />
<br />
When that happened, the circle began to glow as the sea weed restraints melted away leaving Kim floating there in the ocean water. Her cloths, a simple pair of shorts and a white T-shirt then seamed to melt away leaving her in a sky blue bikini which only lasted a few seconds before disappearing as well, leaving her nude floating in the water.<br />
<br />
Then she rose up, staying in the same position so that her feet where now pointed toward the sand. Her face was looking forward and as she spun around, all saw she had a look of fear mixed with joy. <br />
<br />
Then as if this wasn’t impossible enough out of the eight statues which surrounded the circle appeared special, ghost like images of mermaids and merman who moved around Kim before one of them, a mermaid stopped and hooved before Kim’s face. The others disappeared back into the statues as the mermaid ghost or was it a goddess began to work. <br />
As the mermaid goddess touched Kim’s face, she began to mold it like it was made of clay, moving around a mole on Kim’s cheek which was always a sour spot for Kim and making that disappear. She elaborated Kim’s neck and pulled on her hair making it longer even as it braided itself up. Her hair also began to shift from a dark dirty blonde to an impossible shade of silverly blue. Her green eyes became larger before turning into an impossible blue as well. Her lips turned blue like a perfect shade of light blue lipstick had been put over them. With two gentle pulls, her ears became pointed like an elf would be in a fantasy show.<br />
<br />
Satisfy with the head, the goddess went to work on the body from the waste up, her skin became smoother as her hips became slightly narrower. With the skill of an expect molder of clay, she made Kim’s bust bigger but not to big. It was perfect for her new frame as her arms were also lengthened a bit. Her nails became perfectly manicured as well as turning blue.  <br />
<br />
Then the real work began, her legs. With a simple swipe her legs where fused together before the goddess pulled on the legs making them longer by at least a foot if not more. Then her actual toes turned into long fins while a sort of membrane like line was formed in a V shape around her hips. A very small fin was added to the back of the tail just above her ass. Then the scales came in, the mixture of blues, whites and silver was extremely beautiful and went well with her hair. <br />
<br />
The goddess smiled and nodded her head, spinning Kim around so that all could see even as she checked Kim over one more time. Kim for her part who now showing a wide and happy smile on her face before.<br />
<br />
With that the goddess/ghost smiled and kissed Kim on the forehead.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the sea, daughter.” Said the ghost before disappearing back into one of the statues even as Kim was lowered back to the ground. <br />
<br />
The singing stopped as Kim just lied in the sand, all her friends looking on in a mixture of horror and disbelief. Kim had always been a good looking woman, but now she looked like someone who could put professional models to shame. <br />
<br />
“Wow…this feels so good.” Said Kim softly.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the sea, new daughter now…we must clear the way to transform the next of your friends.” Said the elderly merman “Don’t try to move too much, your tail is still weak from the transformation. we will help you.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Said Kim as a pair of merman helped her up and placing her arms over their shoulders she was moved to the side, to about where she had been tied up. She was then placed down in the sand, her eyes where scanning her new body in amazement and joy before she looked up at her friends.<br />
<br />
“Guys, don’t fight it, this is amazing, I have never felt so good, so happy.” said Kim<br />
<br />
“Now, lets move on.” said the elderly merman as he moved around to select the next person to become a mermaid or merman.</p>
