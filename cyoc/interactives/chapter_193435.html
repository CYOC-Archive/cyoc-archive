<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle was preparing to take a shower before his sisters arrive at home. As the only boy in a house with 4 girls he had learned to be very careful with his hygiene and manners. He can&#39;t go around his house only with his underwear, fart or burp when he wants. He was even more careful when he was in the bathroom, using the toilet was a challenge, pissing without splattering out or pooping without leaving a bad smell behind. The truth is that was very accustomed to it, so he ended up liking this way of living and frequently he didn&#39;t like that his friends didn&#39;t behave like that.<br />
<br />
After taking everything he needs, towels, soap, clean clothes and flip flops, Kyle entered to the bathroom and closed the door to get some privacy. However he didn&#39;t know that he was being watched by an omniscient viewer, his friend John.<br />
<br />
Unaware of what will happen to him in a moment, Kyle took his clothes off and turned on the shower. The water began to run and Kyle hopped into the shower. He closed his eyes as he started to wash his blonde hair. The BIG Baskin software was already starting and despite John felt a little guilty of violating his friend&#39;s privacy he can&#39;t take his eyes off the monitor. At first Kyle couldn’t feel anything from the moving of the running water on his skin but his heart began to pound. Soap was still in his eyes so he couldn’t tell what was going on despite his body started to tingle.<br />
<br />
“I feel funny..” He said when he started to feel something despite he still didn’t know what was happening. He started to wash the soap out of his hair as quick as he could so he could see what was happening to him. Once he was able to open his eyes, to his shock, he looked down and saw that he had grown! “Whoa!!” His body looked a little bit bigger and stronger. He was a couple of years older but the changes were very notorious. “Am I dreaming?!” He looked down at his lean abs, and muscles.<br />
<br />
“This can’t be right!” Kyle was in disbelief as he flexed his small muscles “It is some kind of allergic reaction? But this is the same soap I&#39;ve been using for weeks.” Suddenly, Kyle felt a sudden rush of horniness and lost balance for an instant. “Ahhh!” Kyle’s voice had changed a little. “What was that?!” Kyle was too shocked to realize that he was still changing. His heart began to pound even harder his time.<br />
<br />
“Ahh!! What&#39;s happening to me?!!” Kyle placed his hand over his heart again. “Please, somebody help-ugh!!” Kyle’s muscles began to grow even larger. His body began to stretch as he goes through more years. “Ahhh!” Kyle’s size 7 feet began to widen a lot on the shower floor and John thought he went overboard by giving Kyle size 16 feet. “Ooooh!” Kyle&#39;s body continued to grow and stretch. He grew about 6 inches in 15 seconds. “UGH!” He looked down and saw his body growing larger. His lean abs became thicker, followed by his shoulders growing larger. He was probably about 20 years old now with no sign of slowing down.<br />
<br />
The rapidly growing Kyle tried to resist the changes, but it was pointless. His body continued to grow larger. His muscles feet continued to grow larger to a size 12 and still expanding. His legs and thighs started to lengthen and bulge with muscle. “Ugh!!” Kyle was well into his late 20’s now and he looked nothing like before. He pounded on the shower wall from the pain he felt from his growing body. His chest broadened and pecs began to rapidly grow in front of him.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, Kyle noticed that small hairs began to sprout along his growing chest. Without a father figure and very little interaction with grown men despite of his professors, this change was very shocking for him. He scratched his face as hair began to grow along his chin. His face was no longer boyish, it was now manly.<br />
<br />
“UGH!” Kyle cupped his dick and balls as they began to throb. “AHHH!” He didn’t know what was happening but his balls began to swell in his hand followed by the feeling of his dick growing thicker and longer. “Uuuuuuh!” He moaned as his dick hardened. It was getting ridiculously big and John remember that he hadn&#39;t changed the 15&quot; he had typed at first.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Kyle, my mistake.” John said as he looked at his friend&#39;s humongous meat while it started to spew out precum from his swollen glans all over the shower. Kyle was now a muscular 30 year old hunk with big feet and a way more bigger dick. Just then, when Kyle was trying to catch his breathe, a knock was heard at the door. He heard a few of sisters outside of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Kyle! Are you ok? We heard some weird noises coming from the bathroom. Is everything fine?” Kyle was going to answer but a deep baritone came out if his mouth and he stopped immediately. He didn&#39;t know what had just happened, but he knew that he can&#39;t be seen by his sister&#39;s right now. He tried to move but his big feet make him act clumsily and his huge erection was hitting with everything.</p>
