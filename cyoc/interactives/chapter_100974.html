“Eric, do you, um, want to talk at all?” Spencer finally breaking the silence between the two. They’d made their way from the curb and back to Eric’s house, more specifically to the Anderson’s backyard. Since the house was fairly off limits given the cloud of sex and pheromones floating around inside.<br />
<br />
“What’s there to talk about? Julie’s been cheating on me. I wasn’t giving her what she wanted, needed, and she found someone who was more than wiling to help her until I decided to ‘grow a pair’ and do the deed.” Eric said flatly.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure Julie feels sorry…”<br />
<br />
‘Ya sure. If she was sorry she wouldn’t have done it.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe, maybe not. Were relationships are very different than normal ones.” Spencer said.<br />
<br />
“You mean like the arrangement my parents have?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, I wasn’t aware there was an arrangement.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, right. My mom SEES other weres all the time. But she and my dad have an understanding.”<br />
<br />
“Well maybe Julie thought you two had an, uh, understanding in regard to her… needs.” Spencer said. She didn’t know why she was so uncomfortable talking to Eric about this stuff. Hell she’d walked up to Nate this afternoon and slid her tongue down his throat. Why couldn’t she talk to Eric about his girlfriend’s sex life?<br />
<br />
“No, we didn’t. I mean, I get that weres do have more urges than normal people. But you don’t see Ben, Alex or Nate humping each other every chance they get.” <br />
<br />
“If he only knew….” Spencer thought, remembering the looks Ben and Alex were exchanging over dinner. Eric had kept his head down for most of the meal. He couldn’t have seen the two making goggly eyes at each other on the sly. Even she and Nate exchanged a few playfully glances. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know what to do. I would have eventually had a physical relationship with her. I think I would…” Eric said, suddenly not sure if he would. <br />
<br />
“You’re only doubting yourself because you caught Julie doing something stupid.” Spencer says.<br />
<br />
“Well I’m not sleeping with her now.” Eric said, grinding his teeth in anger.<br />
<br />
“Easy there JAWS, no need to get so worked up. Julie’s only… well not human but you get the point. To quote the great Hannah Montana, everybody makes mistakes. Everyone has those days.” Spencer said, trying to lighten the mood.<br />
<br />
“Do you think I should forgive her?” Eric asked point blank.<br />
<br />
“Uh, well…. Personally I wouldn’t but that’s…”<br />
<br />
“Then I won’t.”<br />
<br />
“Eric don’t end your relationship just because I said something. This is between you and Julie, I’ve got nothing to do with it.”<br />
<br />
“Julie seemed to think there was something going on between us.” Eric said.<br />
<br />
“Because I followed you?”<br />
<br />
“I guess. And for other reasons…” Eric said, blushing a little. He was certain now that Julie had caught him staring dreamily into space, thinking about Spencer. He’d done it numerous times in front of her, which in hindsight was pretty stupid. <br />
<br />
“Listen, I’m no expert in romance. And I don’t really know you or Julie, but my advice would be to just think things over before you do anything drastic.” Spencer said. <br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Eric said. He was about to go inside and let his parents know he was back when something occurred to him.<br />
<br />
“Why did you follow me?” Eric asks. <br />
<br />
“Oh, um… I don’t know. Everyone else was pairing off, and I didn’t want to be around when they… you know… and I was curious.” Spencer admits sheepishly. <br />
<br />
“Curiosity kills cats,” Eric says, smiling for the first time since the incident. <br />
<br />
“Not entirely cat.” Spencer said, returning the smile. The two stare at each other for a while, not speaking or moving. Then a series of howls cut the night and startles them. Soon after joyful meowing can be heard from the open basement window, as well as yipping noises. <br />
<br />
“Gross,” Eric thinks, realizing what’s going on inside his house. <br />
<br />
“Do you want to go somewhere else? My house is currently vacant, and thankfully free of all these smells.” Spencer mutters that last bit. Eric’s dealing with enough crap, she doesn’t want to make him anymore uncomfortable by saying outright that she wants to rip his pants off and show him what he’s been missing. <br />
<br />
“That works for me, as long as you have HBO.”<br />
<br />
“Game of Thrones?”<br />
<br />
“You’re not a fan?”<br />
<br />
“I prefer Hemlock Grove.” Spencer says. <br />
<br />
“Never seen it before.”<br />
<br />
“Well, based on the, uh, things I’m picking up from the house we’ve got enough time to watch both shows.” <br />
<br />
Eric and Spencer walk away together, laughing and standing awfully close to each other. And hidden in the bushes in the Twists’ backyard, hide Julie Stovall who had sent her wereotter away, cleaned herself up, and ran after Eric. She wasn’t sure where he might have gone, but his house was a good bet. She only had to walk onto their block to start smelling all kinds of sex. She was tempted to call the otter back and finish what Eric interrupted. <br />
<br />
But instead she walked to the Twist house and cut through the woods to get to the Anderson’s gated backyard. There she saw Eric sitting on a pile of bagged fertilizer, with Spencer Lawson sitting on an overturned flower pot. Tears welled up in her eyes when they walked off together. The tears didn’t last long, as Julie’s sadness turned to anger. She whipped out her cell phone and dialed. <br />
<br />
“Julie, hey. Look, what happened earlier…” Her wereotter friend picked up on the first call. <br />
<br />
“Forget about it. Eric’s such a hypocrite, I don’t care if he saw us. If you’re up for it, I’m happy to meet you in the backyard again.”<br />
<br />
“Really? Are you sure?” <br />
<br />
“Yes. Eric doesn’t seem very torn up. Why tear my own hair out over him? I didn’t do anything wrong. He wouldn’t make a commitment, and….”<br />
<br />
“Julie I’m not one of your girlfriends. Call them if you want to vent. Call me if you want to have some casual, no strings attached sex.” The otter sighed.<br />
<br />
“Right, sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Look my mom’s home now, so I can’t come over. Why don’t you cool off, get some rest, and we can finish our night tomorrow. Promise.”<br />
<br />
“Alright. Thanks Brian.” Julie said.<br />
<br />
“Hey, what are friends-with-benefits for? I am the Justin Timberlake to your Mila Kunis.” <br />
<br />
“How flattering. I’ll see you then.” Julie said before hanging up. The pleasure she felt stirring in her nether regions was subdued by the envy she felt toward Spencer, who seemed to have her boyfriend on a leash. Wherever she went, he followed. Julie hurried back home, huffing and puffing for new reasons now. <br />
<br />
Less than two hundred feet away, Nate and his panthress were busy having their own fun. <br />
<br />
“Something wrong?” Nate’s mystery panthress asks. Nate had stopped his licking and looked up, his ears swiveling around.<br />
<br />
“Huh, oh nothing. Just listening to the wind,” he said before resuming the task before him (stimulating the panthress’ “Juicy Fruit”. His tongue lapped eagerly at her black slit, trying to get as much of sticky wetness as he could. <br />
<br />
“You&#39;re not getting distracted, are you?” she asked with a purr. Her paws reached down and found Nate&#39;s head. She playfully tugged at his ears, and then slipped a hand down to his muzzle. Her fingers dipped into her own folds before sliding them into Nate&#39;s mouth. He happily sucked them clean, before moving up so he could insert his rocket. <br />
<br />
“Not in the least. What could possibly more engaging than you?” Nate said in a low voice. Rather than respond, the panthress shifts beside Nate, and licks his hard as steel rocket. Nate shudders with pleasure and soon the night is filled with his own howls.</p>
