<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Gary was said today as he had got rejected 4 times in one week asking girls to the Highschool Senior Prom. It was was<br />
only week away next Saturday and he felt like he had ran out of options. He decied he would cheer him self up with<br />
a good cup of coffee and headed into Caroline&#39;s cafe. He was not a bad looking guy he thought to himself. Gary was 5,10  a bit lean and a<br />
 decent goatee with short black hair. He knew he was kind of of a geek but man 4 different girls? Well i guess I better <br />
accept I am not going to prom I guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
	 &quot;Hello&quot; said Caroline in a perky voice what can I do for you young man? Just one medium coffee with 1 teaspoon of cream no sugar. <br />
&quot;Sure thing coming right up&quot; Gary did not even notice her Jacking of a load of precum in his coffee. As he was to busy lost in though over prom. As Gary then reached for his wallet to pay he realized he forgot it. He sighed deeply nothing seems to go my way.<br />
Caroline  over heard something wrong hon&quot; she said sweetly? &quot;I forgot my wallet so i guess you can put the coffee back&quot; Gary said. Look how bout<br />
I give this one to you on the house. You look like your having a rough day. I put a little extra cream in if that&#39;s okay <br />
Caroline said smiling and putting one hand on her muzzle. &quot;Thank you so much he said I really have had a bad week thanks so much&quot;<br />
Caroline just smiled Saying &quot;Your welcome.&quot; Knowing that his day was about to get real better. As he was looking for a table to sit. Just then Alexa <br />
from the cheerleading team walked in. She was 5,7 with medium blond hair that curled at the ends. She had B cup breast and a slightly tan complexation. <br />
She made eye contact with Gary as he walked a booth in the back. Gary hid face quickly. He did  not try to ask her out knowing she was out of his league.<br />
But figured he knew through the grape vine his rejections. Alexa thought to herself &quot;well well well looks like the loser can show his face in public. bet he won&#39;t got to the prom she scoffed. I better get mine to go don&#39;t want to be late to cheerleader practice. She was wearing her red and gold cheerleader uniform with a school sweatshirt over it. Caroline greater happily &quot; what can I get for you Ms.&quot;? Alexa shot back quickly. a frapchino with extra whip cream<br />
and extra milk and a small bagel with cream cheese. she took enough glace back at Gary who just sat down at the back corner booth. &quot;look like the loser going to by himself just like at prom. then went to look at her phone. Not even noticing as Caroline adding her own breast milk to her drink and her jizz to her bagel. While this was happing Gary was hopping she would leave a soon as possible. He took the first sip of his coffee. His eyes widened as it was good. Like really good. He took another longer sip. It felt so warm and creamy going down his throat. He felt his Hips widen and his cock began to put pressure on his pants a well. He felt  his shirt tighten as his nipples began to perk Up and the mounds of flesh around them began to from breast. First A cup then B ,C D and stopping at DD cup. He remove his now ill fitting shirt as he moaned from all the heat and pleasure. He took the rest of his coffee in one long glup. while this was happing Caroline handed Alexa her food and told her to come back any time. Alexa thought to her self   if it took this long it better be good or I am not coming back here as she gave a faint fake smile. As she turned around she took a bight of her bagel and it was the<br />
Best bagel she ever had. The cram had so much flavor too it though she could not quite tell what flavor it was. It was not cream chasse but who care she thought. As she took another bite she turn back to Caroline and with a mouthful of bagel said : This is the best bagel ever sorry for being so rude to you. It&#39;s okay said Caroline.  I have had much worst customers than you. With her bagel now devoured she began to feel parched in her throat. I need this coffee so thirsty. She began to sip on the straw. And it taste just as good as the bagel maybe even a little better. She sip it all down and began to feel really warm. She Her breast began to swell to F cup size as her nipple stiffened into  2 inch nubs. Can I remove my jacket shirt and bra here I know it&#39;s a cafe but I am so hot Ms.... Ms . &quot;It&#39;s Caroline sweety and yes you may take all the time you need. You might want to sit back there with our other guest. He looks like he feeling a little bit hot under the collar too. <br />
Alexa noded at Caroline when she looked back at Gary she say him fondly his new breast with a tent in his pants the size of of Everest. As she walked closer She could smell the him and it made her pussy start to drip. It was the same smell as how the bagel tasted. She needed another drink &quot;So Thirsty&quot; I know I have been meeeeanto himm.. But.. maybe if I ask him nicely. She wobbled over to the booth. Gary looked up at her slightly embarrassed to foundling his breast in front of one of the most popular cheerleaders.  &quot;Hey&quot; Gary said in between moans as breast milk run down his chest. Hey &quot;I was wondering would you like some help down.. there pointing with one finger to the Tent in hiss pants?&quot; Gary Said &quot;Yesss.. Please that would be so great there too tightttt&quot; he said still moaning. Alexa need no further invitation. She quickly unbuckled his belt and pulled the zipper down. Out to both there surprise popped out a 16 inch horse cock complete with horse balls. Thank you said Gary in a now more famine voice. As his goatee disappeared from his face completely. Jessica ponder for a second how she was going to fit that in her mouth.<br />
      But It smelt just like the coffee so she was going to try.  She pulled the table out from in-between the booth. Gary noticing that Alexa <br />
had white fur growing over her abdomen  and turning  to blond  when the growing fur reaching her waist. Jessica got down on her knees and put the hot warm tip in her mouth. Both jumped a bit back by there mutual wave of pleasure. Now this was better than the coffee and bagel combine she thought. As she wrapped her tongue  around the hard doing the best she could wishing she could fit more. And just as she wished for it her face grew into a muzzle  and she was able to fit more and more of Gary&#39;s cock in her mouth. Gary meanwhile began to grow fur of his own as he began panting. A Grey color fur race  across his arms and rapidly across his whole body. Except for 3 black spots on each of his hips and cheeks. His face began to grow into a muzzle too as he reached forward and played with Alexa&#39;s tits. this spurred them both on. As Gary noticed that Alexa had began to grow at first a small cock but then it expanded to nearly rival his. Or was he a he? he now thought to himself as A new pussy opened up just below his ballsack and began leaking Juice. This was the final push over has he orgasmed straight into Alexa&#39;s awaiting mouth. She swallowed most of it finally quenching her thirst. &quot;Thank you Gary &quot;Alexa<br />
said panting. &quot;Oh it&#39;s nothing oh and by the I think i will go By Gina now okay?&quot; Gina said pointing to her new pussy. How about we both try out our new equipment Alexa? what do you say I am burning up down there and you look like your cock needs some attention to as Gina put one finger on Alexa&#39;s horsecok head. That sounds great Alexa said getting her second wind already so quickly. By this time Alexa fur and cover he completely with it being a white circle around her abdomen and breast and blond everywhere else. Gina laid on the floor now in all the mess and Juices they had both made as he stuck his Ass in the air with a newly grown black horse tail swooshing tail inviting her in. Alexa plunged in and began to thrust back and forth. This took away the last of there human forms as Both there legs became like that of a horse hoof and all. With Alexa growing her blond tail and her hair reaching mid way down her back with a one inch streak of white hair down the length of it. Gina meanwhile Love every moment of herself being filled to the brim and her Hair grew longer al the way to her ass just above her tail. After 5 mins of this Alexa reached her first male climax and guessed in to Gina. Leavening both breathless on the floor. &quot;That was great&quot; Alexa said Gina &quot;Can I ask you something Alexa? &quot;Go ahead&quot; said Alexa. will you go to Prom with me I don&#39;t have a date and I know you already have one probably but I think it we have so much fun there&quot; Alexa answered &quot; I had five guys ask me but I have not replied to them yet so Yeah lets do it because you certainly know how to party. As they both slowly stood back up. Gina&#39;s tail swooshed happily back and forth. Thank you so Much!!! I so happy. I don&#39;t know how i going to break to the boys but maybe we can invite them as group and give them some of our special attention to calm them down. She said kissing Gina on the cheek. Caroline smiled Looking back  a two more satisfied customers. She wonder how their Prom would go It sound fun. But It kind of made her a tad but lonely as well she say all these new wonderful customers who needed help and she was stuck behind the counter incase someone came in Or when no one came she had to pleasure herself with not one to watch or help her. She needed company during the slow hours for sure. Thats it she though I going to hire some help. Its about time  we will be able to help so many people.</p>
