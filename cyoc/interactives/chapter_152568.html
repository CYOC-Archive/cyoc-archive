<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Exchanger,&quot; she said.  It was the best choice, especially now that marrying Luke was sounding more and more like a good idea.  Glancing at her screens she noticed that the relationship score had skyrocketed with the sex and the talking, and was now at 67.  That meant she could add him to her party?<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet.&quot;  he said.  It was funny how different he acted now that it was public that they were both from a version of Earth.  He was clearly more comfortable, as was she.  It brought a dose of normalcy back, a feeling of home.<br />
<br />
She leveled up, and selected her evolution path.  She didn&#39;t get the charisma boost this time, but she hardly noticed in her excitement at the evolution. The XP boost brought her Energy Exchange skill immediately to lv 2. She wondered if she could drain Luke&#39;s MP into her own XP, refill him with her MP, and then do it again?  Depending on exactly how this ability worked, it was potentially quite broken even with the twice a day XP exchange limiter.  The skill explanation had an asterisk next to it, and when she focused on it it brought up additional information.  Apparently drained MP and HP could be converted to XP or MP, but for the giving of HP, MP, or XP there was no conversion and only direct giving.  Interesting.   So she could drain someone&#39;s HP, convert it to MP, then give the MP back?  If  she had the help of someone who used MP to heal, did that mean they could establish a loop to restore themselves perpetually?  Not mid-battle, of course, because they&#39;d have to have sex to do it.  She could be like an infinite supply of out-of-battle-only healing items, or semi-infinite, anyway.  There was such a thing as sexual exhaustion.  She wasn&#39;t sure how she felt about sex with for instance Venrie, or anyone but Luke for that matter, but it was interesting. <br />
<br />
Then another idea came to her.   If Luke was slow to level up, was that because he gained XP slowly, or because he required more XP to reach the next level?  If it was the former then she could level him up and solve his problem.  &quot;Hey Luke,&quot; she said, &quot;What&#39;s your class?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Commander,&quot; he said, &quot;It&#39;s a special variation of Ranger that comes with a Morale Boost passive skill that buffs my party members, as well a Tactician&#39;s Mind passive that gives me a chance at an intelligence boost when I level up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lillian grinned.  &quot;That&#39;s so cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, if I could ever level up.&quot; he said.  &quot;I&#39;ve been at this nonstop for 2 months and I&#39;m only level 4.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I&#39;m at level 5 in a few days!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez, lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m specifically NOT lucky.  You&#39;re the lucky one.&quot;  He snickered at that.  They discussed things for a while, and determined that she COULD level him up and solve his problem.  Damn but she had sure picked right.<br />
<br />
But it was getting absurdly late, and they were exhausted, so at last they went to bed.  Lillian snuggled to her man very happily, and the special feeling of being protected as his arm went around her filled her with warm and fuzzy feelings.<br />
<br />
They slept in as late as they could, but then it was time to meet with her party and do the rab-bat man quest.  She wanted Luke to come, but when he checked in with his character&#39;s father, the master weapon smith, he found that they&#39;d recieved a big special order and he really needed Luke&#39;s help today.<br />
<br />
So they would meet with the rab-bat man without him.  Lillian had convinced the party that she&#39;d been using a potion of transfiguration when she met with the rab-bat man, so they all bought similar potions.  Lillian showed up looking like her succubus self.  Miles was a were-bear. Venrie came as a Luldhan, which sort of chimera with giant golden antlers on an otherwise anthro-wolf-like body and with a snake tail.  Erika drank a rare Leaf Potion, which temporarily brought out her nymph side fully.  The boys had a hard time not staring at both of the girls in their new forms, but they stared at Erika more because her fully awakened nymph nature caused her to spurn clothing.  She smiled with smug superiority when she pranced by and drew the boys&#39; eyes right off of Lillian.<br />
<br />
Lillian just giggled and winked at Erika.  &quot;Looking good, girl!&quot;  she said.  She actually enjoyed the rivalry with Erika, and knew the girl was really nice when she wasn&#39;t being jealous.  Plus, she was pretty sure she was a bit bisexual.  I mean Erika really did look good.<br />
<br />
Erika looked at Lillian with surprise at the compliment, but then smiled back.  &quot;Thanks.&quot; she said.  &quot;You know you&#39;re pretty hot too.&quot;  She said as she walked closer.  There was definitely a rapid shift in their relationship dynamics occuring.  &quot;You know succubi only wear clothes when pretending to be human.  It might be smart for you to go naked too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, she&#39;s right!&quot;  said Miles with a little too much eagerness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Venrie.  &quot;It is only reasonable.&quot;  The wood elf was a bit more composed, but she could tell he was lustful too.<br />
<br />
She blushed.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; said Erika.  &quot;We&#39;re all friends here.  I want to see your radiant beauty in its fullness.&quot;  The tall warrior-nymph had a definite domme vibe to her.  To subby Lillian, it was hot.  The other girl towered over her as she closed the distance between them to inches.  &quot;So what&#39;s it gonna be, little succubus?  Won&#39;t you show your pretty self to me?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Lillian had a feeling that the rivalry between them might end if Erika could establish sexual dominance over her.  The notion was erotic, though she should stop things short of actual sex until she had her boyfriend&#39;s consent.<br />
<br />
But she blushed fiercely as she consented to nudity.  She moved to undress herself, but Erika stopped her.  &quot;Allow me.&quot; she said.  Lillian couldn&#39;t deny she was getting hot as the sexual tension mounted between them.  The nymph somehow managed to make undressing her as sensual as possible, briefly massaging Lillian&#39;s breasts as she removed her bra, and using her teeth to pull down Lillian&#39;s panties. <br />
