<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morgana spoke softly to herself as she crossed the threshold of the farmhouse. She whispered, &quot;Empress Morgana <br />
of Molossia.&quot;  She paused,as she barred the door, and added, &quot;It does have a nice ring to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She found the comfy chair, a flagon of hot spiced tea, and then sat down and gazed into her mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a lot more than 12 armed men!&quot; she said in alarm as she stared into the glass at the ramparts of <br />
castle wall. She gazed deeper, zooming in, and she laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clever, they look like soldiers, but are just scarecrows in armor,&quot; she sighed in relief. Then she wondered <br />
why the king should mount so many scarecrows.  As she gazed, a real soldier tugged on a rope and the scarecrow <br />
guardsmen lurched and moved along the parapet wall.  At a distance, you would have sworn the guards were <br />
patrolling.<br />
<br />
Morgana broadened her gaze, and discovered the cause of Molossia's preparedness. An encampment of over 100 <br />
soldiers was settled down just a quarter mile from the castle gates. It looked like the coat of arms of Prince <br />
Damon. She studied the attackers, and focused on hearing the whispers and rumors of the encamped men. Aha, <br />
something caught her ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prince Desmond, I do not think that the king meant you could go conquer a kingdom for yourself when he gave <br />
you this regiment to find his missing son,&quot; protested the captain.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know Prince Damon would have come this way, so they must know what happened to him. They deny that they <br />
know anything about him. So they must be responsible for his disappearance. If I have to conquer them to get <br />
to the truth, and I get to keep their kingship as my bounty, so be it. It is probably the only chance for me <br />
to become King Desmond.  I'm sure that Prince Damon will turn up in a week or two.  I asked an oracle before <br />
starting this journey, and she said that he was in a brothel somewhere.  Molossia may be small, but I'm sure <br />
they have a brothel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's in a brothel? Then why didn't you tell the king?  It's only an oracular prophecy, and his highness <br />
doesn't believe in such things. Prince Damon told him he would be back at the appointed hour, he wasn't, so he <br />
must be in trouble.  Hence, I have a small army at my disposal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your highness. Uh, but we did pass two crossroads, couldn't have Prince Damon taken one of those paths?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he could have, but it's unlikely. The first crossroad leads to a nasty old witch's tower, and even if <br />
Damon was questing, I don't think he has the balls to take on Morgana.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgana chuckled, and added, &quot;Not anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What of the second crossroads?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The kingdom of Flaccia lies that way.  Too depressing for Damon's tastes. Besides, if they had him, they <br />
would have sent a ransom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But couldn't he have just passed through there? They do have several ports.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Molossia first. Flaccia later, maybe. I'm tired, and tomorrow the siege begins. Good night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Prince Desmond retired. Morgana studied her future glass. It showed possible futures, but not necessarily the <br />
true one. In the possible future where Desmond became King of Molossia he was known as Desmond the Despot, and <br />
he inherited Damon's kingdom when Damon did not return. She chuckled, as she saw that Desmond's quest to find <br />
Damon would be fruitful, but Desmond was oblivious that the whore he was bedding was in fact the transformed <br />
prince for which he searched.  Good thing he didn't love Damon, thought Morgana, true love's kiss breaks most <br />
enchantments. <br />
<br />
She debated should she let Desmond overrun Molossia first or should she stop him and claim Molossia as her <br />
own.  Besides the scarecrows, what other clever defenses did the tiny kingdom have?<br />
<br />
She turned her gaze back on the castle.  Connie's widowed father King Constantine was younger, and more comely <br />
than she expected. He must have been a boy when he fathered Connie, as he could not now be more than 30. Not a <br />
single grey hair. Unlike Prince Desmond. He was not sleeping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think he has the princess?&quot; asked Captain Georges.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I wouldn't be surprised to find her tangled up with that missing Prince Damon somehow. She's as <br />
danger prone as her mother Daphne was,&quot; he sighed, &quot;No, I sized this Desmond up quickly.  He's a landless <br />
prince, and he's using his cousin's disappearance to make a land grab.  Unfortunately for us, it's our land. <br />
The scarecrows have intimidated him enough not to attack directly, but I warrant that tomorrow, we can expect <br />
catapulted boulders or worse. So we should attack first, before dawn. They are encamped a quarter mile down <br />
the road, will our catapults reach that far? And are they finished?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven are completed, the other five are nearly so, we are testing them by firing phosphorescent rocks in the <br />
opposite direction of the encampment.  All the fence posts have been gathered in, and are soaking in the tar <br />
oil, as you ordered. When you command we will light them and launch them like flaming spears at our enemy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That order may come sooner than later. When the carpenters are done of the catapults, set them to making more <br />
fence posts, and pickets. The children and apprentices can help too. I'm afraid no sleep for any of us <br />
tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then to Morgana's surprise, King Constantine started to assemble arrows. She liked this bold young king. She <br />
hadn't meant to teleport, she had only been thinking about teleporting, but she had teleported.<br />
<br />
King Constantine stood up with his hand on his sword hilt, but he did not draw his sword.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you? How did you come here? Are you in league with Prince Desmond?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the Enchantress Morgana,&quot; she said thinking quickly.  She decided to omit the part about changing Prince <br />
Damon into a woman, and shrinking Princess Connie and putting her in a jar. So she simply added, &quot;I came by <br />
magic, and I am not in league with that would be king Desmond.&quot;<br />
<br />
The king let go of his sword hilt, and smiled, &quot;While you certainly are enchanting to look upon Morgana, you <br />
have come visiting at an odd time. Georges, get a cup of wine for our guest. The Spanish Medoc from the bottle <br />
not the barrel of wine. Bring the bottle, I could use a bit more wine myself,&quot; Then he pulled over a chair for <br />
Morgana and invited her to sit. &quot;I haven't heard of involving yourself in conflicts between kingdoms, but if <br />
you are thinking about involving yourself now, we of Molossia could use the help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Georges, methinks the lady may be hungry from her journey send up some of that venison too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, I can see you are under siege, but you seem different than most royals, I have encountered. They are <br />
always pointing their swords at me and attacking me,&quot; Morgana said pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  No one should take arms against a lady as lovely as you appear,&quot; he paused and <br />
added, &quot;You're not using a glamour on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgana laughed, &quot;No! Of course not.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed in relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;I confess, I'm more than a bit flustered. It's not just that Desmond. It's my daughter.  She disappeared the <br />
same morning that Prince Desmond and his army showed up. I've been keeping him at bay with the threat of my <br />
army which I claimed was out in the woods searching for my daughter.  The stable boy told me he saw her <br />
dressed in man's armor ride out early in the morning, so I know she's just off questing again. Last time she <br />
came back with a frog, she was sure was an enchanted prince.  It was just a frog, but I'm worried she might <br />
walk right into Prince Desmond's camp.  And by now, I'm sure he's figured either I don't have an army or that <br />
they are too far a field to come to our aid.&quot;  He sighed again. He poured wine from the bottle Georges had <br />
brought into his flagon and then into Morgana's cup. The platter of venison lay between them on the table, and <br />
two wooden plates lay in front of each of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many scarecrows do you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Over two hundred,&quot; the king answered, &quot;We are trying to expand our farming, and have cut down lots of trees.  <br />
So we have plenty of lumber for catapults and pikes, and we had built the scarecrows to protect the seed. I <br />
plan to put 10000 acres under cultivation. Then we will have grain to sell, and more people will come to join <br />
Molossia. In a few years, I hope to grow our village into a town or maybe even a city. Oh, I have to show you <br />
the new tower. It's just really a big stone silo, but the outside is complete, once we build the stairs, <br />
floors and such inside, it will be quite nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two hundred scarecrows?  Do you have that much armor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Over a thousand suits of armor,&quot; he looked a bit sheepish, &quot;You see there was a great battle here hundreds of <br />
years ago. Ten thousand warriors fought and at least a thousand died.  Most were left where they fell or <br />
buried in mass graves.  I figured the steel would make good plow blades and nails.  So we gathered up all the <br />
armor and swords and shields we could find.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I may be able to help you, and you may be able to help me.  I'm in need of a new home. Mine got <br />
burned. And that tower of yours might do nicely for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you need, oh, Gracious Morgana,&quot; said the king on bended knee next to her.<br />
<br />
Morgana drank the wine unsure what to say. She felt as giddy as a school girl.</p>
