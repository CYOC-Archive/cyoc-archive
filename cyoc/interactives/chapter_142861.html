<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A thorough search of the cabin didn&#39;t reveal any telephone to the Miller family; it did, however, give them a good idea of the layout of the building.<br />
<br />
The hallway, with three doors leading from it, was adjoined to a large living room, a kitchen and a master bedroom. The living room was large, cosy and dominated by a large fireplace. Plush couches for four surrounded the fireplace with a large oak coffee table in place between them. The walls were lined with shelves and shelves of books and board games. James, who had taken that room to search quickly and glumly noted that there was no sign of electronic entertainment in this place. <br />
<br />
The sitting room was also connected to the kitchen through a separate double door. The kitchen contained a separated cooking and dining area; the former complete with a stove cooker, clearly designed to both serve as the main cooking location as well as central heating, the latter contained a solid walnut table and chair set. Cabinets full of crockery and utensils lined the walls. The room did not contain a fridge or freezer, though there was a door leading to a pantry, that James was surprised to find was full of fresh goods and produce. Finally a door to the exterior led to the back of the cabin. In the dark James couldn&#39;t make out anything in the clearing, not while night blind from the lights in the house.<br />
<br />
The third door off the hall led to a master bedroom. Henry and Joan wandered around the room, noting a few books lining the shelves on the wall, along with a corner dedicated completely to painting. Joan smiled at the sight, a lapsed painter herself she appreciated seeing someone with a hobby. A few paintings did line the walls, though the subject matter was surprising, the half dozen portraits were all nudes. Sublimely drawn and exquisitely detailed she inspected them while her husband checked the en-suite.<br />
<br />
A particularly muscular hairy specimen stood out to her, sitting on a rock with one leg up, bent at the knee, and a muscular corded arm lazily propped on the knee. The subject&#39;s head was turned slightly away from the viewer, though his eyes looked directly at them, smouldering with intensity. More striking than his gaze however was his member; lying flaccid on his horizontal leg, peeking from its dark bush it must have been a foot long. Joan giggled even as she blushed and bit her lip, whomever drew this model must have been flattering them significantly. There was no way a regular person could possess such a monstrosity.<br />
<br />
A call from Joan&#39;s husband made her tear her eyes from the painting, even as she felt her nethers moisten and hand drift to gently rub her stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bathroom&#39;s lovely honey. Proper large bath with jets and everything. No phone of course. Though that&#39;s hardly a surprise...&quot;<br />
<br />
He walked up behind her putting his hands lovingly on her shoulders and briefly scanned the portrait. &quot;Interesting paintings! That man looks totally inhuman!&quot; He exclaimed, laughing. Joan laughed too and nodded, following her husband back to the hall to find her son loitering and her daughter descending the stairs from the hallway. Jess looked a little scattered, though Joan didn&#39;t think anything of it.<br />
<br />
This final exit from the hall had led Jess up to the first floor, where a small landing with a solid door led to a second bedroom. This room was a very large twin bedroom with two very different sides. One side was filled with gym equipment; a bench press, treadmill and bike were scattered around a solid wooden frame bed dressed in blue bed sheets. That side contrasted greatly with the other, an otherwise pink dressed bed was beside a vanity and several wardrobes, no doubt filled with gowns and dresses.<br />
<br />
The an open door at back of the room showed a shower and toiled visible in an en-suite. Another quick scan confirmed to Jess that there was no phone present. Or even an electronic outlet; though the house was wired for lighting. Sighing exhaustively she turned and sat on the blue bed, being the closer of the two. Her skinny butt instantly screamed in protest as something large jabbed into it. Surprised she had stifled a yelp and hopped up. Flinging back the covers she gaped at the sight. A dildo had been hiding under the covers, black, veiny and gossamer the thing must have been at least 8 inches long. Closer inspection revealed it to be tapered from a considerable girth at the base, to a narrower point at the tip, missing the distinctive mushroom head Jess had seen on her friend Sarah&#39;s dildo. Her hand reached out to touch the thing, curious as to why it was the shape it was. Her finger met the shiny material as Jess was surprised at its warmth and softness, it almost felt real. She ran her finger from base to thin tip. There her finger lingered, swirling around it. again it felt warm, warm and soft, warm like her now blushing face.<br />
<br />
The bang of a door downstairs snapped her from her discovery. Realising her family members searches must have finished while she was playing around up here. In a blur she threw the blanket back over the dildo, covering it from sight, and made to leave. At the door she paused, however, just for a moment. Her next act she couldn&#39;t explain. Returning to the bed she reached under the covers, hand wrapping around the black cock and pulling it from under the covers. She swore it throbbed in her hand as she crossed the room and quickly stuffed it under the blankets of the opposite, pink, bed.<br />
<br />
Blinking in disbelief and staring at the tingling hand that had held the dildo she was surprised at the slam of a second door. Without hesitation, though flustered she turned to descend the stairs. There stood the rest of her family. Joan looked flush, James glum, and her father Henry quite chipper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well&quot; He said, &quot;Anyone find a phone?&quot;. The resultant shaking of heads wiped the smile from his face.</p>
