<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Whatever meaning the word &#39;normal&#39; held for Rachel before her transformation, it was completely lost now.<br />
<br />
And yet that was the only way she could really describe the next few days in her new state. Life quickly transitioned into a bizarre sort of normal. The first night was an interesting experience - as it turned out, she <i>could</i> sleep, but didn&#39;t really need to. A few more leading questions to Penny and she confirmed that none of the transformed women had to worry about eating, drinking, or any other kind of biological function. (&quot;Except for Tammy the Toilet,&quot; Birdcage said, eliciting an annoyed shout from the bathroom.) It was both a relief - she wasn&#39;t going to starve or dehydrate - and a disappointment - just because she didn&#39;t <i>have</i> to do those things didn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t <i>want</i> to do those things. Sleep was, at the very least, still available, even if she did find herself waking up frequently because of that hollow ache that consumed her when she was on her own. <br />
<br />
The next day, when Keira finally made an appearance in the front room, the other pieces of girls-turned-furniture all started to speak up, wanting to be used. Even Birdcage spoke up, wanting to be cleaned and touched - there was no sarcasm or resentment in her voice. The rationality of the girls around her seemed to have vanished. Rachel was resolved to stay silent - she was no piece of furniture, and she would be damned if she would beg to be sat upon. No matter how good it would feel.<br />
<br />
Keira sauntered through the room, looking around, touching various bits of the furniture, eliciting moans and sighs from around Rachel. She closed her eyes, feeling the sense of emptiness begin to, somehow, grow more desperate. <br />
<br />
Rachel bit down on her lip. <br />
<br />
She could feel Keira&#39;s eyes on her. <br />
<br />
A whimper escaped Rachel&#39;s lips. Shaking her head, she tried to resist the urge. Tears began to spill from her eyes. She looked up, and watched as Keira sat on the couch girls - who let out low moans of approval as Keira did. And yet, Keira&#39;s eyes remained on Rachel.<br />
<br />
At the sight of the couch girls being sat upon, something finally broke in Rachel. She let out a sob. &quot;P-please,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Please sit on me.&quot; She hated the words as they escaped her lips, and yet, her entire essence wanted - NEEDED - Keira to sit on her. To use her. <br />
<br />
Tears continued to fall. Keira looked at her serenely, and then turned and watched TV for a bit, not saying a word as Rachel sat there, crying, begging. Finally, when Rachel was so desperate she could barely form a coherent sentence, Keira stood up and strolled over to Rachel. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Rachel whispered. &quot;Please...please sit on me...&quot;<br />
<br />
And then Keira smiled, and leaned forward, putting her weight upon Rachel. <br />
<br />
Bliss. Pure, utter bliss. Relief. And spikes of pleasure that made Rachel gasp in delight. Keira chuckled and leaned forward to give her a kiss, her hand snaking down to stroke at her fabric clit, causing it to start pulsing with delight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm,&quot; Keira moaned in a low voice. &quot;See? Don&#39;t try to resist your nature! I can be very...&quot; Keira stuck two fingers into Rachel, causing her to let out a choking moan. &quot;...very...&quot; She began to pump the fingers in and out, and Rachel thought she was going to combust on the spot. &quot;...very nice to you. Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel nodded, beyond words now from the pleasurable sensations coursing through her. <br />
<br />
Chuckling, Keira stood and walked off. The hollow feeling returned, but it wasn&#39;t as strong as it had been when Keira was in the room.<br />
<br />
Rachel stared down at the floor, feeling defeated. She&#39;d tried - she really had - to resist the urge. <br />
<br />
She looked up, burning with shame, to look at the other girls in the room. She sought out Penny first. &quot;Why...what is that compulsion to be...used...when she&#39;s in here?&quot; she asked in a low voice. &quot;I tried to resist, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a part of our new state,&quot; Penny said, shrugging as best as she could in her table form. &quot;We want - need - to be used. Especially when Keira is around. It&#39;s just...part of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steph looked over at Rachel. &quot;I hated it at first, the whole...begging to be used thing. But, I barely even notice it anymore. It always feels good. Always.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel shivered, the memory of the sensations Keira had given her still fresh in her mind. &quot;It felt incredible,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a weird way, I think...to Keira...it&#39;s her way of being nice...or kind...to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Birdcage snorted. &quot;Yeah, keep telling yourself that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, seriously. I mean. She doesn&#39;t have to make it feel so good. But that&#39;s part of whatever magic did this to us, yeah?&quot; Candy said, speaking earnestly. &quot;It could be worse, y&#39;know? She lets it feel good for us, because it&#39;s better than the alternative.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or, it brainwashes you,&quot; Birdcage retorted easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look who&#39;s talking,&quot; Megan sniped. &quot;You beg along with the rest of us, miss wants to be cleaned and polished.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never said I didn&#39;t feel the compulsions,&quot; Birdcage said, smirking. &quot;I just recognize them for what they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally, Rachel thought Birdcage had a point. How long could someone hold out against pleasure that good? If it felt that good every time...she would be hard pressed not to be begging the next time Keira walked into the room. <br />
<br />
<i>Alright, so recognize that fact,</i> Rachel told herself. <i>Birdcage is right, it&#39;s meant to dull the whole thing. There&#39;s not much you can do about it, so don&#39;t focus on it. Focus on the rest. Focus on a way out. There has to be a way out.</i><br />
<br />
She wondered what her Mom was thinking. How much time had passed back home? Were the police looking for her? Her friend Sofia had a sister who was with the police department. It was pretty clear that there was little chance they&#39;d find her, but...she still wondered. Brooke, Sofia, her sister Michelle. She missed them.<br />
<br />
The next day, Keira went outside, leaving the front door ajar. Rachel couldn&#39;t really get a good look outside - it seemed like they were in some kind of countryside, though she could see some buildings in the distance. But a moment later, there was a gasping moan from somewhere on the lawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, gardening day,&quot; Steph mused with a smirk. <br />
<br />
Rachel frowned, and then comprehension dawned - of course. The girls had mentioned as much - that there were tree hybrids outside. She wondered what life was like for them - in a sense, they were still fully alive - just no more mobile than the rest of them, given that they were rooted in the ground. How much of their body was tree, and what did that imply? Did they photosynthesize? When Keira came back in later on, she wanted to ask - she was curious - but upon her entry, she joined the other girls in asking to be used. And once again, Rachel found herself on the verge of tears when Keira decided to entertain Penny instead. <br />
<br />
Rachel was still sniffling later that night when Keira had gone off to her bedroom. Moans echoed from upstairs, and Rachel found herself feeling curious again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So her bed is really a transformed girl?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Steph nodded. &quot;Yep. I think she&#39;s one of the original pieces. Maybe the original? That&#39;s the rumor anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
How odd it was - furniture passing along rumors. <br />
<br />
Rachel was glad that she hadn&#39;t been turned into a bed...for the most part. The part of her mind that she hated felt a sudden burst of jealousy at the fact that the bed-girl would likely be used every night, for long stretches at a time. How good must it feel to have Keira rolling around on top of you? Especially if Keira decided to use her &#39;sex toys&#39; as Birdcage had said. The vibrations from all that...<br />
<br />
She felt her fabric slit grow wet - the slit she couldn&#39;t even see, but could still definitely feel.<br />
<br />
And so it went on for the next few days. She&#39;d have idle conversations with the various bits of furniture, asking them questions about their interests and where they&#39;d come from originally. Penny, for instance, had come from Canada. The couch girls had been attending a college in Texas. Jade had been from Korea. And each had a similar story - they&#39;d received a mysterious package that had sucked them in, only to find themselves ending up here.<br />
<br />
The only one who didn&#39;t offer any details about herself was Birdcage - she wasn&#39;t even forthcoming about her name. <br />
<br />
Oddly, Rachel respected that. Despite how rude Birdcage could be, she felt like she hadn&#39;t given in. It gave her a small bit of hope. <br />
<br />
Almost a week had gone by, and Rachel still couldn&#39;t believe how odd it felt to be a chair. The entirety of her day was spent in the same position, yet she never felt sore. It felt like every moment she spent without Keira sitting in her was dull and lifeless - and those moments when Keira did, when she leaned back into her, when she fluffed up her pillows, when she had fun with her in exciting ways...it brought her to life. <br />
<br />
And then, one morning, Keira strolled into the room. Almost immediately they all began clamoring for her attention, to be used. But Keira held up her hands, smiling. &quot;Guess what girls?&quot; she asked. &quot;It&#39;s a special day!&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, gasps of delight erupted around the room, and Rachel found herself frowning in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guests!&quot; Candy squealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! She&#39;s right, right?&quot; Steph asked. &quot;Oh please tell me she&#39;s right!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Keira confirmed. &quot;They&#39;ll be here in a few hours. I&#39;m going to go put Katie to work.&quot; Katie was the oven girl. Rachel had traded a few sentences with her during the past week, though it was difficult to have conversations like that. She&#39;d also had a few conversations with Tammy. Those were mostly just awkward - even if she was burning with curiosity over what it was like to be a toilet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guests?&quot; Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
Keira&#39;s eyes turned to her, sparkling with amusement. &quot;Oh yes,&quot; she said. &quot;Some very special guests.&quot; The other girls-turned-furniture began to giggle and talk excitedly. &quot;As you can see, the others are very excited. You&#39;ll see why.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel frowned, and Keira wandered off to the kitchen. Katie and the other &#39;food girls&#39; often handled meal prep for Keira. Apparently Katie was one of the only transformed girls who still had use of her arms, allowing her to cook - though the fact that it was her own transformed body that she used to do so was hard for Rachel to get past. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guests?&quot; Rachel asked again, looking over at the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it when they come over,&quot; Tiffany sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;And just generally when they come,&quot; Steph added with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;That too,&quot; Tiffany said, giggling.<br />
<br />
Rachel was still confused, and Penny gave a small laugh. &quot;It&#39;s some friends of Keira&#39;s...that...well. It&#39;s hard to describe. And honestly, probably not something I could. You&#39;ll just have to experience it for yourself. It&#39;s...it&#39;s a good thing. In the context of what we are and what our lives are like, it&#39;s a good thing. Trust me. It&#39;s...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s so nice,&quot; Steph said, winking at Rachel. <br />
<br />
&quot;SO nice,&quot; Candy agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have Amelia is with them,&quot; Megan sighed. &quot;She can flick me on and off all day. Mmm!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, and Cora,&quot; Penny said in an excited voice. &quot;She never leaves any scuff marks, despite...everything...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are they...witches? Like Keira?&quot; Rachel asked, frowning deeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of them,&quot; Steph said. &quot;Consider it your first - and one of the few - glimpses you&#39;ll get of the outside world of wherever this is. They&#39;re...they&#39;re a friendly group,&quot; she added, smiling.<br />
<br />
Even Birdcage seemed to be cheered up by the news. &quot;I hope Heidi is with them,&quot; she muttered. &quot;The only one that pays me any attention...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully she will be,&quot; Rachel said, though she had no idea who Heidi was, or who any of the visitors were. She was starting to get an inkling of what they were coming for, and she wasn&#39;t really sure how to feel about it yet. <br />
<br />
Birdcage glowered at her, but didn&#39;t say anything in response. Rachel wasn&#39;t expecting Birdcage to suddenly like her or anything, but there was no reason to antagonize one of the only ones there that seemed to still be resisting her current state. <br />
<br />
The others began to gossip about the various girls they hoped would visit - and it seemed as though they were all girls. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Keira&#39;s thing,&quot; Steph said with a shrug. &quot;In case you hadn&#39;t noticed that she has a thing for girls, every piece of furniture in this place was once a girl. So.&quot; She lifted her eyebrows suggestively. &quot;Ooh la la, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel found herself blushing at that. She&#39;d be lying if she&#39;d never imagined being intimate with Brooke or Sofia. There&#39;d been several times where she&#39;d had to catch herself and remind herself not to stare when they were swimming in a pool. <br />
<br />
Well. She had no idea what to expect. Maybe one of the visitors would be friendly - in the sense of being a potential ally. She&#39;d have to be careful this first time of course. But it would be a good chance to get a sense of what they were like.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, there was a knock at the door. &quot;Visitors!&quot; cried Willa, the girl who made up half of the oak door in the entryway. The other girl, Juniper, was facing the other direction. As the knocking continued, she could hear the door girl giving off slight moans, and the sound of giggling from outside.<br />
<br />
Keira appeared a moment later. &quot;You all ready, cuties?&quot; she asked of the room. She walked over to the door and opened it. Keira spread her arms wide and let out a shriek. &quot;Lovelies!&quot; she cooed. &quot;Ahh, it&#39;s so good to see you, as always! Come on in! It&#39;s always so nice to see you all.&quot;<br />
<br />
And in through the door came one of the most bizarre groups that Rachel had ever witnessed - outside of the group she found herself a part of, anyway. <br />
<br />
The first one to enter was a beautiful looking centaur, who trotted into the room and gazed around the room with a smirk. A second, equally beautiful centaur followed. The first one, a cute blonde, looked down at Rachel. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there,&quot; the centaur said. &quot;I&#39;d, y&#39;know, take a seat, but I need something a bit more substantial.&quot; She laughed, and trotted further into the house, the other girl close behind - though the second centaur gave a wave and a wink to Steph.<br />
<br />
The next four people to enter looked relatively normal - though Rachel had a sense that they weren&#39;t exactly as normal as they looked. Probably witches, then. Like Keira. She was wary of them. But aside from a redhead who poked at Rachel&#39;s side, the four girls ignored her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Izzy,&quot; Steph said in a low, sultry voice. &quot;How&#39;s life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you know,&quot; said one of the witches, a cute brunette. &quot;Same ol, same ol. Spells to learn, mortals to pester.&quot; <br />
<br />
Steph smiled. &quot;I&#39;ve missed you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Izzy asked. She walked over to the couch girls, and then leaned upon the section that Steph made up. Still, due to the way the three girls were connected, all three of them began to let out small moans of delight. &quot;Did you now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh....yes....so much,&quot; Steph panted. <br />
<br />
Izzy chuckled, and then, right before everyone in the room, Izzy began to strip and leaned forward to passionately kiss Steph&#39;s human head, while her hand snaked down to the spot between the cushions. Rachel&#39;s eyes widened and she looked away, uncertain. <br />
<br />
The moans escalated as she turned to see two more girls walk in - girls with tails. They looked mostly human, but had a soft covering of fur, whispers, and had cat ears sticking up from their head. One of them, a wiry ginger, looked over to the rug-girl, let out a satisfied purr, and literally pounced over. <br />
<br />
More &#39;friends&#39; of Keira&#39;s entered - a menagerie of various creatures that Rachel would have once considered mythological. Including a girl with snakes for hair who was wearing sunglasses. Rachel tried not to look at that one. Being a chair was bad enough - she didn&#39;t need to be turned to stone on top of that. There was a cluster of vampires - one of whom went over to Megan with a sly smile. Another group of what she was pretty sure where ghosts, given that she could kinda see through them. They drifted around, one of them going up to Hailee, the ceiling fan above. A woman who seemed like she was part bird - a harpy was the term, Rachel was fairly certain - came flying into the room, and ended up going straight to Birdcage. To Rachel&#39;s shock, Birdcage actually smiled and let out a squeal when the harpy grabbed on to her and wrapped her wings around the cage. It was the first time she&#39;d seen a look of genuine joy on the girls face. <br />
<br />
Some drifted into the kitchen - others into other rooms. Moans began to filter in from all directions, including outside. <br />
<br />
Rachel watched the other girls being played with, feeling a sharp pang of jealousy. No...no! She wasn&#39;t supposed to be jealous about this!<br />
<br />
She closed her eyes, swallowing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, before I forget, I have a new arrival,&quot; Keira said, as though she&#39;d been waiting for Rachel to show signs of resistance. <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she whispered - low enough that she thought only she could hear herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Keira whispered in her ear, making her neck and upper arms erupt in goosebumps. &quot;Cute little Rachel here! Quite the comfy chair, I can assure you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh,&quot; said a melodic voice.<br />
<br />
Rachel looked up, heart beginning to race. The voice belonged to...<br />
<br />
It was the most beautiful creature she&#39;d ever seen. A mermaid, using some kind of magic looking wheelchair made of glass and coral to get around on land. Her skin shimmered in the light, as though coated with glitter; the smell of the sea wafted from her. The top half of her body looked mostly normal, save for the gills along her side and the patches of scales covering her breasts. She had long, curly brown hair and tan skin. Her golden orange tail was long - if she&#39;d been able to stand up, she would&#39;ve been taller than anyone Rachel had seen before. It was somewhat slimy looking, but also beautiful. Rachel found her mouth dropping open at the sight, a pulse of need and desire flooding through her - and pangs of jealousy. Of all the things to be turned into, she&#39;d been turned into a chair - how fair was that when mermaids actually existed? <br />
<br />
A moment later, another mermaid appeared behind her. This one had longer, blonde hair, and a glittering blue-purple tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are cute,&quot; the first mermaid said, giggling. Her voice tickled at Rachel&#39;s ears like a beautiful song. <br />
<br />
Rachel forgot all about Keira in that moment. Something about that voice...<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re...you&#39;re both so beautiful,&quot; Rachel gasped in a husky voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Awww, thank you!&quot; the mermaid cooed. &quot;I&#39;m Phoebe, and this is Claire...want us to entertain you? You look a lot more comfy than this old thing,&quot; Phoebe said, patting her wheelchair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rachel gasped, voice full of desire. &quot;Yes, very much so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Giggling, and with more dexterity than Rachel would&#39;ve thought possible of a mermaid, Phoebe moved herself from the wheelchair to Rachel. Rachel let out a moan as she felt the weight of the mermaid settle into her. She could feel the scales of Phoebe&#39;s tail sliding against the fabric of her lower body, and she let out a shuddering moan. Phoebe&#39;s face was inches from her own - the mermaid&#39;s skin seemed almost wet in the light, and she smiled at Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such comfy pillows,&quot; Phoebe said happily, reaching up to grope them. &quot;And your upholstering is sooooo nice...silky smooth. It feels so good on my scales. Come on Claire, don&#39;t be shy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire smiled. &quot;Well, if she&#39;s as comfortable as you say....&quot;<br />
<br />
The other mermaid flipped herself over to join Phoebe, and Rachel found herself letting out a shuddering gasp at the sudden sensation of not one, but two mermaids sitting upon her. The mermaids giggled, and then began to make out atop of her - the constant shifting of their bodies and tails sent an endless rivulet of pleasure through her inanimate body. She found herself gasping from it, overwhelmed - only to find it reach new levels when the two mermaids twisted up and began to make out with her as well, even as their fingers began to seek out her fabric pussy. Soon, she was crying out from the sensations.<br />
<br />
And part of her knew she wasn&#39;t the only one. Some of the other girls in the room were doing the same. A few of the witches had disrobed and were having sex on and with the couch girls. Some woman with a snake tail had slithered over to Penny and was currently wrapping herself around the table, causing Penny to cry out in ecstasy. <br />
<br />
Phoebe and Claire began to grind their tails against each other, and Rachel tossed back her head from the sensations.<br />
<br />
All thoughts of finding a way out of this predicament fled her - all she cared about anymore were the two mermaids perched atop her, and she hungrily tipped her head forward, eagerly leaning into the kisses, wishing that she could move her hands to put around them, or her legs to wrap around the tails - and still enjoying the mind-numbing pleasure they were giving her, rubbing every inch of her inanimate form and making her clit pulse with an intensity she&#39;d never felt. <br />
<br />
