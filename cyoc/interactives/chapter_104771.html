<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having sorted through all of your plain-coloured clothes, you decide to start sifting through the dual-coloured ones. Surprisingly, there are only a few of them, so this will go by quickly.<br />
<br />
All but one of them are flesh above another colour. You decide that you will go for the exception first. This one is quite interesting – white on the left side and black on the right, and it&#39;s much lacier and frillier than most t-shirts have any right being. The whole thing seems abnormally wide, and you soon discover why. Resting between your shoulders are not one head, but two! Both of your heads looked at the mirror. Not only have your heads multiplied, but you have a third breast between your originals, and a third leg (which conveniently destroyed another pair of shorts and panties)! The head you are looking from is on the left has platinum blonde hair, whereas the other head has raven black hair. However, there are no other differences, as the hair on both heads is somewhat curly and stretches down to your waist. Experimentally, you move a leg, and your other head has the same idea. Walking tripedally is awkward at first, but you seem to be able to predict the movements of your other head and eventually move about. It seems you control the left leg while the other head controls the right, and you seem to share the middle one. Even so, both of you seem to feel the same things. Experimentally, you try to talk to the other head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you also me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was starting to get confusing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we the same person?&quot; Both of you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we&#39;re exact copies!&quot; The other you says.<br />
<br />
&quot;If so, who&#39;s the original, if either of us?&quot; Both of you scratch your heads exactly the same way, causing both of you to laugh uncontrollably. Your clone is the first to speak again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we just split off. Let&#39;s take the shirt off and find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure enough, as both of you take the shirt off (which is not that hard despite you only controlling one arm), you gain the memories of both you and the other head. The second entry in your 2-colour list is made:<br />
<br />
Left half white, right half black: Conjoined. Gains third breast and leg. Coordination needs practice initially. May be either left or right head when shirt worn. Thoughts separate when heads separate but memories shared when back together. Use at home only.<br />
<br />
The transformation had, unfortunately, ripped all of your clothes, but as you remembered that the centauress transformation had a similar effect, you decide to remain otherwise naked as you put on the next shirt – flesh above black. After pulling the shirt on you feel a bit uneasy on your feet. Looking back, you find you have eight! They are attached to a single central body piece from which your human part emerges. Your lower body has been replaced with that of a huge spider! You scuttle about uneasily, but soon get used to the rhythm and are able to move about with ease, and even climb walls and the ceiling. You look at the back of the torso and try to produce some silk. It works, and you are able to draw ropes of silk across the room. You drop from the ceiling, managing to land on your many hairy legs, and remove the shirt.<br />
<br />
Next up is one with flesh on top and green below. This one is quite interesting, as as soon as you put it on, you fall flat on your face. Turning over, you see that your lower body has been replaced with a snake&#39;s tail twice your old height. You flick it experimentally and try to slither about, and do so quite successfully. It seems the shirt on your human upper body is similarly smooth and allows you to travel without having to hold your torso above the ground. You try again to orient yourself upright, and find the only way to really do it is coil your tail, forming a sort of conical base above which your human self rests. You let out a playful hiss, and pull off the shirt.<br />
<br />
Two more remain, the first of which is flesh above white. Trying it on, you find yourself in a similar position to the centauress one, but less energetic and somewhat bulkier. You look behind you to see the body of a dairy cow, and look in the mirror to find small horns on the sides of your head and cute cow ears on the side of your head. You try to move about like in your centauress form, but find yourself moving sluggishly and unable to turn easily. Deciding that this one is trouble, too, you decide to take off the shirt.<br />
<br />
Finally, you pick up the last shirt, one with flesh above blue. However, the blue has a glittery sheen to it. You think that this shirt may be water related, so you sit in the bathtub before putting the shirt on.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness you did, because you find your legs have fused into the tail of a fish! The scales are a brilliant blue and gleam whenever moved slightly, and what were once your legs taper until they reach a beautiful and symmetrical tailfin. There are fins by your hips and one that has grown out of the lower third of your back, although it seems to be foldable since you can lie on your back quite comfortably. Your hands have grown scales, too, and small fins are attached to your wrists. You look in the mirror and find that your ears have stretched out into fins, too, and your hair has turned blue and lengthened as well. In addition, your neck appears to have gill slits, although you still breathe through your nose. You feel dry, so you run the taps and slowly immerse yourself in the water. You experimentally place your head underwater and try to breathe, and find your gills filter the air perfectly. Your hearing also seems to have improved from on dry land. You feel like you can hear the whole city&#39;s water system from your little tub, and so, listening to the sound of running water, you drift off to sleep. <br />
<br />
When you get up the next morning, it is Saturday. You take the shirt off and note the new forms. The list seems to need some reorganising, so you do so, leaving you with a list that looks like this, with stars marking ones you will wear often and hears representing your favourites:<br />
<br />
PLAIN:<br />
*White: Breasts expand with milk. Fun and sexy. Only wear if guaranteed to have time alone to milk self.<br />
Pink: Sexiness dialled up to 11, but intelligence drops to bimbo when not paying attention to anything. Voice changes, too. Only wear in the apartment.<br />
Black: Vampire. Awesome mobility after consuming blood, but can&#39;t eat anything else and burns in sunlight. May or may not need to consume some kind of blood before taking shirt off. Only wear at night.<br />
Blue: Male. This one is creepy, but safe to use in public.<br />
Yellow: Fills bladder and removes bladder control. Kinky, but impractical. Like pink shirt, only wear at home.<br />
Red: Muscles galore. Voice deepens, height increases. Strength takes getting used to, avoid handling fragile objects.<br />
*Green: Plant girl &lt;3. Energised by sunlight and slightly less so by water. Face stays same but skin, hair and genitals change drastically. Use only when alone.<br />
*Purple: Hermaphrodite. Penis replaces clit and urethra, but no testicles, and vagina still present. Safe to use in public as long as reasonable underwear substitute is found.<br />
<br />
FLESH + COLOUR (alone only): <br />
*Bottom half brown: Centauress &lt;3. Horse body strong, but takes time to adapt to having 6 limbs. Shreds clothes on lower body.<br />
Bottom half grey: Spider lower body. Mobile and quite fun, but can be messy if the web-spinning gets out of hand.<br />
Bottom half white: Dairy cow lower body. Cute but unwieldy.<br />
Bottom half green: Snake lower body. Also mobile, but takes up a lot of space and can&#39;t move upright, at least not yet.<br />
Bottom half blue: Mermaid &lt;3. Impractical at home, but most bodies of water would be too public. Save this for a good opportunity.<br />
<br />
OTHER:<br />
Left half white, right half black: Conjoined. Gains third boob and leg. Coordination needs practice. May be either left or right head when shirt worn. Thoughts separate when heads separate but memories shared when back together. Use at home only.</p>
