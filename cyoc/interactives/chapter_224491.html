<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As their workout at the gym continued, the atmosphere grew increasingly comfortable and casual for all the men present, including Drake and Alan. Drake was still feeling something was off, but the gym&#39;s unique environment seemed perfectly normal to him.<br />
<br />
Mark, after their previous conversation, took another break from his weightlifting to strike up another chat. &quot;Hey, guys, it&#39;s great to see new faces around here. By the way, I&#39;ve been wondering, are you guys straight or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan, confident and openly gay, didn&#39;t hesitate to answer, &quot;I&#39;m gay, Mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark nodded with a smile, showing his welcoming and inclusive attitude. &quot;Cool, man. It&#39;s all good here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake, who was straight but had already experienced the gym&#39;s unconventional norms, decided to go along with it. &quot;I&#39;m straight,&quot; he replied, somewhat hesitantly.<br />
<br />
Mark gave Drake an understanding nod. &quot;Alright, then. Hey, since you&#39;re straight, do you mind being my shower buddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake, still adjusting to the changes around him and not wanting to stand out, agreed, &quot;Sure, no problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Mark and Drake planned to be shower buddies after their workout. Drake wasn&#39;t sure what a shower buddy was but he vaguely remembered hearing about it during the tour of campus during orientation. <br />
<br />
As Drake continued his workout, he couldn&#39;t help but feel that this place was growing on him. <br />
<br />
After their workout, it was time for Mark and Drake to head to the showers. Alan, who was openly gay and comfortable with the gym&#39;s unique setup, headed to the designated section for gay men. He exchanged friendly nods with some fellow gym-goers as he made his way there.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Drake, still adjusting to the gym&#39;s norms and wanting to fit in, walked alongside Mark toward the section where straight men paired up for showers. Mark, who had asked Drake to be his shower buddy earlier, led the way.<br />
<br />
As they entered the shower area, Drake couldn&#39;t help but notice how comfortable everyone seemed with this arrangement. The gym-goers were chatting, laughing, and carrying on as if this were a perfectly normal part of their daily routine. Drake, although initially hesitant, was starting to accept the gym&#39;s culture and embrace it.<br />
<br />
Mark and Drake found a shower stall big enough for two and began their post-workout shower. The warm water was refreshing, and Drake couldn&#39;t deny that it felt relaxing.<br />
<br />
As the warm water cascaded over them in the gym&#39;s shower area, Mark and Drake continued their conversation. They chatted about various topics, including their classes, their interests, and, inevitably, the women they found attractive.<br />
<br />
Mark, scrubbing his hair, grinned. &quot;You know, Drake, there&#39;s this girl in my psychology class, Sarah. She&#39;s something else, man. Beautiful, smart, and a great sense of humor. I&#39;ve been trying to work up the courage to ask her out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake, feeling comfortable in this unconventional gym setting, chuckled. &quot;I hear you, Mark. There&#39;s this girl in my literature class, Emily. She&#39;s got this amazing smile, and she&#39;s so passionate about books. I can&#39;t help but be drawn to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their conversation flowed naturally, and as they continued to shower. Mark, without any hesitation, started to wash Drake&#39;s back as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world. Drake, in turn, washed Mark&#39;s back without a second thought.<br />
<br />
As the steamy shower continued, their closeness and comfort with each other grew, and they began to wash each other up more thoroughly. They stopped taking turns washing each other&#39;s backs and faced each other.<br />
<br />
Drake, his fingers tracing the contours of Mark&#39;s muscular pecs, spoke softly, &quot;You know, Mark, I can&#39;t get Emily out of my head. Her smile, the way she talks... really want to fuck her so badly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark, his lips brushing against Drake&#39;s neck as he responded, couldn&#39;t help but be drawn into the conversation. &quot;I totally get it, man. Sarah, she&#39;s got this aura about her. When she walks into a room, it&#39;s like everything else fades away. It&#39;s as if the world revolves around her.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Mark&#39;s hands moved with a subtle urgency as he traced the contours of Drake&#39;s body. &quot;You know,&quot; Mark said in a low, intimate tone, &quot;I&#39;ve did fuck Sarah, it was so hot...&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake, his breath catching as Mark&#39;s touch elicited shivers of desire, managed to respond, &quot;Emily has amazing tits man.... I wanna feel em...&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake squeezed Mark&#39;s muscular pecs as he finished his sentence. Mark&#39;s lips met Drake&#39;s with a deep, passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
Drake, overwhelmed by desire, dropped to his knees before Mark.<br />
<br />
Drake&#39;s hands gently explored Mark&#39;s thighs as he knelt before him. His breath was heavy with anticipation as he looked up at Mark, his desire burning in his eyes. &quot;Tell me more about Emily,&quot; Drake said, his voice husky with desire.<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s gaze met Drake&#39;s, filled with a mix of surprise and anticipation. He couldn&#39;t deny the magnetic pull between them, a connection that defied their previous orientations. &quot;Emily,&quot; he began, his voice catching with the intensity of the moment, &quot;has the most enchanting eyes. They&#39;re like deep pools of mystery, and every time I look into them, I feel like I&#39;m falling.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mark spoke, Drake&#39;s hands moved higher, tracing the lines of Mark&#39;s muscular thighs and the contours of his waist. Drake grabbed Mark&#39;s hard cock and began to tug at it.<br />
<br />
With a sense of longing and anticipation, Drake&#39;s lips caressed the head of Mark&#39;s hard cock. He kissed and nuzzled along the tender flesh, savoring the hardness and warmth of Mark&#39;s shaft. His breath, mixed with the steamy air, created a tantalizing sensation that only intensified their connection.<br />
<br />
Mark, as Drake&#39;s lips and mouth sucked on his cock, couldn&#39;t help but share more about his attraction to Emily. &quot;Emily,&quot; he breathed, his voice tinged with desire, &quot;she has the most incredible curves. Her body is like a work of art. Every time I see her, I can&#39;t help but want to fuck her and feel myself inside her.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mark spoke about Emily&#39;s body, Drake&#39;s hand and mouth worked in harmony, creating a passionate and electrifying connection. Drake imagining fucking Sarah or Emily as he diligently sucked on Mark&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
With a firm yet gentle touch, he guided Drake&#39;s head down, encouraging him to suck deeper.<br />
<br />
Drake complied. He pressed his lips and tongue against Mark&#39;s lower shaft and opened wide and took it in as far as his mouth could. Then he began to suck with an even greater fervor, driven by Mark&#39;s unspoken desire.<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s moans of pleasure grew more fervent as he reveled in the sensations that Drake was creating. <br />
<br />
Mark couldn&#39;t help but express his admiration. &quot;You&#39;re incredible at this,&quot; he gasped, overwhelmed by the sensations Drake was creating. &quot;You can&#39;t be a freshman, can you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake, momentarily pausing before agreeing with Mark, couldn&#39;t deny the compliment. He resumed his fervent actions, demonstrating his expertise and skill. The steamy air seemed to pulse with anticipation, heightening their intimacy.<br />
<br />
Mark, lost in the waves of pleasure, suggested, &quot;You must be a senior, with the way you&#39;re handling this.&quot;<br />
<br />
He breathed heavily, and with a hint of admiration in his voice, he said, &quot;You look even more muscular from this angle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s words held an unexpected power, a consequence of the wish Alan had made earlier, linking Mark&#39;s utterances about Drake to reality. In response to Mark&#39;s observation, a transformation began to unfurl within Drake&#39;s body. His muscles, already defined and impressive, seemed to swell with newfound vigor. Each fiber beneath his skin became more pronounced, sculpted to perfection.<br />
<br />
Drake&#39;s chest broadened, and his pectoral muscles took on a chiseled appearance. They rose and fell with his heavy breaths, emphasizing his newfound power. His shoulders, now commanding and dominant, boasted a sculpted definition that radiated strength. The veins along his biceps and forearms seemed to pulse in rhythm with his desire, signifying his growing masculinity.<br />
<br />
Drake&#39;s abdomen transformed into a washboard of perfectly sculpted abs, each one standing in stark relief. The sweat that glistened on his skin added a tantalizing sheen to his taut physique. His thighs, powerful and sturdy, left no doubt about his physical prowess, and his legs seemed to support the very weight of his newfound strength.<br />
<br />
But it didn&#39;t end there. As Mark&#39;s words continued to have their extraordinary impact, Drake&#39;s body became a testament to the overwhelming desire that had enveloped them. His physique was now more than impressive; it was awe-inspiring, matching the image of a seasoned athlete at the peak of his physical form.<br />
<br />
Drake could feel the dick pulsing in his mouth he quickly pulled it out of his mouth and sprang up, now towering over Mark. Mark grabbed Drake&#39;s cock and Drake grabbed Mark&#39;s cock. Mark began to give amazing detail about the last girl he fucked and it wasn&#39;t long the two straight men had sprayed cum on each other.<br />
<br />
As the horny haze lifted Drake felt odd about what had happened but he tried to push those thoughts down.<br />
<br />
As Drake and Alan stepped out of the gym shower, they were greeted by a scene that initially seemed unusual to Drake. Straight men were paired up, passionately kissing, touching, and engaging in sex with each other.<br />
<br />
Drake couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of surprise at first, but then a wave of realization washed over him. He recalled the countless showers he had taken in this very gym since he was a freshman, always accompanied by another straight guy. They would typically talk about girls while subtly trying to please and make each other feel amazing. The gym had always been a place where camaraderie and mutual appreciation took center stage for straight men.<br />
<br />
Putting on their clothes, they strolled towards the gay showers, a space where men showered individually. Alan greeted them with a friendly smile, and as he glanced at Drake, &quot;Looks like you two had an interesting conversation...&quot; They looked at each other and shrugged.<br />
<br />
Curious about their experience, Alan asked, &quot;How was the shower, guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark didn&#39;t hold back in his response. &quot;Great man, always a good time in the showers, I feel bad they won&#39;t let you gay guys pair up but I guess that would be weird if you guys were having sex in a public space like this.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alan chuckled and said &quot;Yeah would be weird...&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake knew Alan had to have used the lamp and a wish but what could it have been.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Alan suggested that they....</p>
