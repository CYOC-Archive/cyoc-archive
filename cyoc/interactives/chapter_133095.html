<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As one improperly prepared young woman was feeling the wrath of the Goddess. All there watched as her clothing dissolved to a gray ash, and the ash clung then to her perspiring skin. As the ash soaked into her skin it caused the skin to become animal like tough hide, and started the growth of a dusty gray coloring of body fur.<br />
<br />
Marla stood there scared and embarrassed, she moaning her situation and had a real worry about what fate came with a changing physical form. She came there being a woman of twenty-two, but was cursed as she began regressing in attained age. As her age turned younger, her body grew smaller, arms became legs, as did human legs became as hind legs. <br />
<br />
Marla saw what she was starting to resemble, knowing what in Egyptian history was the lifestyle for a coarse featured doe goat. Fear and a proper sense of panic ensued, she looking up at the man who came there as her husband. Pleading bleats echoed the forest that night, as all there with the exception of one man changed into a elated Anthropoid-stallion, as did the others felt the sympathetic pains for a pretty woman changing, being turned into a rather large if ugly nanny goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, were you the husband to this despicable woman becoming a goat?&quot; Asked the Priestess of a man staring, he looking quite afraid that he might well join his wife&#39;s horrible fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Marla was my wife for seven years of marriage. Is she, as permanently to remain, stay a doe goat?&quot; The man asked, he acting meek, when speaking to the Priestess about his changed wife.<br />
<br />
Marla felt her body changing, gaining new internal organs, she sad most about the losing of her perky, womanly breasts turned into a crude goaty udder, with fat teats. Her changed body was undeniable that of an animal, and she took to acting and taking a more modest mannered approach to her lifestyle and future. Nervousness exited her mouth not as pleading words but squeaky bleated cries. Her attained knowledge about the Goddess Bast made her worry if she were transported to the Egypt of the past and placed as a doe goat on a farm. Her concerns about the Goddess included a wonderment if she was to remain in her times, would she always be a female goat?<br />
<br />
The Priestess ignored the bleating goat, as she turned to face a worried man. &quot;Obviously you are worried about your foolhardy wife. The Goddess Bast acted more than kind when deciding to changing Marla of form to being a doe goat. If you wish to remain close to her, feeling marital affections still, I am sure if I were to make a pleading request, you could join her fate,  becoming as well a Goat, you then a herd sire buck-male goat!&quot; The Priestess so offered the scared man, as her offer caused him to gasp at the prospect of becoming a buck goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I came here with my believer wife, she a follower of your Goddess.&quot; He said, as adding more words of his concerns he said, &quot;My beliefs have changed, and if allowed, I would prefer to withdraw, as leave, and forget all about she who was my wife!&quot; <br />
<br />
What the young man said tended to disturb the doe goat, she began then bleating more frantic like. The goat then urinated due to her feeling frustrated, as did popped out her wiggling rump, she dropped several brown turds. <br />
<br />
An ex-husband then knelt down on one knee, as with his hands he cupped the bearded chin of his dear wife after she became a doe goat. &quot;I am sorry for you and of your predicament Dearest, but the worshiping of this Goddess was your religion, and not mine!  I hope that where you end up needing to live your life, you become contented, maybe happy. Ah, ha, I have heard that buck goats are always horny, wanting to mate, and you dear, you were one horny wife. Once a night was never enough for a night, you wanting sex all night!&quot;<br />
<br />
The hooded Priestess stepped away from the man. He had his goatish wife fawning on him, she bleating, trying hard to convey her feelings, but quite incapable to speaking nary a word of English. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me please, ah can I address you simply as Priestess?  OK, then yes, ah Priestess, you have the power and I am but an unworthy servant!  If allowed that because of Marla I could leave here, would you let me take Marla with me? I would keep her as more a pet, maybe milking her, since she has lost all favor in the eyes of her Goddess!&quot; A worried man thought to ask as keep his changed wife from becoming meat on an Egyptian table.<br />
<br />
The Priestess heard the questions and as she stood there, her eyes closed and she began to meditate.<br />
<br />
As then the Priestess eyes did open, she said, &quot;You young sir may have, take ownership of the goat. The Goddess was not pleased that you came here as a non-believer. Although you say you have changed your mind about believing, our Goddess feels it is a necessity for you to wear you beliefs, but in private.&quot; That said and the Priestess stepped up snugly close to the man, her hands cupping his pants front, she doing magic to his genitals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what is this?&quot; Yelled the young man at the Priestess.<br />
<br />
&quot;You say you loved your wife even though she was very horny for sex. She being now a goat, a man cannot have sex with her small vulva, therefore, you maleness I changed to being that of a buck goat. I gifted you with increased length to compensate for the decrease of girth. Your scrotum as it is called, is now furry and the genitals are similar in size to Kiwi fruits. You are almost as an insatiable male. As once a night was never enough for your Marla, now that she is a goat and you gifted of goat genitals, no more than five times any night, or expect come in the morning you discover additional goat fur and looking more each dared lusty night to become a buck goat.&quot; The Priestess warned, &quot;Now take her and go home!&quot;</p>
