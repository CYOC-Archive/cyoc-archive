<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jesse curiously looked at the Chronivac screen and began to wonder exactly how far she could go with swapping things from the eroge visual novel to real life. There was genuinely a lot she could swap. She could swap herself, swap her teachers, swap her friends, there was all sorts of things she could swap. Her mind wandered towards the setting of boobilicious babes, and the setting the visual novel follows. Whilst never having played the thing itself, Jeff had watched videos of the visual novel, as well as read descriptions about the plot that she could find before she swapped her former sister. While most of the setting was in service of the actual porn, there was some uniqueness to it.<br />
<br />
The setting of Boobilicious babes has the exact same history as regular history, until 1926 where the birth rate of men drastically began to decrease until it was 5% of the current rate, while the inverse happened for women. The same number of births occurred, just that the ratio of men to women was vastly lower than what it should be.  While this shift happened, human evolution also took a drastic turn as both men and women were affected by a weird genetic shift. For men, they became overall physically smaller and weaker except in their penis and testicles which became more virile and able to ejaculate into multiple women in quick succession, as well as just getting larger than before. They actually look similar to Jesse in this regard. As for women, the genetic shift was vastly different for them.<br />
<br />
Women&#39;s bodies developed in a way to be more visually attractive and fertile to the male gaze. Their bodies looked more slim and sexy, while their asses and breasts became larger on average, with it not being too strange for women to have H cup breasts when they leave middle school. Despite their new frames, women haven&#39;t got any weaker, and in fact, quite the opposite. Women are now far stronger than ever before, and women even develop special abilities when they reach high school, which take the form of &#39;super powers&#39;. These powers give women the ability to fly, control fire or water, as well as numerous other things. Women usually develop some kind of affinity for one particular power, but can perform others with training which is done in high school as high school now is for women to develop their strength, as well as teaching them the importance of reproduction. <br />
<br />
Speaking of reproduction, that is what society primarily wants first and foremost and school is where this is reinforced. While school still teaches important lessons like Math and English, they will also have appropriate &#39;sex education&#39; classes that are given separately to men and women. Reproductive biology is taught in these classes, as well as methods to sexually satisfy oneself and your partner. For women, it&#39;s various ways to use different body parts to achieve an orgasm, as well as fashion to illicit sexual responses. For men, it&#39;s a lot more basic. By high school however, Men do not get sent to high school under usual circumstances as they don&#39;t develop super powers and they aren&#39;t expected to get degrees or academic records as once a man marries, their wive(s) provide for him. Most men will spend the next two years enjoying themselves before finding a wife.<br />
<br />
Speaking of marriage and wives, marriage is not strictly monogamous. Harems will form which is normal and completely expected, with a &#39;head wife&#39; usually being the leader of the harem as the husband will be too busy mating and fucking. The husband of the harem will typically live in the head wife&#39;s home while the secondary wives will come over and mate with the husband. While the wives may not like each other, all of them will be devoted to taking care of the husband. The husband will still have autonomy, and still cares for their family despite the position they are in. <br />
<br />
As for the protagonist of the eroge, he is a guy that ends up getting to stay at special university for really gifted women due to his mother being the principal of the university. Given he is unmarried, his mother sees attending the university as a way of finding wives to bear offspring with, which in the true ending, turns out to be every woman in the university, students and faculty, being his wives.<br />
<br />
After reading through the setting of the eroge, Jesse saw potential in the setting of Boobilicious babes. What if, as a truly interesting swap, she swapped the boobilicious universe with the current universe. With her dick erect, and her mind racing, she set up the chronivac to swap the universe with that the setting of Boobilicious babes and hit enter on the keyboard. After hitting enter, she looked around and already felt something was off. <br />
<br />
Physically, she didn&#39;t feel different but looking around the room, things certainly were. Everywhere Jesse looked, there was this glossy shine to what she was looking at, it was like she was watching a scene in an anime or hentai except it was her actual vision. That wasn&#39;t the only thing she noticed as all around her room, all the posters and things that featured real people on them had changed. Any poster that had women on them had their bodies altered to match the overly exaggerated bodies of the characters in boobilicious babes, it was like the real life person became a character in that visual novel, hell, they even looked like the art style of that visual novel. anything in Jesse&#39;s room that had men on it either got replaced by a busty female equivalent of themselves, or a more androgynous look to them. <br />
<br />
Trudging over to the mirror, Jesse looked at herself and took note of a lot of things. If someone were to describe her androgynous male body, it would be the same as she was back in real life except one key difference. They way she looked, didn&#39;t look like someone from real life. Her whole body looked exactly like the art style of the characters in boobilicious babes, except she wasn&#39;t an illustration, she was a living breath person that happened to have big anime eyes and glossy skin. Looking outside, everyone had the same glossy anime look Jesse did, although the ratio of men to women was now hugely different. As Jesse took further notice of the people outside, he spotted somethings. <br />
<br />
His neighbours had the bodies of them women in boobilicious babes, although they were still clearly the same person from before. Hannah, the 19 year old daughter of Jesse&#39;s neighbour Megan, had the same green sports bra and yoga pants she wore on her usual jog, except they now tried to contain what could be seen as M cup breasts. Jesse knew it was Hannah, based on the green eyes and short brown hair, but she now looked like she belonged in an eroge. Whilst Jesse was staring out of the window, a knock at her door brought her out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesse, Mom and I are going to the store. We won&#39;t be long.&quot; Sayaka&#39;s voice rung through the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok sis.&quot; Jesse muttered back. <br />
<br />
Curious, Jesse waited to see her mother and sister leave through the front door and watched them walk down the drive way. Seeing Sayaka and Hilda, they looked just like 3D versions of how they looked in the visual novel originally. <br />
<br />
&quot;That, really interesting.&quot; Jesse wondered to herself, considering what to do next.</p>
