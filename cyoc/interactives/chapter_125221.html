<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I awoke to find the space next to me vacant.  My member stirred as I recalled the events of last night.  I felt the smooth fabric of the slip and panties I was still wearing, and that made me perk up even more.  My dick and the sheets next to me were still crusty with old cum.<br />
<br />
I sat up in bed and looked around.  Morning light was peeking through the curtains.  Lisette was no where to be found.  On the chair nearby the bed was some clothes and a note.  I rolled out of bed and stumbled over to look at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Master Joe,&quot; it read.  &quot;This one chose some clothing for Master from those he had brought here.  This one shamefully took the liberty of adding an item from her own collection in a vain hope to meet her Master&#39;s utmost approval.  It is a bra of size AA, from when this one was first starting her feminine journey and her breasts were still unfortunately very small.  As Master Joe seems to have begun a new feminine journey as well, this one sincerely hopes it will be of use.  In the event that the Master disapproves of this one&#39;s over-bold action, this servant begs Master Joe to punish and correct her at Master&#39;s earliest convenience.<br />
<br />
The faithful maid-servant, Lisette.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at the pile of clothing.  There were my black cargo pants and navy blue. short-sleeved, button-down shirt--clothes that would be pretty normal for me on a day off.  There were also sheer, lilac-colored, bikini-cut panties with rose-pink lacy trim, and a black lacy bra that looked like it was big enough to wrap around my chest, but with cups so small they would barely contain anything--which was fine, as I didn&#39;t have anything to contain.<br />
<br />
Despite the self-admonition in the letter, I was appreciative to Lisette for including it.  I had already been wearing panties, and a bra seemed like the obvious next step.  I went to the adjacent bathroom and did my business.  I saw that Lisette had apparently brought my toiletries in here as well.  I used them and did my morning routine, adding cleaning my dick as well.  I then went back into the bedroom and stripped off my slip and old panties, placing them in the hamper.  With only a little apprehension I approached the chair with the clothes.<br />
<br />
I pulled the panties up my legs and to my crotch.  They felt soooo good.  Then I took the bra.  It took several minutes of work for me to figure out what strap went wear, and fastening it was a whole new challenge.  Finally I got it on and in place.  <br />
<br />
There was a slight bit of padding, and the bra pushed my pecs upward and inward a little bit.  It was only able to give my small chest a tiny bit of cleavage in the middle that would never be enough to be visible.  The padding gave me just enough definition that if I was wearing a very tight shirt one might think I had small breasts.  The shirt I had now was pretty loose, however, so the bra would not be noticeable.  That was fine with me for now.<br />
<br />
I put my male clothes on over the feminine underwear.  My socks and tennis shoes were nearby as well, so I put them on too.  With that, I headed out of the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Looking around downstairs, I didn&#39;t see Lisette or my mother anywhere.  I found Tabitha in the breakfast nook, munching on some toast and fruit.  She greeted me with a smile and a &quot;Good morning, Joe!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, babe!  Sleep well?&quot; I returned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure did,&quot; she replied.  &quot;Your mom and Lisette had to go out early,&quot; she added.  &quot;But Lisette left some things for us for breakfast in the kitchen.  Go and get some and come back, I want to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
My heart got a bad feeling, like anyone&#39;s does when their girlfriend says &quot;I want to talk.&quot;  Nevertheless I went into the kitchen and found on the island various breakfast breads, fruits, and condiments laid out neatly, with plates and utensils on the side.  I picked up some berries and melon pieces, and a bagel with cream cheese, then headed back to talk with Tabitha.<br />
<br />
I sat down and said &quot;So... what&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
She had a terrified look on her face, and after several false starts, she said &quot;Joe... I uh... I love you more than anything... but um... I made a big mistake...&quot; there were tears in her eyes.  I waited with dread for her to continue.  &quot;...I... uh... ...I slept with your mom last night...&quot;<br />
<br />
If this was just the week prior I&#39;d have been freaking out, but with all that had recently happened, I felt nothing but relief.  She had broken down crying and was hurriedly adding &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to cheat on you Joe; it just happened.  You have to know I love you and only you...&quot;<br />
<br />
I put my hand up and smiled gently.  &quot;Tabitha... it&#39;s okay.  I&#39;m not mad at all.  I understand... our life, this life, my parents how they are now... there&#39;s been so many changes.  For some reason, it doesn&#39;t bother me at all that you slept with my mom... in fact it&#39;s kind of hot....&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at me disbelieving.  Before she could answer I added &quot;But I do have my own confession: last night I slept with Lisette...&quot;<br />
<br />
A range of emotions appeared on Tabitha&#39;s face, one after another.  Anger, disgust, confusion, relief... and then she burst out laughing.  After a short moment she composed herself and said &quot;For a moment I was so angry with you, but I can&#39;t be angry, not at all.  You&#39;re right, Joe, everything has changed.  And for whatever reason, I&#39;m not mad at you either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s settled then,&quot; I said.  &quot;My parents, when they first started out like this, agreed that sex with other people was okay, as long as each other took priority, and as long as they only loved each other most of all.  Maybe we should make the same agreement,&quot; I proposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you keep using that ring the way you have been, it will probably go that way one way or another,&quot; Tabitha responded, &quot;but I think that we should make that agreement now and preserve our love for each other.  I agree.&quot;  She paused, then said &quot;Use the ring to make it infallible.&quot;<br />
<br />
I made the wish: &quot;I wish that Tabitha and I will not be jealous of or have any problem with each other having sex with other people, as long as it is consensual and adds to our happiness.  And I wish that we will always love each other most of all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s done then,&quot; said Tabitha.  She smiled broadly, then kissed me.  She broke it off and said &quot;So tell me about last night!&quot;<br />
<br />
I launched into an explanation of the talk I&#39;d had with Lisette, and then described our intimacy later.  I ended with the letter and told Tabitha about the bra, unbuttoning my shirt to show her as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Joe that&#39;s great!&quot; she said.  &quot;I&#39;m so happy you and Lisette are so close!  And I&#39;m glad she&#39;s agreed to help you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you and my mom?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was getting ready for bed in the girl cave when your mom came and knocked.  She was wearing lingerie, but given her new personality I didn&#39;t think that was weird.  She probably always sleeps in sexy lingerie.  Anyway she asked me a little bit about our relationship.  I think she wanted to see if I was right for you.  It was while we were talking about that that I slipped up... I accidentally mentioned your... fetish.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was taken aback, but regained composure as she continued.  &quot;She asked me a bit about that, and the cat was out of the bag, so I told her we were just starting out with it.  I told her how happy I was that you were pursuing your dream and how I wanted to help you.  After that she seemed really pleased with me, and she hugged me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At this point I&#39;d been looking at her so long that her body was really turning me on.  And the talk about you and your femininity was turning me on too.  The touch was just too much for me and I kissed her.  She kissed me back and we made out for a bit.  She took me to her room and we had sex on the bed.  I&#39;d never had lesbian sex before but I&#39;d been curious for a long time.  It&#39;s one of the reasons I&#39;m so okay with what you&#39;re doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And let me tell you, lesbian sex is amazing!  It only makes me happier that you&#39;re trying to be more feminine.  I think it will be really good for both of us.  ...Anyway we fingered each other and ate each other out a lot.  We didn&#39;t stop at one orgasm and kept going for at least an hour.  After we got tired she offered me something to wear to bed but I just wanted to stay naked.  She decided to as well and we cuddled, naked, all night long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like our nights were pretty similar, then,&quot; I said as she finished.  &quot;I&#39;m glad you enjoyed yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; she said.  &quot;But I&#39;ve still got plenty of love for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
We started making out there in the breakfast nook.  After a few moments she pulled my pants down and wrested my raging member from within my panties.  She went down on me, sucking, but I was so horny that I came after less than a minute.  She swallowed every bit.  I returned the favor, reaching under her skirt and pulling her panties down.  I ate her out until she came, which took a lot longer than it did for me.<br />
<br />
We then went to the bathroom, cleaned ourselves up and put our clothes back on.  Tabitha had to get to class.  &quot;What are you going to do with your day off, Joe?&quot; she asked me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hadn&#39;t decided, but I&#39;d like to use this ring some more,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;That ring has made some people very happy, even if it is a more raunchy, sex-driven happiness,&quot; she said.  &quot;Us, your parents, the neighbors, our old landlords, some of those folks in the park.  You might have changed them, but they, and we, are all happier for it.  If you want to help other people with that ring, I think it would be wonderful, and I love you for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that we exchanged kisses, and she grabbed her purse and headed out the door.</p>
