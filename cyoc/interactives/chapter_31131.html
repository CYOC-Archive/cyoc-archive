<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">CAUTION TO THE FAINT OF HEART: (This a rather Adulterous chapter)<br />
<br />
<br />
Even a sex wild billy buck goat can tire of what a Satyress has and can offer him; so this happened to Lionel first.<br />
<br />
Bess was the prime conquest for Lionel, she being her color and he his in human existence and then as well after infected. He felt a need to try and dominate her, as if she in some odd way stood for something of a great wrong. She felt for Lionel the way she did only after her becoming a Satyress stirred her to want for anything male in gender. She had no care of whether a male were man or animal, nor as of what breed it were, just as long as if came with a shaft to tickle, tantalize and thrill her more sensual self.<br />
<br />
This being easy for those of the male gender, tended to turn Lionel to wanting someone with a little more pizazz. Lionel in his lusty goat form had his shaft, and from much use of it the thing gained in length and girth. This gain made the conquest of Bess rather dull, her limited depths he could attain with only half his male length; leaving the rest to feel the chilly air.<br />
<br />
Lionel, like all those of the human kind what for more of everything, as if the having of more toys means something on the day they die.<br />
<br />
Dave seemed to gain this same understanding, and looked to Lionel, following him around, and mimicking his champion in every way.<br />
<br />
Francine, Beth, and the growing numbers in a herd of Satyress creatures went on to infect those they knew and felt cherished thoughts. Like what happened to the males they met, more would end up as crude thinking buck goats. Some, those who were not really male and wanting to remain as such; the Satyress had their tricks, and when approached, if they did enjoy things with an oral flavor, they then became a Satyress too!<br />
<br />
It was Lionel and his need for enjoying a real conquest before he might try and dominate his chosen females that bade him to turn from the herd and wander independently.<br />
<br />
Dave saw Lionel wander away, and felt some sense of favor toward the black goat. Lionel by his coming into being a buck goat early on, was by that time matured, grown quite large, standing as tall as would a stallion pony.<br />
<br />
If big and bigger is better, Lionel had everything he could ever get by being a male buck Billy goat. Dave saw this natural assertion of Lionel, as if pride and admiration of his self seemed to cast over Dave as sense of longing, wishing to remain along side of one who was then great.<br />
<br />
Alfred, a chum from school came to mind in Lionel and his kinky twisted sex lusting mind.<br />
<br />
Alfred was like Lionel, at least in his original coloring, if being not quite of smart and seeing things with depth, he tended to act and react quickly, turning violent at the least unkind word. As if hunting prey the two goats teamed together to seek and search out after those they or mostly Lionel wanted to infect by forcing past friends to pleasure him and he or Dave then giving off a life changing squirt.<br />
<br />
Standing halfway down the block from where he lived, and called home, Al watched passing cars, waving at some, or occasionally granting those in cars a possible accounting of his general penis length.<br />
<br />
It was Dave that did the deed first, charging at Al from the cover of a nearby hedge. The clatter of cloven hoofs coming in contact with concrete did turn Al to look just before two horns and a hardened goat skull whammed him in the knees.<br />
<br />
Al fell backwards, off the curb and lay then with his head and torso in the busy street, as if a target for any gruff minded truck driver.<br />
<br />
Anger flared and flashed in Al, he feeling pain and nearly getting killed, wanted to lash out and do physical harm to this stout brown colored male goat.<br />
<br />
Dave wheeled around on his nimble cloven trotters, charging off into the safety of the hedge.<br />
<br />
Lionel watched and waited as Dave led Alfred to his sensual doom. The angered and infuriated young man did take to chasing Dave, and cursing the beast for giving pain and the indignity he felt when fallen in the roadway; Alfred wanted for some just revenge!<br />
<br />
Following Dave, as Al charged under the bows of the spreading hedge of Honeysuckle, a larger goat rammed forward, slamming Al in the groin and dropping the prey to his knees.<br />
<br />
A wave of guttural pain consumed Alfred, he fell to his knees and began to curse and cuss at his attacker. Mouth opened and working a blaze if angered words, this was the target for Lionel to make the insertion and then infect another into his own herd.<br />
<br />
Grumbling mass of words tried to say how Al felt at that moment, only midstream of his planned sayings had this large goat accost Al. Lionel fawned over Al and his shoulders with forelegs and cloven hoofs. He held his prey from trying to stand up and or get away. This stunned Al, he became in awe of the sudden situation and before he could turn away, a pointed end of one hot, oily, reddish pink billy goat shaft did penetrate inside his mouth, to tickle the uvula at the head of his throat.   <br />
<br />
Dave rushed forward and with his smaller mouth did lip tickle in the groin of Al.<br />
<br />
Stunned and at the brute mercy of his attackers, Al found himself orally raped and then tasted the infecting semen given from the huge balls of what Lionel had as his heritage and personal pleasure.<br />
<br />
Billy goats never do their thing just once and walk off, but come back to the nanny again and more than once; so then did Lionel stand and let flow seven more hearty squirts of his life changing fluid.</p>
