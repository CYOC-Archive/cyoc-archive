<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike grins, “I think I’ll try the program on both of my lazy son’s,” he says to himself, “make them more… useful. And I know just what their true purpose of existence should be, I always wanted a cool motorcycle, I think Jeff will make a fine motorcycle, and Tyrone will make a cool motorcycle outfit!”<br />
<br />
The 45-year-old gets to work, first scanning Tyrone, then opens the transformation tab, selecting “vehicles”, then “motorcycles”, scrolling through the various models, the man finally settles on the perfect bike: a blue Yamaha! Grinning to himself, Mike selects the motorcycle and “connects” it to Jeff’s file, he then causes Jeff to be unable to speak, but able to hear, see and feel everything. To prevent Jeff from accessing the Chronivac, which would be added to his on board computer, Mike sets it so it’s mainly just a connection without having any real function, causing only the program on Jeff’s computer to be, for now at least, the only way for Jeff and Tyrone to ever revert back to normal. Mike also sets the transformation to be permanent, and activates the reality alteration, so that after both boys have transformed, they’ll simply cease to exist, only Mike will remember them as humans.<br />
<br />
After setting up Jeff’s transformation, Mike saves the settings and opens the transformation tab once again, this time he selects the category “clothing”, scrolling through the list until he finds “motorcycle gear”, the man then chooses a one piece thick leather jumpsuit, gloves, boots and helmet in the same coloring as the “bike”. He then connects the “outfit” to Tyrone’s file, choosing which part of the 12-year-old should become what:<br />
<br />
- Head -> helmet<br />
- Body -> jumpsuit<br />
- Hands -> gloves<br />
- Feet-> boots<br />
<br />
He then sets the right size, so that the outfit will fit him, he then causes Tyrone, like Jeff, to be able to see, hear and feel everything, but will be unable to do anything about his situation. Satisfied, the man confirms both transformations, and minimizes the program, opening the browser and his emails and begins typing the reply to the important email, as if everything is normal, while he waits for his bike and new outfit to be “made”.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the dining room, Jeff suddenly feels a familiar tingling run through his body, “hu? I didn’t program any transformation… have I,” he asks himself, before his body suddenly begins to move on its own.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels himself getting to his feet and his eyes widen when he feels his arms move on their own, starting to take off his clothes, “what the hell is going on,” he asks, panic raising in him, “I… my body isn’t obeying me!”<br />
<br />
Once naked, the teen walks, against his will, towards the door which leads to the garage, Jeff tries with all his willpower to stop himself, but it seems useless, he can only watch in panic and confusion as his hand opens the door and his body walking into the cold garage. Jeff walks into the center of the garage, his body then slowly forces him onto his hands and knees, “what is going on,” he asks himself, his eyes widen in horror, then his face contorts into anger, “DAD! YOU BASTARD,” he yells, “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!? STOP THIS IMMEDIATELY,” Mike, however doesn’t hear him.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels his body then begin to change, first, his skin starts feeling hard and metallic, he then feels his feet and hands merge together and starting to swell, while the skin turns black and rubbery. The teen’s eyes widen as he stares at his hands, “a motorcycle,” he exclaims, “I am becoming a fucking motorcycle?!”<br />
<br />
The 16-year-old groans as his body and organs continue to change, his face pushes forward, his ears lengthen, becoming the handlebars with mirrors attached to them, his eyes become the front lights. He then feels his scull flatten and his brain becoming the controls and dashboard, while his forehead becomes the windshield. His butt merges and becomes the leather seat, while his back and chest become the tank and body, keeping the engine, which once was his heart, and all the other components safe and secure. Jeff feels his cock and balls simply fall off, wincing mentally, his voice long faded, when they hit the concrete floor of the garage, clattering as they become the keys, soon a brand new blue Yamaha motorcycle is standing in the spot where just moments ago a naked 16-year-old human had been kneeling on all fours.<br />
<br />
While Jeff is going through hell, unaware to him, his 12-year-old brother Tyrone is panicking himself, the boy suddenly found himself unable to move, watching in horror as his body changes, his feet, hands and head just simply disconnect from his body, which grows and deflates as it changes color and texture. Tyrone can feel his hands, feet and head grow a little themselves, ‘what is happening to me,’ the boy thinks to himself, ‘I… I feel weird, like… like a motorcycle outfit. What… what does this mean? Is it a dream? It feels so real though,’ soon the 12-year-old is replaced by a brand new motorcycle outfit. A few minutes later, the door to his room opens and Tyrone sees his dad enter, “dad! Thank god, y-you gotta help me,” Tyrone tries to say, but finds that he is unable to talk.<br />
<br />
Mike grins wide as he sees the outfit lying on his younger son’s bed, “I must say, Tyrone,” he says, “you’ve turned out perfect! You’ll make a fine motorcycle outfit, you’ll be defiantly more useful to me now than you were as a human! HAHA! Let’s try you on, shall we?”<br />
<br />
Tyrone is stunned, what has gotten into his dad? The 12-year-old begins to sob mentally, begging his dad to cut the crap, but it’s no use, the former boy can only watch in horror as his dad begins to strip out of his clothes.</p>
