<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke2Lucien <br />
<br />
Luke fell into a very deep sleep.  His body began to sweat profusely.  Then he began to shake, almost as if he were having a seizure.    Minutes ticked by in the darkness.  He began to whimper and whine as if he wanted to cry out, but no sound would come out.  He clutched the sheets and twisted them as though he were in pain.   Then it was all over.  Something woke him, but he didn&#39;t know what; something just didn&#39;t seem right.   <br />
<br />
He fought to remember the dream he was having but no, it was a nightmare.  He was running, being chased.  Someone was beating him ferociously, no one was helping.  People were watching.    His body still ached as though it really had happened.  It dawned on him that he was sweating like a pig.  Maybe a fever?  A server cold?  He panicked, college students were always coming down with meningitis.  No, he&#39;d had his shot...  <br />
<br />
The fear factor raised 100%.  The door to his bedroom began to creak open.  Whoever it was, was a good burglar: he hadn&#39;t made a sound until now.  The light from the hallway back-lit the prowler.  Luke couldn&#39;t  see anything but an outline of the guy.  From what he could make out, he wasn&#39;t very brawny like you&#39;d think he should be.  In fact the guy was pretty much tall and lanky like Luke himself.  In fact he wasn&#39;t much of a burglar at all.  As the guy came into the room, his jacket just slid off onto the floor and the guy didn&#39;t take the time to unbutton his shirt, he just pulled it off over his head and stepped out of his pants.  <br />
<br />
The thing was, the guy had only taken a step or two into the room and he was just about naked.  He had moved far enough from the door that Luke could begin to make out some of his features.  The burglar seemed to be lit up with a blacklight.  Luke swallowed hard as he watched the guy just practically jump out of his briefs, leaving only socks on his feet.  <br />
<br />
It never occurred to Luke that the guy could see that he was laying there watching.  After all, his eyes were open and the light from the hall was like a spotlight.  He didn&#39;t appear to have a knife or a gun or anything other than a raging hard-on.   The instant that he thought that thought, he realized his own dick was sporting some major wood itself.  His balls were churning at the thought of this naked guy in his room, alone with him, in the night.  Luke was paralyzed with fright and excitement when the guy lifted up the blanket and crawled in right next to him and put his arms around him, kissing his neck.  “Sorry Luce … I didn&#39;t mean to wake you ...”<br />
<br />
All Luke could do was lay there in his arms and nervously giggle.  <br />
<br />
“... mmm, salty …”  <br />
<br />
It took a few minutes for Luke to make out that this guy had been using his tongue to play with Luke&#39;s ear.  <br />
<br />
He suddenly stopped and sat up in bed, “Lucien … you&#39;re hot.  Not your normal sexy hot I mean.  Are you okay?”<br />
<br />
Before Luke could even think of trying to speak, the guy had flipped on the bedside lamp and pulled back the covers.  The sudden light blinded him but he was getting ready to stammer out a response when his eyes locked on a photo by the bed. It was this guy with a very dark skinned black man, standing there side by side in the light of day, in front of the whole world with the sun shining down on them.  <br />
<br />
As his eyes adjusted, it was only then that he looked down at his own exposed flesh … his skin was the colour as that of the guy in the photo right next to this redhead.  Only this guy in bed next to him didn&#39;t have a grin and he wasn&#39;t blushing.  This guy&#39;s skin was milky white and pale, his eyes were dancing with fire.<br />
<br />
“Can you talk?  Are you okay? I&#39;m calling Jed!”  <br />
<br />
Before Luke could even speak, the guy had jumped off the bed, retrieved his cellphone from his pants and speed dialed, probably this Jed person.  <br />
<br />
“Jed?  Boyd.  I just got home and Lucien was sweating like a pig.  He can&#39;t speak … I&#39;m not sure … wait ...”  <br />
<br />
Luke tried to push himself up, “No, don&#39;t call him.  I&#39;m okay … I mean ...”  He couldn&#39;t find it in himself to ask this guy who he was: his voice didn&#39;t sound like the voice he knew as his, bouncing around inside his head.<br />
<br />
“Right.  See you in a few.”  In one fluid motion, Boyd tossed his cellphone on the chair and grabbed a nylon bathroom from who knows where, at the same time a very dangerous finger pointed right into Luke&#39;s face, “Don&#39;t give me that, bitch.  You&#39;re NOT okay … he&#39;ll be here ...”<br />
<br />
A knock on the door stopped what seemed to be a tirade building up steam.  <br />
<br />
Luke was completely confused.  Why would a rapist/burglar call for backup?  Only cops did that.  This just had to be another dream.  He was just having another dream.  That had to be it.  A dream.  At least he wasn&#39;t getting the shit beaten out of him in this one.  <br />
<br />
A really cute, handsome African American came into the room – it had to be the doctor because he had a medical bag with him.  Right behind him came some sort of muscled up Asian man.  The doctor sat on the edge of the bed and took Luke&#39;s hand, “You can talk now?”<br />
<br />
Luke nodded.<br />
<br />
The Asian piped, up, “We need to hear your voice, bitch.  Say something ...”  The angry look on his face scared Luke for a second.  Luke&#39;s words got caught in his throat.  He managed to croak out, “I … I … -ahem- … can talk ...”  He looked up at the Asian who looked a little less angry.  Boyd was whispering something in his ear.  There was no point in trying to listen, this was just a dream anyways.  When he looked down, the doctor was listening to his heart.  He jerked when he felt something and saw the Asian checking his blood pressure.  <br />
<br />
“Calm down baby, I only bite when you ask real nice like ...”<br />
<br />
There was silence as the two wrote down on a pad they passed back and forth.  Then Luke jerked again when he realized the doctor was sitting next to him again, holding his hand.<br />
<br />
“Can you tell us what happened?  Did you feel it coming on?” <br />
<br />
Luke was dumbfounded.  He couldn&#39;t tell them that this was all a dream and didn&#39;t matter.  Getting locked up in a psych ward would just be another nightmare.  He&#39;d just play along, sooner or later he had to wake up.  “I&#39;m okay.  I just felt tired and laid down.  I had a nightmare.  That&#39;s all.”<br />
<br />
The Asian seemed to relax a little. Luke was searching their faces for a clue as to what to do next.  <br />
<br />
“Can you remember any of it?”  <br />
<br />
“ … naw … not much … there was a bunch of running and I remember getting one ass whopping deluxe … thaz about it ...”  He paused and started up again, “Thatz when Boyd came home and started getting all romantic like ...”<br />
<br />
Trying to hold back a laugh, the Asian guy snorted and put his hand over his mouth.  His sober expression returned, “We&#39;re going to get you cleaned up.  No funny business with my husband in the next room ...”<br />
<br />
Boyd blurted out, “... with &#39;your&#39; husband … bitch ...”<br />
<br />
  Luke was in no shape to argue.  The Asian was already helping him stand up and maneuvering him towards the bathroom.  The door was deliberately closed behind them; he could hear the voices of Boyd and the doctor.  The shower was spraying and Luke watched the guy adjust the temp.  He watched his nurse roll up his sleeves and get the soap, washcloth and towel ready.  At any rate, he wasn&#39;t going to argue with this muscleman.  In other circumstances, if this hadn&#39;t been a dream, he&#39;d put the moves on him.<br />
<br />
Luke wasn&#39;t sure about anything.  He&#39;d caught his reflection in the mirror above the sink before the steam clouded it over.  In this dream he was definitely that black guy in the photo.  When his pajamas were off and tossed in the hamper, there was no denying that is was 100% African American.  At least  in his case, the myth was true.  His prick hung down almost to his knees and his balls were the size of softballs.     <br />
<br />
What really startled him wasn&#39;t the fact that he now had inky black skin, it was his now uncircumcised phallus.  He had only ever seen photos of guys who still had their foreskins, now he had one.  Carefully he began to pull back the hood …<br />
<br />
Rikki raised his voice slightly, “We&#39;re not in here for you to wank.  You need to get cleaned up.  The shower should help to bring down your temperature and you stink.  A little soap wouldn&#39;t offend your husband, I wouldn&#39;t think.”<br />
<br />
Luke cringed thinking about the kiss that guy had already given him.  They were married?  Husband?  He was married now and he was black and he&#39;d married a white guy?  His mind was going numb.  He stepped into the stall and completely forgot he was being watched.  Instinctively he grabbed the shampoo and began to massage his hair.  The process seemed alien, his hair just wasn&#39;t like it was before.  He reached for the big sponge that was on the tray and soaped it down, beginning to wash himself.  He stopped in mid-stroke when he got to his nipples.  He couldn&#39;t believe how much blacker they were than his coal-black skin.  They seemed bigger, pointier than anything he&#39;d ever seen.  They jutted out from his chest obscenely.  There was no playing with them when he was reminded of Rikki standing behind him.  His nurse had cleared his throat, unapprovingly.  He turned his back so that the stream would hit his back, but he found it hard to get his arms to do any serious scrubbing back there.  Rikki stepped in and grabbed the sponge.  There was no protest on Luke&#39;s part.  Nor was their any sexual connotation in this circumstance: his nurse was all business.  Dang.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until he felt the sponge begin rubbing away at his derriere that he realized the size and shape of his glutes.   His mind told him that he now had a ghetto booty.  He would have turned to look, but a phrase he didn&#39;t remember hearing before floated across his consciousness: ass for days.  It wasn&#39;t just a cute bubble butt.  <br />
<br />
He was brought back to the moment with Rikki nudging him to take back the sponge and finish cleaning.  The silent words hung in the air:  I&#39;m not here to play with your ass.    And true to his word, Rikki wasn&#39;t there to watch him play with himself.  Still, he managed to clean himself thoroughly down there.  He even managed to take a minute or two, just to be sure his crack was clean.<br />
<br />
He marveled at the thickness of his thighs.  He didn&#39;t remember them being so muscular.  Once done, he went to step out of the shower and found Rikki there standing with a huge bath towel.  There was a moment when he thought he saw the slighted smirk on Rikki&#39;s face, but if it had been there, it was gone now.  Without even thinking about it, he grabbed up his toothbrush and stopped again.  Confronted with his reflection, he noticed how much bigger and wider his teeth seemed to be.   He couldn&#39;t believe his lips, they were so big and puffy.  He poked one and stopped. Aware of his watcher, he quickly squeezed out his toothpaste and got down to business.  He wondered how he knew that the new purple toothbrush was his … things seemed to be all different in this bathroom, yet everything seemed to be hauntingly familiar.  <br />
<br />
Rikki dropped the toilet seat and pointed.  Luke knew better than to argue.  As the thermometer came floating towards his mouth, he said nothing and accepted his fate .  He felt the sygmoidoscope tighten on his arm.  His nurse was doing his job.  <br />
<br />
As they emerged, Luke saw the sheets had been changed.  That Jed doctor-person was sitting on a chair by the bed and … what was his name?  He felt embarrassed by the fact that he couldn&#39;t remember the name of the guy that he was married to in his dream.  Boyd!  That was it.  The redhead was pacing back and forth, but now he stopped by the window to pull back the curtain and look down into the street.  <br />
<br />
Rikki spoke, “Temp is slightly elevated, b/p normal.  Libido tolerable.”<br />
<br />
Jed laughed.  <br />
<br />
Luke didn&#39;t know why, but he felt drawn to the redhead.  He walked over to the window and put his hand around Boyd&#39;s waist.  When he gently turned the guy to face him, he saw that his eyes were bloodshot. His face was flushed, he&#39;d been crying.  It was then that he saw that Boyd had one blue eye and one green eye.  They were tearing up again.  <br />
<br />
Surprising himself, Luke reached up and gently brushed away the tears with his fingers.  He couldn&#39;t stop to acknowledge how differently his fingers looked and felt, they were just different and that wasn&#39;t important in the moment.  “Man of my dreams, you are so significantly important to me … and I love you more than anything else of earth.”<br />
<br />
“Fo sheezy”, Boyd sheepishly asked.<br />
<br />
“Fo shizzle, my nizzle ...”  <br />
<br />
Luke pulled Boyd into his arms and they were lip-locked in passion, tongues wrestling.  <br />
<br />
“No, just no”, Jed said.  <br />
<br />
They remembered they weren&#39;t alone, but it was hard for the lovers to let go of each other.  <br />
<br />
Luke heard his new voice, “Mannnn …. why …?”<br />
<br />
Jed stood up, “You had a significant incident tonight and we&#39;re going to talk about it or … I&#39;m putting you back in the hospital for observation.”<br />
<br />
Somehow Luke knew that his husband was about to tear into the doc and placed himself between the two.  “I&#39;m fine.”<br />
<br />
“Fine.”  The doc seemed to mock.  “Who are you?”<br />
<br />
Luke&#39;s mind raced.  He had to remember everything he&#39;d heard since he woke up in this dream.  The doc was somehow a friend, but he was trying to trip him up.  He had threatened, ….  Still, in this dreamworld, things couldn&#39;t have changed that much.  This was still his apartment, the bathroom was where it always was.  His bedroom was more or less the same.  He hoped he was still a student so maybe so much other stuff hadn&#39;t changed.  He had to swallow, he &#39;was&#39; black now, but it seemed to him that all his memories were intact.  At worst he would eventually wake up, but the thing was, he didn&#39;t want to leave this dream now.  It was nice in an odd sort of way and he certainly didn&#39;t want to &#39;abandon&#39; his husband.   The redhead was deliciously cute and they were, after all married and everything. <br />
<br />
“I&#39;m Lucien James.  I&#39;m an average African American male married to the sweetest guy I know.  I attend college and I am working on my doctorate because I&#39;m so smart.  I offered to buy you a drink when you did that rectal exam.  So what else?”  He cringed.  He didn&#39;t want any more questions, some of which  he might not be able to answer and where did that last thought come from anyways? <br />
<br />
You could tell that Jed was little embarrassed, but he gently put his hand on Luke&#39;s arm, “Do you remember the mugging at all?”<br />
<br />
Trying to remember his real dream now, Luke strained his memory.  It was hard to remember dreams when you woke up, “I remember running.  I remember them kicking me.  I remember hurting … I remember ...”  Thing was, he did remember.  He remembered everything they did to him. And he also remembered them leaving him to die alone.  <br />
<br />
Somehow he was standing there now with Boyd&#39;s arms around him and they were both crying, holding on to each other for dear life.      <br />
<br />
“There is nothing average about you Lucien James.”<br />
<br />
<br />
It caught Luke off guard.  He turned his head and recognized the voice that said those words was Rikki.  He was standing there with his arms crossed and his eyebrow raised.  Jed stood up and put his arm around Rikki.  He smiled and then nodded, “okay for now … just don&#39;t tell us anymore that we&#39;re all a dream and it never happened.  Now get some rest.”<br />
<br />
Rikki returned to form, “That doesn&#39;t mean recreation.  That means rest, sleep, non-waking.  No sex.”  <br />
<br />
“As if, girlfriend ….”, Luke snapped his fingers off to the side.  <br />
<br />
Quietly Jed added, “I can give you a shot if you&#39;d prefer.”  It was clear to everyone what he meant.  Luke didn&#39;t want to sleep.<br />
<br />
Luke cringed.  He never wanted to go to sleep again, he didn&#39;t want to loose this wonderful dream and the life he seemed to be living now.  Boyd felt him cringe.  <br />
<br />
Jed spoke softly, “Lucien … you&#39;ve been through a great deal.  Your body is still healing and that healing happens when you are asleep.  You need it ...”<br />
<br />
Moments seemed like hours.  Jed thought he was thinking about it.  Luke was ready getting ready to fight if it came to that.  Tears began to stream down his face.  “... no …” was all he meagerly got out.   He began to shake violently.<br />
<br />
No more words could happen.  Rikki snatched up Lucien from Boyd&#39;s arms and had him pinned on the bed in one right quick second.  Boyd stood there stunned.  For Luke, he watched as the seconds slid by in slow motion.  Jed was drawing up a fluid from an ampule and then he was injecting it straight into Luke&#39;s vein. <br />
<br />
His voice raspy and strained, he called out to Boyd, “... you&#39;re not a dream … you&#39;re my life … hold on to me … don&#39;t let me go … don&#39;t let me go to sleep … I&#39;m gonna die … hold me … I love you … please ….”   His voice grew soft and distant, “... please ...”  His eyes didn&#39;t close, but he was asleep, his face drenched in tears. <br />
<br />
Boyd climbed in beside his husband, pulling him into his arms.  “You bitches let your own selves out.”  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rikki folded his arms and sank into the chair by the bed, “I ain&#39;t going nowheres bitch.  You want me out, you&#39;ll have to toss me out yourself.”  He cleared his voice and looked up at Jed, “Go to bed.  You have to be on the floor in the morning.”<br />
<br />
Jed took a deep sigh and said nothing.  Arguing was pointless.  He quietly closed the door on his way out.  In a very soft voice Rikki said, “He&#39;s been through enough, god knows.  And so have you.  I&#39;m here if you need me so don&#39;t argue.”  Instead of his standard scowl, his face softened.  Boyd pushed aside his resentment and comforted himself that they had two really devoted friends supporting them.  He felt Lucien&#39;s body relax in his arms.  His breathing was regular now, he wasn&#39;t fighting anymore.</p>
