<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff waited by his front door with so much anticipation he hadn&#39;t felt since he first used the Chronivac. Certainly, he had his cluster of toys to satisfy him wherever and whenever he pleased but, they weren&#39;t real. At least... Not anymore they weren&#39;t. He steadied himself best he could while this meant that he was pacing inside the house rather than outside. After waiting for what seemed like hours, the knock at the door finally came and he opened the door maybe a bit too fast. <br />
<br />
Diana stood at the door with her eyebrow cocked and the showing of a knowing smirk. &quot;You&#39;re just so excited about all of this aren&#39;t you?&quot; There seemed to be a little more to that look in her eyes than she implied but, Jeff wasn&#39;t in a rush to ruin this night. She walked into the house as he stepped out of the way, looking around at the decor with an appraising eye. &quot;I suppose I give it a pass, not at all what I&#39;d have expected for a guy living alone. Let&#39;s not waste anymore time then, yeah?&quot; She started up the stairs while Jeff collected himself.<br />
<br />
This was happening a bit faster than he had been envisioning. He had expected that they might sit and chat for a bit, maybe dinner and a movie like the movies. But... No, there she went straight to the point and without regard for any of the other trappings. Jeff followed her up the stairs a moment later watching the swing of her hips as she peered around this hall same as the last. Not wanting any questions to arise or at least maybe, not yet, all the other doors were closed aside from the bathroom. Indicating which room was his, he caught up as she went to open the door. The thought struck him with the fierce urgency of a lightning bolt, the toys...! They were still out in plain view from the night before. Reaching to take the door, he none too nonchalantly motioned her back.<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;J-Just a second, it&#39;s a little bit of a mess in there yet. I&#39;ll be right back out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diana&#39;s quizzically judging expression arose once more with more of a predatory undertone to it. &quot;Oh sure, just make sure you hide them all really well. I&#39;ve got an eye for that sort of thing.&quot; The grin widened as the last word seemed to slither free. <br />
<br />
Once, inside his room with the door closed, Jeff in his panic did the natural thing. He tossed all the toys in a pile on top of the Alice Doll, heedless of the sensation that gave some of them. Already there was a glistening among the toys in the pile and a faint pat of dripping fluids. He grabbed his school bag and retrieved two Carli condoms from it before adding it to the pile. Now the issue came down on how to disguise it... Considering he always was a bit of a nerd, he sufficed to covering it all with a white sheet and calling it fine with the time constraint. Jeff turned off his computer monitor and opened the door to let Diana in.<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I was up late working on a project and forgot to clean up after myself. Worked myself straight to sleep so I could have the energy for today.&quot; He gave what he felt was a confident chuckle, though even to him it rang a little sheepishly.<br />
<br />
Diana stepped into the room, eyes scouring the confines as they had each time before. Inevitably, they made their way over to the covered &quot;project&quot;. She spotted what looked like a... toe? poking out from under the sheet. With curiosity peaked, she approached the sheet to see just what Jeff had been trying to hide. &quot;So what&#39;s this project of yours?&quot; She reached for the sheet and was blocked by Jeff&#39;s hand resting on top of it.<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;Ah, it&#39;s still a work in progress and I don&#39;t like showing off unfinished work. Gets the anticipation up when you don&#39;t reveal it too soon, ya know?&quot; He gave her a genuine smile and upon seeing her grin before she gave up sitting on the bed, let out a silent sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Diana sat on Jeff&#39;s bed knowing that eventually she&#39;d get that sheet off to see what he was really hiding but for now, she settle for rocking his brain for a bit. Really, she was getting tired of pushing off tonight&#39;s activities. One way or another she was going to get what she wanted and she knew that he had wanted it too. So why wait any longer? She undid her white blouse letting her breasts fall free, she hadn&#39;t worn any underwear tonight, made her feel a bit more... daring.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched and couldn&#39;t stop the rise of his member as he watched Diana take off her top. The firmness of his crotch only stiffened further as her sizable breasts bobbed free of the supporting garment. &quot;You didn&#39;t wear a bra?&quot;<br />
<br />
Diana gave him a coy smirk as she removed her socks next, giving him a tantalizing view of her chest and thighs. &quot;That&#39;s not all I didn&#39;t come with.&quot; She stood having unzipped her blue skirt, one swift motion, later and the skirt pooled around her feet. Her platinum blonde hair flowed over her left shoulder and she had a trimmed patch of hair in the shape of a heart over her vagina. She took a deep satisfied breath running her hand upward from her vagina to coil and twist her right nipple. She let the tiny gasp escape her lips eyeing Jeff and his member trying to fight free of its confines. &quot;Are you going to make me wait all day?&quot; She laid out on the bed beckoning him over with a finger.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood dumbfounded by the sheer confidence being displayed by Diana. Not only had she come inside as if she belonged here, she came here in a skirt with no lingerie whatsoever. Now there she lay on his bed for him to take, he almost pinched himself to stop this dream. Regardless, his libido had decided the next course and taken him slave of its intentions. He nearly tore himself free of his clothing and approached the bed to climb on top of her. He noticed as he did she seemed a little disappointed but, acquiesced anyway.  Just as he started to take the plunge it came to him again. Maybe it was because he hadn&#39;t put on a condom yet, that had to be it. He took one of them and ripped open the package to find a familiar face staring at him.<br />
<br />
Rolled up onto herself as it were, Carli&#39;s face stared at Jeff lost in passion with tongue hanging out to form the nib. There was a stab of pain as firm became too firm. The thought of penetrating a woman with another wrapped on his dick was a kink he had not expected. Diana having seen his pause took the condom without a second glance. &quot;Seems you&#39;re new to this, here&#39;s a free service for tonight.&quot; She placed the the condom in her mouth leaning forward to push him back and off of her. She gave Jeff a little wink as she grabbed hold of and pulled his dick into her mouth. Jeff shuddered intensely as not only could he feeling her tongue fitting the condom on, he felt the warmth and wetness of a real vagina snaring him.<br />
<br />
As she pulled away to admire her &quot;handiwork&quot; she seemed to take note of the &quot;design&quot; of the condom. Wrapped around Jeff&#39;s dick was a squashed caricature of Carli with the base stylized as a vaginal opening. She gave Jeff a wicked grin and laid back on the bed to proceed. &quot;Never seen any like that before, wouldn&#39;t have taken you to be so freaky. Not that I mind that sort of thing.&quot; Jeff recovered from the surprise shock of pleasure and got back to task. He was already dribbling himself inside the sensation of the condom, hopefully he could make this last. One last prepatory breath and he eased himself inside Diana. <br />
<br />
This was a sensation he could get used to but, would never be able to explain if he tried. He felt every detail of Diana&#39;s vagina while simultaneously experiencing Carli&#39;s. Definitely these condoms would have to be made to last or maybe he&#39;d just have to resupply. The thought came with a smirk of his own as he slowly yet, firmly thrust into Diana. He grabbed her left breast working it and pressing the nipple under thumb. She was softly moaning with the efforts given and Jeff felt proud of himself. That was until she wrapped her legs around him. She pulled him in quickly and roughly as soon as he slid out, that was when he saw the hungry look in her eyes. <br />
<br />
Jeff found himself unable to keep up with her pace and loosed himself inside Carli. Diana released her leg lock letting him fall back to the bed as she sat up. &quot;A little sore and a little soon but, overall not bad.&quot; Giving him a kind but, oddly smug smile she pat the soft of his waist. She peeled the condom off his dick letting some of the semen spill out and tied it off. She eyed the trashcan and tossed the portion of once human into the trash as it had served its purpose. It wasn&#39;t too long after that that she was dressed and making her way out. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not disappointed, I will~ be back.&quot; He was still laying on the bed huffing as she left, this was so much more work than his toys. Maybe there was something he could do about that.<br />
<br />
It had been a month since then but, true to her word, she had told him to be ready for tomorrow. Jeff had worked out a bit since then trying to bring up his stamina. Not only that but, most of his toys were still sticky with various fluids in the corner, he&#39;d have to remember to cover them before tonight. He used the vagina onahole he&#39;d gained from Carli the most to get used to how it felt. Now, he had become acclimated to it but, it still made its way to being one of his favorites aside from Alice and his once mother. There was just the excitement of it being his first trophy that piqued his uses of it. Alice was his only full-sized and full trophy of the bunch. There was the random girl he&#39;d picked up in the hall that one day and her dildo friend but, it hadn&#39;t really done anything for him. As such it lay on the floor between the Alice doll&#39;s legs, stuck to the floor by a mix of fluids. The Jannice doll being half its size was only good when he had to work off some frustration. Seeing the pleasure locked face of the trio of bitches as he fucked it roughly always gave him a better mood. He often left the vibrator girl in it like a figure stand.<br />
<br />
Anyway, he thought to himself, he had to focus on tomorrow like he was told. Thinking of all of that did give him an idea though... He&#39;d have to try it once she was over. The next day, as Diana entered the house, he set Kiri(Kelly) to scan her info. He picked up his phone and peered at it as they walked to his room.<br />
<br />

Race: Human<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Age: 19<br />
Hair: Platinum Blonde<br />
Height: 5&#39;9&quot;<br />
Weight: 105 lbs<br />

Waist: 19 inches<br />
Gluteus: 22 inches<br />
<br />
He looked up from it eyeing Diana versus the info for a moment, appreciating the fine details of her body. Then, he enacted his plan, in the special instructions box he added that she&#39;d have increased sensitivity at about four times normal. Hitting enter with making only that change, he looked up and caught her shudder in response. A grin formed on his face, let&#39;s see how tonight goes then. Impressively it worked, the combination of practice with the help of the Chronivac had Diana like putty in his hands. Her back arched and she howled out a pleasureful moan as she came first soaking the Carli condom. This time it was Jeff who tied and tossed it as Diana recovered from the session. This went on for the next few months, the visits becoming more and more frequent. Each time Jeff made sure to revert the change as to not cause issues for her later.<br />
<br />
After the months passed Jeff had finally let his guard down enough that Diana decided to strike. When she came over this time, while he was distracted by his phone again, she ignored the stirring in her loins and ripped the sheet off of the &quot;project&quot;. She was met with the sight of multiple realistic and expensive looking sex toys. Jeff had reached out too late and watched in worry as she picked up the string of anal beads. The former student council had made for a rather colorful and impressively designed toy after all. Diana eyed the still human elements of each ball reading off the names from end to end. She finally held it up triumphantly before Jeff that wicked grin returned. &quot;This is what you&#39;ve been hiding eh?&quot; She pulled a bottle of lube from her bag and started working it onto the beads. &quot;Afraid you might be too kinky for me? Well let... me... show... you~&quot; She got onto all fours on the bed and slowly popped in one bead at a time till she hit the safety cap. &quot;There... See?~&quot; She wagged her ass causing the end to tap against her cheeks. <br />
<br />
Diana next eyed the Jannice doll and it&#39;s improvised vibrator stand. She pulled the vibrator out in a corkscrewing motion turning it on and giving it a long lick kissing the tip. &quot;You&#39;ve been such a good boy for me, I think I&#39;ll give you a present this time.&quot; She undid his pants rested the human shaped vibrator on its base underneath her. Kneeling down as Jeff thinking quickly for once grabbed the remote to the beads, she positioned the vibrator with one hand. The other wrapped around Jeff&#39;s uncovered dick and she inserted his and the vibrator at the same time. Her tongue worked the shaft but, gave special care to the tip as she pulled back. Meanwhile, she worked the vibrator inside herself making her breaths husky. Jeff gave her time to get into a rhythm before he smiled down to her. &quot;I got a surprise for you too.&quot; He turned on the vibrating beads causing Diana to jerked and take a deep breath through her nose midstroke. <br />
<br />
At the end of this session, Diana laid on the bed the most satisfied she head been in all of these fucks. She eyed the Alice doll propped in the corner holding Jeff&#39;s once mother and looked to Jeff himself. &quot;Is that how you got so good at this? I think I kinda of like it.&quot; Diana walked over to the doll in question and gave it a deep kiss. &quot;Thanks for teaching my boy~&quot; She reached down and gave the onahole in its hand a quick swipe with her finger. It surprised her slightly as it quivered and let out a small burst of fluid at her touch. &quot;I didn&#39;t forget you, don&#39;t worry.&quot; Returning to the bed, she laid underneath the covers and stayed for the night.<br />
<br />
Another month passed and Jeff had gotten so used to the routine they had that he finally just hit autofill on the Chronivac for this night. He pressed enter and with condom in place took Diana from behind. She had a penchant for the anal beads choosing to use them every session now. Jeff didn&#39;t mind at all, feeling them vibrate while he thrusted just added to the pleasure of it. Holding onto her sides he kept thrusting harder and faster the louder she got. What neither had seemed to notice was that her hands and feet were now gone. The deeper they got into the session the more her arms and legs melded away. Coming to a climax, Jeff finally noticed how heavy she&#39;d gotten in his arms. He looked down to see he was the only thing holding her off of the bed.<br />
<br />
Diana was loving every moment of this session, each thrust seemed more intense than the last. It was so good, that she couldn&#39;t feel her arms or legs anymore. When at last she climaxed, she hung her head panting and noticed with a start that she couldn&#39;t feel them because they weren&#39;t there. She should&#39;ve panicked but, the haze of pleasure clung to her mind keeping the fear at bay. She trying to say something to Jeff about it but, all that came out was a soft moan. All she could do was watch as Jeff grew larger and a popping sound came from behind her. <br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to set her down and check the Chronivac, see what was happening and if he could stop it. However, as he went to set her down she almost slipped free of his hands. He instinctively caught her and noticed why she had slipped... Diana was shrinking in his hands as he watched, the beads started sliding out with an audible pop as the housing ass became smaller. All the while Diana, looked him in the eyes and moaned in a shrinking pleasure drunk voice. Soon, fluid projected out of her gaping mouth as they made their way out of her shrinking body. It wasn&#39;t long till he held what was left of her in one hand. Her body didn&#39;t lose it&#39;s texture remaining as supple as it had always been. Her head was now locked forward still dribbling fluid, he slid her off his dick to get a better look at what had become of her. <br />
<br />
What he now held in his had was like a miniature limbless version on Diana. Her face was locked in ecstasy and with a rub against anything sensitive, a tiny moan spilled forth almost as if programmed. The vaginal opening had remained at full size giving the new toy an almost flat base to sit on. The details were as realistic as any other and the opening dribbling with every sensation her applied to it, accidentally or not. Setting her down gently, he picked up his phone to check the app.<br />

<br />
He looked back to Diana who was now unfortunately nothing more than a sex toy herself. Sure enough, like what he made of his once mother, she was dribbling a stream of fluid onto the bed. Unlike that toy, she retained most of her form and just the mere touch of the sheets on her form was causing her to dribble. That sensitive would make setting her some where difficult. What else could he do though? Permanent was just that... Permanent... She was left on the bed where she lay as Jeff sat in his computer chair head in hands. Where would all this lead him now...?</p>
