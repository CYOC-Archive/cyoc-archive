<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">People that the boy didn't know sat at his table in the cafeteria. They were all furries. The good news, none of them were of the same species that had hurt him in the past.<br />
<br />
“Hello?” the red panda questioned.<br />
<br />
“Hey T,” they said. It was his nickname.<br />
<br />
“What's up?”<br />
<br />
The weasel furry sat down beside him. He seemed to be the one who wanted to do the talking the most. There was also a rat and a ferret. T had a bad feeling about this.<br />
<br />
“We noticed you hanging out all by yourself this past week.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” T said to himself.<br />
<br />
“Of course,” the weasel nodded. “We just wanted to know what's the problem. We were all new here one time, so its good if you talk to us.”<br />
<br />
“Oh...well, that's not necessary. I'm good. I'm...I'm kind of a loner.”<br />
<br />
“Don't worry about that. We can help you out. In fact, us guys were gonna go hang out later tonight. How about you join us.”<br />
<br />
“Where you going?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I don't know. We'll go to the skate-park first. You skate?”<br />
<br />
“A little.”<br />
<br />
“Good. We could get to know each other a little better.”<br />
<br />
“OK.”<br />
<br />
By then, T was just going with it. He didn't care. He was sure his parents wouldn't mind if he stayed out. They didn't seem to interfere with him ever since he took the VexCo vial.<br />
<br />
Which brought him to the next question. “Have you guys been watching me?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” the weasel replied. “But its nothing creepy. We were just wondering what type of person you were. You seem to like the company of humans more than furries though.” he chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Really?” T wondered. “If I came across like that, sorry. I didn't mean anything.”<br />
<br />
“No need to apologize. We shouldn't judge before we meet people. So what do you say? You coming with us?”<br />
<br />
T thought about it for a moment. He thought long and hard. But after weighing the options, he felt that it would be good to finally have friends to talk to.<br />
<br />
“Alright. I'll go.”<br />
<br />
“Good...” the weasel said. “My name's Dicky, but call me Dick. This rat over here is Brett, and the ferret is Larry.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” T nodded. “My name's T.”<br />
<br />
“T?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well my first name is kind of lame,” T said, rolling his eyes. “'Mauricio'. I never liked it.”<br />
<br />
“How interesting.”<br />
<br />
The bell rang, signaling the end of lunch.<br />
<br />
“We'll see you after school, T,” Dick said.<br />
<br />
“Alright...” T replied.<br />
<br />
They left just like that. T finished what he had left. He felt better. All the while, his red paws started to glow a brighter red, and he had to cover it. He didn't want another incident to happen, like in the last town. Not when he just got to making friends.<br />
<br />
–--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“That was too easy,” Brett said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, how do you do it, Dick?” wondered Larry.<br />
<br />
“It's all in the word choice,” Dick replied. “And, it'd help to do your research before you trick someone into doing what you want.”<br />
<br />
“His house is BIG!” Larry sighed.<br />
<br />
“I know. So the new chief of police is in town, with his lover into real estate. Both humans and a furry child. Trust me boys, no one will know a thing about our doing. T's just going to have to take the fall. It's what he gets for being so gullible.”<br />
<br />
“So what's the plan, Dick?” Brett questioned.<br />
<br />
“Spread the word; furry party at T's house.”<br />
<br />
–--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Axel fixed his collar on his shirt. He decided on going unbuttoned, showing his furry chest off for everyone who'd show up. It was a furry themed party, after all.<br />
<br />
“What do you think, Jack?” he asked his feline friend.<br />
<br />
“Looks OK. Let me sleep,” the cat snoozed.<br />
<br />
“Whatever,” Axel said under his breath.<br />
<br />
His shirt was black with gray stripes going down. Over his shoulders were green marks which matched his eyes and paws. He was told every time that he looked damn good in that shirt.<br />
<br />
He evened out the creases, made sure he picked out the right jeans and was out the front door with only a “be back soon” to his parents.<br />
<br />
He met Matt at the corner of the street.<br />
<br />
“It's a party Matt,” Axel chuckled.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
The cat boy was wearing his still dorky attire from school. If he went to the party, he was sure to be the laughingstock. It worried Axel a little.<br />
<br />
“Wow, what's not happening here?”<br />
<br />
Dan had just arrived.<br />
<br />
“Hey Dan. You ready?” Axel asked.<br />
<br />
“Of course. Though someone else isn't,” the wolf commented.<br />
<br />
Matt once again felt disappointed.<br />
<br />
“Relax,” Dan laughed. “I'm sure JJ will hook you up with something awesome.”<br />
<br />
“Is he coming?” Axel wondered.<br />
<br />
“Of course he is. We just gotta go get him.”<br />
<br />
The boys walked together down the curving suburbs, to the bus stop. The bus took them further away from the neighborhood, down towards the less than spectacular homes before hitting somewhat rock bottom poor. They knew their way well. The ride gave them enough time to talk to each other, and they learned a lot about Matt as well. It was during this bus ride that Matt came out to Dan.<br />
<br />
Dan didn't say much at first. “Oh—ohhh,” he stuttered. “Well, that's cool I guess. Actually, that makes a lot of sense.”<br />
<br />
“I—I never tell anyone. Only Axel knew...”<br />
<br />
“It's fine, really. Be who you want to be, I don't care. Why've you been hiding this?”<br />
<br />
“I—I don't want to get laughed at...”<br />
<br />
“No one's gonna laugh at you. You just gotta be you. See, you should have told someone this a long time ago; you would have had other gay friends sooner,” he laughed.<br />
<br />
Matt didn't find it funny.<br />
<br />
“Just don't say anything about it around JJ,” Dan warned. “He'll freak. As much as he doesn't look it, he's kind of a Jesus freak.”<br />
<br />
“No he's not,” Axel scoffed.<br />
<br />
“You don't know him as long as I do.”<br />
<br />
“He wouldn't be coming to the party if he was.”<br />
<br />
“yeah, well—uh—um—,” Dan stammered. “Yeah, you got me there. But that's not the point, you can't say he won't freak if he knew. He's homophobic too.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe a little...” Axel agreed.<br />
<br />
They arrived. They left the bus and walked onwards down the winding paths, stumbling across unkempt houses until they found their friend's place. It was better kept than the others, though only one floor. It didn't look like there was anybody home.<br />
<br />
“The goods of the working class family,” Dan stated. “Everyone's at work.”<br />
<br />
They rang the doorbell. No one came. Axel knocked, and rang the doorbell again, but still no one answered. Dan decided to take things into his own paws.<br />
<br />
He knocked harshly. “Come on JJ, we gotta go. I know you're in there.”<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silence. “I—I don't want to go anymore,” came a weary reply.<br />
<br />
The boys looked at each other. Axel appeared worried for his friend. Dan was confused. Matt was unsure and between the two expressions.<br />
<br />
“What happened man, did you take the vial?” Dan asked.<br />
<br />
Of course he had to. It was a furry party; only furs were allowed. Humans could come, but they had to come as furries.<br />
<br />
“Don't like the way you came out?” Dan continued. “Just take some helium and try again, but think of something else. You wanna be a wolf? I'll tell you what to think.”<br />
<br />
Axel punched his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“You know it doesn't work like that,” Axel bemused.<br />
<br />
“I...” JJ started. “I can't go. You guys go without me.”<br />
<br />
“That's complete bullshit!” Dan cursed. <br />
<br />
“Stop it Dan!” Axel said, touching his shoulder, his green paw pad glowing. He knew his friend would have to listen now.<br />
<br />
Dan grumbled and resisted calling out again.<br />
<br />
“What's wrong JJ?” Axel called.<br />
<br />
“Nothing's wrong,” JJ answered quickly. “I just don't want to go anymore. Please, just go.”<br />
<br />
“JJ, we already came here. Just tell us what's wrong.”<br />
<br />
“I can't.”<br />
<br />
Axel sighed.<br />
<br />
“Hey JJ,” Dan started. “Listen, we totally get that you don't want to go. That's fine, and we'll be on our way. But, if you could, would you just open the door? Besides, we need you to help Matt dress better. I know you got that whole 'dress' thing down all the time, so just throw us a bone here or something.”<br />
<br />
There was a long pause. “I can't.”<br />
<br />
Dan was annoyed again.<br />
<br />
Axel looked at the peephole. He looked hard. In a matter of seconds, got an idea. He hated doing it again, but he felt he had to. Again.<br />
<br />
“JJ, I know you're behind the door. Look at me for just a second.”<br />
<br />
There was a short pause. “What is it?”<br />
<br />
When he felt that he had him looking through the peephole, he began. “I need you to open the door, and let us in. Whatever is puzzling you, we can help.”<br />
<br />
Another short pause. There was a sound of a latch unlocking.<br />
<br />
Dan and Matt were stunned.<br />
<br />
“How'd you do that?” Dan whispered.<br />
<br />
“Just talking,” Axel replied sheepishly.<br />
<br />
The door opened slightly, JJ still hidden. “Come on in then.”<br />
<br />
One by one, the boys entered. JJ closed the door behind them, his tail brushing against Axel.<br />
<br />
“Ah, so you did become furry,” Axel replied. “Let's see...what are you?”<br />
<br />
He couldn't tell with just the tail. JJ had a jacket with the hoodie over his head, and was wearing sweatpants. His black bushy tail was all the boys could see, but it had a gleam of...blue stripes going down the length.<br />
<br />
“You dyed your fur?” Dan wondered.<br />
<br />
“No,” JJ answered, but he kept his face away.<br />
<br />
“Well go on, show us what you look like,” Dan egged on.<br />
<br />
JJ gulped. He turned around slowly, removing his hoodie and unzipped his jacket.<br />
<br />
“Wow...” the three boys admired.<br />
<br />
He was a skunk, black all around. At his underbelly, there was a blue ring outline before the white fur settled in, and his paws, both at his legs and hands, were a dark blue. His inner ears also had a blue outline over white ovals. His back had three lines, coming down and ending at the tip of his tail. The outer lines were blue, while the inner line was white. Where his brown eyes had been were now dark blue ones, and above his eyes was a pattern shaped like white furred eye liner.<br />
<br />
“I...I can't go.” JJ muttered.<br />
<br />
“You look freakin SWEET!” Dan shouted.<br />
<br />
“That looks so awesome, JJ!” Matt gushed.<br />
<br />
But Axel knew there was more to it than just color. He felt it, and he also felt a grave unnerving coming from JJ.<br />
<br />
But he kept the good coming. “You look awesome,” Axel forced a smile.<br />
<br />
“I have to stay home. And you guys gotta go,” JJ ushered them towards the door.<br />
<br />
“Wow wait, that's it?” Dan wondered. “Come on man, you'd be the life of the party! There'd be so many people jealous of your colors; I hear that's a rare phenomenon, man, don't waste it! Just take helium after the party and you're all better.”<br />
<br />
But JJ was far from reassured.<br />
<br />
“You; Matt,” JJ said. “You need a shirt, right?”<br />
<br />
“Y—yeah...”<br />
<br />
“Wait here.” JJ left the area, going to the back of the house. A couple of dogs started barking.<br />
<br />
“When did he get dogs?” Dan questioned.<br />
<br />
Axel shrugged.<br />
<br />
He returned with a white buttoned shirt, with black twisted designs on it indicating it was of an expensive brand. Axel shuddered for a moment; JJ didn't have many of those because he was too poor to afford them. He was lending out his best.<br />
<br />
“This'll do. Take off that thing; I'll put it in a bag.”<br />
<br />
Matt complied, and JJ left for a moment, only to return with the bag and a nice pair of jeans.<br />
<br />
“How does the shirt fit?”<br />
<br />
“G—good,” Matt nodded.<br />
<br />
“Great. Try these on, and give me those pants. Never wear them again.”<br />
<br />
The entire time, Axel felt that JJ was trying to keep his eye contact away from all of them. He felt another wave of nausea washed over him.<br />
<br />
Once Matt was dressed, JJ opened the door and pointed the way out. “I've done my part. You guys have to go. I'll be fine.”<br />
<br />
Axel held onto Matt and Dan, and then whispered to them both. “You guys go on. I'll meet you there.”<br />
<br />
They had to listen; he used his powers again.<br />
<br />
The two left the house and were on their way. JJ motioned for Axel to follow. “Go on; go.”<br />
<br />
Here, Axel pulled JJ's paw and looked at it. It was glowing a brighter blue. From this, he knew that there was something up now, and his doubts were cleared.<br />
<br />
“You have a gift,” Axel said. “Powers; don't you?”<br />
<br />
To ensure he got the right answer, he used his own power. JJ's eyes opened wide, looking at Axel's paws glow just like his.<br />
<br />
“I—I do,” JJ stammered.<br />
<br />
Axel closed his eyes, nodding in agreement. “Tell me what it is.”<br />
<br />
For awhile, JJ said nothing. He closed the door and rubbed his paw, still looking away.<br />
<br />
“I'll tell you, but you gotta promise me you won't tell anyone else.”<br />
<br />
Axel nodded. “Deal.”<br />
<br />
JJ waited for a second, looking out the window. “Follow me,” he said, and then passed him, still not looking into his eyes and going to the back of the house.<br />
<br />
Dogs started barking again. Axel came to the end and looked to where the dogs were penned. They were chihuahua's; four of them, locked with a mini-pen in JJ's room.<br />
<br />
“I took the VexCo formula,” JJ started. “Obviously. I knew there would be something different about me because of the way I was changing. Blue isn't a color for any animal that I knew of, and when I could see that I was becoming an odd colored skunk...well, I knew this wasn't normal.” He looked away, never once looking at Axel straight. “One of those dogs, I was taking care of for my neighbor. Two of the others are my parents. The last one is my...brother.” Tears began to form in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Then Axel understood completely, unsure of how to proceed. “You can change other people's species...”<br />
<br />
JJ nodded, still tears in his eyes. “Apparently that's not all. They're—they're...all girls...”<br />
<br />
Axel looked back. It was true.<br />
<br />
“You need to change them back,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Don't you think I've tried that?” JJ blasted, still looking away. “I tried everything, but I can't do it! I think my powers are a one way trip...I tried changing myself too, but it didn't work! It looks like I can change everyone but myself, and once they're changed I can't turn them back!”<br />
<br />
Axel didn't know what to say. He never found himself in a situation like this before. Ever.<br />
<br />
“I don't even know how it happened!” JJ continued. “I was taking care of the dog, and my brother came in. He played with her all while I was there. I took the vial, and changed. My little brother was happy, but then I just thought about the female chihuahua while I was holding on to him, and then he started changing! My parents came in, they wanted an answer to the way I looked. I looked at them in the eyes, and I didn't know what to say, all I could think about were the two new female dogs! And then they started to change too! Just by looking at them! And—and then I tried changing back—I did what the instructions said, I had so much helium, but I couldn't change back! I—I don't know what to do...” JJ moaned.<br />
<br />
Axel knew what the problem was. He had heard about it. The legendary few in the world who have gained powers from the vial. His friend was one of them. Just like himself, only Axel had been born with them. And those legendary few...none of them could ever return back to normal, even with helium. This would have been to much to lay on JJ right now. He stared at the dogs, keeping to himself. They looked at him expectantly, two obviously worried ones. They were animals...purebred chihuahuas...<br />
<br />
Then the solution hit him like a brick wall. “Where's your VexCo vial?” Axel asked.<br />
<br />
“In my room, over there,” he said, motioning up to his desk. It was empty.<br />
<br />
“Do you have any more? Those things come in packs of four,” Axel said.<br />
<br />
And the answer dawned on JJ too. “Of course!”<br />
<br />
He ran out of the hallway. Axel followed him to the kitchen, where he opened the fridge and pulled out three vials.<br />
<br />
“They were all human before, right?”<br />
<br />
“Of course; my parents are huge advocates against furries. Sorry, Axel.”<br />
<br />
“No harm done. Do you got a bottle, or something that won't spill?”<br />
<br />
“Baby bottles,” JJ replied, pulling them out of the cabinet.<br />
<br />
“Your brother's like four, right?”<br />
<br />
“He'll be four in three weeks.”<br />
<br />
“That's a dangerous age...”<br />
<br />
“Will it work?”<br />
<br />
“It should, but my Dad says people shouldn't take it below five.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry Axel, but my brother needs this,” JJ said, pouring the vials into three bottles.<br />
<br />
“I...I understand,” Axel said nervously.<br />
<br />
Once the bottles were ready, they took them back to the room and picked out the three chihuahuas JJ was sure were his parents and brother.<br />
<br />
“Remember, they have to drink it all,” Axel warned.<br />
<br />
“I know. God, I hope this works,” JJ said. He gave a small prayer. Shortly thereafter, the two fed the dogs the bottle.<br />
<br />
“You have to get out of here, Axel,” JJ said. “Dad'll be really mad.”<br />
<br />
“I'm not going anywhere.” And he didn't have to use his powers against JJ. He was going to stay for him because he was a friend.<br />
<br />
Slowly, the dogs started to change. Their limbs were growing out, becoming more human. It was a grotesque sight; Axel had never seen an animal become humanoid, and obviously neither had JJ.<br />
<br />
“They don't have clothes!” JJ shouted, and he zipped out of the room towards the bathroom to grab three fresh towels.<br />
<br />
Axel had the privilege of watching the sight before him. Their heads were growing, too big for their small body, and lolling on the ground. Then their bodies were elongating, with the exception of the little brother.<br />
<br />
“Mom, Dad!” JJ came rushing back with the towels.<br />
<br />
One of the dogs put a paw up. She was telling him to stop.<br />
<br />
“I don't mean to ruin this some more JJ, but I don't think you'll have a Dad and brother. Looks more like two Moms and a—,”<br />
<br />
“Shut up!” JJ shouted.<br />
<br />
It startled Axel. He had never known JJ to shout back to anyone; he was too much of a “good boy” to do anything like that.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Axel said.<br />
<br />
But he was right. Their bodies returned to human proportions, and there was a small baby furry between the two Moms.<br />
<br />
“Which one's my Mom?”<br />
<br />
“I...I don't know...” Axel responded. But he couldn't help himself; he was a teenager, and these two chihuahua furs that formed looked hot. He got a boner.<br />
<br />
To which JJ hit him over the head. “Stop that! Those are my parents!”<br />
<br />
“I know! Sorry,” Axel replied genuinely.<br />
<br />
The two women got up and looked at each other, confused, unsure of what to think. The little girl started to cry, to which one of the girls picked her up and carried her close. “My baby...” she cried.<br />
<br />
“Mom...” JJ said quietly.<br />
<br />
“What did you do?!” the other woman cried, holding her breasts in front of her. “What are these?!”<br />
<br />
“Wait Dad, I can explain!” JJ started.<br />
<br />
“What are you?! You're no son of mine!” She stood, hate in her eyes. “Furries; if I'd known you were dying to be one, I would have done so much more to you. You are a disappointment.”<br />
<br />
“No Dad, please, let me explain! I didn't mean for this to happen.”<br />
<br />
“Leave this home! I never want to see you again!”<br />
<br />
“No, don't say that—!” JJ cried. Tears formed in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Get away from here! Never come back, and take your friend with you!”<br />
<br />
The woman picked Axel up by the ears and threw him at JJ, the two colliding and falling to the floor. JJ dropped the towels, and the woman picked them up, covering herself as best as she could.<br />
<br />
“Get out before I call the cops!”<br />
<br />
The cries of the baby were intense. The cries from her mother were calming, but still gut wrenching. And the anger from his father, turned second mother, were a blow to JJ too harsh to take.<br />
<br />
“I can fix this,” Axel said. He tried to stand, but then the woman grabbed both boys and led them to the door, throwing them out on the streets together. She closed the door without another word. Axel didn't have a chance to try to use his powers even once.<br />
<br />
