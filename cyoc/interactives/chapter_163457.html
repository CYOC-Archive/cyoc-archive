<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It didn’t take long for Josh to break Jacob’s will. In fact Jacob only lasted seconds as he was pushed deep into his subconscious unable to control his body. Josh was  now in full control. He then opened his eyes and saw that time had resumed as if nothing happened. <br />
<br />
“Well that was simpler than I thought.” Josh said to himself with a grin. He then looked down and saw Jacob’s massive belly. He lifted his new pudgy hands and gave his new belly a soft pat. When he did this his belly jiggle slightly which actually felt pretty good. He then reached into his pocket and pulled out Jacob’s phone and looked at his reflection in the screen. The face staring back at him was Jacob’s. “Wow I really am Jacob this is amazing!” Josh said excitedly. <br />
<br />
He put Jacob’s phone back in his pocket and began taking his first steps in Jacob’s body. It was a bit difficult at first considering how Jacob had to waddle because he was so fat. Not to mention the fact that his new belly was slapping against his thighs as he tried to walk didn’t help much either. However with a bit of effort Josh started waddling like he had been doing this his whole life and began making his way towards the bus stop.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes the bus stop was in sight and Josh was winded and sweating. He was amazed by how strong Jacob was to be able to carry around all this blubber with ease. Once Josh had reached the bus stop he sat down on the curb. When he sat down he noticed how much softer it felt and he was just glad to have the weight off his feet. This moment of rest didn’t last long however because as he was just starting to relax his stomach begin to growl. This feeling of  hunger was like nothing ever felt before and he needed something to eat badly. <br />
<br />
Josh then decided to check Jacob’s backpack to see if there was a lunch he could eat. After a few moments of only finding books send papers. Josh opened the front of the backpack and found that was full of junk food. Anything from candy to potato chips. Josh‘s mouth was watering just looking at it. “Huh so this is why Jacob was so fat.” Jacob said as he picked up a bag of potato chips. He opened a bag and began stuffing his face. The moment he took the first bite an explosion of flavor filled his mouth. Nothing like the usual salty greasy taste that he was used too. It was as if these chips we’re gift from God. As he kept stuffing his face he started to become entranced. The more he ate the more he wanted and the more he was losing control. As he finished the chips and started eating in one of the candy bars unaltered memories of Jacob’s life before the spell started to flash through his head. Jacob’s memories consisted of a boy growing up becoming fatter and fatter. Becoming a young man obsessed with food and wanting to grow bigger. Including memories of guys he had a crush on Josh being one of them.<br />
<br />
Once the flashing memories dissipated and Josh was no longer entranced by his eating frenzy. He was confused on what just happened looking around he saw the rappers of three candy bars and two empty bags of potato chips. It was then that he realize does this spell gave him access to Jacob’s memories. Now after seeing Jacobs memories it all made sense. Jacob was a gainer that’s why he’s so fat. However the one thing that shocked him the most was that Jacob was gay and he had a crush on him. <br />
<br />
Josh didn’t know what to think it was a lot to take in. The thoughts of gaining weight and wanting to be bigger still lingering in his mind. He tried to stop thinking about it but he couldn’t. He wanted to be fat like Jacob maybe even bigger. Then the thought of him and Jacob being together filled his mind. Josh now felt attracted to him. With all these thoughts in Josh’s head. He began to feel aroused and Jacob’s dick underneath all of his flab became erect. Josh really wanted to stroke it however the sound of the bus in the distance made him sad that he couldn’t.<br />
<br />
Josh just sat there trying to resist the urge and decides to...</p>
