<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeremy's father was silent for a few moment, &quot;I... see you're taking this role of 'Lord of the Deer' the other guests have given you very seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't lie to myself and say it isn't a part of me now. I don't care if it's something the owners of the park can take away in an instant. The herd is mine, and my responsibility.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know you can't simply stay 'chief buck' in this park forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that. But as long as I am, I'm going to live up to the responsibilities of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I suppose I can understand your choice, but if you can't forgive her, at least try to understand her. She doesn't always show it, and sometimes she may act contrary, but she does love you son.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Unruly instincts or not, she had a very funny way of showing it.&quot; Jeremy said darkly.<br />
<br />
The taller buck signed, &quot;I delivered her message to you, like I promised I would, it was actually the only thing that gave me the resolve to have my DNA creatively revised to come in here naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meh. Be here long enough, and you understand how some things lose their meaning and other things feel more important.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not likely to happen. The park let us in just for the wedding, any longer and we'd have to sign a vacation contract, and I don't feel comfortable leaving my job for a year. Speaking of which, why didn't you try and tell us you were getting married?! And have you thought about your collage degree?&quot;<br />
<br />
Normally, Drake wouldn't have let a buck speak to his herd leader like this, but this buck was Boss Man Jeremy's father... and combined with human cultural concepts, that made this buck privileged. <br />
<br />
Jeremy was a bit shaken by his dad's change in tone, but his time as herd leader have given him the nerve to stand his ground. &quot;That's one of the policies of the park, no contact with the outside world while in here, and vice versa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds full of it to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree. But Lance didn't see a problem with it at the time. Apparently he thought it was cool that he could do what he wanted within reason and we couldn't tell people on the outside, after that, everyone didn't really think about it.&quot; As for Lance, Jeremy had done the worst possible thing Jeremy could have done to his senior frat member: He had treated Lance like any other member of the herd, no better, no worse than any other member of the herd, not as a torture toy, and not as someone special at all. And for Lance, that was more humbling than anything else Jeremy could have done. <br />
<br />
&quot;And your degree?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I'm going to have to ultimately retake some classes.&quot; Jeremy said, it was funny how after he had accepted Leticia's pregnancy, leaving the park had become a abstract thought to him. &quot;But my family comes first. And the park's already promised full medical and continued time in the park without the loss of privileges. And given how me and Leticia are, we wouldn't know wether to go to a vet or a doctor if something went wrong. These people, like it or not, know more about our new bodies than we do.&quot;<br />
<br />
His father's face darkened, but he said, &quot;So in other words they have you by the antlers. I can appreciate that. Just don't let them push you around much more Jeremy, you've faced up to Maggie, something I never thought you'd do, and look at all your frat mates and all these other vacationers who are looking up to you now. It.... wouldn't do for the herd if their lead stag was mistaken for a coward.&quot; His father was slightly confused by his own terminology, but there were more important things to think about.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't be. I'm just worried they'll pull the rug from under me AND my family if I cause trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but you could churn up a maelstrom in the tabloids if they did that... oh.. and your mother chose NOT to do that for your information.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noted.&quot; Jeremy said emotionlessly. <br />
<br />
&quot;The point is, this park might be able to throw you out on your tail, but sure as hades there's plenty of ways you'll be able to get back at them, and they know it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dad, I just don't want to risk Leticia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me son, believe it or not, that's something I can very much understand.&quot; There was also the matter the older man considered his collage age son foolish for accepted his altered DNA like it was a new trend of clothes. But he had absolutely no intention of saying that on his son's wedding day. This day wouldn't come again.  &quot;Just remember you're still a person, don't let them turn you into a zoo exhibit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dad.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Weee!&quot; A fawn cried happily. Jeremy and his father looked as two of his cousins ran around the reception like ping-pong balls, while their older sister who was in between fawn and doe was under a tree looking positively red and making an admirably attempt to cover herself. <br />
<br />
Because of Maggie, Jeremy's family had a reasonably good idea of the park's existence and what went on within it. It was still something else however, to behold it for themselves. But for Jeremy's younger cousins, it was wonderland, too bad they had to leave this evening. True, they didn't once think about if they stayed here they'd miss Saturday morning cartoons, but since they wouldn't be staying that long, this place would remain a place of wonder and excitement for them rather than a wall less juvenile hall like some of the World of Warcraft addicts. <br />
<br />
Spike saw them, and was more than ready to talk to them, sure he had found fawns his own age to play with! At last! He felt a slight tap on his shoulders, and started slightly when he saw the little lynx from the other day standing behind him with her arms crossed behind her back smirking.  It had nothing to do with her being a predator, it was she now might be a -fairy- that started Spike. This was exciting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Lexy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Spike!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really a fairy like some of the grown-ups are saying now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lexy didn't stop smiling and after a few moment of silence said, &quot;I could not be a fairy. But those who think I'm a fairy won't ever have any other information other than what they have now. And what will make life more interesting for them? For me to be a fairy? Or me to be just another lynx? So since it doesn't matter if I'm a fairy or not, just say I'm a fairy, cause that feels nicer to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spike little head swam. Not understanding half of what Lexy had just said. &quot;Uh... okay. So you can be a fairy if I want you to be?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A little. Just don't tell any of the grown ups.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... Hey! There are some new fawns here, wanna play with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup!&quot; <br />
<br />
They didn't so much come up to the two new fawns as get in the way of their trajectory and successfully gambled on them coming to a stop before they bowled Lexy and Spike over.  <br />
<br />
The two tikes were surprised at how unease the lynx made them feel, one of them owned a cat as a pet, so a big kitty shouldn't have felt bad at all. The weird feeling unease was confusing, they were still too high on the excitement and thrill of this place for it to effect them greatly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi! I'm Spike!&quot;  &quot;I'm Lexy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny smiled as she watched Spike interact with kids rather than adults. It was good for him. He couldn't be surrounded by adults his whole time after all. Jenny felt proud to be his mother. Still thinking of her fawn as the center of the universe, determined to see that he turned out right this time, Jenny also knew she needed to consider a proper positive father figure for Spike. There was always Rob. He was nice enough, and had taken to being polite when Sam had suggested the bucks actually talk with the does. <br />
<br />
However, Rob's stay in the park would expire before Spike and Jenny left, and Rob it seemed liked the idea of becoming an ape rather than a deer again. It deflated Jenny slightly, but he was nice enough around her, and Spike had taken a liking to him, and he had taken a liking to Spike. <br />
<br />
&quot;Robbie...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Jenny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you... will you come back to the park after your vacation is over? To see me and Spike again?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, er, of course I will! It just I have collage to think about ya know? I like you Jenny! I really do! I'm just kinda unsure about dis whole 'being a buck for the rest of my life' thing. I mean... ya know how we don't feel anything for animals of different species... will... will I still feel anything for you when I'm different? Will you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jenny hadn't seriously thought about that! It made logical sense. And it scared her. &quot;We've only known each other in this shape Robbie... I can't imagine you not as a buck... you just look so right with your antlers not to have them... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn't my question hun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... I think, if you had seen me as a human, you'd have never given me a second look. But I don't think... you'd walk away from me now if I became one, I hope not at least. And... I think if you were there... I wouldn't mind being that human again.&quot; Overweight or not! &quot;It's just... I'm thinking of Spike, these changes come with the species change, and if Spike was made into that man again... I couldn't bear to do that to him.&quot; And Jenny didn't want Spike to feel all alone in a world where he was the only one of his species in his own home. <br />
<br />
&quot;K'... I can understand that but... Jen'... let me give ya my address and number, and ma family's... so if I don't save enough cash to come back here before ya get out... so you can come and see me. Give you and Spike a place to crash.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rex, was keeping an eye on his little sister, was also doing his job as a 'news hound' by getting everyone's reaction to this dramatic event... and he knew Monty's stunt was going to circle in the park for some time... poor guy... must have eaten some bad fruit that resulted in a chemical imbalance in his brain. He was no husky, but as long he kept himself down wind, the herd of deer shouldn't react that badly to his presence. They tolerated Lexy, but Rex didn't want to risk himself getting into the mix. And the fawns weren't in the mix of the adults, so Lexy's scent wasn't on top of them like at the wedding... Rex was going to have a long talk with that girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;So that's it.&quot; John said looking at everyone just -talking- to each other to have a good time, and some food collected for the deer to eat as a form of buffet.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot; Lateisha replied looking to see all was good,  &quot;All our hard work, and in spite of some glitches. Everything worked out. Speaking of which. Excuse for a second dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Dear?' John thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! I know you're here! So come out! I have some things I want to talk to you about!&quot; Lateisha said in a loud clear voice. Getting the attention of some of the nearby deer. <br />
<br />
&quot;I may be a dog, but you're not my Master to call me and excuse me.&quot; Katie said appearing behind Lateisha. <br />
<br />
Lateisha turned around on her hoof, digging into the dirt, &quot;Spare me. I want to know, did you make that lynx go through that act?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can promise you, I, nor any of the huskies, had absolutely positively nothing to do with it, whatever she did, I think she did it on her own.&quot; <br />
<br />
John decided to say nothing, not wanting to get on Lateisha's bad side. <br />
<br />
Lateisha sighed, &quot;All right, fine I believe you, and since Boss Man Jeremy and Boss Lady Leticia both loved it anyway, I'm going to let it slide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand you being loyal to your herd leaders but--&quot; Katie's ears twitched. &quot;I need to go, please, enjoy the park for what time you have left.&quot; <br />
Katie was gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;I plan to.&quot; Lateisha said calmly. <br />
 <br />
&quot;What... did she mean by that?&quot; John asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm leaving the park tomorrow. I'm going back to the monkeys.&quot; She said with a sad smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whao... so... can I see you when I get out too?&quot; <br />
<br />
She smirked at him, &quot;Little boy... you know it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bettina didn't know WHY she felt like it, but she felt like staying behind her newfound sister when they talked to their parents. It was still the strangest thing in the world to see Larry like this. He was the last person on the planet Bettina would have pegged for a TG.. then again... he wasn't a guy pretending to be a girl (or girl in a guy's body as others defended), he had the certified equipment and everything, so was she really a TG? Bettina shook her head, maybe she was just over complicating things. <br />
<br />
Unlike Jeremy's family, Larry's had no clue about Larry's current state until their notice from TF Park USA. Apparently someone in relations called 'Madam J' had requested they be informed and invited for this important event in their child's life. <br />
<br />
To be told your son was now a pregnant deer woman, they were of course skeptical, until they were introduced to the mutant dog people and were allowed to see that these were no Halloween costumes. <br />
<br />
What had surprised everyone was when Larry's grandparents had refused to be de-aged, stubbornly accepting the species change without the modifications. They didn't believe in cheating fate or destiny. It had left the huskies stunned silent. And any anthro who saw them felt that exact same shock. The gene splicer had turned them all into biological ideals, that with the forest offering little to abuse the body, they had been able to mostly keep. To see two evolved animals as -old-, -winkled-, -aged- was the most sobering thing any of them had seen since Maggie's murder attempt on Hannah. <br />
<br />
The elderly deer GLARED at the younger deer around them, visually -daring- them to ask 'why.' If they had to have their DNA violated to see their grandchild finally married off, then damn these perverted corporate pigs to hell they'd let their DNA be violated! But they weren't going to be turned into pretty poster dolls for their 'new you' product that the elderly couple were sure would eventually hit the market for people looking for a way to cheat substance abuse and eating disorders and just plain laziness. <br />
<br />
Leticia, was more shocked to see her grand parents like this than anyone, the arrival of the families had been a smashing surprise. It was weird how naturally they had all accepted it. Maybe cause since they were family, they were automatically part of the herd, so of course they'd be there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Son,&quot; Her father said. He had a humbling small number of horns. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just hear me out. I want you to know, this won't make your life any easier, and this isn't going to automatically bring you happiness being this way. And your responsibilities to everyone won't change either. And.. I'm sorry...no matter what you've let happen to your DNA you'll still be my son.  And I'm proud of you. A coward would have aborted. Would have pretended nothing happened. You made some stupid choices, I'm sorry but you did, but you faced them like a man, and I'm proud to be your father because of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leticia's head swam, not sure how to take what her father had just said to her. Best to be polite to your elders, &quot;Uh, thank you dad.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So is it true Maria's here too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leticia nodded, &quot;Yes. For the novelty, we both agreed to be different genders... she arrived after.. it happened and I and Jeremy were together... we... almost stopped being friends.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Son, you're never going to forget her, ever. Just accept you've made your choice and move on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know dad, and I have. And we hurt each other so badly, I'm just happy we still had a friendship when this was all over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Son, this is your wedding day... this is only the beginning.. or the end of all things... though given your position, I suppose you got out of that one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey!&quot; Leticia's mother snapped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry dear.&quot; <br />
<br />
Leticia's mother now had her say, &quot;So sweetie, we is Maria then?&quot; The girl had been rough around the edges, but always a nice lass. <br />
<br />
&quot;He's called Marth now and... I think that's him... over there?&quot; Leticia looked clear across the reception, to see Marth and Hannah.. TALKING... like CIVILIZED deer! It made Leticia a little dizzy, but also, a little happy that Marth too, had finally be able to move on too. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's Maria?&quot; Her mother said, &quot;Who'd have thought it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't that the buck who gave you away at the wedding? Yes we were spying.&quot; <br />
<br />
Leticia let out a nervous laugh, &quot;Well it is the running joke around here. The most manly men used to be girls, and the most girlie girls used to be boys.&quot; <br />
<br />
Her grandfather looked her up and down indifferently, &quot;You don't say.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bettina looked to her left, and to her right. She was naked, so was everyone else, and the ratio of bucks to does was the opposite of what it was in nature. This was either going to be really fun or really awful. <br />
<br />
Seeing Leticia talking with her family about who knows what, Marth looked back at Hannah and said the first thing that came to mind, &quot;Hannah, how long before that shot wears off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah was started by the answer, but heard herself say, &quot;I don't know, I'd have to ask the huskies... why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just... curious... that's all.&quot; Marth said not sure of the answer himself. <br />
<br />
Hannah brought up a grim subject, &quot;You know you're going to have to fight them eventually, the other bucks.. you're a random factor until you do.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I'm going to be here for quite some time yet... you think I can turn it into an after wedding show?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marth...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to do it sooner or later... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise... I'm NOT taking Lady Leticia as my mate if I somehow manage to climb all the way up to Lord Jeremy... it's just... maybe now that I'm a guy... and gonna be one for a while... I wanna see how I measure up.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me.&quot; Marth and Hannah turned to the tall intelligent looking buck who had been talking to Boss Man Jeremy. Drake was besides him, looking at the two. &quot;You're Hannah 'Doe' right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's me.&quot; Hannah said politely.<br />
<br />
The buck bowed slightly, &quot;I'm Marcus Enders, Jeremy's father, and Maggie's husband.&quot; Marth and Hannah both tensed up at the mention of the bear. &quot;She had a message for you Miss Hannah. She said, she's sorry. She's sorry for mistaking you for Leticia, she's sorry for doing what she did, she's sorry for the trouble she caused, she's sorry for the damage she did, she doesn't expect your forgiveness, she only wants you to know, she apologizes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Expecting penance from that towering grizzly had been the last thing Hannah had ever expected, she didn't know how to take it. Marth just looked at the older buck darkly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I'm going to need time to think about this but... thanks for telling me Sir Marcus.&quot; Hannah bowed back at him, he WAS the father of the herd leader, and he was certainly more deserving of the respect than Maggie was for all appearances. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome Miss Hannah.&quot; Marcus bowed back. <br />
<br />
Wether Lateisha had heard Marth's intent to find his place in the herd, or it was simply random chance (yeah right!), Lateisha and John quickly announced it was time for the dances. <br />
<br />
'You can begin your slow climb up the ladder for the amusement of the does soon enough Marth.' Leteisha thought. <br />
<br />
 True, the ladies to men ratio was off, but with Jeremy in charge carrying on Sam's will, the bucks knew better than not to be gentlemen.  Plus, John and Lateisha had managed to come up with a few 'ritual' style dances all their own for everyone to follow along with. With Jeremy and Leticia of course leading in front and into center. <br />
<br />
Much like the wedding kiss, this also enforced the idea that all the deer there (new comers and short stayers included), were all part of the herd, part of the same herd, and couldn't be anything else. They were deer, they were all together, they were a herd.<br />
<br />
Jeremy lead, and the buck responded, not thinking anything of it. Leticia led, and the does responded, knowing internally it was only proper to do so. <br />
<br />
Jeremy and Leticia's family too took part in this dance, first they were slightly confused, then alarmed, then a wave of calm and acceptance, followed by a sense of unity and submission to their child, cousin, or sibling's lead, quickly finding the idea of not doing so alien. <br />
<br />
The primates, are one of the few species that considered the elders not to be dead weight in a community, with taking care of offspring to be a twenty four job often. Other other mammals had no such sympathies, let alone most other animals. However, the cultural ingrain of 'honor thy mother and father' of human culture, fought with this intensely. Perhaps more intensely than anything else. <br />
<br />
When everything was said and done, the elderly deer simply followed pace as best they could along with the rest of their herd, (knowing that was what they were, the rhythm of the dance flowing into their minds), their fawn long since having out grown them, ready to help them in an instant should they stumble, fall or trip: something no non-sentient , four-legged deer would ever do. <br />
<br />
Lateisha didn't once try to fight it. Accept she was a part of the herd, part of the whole. This was the twilight day of her existence as a doe, and when the day dawned tomorrow, the huskies would come for her at the same hour she had originally entered the park, and that would be that. It strangely felt like death, but like any creature of nature, she felt strangely no fear when she knew it was coming and she knew there was a world much larger than this one beyond. <br />
<br />
Even the fawns found themselves submitting the dance of the herd leaders without so much thought. Spike feeling proud beyond words to be part of the herd. The two new fawns felt weird, funny almost, but the dance was so nice, and so friendly, and it felt good to just go with the flow and let it carry them away, so away. <br />
<br />
 Lexy, feeling nothing from this display, merely stood back and watched with curiosity and mild interest of any cat, amused at watching her play mate imitate the grown ups. <br />
<br />
And in this dance, following her herd mistress, Jenny let her human self image melt away from the force of the hoof beats and the power of her own motions. <br />
<br />
Su Yin had missed her chance to be part of this great unity, and while it tugged at the back of her mind like a fundamental need, the sentient part of her evolved deer brain was able to override it. <br />
<br />
She and the Father were having a civilized discussion. Something Su Yin admitted she had naively believed that you couldn't have with a religious person. She had also expected the Father to go into 'you shall burn in Hell' phrases as soon as she tried to poke and probe his point of view. When he responded in a polite manner, it had thrown Su Yin off enough she had almost given into the urge to RUN down tot he herd and join in the dance before it was too late to be a part of it and the whole.  <br />
<br />
But Su Yin stood her ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you don't see the theory of evolution as contrary to the story of creation?&quot; Su Yin did her best not to say 'myth.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the least. It was in six of god's days, not ours. And let there be light: 'big bang.' And humans in both cases came late into the picture along the rest of the mammals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deciding she'd need access to her note on the subject to discuss this properly she decided on a more hands on discussion, &quot;So you really consider us still human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you consider Leticia still male then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Souls don't have genders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you believe they have species?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Being human has never been about species, or at least in the sense you're thinking of. Or maybe, person and human have become intermingled as terms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said before it was 'God's ability to love' that makes us human. Are you saying mundane animals don't have that ability to love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That.. and the fact human being as a rule are able to learn right and wrong, and even after learning that, are able to go either way.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;So what if a mundane animal was given this treatment then? Made like us? Would they be human?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That, my dear child, is a very good question.&quot; Father Tyminski nodded kindly. &quot;But remember. If a child was aged to a thirty year old man, he'd still be innocent, immature, and ignorant of many things. And a man who becomes a child, would be the oddest sight you could ever behold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Spike?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe... that he just needed a chance where he didn't think he needed to surround his heart with his name sakes... and for someone to show him kindness.&quot; <br />
<br />
Su Yin looked at the afternoon sky, still feeling the dance pulling at the back of her brain 'Maybe this will be the day I end my book on.' <br />
<br />
Zack once again stayed with the predators to insure nothing violent broke out among the various natural killing machines restrained by the power of culture, he felt rather left out as Harry chose to follow the panther Chris since she was a yellow flag. Never before had Zack CURSED the fact that anthros of different species didn't find each other sexually attractive. He had dozens of naked ladies around him and not one of them could see him as long as he kept his wits about him and kept his focus! And the others were all watching the deer... still, orders were orders. And Zack didn't want to suffer at another of Naomi's patented humiliations... once had been more than enough. His ears wilted at the mere thought of it. <br />
<br />
So he settled listening to the wolves proudly boast that no matter how much the deer built themselves up, they would never come close to matching the sense of community and family that the wolf pack shared. After all, the deer just ran away together, the wolf pack ran together. <br />
<br />
The huskies at the reception in a circle around the bucks watched, almost as if they were entranced like the deer. It was an odd sight. Like they were beholding the rituals of a lost tribe, rather than a bunch of vacation goers having a good time. <br />
<br />
Katie had to pulled Jessica back twice least the newbie get stomped on by a dancing deer. Girl was almost as curious as a cat. Katie had been told that their yellow flag was on the move and to keep an eye out for her just in case. <br />
<br />
The twins meanwhile, had been calculating on the perfect time to confront Jeremy, Leticia, Drake, and Hannah, about the great marriage contract they would sign that would make their marriage recognized in the outside world as much as it was in the park. <br />
<br />
The twins looked at each other and knew, as soon as the dance was over, that would be their opportunity. And made a point they would signal Pack Leader Naomi as soon as they were ready.  As to be expected, nobody took what Monty said or did seriously. And then Leticia could be Leticia legally, and the union between the two herd leaders could exist legally. As huskies, every last member of the security emergency team understood the need for order within the pack. And that the monkeys held the power of written words in very very high respect. <br />
<br />
As Chris the blue vixen dreamed of a life of stardom by signing a contract with Nintendo of America to be their new poster girl, Chris the panther followed Monty's trail. Truly, the hunt, even one where she wasn't truly seeking prey. Made Chris feel at ease, and made her fears that she'd lose her male self forever by the time she left her park seem more distant as well. She had also quickly built up a rather large amount of confidence on her skills of stealth and tracking. Certain there was nothing that could hide from her, and nothing she could not hide from. She shifted to all fours, and the young female panther who knew she was supposed to be male followed the scent of the crazy odd animal. <br />
<br />
A fairly short distance behind her, Keith and Jackie, the male and female panthers, followed the young female panther with painful ease, avoiding her senses being even easier. The young panther still had a LOT to learn about stalking and being stalked the female panther observed. The mother doe had thanked them for helping her fawn, and they had expressed their approval at the lack of fear her fawn had shown in the face of predators. A rare trait in prey. Even prey that was not prey. They had chosen to check on the fawn. But when the young panther had started out on her own, they had decided to follow her instead, to make sure another disaster did not occur with her as had before. And truth to be told, the panthers never felt so whole, so together, so much like one rather than two while they stalked. It made them feel alive. <br />
During these instances though, the male panther made sure to ALWAYS take lead, and never ever allowed any debate on the subject. Yes she had a right to hunt. But he would not allow her to take any unnecessary risks, not with the next generation sleeping in her belly. He could never forgive himself if something like that was to happen. A true non-two legged panther would just know another litter could be made. But the sentient part of the male panther's mind knew, that each life in his mate's belly was precious beyond worth. <br />
<br />
It was honestly a subconscious fear of the female panther that her kitten would be born with Anencephaly, or some other beyond awful deformity that would make life for them impossible. The female panther doubted that these monkeys had been planning on kittens when they altered them into what they were now. All the more reason, the female panther knew, they were bound to this forest until their kittens were born, any number of medical complications could arise, and these monkeys ultimately, knew more about the two-legged panthers than anyone else. <br />
<br />
On top of all of this, Harry followed them all like a ninja, doing his duty to the park and his pack. And all things aside, not only was Chris a yellow flag, Jackie was pregnant, and that meant she was a top priority to protect and look out for. <br />
<br />
Chris followed Monty's scent, she wondered why she hadn't developed the natural immunity to boredom that all the other evolved animals had. Was it cause she was new? Or was it because the gene splicer had screwed up with her somehow? It would explain why she wasn't mindlessly declaring herself to be female and only female like all the other males in the park who had their Y chromosome confiscated at the door. Maybe that immunity boredom was part of the appeal of the part Chris thought, that ability to accept your existence and have that be that. Personally though, Chris preferred to evolve. <br />
<br />
Chris had been told by Keith and Jackie that the prey species of the park had a natural fear of the predators, something that happened in spite of all sentient thought. When Chris came face to face with a herd of deer, all dancing in some crazy ritual, Chris was actually the one who felt scared! She actually took several steps back! (And still didn't pick up on the male and female panthers right behind her). <br />
<br />
They looked like a single entity, a wheel oiled machine, one animal that looked like it could trample her into the ground if she caused trouble! Chris actually felt small, and felt the desire for other panthers if nothing else than just safety in numbers! <br />
<br />
Chris shook her head, the sooner she got away from this beast dance the better, and quickly continued to follow Monty's scent, not looking back the herd in the least, which made no sign that it had noticed him, or perhaps, it had noticed him, and didn't think she was worth bothering about! <br />
<br />
Unsettled by the sight as well but nearly as much as Chris, the hunting partners continued to shadow the inexperienced hunter. <br />
<br />
When Monty had made his declaration, his motley crew knew better than to follow him. When Monty was like this, he didn't want his buddies' help. His fellow conspiracy nuts composed of various predator and prey species, merely awaited what their founder would tell them. And learn exactly what it was that the park was keeping from their and how they could escape being used in their evil plains. Archie had never been an in-depth member of their group and thus no really felt the urge to see him off. Thus the motley crew spent their waiting time simply playing Sudoku (drawn in the dirt and on the cave wall by their local mind wizard) and discussing Kenndy, Rosewell, 9/11, and the moon landing. <br />
<br />
The husky with Archie merely looked at the giant squirrel. Oh well, not everyone could be a repeat customer or have their lives changed by a visit to the park. There were those who would enter and leave with no sense of fellowship, or appreciation for the monkeys, or new affinity for nature.  People like Archie come into park, and left, like leaves on the wind.  The one with nature motif just wasn't for everyone in the end. <br />
<br />
Juanita had enough wits about her before following on her course of action to write several notes to her fellow board members that she would be gone for a while, giving no other reason than family (not a precise lie given the mentality of the pack). Some of the members didn't mind not having her in their hair for a while. Others were upset she hadn't given more notice or a more detailed explanation. While still others were honestly worried about her current state of being. And not one of the members of the Management, even in their dreams, thought to check out the newest husky who each was sure someone else had signed the contract with. Human indifference could be a useful thing to those who knew how to use it right. Not even Mr. M, ever even amused the notion, that the newest husky to appear that morning, Jessica, could ever be Juanita. <br />
<br />
Monty arrived at the park entrance building, the only way in or out for any guest. If not for the fact every park member entered through it, no one would have taken it to be anything more than a mossy beige rock face. Monty was sure this was so when They erased all the guest's memories they'd have no idea how to leave when They turned everyone in the park into an international zoo. <br />
<br />
Faced with greater and greater contradictions to how he saw the world, Monty nearly went wild, screaming, banging and clawing at the rock face with almost as much intensity as Chris had before him. No one really paid attention to him at first. But as he kept up his ranting and raving, seemingly without end or stopping for breath, and continued to use his small claws to tear at the rock surface to get at the building underneath to the point where his fingers and toes were starting to bleed, the huskies knew action to be taken. After all, Monty had never harmed anyone, nor had tried to, and was a legitimate guest (like Spike was) and hadn't forced his way in like Maggie had. And he kept the lesser conspiracy nuts out of trouble by giving them a focus point. <br />
<br />
That was when Katie (and thus naturally Jessica), had been called away from watching the deer's self invented right of passage to attend to him. Naomi, hoping the twins hadn't forgotten their orders, reacting to her low opinion of males in general, decided to observe things personally, and Monty had always rubbed her the wrong way anyway. <br />
<br />
Katie and Jessica let themselves been seen by Monty close to either side of him. This was a mistake. Monty turned around at then and look more fierce than the legendary species of snake killers had a right to. &quot;You won't get me! I'll find the truth! And I'll expose it to everyone! You can't and won't win! You can't hide the truth forever!&quot; <br />
<br />
Katie did her best to be formal, &quot;Mr. Monty Mongoose, we're worried about it. Your... opinions have always been well known, but you've never been this violent... what's wrong? Let us help you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU KEEP AWAY! You're in with Them! You're part of the conspiracy! You and every one of you damn dogs!&quot; <br />
<br />
That was almost enough for Naomi to come out of hiding herself and beat the stupid mongoose witless for insulting her pack! <br />
<br />
Jessica with her arms at her side being her best to look non-threatening and submissive took a step towards him. &quot;Look, I've only been on field duty for a day, but I can promise you that the park isn't out to turn people into zoo animals, robot soldiers, harvest organs, or expensive pets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; Monty pointed, &quot;Likely story!  For all I know, you part of the conspiracy's inner circle altered into one of the lower minions to keep a close eye on things so your plans don't go haywire! You could even have had your memories altered so even you don't know!&quot; Even a broken clock is right twice a day folks. <br />
<br />
 &quot;That's just stupid!&quot; Katie snapped back, &quot;You're being silly!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Inner circle?&quot; Jessica blinked, &quot;You mean the Management? You're crazy! I am NOT part of the Management and I wouldn't WANT to be part of the Management! They're not out to conquer the world or turn people into zombie slaves like you've convinced yourself, but they're a collection of corporate bastards who are only interested in their own goals! If your stupid theory was true, which it ISN'T, then I'm HAPPY I got my memories of being part of the Management erased and I hope I never get them back! I'm happy being part of the pack! That's what counts.&quot; Naomi heard everything, but said nothing. &quot;And I have to ask you, are you really happy doing this? Is doing this to yourself what makes you happy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Weather I'm happy or not doesn't matter! I'm out to find the truth! And that'll be enough! Being happy is secondary in seeking truth! It's not weather you're happy it's weather you've reached the goal you've set for yourself or not!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie was dually impressed. Jessica had gotten Monty from reaching himself apart trying to get inside the entrance building, and seemed to be slowly getting his mind off of his latest conspiracy. Now if the two of them could just convince him the two of them weren't a threat, they could get him to calm down enough to stop this stupidity before he got hurt. <br />
<br />
In that moment however, Chris' novice talents as a hunter came back to haunt everyone as she tripped, broke several twigs, and altered everyone that she was there, which happened to right near Monty, and made a second mistake by quickly standing him. The male and female panther rushed to her side to see if she was all right, startling her with alarm which came across as a small panther call. Katie's eyes went wide. <br />
<br />
&quot;Assassins! I knew it!!!&quot; Monty screamed at the top of his lungs, charging at the perceived corporate assassins, determined to go down fighting. <br />
<br />
Chris' mind registered: male, shouting, coming straight at her, nasty look in his eyes. She unsheathed her claws without even thinking about it. It was one of those times that seemed to crawl to slow motion like a bad movie. Monty's knowledge of martial arts was limited to kung-fu movies. Chris had belts to her name. Monty was convinced Chris was there to silence him for getting too close to the truth. Chris' brain was reacting on previous experience with males in the park. She was going to totally and utterly disembowel him, he'd be dead before he hit the ground. <br />
<br />
Harry was moving only as fast as a husky like him could, as was Naomi, but even she wasn't quite fast enough, she'd make it in just enough to catch Monty's corpse. Katie felt like she was paralyzed, she was moving too slowly, Naomi would never forgive her for this! <br />
<br />
The blink of an eye, Jessica was between the two on-coming forces, she had just enough time to look Monty in the eyes, and then turn to delivery a powerful kick to Chris' stomach before hammering her with several palm strikes with the finale strike on her lower jaw sending her spinning backwards onto her tail with the sound of impact. <br />
<br />
Everyone stopped moving. Jessica breathing hard as she looked at Chris, making sure Chris hadn't accident bitten through her own tongue. &quot;Sorry... &quot; She blowed at the still floored panthers, &quot;I was pretty sure that words weren't going to work here.&quot; And if she had beaten up Monty, that would have made things with him even worse. <br />
<br />
&quot;You... saved me...&quot; Monty said confused out of his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I saved you.&quot; Jessica said sternly looking back at him. <br />
<br />
Keith and Jackie got up off of all fours and helped Chris to her feet, &quot;Where were you?&quot; Chris said looking at them slightly dazed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Following you, if you're going to visit the park for long, you need to improve your hunting skills.&quot; Keith said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Chris said, still dizzy from the thrashing that the husky had given her. She looked at her, &quot;Nice moves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I mean seriously, that was cool.&quot; Chris meant to continue to ask 'could you show me to your teacher?', but Chris however stayed quite after that until the forest stopped spinning. <br />
<br />
Jessica hadn't expected COMPLIMENTS from the CAT she had just beaten up. Confused, but blushing she repeated herself, &quot;Thank you.&quot; <br />
<br />
There were at least twenty times today that Katie had had to stop Jessica from doing something stupid... and TWICE in one day the newest newbie had just prevented a major league disaster. Katie almost felt grateful that Naomi had saddled the pup on her! <br />
<br />
'Sure didn't see that coming.' Harry thought deciding wisely like Naomi not to add fuel to fire by appearing out of nowhere. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; For the first time since coming to the park, Monty didn't listen to his paranoid side, &quot;Miss. I... I apologize for accusing you for being part of the park's management.&quot; And thus Monty effective let go of his one theory that wasn't a red herring. <br />
<br />
&quot;Apology  accepted.&quot; the newbie husky said politely, &quot;And my name is Jessica. Nice to meet you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Monty hesitated, &quot;I clearly have miscalculated on some things... I'm going to have to do some thinking... but don't you dare think that means I've given up on finding out the truth about this park! Just wait and see!&quot; Monty was still Monty. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be glade to hear it when you do.&quot; Jessica put a paw on the mongoose' shoulder. <br />
<br />
Monty's situation had been defused without a grand disaster... and Naomi had almost been hoping to give the conspiracy  mongoose the Spike treatment. <br />
<br />
&quot;As for you,&quot; Jackie said to Chris helping her lean on her shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to teach you the finer point of stalking boyo.&quot; Keith finished helping Chris lean on his shoulder as well. <br />
<br />
Chris sighed. <br />
<br />
Knowing she had some things to think about and a wedding contract to oversee, Naomi sped away like a shadow. Harry stayed unseen keeping an eye on Chris though he felt it was mostly unneeded now he did have his orders. <br />
<br />
No one thought to offer medical aid to Chris since her injuries were neither crippling nor life threatening. Resisting the urge to go on all fours, the senior panthers helped Chris back to Predator Hill, where her father was determined to either find a she bear, or be rejected by the entire female bear population trying. <br />
<br />
Katie and Jessica followed Monty for a while. The newbie and the mongoose managing to have a rather civilized and lively discussion before the two huskies decided to make themselves unseen. They followed Monty for a short while, then stopped shadowing him once they were both fully certain Monty's reprieve wasn't just a performance. Monty was many things, good actor wasn't one of them. <br />
<br />
All the while, the deer danced. Not mindlessly so, but each one absorbed into the sense of unity the whole gave them. Their human selves feeling like ghosts, and the infinitely world of humanity outside their comparatively tiny park feeling like a dream. Obediently and loyally they followed the pace set by their two herd leaders. And so as one the herd danced.</p>
