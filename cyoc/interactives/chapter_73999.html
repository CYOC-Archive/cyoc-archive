<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My brother Scott.  “Finally got here,” he said.  “You wouldn’t believe how much trouble I had just trying to <br />
get some beer.”  He carried two large boxes with him, one which was bottles, and the other which was cans.  He <br />
didn’t need to be invited in, so he just carried them straight to the kitchen.  <br />
<br />
“Glad you finally got here,” I said.  “Pam’s already here.  Have you ever met Rachel?” I asked.<br />
<br />
Scott caught sight of her.  “No, I’d remember you,” he said to her.  “Pleasure to meet you.”<br />
<br />
“So you’re the great Scott I’ve heard so much about?” Rachel asked him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, stop kidding,” he said.  “This idiot never talks about me.”<br />
<br />
“Sure he does,” Rachel contradicted.<br />
<br />
Scott said, “I’m sure it’s all of the ‘Scott resents our parents for spoiling Pam and not paying enough <br />
attention to him’ variety, isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
“N-no?” Rachel both stammered and questioned.<br />
<br />
“Well it should be, because it’s true,” Scott laughed.  “That’s OK, Pam’s generally a sweetheart.”<br />
<br />
“Yea, she finally admitted it to me,” I told him.<br />
<br />
“Admitted what?” Scott asked.<br />
<br />
“You know,” I said.<br />
<br />
Scott looked at me curiously.  “She told me that a while ago, bro,” he said.  “You didn’t know?”<br />
<br />
“I suspected,” I said.  “But I didn’t know for sure.”<br />
<br />
“I just asked her once,” he said.  “She didn’t hide it.  What does it matter, we’re all gonna be lesbians <br />
soon, am I right?”<br />
<br />
“You sound like you’re more accepting of this now,” I said.<br />
<br />
He nodded.  “What’s the point of whining about it?” he said.  “But let me show you something, too,” he added.  <br />
He took off his ball cap and showed me something quite different for him.  Scott had unfortunately been <br />
afflicted by the bald gene.  Though he was only 26 his hairline had clearly begun to recede.  However the <br />
spots on his head that had already lost their hair were now covered in hair follicles.  “No more worrying <br />
about being bald for me!” he said.<br />
<br />
Pam walked into the kitchen and glimpsed our brother’s head.  “You’re growing hair!  Isn’t it great?” she <br />
exclaimed.  She walked over and hugged him.<br />
<br />
“I suppose it is,” he said.  Scott made a weird face and lifted his feet off the ground one at a time.  “I <br />
need to sit down,” he said.  He sat in one of the chairs at the kitchen table and proceeded to scratch at his <br />
ankles, just above his shoes.  Then he removed both his shoes and then both of his socks.  “Yikes, these <br />
things are killing me,” he said as he picked up his socks from the ground.  He put his shoes back on, however.  <br />
<br />
Rachel looked at me knowingly.  “You know what,” she said.  “Give those to me.”  Scott handed her the socks.  <br />
She ran out of the room and the three of us followed her into the living room.  Rachel went into the spare <br />
room and retrieved Pam’s bra, then went into my room and grabbed my boxers.  She came back into the living <br />
room and picked up Joyce’s skirt, then her own sneakers.  She took all of the clothes and then simply dumped <br />
them in a pile on the living room floor.<br />
<br />
“What’s up with that?” Scott asked.<br />
<br />
“We’ve all just felt like not wearing a piece of clothing at some point today,” Rachel said.  “You took off <br />
your socks, I took off my shoes, your brother took off his boxers, your sister took off her bra, and my friend <br />
Joyce here took off her skirt.  Oh, you haven’t met Joyce yet.”<br />
<br />
Joyce stood up from the couch.  “Hi, I’m Joyce.  You must be Scott,” she said.  She walked toward Scott and <br />
offered her hand.  Scott, however, was taken aback when he saw Joyce in all her glory without her skirt.  He <br />
could not help but stare at her exposed womanhood.  “Yea, that’s part of me, too,” Joyce said.<br />
<br />
Scott snapped out of his trance and shook Joyce’s hand.  “Oh, um, uh…sorry, it’s just…”  His voice trailed off <br />
but Joyce waited for him to finish.  “I’m an idiot, is all.  You’re very pretty.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you’re sweet,” Joyce said.  “And you’re not an idiot, believe me.”  Then she leaned in close to him and <br />
whispered something that no one else could hear.  Whatever she said caused Scott to laugh like an idiot would.  <br />
She leaned back and said, “No promises, mind you.”<br />
<br />
We all sat down in the living room.  The women again occupied the couch, I went back to the armchair and Scott <br />
became the first person to sit on the new couch.  I turned back to the news to see if there were any further <br />
updates.  <br />
<br />
“Hey, look at that!” said Rachel.  “The anchor isn’t wearing his tie or jacket.”  Indeed he was not.  <br />
<br />
I switched to another channel.  A male and a female anchor sat behind a news desk.  “Whoa, look at that,” said <br />
Joyce.  “She is not wearing a bra.”<br />
<br />
“How can you tell?” Scott asked.<br />
<br />
“You can see her nipples poking through shirt,” Joyce explained.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” he said.  He then glanced at Pam, then back at the news anchor, then back to Pam, and then back to the <br />
anchor again.  “Yea, now I see it.”<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Pam complained while she put her arms in front of her chest.<br />
<br />
“Calm down,” he said.  “I’m going to have them soon, too, remember.”  Pam still frowned at him.<br />
<br />
“So is everyone ignoring the fact that the guy has on a tie, but no shirt?” I asked.  <br />
<br />
“Not me,” said Rachel.  “I was looking to see if he had nice pecs.  But…he doesn’t.”  She laughed at her own <br />
remark.<br />
<br />
“Why is this happening?” asked Pam.  “Why are people doing that?”<br />
<br />
“Well why did you take off your bra?” I asked her.<br />
<br />
“I…I just didn’t feel like wearing it,” she answered.  “I guess.  I don’t know, really.”<br />
<br />
I decided to advance the notion.  “It must have been that,” I said.  “That’s why I took off my boxers.”<br />
<br />
Rachel chimed in, “That’s why I took off my shoes.”<br />
<br />
Soon we were all in agreement that we just felt like removing the clothing we had and that it was the sensible <br />
thing to do.  We also agreed that if other people wanted to do the same, they should as well.<br />
<br />
We spent the next ten minutes or so switching around to other live news shoes and saw other people with <br />
various bits of clothing removed.  As of yet there was no one going bottomless, and there were no signs of <br />
naked breasts.  I had to smile in anticipation of that happening.<br />
<br />
Another knock came on the door.  “Must be Carl,” I said.  Rachel and I walked to answer the door.</p>
