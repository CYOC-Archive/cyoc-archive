<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You really think that thing&#39;ll work?&quot; Nikki giggled as Jessica finished setting up the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Jessica shrugged, &quot;It&#39;ll be worth a laugh no matter what and it&#39;s better than just sitting around being bored.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suit yourself, I&#39;m going to have a snack while you mess around with that thing,&quot; Nikki started to head to the kitchen, &quot;Just tell me when you&#39;ve got it figured out and I&#39;ll come check it out if it&#39;s anything interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the kitchen Nikki got a bowl and a box of cereal out of the cabinet and then went to the fridge. They had planned on going grocery shopping that day so cereal was really the only option available for her that morning unless she wanted to go through far more trouble to actually make something from scratch. Since she was off from work that day and felt like being lazy cereal was really the only option as far as she was concerned, or it would have been had they had any milk. Shaking her head she closed the fridge, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me we were out of milk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, don&#39;t worry,&quot; Jessica laughed, &quot;That won&#39;t be a problem for long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki rolled her eyes. Of course it wouldn&#39;t be a problem once they went shopping, but she wanted breakfast now, not later. Sure she could always eat the cereal dry, but then she might as well be eating cardboard. Grumbling to herself about the lack of food, she returned to looking through the cabinets to see if there was anything she had overlooked. Jessica was so immature sometimes, putting things off until the last minute and getting herself distracted with silly computer games.<br />
<br />
As she bent down to look in the lower cabinets her arm brushed against her chest and she felt a shiver run through her. Something felt a little off, but she was unable to put her finger on it, not yet at least.<br />
<br />
Giving up on her search of the cabinets, she stood up and stretched, feeling her bra tight against her chest, pressing against her nipples in a way that made them tingle. Without thinking she rubbed at her breasts, feeling their warm weight through her shirt, noting the way her nipples perked up. She ran a finger over one, feeling its hardness. Wow her breasts felt sensitive today, she could actually feel the pressure of her bra against them, especially against her nipples.<br />
<br />
Still determined to get at least something in her stomach before they went shopping she went over to the fridge thinking that she might as well have a glass of orange juice. With each step she took she became more and more aware of the feeling of tightness in her chest, of a building pressure that was almost painful. She could actually feel her breasts bouncing as she moved, the tingling in her nipples intensifying to a dull throb, not exactly unpleasant.<br />
<br />
She let out a little gasp as she reached for the fridge door as her breasts shifted slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay in there?&quot; Jessica asked with a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m - ooh,&quot; Nikki struggled to stifle a moan. The tingling in her nipples, which each felt as sensitive as her clit, was spreading through out her breasts, accompanied by a rush of warmth, &quot;I&#39;m not feeling so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abandoning the kitchen, she rushed to her room, trying to ignore the way her running made her breasts bounce heavily against her chest.<br />
<br />
Once safely in her room, she pulled off her shirt and let out a sigh of relief at the feeling of cool air against her breasts. She looked down, seeing how her pink, perky little nipples tented her bra, straining against the smooth fabric which suddenly felt too tight. More than that, her nipples looked larger, sticking out farther than they ever had before. Gingerly she rubbed them though the silky fabric, feeling their hardness. Hands shaking, she took off her bra.<br />
<br />
Free of her bra her b-cup breasts rested heavily against her chest. Aside from the strange sensations, there was something off about them. Was it her imagination or did they look more round, maybe larger? Nikki cupped them in her hands, gently massaging them as she tested their weight. The tingling abated slightly under her ministrations, replaced by intense pleasure, especially when she ran her fingers over her nipples. She gave one a gentle tug and felt a rush of warmth flood her pussy. That simple touch felt so right, so good, that she was starting to get turned on.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on her bed she continued to massage her breasts, giving special attention to her nipples, savoring the way each little tug sent another thrill of pleasure through her. The sensations seemed centered around her nipples, so that was where she focused most of her attention, gasping and squirming with how good it felt. Impossible as it seemed, she was on the verge of orgasm from playing with her breasts alone. She could feel little tremors running through her pussy, a wonderful tension building in her stomach, though try as she might she could not quite get there with what she was doing.<br />
<br />
She took one hand from her breasts and slid it down into her sodden panties to caress her clit as she kneaded her breasts and tugged at her nipples. Her heart raced and her breasts throbbed with pleasure, heat building in them as she writhed and moaned on the bed, yet for all her efforts she found herself unable to reach climax. There was something missing and no matter how she rubbed her clit or massaged her breasts she was unable to find it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Jessica called out from the other side of the door, causing Nikki to freeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;I..uh...,&quot; the urgent need to pleasure herself began to fade, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m good. Give me a minute and we can get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking several deep breaths Nikki waited for her racing pulse to calm down before she got up. Her breasts ached from all the attention she had given them and her nipples felt hot and sore. Once the feeling had mostly passed she got up and put on her bra, a shiver running through her as the fabric rubbed against her nipples. She then spent a moment adjusting it. Tender as her breasts were, the article of clothing felt too tight, too constraining, the straps and band digging into her soft, weighty breasts. Next she put on her shirt, which also felt tighter than normal due to how sensitive her breasts were. There was something strange about the whole situation, but she couldn&#39;t quite figure out what.<br />
<br />
Once she was dressed she opened the door, where Jessica greeted her with a smile, &quot;Feeling a bit of a chill, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Nikki blurted out, then followed Jessica&#39;s gaze down to her chest, where her nipples, still erect, were tenting the fabric of her shirt, &quot;Oh...&quot;<br />
<br />
That was odd. Nikki never remembered anything like that happening before, though the whole morning had been rather odd considering her spontaneous bout of arousal. Self consciously she brushed her hands against her chest which only made it worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Jessica laughed, &quot;Let&#39;s get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two friends hopped into Jessica&#39;s car.<br />
<br />
It took Nikki a few minutes to get comfortable. For some reason her breasts still seemed more sensitive than normal and the seatbelt seemed to be pressing more tightly against her chest. Jessica watched with a small smile as she tried to asjust the strap, first moving it up across her chest where it rubbed her uncomfortable and then down below her breasts where it felt like it was digging into them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having trouble?&quot; <br />
<br />
Nikki rolled her eyes, &quot;I&#39;ve got no clue what&#39;s wrong with me today. It&#39;s like my breasts are trying to drive me crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you need a new bra,&quot; Jessica suggested a bit too quickly.<br />
<br />
Nikki looked at her suspiciously, &quot;Did you do something to my bras or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jessica snickered, &quot;Nothing to your bras. I just think you might need a new bra, that&#39;s all. The one you&#39;ve got now might be getting a little tight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now that Jessica mentioned it, Nikki&#39;s bra did feel uncomfortable, especially at the bottom and sides, like it was digging into her breasts. She shifted in her seat again, feeling the way her breasts rested against her chest. It also seemed like she wasn&#39;t getting enough support. Still, it was strange for Jessica to be making a suggestion like that, &quot;Okay, what gives?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica looked away, having the convenient excuse of needing to keep her eyes on thee road, &quot;Nothing. Nothing at all. I just want to go to the mall for a bit before we go grocery shopping.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was pure Jessica right there. Nikki sighed and slumped down, wincing when Jessica hit a pothole causing the car and her increasingly tender feeling breasts to bounce.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid crappy roads,&quot; Nikki grumbled after two more potholes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Jessica grumbled, &quot;If I get a flat tire I&#39;ll be so pissed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luckily the rest of the trip was relatively smooth and they got safely to the mall. As soon as they were in the parking lot Nikki unbuckled her seat belt and squirmed around, trying and failing to get comfortable. For some reason her nipples had been hard the whole trip and the way they were pressing against her bra was starting to get painful. She tried to adjust her bra with little success and when Jessica parked and hopped out of the car Nikki lingered for a few minutes, struggling with her tender breasts. No matter what she tried she was unable to get her bra to fit comfortably, though massaging her chest soothed the discomfort slightly.<br />
<br />
Giving up on being able to do anything there she got out of the car and gave Jessica an embarrassed little smile, &quot;I&#39;m going to need to go to the bathroom before we go shopping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Jessica gave her a huge smile, &quot;I&#39;m not in any hurry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki certainly was, though she regretted it, for when she took off at a jog her breasts bounced painfully, forcing her to slow down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got no idea what&#39;s wrong with me,&quot; Nikki complained, &quot;My breasts are seriously driving me crazy today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica shrugged, &quot;Well, if your bra isn&#39;t giving you the support you need...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It fine yesterday,&quot; Nikki snapped, &quot;Unless you were messing with it between then and now my bra isn&#39;t a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t mess with your bra, honest,&quot; Jessica said defensively, &quot;I&#39;m just saying that breasts like yours might need a little extra support?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot; Nikki folded her arms across her chest, pressing down on her breasts in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just saying that you might be bigger than you think you are,&quot; was Jessica&#39;s cryptic comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please,&quot; Nikki snorted, &quot;A b-cup isn&#39;t that big.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica raised an eyebrow, &quot;You really think you&#39;re a b-cup?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been one since I started college and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve grown since then,&quot; Nikki said as she moved her arms slightly, trying to get comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Jessica laughed, &quot;Those look like they&#39;re a c-cup at least! No, I take that back, they might be even bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki looked down at her chest and frowned. There was something obviously wrong with her breasts, they stuck out farther than she remembered and her nipples were still rock hard and as impossible as it seemed, they looked bigger than she remembered, &quot;This isn&#39;t funny Jessica.&quot;<br />
<br />
She would have said more, but what was there for her to say? There was no way in hell Jessica could have done this to her. She had been joking about the computer thing she had gotten being able to do all sorts of crazy stuff, but that was all it was, a joke. Breasts didn&#39;t just start growing on their own, but she was unable to stop turning that thought over in her mind as they walked across the parking lot. Her breasts did feel heavier and bra was getting painful.<br />
<br />
Once in the mall she went straight to a restroom and went inside. Luckily there was no one else in there at the moment and she went into the stall farthest from the door. Safely out of sight she pulled off her shirt and looked down at her chest. There was no doubt about it, her breasts looked bigger...no, they actually were bigger. She could see where they were starting to overflow the cups of her bra, causing it to dig into their soft, delicate mass. Not quite sure what she expected she took off her bra and was unable to keep from groaning in relief. She could actually see angry looking red lines where the bra had been practically cutting into the bottoms and sides of her breasts. She gently massaged her aching breasts to ease the discomfort and let out a sigh. They were as sensitive to pleasure as they had been to pain and the careful rubbing felt wonderful. Her nipples tingled and throbbed harder than they had before and oh so cautiously she gave one a little tug. The feeling made her knees go weak and she slumped against the wall of the bathroom stall, which brought her back to reality. <br />
<br />
What had she been about to do, playing with herself in public like that? She looked down at her breasts as though expecting an answer there. Instead her gaze fell on her nipples. There was something strange about them. A closer look and she saw that they appeared larger and darker, more of a brown that their normal pink. The same was true of her areolas, they were noticeably larger and darker and there was something else too. She ran a finger over one and felt the little bumps around her nipple more clearly than she ever had before. Something was happening to her and she had no idea what. The nonsense with the computer program Jessica had been palying with had to be a coincidence, but it was a creepy one.<br />
<br />
First things first she had to get a new bra. No, first she had to get her old bra and shirt back on, which proved easier said than done. Getting her bra on was an ordeal. It was far too tight and her breasts overflowed the sides of the cups, threatening to burst free with every move she made. Next came her shirt, which was pulled tight across her chest, pressing down on her breasts and making her nipples tingle. This was all too weird, but before she could do anything more she had to get a new bra.<br />
<br />
She tried to walk calmly out of the bathroom, but between the discomfort caused by her bra and the way her nipples were tingling it was a difficult task. The matter was not helped by the way Jessica was standing outside the bathroom, smirking. That settled it in Nikki&#39;s mind, this was too much to be a coincidence.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; Nikki hissed at her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Jessica asked, the picture of wide-eyed innocence.<br />
<br />
&quot;This,&quot; Nikki gestured at her chest, &quot;You&#39;re acting like this is a big joke, but look at me. This is not normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica crossed her arms over her chest, &quot;So do you believe that the Chronivac works now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Nikki snapped, &quot;I don&#39;t believe in magic or any nonsense like that. You must have slipped something in my food or my bra or something to make my breasts swell up like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Jessica raised an eyebrow, &quot;And if there was something that could make breasts grow like that don&#39;t you think it would be all over the news? Why would people bother paying for breast implants if it was that easy?&quot;<br />
<br />
As little as Nikki wanted to admit it, Jessica had a point. Maybe she was being a bit too quick to jump to conclusions. Still, she wasn&#39;t ready to let her friend off the hook just yet, &quot;So what do you think caused this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably an allergic reaction or something like that. It&#39;ll probably go away in a few days, but until then you might want to get a new bra just to make things easier,&quot; Jessica offered eagerly, almost too eagerly in Nikki&#39;s opinion.<br />
<br />
Feeling more than a little self conscious due to how tightly her shirt was pulled across her expanding cleavage Nikki followed Jessica to a lingerie shop. Jessica made a beeline to a display of the most lacy, skimpy bras she could find and started looking through them while Nikki went straight to the back of the store to find the most plain, ordinary bras she could. She was only going to need them until the swelling went down so she didn&#39;t want to spend too much money or get anything too nice.<br />
<br />
Recalling what Jessica had said earlier about how large her breasts looked she selected a c-cup bra and held it up to compare to her chest. The cups looked so big to her until she held it against her breasts, then she wasn&#39;t so sure. Not at all happy about what she was doing, she took the bra and went to the fitting room to try it on.<br />
<br />
As soon as she had the door closed and latched she took off her shirt and bra, wincing as her breasts bounced free against her chest. Good as it felt to have her now too small bra off, they felt strangely heavy, not to mention they were sore from how tight her bra had become. Before trying on the new bra she massaged her aching breasts, noting how firm they felt as she did. Maybe Jessica was right about it being some sort of allergic reaction. They certainly did feel strange, sort of tingly, especially around her nipples. It wasn&#39;t exactly an uncomfortable feeling though, especially now that they weren&#39;t being crushed. As she continued to massage, unintentionally focusing on her big, dark nipples and the little bumps on her wide, round areolas. There was a mirror in the fitting room and she looked at herself. There was no doubt about it now, her nipples were noticeably larger and a rich, coffee brown rather than their normal light pink. Her areolas had grown and darkened as well, standing out like targets on the creamy skin of her breasts. Could an allergic reaction do that? She wasn&#39;t sure, all she knew was that the tingling was more pleasant than painful and that the massage she was giving herself felt amazing, like her breasts were more sensitive.<br />
<br />
Forcing herself to stop she tried on the bra she had selected and was alarmed to discover that it felt tight. It was much better than her old bra, but if the swelling didn&#39;t go down, or got worse, she was going to be in for some serious trouble. There was clearly only one thing for her to do, as little as she liked it.<br />
<br />
Removing the bra she put her shirt back on, the clingy fabric pressing against her breasts and sliding against her nipples making her shiver. Quickly she ducked out of the fitting room, her rapid movements making her unsupported breasts sway and bounce heavily. Their increased weight was hard to get used to, but now that they weren&#39;t being crushed by a too small bra the weight wasn&#39;t so bad, in fact the gentle, warm pressure of her breasts against her chest felt sort of good.<br />
<br />
As she looked at the bras nearest the fitting room, trying to find one that was the right size and style she shifted her weight slightly without intending to, just to test the way her weighty breasts shifted against her chest. It didn&#39;t take her long to find what she needed, a plain white d-cup bra, the cups heavily padded to provide support. Huge as it looked to her, when she looked down at her breasts she knew that it would be the right size just by looking.<br />
<br />
Glad to have found what she needed she went back into the fitting room and once again took off her shirt and tried on the new bra. Despite being a d-cup it fit perfectly, providing the support her breasts needed and holding them comfortably. She adjusted the straps to be sure and turned slowly in front of the mirror to examine her reflection. The swelling was confined to her breasts and now that she was wearing a bra that fit it was a lot more comfortable. In fact, ignoring the way her breasts had grown by two cup sizes, she felt fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay in there?&quot; Jessica called out, knocking on the door.<br />
<br />
Nikki smoothed her shirt down over her chest. Even if a new bra helped, it didn&#39;t change the fact that her shirt didn&#39;t fit over her swollen breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m better than I was,&quot; Nikki said, wiggling slightly to try and get her shirt to sit better across her chest, then pulling it back down as it rode up slightly. It was too tight, but she wasn&#39;t about to go any buy a whole new shirt when she had sweatshirts at the house that would fit just fine until the swelling went down, &quot;Once I pay for the bra we can leave and go shopping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica smiled at her as she left the changing room, &quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to get a few more bras, just in case?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was something about her smile that made Nikki suspicious all over again, but there was no sense of dwelling on it, at least not until she could be sure that Jessica had actually done something.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way,&quot; she rolled her eyes as she looked down at the price tag on the bra. It was way too much to be getting spares for something that was going to be temporary.<br />
<br />
Or at least she hoped that it was only temporary.<br />
<br />
Walking to the front of the store she marveled at the weight on her chest. A well fitting bra made all the difference, but her shirt was still too tight, the friction keeping her nipples almost painfully stimulated and making it a constant struggle not to rub at her chest.</p>
