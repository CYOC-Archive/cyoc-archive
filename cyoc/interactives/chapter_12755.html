<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things were back to normal for the guys, but Tony's perspective on his girlfriend, Claire had changed.  As much as he cared for her before, he was truly in love with her now.  She'd wanted him even when his body had been humiliatingly stretched out.  Tony couldn't stop thinking of her and would willingly do anything for her.  <br />
<br />
So, a week later, when she came by his house at the same time as the whole chronivac crew was there, and told him of her problem, Tony was anxious to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Gingersnap&quot; explained a flustered Claire.  &quot;It's really his ankle.  On the last jump, he came down on a little hummock of grass.  The doctors said he can't even be ridden for a week, never mind jump.  I-I don't even get to compete now.  I really thought I had a chance to win.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony had been to Claire's riding club a few times and seen her horse at the stable, too.  Claire's family only had a little more money than the St. Martins and that was their biggest indulgence of Claire.  Tony watched her sighing and trying to keep her emotions under control despite the disappointment.  He took Claire in his arms.  The obvious solution ocurred to Tony.  He looked at Jeff over her shoulder and pointed to himself.  Jeff gave him a worried look.  Are you sure?<br />
<br />
&quot;Claire?&quot;<br />
She looked up at him.  Yes?<br />
&quot;I . . I can be your horse&quot; said Tony and the others all flashed worried looks at him.<br />
<br />
Clair smiled.  She had her hands in Tony's back pockets.  &quot;You're really developed back here, especially for a slender boy, but this is not the rear end of a horse&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it can be.  I can be a horse.  I . . we . . I mean, Jeff received something called a chronivac as a sort of product trial.  It . . well it's a program from a whole bunch of CD's that Jeff has on his laptop now.  We've used it a bunch of times.  It-it can turn a person into almost anything.  I-&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony could see that it wasn't going well.  It was too much for anyone to accept just intellectually.  He led Clair over to the desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show her&quot; he said to Jeff.  Jeff reluctantly turned on the laptop and went to the Chronivac 4.0 program.  He explained every step he was taking as he started into the process.  Tony leaned in close to Jeff &quot;Give me the lemur&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
While Tony stepped to the center of the room, Jeff kept navigating the program menus and explaining it to Claire as he went.<br />
&quot;So, now we've chosen the profile of the transformation recipient, that's who will be changed, in this case, Tony.  The next thing to do is to choose the nature of the transformation.&quot; Jeff pointed at the screen.  &quot;See, the two main options are a transformation that the subject has already undergone or to choose a new one.  New ones generally take much longer to choose because you have to go through all the posible options nad sometimes there are literally hundreds.  We're going to make this simple and choose a previous transformation profile of Tony's.  This one was actually an accident, but it's there just the same&quot; he added and turned the screen away from her to let it be a surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute&quot; said Claire to both Tony and Jeff.  &quot;You want me to believe that you're going to turn Tony into an animal right now?  This is crazy&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not completely an animal.  He'll still have Tony's mind inside.  Watch&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony looked Claire in the eyes.  She was on the verge of just walking out but Tony calmed her with a look that said &quot;Please, just give this a chance&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Annnnnnnnnd . . now we start&quot; said Jeff and he hit the 'enter' key with a dramatic gesture.  Tony immediately felt the familiar electric wave pass through his body.  Clair gasped as Tony immediately started shrinking till after just five seconds, Tony was only 2 feet tall.  His clothes drooped comically from his arms and legs and finally Tony climbed out of the pile of them.  As he did so, his legs were lengthening and torso reshaping.  His shoulders narrowed and a tail sprouted at the top of his little buns.  In just a few seconds, it stretched up higher than Tony's reshaping head and sprouted fur from base to tip.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh . . my . . god&quot; muttered Claire watching her boyfriend's transformation.  The palms of Tony's litle hands blackened now as did the soles of his feet and fur sprouted, almost instantly over the rest of Tony's new little body.  A few final changes internally; Tony rubbed his new little belly and that was it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That-that little monkey is Tony?  It's really Tony?&quot; asked a still incredulous Claire.<br />
&quot;He's a lemur now.  See?&quot; said Jeff, showing her the picture on the screen.  Claire just stared at it all, her mouth wide open in shock.<br />
<br />
Tony jumped onto the desk and rubbed his simian little body against Claire.  She picked up the monkey that was her boyfriend and rubbed his long tail.  Tony let out a happy, high pitched warble.  <br />
&quot;Are you really Tony?&quot; she asked holding him so that his little face was just an inch away.<br />
&quot;That's him&quot; declared Jack<br />
&quot;That's my big brother&quot; chuckled Mark.<br />
<br />
Tony nodded and Claire rubbed his little head affectionately.  &quot;I've gotta have some proof, though.  A monkey could nod his head and might be affectionate toward me.&quot; she said and put the monkey in question down on his desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; she said to Tony the lemur &quot;if you're really Tony inside there, then show me which book is the one that Tony says is the saddest he's ever read&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony the lemur jumped over to his bed, an impressive leap because of the way he effortlessly traveled over the 8 foot gap.  He grabbed a book in his long clawed hand and leaped back to the desk.  He handed it to Claire while letting out another happy chirp.  Claire examined it.  &quot;Brave New World!  That's right.  Okay, what book did you read instead of Crime and Punishment in sophomore english because you'd already read that one&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony leaped back to the bed and looked in the bookcase.  He scanned back and forth but couldn't find it.  He let out a frustrated screech then jumped over to his other bookcase in the corner of the room.  There it was.  He reached with his two black palms and pulled the Brothers Karamazov paperback off the shelf and leaped back to the desk with it.  He let out another happy chirp as he handed it to Claire.<br />
&quot;That's right!&quot; she cooed and picked up her simian boyfriend and hugged him.  &quot;You really are Tony, aren't you?&quot;  Tony nodded and touched his moist black nose to hers.  She hugged her monkey boyfriend to her bosom and slowly petted his fascinating little body, paying special attention to his tail.  Tony sighed and moaned softly at this affection.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, this thing really works and Tony really can become my horse or-or a horse that I could ride?&quot;<br />
&quot;He's always seemed like a horse's ass to me&quot; added Eric.<br />
Jeff nodded to Claire.  &quot;First, let's change him back to being Tony&quot;.  Claire gave one last pat to his furry little ass and let him go.  Tony jumped for the middle of the room and once he was in front of the emitter, Jeff set the computer to restore him.  <br />
<br />
Tony felt the electric wave pass through him and immediately started growing.  As he did so, he shed fur and his tail.  His limbs and torso resumed their former proportion and his face returned to its model shape.  He was almost full sized and completely human before his tail started to shrink and then disappeared.  He stood naked in front of his girlfriend, brother and friends.  He smiled to all, but quickly picked up his shorts and turned his back on them as he got dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really understood everything I was saying to you when you were a monkey?&quot; asked Claire.<br />
&quot;Everything&quot; said Tony over his shoulder while pulling up his pants.  &quot;I was mentally 100% myself except for feeling some monkey instincts and desires.  I-I could smell almost as well as a dog.  So, the whole time that I'm thinking about other things, I'm unavoidably mentally processing dozens of smells.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you had this thing?&quot; asked Claire of all of them.<br />
&quot;About 8 months now&quot; said Jeff and he and the others found themselves answering a whole series of questions, as Claire quizzed them about whatever aspect of it ocurred to her at the moment.  <br />
<br />
It was only interrupted by Tony asking her when the contest was.  Two days away was the answer.  &quot;Why don't we get started with this, then&quot; said Tony.  A few minutes later, Jeff was driving him and Claire to her stable in the next town.  Off the state highway and then down a couple narrow, winding sand and oil roads, they drove for 15 minutes till Claire alerted them that they were getting close.<br />
<br />
She said that there had been some sort of robbery at the stables recently and they were being nutty about security and watching things.  She recommended that they turn off onto a side road and do their thing outside the stables.  They parked in a shaded pine hollow and Jeff plugged the laptop into the car cigarette lighter.  While he started to go through the menu, Tony started pulling off his clothes in the back seat.  Naked, now, he set up the emitter to point at him out the passenger side window.  Meanwhile, Claire went through all the equine choices.  Tony would be an Arabian.  He would be light gray.  He'd be 16 hands high.  He'd weigh 1002 pounds.  <br />
<br />
Leaning in the car window, Tony chuckled. &quot;A thousand two pounds?  Is that heavy for a horse?&quot;<br />
&quot;Actually, it is a little bit heavy, but we're going to make you lean but with a terrific ass, kind of like you are now&quot;  <br />
Tony chuckled &quot;Thanks&quot;<br />
<br />
It took Claire a few minutes more to go through all the possible choices and pick the best equine attributes for Tony, but finally she was done.  Jeff had her hit the enter button and Tony saw the emitter glow yellow and felt the electric wave pass through his naked body.  <br />
<br />
He immediately started adding mass.  His knees wobbled and then the joint reversed to flex in the opposite direction from how it did for human Tony.  He felt what seemed like thousands of tiny pinpricks all over his body as light gray Arabian horse hair covered him.  His penis lengthened and thickened to shocking size and then, with a sound like a wet slap, attached in a sheath to his lower abdomen.  A tail emerged from the top of the crack of Tony's ass and his ears shot up.  His face started to reshape, his nose and mouth pushing rapidly forward, his nostils flaring wide and teeth growing many times as large as they had been.  Tony felt uncomfortable standing upright and leaned his hands onto the hood of Jeffs car just as his hands and feet coalesced into black hooves.  Finally, Tony's body lengthened and his buttocks burgeoned outward and outward becoming the ass of a horse who could run and jump with any other.  <br />
<br />
Tony whinnied and surveyed himself using the car's mirror.  Claire jumped out of the car and hugged his nose and then his neck.<br />
&quot;Ohhhhh, thank you for doing this for me, Tony&quot; she cooed and rubbed her boyfriend's new Arabian horse body affectionately from head to tail, finishing up with a vigorous massage of his huge new derriere.<br />
<br />
While she did so, Jeff repeated to her some of the peripherals of this transformation.  &quot;Everyone thinks that Tony has always been your horse.  You bought him when he was just a colt from a horse owning family that was in danger of going bankrupt.  While Tony's an Arabian horse, there is no human Tony.  Mark doesn't have an older brother and you don't have a boyfriend Tony as far as anyone knows.  That's about it, so, uh, ride him&quot; he said and gave Tony as hard a slap as he could to his incredible round equine ass.  Tony barely felt it but grunted at Jeff just the same.<br />
<br />
Jeff said bye and got into his car while Claire led her mount, Tony onto the stable grounds.  Once on the property, she walked Tony past a security man and over to the stall she rented.  A stable hand came over to help her and with his help, she put a saddle and reins on her boyfriend Tony.  She gave him a rub between his large eyes and then jumped atop him.  She rode Tony out to the jumping grounds, talking to him all the while.  This wasn't unusual.  A lot of riders talked to their horses.  But not many horses understood every word. <br />
<br />
Tony listened carefully.  Claire was no burden at all to thousand pound Tony and looking at the jumps, none of them seemed like they would be that hard for him.  But he knew there was a certain protocol for the sequence of jumps and how a rider took her horse over them.  He'd have to do things as she wanted and follow her instructions.  He'd have to be the beast and allow her to be the master.<br />
<br />
Claire led Tony over the jumps three times, talking to him all the while, telling her boyfriend, the horse, exactly how to do everything and what he'd done wrong, what he had to anticipate coming next.  <br />
<br />
Finally, she rode him off through the stables property that ran more than a mile to the east.  At the limit of it, Tony felt a bit winded.  He could feel the sweat pouring off him as Claire steered him to a small pond.  She jumped off and took pulled Tony forward by his reins.  &quot;Come on, Tony.  Here's a nice place for you to drink&quot;  <br />
<br />
Tony didn't have to be told twice and he bent his long neck and gulped cool water greedily.  In addition, he chewed several mouthfuls of the excellent grass growing beside the pond.  Claire walked around him admiring him.<br />
&quot;Oh, Tony.  If only you knew horses.  You are the most beautiful horse I've ever seen in person.  Honest.  You're as beautiful a horse as you are a boy.&quot; she said and laughed at another thought.  &quot;I bet every filly wants you to be her stud&quot;<br />
Tony turned to look at her and she could actually see him sort of raising an eyebrow in an expression meaning &quot;Come on&quot;.  Claire burst into laughter.  &quot;Still my Tony&quot; she said rubbing Tony's muzzle.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, with afternoon light starting to wane, Claire mounted Tony again and rode him back toward the stall.  She intended to ride him back to where she and Jeff had transformed him and Jeff was supposed to be there with the chronivac, but when she slowed Tony from a gallop to a trot as they neared the property boundary, Jeff was just pulling up to the property limits.  She intended to just wait there, but from out of nowhere, a stable hand and a security guy approached her.  <br />
&quot;Will you keep me company back to the stables?&quot; asked the stable hand.  &quot;This mount is really giving me trouble.  Can I tie him to Tony?&quot;  He asked.  Claire glanced over her shoulder at Jeff.  He had his palms raised.  What's going on?  But it was a serious thing for a mount to become disagreeable.  Claire couldn't refuse a request for help of this sort.  <br />
&quot;Sorry about this Tony&quot; she whispered into his left ear as the stable hand threw a rope to her from her right side.  Claire walked Tony beside the other horse all the way to the stalls.  The other horse bucked a bit once or twice, but was much better behaved with Tony's equine companionship.  The stable hand remarked about it and asked if Claire thought it would be okay to put him in the empty stall next to Tony.  <br />
&quot;If he sees Tony go in, first, he'll be better about doin' it himself&quot; added the stable hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no&quot; thought Tony.  I don't want to spend the night as a horse.  He looked to Claire who had dismounted him and stood in front of him.  Get me out of this.<br />
<br />
But she didn't have any ready excuse.  She led Tony into his stall and spent some time brushing his lustrous nearly white hair.  She even gave a playful pat to his huge equine penis.  &quot;You're really hung, aren't you?&quot; she laughed.  She brushed him some more and fiddled with his saddle, all the while hoping that an opportunity would present itself to lead him out to the edge of the property.  But there were always people buzzing around.  She just wasn't going to be able to get him out with all the employees and security people around.  She gave Tony water and put the feed bag on her boyfriend.  &quot;I'm sorry Tony but you'll have to be a horse for the night, too&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony let out a sort of sigh.  Okay.  For you.  And he accepted her pat on the nose and watched her walk off.</p>
