I came home from school, and found a package on the doorstep. I wasn&#39;t expecting anything so I brought it in and left it for my dad wanting to get my homework out of the way so I can enjoy the weekend completely.<br />
<br />
Packing up my bookbag, my attention returned to the box I left on Dad&#39;s seat, I looked at the label to get an idea what Dad got, and I realized it was addressed to me! Guys, it was a Chronivac! A new test model! The company just gave it to me! :-O <br />
<br />
I&#39;m playing with it, and getting used to it but wanted to share. Found this site in a search for Chronivac guides, figured I should start an account and that you&#39;d be excited for me and be able to give some guidance. Not sure how my dad will feel about it but I can have fun till he notices. The Anime Hair Styles package is fun!<br />
<br />
15/Male/California... haven&#39;t had a chance to give a bio yet, to busy with the new toy!<br />

Welcome to the forum. Please follow our Rules Of Engagement, and have fun! <br />
We do have a few lucky Chronivac owners who visit the site and give us updates, stories, as well as words of caution if we ever find ourselves to be so lucky... You may want to look into this thread here, as well as here, and here to address caution and guidance when minors gain access to one of these devices. Other than that, appropriate usage of the device is strongly encouraged and we look forward to the stories you will have to share!<br />

Hey, update, Thanks for the likes and comments everyone! My dad found the emitter sitting next to the computer last night... and I left the program up, so when he moved the mouse it was right there... I explained everything and he sent me to my room to play video games... I obviously didn&#39;t do anything to hide it so I&#39;m not in trouble, but he wanted to look into it before giving me the okay to use it (more) unsupervised.<br />
<br />
This morning after breakfast, he mentioned he wanted to try something with it. (I&#39;m sure he tried stuff last night but I wasn&#39;t going to start that conversation with him.) Apparently, he was concerned that doing what he wanted would mess up his memories so he wanted to give them to me in case his playing around altered his mind.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later I had high school, college, years of work and life experience floating around in my head and my dad was 21 again! It was so neat! He didn&#39;t end up needing me to hold his knowledge but I thought it was really cool to reminisce on work and college parties and flings... Hey, he gave it to me... Thank fully he spared me from memories of dating my own mom, and the whole birth scene, but everything outside that was on the table. Additionally, after realizing he was able to keep his memories, he was actually okay with me still holding onto a copy of them! Something about an education money can&#39;t buy... given my new perspective I can&#39;t really blame him for wanting to spare the college expenses in a few years but I was on the fence but now I&#39;d love to go! :-D   ;-) <br />

This is just rubbing me the wrong way. It feels like grooming. Kid, I&#39;d get out of there. Set yourself up as a millionaire in Maui with a trust fund or something.<br />

It could be, but you are making a ton of assumptions, we have a number of parents in this site seeking guidance on how to make sure their under 18 child can be made to be responsible with the godlike power... having a war over the device ends badly, giving up on attempting to have rules and consequences ends badly... the dad made a knee jerk reaction to give his son the exact same guidance he&#39;d be able to provide if he was with the kid at all times... ideal... no, but it also doesn&#39;t mean the kid should abandon friends and family to live alone.<br />

Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!!!!!! I went to my dad earlier today and said... &quot;So, since I already graduated college and have like, an extra 30 years of life experience, you aren&#39;t expecting me to go to high school tomorrow right?&quot;<br />
<br />
His face got all weird and he shook his head, but he said, &quot;One of us needs to go to school, and one of us needs to go to work...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I know all your co-workers, projects, and goals just as well as you do...&quot; I mentioned with a sly grin...<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s definitely the more complicated of the options, but I&#39;m good with it.&quot; Dad smirked, got up and went to the computer.<br />
<br />
Guys, I&#39;m 27 now! My dad, I guess nephew now, found some mixed reality option and my learner&#39;s permit became a license! I look like the people on TV! I am just blown away, this is so amazing! I&#39;m going to go to work tomorrow!<br />
<br />

Oh wow! Tell me, what was it like for you? Looking in the mirror? Are you hungrier faster? There are so many things that change over time but you experienced them instantly, what can you tell us about it?<br />
<br />
User BoxingTurtles057 added message Monday@9:52pm:<br />
Hey guys, work was interesting, but it felt very routine. Sorry @ProgressFanatic, I had some mental changes leading up to the physical change and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m a good candidate for your inquiry. Things felt new and familiar at the same time... like shaving every day was a thing my dad did, so I did it without thinking Sunday morning, when I was still 15 and beardless...<br />
<br />
I came home and did the breakfast dishes, started dinner, chatted with my son about his day, and watched a show then the news... it was pretty hum drum... Oh, in looking over my last update, I apparently miscalculated. I&#39;m 32, not 27. Besides my license I can tell by the few gray hairs at the back of my jaw. Fuckers... lol. Winding down, will update you tomorrow.<br />

I think somethings wrong. I&#39;ve tried to check the Chronivac but every time I do I get wildly distracted... I think my son is making me take over his former life so he can live mine. I wouldn&#39;t care if he let me live my own life, but his... I don&#39;t want it, and apparently neither does he.<br />
<br />
So after dinner, I had to make a convenience store run for cigarettes... I don&#39;t smoke, won&#39;t smoke, and think its disgusting... but looking over my... his? the credit card statement, I&#39;ve been making regular stops like this every day this week including Saturday! Before work, after work. On lunch breaks... I sta... No, he started back in college as a way of feeling in control of his life, asserting his adulthood, and every fucking thing is now a trigger... for me. Finishing a task I&#39;m working on, getting to work, getting out of work, breaks, phone calls from friends, before eating, after eating, sex, 2 hours without a smoke... and the list goes on. Disgusting!<br />
<br />
I tried to look at the Chronivac, found myself grabbing a snack, went back to it... Found myself checking out phone games and drinking a beer... 4 cigarettes, 2 more beers, a YouTube comedy skit, as well as a video tutorial on dishwasher maintenance later, and I still can&#39;t seem to look at the program without falling deeper into his former lifestyle...<br />
<br />
I brought up switching back but... I&#39;m not quite sure what happened, my thoughts are all hazy trying to remember being his kid, uncle, and father. Thoughts of his mother seem to be creeping in... I found myself checking a dating app on my phone, it was set to find 40-47 year old women! I found them attractive. I thought back to the girl I had a crush on in school and was turned off... I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s me anymore...<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not sure if this is a punishment/goal/accident/ or trial but I&#39;m 39 now and half my beard is white. I don&#39;t expect this to be stopping until I&#39;m in my late 40&#39;s like he was... but at the rate my mentality is changing, by then it&#39;ll be too late. My coffee habit can only do so much, I need to get some sleep because despite this, I need to function tomorrow. If you know a way to stop this, please help! I&#39;m supposed to be 16, I&#39;d like to be 21, instead I&#39;m becoming a 49 year old, desperate for affection, single father.<br />

@BoxingTurtles057, Stay away from the Chronivac Emitter and do not try to use your device to make changes! <br />
Call TransDem and report the problem! The number should be all over your box, paperwork, and so on...<br />
<br />
@ChronoFiend Is there anything you can do? \FLAGMOD<br />
