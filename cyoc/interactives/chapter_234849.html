<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Exiting his car, Akira smoothed his charcoal suit as he gazed around the staff parking lot. After spending several weeks in the hospital, the kitsune was returning for the last day of school. Taking a breath, he now strolled through the parking lot, noting the looks of relief on both teacher and students.<br />
<br />
Fukushu&#39;s presence may have kept the school safe, but at a cost. Throughout his recovery, he had heard stories of the kitsune generals methods. Fukushu was security conscious, the school becoming safer than most government buildings. Unfortunately, it also meant students and teachers were frightened as the nine tail patrolled the hallways and grounds, along with his security team. Akira heard stories of teachers and students confronted by Fukushu&#39;s team, interrogated for such simple tasks as useing the bathroom. Couple that with the addition of Akiras sister, Aiko, armed guards and humans found themselves on edge. Passing a pair of Aiko&#39;s guards, Akira nodded to the pair as he made his way inside.<br />
<br />
Aiko and her security were a recent addition following Akiras injuries. The kitsunes younger sister always fretted over him, even when they were kits. This meant the four tailed vixen made the choice to come to America while very pregnant. As a result, the vixen had given birth in the states, Akira congratulating his sister on the birth of her son before he was discharged. This meant that the security team was now spread thin, a few guarding the school while the majority stood watch over Aiko and the future heir of the Yakuza clan. <br />
<br />
Entering the security office, Akira smirked as he saw his old master. Fukushu wore his black and red hikama, his katana at his side as he stood. Looking up from his security briefing, Fukushu gave Akira a stiff nod. &quot;Welcome back,&quot; he stated. &quot;I was told you would be returning today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira smiled, shaking his old masters hand as he studied his office carefully. Fukushu may have used the office as his own but had moved nothing in Akiras absence. &quot;Yes I was given a clean bill of health,&quot; he stated. &quot;In all honesty I was beginning to go a little stir crazy. It maybe the end of the school year, but I have enjoyed my time here.&quot; Fukushu simple nodded, the nine tail glancing out the window of the office as he studied the students.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to thank you for all that you&#39;ve done Fukushu,&quot; Akira said. &quot;I couldn&#39;t have done a better job in protecting the students of this school.&quot; Fukushu grunted, furrowing his brow as he watched students mill about the school. &quot;I received far more push back than I anticipated from the humans,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Too many weak willed bureaucrats more interested in their own position than proper security measures.&quot; Fukushu sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose in annoyance. &quot;How can you deal with humans? They ask for something than complain about, it&#39;s maddening!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You get used to it my old master,&quot; Akira smirked. &quot;And eventually, you can&#39;t imagine not liking them.&quot;<br />
<br />
*********************************<br />
<br />
Mia stomped down the hall, a scowl on her face as she searched for Winery. Despite Akira finally returning, the teenage witch was having a bad day. It started well enough, paying Akira a visit and welcoming him back, but turned sour as soon as she ran into Zack.<br />
<br />
Zack looked defeated, the teen looking as if his heart had been ripped out. When she asked why, her anger rose. Winery had dumped him for no reason. When he asked why, she said she wanted to see other people. The sad look on the teens face drove Mia into a frenzy. Zack was her best friend, he didn&#39;t deserve this! As she rounded the corner, she could see the pretty blonde Lycan princess talking with another blonde girl Mia recognized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Winery!&quot;<br />
<br />
Winery turned, noting the brunette teen marching towards her. Already she could tell Mia was pissed, the brunettes ears red with anger. &quot;Mia I....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet,&quot; Mia exclaimed, scowling at Winery. &quot;What the hell is the matter with you?! Why would you hurt Zack like that?&quot; Winery tried to answer, breaking up with Zack wasn&#39;t easy. He was a great guy, treated her the way any girl wanted to be treated but, she didn&#39;t like him like that. At least not anymore. As she tried to explain this, Mia turned to face the girl the werewolf princess was talking to. &quot;It&#39;s because of this bitch isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me,&quot; Felicity balked. &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything!&quot; Mia scoffed, eyeballing the pair critically. &quot;Bullshit,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;You probably said something to Winery. What is Zack not good enough or is it because the One Humanity doesn&#39;t approve of two werewolves dating?&quot; Felicity paled, Winery had only just told her that she had broken up with Zack.  The decision wasn&#39;t easy but Winery realized she didn&#39;t love Zack. Needless to say, Felicity was a little excited to hear the werewolf princess was single. Still, being accused of being part of the One Humanity wasn&#39;t something she was thrilled with. &quot;I&#39;m not part of the One Humanity!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right,&quot; Mia scoffed. &quot;Abolith maybe crazy but she&#39;s not wrong. You&#39;re hiding something I know it!&quot; Felicity could feel herself breaking into a cold sweat. Did Mia figure out she was part of the Normal or was she simply upset that her best friend was hurt? &quot;Mia I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia frowned, her eyes glowing blue as a blast of blue energy now pushed Felicity back. &quot;Shut up,&quot; Mia spat. &quot;I know a bigot when I see one and I can just tell that you secretly hate us. Just like Mandy.&quot; Felicity stammered, Mia was a little too close to figuring things out. How was she going to talk her way out of this?<br />
<br />
Felicity it seemed wouldn&#39;t need to. After being pushed into a locker, the blonde teen turned to Winery. Winery&#39;s eyes flashed, appearing animalistic. The werewolf was always protective of Felicity, defending her at every turn. Now, because Mia felt the need to defend Zack, she was lashing out at Felicity. With an animalistic growl, the werewolf princess now shoved Mia, sending the girl tumbling to the ground. &quot;Back off Mia,&quot; she snarled, her delicate features shifting into a more feral state.<br />
<br />
Mia grunted, holding her ribs as she scowled at the pretty, popular teen. Winery had tapped into her Lycan heritage without transforming and it hurt like hell. As she was about to answer, the teens paused as a white cat with crystal blue eyes stepped in front of Mia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rexie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; Rexie grinned, the cat familiar staring down both Winery and Felicity. &quot;Was wondering when I was going to get a rematch. Guess I should thank you for breaking the spell keeping me out.&quot; Rexie now grew quickly, the cat familiars muscles increasing on size as his teeth elongated into two long fangs. Now a massive, white sabertooth cat stood between the two teens and his master. &quot;Thanks for attacking Mia,&quot; he growled. &quot;Now I&#39;m going to make you pay.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a roar, Rexie pounced, pinning Winery to the floor. As Felicity looked to say something, she caught the back of Rexies massive paw, sending the teen tumbling backwards. &quot;Listen here your highness,&quot; Rexie growled. &quot;You ever put a hand on Mia again I&#39;m going to jam your head up the prissy ones ass!&quot; Rexie now turned to Felicity, her blue eyes narrowing.  Obviously when the familiar said prissy one, she was referring to Felicity.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you,&quot; Rexie growled. &quot;I don&#39;t know if the elf was right about you, but if you hurt Mia I&#39;ll paint the hallway with your insides.&quot; Felicity gulped, trembling slightly as she stared into Rexies blue eyes.<br />
<br />
Quickly, Mia and Winery&#39;s friends rushed in, Pryyha, Fae, Annie, and Lilith separating everyone. No one wanted to get in trouble on the last day of school and looked to cover things up as quickly as possible. While the group may have finished their first year unscathed, the summer was going to be filled with far more drama than any anticipated.</p>
