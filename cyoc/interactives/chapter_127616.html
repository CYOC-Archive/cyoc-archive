<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This video’s gonna be my insurance that you’ll ALWAYS do what I want! Face it, Jimmy, I own you now! Hahahaha! The rest of our lives you’re gonna do whatever I tell you to do! As for letting you cum, POOR BABY! No, I want you to get even CLOSER to the edge! Come on! Frig that pussy of yours. Put some fingers in your ass and hover right on the edge for me. Spread open your ass for the camera and tell me you want a big fat cock up your ass!”<br />
<br />
“Pleeeeeeease, Tod! Put a big fat cock up my ass......” Jim was practically convulsing on the carpet as his whole body involuntarily shuddered again and again and again. Tod filmed his pathetic thrashings for about ten minutes then put the camera down and picked up the phone.<br />
<br />
“Hi Steve. Tod. Your folks still gonna be away till Sunday? Yeah, I know. Party Time! Call up some of the guys and we’ll party a little tonight down your cellar. My big step brother’s home from college and I’m bringing him over.... Yeah, I KNOW he’s an asshole, but he’s gonna show us a real good time tonight, if you catch my drift... No, I’m not shitting! Just get the guys together around seven, you’re not gonna BELIEVE this! OK, bye.”<br />
<br />
Tod hung up the phone and leered at his pathetic step brother. Maybe if he hadn’t been such an obnoxious creep to him all those years he’d have helped him out. Now all he thought about was getting even with him, and getting his rocks off to boot.<br />
<br />
Jim had once had caught Tod jacking off. He thought the house was empty and was lying on top of his bed naked after taking a shower. Jim yelled at Tod then laughed his ass off. The worst part was that he told their parents and actually gave them the gay magazine! What a shit! he was always ratting on him or putting him down because he was soooo fucking cool. Well, Mr. Cool, your ass is MINE now! Hahahaha!<br />
<br />
Tod told Jim to stop and he lowered his legs down, though his teeth were still chattering. He then told Jim to crawl out into the back yard and get in Duke’s dog house. Poor old Duke was gone but his house was still out back. He told him to kneel inside with his ass sticking out the opening. He was to reach back with one hand and finger himself until he came out to get him.<br />
<br />
With a mixture of fear and hatred in his eyes Jim glared at Tod then began crawling out through the kitchen on to the porch. he then crawled out on the cool lawn and headed towards the doghouse.<br />
<br />
Tod nearly busted his gut laughing as he saw the white muscle ass sticking out of the opening of the doghouse. He saw a big manly hand appear between his opened thighs pushing around the low hanging ball bag and get busy rubbing his hairy asshole. This was just too much!<br />
<br />
He made himself a sandwich and a glass of milk and sat on the porch watching Jim while he ate. After about ten minutes he got up and walked out to the dog house.<br />
<br />
“How you doing, Jimmy?” he laughed.<br />
<br />
“Don’t do this to me, Tod. Not out here in the yard. Please!”<br />
<br />
“Come out of there, Jim. OK.” He smiled as he bent over and attached Duke’s old collar around Jim’s neck. He clipped the leash onto it and stood up straight, jerking it occasionally and snickering.<br />
<br />
“So you’re afraid of being seen, huh? Climb up on top of the dog house. That’s right. No, the other way. Put a leg on each side of the roof and face away from me, so your ass is towards the house. This way you won’t know if anybody’s standing in the yard watching you or not.”<br />
<br />
He took the free end of the leash and tied it to the side of the doghouse. He straightened up then pinched Jim&#39;s ass a few times.<br />
<br />
“Arch your back down and keep your ass pointing up and out. Now I want you to balance yourself here and at the same time use your right hand to really spank yourself HARD. Lower yourself down a little and just graze your junk on the peak of the roof. Keep yourself right at the edge of orgasm and wiggle your ass as you spank it, but don’t cum.”<br />
<br />
Jim’s whole body was shaking with humiliation as he lowered his belly until his legs were bisected by the peak of the roof. he rubbed it lightly back and forth with his balls and cock and began moaning. At the same time he lifted his right hand and brought it down with a sharp slap on an exposed buttock.<br />
<br />
“Keep it up Jimmy, until I tell you to stop. Also, I want you to bark like a dog, too. Woof! Woof! Hahahaha!”<br />
Jim was mortified beyond belief and so horny that he thought he would faint. As he complied with his latest instructions Tod went over to the driveway, got his basketball, and began shooting hoops. He left him like that for nearly twenty minutes. Jim&#39;s ass was on fire but he couldn’t stop slapping it. he also couldn’t stop rubbing his swollen and dripping cock on the rough peak of the roof. his balls dangled on either side of the peak and jiggled each time his ass shook.<br />
<br />
Tod finally put down the basketball and got the video camera again. He had to add some of this footage to his tape!<br />
“Pleeeeeeeease l-let me down, Tod! Pleeeeease! I p-promise I’ll do whatever you want, only let me stop!”<br />
Tod untied the leash from the side of the doghouse and told Jim he could stop what he was doing and come down. As he stood before Tod he lowered his eyes. For the first time in his life he couldn’t make eye contact with someone! Tod told him to get back down on his hands and knees and he used the leash to lead him back into the house.<br />
<br />
Once inside he stood before Tod who slowly began to take off his pants. Jim knew what was coming and he began sniffling. Tod tugged his underpants down and stood before him, his cock was raging.<br />
“I think you know what to do, Jim. Give me a real good blow job. I know you never gave one before so I want you to do the best job you can.”<br />
<br />
Jim lifted his head until it was only an inch away from the tip of his cock. he sniffed it a little then stuck the tip of his tongue out and gave the head a little lick. Tod shuddered a little, but when his whole mouth sucked his cock inside, his knees nearly buckled! He sat down on the big chair and Jim crawled closer and put his mouth around his cock again. he began sucking on it, then licking the underside and around the head. Tod put his hands in Jim’s hair and began breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
As much as he despised what he was doing Jim gave him the best head he could. He actually took a little perverse pride in being able to make Tod tremble and gasp. he used one hand to cup and fondle his own balls while his mouth began making loud sucking and slurping noises. Jim’s head was pistoning back and forth on the shiny dick and Tod’s eyes were closed in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Finally Jim felt Tod stiffen. He bore down harder on him and he felt Jim start to spasm and then shoot his load against the back of Jim’s throat. He gobbled it down and continued sucking. When it was finally over Tod opened his eyes and looked down at Jim kneeling there between his widely spread thighs.<br />
<br />
“That was GREAT Jim! You’re gonna have to do that for me EVERY day! Mmmmmmmmmm!” He licked his lips.<br />
He pushed Jim back a little then got up and looked at his watch.<br />
<br />
“We gotta get moving, Jim. We’re supposed to be at Steve’s house in about fifteen minutes.<br />
He tugged his underwear and his jeans back on and as he was retying his sneakers he told Jim to put on a long  T shirt but no pants. As long as Jim didn’t bend over nobody would be able to see that he was stark naked waste down. Of course Jim’s protuding erection kept pushing the T short up at the front and he would have to keep adjusting it to stay decent. He unclipped the leash and stuck it in his pocket but he left Duke’s collar around his neck.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go, Jim. We’re walking over to Steve’s house.”<br />
The two of them left the house together. Tod with a mischievous grin on his face, and Jim with blushing cheeks nearly as red as his barely concealed ass.</p>
