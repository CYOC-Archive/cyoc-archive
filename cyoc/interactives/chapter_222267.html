<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... the day after was Tina&#39;s first day of school as a girl. She expected her body and particularly her breasts to draw a lot of attention from guys, so she put on baggy jeans and a slightly oversized hoodie in the morning and hoped the day wouldn&#39;t get too hot.<br />
She felt a bit awkward in her classes, but in general the day went surprisingly well. She didn&#39;t catch many stares and there were no mean comments from other students. Most people seemed to pity her, including the teachers. She spent lunchtime with Tristan and their nerdy friends Joe and Hannah as always and it felt normal. She almost went to the boys&#39; bathroom out of habit, but noticed in time and went to the girls&#39; instead.<br />
Unfortunately for Tina, the temperature rose above 80 degrees and she was covered in sweat even before the dreaded last class of the day - PE, which she was forced to take as a senior as she&#39;d refused to take it the years before. In the locker room she found herself awkwardly changing into her PE clothes away from the other girls, mostly sophomores. Just one person stood next to her - Dillan, the only other student in her school who was taking part in the gender swap experiment. Before, she would have been a bit afraid of the loner, known as a wannabe jock, but now she was glad she wasn&#39;t the only one having to do PE in a newly transformed female body. As she stood there in her underwear, she cast a glance accross the row of girls putting on their sports bras and groaned - she&#39;d forgotten to buy one, so she&#39;d have to do PE in her sweaty, tight, uncomfortable full cup bra. For a split second she thought about just taking it off, but then she remembered the class was co-ed, and the idea of running with those breasts bouncing all over the place was bad enough without sophomore boys leering at her.<br />
<br />
Dillan was still pissed off about having to take PE instead of team sports, and being in the girls&#39; locker room felt weird. Usually she would have found the idea of a bunch of girls getting naked around her somewhat appealing, but now she wasn&#39;t aroused at all - not even when the girl next to her, who used to be a nerdy boy whose name she couldn&#39;t remember, stripped down to her underwear. Dillan realized she was objectively hot, but all she felt was a little envy - with an ass like that and boobs even half as big, she wouldn&#39;t have any problem trying out for the women&#39;s sports teams. And she wouldn&#39;t be the tallest person in the locker room with the smallest breasts. She realized she was the only one not wearing a bra under her shirt - in fact it was one of her men&#39;s shirts, she  hadn&#39;t bought a single item of clothing after the transformation.<br />
Running her warm-up laps, Dillan wondered what the lack of interest in the other girls&#39; naked bodies meant for her sexuality. It looked like she wasn&#39;t into women any more - she hadn&#39;t thought about any woman while masturbating either. In fact, she hadn&#39;t had any fantasies at all - she&#39;d just concentrated on discovering her body, and she&#39;d found that despite her tomboyish looks she had a lot more erogenous zones now than as a man. The memory of her first clitoral orgasms led to a pleasant, warm feeling down there, and she felt her nipples swell and rub against the fabric of her shirt. She quickly tried to distract herself, and the thought that this was a lot less visible than a boner in class made her smile for the first time all day.<br />
<br />
Class went miserable for Tina. She found out that even with her bra on, her breasts bounced almost painfully while running, so she slowed down a bit and was by far the slowest runner. On her last laps all the boys were done already and she felt their eyes following her every step - or rather her every bounce. When she finally finished, beet red, sweaty and panting the teacher, Mrs. Owusu, took her aside. &quot;Are you wearing a normal bra? Poor girl, you really need a sports bra!&quot; she told her.<br />
When the class and the school day finally ended, Tina was the only girl to use the shower as everyone else left. Finally getting out of the bra felt great, and she noticed it had left painful red marks around her chest and on her shoulders. When she came out of the shower, she was surprised to find Dillan still sitting in the locker room.<br />
&quot;Hey. Uh... how do you like being a girl?&quot; Dillan asked.<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s great. I&#39;m even slower and weaker than before, those breasts are killing me and all the guys will probably be talking about &#39;Tina&#39;s titties&#39; for the rest of the week!&quot; Tina complained.<br />
&quot;Well, some people would love to have breasts.&quot; Dillan said and put her hands on her chest.<br />
&quot;Really? You want boobs? I heard you just wanted to get onto the girls&#39; sports teams.&quot; Tina said as she put her pants back on.<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, but they don&#39;t even let me try out because apparently two X chromosomes and a pussy don&#39;t make me female enough. And also I&#39;d rather not be that androgynous person that makes everyone wonder what kind of queer they are.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, I see. Sorry about the sports teams. About the androgynous thing... maybe if you dressed more feminine people would perceive you more clearly as a girl?&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe. But I don&#39;t think they make many dresses or skirts that fit this body.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmm, I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t have a lot of experience with women&#39;s clothes either.&quot; Tina said, and they both chuckled.<br />
&quot;But it looks like I have to go underwear shopping. Wanna go to the mall together?&quot; Tina offered. Five minutes ago she wouldn&#39;t have considered asking anybody to come along to buy bras, but right now she felt having Dillan with her would make it less awkward. For some reason it had felt okay to talk to her wearing nothing but underpants - with any other person even the thought would have made Tina freak out. Also, she knew Dillan had a car, unlike herself.<br />
&quot;Like right now? Well, why not, it&#39;s not like I have anything better to do.&quot; Dillan replied.</p>
