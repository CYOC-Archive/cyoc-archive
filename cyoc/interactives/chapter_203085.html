<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I trudged back to campus, I could see stares shooting over to me. Every one of them had to be thinking the same thing, &#39;What the hell is that smell?&#39; I&#39;d started to adapt to it, but I knew it was still there. &#39;Shower. I need a shower,&#39; I continued to grumble as I headed back to the dorm. Before I even got into the bathroom, I&#39;d started stripping.<br />
<br />
But it wasn&#39;t until I hit the water that I could relax. &quot;There we go...&quot; A deep relaxation overcame me as the water and soap ran down my body. Remembering that there might be more to this werewolf thing than I originally thought was stressed me out again. &quot;It&#39;s alright...&quot; I told myself. &quot;We&#39;ll figure it out when we get to it... Just relax...&quot;<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, I hopped out of the shower and started to dry off. However, as I dried my body, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit jealous. I&#39;d been having fun changing Ethan and Josh. Why not me? I was curious what it would feel like. And looking in the mirror, I couldn&#39;t help but be jealous of what I&#39;d given them. Both of them had a rockin bod. Why not me?<br />
<br />
I flexed in the mirror, watching my thin little arms try their best to show off some kind of muscle. At 5&#39;8&quot; and 140 pounds there really wasn&#39;t anything there at all. I always kind of hated just how skinny I was. But with the notebook all of that could change. I went back to my room and grabbed it. Then went back to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; I breathed. Suddenly a bit of fear ran through me. If I changed myself, would I be able to change back? Or would I forget my old life and everything about it? Or would I garner the same feelings I have now and then never lose the desire to grow making me grow impossibly large. &quot;CALM DOWN!&quot; I gripped the counter. &quot;Fuck...&quot; I couldn&#39;t believe how much my heart was racing. &#39;A contingency plan... I&#39;ll make a contingency plan.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I will always know what changed about myself. I&#39;ll be able to hold my original set of memories along with the memories of who I change into at the same time. If I say, &#39;Pickled Sourcrout,&#39; any changes that I&#39;ve made about myself will revert back to how I am at this moment.&#39; <br />
<br />
I reread the statement five or six times just to make sure everything came out correctly. But the lingering fear still held on. &quot;Something small then. I&#39;ll start with something small.&quot; I went back to the notebook and wrote a single sentence. &#39;I have long red hair.&#39; The ink glowed and then turned black. Instantly my head started to feel like it was getting a bit of a massage. Thousands of little soft pricks covered my scalp. And just as I had written, my dirty blond hair turned bright red and started to grow. It quickly dropped down onto my shoulders and then a bit further.<br />
<br />
&quot;It worked!&quot; I flipped it back and forth. Then tried to think about how my life would be different. Several stretchy hair bands covered the sink so I could wrap it into a ponytail. The shower also had a couple of different bottles in them. I could instantly recognize them as hair strengthening shampoo along with vitamins and mineral to make sure my hair would tangle or fray. And then so many memories of my mom telling me to cut it off. Along with a few people calling me Ariel. My mood soured as I thought about it more. &quot;Pickled Sourcrout.&quot; As the word left my mouth, that same tingling happened. This time my hair receded back into my head and lost the bright red color it had. The sink was cleared of any of the hair bands and the shampoo returned to the single all-purpose use that I always had.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#39;t done though. &#39;I&#39;m built like a wrestler you see on TV. I&#39;m at least 6&#39;6&quot; and well over 250 pounds of pure muscle.&#39; As soon as I lifted my pencil, I could feel it. There was a constant comfortable massage running up each of my body. All the way down into my bones. Muscle started to pack onto my frame. It was like thousands upon thousands of workouts were all being done at once. My thin little body was bulking up. <br />
<br />
My blood started pumping faster. With each pump I gained another couple of pounds. I could see my biceps starting to mold into a more rounds shape. Thick forearms grew to be able to pick up heavy things. My hands were doubling in size and only growing bigger. &quot;This is crazy,&quot; I panted. Fear and excitement were swirling together at the impressive display. Yet, I only wanted it to keep going. I could feel my feet stretching against the cheap laminate flooring below me. It was almost as though my toes were walking forward. Growing from their 9 1/2 size to something far larger.<br />
<br />
My calves had doubled in size. Easily building a perfect diamond shape as they gained their size. Thick quads grew on the upper parts of my legs. They flared wide and then narrowed back down into my knees. The towel I was wearing dropped. I&#39;d completely forgotten about it, but with my widening hips, there was no way it could have stayed on me. Even though I wasn&#39;t getting fat, my hips had to grow as my body stretched upward. I could feel the massage on each of the bones, slowly making them grow thicker and longer. I reached to the sky feeling the growth through my entire body.<br />
<br />
Before I knew it my fingertips were touching the ten-foot ceiling. Then parts of my fingers. Then my palms. Then I had to bend my elbows a bit. &quot;Holy shit...&quot; I said. Followed quickly by shock at the depth of my voice as it resonated off the walls. Gone was the near high pitched squeak that I had. The width of my neck had grown so wide that anything other than a deep base wouldn&#39;t come out of it.<br />
<br />
I flexed, trying my best to copy the ones that I&#39;d seen online. My bicep continued to grow. It had to be over 20 inches by now. I could see a thick vein running down it as more blood pumped into it. It was the same with my forearms. The group of veins all seemed to bulge out at the same time. I gripped my heavy pec. &quot;OOO!&quot; I nearly fell over as I felt my sensitive nipple. It went hard as a rock as did my dick that throbbed between my legs. <br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t believe how big I looked. The bathroom was always small, but now I was having trouble moving without knocking something over. My long thick bodybuilder shaped arms almost seemed to touch both ends of the bathroom even as they rested beside me. The door was below my line of sight. I figured I&#39;d have to duck to get out but with my wide shoulders, I definitely have to twist a bit as well. Luckily, I still had a relatively thin waist, packed with six muscles that showed even when I wasn&#39;t flexing.<br />
<br />
Naturally I looked down, completely forgetting that I now had a massive chest in the way. All I could see were the two pecs jutting far out in front of me. I straightened up my posture and looked in the mirror. My 5-inch cock looked so tiny on my body. And next to my hand it looked absolutely miniscule. A smile crept onto my face. &quot;Guess I&#39;ll have to change that next. But first...&quot; I looked over at the scale on the ground. Stepping on it, I heard a loud crack. &quot;Uh-oh...&quot; I muttered. The max weight was supposed to be 300 pounds. I stepped off and looked at the damage. <br />
<br />
&#39;Simple fix,&#39; I said to myself going back to the notebook. The pencil was hard to hold as it barely fit into my hand. I quickly wrote, &#39;The scale in the bathroom that can measure the weight of an elephant despite being no larger than any other human sized scale.&#39; Though, looking around I realized that the doorframe was now no longer way above me. If anything, it felt almost an inch or two below my line of sight. Then added, &#39;There is a ruler along the bathroom wall to measure heights.&#39; It appeared right over the scale.<br />
<br />
&#39;First things first,&#39; I stepped on the scale. The red numbers popped up. &#39;364.&#39; &quot;WHAT!?&quot; I shouted, backing off on it. I hadn&#39;t even realized what the first scale meant. &quot;I wrote 250. Why am I 100 pounds more than that?&quot; I looked back at the wording. The words, &#39;at least&#39; popped out. And with my desire for size, the notebook seemed more than happy to oblige on giving me the size I desired. Though looking back at the ruler on the wall, I was starting to feel a bit hesitant. But I had to know. I stood up against it and the looked in the mirror. &quot;Se-seven feet?!&quot; <br />
<br />
I was an absolute monster. I added another flex showing off my shoulders and arms. They throbbed a bit bigger. &quot;Wait! What?!&quot; I quickly stepped on the scale again. &#39;369.&#39; &quot;No way...&quot; I muttered. My dick throbbed in excitement. But I still had one more idea before finishing.</p>
