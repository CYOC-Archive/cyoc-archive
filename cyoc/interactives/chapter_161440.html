<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So this is the home your former sister resides in Fukushu?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu nodded, glancing at Casseus as they gazed at the Tozawa residence. &quot;This is where Kari was the last time I was here Casseus,&quot; he said. &quot;And from what I&#39;ve learned she is here today, along with her cousin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus nodded, brushing a stray silver hair from his face as he studied the Tozawa residence. &quot;I fail to see why Lord Villar has sent you with me on this mission,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;I am more than capable of handling children.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu smirked, gazing at the man with a mild amount of amusement. &quot;You may have planned this strategy Casseus but you are no warrior,&quot; he said. &quot;These wizards are far stronger than you believe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve defeated them in other timelines kitsune,&quot; Casseus growled. &quot;And I have faired far better in combat than you have.&quot; Fukushu snarled, grabbing the man by the shoulder and spinning him towards him. Although in human form, Fukushus features began to shift, his face becoming more feral as his eyes glinted with animalistic fury.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it wasnt for my actions Villar would have presense here,&quot; he acidly replied. &quot;I defeated the wizards, took Pendragons child and held them at bay. If you believe that just because they survived that I have failed you are sorely mistaken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They did survive,&quot; Casseus snapped. &quot;That alone should have shown our Lord you are unworthy of his trust. Now watch as I show you how to deal with mortals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu raised an eyebrow before a wide grin spread across his face. Casseus may be powerful and a cunning strategist but he was about to learn a hard lesson. Shrugging his shoulders the kitsune leaned back, gesturing towards the Tozawa residence. &quot;Good luck,&quot; he thought with a grin.<br />
<br />
Naomi let out an exasperated sigh as she now chased Tommy out of the kitchen. Unfortunately she had been tasked with watching her niece and nephew today as their parents were busy. While Tom Harris said he would stop by to pick up the children soon, it meant Naomi was going to have her hands full watching a 1 year old Kari and 3 year old Tommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy stop running,&quot; Naomi exclaimed as the toddler sped through the living room. Tommy seemed to give the teenager little worry as he ran off giggling. &quot;Having trouble?&quot; Naomi turned to see her girlfriend Felicia smirking, the 1 year old Kari on her hip. &quot;Ugh Tommy wont listen,&quot; Naomi sighed.<br />
<br />
Felicia chuckled softly, handing her girlfriend a cup of coffee that she gratefully took. &quot;So I take it your nephew wasnt interested in Dragonball?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kid has no taste,&quot; Naomi grumbled. Felicia laughed harder, shaking her head as she lovingly gazed at Naomi. &quot;I told you the kids are too young for anime,&quot; she laughed. &quot;You should of stuck with Sesame Street or anything on Disney.&quot; Naomi waved away her girlfriend&#39;s opinion as she stretched. &quot;Well at least the kids ate and Mr. Harris is coming soon.&quot; <br />
<br />
A knock at the door now drew both teens attention, while they were expecting Mr. Harris, they were still cautious. &quot;Can I help you?&quot; Casseus grinned as he stared at the teen and toddler in the doorway. This would be too easy, how had Fukushu and the others had so many problems with these wizards. As he began to cast his spell he could see the tiny girl frown as she began to transform into a small anthro fox. Tiny fox ears and a small tail pooped out of the 1 year old as dark fur began to cover her body.<br />
<br />
Felicia noticed Kari&#39;s anthro transformation, her eyes going wide in alarm. Felicia had babysat the kitsune toddler enough to know she would transform like this if alarmed. Sensing that the handsome silver haired man now meant to cause harm she called for Naomi before erecting a magical barrier. &quot;Naomi we have trouble!&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi&#39;s head shot up in alarm, grabbing her transformation wand and hurrying Tommy behind her she ran towards the front door. Felicia&#39;s barrier was holding as the silver haired man smiled wickedly at them. Already Felicia was rushing backwards for cover, the anthro fox toddler held tightly in her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of here,&quot; Naomi bellowed as the silver haired man smiled. &quot;Felicia knock him back!&quot; Felicia nodded, focusing her will through her pendant. Ever since the girls had received their magical items over the summer they had been practicing. Felicia found she had a talent for creating force barriers, which she could then use to push people and items away. Straining she now willed the barrier she had erected forward, pushing the man back maybe a couple of feet.<br />
<br />
Casseus smirked as he felt the teens barrier push hom backwards. While still standing, he was impressed the girl could perform such feats. &quot;Impressive,&quot; he said. &quot;You appear to have a bit more strength than the others I have defeated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you,&quot; Felicia asked, still clutching a now angry anthro toddler to her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Casseus,&quot; he said. &quot;A servant of Lord Villar and the last thing you shall ever see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi had watched Casseus speak as she sped forward, while she had no idea who he was, she did know she needed to protect her niece and nephew. Fortunately for Naomi she had a few tricks up her sleeve. The teen had discovered pretty quickly that her wand was only limited by her imagination. Seeing as her imagination consisted of an extensive anime library, she had an idea of how to deal with this intruder. Placing her hands together, Naomi yelled out as a wave of energy rocketed towards Casseus.<br />
<br />
Casseus&#39;s eyes went wide as he was struck with an impressive amount of magical force. Dropping to one knee, he gasped as he gazed at the Asian teenage girl. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naomi Tozawa,&quot; she smirked, placing her hands on her hips. &quot;Just a wizard for fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ you did not just paraphrase Saitama,&quot; Felica groaned as she shook her head.<br />
<br />
Casseus grit his teeth, standing before the teens as he now prepared another spell. &quot;Oh no you don&#39;t,&quot; Naomi bellowed, using her wand to propel her into the air. Casseus looked up, shocked to see this teen begin to glow with electrical energy. &quot;Tozawa SMASH,&quot; she yelled as she brought her wand hand down, releasing an incredible amount of force onto Casseus.<br />
<br />
The impact of Naomi&#39;s spell left a sizable impact crater as Casseus dropped to a knee once more. He was shocked by the power this teen generated into her spells. As the dust began to settle he glared angrily at the two teens.<br />
<br />
Naomi and Felicia had stepped outside the house now, certain that Naomi&#39;s latest anime based spell attack had stopped their attacker for sure. Seeing the silver haired man slowly rise to his feet once more, the two teens could feel themselves go pale. &quot;Got any other ideas,&quot; Felicia whispered.<br />
<br />
Luck was on their side today, as Casseus now prepared another spell he failed to notice the SUV speeding towards him until it was too late. Tom Harris now slammed his car into Casseus, knocking him backwards and completely wrecking the car. Tom now extracted himself from his vehicle, brandishing a pistol. &quot;Get away from my grandkids!&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus sighed, thoroughly embarrassed by the situation as he looked between the teens and the old man who now confronted him. While unhurt by their attacks, his pride had been wounded. He realized he should have easily been able to destroy the three, now though he realized it would only be a matter of time before the rest of the wizards showed up. He could try to take out the children but what would be the point. Vanishing into thin air Casseus appeared beside Fukushu safely out of view.<br />
<br />
The eight tailed kitsune gave his silver haired companion a mocking smile as he now began a slow clap. &quot;Nicely done,&quot; Fukushu teased. &quot;You really showed me how to fight the mortals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet,&quot; Casseus snapped. &quot;I frightened them, that&#39;s all I needed to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Fukushu smiled as the two began to leave. &quot;If that makes you feel any better than that&#39;s what will say when we return to Villar.&quot;</p>
