<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You start walking home from the store where you picked up the flier thinking about what you were going to say to your parents. As you did you fingered the pendant that you almost always wore and remembered when you had first received it. It had been years ago and you had graduated from high school some years before that. A friend had given it to you as a birthday present. It was a disc shape with strange symbols on it that you couldn&#39;t figure out what they meant and a ruby in the center. It was on a fine gold chain that looked too delicate to be worn or to hold the pendant. However at your friend&#39;s urging you put it on and that&#39;s when your world changed. In the blink of an eye you had become six years old and your previous life had vanished.<br />
<br />
You shook your head brining yourself back to the present. You did remember who you were before but that didn&#39;t matter now. Who you are now is sixteen year old Winter Rose. You hoped to go to college and after to get a job in the video gaming industry. You figured that you would still work even if you did win the money. You may not have to work as hard but it will be better than doing nothing and you were afraid that if you didn&#39;t work that you would go through the money pretty quick.<br />
<br />
You made it home without remembering how you got there. You must have been on autopilot as you were thinking. Shaking your head and smiling you opened the door and walked inside. &quot;I&#39;m home Mom,&quot; you called out as you put your backpack down and then headed into the kitchen to put away the groceries you had picked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;How was school today Win?&quot; your mom asked as you entered the kitchen. She was preparing supper already because your dad was bringing home some investors for dinner. There was something in her voice that put you on edge a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;About the same as usual,&quot; you said shrugging and started putting the groceries away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not according to your headmistress young lady,&quot; your mom said in a stern voice which usually meant that you were in trouble. &quot;She called and said that you were in a fight in the hallway. Your father and I pay good money for you to go to that private school and we expect you to be better behaved while you&#39;re there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There wasn&#39;t a fight exactly,&quot; you said turning to look at your mom. &quot;Jake was about to hit Willie for some reason and I wasn&#39;t going to stand there and just watch it. So I touched Jake on the arm and told him that he didn&#39;t want to hit Willie. He seemed to deflate after that and that&#39;s when Miss Fields came. Everyone who had been standing around said that it was a fight even though it wasn&#39;t one exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mom nodded before saying, &quot;That&#39;s kind of what Miss Fields implied but since Jake was about to punch Willie and you touched his arm it was considered a fight. Maybe if you had just said it to him without touching him it wouldn&#39;t have been considered a fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just saying it may not have worked,&quot; you said looking down.<br />
<br />
Your mom sighed then said, &quot;I know that you couldn&#39;t just stand by and watch someone get hit Win but you need to be a bit more careful. He could have turned around and hit you instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he didn&#39;t,&quot; you point out almost in a whiny voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;But he could have,&quot; your mom said in an infuriating tone of voice. &quot;Now go get ready for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and headed up to your room to take a shower and change. Once in your room you strip off your uniform and toss it into the dry clean hamper. Stripping off your bra and panties you toss them into the hand wash and regular wash hampers respectively. Your socks also went into the regular wash hamper. Naked you go into your own bathroom and turn the shower on steaming hot. Making sure you had all the towels you would need you stepped in and moaned a little bit as the hot water hit you. You ran your hands down your body to your pussy and started to rub. You started slow then began rubbing faster and faster before slipping a couple fingers inside. You let out little moans trying to keep quiet since you didn&#39;t want your mom to hear. However that became more and more difficult as the heat radiated out from your pussy to fill your body. You slipped to your knees spreading your legs as wide as they could go in the shower and continued your ministrations. After several minutes you began to feel like you needed to pee and you knew you were on the verge of an orgasm. You slumped forward onto your arms and the hot water struck your pussy sending you over the edge with a loud screaming moan as you squirted. You stay in that position for a few minutes wondering if your mom heard you before you shakily got back to your feet and finished your shower.<br />
<br />
Once you were fully dried you went back into your room to get ready. The first thing you put on is a pair of white satin panties and thank your lucky stars that your period isn&#39;t due for another week. Next you put your hair up in a bun, put a little makeup on, and painted your nails with a pearl tinted clear nail polish. After that dried you stepped into your dress pulling it up to your breasts and zipping the back up. It was a strapless dress that was a dusty blush color with rhinestone waist and neckline that fell to your ankles. You would be stepping on the hem if you didn&#39;t wear heels so that&#39;s what you put on next. They were a pewter color with faux snakeskin pattern, open toed, a four inch heel, and an ankle strap that buckled. The pumps complimented the dress quite well though you didn&#39;t want to be standing in them too long. Most guys like girls in high heels but they never consider just what the girl goes through wearing them. To wear high heels you had to shift your weight to your toes in order to avoid breaking the heel and that caused a bit of discomfort as your weight is concentrated on a smaller area. Open toes help with the discomfort but if your toes are enclosed they tend to get scrunched together. But still me things just call for heels like this dress though you really liked this dress. Oh well it wasn&#39;t like you were going to go that far. A simple silver bracelet went on your wrist and silver earrings with small pearls went in your ears. You took off your pendant and replaced it with a simple pearl pendant on a silver chain. You looked at yourself in the mirror and smiled. You then looked at your clock and saw that it was almost dinner time. Your dad was probably home by now or soon would be and would be a bit angry if you were late for dinner. Turning you hurried to the dining room as fast as you could.</p>
