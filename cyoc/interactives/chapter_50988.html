<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Xavier was bored, his shift had ended only thirty minutes prior, and he was sitting restlessly in his bunk. He was sifting through his pack, sorting out the random necessities that he used during his shift. He picked up his canteen and sloshed around the little bit of water that was left inside. &quot;Hey, Sean&quot; Xavier said as he looking across the tent as his long time buddy. They enlisted together, went through basic training together, and somehow managed to wind up sharing a tent. Sean had even asked Xavier to be the best man at his wedding before they were deployed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's up, X?&quot; Sean responded as he looked up from a letter he recieved from his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm almost out of water, wanna refill it for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Refill it FOR you? Man you're so lazy. How about we just go there together and refill them both. Besides, I hate sitting in this tent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh fine, fine. always making me work.&quot; Xavier replied. He grabbed his Canteen and got up from his mattress. He waited for Sean to dig around in his bag for a while then they both left for the water unit.<br />
<br />
The watering unit was on the far side of the camp. It was really just a makeshift hose in the back of the tents which connected to a truck for water. When the truck ran out, they would send in a new one... nobody really knew where they got the trucks from, but a new one had just arrived this morning. There was nobody around as they walked through camp, most people were out on duty or sleeping in their tents after having just got off their shift.<br />
<br />
Sean began filling his canteen from the hose. &quot;So, Rachel said everything was great. She said she misses me, but that's all she said&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the same letter you always get, eh?&quot; Xavier replied, not really interested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much.&quot; Sean finished filling up his canteen, so he screwed the lid on and slid out of the way of the faucet so Xavier could fill his.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to find myself a nice girl to settle down with when I get back. Played that fast and loose game for too long&quot; Xavier was saying as he filled his canteen. &quot;Plus, It's been a long time since I've had a hottie suck my cock&quot; He laughed. He screwed the lid back on his canteen, and before turning off the faucet, bent over and drank some water as it flowed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's the nice thing about having a wife, ya know, you can get action whenever you want.&quot; Sean said with a smile.<br />
<br />
As Xavier stood up, he stumbled a bit and leaned against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, man?&quot; Sean asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah. no problem. Just probably got a little light headed trying to drink upside down like that.&quot; Xavier tried to laugh it off but he suddenly felt burning all over his body. He groaned in pain and fell to the ground. Sean stared in awe, helpless to do anything.<br />
<br />
Xavier began to grow. He grew about a foot taller and his frame began to widen. His army uniform began to tighten, so Xavier quickly tore it off. While he was by no means out of shape before, his tanned skin began to fill out even more with muscles. His Chest grew, his biceps bulged, his abs which were faintly defined before, were now rock hard. Xavier felt a sharp pain in his feet so he kicked off his shoes and began to wiggle out of his pants as they grew tigther and tighter. A thick brown hair grew over his legs, his thighs were now the size of tree trunks. Each muscle, which was well defined, began to disapear beneath a coat of brown fur. His ankles cracked and popped as his toes fused together to form black hooves. He let out a cry of pain. The back of his tighty whities began to bulge out as a small tail began to emerge from the top of his ass. His ass began bulge backward with growing muscle, pushing against his underwear, ripping them off. Xavier immediately flipped onto his back and threw his hands toward his face. Two horns began to grow out of his forehead, like ram's horns. He cried in agony as the pushed forward, his ears growing to a point. Xavier, laying completely naked on the sandy ground, began to feel an immense pleasure as his balls began to grow. His balls became thick and leather, expanding to the size of grapefruits. His cock began attaching itself to his rock hard abs in a sheath. His black cock rose out of the sheath, completely erect as the transformation stopped.<br />
<br />
Xavier Placed his hands on the ground and pushed himself up, wobbling on his new hooves.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck just happened to you man?!&quot; Sean cried in terror. &quot;You turned into a fucking Satyr!&quot;<br />
<br />
Xavier didn't respond at first, he just moaned and rubbed his body. His muscles flexed as he ran his fingers across his large pecs. The sun shining off his brown latino skin. He reached back and felt his tail, and slid his fingers down to run them through the fur and over his large muscular ass. &quot;Damn. I got junk in the trunk now&quot; Xavier laughed. Sean didn't respond, but just stared at his friend who stood 7 1/2 feet tall. Xavier's laugh quickly turned into a moan though as he grabbed his 11 inch cock and began to rub it. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot; Sean asked in disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please man! I need you to get me off!&quot; Xavier moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woaaah. No way dude!&quot; Sean exclaimed as he took a step back. &quot;I'm not gay man, you can do that on your own time after you see the captain about what the hell happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;PLEASE&quot; Xavier moaned. As he pleaded, a small bit of spit flew off his lip and landed on Sean's. Not even aware of it, Sean licked his lips, simply because they were getting dry from the hot Iraqi sun. <br />
<br />
&quot;listen dude,&quot; Sean started, &quot;We need to get you help. You turned into a Satyr... I thought those things were made up!&quot; Suddenly Sean noticed how good Xavier smelled. Sean looked at Xavier, at his friend, and saw the veins bulging from his biceps. He saw the beads of sweat drip over his carmel abs. He saw his small, perfect nipples on the edges of his ripped chest. All he wanted to do was to press up close to Xavier and lick all that sweat off. &quot;What am I thinking? I'm not gay!&quot; Sean thought in horror. Sean absentmindedly reached his hand down to feel his throbbing erection through his pants. He then looked down at Xavier's monster cock and bent down to the ground towards it. Without thinking he put it in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Xavier let out a loud moan as he grabbed Sean's head and pushed his cock into Sean's mouth. Sean reached up and ran his hands through Xavier's hairy legs, and around to grab his tight muscular ass. Little did Sean know, some changes began to take over him too. As he sucked away at Xavier's cock, small horns began to grow out of his forehead, they were much smaller than Xavier's. But Xavier grabbed a hold of them to thrust Sean's head onto his cock. Sean Moaned in pleasure as he felt Xavier's leather balls slap up against his chin with each thrust. Sean began to massage them, and smell their sweet odor. Sean was in too much ecstasy to notice himself growing in height as well, or his feet changing into hooves, or his chest expanding outwards. Suddenly, his clothes grew too tight and he had to get out of them. He quickly ripped them off. Xavier, seeing his friend Sean now completely naked, wanted nothing more than to fuck him. So, he pushed him down onto his back on the ground.<br />
<br />
Naked, and on the ground, Sean suddenly realized something was wrong... He didn't have pecs, He had breasts! He reached down to where his cock used to be only to feel his new vagina. He had turned into a female, a female satyr! He quickly sat up. &quot;Oh my god! I'm a female!&quot; He said in a high pitched voice.<br />
<br />
Xavier looked down at Sean, eying his large breasts, his spread legs covered in fur, and the tight vagina that lay between them. &quot;See, then you're not Gay.&quot; He said as he moved down toward Sean.<br />
<br />
Sean wanted nothing more in the world than to be fucked by his best friend. He reached up and grabbed Xavier's horns and pulled his face close to his as they kissed passionately. Xavier grabbed Sean's Breasts, running his thumb over Sean's nipple. Sean ran one hand from Xavier's horn, down his strong muscular back. His hand ran over Xavier's tail and onto his ass. He grabbed a hold of hit and pulled Xavier in tight. Sean let out a gasp as Xavier's long cock entered his Vagina for the first time. Waves of pleasure rocked Sean's body. Xavier began to thrust in and out of Sean, moaning in pleasure. Sean's cloven hooves were stamping on the ground as he tried to push himself into Xavier's thrusts.<br />
<br />
It wasn't long before Xavier let out a loud moan in ecstacy as he let loose his huge Satyr load into Sean.<br />
<br />
Sean wailed as his whole body shook with the most intense orgasm he ever had. He didn't care about anything else in the world, but his new love for Xavier. As Xavier began to lower himself down beside Sean, they kissed a few more times, unaware that the soldiers currently on duty had filled up their canteens with the water tankard as well.</p>
