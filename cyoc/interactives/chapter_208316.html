<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Have you found anything beloved?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith shook her head, sighing in annoyance as she perused the Normals computer systems. The meeting with Jack and Kellie had troubled the elf assassin and her kitsune lover. Morgan had attacked Jack, taken a Ring of Change and vanished. Yuriko was concerned, asking a favor of her old enemies. A favor that neither one wished to do, yet felt obligated for the soul purpose of their child. &quot;Nothing yet,&quot; Abolith sighed. &quot;I need more time to investigate the Normals files.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Time is a luxury we may not have,&quot; Fukushu grumbled. &quot;It is only a matter of time before the Normal realize we are here.&quot; Abolith now paused, glancing at the kitsune in annoyance. &quot;Shay has always been a reliable source,&quot; she frowned. &quot;You may not think highly of the Nekomata but her information has always been accurate. She told us about this factory after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu grumbled a response, which Abolith could not quite hear. As much as he hated to admit it, Shay had given them a nugget of information none had expected. The location of the newest acquisition of the Normal, a Soul Drive factory located just outside of Darren&#39;s hometown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shay is a mercenary and opportunist,&quot; Fukushu grumbled. &quot;Her loyalties lie only with those that have the largest bank account.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fortunately our pockets are quite deep beloved,&quot; Abolith stated. &quot;And in case you hadn&#39;t noticed I too am a mercenary. Do you feel the same way about me?&quot; Fukushu appeared flummoxed, narrowing his eyes as he gazed at the arrogant smirk on Aboliths face. Sometimes the elves sense of humor drove him mad. &quot;Just finish the task so we can leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith chuckled softly, she did enjoy pushing Fukushu&#39;s buttons sometimes. Still, she had a job to do. Unfortunately, it appeared the information in regards to Morgan wasn&#39;t present. &quot;There&#39;s nothing here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course there isn&#39;t what were you expecting?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu and Abolith turned, the kitsune drawing his sword as he growled at the voice. Standing at the entrance was the Boss, the hooded figure now watching the pair with intrigue as his soldiers now surrounded the couple. &quot;Boss,&quot; Fukushu hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu, Abolith,&quot; he stated. &quot;Care to tell me why you&#39;ve broken into my place of business?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu now stood in front of Abolith, shielding the elf as he glared at the Boss. Quickly he now evaluated his attackers, the soldiers themselves were of no concern, however, Fukushu realized their were more including the kumiho and Casseus. While he liked his chances in an attack, this was not the time for a confrontation, especially with Raidens safety as a concern. &quot;Where is Morgan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Straight to the point,&quot; the Boss said. &quot;I like that. No frivolous threats or blustering just down to business.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is she Boss,&quot; Fukushu repeated, his voice tinged with anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you relax,&quot; the Boss countered. &quot;I&#39;m getting to that. Besides you&#39;re the one that broke into my factory. I&#39;d hate to see an end to our arrangement. I&#39;m sure Raiden would hate for that to happen too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is he talking about,&quot; Abolith asked. &quot;What arrangement?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu and the Boss paused, the kitsunes eyes twitching as he glared at the Boss. &quot;Oh he didn&#39;t tell you,&quot; the Boss exclaimed happily. &quot;Uh oh Fukushu, someone&#39;s in trouble!&quot; Fukushu said nothing, his mouth curling into a sneer as he focused on the hooded figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Abolith,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;Your husband here decided to call a truce. He won&#39;t attack us just as long as we leave your son alone. In return he won&#39;t come to the Catalysts aid if my organization decides to move against him.&quot; The Boss now shook his head, a clucking sound coming from his mouth as he wagged his finger at Fukushu disapprovingly. &quot;Shame, shame, Fukushu. Don&#39;t you know marriage is built on trust. Now why would you leave the wifey out of the loop?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu said nothing, feeling Aboliths gaze burn into him. The Boss was enjoying this far more than he wished. As much as he wished to strike this irritating man down, for the sake of his son he would control his temper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re worried I&#39;m going to break our agreement,&quot; he said. &quot;Have Morgan go after your kid. Honestly I can&#39;t blame you on that. From what I&#39;ve heard once you have kids you really stop thinking rationally. I&#39;ll cut you a break this time. Morgans gone, she left our organization.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean she left,&quot; Abolith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It means she&#39;s gone,&quot; the Boss answered. &quot;Quit. Decided to go solo, try her luck on her own. Be master of her domain, a strong independent woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We get it,&quot; Fukushu replied angrily. &quot;Where did she go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your guess is as good as mine,&quot; the Boss shrugged. Fukushu and Abolith casting him a dubious look. &quot;I&#39;m being serious. Turns out she was able to destroy our counter measures as well as any tracking methods. We haven&#39;t seen her since Evans untimely passing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should I believe you,&quot; Abolith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got no reason to lie,&quot; the Boss said. &quot;There&#39;s no advantage. If I did have Morgan, I&#39;d show you. And you both know that.&quot; Fukushu and Abolith nodded, the Bosses arrogance was such that if Morgan was present, he would have her make a grand entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now&quot; the Biss said taking a breath. &quot;We have a bit of a situation here. You two are trespassing. Step away from the computer and comply with a search. I want to make sure you two aren&#39;t trying to take any of our trade secrets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I refuse,&quot; Fukushu threatened, drawing his blade slowly into an attack position. The soldiers now leveled their rifles, several red dots from the laser scopes resting on Abolith and Fukushu. The Boss though was unmoved, taking a step forward before answering.<br />
<br />
&quot;You willing to bet your sons life on that,&quot; he asked, his voice venomous. &quot;Do you really think that we don&#39;t have our people keeping an eye on him? Our pact is keeping them from harming him but believe me. You break it and I give my word he&#39;ll suffer before we finish him off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu and Abolith tensed, their eyes going wide with anger. Soghing the two nodded, Fukushu sheathing his sword before glaring at the Boss. As soldiers now approached, he stopped them. &quot;Search Fukushu I&#39;ll take care of Abolith.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith glared at the Boss, feeling disgusted by the hooded figures mere presence. Slowly he now walked behind her, the elf tense as he began to pat search her.<br />
<br />
Fukushu was incensed, silently seething as he watched the Boss. Obviously the man&#39;s idea of a pat search was far from what he had anticipated. The Boss now ran his hands over Abolith, groping the elf as he inspected her body. Abokith was clearly uncomfortable, taking a sharp breath as he squeezed her breasts and ass. As a final insult he now spoke to Fukushu as he gazed into Aboliths eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see why she&#39;s so special,&quot; he leered. &quot;She obviously keeps herself in tremendous shape.&quot; Abolith snarled, spitting directly into the Bosses face. The man wincing, now trying to wipe the spit from his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I probably deserve that,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Now get the fuck out of my building or I&#39;m calling the cops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu and Abolith now turned to leave, Abolith feeling violated as Fukushu seethe. They had gained a valuable piece of information, yet Fukushu had much to answer for. Already the kitsune was dreading what Abolith would do when they reached home.</p>
