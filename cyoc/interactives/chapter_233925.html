<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jeff enters his room a minute later with the drinks, and after handing Mike his glass, Mike tells Jeff to sit down. Jeff sits down on the edge of his bed, looking at his uncle, “you look as if you have something on your mind, uncle,” the teen says.<br />
<br />
“Actually, I do,” Mike replies, “I couldn’t help noticing your Chronivac and I just had to read the manual. I saw that you have scanned yourself, so I assume you have already tried something out?”<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitates, knowing his uncle, this could either end up being something good or bad, depending on how he, Jeff, will reply. “Actually,” Jeff says after a while, “I haven’t tried anything yet, but there are some things that I’d like to try”.<br />
<br />
“I figured, when reading through your stats, I noticed that you seem to be curious about a lot of things, like being a girl, a toy and even a vehicle”.<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes a little, “y-yeah… I know it’s weird, and I honestly don’t really know why I’m curious to want to know what it would be like being a toy, vehicle or some other object. When it comes to being a girl… I just kinda would like to know if it would feel any different from being a boy”.<br />
<br />
Mike chuckles, “hey, no need to be embarrassed,” he says, “you are young and just want to experiment, I totally understand”.<br />
<br />
“Let me guess,” Jeff says, “you want to suggest that I become something for the two weeks you are here?”<br />
<br />
Mike nods, “correct, and I have an idea of something that could be fun for all of us”.<br />
<br />
“Like what?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I always wanted an RV to go camping,” Mike says, “so, how would you like to become an RV for two weeks?”<br />
<br />
Jeff doesn’t say a word, but Mike can see the look of excitement in Jeff’s eyes, “that… does sound intriguing,” the teen then says, “but, would I still have my mind, and would I be able to control my new body?”<br />
<br />
Mike chuckles, “well, you will still have your mind, but not the control of your body, the only control you’d have would be turning on the radio to be able to speak”.<br />
<br />
“That’ll be okay,” Jeff says, “would you let Cody and Andy know?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Mike says, “it’ll be best if they’d know, I don’t want them to damage you in some way”.<br />
<br />
Jeff shudders, “yeah… knowing Cody, he doesn’t go easy on objects, I don’t want to end up getting hurt. What kind of RV would I be?”.<br />
<br />
“I was thinking of transforming you into a 2024 Newmar Essex 45’ RV,” Mike says.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen, “that is one big and luxurious RV,” he says.<br />
<br />
Mike smiles, “that it is,” he says, “it’s also my dream RV I’d love to have. This could be a win-win situation: your curiosity would be fulfilled and I’ll get to experience having my dream RV and see if it would really be the right pick”.<br />
<br />
Jeff thinks about it for a while, he then smiles, “okay, I’m in,” he says, “though it’s kinda sad that I won’t be able to have fun in the forest or wherever you decide to go camping”.<br />
<br />
“How about, you become an RV to get us to the destination, I’d transform you back into yourself, so that you can have fun during the day, but at night and for the journey back here, I’d transform you back into an RV”.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm… that sounds like a plan,” Jeff says, “okay! Let’s do this!”<br />
<br />
Mike chuckles, “okay, let me get the transformation set and we can be on our way,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff watches his uncle start to eagerly type into the Chronivac, unaware that his uncle had copied the program onto his phone, including his file, and created an independent Chronivac-App.<br />
<br />
After half an hour, maybe even an hour, Mike finally turns around to face Jeff, “okay, so this is what I have set,” he says, “first, your body, from your neck down, will take on the color of the paintjob of the RV, your hands and feet will be black, since they’ll become the tires. Since you can’t run around naked, your new skin will look like a body hugging jumpsuit”.<br />
<br />
“Okay, but what about my… um… boy-parts,” Jeff asks with a blush.<br />
<br />
Mike chuckles, “don’t worry, while you’re in your human form, your boy-parts will be there, yeah, you’d be “naked”, but no one will notice, they’ll all think you are wearing a full body one-piece swimsuit,” he says, “but they’d be black, just like the rest of your crotch, hips and butt, since they’ll become the gear shift, and before you ask: no, you will not feel any sort of pleasure while in your RV form, I don’t want you to moan every time I change the gears. However, in your human form the feeling will be there”.<br />
<br />
“So, while I’m an RV my cock will be numb,” Jeff says, “and when I’m myself, the feeling will return and function normally”.<br />
<br />
Mike nods, “correct,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I can live with that,” Jeff says, “I won’t be needing my cock while in my RV-form anyway, and I agree, it would really be better if I wouldn’t feel you touching and shifting “IT” around”.<br />
<br />
Mike chuckles, “yeah… no homo,” he says, “anyway, I’ve set the change to be permanent, but setting it so I’ll be able to transform you back and forth manually. I’ve also altered the reality, so that everyone will think it’s normal the way you look in your human-form, only you, me and the boys will know the truth”.<br />
<br />
“Sounds good so far,” Jeff says, “is that all?”<br />
<br />
Mike nods, “yep, so, are you ready to become my RV,” he asks, ‘what Jeff doesn’t know, and doesn’t NEED to know, is that he’ll be registered as my RV, which I legally have to do, in the national registration system for vehicles,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“I’m kinda nervous and a little scared to be honest,” Jeff says, “but, yeah, I’m ready!”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I have set the transformation to be painless, it’ll just feel weird to you but will not hurt”.<br />
<br />
“Okay, that calms me a little,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Let me get the boys, then we’ll head outside, you’ll need a lot of room,” Mike says, “do not worry about being seen, the reality alteration I have set will cause everyone, except me, the boys and you, to not pay any attention towards you”.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “okay,” he says, “I guess you want me to… um… strip naked?”.<br />
<br />
Mike nods, “yep, I’ll go and get the boys,” he says.<br />
<br />
“It’ll feel so wrong being nude in front of Andy and Cody,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t you worry, they won’t mind, besides: we are all men here,” Mike chuckles.<br />
<br />
Jeff just rolls his eyes, “just get them,” he says as he begins to strip.<br />
<br />
Just as Jeff removes his last sock, Mike returns with Cody and Andy, “so, bro,” Cody says, a cheeky smirk on his face, “finally becoming something useful for a change?”<br />
<br />
Jeff scowls at his brother, “why do you hate me so much,” he asks, “what have I done?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I don’t hate you, Jeff,” Cody says, “in reality I’d love to do things with you, but you always ignore me, call me “annoying” and you prefer spending time playing video games”.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighs, “I know, and I’m sorry,” he says, “I admit that I’m not the best “big brother”, but I want to change that. Maybe… maybe we can get closer over the two weeks, I want to be the big brother you deserve”.<br />
<br />
Cody smiles, “it’ll be a long and rough path,” he says, “but I think we’ll make it work,” the 10-year-old smirks inwardly, ‘hehe… imagining Jeff becoming an RV, an OBJECT, is kinda cool! He’s far more useful as an object, that’s it! From now on I’ll see him not as my brother, but as an object! I just got to get my hands on that program,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “I have a feeling, that we’ll be closer after the two weeks,” he says, unaware of what his little brother is thinking and planning.<br />
<br />
“I believe so too,” Cody replies.<br />
<br />
Mike and Andy smile, “it’s nice to see you two try to come together,” Andy says.<br />
<br />
Mike nods, “and I think you will definitely be closer than you are now after the two weeks,” he says, “now, let’s head outside, time for Jeff to become the RV”.<br />
<br />
Jeff, Cody and Andy start heading down the stairs and out the front of the house, Jeff’s face is red as a tomato, “this… this is humiliating,” he mumbles as he walks down the path and steps onto the street, then gets down on his hands and knees.<br />
<br />
Cody mentally smirks, ‘Jeff looks so helpless, submissive and kinda cute like that,’ the 10-year-old thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Jeff then feels a pins-and-needles sensation run through his body, “looks like it’s about to start,” he says, hearing the footsteps of Mike walking towards them.<br />
<br />
Mike, Cody and Andy watch in excitement, though at first nothing seems to be happening, but then Andy notices something, “hey, look, his feet are becoming black,” he says, sure enough the three watch as the color travels up the teen’s body, changing color as it goes.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s legs and arms become silver, while his hands become black, like his feet, the rest of his body becomes a beautiful dark blue color, with white highlights on his sides.<br />
<br />
“Already looking good,” Mike says, grinning.<br />
<br />
“It feels weird,” Jeff says, the teen then groans when his arms and legs start to reposition themselves, the teen watches in amazement as his arms become the suspension, the same happening with his legs, while he feels his hands and feet take on a rubbery texture and begin to swell.<br />
<br />
Cody and Andy widen their eyes as they watch Jeff change, “this is freaking creepy,” both say.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but kinda cool, eh, boys,” Mike asks.<br />
<br />
“Hehe… yeah,” the boys say.<br />
<br />
Jeff continues to groan as his body begins to become wider, higher and longer, he feels his cock vanishing and reappearing inside his changing head, which already looks more like a vehicle than human. His eyes have merged together, becoming the windshield, his mouth is open in a wide toothy grin, his teeth becoming the grill with the word “ESSEX” written in silver letters above it. Jeff feels his insides change to the interior of the RV he’s becoming, while his stomach becomes the tank and the digested food become the petrol, his lungs become the AC and cooling unit, his heart become the engine and his brain become the on-board computer. Jeff feels his butt merge and hollow out, becoming a “garage” for a car, he feels cabinets made of mahogany, tiles made out of marble, a couch, leather armchairs, multiple large TVs, bedrooms with large queen sized beds, showers, toilettes and anything a RV needs, including a washing machine, a dryer, be created from his insides, soon Jeff is gone and in his place is a brand new Newmar Essex RV.<br />
<br />
Mike, Cody and Andy stare in disbelief and amazement at the RV in front of them, “hoooooly crap,” the two boys breath.<br />
<br />
“Let’s check out the inside,” Mike says, unable to hide his excitement, the man pops open the door and the three climb in, gasping at the size and quality of the interior, “this… this is exactly what I dreamed of,” Mike says.<br />
<br />
“Man, this “RV” sure is luxurious,” Andy and Cody say, starting to examine every inch of the RV.<br />
<br />
Mike himself takes in everything, walking to the driver booth, smiling when he finds keys sticking in the ignition. The man turns the radio on, “Jeff, you okay,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah… I’m fine,” the voice of Jeff is heard over the speakers, “it just feels so weird not able to move on my own and have people inside of me, I feel everything, but it’s not uncomfortable, it kinda feels nice in a weird way. So… how do I look? Am I what you have wanted?”<br />
<br />
“Heck yeah,” Mike says, “you are EXACTLY what I want my dream RV to look like! You are perfect! I’ll snap a picture and when you are in your human-form I’ll show it to you!”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jeff says, “I’m glad I turned out the way you wanted! I think you’ll be a great owner,” Jeff doesn’t seem to notice calling his uncle “owner”.<br />
<br />
Mike grins, ‘Jeff has no idea, it seems that the registration caused him to now see me as his “owner”,’ he thinks to himself, “oh, I promise I’ll be the best owner, I’ll take really good care of you, I promise. Now, if you’ll excuse me and the boys, we have some packing to do,” Mike then says.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I’m kinda excited and can’t WAIT to finally be driven,” Jeff says, “I feel sooooo giddy!”<br />
<br />
Mike chuckles, patting the dashboard of the RV, “patience, we’ll be leaving soon,” he says, he then calls the boys and they head into the house to pack everything they need.<br />
<br />
Without Mike noticing, Cody sneaks into Jeff’s room, grinning wide when He notices that the Laptop is still on and the program is still running. The 10-year-old quickly takes out his phone and soon he now owns his own independent Chronivac-App with Jeff’s file stored in the “scanned subjects”.</p>
