<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the first few tests with the ring&#39;s power, Katie was rather pleased. &quot;I think our experiment is going well,&quot; she said to Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I think we can do more than this,&quot; said Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; asked Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve only been changing one kid at a time, and so far it&#39;s always been girl. I think we should try changing multiple kids of a mixed group,&quot; said Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, and where do you see such a group?&quot; asked Katie.<br />
<br />
Bobby looked around the beach. Eventually, he spotted a few kids working on a sand castle. &quot;They will do,&quot; he said. With that, he and Katie started to walk over.<br />
<br />
The kids&#39; black hair was easy to see from a distance. But as they got closer, they were able to notice the slanted eyes and facial features that showed they had Asian ancestry. There were two boys and one girl. One boy was pale, a little on the skinny side, and was wearing glasses along with blue trunks. The other boy was a bit tubby, had browner skin than the other two, and was wearing black trunks with red floral prints. The girl was younger than either of them and was wearing a white two piece. It seemed clear that the girl was the younger sister to the paler boy. The other boy seemed to be a friend of the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you building a sand castle?&quot; asked Katie in a sweet voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m helping even if Alan says I get in the way a lot,&quot; said the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t talk to strangers, Lacy,&quot; said the paler boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lacy?&quot; asked Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s short for Alicia, but Lacy&#39;s prettier. Right, Tony?&quot; asked the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; said the brown boy offhandedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want a tip to make your sand castle bigger?&quot; asked Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Tony.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all a matter of how you press it,&quot; said Bobby. He took Tony&#39;s hand and pressed them gently against the sand mound. Katie guided the two siblings&#39; hands to show the right way to press the sand. Of course, that was just to start the magic working. After that, Katie and Bobby started walking off, but only to a distance where they can look back and watch the changes.<br />
<br />
The changes were subtle at first. The three kids were slowly growing bigger and not much more. But Alan and Tony were closer to being teens and when they crossed over into 13, the changes became more noticeable. It wasn&#39;t just them growing bigger. Their arms and legs were growing longer and leaner. Their torsos were also starting to stretch out. The baby fat clinging to them started melt away. In Tony&#39;s case, his fat was receding even faster.<br />
<br />
Lacy was not far behind. In fact, she seemed to be growing at a slightly faster pace. Perhaps it was because she had more years to cross than the boys and her aging was faster so she&#39;ll reach 18 at the same time that they did. Her progress through childhood was easier to notice. Not only was she growing bigger, but her limbs were growing longer and lithely. But the real indication that she was growing was how far apart the two pieces of her swimsuit were growing from each other. As Lacy reached 13, she let out a small gasp, but didn&#39;t think anything of it. She paid no attention to the mounds that were starting to push out of her chest, nor how her top was reshaping to match those mounds.<br />
<br />
As Alan and Tony got further through puberty, their development increased, their shoulders widened, their jaws grew firmer, muscular detail becoming more obvious. But Alan was clearly becoming a man who was more brains than brawn. He wasn&#39;t scrawny, but he had a leaner physique. In contrast, Tony was trading in his boyhood fat for extra muscles. His pecs and abs became defined before growing, his arms and legs growing thicker with strength. Another noticeable difference is that while Alan had relatively little hair on his body, Tony was sporting plenty of hair on his chest, arms, legs, and even down his abs to under his trunks. He even had a trim mustache growing on his handsomer face.<br />
<br />
Puberty certainly wasn&#39;t overlooking Lacy, though Alicia fitted her better now. Her willow preteen body was quickly growing into a beautiful adult body. Her skinny legs got some serious curves as her rear inflated into a proper ass. Her widening hips contrasted nicely with her trim stomach, creating the waspish waist that were so appealing in Asian women. Her lower half of her swimsuit stretched out against her growing lower half as it became a proper bikini bottom. Similarly, her upper half was now a bikini top that was highlighting the curves and cleavage of her breasts quite nicely. Alicia was noticeably more endowed than some Asian women, being a small C-cup at most. Her face had becoming very beautiful as red gloss appeared on her full lips. Long black hair framed her face, falling down until it hung under her breasts.<br />
<br />
By this point, Tony and Alicia were paying less attention to the sand castle than they were to each other. Alicia&#39;s eyes constantly went up and down Tony&#39;s rippling muscles and Tony had a hard time keeping his gaze away from Alicia&#39;s cleavage. Eventually, Alicia turned to Alan. He was no longer her older brother by 3 years but by 3 minutes. &quot;Alan,&quot; she said in a velvety voice, &quot;Me and Tony are going to go for a walk along the beach.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan rolled his eyes before adjusting his glasses. &quot;You&#39;re about as subtle as a tidal wave,&quot; he said dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to loosen up,&quot; said Tony as he stood up, brushing sand off his trunks, &quot;You should spend more time on the beach looking for a girlfriend than building castles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s an art to this,&quot; said Alan defensively, &quot;Lacy, don&#39;t do anything that&#39;ll give Mom a fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not kids anymore,&quot; said Alicia, &quot;We&#39;re 18 and we can do what we want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And a romantic stroll along the beach sounds great,&quot; said Tony as he helped her up. Soon, the two of them were walking off and holding hands.<br />
<br />
Alan returned his focus to the sand castle, muttering about hormones. Though the beach did have a few cute girls. Maybe after he was finished, he could talk to some.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting reaction there,&quot; said Katie, having watched the whole thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but there&#39;s still more to test,&quot; said Bobby, &quot;And plenty of kids to test on.&quot;</p>
