<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vinnie had not said anything to Ryan and he'd felt no urge to say anything in return.  He did not actually go out of his way to avoid the dweeb, but who knew what else he could do if provoked?  Ryan certainly did not want to be around if he went all Carrie on the school and especially did not want to be cause of it.  <br />
<br />
Ryan had gotten back into his life without too much trouble.  Sure he'd missed school, but that had happened before.  Allowances were made for the team's all important quarterback and he actually did make up his homework and the extra work as well to please his parents.  Not that either of them were very involved in his life, but they did at least get after him when the school complained.  Too busy with their careers and affairs they'd just assumed that Ryan was out for the weekend as he usually was.  <br />
<br />
Ryan was excited by the idea of the upcoming weekend at the lake with Jason.  As he drove over to pick his new friend up he tried to convince himself yet again that it was just because Jason had turned out to be a stand up guy who was fun to be around and not because he wanted to be worn around his tattooed and pierced cock.  <br />
<br />
Pulling up in front of Jason's house was an education.  Ryan had never actually seen it before, he'd only seen images of it from Jason's mind.  The half dead lawn with its scraggly tufts and smothering drifts of leaves from a surprisingly healthy tree looked somewhat better in person than it did in Jason's mind.  The motorcycle that Ryan had ridden in looked a bit worse, though, with some obvious sun fading.  &quot;This could be the punk version of Malcolm in the Middle,&quot; he thought to himself just before Jason came out carrying a duffel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, all set?&quot;<br />
<br />
Snake replied, &quot;You know it, this is going to be one bad ass weekend. Head over to Riverside, we need some things before we head out.&quot;  For one thing, Snake thought to himself, you need to be broken in a bit.<br />
<br />
In front of a seedy storefront with the name, &quot;Evil Tattoo&quot; Ryan was told to pull over.  &quot;Right here we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your tattoo my friend, I'm getting you one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, Ryan.  You need to lighten up, have some fun.  You need a tattoo, and this guy is the best.  He did mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely no way, I don't want my dick tattooed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have to do that.  In fact we'll just do one where a jockstrap's waistband will cover it on your back so you don't have to show it off if you don't want to.  Trust me on this one, getting tattooed is a great experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
A bit more pressure and persuasion and eventually Ryan went inside.  A little while later he came out with a bandage covering up a tattoo of a snake across his lower back.  What he did not know was that Snake had worked this out ahead of time with his tattoo artist and in the scales it also clearly read, &quot;Property of Snake&quot;.  <br />
<br />
After picking up some beer from 'a friend' and food Snake drove the car to the lake giving Ryan the opportunity to avoid leaning back on his sore spot.  The quarterback felt kind of weird in the back seat.  Sort of like being just a little bit high or drunk.<br />
<br />
*** ***<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I am tired or something,&quot; he said to Snake.. Jason.  He'd always called him Jason before, why was he Snake now?<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to relax while I get in a workout?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah.  That sounds good.&quot;  Ryan supposed he could have taken that innocently, but it felt good to strip down in front of Snake while his friend took off his own jeans.  Snake even helped to carefully remove the bandage from the still tender tattoo.  <br />
<br />
Without a word Ryan took Snake's snake in his mouth and soon felt the transformation beginning.  As always being around the hard member felt like his ass, his mouth, his whole body was being violated, but it also felt good.  PROPERTY OF SNAKE  Where the hell had that thought come from?  He was Ryan PROPERTY OF SNAKE!  Unknown to him the snake with the artfully drawn words had also appeared above his jockstrap pouch and even now it was changing his mind as Snake started to work out in nothing but Ryan.<br />
<br />
Ryan's mind echoed his new mantra written over and over even as his knowledge guided Snake through his workout.  He figured that Snake had done something to him, but he did not care, in fact he was glad that he belonged to Snake now!  He knew even when Snake let him be human again something had made him permanently Snake's property.  He felt such love, admiration, and desire for his owner, his master, his Snake he couldn't explain it.  <br />
<br />
Snake smiled in a cruel way, this was working out better than he could have hoped.  Ryan would probably readily agree to his Spring Break plan now.  More than that, he'd help his owner get it done.<br />
<br />
Ryan was property of Snake, and that felt good.</p>
