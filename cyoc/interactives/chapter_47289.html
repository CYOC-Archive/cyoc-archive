<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa awoke in the morning, furious as she recalled her conversation with Kelly earlier.  “I actually got a quart of it and put it in the fridge. My little sister, Lindsey, likes the taste I think,” echoed her voice in Lisa's head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does she have to abandon all common sense?&quot; Lisa asked no one in particular.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Jen asked, groggily rubbing her eyes and rubbing her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kelly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that.  My assumption would be that she's just plain stupid, and that her parents have pretty much let her run wild her whole life.  She's got no guidance or discipline, and if she doesn't heed your advice, her sister might be the one to suffer for her stupidity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa stretched and rolled her pajama sleeves up to check the growth on her arms.  Her hands were definately getting darker, and the hair on her arms was now unable to be hidden.  Her back was tingling and itching now, as was her rear end, but she didn't feel it would be appropriate to scratch there, even if Jennifer did.<br />
<br />
The pair made their way into the bathroom to find Andy in front of the mirror, putting on a heavy sweatshirt to combat the chilled weather outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll wait until you're finished,&quot; Lisa said, turning to exit.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, don't worry about it,&quot; Andy replied with a cheerful tone in her voice.  &quot;We've shared a bathroom forever, and given that Jennifer doesn't mind undressing in your presence, she should mind mine, either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer sighed inwardly.  There was a huge difference between your best friend seeing you in the nude and your best friend's sister seeing you in the nude.  Especially when said sister had quite a presence.  Her tall body was rather toned - Jennifer suspected she may have participated in sports at one time or another - and she imagined that Lisa would have shown the same hair patterns as Andy, had she ever permitted herself to grow it out.  The tall girl's hair ran down in a ponytail in between her shoulder blades, allowing her facial features to be shown proudly.  Lisa wore the exact same hairstyle, following in her sister's footsteps.  Even now, with her face getting gradually hairier, she wouldn't relinquish that ponytail.<br />
<br />
Andy watched with sadness, and, admittedly, mild curiosity as the girls undressed.  She wanted to know exactly what her sister was going through, and she figured that their mother still had no idea what the girls looked like underneath their cover-all clothing.<br />
<br />
Jennifer definately had fuzz, but the light coloring made it difficult to see at times.  It was definately prominent on her arms and legs, and a trail could be seen going up to her belly button from her pubic hair, which was quite thick for a blonde.  The girl was changing quite quickly, probably a bit embarrassed to be seen, Andy guessed.<br />
<br />
As for her sister, it was difficult not to see it.  Her heart broke for her as she saw what was happening to her.  Lisa's face was definately fuzzy in the beard area, and as she peered into the mirror, Andy spied Lisa checking out other areas of her face as well.  Her forehead, for one, and she even had begun rubbing her nose a second.  Maybe she was just itchy, though.<br />
<br />
Some darker fuzz was appearing on her back as well and spreading all the way down to her ankles.  This wasn't too terribly apparent, Andy noticed, but the bright track lighting in the bathroom seemed to highlight every hair on each girl's body.<br />
<br />
Their stomachs were beginning to show some definate mature, terminal hairs on them, as well as their breasts.  Andy had been told that these two were both being the most profoundly affected, at least in terms of body hair.<br />
<br />
When Andy left the bathroom, Jen and Lisa shared a look.  Lisa was glad that Andy knew what she was going through, but it would be a few days before she would be comfortable sharing the changes with her sister.  Jennifer had been very eager to cover her fuzzy body and had overlooked her morning inspection to do so.<br />
<br />
Naturally, the first thing in order was to disrobe...again...and check each other over.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Andy strolled into the kitchen, her nostrils taking in the smell of bacon and eggs.  Sure enough, Carol was busy making breakfast for the girls before heading to school.  This was normally only something that she did on weekends, but Andy figured that she was going the extra mile to show her love and affection for the girls, and also because she always went out of her way to bring the family together whenever she was home from college.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are the girls up yet?&quot; she asked as Andy poured herself a glass of orange juice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, they're getting dressed.&quot;  Andy gulped down the juice, staring into the glass as though she were some depressed old man at a bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, sweetie?&quot; Carol asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Andy replied in a voice that was less than cheerful.  &quot;It was just a bit difficult seeing Lisa like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carol put her arm around her daughter for a brief squeeze.  &quot;I haven't seen her, so I don't know, but I can tell you one thing: it's difficult for her to see herself as well.  That's why we need to be strong for both their sakes.  I mean, Jennifer was just practically abandoned by her own mother!&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy nodded her head.  Carol had explained to her why Jennifer was with them, and that she expected Andy to treat her as though they were also sisters.  She just couldn't fathom Audrey's reaction and what she would have done if Carol ever did anything like that to her.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jen and Lisa bolted down the stairs, racing each other to the kitchen.  &quot;I think you cheated,&quot; Lisa said, smiling mischieviously at Jen as she touched the living room floor.<br />
<br />
Jen just smiled back, not caring to admit or deny any foul play.  They soon smelled Carol's cooking and found Andy gulping down the remainder of a glass of orange juice.  She smiled meekly at the girls as they began setting the table for breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the occasion?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A.) Your sister is home,&quot; Carol explained, &quot;and B.) you girls are both very brave.&quot;<br />
<br />
She began shoveling eggs onto their plates and questioning them in the normal mother's way.  Namely, who is coming over tonight, how long are they going to stay, etc.  Jen always thought Carol was a bit overprotective, but at least it was better than, say, Kelly's mom.<br />
<br />
They hurried through breakfast (eating a full meal before the bus comes is a bit of work), listening to Andy tell stories about college and rant about the classes she hated taking.  She was a very vivacious story teller, and could turn even the most trivial episodes of the week into an epic adventure.  Probably why she was going into film, Jen thought.<br />
<br />
Finally, the girls raced to the bus stop, eager to get the school day over with and start the weekend.</p>
