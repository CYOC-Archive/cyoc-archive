<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The longing I'd had to be wild and free as a stallion was going all wrong. I had purchased an ointment which left me a slave to this animal instincts and a prisoner in my changed body.<br />
<br />
The animal began to gallop toward the rich scents wafting the breeze. I watched and felt the sight and lust as my pony self drew up to a fence. There stood no less than a dozen mares and all of perfect size that one could mount with ease.<br />
<br />
Prancing, whinning, and snorting my stallion body was showing off his maleness for those lusty females just out of reach. It was I'm sure the noise that drew the attention of one Humbie Yoder. A thin form of a man sauntered over to the fence. He watched me prance about and even though the stallion part of me ignored him I watched. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey'a big boy where'a deeed yero'a come from?&quot; he hooted at me.<br />
<br />
The stallion broke not a positive thought as we, me and my pony body pranced about yet tail high, cock wagging, and a mind fighting for control. <br />
<br />
As yet I was not bridled but with each passing moment the thought of capture was looking rather good. It was when one you maiden pressed her rump to the fence for one sweet snort of her musky scent that the halter arrived. A quick move by Humbie and I was captive of his control. The sudden feeling of being regulated and held in check from some reason quieted the stallion part of me. We calmed and felt the rigid cock soften and slither back up into it's dark home.<br />
<br />
As a rein clipped to the halter ring I watched us being walked to the stable. Mr. Yoder seemed kind as his soft smooth voice calmed both animal and man. Entering the stable brought a sudden fear to the stallion as we began to kick and buck about the stable doorway.<br />
<br />
Much noise brought the visit and interest by others both tall and short. After much to do I was roped into a stall. A broad strap was stretched across behind me so as to keep me from being able to offer any swift kicks. <br />
<br />
Mr. Yoder picked up one hoof after another and all he said was, &quot;Hmmmmm!&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked around as woder turned to terror when the man returned with several presized pony shoes. The steel shoes nailed to my hoofs might do the trick to seal my fate, my life, and my stallion self forever. Nothing the shop owner said about this type of attachments but I was sure it would heed to remain a stallion for longer than a weekend.<br />
<br />
As a young and rather plain looking girl came close I turned my head to see her. A pat on my withers and one hand smoothing down my back presented her with a hairy tail. I craned my head around to see what on earth she was planning for that big rump.<br />
<br />
The girl smiled and with soft voice spun a song. The words meant little to stallion but they filtered down to calm my tensions. Her nimble fingers weaved those coarse hairs into braids and as I almost fell asleep she gave a tug to tighten and bind. Now that silky flowing tail hung braided tight into a long rope. One flick and then another the thing hit me like one crack of a wip.<br />
<br />
My first day as a stallion and it found me captive in a stable as people prepared me for something I did not plan to enjoy. A bucket of water offered the first good drink of the day. Soon the girl returned with two smaller children to give me grain and a hay net to munch.<br />
<br />
Brushes and curry combs paced about my back, flanks, and neck. The feeling was so soothing that again I almost fell asleep standing up. A feeling brought me to attention as the sheath below was being pursed by small fingers. A hard turn to the left spied on small boy fondling my maleness with rather odd intents.<br />
<br />
He blew on the sheath which about made me jump into the air. A finger and then two smoothed about up inside the sheath giving me the sensual feelings I might have done myself, if I could. This made the stallion tense as one twentytwo inch hose dropped out into view. All the horses I'd seen had cocks about that long and I was no acception.<br />
<br />
Seeing him cup his hands he filled them with a thin oil. The rubbing made me stiffen till the little fingers seemed to enjoy the touching. Again the massive organ pressed up against my belly. The touch of horse haired hide made one hell of a sensual feeling. I closed my eyes as he oiled me more and the cock throbed. I snuffened out and moaned as the delight filled me with satisfied joy. The mounting of mares was going to be fun but this was another feeling which made it all worth...... WHAT?<br />
<br />
The scramble of the boy away from my cock made me look to one side. There stood a large dark man. Black coveralls and burly arms, thick beard of several years growth. Two yellow pencils stuck out one pocket and he carried a wooden handled tray.<br />
<br />
Mr. Yoder took my halter in his hands pulling my head into a stock. As steel bars ran behind forelegs I was trapped tight. The big man lifted my hind leg and holding it tight in his groin he filled my hoofs smooth. It was at that single moment when my entire life passed in front of my eyes. <br />
<br />
Tink, tonk, tonk, tonk, and so on went his hammer and black nails. I was being shoed as a pony stallion with iron shoes and forged black square nails. It did not hurt but the thought of my containment made the fact I was to be a pony for a long time something one could not just say, &quot;So what!&quot;<br />
<br />
The group on people broke to have their picnic table lunch as I stood lifting one hoof then another. The odd weight on my feet made me uncomfortable even though I knew it protected me from injury. The smells of buttered corn, ham, spuds, made me lick my lips. Smells which I'd loved as a man seemed nice yet also left no real care to enjoy them in mingled thoughts.<br />
<br />
Afternoon first day found me standing in the stall looking about with nothing to do but listen to one's gut churn. The buzzing of flies and an occasional noise from the families' dog or cat walking about the stable. The daytime heat had me warming in my hairy body as little breeze floated through the barns. Breathin, licking, wiggle an ear, flick the wip of a tail all these thing were moments of animal joy. <br />
<br />
Moment, minutes, hours, the clock of time clicks slowly as one stands listening to age creep over your body. I stood a human mind held captive and bored to going crazy. &quot;What the man said about people who spend ten days or more as an animal lose their past and forget to even want to change back. I was on my way to such a fate as that, sensual though it may be, a stallion shod and owned.</p>
