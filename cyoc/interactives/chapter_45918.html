<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Tome paused his in-game action for only a moment.  Undressing a woman was something he'd rarely had the opportunity to do, even in PHUK.  Unlike Daniel, he didn't care much for playing the field, and even less for sport-fuck.  As a result, he'd had only two girlfriends… only one of which he'd made any distance in the relationship department before she broke it off for another guy.</p>

<p>Undressing virtual females had its potential, and he'd found NPC's he could compete a social challenge to do so before… but this time he <i>was</i> the virtual female.  Her fur was a feeling over his own skin, and the readiness of her moist sex was a feeling from his own crotch.  The smells and sights of this whole scene were just about as real as the ycould be with modern technology and <i>that</i> was what made it all the stranger.</p>

<p>But Tom took a moment to watched Misty disrobe as Worg helped her remove the remaining portions of her attire.  Her black fur blew in the wind of Worg's mystically charged form.  She lifted her head back as she felt her energy cover her nude form.</p>

<p>Her muscles rippled as she stretched her form up to it's full height, grabbing Worg and tossing him back onto the pile of pillows that was to be their bed.  She growled a challenge to him to tame her, and she stalked forward, her arms out and a twisted grin over her face.  Her tail swished back and forth as she appeared both alluring and intimidating.</p>

<p>Worg looked up at her and reached out with his own muscled arms, grabbing her and pulling her towards him.  His mouth opened and he licked along her muzzle, down her neck, and over to the nipple of her right breast.  She moaned softly as he nipped over her tender flesh, his hands going along behind her back and just up under her tail.</p>

<p>As appealing as it could look to an outsider, Tom's brain insisted what he was seeing was his brother Dan playing up his role.  He muttered something in teamspeak, but Daniel had turned off the channel for the moment.  <i>Not to be distracted</i>, Tom thought.  He turned Tracy's eyes back to look at Gen and determined he must be an NPC as no human player would have waited this long… <i>Unless he was as unsure as I am,</i> Tom added.</p>

<p>The situation wrapped over him, and a feeling of determination colored the scene.  Daniel was always pushing things to the extreme… trying things Tom wouldn't.  They were twins, but Daniel was always the more outgoing.  Perhaps it was Tome always feeling the sore pangs of failure, but nurture more than natural had tinted their identical building blocks of life long ago.</p>

<p><i>Not this time,</i> Tome thought to himself.  <i>Dan wont show me up.  No matter how strange this is, it will stay between us, and </i>I<i> will know that Tracy was the memorable,</i> he swore.</p>

<p>Tracy reached out tenderly to Gen, and the look on Gen's eyes was one of appreciation and admiration.  He had been noticed and taken the eyes of, and this woman wanted him and all that he appeared.  As Tracy reached towards him, she could feel the mystical energies his body was giving off, and she let her mind think on that a moment.</p>

<p>The implications of this ritual were that the mystical energies of there forms interlocking would create a powerful energy joining.  The end would make the men stronger at their classes just as it would do for Tracy and Misty… and it would insure, also, that their children would be all the more stronger for it.</p>

<p><i>Children</i>, Tome thought to himself.  <i>The game allows for it… but I wonder what these two character's owners will think to find their characters with children… </i>if<i> that happens.</i></p>

<p>Tome found Tracy's hands down Gen's loincloth having been distracted enough to discover that Gen had almost entirely disrobed her without her attention being in the moment.  A quick moment later, and Tracy was holding the cloth in her hand, her eyes looking up into Gen's.</p>

<p>"Take me," Tracy said in a guttural growl to Gen as Tome was unsure how to continue as a woman.  "I am yours," she added, Tom unsure if that meant anything to him.  It must have, because in the next moment, she was on her back against her own set of pillows just across from Worg and Misty.  His hands parted her legs, and he put his head down between them, he tongue going to work to bring her to readiness.</p>

<p>Tome faded away in that moment.  Tracy reached her head back against the pillows, her tail off to one side, as Gen pulled up her legs beside his head as his tongue explored her depths.  She moaned allowed, not expecting this to come.  He flicked within her, and ran his hands along her furred and muscled legs…</p>

<p>She began holding on to the pillows, trying to move with her back and arms against him as he continued.  She began moving against his muzzle in the rhythm, the feeling of his sharp teeth rubbing against her tender flesh as he licked deeper and quicker within her.</p>

<p>All was becoming a white light and just before she might loose herself, Gen removed his head from her crotch and pressed up against her.  She pulled him up to his face, with one hand, her other hand down to his pink cock as it had already removed from his sheath.  She had a moment to wonder for which direction they would continue when Gen pushed himself just a little ways into her.</p>

<p>Worg and Misty could be heard just behind Tracy, already humping their way to an end… but Gen was slower and kinder, and it was Tracy who began pushing herself down upon him, holding onto his gray back fur as she pulled herself down his body and more onto his unsheathed penis.</p>

<p>She licked along his face, and Gen replied.  He leaned down over her as she had her back against the pillows and nibbled at her ear.  He slowly pulled out of her a ways, then pushed himself back in.  Again he went out, and then back in… over and over, slowly speeding up with each thrust.</p>

<p>Tracy wrapped her powerful legs up around Gen's back, crossing them behind him.  She used her strength to keep him coming back harder and harder each time, her moans of pleasure reaching up and echoing about the hut.  He reached behind her and picked her up closer to him, partly kneeling down upon the pillows.</p>

<p>Between Tracy's legs was a new feeling, that of Gen's knot between them at the base of his shaft.  A goal was reached for her, and she was determined to have it within her.  She ran her hands over his back and begged him, "We must… be one…" she panted between trusts.  She wanted him to pour his seed within her and unleash the torrent of his power.</p>

<p>He did.  It was unlike anything she'd ever experienced.  With one final thrust, his knot locked them together, it's size growing too large to exit her.  His arms jerked against her back, his head falling against her shoulder as he pulled her against him, his form crumpling in on hers.  He thrust again, again, and one last time before his patience was lost.</p>

<p>Tom experienced the first wave of his very first female orgasm as Gen unloaded his seed within her wet and ready sex.  Tracy's head went back and released a long and loud howl of pleasure as she felt herself being filled and loosing herself in the process.  The energy from within Gen entered her body, and filled them both with a warm glow.</p>

<p>Gen's head reached back, a howl escaping his throat and joining her's as his body reflexively tried to keep thrusting.  Tracy's legs had gripped him so had he would bruise, but relaxed a moment later as she finished her howl and laid back flat, her crotch locked in with his by his knot.</p>

<p>Gen fell lightly onto her as he wrapped his arms behind her.  She ran her own hands down his spine and to his tail as he legs slowly uncoiled from his.  Her head was back and upside down, and when she could focus again, she could see Misty's pleased face just inches back from her own, Worg laying over the top of her from behind her.</p>

<p>As the two lay their panting, locked with their mates, a very soft and human male voice came from Daniel over teamspeak: "Was it good for you too?"</p></p>
