<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well, did you have fun with Spookyville?” Scott asked to Xena as they settled back into their home on Mieni Atoll, and one of the islets that could be set aside more for Mieni’s full time residents than it was for tourists.<br />
<br />
Normally they were to help with some of the deep sea research and how the new Animalians adapted to life away from the depths. The combination of DNA from animals that often went from deep water and returned to the surface, and that was something critical for Xena as a Dragonfish, and that was something that was then passed on to Scott. Spookyville, while it had been in part a way to provide some spooks for people as part of Halloween, it was also a way to share some of what Xena had already learned and found a willing partner in Scott.<br />
<br />
“It was fun,” Xena answered, “a bit odd that Humans and even some Animalians would want to be scared by things they don’t know or understand… but, if it helps people learn, I’m more than willing to put up with the odd things at times.”<br />
<br />
“It isn’t so much about learning things,” Scott answered, “as about the whole part of Halloween in America today is cheap thrills and scares, which has often contributed to the rise of horror movies and the fans that follow those movies as a genre.”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Xena nodded, “and I seemed to recall someone being big on those sorts of things… even willing to search me out for a date on that purpose. Something, I found to be even more… odd.”<br />
<br />
Scott only smiled at the memory of his first meeting with Xena. It hadn’t been cheap or easy, but when he’d heard about Xena’s presence, that had kindled some interest that related to his own interest in certain horror movies. Obviously, Xena wasn’t a horror movie monster and some things had merely brought about other urges, and that was something that made him willing to seek her out. As they unpacked as part of their return “home,” Scott thought back on the memory and how they first met.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Mieni was a warm place at nearly all times and served as the main headquarters for much of Horizon’s research regarding things at sea, mostly coming from the fact that it was where a lot of the first aquatic animals were uplifted as part of the establishment of Animalia’s first colonies. It brought some Animalians representing species that didn’t normally live around that part of the Pacific. Scott found this all interesting as it made for some pleasant socialization as part of his vacation through the summer. Some could talk for a while, but many couldn’t as they often had plenty of work to do during the day.<br />
<br />
Those who didn’t have a lot of time often left Scott feeling a bit down as much of his whole trip to Mieni was to meet and make some friends among the residents. He’d always liked the stories about Animalia and found a lot of the reporting to represent something rather friendly and actually avoiding a lot of the problems that seemed to dominate much of the rest of his life. Some of it came from the fact that while he wasn’t a “dwarf,” neither was he really tall or muscular. It was something that often had him teased by those he worked with, and they weren’t always just in jest. The kind and friendly stories about Animalians was something that made him hope for some friends, and that many of those that lived on Mieni didn’t have time for some idle chat sort of depressed him.<br />
<br />
That lasted into one evening as he came into the main restaurant that was connected to the hotel on the main island in the atoll. Seating was often open, and Scott liked that, though he then noticed a dark figure sitting at the main bar. He could tell she was a she, based on the generous curves that all Animalian females had, but her largely black scales, no Human hair, and a long muscular fish tail sticking through a fold in a green dress gave him some indication that she was someone new that he hadn’t met yet. Swallowing, he approached and hoped to make a good first impression to make a friend.<br />
<br />
“Hello, may I join you?” Scott asked as he approached.<br />
<br />
The Animalian turned, and he noted some long barbells under her jaw that stretched down past her neck and another set that grew down from the base of her jaw that were also fairly long. Add in the red eyes with a barely visible black pupil and Scott found himself looking into something he would have figured would be on a fan art page for a “sexy xenomorph,” even though the alien species in those movies didn’t technically have eyes. But it also jogged some of his own interests in sci-fi horror as a genre, which added another reason for him to try and control himself.<br />
<br />
“You’d wish to join me?” the Dragonfish Animalian asked in what was a fairly deep voice for a female, though Scott also quietly noted it complemented her Amazonian body.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… my name is Scott,” Scott introduced himself and offered his hand, “I’ve come out on vacation and hoped to make some friends with the local residents. I’ve never thought of converting before, but there has been so much reported on Animalians being nice and accepting… I was hoping to make some friends.”<br />
<br />
“And you picked me?” the Dragonfish Animalian replied.<br />
<br />
“Most everyone else was busy with some other kind of work and didn’t have the time,” Scott admitted, “and I can respect that. Everyone has to work… but it’s meant I haven’t had that much time to talk. Seeing you here… it made me hopeful for someone to talk to. Make friends and so on… I’m sorry if I was a bit forceful.”<br />
<br />
The Dragonfish Animalian gave a small smile, which revealed the outline of all the sharp teeth in her mouth, and then lifted Scott’s chin up as he looked down with one hand.<br />
<br />
“You haven’t been too forceful,” the Dragonfish Animalian answered, “It’s just that many Humans, and particularly those on vacation don’t want to hang around with a Dragonfish Animalian, even the males. And the Human scientists that I help with their research in deep sea life are already married. So… I haven’t had the opportunity to talk to many myself.”<br />
<br />
“People wouldn’t want to talk to you?” Scott gasped, “I could think of an entire movie franchise of fans that might be interested. Shoot, to a degree… I’m a bit interested.”<br />
<br />
“I can smell that,” the Dragonfish Animalian gave a more confident smile as Scott moved to try and hide the growing bulge in his pants, “but you are welcome to join me. I’m Xena, by the way.”<br />
<br />
“Like the warrior princess?” Scott asked.<br />
<br />
“Who?” Xena asked.<br />
<br />
“It was a TV show, where a woman in a semi-skimpy version of Ancient Greek leather armor battled warriors, monsters, gods, and other things,” Scott answered.<br />
<br />
“I never saw it,” Xena answered, “most of what I do is helping Horizon with their research into deep sea life. In some ways it’s quite fascinating and can provide for some travel.”<br />
<br />
That only intrigued Scott more…<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Of course that first meeting was something that lead into a lot more, as Scott and Xena seemed to hit it off even more. Xena shared some things about her uplifting and some degree of loneliness as the only Dragonfish Animalian and really only having a small number of other Animalians that were from the deeper parts of the ocean, while Scott shared some of his interests in science fiction and science fiction horror themes. It was something that ultimately lead to Scott betraying more signs and interests in Xena that would go beyond just a friendly meeting. Though, over time through that vacation, Scott found the affections returned by Xena and that soon lead to the two of them becoming mates and Scott getting to become a Dragonfish Animalian to join her, particularly when Scott let it slip that he was kind of into women that were stronger than him. And before Scott’s vacation ended… things progressed to where he and Xena could then take that radical step, and while it was fast, so far as Scott could remember on all of that, it felt so very right…<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
“We’d really have to do this here?” Scott asked as he followed Xena through the halls that lead to a conversion room at the hospital and research center at Mieni’s main island as part of the atoll.<br />
<br />
“Many of the rules are pretty set,” Xena answered, “because they don’t want Animalians to become a proverbial “zombie plague” where we risk just transforming anyone and everyone when there cases of for either casual sex or if someone fails to guard milk from an unvaccinated female. From some stories I’ve heard… that’s actually how several of the first Humans became Animalians. So, I’d need to get unvaccinated to transform you and then we’d both be vaccinated to avoid accidentally transform others.”<br />
<br />
“But I’d only want to be with you, my Amazonian champion,” Scott answered, “Couldn’t we just do the transformation at your home or my hotel room?”<br />
<br />
“Technically, I am working now,” Xena smiled, “and Horizon would then be offering you a lot of the same work I do. Which you said you’d be willing to do rather than just being an Uber driver. So it’s not like we could get around that… and besides, by later, when the Horizon staff goes home, it’d then mean I’d have to be extra careful for far longer… and a part of me would like to be a little more… active this evening once you’re a male Dragonfish Animalian.”<br />
<br />
Scott rapidly found his penis growing erect just at the mention of more sex later in the evening. For the moment, that was enough to let him accept things as they were for the moment as approached the changing room where some of Horizon’s staff were already waiting outside the door. He got a welcome to Animalia as Xena opened it and lead him into the room. Scott continued to follow, and while the room wasn’t tiny and super cramped, it wasn’t huge either. There was enough room for a modest twin bed along the far wall and there was a little bit of space between the end of the bed and the next wall. Scott had only taken a few steps in when he heard the door close behind him and then felt something land on the back of his head.<br />
<br />
He reached up slowly and found that it was Xena’s shirt. That made him turn around to see her generous breasts hovering there in front of him. Her black scaled nipples already looked erect and ready for attention, and confirming that Xena hadn’t worn a bra for the day. Though, from what he’d found, was that despite the rather large cup sizes that just about any Animalian female could fit into, they seemed to be rather firm and wearing a bra was more about making sure they didn’t bounce out of control or accidentally flash someone while moving about.<br />
<br />
“I think you’re about as eager as I am,” Scott said slowly as he dropped Xena’s shirt to the floor while Xena was moving to undo her skirt.<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Xena answered, “it’s not every day one finds some that just feels right for them… and while it may be a bit before something like Human “marriage” is brought up… everything does feel right. And while I may not be a xenomorph… the fact that you’ve found me attractive… it makes me eager for things as well. And I can tell that you’re eager…”<br />
<br />
“I know,” Scott admitted as he undid the button on his pants and pulled them down, with one thumb sliding in underneath his underwear to pull them down as well.<br />
<br />
Xena watched as Scott undressed himself and revealed the presently Human shaft that he had. It wasn’t big by Human standards, or at least from how some men seemed to talk about how big they were online, but it wasn’t bad in proportion to the rest of him in the physical sense. At the same time, Xena also got the sense that when Scott’s penis became more like a shark’s claspers as part of Scott’s transition from a Human into a Fish Animalian, specifically a Dragonfish Animalian that would change. The clasper element was part of all that, since with the exception of sharks, fertilization eggs in fish was often external rather than internal. Xena was very eager for all of those changes and she finished her own undressing and advanced toward him.<br />
<br />
Scott smiled Xena came closer and accepted her approach. As they met, Scott ran his hands over Xena’s hands and arms as she came closer. He could feel the raised areas that ran in lines on her arms and hands, which essentially mirrored where the rays were when those limbs were her fins as a mundane Dragonfish. He could also feel the steely muscle that powered those arms, and that only served to arouse him more and it let him move his hands further up and shift over to Xena’s breasts and heft them up slightly. Scott could feel the balance between the scales on Xena’s body, but it almost felt like skin and was rewarded by a soft moan from Xena as well.<br />
<br />
“You’re so beautiful,” Scott said to Xena as he was backed up onto the bed and running his hands down Xena’s abs as she advanced.<br />
<br />
Xena backed him down and then climbed up onto the bed and perched herself above him so that she was crouching above Scott’s penis as it stood at full attention. She gave a very knowing smile as she began to lower herself onto him. She guessed that Scott was trying to engage in some measure of foreplay or was just so amazed by her muscle mass that he had to touch it, but she had been anticipating this just as much as he was and was more than ready for the real fun to begin.<br />
<br />
“And you’re quite handsome,” Xena spoke as she smiled, “and I am more than ready to make you even more handsome… my bond-mate.”<br />
<br />
Scott couldn’t help but give a heavy moan as Xena lowered herself onto him. Like every other part of her, her vaginal lips were strong and gripped his penis firmly and while she was more than ready, the grip was something that sent a fair amount of pleasure through him, even while it was often difficult for him to build a counter thrust to Xena’s. She had lowered herself down onto him and rustled her hips forward and back, and this served to at times pull Scott forward and back with her as she did so. Her grip was that strong, but it did feel good, and she couldn’t help but smile as she saw Scott’s own teeth begin to change and sharpen as he breathed in through his mouth.<br />
<br />
It felt odd as the transformation seemed to set in, as Scott felt his whole body grow warm. At first he thought it was just the growing pleasure from having his penis gripped by her vaginal lips, which looked and functioned more like a vent rather than what would be seen with a Human female. But when he lifted up one hand to see webbing starting to form between his fingers and the ray like ridges began to form on them.<br />
<br />
“Wooooooooooooooow…” Scott managed to moan out as he finally found the strength to actually move and counter thrust so that he was able to match Xena as they mated and that made the sex start to feel even better. Though the moaning “wow” was more at the amazement at seeing his hands and arms start to take on the fin like properties that Xena’s arms had. Scott couldn’t see it, but his legs were undergoing a similar transformation.<br />
<br />
“In…deeeed,” Xena moaned back as she felt her breasts bounce with each thrust she made and now with Scott thrusting back against her made it better. But like Scott, she was able to see the changes in Scott as well.<br />
<br />
His face had begun to push forward and to suit his growing teeth. They weren’t as big as hers and he showed no signs of growing the barbels that she had, but it was enough to have his nose melt in to growing fish-like muzzle. His body hair was largely falling out, but the hair on his head remained, and strangely, Xena found herself most attracted to that. In some ways, it fit with many Animalians who had been uplifted from non-mammals that marveled at Human hair as Animalians. It left an absent thought running through her mind on when they got to having children that theirs would have Scott’s hair.<br />
<br />
There were some other things that Scott also noted. He could feel the structure of his penis changing, and unseen to him, this was his penis taking on a shape more like claspers than the normal Human organ they’d been. The thing that he could see was that his scales were more brown than black, though he figured that this was part of something that would be differing between male and female Dragonfish. Xena also noticed another thing, and she felt it as Scott’s thrusts into her grew stronger and pushed his now larger claspers deeper into her. It was also something that added to their mutual pleasure that was building to a growing orgasm in both of them.<br />
<br />
As Xena looked down, she managed to note that Scott’s arms and frame had grown a bit larger and stronger. It didn’t match hers, and she was still easily bigger and more muscular than him, but he did have some more definition as his transformation began to finish. It also helped him lift her up enough to give his tail room to grow out beneath him as he lay on his back on the bed. And as Xena felt herself cum she decided she really liked it as she gave out a pleasure filled cry that was soon matched by Scott’s own as his claspers erupted inside her.<br />
<br />
“That was really good,” Xena gave Scott a smile.<br />
<br />
“I hope it gets better,” Scott smiled back with open eyes and showing Xena that his eyes did not change color.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
“You found me odd?” Scott asked after a moment when the full weight of Xena’s comment sunk in.<br />
<br />
“Oh, just a bit,” Xena smiled, “but in the best way possible.”<br />
<br />
“And you should well know I wasn’t seeking you out for a date,” Scott gave a playful huff at that, “I was looking for a friend… and at the time that was all I thought I would find.”<br />
<br />
He then jumped up into Xena’s arms, “falling for you and becoming your mate… that was just the happiest surprise I’ve ever had.”<br />
<br />
“And that’s part of what makes the oddity of our first meeting so oddly nice,” Xena hugged him back, “and is better than spooking people on Halloween.”</p>
