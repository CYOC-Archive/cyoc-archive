<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary could hardly resist, and jabbed her long, sharp tongue right into the body of the mosquito, sucking its blood right up from the source. She hardly paid any attention to the changes her body underwent, becoming much more like the very beast she was consuming. Her lips closed around her tongue, almost involuntarily, as she sucked and slurped. She sucked with her lips until her lips stopped moving as they fused around her tongue. Internally, her mouth changed around her tongue as it became her new proboscis, which hardened, yet stayed flexible. <br />
<br />
Her eyes grew larger and larger a her head became much more rounded. She was starting to look less human now, and more like a cross between a mosquito and a woman. Every gulp of blood she swallowed down, she could feel it pulse through her body, especially in her abdomen. A surge of euphoria washed throughout her body as she drew in a deep breath from her growing abdomen, no longer having nostrils or a mouth to breathe through. <br />
<br />
Speaking of, a pair of feathery antennae sprouted forth where her nose was as her head shrunk a bit more. Her eyes grew larger, allowing her a much clearer view around her-  not just in front of her. She couldn’t blink anymore, and couldn’t move her vision. <br />
<br />
As she grew more and more, her limbs thinned out more, simplifying until she had three claws for fingers, and two claws for her feet. A pleasurable pressure made Mary let out a soundless moan in her head- her vocal chords were long gone now- as an identical pair of arms pushed out underneath her original pair. Long, spindly, covered in black blates of chitin, yet ever so strong. <br />
<br />
By now, Mary had grown to 10 feet tall, and was hunched down to continue slurping up the bloody contents of the mosquito that had vexed her before. Nothing but drinking blood was on her mind, making her numb to the continued changes. <br />
<br />
Her abdomen was now twice the size of her torso, and was pulsating with each breath. The underside of it was a sickly yellow, showing all of the bug blood she had consumed. Soon enough, she was forced into a lowered stance, on her hands and… feet? Her feet were now curved towards her back like an actual mosquito, a pair of wicked-looking claws adorning each foot. Luckily, her arms were long enough that she didn’t have to hunch over too much. <br />
<br />
This stance of being on her hands and feet was feeling much more natural to her, especially as she felt more pressure on her chest, and light pressure on her back. <br />
<br />
Her field of view afforded her a good view of her chest, which showed her breasts now growing. They were transparent, like her abdomen, and were now biologically repurposed to store more blood. Yet more orgasmic pleasure surged through her body- now 12ft tall hunched over- as two more pairs of breasts began to grow out underneath the first pair. <br />
<br />
Her nipples were gone though. She had no use for them, as her breasts were for storing blood now. Soon enough, Mary couldn’t drink anymore. Her breasts were now engorged, each pendulous breast being a healthy G cup- which at her size was massive. Her proboscis soon retracted to her face, which was a cross between a mosquito and a woman. <br />
<br />
Looking her final changes over, Mary could see that she had no more traces of her pink human skin. Anything that wasn’t covered by a dark, black plate of chitin was a lighter shade of black. Crawling to through her cramped hallways, she was wondering what she was doing there. She needed space to let her wings out so she could fly away and find more prey. <br />
<br />
So much of her humanity was gone. Mary had forgotten what she was doing here before she was slurping up the guts of that smaller mosquito. All that mattered to her was her bloodlust. Blood… Lust… Blood… Blood! <br />
<br />
She could smell more in that smaller mosquito… More blood… Her antennae were picking it up in the air. The mosquito woman was drawn over to it, driven by her need to feed, and jabbed her proboscis back into it. She was still hungry. She needed more blood. Those few seconds after feeling full were so distant to her. <br />
<br />
More… More… More! <br />
<br />
Mary slurped and slurped, feeling herself grow bigger and bigger. The walls of this cramped house she was in- how did she get in here again?- were starting to give way around her massive size. She continued to slurp and slurp, growing bigger and bigger.<br />
<br />
15… 17… 20… 25… CRASH! 32 feet tall… <br />
<br />
She was hunched down, watching the tiny mosquito become little more than an ant in comparison to her. Soon enough, she had slurped it dry. The mosquito woman beat her wings as her proboscis retracted to a small pin-point on her face. Mary soon took off, searching for more blood to drink…</p>
