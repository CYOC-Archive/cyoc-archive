<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kyle stirred, groaning from his uncomfortable sleep on the couch, he felt like something was off. First of all, his voice sounded...higher. And different somehow. Eh, he must be catching something. Must have disoriented him too, because he couldn't feel either end of the small couch, something he always could easily do if he stretched. He stood and went to the bathroom to douse his face. That'd straighten him out. Strangely, even his gait felt off-his body felt awkward and clumsy, and he stumbled many times before reaching the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Finally getting there, Kyle groaned again, and again heard a strange sound as he did. 'Must be the pipes. Mom never does fix them...'<br />
<br />
Shrugging, he reached down to splash water over his face. Man, even his face felt strange to the touch...<br />
<br />
As Kyle look up, he saw why...and screamed, unconsciously glad his family had gone away for the day like they'd said last night.<br />
<br />
Kyle's face looked unrecognizable. His normal, average nose had swelled to twice its normal size, looking large and bulbous. His ears had grown to what seemed to be extra large, and wiggled as he stared, giving the impression of mouse ears. He gaped in horror at his face, now looking chubby and puffy with much more baby fat than usual. His cheeks and the bridge of his nose were covered in freckles, and his whole face had an oily shine to it. Perched on his huge nose was a pair of thick, black, plastic glasses, taped around the middle. He tore them off, but ended up putting them back when he found that without them, everything near and far blurred. His eyes had now become a dull brown...dull and brown, like his hair now seemed to be, but his hair was now in a dorky part and also sported a very oily look, and when he rubbed it in desperation, flakes fell out.<br />
<br />
And speaking of his mouth... Kyle moaned as he looked at his new dental work. Instead of the nice white shine his teeth always had, they were now a dullish yellow, partially hidden by the new, heavy metal braces that filled his mouth. Of course, with the weaker lower jaw that seemed to give him a large overbite, and the new buckteeth that stuck out without fail, it was impossible to hide this. His lips looked puffy and ugly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thith ith tho bad...&quot; Kyle froze, listening to his voice, which only made things worse. His voice had risen in pitch, now sounding like a boy even younger than 14, and the very nasally quality now registered as the sound he'd been hearing. His tongue felt thicker, which would explain the new lisp he couldn't seem to stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;That curthe wath real...golly gee-&quot; He stopped, then tried to swear again. But to no avail, as if his more vulgar vocabulary had evaporated-and in its place was a plethora of dorky replacement words...unconsciously he wondered how he even knew plethora.<br />
<br />
In panic and fear at what else might have happened, Kyle struggled to tear off his clothes. This proved difficult, as his actions when he'd awoken became clear. He wasn't disoriented-he was clumsy, his grace and coordination robbed from him. He fumbled with his clothes, till finally he had removed him. What he saw caused him to moan nasally, aghast.<br />
<br />
His body, being 14, hadn't been exactly Mr. Muscle, but he had a nice tone he'd been proud of, and had worked for. Now however, all traces of it seemed gone. His body looked like a little boy’s. His limbs were skinny, as were his legs, scrawny and flimsy as his new torso. His whole body looked scrawny, a contrast to his chubby face. Kyle then noticed the sink, and the mirror itself, seemed higher and bigger, and then realized that he was shorter too, maybe down to 4’10” now! His skin also looked pale, the decent tan he'd acquired vanished. And his cock...he blanched at the small thing. It looked like it'd barely be 5&quot; when hard! Kyle trembled, staring at his new form.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-that...that b-b-b... meaney girl!&quot; He blushed, feeling silly for saying that, yet he couldn't help think that was what she was. Kyle then looked down at the clothes he had shucked, and his eyes almost popped out as he saw the clothes vanish slowly from view, fading away till it was as if they had never existed. He had to get clothes, and fast! Before someone saw the new him. The thought of it made Kyle lick his new braces nervously.<br />
<br />
Yet as he clumsily stumbled out of the bathroom and started to his room, Kyle slowed down, till he was moving at a meek shuffle. The reason? The thought of his new body nude in public seemed to make him feel more meek and timid. Every step made him feel more timid, more fearful, not just of those thoughts, but of everything. It was as if someone had taken the slides for his confidence, guts, boldness, ect…and turned them all down to near zero, if not all the way down.<br />
<br />
Kyle only became more worried when he noticed some family photos on the wall, all of which happened to be recent ones. They had all changed, and now featured him in his new body! He stared in horror at his mirror image staring at the camera with a nervous, timid, bucktoothed smile, pushing his large glasses up his huge nose. Kyle moved a bit faster now, stumbling more, but worried what he would find in his room.<br />
<br />
Opening the door, Kyle simply stared for a while…then let out a nasally moan once more at the new room that he apparently lived in. Old pre high school soccer trophies seemed to have been replaced by a combination of chess and science fair trophies. His soccer and babe posters gone, their space now occupied by a few anime and Einstein posters. His bed was now covered in Spiderman sheets. And the small bookshelf he’d once had…now in its place was a huge bookshelf, crammed with advanced text, comic books…<br />
<br />
“G-gee whiz…I know Jennifer thaid the biggetht dork on the planet, but thith (snort) ith ridiculouth!” He blushed, realizing he’d just snorted loudly. In fear he did it again. Kyle then moved to his closet, hoping to cover his body. He soon found as he opened the door that he’d be able to-though not how he’d thought. <br />
<br />
His socks it seemed had all been replaced by longer ones that seemed capable of going to his knees. His boxers…God, they’d ALL been replaced by whitey tidies. There were even some cartoon character underoos-underoos for pete’s sake! Moving on, he found all of his pants were either corduroy or dress pants, some even with suspenders attached. Looking down in dismay, Kyle found that his shoes were gone-and in their place, a pair of Velcro sneakers, complete with power rangers on the side. As he looked up again, wanting to get it over with, Kyle found all of his shirts were now either dress shirts, or t-shirts with anime characters on the front…something that, disturbingly, he found amazingly cool.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he slipped on the socks, which he couldn’t help but raise to his knees, and a pair of superman underoos. Groaning at the fact that the tight article of clothing didn’t even snuggle against his now small package, Kyle struggled with a tan pair of corduroys, and a t-shirt with the word Pok&eacute;mon in big yellow letters on the front, which he tucked into his pants. Kyle sighed, snorting again as he pulled up the suspenders attached to the pants and snapped them in place.<br />
<br />
Kyle moved to a mirror, taking in his new look. Geez, he looked like a complete geek! What would everyone at school say? Yet as he thought on this, Kyle began to sweat profusely and nervously, feeling timid again, staining his shirt’s shoulders. He started to remember a second set of memories…him, always being like this. Always teased and bullied at school. What had Jennifer do-<br />
<br />
…Jennifer. The thought of her caused Kyle to blush nervously. His little experience with girls gone, Kyle suddenly found himself intimidated, almost frightened by the idea of girls. Especially Jennifer. Just the idea of holding her hand almost seemed too much for him. Though…as he thought about her more-those bouncy breasts, that perfect figure, that sexy face-he started to get turned off. To his horror-and simultaneous delight, he started to imagine her shorter… maybe flatchested…mmm with scrawny legs, and a thick pair of glasses and an ugly snort like his-<br />
<br />
Kyle flushed and snorted in shock. God, that image was turning him on! Yet no matter how hard he tried, it seemed all that could arouse him were thoughts of girls as geeky looking/sounding/acting as he now was. Too bad there were none at his school…<br />
<br />
Wait. He still had the curse! He could get Jennifer with it, and turn her into a dork like he now was! And if he could get the dare too, he could make her act as geeky as he now was, and be his shy, dorky, loyal girlfriend. Kyle imagined her shock over it all, and laughed, his voice sounding like a braying horse. He imagined what was to come, giggling childishly and snorting excitedly.<br />
<br />
With that, he stumbled over to the phone, and dialed in her number. After a few seconds, he heard the other line pick up. The voice was Jennifer’s.<br />
<br />
“Hello?””<br />
<br />
“Tranthform or dare Jennifer!” Kyle then hung up, grinning over when he’d call back in a minute.</p>
