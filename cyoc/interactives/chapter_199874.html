<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I probably should have split this in two but i wasn&#39;t sure where. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What stood before him was the chronivac which was beeping loudly with an alert “ Pregnancy detected! – Select an option.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked up confused and began barking in hopes it would stop, he didn’t understand what it could mean and found the letters to be incomprehensible gibbirish, but feeling like it was urgent he was compelled to act.<br />
<br />
Panting and dashing around the room Jeff was alarmed, he knew alarm sounds were bad and so he kept barking. That was till his ears twitched and as he heard the sound of a car pull up the drull purr of an SUV. That means Owners are home he instinctively thought. Rushing out of the room and barking at the door he heard the familiar sound of keys dangling.  <br />
<br />
"Oh excuse me, Jeff, " his former mother now owner said as she squeezed passed the energized dog who began to sniff intensely towards the shopping bag full of meat.  <br />
<br />
"hah not for you right now boy but I think I have a treat for you here"  His Dad now owner said tossing him a dog treat, Jeff was very happy to see this man, flashes of his face reminded him that this man took him for walks the most and that he would often let jeff cuddle up to him on weekend evenings.  <br />
<br />
Looking to the female owner, standing by the fridge, wearing her white summer dress and a yellow straw hat with a pink ribbon. She was a little colder towards Jeff, but he knew if he sat near her for long enough she'd come give him the best ear rubs.  <br />
<br />
"Darling what's that noise? can you go check the computer?" Jestered the female as jeffs male owner politely nodded.  <br />
<br />
Jeff quickly followed, curious to see what master was doing.  As he was led to the computer room. <br />
<br />
"Hmm I don't know what Sally was doing here but I'll guess close this" he sighed out loud as he  moved to the computer, not having his reading glasses he could quite read the text but a big pop up came up when he went to hit close <br />
<br />
* Save changes? - Additional entities will be stored permanently * <br />
<br />
Not seeing any issue he hit confirm before shutting down the computer and happily walking away, motioning for Jeff to follow. <br />
<br />
Jeff being happy Master stopped the noise followed by his tail wagging behind him.   <br />
<br />

<br />
Sally had just about wrapped up her long afternoon with Mike, mentally and physically drained from the studying and then lovemaking she was glad to be heading home. Without realizing Sally began a mental checklist of things she needed to do this week like topping up her gas and what to wear to her mother's birthday.  <br />
<br />
IT was then that she felt a shudder as a chill went down her spine. Recoiling a bit in her leather upholstery, she rubbed the right side of her neck with her left hand. realizing she was getting sucked into this swapped life.  No... she didn't have to plan for that, after all Jeff and her would swap back tomorrow <br />
<br />
Unsure what this sinking feeling as she was certain of one thing.. She had to check on Jeff.<br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Pulling into the familiar driveway sally stepped out of her 2nd hand ford, reminded of memories throughout the years of running around the garden as a human girl. The day had been a strange one for her, coming to terms with her newly found humanity, she found herself struggling with the idea of giving this all up and returning to her former life. <br />
<br />
Noticing Jeffs parent's car parked Sally walked inside, being careful to step over the garden toys she used to play with as a dog, unsure what exactly to expect.<br />
<br />
 "oh is that you Sally" came a familiar female-sounding voice as she entered the hallway. Putting her keys on the key rack she shouted back<br />
<br />
"Uh yeah just me, I had to do some work with mike and we ended up.. " lingering for a moment, as she nearly spilled the beans about her late afternoon encounter.  " doing a good amount, very productive" she finished, stepping into the living room. <br />
<br />
"I see, well come sit down and tell me all about it, Jeff and your father are currently out for a walk at the moment " she sighed taking a sip from her hot tea before continuing <br />
"that dog, I swear he has too much energy, we should get him neutered, I read online it helps make them more docile"  chuckling a little she put her tea down turning to sally. <br />
"I wanted a female labrador for this exact reason, but oh well, and he is such a sweet dog I'm sure a quick visit to the vet and he'll be fine". <br />
<br />
Caught off guard sally sat down and listened to her *mother* rant, feeling a little conscious about the conversation. In a way, she was responsible for this change in attitude and the thought of jeff being snipped scared her a little, would he be able to undo it if he reverted back? would that make her spaded? <br />
<br />
After a what sally had hoped would be a short conversation but dragged on into, school, boys, fashion, sally kept getting flashes of memories as her mother brought up childhood moments, eventually, the conversation steered round to something she could break away from, leaving her mother to the TV. <br />
<br />
Rubbing her temple, sally could feel a slight headache as So many new memories and thoughts whirled through her mind which reminded her, she should check on the chronivac, it felt like almost a lifetime since she'd used that thing. <br />
<br />
Moving the mouse sally sat stunned for a moment, did the computer turn off? she thought.  <br />
<br />
"Mom did dad do something to the computer? " she shouted, not paying attention to how familiar those words sounded. <br />
<br />
"uh yes dear, it was beeping earlier, making a horrible noise, he told me he saved your work, however" she heard shouted back at her from the living room. <br />
<br />
After shouting back a quick thank you, Sally, turned back and rushed to boot up the PC, Sally quickly re-opened the program, what had happened, it had never beeped before had it? thinking to herself. <br />
<br />
Clicking on the options, she managed to find a list of previous events, It read. <br />
<br />

<br />
Sally sat stunned looking at that message. She and Mike had... and.. that's when it hit her, she had been in human heat, those flushes were her body telling her. She had been so unaware of her emotions and what she had done.. she remembered Jeff's warning about taking it slow and getting used to it.  <br />
<br />
Torn on what to do, Sally clicked around the options, trying to gather her options as drops of tears rolled out her eyes, She had always wanted a litter and that feeling remained despite being human now. But taking a deep breath she knew she had to swap back with jeff, it was unfair for him to have to wait, and then what? would her baby become a puppy? <br />
<br />
After spending a few moments with the chronivac Sally finally found a breakthrough, sighing to herself she...</p>
