<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Please still be out there unknown. I&#39;ve loved your additions, I always have. I cut myself off from the internet for three days to finally get this written. So if someone already posted a reply since then... oops. Oh well. Nothing new with me.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">"Now play nice everyone!" Amethyst declared to her charges and guests once the battle had <br />
resumed after Nane's brush with death. <br />
<br />
Nane's near brush with death and rescue by Gretchen had gotten all the girls' attention, but <br />
Nane being Nane had recovered quickly, and with Gretchen now her declared best friend, <br />
the game was quickly back underway. Of course, Tano, Sita, and Saba were all very very <br />
happy their youngest (she came out last) sister was alright. Normally Nane had control over <br />
situations where she was in trouble (having been her own cause of it) but the bucks were <br />
decidedly not this. <br />
<br />
As the cubs and pups relocated to the front yard, Nane and Gretchen held hands smiling <br />
with Giselle following her twin right behind them. Amethyst smiled at that, 'Only children <br />
can be that direct and that quick to forgive.'  Also, while Nane was loved by her sisters and <br />
pride, her love of pranks had a bad habit of inhibiting her ability to make friends, Gary <br />
would be happy, his biggest regret was that Fox wasn't there to see their daughter learn <br />
more empathy. <br />
<br />
While she wasn't a shiva-wolf like Martha her sub-omegas, she was still loved and <br />
respected by the gem twins as their care taker and tutor. Nicole herself had wondered if <br />
her Alpha Male had bumped his head while assigning her this task, but she had proven to <br />
excel at it.  Amethyst had been suspended from Nicole's self-defense classes for a year <br />
after singing the theme from Kung-Fu Panda one too many times out loud in class... <br />
<br />
Amethyst was many things: cheerful, optimistic, playful, hyperactive, seemingly impossible <br />
to make unhappy, addicted to anything 'cute', and prone to breaking out into musical <br />
numbers like she was a character in a disney movie, but stupid was in fact -not- one of <br />
them. Thus why she was doing her best to stay OUT of the cross fire of the horde of little <br />
lions and wolves as waged water war on each other. <br />
<br />
Two sides with equal numbers and similar age range but very different abilities and tactics. <br />
<br />
With Pence and Jay's scheme of a head on assault not having worked as well as it should <br />
have, the twins turned to a different more unpredictable tactic. <br />
<br />
While the yacht passengers would have nightmares for years on what they had done to <br />
each other while Kurse's pets: it would be a life altering event for the white and gem <br />
wolves having seen the 'benign' side of chaos in their dance.  A dance that would be <br />
ingrained into their bones forever.<br />
<br />
And now that dance was being used to confound the cubs as the pups chaotic tactics left <br />
the cubs very confused. There was a -rhythm-, to this dance, a set of something keeping <br />
it from being mindlessly blind, but whatever it was left left the cub befuddled bewildered, <br />
Mbili panicked and began firing shots wildly, accidently squirting Sita in the face, before <br />
the pups as one on some unseen signal squirted Mbili at once leaving her a dripping mess <br />
and out of the battle. <br />
<br />
The cubs could have used their magic trick to mini-teleport to even up the score that way, <br />
but that felt too much like cheating for Moja and Tano's tastes in spite of their younger <br />
sisters' protests.  <br />
<br />
"The twins don't have magic, it's not fair to them." Moja said calmly, she wasn't impossibly <br />
brilliant for her age like Bart and Jenny were, but she came across as more mature than <br />
either of them which in it's own way scared the pride mates more than Bart and Jenny <br />
scared the pack mates. <br />
<br />
With the game now happening in the front yard (it wasn't like anyone hadn't seen the pups <br />
playing outside the estate before) the fountain was now the more direct source of refilling <br />
their weapons.  This gave Nelson, Helen, and Leslie a front row view of the fun and game <br />
as their water streams were used to refill the weapon guns on the spot. And like in any <br />
conflict, as a major resource, it was coveted greatly by both sides, the three statue wolves <br />
were flattered.  Even as they watched the near twenty children play, all three statues <br />
couldn't help but think of seeing them grow up, find their other half, have cubs of their <br />
own, grow old, and be in the ground, while their own cubs repeated the cycle, and the <br />
strange satisfaction Nelson and his two companions felt at knowing they'd be there to see <br />
it all. <br />
<br />
Unlike the resetting of stone that created the new always-were lives of the rest of the <br />
pride and pack, the transformation of the statue wolves could also be described as 'fate <br />
adaption' or 'fate camouflage' depending on what term was more comfortable to <br />
comprehend, they could become flesh and blood at a moment by majority vote and then <br />
statues again by their own will, and none would comprehend them as anything but as they <br />
were at that time. Kira herself rather naughty in a playful way that she could see and hear <br />
all with none even knowing 'she' was there except as a giant wolf bronze statue to decorate <br />
the entry room's duel staircase. <br />
<br />
"I wonder what their  children will look like." Helen wondered.<br />
<br />
"I wonder what their children's children's will look like." Leslie added.<br />
<br />
"I'm wonder what their children's children's children are going to look like." Communicated <br />
Nelson and they immediately began taking mental bets. <br />
<br />
The water guns had been stored with a layer of dust in the basement (it was a wonder they <br />
hadn't been sold off given the wolves' passion for selling off things that were of no further <br />
value to the pack). The brightly colored (as was required by law) water guns were quite <br />
small compared to the game breaker Super Soakers that were all the rage on the market <br />
that left opposing kids drenched in seconds, but there was a reason why a family as well <br />
off as the Big Bad Wolf pack didn't have the most expensive squirt guns money could buy. <br />
<br />
One of the major downfalls of having a fur coat you couldn't take off was that once you <br />
were soaked, you had to dry off the old fashioned way, and that could take quite a long <br />
time... This inconvenience however was just a fact of life to them. But it did mean that <br />
water wars were much much rarer among their kids on summer days than humans who <br />
could dry off in a fraction of the time. <br />
<br />
Meaning that this was going to be a long and grueling conflict for water supremacy!  Toni <br />
tried to hide behind her twin Paula and the cub Saba, however they had no interest in the <br />
water war being brought into their nice peaceful neutral territory on Nicole's patch of grass <br />
set aside for her lessons and she was quickly tossed out much to Toni's deep shock.<br />
<br />
"I'm your sister!"<br />
<br />
"You're a soldier at war and we don't want you conflict here." Saba said with a grin. <br />
<br />
That was when Moja snipered Toni. <br />
<br />
"Four of a kind beats two pairs!"  Nane happily declared drawing everyone's attention to her <br />
but she dodge having had years of practice. Giselle was even wondering if her twin had <br />
turned traitor was aiming to miss with Nane.   <br />
<br />
Much like the daughters of Elise and Brian plus Fox's and Gary's daughters, the twins <br />
remembered always having been together, never having been apart, thought they didn't <br />
feel the overwhelming -need- to be alongside each other as the triplets did.<br />
<br />
But weather the twins remembered their parents being lost during the crisis with Kurse like <br />
the pride did Elise and Fox, or weather they had parents already among the pack, neither <br />
Alice or Marie, or Madam Serenity or Gill knew yet.<br />
<br />
Moja left herself wide open, and quickly retreated between some crabapple trees. When <br />
Toni followed for revenge, Moja with a perfectly calm and cool look on her face pulled a <br />
tiny string, releasing a mass of water balloons from behind drenching Toni utterly, taking <br />
her out of the game. <br />
<br />
"I'd... I'd expect that from Nane... but... but not you!" <br />
<br />
"This is war, and Miss Amethyst didn't say anything about water balloons in the rules of <br />
engagement."  Moja said with a straight face and a totally calm demeanor still holding the <br />
string. <br />
<br />
The drenched Toni said, "You should have been one of us."<br />
<br />
"I prefer meowing to barking, but thank you." Moja said evenly but politely in return. <br />
<br />
Saba meanwhile was showing Paula her personal wrestling style which seemed to be a <br />
strange mix of judo, tidbits of Nicole's martial arts, and a impressive helping of pseudo <br />
'Krav Maga' police training hand to hand. <br />
<br />
What amazed Saba was how quickly Paula picked up on the aggressive style, particular <br />
when Toni had been playing the defensive though most of the water game. <br />
<br />
Saba said to the Topaz colored twin, "You don't act much like your sister."<br />
<br />
Paula replied wilily, "Oh and you're a carbon copy of your sisters?"<br />
<br />
"Point." Saba and Paula then simultaneously succeeded in tripping each other. <br />
<br />
Some had found it interesting that Kaylee and her three fraternal quadruplets were not all <br />
mated to the same male. However the four of them found nothing strange about it, they <br />
were unique individuals after all.<br />
<br />
The triplets were unique in their unity, they took a very large amount of pride in that. Their <br />
sense of oneness, sense of wholeness, and yet they never ever got the names of their <br />
sisters wrong, ever, even if only Jensen, Kaylee, Bobbi, and the glass cubs were the only <br />
ones besides who could tell them apart without ever failing once. <br />
<br />
The triplets even outside the wolf pack were somewhat minor legends. They had actually <br />
been tested a few times as cubs as their unity became obvious, the first being when as <br />
infants they would cry and wake up at the same time. Some card tests proved they weren't <br />
telepathic, but their emotional states seemed to echo off each other along with their <br />
psychology when they got completely identical profiles on a psychological evaluation. <br />
Again, the triplets were delighted by the news rather than agitated or worried about their <br />
lack of differences. There was some inexplicable and truly comforting feeling at their <br />
sameness for them. <br />
<br />
 Of course during their fifteen minutes of fame the media had eaten up some triplets that <br />
actually acted as the comic books depicted them, much to the annoyance of other such <br />
identical siblings. <br />
<br />
 It was actually a bit of confusion and discomfort to Julie and Fran when they didn't become <br />
pregnant until two and half years after Darla, it actually made them feel as if something <br />
was WRONG with themselves!  The idea of -losing- their unity honestly scared them. They <br />
had been overjoyed when Jensen had accepted all three of them as his beta female. <br />
<br />
No one had a clue about the magic (and yes magic it was) that had made Alice and her <br />
siblings become living glass and enter a reality that apparently genuinely existed on the <br />
other side of the mirrors.  The fact they were impossible to destroy as glass, and could <br />
travel anywhere in the world (and possibly the universe) within a few steps, had been a <br />
relatively close family secret shared between the pack and pride (much like the <br />
quadruplet's talents). They didn't want their children being sent carrying bombs into the <br />
bathrooms of third world dictators after all.  They couldn't be killed as glass, but that didn't <br />
mean they couldn't be buried under five tons of rubble or something equally horrid. <br />
<br />
Nneli had always been entranced by Alice and her sisters since their transformation (their <br />
magic induced mutation having caused fifteen minutes of fame themselves that had since <br />
died off), she could always emphasis with glass art somehow. Nneli had actually pawed <br />
over them at times, just to feel their living glass bodies -move-. <br />
<br />
They weren't exact replicas of each other like their mothers (the most obvious being their <br />
age difference from Alice), something that actually seemed to drag down Samantha and <br />
Abbey ever so slightly not being exactly like Alice. And it had actually left the triplets <br />
confused themselves that their daughters hadn't carried on their strange trait of being the <br />
ultimate 'three of a kind.'<br />
<br />
Abby and Samantha of course had been two and a half during Alice's fifth birthday, so they <br />
were more confused more than terrified when Alice had turned into living glass. Alice's <br />
name becoming an irony was not lost on Darla at all, and had only intensified Alice's <br />
interest in Lewis Carol (and the near legendary author's interest in semantics). <br />
<br />
There was no way to know how much Alice's growth and that of her sisters had been <br />
slowed down by their time in the outside world but that seemed to be the last thing on <br />
anyone's mind, most of all the glass pups themselves. <br />
<br />
Amy and glass Marie (coming as a shocker to all parties involved that another such as <br />
themselves existed, leaving Marie's mother a point of visiting Glendale herself with her <br />
daughter eventually), didn't dare humor the idea of the three girls becoming the same <br />
age... the price reality would extract from -that- revision neither cared to find out. Every <br />
revision either eastern or western spiritualist invoked on the repairing of reality seemed to <br />
cause an equal and opposite reaction (Newton would be proud).<br />
<br />
Alice's and her sisters' indestructibility was something else neither dared touch.  And the <br />
triplet's daughters invincibility had been proven repeatedly in situations that were better <br />
left forgotten. A ninja like burglar who had startled and shot Samantha between the eyes <br />
which had simply rolled off her like a rain drop after impact not even leaving a mark.<br />
<br />
A buzz saw in the garage shortly before Bart and Jenny had created their shadows had <br />
slipped and gone towards a curious Abby's neck, shattering the buzz saw, actually leaving <br />
leaving shrapnel that need to be taken out of Darla and Fran by Julie. Abbey had been <br />
mortified, but her aunts and mother insisted nothing was wrong and it wasn't her fault. The <br />
taking apart of the two cars that had been two small for the pack members and were worth <br />
more as scrap than on the market had resumed soon after (it was a task that needed doing <br />
after all). <br />
<br />
And during a baseball game, Alice being her normal curious self had gotten a bat to the <br />
forehead which left a dent in the metal bat but herself not even phased. <br />
<br />
Given Alice's often overwhelming curiosity, along with her sisters slowly imitating her in <br />
such regards... their invulnerability could have been considered a good thing in spite of the <br />
less than apparent prices of not being allowed to die if caught in a situation they couldn't <br />
escape from. <br />
<br />
"Hey, Welcome to loserville." Mbili said smiling on her muzzle as Toni sat besides her <br />
under the watch of the fountain statues. <br />
<br />
"Thanks." Toni replied no trace of agitation or bitterness. Both thought of the same thing <br />
at the same time and pushed each other into the fountain, both ended up laughing. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
The ship sailed through the evening and into the night again on it's dauntless trek back to <br />
New Zealand, the fuel having been lost traveling to Big Bad Island under Glass' influence <br />
had cut the cruise trip very much short and the  And the psychological trauma to boot <br />
wanting all to very much just go home. <br />
<br />
The civilian volunteer group, 'Royal New Zealand Coastguard' had finally found the cruise <br />
yacht after it had picked up it's radio signal. No one dared mentioned how the ship's <br />
existence had for around twenty four hours along with her crew and passengers had <br />
vanished from the memories and records of everything and everyone only to reappear <br />
much tot he shock and alarm of everyone involved that they could forget such a thing!!!  <br />
The passengers and crew had no clue how much they should share, how much they dared <br />
share, and how much they could share without being seen as lunatics. Though the world <br />
did also have the problem of several million people around the globe but mostly centered <br />
in the United States being suddenly mutated into utterly inhumane creatures and mutating <br />
others with the words 'Transform or Dare' then all simply reverting, most only having a <br />
vague sense of the true cause. No one of course noticing those who had mutated and <br />
stayed mutated simply cause as far as existence was concerned they had been born that <br />
way. <br />
<br />
The two attempted suicides were still (rightfully) under careful watch, the pregnant woman <br />
was having nightmares, and was becoming nearly hypochondriactic  over what having been <br />
mutated and back again and the act of depravity while her psyche and body had been <br />
warped had done to her unborn child.  The doctor on board assured her that there was no <br />
sign of her child being malformed.  But that didn't stop her visions or nightmares of her <br />
child being born a chimera, clawing out of her, stillborn, or any other number of horrid <br />
things. <br />
<br />
The crew themselves felt a particular brand of anger and self loathing at having failed <br />
utterly in their duty to protect their passengers and ship and having to rely on a total <br />
outside force to save them from a forever of being -things- that could only think and <br />
comprehend the current moment. The fact Marie/Martin had become the second Glass, the <br />
first Glass being Samantha, who had brainwashed them all to coming to the island in the <br />
first place, left her with a rather cold reception from many, they needed something to <br />
focus their negative emotions on after all... maybe Marie not showing herself much was a <br />
good thing. <br />
<br />
None of the passengers or crew wondered at no one asking about Luna or Sunny. <br />
<br />
Like glass Marie's mother Eliza, many of the passengers if their fate had been shared by <br />
their loved ones or life companions instead of being blindly random, would have -much to <br />
their horror and shame- not minded remaining things that explored their vices without <br />
limit, without shame, and without regret rather than face the soul crushing depression and <br />
anxiety that ran though them. <br />
<br />
Jose, Dennis, Pedro, Mark, Amanda, Candice, Aaron, and Cindy: the passengers'  children <br />
likewise might have yearned for a return to that wretched state, if they were not left with <br />
the horrid psychological scars of seeing their parents act like the way they did to each <br />
other and themselves under Kurse's perversion. They had tasted a sick comfort at acting <br />
like complete savages, without the rules imposed by the world of adults. The one <br />
exception was the boy Mark... who had read 'Lord of the Flies.' <br />
<br />
Maylene hadn't let her son Dennis out of her sight for anything more than a eye-blink <br />
since being reunited. She also looked ready to break the arm of anyone who so much tried <br />
to touch him. This had scared little Amanda when she had offered the boy a piece of cake <br />
and she saw the look in his mother's eyes. <br />
<br />
One of the passengers, a bald, middle aged, fat man named Gilbert had been round <br />
masturbating in his room giggling to himself and then crying then giggling again, asking <br />
Kurse to take him back. Of course, Kurse no longer existed in any shape or form, and the <br />
passengers and crew knew this. All the same, Gilbert was placed under watch as well just to <br />
be in the safe side. The first mate had even called in request an Exorcist to offer his <br />
services to the passengers and crew once they reached port.  The pregnant woman and <br />
glass Marie were to be first in line, (at Eliza's request, she wanted to make as sure and sure <br />
that her child didn't still have any of that horrid mad women's essence hiding within her, <br />
she'd rather die herself than have Marie used again by those evil dead mad women).<br />
<br />
Eliza with Rick was worried sick at Marie when she had gone into the mirrors and had only <br />
said she was going to go visit the wolves in Glendale and explain the full story about the <br />
witches... Eliza wished her child had simply stayed with her instead! Couldn't they all just <br />
put this horrible, horrible event behind them and become a family-?! "Please Marie, I'll <br />
always love you, I don't care -what- you are, you're still my baby, please, please, just come <br />
home to mommy..." Eliza whispered to the mirror in her cabin. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
"Come along big boy," Said Robyn pushing on the rump of a buck whose name was Roland, <br />
being side to be out of angle of those nasty hooves. "You came this here way you can leave <br />
this here way too, ya know we ain't tryin' ta drown ya."<br />
<br />
"Don't tell me you're starting too." Maxine said herding another buck to the waiting <br />
waterline named Harry. <br />
<br />
"Hey girlfriend," Robyn said, "There gotta be some old reason little Miss Alice gets these <br />
deer ta always listen to her. And Ah ain't talkin' Aquaman telepathy either." <br />
<br />
With the bucks showing no sigh of all out attacking the wolves since they were making no <br />
moves on the does, the gargoyles were there pretty much as a formality. Northwest, <br />
Southwest, Southeast, and Northeast, were stationed on the edge of the islands in the <br />
respective spots using the sun as a crude compass.Frontdoor, the only male among the <br />
stone wolf-dragon hybrid was facing each other on other ends of the beach the deer were <br />
being taken one at a time by Alice and Abbey. <br />
<br />
Being led along by a purple somewhat scrawny purple wolf who looked more scared of him <br />
than Adam was of the wolf, Adam wondered were Samantha was. He had never seen the <br />
glass wolves were apart before. It was rather disorienting, while they were the wolves' prey, <br />
Adam did hope the blond/glass wolf pup was okay. It was quite a strange feeling for <br />
Adam. But having seen the young life of the next Adam and Eve taken away before they <br />
could even be born, he didn't want to see more young life stolen from the world. <br />
<br />
Robert and Wendy stood at the end of the line, while Jessica and Rose flanked the start of <br />
the line.   Rose kept a particular close eye on her fellow pink wolves Maxine, Tourmaline, <br />
and Coral, making sure they stayed on task and didn't start flirting with Ulysses again. <br />
Ruby and Emerald had been called back to the island to make sure the bucks didn't break <br />
rank as they were moved along on opposite sides, the two always working best as a pair. <br />
<br />
Garnet (just glade Amethyst and the japanese she-wolves' breasts were on the other side <br />
of the planet where she couldn't get smushed into them as seemed her curse), along with <br />
Amber, Tourmaline and Coral were keeping the doe passive doing their best with body <br />
language to imply they were into hunting right now. After all, they had brought the deer <br />
here by similar means, so if the gold deer were as intelligent as the science books said they <br />
were then the wolves should know the teenage wolves meant not harm.  Caroline/Cobalt <br />
and Opal while coordinating the actions of their fellow gem wolves were also keeping the <br />
bucks forming them their line.  <br />
<br />
Once the race had reached the end of the shoreline, the deer turned ready for a fight that <br />
never came. Good thing too. Humans had neither the speed nor strength of lupmen or <br />
leomen, but dang, did they have -endurance!- Some African tribes would kill off their prey <br />
just by endlessly walking towards it until the animal died from exhaustion. Lions were built <br />
to hit the prey hard and fast from surprise. Wolves were more relatively similar in their style <br />
of getting their kills. <br />
<br />
With Samantha recovering from her ordeal as Kurse's 'daughter' that left Alice and Abbey to <br />
lead the deer back to the mansion, meaning it would take a third longer this time to carry <br />
on the task. The gallery wolves honestly didn't mind, now being filtered by glass Marie, Big <br />
Bad Island wasn't look much the nightmare of a madman and more the fever dream of My <br />
Little Pony meets the Care Bears.  The gargoyles just endured it (they had no love of plant <br />
life, it ate rock!), Ulysses and Orpal thought it was nice. And having been statues for years <br />
and some even centuries, the gallery wolves had learned to appreciate art in all it's forms. <br />
<br />
Maxine and Robyn wanted to get back to tease Millie about their new ages while they still <br />
remembered being adults. Ulysses wanted to get back to Sarah and Mary (even if she <br />
wasn't a wolf and five years younger than him, she was cute). The gem wolves were in no <br />
hurry to get back. <br />
<br />
While both girls wanted to spend time with their half-sister, they knew Miss Martha <br />
wouldn't let anything bad happen to her, and Jack and Marcine's herd needed to be brought <br />
back to the estate which was their -home-, not this distant island purposely in the middle <br />
of nowhere east of no man's land. <br />
<br />
They were glade that the lion cubs had offered to use their own talents to help the does <br />
return to the manor after the bucks had been relocated. The quadruplets were magic <br />
detectors and able to teleport the way the glass pups could in the world inside the mirror. <br />
It meant Jack wouldn't have be separated from Marcie as long. And Harry from Betty and <br />
Roland from Veronica, and Adam and 'Oh yes, I forgot for a moment,  ... that the deer <br />
Adam and Eve will never be together again...'  Alice thought, she was glade that Abbey <br />
didn't know about Adam's loss of Eve.  The herd was their major food source, and how the <br />
pack and pride didn't starve to death or was dirt poor from feeding itself, Alice felt they <br />
deserved some respect, it was only proper. <br />
<br />
Both girls had returned to the island after Alice had told Jack that it was not very proper to <br />
attack a cub playing a game. Of course Alice did this without fear, she was indestructible <br />
after all in the outside world, and none of the deer ever so much as thought of harming her <br />
or her sisters in the world within the mirror that was Alice and her sisters' (and apparently <br />
Marie's) world. <br />
<br />
Garnet thought as she joined the doe Veronica in an informal staring contest, 'Our internal <br />
clocks are all going to be so messed up when we're done here it's gonna take days for us <br />
all to get over our 'jet lag.' Or is that mirror lag? Oh who cares.' <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jack and Tom the first bucks through observed the estate, being much as it had <br />
been when they had first gone through the mirror world (a part of Jack curious on how he <br />
knew what a mirror was!). He was glade the cubs and pups were out of sight. ~I know they <br />
only hunt rabbits and never go after the fawn themselves... but I don't like it when they're <br />
whooping and snarling when not actually hunting, it feels like mixed signals and <br />
cheating.~<br />
<br />
~They are merely preparing for when it's their turn to hunt sir, the adults know we'll kill <br />
their pups and cubs if they tried to hunt us with no experience or skill to defend <br />
themselves.~ Tom observed.  <br />
<br />
Jack looked back at the surface they had come out of, a mirror. Again, Jack was left <br />
wondering how he knew what that was. It had nothing to do with something to eat or <br />
something that would eat him, so why should he know? <br />
<br />
'A good question Jack-Sama.' Amy thought looking up from what she had just written in <br />
her own blood on the scroll she had with her on the roof. It said more or less in japanese <br />
kanji: <br />
<br />
<i> Again, Jack was left wondering how he knew what that was. It had nothing to do with <br />
something to eat or something that would eat him, so why should he know?  </i>   <br />
<br />
It felt only proper for Amy to address Jack as '-Sama', he was the Prime Buck of the Herd <br />
after all, just as Jensen-Sama was the Alpha Male of the Pack. The irony being that the Big <br />
Bad wolves followed more the white-washed theme park version of how a wolf pack <br />
worked than the actual facts related to them in example the alphas being actual 'leaders' <br />
rather than simply being at the top of the pecking order.  Martha as a Omega was <br />
surprising accurate in spite of Kaylee's original intent of sadism, Omegas often WERE the <br />
nannies of the pack.   The alpha being the ones in the pack with the most resources to <br />
successfully breed a litter, other members of the pack could try, but weren't likely to <br />
succeeded in raising them to adulthood. <br />
<br />
The pride didn't have a single unified leader, but divided up it's leadership. 'I had better get <br />
down soon, -Haha -Chichi of course wouldn't care much for me being on the roof alone,' <br />
Alice thought (using the japanese term when addressing your own parents). Thankfully <br />
with all the commotion below, no one thought to look above (as was typical of people in <br />
general), only the statue wolves could happen to see her, and they didn't seem in a rush to <br />
ask her to get down. <br />
<br />
Adam and Roland meanwhile were brought the edge by the peaceful and trust worthy Alice <br />
and Abbey (when everything was said and done, they had no scent, none whatsoever in the <br />
outside world, and the way they acted, made them relatively non-theatening to the deer if <br />
slightly unsettling). And then pulled into the thankfully calm water (pulling into choppy <br />
water was impossible due to a SMOOTH reflective surface being required, a new limit Alice <br />
had noticed, or perhaps now had always been there was that they could only enter and exit <br />
mirrors that were the proper size, meaning they could no longer enter and exit through he <br />
reflective surface of a stick of wrapped chewing gum. <br />
<br />
"Please do not be alarmed or scared if you would kindly." Alice said using her formal and <br />
proper style of speech avoiding contracting and being a precise as possible, "You shall be <br />
back home after we pass through the mirror at the estate soon. Your does will be back <br />
home again after you and the other buck are back home first. Please do not give me or my <br />
half-sister that look. The does are as precious to the pack and pride as they are to you, <br />
after all, we need you as you in your own way need us." <br />
<br />
Roland personally didn't want to admit it, but sadly he had to agree with this strange wolf <br />
shaped piece of glass (how did he know what glass was?).  The Golden Deer due to their <br />
unique fur, had pelts that were worth a fortune among humans, and being -much- smarter <br />
than their stupid, -stupid- white tail cousins, some human were a little too eager to <br />
vivisect their brains to figure out what separated them from their empty headed hillbilly <br />
cousins.<br />
<br />
'The pack and pride don't care about our coats, or our brains,' Roland thought, 'They just <br />
want the flesh from our bones.'  Thus after the pack or pride had taken down a member of <br />
the herd, they could retrieved anything that was left of the hide to add it to their memory <br />
collection of saying goodbye to the previous generation as the new one took it's place as <br />
was their duty and fate. The Golden Deer felt a sense of pride in this generational <br />
consistency much as the triplet felt at their own sameness. <br />
<br />
Adam of course regretted that Eve had been unable to fulfill her duty, and he himself <br />
regretted that he had failed in his duty to help her fulfill hers. The loss of Eve Jr. before she <br />
could even be allowed to enter the world saddened Adam greatly. Another odd thing about <br />
the gold deer was that they seemed to mate for life and had singular partners (and while <br />
the buck will kill any interloper on the spot, they wouldn't harm the fawns born from such <br />
a unlawful union, making it even more bizarre). <br />
<br />
But even a previous trip through wonderland still didn't prepare the deer for what <br />
happened next, and was likely the cause of Jack and Tom's panicking when Alice and <br />
Abbey hadn't given them time to calm down (Alice blamed herself, she was the older one, <br />
and should have known better). <br />
<br />
Chester, and other mundane pets that Alice and her sisters had brought into the mirror <br />
world had not had a change in appearance as people did when they entered the mirror <br />
universe that Alice and her sisters felt instinctively drawn to as their home. Alice, Marie, <br />
Abbey, and Samantha were only flesh and blood within the realm of mirrors, appearing in <br />
dresses that resembled the one the legendary character 'Alice' written about by Lewis <br />
Carol.  Alice's dress blue and white, her sisters white and blue, while Marie's was black and <br />
red with runes. All else who entered either became a glass wolf pup and/or ended up <br />
wearing 19th century clothing until they left.<br />
<br />
This all made things very interesting and very confusing when the deer entered the mirror <br />
world, and ended up with harnesses like they were horses meant to draw buggies (like Tom <br />
and Adam), a couple ended up with body paint right out of 'Princess Mononoke.' (Jack Sr. <br />
and Marcine Sr.) and some even looked like they were dressed up like the reindeer of <br />
Santa's sleigh! (Not all that impossible, after all, Santa's current imagine as a reverse <br />
robber baron had been a American cultural invention).<br />
<br />
This had confused the leomens and lupmens alike. After all, they were just clever animals <br />
after all right? Welcome to rule one about personhood, you're personhood is in direct <br />
relation to how much you can verbally fight back. <br />
<br />
Alice and her sisters didn't seem all that surprised at all however. Amy also hadn't seemed <br />
all that surprised. Being a person had nothing to do with limbs, DNA, number of cells, it <br />
was the undefinable, undecipherable, eternal immortal soul that defined one as such.  And <br />
if you believed in vampire hunters, some swore by all they held sacred they had visions of <br />
the spirits of those afflicted with vampirism to destroy the spirit's curse infested corpse.  <br />
<br />
But even among all this consistency reality had painstakingly put together there were flies <br />
in the ointment. <br />
<br />
The original transform or dare had been precise that communication between anything <br />
other than another deer would be futile for Jack and Marcine and vice versa.  Alice's words <br />
should have been meaningless jibberish. However Alice acted as if the beasts understood <br />
her perfectly and the beasts seemed to. If this was another cheat, it was chilling to think <br />
what reality would seek as counter balance. <br />
<br />
An entire herd of dumb mundane animals had been uplifted to true self awareness, <br />
thankfully that one seemed to be more reality balancing itself out more a cheat. <br />
<br />
But there was one thing reality was forced by it's very nature to abide by, that Jack and <br />
Marcine had -names-, once something had a name, the name couldn't be then simply <br />
taken away. And now thanks to Jack and Marcine naming their herd members in the <br />
original timeline, all their herd had -names- as well, more than that, they had -human- <br />
names, english ones at that as well.  Odd in particular since it was clear that the names <br />
were passed down from parent to child.  What had been the -origin- of these names? <br />
English had existed in the new world for less than a thousand years, and it was unlikely <br />
these deer would have chosen new names as descendants of former Europeans had become <br />
the new major population of North America. <br />
<br />
If this was so, what would be the price for cheating one way dear communication? And <br />
who was going to pay for it? <br />
<br />
And if the deer being on Big Bad Island was a science experiment to test their adaptability, <br />
where were the researchers? Where were the notes -on- the experiment? And why was no <br />
one there to record notes on the deer returning home now to see how well and how fast <br />
they adjusted -back- to their native home? <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The mirror world where glass Marie was telling her story Lilly asked,  "Could the natives see <br />
what was happening? They weren't stupid." <br />
<br />
Marie replied, "Remember, before the Europeans sough to crush their cultural and racial <br />
identity to try and force them to think and act as if -they- were somehow Europeans, the <br />
native Americans were a people of -nations-. And like any -nations- composed of people <br />
they had enemies among themselves and -wars-, same as the Europeans who accidently <br />
brought the plagues of Europe to them and often saw the people they met as less than <br />
human."<br />
<br />
"Indians had wars?" The idea to Casanda felt incomprehensible, the cartoons always <br />
showed the 'indians' as fundamentally better and naturally superior in every way to the <br />
settlers: in other words the exact opposite of the entertainment shown to children a <br />
hundred or so years ago and just as deceptive.<br />
<br />
"Yes, Native Americans -did- have wars before 'the white man' came. The Europeans were <br />
actually able to expand at times by aiding one side of an opposing tribe. On a more <br />
amusing note, Europeans honestly thought that a patriarchal culture was the natural state <br />
for human beings, finding matriarchal cultures in North America shocked them to the <br />
core."<br />
<br />
"Don't you mean 'indigenous people?'" Betty asked Lawrence next to her all entranced by <br />
glass Marie's tale of the three innocent girls who would become Gaal, Gamorrah and <br />
Galgatha. And the one-eyed girl Marie Cruz who'd gather the four others who along with <br />
her who'd end the witches' rampage at a terrible cost. <br />
<br />
"Madam, Native Americans immigrated from Russia over an ice bridge some 20,000 years <br />
ago, longer than humans have lived in England. Indigenous people is a vague and <br />
misleading term much as the misnomer 'indians' is and was. And everyone is indigenous <br />
somewhere. But none of this is really the -point- of what I'm telling you. So Balthilde <br />
Volksheer asked Joseph Running-Bear to look after her granddaughters when she knew <br />
her time would be over...." <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Balthilde Volksheer, seer and indebted servant to puritan Ronald Wise had now made <br />
Joseph Running-Bear the god father of her granddaughters (both the ones by blood and <br />
the one in spirit). Doing this with a man you just met should have been considered <br />
foolishness, but Balthilde's talents as a seer <br />
<br />
"Now dears," Balthilde had said, "I want you listen to Mr. Joseph Running-Bear whenever <br />
I'm too busy or away to be with you. He's a very nice man and he'll be kind to you."<br />
<br />
"Yes Grandmother." All three girls replied, including Goldwyn who holding their friend. A <br />
small black cat whom she had found shortly before fleeing what would one day be <br />
germany. <br />
<br />
"Black cats," glass Marie explained in her narrative, "In some cultures are actually <br />
considered good luck instead of bad luck, but this black cat, considered a witch's familiar <br />
for being in the presence of witches at all. But in either case, the black cat whose name <br />
would be Herodias, functioned as a perfectly good mouser while on board ship, and had <br />
the strange talent of slipping in and out of people's perceptions, including Balthilde's." <br />
<br />
"They had their familiars already?" Lawrence asked, remembering Herodias from when he <br />
had been Lance and Willy.<br />
<br />
"No," 'Glass' Marie shook her head, "Only Herodias, they wouldn't come to own Lilith or <br />
Salome a year and a two years respectively later. And 'Herodias' and she'd be ultimately <br />
called wasn't technically Godwyn's familiar, yet." <br />
<br />
After leaving Runner-Bear's home, Balthilde and her granddaughters happened by a <br />
missionary who was speaking to some younger natives, "So you see the deer your father <br />
killed was for the greater good, and Jesus in kind allowed himself to die for the greater <br />
good." <br />
<br />
Goldwyn carrying the cat Herodias to be looked at the young natives, and thought back to <br />
when they had been departing the old world to save their lives. Of a spanish lass maybe six <br />
months older than Goldwyn with dark hair cut short almost like a boy's cut, being led along <br />
by a clergy man in the opposite direction that the witchlings had been going. The two's <br />
eyes had met for all of five seconds, both looking curiously and innocently at the other <br />
with no prejudice or fear. <br />
<br />
Goldwyn brain was struck by lightning and using the simplistic myopic logic of a child <br />
realized the problem, 'Children start out nice, but become bad when they become adults, <br />
so if they stay kids, they stay good.' <br />
<br />
Glass Marie in her narative said, "The sisters first use of unfiltered magic on a <br />
unsuspecting child their own age after seeing how nicer the child is relatively to the adult <br />
and decided that the best way to keep the child nice was for her to never grow up.  These <br />
'acts of kindness' as they saw them in their minds had rather tragic results."<br />
<br />
Goldwyn explained her plan to her sisters who were all equally delighted at the idea, <br />
knowing they were doing a good deed. <br />
<br />
While their mother had been working, the girls had begun their sublime task of what they <br />
considered, nay, what they KNEW to be a genuine act of goodness, after all, they were <br />
smart unlike the puritans, so of course they knew better, so of course their conclusions had <br />
to be right. <br />
<br />
They found a little boy playing alone behind his house barely old enough to be playing by <br />
himself near a fountain (VERY expensive). <br />
<br />
"Hello." Said Gita, the eldest.<br />
<br />
"Ugh. Girls? Who are you?"<br />
<br />
"I'm Grisele." "I'm Goldwyn and this is Princess." "And I'm Gita."<br />
<br />
"I'm Joey! Now go away, I don't wanna play dolls with girls, mama only gave a bit to play."<br />
<br />
"What if you didn't have to go inside? What if you could stay out here as long as you'd like, <br />
would you like that?"<br />
<br />
"Huh? Sure, that would sound fun but-"<br />
<br />
"OKAY!"  The three girls cheered together. <br />
<br />
Herodias calmly let the flow of perception both third eye and otherwise flow around her <br />
owner and her subject, it wouldn't do if the old woman or the native interfered at this <br />
critical point on her master's destiny.  She also ever so slightly filtered the infinite chaos <br />
herself, her owner couldn't suffer prolonged exposure, just yet. <br />
<br />
The boy's arms went slack at his sides, a grin appeared on his face as his eyes went glassy <br />
as if in a fever dream. He stripped himself till he was bare naked, the girls giggling at the <br />
sight of him and he didn't mind in the least, nothing minded him. His clothes were quickly <br />
eaten up by the grass and he felt the irresistible urge to climb on top of the fountain that <br />
his mother had strictly forbidden him of ever doing so. He then felt his legs fuse together, <br />
and something impale him through one leg, but feeling no pain what so ever. He felt his <br />
feet actually become one with the fountain, feeling the rest of the fountain as if it was a <br />
part of him, or rather, he was a part of the fountain. He then began to pee right in front of <br />
the girls, but only plain water came out. He never noticed that he had stopped moving or <br />
lost the ability to move, only enjoying the endless feeling of the water rushing up through <br />
him and then out of him. His body then turned faded green, water stains forming on his <br />
body as it became stone the same age as the rest of the fountain. <br />
<br />
"He is happy," Whispered, 'Princess,' ever so lowley, "You have done, you have done very <br />
good."  And so a child with a life ahead of him, was now just a piece of sculpted rock and <br />
primitive piping with what had been a little boy's soul ingrained into the stone as part of <br />
the creative process as all artists left a tiny fragment of their soul behind in their work. <br />
<br />
The girls clapped and cheered at a job well done. The fountain smiling inward even more at <br />
their applause.  Grisele took notice of the flowers, it brightly colored, it reminded her of <br />
the tulips she had seen in the old world. A minute or so later the little boy's sister had <br />
come out not giving the fountain a second glance. <br />
<br />
"Oh hello." She said politely curtsying her sun dress and tipping her large brim hat in their <br />
direction. <br />
<br />
"Hi!" The witchlings replied. <br />
<br />
The girls introduced themselves, the little lady not asking what they were doing in her <br />
family's backyard. <br />
<br />
"Your flowers are very pretty." Said Grisele, they remind me of tulips.<br />
<br />
"What are tulips?" The girl asked politely in return. <br />
<br />
She and Grisele then spoke if the flowers both of them knew, and Grisele asking how she'd <br />
like to spend more time with her precious flowers. <br />
<br />
Five minute later a smiling naked jade statue of a little girl with an open hand for holding <br />
live flowers decorated the garden as well with vines growing around it's legs to imply it had <br />
been there for years. <br />
<br />
The wolf Marie said, "Their grandmother would do her best to explain calmly and slowly <br />
that what they did was cruel. If she found out past 'Princess' or rather Herodias' hiding the <br />
girls' activities from her."<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
The same year the girls' fled to the New World, before a young woman had lost her eye <br />
destroying something that was neither alive nor human by anyone's definition, before the <br />
loss of that eye had given her vision while her other eye still provided her with sight, a <br />
little girl cried, her beautiful long black hair having been cut short. <br />
<br />
"You should hate them." <br />
<br />
Marie looked up from her tears and looked at the black cat sitting calmly staring at her not <br />
an inch away.<br />
<br />
"Huh?"<br />
<br />
"Those adults, you should hate them. They say they have God's gift, God's favor, God's <br />
word, but when your parents got sick, they couldn't save them, you parents got ugly, <br />
twisted, then slowly died. And they couldn't save them. They failed you, failed your parents <br />
you should hate them."<br />
<br />
"But ... they saved me." Marie remembered the old man who saw how she was sick, and <br />
thought she was going to spread the same sickness as everyone else even though she was <br />
sneezing and wheezing, when her parents had been bleeding in places. <br />
<br />
The old man whom her parents had owned their rent to tried to burn her along with the <br />
bodies of her dead parents, when the man in the bird mask had knocked the old man out <br />
with his cane and taken her from there, then the man had taken off the bird's mask, and <br />
coat, and put on the robes of a man of the Church when they reached what Marie figured <br />
was his home. <br />
<br />
"You should hate them! Listen! These people couldn't save your parents or anyone! Why <br />
bother with them! Run away from this place!"<br />
<br />
"But, I have nowhere else to go,"<br />
<br />
"Any place is better than this!"<br />
<br />
"No."<br />
<br />
The black cat hissed and snarled leapt close, "Listen here you stupid-"<br />
<br />
Marie screamed in alarm at the black cat's sudden action and swatted it away, accidently <br />
impaling it against a discarded poker. Marie cried out at realizing she had done. <br />
<br />
The man who had saved her rushed into the room to see what was wrong. Seeing the black <br />
cat he got a short recount from the little girl. He took the poker the cat was still impaled <br />
on and dumped it out the window. <br />
<br />
When they left the house, and she spotted some girls with an old lady she assumed was <br />
their granny, looking so happy, they were a family, she envied them. <br />
<br />
She looked at the man who had saved her. She had to ask.  "Do you really have God's <br />
favor?" <br />
<br />
He looked at her wearing his mask, "No one has God's favor Marie, because we are all <br />
precious to Him." <br />
<br />
<br />
'Highly skilled. Unofficial. And expendable. In my own way, I'm precious to the Inquisition <br />
as well.' Marie thought years later. <br />
<br />
"Miss Cruz, if I may ask, what do you plan to do with these 'witches'  if they really exist, <br />
and if you're really able to find them, and you're really able to subdue them?" Asked a lanky <br />
young man who looked like he had just earned his robes as a cleric. <br />
<br />
Marie remembered the last thing her god father had ever said to her, <br />
<br />
<i> Her god father placed his hands on her shoulders and knelt down looking her in the <br />
eyes, "Marie, God's universe is one based on truth, remember that if nothing else."  </i> <br />
<br />
Marie turned to look at him with her good eye and smiled, "They'll face the one thing <br />
people who despise order hate above all else: due process." <br />
<br />
<br />
However, back when the three witches were still very much innocent, <br />
<br />
"Roland, Harry, Tom, Adam, Jack, can you play with Miss Volksheer's girls this afternoon?" <br />
Said Misses Wise. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Serenity sat on the couch of Trevor's family looking though their family album, stunned by <br />
how thorough the changes in the books were from what it had to have been before.<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity could not be transformed, be it were wolves, vampires, magic, or even, as <br />
it seemed, revisions to existence, she was a fact, static on her road of life from birth till <br />
death, reality could not touch her or her memories directly. This did however make <br />
adapting things much more trouble, she and Gill were alike in that way with their <br />
respective curses.  She wondered how long Trevor had left until his memories of his former <br />
life dissolved completely. <br />
<br />
"So many lions, so many naked bodies." Serenity said to herself, she had nothing personal <br />
against nudists, but the sheer number of naked people in the photo she knew were once <br />
humans was still shaking.  She saw one or two people she didn't recognize from the police <br />
station or Mary's family... she guessed the 'plague' was already spreading even with the <br />
majority currently 'quarantined' as they healed up.  She saw them dressed up in a few <br />
pictures, mostly formal ceremonies, (much like Smith manor looking ready to die of heat <br />
exhaustion in a graduation gown). And another naked save for a vest and sandals at a <br />
restaurant with a 'no shoes, no shirt, no service' policy, it was somewhat disorienting.  <br />
Another thing disorienting was how many was female. <br />
<br />
Trevor was a male and thus very precious to the pride. Being the only male of ten cubs <br />
made him even more precious.  The pack on the other hand had five males pups out of <br />
nineteen pups of the next generation. Given the unbalanced gender ratio, male births <br />
being precious and multiple mates was perhaps inevitable.<br />
<br />
There was picture with a gold star around it of Trevor's first baby picture. It was <br />
surrounded by a similar photo of -Mary- and eight other female cubs. Serenity was <br />
surprised to see photos of her in a family album of Trevor's family, she had no logical <br />
reason to be there. But there she was all the same. Serenity wondered almost what <br />
damaged this did to multiple family trees, except of course great-great-great <br />
grandparents were still human. <br />
<br />
Serenity actually gasped in shock in a faded black and white photo changed from a dirty <br />
man in a workers uniform with a pick axe changed to a naked but still dirty lion man <br />
holding a much larger pick axe. Serenity got a chilling feeling and put down the album (the <br />
rest of the family either outside or in their rooms) and using stealth born of two life times <br />
of detective work and found Trevor's little, now big sister Sabrina at her bed saying a <br />
prayer that included her great-great-great-great-grandfather. <br />
<br />
'At least that settles if they're life after death.' Serenity thought deadpan. 'I know <br />
technically this case is closed, after all, Trevor is back with his family and his death clock <br />
may or may not have been removed... I guess I should just try to relax for a couple of days <br />
and put my alchemy to good use to make enough of the cure to dump into the city water <br />
supply... hopefully the million 'Transform or Dares' people witnessed will be enough for <br />
City Hall to accept that they can't pretend the curse doesn't exist and perhaps something <br />
can be, have to be, done about it. <br />
<br />

<br />
Mother Glen easily tracked Penny's scent to Kirk's home, her sense of smell was so precise <br />
some figured it must have driven her mad from the input, except her brain seemed <br />
perfectly able to handle it. What honestly SCARED most people was how shoulder height <br />
was enough was to push the button on the crosswalk. <br />
<br />
The average female lioness was three and a half feet tall on all fours, Mother Glen, was <br />
monstrously larger (as larger from a normal lioness as Mr P. was from a mundane wolf). <br />
Many wondered how she managed to feed herself without wiping out populations. In spite <br />
of such fears and having evolved from a species that ate it's own young (something they <br />
themselves had abandoned some time before the first century), the leomen proved to be <br />
quite civilized right down to a person. <br />
<br />
Mother Glen glanced at a store selling wigs, rather amused, even after all these years she <br />
still found it funny how human women wanted to have 'manes' like males. Some wolves had <br />
hair, others didn't. But all the lionesses were 'balled.' She had left some confused lion cubs <br />
on occasion addressing a she-wolf or human woman as 'Mr' seeing their long hair and <br />
thinking 'mane.' <br />
<br />
Everyone politely parted ways for the Pride matriarch. Mother Glen commanded respect just <br />
as Jesen and Kaylee were alphas of the pack but Mr. P still commanded much respect in <br />
spite of his bizarre four legged status (Jasmine swore she heard both occasionally speaking <br />
casually to the Herd between hunts about daily trivialities). Some wondered if they were <br />
evolutionary throw packs or some magically induced mutants, but whatever the case, the <br />
power they held sway over their respective super families and thus resources made even <br />
lawyers quake in their shoes. <br />
<br />
When she made to Kirk's family home, some cats cowered before her, some dogs fled in <br />
terror of her, but she for her part simply reached with her right forepaw and rang the <br />
doorbell.<br />
<br />
Jeff opened the door (it was the male's duty to protect territory after all) and immediately <br />
bowered his head and bow low till he was looking at the ground, "Mother Glen, it's an <br />
honor for you to visit one of your homes." <br />
<br />
"My face is up here."<br />
<br />
"Yes Mother Glen." The leoman looked up into her eyes, almost entranced by her sheer <br />
presence. <br />
<br />
For great cats, it was out with the old, in with the new, the elderly extra weight... <br />
apparently somewhere along the lines of evolution these lions had learned from the apes.  <br />
<br />
"Announce me."<br />
<br />
"Yes Mother Glen." Jeff then turned and shouted, "Honey! Son! Penny! Mother Glen is here!"<br />
<br />
Gloria came in at once and bowed her head, Kirk followed, and started at what he saw. <br />
Penny wheeled in her wheel chair, wonder what the fuss way. She started complete and her <br />
jaw hanged open at what she saw.<br />
<br />
'Impossible, is that-'<br />
<br />
"Penny, my sweet girl, what happened to you?" The giant snow white lioness asked coming <br />
closer to the wheelchair bound naked pale almost white beige lion woman. <br />
<br />
"I had a fight with---" Penny and Kirk were both so far unaffected by the changes in <br />
reality, being so far away from the rest of the pride and pack, so Penny had to think about <br />
what to say, "--police business."<br />
<br />
"Is that so." Her grandmother, or the giant lioness she was pretty sure could be her <br />
grandmother said calmly, "So Kirk... I see you're yourself again... how did that miracle <br />
happen?" <br />
<br />
Kirk looked at himself, 'himself?' Should that be 'herself?' Getting used to having that <br />
THING between his legs and missing some companions on top was going to (or so he <br />
thought) take some getting used to.  "That's... a secret." He said not sure what he could say <br />
that wouldn't come across being crazy right now.<br />
<br />
"PLEASE tell me you've already booked the church this time."<br />
<br />
Penny responded without thinking, "AFTER I'm out of the wheelchair... I... I want to.... I <br />
want to WALK down the isle," Being the bride opposed to the groom, Penny (or so she <br />
thought) wondered how she'd deal with that. <br />
<br />
"I could carry you." Mother Glen said simply.<br />
<br />
"No." Penny said a moment after realizing her grandmother wasn't kidding.  Where those <br />
'tattoos' on her -grandmother-? How could you even HAVE tattoos on fur-?! <br />
<br />
"As you wish dear. ..." She sniffed, "Where are Sonia and my son?"<br />
<br />
"I... haven't told them yet." Penny admitted meekly.<br />
<br />
"And why not?"<br />
<br />
"I-I-" Just looking into those brownish red eyes made Penny feel confused and small, that <br />
much of her grandmother hadn't changed in the least. "Just wanted to hold off on telling <br />
them because so much of the pride is hurt that I didn't want things to get more confusing <br />
and complicated!"<br />
<br />
"I see." Mother Glen said in that same calm tone. "I'll just have to call them myself then, <br />
then we'll have a nice chat."<br />
<br />
"WHAT?!" Penny -really- really really really wished her wish didn't get MORE complicated <br />
and confusing and overtly complex than it already was!~!!! <br />
<br />
++++++++      <br />
<br />
With the tri-shiva wolves Joy and Ingrid helping Beta-Julie with the recovering pack and <br />
pride (and needing every bit of help they could get as attendants fell asleep from <br />
exhaustion much as Fran had),  Martha and her three males and other female were in the <br />
Omega's quarters that had grown in size and shape, like many rooms in the house lately <br />
though none save maybe Amy noticed to include a few more beds. A few more, not six <br />
more. <br />
<br />
Martha lay among the three males like her, their solid color eyes looked upon each other as <br />
those they had known for years. <br />
<br />
Zelipe couldn't help but notice, being still vaguely aware the shadows had been humans <br />
before due to his own power having been used to alter three of them, that the coloring of <br />
the highlights of the shiva bore resemblance to that of the gem twin wolves... could it <br />
really be? But Martha was Omega the one who never bred... as were apparently the other <br />
shiva wolves. As a bit of irony, the term shiva itself supposedly represented a male entity, <br />
but western pop culture depicted it as a female. <br />
<br />
Martha sat 'among' her the three males like her,  Much like Kaylee and her 'chair' (Kaylee <br />
was no longer spiraling into alcoholism as she was in the original timeline after her <br />
transformation, but she was still fully enjoying the privileges that came with being the <br />
head of a super family like the pack).  Kaylee's three sisters accepted this much as Megan <br />
and Margot got the idea by themselves to make themselves into frozen yet living stone <br />
statue as a birthday gift to their Alpha. Though Kaylee now didn't try to humiliate her <br />
sisters through it nor did she rub it in their faces. <br />
<br />
They still however, had the power of their moonlit dance a power they would logically have <br />
if they were the same as Martha, though if reality had always been for Zelipe, the Glass <br />
pups, and Martha's kind, how did they know their power could transform non-wolves into <br />
more of their kind and an 'instant loyalty' to boot that was -supposedly- removed by Amy <br />
and likely reality still hadn't finished extracting the price of such cheating for yet. They had <br />
all seen the price Kurse had played for cheating... reality had no sense of good or evil, it <br />
would not give a slap on the rest to someone else just cause their cause and results were <br />
more selfless.<br />
<br />
Ingrid and Joy had a strange form of 'collation' awareness between each of their three <br />
heads, meaning each head had a separate brain wired to the other two each capable of <br />
seemingly of following a separate trail of thought though all three responded to the same <br />
name (did that make them separately J, O, Y, and In, Gr, Id?).  On the other hand each of <br />
Martha, Maddex and Ryan's two head had the same brain controlling two heads. <br />
<br />
Whitney and Adul on the other hand unlike the other five shiva wolves had only one head, <br />
making them seem strangely out of place among their fellow mutants. Abdul was even <br />
odder in that he didn't have four arms, though he still had an extra something in addition <br />
to his extra tail like all the male shiva wolves did. <br />
<br />
Martha's bed became almost like a chair made of giant pillows, Maddex on her left, Ryan <br />
on her right, both playing with two of her arms and one of her heads, while Abdul lay in <br />
her lab almost on top of her. Almost. Martha had had a very tiring day, and her loyalty and <br />
devotion to the pups was still as strong as steel and unbreakable and unquestionable and <br />
she still lived solely to attend to the pups when Alpha Female Kaylee could not see to her <br />
own pups. But now, duty, wasn't the only thing she lived for.<br />
<br />
"Whitney." <br />
<br />
"Yes Madam Martha?" The silver with red-orange highlights made a mime curtsey with two <br />
of her arms putting the two two together as she bowed her one head and her tails lowered <br />
behind her. Martha's third eyes on her with two were on Abdul and one each on Maddex <br />
and Ryan. <br />
<br />
"Please Take Master Zelipe and find Mistress Amy, with many injured in our house we can <br />
not be sure they will all be housed in the medical wing, while I trust in Mistress Amy it is <br />
best to still too keep an eye on her, she is spiritually aware and the ordeal may have had <br />
unforeseen side effects on her, it our duty to Master Zackery and Mistress June to see after <br />
her even as Madam Amethyst is looking after the gem twins."<br />
<br />
"Of course Madam Martha... please come along Master Zelipe."<br />
<br />
Zelipe, while very curious about what was about to likely happen next, he also realized he <br />
was very worried about his sister just leaving the way she did, she also looked like she was <br />
about to cry. As it was, he let Whitney lead him out of the Omega's chambers, and Martha <br />
DARED allowed herself a short while to enjoy herself with her males. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
That the glass pups couldn't be harmed in the outside world left some debate if the girls <br />
COULD get sick or weather they should be injected with vaccines in the mirror world, and <br />
weather they should be injected from the outside world, or be injected with a reflection of <br />
it so it turned to glass like they were in the world outside the mirror. So far the girls were <br />
healthy enough, but the triplets like any concerned mother wanted such questions <br />
answered fast. So naturally, things fell upon Julie, as the pack's doctor. She didn't want to <br />
experiment on her own family... but upon learning about glass Marie, she hoped the girl's <br />
mother could provide some health tips on how to give vaccine to her own child and nieces. <br />
However right now the mangled pack and pride took top priority, much like the surgery on <br />
the Japanese wolves had been put on the temporary back burner.  <br />
<br />
The wolves healing from the very costly battle on Big Island with alter-stabs, bruises, and <br />
broken bones aplenty were Yomato, Chiyoye (who had to lay on he back and have support <br />
for her much extra biologically impossible chest weight that were bigger than her pillow!), <br />
Zack, June, Hope, Grace, Isebelle, Megan, Margot, Ashley. Alexandra, Nicole. Millie.<br />
<br />
And that wasn't counting the pride who had been gored, mangled, impaled, mutilated, <br />
vivisected, and violated for the sake of innocent lives at stake as was their duty as police <br />
and being the danger to them had come from their home of Glendale... the fact the lions <br />
had been more injured in spite of it not being -their- war had not been lost on the wolves <br />
at all. <br />
<br />
The lupmens were taller than almost any human, and the leomens were larger than almost <br />
any lupman, and the gargoyles themselves were still a fantastically monstrous size in <br />
comparison!  Maybe it was a blessing that gargoyles in spite of their fantastically small <br />
population -didn't- eat, Lupmen and Leomen required impressive almost startling <br />
amounts of protein themselves as it was. <br />
<br />
Leomen males were eleven foot tall while females were a nine foot tall, Jensen, the tallest <br />
of the pack, on the other hand was nine feet tall and Kaylee seven feet tall. Was it any <br />
wonder their children of both species were taller than the average human child of the same <br />
age?  This was one of the reason Jensen preferred home schooling and the pride was on <br />
the fence on weather it was a good idea or not. <br />
<br />
Thankfully for reality all the injuries received by Nicole's assault team against the Hardys <br />
could be easily handed over to the chimeras, who realistically shouldn't have been push <br />
overs like that anyhow.  The one exception of course being Lawrence's dislocated arm due <br />
to being on the island at the time since reality seemed for some unknown reason unable to <br />
undo injuries. <br />
<br />
Thus also on the mend to varying lengths though not quite as brutal were: Nick,  Roger <br />
(who had lost his eye during a scuffle between Jay and Pence which he had shown <br />
surprising restraint himself though the boys had been spanked until their hide was as red <br />
as their fur), Sarah, and would have included Ulysses if he was not busy on Big Bad Island <br />
(who had a few bruises apparently from rough housing with Mary in this timeline). <br />
<br />
Of course, in their broken shape, neither Megan nor Margot were in a position to offer up <br />
their birthday present to Alpha Female Kaylee, and likely the town could be de-cursed by <br />
the time they considered themselves presentable to their Alpha Female again as eternal <br />
witnesses. <br />
<br />
The entire police pack was there healing, save for Penny who was wheel chair bound at her <br />
own home, and Kirk who had not taken part in the battle being with Penny waiting on the <br />
news of the surgery to put her legs back together. <br />
<br />
There WAS one hidden blessing to all this insanity, the members of the pride who had <br />
spent years, decades and (in Miss Armisael's and possible Miss Mal'akh's case) centuries as <br />
pieces of art, could now FINALLY after the insanity had calmed down begin reading on what <br />
they had missed. Mal'akh was stunned at how large the united states was now. Armisael on <br />
the other hand was just plain impressed, but what shocked her to the core was the news <br />
about the civil war, and two WORLD WARS! And of course Armisael was very confused on <br />
how there now seemed to be only two political parties from what she could gather. <br />
<br />
Mal'akh threw up reading the part on the Holocaust and prayed it was just some sick joke <br />
by one the nurses but no avail, Mal'Akh began to wonder if the devil really was Hell bent on <br />
seeing the Jewish people vanished from the face of the Earth after all. <br />
<br />
The chapter on the moon landing had sent nearly all the former statue lions for a loop. <br />
<br />
Arael seemed to take it all with a great deal more stride... either that or she was just very <br />
very good at hiding her emotions. <br />
<br />
Gabriel was actually requesting old NEWS PAPERS, apparently trying to track down members <br />
of his family still around if any... All four of them were strangers in a strange land after all, <br />
they and the gallery wolves had that in common, after all, they had been sharing the same <br />
room non-stop for centuries for some of them, they couldn't HELP but feel a strange sense <br />
of brotherhood. <br />
<br />
On the roof Amy looked up from what she had just written. <br />
<br />
'Even in the new timeline the pack members were still restored from statues by my power <br />
and Zel-Kun's...but we could never ever free the lions... they'd have becomes wolves no <br />
matter what... and Penny was the one there... but the rules of the game precisely say the <br />
person had to SPEAK not think or write, SPEAK a reply to the game, and HAS to be able to <br />
SPEAK when asked the question or the turn is wasted and deemed invalid because it was <br />
one of the few things that you -couldn't- cheat the game on.  Does this mean... Penny-San <br />
now has the same power except for lions instead of for wolves like myself and Zel-Kun? <br />
The power of love transformation is something the lions are becoming oblivious to <br />
themselves... so it can't be that. But that would mean Penny-San would have had to used <br />
her power to realize she had it... even if the quadruplets had sensed she had magic, like I <br />
do and the shivas do... Penny would have used it before that to save Kirk-san... or rather <br />
Kathy-chan when Kirk-san was still female before reality shifted... ' Amy wondered about <br />
asking the wolf pup glass Marie she didn't know.  But thought that if Penny-San did have <br />
that sort of power, she didn't seem the kind to abuse it... besides... there would be enough <br />
lions to think about soon enough... <br />
<br />
"MISTRESS AMY GET DOWN FROM THERE THIS INSTANT!"<br />
<br />
Amy sighed and looked down to see Whitney-San with her brother waving her arms at her. <br />
<br />
"Coming." She said in an even voice, taking her scroll written in her own blood with her <br />
making very sure it was dry and secure first. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Mary after returning from the visit to Big Bad Island and hugging her half sisters and tried <br />
to stay with her mother and father but had been pushed out by the shiva nurses politely <br />
but firmly. They needed all the space they could get and couldn't afford to have Mary <br />
underfoot. When she tried to explain her knowledge in animal medicine (and thus wolves <br />
and lions) she had been brushed off, no one had listened to her. <br />
<br />
'You think with super smart kids like Bart and Jenny they'd believe me!' Mary thought very <br />
frustrated and agitated. For now, Mary remembered both reality, though her existence as a <br />
teenage human was now like a dream she had woken up from. <br />
<br />
Mary had another problem... school... with the chaos of Kurse there had been a liable <br />
excuse and of course there was the gruesome mangling of most of Mary's pride.  The pride <br />
of course would be on the mend for more than a day. <br />
It wasn't like she could go home by herself now being eight 'If that's still my home and the <br />
pride isn't going to turn into a nudist commune like the pack is.' <br />
<br />
As it was, Mary it seemed was destine to simply sleep in one of the room of the big bad <br />
wolf pack's manor, (which scared her knowing how much she'd likely never remember <br />
again once she took that rest) and get up, and ask of the pack or call one of her family's <br />
friends if they could take her to school... to see the friends she knew she had never met <br />
but her second set of memories devouring her old memories told her had been her buddies <br />
since first grade and thought she was really really cool for knowing so much about how to <br />
help pets and even setting the bone of the broken leg of one of her friend's kitties... and <br />
the friends she KNEW were supposed to be her friends but now had never met. Even if she <br />
convinced her parents to skip some grades.. her chances of meeting them again were slim <br />
to none.. it just wasn't fair. <br />
<br />
Mary as it was wandered from room to room, observing the soap opera like goings on <br />
inside the giant house (humongous by human terms) the doorless rooms giving her a clear <br />
view, it seemed the wolves had little to no sense of privacy. "Then again they walk around <br />
naked, what does privacy have to do with anything they do? What am I saying? I'm naked <br />
too now." Mary looked down at her naked furry body, the same colored fur as her parents. <br />
Had it really been the curse, or just the impulses of a selfish child that had inspired her to <br />
start the entire pride? Yes... The pride was, for all intents and purposes her creation, that <br />
maniac monster with a face to match his inside may have turned her into this... but she had <br />
helped it along.. not that she had much choice when the wolf pack had been bearing down <br />
on them to turn them into brainwashed devoted loving slaves of the Big Bad Wolf Jensen <br />
himself and Trevor had bought them the precious time they needed to save themselves via <br />
the game.<br />
<br />
"And now none of that happened, Trevor was braver than a adult of adult men I know... <br />
and no one is going to remember it, not me, not him...." Mary sighed as she continued her <br />
aimless wandering through the mansion, her ears perking the sound of laughter outside of <br />
the girls she remembered being her half-sisters, and not being the least ashamed of her <br />
father having mated with another female and thinking of Elise herself as a second mother. <br />
<br />
Ironically, on her first day back at school, a little boy named Billy would tell Mary she was <br />
very pretty, she would kill on the check telling him he was nice to say that, and Billy's <br />
clothes would dissolve turning into shorts, then underwear, then nothing, becoming a <br />
bright orange lion boy with no sense of shame or modesty who'd go on to tell his parents <br />
about a girl kissing him that would transform them, and so it would cascade also with the <br />
pack's own loved ones. <br />
<br />
Even then though, both Alice and Marie had figured it would take over a thousand years for <br />
the complete conversion of the human race even if the power was inherited and did NOT <br />
die out with the first generation or second generation. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen and Kaylee, the alphas of the Big Bad Wolf pack named after a less than honorable <br />
ancestor and possibly mythical sleep in the gigantic and grandiose decorated master <br />
bedroom recovering from the ordeal of the battle of Big Bad Island. <br />
<br />
Fran slept where she had laid down, her fur keeping her warm as her triplets Darla and <br />
Julie sensing her dreams, and finding the image of one of them just being a stranger and <br />
two of them being husband and wife just plain weird and very unappealing. <br />
<br />
Mr. P found Chester pigging out in the meat locker and sent the tiny dog out, and then <br />
went outside himself only to get soaked in the cross fire as Chester had a moment before <br />
from the water games. <br />
<br />
Martha in her quarters right next to the cub's bedroom enjoyed a moment's rest and the <br />
pleasurable company of her males Maddex, Ryan and Abdul. <br />
<br />
The tri-shivas Ingrid and Joy worked tirelessly but happily and dauntless to look after the <br />
brave wolves and lions who had distracted Kurse long enough to save the twins and <br />
passengers, along with those who had defended the mansion fro the deadly Chimeras. <br />
<br />
Whitney was besides herself trying to figure out how Mistress Amy had gotten up there to <br />
begin with while Zelipe simply silently watched his sister. The little white wolf whose red <br />
marks looked brush strokes holding her normal calm but serene demeanor. <br />
<br />
Bart, Jenny, Kevin and Marcy, the pubs of Kaylee and Jensen, slept silently sleeping the time <br />
away, perhaps for the better giving the chaos and confusion around them. Pretty much NO <br />
ONE WHAT SO EVER, had gotten a wink of sleep last night after the all day (and thus all <br />
night in Glendale) battle on Big Bad Island. <br />
<br />
Gill himself was sleeping a entire all-nighter from dusk till dawn on the events around Big <br />
Bad Island the mutation of so many of his men via the curse... just being glade the priest <br />
brothers had the spark of intelligence to finally bring their rediscovered cure foreword to <br />
end the evil thing once and for all. He drank some scotch he had been saving. <br />
<br />
Roger, not as badly hurt as others, had helped in spite of the protests of Fran, and had <br />
finally to his room and fallen asleep even before he had hit the bed, rather selfless <br />
consider besides the gallery wolves he was the only one whose mates hadn't been harmed <br />
technically from the whole conflict, his precious Amethyst being apparently unharmed from <br />
her ordeal with Kurse... that purple colored woman was like tempered STEEL surrounded by <br />
cotton-candy. <br />
<br />
Pearl, Beatrice, Anne, Terri, Jasmine, Akane, Umeko, Eri, were practically mindless drones <br />
as the triplets and the nurses simply told them what to do, having gone so long her upper <br />
brain functions had nearly shut off and now simply did as they were told almost like <br />
robots, but they endured and pressed on, these were their mates and sister-wives after all! <br />
<br />
Alexandra stayed silent, her sense of duty to heal as quickly as possible to once again <br />
serve Master Jensen remaining as strong as iron no matter what changes to reality might <br />
happen. Nicole failed in her latest attempt to escape her hospital bed. Nick enjoyed the <br />
sight. Isabelle simply chatted with her sisters, they may not have the same mate, but they <br />
were still siblings after all, one could have more than ONE bound after all. <br />
<br />
Pearl assured Zack and June that their children were okay (yes, THEIR children, even if Amy <br />
was related to Pearl by blood she was still Zackery's child and that was good enough for <br />
Pearl even if the four of them were a mix of different theologies). <br />
<br />
Chiyoye endured as a ninja would, as did Yamato, as a samurai would, their heritages <br />
being a rather large irony since ninjas and samurai had actually been NATURAL enemies <br />
when they had been prevalent in Japan due to opposing origins, places in culture, <br />
methods, and goals. <br />
<br />
Millie just sat and read the comics that felt natural for the new teenage wolf to read... her <br />
time as an adult male human feeling more and more like some odd fantasy as much as <br />
being an adult wolf woman wondering if Maxine and Robyn had it easier where they were. <br />
<br />
Robert, along with Wendy, Jessica, and Rose gave a big sigh of relief as the final buck was <br />
bought into the mirror world... now came the does... they weren't sure if that was going to <br />
be harder or easier. <br />
<br />
Betty, her (now regretfully muscular like Roger) nephew Lawrence, and the twins Casandra <br />
and Lilly listened intently to the blond and blue eyed (but not the same as Alice and her <br />
siblings though she wore a re-coloring of their dress) Marie's tale, in the world within <br />
mirrors inside now the living room reflection of the mansion (missing the giant bronze <br />
statue she-wolf due to it never being reflected). <br />
<br />
Ulysses, Robyn, Maxine, Coral, Amber, Tourmaline, Opal, Caroline/Cobalt (some whispered <br />
she had a split personality but nothing was proven), Ruby, Emerald and Garnet did her best <br />
to appear non-hostile to the does now that bucks were gone... <br />
<br />
Trinity and Kimberly bumped into each other, the two single gallery wolves quickly drafted <br />
into helping out the very injured wolf pack and pride. Maybe a hospital might have been <br />
more logical, but Julie was as good as they came and was specialized in their kind, and <br />
most o them were in no shape to be moved (in spite of Nicole's protests otherwise.... she <br />
had thrown a fit when she though her red ribbon around her ear was lost until Nick found <br />
it.. she fell in love with him all over again after that). Kimberly picking up the nurses' <br />
instructions with amazing quickness. Trinity wished that five the gallery wolves hadn't <br />
chosen to chicken out on life! <br />
<br />
Luna and Sunny were now working the kitchen, trying to figure out which members of the <br />
pack and pride didn't need to eat through a straw for a while.. finding Chester's thievery <br />
gave the two newest members of the pack another headache. <br />
<br />
As for Sarah, she had fallen asleep on her feet and still standing up. Beatrice had been the <br />
one to take her to her room after realizing she wasn't just standing around thinking about <br />
her adopted younger brother again. Her talent at healing the mind would have to come <br />
after the triplets and nurses had finished patching up the bodies. <br />
<br />
As Mbili and Toni continued to splash each other playfully in the fountain (the closet thing <br />
the pack had to a pool) the water war continued between lion and wolf while Paula and <br />
Saba continued their self taught one-on-one wresting game. <br />
<br />
The sides even with Jay, Pence, Giselle Gretchen, Laura  and Zulema  on one side ; and <br />
Moja, Tatuli, Neli, Tano, Sita, and Nane on the other. <br />
<br />
Kira seemed content to be where she was right now, even if all the action was happening <br />
in the medical wing, she didn't feel like moving and likely being caught while a non-statue <br />
and being impressed into service. A bit selfish maybe, but she never claimed to be perfect. <br />
<br />
Michelle on the other hand snuck into the medical wing with no one noticing her,  and <br />
assumed a yoga pose on a table, and became a glass orange red swirl colored statue about <br />
one third to scale... and began to sooth the nightmares and dreams of those recovering as <br />
they rested as her mind reached out. She had made her choice on what she was, but that <br />
didn't mean she couldn't contribute. <br />
<br />
Leslie, Helen, and Nelson on the other hand just observed the pup and cub in their basin <br />
with amusement, adjusting their spray ever so sublime to hit them on occasion to have <br />
their own fun as they had theirs. <br />
<br />
Gary, and Brian as they recovered mourned the loss of their mates, even if Elise was not <br />
Brian's prime mate, she was still the mother of his children as Felicity was (who had come <br />
to see Elise as a sister-wife). All however, did have a dream of Elise and Fox telling them <br />
that through their children, they would always be with their prime mates. <br />
<br />
Arael, Armisael, Mal'akh, and Gabriel spoke to each over about the changes in the world <br />
since they statue-hood and not knowing much beyond the gallery's walls. All hoped their <br />
statue-mate Kirk was okay, and through him, Penny as well, none of them had heard word <br />
if the operation had been successful or not yet. <br />
<br />
The lioness Sasha, wished that she could fall asleep as easily Sarah had, but in spite of <br />
herself all she could due was stared at the ceiling unable to concentrate to boot. <br />
<br />
Mary attract by the noise (in spite of being tired herself), saw the water war, noticed Toni <br />
and Mbili's discard squirt guns both still somewhat loaded, and joined in the havoc <br />
wielding duel pistols, knowing she had nothing left to lose. <br />
<br />
Mother Glen lounged in the den, a spot like in all the houses that pride own set aside <br />
purely on the off chance she'd visit, satisfied when Penny's parents finally arrived. Kirk <br />
looked at Penny in her wheel chair who looked back, both still aware of the mutation about <br />
to be visited upon Penny's parents but knowing there was no way around it and prepared <br />
to take their last good look at them as humans (ironically, Penny realized that she HOPED <br />
her parents mutated... if they didn't, it meant either she didn't really love them, or they <br />
didn't really love her...) <br />
<br />
Kirk's parents Jeff and Gloria greeted Penny's parents with perfect politeness as the for the <br />
moment humans didn't even so much as blink oddly as the naked giant lion people who <br />
claimed to be 'Kathy's' parents. <br />
<br />
Jacob and Marie were very quickly restoring Trevor's room, they couldn't leave it precise as <br />
he had left it, they did have that dang moth problem! As for Trevor... he was playing catch <br />
up with his sister... via Smash Brothers on the Wii... and managed to prove he still had it! ... <br />
Sarbina 'Nala' added shyly if only he could do that good in the pack pride pub/cub smash <br />
tournament... <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity looked up from her research and smiled, 'At least they're happy....' <br />
<br />
The golden beige lioness Bobbi, her memory of being a male human Bob fading like a <br />
dream, but still having been cursed to do... some rather unpleasant things via the game <br />
and having used it curse a serial kidnapper who had gotten off due to the court ignoring <br />
the existence of the game still hard in her memory. 'Gotta learn to think before acting <br />
girl... That's how you missed out on being Gary's prime...' <br />
<br />
Bernie thought as she turned on her stomach to led the very painful disinfectant to be <br />
applied to the giant claw marks on her back again, 'OW! UGH! Maybe if I had been in just a <br />
tiny better shape I wouldn't be in this sorry state.' She really did need to join the other <br />
lionesses in hunting more often then just going out... hunting was her duty as a lioness <br />
after all... <br />
<br />
The white and gold highlights lioness MJ did her best just to SLEEP. She needed, heck, the <br />
all needed it, and it was less annoying than the Spider-Man comics she kept getting <br />
handed (which she actually hated way too depressing, she preferred Avengers featuring the <br />
Scarlet Witch). It almost made her wish her mother had named her Wanda instead of her <br />
teammate....<br />
<br />
Lexi's dark gold fur barely showed the blood, making cleaning a somewhat harder task for <br />
her. Of course, like all the lionesses, they had to resist the urge to clean THEMSELVES, <br />
which would only lead to more trouble, and while they had no animosity with her  and the <br />
pack (the fact they had been created to counter them dissolving in their minds) leaving <br />
themselves vulnerable like this.... wasn't exactly something that they had much choice in <br />
right now anyway.  'Maybe we SHOULD have started carrying guns after all... even if it <br />
would have been just uber tranquilizers this trip...after this, I don't think criminal will be as <br />
psychologically weak against us if word about us getting mangled like this gets out...' Duty <br />
came before everything after all... maybe she should try to chat with that Alexandra girl. <br />
<br />
Nilie's yellowish beige fur was brown and red when she had been brought in she was so <br />
covered in blood (about half of it her own), MJ said she had gone bonkers and nearly <br />
suicidal in her attacks after Fox and Elise had apparently been killed. Then again, Nillie had <br />
never taken loss all that well, she had been proud of how she had never lost anyone on any <br />
job or mission... now that record was broken forever... <br />
<br />
<br />
The beige/brown lioness whose name was also Megan was out of the natural curiosity that <br />
came with being a cat (making her think Alice and her sisters should have been born <br />
females) and when two such people meet, began striking up a discussion with the pastel <br />
green wolf Megan... it surprised the lioness how Megan was perfectly willing to turn herself <br />
into a piece of rock just as a gift to her alpha female and STILL loved her brother just as she <br />
loved her mate the intellectual Lawrence. She actually blamed herself for not helping them <br />
through their feelings of inadequacies apparently and just letting them think muscles made <br />
them more worthy as wolves... 'At least that girl Sarah doesn't try to pass herself as a <br />
LICENSED psychiatrist..' The Megan lioness thought. <br />
<br />
The lioness Wanda whose fur was light and dark red, 'And mother said I was crazy for <br />
studying the occult... so all the magic books I bought turned out to be meaningless <br />
garbage, and my mother began wishing she had named me Lisa instead after my -other- <br />
grandma... but at least after all this, no one's going to doubt or pretend the game doesn't <br />
exist ever again...'</p>
