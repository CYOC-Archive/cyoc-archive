<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashton&#39;s little brother Nate becomes a BIG brother<br />
<br />
<br />
Several hours had past since the foursome arrived at the beach. Ty made it so that no matter how long they were exposed to the sun&#39;s harmful rays they would never burn. Dustin and Nate continued to dive into the surf after a wayward toss of the Frisbee. Their bodies now possessed all over tans of a golden brown. A few yards from the water their friends, Ty and Ashton, were lying down on a beach towel and worked on their tans. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nate had to jump up and swim around a few times in order to get the high-flying Frisbee from Dustin, who was about the same height as him now, but he managed and enjoyed being a tall kid. <br />
<br />
“I know! I’m kinda getting used to being this tall!” Nate grinned. “Being this big is wearing me out.  I need to go  sit down for a few minutes.”  <br />
<br />
Just as Nate got to his beach towel Ashton got up and headed for the water, leaving Nate behind with just Ty. “Hey Dustin, stay there, it&#39;s my turn for a game of Toss and Dive.”<br />
<br />
Nate sat down on the towel next to Ty, who had just turned around. Ty was laying on his stomach now. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Ty! You’re really getting a suntan, bro!” Nate noticed, as he sat down next to his friend. <br />
<br />
“Yeah! I can feel it, too! I need some more lotion on my back!” Ty sighed. <br />
<br />
“I’ll get it for you, Ty!” Nate said, as he grabbed the bottle and poured some lotion on his hands before rubbing his hands across Ty’s back. ”I really wanted to thank you for making me tall like this!” <br />
<br />
“Oh, no problem, Nate! You look really cool being so tall!” Ty replied. <br />
<br />
“You know what? I’m the exact same height as Dustin is, right now!” Nate grinned. <br />
<br />
“Hah! Yeah! But, you’re only twelve years-old!” Ty added. “I bet that makes Dustin a little uncomfortable!” <br />
<br />
“Yeah! But it feels so good being so tall! Gosh, Ty, I wish you could make me bigger…” Nate sighed. <br />
<br />
“Oh, I can make you bigger! Easy! But Ashton might not be so happy about it!” Ty mumbled. <br />
<br />
“Awww… Ty! I don&#39;t mean taller… Could you just make me bigger? Until Ashton sees me? And shrink me back later, if Ashton complains about it? Nate pleaded with Ty. <br />
<br />
Just then Nate had finished rubbing lotion across Ty’s back. <br />
<br />
Ty carefully and slowly stood up. Nate did the same. Nate was already 6 inches taller than Ty by now. <br />
<br />
“Okay! So you want to be even taller than this? You’re already six-feet-tall! You’re gonna be one gigantic twelve-year-old kid!” Ty noted. <br />
<br />
“Aww! Please, Ty! I’m enjoying this tall but …. I want to be ‘bigger’.” Nate sighed as he held up his hands a few feet apart.<br />
<br />
“Dah!” Ty slapped his forehead with the palm of his hand. “I’ll grow you another twenty pounds heavier, but, that’s it!” Ty said in a stern tone of voice. “No twelve-year-old kid can be bigger than his big brother!” <br />
<br />
“That’s fine! I’ll take it!” <br />
<br />
Nate felt an intense tingling all over his body. His hands and feet began to grow bigger and wider while his legs stretched out and grew wider as well. His torso stretched sideways at the same time while his chest pushed outwards some more by a few inches. Every part of him just got bigger in proportion until he now weighed twenty pounds heavier ! The boy was a huge, muscular twelve-year-old!<br />
<br />
“Whoa!” Nate grinned, looking around the beach. He quickly realized that he was the biggest grade schooler kid on the entire beach… BY FAR! “This is… fantastic!” <br />
<br />
Just then, Dustin and Ashton came out of the water and walked back to where Ty was standing. Ashton’s jaw dropped when he noticed something strange about his “little” brother. <br />
<br />
“Hey, guys… WHOA! NATE!! What the hell happened to Nate??” Ashton gasped. “How did he get so BIG?” <br />
<br />
“Umm…” Ty sighed as he started to explain Nate’s growth spurt. “Well… Nate asked me to…” <br />
<br />
“I asked Ty to make me bigger!” Nate blurted out. “I wanted to be bigger so I asked him! What’s wrong about that?” <br />
<br />
Ashton walked up to Nate. Nate was now as big and muscular as Ashton. Nate’s board shorts had not grown bigger to accommodate his new body. The material  looked like it was painted on. Every bulge and crease was visible for “ALL” to see. Ashton could barely keep his eyes off his brother&#39;s waistline.  <br />
<br />
“NO WAY! No twelve-year-old kid can be THAT BIG! Nate’s a fuckn freak!” Ashton hissed. “You cannot be that big, bro! You’re gonna have to shrink back!” <br />
<br />
“Awww! Ty! Please don’t shrink me back! I’ll be a great big bro! I promise! I have ALWAYS been a good brother, haven’t I?” Nate pleaded with his smaller, older brother. “Come ON! Don’t ruin it for me!” <br />
<br />
Ty bowed his head and pondered the situation. Then he looked up and stared at Ashton. <br />
<br />
“What’s it gonna be, big bro?” Ty sighed. “Stay, or shrink?” <br />
<br />
“What? NOOOO! Don’t shrink me back! It’s not fair!!!” Nate cried out. <br />
<br />
Ashton walked up to Nate and studied his new, “big” little bro. He looked him over from head to toe. <br />
<br />
“Ohhh, Nate… You made a good point…. You’ve always been a great, little bro to me…” Ashton sighed. “It should be fun for me to be the little bro from now and to let YOU be the big bro, for a change…” <br />
<br />
“I’ll take care of you, Ashton! I’ll protect you and look out for you! I promise!” Nate added. <br />
<br />
“Wow! Alright! You’ll be the biggest twelve-year-old kid on the planet, but… I’ll get used to it!” Ashton mumbled before he turned towards Ty. “Okay Ty! Give him some more bigger shorts … And make it so he’s the older brother as well … for now.” <br />
<br />
“Okay! I wish for Nate to gain another five years of age … he will think that he has always been the big brother.” Ty wished. <br />
<br />
Right away, Nate’s muscles hardened and his arms, legs and chest filled out with more mature muscle. As he aged he became even stronger, as his legs grew thicker and wider while his arms thickened out as his chest grew a few inches wider and his pec-shelf stuck out three inches further from his torso. By now, Nate was truly a muscular older brother with the mature face to match . The geometric print of his tight boardshorts changed to a solid  black as they shrank down to a Speedos.<br />
<br />
“I wish for Nate to no longer be able to remember I have magical powers!” Ty wished. <br />
<br />
Nate felt a sharp tingling which came and went after a few seconds. <br />
<br />
“Aww! Ashton, what just happened?  The large, hulking boy reached down and put his hand on Ashton’s shoulder. The weight his huge hand gently gripping it enough without hurting him. <br />
<br />
“Wow! Nate is a older brother now!” Dustin added, looking the muscular kid up and down. <br />
<br />
Nate quickly regained his composer  and stood up and gave the entire beach his best Superman pose. “Well, let’s swim some more before we have to go home!” Nate noted, while looking at the time on the nearby clock tower. <br />
<br />
Dustin and Ashton went back into the ocean, tossing the Frisbee to each other. Nate moved his now much larger towel from under the umbrellas out into the sun. He laid on his stomach and put his head atop hi crossed arms.<br />
<br />
“Hey Ty, why don&#39;t you be a good to your friend&#39;s big brother and oil my back for me?” The question sounded more like an order than a request. <br />
<br />
Ty didn&#39;t  know why he was doing it but he was more than happy to comply.</p>
