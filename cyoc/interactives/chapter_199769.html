<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ralph was finally home, 2 months straight of ceaseless practice and training with his master had finally ended. He even felt proud enough over the results he managed to show to believe he&#39;d have a solid chance at becoming a blue-belt hunter, strong enough to defeat any low-level Youkai. Strong enough to have saved his sister on that day...<br />
<br />
Ralph shook his head, willing the bad thoughts away. No sense dwelling on the past, he managed to live and if he had anything to say about it he&#39;d make sure everyone could live without fear of inhuman creatures that defied nature with their existence even breathe their chi. Ralph sighed, looking up at the apartment complex he had lived in with his sister he took to walking to his apartment in a familiar path, inner eye held open as he could see the miasma of emotions that still lingered -probably from a party held here yesterday-, and his right hand still held his katana&#39;s sheath, its enchantments hiding it from the senses of both humans and Youkai with exception to other hunters.<br />
<br />
The journey upwards via the apartment stairs was calm and quiet, thankfully not the dead silence that many Youkai make, and Ralph got himself into a quiet rythm of walking up the stairs on the way to his apartment was was near the top. The rythmic sounds of his boots hitting the solid stairs for every step was satisfying and Ralph felt himself relax, oh how right his master was, he really could use a moment to truly relax, maybe even meditate some.<br />
<br />
however at that very moment, fate seemed to have had some kind of beef against Ralph as his inner eye suddenly alerted him to a presence uncomfortably close by. His body tensed for a fight right away as his head spun to his right to try and pinpoint the location of this presence, an act which gave Ralph a front-row seat to watch something *grow* right before his &#39;eye&#39;.<br />
<br />
What had been a indeterminably weak presence when he first &#39;spotted&#39; it, had rapidly grown, and with said growth Ralph was able to pinpoint its location much more accurately, what at first could have been a restless spirit somewhere to his right had rapidly become &#39;something powerful&#39; inside an apartment, about where the bedroom usually lay. Ralph blinked, confused over what he was &#39;seeing&#39;, he wasn&#39;t his master, and though he had plenty of practice &#39;seeing&#39; the presence of humans (and especially hunters) he didn&#39;t really have any experience sensing Youkai, or even &#39;normal&#39; supernatural creatures (except restless spirits, which he already knew how to handle). What he was seeing might well be a high-level youkai (in which case he really needed his master to come), some kind of ritual (whoever is performing it really wouldn&#39;t enjoy any interruptions), a supernatural being (his master really should be here for that) or a sorcerer unwinding the chains on their presence (really suspicious but hopefully not bad?). Anyway you cut it, whatever that presence belonged to, Ralph would probably be better off &#39;not&#39; trying to peek at them, but with how they were in the apartment directly beneath Ralphs made him really uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Wait, Ralph suddenly realized something, wasn&#39;t one of the guys who supposedly lived in this apartment supposedly a weirdo? Ralph shook his head, irrelevant. And thats when he noticed the emotional miasma the presence generated, seeing how it had quickly wafted through the entire apartment building, and became really surprised. Emotional miasma is the product of extreme sensations which usually radiate off a beings chi, for any meaningful miasma to generate it usually requires the contribution from *many* different beings or fewer, stronger beings, whatever this presence was, &#39;very strong being&#39; deffinitely applied and immediately removed the possibility of it being merely a &#39;ritual&#39; (though there exists emotional rituals).<br />
<br />
And suddenly Ralph became aware of just &#39;what&#39; emotion made up the miasma, the feeling of &#65352;&#65365;&#65358;&#65351;&#65349;&#65362;rammed him like a carcrash and made him instinctively assume a fighting position, left hand immediately gripping hold of his hunters katana as he channeled his chi throughout his body. He only became fully aware of what he was doing when he realized the sheer &#119845;&#119854;&#119852;&#119853; that layered the hunger, a realization that lead to an epiphany as he determined that whatever that is, hungered for pleasure, and not chi.<br />
<br />
Blinking, he let go of his katanas handle but kept his body reinforced as he stared at the apartment door, his inner eye still staring at the presence itself, watching it move as Ralph considered what to do in this situation, emminently aware of the things sheer presence as well as how &#39;raw&#39; it was (Usually high-level beings hunters really had to watch out for was those with a refined and dense presence, while it might be &#39;small&#39; their power usually was much higher compared to those with a &#39;raw&#39; presence, what Ralph was faced with here had a monstrously large presence that was basically entirely unconcentrated). <br />
<br />
Curiously, Ralph ended up deciding to get an idea of whether the presence belonged to a Youkai, a supernatural being or a sorcerer (As odd as it&#39;d be for a sorcerer to make *this much* miasma) and settled on ringing the bell for highest chance of success. If he could pretend to just be a nosy neighbor then he&#39;d probably not get in trouble? Ralph was uncharacteristically unsure with himself whether this was a good idea or not, yet was already on his way to go through with it as he walked up to the door to the apartment flat the presence was in, then he took a deep breath before firmly knocking on the door and took a step away.<br />
<br />
The presence didn&#39;t seem to react at first, before it moved out of the &#39;bedroom&#39; and through the apartment, clearly headed for the door, before stopping just short of the door, practically right in front of ralph, obscuring his inner eye with the sheer size of its presence. Ralphs heart was threatening to literally burst out as he internally admonished himself for how terrible an idea this was, the door unlocking threatened to make him faint in dreadful anticipation, and when it opened, his heart threatened to stop at the &#120476;&#120465;&#120462;&#120462;&#120475; &#120475;&#120462;&#120469;&#120466;&#120462;&#120463; he felt when the presence turned out to belong to a normal human male, it turned out to be a sorcerer after all.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
But, wait, no? <br />
<br />
Ralphs inner eye tingled and with a blink of his eyes did his relief choke and wither as he &#120164;&#120165;&#120146;&#120163;&#120150;&#120149; &#120146;&#120165; &#120164;&#120160;&#120158;&#120150;&#120165;&#120153;&#120154;&#120159;&#120152; &#120161;&#120163;&#120150;&#120165;&#120150;&#120159;&#120149;&#120154;&#120159;&#120152; &#120165;&#120160; &#120147;&#120150; &#120153;&#120166;&#120158;&#120146;&#120159;.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Mikatsuri meanwhile, was completely unaware of how much she stood out, not in the spiritual way at least. She mused and pondered over what to do while slowly caressing her shapely bod, letting tiny moans escape her gorgeus lips as she fantasized at how good this body would look getting fucked raw and viciously. An &quot;Oh yeah~&quot; squeaked from her lips as she gave her humongous milkmachines a good firm squeeze at the same time she fantasized about having them be groped by strong male hands while a thick juicy rod slid down her throat. She shivered in anticipation, oh she knew someone strong and handsome alright, though how to get him over here? Mikatsuri smiled wider, it&#39;d be much easier just to go over to him~, she let out a giggle as she pondered over how he&#39;d react to her in his living room completely nude.<br />
<br />
Then her dreams and fantasies halted as she heard three sharp knock on his apartment door amplified tenfold, the volume didn&#39;t bother her insomuch she realized she could her someones breath all the way from her bedroom. Blinking she sniffed the air, noticing how keen her sense of smell was too, aside from smelling the pure lust, musk, sweat, cum and pussyjuice from her transformation and masturbation session, she could also smell what she instinctively pegged as a well-built man with a hint of the &#39;exotic&#39;. Mikatsuri gave her lips a lick as she smirked at the prospect of a male stud having presented themself to her all on their own~.<br />
<br />
Eagerly Mikatsuri strutted down her apartment towards the door, delaying herself slightly to admire her sexy walk, eyeing her fat hips and jiggling bubble-butt sway left and right for eah step, and how her gigantic milkjugs bounced hypnotically and unrestricted to her every step. Had she known that merely walking enhanced her jawdropping beauty even further she would have taken a more roundabout path to her front door, as she felt a measure of dissatisfaction at arriving too soon in her opinion. Letting out a huff Mikatsuri listened past her door and felt a little taken aback by the rather aggressive sounding heartbeat behind it, in comparison her guests breath was much calmer despite her easily hearing how deep said breaths were.<br />
<br />
Mikatsuri simply shrugged, it could simply be that whoever-it-was felt quite stressed, in that case a good-old titjob was sure to relieve them. But before she opened the door and inevitably pounced on her guest (read; victim) she felt a part of her tug at the back of her mind. Pausing, Mikatsuri felt for the tugging, then allowed a look of surprise take over her delicately maternal face before it shifted to a mischievious smile. And with a flick of a tail she looked down and saw the body of Paul, of course she hadn&#39;t truly &#39;become&#39; paul, this was merely an illusion that to all others would truly seem like Paul. Bringing a lanky hand up she easily found her left breast and give a quick squeeze, elliciting a tiny masculine moan from her manly lips. Grinning, Mikatsuri took a second to make sure ‘Paul’ didn’t look off and unlocked the door.<br />
<br />
Opening it Mikatsuri was greeted by a young man who seemed to ooze ‘I work out’ with his well muscled body, combined with his wild black hair, sleeveless jacket and worn jeans painted a picture of a hard-working man well prepared for a fight. Immediately Mikatsuri had to keep ‘Paul’ from mirroring her look of utter lust and salivating at the prospect of him kneading her soft and puffy naughty-bits while simultaniously depositing load after load of baby-batter inside her wet and horny lips below.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; She eventually made ‘Paul’ say when she finally managed to regain presence of mind from her bout of lewd fantasy, becoming the first to say anything after an excruciatingly awkward silence since she opened the door.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile her guest appeared… at a loss for words it would seem, or thats what Mikatsuri assumed judging by his case of flopping mouth. Strange. What was also strange was this… ‘Smell’, Mikatsuri noticed from her guest. It wasn’t emotion, that she was certain of but it also wasn’t something ‘on him’. Mikatsuri pondered, there was something about the smell that felt… Tasty, like a delicious piece of cake, but also… Sturdy, solid like a brick, and also… Sharp, like the blade of a razor. Mikatsuri frowned with her fine and smooth brow at the strange ‘smell’ her guest had before shrugging her slim crimson-marked shoulders. Whatever it was, it probably wasn’t all that important compared to getting fucked silly and having her stomach bloated with hot jizz. Mikatsuri smiled, knowing she’d get what she wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; &#39;Paul&#39; asked the visitor while Mikatsuri fantasized being fucked. Though Ralph was unaware just &#39;what&#39; was masquarading as &#39;Paul&#39;, he did know that whatever it was &#120365;&#120374;&#120372;&#120373;&#120358;&#120357; &#120359;&#120368;&#120371; &#120361;&#120362;&#120366; very much, a fact that did not help his internal panic over how bad a plan this was and why he didn&#39;t even try making up a reason for disturbing Mikatsuri in the first place. And as his mind worked in overdrive in finding a way to salvage this mess or get the fuck out of here, the awkward situation neared a unseen deadline.<br />
<br />
And then someone would make a move...</p>
