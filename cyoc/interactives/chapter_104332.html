<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Martin was this close to letting Alyssa continue. But at the very last second, he leaned away from Alyssa’s advances. She didn’t seem to notice, and continued to grind her hips against Martin’s. <br />
<br />
“Alyssa… as much as I’d like to have that kind of relationship I can’t. I have my family to think about, and my job. And I promised Melissa to keep my nose clean.” Martin breathed. He could barely form the sentence. <br />
<br />
There wasn’t much blood going to his brain at the moment. It wasn’t really his choice to be so turned on, but he was. Who wouldn’t be with someone like Alyssa Cooper sitting on their lap? <br />
<br />
“You’re just playing hard to get aren’t you? And if you think your job is a turn off, it isn’t. I should have known you’d end up at the top of the food chain.” Alyssa crooned. She leaned closer, until Martin’s back was pressed against the back of his desk chair. <br />
<br />
Thankfully the wall kept them from falling over. Because one slip, and Martin was sure his penis would fly straight into Alyssa’s vagina. And if that happened, he knew very well he wouldn’t be able to stop himself. <br />
<br />
“I’m not cheating on my wife.” Martin said flatly. <br />
<br />
“Who said anything about cheating? I don’t mind sharing. Melissa must be quite a shark in bed if she landed you. I did tell her she could join if she was up to it.” Alyssa said, licking her lips at the thought of the three engaging each other. <br />
<br />
It made her all the more horny. Alyssa unbuttoned the rest of her jacket, and proceeded to rub her chest against Martin’s. <br />
<br />
“She doesn’t want to.” Martin said quickly, before escalated any further (pun intended). <br />
<br />
“Mmm?” Alyssa was too busy running her hands through Martin’s hair to hear what he said. <br />
<br />
“Melissa isn’t interested in having any sort of relationship with you. And guess what, neither am I.” Martin repeated, his tone getting a bit sharp. <br />
<br />
“Come again?” For whatever reason that snapped Alyssa back to reality. She sat back and looked at Martin. He was biting his lower lip, and averting his eyes from Alyssa’s half naked body. She slid back, Martin’s penis still between her legs. He shivered as her wet slit rubbed against his cock. <br />
<br />
If this were like the “old days” Martin would have just given in and told Alyssa to continue. But he kept thinking of Julie, and the poor example he’d set for her with his wandering eyes. And after talking to Evan, Martin was determined to set his daughter straight before she turned out worse than himself. He pushed Alyssa off his lap the rest of the way, and zipped his pants up. <br />
<br />
“Melissa is NOT that kind of woman. She’s given me a second chance to make things right, and I’m not about to waste that chance. I want a clean slate with my WIFE. And you are not her. I’m sorry Alyssa, but I’m not interested. I don’t know how else to say it.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, what do you mean ‘make things right’? What’d you do?” Alyssa asked. <br />
<br />
Martin couldn’t believe how thick Alyssa was. She must know that she wasn’t, isn’t, the first girl Martin’s had an affair with. He does have a reputation in both the mer community and were community. A reputation he wouldn’t mind seeing changed. <br />
<br />
“Marty, what’s up with you? You can’t seriously be turning me down?” Alyssa said in disbelief. Here she was, standing in his office half naked and more than ready to go, and he was rejecting her advances. No one had EVER turned her down. Ever. <br />
<br />
“I am. I’ve been trying to turn you down for two weeks! I don’t want to end my marriage over one afternoon of fun. I’m sure you know lots of other guys. Go have your fun with them because I’m not about to.” Martin huffed. With that, he strode across the room and stood pointedly next to the door. <br />
<br />
He’d worry about the mess later. Right now his main concern was getting Alyssa out of his office before he changed his mind. Thankfully it was lunch time so everyone had either departed Town Hall, or we in their own offices. Martin thanked his lucky stars no one came looking for him. <br />
<br />
Alyssa crossed her arms, and pouted. She wasn’t about to just leave without getting what she came for. <br />
<br />
“Look MARTIN, “ Martin knew she was mad because Alyssa rarely ever called him by his full name, “I didn’t come up just to talk business. When I go on a trip, I expect to get something out of it. And as I recall, the last time I was in the area you were almost begging me to sit on your lap.” <br />
<br />
“That was twenty years ago! Things changed. And as I recall, we didn’t actually do anything.” Martin said. Granted when he said they hadn’t “done anything” he meant they hadn’t had sex. There was plenty of fun had by both, but none of it involved penetration of any kind. <br />
<br />
“What happened to you? Get dropped on your head while I was gone? Or is that wife of yours putting crazy pills in your breakfast? She seems like a real tight ass.” Alyssa’s face when from a pout to a full on death glare. <br />
<br />
“No, she just knocked some sense into my head. And god forbid she knocks any more in…” Martin started to say. But a knock at the door stopped him. All the blood that had previously been centered on his crotch drained to his feet when the person spoke. <br />
<br />
“Martin can we talk?” Melissa Stovall asked. She’s decided to wait until lunch time to visit her husband. she’d spent most of her morning obsessively thinking about Martin and that phone call this morning. <br />
<br />
Now she was standing outside his office, with various smells wafting out to the hall. Some Melissa hadn’t been expecting to come across, but upon reminding herself this was Martin, wasn’t too surprised.</p>
