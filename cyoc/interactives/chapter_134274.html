<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alternatively, why not have the roles, between Tammy and Teach, shift a little bit? Therefore, Battamaea falls to sleep next to her dragon, just as they are thinking of trying to mate and totally exhausted.<br />
<br />
Bartamus had lay down to nap for a little while, and he had had a strange dream. As with most of his dreams, he could remember the fact that he had had one, but he could not remember its contents, merely that he had found it to be a strange one. When Bartamus started to wake up, he realized that he had fallen asleep lying against his golden dragon, Teach. He chuckled softly as he heard Teach snoring, and he barely opened his eyes enough to see what he had felt concealing his lap. Teach&#39;s tail was lying across his lap. Taking just enough of a glance to verify this, he closed them again and listened again to his dragon&#39;s low, soft snoring.<br />
<br />
Bartamus was both unlike and a lot like most Riders. Unlike most Riders, Bartamus had never been very strict with Bartamus, not even as strict as Luka was with Karyu. He had never looked at &quot;confession&quot; as anything of the sort, but instead, his conversations with Teach had been just that: they had been conversations. They had always involved Bartamus getting a little bit drunk on mead, letting Teach have what was really an extremely small quantity, for his size, in order to wet his lips, and the two would chit-chat until it was time for them to turn in to their places of rest. In fact, falling asleep lying against Teach&#39;s flank, in this manner, was not unusual for him on evenings that he had had more than usual to drink.<br />
<br />
However, Bartamus also was a lot like other Riders, being a sort of person that could only think of his dragon as being one of two things: a dragon was either dangerous and in need of being destroyed, or a dragon was &quot;tame&quot; and deserving of being taken care of, just that, an either wild or domesticated animal. Although Bartamus had always been secretly attracted to Teach, then, the idea of mating with Teach was still a perverse, very strange idea.<br />
<br />
As Bartamus listened to the soft rumble of Teach&#39;s snores, he realized that something was off about the sound. It was not a new sound, but his reaction to it was different than usual. There had always been a soft, stuttered whistling sound among the rumbles, and while it had always tended to fall into the background, it now was sounding like a machine-gun squeak, being most disturbing and alarming.<br />
<br />
In fact, the whistling noise was so disturbing that, soon, Bartamus was no longer able to lie there passively, and he began trying to move Teach&#39;s tail from across his lap. Wow, it was heavy. Did Teach gain some weight? A lot of weight. Damn. What had happened to his dragon? How had his dragon become suddenly so heavy? No, it must be that, somehow, Bartamus had fallen asleep lying next to the wrong dragon.<br />
<br />
This was obvious, too. The scales of this dragon were a more reddish color gold than those of Teach (a woman&#39;s eye is more sensitive to reddish colors), and Bartamus laughed at himself for getting so drunk that he had confused a copper-gold dragon with his own lovely pure gold one. Gritting his teeth, he heaved, and he managed to get the great tail to move most of the way off of his lap.<br />
<br />
And that was when he saw the horrible thing that had happened to his legs. They had gotten shriveled up! He reached for them, and he felt up and down them. He had been sick. That was it. He had been sick and having a fevered dream. Very very sick. It must be that terrible illness he had seen while visiting a whore in Algiers. Venereal disease, no! No! Anything but that!<br />
<br />
As he thought about venereal disease, though, he felt down between his legs to see if that was alright. No. Oh, shit, this was bad. His testicles had either parted with him or gotten drawn up inside, for one thing, leaving a shriveled double-mound where they had once been, which still FELT like his balls but weren&#39;t. As his fingers probed around, he found it was hard to find his dick. Damn, had he been in a coma for this long? He eventually found it...or its remnant...lodged tightly between his now-shriveled and shrunken balls. A very tiny nub, it was, and much more sensitive and raw-feeling than what had once been there.<br />
<br />
However, Bartamus got a somewhat familiar sensation as he rubbed at that nub, and he kept on doing so in order to calm himself. Whatever this disease was that had crippled him, at least he had something left of what it had taken away, just a remnant but something. Even though his life was arguably ruined, he could take at least something in its wake, and he spent a while just lying there masturbating, just as he had so often in the past. The vulgar but familiar act, for a while, kept the reality of what had happened from really hitting home.<br />
<br />
As he continued to masturbate, though, he began to sweat, and as he began to sweat, he felt a bead of sweat rolling down his chest. He moved his other hand to swipe it off. As he did so, he felt something on his chest...bounce. His heart stopping in his chest, he finally opened his eyes all of the way upon his chest, which he had only barely glimpsed when he was worrying about his legs, and he looked down to see a pair of tits. Big ones. That was when he began to scream.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Teach woke up to hear his transformed Rider screaming, and as his eyes flew open, he saw the panicky woman backing and cowering against the wall. &quot;Who are you?&quot; she cried, tears of panic streaming down her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Battamaea! Battamaea!&quot; he said hastily. &quot;Please, it&#39;s just me! Teach!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No!&quot; Battamaea cried brokenly. &quot;My dragon doesn&#39;t look like you! My dragon is beautiful and pure gold, and he calls me by my actual name, Bartamus, which you must have misheard from whoever trained you to deceive me!&quot; Teach took a step toward Battamaea, and he realized she was tearing at parts of her body in confusion, leaving scratch marks across herself from her nails. It was like what Vrackie had warned them of. Battamaea was rejecting her female body.<br />
<br />
&quot;At this, Teach made a difficult decision: he was going to have to restrain his Rider to keep her from seriously injuring herself. He knew it would partly make a bad situation worse to render her suddenly helpless, but if she- were to run away into the dread wilderness, there was no telling what would happen to her before she came to her senses. With a lurch, Teach&#39;s haunches bunched, and he leapt out to pin Battamaea down. &quot;Listen!&quot; he pleaded to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me go!&quot; she howled.<br />
<br />
&quot;The story, Tammy, the story!&quot; Teach said. &quot;Remember? &#39;The Princess that Fell in Love with the Dragon&#39;? You told me that story when I was little because your uncle had told it to you when you were little. Tell me that story. Please?&quot; He said this in a voice that was very much like that of a hatchling.<br />
<br />
At this, Tammy&#39;s new maternal instincts kicked in (for a woman&#39;s natural instinct is to tell stories or sing songs to comfort a little one), and around choked sobs, she began telling the story.<br />
<br />
- &quot;A long time ago, in a land far away, a dragon was raiding a tiny kingdom in the mountains, which quickly running out of sheep. The kingdom was far away from where everything else was, and they could only depend on what they could make or raise for themselves, for most of the year. This situation was making the kingdom more and more desperate.<br />
<br />
- &quot;The king had three young daughters, all of them princesses. However, only the oldest two of his daughters were considered to be beautiful, then. They were short, so they could stare up into the eyes of a handsome prince, and they were plump, which everyone knew was more attractive in a time when being plump meant that a woman had been in good care and was favored. The youngest, while not unhandsome, was tall and rail-thin, and she spent far too much time outdoors, taking care of animals. She was also a bit of a hippie, and she wore short peasant tunics that were most terribly inappropriate for a woman, particularly one of class.<br />
<br />
- &quot;The king had an advisor, a supposed wise man, that truly hated this princess. A part of why was the princess had been trying to warn her father that the advisor had been using the king&#39;s gold to buy things for himself, making excuses for why he needed these things in the name of the kingdom. So far, the king had dismissed these warnings as attempts, by a neglected daughter, to get attention for herself, and he had scolded her for for her trouble. The adviser, though, knew that it was only a matter of time before this changed. After all, the adviser knew that the youngest daughter was really beautiful in her way, and she would only become more beautiful as she got older and therefore more influential.<br />
<br />
- &quot;The adviser eventually said, to the king, &#39;I heard, when I was traveling far and wide, that a dragon could be appeased by sending him a princess to devour.&#39;<br />
<br />
- &quot;The king was skeptical about this, and he said to the adviser, &#39;I love my daughters, though, and I do not really want to give them away to a dragon.&#39;<br />
<br />
- &quot;The adviser said to the king, &#39;then you must love yourself more than you love your kingdom, since you will not give away even your most homely daughter to help the kingdom.&#39;<br />
<br />
- &quot;Therefore, the youngest daughter of the king was tied up, having otherwise been stripped naked to make her easier for the dragon to eat, and she was sent to where the dragon was known to live.<br />
<br />
- &quot;However, the dragon was more curious than ravenous, since the humans had been most kind in sharing their sheep, making him fat and more agreeable than usual. He untied the princess from the ropes that held her hands, but he left the ropes on her that held her ankles tied together to keep her from running away.<br />
<br />
- &quot;Now, the princess had become very good at communicating with animals, and she was able to get the dragon to see her as a friend. This was very fortunate, since it would otherwise have been only a matter of time before the dragon became hungry. Knowing that animals loved to be given food, she would butcher the dragon&#39;s kills for him, saving work for his teeth, and throw him the most delicious bits of meat, which were not the favorite parts for a human to eat. When the dragon was done with a carcass, she would boil down the carcass to extract the fat from it, and she would produce a form of tallow. Using this, she would rub down every inch of the dragon&#39;s scales, making them shinier for her to look at and softer for her to touch. After all, the princess knew enough about animals that she knew that any animal loved to be preened if it would let someone do so.<br />
<br />
- &quot;Over time, the princess&#39;s skill with animals led to her and the dragon becoming friends, and ultimately, she was able to teach the dragon some of her language. The dragon likewise taught her a little bit of his own, and they began to learn a lot more about each other. Eventually, the princess told the dragon about the bad adviser, and the dragon was sympathetic with the princess.<br />
<br />
- &quot;In time, then, the princess and the dragon went together back to the kingdom, and they went into the throne room. To her surprise, though, the adviser was sitting on the throne, and her father was naked except for some chains and scrubbing the floor. &#39;What is this?&#39; the princess said.<br />
<br />
- &quot;&#39;Ah,&#39; said the adviser, &#39;well, I said to the people that I saw the king and some of his subjects carrying you away all tied-up to have you fed to the dragon. I told them how they tied you up, and I told them how they stripped you of your clothes. The people of the kingdom said that, since I had been very wise to point out this crime, then I should serve as the regent king until one of your sisters has produced a male heir. This will not be anytime soon, though, because they themselves are serving sentences in the dungeon for being a part of the conspiracy to carry you away.&#39;<br />
<br />
- &quot;&#39;I will acknowledge my father&#39;s crime,&#39; the princess said, &#39;but this does not give you a right to serve as regent, especially because he only committed his crime based on your advice.&#39;<br />
<br />
- &quot;The adviser called the guards out against the princess, but when they recognized her, in spite of the fact that she stood there significantly older and still as naked as a barbarian, they stopped short. &#39;We see that the princess has not been harmed after all,&#39; they said. &#39;The dragon, in spite of his thievery, appears to be at her beck and call. We feel now that we have been deceived.&#39;<br />
<br />
-  &quot;&#39;Get her!&#39; the adviser shouted from the throne.<br />
<br />
- &quot;Some of the guards that were loyal to the adviser surged forward, their weapons drawn, but the ones that were loyal to the king pulled out their weapons and, after a brief battle, stopped them short of hurting the princess.<br />
<br />
- &quot;At this, the adviser angrily pulled out a knife, and he ran toward the princess, but before he could get very close, the dragon leaped upon him and tore his throat out, right there on the spot.<br />
<br />
- &quot;The king abdicated his throne and admitted that he was guilty of a lesser crime that would only warrant him being confined to his private rooms in the castle for ten years, and he agreed that the dragon could serve as his regent. He also agreed that, if the princess could have any offspring by the dragon, the firstborn male could become king. That is exactly what happened, and the kilin that was born to the princess and the dragon served wisely, producing a long line of very very wise kings.<br />
<br />
- &quot;The end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teach held his Rider&#39;s hands and looked her in the eyes as she finished the story. &quot;Do you remember how you told me, Rider, that you felt a little bit like her, sometimes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Battamaea nodded numbly. &quot;I never told any of my family. I was afraid they would never want to know me, from then on. I just knew that I was her, somewhere inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teach tilted his head to the side and smiled at her. &quot;You built up a fantasy, though, that you were really Bartamus, You always made a show of being more manly than a man, all for them. At some point, you forgot it was an act, didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Battamaea nodded her head. &quot;I said to myself, once, that my name would be Battamaea if I had been born in the right life. It seemed so far away, I just forgot.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, Teach laughed. &quot;You have so much land and wealth now, though, that you really could be royalty. An act of secession and a strong army, and you&#39;d have yourself a little kingdom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Battamaea smiled at that. &quot;A kingdom still needs a king, though, although that might change, someday,&quot; she said, pausing pensively for a moment. &quot;Teach?&quot; she asked, finally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Teach said anxiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that I admire my sister, Luka, in some ways. She is strong and is ever in control, with Karyu. She is what she is, but she is still a Rider.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teach nodded. &quot;Karyu is a very special dragon. Even though he is so much stronger than every other dragon, he is deeply loyal to Luka, and she is his mistress in every way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Battamaea looked with shining eyes up into those of Teach, holding his paws tightly in her hands. &quot;I would be happy to just be your wife...and your queen...if you would be my king,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
With that, Teach smiled and took her gallantly by the hips, lining his hardening cock up with her vagina. &quot;Well, if you are going to be my queen,&quot; he said, with a smirk, &quot;then I will be dominating you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Battamaea arched her back and looked up into Teach&#39;s eyes hungrily. &quot;Then I submit to you,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
At those words, Teach&#39;s cock thrust itself halfway into Battamaea&#39;s sex in one motion, causing her to cry out as she lost her virginity forever in that moment. She clutched at Teach&#39;s wrists and cried out in her feminine voice, realizing quickly what it was to be a woman and to be made a woman of. As she was stretched, she began to struggle, although she never said the words for Teach to stop. Although her body struggled, her mind and heart wanted her to belong to Teach, every inch of herself.<br />
<br />
Teach growled dominantly at her cries and gave another thrust. Vrackie&#39;s magic had made it possible, although just barely, for him to fit himself in all the way, and his fat balls soon rested against Battamaea&#39;s ass. At this point, though, he stopped to let Battamaea adjust. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; he asked her, as she calmed.<br />
<br />
Battamaea winced a few times as her sex labored to keep itself stretched around the mighty member, but after a while, she stopped trying to govern her own body&#39;s reactions, letting her body take its punishment for rebelling and crying out softly with every failed attempt by her to contract around the cock. She caught her breath soon, though, and a sense of pleasure washed over her face as endorphins kicked in, belatedly. &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; she said, with her mouth parted and her eyes staring upward.<br />
<br />
Teach drew back slightly, and this dragged his cock firmly against Battamaea&#39;s clit. This caused Battamaea to cry out in a pleasurable way that pleased him, and he decided to make a game out of slowly dragging his cock in and out over that clit, getting a thrill out of watching her spazz out in pleasure from the grinding of his cock.<br />
<br />
Soon, Battamaea had her first orgasm as a woman, and she blacked out utterly, shuddering. Like any woman that has ever orgasmed during sex, Battamaea would be able to have multiple orgasms during sex.<br />
<br />
As Teach began to revel in his power to do this to Battamaea, he began to pick up a plowing, steady thrusting, in and out of her sex. finding that he could drive her into a sustained cluster-orgasm if he did her in just the right rhythm. With a growling cackle of dominance, then, he fucked that pussy for all that it was worth, claiming it forever as his.<br />
<br />
Battamaea would still ride on Teach&#39;s back (or possibly clutched to his chest like his prize), but in the future, she would not ride him as his Rider. She would ride him as his bride and queen...and he would be her king.<br />
<br />
From here, there shall be an alternate path where Teach and Tammy consolidate their reign over a mighty empire...and Tammy is permanently submissive to King Teach.</p>
