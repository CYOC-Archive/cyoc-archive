<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daryn tried to creep out of the library without drawing any attention to himself. Or herself, since it seemed like he was stuck like this. Apparently everyone was willing to accept that there was a half snake girl wandering around as she didn&#39;t start a riot on the way out. The only reaction that she garnered was a pointed question from the librarian as to whether she&#39;d finished her assigned sorting. Fortunately as she looked at the librarian no horrific compulsion to devour her overcame Daryn and after confirming that her work was done she was allowed to leave the library.<br />
<br />
 Moving her new tail was easier the more she got used to it. The trick seemed to be to use it to pull herself along the ground as opposed to pushing. Above all she tried to keep her eyes down and not look at anyone. The book had said that she&#39;d kill anyone that she saw, so maybe another solution would be not to see anyone. Looking square at the ground and squinting her eyes mostly shut she tried to slither her way through the halls towards her next class. She didn&#39;t know exactly how she was going to overcome the curse of the Lamia in her next class, but was certain that she would think of something. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately navigating the hallways without looking where she was going proved to be a bit too much for Daryn and soon she realized that despite her best efforts she was now nowhere near where her next class was. She needed to check where she was, which meant that she needed to look up. With her eyes still shut she looked up, prayed that there would be nobody there, and then opened her eyes. <br />
<br />
She was at the window to the pool and the entire swim team was there. <br />
<br />
And. They. Looked. Delicious. <br />
<br />
Dayna wondered why she&#39;d been fighting it before. Those young bodies, it was only natural to desire them. And what better way to show that desire than consuming them completely?<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; she shouted to herself and shut her eyes. She could see how this was going to be a problem because even while screaming at herself that it was wrong the only thing that she wanted to do was get in there and go after those girls for all they were worth. Slowly she remembered the book and one of the less horrific creatures that was described inside. &quot;Well at least it will be a bit appropriate,&quot; she muttered to herself as she opened her eyes again. <br />
<br />
She looked at the swim team and tried to remember the image of the mermaid. She wondered if she should have asked the book about more specific information on how to transform the girls when suddenly there was a blue flash. <br />
<br />
For a moment she was afraid it hadn&#39;t worked as in front of her stood the usual dozen girls of the swim team... but after a moment Daryl realized that something must have changed as the compulsion to devour them was completely gone. She watched as Anna, the team captain and a well known hottie a grade above Daryl, dove into the pool and started swimming laps. The other girls soon followed and amid their splashing progress from one end of the pool to the other Daryl started to see the first signs of change. The swim caps and goggles that the team was wearing seemed to vanish in between strokes, allowing long and luxurious hair to flow freely in the water. Next to go were the girls&#39;s swimsuits, and twelve naked girls were suddenly determinedly swimming in front of Daryl. She felt herself blush. Apparently one part of her mind remained untouched. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until the girls had stopped doing their laps and pulled themselves part way out of the water to listen to their coach that Daryl noticed the next change. All of the girls had gone from merely young and nubile to completely smoking. The overhead lights glinted off their wet bodies, highlighting curves that just hadn&#39;t been there a moment before. Daryl&#39;s eyes fell on Anna. She&#39;d always been hot, but those amazing round hips were new, and so were a pair of breasts that might have made Daryl&#39;s pair feel inadequate if Daryl wasn&#39;t having such a good time staring at them. She suddenly caught free hand starting to drift towards her newly feminine folds. <br />
<br />
Daryl hesitated for a moment... then teased a probing finger in and out of herself. She gave a little gasp of surprise, then it became even greater surprise when it turned into a hiss. Slowly she began to explore herself more and more... until Anna happened to turn around. Anna&#39;s eyes went wide. <br />
<br />
Looking down, Daryl realized that at the height she&#39;d propped herself up at on her tail, her activities were in clear view. &quot;Whoops...&quot; she said, looking back at Anna with a blush. However Anna had broken away from the coaches lecture and was lazily swimming towards the window, and Daryl. As she did Daryl was able to see the last parts of her transformation take place. She stopped kicking her legs individually and started kicking them as one, and then that one began to fuse. By the time she was halfway across the pool she had a single tube of flesh with a few bright blue scales running along the sides. The scales spread more and more while her feet flattened out and became fins. A quick glance showed that this was happening to the other members of the team as well. The other members of the team seemed to be paying less and less attention to the coach and instead spending more and more time looking deeply into each other&#39;s eyes. <br />
<br />
By the time that Anna had reached the end of the pool she was fully a mermaid. The smile that she was giving Daryl wasn&#39;t leaving much room for ambiguity, especially with the scene behind her. <br />
<br />
All of the other full mermaids had paired off or formed triples and were all passionately making out and a few were going beyond that. The coach looked on all of this with the air of an indulgent parent. She didn&#39;t seem to see anything wrong with what the girls were doing and maybe even saw it as a good warm up. It probably wasn&#39;t a surprise. What Daryl had read about the mermaid&#39;s curse said that their libidos were through the roof, and weren&#39;t exactly choosy when it came to partners. <br />
<br />
Anna however was looking right at Daryl and mouthing something. It was a bit hard to make out at first. She was certainly mouthing &quot;Lamia,&quot; but the rest was a bit garbled. Eventually Daryl figured it out and felt herself blushing again. &quot;Lamia. Come. Eat. This.&quot; Anna lifted herself out of the water with one hand and presented herself in a way that got rid of all possible ambiguity in that statement.</p>
