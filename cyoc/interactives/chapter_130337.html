<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No-one else was home when I pulled up at Rod&#39;s. Rod worked as a IT specialist for the local council. He rarely had to work late. By the time I had greeted Biddy and given him his dinner I heard Rod&#39;s car pulling in. <br />
&quot;Hi Sarah&quot;, he said. Was he forgetting that I was really his best mate Zach in Sarah&#39;s body? He must have seen the embarrassed look on my face &quot;Oops sorry, It&#39;s hard to think of you as Zach when you look like that&quot;<br />
&#39;Two more days Rod. Then everything should get back to normal&quot;<br />
Biddy by now had wolfed down his dinner and was jumping on Rod&#39;s legs. &quot;Looks like Biddy wants some attention&quot; and gave the dog a scratch. &quot;Are you planning to come to the game tonight?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I could face the rest of the team looking like this&quot; I gestured at my female body &quot;Best if I stay and keep Amanda company. Besides I have promised Biddy a walk&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m going to get changed, we have a 6.30 start tonight&quot; He departed to the bedroom.<br />
I took the opportunity to give Sarah&#39;s mum a ring as I had promised to do in the morning. She informed me that Jenna had settled down.  Jenna had locked herself away in her room most of the day but by lunch had reappeared and had apologized for borrowing and ruining the silver dress. &#39;Mum&#39; had taken the dress to get it dry cleaned this afternoon and was confident the stains could be removed and she would fix a minor tear herself. I mentioned the cocktail evening on Friday and she assured me she could have the dress back in mint condition by then.<br />
I then went into the spare bedroom where I had dumped Sarah&#39;s belongings this morning and started hanging the clothes in an empty wardrobe in the room. I placed the underwear into some drawers in that wardrobe. But kept the jewellery and other valuables in the box which I placed in the bottom of the wardrobe. Biddy kept me company.<br />
At about 6 Sarah and Amanda turned up. Amanda my girlfriend did not know about the bodyswap between myself and Sarah. Hopefully by Thursday the period I was experiencing would be finished and we could use the medallion to swap back into our own bodies. I would regain my manhood and be Zach once more. <br />
Sarah was already dressed in my basketball gear and I could help but admire the muscles of my &#39;Zach&#39; body. These female hormones were really playing with my mind.<br />
I didn&#39;t get a chance to talk to Sarah alone before Rod came out also in his basketball gear and said they had better get going. I watched with Amanda as they jumped into &#39;Zach&#39;s&#39; car. Rod called out that they would pick up some pizza&#39;s on the way home.<br />
I said to Amanda &quot;We should take Biddy for a walk before it get&#39;s dark&quot; and fetched his new leash. We had only purchased Biddy on Saturday so up this point any dog training was non-existent.<br />
As we walked around the block I explained to Amanda that I (in my Sarah guise) had decided to move in with Rod and we would be completing the move over the weekend. I did not explain the Jenna situation suspecting that Sarah did not want the problems her family were having to be common knowledge. I took the opportunity to ask Amanda about last night. At dinner last night I had given Sarah permission to go as far as needed to fix the relationship between &#39;Zach&#39; and Amanda. <br />
&quot;How did last night go&quot; I asked.<br />
Amanda blushed &quot;It was better than my wildest dreams. I didn&#39;t know Zach had it in him&quot; she giggled. &quot;It was like he was a different man. He attended to my every need and had me moaning like you with Rod the other night&quot;<br />
My turn to blush. I too had experienced Sarah&#39;s love making. After the engagement dinner last Saturday Sarah at that stage wearing Rod&#39;s body had seduced me, while I was in my current &#39;Sarah&#39; body. It had been my introduction to womanhood.<br />
Amanda continued &quot;I can&#39;t wait for the weekend. I&#39;m going to pack my sexiest lingerie. I&#39;m going to make this weekend special&quot; Zach and Amanda were of to a wedding in Sydney for 3 nights over the weekend. By then I would be back in my own Zach body and would be the beneficiary of her mood. I was excited by the prospect.<br />
I took the opportunity to ramp things up for myself &quot;How do you feel about oral sex?&quot; I asked quietly in Sarah&#39;s voice. I knew the answer, Amanda was uncomfortable with the idea and had never indulged my fantasies in this regard when I was Zach.<br />
She whispered to me &quot;Well until last night I was uncomfortable. However Zach&#39;s tongue has now convinced me otherwise. I&#39;m trying to summon up the courage to pay him back likewise over the weekend&quot; she gave me a wink. Now I was excited.<br />
We continued chatting about more mundane subjects.<br />
Once we were back at Rod&#39;s house Amanda sat on the floor in the lounge and played with Biddy. I went to the toilet and was relieved to see that my menstrual flow finally appeared to be easing. I returned via the kitchen and poured two glasses of wine handing one to Amanda. <br />
&quot;Are you having your period&quot; she asked perceptively. <br />
I nodded<br />
&quot;Have you ever had sex during your period&quot; she asked<br />
I shook my head<br />
&quot;I only ask because I&#39;m worried my period will start over the weekend. Some of the girls at work say it&#39;s Ok but to maybe have a towel handy&quot; I knew Amanda was not on the pill she made me wear a condom whenever we had sex. &quot;I&#39;ve never done it during my period. Do you think Zach would be disgusted? I think some cultures say women are unclean during menstruation&quot;<br />
I knew the answer to this question &quot;I don&#39;t think Zach would be disgusted at all. I know Rod has said Zach is besotted with you and can&#39;t imagine him upset about anything you do. I imagine he would be like Rod and be happy to have sex anytime and any place&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks for saying that Sarah. I feel you have become a really good friend. I always thought you were a bit cold towards me but tonight it just feels so natural to talk with you&quot;<br />
I refilled our wine glasses and we chatted about our jobs. I mentioned about going to the cocktail party on Saturday night. Amanda mentioned her shop had new seasons fashion come in and thought some would suit me. She said she could give me a small discount if I ever shopped there. <br />
While we were chatting Rod and Sarah returned. The boys had had a thrilling 1 point win with Sarah shooting the final basket. He replayed the final moments for mine and Amanda&#39;s benefit and overall seemed very pleased with himself. Rod said he had received a nasty cork to his thigh and went to get some ice to aid his recovery.<br />
I took the opportunity to follow Rod into the kitchen, saying I would put the pizza&#39;s in the oven to reheat them, as they were a bit cold. I quietly enquired about how the game had really gone and he confided that Sarah was hopeless, couldn&#39;t catch, couldn&#39;t pass and couldn&#39;t shoot. It was a miracle that the final shot had gone in and allowed them to beat the bottom team by a point. He said he had to tell the rest of the team that they had indulged in a few drinks before the game had started to try and explain Zach&#39;s sudden ineptness. <br />
Sarah was still replaying how he had collected a rebound when we returned. I indulged him and nodded enthusiastically. <br />
Eventually Amanda had to go to the toilet so I took the opportunity to explain that &#39;Sarah&#39; would be moving in with Rod and the episode with Jenna that had precipitated it. I also mentioned about the cocktail evening on Friday and the Netball tomorrow night. <br />
Rod intercepted Amanda in the kitchen and asked her to help him dish out the pizza&#39;s<br />
Whilst they were out of earshot Sarah explained that she was not very good at netball and that if she had been asked to fill in the team must have been desperate. He explained that Karen would provide me with a team uniform, a skirt and top, and to expect to change at the venue. He told be which runners and briefs I should wear and what a sports bra looked like. I knew I had packed the shoes and clothes he suggested, so there was no need to return to the McKenzie&#39;s.<br />
Regarding Jenna he apologized for not warning me about the situation. He said she had originally bought that silver dress for the engagement dinner but had picked the crimson dress because that was what she had worn when she had last had her hair &#39;Done&#39;. He had been furious when he had seen what Jenna was wearing at the dinner but could say nothing whilst he was wearing Rod&#39;s body. He agreed that moving in with Rod was a good, if not overdue decision.<br />
He was just telling me that Friday night would be fine and that except for Mitch the rest of her workmates were good people who were fun to hang around with, when Rod and Amanda returned. <br />
After the pizzas Amanda said it was time to go. I stayed there with Rod as we watched them get in my Ford and drive away<br />
<br />
...........<br />
<br />
I showed Rod where I had stowed Sarah&#39;s clothes, he was happy with what I had done and said he could get the rest of Sarah&#39;s stuff on Saturday morning.<br />
He suggested we have another drink and talk about what I had learned from Amanda and what he had gleaned from Sarah on the way to basketball.<br />
He returned with a wine for me and while we sat on the couch I related what Amanda had told me while we were walking Biddy. I toned down the sex and omitted the information about the coming weekend.<br />
In turn he related that Sarah had admitted to going all the way. And that &#39;he&#39; had admitted to enjoying it. <br />
I felt teary as he said that Sarah had told him Amanda was staying the night again. How had I got myself into this situation? Could I survive another two days before the change-back? Rod moved over to beside me and gave me a comforting cuddle. <br />
Rod was rambling on about how it was hard to overcome hormones and that how he had experienced how hard it was resist a body that you were attracted to. I thought he was very forgiving to Sarah and I pictured Sarah in my body having sex with Amanda, remembering how attractive she was and what it felt like to be inside her.  They were probably right now arriving home. Would Sarah whisk Amanda straight away to the bedroom? Would they do it with the lights on or off. As Zach I preferred making love with the lights on whereas Amanda liked it to be dark. She was ashamed of imperfections in her body. I loved every bit of her body and did not think she had any imperfections. I imagined fondling her breasts and her nipples enlarging... mmmm.. that felt good.<br />
It finally dawned on me that it was not Amanda&#39;s breast being fondled it was mine. Rod still had one arm around me but the other was fondling my breast through my bra. I realized the buttons on my blouse were undone. I was feeling very horny with my groin craving attention. Rod turned my head and started kissing me on the mouth. I did not resist.<br />
He pulled me across and lifted me so that I was sitting on his lap facing him. My skirt was pushed up so that I could straddle his legs. I could feel his groin pushing into mine though our clothes. In this position he was able to use both of his hands, my blouse was discarded followed by my bra. I could feel his tongue caressing my nipples. His hair smelt so nice, everything felt so nice.<br />
Suddenly I realized who I was and where I was. I pushed off Rod. &quot;I can&#39;t do this&quot;<br />
I stood up, a topless woman and looked him in the eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Rod I can&#39;t forget who I really am&quot; I grabbed my blouse off the floor and held it over my chest. &quot;I don&#39;t want to do anything that I might regret later&quot;<br />
He said &quot;I&#39;m sorry Zach, I can&#39;t control myself around that body&quot;. We stood there looking at each other for 30 seconds. Neither of us could find appropriate words. Eventually Rod said. &quot;Go to bed. I will leave you alone. We can talk in the morning&quot;<br />
I replied &quot;I will, after a shower&quot;<br />
I returned to the spare bedroom, gathered a nightie and locked myself in the bathroom. I decided on a bath instead. It calmed me down. By the time I was out. Rod had gone to bed, he must have already put Biddy out. I went to bed and cried myself to sleep</p>
