<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty slipped into June's bedroom in order to watch what would happen to June.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Jeremy was finding everything extremely fascinating. Ty had turned him into water and put him in a glass, and then Jeremy felt what he assumed had to be someone drinking him. He could also feel something floating around within him as he sloshed into the warm place that he assumed must have been somebody's body.<br />
<br />
As he settled into a warm space, he felt himself... diffusing. Like he was slowly spreading out into something. It wasn't like when he was a glass of water, but rather, it felt like bits of him were being taken to different locations. Not being a stupid guy, Jeremy figured that his liquid essence was spreading through the body of whoever had drunk him.<br />
<br />
He felt the bulk of his essence sloshing slightly just as a bit of him made some sort of contact with what he could only think of as another being.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
There it was again! June had the distinct sense of a presence in the room. She couldn't shake the sense that it was specifically that neighbour boy, Jeremy. The odd part was, she couldn't even say where she was feeling it from - it was like she was surrounded by Jeremy, yet he wasn't anywhere at all at the same time. She would have looked around the room for him again, but the medicine was really having an effect, and her eyes opened for just a moment before settling closed again.<br />
<br />
The hot flash she had felt earlier turned into a much milder warmth spreading through her body from her belly. Ascribing the sensation to an effect of the medicine, she went with it, feeling more relaxed and settled than she had in days. She remained slightly conscious as she drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
June seemingly woke up to find herself in a very different place. She was in a dinghy, floating on a vast sea of water... only, the water wasn't moving anything like any ocean she'd ever seen. She could still sense the presence of Jeremy, and started looking over the sides of the dinghy, thinking to find him drowning in the odd water.<br />
<br />
Concerned for the safety of the boy, she grabbed the oars that weren't there a moment earlier, and started rowing the dinghy as best she could, glancing over the sides regularly in case he was nearby. As she continued to row, she felt herself growing thirsty, the sweat pouring out of her.<br />
<br />
Reaching timidly over the side, June cupped some water from the ocean and brought it to her lips. She was barely surprised at all to find that it wasn't salty; in fact, it tasted slightly bitter, but mostly it tasted sweet. She dipped her hands again, more confidently this time, and continued to drink from the sweet ocean. She felt invigorated, powerful, strong.<br />
<br />
After a few more handfuls of water, she grabbed the oars and returned to rowing, seeking out the boy she knew was somewhere nearby. He felt closer than ever.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Ty watched as June started to twist about. At first, he was worried that she was in some sort of pain, but closer attention revealed that she was twitching different muscles, as though trying to make them work. Wanting a better sense of what was going on, Ty wished that he could see through June's clothes.<br />
<br />
Ty's impression was right, June's movements seemed to involve muscles twitching in sequence, as though encouraging blood flow. But there was something more going on. Ty watched as something small stuck out from the top of June's vagina. Something was *definitely* happening. Ty settled in to keep watching.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Jeremy was definitely very diffuse. He felt a little bit of his essence still settled in that warm space, but the rest of him was spread out. Different parts of him kept being pushed around, as though his watery essence was being forced through various bits of piping. But more interesting to Jeremy was the presence he felt connected to.<br />
<br />
In the part of him that felt the presence, Jeremy felt miniscule electrical pulses shoot through his essence. As he continued to spread out, the pulses became more frequent, and the presence seemed to grow larger.<br />
<br />
Another part of Jeremy seemed to be converging to another place, where it felt like the pipes were increasing the pressure on him, but there was nowhere for him to go. He started to feel a rhythm to the pressure, like the pumping was being handled by some central system. Jeremy quickly determined that it was most likely the heart of whoever it was that had drunk him. Figuring this out, Jeremy felt out his essence's shape in order to work out the shape of the body he was within.<br />
<br />
Rapidly, he sensed arms and legs. Figuring that the diminishing mass of essence in the core was in the stomach, Jeremy didn't take much longer to resolve the rest of the shape. The presence was definitely up in the area of the head - Jeremy figured it was probably the person's brain. The convergent pressure seemed to be in the crotch area. What Jeremy found most curious, though, was the extra mass in the chest area. There was definitely something there.<br />
<br />
Jeremy continued to reach out, to try to sense as much as possible.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
June felt exhilarated. Her muscles felt pumped far beyond what they had ever been during her aerobic sessions at the gym she went to a few years ago. She looked around the boat - it was definitely too big to be a dinghy - to see if she could see Jeremy. It felt like he was right next to her, or right behind her. He was definitely close. June wiped her brow, and reached into the water for another drink.<br />
<br />
As her hand penetrated the surface, she felt something grab onto it, and without a pause she pulled on it. From the water, Jeremy emerged, clinging onto her arm. June was elated - she had found him!<br />
<br />
They toppled back into the boat, Jeremy landing on top of June. She hugged him, glad that she had saved the boy, and as she did so, Jeremy suddenly turned translucent, like the water, and soaked her body. Even as this happened, she felt everything shift.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Jeremy felt the connection spike. He knew who had drunk him now. He reached through the connection, and suddenly everything shifted.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Ty watched, mesmerised, as everything started to accelerate. The small protrusion from the top of her vagina swelled rapidly, and it didn't take long for the familiar shape of a penis to form, twisted comfortably to sit within the tight underwear that were currently invisible to Ty. Meanwhile, June's muscles seemed to swell, as though being pumped up by air, or, as Ty figured was probably happening, by water. June's shoulders visibly broadened, and her hands and feet grew a few sizes. Most striking, though, was what was happening above the neck.<br />
<br />
June's facial features changed. Her nose became more pronounced, her cheekbones shifted slightly, her entire face became more square, and her ears grew noticeably. It didn't take much for Ty to recognise some of Jeremy's features hiding within the new, more masculine face.<br />
<br />
What Ty found most interesting, though, was that her, or rather, his hair didn't change. It was just as long, and just as soft. Having said that, a few of the hairs fell out along the top corners, producing a slight recession of the hairline.<br />
<br />
Ty wondered what was going on within June's mind, but decided it would be more fun to watch the finished result without knowing those details. Wishing to be able to see June's clothes, again, Ty noticed that they had become rather tight in certain places. Feeling a little flash of benevolence, Ty wished for the clothes to adjust to suit the new June. Like they were fluid, June's clothes reshaped themselves, becoming the masculine equivalent. June's bulge relaxed into a slightly more pronounced position, as though no longer confined by underwear designed for women.<br />
<br />
Ty sat back and continued to watch.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
June and Jeremy were standing face-to-face, despite her normally being about head taller than him. Without a word, the two of them embraced once again, and this time, the embrace seemed to just continue forever. Without even noticing it, their two dream bodies merged, and reassembled into a single body, each of the two feeling ecstatic. Their minds followed suit, memories reshuffling and adjusting in order to form a single, coherent life experience.<br />
<br />
Their mind naturally sought out a name, similar to each of theirs, that was gender neutral. Jan knew he was male, but he also knew, in the back of his mind, that he had, at least in a sense, been female. He looked around the dreamscape, which seemed to be a desert, and set off towards the horizon, choosing a direction at random.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Ty watched as the last of the changes happened more slowly. June's... Ty could feel some sort of force flowing around the room, and he pushed it away from himself... June's breasts were redistributing themselves, flattening somewhat. The bulge seemed to push out just a little further, and Ty guessed that testicles were growing in. June's skin grew slightly rougher, and became significantly hairier. A five-o'clock shadow formed on June's face.<br />
<br />
June's eyes fluttered open, and Ty stood up.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Dustin felt a subtle wind blow past him as he sat on the couch watching some TV. Looking at the door into the hallway, Dustin wondered if Uncle Jan was alright. After his mother had passed away, Dustin's father had refused to remarry. However, he had invited Dustin's mother's brother, Jan, to live with them, because Mark needed to work, while the kids needed someone to look after them.<br />
<br />
Jan had always been a great uncle, and was quite the character. Jan had confided in Dustin just a few weeks earlier that he hadn't married because he didn't think he could stay monogamous. Jan was bisexual, and Dustin suspected that he must have been rather sexually active. Putting things together in the way that wouldn't surprise any psychologist, Dustin suspected that Jan had recently caught some sort of STD.<br />
<br />
Concerned for his uncle's health, Dustin resolved to go up and ask him, wake him up if need be.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Jan groaned and sat up in bed. Rubbing his eyes, he muttered to himself &quot;What was in that pill? Or was it the water?&quot; Shaking his head to clear the fuzziness, Jan rubbed at his crotch for a moment, and then lurched to his feet. He pushed his hair behind his ears, and then decided that he was too hot, so he quickly took off his shirt, allowing the skin of his torso to breathe easier.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jan felt as though somebody was watching him. It wasn't like earlier, where he was sure he knew who it was... although, he couldn't seem to recall who it felt like, now... but was instead a generic sense of eyes scanning his body.<br />
<br />
Jan shivered for a moment, and then shrugged and walked to the door of his bedroom... just as Dustin turned to walk into the room. Dustin bounced off Jan's body and fell to the ground in front of him. Jan felt sorry for his little nephew, and held his hand out for Dustin to grab.<br />
<br />
Dustin was clearly a late bloomer. Jan wondered if his sister's genes were the cause, as Mark was clearly not at all undersized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, uncle Jan,&quot; Dustin said sheepishly as he let Jan haul his scrawny body off the ground effortlessly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problems, Kiddo,&quot; Jan responded brightly, &quot;just keep an eye on where you're walking, next time.&quot; Jan then turned towards the bathroom, that water had gone straight through him!<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Ty nodded, not entirely unsurprised. So, June and Jeremy had become &quot;Jan&quot;, had they? &quot;Uncle&quot;? Ty wondered whether it was an honorary title, or if Jan and Dustin really were related. Ty also wondered what else had changed in the world, as clearly Dustin knew who Jan was. Did Mark still exist? What was Ty's role in the family, now?<br />
<br />
Yes, it was definitely going to be interesting, learning what changes had been wrought.</p>
