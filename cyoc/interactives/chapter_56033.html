<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the judges announced Patrick’s win for the first round, Dan noticed 
the air rippling as reality caught up to his incredible growth.  
Patrick was the Alpha Bear on campus; everyone wanted to be him, and 
it showed in the crowd as more people were suddenly wearing skimpy 
kilts and sporting bad red-hair dye jobs.  Dan looked up at Patrick, 
Adrian and Gabe, smiling as they returned the look with flexes and 
belly rubs.  
<br><br>
“Congratulations, Patrick.  You only need two more wins to be crowned 
Alpha Bear,” Sebastian announced to a cheering crowd.  “And, 
unfortunately for Alpha Kappa Alpha, your scores are too low to move 
on to the next round.”  The four toga-clad bears waved goodbye to Dan, 
visibly depressed at their loss as they exited the stage.  “And now 
for my favourite rounds: Gut and Cock size!”  The crowd erupted into 
cheers and growls, “the order has been shuffled, first up is Magnus!  
Dan, I think you’ll need to assist me.”
<br><br>
Timid, massive Magnus lumbered up the stage.  “Poor guy,” thought Dan.  
After this competition, he’d certainly upgrade Magnus’ confidence 
using the Chronovac.  He was one of the biggest and sexiest men on 
campus (Patrick only a little taller), but he was so shy...you 
wouldn’t even notice him if he weren’t so huge.
<br><br>
Sebastian prodded Magnus with a yard stick, “C’mon big guy!  Take ‘em 
off.  Or Dan will have to take them off for you.”  Magnus gulped, his 
face flush red...he felt like he was going to pass out--Dan was about 
to touch him.  That thought alone made his cock throb and grow till it 
ripped free from his compression shorts, making the entire crowd gasp.  
“I think I need a bigger yard stick...” Sebastian whispered.  Magnus’ 
cock was just as big as the rest of him: enormous.  Just over three 
feet long and 14” across with thick veins snaking over the shaft.  It 
bobbed inches from Dan’s face, thick globs of pre dribbling down to 
his feet.  The crowd was completely silent...Dan couldn’t help himself 
as he reached up and touched it, amazed at how freakishly massive it 
was.
<br><br>
“Mmmmff!”  All it took was a touch from Dan before Magnus’ entire body 
shuddered with climax...his balls swelling to the size of basket balls 
before clenching and sending his load into the audience with a roar.  
Everyone was shocked silent at this sudden display of masculinity from 
Magnus...  But it was too much for the huge bear.  He staggered after 
the orgasm and bolted from the stage, hard cock hitting him in the 
chest with a wet slap.
<br><br>
“Well!  We didn’t get his gut measurement, but the current record is 
3-feet-2-inches by 14-inches across!”  The crowd went back to woof’ing 
and cheering.  “Next up is Gabe!”  Dan’s head snapped to Gabe...surely 
after that incredible display of meat he’d have grown so big his cock 
would be dragging on the ground!
<br><br>
“25-inches by 8-inches across!” Exclaimed Sebastian as he tugged at 
Gabe’s hard cock, whipping out the tape measure for his gut, “and a 
104-inch gut!” Dan was disappointed...until he remembered his 15-
changes cap he had put into the Chronovac.  That means Gabe had used 
all his up...  “Grrrr,” thought Dan, “just when this was getting 
good.”  He would have to lift that cap when he got back to the dorm.
Jet and James were up next.  Their stats would’ve been impossibly 
impressive in the old world, but they weren’t nearly as big as Gabe 
had grown.  Adrian had also remained unchanged since the last 
round...he had also run out of Alpha-growth.  “28-inches long and 9-
inches across!”  Adrian grinned, stroking his club of un-cut meat 
while looking at Dan.  “And 112-inch gut!”  Geeze, even without the 
next round of growth, these guys were huge!
<br><br>
Finally, it was Patrick’s turn.  Dan almost came on sight.  He still 
had some changes left and had grown progressively bigger with each 
competitor before him: Dan guessed him to be over 9-feet tall, with 
shoulders 6-feet across and about as thick with muscle from pecs to 
bubble butt.  Every muscle stood out from his body, engorged with 
size.  And because of his even bigger gut, Patrick was forced to 
balance by leaning back, which only made him look bigger.  He peered 
over his pecs and grinned down to Dan, “HEY, CUB!”  He growled, his 
new voice was as deep and powerful as his roar from the Alpha Swagger, 
making Dan shudder and cum as the words sunk in.  
<br><br>
Dan staggered, adjusting his jock as he watched Patrick’s cock grow 
hard from his kilt.  Two feet, two and a half...three feet...still it 
throbbed and grew bigger, pushing against his distended muscle gut as 
it approached four feet long.  It was now adorned with a thick 00-PA 
that looked like Dan could use it as a bracelet.  “F-four feet three 
inches...” Sebastian stammered, eyeing the swollen balls between 
Patrick’s legs, “A-and 22-inches across.” Dan could hear a couple guys 
in the audience losing their load watching Patrick.  “Dan, help me 
measure his gut.”<br><br>
It was so big it took two people to measure accurately.  “This has to 
be a world record,” Sebastian shook his head, looking up to the beast, 
“144 inches around--Or 12 feet!” His gut was bigger around than he was 
tall! No wonder he was so thick!
<br><br>
The judges nodded to Sebastian confirming Patrick’s victory.  “With 
two more wins, that makes Patrick the winner!  You have your Alpha 
Bear!”  The audience exploded with growls and cheers, “And you, 
Patrick, have the honor of getting a date with the most-sought-after-
cub-on-campus: Dan!”  Sebastian pushed Dan forward against Patrick’s 
swollen gut...his heart pounding in his ears.  Even though he had 
orchestrated it, programmed it, he never thought this would 
happen...Patrick exuded Alpha-bear from every pore.  Just making eye 
contact gave Dan shivers.
<br><br>
“Let’s get out of here, cub,” Patrick said with a grin, tucking his 
thick finger into the back of Dan’s jock.  He felt himself cum as 
Patrick finished speaking...his voice reverberating through his body.</p>
