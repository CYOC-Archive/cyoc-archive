<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once she talked to them, she approached the audience and told them everything. “As you can see ladies and gentlemen, all three women celebrated their millennium new year differently. Wendy stayed at home and watched it on TV, Michelle went to a party with some friends, and Jane… Well… Let’s just say she is one wild child. Now let’s see what they’re like in the nineties.” She turned to the girls once again, Jane appearing in the mirror with Tween!Katie and said to them, “All right ladies, ready to take another trip? I want you all to go back to 1994, back when Clinton was president, when Snoop Dogg released his hit ‘Gin and Juice’, and the seventeenth annual Olympics was held at Lillehammer, Norway.”<br />
<br />
Again, the women regressed down in body and mind. For Jane, the changes were much noticeable to the audience. Immediately, she got up and was completely sober, standing up like she didn’t drink at all. The crowd watched as Jane grew smaller, leaving her twenties and racing downwards to teen hood. Her body erode away as the muscles she kept during her years in college melted away. Though she lost her fit body in college, she still obtains her toneness to that of a high school girl. Other parts of her body that made her a woman soon followed. Her C cup breasts begin to deflate, going to perky B cups to a pair of AA cups. Men watched as they saw her cleavage looking less and less attractive. Her hips compressed and flatten, as her hourglass figure was looking less curvy. Even her face subjected to the change. Her oval structure rounded, her nose grew smaller, her lips flattened, her ears shrank, and her eyes looked less elegant and more innocent. A sprinkle of freckles dotted her forehead while a few pimples appeared hear and there from time to time. There was this one time that her teeth had braces on her since they were removed when she was seventeen. The ponytail on her brown hair began to unravel itself as her hair grew longer. But as it grew longer, something strange happened. The moment it stopped getting longer, it immediately got shorter as the color of her hair got lighter. At first, the audience thought it was nothing but a haircut, but then the hair continue to get shorter and shorter. They also notice that her clothes belong to teens in the nineties but they were continuing to look more rebellious. They even caught a glimpse of a piercing on her nose.  In moments, Jane had become once a college girl was now a high school outcast and the age of fifteen. She was wearing a black T-Shirt with the title, ‘Nirvana’ printed in white letters, faded blue jeans with holes ripped from her ankles, and a pair of Converse back sneakers with short white socks. Her face was in the crossroads between feminine and childish with her hair shrunk to the point that it looks almost shaven while a long bang covered part of her face blocking one eye.<br />
<br />
On the inverse of this, The Katie that was walking her along grew to match her former elder. Her chest started to sprout out two fleshy mounds, which were the beginning of her breasts. They then grew into pointy cones and then A-cup breasts as an training bra materialized over them and underneath her ever changing shirt. Her hips started to expand and form curves around her waist as her rear got blown up like a balloon. Her arms and legs continued to grow and started to gain muscle tone, almost like years of excercising were showing results. Her face started to enter the threshold of adulthood with her skull looking oval, lose growing longer and thinner, and her eyes shrinking. Her hair started to grow long and went down to her neck, then below her shoulders. Her clothes changed some more and had the looks of a teenager. She was wearing a pink tank top with straps on her shoulders, a blue jean skirt that goes down to above her ankles, and a pair of pink and blue flip flops. The audeance watched in amazement as the Katie in the mirror was now a sixteen-year-old teen. <br />
<br />
Michelle’s regression was a bit lighter then her daughter’s. All over her body, fat from old age is slowly depleting as her arms and legs were getting a little more tone. Her breasts were rising higher and loosing most of her sagginess. Her face was getting tighter as the wrinkles on her skin slowly faded. Her hair was showing loosing more of its gray as more black strands were returning. Her clothes kept on changing as they went from a couple of dresses to casual clothes for a middle age woman. The moment she reached 1994, Michelle was still a middle age woman of 51. She was wearing a red blouse, large blue jeans, and regular type of sneakers.<br />
<br />
Wendy’s changes were a little drastic. Her spine continued to straighten as her body was at the almost right position. Her walker then disappeared, only to be replacing by a cane for balance. Her hair, which was completely white, was showing signs of it darkening to gray. Even her clothes were less elderly and more middle age. So she went from being 83 to 77 years old with a dress that would fit her age.<br />
<br />
Soon after the next change of the phase, Lesily rubbed her chin and finds this pretty interesting. Approaching the teenaged Jane that emerged from the righthand exit. , she asked her, “So Jane tell me. How old are you?” Jane looked at the woman with a deep glare and said, “I’m fifteen years old. What kind of stupid question is that?” Lesily was appealed by that remark. It’s almost like she was angry at something. She brushed that aside and continued with her talk, saying, “Now Jane, how are you doing in high school. I bet you have some great grades.” Jane response to that was to turn his head away and had a look of disgust. She then went on and said, “High school? Pft… That place is nothing more then a prison to me. Keeping me all locked up listening to the same boring lectures day in and day out. It really pisses me off! I don’t want to live in a society that keeps people like me behind bars. I want to live free doing whatever I want to do. I hope those dumb teachers should go to hell!” Lesily immediately waved her hands to told her to calm down. “Whoa there!” she said, “Ease off girl. Don’t want to get yourself another period right?” Once she got her to calm down, Both Katies and Janes walked up to each other to analyze each other. And by analyze, we mean the teenaged Katie and Jane took College Jane by each arm and carried her over to her seat. &quot;Geez, Kate. Speak of the devil...&quot; Sighed the teenaged Jane to her college-aged counterpart &quot;Keep on living the dream, girl. College&#39;s the closest freedom ya got.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Longing to leave the nest are we?&quot; Asked the Teenaged Katie in a rather coy tone of voice. This irritated Teen!Jane quite a bit where she barked back: &quot;Shut up!&quot; Teen!Katie rolled her eyes as the two walked hand in hand through the hall of mirrors. Lesily walked to the two women left to ask and does as such.  “Michelle, how old are you?” Michelle answered: “51.” “And how are you fairing with your daughter?” the performer continued on. Michelle sighed to herself and said, “Oh, absolutely terrible. My daughter is doing bad in school. And it’s not like she’s not studying, she just doesn’t care about her education or her life. What happened to my girl? She was once a carefree girl back when she was a child. But since she had gotten to the wrong type of crowd, she turned into a rebel of society. She doesn’t care about her family or her future. All she cares about is herself! Oh what have I done to her that made her an outcast?” Lesily groaned to herself and knew this was bad. Tween!Katie sighed as she glanced over to College!Jane with secondhand shame, but also pride in the knowledge that her culture is more than capable of doing much better...<br />
<br />
 She then approached Wendy and asked, “And what about you Wendy? How old are you?” Wendy simply answered, “I’m 77 deary.” Lesily continued, “And what do you think of your granddaughter’s behavior as of late.” Wendy just shrugged her shoulders and said, “Oh it’s nothing that bad. Sure my daughter is worried about Jane, but that’s the type of thing teenagers go through. When they reached their teens they have a tendency of choosing their own lives and living it to the fullest. Heck, my daughter in the fifties had a strange thing with poodle skirts, having crushes on those greasers, and listening to Elvis. It’s a simple phase most girls go through in that decade. But she let that behind and moved on to something different in the sixties. Ah those were the days.”</p>
