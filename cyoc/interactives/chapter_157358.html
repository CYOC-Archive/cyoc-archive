<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Turns out Canade was small enough to sleep comfortably on Heather&#39;s (Hill&#39;s daughter) bunk... Well may as well try it out right? So Canade and Heather were in Heather&#39;s room chatting, Heather excited to have company and giving her a tour. Although Canade was curious why a single girl had a bunk bed. Canade took out the tablet she was gifted and wrote out &quot;Why do you have a bunk bed?&quot; <br />
The little girl read and said &quot;Well... I liked it so daddy got it for me. We can put stuff on top if we ever need to, and if I have a friend over they could sleep on top...&quot; <br />
Canade thought &quot;Then I&#39;d be the friend here... Wish I could look in to the future like mom.&quot; Looking at the jumbo teddy bear on the top bunk &quot;Will this even work out? She&#39;s sweet but also a lot younger than me...&quot; <br />
&quot;Canade are you ok?&quot; Heather asked. <br />
Canade scribbled &quot;Tired, mind if I went to bed?&quot;<br />
Heather looked a little disappointed but said &quot;I guess so, good night...&quot; and then showed her how to her bunk and the bathroom. The mattress was comfortable and the sheets and pillows were warm and soft at least. <br />
<br />
The first day of school came for Canade, her mother pulling enough strings to make it happen fast, and there she was in a school uniform with her backpack. She looked at her schedule while wandering the halls, and not really paying attention. Then someone noticed her and said &quot;Ah, You must be our new student.&quot; Canade recognized the voice and looked to see the familiar face of Yumi... and then remembered when she was when Canade saw Yumi wearing a similar school uniform. Smiling Yumi said &quot;I just wanted to say if you need any help feel free to come to me or go to the Student Council room right over... there.&quot; <br />
Canade thought &quot;Well, if she&#39;s here and offering.&quot; and pointed to her school schedule and her P.E. class location. <br />
Yumi assuming this albino girl was shy said &quot;Let&#39;s see the first class should be in the middle of the first floor of the main building, and the-&quot; a few moments later Yumi finished and Canade was irritated... She just wanted help with gym class she figured out everything else. &quot;Have a nice day.&quot; Yumi said with a smile and then left to go to her own classes. <br />
Canade internally sighed as she went to her history class thinking &quot;Well least no one is afraid of me. But hopefully they wont baby me too much.&quot; <br />
<br />
Her history class was taught by Mr. Jackory... he knew his stuff, but was a stickler for certain details of history. &quot;What do you mean you don&#39;t know about the methods of execution during the French Revolution?!?&quot; the teacher blurted out. He sure had a temper, but the only person he ever seemed to yell at was John... Maybe something in the DNA? Canade started to scribble down an excuse that wasn&#39;t &quot;It wasn&#39;t relevant in the future&quot; but Jackory said &quot;I mean what IDIOT can&#39;t even list the GUILLOTINE!?!&quot; A tear formed in Canade&#39;s eyes... usually she was feared, but this badgering... Her mother warned her about bad teachers like Jackory, but those were just boogeymen right? People were starting to whisper. A bunch wondering how even with Tenure how Jackory hadn&#39;t been fired yet. But there was one that managed to get to Canade. <br />
&quot;to think this girl was cursed to be on Jackory&#39;s bad side...&quot; the whispers grew a little louder and Canade was starting to cry... It was all just a little too much for her. <br />
Jackory sensing the mood in the room reigned himself in and said &quot;Ahem, so in order to bring you up to date I&#39;ll need to have you make a book report along with the standard weekly homework. Meanwhile how about we move on, or shall we refresh ourselves on the tortures that certain gossipers received?&quot; which shut everyone up. Despite her mental state she did absorb the lectures pretty well... transitioning between classes was a little tricky with the sheer volume of students and a slight amount of paranoia that stuck to Canade... The next class was Math with Mr. Will. <br />
<br />
As the class started the teacher who insisted on being called Conner said &quot;Alright class, we may have a new student but that&#39;s no excuse for our test being delayed!&quot; and started handing tests out. &quot;So let&#39;s do our best and Secant the right answers!&quot; to which everyone groaned. Although he got to Canade he said &quot;Don&#39;t worry too much miss, for you this is more to figure out where you&#39;re at. You&#39;ll get a massive curve on the test.&quot; <br />
Canade thought to herself &quot;Ugh... I&#39;m not dumb. I get what she&#39;s doing but I&#39;ll get 100% on this!&quot; and started scribbling on her test going through questions quickly. <br />
Conner said &quot;Feel free to start as soon as you get your test.&quot; and passed them out one at a time checking loosely to see if anyone was hiding a phone or graphing calculator somewhere. &quot;Remember no food or drink allowed unless it&#39;s water... Ronda, why do you have to make me have to say NO you cannot use your phone as your standard calculator?&quot; Conner went back to his desk to grab one of a half a dozen pocket calculators to loan the pretty girl. As Conner started to go back to his desk Canade stood up. Conner said &quot;you know if you have a question you could just raise your hand and I&#39;ll-&quot; Canade held out her test. Conner went over and took her test and said &quot;So where is your... Huh?&quot; Conner took another look and the whole test was completed. She even managed to show her work. The teacher looked around the room and asked &quot;So raise of hands is anyone finding this test to be a little too easy?&quot; Unsure of whether or not he had made the test laughably easy, but no hands went up. In fact most of the students were struggling. Conner asked &quot;Want to recheck your answers?&quot; to which Canade shook her head. <br />
Canade shook her head no as she thought &quot;Great! No one&#39;s going to be calling me an idiot now!&quot; although Conner just stood there around her desk looking for any possible way she could&#39;ve cheated... I mean this wasn&#39;t any of his student&#39;s handwriting... and she did show all her work... A quick glance to her bag showed that it wasn&#39;t full enough for a textbook to be in there, and any of her binders hadn&#39;t been out. <br />
Conner said &quot;Well... I was going to let everyone go when they finished... but...&quot; he then went to his desk and took out a flashcard and wrote down &quot;She finished her test really fast and well. Conner Will&quot; and gave it to her and said &quot;Just show this to someone if the question you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... Let&#39;s see the next period is lunch so... Guess i&#39;ll go to the cafeteria? I do have that meal pass.&quot; Canade thought as she walked and wandered her way to the cafeteria. <br />
On the way however a voice asked &quot;Hey kid, what are you doing out of class?&quot; The teacher was Ms. Stone who didn&#39;t have a class to teach this period so she was going on a small patrol to make sure no one was cutting class or abusing bathroom privileges. And this girl was far away from any bathroom. Canade took out Conner&#39;s note which Stone looked at... Yep that was Conner&#39;s handwriting Stone sighed and said &quot;I think he didn&#39;t know exactly what to do, but I dont think we can just have you wandering around. You&#39;re new right? How about joining me on my patrol think of it as a small tour.&quot; Canade nodded interested to see where everything was. <br />
<br />
Going up a flight of stairs Stone said &quot;And this is the way to the roof, you are normally not allowed to be up here. However I&#39;m making a small exception, two students often like to come up here.&quot; She then opened the door revealing two delinquent students up on the roof waiting for some noodle cups. Stone then yelled out furiously &quot;What the hell are you girls doing up here?!?&quot; <br />
The delinquents Vicki and Nessa got to their feet with Nessa saying &quot;Well... we missed breakfast and needed a place to make some quick noodles so-&quot; <br />
Stone said &quot;Fine, chug down those cups and return to class and I&#39;ll only give you one day of detention.&quot; Meanwhile Vicki already had her cup lowered... Seeing her role model do it so fast Nessa did her best to eat rapidly and then they grabbed their trash and started to leave. <br />
Vicki noticing Canade asked &quot;What&#39;s up with Whitey there? A new rulebreaker?.. and why is she in the doorway&quot; <br />
Canade lifted her tablet which read &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Canade. It&#39;s a little too bright up out on the roof there.&quot; <br />
&quot;And what&#39;s she in for?&quot; Vicki asked <br />
Stone responded &quot;Exact opposite of you two. Now back to class.&quot;  the two delinquents started leaving, but Vicki took a second glance at Canade who was a little scared. After that moment the rest of the patrol was just a small tour basically that helped Canade familiarize herself with where everything was. <br />
<br />
Canade was by herself at the Cafeteria deep in thought &quot;On one side I was first in line at the cafeteria, and know where everything is... On the other hand there are some rumors about me already... What if everyone here already think-&quot; <br />
&quot;Yo Whitey.&quot; Vicki said right next to Canade<br />
Canade didn&#39;t notice thinking &quot;Maybe I should just tell mo-&quot; <br />
Irritated Vicki said &quot;Oi, I&#39;m talking to you!&quot; <br />
Canade saw and thought &quot;Well if something happens that&#39;ll just give me more reason to go home...&quot; she looked Vicki in the eyes to show she saw them. <br />
Vicki asked &quot;So then why exactly were you with Ms. Clark?&quot; Still having Conner&#39;s note she showed it. &quot;So you cheated?&quot;Canade shook her head and waved her hands no. A few scribbles and she was somehow able to convince the delinquents that she was in fact just really smart. Vicki grinned then &quot;Ah, so then... Think you can do my friend here a little favor?&quot; she nudged her friend Nessa. Vicki started messing with Nessa and Canade decided not to get involved with delinquents and scampered away. <br />
<br />
Slinking into a bathroom Canade thought &quot;Ah, nice quiet private place... no whispers, no delinquents, just a good place to breathe.&quot; and then realized this was a public bathroom, and she abandoned her lunch. Canade continued to think &quot;You&#39;re thinking a little too much... Just blank your mind... meditate for a minute.&quot; She closed her eyes in front of one of the mirrors. A few moments later John came in deciding that around now was the time she should probably actually use a bathroom instead of just rewinding her digestive tract. <br />
John seeing her future daughter said &quot;Ah, Hi Canade... Canade?&quot; she walked up and saw her with her eyes closed in front of the mirror. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; and touched Canade&#39;s hand. <br />
Canade felt it, opened her eyes, and then noticed her mom... and that she left her bag with her lunch as well. Dang it that&#39;s where she kept her tablet and all other writing stuff. <br />
John said &quot;Well you don&#39;t seem hurt. Where&#39;s your stuff?&quot; Canade just stood glaring at her mother silently as John remembered and said &quot;Alright, I&#39;ve known you for maybe 2 days at most and it&#39;s pretty common to ask someone a question that isn&#39;t yes or no.&quot; John rewound herself and said &quot;Well then just show me where your stuff used to be.&quot;</p>
