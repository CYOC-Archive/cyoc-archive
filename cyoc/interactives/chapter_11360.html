<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt looked longing at the wand, which had suddenly appeared in mid-air.  It would have <br />
been within reach, if his arms hadn't been wrapped up in the giant grasp.  The wand <br />
clattered as it fell from mid-air onto the floor.  &quot;What's this?&quot; Todd asked, noticing how <br />
both Matt and Brett had perked up at the appearance of the wand.<br />
<br />
Matt didn't answer.  He was not about to give this giant even more power.  Todd picked up <br />
the wand with his free hand and started to squeeze Matt.  &quot;I said, what is this?  Is this how <br />
you shrank?&quot;<br />
<br />
Being squeezed was far more painful than Matt had ever imagined.  Like four tree trunks, <br />
or the coils of a giant python, the fist slowly constricted him.  He breathed out, trying to <br />
take up less space.  Then he remembered that he could shrink!  Being squeezed shouldn't <br />
be much of a threat.  Willing himself smaller, the pressure was released.<br />
<br />
But the release only lasted a moment, as Todd tightened his grip.  &quot;Unless you're going to <br />
shrink away to nothing, I suggest you answer my question,&quot; Todd growled.  Watching this <br />
scene was too much for Brett, who scampered off to hide.<br />
<br />
Matt stammered, &quot;It's my magic wand.&quot;  Immediately Todd relented, and Matt could <br />
breathe again.  Todd looked in the direction that Brett had disappeared, but instead <br />
decided to focus on Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;A magic wand?&quot; Todd repeated.  &quot;How do I use it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt thought better of answering honestly, but as he delayed, Todd began gripping his <br />
small form tighter.  Seeing he was beat, Matt explained.  &quot;Point it and make a wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You about done down there?&quot; Paul shouted from the kitchen landing.  Both Todd and Matt <br />
jumped in response to the sudden distraction.<br />
<br />
Todd smiled.  &quot;Yep, come on down,&quot; Todd shouted back.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, let's give this a try,&quot; Todd said, pointing the wand.  &quot;For starters, I wish you and Brett <br />
would hold still while Paul is down here.&quot;  Matt felt his body stiffening as Paul's large body <br />
vibrated the stairs with his approach.  &quot;Then, I wish Paul would cum on me as payment.&quot;  <br />
Paul had reached the bottom of the stairs and was coming down the hallway towards the <br />
utility room.  &quot;That's probably not enough of a wish,&quot; Todd said, so then added, &quot;Finally, I <br />
wish Paul would shrink me with his dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt wanted to shake his head as he heard the last wish, remembering his own ill-worded <br />
command, but found his body completely immobilized as Paul entered the room.  Todd <br />
hid Matt inside an open box, but positioned him so he could just see over the edge.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what's the damage?&quot; Paul's voice rumbled in the utility room, walking over to Todd.  <br />
He was in a t-shirt and shorts, his strong muscles rippling as he walked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No damage any more,&quot; Todd tried to make a joke.  Todd was nervous as he tried to calmly <br />
put his tools away.  He had been the Laird family handyman for years, watching the kids <br />
grow up, and had often fantasized about this customer.  Todd stayed crouched over his <br />
toolbox, enjoying another golden moment of looking up at this hunk.  Todd wondered <br />
how he could bring sex up as he drank in the view before him -- bulging crotch, dense <br />
mustache, built chest.  Finally Todd said, &quot;Payment in the customary way?&quot; impressed that <br />
he had thought of such a clever way to put it, but a little quaver crept into his voice.<br />
<br />
Paul grunted his assent.  Todd watched breathless as the shorter man pushed his shorts <br />
down around his ankles, exposing a large sleeping cock supported by a bulging nutsack.   <br />
Paul yanked on his dick a few times, and then pulled his shirt off, revealing his hairy <br />
musculature to Todd for the first time.  Cradling his balls with his left hand, Paul started <br />
massaging his cock to life with his right.  Todd could barely breathe, his own little dick <br />
stiff as a board in the presence of such manliness.  As Paul's dick inflated, it lifted into the <br />
air giving Todd a full view of its eight thick inches.  Paul's balls were even more oversized, <br />
factories that supported this stud.  Just seeing them made Todd feel small and submissive.<br />
<br />
Fully hard, Paul spoke, &quot;Aren't you going to help?&quot;  Todd just about came in his overalls.  <br />
He had fantasized about being able to watch, and hadn't thought about touching his <br />
master.  After a moment of hesitation, Todd scrambled over to Paul.  The butterflies in his <br />
tummy were churning so much his head was swimming.  As his face neared Paul's stroking <br />
fist, Todd could feel the heat radiating off his man.  Then he was hit by the smell of <br />
masculine energy, an odd scent at first, but one that seemed to quiet his tummy a little.<br />
<br />
Moving in closer, Todd realized he had to put the big rod into his mouth.  Gently he <br />
pressed his head against Paul's warm abdomen and slid the mushrooming cockhead into <br />
his mouth.  He reached out to hold one ball in each hand, gently massaging their <br />
burgeoning weight.  The taste of Paul's cock was slight but rewarding, and as Todd <br />
breathed in his man he felt his tension ebbing.  This was where he belonged, servicing his <br />
customer.  &quot;That's a good boy,&quot; Paul murmured, petting Todd's head.<br />
<br />
As the moments passed and Todd relaxed, he was able to take more and more of Paul's <br />
dick.  Working his way down the thick pole, he felt it gently swelling in his mouth.  Paul's <br />
nuts were pulling up closer to his body, but they seemed bigger than ever.  Todd stopped <br />
about half way down Paul's 8+ inches, unable to go much further.  Using an available <br />
hand, Paul stroked the base while Todd sucked on the tip.<br />
<br />
Todd's little dick twitched jealously.  Paul's sex was so big it required Todd's mouth, and <br />
THREE hands.  Even now, Paul's balls threatened to spill out of Todd's hands as the <br />
tightened and swelled.  Todd rocked his groin slowly, grinding his dick against his <br />
underwear for relief.<br />
<br />
Paul fidgeted, and put his hands under Todd's armpits to pull him upwards.  &quot;Come on up <br />
here,&quot; his deep voice said.  While Todd was not anxious to take his mouth off Paul's cock, <br />
he compiled and was soon standing eye-to-eye with his master.  Eye-to-eye?  Todd <br />
remembered that he was four inches taller than Paul, and with his shoes it should have <br />
been five.  All the shrinking was transforming his short, hairy lust-object into a mountain <br />
of man.  This was almost more than his small dick could take as it strained for release.<br />
<br />
Paul exhibited no such concerns, if he even noticed Todd's reduction.  Leaning forward, he <br />
kissed Todd and raked his mustache across Todd's face, while jacking off with his right <br />
hand.  With his left arm, he gently moved Todd beside him, and held the shrinking man by <br />
putting the arm around Todd's shoulder.  &quot;I want you to watch,&quot; Paul explained softly, still <br />
leaning over to kiss and tickle Todd with his stiff mustache.<br />
<br />
With his closer hand, Todd reached over to support Paul's ballsac as the furry man <br />
groaned.  Paul's big dick spat out its contents, and Todd felt his body shrink suddenly.  <br />
Another spurt and Paul's balls bulged bigger in Todd's shrinking grasp.  Paul held his <br />
captive tighter as the shrinking came in waves.  Looking over, Todd was now looking up at <br />
Paul.  All this was too much for Todd's own little stiffy, which gave up its own load as <br />
Todd's eye level lowered to the top of Paul's hairy chest.  Todd whimpered and Paul held <br />
Todd closer, kissing his forehead.<br />
<br />
They stayed together for several seconds as the sexual energy ebbed away.  Paul spoke <br />
first, &quot;Do you think that settles the bill?&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd was jarred by the question and he drew away, his senses returning.  &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; he <br />
stammered.  Paul's dick was drooping -- it had to be 9 inches anyway -- and Todd <br />
released the large sex globes he had been supporting.  He looked up at Paul's large frame <br />
and marveled at what had just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better get cleaned up,&quot; Paul said, with a nod to Todd's tools.  Todd stepped away, still <br />
shaky and carefully packed everything up.  Nothing seemed quite right; all the proportions <br />
were off.  It felt like he was in a dream, so while things were off that didn't really bother <br />
him.  Carefully, his hand closed around the silver wand.  Without a word, he slipped it into <br />
the toolbox and closed the lid.  <br />
<br />
Standing up, Todd looked over at Matt's immobilized form.  The kid had seen it all, and <br />
Todd wanted to take him home.  But Paul had mopped up the cum with his shirt and was <br />
watching Todd.  Todd knew any move he made towards Matt would reveal the small <br />
captive.  In a moment of realization, Todd decided that since he had the wand, he could <br />
have any captive he wanted.  Turning away, he saw Paul had pulled up his shorts and was <br />
waiting for him.<br />
<br />
As they walked out of the room, Paul put his hand on Todd shoulder.  Its increased weight <br />
and size were apparent immediately to Todd.  &quot;Thanks for coming over,&quot; Paul said.  Todd <br />
noticed his clothes had shrunk with him, even though his tools had not.  He wondered if <br />
his keys would work when they got to his truck.<br />
<br />
Matt watched as the giants left the room together.  As Paul receded, Matt found he could <br />
move again... first his eyelids blinked, then his mouth, and finally his hands, arms, and <br />
legs.  Matt could hear the rumble of the repairman's truck engine as it drove away.<br />
<br />
Surveying the room, Matt saw Brett's small form moving towards the door.  He had to get <br />
Brett under control.  With a thought, he summoned the wand.  It appeared next to him in <br />
the box.  Pointing it in Brett's general direction, he said, &quot;I wish Brett and I were both in my <br />
room.&quot;</p>
