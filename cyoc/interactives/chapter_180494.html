<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now the marathon of transformations started. Dustin the Ostrich had mere seconds to realize that he was back to being a normal sized ostrich before full transformation gripped him. He let out a terrified squawk as the intense energy burned through him much stronger than before. Shrinking and warping, he was suddenly a panting black crow on his back in the middle of the basement. Krissi cried out and flew to his side only for him to have transformed into a much larger hawk by the time she reached him. Another quick spurt turned him into an eagle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, Dusty!&quot; Krissi stared in shock.<br />
<br />
Dustin arched his back, squawked, and grew larger still, quickly transitioning into a vulture. He managed to sit up on his talons, wings stretched out, exhausted, before he suddenly shrank down into a green parrot.<br />
<br />
Realizing what he was, he tried to speak, and was relieved as a voice emitted from his hooked beak.<br />
<br />
&quot;K-Krissi!&quot; He squawked. &quot;What&#39;s happening to-&quot;<br />
<br />
Streeeetch! He was suddenly a macaw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Krissssiiii!&quot; He groaned. &quot;H-Help...&quot;<br />
<br />
He let out a cry and closed his eyes in agony as his wings gave way to arms and his legs grew massive beneath him. He stretched out, pulled like taffy, and cried as his feathers shrank away to fur. He pitched forward onto all fours and was rather suddenly a full sized male deer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus!&quot; Krissi went wide eyed. &quot;This is insane!&quot;<br />
<br />
In shock, Dustin let out a bleat and shuddered as he shrank down into a FEMALE deer.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Dus...&quot; Krissi began, and then watched as her boyfriend helplessly shifted into a huge female MOOSE!<br />
<br />
Dustin let out a startled but oddly feminine chuff and managed to peer back at her hips, feeling the twitch of her completely female sex organs, before she was suddenly hurdling towards being a duck. Shrunken down and befeathered once more.<br />
<br />
Krissi stood waaaaay back and watched with utter amazement as it kept going.<br />
<br />
Lady Duck Dustin twinged again and let out a pained and prolonged quaaaaaaack that warped into a horse&#39;s neigh. Dustin was now a much younger colt horse, and only had a few moments to process his shrunken down and deaged state, as well as the fact he had a dick again, before he surged forward into a gorgeous Arabian mare. This in turn suddenly warped into a startled and studly Belgian draft, and then a rather exhausted looking male goat, who fell onto his knees panting.<br />
<br />
For the moment, he seemed to hold shape. Krissi approached carefully, horrified again, and no sooner did she get close to him than Dustin&#39;s head snapped up, his square pupils widening as a hardened horn began to grow from his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHHHH!&quot; Krissi screamed, ducking out of the way as huge white rhinoceros surged forward from the goat, filling out and grunting in transformative agony. Huffing heavily, his great chest heaving, the rhino let out a tired whimper of dread as he felt it starting again... but this was a little slower. The rhino shrank back down into a horse once more. Just a typical male quarter horse with a tawny hide. As he approached his full form, the horse felt it winding down once more and collapsed onto his knees, shaking with complete and utter exhaustion.<br />
<br />
Krissi shook in the darkened corner, staring at the late night lighting of a rising moon in which she could see a sweating and dishelved stallion lying in the middle of the ruined basement furniture and panting desperately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, now...&quot; Krissi whispered, carefully approaching. &quot;Easy, buddy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded, tongue hanging out, and Krissi caught the smell of a hot animal as she stood by his side and stared at the horse in utter fascination.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-That was quite a show.&quot; She gulped. &quot;How about we... we...&quot;<br />
<br />
SKIRCH! The horse grew a little more muscular. A little heavier. A little more filled out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay...&quot; Krissi backed away gently. &quot;Maybe I should just leave you alone, huh? Maybe it&#39;s me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin grunted suddenly and surged further, becoming a hunk of thick horsemeat.<br />
<br />
Krissi gulped. &quot;Guess not.&quot;<br />
<br />
The horse panted harder and tried to stand, managing only to get halfway before he rapidly shrank into a beautiful and lean white mare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoaaaa...&quot; Krissi stared in awe.<br />
<br />
Dustin began to cry. What was happening to him? When was it going to stop? He was so tired! SHE was so tired! Krissi saw the glint of tears in the deepening moonlight and whimpered, scared to get close.<br />
<br />
For all she knew he might start turning into an elephant or something!<br />
<br />
CRICK! The mare whinnied in terror as she felt a BIG change coming on! Her legs started to thicken. She defiantly gritted her teeth and tried to resist it. She was utterly fed up!<br />
<br />
BULGE! She tried as hard as she could to stop it as her hindquarters thickened and her fur began to fade into gray skin.<br />
<br />
Krissi&#39;s eyes widened in shock. She... she... had...<br />
<br />
SWELL! Dustin&#39;s head fell down and she trembled madly in pure willpower. Please don&#39;t. Please don&#39;t make me change again. Her ears suddenly burst forward into the shape of an elephant&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Krissi&#39;s jaw dropped as Dustin&#39;s nose began to elongate away from her snout. No. No. Not an elephant.<br />
<br />
Dustin pitched forward and collapsed in complete physical and mental exhaustion as her body returned to that of the mare. She felt it pass. She smiled dopily, big equine teeth grinning. She had done it! She had resisted the changes!<br />
<br />
Krissi stepped forward carefully. Dustin the white mare looked at her triumphantly, eyes glistening with tears of relief.<br />
<br />
Make her more beautiful.<br />
<br />
The mare suddenly jolted and looked on herself in horror for a moment before finding that her features were changing. The horse grew leaner, firmer, more shapely. Pockets of fat shrank down. Musculature tightened. Her lines and curves accentuated. Her mane and tail grew longer. She sprouted long dark lashes. Larger cuter eyes. Her hooves grew glossy and polished, her coat shinier.<br />
<br />
Krissi took a few more steps further and began to comprehend. She... hadn&#39;t willed the other changes. They had been... out of control. Random. Unguided. She... she... she... needed to control him. She could do whatever she wanted to him.<br />
<br />
Or... her, in this case. Krissi urged Dustin... Dusty... Dustine? Oh, that was lovely! Yes, Dustine the mare. Krissi urged her beautiful new mare to regain all of her lost stamina.<br />
<br />
The striking white mare stood suddenly, her muscles no longer tired. Her breathing was calm and her spirit was reinvigorated. The horse blinked several times.<br />
<br />
Krissi gulped and put her hand on Dustine&#39;s side. She ran her fingers through her plush and sensual fur. It didn&#39;t even feel like horsehair anymore. It was... it was like perfect rich fluffy blanket.<br />
<br />
You can speak now, Krissi urged. Let her have her human speech back.<br />
<br />
Dustin...Dustine... felt a tug in her throat and coughed suddenly, taking a deep breath and realizing something had happened in her throat. &quot;W-What?&quot; The horse said, shocked by her sweet melodious voice. She pranced suddenly, excited. &quot;K-Krissi! Krissi! I can talk again! I can talk!&quot; The mare looked over to her girlfriend excitedly and they shared an excited hop together!<br />
<br />
More female. Kinder. Gentler. More feminine in mannerism. Krissi was astonished. She... felt a connection. A... control.<br />
<br />
Dustine blinked for a moment and swayed a little as her head swam. &quot;Ohhh...&quot; She looked around the basement and looked down sadly, embarassed. &quot;Ohhh, I&#39;ve really messed things up, haven&#39;t I? Your parents are going to be so angry with us! I&#39;m so sorry, my love!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It-it&#39;s okay,&quot; Krissi whispered, reassuring the horse with a long and loving embrace against her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;That feels lovely.&quot; Dustine grinned, closing her eyes.<br />
<br />
More feminine. Less Dustin. More Dustine. Calm, intelligent, gentle, nuturing, compassionate, strong, motherly. Krissi gulped. She was getting bolder now.<br />
<br />
Again, Dustine swayed on her legs and clacked her hooves on the cement loudly. &quot;Oh dear, I&#39;m so shaky, darling. I-I don&#39;t know what&#39;s come over me. I&#39;m... I&#39;m foggy. Perhaps all these strange transfigurations are finally catching up to me. I might be in shock!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, my love.&quot; Krissi consoled. She wanted a woman. She wanted Dustin to turn fully into Dustine. No more Dustin. Only her perfect horse girlfriend. Loving. Devoted. Everything.<br />
<br />
The mare staggered and seemed to gasp for breath. &quot;Krissi, my love! I&#39;m changing again! Please, stay close to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will.&quot; Krissi promised, bending down as Dustine fell onto all fours and tensed. Her back trembled as her spine began to alter. Her front hooves began to split into fingernails. The fingers soon followed. Her front joints cracked as she gained arms. She remained lithe, athletic, toned, as the barrel of her horse body began to humanize. Her back legs lessened, her rear end shrank, her vulva pulled down.<br />
<br />
Taller than me, Krissi commanded. I want her to stand over me and protect me.<br />
<br />
Dustine complied, as she turned anthromorphic and grew more feminine by the second, her height began to increase little by little. She aged forward. She grew to an adult. Her breasts expanded on her chest and the rich plush of her fur only grew more fantastic, almost shaggy. In moments, Krissi was kneeling in front of a gorgeous and impossibly attractive mare woman. Just as she had desired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange.&quot; Dustine whispered, her voice smooth and feminine, full of character and a thoughtful compassion. She sat up on her thighs and looked over her front, pleased at the sight of her ample breasts and toned muscles. &quot;I can&#39;t remember who I used to be.&quot; She held up her hand and examined it gently, turning it from top to palm and examining her long and manicured fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter anymore.&quot; Krissi offered, smiling as the mare took her hands in hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not, my love.&quot; Dustine smiled back warmly. Her face was warm and expressive. Her eyes twinkled. &quot;All that matters is my devotion to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mare sniffed slightly and raised to stand with Krissi. &quot;My goodness, you smell so strongly of a male. Or... rather... an inhuman male. Do you desire the company of a male? Do you wish to end our relationship? I should only wish for your happiness, darling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was... that was old you.&quot; Krissi admitted, startled by the sudden turn and how much it pained her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was it?&quot; Dustine cocked her head in fascination. &quot;Oh dear, I must have been quite a brute to soil you in such a manner. May I offer to bathe you, my love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I would...&quot; Krissi blinked, looking around the destroyed basement. &quot;I would love that, Dustine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, splendid! There is so much cleaning up to do down here, but it will be my pleasure to run you a nice soothing bath.&quot; With that, Dustine released Krissi&#39;s hands and bowed gracefully.<br />
<br />
The human blinked several times as her devoted horse woman turned towards the stairs and excitedly clopped up the wood to run her girlfriend a nice bath.</p>
