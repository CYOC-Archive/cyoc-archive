<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking into the study, Megan took a seat, she brought up the Chronovac on the screen. &quot;Okay, time to play with the new girl...&quot; She typed in a few keys and the screen showed Will's office building, highlighting on him. It pictured him at his desk, going over paperwork. She smirked. &quot;Busy little bee, lets play a little.&quot; She once more typed away at the computer, making everyone but Will unaware of any changes that were to take place or that anything was out of the ordinary. She set the time limit for how long he'd be at work. Next she worked on the changes themselves, she began thinking of how to make Will's day more interesting. A smirk covered her face. &quot;Oh I know how to have some fun.&quot;  <br />
 <br />
Megan first brought up Will's profile, she changed his pants into a short knee high skirt, exposing his shapely calves. Next she changed his shoes into a pair of Maryjanes, she noted how tiny Will's feet had become. &quot;Mine are too big now.&quot; She thought to herself. Megan studied him for a moment, then decided to leave the jacket and shirt as they were. But she clicked on his nipples, making them stiff and very sensitive areola's. &quot;He's gonna start to feel that soon.&quot; She chuckled, moving on to his libido, Megan increased it a bit, making sure that arousal was easily achievable. <br />
 <br />
Clicking on the apply key, she had seen earlier that when Will walked into his office that he checked out his secretary Melinda a good deal without her even noticing. Melinda had been over to their house plenty of times in the past and Megan knew she was a stunningly beautiful brunette. &quot;I always knew she was too attractive for his own good. Guess he'll get to really enjoy the view today.&quot; She changed Melinda's clothes slightly, showing off her breasts in a low cut cardigan and made it so she was not wearing a bra either. She wore a black mini-skirt that showed off her tan sensuous legs. &quot;That's enough for her...but she is looking rather tasty&quot; She said admitting she'd started to find women more attractive now.<br />
 <br />
Will felt a cool breeze rush over him, and his legs felt much more cool. His hands reached down to rub them a little to warm up. Immediately he felt his bare skin, he stood up, thinking he'd ripped his new pants already, and was shocked to find a skirt that fell to just above his knees. It was like something he saw the younger interns wearing. His mouth was wide open, but he had little time to react as Melinda walked into the room, she glanced at his skirt covered legs, smiling. <br />
 <br />
&quot;You look great today 'Mr.' (she seemed to inflect a different meaning in her tone than before) Bower.&quot; Mel walked over to Will's desk, she bent over slightly, putting a few papers on his desk, seemingly oblivious to the fact that her boss was now wearing a skirt. As she bent over, Will got a great look at her unhindered cleavage. He felt a warmth spread from his groin, he couldn't take his eyes off her, a part of him wanted to take her right there in his office, even if he didn't have the right equipment to do so. She glanced up at him, he flushed red caught in the act of staring. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Uh, Mel...&quot; He said, trying to distract her from his obvious staring. &quot;Do you notice anything different about me?' Will asked, nervously.<br />
 <br />
She looked him up and down, shaking her head. &quot;No, do you mean those new ruffled ankle socks you're wearing? They look adorable on you.&quot; Mel giggled as Will's eyes looked to his feet, the shoes and socks of a high school girl now adorned his smaller feet. &quot;Oh, Mr. Bower, the meeting with the board is in five minutes.&quot; She said turning to walk back to her desk, her hips swayed seductively, making Will's excitement shoot up again. He could feel his hole growing uncontrollable wet, a small trickle of his own juices tickled his leg. &quot;What the hell...I should've worn those panties.&quot; It was at that moment that Will felt the curse was telling him to do whatever Megan told him.<br />
 <br />
After wiping himself dry with a tissue, he figured that if his own secretary didn't think anything was wrong, then he was probably ok with everyone else to. Grabbing his briefcase, Will walked out of his office, avoiding eye contact with Melinda. He walked into the board room, at least there were no girls there to excite him too much. He noticed that his jacket was making his chest hurt, it was pushing down on his shirt, causing it to rub uncomfortably. Shrugging, he figured he could deal without the jacket and threw it on the coat rack. Unbeknownst to him, his nipples poked out so much that it was easily noticble through the thin material. The two extra open buttons made the shirt hang loosely on his shrinking frame.<br />
 <br />
Megan smiled, &quot;Oh those nipples must've been raw by now.&quot; She deleted a couple more buttons, making his shirt barely closed, his breasts could be seen easily with every movement. Selecting all the men in the building, she made them all very grabby toward Will, even the slightest greeting would become a grope session. Clicking on Will, she made him enjoy being touched, even though he still liked girls he'd enjoy being groped by the men, while they enjoyed it as well, they felt it as normal. Again she made it so everything would revert at the end of the day.<br />
 <br />
Will walked over to one of the board members, he bent over to shake his hand, the man extended his hand as well, however he reached past Will's and under his skirt, fondling his soft rear end in his firm hand. Will at first was appauled, but slowly the warm feeling spread through his body. The dampness returned between his legs. The man spoke. &quot;Will, you're doing a great job with the new account, I expect you'll be doing great things.&quot; His hand squeezed Will's ass hard, causing him to moan sharply as he suddenly stopped. Will's eyes grew wide, looking around embarrassed, but everyone just continued chattering with one another.<br />
 <br />
Quickly Will sat in his chair, thinking that this all must be some kind of horrible nightmare. He was just groped by one of the board me members...of course, stranger things had happened already. He crossed his legs, a hand shot to his crotch, he was once again sopping wet down there. Jacob entered the board room, walking straight to Will, Will feared the worst and prayed for him to not bother coming over to him. But to Will dismay, Jacob came right over, his hands shot under Will's loose purple shirt. His hands cupped his breasts roughly. Will's mind exploded at the sensation, his nipples had become so sensitive he could barely think. A small moan escaped his lips. Again the feeling was brief, Jacob went over to his seat.<br />
 <br />
For several minutes, the board members greeted him, each of them having their own unique way of saying hi to him. They seemingly avoided actually trying to accomplish anything, which after a while, Will seemed to almost beg for them to keep going. Each ignored his pleas and continued to their seats. They didn't seem to notice he was a girl past the groping. The meeting finally got going and Will seemed to be able to calm himself down. He wouldn't be able to avoid every guy in the office. But he couldn't stand the thought of being assaulted by any more of these men.<br />
 <br />
As the meeting ended, Will quickly darted out, forgetting all about his jacket and briefcase, he needed to be in his office, alone. As ran, he felt the material of his skirt flailing about. He ran into Melinda, who seemed to be waiting for him.<br />
 <br />
Megan worked her magic and made Melinda highly attracted to Will, waiting to see the results. She slowly began to pump her cock, thinking of how hot this was, seeing one of the most gorgeous girls in the office about to play with her now feminine boss. She held Will tightly in her grasp, her soft hands a sharp contrast to the hands that had groped him earlier. He was to intoxicated with the waves of pleasure coming from just her touch. Melinda reached under Will's skirt, pulling it up so he was exposed to the entire office. His plumping rear felt great in her hands. <br />
 <br />
Will's protests faded into girlish gasps. Her hands slowly came to the front of Will's crotch, she probed her manicured hand into his waiting void. Will felt himself give into the feeling, he wanted it to continue more than anything. Melinda began groping Will's breasts through the shirt. Melinda kneeled down so she was eye-level with Will's crotch. She looked up at him before she lapped away at his crotch, licking and probing her tongue into him. Will's hips began to push forward, wanting more. Will's mind was gone in a haze of ecstasy, Melinda knew exactly how to flick his little clit to send shivers of pleasure through him, her hands gripped his exposed rear, it felt plump in her hands. Her tongue plunged deeply into his excited sex, each passing moment felt like an eternity of ecstasy for Will. Finally he screamed as a crushing wave of pleasure hit him.<br />
 <br />
Melinda stood. &quot;Mmm..you taste really good Mr. Bower.&quot; Will could barely think, but her words made him feel a deep level of shame, what made matters worse, she stood, kissing him deeply, he could taste his own juices, he returned her kiss, their tongue's interlocking. After a few minutes of sensuous kissing, Melinda backed away and went back to her desk as if nothing happened. He felt a thousand eyes were watching them. His knees were wobbly, his eyes glanced around, every man had watched the scene intently. He felt so embarrassed, he walked back toward his office, not noticing his skirt was still up, giving everyone a good view of himself down below. His knees were still a bit shakie walking into the office. <br />
<br />
Will fell into his chair, a cool feeling hit him as he realized his skirt was still raised. He quickly pulled it back down over his thighs, his senses slowly returning to him. &quot;What the hell is going on...I don't think I can handle much more of this.&quot; A tear welled up in his eye. His emotions were getting the better of him and he knew that is was only a matter of time now before things were complete. &quot;Stupid curse, what did I do that was so wrong? I don't deserve this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan smirked, turning off the computer. &quot;He's been a good sport through all of this. I hope he can handle what I've got planned for the next couple weeks. Then when he thinks there's no hope of returning to normal...I'll let him in on the joke.&quot; She rubbed her stubbly chin. &quot;I'll have to make sure he doesn't try and get any revenge on me when he goes back to normal.&quot; She shrugged, figuring she had a while to figure that out, turning in her chair she got up and walked off to work on her other plans for Will.<br />
<br />
Will went back to his private bathroom, he closed the door, making sure it was locked behind him. &quot;No repeat performances. He slowly stripped out of the clothes. He looked in the mirror, his hair had become disheveled, it had fallen softly onto his face, giving him a more girlish look. He could swear that his breasts looked much bigger than at the start of the day. It wasn't really hard to imagine at this point. They looked small still, around A-cup, but he definitely needed more than a training bra now. His hips and ass looked like they'd changed in minor ways too. His hips had begun to flare out more, giving him the beginnings of an hour glass figure. Still, his face looked like his, even if it was slowly fading. <br />
<br />
Shrugging, at least it looked like Will was going to be an attractive woman, in a way that eased his mind. He turned the water on and waited for it to warm up. Looking down at himself, he noticed that his nipples had been erect since he'd walked in, even Megan's needed some kind of stimulation to keep them that way. A finger ran over them, sending tickles of pleasure through him. He smiled slightly, he'd never admit it out loud, but he was growing to like the feeling of his nipples being played with. A hand rubbed his raw sex, it felt a little sore now from being played with by Melinda. He shuddered slightly at the thought, he'd always had a thing for her, but he never thought he'd be a chick were anything to happen.<br />
<br />
He stepped into the shower, washing away all of his own juices. The feeling relaxed him and he took only a few moment to clean himself off. His hands ran over his smaller frame, he couldn't believe how different it was from his former male body. He had curves, soft skin, not to mention smooth to the touch. After several minutes, he turned the shower off, grabbing a towel and slowly toweling himself off. He wrapped the towel around his waist at first, not even thinking about it. He was just about to walk out to his office, stopping himself to fix his little mistake. Wrapping it around his newfound breasts, he walked out to the office, closing the shades and locking the door.<br />
<br />
He discarded the towel and walked to his private dresser, feeling actually more comfortable in the buff. Since he obviously couldn't wear the same outfit, it was drenched in his juices, he had to find something better to wear. Rummaging, he found some of his favorite pants and shirt, even a pair of boxers, he pulled them all on, completing the outfit with a pair of socks. The outfit was obviously too big on him, but he didn't care. &quot;At least their guys' clothes.&quot; The clothes seemed to take that as a que, a they started to morph right before Will's eyes. The shirt and pants seemed to mold together, becoming one, while they pant legs let go at the seams, slowly crawly up his legs. The socks slowly crawled to opposite direction.<br />
<br />
Finally everything stopped, what Will was left with was a lacey sundress was now in the place of his male clothes. It was a grayish blue and had small straps which hung neatly on his shoulders, showing them and his arms off nicely. It fell to just above mid-thigh. His wet hair fell against his bare back. Through the thin material he could tell he was still not wearing a bra, his nipples poked defiantly against the fabric which showed his nice perky tits off. He reached to his crotch, hoping that the curse had at least left him the dignity of boxers. Nope, he felt bare crotch, he was left with no underwear what-so-ever. &quot;Oh come on...&quot; He shut up, fearing any more retaliations from the curse. (Remember, he doesn't know anything of what going on) Looking down at his feet, he noticed the socks had morphed into the frilly ankle socks like the ones he had on earlier. They made his daintier feet look kind of cute. (Author's note: I say kind of because they're still bigger than a woman's foot should normally be.)<br />
<br />
Sighing, he was content with what he was wearing, so he got to his desk and began working on his project. He'd have to finish either today or tomorrow, cuz that was as long as he could pass for himself. Several knocks came from the door, he yelled out that he didn't want to be disturbed, he feared more groping...or worse. Working straight through, he saw the clock strike five and instantly a flash ran through the office. Looking around, nothing seemed to have changed. Will looking down at himself, discovered his clothes were back to what Megan had left him this morning. He sighed relieved. &quot;Thank goodness.&quot; He got up, taking his work with him. <br />
<br />
Walking by Melinda, Will tried to get a reaction, there was nothing but a friendly g'night. Nodding, he walked by several guys, testing the groping, again nothing. Smirking, he walked out of the building, feeling a little better that those changes weren't permanent. Getting into his Jaguar, he thought about going home. But he'd have to face Megan and she'd no doubt have something odd for them to do, he thought about his options for a few minutes and decided...</p>
