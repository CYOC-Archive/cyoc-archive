<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-First Half in the Perspective of Gabriella-<br />
<br />
Three days following the disappearance of the detective:<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got a bead on the signature right here.&quot; The young woman adjusted the thin framed glasses on the bridge of her nose. Wavy blue hair hung just above her slender shoulders framing her sharp facial features. Adorned in a royal blue dress shirt and khaki dress pants, she struck a rather tomboyish figure. Her left hand rested on her gently curving hip as she pursed her lips in consternation. As she brought her right hand over her modest chest to rub her left shoulder she cast her azure colored eyes toward the rest of her group. <br />
<br />
To her left stood the most petite of their group with her tousled tawny hair playfully bobbing over her small face. Her pale green eyes jumping from rusted barrels to shattered windows over to fallen debris. A giggle coursed its way through her as she made to speak. &quot;Oh boy, if we came at night, this place would look super spooky.&quot; She was dressed as daintily as her form with a lacy sundress hanging from her shoulders down to her calves. It didn&#39;t leave too much to the imagination but, there wasn&#39;t much to gather that sort of attention anyhow. <br />
<br />
Just a ways over from the petite girl was another who stood hunched over with her moderately sized bosom cradled by her arms. Black hair messily hung over her face at the moment as she too scanned the area with a look of fearful concern. &quot;O-o-oh... I was telling you we shouldn&#39;t have come here... I can feel them watching me from everywhere.&quot; Her clothes where a baggy mess of sweats that hid her figure well enough on their own. If she ever worked out none of them were aware due in part to her reclusive nature. It took more than a small amount of convincing to drag her out today but, she was useful in her own way. Her paranormal senses could alert her to any supernatural presences nearby and yet this left her quite paranoid...<br />
<br />
Watching out by the gate, looking as tall, broad, and incredibly butch as she always did was the muscle of the group. Standing a good head above the rest of them she cut an impressively imposing figure. More than once those large arms had dealt with anyone or thing that caused them an issue. Her brown hair had been cut into a short, spiky affair fading down the sides of her broad face. A look of vigilant discipline settled in her amber eyes as she stared out beyond the gate for any uninvited company. Even though they have bought off the police for their recreational investigation, she had insisted on keeping a look out.<br />
<br />
Farther to the right, was the belle of the ball. Always looking the the peak of femininity from her make up to that absurdly proportioned body was their de-facto leader. Long blonde hair tied back into a ponytail with a sizeable red bow with a flick of back resting against her nose. Her blue eyes shown proudly as she surveyed the rest of them as well, her large chest puffed out in her stance, and her hands firmly grasping her hips. She licked her glossy lips and nodded firmly as their gazes met. &quot;Then, it&#39;s as you deduced. Someone spirited away the dear detective that night and it&#39;s going to be up to us this time around again.&quot; She laughed triumphantly as she always did when it came time for the game to be afoot.<br />
<br />
Whilst they conducted their investigation of the work yard, the figure stood uncertainly gripping a vial in her hands. &quot;Oh, I hope this goes according to the letter...&quot; Taking a deep breath, the mystery girl ran to her position behind the placed statuette and threw the vial to the ground. Within seconds a purple cloud enveloped the area within the building, whereas she couldn&#39;t see them anymore apparently the group outside had noticed and was rushing toward her. Readying herself as best she could she stepped through the fog hearing them enter the building. <br />
<br />
As the five entered the the building, they were met with the scene of a purple fog pluming backward from a small golden statuette of a prostrated woman hanging by her arms from a set of scales. There wasn&#39;t anytime from observing the scene before them that a young woman stepped forth from the fog. Her face was shrouded by a dark hooded cloak like something out of an old story book. The scene&#39;s tension was immediately ruined when their muscle stepped forward and the mysterious girl stumbled backward and fell. She stood almost immediately after and surprisingly the hood had remained in place. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on there! I want to help you all, don&#39;t come after me like I did it!&quot; The young woman shouted defiantly and waited for a step backward from their imposing member before continuing. &quot;Hmpf, there we go, anyways... I&#39;m here because you&#39;ve no doubt been aroused to the threat coming to your humble city. This threat in particular will be unlike any you&#39;ve faced before. So it is here before this altar of justice that we meet to give you power necessary to defend yourselves from it.&quot; With that rather scripted sounding decree, the mysterious woman produced five golden bracelets from a pouch at her side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Step forward and take a bracelet from my hand as you are called. Scarlet Reid collect your bracelet, please.&quot; Scarlet, their leader stepped forward cautiously while Freya cringed harder with every step she took toward that outstretched hand. When the bracelet was taken and Scarlet stepped away, the rest seemed to relax. The next to recieve a bracelet was Mollie, their petite member collected her bracelet and skipped away ogling it with a trill giggle. Rita almost lumbered forward with a sly grin as she caught sight of a small tremble in that hand holding a bracelet toward her. Freya was the next to tremble as she timidly pushed forward and snatched the bracelet scurrying back away.<br />
<br />
Finally, it was Gabriella&#39;s turn as she stepped forward to accept her bracelet she scanned the statuette placed on the ground. This was an odd place for some &quot;relic of justice&quot; to be sited. If this woman had been here for some time, why hadn&#39;t she appeared sooner... Might she have been part of the disappearance or was she as she claimed. Just before she accepted the bracelet, Gabriella grabbed the young woman&#39;s wrist and attempted to stare into the darkness below that hood. &quot;Don&#39;t you all think this is just too convenient? She appears at the same time some &quot;threat&quot; does? How do we know for sure it wasn&#39;t her in the first place? What if these bracelets mark us as next?&quot; Gabriella&#39;s words rolled into a low growl as she continued. The others stared at their bracelets in thought although Mollie was already wearing her&#39;s and seemed to be having a battle of sparkles between it&#39;s gem and her eyes. <br />
<br />
Scarlet looked up from her bracelet and stared at Gabriella. &quot;Take note of the signature of the magic on her and the statue. If they come up again, we&#39;ll deal with her. If they don&#39;t we could assume what she&#39;s saying has some truth to it...&quot; Rita and Mollie nodded in agreement to her assessment while Freya seemed even more concerned than she had been prior. With a huff, Gabriella eyed the mysterious woman once more and let go of her wrist, swiping the bracelet in the process. It was after they all stood close again they noticed that each bracelet sported a different gem. Scarlet had a ruby, Mollie&#39;s shown an opal, Rita&#39;s sported an amethyst, Freya&#39;s held an emerald, and almost fittingly Gabriella&#39;s wore a sapphire.<br />
<br />
Rubbing her wrist, the mysterious woman looked toward their group. &quot;You will all be safe from this threat so long as the bracelet is worn. Should you need to speak with me again, you can reach out to me through them and we will meet here once more. Ah! I nearly forgot to give you my name, it is Amarin... Just touch the gemstone with my name in mind and I will meet you here.&quot; She nodded resolutely and with another gout of purple smoke, she was gone with the statuette as it cleared. The five departed remarking on the bracelets as they returned to the previous scene for further investigation. From behind the building they were in, Marina clutched both her chest and the detective with her hands panting heavily. &quot;Oooohh... I thought the big one was going to kill me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Across the city as the meeting took place:<br />
<br />
Alex strut about with the feeling of power still tingling in his hands. Now that the detective who&#39;d put him away was just a mantle piece, he felt as if there was little in the world that could stop him. On his mental list was the judge who&#39;d sent him away to prison and the bitch who&#39;d been dumb enough to give him this power. Oh, wouldn&#39;t she just make the perfect little fuck toy with that snappy mouth of hers. Wouldn&#39;t be so high and mighty with a dick in them lips. He shuddered softly with a deep breath as he looked around him. Damn, that got him all bothered and raring to acquaint another person or two with his power. Just needed a place that wouldn&#39;t draw too much attention... It was when he looked at a bookstore across the way, he&#39;d found his mark. <br />
<br />
He stepped inside and walked around the small interior &quot;browsing the books&quot; while he took stock of those inside. Currently, the was a mousey little red hair reading a book in a plush chair in the back and up toward the front was the clerk at the register. The clerk had a fair enough body hidden underneath those clothes to do the job he&#39;d figured. First thing first he thought, as he approached the red head in the back. &quot;Can&#39;t leave too much evidence...&quot; He muttered low enough to elicit a confused glance from the red head before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry?&quot; she said as she started to set the book down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know but, you&#39;ll do.&quot; He responded with a sneer as the purple tendrils of power extended into his arms and around the unfortunate woman. Her mouth opened to scream and the tendrils slipped in stifling her voice before it left her. Her struggle was held nearly in check as her arms and legs fused into her torso. Her clothing silently shredding into dust revealing her flat figure underneath, a fuzzy red bush complimented by the heavy dusting on freckles on her body. With her arms and legs fused into her torso, her vagina gaped wider and wider as it spread out underneath her body. Once it was nearly a perfect circle, she began to feel her body hollow from her vagina upward as a slow pace. It made her feel as if she were lightheaded fading to nothing as it finished that the new nub on her head. The finish touches were the rubber sheen that glossed her body as it rolled up from underneath and shrank to a small circle the size of a half dollar. Picking up the woman become condom, he chuckled seeing the euphoric smile on her imprinted face in the center. &quot;Yeah, you&#39;ll do nicely.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he approached the front, the clerk looked over to him. &quot;Everything alright back there?&quot; Apparently she&#39;d heard a little something... No matter... <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just had a little trouble finding what I wanted.&quot; He said holding the prior woman in the palm of his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, did you want any help?&quot; She hopped off the stool she&#39;d been on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I&#39;ve found just the book I was looking for...&quot; Once more the tendrils stretched to him and then his victim. Unlike the last, she seemed to freeze in fright when the tendrils reached her. Her clothing eroded as the purple glow enveloped her still frame that was losing depth as the power washed over her. As her body lost depth it seemed to make up for it by flattening out into a rectangular shape. Alex took a moment to admired those breasts as they sunk into her flattened chest. Almost surprised enough to step back the woman folded forward by her waist slapping against her widened legs and feet. The image of the back of her body faded into nothing before being replaced shortly after with images of her supine form in sultry poses. Waiting for the change to finish making her the proper size, Alex reached down and picked up the porn magazine off of the ground where it laid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just my kind of book.&quot; He chuckled ogling the front cover hungrily. &quot;Don&#39;t need to be disturbed though...&quot; A quick search rewarded him with the keys to the store and he locked the door flipping the sign to closed. Sauntering to the back where he had found the red head, he sat in the plush chair undoing his pants. As the fly came down, his dick sprung free of its prison as eager as he. He licked his lips as he unrolled the red head onto his dick taking in the image of her riding atop it for the show to come. With a satisfied sigh, he settled in to stroking her and him as he turned page after page. &quot;Where do I go from here?&quot; He laughed heartily as he reached toward his crescendo.</p>
