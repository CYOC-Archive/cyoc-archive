<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kate arrived home and found Stella, wearing only underwear, waiting for her. !but, as promising sex with Stella was, Kate&#39;s attention was attracted by a notification: she juste got another email frome Annie, with the fourth video attached. This time, Annie didn&#39;t even bother to forge a pretend why she was sending the video. Her email contain only one word, one command: &quot;Watch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate and Stella immediately sat together on the couch and watched the video. Emily appeared once more, now completely naked, standing beneath a cascading waterfall on a sun-drenched island. Her voice was softer, almost like a whisper inside their minds.<br />
<br />
“The time has come. Let the lesbian inside you awaken. She has always been there… waiting.”<br />
<br />
The video unfolded into a lush montage of women making love in sacred temples, in moonlit gardens, in the sea. Bodies entwined, movements slow and reverent. There was no shame. Only worship. Every touch was ritual, every female orgasm a prayer.<br />
<br />
Kate and Stella watched in silence, spellbound. No physical transformation occured. But mentally, Stella&#39;s identity was changed forever.<br />
<br />
Stella whispered, than said aloud: &quot;I&#39;m a woman ! That&#39;s who I truely am. I&#39;m sorry, Kate, but your boyfriend was a transwoman all along.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate kissed Stella and said: &quot;It just means I was a lesbian all along, since I&#39;ve been dating my trans-girlfriend for 5 years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate and Stella cried of joy, they felt so free as they accepted who they were.<br />
<br />
“I think,” said Kate softly, “we should go out to celebrate. On a date.”<br />
<br />
Stella smiled, her eyes hopeful. “Like... as two girlfriends?”<br />
<br />
“Of course! And we’ll go on a proper date. Just the two of us. No hiding.”<br />
<br />
They kissed. Then, they dressed up for their date. Kate wore a short red dress, red high-heeled boots, and lipstick. Stella wore a soft lavender blouse, a black skirt that flattered her curves, and sheer stockings. Her makeup was subtle but elegant, and her long brown hair was styled into soft waves. She wore silver earrings with jasper.<br />
<br />
Kate and Stella dined at a small restaurant near the river. They drank wine. Held hands over the table. Laughed. Talked about everything and nothing. To the outside world, they looked like two beautiful women in love. But for Kate and Stella, it was more than just appearances. It was the best date they had ever had. Everything felt natural and true. They didn&#39;t mind the way other people were looking at them, or what they thought about their couple. Kate and Stella were simply happy to be together.<br />
<br />
Later that night, they came home. They removed each other clothes and lay together in bed, wrapped in the soft glow of the bedside lamp. Their bodies pressed close, skin warm against skin, breathing synchronized. Their kisses were unhurried, delicate, and filled with quiet reverence. Stella’s hands explored Kate’s body like sacred ground—familiar yet mysteriously different. Every curve, every sigh, every response was a revelation. Kate, in turn, caressed Stella’s newly soft chest with infinite tenderness, kissing her collarbone, her lips, her neck, as though each inch of her was a promise finally fulfilled. Stella gasped when Kate kissed her breasts, which were even more sensitive than before, and she felt her body becoming warmer. Stella fingered Kate&#39;s wet pussy while Kate worked on Stella&#39;s small but still sentitive penis. Their lovemaking became more passionate, their moves quicker, their pleasure increased until their mind went blank as they orgasmed.<br />
<br />
After a short recess, Stella wanted more. She gave the lubricated strap-on she had bought in the afternoon and asked Kate to take her from behind, to fuck her asshole with the strap-on.<br />
<br />
Kated was tempted, byt objected: &quot;You never did this before. It can be painful the first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Stella revealed: &quot;I wore a butplug this whole afternoon. I am ready. I want to feel you inside me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kated noted and wore the strap-on. Stella moaned as she felt it inside her. It was rougher as she imagined, but Stella loved the fact Kate was penetrating her. Kate, discovered she liked to be the dominant partner of their relationship. Once again, Stella felt the pleasure (albeit a different kind of pleasure) overwhelming her mind, and she orgasmed again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, completely exhausted, Kate and Stella fell asleep. And they had the same dream. The island was there, under the bright sun, populated by impossibly beautiful women dancing in waves of pleasure. Kate and Stella reached the shore. But as soon as their feet touched the sand, they were separated.<br />
<br />
Kate was cast once more into the maze, and at each intersection, she chose the path marked with the Venus symbol. This time, however, it was different. The maze was quiet and empty, no statues blocking her path. Only at the very end did she encounter a single obstacle: a plaster statue of Stanley, frozen in his old masculine form. At the statue’s feet lay a hammer shaped like a double Venus symbol. Kate didn’t hesitate. Stanley was just her ex-boyfriend - she was dating Stella. She picked up the hammer and struck the statue. It shattered instantly, so the last obstacle was removed. She stepped into the sunlight and took her first breath of the Island’s sea air: Kate was free.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Stella was shackled once more to a cold stone wall. Once more, she prayed not for brute strength, but for agility. Slowly, she twisted and contorted her agile body, slipping free from the chains, one by one. A final chain remained, fastened directly to her penis. Stella took a deep breath. And with focused calm, she pressed inward—gently pushing her shrinking member into her own body. As it disappeared, the last chain fell on the ground. She stood up, her hands trembling, her eyes wide with joy. She was no longer Stanley. She was Stella, and she was free.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kate and Stella ran to each other across the dreamscape. They embraced. And together, hand in hand, they walked towards the group of women having a lesbian orgy. But, just before they could join them, they were stopped by an invisible barrier. Kate and Stella cursed, calling this unfair. <br />
<br />
But a dominating but familiar voice spoke from beyond the veil:  “You may be lesbians. But you are not yet fully true to yourselves. You must surrender not only to each other... but to your deepest desires. Only then will you belong to the Cult of Lesbos.”<br />
<br />
Still dreaming, still holding each other, Kate and Stella whispered as one: “I will surrender and join the Cult of Lesbos.”</p>
