<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well no wonder Helen is suffering from an intense heat cycle; “Doctor Tora Tachibana reading some test results; “she was given the wrong were-birth control pills.”<br />
“So my sister will be alright,” a man with a broken arm looking concerned; having to head to his sisters place and look for her pills, he was naturally concerned when Doctor Tachibana called him and informed him of her situation.<br />
“Unfortunately no Andy,” doctor Tachibana putting down the test results; “we know the cause of her condition; the next step is giving her the proper treatment.”<br />
“What were-birth control pills was Helen taking,” Andy looking at doctor Tachibana.<br />
“Believe it or not,” doctor Tora sighing; “the ones tailored made for a were-lioness. Andy,” doctor Tora looking at the off duty paramedic; “the little white pills as most affectionately call them are indistinguishable from each other. Size and shape. Somewhere between manufacturing and shipping, your sister was given the wrong batch. Rest assured,” Tora getting up from his desk and chair; “I will be informing my grandmother of this and corrective actions will be made to ensure this doesn’t happen again.”<br />
“But my sister,” Andy speaking; “what do we do to help her?”<br />
“The only thing we can do,” doctor Tora looking at Helen’s younger twin brother; “let her mate with Peter Talbot.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Peter Talbot was eagerly consuming the sandwiches that his mother made for him. After finding out he was being put on solid food after he called and let Leon know about Helen’s disappearance; both rushed over to Peter’s hospital room. Upon entering the room and seeing the furniture in a destroyed state, Leon was feeling the urge to roar bloody murder. Thinking that someone managed to get by his brothers guarding Peter and trying to attack him; Peter had to frantically explain to his father what had transpired earlier.<br />
<br />
“You laid with your doctor,” Regina looking shocked; “what were you thinking?”<br />
“It’s not the boy’s fault Regina,” Leon sighing; “his doctor came in earlier, we both smelled her in heat.”<br />
“What,” Regina looking confused.<br />
“Oh that intoxicating smell,” Peter growling; “it was like pure need and desire.”<br />
“So those two outside let them do it,” Regina growling in displeasure; “Leon your brother’s have rocks for brains. What if Peter’s wound re-opened during their carnal act?”<br />
“Then I wouldn’t have to wait long for the doctor to stitch me back up,” Peter smiling.<br />
“You know,” Leon looking at his son; “ever since your brush with death, you have had such a cavalier attitude of late. Now I’ve put up with it because you have been recovering from surgery; hell I’ve thought it was a side effect of some of the pain medicine you were given. But if you are ever lippy with your mother again,” Leon growls; “like you were just now, then you will regret it.”<br />
<br />
“So where is Jean,” Peter staring at his father; “is she still getting her brains scrambled by Nate?”<br />
“Peter,” Leon now practically snarling; “watch your tone.”<br />
“Your sister decided to do some shopping,” Regina answering coldly; “her mate Nate, is out working.”<br />
“So she doesn’t know what’s happened,” Peter looking thoughtful; “that’s a relief.”<br />
“Why is that a relief,” Leon still looking cross.<br />
“Knowing sis,” Peter grumbling; “she’d use this situation to make a joke at my expense.”<br />
“Be that as it may,” Regina staring at her son; “you will not be rutting with your doctor any longer. Heat cycle or not; she needs deal with her condition without putting you in any further harm.”<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid that’s not possible.”<br />
Regina turns to see doctor Tachibana entering the room followed by a man she doesn’t recognize with his arm in a sling. A short introduction later; Tora Tachibana begins to explain the situation.<br />
“By now,” Tora looking at the state of chairs in Peter’s recovery room; “you know that doctor Tompkins and Perter Talbot here have… hooked up.”<br />
“Where is Helen,” Peter staring at the were-fox doctor; tensing up as he utters a low growl, thinking the doctor is a male competing for the were-rabbit&#39;s affection.<br />
“She is secured in a hospital safe room,” Doctor Tachibana; “we are running tests to determine her state of mind.”<br />
“She’s in heat,” Leon snorting; “it’s clear what her state of mind is.”<br />
“Be that as it may,” Doctor Tachibana responding quickly; “it’s how she got to that state in which concerns me. I ran some tests on Helen’s were-birth control pills; thinking they were a bad batch, putting the doctor in a severe hormonal imbalance. However that is not quiet the case,” Tora sighing; “the pills she was taken were geared towards a were-lioness.”<br />
“How does that explain her situation,” Regina doubting what the doctor is saying.<br />
“Every female were-beast requires a unique set of pills to off-set the chance of pregnancy,” doctor Tora explaining; “after all we have high libidos…”<br />
“I’m familiar with were-biology,” Regina getting impatient; “so get to the point!”<br />
“To some weres,” doctor Tora looking at the were-lioness; “the were-birth control pills from another were-beast can act as fertility aid. Encouraging the need and desire to reproduce; its why for some hybrid-weres their were-birth controls can get really expensive. They have to be carefully tailored to their unique physiology. The problem with the birth control pills,” Tora shaking his head; “they are all the same size, shape and colour. Helen Tompkins was mistakenly given pills meant for a were-lioness.”<br />
“So she rides out the heat cycle and gets a proper batch for her were-species,” Regina looking unconcerned; “I still don’t see why you are saying these two need to be together.”<br />
“Helen Tompkins heat cycle,” Doctor Tora answering; “is indicative to a normal going through the same symptoms of an incomplete transformation. Fever, shakes, impulsive actions and an insatiable desire for a certain person. In this case; its Peter. If she doesn’t get relief soon,” Doctor Tora looking serious; “Helen Tompkins could die.”<br />
<br />
“NO,” Peter roaring as he leaps off his bed and grabs the doctor; “where is Helen! Tell me before I tear this hospital apart looking for her.”<br />
CALM down Peter,” Leon using all of his strength to wrest the were-lion from the doctor.<br />
“Helen is my mate,” Peter roaring; “I will not calm down until she is all right. Let me go father,” Peter now growling and baring his claws as he struggles to be free of his father’s grasp. Doctor Tora getting up after being knocked down reaches into his lab coat for a syringe.<br />
“Leon keep your son restrained,” Tora approaching and sticking the needle in Peter. Hearing the younger were-lion roar in pain as Tora injects the contents into him; he steps back as the struggling were-lion manages to break free from his father&#39;s grasp; swiping the man with a clawed paw before passing out.<br />
<br />
“After we had a hell of a time keeping Peter sedated during his emergency surgery,” doctor Tora watching the were-lion slump to the floor; “a few of the staff came up with this Diazepam and ketamine based sedative. Fast acting and twice as strong as the standard sedatives used,” Tora Tachibana placing the used needle in a biomedical waste bin; “he will be out for a couple of hours.”<br />
“What do we do until then,” Leon gasping; stunned at how strong his son was as Regina looked at the deep scratches on her husband&#39;s face.<br />
“While he is sleeping,” Tora sighing; “we transport him to the same safe room Helen is in.”<br />
“Woah,” Regina speaking up; “hold on here. If Helen is was taking the wrong were-birth control pills; that means she will most likely get pregnant once she and Peter start rutting. That’s not happening on my watch!”<br />
<br />
Doctor Tora smiles as he pulls out another syringe. “This is an extra strong dose of the were-rabbit birth control pill. Only in liquid format for quicker absorption. It won’t stop Helen’s heat cycle, or her desire to be mated by Peter” doctor Tora talking; “but it should help prevent her from ovulating during the many bouts of intercourse she and Peter will undoubtedly have.”<br />
“Should,” Leon looking at the doctor questioningly; “you don’t sound certain.”<br />
“In all fairness,” Tora looking at the elder Talbots; “this is the first time someone has gotten the wrong were-birth control pills. We have no ideal as to how this will react to the artificial hormones already driving Helen mad.”<br />
“It’s better than nothing,” Andy final speaking up; “and Mrs. Talbot, while I’m certain you are only looking out for the safety of your son, you must understand, Helen is my twin sister and I don’t want her to die from some medicine mistake that was made. Plus,” Andy looking at the distraught were-lioness; “Peter still owes me an apology for breaking my arm.”</p>
