<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Calvin stopped bullying me after that day in the locker rooms. Not only that, he stopped bullying the other blonde kids as well. He found his attention through me. There’s no sense looking for it elsewhere. It’s a bit annoying having him trail me every day in school. He bullied the kid next to my seat so that he could sit beside me. Every lunch, we’d eat our food together while he whispers in my ear what pornography is as if I don’t know what it is. It’s annoying, I know. But it has its merits.<br />
<br />
After every PE class, Calvin would drag me to the locker rooms, begging me to fuck him in the ass. I’d oblige of course. This new body of mine is growing. My sexual hunger is becoming more apparent with every passing day. Calvin is heavier than I am, but when you’re famished for sex, the desperation can make you strong. While sitting on a bench, I’d grab him by the hips and push my dick inside his gaping ass. He’d collapse on my shoulders and leak a moan while his lips are kissing my shoulders.<br />
<br />
It’s funny. Declan used to fear this guy. Now, Calvin is crying in my shoulders complaining how I am too fast or rough with fucking his ass. Despite that, he always keeps coming back, begging for more. <br />
<br />
This play of ours continued for months. Some of our classmates saw us doing the deed but they are either too innocent to understand that we’re not roughhousing or already knowledgeable of the act to leave us alone. Although… It’s getting kind of stale. I’m always topping. While it’s enjoyable fucking his brains out, this asshole of mine is gathering dust. We tried to switch things up the other day but his penis is too small for me to feel anything. <br />
<br />
That’s when I remembered the zipper. I can’t believe I almost forgot about it. I’m so used to my new life that I barely remember my old one.<br />
<br />
In this school, there’s one guy that caught my eye. Bennett Floding is a 16-year-old high school student that everyone in this school already knows. His face is plastered in several tarpaulins inside and outside the campus. He’s the school’s pride and joy since he’s been winning the school yearly trophies in junior baseball tournaments around the country. <br />
<br />
I knew he was my target the moment I concocted my plan.<br />
<br />
For this plan, I can’t just walk right to him and turn him into a suit, like what I did with Declan. I know him but he doesn’t know me. It’s going to look weird if I abruptly approach him like that. <br />
<br />
Instead, I need to work my way up to him. There is this thing called “Six Degrees of Separation”. It notes that there are usually only six or fewer degrees of social connection between two people. Like I am connected to the president of the United States through my mom, and her friend knows someone from Washington, and that friend knows someone who works at the White House, and so on. Since we’re studying in the same school, I know there is a lesser degree of separation between Bennett and me.<br />
<br />
Before doing my plan, I told my parents that I’ll be having a sleepover at Calvin’s house. I told Calvin the same thing and his parents were happy to oblige. They didn’t think their son would have a friend to call over. This is his first time hosting a sleepover. I’m the golden child of my parents of course, so they agreed as well. They loved me so much that they sent my sleeping equipment as early as Friday morning. <br />
<br />
Onwards with the plan.<br />
<br />
The first person I possessed is a classmate of mine, Ollie Hudson. I was waiting for an opportunity the entire Friday morning and found it when I saw him go alone in the boy’s bathroom during our lunch. He peed in the standing urinal and the back of his nape is vulnerable to my attack. It didn’t take a minute before he collapsed into a suit and for another minute to wear his skin.<br />
<br />
I looked in the mirror. Brown-haired and brown-eyed. He’s not as much of a looker as Declan but that’s okay. I’m only using his body so I could get closer to his older brother, Roland Hudson, a new member of the baseball team. <br />
<br />
I met Roland a few minutes before lunch ended. His first practice is later this afternoon and he’s so excited that he’s already wearing his baseball uniform. From Ollie’s memory, Roland’s appearance didn’t stand out that much either. But donned with that baseball uniform, those mundane features turned greater. The uniform made his roundish face into that of a rising rookie. And I would not forget those tight leggings that exemplified the contour of his butt. Too bad for him, the experience of his first practice would be stolen by me.<br />
<br />
I found Ollie waiting by the court. He’s alone. Perfect.<br />
<br />
Ollie is far taller than I am so it’s difficult to place the zipper on his neck. What I did is I pretended to come to him before his first practice. I came for a hug, but as I did, I slipped the zipper under his clothes and onto his chest, rendering him paralyzed. I pulled him to the far corners of the shower rooms where nobody would see us.<br />
<br />
I plucked the zipper out of his body and he remained unconscious. I used the zipper to slip out of Ollie’s body and go inside Roland. By then, I was a master at transferring bodies. I think I could do this in my sleep. <br />
<br />
It’s strange but it took me a moment to wake up in Roland’s body. I don’t why since this is the first time it happened. I usually wake up immediately the moment I slip in. <br />
<br />
At the same time as my waking, Ollie woke up as well. Without asking, he mentioned that he remembered coming here but he can’t give a reason as to why. It also seemed that the memories of the zipper were purged from his memories, nor any that would point to me using his body as a suit. Nonetheless, I thanked him for coming to my first baseball practice. He’s my supportive little brother. I’m so caught up in this new role that I grabbed him by the head and rubbed my knuckles in his scalp like a jerky lovable older brother.<br />
<br />
My first baseball practice was superb! The skills hidden within this body helped me a lot in securing the praises from my superiors. Roland’s main skill is batting. Through his eyes, the ball nearly traveled in slow motion in the air. More often than not, I hit the ball and the reaction speed ingrained in my calves sends me running faster than I ever experienced. I feel like I’m flying through the air, passing base after base. <br />
<br />
By the end of it, the coach praised me along with several of the recruits. Although, I realized that I’m getting sour looks from the veterans of the same grade. As much as I’d like to lavish in the praises, that’s not my goal here. <br />
<br />
Bennett was watching from the bench and stole glances every time I’m passing a base. I saw him smiling with that sweet signature smile I only saw from the school brochure. Like what they said, he is known for his shaggy gold-rose-colored hair. Although long, he kept it neat, combed, and tied. One tied group of hair is found on his back, and this tied hair pokes out of the hole of his baseball cap. His smile is sweet and you could see why the school chose him as their poster boy. He’s one handsome lad, and I’m happy that I chose him.<br />
<br />
I hit the showers after practice, but not before letting the others shower first. From the whispers, they said Bennett is passionate about the sport. He’s often the last one out of practice. Which is quite convenient for my plan. <br />
<br />
The sun peeked below the horizon and I lay in the benches waiting for Bennett to finish batting the balls thrown by the throwing machine. He was sweating by then, and I could see the faint musculature drawn from his sweat-drenched baseball shirt. He stopped the practice by five and was alone in the showers after that.<br />
<br />
Well, not so alone. <br />
<br />
There’s a lone running showerhead and I know that’s where he is. Armed with the zipper in my hand, I saw him preoccupied with scrubbing the niche of his biceps. His ass is tight and muscular, and the definition of his scapula is jaw-dropping. I scarcely believe that he’s just a high school student. That kid must be hitting the gyms day and night. <br />
<br />
Using Roland’s strong calves, I jumped from my spot and had the zipper snake out of my hands and into Bennett’s back. The zipper automatically corrected its orientation as it followed the shape of Bennett’s spine. <br />
<br />
Bennett was out cold. His eyes are open but there’s no sign of life behind those eyes, and probably behind that rocking 8-inch hard-on. I guess that hot shower got his blood pumping.<br />
<br />
I did the same thing when I jumped from Ollie to Roland, although it&#39;s a bit difficult when the person you’re jumping into is soaking wet. And when I transferred into Bennett’s body, I immediately stamped the zipper on him. I don’t want him waking up immediately and my naked body. Although, I think the image already exists in his mind. <br />
<br />
I finished Bennett’s shower and basked in the memories that lead up to this day. My muscles are bulging! They are brimming with strength that I could only imagine from before. My calves are much larger and I expect my running speed to be faster than Roland’s. And in the mirror, I saw a handsome defined face snickering a smile. That’s me, in the meantime. <br />
<br />
I love this body but I don’t plan on staying here long. The plan doesn’t end here, rather at Calvin’s house. <br />
<br />
Calvin nearly screamed when he opened the door. He expected Declan. What he got instead is the poster boy of the school that he only dreamed of meeting personally. While Calvin stopped chasing after blonde guys, the interest remained alive in his mind. And who’s the best blonde guy on the campus if not for Bennett fucking Floding. I smiled at Calvin which made him blush rose red.<br />
<br />
“Be- Bennett? Wha- why are you here?” Calvin asked. Behind him, I hear Calvin’s mother ask who’s the handsome guy at the door. <br />
<br />
“Name’s Bennett, ma’am.” I saw with a hint of a Bostonian accent. “I’m here for the sleepover Calvin invited me for.”<br />
<br />
I looked at Calvin and he got what I’m going for in a gist. “Uhhh… yeah. I forgot to tell you, Bennett is coming as well.”<br />
<br />
“No matter, my son told you to bring your own food right? We’re low on liquid as of the moment so, yeah.” Calvin’s mother gave me one weak smile before going to the backyard to continue her smoke. <br />
<br />
I stepped inside and met a personal look at the squalor Calvin is living in. There are empty beer cans everywhere, and full ashtrays litter every possible surface of the living room. Lining the walls are pictures of Calvin’s family. It seems Calvin is the youngest of nine children. The three eldest of the siblings have already fled to the military and the two following boys are probably on their way there too. His father is an accomplished military personnel himself, but I don’t think I see him anywhere. The fifth sibling is a girl who is also missing as her dad. I know the other three since they go to the same school as I am. And that leaves Calvin, the smallest of his siblings. Other than Calvin and his mother, the entire family has blonde-colored hair. No wonder he likes blonde people so much.<br />
<br />
Calvin and I went upstairs, with me trailing behind. I hear the excitement from his shallow squealing. He could scarcely believe that one of the famous people in his school was right behind him, going to his room. <br />
<br />
Once inside, Calvin stared at me, speechless and his mind frantically searching for an ice breaker. <br />
<br />
“I dreamed of becoming a baseball player myself,” Calvin started. “Dad bought me a bat but got pissed when I couldn’t hit the ball. Tried catching balls instead, but I’m bad at that too. I guess baseball isn’t really for me.”<br />
<br />
I didn’t want to extend this idle conversation so I immediately undressed my uniform, revealing my defined abdomen within. Calvin is speechless while seeing me undress. I opened the zipper on my back, and I jumped out of this fleshy cocoon. The suit derived from Bennett is somewhat different from Declan’s or Ollie’s. The suit isn’t as weakly-structured as I thought it would be. The layer of skin is somewhat hard and pliable. It could stand on its own. The suit is still standing even though I already left it. The backside is wide open like a door, while the hollow face stared at Calvin’s surprised face.<br />
<br />
“What the holy fuck!?” Calvin screamed. I hope his mother downstairs didn’t hear his girlish squeals. Calvin saw me poke out of Bennett’s back. “Declan! Is that you? What the fuck just happened.”<br />
<br />
I stepped outside, feeling disgusted since I’m covered with the slime produced at the inner lining of the suit. It dried out quickly but the damp smell remained. <br />
<br />
I asked Calvin to calm down. Once he did, I explained that I have the power to turn other people into a suit, wear them, and become like them. I left the part about the Zipper or the fact that I am not actually Declan. The less he knows, the better. <br />
<br />
“Since you can’t fuck me in the ass, I’m thinking of putting you in Bennett’s body,” I said. <br />
<br />
Calvin’s face lit up, “Really!?” <br />
<br />
I helped Calvin put his body inside the suit, although I reminded him to remove his clothes first. I closed the zipper and quickly hid it in the bag my parents sent to this house this morning. It took an entire minute for Calvin to wake up in his new body. <br />
<br />
“Wh- whoa!” Calvin said with his new voice. “This is awesome. Dude, I have muscles! I have fucking muscles!” <br />
<br />
“I know,” I slowly walked closer to him as my clothes fell on the ground. “He’s got bit fat fucking member too.”<br />
<br />
I slipped my hands inside his shorts and squeezed his balls. They are as large as billiard balls compared to my small fingers. <br />
<br />
Calvin removed his clothes and I fully discarded mine. He sat on his bed while I crouched down and started mopping his dick with my tongue. It seems I didn’t shower that well since I could still smell and taste a salty and somewhat bitter stink from his penis. There’s a sticky film on his balls which I sucked like a candy pop. His dick is large and warm, and I could feel the throb coming from the veins. <br />
<br />
“Fu- fuck, dude! You suck better than I do.” Calvin said.<br />
<br />
I can’t reply since my mouth is preoccupied with this slab of meat. It tasted so amazing and out of what I expected. I dragged my thin tongue from the base of his balls and up his uncircumcised tip. I slobbered my tongue around his head and stretched his foreskin round and round. <br />
<br />
After that, Calvin picked up my face and we kissed together. Since he’s the larger of us, he was the one who took control of the tempo. He pushed his way inside my mouth and scoured the taste dwelling within. We kissed for a few minutes and I had to stop to catch my breath. But after that, I dragged my tongue downward where I left my mark on his neck and pecs. His muscles are so dense and tender, like rare meat that I could not bite entirely. I circled my tongue on his nipple, seeing them grow harder the more I lick them. Doing this meant leaving Calvin’s penis ignored. I get the gist that he doesn’t want that. <br />
<br />
Calvin easily picked me up from the floor and flipped me over so he was face to face with my ass. He squeezed my plump white buttocks and spread them open. I am glad to say that I gave my asshole a round of cleaning this morning. Calvin must have used Bennett’s memories because I don’t think he could eat ass this well. I could feel his far longer tongue reach the depths of my rectum. It’s fucking hot and especially wet, and I find myself screaming Bennet’s name with every prod. <br />
<br />
Finally, he settled down for a while. I hoped the rest took longer because my heart was beating so hard that it seemed it was burning on overdrive. I’m red all over and so does Calvin. He grabbed hold of my hips again, and this time, he inserted his saliva-covered dick with my saliva-covered asshole. <br />
<br />
This was payback for the hurt I gave him the first time we did this. My virgin asshole spread open, and it felt like it was ripping into two. My screams are drenched in equal measures of pain and pleasure. The sheer size of his dick meant he was hitting my prostate with every grind. The first time my asshole swallowed the entirety of his dick, I could see a deformation form around my navel. It’s his throbbing dick. I could see the head and the way it throbbed with his heartbeat. <br />
<br />
“Holy shitballs, you’re like a rag doll ain’t ya?” I hear the Boston accent in his voice.<br />
<br />
When he mentioned those words, the tempo of his grind churned quicker. He was humping me like there’s no tomorrow. My ass was in flames, and the deformation in my navel appeared and disappeared with every passing second. At the same time, the pleasures flooding my prostate are making my dick harder than I could imagine. The hardness is so much that I feel like there’s not enough skin and flesh to fully compensate.<br />
<br />
The grind took minutes, and my mind was filled with nothing but pain and pleasure the entire time. This is what I was looking for, an intercourse that could last for what seemed like lifetimes. <br />
<br />
Calvin was relentless. He is an animal drunk with anger and lust. His moans weren’t soft as I assumed they would be. They were loud and they were hungry. Every moan gave the signs that he wanted more. He latched his mouth on my neck and began eating my flesh, leaving the same hungry pockmarks I left him earlier. <br />
<br />
“I- I am close… Ah! Ah! Ah!” I moaned to his ear.<br />
<br />
“Me too,”<br />
<br />
That lifetime of pleasures ended in one moment thinner than a second. There are explosions in my rectum. They are spicy hot and fill every crevice found inside. At the same time, my balls emptied their contents high into the air and landed mostly on my chest. Streams of our cum continued to pour out. We moaned in unison as we continued to feast on each other’s skin. </p>
