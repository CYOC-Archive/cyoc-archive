<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I guess it was morning, at least that’s what the phone blasting some cheesy sounding pop song showed when I reached over to turn it off. There’s no way I would ever use some pop diva computer generated song as my alarm, guess my phone is on the fritz or something? Then I realized it wasn’t my phone. I have a pretty decent recent model phone in a black case, this was an older iPhone with a rose gold case. Ugh, I must be having some fucked up dream – I do NOT have the patience to deal with this crap on a Monday with as much as big men in charge are going to ride my ass today. I rolled over and laid on my back, hoping to “go back to sleep” before this dream gets any weirder. <br />
<br />
But I couldn’t sleep, there was a smell in the room that was too overpowering, a mix of some sort of cheap cologne or other fragrance that smelled slightly floral or fruity, and what I could swear was the smell of sex… Can you actually smell in your dreams? This is already starting to get weird. I probably fell asleep craving something sweet (since I skipped dinner all together) and of course craving sex (since it had been, damn, nearly a year for me… sigh).<br />
<br />
All right, I’ll play along I guess. So I toss back the covers and, ok, I’ve had these kind of dreams before… So there I am looking down at a very lean, slightly ripped pale body with an absolutely huge soft uncut cock laying on top of some probably lemon sized balls. I’ve got no pubes, or they are so blonde you can barely see them. So yeah, I guess I’m having that “wake up as a hung teen” dream again. I’m fine with that, it’s one of my favorites. <br />
<br />
There’s a mirror in the corner of the room, so I get up, finding I am totally naked, and walk over to it, stepping on a used condom on the way. Gross, but whatever, just a dream. I see my dream self in the mirror, I’m not a teen, or if I am, guess I am an older teen. I’d have to be somewhere between 18 and 20 is my guess. My blonde hair is shaggy and disheveled, which makes sense, since I just got out of bed. My face is baby smooth, not even a wisp of facial hair anywhere to be seen. My eyes are the deepest blue, and if I smile, I have some really cute dimples that pop out. There are a few minor blemishes, but nothing major. In fact, as tall as I am, and as handsome as my face is, I could probably be a model. Of course, then, there’s the rest of the body. My chest is not big, as you’d expect with me being a twink, but the pecs are decently formed, and the six pack has some good definition to it, it even has those little “cum gutters” I always wished I could get too. The arms and legs are nothing major, I can get a little ball when I flex my biceps, or see a slight horseshoe when I flex the triceps. He does have some nice calves though and the legs are fairly toned, so I would guess he’s a runner maybe. <br />
<br />
By this time my new cock was fully hard, jutting out probably a foot from my skinny groin and hanging down slightly because of the thickness and the weight of it. Yeah I always knew it was the tall skinny dudes that seemed to have the biggest dicks, and well, this had to have been the biggest dick I’d ever seen outside of porn, and it was attached to me now! So yeah, of course I stroked it, feeling the foreskin moving back and forth across the head was simply amazing, sending shivers all through my young tight body. I started to moan and talk dirty to myself, hearing my voice for the first time. It was slightly effeminate, but not in the campy sort of way thankfully since that would have probably killed my boner. Besides, this was MY dream anyway right? I wonder if I can give him a deep sexy voice, that would be a funny contrast! I concentrated, trying to do some of my lucid dream tricks, but nope, nothing changed, that’s weird… Or maybe this isn’t a dream! Is this really who I am now?<br />
<br />
Well anyway if this is real now, it’s not all bad. I was taking it slow, trying to enjoy these amazing new sensations all over this sexy new body of mine. “Oh fuck” I moaned, “that feels so fucking good!” When I went to sit back on the bed, and saw there was another set of clothes on the other side of the bed. They didn’t seem the type of clothes a kid like this would wear – he seemed more the skinny jeans, tight graphic tees, and low tops kinda guy. But here were some sized 32 Wrangler jeans with a large belt buckle, a flannel button up shirt, and some cowboy boots. I slipped my foot into one of the boots, but I couldn’t get it in – it was too small…That must mean these aren’t my boots. Just as I made that realization, I could hear someone walking down the hall toward this room. When the door opened, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I can tell you I wasn’t disappointed. <br />
<br />
“Already rearing to go for round two bud?” said this short beefy stud of a man, pointing at my hard cock. He was older than I was now, likely mid-20s, farmer’s tan on his massive arms, his wide chest had several tats, including some female name on a banner “Cheryl”, he had a slight six pack, likely hid only by his love of liquor from being more pronounced. He had shaggy brown hair, wet from a recent shower, hazel eyes from what I could tell, and a full beard. When he smiled, I could tell he smoked, but the teeth seemed fine otherwise, though that pronounced bulge under his lip told me this was a man who enjoyed dipping. He let the towel around his waist drop to the ground, showing off a hard thick cut cock of his own, but likely maybe half the size of my own. <br />
<br />
Needless to say, we fucked, and it was awesome! I sucked him off, making him make the sexiest deep moans I’d ever heard, then he started to fuck my face, which you’d think might have pissed me off, but for some reason I was really digging it. “Get on your belly bitch!” he shouted at me playfully, “I’m gonna tear into that ass again and make you scream!” No he wasn’t abusive, I could tell this is just how things were and what turned them on, and shit was it turning me on! I rolled over and he started to eat me out a little, which surprised me, but also felt really different with that big bushy beard of his. I was moaning so much and leaking so much precum I’m sure these sheets are going to need a wash after. I felt him stop and readjust, I looked behind me to see him on his knees with a big smile on his face. “You ready for this!” he said, swinging his dick at me. I nodded and smiled, “Fuck yes! Fuck my tight ass!” “That’s the plan!” he said, as he shoved his whole dick deep into my throbbing hole. I saw stars initially and yelped in pain, but once he hit that magic spot, I was his! “Oh yea, fuck me, fuck me hard!” I said over and over, “You like that daddy dick? You like getting fucked by straight dick, don’t ya boy?” “Yes, please, I love when you fuck me, it feels so fucking good! I need your straight daddy cum in my ass!” “Yeah boy? You want this straight daddy to breed you? Fuckin impregnate you with my thick cum? FUCK! I wish you had a pussy, I’d love to make you have my babies, but this ass you got boy, feels way better than any pussy I’d fucked lately – especially my wife!” He grunted as he pounded my ass more and more frantically. <br />
<br />
Oh shit, he’s married? I’m not big on that, but it’s too late to back out, guess I’m a homewrecker. Well, I didn’t force him to fuck me, did I? But the fact he was straight (well “straight” obviously) was a bit of a turn on. I started squeezing my ass muscles, amazing myself that I had that level of control over them – this boy must be a natural bottom. I was literally jacking this beefy good old boy’s dick with my ass muscles, and he was loving it if his shorter breaths and gradually higher pitched moans were anything to judge my performance by. “Oh fuck Cody, yeah, keep doing that! Oh shit you’re gonna make me cum. You really do want me to breed you, don’t you?” Oh, is that something they haven’t done before? Maybe I should be careful about it, I mean, I have no idea who this dude is, who knows what kinda STDs he might have? But my horniness won out over my rationality, and I simply nodded and said “Yeah, fucking shoot in my ass, I want to feel your cum deep inside me, please!” “All right boy, I’m gonna cum… Oh fuck, oh fuck…” A few more held breathes, I could tell he was trying to hold it back, “FUUUUUUUUCKK!” he roared as I felt his cock spasm in my ass, I kept milking it with my muscle control and that made him shudder and collapse on my back, still spasming  and shooting in my ass. Damn I’m good! He started to lightly kiss the back of my neck, then he grabbed my shoulder and thrust a couple of more quick times, making me yelp. “Did you get off?” he asked – what a gentleman. “No, not yet” I said. <br />
<br />
With his dick still in me, he rolled me over to face him, and started to make out with me as he jacked my cock and kept fucking me. Wow, I did NOT expect that from a straight dude cheating on his wife, I figured it was just a hookup for him to get off. He started to chuckle, “Damn, this is a fucking huge dick Cody, can you imagine what it’d look like if I had your dick?” “Like a third leg?” I said, cracking both of us up. “Damn that’s funny man, and probably true, that dick would be way too big on my short ass self. But fuck, I do love to play with it!” Then he leaned over and with his tongue, started to play with the head and foreskin – apparently this is what really gets me off, because in no more than a minute of that, I was ready to shoot. “Fuck man, I’m getting close…” “Yeah? Fucking shoot that load Cody! I wanna see it.” He said as he went back to jacking me off lying beside me on the bed, rubbing my chest and playing with my nipples. “Here it comes Beau!” Beau? How did I know this guy’s name? Maybe he just looks like a Beau, “Oh fuck, I’m gonna cum, gonna cum…” “Yeah, fucking shoot that big ass load man, do it!” And shoot I did! Fuck it fired out like a cannon. Not surprising with these big ass balls I have now. Suddenly Beau moved down and plunged my dick in his mouth. I was still coming and he hungrily took as much as he could, and he even swallowed! Fuck this dude is pretty kinky for a straight guy, damn! Once I finished coming and my cock was kinda sensitive I said “Ok, stop, stop! Phew, that was amazing man, but my cock is getting sensitive.” I said with a smile. He looked up at me and smiled, “What’s amazing is that cock, fuck I wish I had a cock like that!” He came up and started making out with me again, and I could taste a little of my cum in his mouth still. <br />
<br />
He rolled over again, let out a big sigh and said “Fuck, Cheryl and kids get back from her mother’s place tonight, I am NOT looking forward to that. I mean, I love my kids, but you know, Cheryl has been a real bitch lately.” He stood up and started to put his clothes on, sliding out the wedding band from his pants pocket and putting it back on. He saw where I was looking and looked down at it, “Yeah, I know, I made a vow. It’s fucking stupid, but I’m only staying together for the kids. If I divorce her, I might never see them again with my work and all I probably can’t get even half custody. And she’s a fucking alcoholic who can’t hold a job for more than a month!” He sighed and looked at me and smiled, “Ugh, sorry man, my drama, you don’t need to hear this shit. This town’s small enough as it is, it’ll probably get around eventually that we’re fucking, that’s why I can’t hang as much as I’d like to.”<br />
<br />
“I get it man,” I said, “Do what you gotta do, I’m not gonna judge.” He leaned over and gave me another kiss. “Thanks Cody!” he said, “Oh shit, am I making you late for work, don’t you gotta be at the diner by seven?” “Do I?” “Yeah, at least that’s what you said last night, why you didn’t want me to stay over too long. It’s already… 6:30 now! You better hurry, I didn’t mean to make you late bud. Anyway, I gotta run too, gotta be out at the site by 8 and it’s a long ass drive from here and I had to park a few blocks away, cuz ya know... But hey, I’ll see you next time I get a chance, ok?” I nodded “Awesome, I hope you have a good day at work, make some good tips!” He smiled and walked out. <br />
<br />
Well shit, so I work at a diner, as a server? I guess it’s easier than my banking job, but it’s annoying in other ways. But FUCK, that Beau is one sexy beast. It might be worth the crappy job if I can mess around with that beefy little roughneck more often!<br />
<br />
I pushed myself out of bed, found my work outfit, and after getting dressed, headed out the door to start my new life as the very hung bottom twink who has at least one closeted ”straight” guy in this small farm town interested in plowing my ass.</p>
