<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patric stood naked as Ms. Trenwell walled around him eying him up and down. She stuck a pencil in her mouth as she studied his naked physique, and she hemmed and hawed. <br />
<br />
She clicked her tongue, and then said, &quot;Patric, you look tense. I need you relaxed and limber if I'm going to make a decent statue out of you. Go over behind that shochi screen.  There's a sauna. Just go in and veg out for a bit.  I'll send someone over to give you a massage before we get started.&quot;  She glanced at Carly, and Patric smiled knowingly.<br />
<br />
Vanessa knew Carly, yeah, this was a set up alright.  He sauntered over to the shochi screen.  He paused, this could be a trap.  Maybe it wouldn't be Vanessa showing up after all. It might be Carly, and Vanessa would whale on him big time if he hit on her. Women.  Well, there was the sauna.  <br />
<br />
Behind the shochi screen there was a wooden portable sauna, a plastic cylindrical shower and a toilet and a sink. There was also a statue. It made Patric laugh to look at it.<br />
<br />
The statue appeared to black volcanic stone carved to look like a guy that Patric recognized.  It wasn't the fact that Vanessa's ex-boyfriend had been made into a statue by Ms. Trenwell, it was the fact that the statue was functional art work.  <br />
<br />
A roll of toilet paper was slid on the statue's permanent boner. One hand held a loofah, and the other arm was draped with a towel. The statue's mouth was open, and beige soap was sitting in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vanessa always said, you should wash your mouth out with soap, Kyle,&quot; Patric said patting the statue of his former rival on the head. &quot;Funny, I haven't seen Kyle since he broke up with Vanessa, and I started dating her.&quot; He shrugged, and went into the sauna.  He lay down on the wooden bench. It was nice and hot. Beads of sweat formed on his brow, and back.  He lay down on his chest. He started to doze off after a bit of basking in the heat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need a hero!&quot; said a masculine voice as a firm hand slapped Patric's wet butt cheek. <br />
<br />
Then the boom box that had appeared on the corner bench began blaring Bonnie Tyler's voice sang, &quot;Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods? Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds? Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed? Late at night I toss and I turn...&quot;<br />
<br />
Warm oil squirted on to his back and shoulders. Warm strong hands began to massage him. Patric opened his eyes, turned his head and looked over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I'm Patric,&quot; he said pausing as he glanced at the nearly nude Asian dude standing next to him, &quot;Uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Hiro. Ms. Trenwell has me oil up her models for her.  Just relax and enjoy the - oh, the loin cloth's got ya.  Yeah , me I'd rather just wear a thong if I have to wear anything, but Trenwell's into traditional Japanese stuff.  So I am wearing a fundoshi and hachimaki. The fundoshi's the loin cloth, and the hachimaki is the headband. The Japanese character stands for Ryu, dragon.  It's not so much like the fire breathing dragons of England as it is like the Greek gorgon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean the lady with the snakes for hair is a Japanese dragon?&quot; Patric asked lazily.  He figured this is what Vanessa meant by a &quot;couple girls&quot; and a &quot;gay guy.&quot; Hiro certainly knew his way around a guy's muscles. It felt so good.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a hero!&quot; Bonnie belted out again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; laughed Hiro, &quot;Medusa was the chick with the snake hair.  The gorgons were the giant sea dragon creatures that hung out with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess, I missed that part in Clash of the Titans.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hiro laughed, &quot;Yeah, they cut out my best scenes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hiro couldn't be much older than Patric and Clash of the Titans was at least 30 years old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, lighten up. It's a joke! No wonder, Trenwell wanted me to work my Hiro magic on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a hero!&quot; sang Bonnie as the song ended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you got magic fingers,&quot; muttered Patric as he enjoyed the masseur's handiwork.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got no idea,&quot; Hiro said under his breath as his magic fingers began to change Patric's flesh into something more durable.<br />
<br />
Patric's eyes went wide when Hiro started to work on Patric's glutes, but he kept his mouth shut.  Hiro remained quiet too, as he worked.  Massage was hard work and doing it in a sauna made it a lot harder.  Sweat was dripping of his body like he had just stepped out of a shower.<br />
<br />
When Hiro started to work on his feet, Patric knew that Hiro would want to go work on his front side.  He wasn't too comfortable with a guy doing that. He was going to comment about the heat, and maybe taking a shower.<br />
<br />
Instead he asked, &quot;So you know Vanessa too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, that hot chick sent you here?  You're such a stud too. Not at all like that Kyle!&quot; Hiro rolled his eyes for emphasis.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Kyle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, he modeled for Ms. Trenwell a few months back. Oh, you probably recognized the toilet paper holder as him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Vanessa always said he needed to wash his mouth out with soap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'S that's what's she said, huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;His mouth is a soap dish, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, huh, yeah, I guess,&quot; said Hiro, &quot;Now rollover, I got to work on your front.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, well, ya know, uh, Huro,&quot; Patric said still lying on his front.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're popping a boner, it's okay.  This is Madam Trenwell's studio, none of her models ever get &quot;happy endings.&quot; So roll over and enjoy a non-sexual massage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patric sighed, and rolled over.  He was actually getting paid to be massaged.  Hiro was good at his job.  Patric closed his eyes, and let the magic fingers do their work.<br />
<br />
&quot;So will Vanessa be popping in?&quot; Patric asked casually.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, probably not until Ms. Trenwell's done with you.  I reckon she'll be by for her money.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her money?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Finder's fee.  She bird dog's hot hunks for Ms. Trenwell all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's my girlfriend,&quot; muttered Patric.  He wondered how many guys she was sending here, and how well she got to know them.<br />
<br />
Patric dozed off.<br />
<br />
He was awakened by a firm grip on his hard cock pulling him up off the bench.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeow! Let go of my dick!&quot; Patric shouted as he came off the bench with fists clenched. Hiro let go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy man, I wasn't giving you a happy ending, I was just trying to get you up.  You just kept saying, &quot;In a minute, ma,&quot; and I'm nobody's mother,&quot; Hiro sounded indignant.<br />
<br />
Patric laughed. &quot;Okay, Ma, sorry. I guess it's time for school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you'll be getting schooled alright,&quot; muttered Hiro.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
They stepped out of the sauna. Hiro led the way.<br />
<br />
Waiting in the bathroom was Ms. Trenwell and a short middle aged Japanese businessman.  He was currently pointing at Hiro and shouting angrily. Ms. Trenwell was shaking her head and waving her arms. She pointed at Patric as he emerged naked from the sauna.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; said the businessman.  A grin spread across his face and he nodded happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you've been presold. That means he'll decide on what pose he wants you in...I've got some Viagra if you need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Patric looked down.  His cock had been rock hard and upright when he had left the sauna, but it had started to droop when the old Japanese guy had started jumping up and down and pointing at him.  He didn't know what the man said in Japanese, but he bet Hiro did.<br />
<br />
He spoke up, &quot;Ms. Trenwell, are you ready for me yet? I'll just shower and be with you in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patric reached for the soap in Kyle's mouth. It was shaped differently than Patric had expected. It was a beige soap molded into the shape of a man's cock and balls. <br />
<br />
Hiro looked over his shoulder, and whispered, &quot;You said Vanessa said he had a potty mouth and needed it washed out with soap, right?  I always thought he was a potty mouthed cocksucker.  Guess we were both right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think I am?&quot; whispered Patric to Hiro as he slipped by him and into the shower.<br />
<br />
Hiro grabbed the loofah off the Kyle statue and held it to his chin, &quot;Hm?&quot; He looked Patric up and down as if appraising him, and then tossed him the loofah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Patric asked.</p>
