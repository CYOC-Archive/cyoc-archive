<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back in the room Alicia unpacked Henry’s purchases. She put the magazines and the puzzle book aside. They were intended for her use. But evidently all the other items were for the use of ‘Rachel’. She gushed over the handbag saying “This was a real bargain” and “I didn’t know you had such good taste” before filling it with his new cosmetics, and as Henry now found out perfume, that he had just purchased. <br />
<br />
Alicia tested the perfume out on her own wrist, before saying “Chanel number 5. It’s my Mum’s favourite. I love this scent” She then proceeded to spray the perfume onto Henry, onto his neck then over the blouse he was wearing. “This can be Rachel’s scent as well” She put the perfume bottle into Henry’s new handbag.<br />
 <br />
Alicia also liked the hat. She put it on Henry’s head. “It looks really nice, just remember to brush your hair whenever you take it off, otherwise you will have hat hair. There’s a mirror in the compact I’ve just put in your handbag as well as your own brush so you no longer have to borrow mine”<br />
<br />
Henry told Alicia about the Tradesman checking out his breasts “Get used to it. I think 80% of men look there first before looking at your eyes” <br />
<br />
He then told her about his unfortunate reaction from walking behind Kailani. “Yes that is a bit awkward. We will have to think of a solution”<br />
<br />
Alicia was a bit dubious about his choice of earrings, but didn’t say so. She put them on his ears and said. “They look nice” At least they took attention away from his lobes. Then a thought hit her “I think we should try something that might keep Mister Marvellous in check. Come with me. <br />
<br />
In the bedroom Alicia delved into her underwear drawer and pulled out a grey garment. “My bike shorts! I bought them in case we went riding. I should have thought of these earlier. They will kill two birds with one stone. They will enhance your bum and we can keep Mister Marvellous in check. Try them on” She handed them to Henry. <br />
<br />
“Um.. Do I wear my boxers under them?”<br />
<br />
“No that wouldn’t work. Wear these” Alicia was holding up a pair of her panties<br />
<br />
“Why those?”<br />
<br />
“You only wear boxers. They would crinkle up. You would need tight fitting undies under the bike shorts”<br />
<br />
“But there is no room for Mister Marvellous” <br />
<br />
“That’s the idea silly. Tuck him backwards between your thighs then the bike shorts will hold him in that position. If he does grow he will be pointing backwards and he won’t show” It was so logical to Alicia.<br />
<br />
Henry just stood there dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
“Take off your skirt and the boxers” Alicia commanded. Henry did so. Realising he was still wearing the sandals. “Now step into these and pull them up” She handed him some plain black panties. Henry pulled them up to his waist. “Now tuck your thingee backwards and pull the panties right up. But not so far that it hurts” Henry fiddled with his penis tucking it backwards in the panties. Fortunately the idea of locking his penis away was not exciting Henry and he was quite small and flaccid. “Now step into the bike pants and pull them up” Henry did. The bum of the bike pants was a wet-suit like material. The top and the leg holes were elasticised. They were a reasonably tight fit over his thighs but he squeezed them up. “Can you pull them just a little bit higher” said Alicia who was bending over looking at his crotch. <br />
Henry pulled them up a bit more until he felt them gently squeezing against his still backwards facing penis. “That’s as far as they go” he declared<br />
<br />
“It actually works better than I thought. You look quite flat down there. But now for the test”<br />
<br />
Alicia’s test proved to be drawing Henry towards her for a kiss with one hand and rubbing his crotch with the other. She could feel him get hard but his lump just moved down not out. “It works!” she declared “Take a look!”<br />
<br />
So Henry went to the mirror. Sure enough there was little sign of his penis even though he could feel that it was enlarged. “And your backside looks more womanly as well” declared a happy sounding Alicia. “Let’s put your skirt back on and see the finished result”<br />
Henry did so. From the front it didn’t look much different but from side on it looked like his butt stuck out more. “Now I think you could return to that shop and not have a repeat of your problems. I’ll have to check this girl out. I’m getting a little jealous”<br />
<br />
Henry remained dressed as he was. He experimented by walking around the suite. Walking was fine but he did have to be careful with the process of sitting if he didn’t want to squeeze his balls. He quickly found a technique that didn’t hurt.<br />
<br />
He had just got himself comfortable on the couch once more and picked up his book when Alicia asked “Do you feel like Fish for lunch. They do take away fish and chips at the pool restaurant”<br />
<br />
“Sounds nice” <br />
<br />
He was vaguely aware of Alicia talking on the phone as he concentrated on his book. He became alert when he heard Alicia say the name ‘Rachel’. Her final words which he heard quite clearly were “She will be there in 10 minutes. A blonde girl in a white shirt and a blue and green skirt. Remember she is mute……Okay thanks”<br />
<br />
“What did you just do?”<br />
<br />
“I ordered lunch”<br />
<br />
“Couldn’t you get it delivered?”<br />
<br />
“They don’t do deliveries for that bar. What’s your worry it’s only just over there” she pointed out past the patio<br />
<br />
“But I’ll have to go out again”<br />
<br />
“So? You look great. What’s your concern? If you encounter someone just show them your note. The guy I spoke to is expecting you and knows you are mute”<br />
<br />
By the time Alicia had retied the scarf around Henry’s neck and adjusted the strap on his new handbag so that it hung correctly on his shoulder. It was time for Henry to head out. He made sure he had the ‘I am Rachel note’ with him just in case.<br />
<br />
He was a bit less self-conscious than on his earlier excursion heading down the hallway but when he approached the pool area and saw it was quite crowded his legs turned to jelly. He almost turned around and fled back to the room when he saw numerous people look up and check him out, male and female, but the thought of upsetting Alicia was also strong and he was feeling hungry.<br />
<br />
He tentatively approached the bar. He saw he had caught the attention of a young barman or at least his breasts had. Eventually the barman’s eyes raised to meet Henry’s. “You must be Rachel. I’m Billy. I was expecting you. Your sister didn’t say you were a bombshell. Fish and chips pack for two wasn&#39;t it. I’ll see if it’s ready” All Henry could do was smile and nod his head.<br />
<br />
Henry stood by the bar and waited while Billy went to the other end of the bar. He was terribly aware that Billy wasn’t the only male checking him out. There were two guys further along the bar blatantly staring at his breasts and a guy at a table staring past his girlfriend’s shoulder at him. Henry made brief eye contact with the man before turning away. There were other people also in the area. Henry sensed they were also watching him but he didn’t want to look towards them. He pretended to read the menu on the bar while waiting for Billy to return.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like ages but was probably less than a minute the barman returned. He had a package wrapped up in plain white paper. “Perfect timing” he said this time smiling to Henry’s face.  “Room 217 correct?” Henry nodded. “Done. Come back later. It’s cocktail night tonight. I’d be happy to give you and your sister a complimentary taste test” Henry could only smile, flashing Alicia’s white teeth at Billy, pick up the lunch and walked away towards the nearest door. He could feel eyes watching his bum.<br />
<br />
Strangely enough as soon as he left the bar area Henry felt much more relaxed. There were still people about but he didn’t feel like a sex object.  He actually stopped and read a message board announcing upcoming activities before heading back inside. The door he had taken led into the main lobby. He had to walk past the shops and saw Kailani rearranging a display. She saw him as well and gave a wave. Henry smiled and waved back. The tradesman was still there. He had moved further up the corridor to another window, he also smiled when he saw Henry and Henry found himself smiling back.</p>
