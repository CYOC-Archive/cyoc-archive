<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aware his foster sister had come into the room and now was using the computer, Jon figured it was for more of her college stuff. Wanting to snort and comment she had about as much chance of getting a higher education as a two-dollar whore had of winning the lottery, or being made President of North America, he was distracted when Billy did something. Starting to argue about what his friend did, he pressed a series of buttons on the controller to counter what the other did in the video game, and listened as Billy made a crack, first about fugly girls and how they were so desperate, they&#39;d fuck anything on two, four, or no legs, then about nerdy girls, who wanted to get laid, but nobody would touch them.<br />
<br />
Both jokes got a laugh from him, and Jon continued to work at the puzzle in the videogame holding them up. When Denise collected what she&#39;d brought with her and left the room, he listened as Billy stated, &quot;You know she wouldn&#39;t be so uptight if she&#39;d just let someone have a crack at her crack.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wanted to laugh at this, as it was the usual sort of jokes Billy made. But, instead, Jon was overcome with the weirdest sensation, as he suddenly thought how it wasn&#39;t right to say such things. Trying to ignore these errant thoughts, he gave a forced chuckle as he pretended to concentrate completely on the game. Feeling as if the moment passed, he was slightly relieved when Billy made another joke at the expense of Denise and her refusal to go out with him, and Jon retorted with, &quot;Are you kidding?!. The only reason she shan&#39;t go out with you is because she&#39;s always menstruating,&quot; which got a semi-chuckle from Billy before he snapped, &quot;Shut the fuck dude. I know you&#39;d hit that, even if she was bleeding, &#39;cause you&#39;re all about the cherry pie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Uncomfortable all of a sudden with the subject, Jon paused the game. About to tell his friend off, explain a thing or two about monthlies and how they could be uncomfortabl, he was unsure why, and instead commented, &quot;Be right back,&quot; in a distracted manner.<br />
<br />
In need to pee, thinking he also needed to clear his head, Jon headed for the bathroom. There, without a second thought to what he was doing, he promptly sat down to empty his bladder, then, after he was finished, used a dab of toilet paper to wipe himself. Suddenly aware of what he was doing, how he&#39;d pissed, Jon leapt up. Putting down the lid, something he&#39;d never did, as he was the type who normally left the lid and seat up, he didn&#39;t give it a second thought as he started to wash his hands. Wondering what the fuck was suddenly wrong with him, he shuddered as he told himself, &quot;What’s wrong is you’re thinking like a girl,&quot; and seeing this as the most ridiculous thing ever, he dried his hands, tried to put the matter from his mind and exited the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Out in the hall, he found Denise waiting. Looking at her, he was about to demand to know what she wanted, but was caught off guard when she asked him, &quot;Which lipstick do you think I should wear? Berry red, or cold fusion red?&quot;<br />
<br />
His mind seemed to take a weird twist, and before Jon could stop himself, he started discussing with her about both colours, offering points on how each would complement things like her skin tone, the fullness of her lips, even the outfit she was wearing, before suggesting a few other shades. Struggling to get control of himself, Jon abruptly turned and fled back to the living room, where he shut off the television.<br />
<br />
When Billy asked him, &quot;What&#39;s up,&quot; he shrugged and muttered, &quot;Need some fresh air. Can&#39;t stick around him. You coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
His friend, after giving him an odd look, nodded. The two of them collecting their shoes and coats, and after Jon had told the Parkers he was going out, the two got their bikes and headed for the mall. Watching all this, Denise smiled as she thought about the conversation she&#39;d just had with Jon and how he acted as if what they were talking about was the most normal thing in the world. Believing using the Chronivac had been a success, she headed for her room, thinking as she did whether she wanted to try and alter Billy in some way, wait to see how all this played out, or change something else about Jon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll shift it so he has an interest in clothes,&quot; she mused to herself as she sat at her vanity desk and opening the catalogue she&#39;d been reading earlier, she considered, &quot;Or maybe I&#39;ll give him an interest in clothes, as well as wears girl&#39;s stuff,&quot; and liking this idea, she barely gave the printed material any attention as she tried to plan out all the ways she might alter first her foster brother, then his friend, all in the name of getting back at them and teaching a lesson.</p>
