<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was feeling all excited after having grown another kid in the hallway, especially now that he had discovered how incredibly easy it was to make any other kid’s muscles grow. Basically, all he had to do was to focus on any guy’s muscles and just imagine his muscles growing as big as he wanted by wishing it, and presto! It actually happened right before his very eyes!<br />
<br />
So, Ty just ended up wandering around the football field, where a few guys were tossing the ball to one another. A few guys were hanging out from soccer practice and from the baseball team. So, Ty decided to walk over to the bleachers and he sat down on the second row, giving him a great view of the football field. He decided to hang out there and wait for someone to walk by.<br />
<br />
Luckily, it didn’t take long. About 5 minutes after Ty had sat down on the bleachers, he spotted his brother walking right before him, talking to another boy who was wearing cleats and what seemed to be a soccer uniform because he was wearing long, athletic socks and shin guards underneath. He was also wearing black shorts and a red jersey with the number four on his shirt. Since they were standing right in front of where Ty was sitting, he was able to overhear the conversation.<br />
<br />
“Dustin, I am not looking forward to this weekend, I am telling you, dude…” Ethan said to Dustin. Ethan was tall and lanky with blue eyes and brown, curly hair. He was about 6 feet tall and he was very smart. Unfortunately, he wasn’t strong or muscular. <br />
<br />
“Oh man! What’s going on this weekend?” Dustin wondered.<br />
<br />
“We’re moving into a townhouse! My father has sold our house and we’re getting a smaller place since my big bro moved out and went to college. The place isn’t as big as the house but on the other hand, the apartment complex has a small theater, a gym, a Jacuzzi and a pool!” Ethan explained. <br />
<br />
“Well, that is awesome!” Dustin smiled. “You’re so lucky!”<br />
<br />
“No, I’m not! I gotta MOVE this weekend and I hate it! I gotta pack and haul heavy boxes filled with books, clothes, kitchen stuff and other crap!” Ethan groaned.<br />
<br />
“Uhh…. We have a truck, dude… We’ll come and help ya!” Dustin offered. <br />
<br />
Ty let out a loud groan from where he was sitting, which Ethan and Dustin were able to hear. They turned around and spotted him sitting there.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for ruining MY weekend, Dustin!” Ty moaned as he got up.<br />
<br />
“Well, I wouldn’t need any help if I just had the help of a bodybuilder for lifting sixty-pound boxes…” Ethan sighed.<br />
<br />
“Ohhh yeah?” Ty grinned. “Is that ALL you need?” <br />
<br />
“I could use a big muscle-guy to lift a few boxes… and furniture… and a desk… and a bed…” Ethan mumbled.<br />
<br />
“No problem!” Ty shouted.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Dustin asked. <br />
<br />
“We’ll show up at your house on Saturday!” Ty assured his friend.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Tyler!” Ethan grinned, shaking TY’s hand.<br />
<br />
Shortly afterwards, Ty and Dustin started walking towards the baseball field.<br />
<br />
“Are you NUTS? I’m not lifting any heavy boxes and furniture! I got a bad back and if I lift any heavy stuff then my back will give out and then…” Dustin started to complain.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Dustin!” Ty cut him off. “We’re not lifting anything! ETHAN will do ALL the lifting!” <br />
<br />
Dustin just rolled his eyes and let out a deep sigh. What was his younger brother babbling about? <br />
<br />
*****Two Days Later*****<br />
<br />
Saturday morning, Dustin and Ty pulled into Ethan’s driveway in Dustin’s little truck. Ethan walked out of the house, wearing only his shorts and sandals. He had been packing boxes with books and clothes and he was already completely covered in sweat.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Ethan! Come over here for a sec!” Ty shouted out from the lawn where he was standing.<br />
<br />
Ethan walked over to where Ty was, wondering what Ty was going to show him.<br />
<br />
“Stand there for a sec, dude…” Ty ordered him.<br />
<br />
Then, Ethan was immediately overcome by strange, prickling sensations all over, specifically in every muscle in his body!<br />
<br />
“Ohhh man! What is going on?” Ethan moaned out loud.<br />
<br />
Ethan’s calves inflated from thin, skinny muscles into large, hard, thick and heavy round spheres of muscle, sticking out from the back of his legs like soccer balls which were covered with thick veins!<br />
<br />
“What the heck? My legs????” he gasped, while looking down at his growing legs.<br />
<br />
Next, his quads grew in every direction, growing thicker, wider, deeper and adding hard layers of muscle above the knees, adding amazing power and strength to his skinny legs and making them look like legs belonging to a champion cyclist or runner! His quads were incredibly defined now, with rope-like veins covering them all over!<br />
<br />
“Now, for the rest of your body, above the waist!” Ty smiled, as he concentrated on the rest of Ethan’s muscles. <br />
<br />
Ty focused his gaze on Ethan’s torso and silently wished for those muscles to grow as well. Right away, Ty’s magic took affect and did its magic on Ethan’s body. The boy’s flat stomach quickly transformed into a surface covered with rows and columns of abdominal muscles, which magically appeared out of nowhere! Above the abs, Ethan’s flat chest suddenly bulged as mighty pectorals pushed outwards and sideways at the same time, becoming harder, bigger and heavier all at once. Ethan felt a drastic increase in weight as his shoulders became much wider due to his increased pectorals!<br />
<br />
“Ohhhh MAN! I feel so… heavy! My chest!” Ethan gasped.<br />
<br />
Finally, Ethan’s arms bulged as his biceps ballooned to freakish proportions! His triceps grew as well, giving him Popeye-like arms covered with veins! His lats grew incredibly wide, spreading out like wings whenever Ethan raised up his arms and spread them out. Lastly, Ethan’s back grew into one large muscle mass, capable of assisting in raising up and lifting amazing amounts of weight!<br />
<br />
“HOLY SHIT!!!” Ethan shouted, as the amazing growth spurt ended. Ty let out a deep sigh of relief. He was getting tired. Dustin had just walked over and let out a loud gasp when he saw Ethan standing before him.<br />
<br />
“OHMYGOSH ETHAN!” Dustin shouted.<br />
<br />
“There! I told you he was gonna do all the lifting!” Ty smiled.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… I can lift boxes with these babies… Easy!” Ethan laughed, as he made a fist and caused a huge ball of muscle to rise up from his arm.<br />
<br />
“You’re the biggest fifteen-year-old dude in school!” Dustin sighed. <br />
<br />
“Yup… The biggest freshman in high school!” Ty laughed.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Ty…. I don’t know how you did this, but…. I got boxes to lift!”<br />
<br />
Ethan turned around and started carrying boxes from the house into the truck, easily lifting and carrying them from the house into the bed of the truck.<br />
<br />
“Uhh…. What are you gonna do to him when he’s done moving?” Dustin asked Ty. “Are you gonna shrink his muscles back down to normal?”<br />
<br />
“Heck no! I might make them bigger!” Ty giggled. “He looks good with big muscles!”<br />
<br />
Dustin and Ty laughed as they watched Ethan carry several boxes to the truck…<br />
<br />
This went on until Ethan was faced having to carry the heavy couch…</p>
