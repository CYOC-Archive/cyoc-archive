<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Cautiously, you let her out of the cage. She stumbles out, and you see that she's not quite through changing; her breasts shrink somewhat and she generally becomes a little less anthropomorphic, shrinking down to the size of the female Velociraptor in the other pen before the changes finally cease.</p>
<p>"Well," you tell her, "this is how it is: you're going to create an antidote for this, we'll test it on you, and then if it works you're going to make antidotes for your other victim and me. And before you try anything funny, consider this: I'm much larger than you now, I have the same natural armaments you do, which makes me naturally as deadly or deadlier than you, and..." you heft your trusty crowbar, "I'm armed. Not only that, but I have <i>tons</i> of your IV bags to work with; a Velociraptor girl isn't the worst thing you could be, you know. So I wouldn't try to escape or anything if I were you. Now get to work."</p>
<p>Nodding nervously, she sits down at her computer, carefully sliding her tail in the space between the top and bottom of the folding chair, and sets to work. You keep a careful eye on her, ready for any escape attempts or attacks, but she seems to be honestly interested in trying to create an antidote; unsurprising, given her current situation. Cautiously, you sidestep your way around to the second pen, where the female Velociraptor is resting, keeping your gaze fixed on the scientist.</p>
<p>The female Velociraptor stares blankly at you, barely even blinking; it doesn't take a psychologist to tell that she's deeply depressed. "Don't worry," you tell her. "I'm going to make this bastard fix everything he's done; we'll get you back to normal." She cocks her head; her inhuman face is difficult to read, but it seems like she understands you. You flash a toothy grin at her. "And <i>then,</i>" you whisper, "we'll get back at him for doing this. We'll haul his ass into court and take him for everything he's worth."</p>
<p>She cheers up a bit, or at least that's the way you interpret her reaction. You feel sorry for her; you might be in a bad situation, but she can't even <i>talk.</i> It's interesting that she seems to be able to understand you; maybe she has some kind of aphasia caused by getting turned into a full Velociraptor and, presumably, getting stuck with a brain of the same size. You promise yourself that if she comes out of this with any permanent disabilities, you're going to stick the scientist with <i>every single IV bag he has.</i></p>
<p>As you're contemplating this, the scientist calls you over. "I've got it ready," she says, pulling a syringe out of some kind of machine hooked to her computer. You cross your arms across your chest, staring at her expectantly. Sighing, she swabs down an area of her skin. "I can't promise this will work at all," she says, "but here goes." She carefully pokes the needle under her skin and empties the syringe into her bloodstream.</p>
<p>It takes several minutes for the changes to start. She returns to about the same level of anthropomorphism as you, but doesn't grow back to her original size. After a few minutes with no further changes, she sighs and hangs her head. "Damn," she says. "I was afraid this would happen.",</p>
<p>"Afraid <i>what</i> would happen?" you ask.</p>
<p>"I told you that my techniques use nanotechnology," she says. "I gave my nanobots the ability to identify and neutralize nanobots from other sources; they caught the nanobots in the second injection and destroyed them before they could complete their work. It's like a nanotech immune system; the nanobots in your body and mine are networked, since they're part of the same injection, which means we're both immune to the effects of any other nanotechnology."</p>
<p>You're shaken, but you do your best to not show it, trying instead to maintain your scowl. "What about <i>her?</i>" you ask, pointing towards the pen where the female Velociraptor is kept.</p>
<p>The scientist shrugs. "Her nanobots aren't networked, and use an older, less sophisticated detection program, so it'll probably work better on her than it did on me, but they'll probably still catch on before she can be returned completely to normal."</p>
<p>Reasoning that a partial cure is better than none at all, you have the scientist fill another syringe and inject the female Velociraptor. Even if she only changes back to your level of anthropomorphism, it'll be good to have a friend in this situation instead of just an enemy-turned-reluctant ally.</p>
<p>As before, it takes several minutes to start working. You watch as her body structure becomes more and more humanoid, her legs becoming slightly more human in proportion, and her arms growing from crippled little scratching mechanisms to fully articulated human-like arms. Her head also becomes more human, her jaws returning to the bottom of her face, though still more pronounced than a human's. Long black hair grows from her scalp, matching beautifully with her rich green skin, as she grows back to human size. Her figure becomes more curvy and feminine and her chest expands into two breasts as her previously reptilian genitalia become mammalian again, leaving her just as human as you. Then the changes cease as the immune-system nanobots do their job.</p>
<p>"Can...can I talk now?" she asks aloud. "Oh! Oh, I can <i>talk!</i>" She smiles a broad, human smile, her eyes gleaming even brighter than her razor-sharp fangs. "Oh, <i>thank you!</i>" she laughs, tackle-hugging you. The sensation of her breasts mashing against yours is bizarrely unfamiliar and slightly disconcerting, but she's too happy for you to say anything. She joyfully rambles on for several minutes, happy just to have her speech back, before you manage to calm her down enough to have a conversation.</p>
<p>Her name, you find out, is Alex; like you, she used to be male. She's currently happy just to be at all humanoid again, but also wants to return to her old body as soon as it can be managed. She overheard the scientist (whose name, you find out, is Dr. Anderson) explain about the immune-system nanobots, and suggests that she could try to create hacking software for the doctor's nanobots, so that they could try to disable the immunity nanobots and enable you to return to human form. Dr. Anderson, feeling much more cooperative now that she has a real incentive to find a cure, offers to provide the documentation for her nanobot platform, and suggests that if they can't be hacked, a strong electromagnetic field might disable them. Returning to human form might be difficult, but at least you're not out of options yet.</p></p>
