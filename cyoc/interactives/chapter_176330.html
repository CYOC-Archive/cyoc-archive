<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yeah, we&#39;re uhh, we just met a few weeks ago, but I can tell we&#39;re gonna be fast friends. We both like the same clothes, similar taste in guys...&quot; Jay said in a natural enough sounding tone of voice. Maybe it WAS just to make sure Maria had no doubts about the two of them. He did seem to be settling into his new role and his new identity remarkably easily. Though as Emma ended up reminding herself, Jay wasn&#39;t a typical dumb jock. He was a politically minded guy...though as this went on maybe she needed to start questioning that last part. She was starting to worry about whether there was indeed some greater mental effect from the Chronivac&#39;s transformation.<br />
<br />
The rest of the ride was quiet, except for when &quot;Jaya&quot; spoke up to point out some rather handsome young men on the road - a pair of jocks who looked to be on their way to the gym. Long blond hair and a slightly more strongly built body, tall and handsome, and his friend, a more tanned dark haired boy who looked like he was multi-ethnic - probably white, Native American, Mexican... and very well toned indeed. In more of a cut than his friend. Even Emma admitted she saw why Jay in his current state might be affected strongly...<br />
<br />
Though she hoped he was just putting on an act. She could hope, right? It wasn&#39;t too inexplicable, it wasn&#39;t too far a step yet. Jay hadn&#39;t actually done anything untoward. She just...was reading into his actions as cover rather too strongly. For now, Emma just sighed and remained seated. Listening to Maria and &quot;Jaya&quot; chatter about those two. Luke and Wes were supposedly inseparable, and there were apparently stories of the two even going as far as desperately wanting to fuck the same woman.<br />
<br />
And even when the two of them touched one another in the act, it was all no homos from there to the finish line. Even when it was obvious what was going on there...<br />
<br />
The stories went on, and Emma recognized that Maria was filling &quot;Jaya&quot; in on the local prominent boys. Thus she had mentioned Luke and Wes, the &quot;closeted duo&quot; unreasonably fond of each other. She mentioned Terry&#39;s best friend Luis who supposedly carried a torch for Terry. She mentioned Nolan Brooker, the baseball stud that had suddenly gained more than 40 lbs of muscle in a year and it wasn&#39;t steroids he SWORE. Somehow he wasn&#39;t caught for that one, even when the evidence was blatant.<br />
<br />
Jay was now that Emma noted it obviously enhancing his reactions. He already knew who all these people were, but he needed to convince her he didn&#39;t. Maybe...maybe Emma was worrying about nothing. Jay had all this under control. <br />
<br />
He was his own man...or woman...or however he identified himself right now. Regardless of what was going on, he really was settling into this easily.<br />
<br />
Before long though, the car arrived at their destination.<br />
<br />
Jay and Emma both recognized when they came up on the party house. They could hear it from the car! The house was two stories tall, and the windows were open, music blaring from the inside as raucous young adults partied through the evening.  The front door was manned by Luis, who was dressed in an unbuttoned white dress shirt and tight jeans, showing off his powerfully toned, muscular body. As Jay got out of the car and started to head over at the head of the group, he was very blatantly affected by the display of masculinity from Luis.<br />
<br />
Emma just figured it was an act and followed along though.<br />
<br />
Jay approached the front and said to Luis, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m...Jaya, and I was invited here by Terry. Do you uh, do you have like a guest list or anything---?&quot;<br />
<br />
If this was fake stammering it was some of the most convincing Emma had ever heard. Jay was obviously not that experienced with how he was reacting to all of this.<br />
<br />
Luis realized pretty quickly what was going on, and looked Jaya over, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re Terry&#39;s new girl. Proceed inside...and don&#39;t bother pining after yours truly. I&#39;m gay as the day is long...&quot; He said that quite assertively, though he then said, &quot;...however I can appreciate a woman who can bench as much as me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay bit his lip in response lightly, but then smiled and continued inside. Emma following shortly after.<br />
<br />
If Jay thought he was used to the way parties were as a guy, it felt almost overwhelming when he was now shorter, more sensitive, and with all these strange feelings roiling around in his chest. It did not take long for Jay to say that he was &quot;just going to go ahead and enjoy himself.&quot; The living room was mostly a dance floor, and the large generous kitchen was where everyone got their snacks, drinks, and other refreshments. There was another room near the back where evidently people were relaxing, among other things.<br />
<br />
Jay immediately headed toward the dance floor, employing his usual capacity for dancing, though it seemed with the way his body was constructed now, he needed to do things a bit differently. And honestly, in the thick of it as he was, he could almost say in this feminine body he enjoyed dancing and partying more. He heard some cracks about a &quot;muscle woman&quot; showing up, and he promptly flexed his biceps in response near the edge of the crowd.<br />
<br />
But as he kept dancing he found himself being drawn not toward the women on the dance floor...but toward the men. Jay found himself wondering if this was in some part his newly female trending libido acting on him. He...he still liked Emma, and after all he&#39;d fucked her not too long ago. <br />
<br />
There couldn&#39;t be some grand reorientation, could there? He was only 60% female 40% male, and he still by and large had his muscles and sensibilities, right? Jay contemplated this as he kept on dancing, not willing to give up on his enjoyment for the sake of some gazing at his navel.<br />
<br />
But before long Jay found himself dancing alongside - and then right up on one of the guys Maria told him about. Nolan Brooker. Nolan had previously been a slender preppy type, well coiffed dirty blond hair, dark blue eyes, and slightly tanned skin. But then Nolan both jumped on the gym and jumped on the steroids. Now he was visibly a lot bigger than his previous weight of 150. Jay swore Nolan had to be about 225 lbs. His former look was gone. His hair was rougher and shorter cut, his biceps bulged and his traps stood out noticeably. And even in his polo shirt, Jay could detect the roid gut. His face was less slenderly pretty and more lantern jawed brutish masculinity.<br />
<br />
And despite knowing all of what Nolan did to himself, Jay couldn&#39;t help himself but dance with this big guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe, haven&#39;t seen someone as built as you around. You lift a lot?&quot; And of course Nolan&#39;s voice. It was deeper than it had been before.<br />
<br />
Jay knew he shouldn&#39;t get too terribly involved, especially not with Nolan. He...he wasn&#39;t even into guys, right? But Jay found himself answering, &quot;I&#39;m...kinda new around here. And yeah, that I do. You look pretty impressive. What&#39;s your name?&quot; Jay said it all almost automatically. So as not to seem awkward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I uhh, I lift like, a lot. My name&#39;s Nolan Brooker. Maybe you and I could hit the gym some time together.&quot; Nolan awkwardly chuckled, and Jay realized they were dancing closer to one another before long. And he...didn&#39;t honestly mind. Thankfully he&#39;d kept all that stuff on under his skirt so Nolan wouldn&#39;t detect anything. Because right now Jay was strangely enough feeling like he was getting toward a semi under there. Why oh why was he interested in Nolan of all people?<br />
<br />
He blushed - blushed! - and responded, &quot;Yeah uh, I think I&#39;d like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma watched the ensuing events, thinking this had to be a show Jay was putting on. He wasn&#39;t actually seriously dancing that hot and heavy with Nolan Brooker was he?<br />
<br />
Maria whistled from the sideline, sipping at a drink and commented, &quot;Hey, seems Jaya likes her men extra big and filled with extra ingredients.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;---She just, uh, is really all about the gym. I guess I didn&#39;t tell you she&#39;s pretty easily impressed by muscular, big guys.&quot; Emma covered, hoping and praying in her heart of hearts that this was going to be the limit to how far Jay took this. After all, he couldn&#39;t actually have sex with anyone here. He still had his masculine unit underneath it all. Still, Emma decided she&#39;d watch out and make sure her boyfriend didn&#39;t get too carried away.<br />
<br />
Jay for his part kept dancing with Nolan, realizing before long he was letting his hands drift over Nolan&#39;s body. Feeling up his build. Was he taking this too far? Jay was...Jay was straight, wasn&#39;t he? Then why was he getting so hot and heavy here? And why couldn&#39;t he stop himself? ...Did he want to stop himself?</p>
