<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wayne absolutely loved Matt. He loved everything about him. But something about this current obsession with his computer… didn’t feel right. He wouldn’t discuss what he was doing, and Wayne’s <i>modus operandi</i> was to uncover hidden secrets. <br />
<br />
So he was being a bit of a devil. He decided to use Matt’s bathroom break to take a peek at his computer. He knew Matt well enough that his computer wouldn’t be locked. Regardless, time was of the essence. The idea that he could walk through the door at any moment gave Wayne a sense of urgency. <br />
<br />
He slid over to the desk, furiously shook the mouse, and - just as suspected - the computer had been left on. Good.<br />
<br />
There were a few programs left running: a spreadsheet document with boring budgeting work (meh), a PDF for something related… (nnrgh), and some kind of “Chronivac” program. <br />
<br />
He was ready to check Matt’s browsing history next. But on a whim he opened up the Chronivac tab, maximized the window, and... <br />
<br />
There it was.<br />
<br />
It took a couple seconds for him to realize what he was looking at. When his brain caught up with his eyes, it was mesmerizing. Somehow it was a full 3D rendition of Wayne on Matt’s PC. It was very much Wayne&#39;s face, and intensely accurate-looking. Awe overshadowed what should have been overwhelming uncomfortableness. He should have felt perturbed about there being… art of him without his knowledge. But he could also sense Matt&#39;s admiration through its source. He must’ve spent so much time redesigning his boyfriend in a virtual space… days even.<br />
<br />
“This is what Matt’s been looking at?” Wayne asked nobody but himself. He was incredulous of the prospect that his boyfriend was a secret master of 3D computer graphics.<br />
<br />
The other thing he noticed about the program: to the right of the rendered image were a shit-ton of drop-down settings. They said various things like “Profile,” “Type of satyr,” “fur color,” “skin color,” “hoof color,” and some rather suggestive things, too.<br />
<br />
Wayne stifled a bit of laughter. &#39;Y’know what... this is <i>totally</i> a thing Matt would be into,&#39; he thought.<br />
<br />
He clicked a “Profile” drop-down where his name was listed; Matt’s name was the only other option available. He clicked it, which made the rendered image of Wayne disappear. After a few moments, a new one popped up - and this time, it was a near-perfect 3D image of Matt. As a satyr.<br />
<br />
This is incredible, Wayne thought. It got him stirring for more almost instantly; he had always had fantasies of what Matt&#39;d be like if he was a satyr like himself...<br />
<br />
Curiously, the drop-down “Type of satyr” was pre-populated with ‘Goat (traditional)”. He clicked on it, expecting to learn what a &#39;non-traditional&#39; satyr was. Instead a long list of different types of animals and things appeared. Entranced by the whole thing, he clicked a couple - like &#39;tiger&#39; and &#39;lizard&#39; - and watched with bemusement as the lower half of Matt&#39;s body got spliced to the chosen animal. Like, it had taken what was satyr-specific and replaced it with lizard-like features, along with some small adjustments like pointed teeth or a pronounced mouth and nose. Some of the settings also changed to account for lizard scales, weight, and further facial adjustments... <br />
<br />
This was a crazy-advanced modeling program. Wayne didn’t know how to feel about satyrs being compared to basic goats, either. But shit - he shouldn&#39;t play around much more without risking fucking something up or getting caught. He had to make sure Matt didn’t know he was snooping around; he could come out at any moment.<br />
<br />
He had to get the original settings back. Maybe Matt had saved it, and he could load the last save and discard these changes? <br />
<br />
Oh; there was an Undo button. He could click back until it was back on his own image. Easy.<br />
<br />
On the top navigation bar, he found the Undo button, and clicked it - noting each change back to the last-clicked setting - and kept clicking until, finally, the render of Wayne reappeared.<br />
<br />
Phew! Okay. That’s enough for now. He clicked Save, and prepped to get up and leave when a message appeared:<br />
<br />
                    “Default: Commit settings on Save. Click Start to confirm. --Start/Cancel--”<br />
<br />
He rolled his eyes. Highly technical programs always had the most robotic mumbo-jumbo. Without a thought, he clicked Start and --<br />
<br />
<b>FLASH! </b><br />
<br />
Until then Wayne hadn’t noticed a questionable-looking device tucked behind the computer screen. Was… was it a camera? Did Matt have a camera set up to take pictures? Was he being *recorded*??<br />
<br />
Holy shit. He didn’t know what to do. Wayne quickly got up from the chair, mind reeling from the flash and his indecisiveness. What was it? It didn’t look like a camera. It looked like a box with a few miniature lights on it. <br />
<br />
Hmmph. The thought of Matt recording him… it… aroused him.<br />
<br />
But now he had a slight migraine, so he decided that it was more pertinent to stop staring at electronic screens and clean up the kitchen. Migraines happened occasionally, especially during the affectionately named “rutting season”. He’d pop a pill or two, maybe run by Sundoe’s for some coffee, and then go home. Hopefully he didn’t look too frazzled, because he certainly couldn’t walk a straight line right now. And that would get a few snickers or nods at the office tomorrow.<br />
<br />
*-*<br />
<br />
Five minutes later, Matt finally came out of the bathroom. At first it was difficult for Matt to comprehend all the newfound knowledge of this shared-species world. But then, in an instant, everything he was looking at… he knew already. So what was he doing looking through Logan’s profile?<br />
<br />
It was nice having Wayne over, but he wanted to get Wayne home so he could use the Chronivac some more. That’s all he wanted to do. With the power it held, he couldn’t deny it: he was addicted. He was anxious to try more changes, to try more crazy things. Hopefully none of it would change things on other people like his equine cock transformation had, but he was struggling to remember if anything had happened since...<br />
<br />
Well. Was he still afraid of using the device? A bit. He wasn’t a thrill-seeker, but who would blame him for wanting to experiment? He didn&#39;t have all the details, but the machine most definitely worked. The entire world and all the problems in Matt’s life could melt away at the snap of his fingers. All that mattered now was what he wanted to do. He had the power to do something about every problem. He was in power, and he intended to use that power (at least for now) to make his dreams a reality.<br />
<br />
And yet, where should he draw the line? There was a motive to fix things for people, like diseases or mental illnesses. He was certainly willing and able to do it, but doing so could unintentionally mess something else up. Hmmph. <br />
<br />
What he wanted was more exciting than solving world problems. He wanted to be comfortable and live life the way he wanted. He wanted to love Wayne, to be loved, and be the best and most interesting boyfriend possible.<br />
<br />
Wayne was finishing up the dishes in the kitchen. He watched Matt cautiously, because of course he went directly to his computer. That Chronivac program was so interesting and he wanted Matt to show it to him, but he wasn&#39;t supposed to know about it. He tried to play it cool. <br />
<br />
“Hey, I think I’m gonna run to Sundoe’s then head on home. Want anything from there, love?”<br />
<br />
Matt shook his head, not turning around. “Nah, the coffee’ll just keep me up. Thanks for cleaning up, babe.” <br />
<br />
They shared a kiss goodnight, and Wayne threw back on his jacket. “No prob. I guess you&#39;re busy with that computer work, so... see you tomorrow? I think there’s some *ahem* unfinished business here...” He wagged his tail a bit at Matt, to make sure the innuendo hit home.<br />
<br />
Matt guffawed at the satyr. Of course, what he thought was foreplay was not the only thing Wayne wanted to suss out from Matt. He had to use his, uh, natural skills to get Matt to show him the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
“You’re about to leave, and you start tempting me already?” <br />
<br />
Wayne winked and blew another kiss as he clopped out the door. “Yeah, I know you like this. But enough for now; I don&#39;t wanna interrupt your important computer work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt turned around at this, and gave him a look of yearning frustration mixed with confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you, my stallion...” <br />
<br />
With that, Wayne walked out of his apartment into a new world. Unbeknownst to either of them, this one was now shared by humans and satyrs alike indefinitely. <br />
<br />
It was just the way things had always been -- or was it? Because according to Matt, a new reality from the norm was still a few button clicks away, and he wanted to get to exploring it...</p>
