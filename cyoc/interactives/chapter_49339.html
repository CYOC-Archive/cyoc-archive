<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fran and Darla easily with their near herculean strength pushed open the garage door and <br />
pushed in the Buick and Bronco with one hand each. Darla searched for the light switch <br />
(fairly easy given their apparent nightvision). <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I'm surprised we can see in colors sister, wolves aren't supposed to be able to <br />
do that.&quot; Darla said as she found the switch and flipped it on, &quot;And yet we can still see <br />
better than any human in darkness apparently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm surprised too sister, after all we are wolves now. But master did say that he had <br />
become The Big Bad Wolf, a creature of fiction.&quot; Fran said pushing then pulling on the cars <br />
to make sure they didn't crash into a set of that year's newest imported cars in front of <br />
them. <br />
<br />
&quot;And a fictional wolf, which are not supposed to be able to walk and talk to begin with, <br />
could be able to see in colors.&quot; Darla said looking around for the tools needed for the <br />
grim task. Darla knew precisely how much Fran was proud of that car, but what had to be <br />
done had to be done, and the sooner it was done the better for the pack and the master. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we can swallow people whole like in the myth sister?&quot; Fran asked putting <br />
both cars in park. <br />
<br />
&quot;I do not know sister. Perhaps if master IS the Big Bad Wolf and we are his pack.&quot;  Darla <br />
answered hunting for the work bench which turned out to have rather overpriced pieces of <br />
fancy equipment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sister perhaps. It would be useful if we needed someone but didn't have the game <br />
with us at the time.&quot; Fran answered leaping over the hoods of the cars and helping her <br />
twin hunt for the equipment needed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sister it would be. We should ask master if an experiment is in order.&quot; Darla <br />
continued. Though both twins knew doing this with someone who had a buzz-saw or an <br />
Uzi on them would suicide. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sister we should ask our master.&quot; Another thought occurred to Fran, &quot;Do you think <br />
maybe since the Big Bad Wolf only fell to an axe and boiling water before that we might be <br />
immune to other injuries?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not know what to think sister. But I we really really REALLY SHOULD NOT make <br />
assumptions and rely on such, it is also perfectly possible that a bullet to the head could <br />
kill us as easily as anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran nodded, &quot;You are very very VERY RIGHT sister. We must NOT make assumptions, and <br />
until we learn more about how master's transformation has effect on ours if at all, we must <br />
assume we are as killable as any creature of flesh and blood.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A wise precaution sister. We should take precautions on the assumption that while faster <br />
and stronger than any human we are still as killable as any of them.&quot;  It didn't feel at all <br />
strange for Darla to call humans 'them' after all, they were part of the pack of Big Bad <br />
Wolves, a pack that would grow bigger and bigger with each new cub and each new recruit <br />
brought into the game. <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed we should.&quot; Fran said then took a pair of wielding googles and gloves handed <br />
them to her twin (though they ended up with holes quickly for their claws, unlike cats, <br />
wolves can't seethe their claws).<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sister.&quot; Darla answered putting on the goggles and gloves, (made more <br />
comfortable by her ears being on the top of her head rather than the sisters. She <br />
wondered for a moment if this place had any motorcycles she could modify to carry her <br />
and her twin. Of course she'd have no place to go with them until some far more distant <br />
point in the pack's future (with lots of good luck on top of it), but that was the future, <br />
right now they had a very important task ahead of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome sister.&quot; Fran answered, and with all her police knowledge of how chop shoppers <br />
went about their stock-in-trade Fran took an axe (from another nearby tool bench not <br />
meant for the cars of course), and without an iota of hesitation began taking apart the <br />
Ford Bronco she had driven her family in more times then she could count, and without a <br />
trace of regret began rendering an unrecognizable mass of spare parts her twin equally <br />
sharing in the duty handed them by their master working effectively and efficiently. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform? What's that?&quot; Asked Jennifer's mother (Jennifer Smith the First). <br />
<br />
&quot;How dare you come in like this with such a silly game?&quot; Demanded Jennifer's father <br />
(Bartholomew Smith). <br />
<br />
Jensen felt a wave of panic. The Dare had been purely on his parent -both- choosing one <br />
or the other! Each of them choosing one or the other could break the Dare! Jensen got <br />
really to burst in there and make sure that Kaylee's parents didn't try to be heroes, but <br />
instead Kaylee's parents answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform means you'll be changed in some way.&quot; Said Kaylee's mother.<br />
<br />
Kaylee's father said, &quot;And dare means you'll have to do whatever and anything that's told to <br />
you. After that, the game is given to each of you, and to Transform or Dare someone else <br />
as well as either of you choose.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen felt a giant wave of relief. 'Apparently the game doesn't allow the victim to -<br />
accidently- chose one or the other but has to willing chose one within the time limit.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Though you really need to know you only get one minute to decide,&quot; Said Kaylee's father <br />
(Jensen had never bothered to ask what either of their names were), &quot;After that, you'll be <br />
subject to both. And that was about thirty five seconds ago.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear these two are crazy let's throw me out now.&quot; Bartholomew said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know it's absurd dear, but just to be on the safe side we shouldn't agree to something <br />
that'll make us hand over our home and life savings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twenty five seconds.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bartholomew had never believed in curses or hexes or voodoo or any such 'garbage' in his <br />
life. His wife on the other hand had some dabbling in the occult but ultimately it was just <br />
for fun and she never took any of it seriously. But it did leave a small trace of lingering <br />
doubt if maybe, just maybe, it would be smart to play it safe. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear we should take the transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're taking this seriously-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't want to do something we'll regret! No matter how they change us we can <br />
recover!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do it Bartholomew or I will.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bartholomew Smith sighed and said, &quot;Fine! We both take transform.&quot; <br />
<br />
Now thinking about it, Jensen realized he should have just had only one of Kaylee's parents <br />
use the game, instead of wasting both when Kaylee had proven only one asker would do <br />
for more than one victim. 'I'll have to remember to take that into account in the future.' <br />
<br />
Jensen was disappointed, he had been hoping his parents would chose 'Dare' unsure about <br />
the transformation, and or would have kept arguing for a double-wammy. And with the <br />
Dare, they have been in a better position to set thing up for the pack's occupation of the <br />
estate. Now he just hoped their new selves would be able to handle it. Also it would have <br />
made things easier with Kaylee's parents much easier. 'At least Darla's Dare included them <br />
answering 'Transformation' next time they're asked.' <br />
<br />
Kaylee's parents spoke &quot;You shall transform into nine year olds (human biological years) <br />
Big Bad Wolf cubs of your respective genders. You will have hearts and minds of children <br />
but be cub prodigy smart enough to play the stock market and keep the estate and it's <br />
other holdings running and stable without being seen by the public and will do so with <br />
zeal and loving devotion your Master Jensen and the rest of the pack and will use the <br />
Game only to further the pack unless given permission by master Jensen. It'll happen slow <br />
enough that Jensen will be able to observe and enjoy your body changing and mind <br />
changing, but you will not be able to cause any trouble until your bodies and minds have <br />
finished changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Free of the Dare at last Kaylee's parent turned to run, somewhere, anything, someplace, <br />
anyplace, but the moment the last word had left their mouthes the door to the office came <br />
down with a crash it's hinges broken like cheap clay Kaylee on top. Not a nanosecond later <br />
like an athlete with a gymnastics competition Kaylee foreword flipped, onto the backs of <br />
her parents knocking the wind out of them and holding them down with her body weight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, dad, we've really got to stop having to do this sort of thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen examined the door frame and ducked down and calmly stepped through onto the <br />
fallen rosewood door. 'This is getting to be a Big Bad Wolf tradition.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Was my impulsiveness a good thing this time Master?&quot; Kaylee asked confidently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... yes it was.&quot; Jensen answered. <br />
<br />
Bartholomew and Jennifer I were shocked and terrified at what they saw, the moment the <br />
two intruders had finish speaking non-sense, a giant wolf monster smashed down their <br />
expensive office door, then landed on the two intruders like a cat almost pouncing on a <br />
couple of mice. Then an even larger monster ducked through their door frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello mom, hello dad, things are about to change very very much around here.&quot; Said the <br />
giant monster as it sat down in an large plus office chair bending it's tail so it came out <br />
underneath it in the front and crossed it's legs male style. Jennifer I was momentary <br />
distracted by the monster's seethe much as Bartholomew was by the first monster's two <br />
assets. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT?&quot; Bartholomew demanded putting himself <br />
between this thing and his wife. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's me dad, it was Jennifer, but you can call me Master Jensen or Alpha Male Jensen or Big <br />
Bad Wolf Jensen or just Master or Alpha for short. By the way, the Game's real in case you <br />
didn't already guess, I think it's been a BIG improvement in my life.&quot; Jensen laughed at his <br />
own joke. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know Master,&quot; She Kaylee still pinning her parents but getting a look around the <br />
impressive office, &quot;These doors are becoming more a annoyance than help, I think when <br />
we renovate this place they should be the first thing to go.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;An excellent point Kaylee, but I think we'll only modify the outside doors not remove <br />
them like the rest. Wouldn't want it to get cold at night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh Master, I can -promise- I can take care of that myself.&quot; She said sultry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe my mate, but I think the outside doors will stay for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Jensen turned his attention to his parents, due to to the dare precisely <br />
instructing that the transformation would happen so Jensen would enjoy it perhaps, while <br />
not having a delay, only now began. It was fun to watch as fur started to cover his parent's <br />
bodies.<br />
<br />
Bartholomew wanted to do something, -anything- but found himself unable to flea or <br />
attack the monster saying it was his daughter, Jennifer was much the same way due to the <br />
conditions of the transform. <br />
<br />
He could only look at his hands as they began to be covered in fur. &quot;What-what's going <br />
on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You DO remember what the transform was right?&quot; Jensen asked calmly and with a hint of <br />
arrogance and glee at his parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not possible, it's impossible, this can't actually be happening...&quot; Bartholomew swore <br />
up and down. <br />
<br />
&quot;You'll believe it all soon enough dad. Though it won't be right to CALL you dad soon <br />
enough.&quot; Jensen leaned back in the relatively comfortable chair and sat back to enjoy the <br />
show. 'I am SO going to enjoy this!' <br />
<br />
 &quot;Hey mom dad, keep your eyes peeled, this is a preview for your act I think.&quot; Kaylee said <br />
to her parents excited. She then quietly as not to distract her beloved Master, &quot;Make any <br />
trouble and that promise to break your arms and legs still stands, no way in hades you're <br />
ruining this for Master!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen waited in anticipation to see how the transformation played out this time. Having <br />
missed the transformation of the minds and bodies of the twins, he wasn't about to miss a <br />
-second- of this!</p>
