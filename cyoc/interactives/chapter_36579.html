<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sally awoke refreshed. Her feet were no longer sore but something about them felt off. She chose not to look at them at the moment.<br />
<br />
She crawled out of bed and walked to the bathroom. When the linoleum floor felt different against her feet, she looked down.<br />
<br />
Anyone within a ten kilometer radius would have heard her scream.<br />
<br />
Sally ran out of the bathroom before sitting on her bed with her left leg crossed over her right leg. She looked at her left foot. Her foot was longer, thicker, stronger and only had three toes with the middle toe easily as large as all three toes that she assumed it used to be. If that wasn't enough, all three toes had claws.<br />
<br />
The ointment had violated her right foot in much the same fashion.<br />
<br />
A knock on her front door made Sally realize just how loud she'd screamed.<br />
<br />
Sally uncrossed her legs and looked at her feet.<br />
<br />
She knew that she couldn't pretend to not be home. People would worry something was seriously wrong and call the police. With paw like feet like this, Sally feared she'd end up in a lab somewhere.<br />
<br />
With a gulp, she got of the bed and walked to the front door and opened it. Her neighbor from across the hall, Pete stood there with an expression of concern. Sally realized that she was only wearing panties and a tee shirt but she was occupied with other concerns at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally are you all right?&quot; Pete asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine,&quot; Sally replied with more bitterness then she intended.<br />
<br />
More then anything, Sally didn't want Pete to look at her feet. Her desires were in vain. Pete looked right at her feet as though drawn to them.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God Sally, what happened to…”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. They were sore yesterday so I got this ointment from this place and put it on and when I woke up, they were like this!”<br />
<br />
“Well, we need to get you to a hospital,” Pete said.<br />
<br />
“No,” Sally protested. “They’ll put me in a lab or want to amputate or both!”<br />
<br />
“That’s the worst case scenario,” Pete said. “Just stay calm. We’ll figure this out.”<br />
<br />
When Pete put a comforting hand on Sally’s shoulder, she felt a strange jolt. A new desire that seemed to come from nowhere appeared in her mind. She wanted Pete to massage her feet. The desire started as an idea then grew stronger until it was all she could think of. Normally, Sally would be nervous about asking for such a thing but this desire was also pushing out any inhibitions or shyness.<br />
<br />
Rational thought that would have Sally knowing the ointment was somehow affecting her and keep Sally from acting on said desire vanished in the sea of desire.<br />
<br />
“Wait, before that, could you rub them? They’re a little sore again and…”<br />
<br />
Pete appeared nervous.<br />
<br />
“Are you feeling all right?” Pete asked<br />
<br />
“Please, just touch them,” Sally said. “I want to feel your hands against them.”<br />
<br />
Pete’s eyes would have went wide as his face if he was a cartoon character.<br />
<br />
“Now you’re scaring me,” Pete said.<br />
<br />
Sally grabbed Pete’s right wrist and pulled him into her apartment.<br />
<br />
“I’m begging you Pete, I need this,” Sally said. “You won’t get infected or anything.”<br />
<br />
“All right, I guess just once won't hurt.”<br />
<br />
Sally almost dragged Pete to her bedroom where she lay with her inhuman feet at the ready. The moment Pete touched Sally’s feet, his concern seemed to melt away.<br />
<br />
An idea struck her. She grabbed the ointment bottle and tossed it to the end of the bed.<br />
<br />
“Here, use this,” Sally said.<br />
<br />
Pete picked up the bottle and looked at Sally. With a shrug of his shoulders, he opened the bottle and massaged the ointment onto Sally’s feet. Pleasure exploded all over Sally’s body. It was as though Pete had been doing this for years.<br />
<br />
The surface of Sally’s skin began to tingle before beige fur sprouted all over Sally, lighter on her chest and jaw. That didn’t dissuade Sally or Pete.<br />
<br />
It encouraged them.<br />
<br />
A tightness in Sally’s thighs that wasn't painful but not quite pleasurable was next. Her thighs and hips expanded to almost massive proportions as they moved to the sides of her torso and tore her panties to shreds.<br />
<br />
Sally was too lost in the pleasure to consider this odd.<br />
<br />
Pete was too lost in an obsessive impulse to massage Sally’s feet.<br />
<br />
The changes to Sally’s body didn’t stop there.<br />
<br />
Her torso began to expand into a thick beige furred tail that pressed against Pete’s face. Even that wasn’t enough to distract him.<br />
<br />
As Pete continued his massage, Sally felt a tingling in her chest, neither regions and abdomen. She removed her shirt and looked at her changing body to see her breasts deflate before they sunk into her chest and vanished. A tuft of light beige fur appeared where her breasts had been.<br />
<br />
Sally felt a strange tightness in her abdomen. She watched as the efforts of months, even years of exercise appeared in the form of a six pack that was visible even through the fur.<br />
<br />
The next sensation came from her nether regions. They felt as though something was filling in while something else was expanding down there.<br />
<br />
Sally gasped when she realized what was happening. She couldn't bring herself to ask Pete to stop. His massage felt too good.<br />
<br />
The last of the changes came as Sally’s mouth and nose grew out into a short muzzle, her ears grew taller and became furred before her short black hair turned brown and grew down her neck almost like a mane.<br />
<br />
It seemed complete and Sally snapped out of her trance just as her tee shirt shifted into a brown button shirt that wasn't quite her size and left her chest exposed as it appeared on her body.<br />
<br />
What was left of her panties turned to energy before flying up Sally’s body and taking the shape of a brim hat complete with ear holes as it regained material form.<br />
<br />
Pete ceased his massage as beige fur grew over Sally’s feet with pads appearing on the bottom.<br />
<br />
Sally and Pete seemed to regain their wits.<br />
<br />
“What happened to me?” Sally asked.<br />
<br />
She clasped her muzzle when she heard her voice. It was lower pitched and masculine.<br />
<br />
“I – Sally, you’re a kangaroo person – how is this…”<br />
<br />
Sally looked at her abdomen and neither regions.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God, it turned me into a guy!”<br />
<br />
Pete gasped. &quot;And a Kangaroo person!&quot;<br />
<br />
“Forget that. It turned me into a guy! Oh my God it even gave me a...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What have I done to you?” Pete cried.<br />
<br />
“You? I was the one that wanted you to massage my feet! It was all I could think about,” Sally said.<br />
<br />
Pete moved out of the way as Sally stood up.<br />
<br />
“Geeze, I even have a tail,” Sally said.<br />
<br />
Sally carefully walked into the bathroom and saw her reflection.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God,” she said. “I’m a guy and a guy kangaroo -- thing. What the hell was in that stuff? I have to get back to that place. I’ll sue the crap out of them! I’ll kick their asses. Then again, with these feet and legs, I’d probably put them in orbit.”<br />
<br />
“Why it turn you into a guy?”<br />
<br />
“How the hell should I know?” Sally asked. “Pardon me Pete, I have a bone to pick with…”<br />
<br />
Pete grabbed Sally’s shoulder. “Wait a second, you can’t just go outside looking like this and wearing only a shirt!”<br />
<br />
Sally folded her arms. “What else am I supposed to do? Anyway, you really can't see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes but still, I don't want the cops to arrest you for indecent exposure,&quot; Pete said.<br />
<br />
Sally out her hands on her hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've become a kangaroo man and all you can think about is them arresting me because you can just barley see my...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I guess that's a silly concern.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, what would you have me do? Massage the ointment into your feet? That might be interesting. At least I'd have a kangaroo friend. I wonder if you'd become a girl?” Sally asked with a sly grin.<br />
<br />
Pete held out his hands. “Okay, okay, but what if people ask about…”<br />
<br />
Sally shook her head. “I don’t plan on staying a kangaroo or a guy forever. I’ll tell them it’s a costume.”<br />
<br />
“I guess so. But what if the shop owner won’t give you a refund or what if…”<br />
<br />
“Bah, you worry too much,” Sally said. “Now if you’ll excuse me.”<br />
<br />
Sally was already out of her apartment and hoping down the hallway before Pete could think of another worry.</p>
