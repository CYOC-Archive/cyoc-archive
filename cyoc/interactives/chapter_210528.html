<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I headed out of the Mall with Sam beside me.  We talked about school, and some of the guys on the sports teams, especially wrestling and swimming.  Even though neither of us came out and admitted anything, it was pretty obvious we liked guys.  Home was just a few blocks away in a nice apartment building - much nicer than mine.  We took an elevator up to the third floor, and I went straight to our place.  Mom and Dad were watching TV in the living room, and waved as we came in.  Dad rolled his eyes but Mom just smiled as I said we were going to play some games in my room.<br />
<br />
&#39;My&#39; room.  It was amazing how all of this was normal to me.  I &#39;remembered&#39; my entire life, knew all my classes, all Chen&#39;s friends, and even how to play all of the computer games I had cartridges for.  Sam gaped at the collection and my pretty decent gaming system.  I had pulled off my backpack and kicked off my sneakers, then grinned as I tugged off my shirt and looked at Sam.  &quot;There are some more fun games we could try.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Sam flushed so red his face almost matched his hair, but he smiled uncertainly and slid off his own shoes.  &quot;Umm, that sounds like a better idea.  I think.&quot;  He watched as I leaned over to pull off each sock, and then undid my belt to let my pants slither down my legs, leaving me dressed in only my boxers.  It was pretty evident that I was not only well endowed, but also getting hard.  Sam hesitated, then slowly pulled off his shirt to reveal a very slender chest.  Then he stepped on the toes of his socks to pull his feet out of them.  After another moment, he undid his belt to let his pants drop down to the floor and stepped out of them.  He was wearing briefs, his much less substantial member also pushing the fabric out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can improve that.&quot;  I jumped as Runt appeared next to Sam, giving the young man&#39;s equipment a frown.  Before I could say anything, the small bump pressed out a lot further.  Sam looked puzzled, and then gasped when he looked down.  Only to seem puzzled again.  &quot;That&#39;s weird.  It felt like something had changed, but it all looks normal.&quot;  Then he remembered we were both in underwear and flushed again.  &quot;You still wanna play?&quot;<br />
<br />
I moved to stand in front of him and gently pulled his skivvies off, having to stretch the waistband over his 9&quot; erection.  Runt was watching with great interest, but Sam couldn&#39;t see him.  I took the end of his cock in my mouth and began to slowly slide my tongue around the head.  Sam shivered, and I felt his hands grip my hair.   I continued to luck and pull with my lips as Sam thrust a little deeper.  We continued, Sam moaning in pleasure.  His hands slipped up to my horns, and our tails intertwined as he...  I didn&#39;t stop pleasuring Sam, but was suddenly aware that we both looked like demons!  It was just horns and tails at first, but then we got incredibly aroused with inhuman capability.  I shot a load across the room while he came in my mouth several times. Then he pulled out and dropped to his knees, pressing his lips against mine and pushing his tongue into my cum-filled mouth.  Things became a blur after that - he was in me, I was in him, we were tangled in passionate embrace, tails wrapped around each other, sweating, moaning, cumming.  <br />
<br />
I woke still embraced by Sam, a happy smile on his sleeping face.  He looked mostly the same, except for the horns pushing out of his curly red hair.  I felt my tail twisted around his legs, and his tail wrapped around mine.  The door was still shut - it looked like Mom and Dad had either ignored the sounds of our &#39;gaming&#39; or Runt had sound-proofed the room.  Speaking of...  I found my demon friend sitting on the end of the bed, grinning.  &quot;So, did you enjoy yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!  It was amazing.  But...  we aren&#39;t really demons, are we?&quot;  Runt waggled his eyebrows.  &quot;Tails are pretty awesome, aren&#39;t they?  But no.  I just thought you&#39;d have more fun with the look.  Unless you want to keep everything?&quot;  He gave me a hopeful look.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I would like him to keep his, um, enhancements.&quot;  I felt more than saw my tail and horns vanish, followed by Sam&#39;s.  He retained his much larger manhood, though.  Runt&#39;s own tail curled around his waist. &quot;Your friend will remember it all, but think of the demon part as a dream.  He&#39;ll be needing plastic sheets from now on, thanks to some pretty spectacular wet dreams every night.&quot; He chuckled as Sam shifted and draped an arm over my chest.  &quot;Looks like two happy couples.  Lee didn&#39;t come home last night.  Your big brother had a sleepover at the blonde&#39;s house.&quot;<br />
<br />
I frowned, thinking of what might come next.  &quot;This was fun for a night, but I don&#39;t think going back through school is going to be much fun.  I just don&#39;t want to leave Sam stuck, or have Lee be unhappy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Runt chuckled.  &quot;Not an issue!&quot;  I blinked, for we were suddenly in a very different bedroom - a little smaller, no computer gaming system, and a twin bed instead of a double.  I suddenly felt wet and sticky, and slid off the mattress.  Runt grinned. &quot;Now you are part of the dream, and when Sam wakes up he&#39;ll have all that cum he shot into you on the bed.  And your brother Lee will have been an only child. Ready to go back to your place?&quot;</p>
