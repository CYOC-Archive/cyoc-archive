<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martin Stovall would never reveal that their repast at Shambala (a small resort between Moon Lake and Seattle that is open to the public but caters especially to the were community) came to over $100 for the four of them, because his wife and what they were celebrating were both worth the cost.<br />
With their dinner bill settled, the Stovalls and Eric Anderson started the journey back to Moon Lake.<br />
Melissa Stovall couldn&#39;t help catching glimpses of her daughter Julie and fiance Eric snuggling together in the back seat. If Martin wasn&#39;t driving, she would love to snuggle up to the man of her dreams too, but settled for lovingly caressing her stomach and the new life that was starting to form within her womb.<br />
&quot;That was some dinner, huh?&quot; asked Martin aloud, trying to drum up some conversation.<br />
&quot;Yes. Their chicken fried steak was much better than The Local Diner&#39;s,&quot; admitted Julie, referring to the Moon Lake eatery.<br />
&quot;Yet I think the portions are bigger at the diner,&quot; countered Eric.<br />
&quot;Maybe, but sometimes quality matters more than quantity,&quot; replied Melissa.<br />
&quot;True,&quot; agreed Martin. &quot;I think Pierre was actually a little sad to see us leave.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe he was hoping we&#39;d spend the night,&quot; suggested his wife.<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; agreed Martin, &quot;but from what little I saw, it didn&#39;t look like they were hurting for business.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe we can spend our honeymoon there,&quot; Julie suggested to Eric, while snuggling closer to him.<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but that&#39;s still several years off yet,&quot; he politely reminded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I endorse your relationship, I don&#39;t want to see the two of you rush off into anything,&quot; said Martin.<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t,&quot; both kids in the back seat promised in unison.<br />
&quot;Besides, we don&#39;t want to risk endangering our future and not having those prophecy dreams come true,&quot; added Eric.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Right now we&#39;re still a good decade away from Eric Junior, let alone Melinda,&quot; Julie reminded her parents. &quot;So why would we ever want to risk our Happily Forever After?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, considering how difficult it is to book some venues in advance, maybe we should at least inquire as to reserving space at Shambala for the summer between you two graduating high school and starting college,&quot; suggested Melissa.<br />
&quot;You mean for the wedding or our honeymoon mom?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why not both?&quot; she asked her daughter in return.<br />
&quot;What do you think Eric?&quot; Julie asked her finance.<br />
&quot;Whatever you want, my jewel,&quot; was his answer, before kissing her.<br />
<i>Only a 14 year old Freshman and already henpecked,</i> thought Martin with a silent chuckle.<br />
&quot;I know Martin and I have been saving for Julie&#39;s college fund since before she was born, but if I can ask, what about you Eric?&quot; wondered Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;As far as I know, my folks have been saving too, and if I go to Moon Lake College, my dad says I&#39;ll get a bit of a cost deduction since he&#39;s a member of the faculty,&quot; revealed Eric, referring to his English Professor father.<br />
&quot;Still thinking about something in the science field?&quot; Martin asked Eric, remembering the boy talking previously about his plans for the future.<br />
&quot;Yes, although I&#39;m still not certain exactly what at the moment,&quot; he admitted.<br />
&quot;Well, you have plenty of time yet to pin that down,&quot; Melissa reminded Eric.<br />
&quot;You know honey, you could enter the same field I&#39;m planning to. After all, Oceanography is a science,&quot; Julie seductively said to Eric.<br />
&quot;True, but I&#39;ve been all over the place between the ecology and digital technology and exoplanets(*1) and—&quot;<br />
&quot;I get the idea. We may know part of our personal future, but the professional still remains ours to decide.&quot;<br />
&quot;I knew where my future lied the moment I realized I fell in love with you,&quot; confessed Eric, before kissing Julie again.<br />
&quot;Aw...&quot; said Melissa.<br />
<br />
Being were-mers, Julie and Eric could and did kiss for a mighty long time without ever having to separate their lips.<br />
But when they did, Julie said, &quot;I need to role up this window. It&#39;s getting colder than I thought it would tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Guess our Indian Summer is over and winter is coming,&quot; realized Eric.<br />
&quot;So, you&#39;ve read the entire <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> saga(*2) too?&quot; asked Julie.<br />
&quot;What there is of it. When&#39;s George R. R. Martin going to finish Book 6, let alone the rest of the series?&quot; wondered Eric. (*3)<br />
&quot;Are you cold sweetie?&quot; asked her mother.<br />
&quot;A tad. Just the air rushing through the open window did it,&quot; explained Julie, &quot;but I feel better now.&quot;<br />
&quot;That reminds me. Just how much cold can us were-mers take?&quot; asked Eric.<br />
&quot;Not having fur like a lot of were species, it&#39;s akin to normal humans in some aspects,&quot; revealed Martin. &quot;We can take into the upper 50s without a sweater, but don&#39;t need a heavier jacket until the 40s. Water temperature is different though, since we don&#39;t have blubber or some other type of insulation like other aquatic animals or weres do. Although we obviously prefer warmer climates like anyone else, were-mers usually average to around the 50s in our natural environment, but can take to the upper 30s, depending upon how strong your personal endurance is. Yet we&#39;re as lousy trying to travel through ice as anyone else, so avoid swimming in those conditions as much as possible.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see. What about the opposite direction?&quot; asked Eric.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re the same as anyone else on dry land. In the water, at least to the mid 90s. Beyond that, depending upon how deep you are, you still risk heat exhaustion and heat stroke.&quot;<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; replied Eric.<br />
<br />
The rest of the drive was uneventful. Just random chit chat about this and that.<br />
Melissa noted that the young lovers never once stopped snuggling together the whole time until Martin announced, &quot;Okay. We&#39;re at Eric&#39;s house.&quot;<br />
&quot;I hate to go,&quot; admitted Eric, before reluctantly giving Julie one last kiss.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like saying goodbye to you either. Maybe we can Skype later?&quot; she suggested.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s already after 9 and tomorrow&#39;s a school day,&quot; Melissa announced.<br />
&quot;Can we at least stay in the driveway to make sure Eric makes it inside okay?&quot; asked Julie, even as she was lowering her window.<br />
&quot;Sure honey,&quot; replied her father.<br />
Eric got out, secretly as slowly as he could do so without being blatantly obvious, and walked around to where Julie sat.<br />
&quot;I love you my Jewel. See you tomorrow at school?&quot; he asked, leaning in the open window as much as he could to kiss her again.<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; she promised, before returning the kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Night Eric. Say hello to your folks for us, and thank them again for letting you join us for dinner,&quot; said Melissa Stovall through her now open car window.<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; the boy promised, casually walking up to the Anderson house&#39;s front porch.<br />
He turned and waved goodbye to his fiance and future in-laws, then reluctantly went in for the night.<br />
As Martin backed out of the Andersons&#39; drive way to head for the Stovall residence, he realized, <i>Eric and Julie act sometimes like they&#39;re conjoined at the hip or something, and separation means death. I know I pined for Melissa a lot before she finally realized we were meant for each other, but I don&#39;t recall ever being this forlorn about not being with my significant other. Maybe we can do something to help relieve their separation anxiety, like letting the kids use the cabana on weekends like their own little house. Whatever the answer, it&#39;s something I&#39;ll definitely have to talk to Melissa about privately.</i><br />
