<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finding Amy proved much more difficult than John had anticipated.  The forest was large, and the fairies were very small.<br />
<br />
Bechana did her best to please her new master.  She could smell the fairies, and sense their magic when they were close.  She was able to track them pretty well.  But they were clever fairies, and would often find other ways to escape when cornered.  <br />
<br />
John and Bechana spent several weeks together in the forest, their bond growing stronger as their relationship grew closer.  John decided he liked their horse better this way, and decided he would keep Bechana like this even after he had returned home with Amy.  It would be a little hard to explain, but it was worth it.  Bechana was special, almost like a real sister.  And she was kind of cool looking, majestic even.  He could see why Amy had liked the other Gryphon so much.<br />
<br />
Bechana liked her new master, too. He was funny looking, but very kind.  He always treated her with respect.  He never beat her, and he only admonished her when he absolutely had to.  He was very generous, and always gave her a larger share of their food.  He even let her curl up with him at night when she was cold.  His little warm body was very soothing and comforting.  Bechana loved her master, and wanted to stay by his side forever.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Finally, after several weeks,  John and Bechana had Amy and Mara cornered in a small cave.  Their would be no escaping now.  There was no exit, and the walls were too thick for them to teleport away.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Amy.  Enough is enough.  It&#39;s time for you to stop playing games and come home, &quot; said John.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not Amy, I&#39;m Amethyst! &quot; said Amy, as she crossed her arms and pouted.  &quot; And I am home.  Why don&#39;t you just leave us alone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you are my sister, and I love you, &quot; said John flatly.  He dismounted from Bechana, and affectionately rubbed her head.  Bechana smiled, relishing the loving attention her master gave her.  Then resumed guarding the exit with grim determination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Amy.  I miss you, &quot; said John sadly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I gave you a new sister.  What was wrong with her?&quot; asked Amy.<br />
<br />
John looked down at the ground.  &quot;She is very nice, but it&#39;s just not the same.  I don&#39;t love her like I do you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bechana was a little hurt, but she remained steadfast in her duties, and continued to obey her master.  A small tear trailed down her face.  Amy stared at the Gryphon with curiosity.<br />
<br />
Mary felt a little guilty.  &quot;Maybe he&#39;s right, Amethyst.  You belong with your family.  Did you bring the vials, John?&quot;<br />
<br />
John paled.  &quot;No.  I just thought I could make a wish like before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mara shook her head slowly.  &quot;After we mature, we can only grant one wish per person.  And you have already made yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy flew over to Bechana.  &quot;But there is someone else who can make a wish, &quot; said Amy, as she smiled widely.  &quot;What do you want, dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bechana paled and trembled.  A wish?  She knew what she really wanted, but did she dare say it?  What would he think?<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick, Bechana.  Wish that Amethyst was human again.  Do as your master commands!&quot; said John.<br />
<br />
Bechana ducked her head sadly, and tired to comply.  But Amy stopped her and wagged her finger at her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, uh. Naughty little gryphon.  You only get one wish.  Just give me a little time to grant it, &quot; said Amy, as she grunted.  She began to glow a little brighter, and a small cloud of pixie dust began to shimmer around her. <br />
<br />
&quot;What? She didn&#39;t say anything!  You are cheating,&quot; said John.<br />
<br />
Amy laughed.  &quot;Silly, human.  Bechana is magical creature, just like us.  I can read her mind.  And I know what her heart desires, &quot; said Amy as she stroked Bechana&#39;s beak.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, girl.  It shouldn&#39;t be hard to fulfill that wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
She flew over John and sprinkled him with pixie dust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  What the hell?  &quot; said John angrily.  He tried to brush the dust off of himself.  He looked at Bechana angrily.  &quot;What did you wish for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bechana was petrified.  She couldn&#39;t say.  Her master would hate her.  But she felt compelled to obey.  &quot;I .. I ...&quot; she stuttered.<br />
<br />
John suddenly grunted, and grabbed his chest.  His whole body ached.  Bechana ran to his side and tried to comfort him.  He looked up and pushed her away gently with one hand.  Or rather with one clawed talon.<br />
<br />
John and Bechana stared at his hand in shock, as it became less human and more like a talon, with thick yellow skin and sharp claws.  His chest swelled tearing his shirt, revealing small white feathers that quickly grew in size and spread over his head.  His shoes tore as his feet stretched into the paws of a large feline animal. His thighs thickened with muscle, ripping apart his pants and revealing tawny brown fur covering his legs and abdomen.  John&#39;s back cracked, and he was forced to a quadruped stance.  He groaned as he continued to grow larger, matching Bechana&#39;s size.  A long thin tail grew in rapid spurts from his spine. He arched his back as two large wings erupted from his back.<br />
<br />
Bechana watched John&#39;s transformation with mixed feelings.   She felt bad that she had hurt her master, but he was just becoming so ..... beautiful.  Even better than she had imagined.  <br />
<br />
John grunted and appeared to be coughing.  Suddenly his jaw shot forward, pushing back his lips.  It rapidly turned yellow, and grew into a long beak as his teeth shrank into his sharp beak.  John gave a loud screech as his painful transformation finally ended.  <br />
<br />
Bechana felt herself getting excited at the sound of the powerful Gryphon. She went beside him, and touched his talon.  The feel of his claw was thrilling.  &quot;Master, are you alright?  I am sorry, I didn&#39;t mean .....&quot;<br />
<br />
John shook his head.  &quot;It&#39;s alright.  We don&#39;t have time to worry about it now.  We have to get those fairies, &quot; said John in a deep powerful baritone.  The voice excited Bechana even more, and she felt her heart race a little.  John was no mere boy anymore, but rather a strong mature Gryphon.  <br />
<br />
But she recovered her wits and followed John&#39;s gaze.  During the confusion of John&#39;s transformation, the fairies had slipped past them and were fleeing out the cave entrance.   Amy turned and smiled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you two have fun.  Since we each have a partner, I guess you don&#39;t need to chase us anymore.  Toodle-oo!&quot; said Amy, as she turned around and flew out the cave.  <br />
<br />
Mara gave one sad mournful look back at the couple, then sighed and flew out the cave to join her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, we can still catch them.  You can still get a wish from Mara, &quot; said John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, &quot; said Mara, as she gripped his front talon with hers.  &quot;It is no use. They are gone.  Once in the forest, it will take some time to track them again.  It&#39;s almost dark.  We need to rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
John looked down at her hand on his.  He had never seen her act so .... forward and bold.  But she was right.  He sighed.  &quot;Yes, you are right.  We can rest here for the night.  We can begin our search in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish, Master,&quot; said Bechana.<br />
<br />
John sighed again.  &quot;Bechana, I think we have gotten to know each other well enough that you don&#39;t need to call me that anymore.  Given the present situation, it seems a little silly.  Why don&#39;t you just call me John?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bechana smiled.  He didn&#39;t just see her as a pet anymore, but rather as an equal.  Did she dare hope for more?  She wasn&#39;t sure of the extent of the fairies powers.  But for now she was happy just to curl up next to John and sleep.</p>
