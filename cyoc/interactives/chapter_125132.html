<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;But things are fine, now?&quot; William asked to Martin Stovall as the group finished what had been a late breakfast for most of them and a lunch for Martin Stovall, who&#39;d essentially completed the last of the work that he&#39;d need to be at City Hall for.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the most part,&quot; Martin answered, &quot;the crook is in surgery right now and they&#39;ll let me know if there are any further developments, but I&#39;ve been assured that all is well. I&#39;m sorry if anything came as too much of a surprise...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you couldn&#39;t have been truly sure on what this guy would do,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;and even if you&#39;re aware of the potential... warning everyone of the possible dangers of certain actions could be difficult... and in the end impractical, for in a situation like today&#39;s for fear that someone warns the criminal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin nodded, but was still honestly apologetic that he&#39;d had to sanction action that lead to a fight and the police having to fire their weapons. He was all for &quot;law and order,&quot; but he didn&#39;t want Moon Lake to gain the reputation of some stereotypical old west town, with a gun fight every few days. He knew enough about history that the Old West was not full of as many gun fights as the movies made them out to be. Thankfully, though, for the moment his audience was his wife and family, his future in-laws, and a &quot;fan.&quot; They then slid out of the booth and began make their way out and pay the tab as they left. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s good that the situation was resolved,&quot; William assured Martin as they reached the door, &quot;Not something I would have expected from a town as small as Moon Lake... but we can find surprising things just about everywhere. And in the end, it was resolved. So I wouldn&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha nodded, &quot;and with that all done and handled, we can all settle into a quiet afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything planned?&quot; Joyce asked, sounding a bit curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have some work to make sure I have next week&#39;s lectures planned out,&quot; William answered with a small sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I should keep going throw my study material for the Washington State PRAXIS,&quot; Martha said also.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Joyce gave a small shrug and looked down for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we WILL have to get together again, sometime,&quot; Martha assured her with a smile. She very much relished becoming a werecat. Just as becoming a werefox and feeling the &quot;bond&quot; helped William with the extra-marital issues that had been a problem before their move to Moon Lake, Martha had truly felt complete since becoming a werecat. Of course, she knew that once William had been scratched and became a were, she would need to be a were as well. It rushed her decision, but she had privately admitted to herself that before all of that happened, she had begun having flashes from her bi-side, and accepting it felt good. Becoming a werecat helped that, and she felt confident as one, and while William was the only man she could ever want or need, some fun with a female friend was welcome. And Martha was glad when Joyce gave a smile back.<br />
<br />
Eric followed along, holding Julie&#39;s hand and shook his head with a small smile as he watched his mother&#39;s glances with Joyce and his father. He&#39;d known that his parent&#39;s marriage had been loving, though strained, and his mother having repressed being bisexual was surprise, but he was happy that the main issues between them had healed so fully. It was different from how he saw his future with Julie, but his parents were happy and in love, and that was all that mattered to Eric. Having learned so much on what love was and how it worked... by falling so hard for Julie... that was all that mattered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose we&#39;ll have some homework to finish,&quot; Eric admitted to Julie, readying for the likelihood of having to be separate from her for the afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have too much to finish,&quot; Julie said to him, giving Eric&#39;s hand a squeeze, &quot;and there is still an &quot;over-night&quot; bag to pack that I can take home with me... Until then... maybe... we could just... dance?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric felt himself smile at that and soon nodded.  He&#39;d need to retrieve his Halloween costume from the Stovalls, of course, but that wouldn&#39;t be too hard and he did like the idea of having time with Julie. She was smart, like he was. She had beautiful blue eyes. She&#39;d given him so much in the way of comfort and assurance when he was still uneasy about things in Moon Lake and that shortly after moving in, he&#39;d found himself a Normal in a family of Weres. Even without a weremer&#39;s ability to see his or her &quot;one true love,&quot; Eric felt he would love Julie for all that she had done for him. Though he soon had a bit of an embarrassed blush when it was revealed that his exchange with Julie was overheard.<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be a good idea,&quot; Melissa commented as they all made their way to their respective vehicles, William and Martha with Joyce heading toward the SUV that the Anderson family had come to Moon Lake in, while Melissa headed toward the Stovall family&#39;s main car while Martin was on the other side of his wife and moving toward a smaller vehicle he and Melissa shared and used they knew they wouldn&#39;t have passengers or didn&#39;t have to buy much. There had been some talk between that when Julie was old enough to get her learner&#39;s permit before her driver&#39;s license that the other smaller car would be hers. &quot;You two can come back with me... and collect your things and head over to the Andersons for an academic afternoon. Just make sure you don&#39;t get too distracted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mom,&quot; Julie answered while Eric felt blood rush to his cheeks when his parents both seconded the notion of not being distracted.<br />
<br />
And with that, they split up. Melissa drove Julie and Eric back toward the Stovall house with Martin following in the other and smaller car. Melissa was fairly certain that both Eric and Julie had gotten most of their homework done, but while Eric and Julie had caught her and were aware of her concerns, she and Martin needed a private moment to talk on their own family planning. Bringing up the rear of the group was the Andersons, but it wasn&#39;t a race. In fact with the assurances directly from Martin that the worst of the crisis was over, he was content to drive at a more relaxed pace and get a look at the sights.<br />
<br />
They had been in Moon Lake long enough to be more familiar with the town&#39;s layout and with the various buildings. Many of which were quite interesting in the sense on how the older style architecture had survived over the years and was updated with more modern technology. Though the biggest thing on William&#39;s mind was just to enjoy the quiet drive and the scenery. He had noticed on the drive to the Local Diner that some people had picked up on the Skulk&#39;s pranks from the previous night and were cleaning up, though this also included putting away the Halloween decorations as well. That therefore meant that Christmas decorations would be appearing soon. But he couldn&#39;t focus on that for too long as they came up on a small set of apartments on Wood Street that was close to the parks at the very center of town.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my stop,&quot; Joyce said from the back seat and waited for William to pull into the parking lot. As she got out she scribbled a set of notes on a small sheet of scrap paper and then handed it to William, &quot;This is my phone number and my apartment number. Should you two ever be looking for a little extra fun... give me a call.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both William and Martha nodded to that. From time to time, they just might. For William, it was because Joyce had been good to Martha and made Martha VERY happy the night before, which is what his bond focused on. For Martha it was because Joyce was good and skilled and Martha had enjoyed the fun the three had had the previous night. There was also some points when the three of them reached a temporary pause in their threesome to manage some conversation. In that, much like the friendship with the Hales, Martha felt Joyce could be a good friend to have. Not just for indulging the part of her bisexual nature that was interested in other woman, but to share stories and simply talk with. In that, Joyce could be a real friend to add to the Twists, the Hales, and Kat Johnson. And as Joyce went inside they both waved to her.</p>
