<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sally lead the three of you away from where the Council had met toward a set of nearby rocks where the teen boy had gone to sit, as he had been asked to. You remained close to Selene and Elizabeth swam around to be on the other side of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;He won&#39;t be scared of us, will he?&quot; Elizabeth asked the three of you followed Sally forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;His fright and worry was more at the health of his girlfriend,&quot; Sally replied, &quot;and since she is doing better, we&#39;re ready to reunite them. And ultimately determine what to do with them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do with them?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My sisterhood is more than willing to welcome her into, but she seems unnerved by being near where she was attacked,&quot; Sally replied, &quot;The Council has agreed that since my mother put forward the effort to ensure your recognition as a head-sister, Selene, that if you had no problems with it we would send her and her boyfriend to you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d make them move?&quot; Selene asked, &quot;wouldn&#39;t her parents not like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the girl&#39;s parents actually live in the same town as you and sister Michelle/Michael do and had been in a long distance relationship with the boy, and he appears to be eighteen, or so he told us,&quot; Sally said slowly, &quot;So by human law, he&#39;s allowed to go and do what he wants. His parents may not like it, but if he decides to move, they can&#39;t stop him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And so you plan to send them to me?&quot; Selene asked. &quot;To me and Elizabeth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only you when we made the decision,&quot; Sally spoke, &quot;we made the decision before head-sister Florencia transformed your husband, based on what you told us, and thus before Elizabeth decided to switch sisterhoods.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause as you moved into slightly shallower water, but it was still more than deep enough to float in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you be willing, Selene?&quot; Sally asked, &quot;the girl is till traumatized by what happened while she is adapting to being siren... slowly... she can&#39;t be near the spot where she was attacked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If she is okay with it, I am okay with it,&quot; Selene answered.<br />
<br />
You watched Sally give a nod and then smile, as if feeling some relief at what had been said. The four of you then carefully made your way up to the boy where he was seated on the rock and was gazing off into the western horizon. As you arrived, he seemed to turn, as if he was expecting you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily?&quot; he asked, as if expecting one of you to be his girlfriend. He did look rather curious. Sally floated nearby to let your sisterhood interact with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, my name... my name is Michelle for now, this is my sister Elizabeth and my wife Selene,&quot; you introduced yourself and your sisterhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;For now?&quot; the teen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a man when a different head-sister transformed me,&quot; you explained, &quot;we&#39;re kind of in the process of working to get my male self restored.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re all very beautiful,&quot; he commented, &quot;all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Elizabeth smiled, &quot;We were told you liked mermaids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the beauty in some of the myths are very interesting... deceptively strong, beautiful... fast and strong swimmers... there is a great deal of beauty in that,&quot; the teen answered, &quot;a part of me has dreamed of being a merman from time to time... if only to be part of that beauty...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be impossible,&quot; Selene warned, &quot;there are no male sirens. Any man turned into a siren would become female, as you can see.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teen nodded, &quot;I was told that. I&#39;d also figured maybe to find away we can all live together... share in that beauty rather than seeing each other as monsters.&quot;<br />
<br />
You found yourself giving a soft smile. The teen did clearly love mermaids and their world. It wasn&#39;t a personal love, but it was a kind of love all the same. And in a way you sympathized with him. You loved Selene and figured that once you were human male again you&#39;d want the world to be such that everyone could live together.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a wonderful idea,&quot; you stated, &quot;perhaps when I&#39;m a man again, we&#39;ll have a common mission. Perhaps even be friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; the teen replied with a smile.<br />
<br />
You felt your heart beat strongly in your chest. The fact that the two of you had similar long term goals was good and you felt yourself eagerly wanting to be the boy&#39;s friend and in that you felt a strange sensation go through your body. It radiated from your hips and went through the rest of your body, though this tingle felt tight around your heart which beat stronger the more you felt it. It was as if it was strengthening you, and was taking the edge off of siren&#39;s hunger which you had begun to feel growing in you after almost two full days after feeding for the first time. As you felt it, your eyes widened. You were feeding, the boy&#39;s academic love of mermaids and their world and the desire to find a way for them all to live together, which ran with you hopes for the future with Selene and Elizabeth had formed a cycle of platonic love or love between friends. It wasn&#39;t the same as romantic love, the love between lovers, but it was love nonetheless, and you felt yourself growing stronger because of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you feel it?&quot; you asked to Selene, your face looking visibly relieved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you&#39;ve made a friend,&quot; Selene smiled back, &quot;and he is a good boy. You and he will be able to do much when your a man again. I just know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... thanks?&quot; the teen said slowly, somewhat lost on what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome young man,&quot; Selene said to him and pulled herself out of the water to sit on the rock beside him, &quot;the world could use more men like you and your girlfriend will be very fortunate to have you as her boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teen nodded, and as you watched you could almost feel the boys love for the girl, Emily, if her name was the name he addressed to the four of you. He then glanced over at your wife&#39;s womb.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you... you&#39;re pregnant,&quot; he stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes I am,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;we can get pregnant just like human women do. Despite having this tail where you have your legs... sirens are genetically compatible with humans... though our magic makes any and all children daughters...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And no male sirens,&quot; the teen commented.<br />
<br />
Selene didn&#39;t immediately answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you said Michelle is the father?&quot; the teen asked, &quot;or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, before a rival of mine transformed him from Michael to Michelle, Michael conceived my child... my daughter, and love Michael very much and he loved me very much as a man and still loves me as a siren,&quot; Selene spoke, &quot;but as a man, his love for me fed me and I didn&#39;t need to feed on anyone and that mutual link between us strengthened him and kept him looking young. You and your girlfriend will enjoy that link as well and will be happy together. She won&#39;t need to kill anyone to feed and you&#39;d be with the one you love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your councilor told me that,&quot; the teen nodded. &quot;So... do you lay eggs like fish do? Or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We give birth like any mammal,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;and if things go well... you&#39;ll be there when I give birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will?&quot; the teen asked.<br />
<br />
It was at this time that Sally came forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your girlfriend, Emily doesn&#39;t want to stay with my sisterhood, she doesn&#39;t want to be reminded of the attack on her, she would prefer to remain with her folks, who live in the same town as Selene, Elizabeth, and Michelle/Michael,&quot; Sally explained, &quot;the present plan is to let her stay with Selene&#39;s sisterhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would be more than welcome to come with her to be with us as well,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;we can set things up for what you and your girlfriend want to do with regard to college and we&#39;d keep you together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;d be a big happy family!&quot; Elizabeth said with a smile, &quot;three sisters, two brothers, and a baby! Wouldn&#39;t that be fun with all of us together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it would,&quot; the boy answered, &quot;but I&#39;d want that to be Emily&#39;s choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;re now ready to take you to her,&quot; Sally commented, &quot;We&#39;ll stay at the surface and Michelle/Michael and Elizabeth will be more than willing to help if you have trouble swimming.&quot;</p>
