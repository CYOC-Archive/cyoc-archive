<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">George went to college not that far from the family home. He always teased his younger brothers, beating them up and calling them names. Colin understood why now. George was making up for his own shortcomings.<br />
<br />
Colin ordered an Uber to head to George’s location on campus. He tucked the laptop into a backpack and headed to the curb to wait for his ride.  The car arrived and it didn’t take long to get to where the chronivac said George was.  It was a frat and they were having a party.  Out front there was a banner saying that it was rush week.  George was trying to rush, Colin thought, he was always desperate for approval.  Colin walked towards the door, a bouncer stood ready to turn him away. “Whoaaa” the bouncer said with a slur, “you cannnnt jest wolk in.”  Colin had an idea how to to respond. <br />
<br />
“My big brother is in there” he yelled over the noise, “and I have come to make sure you don’t let him in.”  The frat boy bouncer looked confused “what?” He asked.  “Trust me,” Colin said “you.”  The frat boy pushed Colin back, “No kids” he yelled allowing some girls to walk in.   Colin was angry before he remembered the chronivac.  He walked over away until he found a fairly secluded spot by some dumpsters.  It smelled but it would do.  Pulling up his stats, Colin changed his misc again. Now “everyone obeys my orders.” Colin smirked as he headed back to the front door of the frat.  The bouncer eyed him angrily ready to push him around before Colin said “stop” the boy stopped not moving a muscle. “You will let me in” Colin ordered smiling, “and you will take off your pant and underwear and keep them off all night”. Colin watched as the boy pulled down his jeans and his underwear revealing his average cock and balls.  People out front of the party gasped, shocked at the sight of the guys cock. “Get hard and stay hard, you can’t leave here until dawn tomorrow” Colin ordered as he walked into the party watching as the boys cock popped up growing slightly to about 7”.  Colin could hear people asking the boy what he was doing, the boy having no idea why he wasn’t able to put pants on or why his cock wouldn’t get soft. <br />
<br />
Colin headed for the basement watching the college kids party as he did.  There were girls all over the place in various states of undress.  Some looked passed out, their shirts off exposing their breast.  Colin’s cock twitched at the sight.  He found the basement stairs and headed down.  He could hear talking as he descended.  “You want to be part of delta omega phi” the voice said “prove your man enough. Serve your brother at this party, make it the best rush week ever!” There was cheering and hooting.  Colin made it to the bottom and saw 6 boys lined up dressed in maid costumes, his brother was one of them. Across from them were a line of guys and a large group of spectators. Clearly his brother was being hazed. Colin moved towards the back, he wondered how far his power would work. “Make them get naked” he said looking the back of the boy who had previously been speaking’s head.  “You know what” that boys stared “you’re all going to get naked.”  Colin smiled as the boys being hazed looked scared and confused and embarrassed. “Take off your costumes” Colin said looking at his brother.  George began to strip, not knowing why he was complying.  As the last of George’s costume came off Colin and everyone else could see his tiny shrunken cock.  George stood humiliated as everyone laughed at him.  “Ohh my god” the lead boy shouted, “my 5 year old brother is better hung than this shrimp dick.” “I would be embarrassed if my son had such a tiny little clit dick” said another between laughs.  “Take off your clothes” Colin ordered the others, watching as each stripped down one by one.  Out of the 6, three were average one was slightly larger than average maybe 6” soft and one was bigger closer to 7”. George was by far the smallest.  <br />
<br />
“Make George your bitch, make him pleasure you” Colin  ordered the lead boy watching as he moved towards George.  “Get on your knees, clit dick” the boy ordered pushing George to the floor.  George offered slight resistance before complying.  The boy opened his shorts, revealing a long fat cock. “Suck it” he ordered, George looked like he was about to resist before Colin whispered “obey” and George opened his mouth and took the cock in eagerly.  Colin watched, watch as his brothers mouth was fucked and left full of cum. Next he wants some action.</p>
