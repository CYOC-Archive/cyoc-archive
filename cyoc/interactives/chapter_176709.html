<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Lilith awoke, it was nearly pitch black and she at first couldn&#39;t feel much of anything, however after a quick feel of her body, she understood that she was not bound to half of Maria. The only addition was a tube comming out from her pussy, covering up the slit completely. Touching it, she quickly retracted her hand as it felt like she had just poked her clit, except the entire base of the tube and up for about 7-8 inches felt that way. She then tried to stand up, but found that she was stuck in her balled up fetal position by some kind of... bag? It felt warm to the touch, and now that she was thinking of it, she could feel some kind of fluid surrounding her. She came to the conclusion that the tube was some kind of umbilical cord. But the biggest question in her head was, where is Maria?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria was going through the exact same ordeal. Same umbilical cord like tube was attached to and covering up her pussy completely. She couldn&#39;t stand up, and had a difficult time moving anywhere as the soft, warm, bag like container she was in made it difficult to maneuver around. It was so dark too, and she felt like she was under water as well, but the fluid likely was not water. She attempted to call out to Lilith but found that she couldn&#39;t speak. It made semce, being submerged in a liquid does that to a person. So she just waited for something to happen. <br />
<br />
Feeling that now both girls had finally woken up, Dr. Vergunstien began the next phase of her plan and stood up to move to another room. At the same time, both girls suddenly felt like they were being lifted into the air. Then something to their side pressed into them, and finally some light was let in, turning their entire bag a fleshy redish-pink color. The best part though was now they could see what was pressing up against them. Lilith looked left, and maria looked right and found the other was looking back at them from within their own, clear membrane sphere. Both girls had noticed their cord exited their respective membrains and merged into a single tube which then exited the bag redish-pink bag through the ceiling. The girls tried to touch one another and started pushing against each other&#39;s membrane until finally their membranes tore, releasing them both into each others arms their fluid then flooded the bag, but only to about their armpits. <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; Asked Maria first, however still no sound was made. But, with a reasuring smile, Lilith answered her. She also didn&#39;t make a sound, but somehow Maria knew exactly what she said. &quot;I think I am ok. Or rather, I feel fine at least, how about you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Slightly uncomfortable with our strange situation, but physically I am also ok, just a bit wierded out about the tube is all.&quot; Answered Maria. Lilith nodded in agreement. Suddenly a bright light illuminated their dimly lit enclosure as what appeared to be bandages were in the process of being unwound from around them. Once their eyes readjusted, they saw that they were in a clear container, and something tall and flesh colored was standing above them. To either side was a different colored... something. It was then that what appeared to be a human hand pressed into the front of their container. Which it then began to claw at gently. Both girls shuddered at the pleasant feeling that cane from the hand. Somehow they could feel it scratching an itch that neither of them knew they had been feeling. The next thing that happened was that they were set down on top of a cool surface, which felt unpleasant at first and had made them jump, but then not quite as bad after a few seconds. Once the cool surface had warmed up, both girls relaxed and stopped trying to get off of it. <br />
<br />
It was then that the familar face of Dr. Vergunstien appeared upside down, as if she was on top of their soft, clear container. &quot;Hello ladies&quot; said Dr. Vergunstien, which the girls both heard and oddly felt being said. &quot;I can see from here that you both appear to be doing just fine. So tell me. What is your current opinion about being my new, human sized and shaped testicles? Do you love it? Hate it? Not that it really matters either way as none of this is reversible.&quot;<br />
<br />
After turning to face a mirror, Dr. Vergunstien continued. &quot;Look, I even managed to make my self a perfectly new and improved body to carry you both around in. As you can see, I am now about 10 feet tall. And in addition, I have given/made myself quite the inpressive cock if I do say so. But I am sure you both would have figured that one out later. By the way, your bodies are like, 80% testicle now. So no more needing to eat, sleep, breathe, etc. All you have to do now is create my sperm and feel good together. And if you are worried about testosterone production, don&#39;t. You are not producing any, as I have specifically left that part out. Instead, both of you now produce more thicker, healthier sperm quality, as well as an obsurd quantity of them. Way more than any normal male could, even if he had balls the same size as you two.&quot;</p>
