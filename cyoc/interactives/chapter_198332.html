<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cole wanted to scream.  School was particularly soul crushing today for some reason.  It was a gloomy day outside, and it felt like her teachers were droning on and on.  Time had slowed to a crawl.<br />
<br />
The ancient furnace had made the air warm, but dry, and she felt like it was getting harder to breathe.  Many of her classmates were nodding off, but she didn&#39;t have that luxury- a side effect of her constant state of arousal was that she couldn&#39;t sleep until she found some relief for the tension.<br />
<br />
Instead, she was sucking furiously on a pacifier, afraid that someone might actually hear the noise and wonder where it was coming from.  Being horny and upset, she found, was a bad combination.<br />
<br />
Despite Winrya&#39;s assurances, she still felt pretty bad about how things had turned out.  And then, this morning, she&#39;d seen Cindy come out of Lee&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Being jealous of Lee was stupid and pointless.  Everyone loved her.  Of course Cindy was going to have sex with her.  But in the back of her mind, she couldn&#39;t get over feeling betrayed.  Wasn&#39;t the whole point of looking into Luke&#39;s dreams in the first place, or offering him a chance to change his gender, for her benefit?<br />
<br />
She had wanted Luke/Cindy to be hers.  But the more she interacted with Cindy, the more she felt like an outsider...<br />
<br />
The lights flickered, and an oppressive aura began to emanate from Cole, like she was surrounded by her own personal storm cloud.  Those near her began feeling depression and anger, and soon, even the teacher snapped.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know why I fucking bother!  I&#39;m not allowed to -teach- you anything to begin with, and none of you are even paying attention!  Teach yourselves, I quit!”  The woman stormed out of the room.<br />
<br />
The classroom immediately descended into chaos, as petty grudges and hatreds exploded.  Nancy Wilkins got up and slapped Brandy Phillips, accusing her of stealing her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
A couple of bullies started picking on a nerdy student in the back.<br />
<br />
Henry Jackson announced he was breaking up with his girlfriend, Rachel, because she was a &#39;cheating whore&#39;, and Rachel suddenly began weeping uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
Cole jumped to her feet.  “God!  Will you all shut up!?!”  <br />
<br />
Everyone flinched, afraid of Cole and not understanding why.  Cole ran out of the room.   She needed air!<br />
<br />
As she rounded the corner, she practically collided with Lee.  “Get out of my way!” she growled, pushing past the demoness.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lee was momentarily surprised.  She&#39;d felt a surge of demonic energies and had excused herself from her class to investigate, but having Cole, of all people, treat her like that was beyond the pale!  She -owned- that girl!<br />
<br />
No, anger wasn&#39;t the right response.  She -was- angry, and that girl needed to be punished...but something was very wrong here.  She followed the girl, hiding her presence, and extending her senses.  She had no doubt whoever had tampered with Trent was nearby, and now they were meddling with Cole!<br />
<br />
The things she was going to do to whoever or whatever it was when she got her hands on them- their suffering would be legendary!<br />
<br />
<br />
Lee caught up to Cole outside.  The girl was getting drenched by cold rain, and was punching and kicking an innocent tree that had gotten in her path.  “I hate you!  I hate you!  I wish you&#39;d never come into my life!”<br />
<br />
&#39;Well she has to be talking about me&#39;, the demon sighed.  She came up from behind and pulled Cole into  a bear hug, giving the girl no leverage to fight her.<br />
<br />
She certainly tried, however, kicking and swearing, and spewing vitriol until she ran out of energy and went limp, crying.<br />
<br />
Lee alerted Winrya to be on the lookout for a demon at the middle school.  She had to get Cole out of here, but if she left herself, Cindy would be left unprotected.<br />
<br />
There was only one person nearby she could ask for help.  “Raphael, Archangel of Love, aid me in my time of need!”<br />
<br />
That cost her a bit, and the words seemed to burn her tongue.<br />
<br />
But then there was a bright light, and Raphael was there, floating in the air, glowing with radiant light.  Her wings and brilliant halo were fully on display.  She was neither joyous nor serene at the moment, however.  She was -pissed-!<br />
<br />
“What foul wickedness has occurred here, Dantalyon?”  Raphael&#39;s anger wasn&#39;t directed at her, thankfully (this would be a really bad time to have a brawl with one of the “Famous Four”).<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know, but I need to get Cole out of here, and I don&#39;t dare leave Cindy unguarded.”  Lee said.<br />
<br />
The tiniest ghost of a smile.  “So you asked me for help?  Go then, I&#39;ll take care of this, Sister.”<br />
<br />
Lee nodded, and teleported back to her house.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raphael hovered over the school.  Rage and hatred was spreading throughout the school- Cole had been used as the focal point, but the effect was growing.  She could sense Cindy was currently fighting in the gym.  Though only a mortal, the girl&#39;s warrior spirit was unusually strong.<br />
<br />
“Take heart, shieldmaiden, and stand tall!  You do not fight alone!” Raphael sent a burst of energy towards the girl, then prepared to unleash her special power.<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t come across her title, Archangel of Love, by chance.  Her aura flared so brightly it became visible (though most people simply thought it was the sun piercing the clouds).<br />
<br />
“IN THE NAME OF THE ONE WHO IS- ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE!”  Her voice was like the roll of thunder.  Her power spread over the school, touching the hearts of everyone within, dispelling the black fog of resentment with the one thing that it cannot abide.  Love.<br />
<br />
Passions flared as lovers embraced.  Old wounds were forgotten.  Friends reconciled.  Enemies declared a truce.  Unrequited emotions came to the surface.  There would be fallout for this, of course, but Raphael was certain she could defend herself from any allegations made by her superiors.<br />
<br />
<br />
A fight had broken out among two of the cheerleaders during P.E., and somehow it had turned into an all-out brawl.  Cindy was doing her best to break it up, and protect the weaker girls.  At first, she&#39;d doubted her ability to take on the bigger girls, but then she felt a great joy fill her heart.<br />
<br />
She did enjoy this!  The thrill of battle, the adrenaline pumping through her veins, all of her senses accelerated.  It felt as good to her as what Lee had done to her last night (even if she was still sore and it hurt a little to walk).  She was a blur, moving faster than she ever had before.<br />
<br />
But even as she fought (a few boys had strayed over to this side of the gym as well), she was careful not to really hurt anyone that much.  Everyone would know they&#39;d been in a fight for a few days, however.<br />
<br />
Then something happened, and the fight seemed to drain out of everyone.  At first, everyone stared blankly, then the two cheerleaders who had started the brawl started crying and embraced.<br />
<br />
...and then started making out.  <br />
<br />
Cindy felt very confused and aroused, and then, like a chain reaction, several other girls followed suit.<br />
<br />
Her teacher, Ms. Langley (who was also the girl&#39;s volleyball coach), walked up to the team captain, Laura Taylor, and kissed her in front of everyone (to scattered applause, no less!).<br />
<br />
What the hell was going on?!<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when she felt a tap on her shoulder, and she turned to see Raphael, the girl Lee had said was a relative.<br />
<br />
“Hi there, Cindy, right?  You want to get out of here?”<br />
<br />
Cindy felt like she had double vision.  She saw the 15 year old cute brunette...and also, a tall, elegantly beautiful woman with white wings, and a halo that shone like a star.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d never seen anyone so beautiful in all her life, even Lee was rivaled by this vision of loveliness.  Without realizing what she was doing, Cindy pulled the girl close and kissed her (even if she had to stand on tiptoe to do so!).<br />
<br />
<br />
Raphael hadn&#39;t expected -that- at all!  She didn&#39;t even know this girl really, but there was certainly a powerful attraction.  And the young girl&#39;s lips were soft and warm...and very inviting.<br />
<br />
&#39;Woah girl!  Bad time, bad place.  Get her out of here first!&#39;  Her brain alerted her, and she teleported her and the girl away.  <br />
<br />
No one noticed, as everyone else was dealing with their own unleashed desires...<br />
<br />
<br />
The defenses on Lee&#39;s home prevented Raphael from just popping in, so she went to the one place she knew was safe on Earth, bringing her and Cindy to her house.<br />
<br />
She appeared with the amorous teen in her full angelic form, surprising Amielle and Toni, who had been making out on the couch, while Damia was napping in her crib.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” Toni exclaimed, as she burst into flames.  Even though she was far less evil than most Succubi, Toni had still not built up a lot of resistance to holy power.<br />
<br />
Amielle shielded her lover with her body as best she could, as Raphael remembered to hide her halo.<br />
<br />
Damia snored, unaffected.<br />
<br />
“Raphael, you&#39;re hurting her!”  Ami yelled.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to!”  Raphael managed to say, as Cindy began to nuzzle her breasts.<br />
<br />
Ooh.  That felt nice.  &#39;Focus, love freak!&#39;, he inner voice snapped, sounding an awful lot like Gemory.<br />
<br />
“Sleep!”  She commanded, and Cindy obliging lost consciousness.  Raphael held the small girl in a bridal carry.  “Is she going to be ok, Ami?”<br />
<br />
Toni weakly raised her fist, giving a thumbs up.  “Yeah, just a little singed.  I&#39;m going to need to feed though.”<br />
<br />
Ami bared her breast and sat Toni in her lap.  “Here, darling.”  <br />
<br />
Toni latched onto her and began to suckle, greedily devouring the angel&#39;s milk.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that&#39;s a neat trick, Ami.”  Raphael sat down in a loveseat, settling Cindy in her lap.  Sleeping, the girl looked much younger and she had a smile on her face.  Idly, Raphael healed some of the girl&#39;s bruises and her bloody knuckles.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well, we figured we should take turns feeding Damia, and Gemory was able to teach me how to shapechange better.  I&#39;m not terribly good at it, but I can do this much.”<br />
<br />
“Give it time, honey.  Practice makes perfect.”  While all angels could change their shape, adopting whatever forms they needed to, typically to do this, you had to revert to your angelic form, then transubstantiate into a new form- basically building a new body on the fly.  Some older Angels could transform without doing this- Raphael herself being one, but it took a lot of time and patience for most.<br />
<br />
“So what happened?”  Amielle asked.<br />
<br />
Raphael gave her a rundown on how Dantalyon had summoned her, and what happened after.<br />
<br />
Toni let go of Ami&#39;s nipple, a trickle of white milk flowing from her lips.  “Oh man, that hit the spot, love.”<br />
<br />
“You need more.”  Ami ordered.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but I just wanted to say, that sounds like a Aeshma.  A Rage Demon.”<br />
<br />
Raphael frowned.  “It does, doesn&#39;t it?”  Aeshma were strong fighters, not known for subtlety, but this one had apparently taken pains not to confront Dantalyon directly.  Likely knowing she would obliterate the foul creature with only a fraction of her power.  Which gave her pause.<br />
<br />
Angels had limits on how much of their power they can use on Earth.  She had always assumed Lucifer had given the Fallen similar restraints, but she realized she had no idea exactly how much power Gemory or Dantalyon could bring to bear if they were truly annoyed.<br />
<br />
Given how grouchy Gemory could be sometimes, that was something she&#39;d have to look into.  “I really need an assistant.”<br />
<br />
Ami forced Toni to take more milk.  “I&#39;d offer, but...new Dad and all.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s a shame, Diane tells me you were very good at your job.”  <br />
<br />
Amielle blushed.  “Uh, most of what I did was eat her pussy out all day while she was working.  And um, other stuff at her place.”<br />
<br />
“She misses you, by the way.  I think she wants to apologize for not treating you better.”  Raphael added.<br />
<br />
“Aw.  I&#39;ll see if I can find time to visit her then.  It&#39;s a shame, I think we could have had something, but I have no regrets.  Toni and the baby make me very happy.”  Amielle smiled.<br />
<br />
“Well she has a new girlfriend now, and she&#39;s trying very hard to treat her better.  She even wants to try and be submissive.”<br />
<br />
“Diane?  A sub?  What kind of girl is she with?”  Ami&#39;s eyes widened.<br />
<br />
“Her name is Love, of all things.  She&#39;s actually very sweet, so I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s going to work out.”<br />
<br />
“Love?  Aw.  That&#39;s a pretty name.  I wish them the best!”  The angel chirped.<br />
<br />
With effort, Raphael resumed her normal use-form.  She&#39;d used a lot of energy herself, and was dangerously close to her limit.  She&#39;d have to take it easy, or be forced to return to Heaven, since she wasn&#39;t allowed to draw on her reserves on Earth.<br />
<br />
“Somehow, Cindy here saw my real form.  That and the side effects of what I did to counter the Aeshma made her fall for me.”<br />
<br />
“Direct hit from the Love Bomb!”  Ami giggled.<br />
<br />
“Oh dear God, tell me that&#39;s not what people call it?!”  Raphael groaned.<br />
<br />
“Hehe, yes, sorry!”  <br />
<br />
Raphael grumbled.  “So that&#39;s going to be a problem, Dantalyon has marked this one as her property.  She might be furious.”<br />
<br />
Toni pushed away from her beloved.  “Whew, ok, if I drink anymore, I might explode.  Thanks dear.”<br />
<br />
“Oh it&#39;s my pleasure.  Go get me Damia while I have my boobs out.  It&#39;s time to feed her anyways.” <br />
<br />
“Sure thing!  Man those big tits look good on you, though!”  Toni grinned.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, you&#39;re such a boy!”  Amielle threw a pillow at the Succubus.  It was halfhearted though, and she immediately started giggling.<br />
<br />
“We need to build up Toni&#39;s resistance to holy power more.  I see she can handle your milk just fine.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it&#39;s weird, my powers don&#39;t faze her in the slightest, but I guess you&#39;re just too much woman for her, Raphael.”  Amielle sighed.<br />
<br />
Toni came back with Damia, who had grown to be the equivalent of a seven month old.  “Hmph.  I can handle any woman, thank you very much.”<br />
<br />
“Oof, somebody is getting to be a heavy baby!”  Amielle took her child in her arms and started nursing her.  “Might have to have Dani slow down her aging again.”<br />
<br />
“Speak for yourself, I&#39;ll be glad when she&#39;s potty trained.”  Toni said, sitting on the couch next to Ami.<br />
<br />
“She should be crawling by now.”  Raphael said, having had a lot of experience with young children.<br />
<br />
“Oh she can, if we don&#39;t keep an eye on her.  You have the place pretty kid proof though, and she&#39;s a lot tougher than a human child, so we&#39;re not too worried.”  Toni said.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry, who isn&#39;t worried?  You fret about her constantly.”  Ami pointed out.<br />
<br />
Toni blushed.  “Uh...yeah, it turns out I have some strong maternal instincts.  No idea why.”<br />
<br />
“I think it&#39;s wonderful.  It just goes to show anyone can be a good mother.”  Raphael favored the Succubus with a radiant smile.<br />
<br />
Toni flinched a little, but returned the smile.  “Hey, turn down the wattage there, please?”<br />
<br />
“Ooh, sorry.  It&#39;s a habit to try and spread good feelings around.”  Raphael apologized.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, I think it&#39;s great, but, you know, demon.”  Toni shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I need to have my limiters adjusted.  I&#39;m stronger than the average Archangel by a good bit, it&#39;s possible I&#39;ve gotten more powerful without realizing it.”  Raphael mused.<br />
<br />
“Hey, why is that, anyways?  Shouldn&#39;t all Angels in a given class be of equal strength?”  Ami asked.<br />
<br />
To her credit, Toni didn&#39;t even react to the G-word being said in her presence.  Perhaps she was getting tougher, after all!<br />
<br />
“Generally, yes, though there are exceptions- Lucifer, Sandalphon, or Metatron, for example.  Each Angel has a specialty, something that makes them stand out from the others, and when that comes into play, they are more powerful.  But God&#39;s Plan apparently requires some of us to stand out, even if we don&#39;t know why.<br />
<br />
Michael&#39;s truly immense physical strength, for example.  No one gave it much thought, since she was made for physical tasks.  Until she got into a fight with Lucifer and beat the stuffing out of him.  Likewise, I didn&#39;t discover my talent until later, when I was commanded to help round up the Nephilim at Mount Harmon.  But my halo has always been super bright- I can draw a lot more power from the Throne of Heaven than other Archangels.  No idea why, but I have to assume it&#39;s going to come up one of these days.”<br />
<br />
“What kinds of powers do Uriel and Gabriel have?”  Toni asked.<br />
<br />
“Uriel is the Angel of Repentance.  She has great Smiting power, and can pronounce judgment on sinners.  While Gabriel has a special power over souls and the dead- she can actually bring the dead back to life.  And she plays a mean trumpet!”  Raphael explained.<br />
<br />
“Wait, he can do what?  I thought only God could do that!”  Ami exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Well, Gabe can.  Usually she just talks to the Dead she encounters, and tries to guide them to Heaven or offer them comfort.  But she is also the guardian of the Tree of Souls, and the only one allowed to touch it.  She doesn&#39;t do the resurrection thing much, says it makes her feel pretentious, and usually leaves that to Yahosua.”<br />
<br />
Toni got an odd look on her face.  “That name...it makes me feel funny.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, that&#39;s the actual name of Jesus.”  Raphael said.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit, really?  I didn&#39;t know that.  Huh.  You know, it&#39;s weird, &#39;Jesus&#39; doesn&#39;t affect me the same way the G-word used to.”  Toni mused.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s because he is part mortal, and, well, his name is said a lot.  Now why &#39;God&#39;, which is a very generic term, has that kind of power, is unclear.  I&#39;d test this by using one of God&#39;s other names, but I don&#39;t want you to explode.”  <br />
<br />
“Thanks, I don&#39;t want to explode either!”  Toni said, grinning.  “Except during sex.”  She amended.<br />
<br />
“Well, I&#39;m sorry to barge in on you like this and run, but I really need to get Cindy here back home.  And deal with Dantalyon.”  Raphael rose, still carrying the girl.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s ok, we should know better than just start getting busy in the living room.”  Toni said.<br />
<br />
“We should, but we don&#39;t.”  Ami grinned.<br />
<br />
“Oh don&#39;t worry, Mi casa es Su casa, si?  You two have fun now!”  Raphael walked over and patted Damia on her pate gently.  The baby gurgled and cooed happily.<br />
<br />
“Man, she makes that look super easy.  When she starts crying, sometimes I don&#39;t know what to do.”  Toni grouched.<br />
<br />
Ami giggled.  “What I did yesterday seemed to work.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you!  I&#39;m still mad about that!”  Toni frowned.  “She gave Damia my tail to use as a pacifier!”<br />
<br />
“Oh my!  That had to be embarrassing!”  Raphael managed to not laugh.  But it was hard.  Succubus tails were -very- sensitive, and it was well known that merely chewing on the tip of her tail would cause Toni to quickly have an orgasm.<br />
<br />
“Yes!  It was!  She&#39;s my baby!”  Toni glared at Ami.  “I mean, can we at least wait until she&#39;s older?”<br />
<br />
Raphael decided it was time to depart.  Toni contemplating when it would be proper for her to engage in incestuous activity with her own daughter was a bit much.<br />
<br />
<br />
She still couldn&#39;t just appear in Lee&#39;s home, and carrying an unconscious Cindy around would attract attention, so she instead looked into Cindy&#39;s mind and found “home”.  They appeared on a bed in a room that, if Raphael didn&#39;t know better, she would assume was a boy&#39;s.<br />
<br />
She lay Cindy down, and let her awaken.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cindy woke up from the strangest dream.  She&#39;d been in an epic fight, and then the most beautiful girl she&#39;d ever seen had been there, and they&#39;d immediately started kissing.  Even now, she felt keenly aroused, and knew she&#39;d have to do something about that.  She sat up in bed, only to see the woman perched on her bed.<br />
<br />
Again, she had a strange double vision- she saw the woman, but she also saw a younger girl...Raphael, that&#39;s right, Lee&#39;s relative.  “Uh oh...that wasn&#39;t a dream, was it?”<br />
<br />
Raphael looked to the girl.  “You can still -see- me, can&#39;t you?”<br />
<br />
Cindy nodded.  “Is that what you really look like?”  Raphael&#39;s true form was around 6&#39; tall, and a perfect example of feminine beauty- slender in all the right places, but also with the appropriate padding.  Her body was, simply put, a work of art, and the delicate features of her face would make Helen of Troy jealous.  Her irises were colored like a rainbow, and she she had glorious tresses of white-gold hair.  Even though they weren&#39;t visible, Cindy knew her pristine white wings were there, and there was a glowing mote of light hovering above the crown of her head- if Cindy squinted, she could make out the shadow of a halo.  Her skin was like white-pink marble, with faint silvery veins.  She couldn&#39;t quite guess how old she looked, so she settled on 20.<br />
<br />
“It is.  Most people find it a little intimidating, so my use-form is more &#39;girl next door&#39;.  I don&#39;t mean to brag, but I&#39;m probably in the top 20 of the most beautiful people in existence.”  Raphael said.<br />
<br />
“I love you.”  Cindy said, then blushed.  “I mean, I&#39;m sorry!  I shouldn&#39;t say that!”<br />
<br />
“You really do, don&#39;t you?”  Raphael was surprised.  This wasn&#39;t attraction or even a crush.  Somehow, the spark of very real love had ignited in the girl&#39;s soul.  “I mean, love at first sight isn&#39;t impossible, but it is unusual.”  She shifted closer to the girl.<br />
<br />
Cindy reached out to touch Raphael, ever so gently, as if afraid the Angel would burn her (given the fact she&#39;d sold her soul to a demon, it very well could, to be honest).  She started to cry.  <br />
<br />
“Why didn&#39;t I meet you before!  It&#39;s not fair!”  <br />
<br />
Raphael shed her use-form entirely (it wasn&#39;t doing her much good, and she gathered the small girl into her arms).  “Shh.  Don&#39;t cry.  Everything happens for a reason, you know.”  She gently touched the girl on the nose.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re an Angel.  A real Angel.  How can I love an Angel?!”  <br />
<br />
“Well, I&#39;m not just any Angel.  They call me the Angel of Love.”  Raphael smiled gently.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re laughing at me.”  Cindy&#39;s emotions were out of control and she knew it.  “Ugh, what&#39;s wrong with me?”<br />
<br />
Raphael decided to look closer.  “Oh, I see!  You&#39;re not used to being a girl, are you?”<br />
<br />
Cindy nodded.  “I used to be a boy.  I always wanted to be...a girl.  Then Lee...made it real.”<br />
<br />
“Well that&#39;s not something Heaven can do, I have to admit.  At least, not in this life.  You poor thing, you must have been so confused.”  She brushed the girl&#39;s blonde hair.  It was very soft.<br />
<br />
“Y..yeah.  Still...if I hadn&#39;t...I could have met you...and not be...”<br />
<br />
“What?  Evil?  All humans are, you know.  There&#39;s a seed of evil in everyone.  But you&#39;ve lived a good life.  You protect others, I saw that.”<br />
<br />
“I like to fight.”  Cindy said.  “Like, too much.  It makes me feel...good.”<br />
<br />
“I can see that.  You&#39;re a real warrior.  Tell me, have you ever lost yourself?  Just gone totally berserk, no restraint?”<br />
<br />
Cindy shook her head.  “No!  I would never.  But it still feels good to hurt people.”<br />
<br />
“And yet, you didn&#39;t hurt any of your classmates just now.  Let me tell you a secret, Cindy.  Angels are only allowed to Smite the wicked.  But how do you suppose it feels, to channel the power of holy wrath through your body?”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know?”<br />
<br />
Raphael smiled.  “Like the best sex ever.  Some Angels have to be careful not to get addicted to the feeling.”<br />
<br />
“Wow.  Really?  I...that&#39;s how I felt in the gym.”  Cindy admitted.<br />
<br />
“Would you like to have sex with me, Cindy?”  Raphael could tell the girl needed release, and it wasn&#39;t like Dantalyon could get more pissed at her, right?<br />
<br />
“I...no, I couldn&#39;t...you&#39;re...perfect.”<br />
<br />
“And this is why I change my form.  People always want to put me on a pedestal.  Cindy, can I do something?  So you can stop looking at the real me?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry, is it wrong?”<br />
<br />
“No...not wrong.”  Raphael assured her.  “It&#39;s a very special gift that allows you to, but I&#39;d rather...you see how I want to be seen.”<br />
<br />
“Ok.”  <br />
<br />
Raphael produced a veil of purest white linen and wrapped it over Cindy&#39;s eyes.  It became invisible, serving only to blind the girl&#39;s True Sight.  Raphael wasn&#39;t kidding, that was a rare and special talent- usually only young children and animals could possess it.  For someone nearly and adult, it was nothing short of miraculous.<br />
<br />
She wondered if Lee knew.  “Tell me, what does Lee look like to you?”<br />
<br />
Cindy frowned.  “Pretty much the same, though...taller.”<br />
<br />
That sounded about right.  Dantalyon preferred a completely androgynous form, but &#39;Lee&#39; greatly resembled that form, just younger and smaller.  “I see.  Well, the veil I gave you will block you from seeing my true form.  It might not block others, so be prepared for some surprises if you encounter a demon, angel, or other strange being.”<br />
<br />
Raphael then changed into her use-form, becoming the cute 15 year old brunette once more.  “There, is this better?”<br />
<br />
Cindy smiled a little.  “You&#39;re really cute.  The way you talked, I thought you wanted to look plain.”<br />
<br />
“Well...a girl has a right to be a little vain.”  She brushed her hair over her shoulder.  “Am I too young for you?  I can change.”<br />
<br />
“No.  You&#39;re...amazing.  Your eyes are still the same though.”<br />
<br />
Raphael frowned.  “They shouldn&#39;t be.  This form has olive-colored eyes.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, they&#39;re like little rainbows to me.”  Cindy admitted.<br />
<br />
“Well.  I guess it just means you&#39;re sight is stronger than my power to block it.”  She started to undress.  “But as long as you think they&#39;re pretty...”<br />
<br />
Cindy started taking her own clothes off.  “I think you&#39;re the most beautiful girl in the world.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Cindy proved to be inexperienced as a lover, but a quick learner.  And such stamina!  Raphael hadn&#39;t enjoyed herself this much in quite awhile!  Of course, she wouldn&#39;t be the Angel of Love if she didn&#39;t give as good as she got.  She healed the girl a little bit (Dantalyon had taken her virginity recently), though she was careful not to replace her hymen.  At least not unless she asked!<br />
<br />
Finally, exhausted, Cindy fell back onto the bed, and Raphael cuddled with her.  In addition to being the best at hugs, Raphael prided herself on being the best at cuddling.  She kissed Cindy softly.<br />
<br />
“Feel better, baby?”  <br />
<br />
Cindy nodded.  “I need...a drink.”<br />
<br />
Raphael conjured a bottle of water, and helped Cindy drink it without spilling it.  “There you go, honey.  You didn&#39;t have lunch either.  You must be starving.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll be ok.”  Cindy smiled.  “Can I ask a stupid question?”<br />
<br />
“Sure baby, what is it?”  Raphael smiled.<br />
<br />
“Is it possible...I mean...could you...”  Cindy paused.  “Would you want to be my girlfriend?”<br />
<br />
Raphael blinked.  “My.  Are you usually this forward?”<br />
<br />
“No.  And I know I shouldn&#39;t ask, but...if I didn&#39;t, I&#39;d kick myself later.”<br />
<br />
Raphael lay her head on the other girl&#39;s chest, hearing her heartbeat.  “I&#39;d like that, Cindy.  But I&#39;m a working girl, I can&#39;t always be here for you.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you won&#39;t get in trouble?  I mean, I&#39;m not a demon yet, but...”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t care.  What are they going to do?  Kick me out of Heaven?  They&#39;d be lost without me.”  Raphael allowed herself to feel a smidgen of Pride.  Sure, Yahosua was probably better than she was, but most Angels were far too intimidating by The Son to talk to him.  She did a lot more to keep Heaven going than most realized.<br />
<br />
“I can never go to Heaven.”  Cindy said.<br />
<br />
“I know, baby.  And I wouldn&#39;t be welcome in Hell, either.  But...you&#39;re so warm.  Your love...it&#39;s getting stronger, and it makes me feel wonderful.”<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t love me though.”  Cindy sounded sad.<br />
<br />
“Not yet.”  She shifted to look the girl in the eyes.  “But I&#39;m finding a lot of things to love.  Do you think you could survive another orgasm before we find you some food?”<br />
<br />
Cindy nodded enthusiastically, and Raphael grinned, deciding to show her what one could do with an Angel&#39;s feather...</p>
