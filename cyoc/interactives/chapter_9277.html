<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The last of Billy's personality changes kicked in just about the time he finished with Richard's modifications.  <br />
<br />
Billy checked over the stats before concentrating on some further modifications for himself.  <br />
<br />
Richard was 6'1&quot;; Billy modified him to 6'6&quot;.  Richard was work-hardened muscled; Billy modified him to weight lifter.  Billy was never fond of the 'body builder' look; he preferred muscle like the 'strong men' contestants had.  Richard had a somewhat thin 10&quot; cock; Billy modified it to 11&quot; with THICK with heavy, large low hanging balls.  He further modified Richard's prostate gland to 'Excessively Over Productive' knowing that Richard would love to 'piss come' into Billy's mouth or ass.  Richard was already hairy enough.  On the Chronivac scale he'd used earlier to bump his own fur level to a 21, Richard was about a 24.  He was a healthily furred Bear.  <br />
<br />
Next, he changed Richard's personality.  Richard was a kind, gentle and loving partner and Billy appreciated that, but in the bedroom he was a little too 'bottom' for Billy.  Billy needed a 'Poppa Bear'.  He modified Richard's personality to 'Considerate Top Bear' and his kink level to 'Adventurous' knowing that this would preserve Richard's kind and loving nature, but make him more aggressive and willing to try some light kink in bed.<br />
<br />
Finally, Billy modified Richard's favored mode of dress to denim and leather, selected the option for 'Clothes Modified to Other Changes' so Richard wouldn't need to buy more clothes and 'Memory Modified to Suit Changes' so that he wouldn't remember being changed.  His work on Richard was done!  <br />
<br />
Now all that remained was for Richard to walk into the room and a private moment or three.  Billy saved the modifications and then returned to his own specs.<br />
<br />
Billy was well muscled, but he knew Richard would like him to gain just a bit more bulk.  Billy increased his bulk to 'Professional Wrestler'; not the pretty-boy type muscle but thick fireplug beef, somewhat like the Rick and Scott Stiener wrestling team had way back when.  <br />
<br />
The personality changes he’d already experienced made Billy desire a little more fat on his well-muscled frame.  He also knew that Richard loved the little beer belly he already had.  Billy increased his fat weight by 20 pounds.  Nothing that would really hurt his health, but it would give him a nice bit of padding and it would drive Richard wild to plough his ass now.  He could rub Billy's belly as he fucked him and feel all that muscle under the soft fat layer.  <br />
<br />
Finally, Billy changed his cock size.  He didn't want to be as big as his 'Daddy' would be, but he wanted a little more than his recently modified 8 inches.  Billy settled on 9 1/2&quot; and as thick as Richard's new size to be.  Billy modified his ball size to 'Bull Balls' and his prostate to 'Over Productive'.  Finally, Billy increased his IQ, an option he wished he'd thought of earlier.  Billy was no slouch at an IQ of 135, but increasing it to 160 would definitely have some benefits.  Billy modified his personality to 'Willing Bottom Cub'.  He finally selected 'Clothes Modified to Other Changes', so that he wouldn't be naked when he finally left the room, and selected the 'Flannel and denim Cub' as favored dress mode.<br />
<br />
With those modifications made, Billy undressed and hit the button and the process of transformation began.  This time, because they were minor modifications, it wasn't nearly as painful and removing his clothing prior to transformation was something he hadn't thought of before.  <br />
<br />
The modifications to his brain and personality were having a strange effect on Billy.  It was an almost psychedelic experience but that lasted a very brief three minutes.  He felt his body expanding and there was some pain.  The process only took 10 minutes, but as before, it made Billy tired.  He lay naked on the queen sized guest bed and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Thirty minutes later, there was a knock at the door.  Steve said Richard had just pulled into the driveway and the pizza and salads had just arrived.<br />
<br />
Richard opened the bedroom door and Billy was waiting.  He hit the button on the Chronivac with the options he'd programmed for Richard.  Richard shut the door and instantly fell to his knees, doubled over in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done to me!&quot; Richard moaned in his deep voice.  The usual soft rumble of Richard's voice stolen by pain.  He fell, dropping his cigar on the floor.  <br />
<br />
Billy knelt and bent over his lover, picked up the cigar and stroked his lover's furry neck and petted his beard lovingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK, Honey, it will be over soon and you'll like it, I promise.&quot;  Billy said.<br />
<br />
Billy began stroking his cock as he watched his big furry Bear undergo the amazing transformation.  Watching his lover transform was very erotic for Billy.<br />
<br />
There was a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything alright in there guys?&quot;  Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK Bro!&quot;  Billy said in his deep baritone.  &quot;Richard is just saying hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard moaned in a way that sounded like pleasure and Billy saw Richard rub his crotch through his jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK... I'll just start on the pizza, help yourselves when you’re... Er... Done.&quot;  Steve said and Billy could clearly hear the embarrassment in his voice.<br />
<br />
Richard, through his spasms, looked up into Billy's face and said...</p>
