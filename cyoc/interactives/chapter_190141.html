<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Coming down to breakfast also brought a series of delicious smells, including eggs, sausage, and even something that smelled like pepper. In some ways it all smelled good and as you and Luna entered you found Kellie standing over the stove and moving a metal pan about, and you could hear something crackling in it. Roxie was by another section of the counter and was pouring herself a cup of coffee. You figured the coffee maker that Vaxer family had had to be better than the one your dad had, as you knew that his would still be brewing given the time it took for you and Luna to get dressed. You were wearing a pair of sports shorts that you&#39;d had as Nick, and found that your overall growth in height in your present form, combined with the increase in your hips and butt that the shorts actually were slightly shorter than you expected, coming down to just above your knee. Your shirt, though, was one of the ones Luna and you picked out yesterday. Luna was wearing a pair of green cargo shorts with a gold tee shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breakfast smells good, mom,&quot; Luna spoke as she entered into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could smell it coming down the stairs,&quot; you added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still amazed at all the new abilities?&quot; Kellie asked as she glanced over her shoulder while a sort of clicking noise drew your attention to a toaster near where Roxie was.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; you managed, &quot;I mean... weren&#39;t you amazed by your new senses after you first transformed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way, I suppose I was,&quot; Kellie smiled, &quot;though it also raised the importance of keeping things clean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And changing Luna&#39;s diapers miserable when she was an infant,&quot; Roxie added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daaaaaaaaaaad!&quot; Luna protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that&#39;s a fact of life, and one of the points where you wish you WON&#39;T have enhanced senses,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;and you and Nicki will have to deal with that when your daughter is born.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Luna both accepted that for a moment. A few images of you and Luna standing together holding a baby wrapped in a pink blanket went through your mind, and that thought seemed to make you smile. Diaper changes would be rough, and a part of you was going to be nervous over whether or not you&#39;d be a good parent, but at the same time, a part of you was also eager to greet yours and Luna&#39;s daughter when she was born. Some of that was probably just MILF-wolf instincts that were always there though.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s for breakfast, mom?&quot; Luna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Omelets,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;I&#39;ve been working in the mix of eggs, cheese, sausage, and pepper while Roxie handles the toast and coffee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want any?&quot; Roxie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks, I&#39;ll think I&#39;ll stick with some milk or juice,&quot; you answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Luna agreed.<br />
<br />
The two of you collected some glasses and got out a carton of orange juice before sitting down at the small table there in the center of the kitchen. You both had to be a bit careful since the space wasn&#39;t big and thus you had to give Roxie and Kellie room to work. Eventually, though, Kellie turned and presented you and Luna with plates of omelets with cheese on top of them and then took another two plates of omelets and put them at the spaces for herself and Roxie. Roxie also passed over buttered slices of toast to each plate as well. You both thanked them for the effort and then waited for Kellie and Roxie to sit down at the table as you all began to have breakfast. For a moment there was a bit of silence, though that still only fed some nervousness in you and thus you decided to break it...<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what did you want to talk to Luna and me about?&quot; you asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;In some ways it&#39;s going to relate to preparing for the future,&quot; Kellie said slowly, &quot;and particularly for you and Luna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean... like... a wedding?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded, as did Roxie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You love her, don&#39;t you?&quot; Roxie asked, &quot;and want to be with her, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I mean...&quot; you stuttered weakly, and blushing a little bit from embarrassment, &quot;in some ways it feels like something out of a fairy tale. Always liking Luna but never being able to bring up the courage to ask her out and then suddenly learning she felt the same way about me... and how we&#39;ve been connecting after she turned me. It&#39;s something I never want to end. And I&#39;d always want to be at Luna&#39;s side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled approvingly to you both, &quot;and that would mean a wedding, particularly with Luna pregnant. It may take a few weeks to confirm it medically, but from some of the reports that have gone on with new MILF-wolves, Luna wasn&#39;t the last born MILF-wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some were probably even conceived as MILF-wolves, where Luna&#39;s status came because of her connection to her mother when she got bit,&quot; Roxie added.<br />
<br />
&quot;And both of us would like to be able to walk you and Luna down the aisle before Luna&#39;s pregnancy becomes too advanced,&quot; Kellie commented, &quot;It would then give you something you could pass to your daughter when she grows up and get married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Luna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s an old family tradition,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;the mother passes down her wedding dress to her daughter, provided things fit. Now, Luna, you&#39;re a bit too voluptuous to wear my wedding dress... and thus your grandmother&#39;s as well... so you would need a new one, and preferably something that you can pass down.&quot;<br />
<br />
You took a few bites of the omelet as Luna slowly nodded. A part of you was amazed at how right Luna was in predicting the subject that Kellie wanted to talk about, though it&#39;d also be understandable given the host of various things going on, many of them being important. The fact that they were all going on at the same time would be something that couldn&#39;t be avoided.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t necessarily oppose tradition...&quot; you spoke up after a moment, &quot;my prime worry is that I do not wish to rush Luna into anything. I mean, everything from becoming a MILF-wolf with her and yesterday... it&#39;s been magical, but I wouldn&#39;t want to rush anything to where we&#39;re then getting married in a week...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be that fast,&quot; Kellie chuckled, &quot;it&#39;d be nice, but not that fast. Though it would be preferable that the wedding be some time in late June to July. Luna wouldn&#39;t be showing much at that time and we would have time to schedule when, where, and how the services would be done. And a lot of that will take time. Particularly when there will be other things like who you invite and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Roxie agreed, &quot;you might both need to explain to any friends you had in high school your status as MILF-wolves if you are to invite them, and that could be complicated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Outside of Luna... I never really had &quot;friends&quot; in high school,&quot; you said slowly, &quot;there may have been those that were friendly and wouldn&#39;t say &quot;get lost&quot; or anything like that... but none that would be that close. About the only ones I&#39;d wish to invite would be my family... and stepmom... as well... she&#39;s also family.&quot;<br />
<br />
You noticed that Luna looked down a bit, which got you nervous. You didn&#39;t think anything you&#39;d said related to Luna&#39;s response, as to a degree it was also something Luna already knew. So this had to be something else.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never really figured out how to tell them,&quot; Luna said slowly, &quot;I mean... Karen, Tiffany, and Celeste have been good friends, but they&#39;ve also been the jumpy sort. I don&#39;t think they hate MILF-wolves, but they know the general news on how our libidos are higher than mundane werewolves and that we&#39;re all female. And that any man I sleep with would be like Nicki... becoming a MILF-wolf as well. That&#39;s all stuff that they might be uneasy with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In theory all the registration laws should have them knowing that your mother and I are MILF-wolves and that therefore YOU are a MILF-wolf,&quot; Roxie pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not everyone reads through that list, though,&quot; you spoke up, &quot;I never did... I may have seen the news reports that required MILF-wolves to register their identities, but I never went to the web-page where that registration is posted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I know they haven&#39;t, either,&quot; Luna said weakly, &quot;though... they are friends, and a part of me would like to have them there.&quot;<br />
<br />
You reached for Luna&#39;s hands, &quot;I&#39;d be there to help you explain... if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be the problem,&quot; Luna said, &quot;a part of me thinks they&#39;d ultimately accept my being a MILF-wolf... but while they weren&#39;t the bullying type or cruel... they also weren&#39;t that fond of you as Nick. They thought you a weak and nerdy geek...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been called worse,&quot; you admitted, &quot;and besides, if they can&#39;t respect you for who you love... they may not have been real friends to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Luna admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s also base things to arrange like the what, when, and where to schedule,&quot; Kellie spoke, though her voice a bit more uneasy, &quot;Roxie and I can help with the scheduling... but that could still take time.&quot;<br />
<br />
You patted Luna&#39;s hands and said to her, &quot;Do you think early July would be rushing it? It&#39;d give us time to also handle some of the other stuff going on and the Wolf Hunters will hopefully be gone by then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be fine,&quot; Luna regained her smile and looked back to her mother, &quot;though, I think a justice of the peace in the city park would be fine for the ceremony, regardless of who comes to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d actually work,&quot; Roxie mused, &quot;as to a degree they don&#39;t like things being rushed either.&quot;<br />
<br />
You barely held back a chuckle at the joke and took a bite of your toast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you want a reception?&quot; Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That could be nice, as even if my friends ultimately don&#39;t want to come... I&#39;m sure that there would be family members besides those living here that would want to come,&quot; Luna commented, &quot;though I wouldn&#39;t be sure on where to go for it right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can ask around for you,&quot; Roxie offered, &quot;there are a few places that could host that sort of thing. The bigger thing might be more with the official photographers. The ones that might do the best job aren&#39;t in town... or at least, let&#39;s say, I&#39;m not fond of the photography studio that is in town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to be a drain on your money or anything,&quot; you said nervously as some things were touching on cost issues that you didn&#39;t know for sure but privately figured would be expensive.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you wouldn&#39;t be,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;for so long as my baby girl smiles and is confident in who she loves... that would make any price worth it. Which is in part why we&#39;re talking about this now. It can help us work through things and see what the potential financial costs would be, along with the specifics on when they happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Particularly as some things may get complicated depending on how long or active the Wolf Hunters decide to be,&quot; Kellie commented, &quot;It&#39;ll conflict with a lot of things... wedding planning, summer jobs, training to help you both focus to control the transformation... all of it. And working on some ideas now, will help get through everything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and admitted to yourself that there was some sense to that.</p>
