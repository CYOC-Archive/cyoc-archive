<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle almost felt bad for Greg, watching him march off into the distance. His moans carried for what seemed like miles, as his new pair of Amazonian bodymates pleasured both him and themselves incessantly.<br />
<br />
Kyle walked home as quickly as he could, eager to spend another evening masturbating his 5 crotches. <i>Maybe I&#39;ll stream it this time, I made an astonishing amount of money last week</i>. He had to hand it to Jen, he loved his body now, surrounded by his 8 sexy legs. The chafing was unreal, though, given how each of his asses rubbed against his original legs, and each other.<br />
<br />
Once home, he scarfed down his dinner. Eight legs demanded quite the number of calories, though he felt like he&#39;d been eating more lately. He shrugged it off, after finishing his 3rd Big Mike, and made a beeline to his bedroom. 10 hours of &quot;rest&quot; and his crotches already ached.<br />
<br />
He assumed his position on his bed. He tucked his rearmost pair behind him, leaning back onto his thighs like a seat. He then spread his side legs out, and splayed his front pair. Since they sprouted out of his torso at their respective navels, he had quite a bit of flexibility. He arched his front crotch up and forward, making his original legs visible. He noticed, briefly, in the video feed that they seemed to be more feminine. Kyle wasn&#39;t about to complain about that.<br />
<br />
He donned a costume head, to conceal his identity, and turned on his webcam. Already at 100+ viewers, the number climbed precipitously as the show began. His dick was rock hard, not that anyone could see it yet. He maneuvered his hands around his strange body, holding his dick in line with the front crotch&#39;s ass, and slammed it down. The moan that escaped his lips was undeniably nerdy, and male, causing a slew of comments to cascade down his screen.<br />
<br />
By now, thousands were watching him fuck his own ass. He began to play with his side pussies, each arm taking over its respective side. That left his rearmost one sopping wet, begging for attention. Taking a break from his right crotch, while his left one bucked against his torso, he reached behind him and grabbed a vibrator. He maneuvered it carefully onto his rearmost clit, and soon all 5 of his crotches were in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like hours, he waved his webcam goodbye, now several thousand dollars richer due to tips and subscriptions. Taking his costume head off, he finally breathed fresh air. His bodies ached, and his bed was sticky. He stunk. <i>And I forgot to lay down a towel</i> he thought, peeling his legs off of his bed.<br />
<br />
Climbing into the shower, he rinsed himself off. He lotioned down his legs, to keep them soft and supple. Drying off, he climbed into bed, completely unaware that talking to Jen had infected him. As it turned out, SMS lay dormant, ready to reactivate at any time, and the only symptom was an increased appetite for a short time before it reemerged. Kyle was none the wiser, assuming that he was eating more because his legs had grown a bit pudgier, due to his largely sedentary lifestyle. While he was sound asleep, however, the disease worked its magic.<br />
<br />
When he awoke, Kyle had to bite his pillow not to scream. His necks were cramped, and no wonder. SMS had wrecked complete havoc on his already unwieldy body.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s original torso had completely feminized. Apparently, being surrounded by 8 estrogen-pumping ovaries was quite enough to overpower his two, already quite demure testicles. But that didn&#39;t make him scream. No, he didn&#39;t mind his newly-sprouted J cups as they brushed, skin-on-skin, heavily over his torso. What made him scream was that they did this over his <i>torsos.</i><br />
<br />
From the neck down, his body split in 4. One front body, one rear body, and one to each side. Each was organized like his legs were, chests facing out. However, they were also each copies of his &quot;original&quot; body. So each had his now highly-feminized &quot;boy&quot; Kyle legs, and the 4 pairs of legs of Ms. Lorenza. Counting them out, he found he now had 20 pairs of legs. 16 were Lorenza&#39;s, and 4 were his. 40 legs. 16 vaginas. 4 penises. 8 arms. An overwhelming amount of flesh was piled onto his bed, which creaked under the new weight as he shifted positions.<br />
<br />
He was thankful, at least, that SMS leaves one with full, innate coordination. He wasn&#39;t sure how he would have been able to get out of bed without that. He also found that each body had also copied the pudge of his now-original one. He was beginning to get a bit into the BBW gamer market, he realized, looking at his body again in detail. Each original one had a bit of a pouch, as did his additional crotches. His thighs were a bit thicker, too, and his original body&#39;s asses pressed onto the rear ones, which were almost like shelves. Almost. &quot;I have to tone up,&quot; he told himself, admiring his new multitude in the mirror.<br />
<br />
As he stumbled about the room, he became less and less distressed by his new form. It was his new normal, after all. SMS was kind in that regard. However, he realized as his mom called him down to breakfast, that he did face a new challenge. Getting through doorframes was bad enough with one of his bodies, but now, with four? He groaned.<br />
<br />
He squeezed his front body through a bit sideways, and then pressed it against the doorframe as his right body pivoted through. His chest spread out onto the wall, soft as pillows, but heavy. He sighed, giving a breast a squeeze. He then pivoted his rear body out, and walked his final, left one, through the door. They rubbed against the frame, causing him to shiver a bit at his sensitivity. He dreaded the front door, but that was for later. For now, pancakes.<br />
<br />
Walking down to the kitchen was a challenge in itself, too. His new bodies barely fit in the hallway, they took up so much space. He shoved all of his bodies as close as he could, and his chests still rubbed against the walls on each side. He shuddered as his nipples grazed the wall, sensitive. His hands instinctively held his chest up on his left and right bodies, shielding them from the paint, pictures, and door frames as he slowly made his way to the kitchen, where a pile of pancakes stood waiting for him.<br />
<br />
One side of the table had no chair. He assumed he had to stand now, and started scarfing them down while his mom said good morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gmm mmrrffng&quot; he said, mouth full of pancakes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to cover up, dear, your boobs are out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle blushed, forgetting that he was stark naked. Jen&#39;s curse only made that acceptable from the waist down, he remembered, not the neck. His mom left for a moment. When she came back, she leaned between his bodies, placing a pile of clothes on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, I grabbed some of your shirts,&quot; his mom said, laying them out. 4 button ups. <i>Of course, not like I can get a t shirt on anymore</i> he thought, with a tinge of melancholy. He thanked her, and slipped them on. He buttoned up the front shirt with ease, but each side shirt was awkward. While he did that, his mom helped him with the back one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it&#39;s hard for you to do that one without a mirror,&quot; she said. Kyle thought for a moment, about what a predicament the curse had gotten him into.<br />
<br />
He was worried now though, since SMS lays dormant. What if his meeting with Jen triggered hers, too?</p>
