<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad was jostled awake by a particularly rough patch of turbulence.  Immediately, he felt cold sweat on his back.  Something was very wrong with him.  Without looking down, he ran his hand across his crotch, afraid of what he would find.  To a mixture of his surprise and horror, he felt the outline of an average sized male penis.  While his new member was almost identical to his normal one, the act of touching it made him shudder.  He didn&#39;t understand why but his body institutionally  pulled his hands up to his pecks.  Again, he felt a feeling of existential horror.  His chest felt physically normally but a deep thought of longing stabbed through his brain like a hot knife.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Where were his breasts?&quot; This thought never occurred to Brad before but it now consumed his being.  He wasn&#39;t an exceptionally attractive guy but he did well for himself.  His girlfriend Sharon and him were set to celebrate their two year anniversary in a few weeks.  After he built up a bit of courage, Brad looked down and again felt a feeling a panic build within him.  The feeling of his penis laying gently against his inner thigh made the hairs on his arm stand on end and the thought of quickly pulling his penis in an attempt to remove it from his body flashed through is mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright bitches,  collect your shit and get ready to go.  The second this plane lands, I want to get going.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Brad looked up and to the right to see a blonde co-ed standing in the aisle of what appeared to be a jet airplane.  She looked like a spoiled sorority girl with more money than sense.  She wore dark sunglasses and a long and fur-lined coat.  Across her chest was a leather Louis Vuitton purse.  With a cool as ice demeanor, she leaned against the side of an aisle seat and scanned the back rows of the plane.  <br />
<br />
Brad turned around and looked to see what was happening around him.  As he did, the general lack of sensation in his chest made him uncomfortable and, for a brief moment, he dreaded the idea of running his fingers through his short hair.  Out of some foreign habit, he ran his arm across his shoulder, as if to pull back imaginary strands of hair.   <br />
<br />
Behind him he saw four girls sitting alone in different seats.  Across the plane, a very tall, lanky looking girl with a brown pixie cut awkwardly brushed drool off her face and wiped her eyelids.  She reminded Brad of a thespian girl he knew in high school.  She wore a floral print sun dress that looked like something Brad&#39;s grandmother might own.  Further behind him, Brad saw two Asian girls bickering with each-other.  They appeared to be identical twins.  Each wore a thin, blue runners jacket, a loose fitting school T-shirt and grey track pants.  Unlike the girl across the hall, these girls were about average height with tight, athletic builds.  <br />
<br />
As he sized the twins up, an Indian girl opened the restroom door at the back of the plane and awkwardly walked to a seat.  Even though this girl wasn&#39;t Brad&#39;s usual type, the sight of her made him instantly aroused.  His mind told him that she was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.  Unfortunately, the feeling of his erect penis was so uncomfortable, Brad audibly yelped.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; asked the girl across the hall.  Her voice wavered as she spoke, as if she was uncomfortable with the sound of her voice.  Brad noticed that she had her arms tightly crossed against her stomach and she nervously bounced her legs up and down.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know, don&#39;t care,&quot; responded the blonde in the aisle.  She appeared to be completely disinterested in the state of the group.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We know that&#39;s you, Drew.  Fuck you!  You promised we&#39;d all get laid this week.  You know for fucking sure that we didn&#39;t want to get laid AS chicks,&quot;  yelled one of the twins as she visibly vibrated with anger.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m Drew.  Your point?  I didn&#39;t ask for us to be chicks but who cares?  Getting laid is getting laid.&quot;  As Drew spoke, he rolled his eyes, cocked his head back and looked at the ceiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the biggest misogynist I know.  How are you okay with this?&quot;  asked the other twin.  Her voice was more collected but still clearly agitated.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on bitches.  Male, female, what does it matter?&quot;  To emphasize his point, Drew groped his body&#39;s D-cup breasts then dramatically let them go. &quot;I&#39;m still the hottest thing to walk this earth and I paid for us to have an awesome vacation.  Pull your old dicks out of your asses and collect your shit.&quot;  As he finished, Drew dramatically spun in place and started to walk to the front of the plane.  A few minutes later, the plane landed on the ground and the group collectively pulled the bags from above their respective seats and made their way to the door.</p>
