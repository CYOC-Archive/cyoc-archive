<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeff scrolled through the packages available to him, he came upon one titled &quot;Vector Transformation&quot;. Not understanding what that would imply, he clicked it and was brought to its about page.<br />
<br />
It read very optimistically:<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the Vectorization package! What does vector mean? It means the change occurs around you! Change your peers just by having them look at you, come in contact with you, be near you, or even just think about you! Perfect for beginners and experienced alike, this package also provides a quick-change menu so you can adapt freely to your new surroundings! Alter anything you like, from how they walk to how they think! They don&#39;t even have to be human, before or after the transformation! Enjoy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Properly piqued, Jeff went to the downloads page and grabbed the most recent version. After it finished downloading, it auto-installed itself onto the Chronivac without any celebration. It commanded a reboot and auto-closed the Chronivac program. A little annoyed with the forcefulness of the package, Jeff clicked the re-opened the Chronivac and was greeted with a screen that was different before.<br />
<br />
Instead of the program&#39;s header reading just &#39;Chronivac 4.0&#39;, it  was followed with &#39; - Vectorization Package 2.5.1.&#39; Furthermore, the program had simplified into two partitions, with an entire section labeled &quot;Vector Subject Information&quot; on the left, and an entire section labeled &quot;Transformation&quot; on the right side of the screen. Each side was very distinct from the other, but had various similarities.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided to explore the &quot;Vector Subject Information&quot; half first. In the partition itself was another partition for the top and the bottom, with the top taking up the most space. The top partition&#39;s header read &#39;Quick-Change Menu&#39;, and had several different fields. However, they were all blank and grayed out, with just a &quot;Scan&quot; button at the top being available.<br />
<br />
With nothing else to press, he clicked &#39;Scan&#39;. The external portion of the Chronivac whirred for a few seconds and the &#39;Scan&#39; button pulsed every second. Then, all the fields filled out with his information again. The first field was simply his name. It contained his full name, and clicking it allowed him to change it freely. The second field was also simple: his age.<br />
The next tab however, was very interesting. It held his gender, and it was set to &#39;Male&#39;. It also had a drop-down menu with three other options: &#39;Female&#39;, &#39;Hermaphrodite&#39; and &#39;Custom&#39;. Selecting &#39;Custom&#39; made two sliders, with a male icon and female icon for each slider respectively. The final two fields were designated &#39;Species&#39; and &#39;Body&#39;. Instead of a text box or options, there were just two icons with the addition symbol on it and the word &#39;expand&#39; on each. Jeff decided to leave those alone.<br />
<br />
The bottom partition on the left side of the screen was labeled simply &#39;Vector options&#39;. There were only two categories, a check-box, and another expand button. The first category was named &#39;Vector Type&#39;. It currently did not have anything selected, but it did contain a drop-down menu which contained the following options:<br />
- Vector&#39;s Sight<br />
- Subject&#39;s Sight<br />
- Proximity<br />
- Awareness<br />
- Contact<br />
Jeff supposed the &#39;Vector&#39;s Sight&#39; would refer to himself, while the &#39;Subject&#39;s Sight&#39; would refer to anyone looking at him. Selecting &#39;Proximity&#39; brought up a text-box requesting a radius in meters. Selecting &#39;Awareness&#39; and &#39;Contact&#39; didn&#39;t bring up anything special, but Jeff figured those were self explanatory.<br />
<br />
The only other editable field in the bottom partition of the &#39;Vector Options&#39; was labeled &#39;Vector Toggle&#39;. It was also a drop down, but contained only two options:<br />
<br />
-Exposure<br />
-Trigger<br />
<br />
Besides each options was an available tool tip. &quot; &#39;Exposure&#39; only makes transformations occur while the conditions are met.&quot; stated the first. &quot; &#39;Trigger&#39; makes transformations occur once the conditions are met.&quot;. Jeff shrugged. It was pretty straight forward. <br />
<br />
The check-box was on by default, and was followed by a simple phrase: &#39;Alter Reality&#39;. Jeff was unsure if it altered all transformations, or only the vector-caused transformations. In the final element of the left partition was another addition icon, followed by &#39;adv. options.&#39; Jeff, for the moment, decided not to expand it. With that, he had explored the left partition.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Jeff leaned back and changed his gaze to the Right partition of the package. It was not seperated into partitions, but it did possess five large categories. They were all minimized and required expanding to view. Jeff sighed again, knowing now he couldn&#39;t avoid some of the complicated aspects of the program. The categories were listed in the following order:<br />
- Species<br />
- Age<br />
- Gender<br />
- Mental<br />
- Body<br />
They were the exact same as the menu on the left partition, yet they all required their own expander.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided to jump right in, and extended the &#39;Species&#39; tab. He was greeted with a search box asking for the name of an organism and several sub-categories in the form of buttons. They were labeled along the lines of &#39;Canine&#39;, and &#39;Marsupial&#39;, but were also labeled &#39;Reptile&#39;, and &#39;Mythological&#39;. Jeff noted the inconsistency in how specific each category was. At the bottom, he was greeted with yet another &#39;adv. options&#39; expander.<br />
<br />
Closing the &#39;Species&#39; tab, he expanded the &#39;Age&#39; tab. The tab was small, with only several elements to utilize. The first was an unmarked check-box followed by the text &quot;set age to:&quot; with a text box immediately following that. Below that, another unmarked check-box with the text &#39;increase age by [] years per [].&#39; The first text-box accepted any number, and the second was a drop-down ranging from seconds to years. The final element utilized the same prompts, except it dealt with decreasing age. Jeff decided to accept the fact that all these categories had an extra &#39;Adv. Options&#39; tab.<br />
<br />
Next up was the &#39;Gender&#39; tab. Oddly enough, it was a clone of the left partition&#39;s counter-part. Unimpressed, Jeff closed that tab and opened the &#39;Mental&#39; Tab. Immediately, the Chronivac stuttered for a second, and the entire right partition was filled with hundreds of fields. Mental age, mental security, mental identity, major personality, minor personality, quirks, preferences, and much more. At the top, there was a button that simply stated: &quot;Simplify&quot;. Jeff hastily clicked it. The Chronivac stuttered again, and many of the available categories disappeared. The ones that did stay were no longer text-boxes, but sliders. Some of these included:<br />
- Libido<br />
- Sexuality<br />
- Inhibition<br />
- Independency<br />
- Maturity<br />
- Values<br />
There were still dozens, but those six rested at the top of the page. Jeff decided he&#39;d tackle the mental change tab when he had to, and then closed it.<br />
<br />
The final tab was labeled &#39;Body&#39;. Jeff sighed inwardly, not sure what to expect after the mental tab. To his surprise, he was greeted with a 3D model that he could turn and rotate. Double-clicking certain body-parts brought up several fields relating to them. Clicking on the default model&#39;s penis brought up several options along the line of its length, thickness, sensitivity, and instances. Jeff felt relief; the body tab was much more intuitive than the mental tab.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the package itself was a field that simply provided a text box, inquiring &quot;Duration of Transformation?&quot; The default was set at five minutes.<br />
<br />
Jeff leaned back into his chair. He&#39;d explored at least the surface of what he could do with the package. Should he try to find out more? Or should he get transforming?</p>
