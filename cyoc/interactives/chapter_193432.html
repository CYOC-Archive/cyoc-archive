<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl however had waited too long to grab the phone, and his increasingly chubby shrinking fingers struggled to pick up the receiver as it grew out of his grip and his reach was no longer as far as it had been. From his blackened monitor Carl could see he was quickly passing through toddlerhood, regaining baby fat, his hair growing shorter and beginning to thin, and all the while he kept shrinking. Soon he couldn&#39;t even see the monitor, and he found kneeling to be hard and uncomfortable as he leaned back, causing him to fall back in the gigantic chair. The world was large, he was small, and his emotions were out of control--he just wanted to be safe and assured that Ethan would fix the problem. And so he did as all babies did--he cried. Positively wailed, long and loud.<br />
<br />
It was then that a knock was heard on his office door. A few moments later, Melissa was opening the door--only she looked different... younger, that&#39;s what it was, she looked closer to 20 or 19 than the 36 she had been on his date.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carl are you--oh Carl!&quot; called Melissa, and she saw him and rushed over to him immediately, her large firm breasts seeming to strain her blouse as she did--which seemed odd, but all Carl could think when he saw those breasts was oddly not sex... but food.<br />
<br />
Melissa when she had been in college had gotten pregnant. By the time she had found out about the baby, it was too late to abort, so she carried it to term and put it up for adoption. As she picked up Carl from out of his oversized dress shirt, she felt the strap on her bra break as she slipped back to 19, when she had had her baby, and when her body had been in overdrive to produce milk for it.<br />
<br />
Feeling uncomfortable with the straps of her bra now awkwardly rubbing up against her, Melissa decided the best thing would be to take off her bra. Managing to balance the infant Carl on her hip, she awkwardly managed to strip her shirt and bra off--the moment of which her breasts were free, she noticed they were leaking, and feeling heavy with milk for the baby she had given away for them both to have a better life.<br />
<br />
Carl was feeling rather infantile and starved at the moment, and he reached out for the closest breast with both hands and managed to draw her attention as he began to suckle from her breast. At first Melissa felt shocked and nearly broke off the touch immediately. It wasn&#39;t until she saw some of her milk dribble out of the eager mouth that Carl was filling, that certain dormant motherly instincts kicked in, and she brought Carl up closer to her breast in a cradling fashion.<br />
<br />
The effect of the serum interacting with the mother&#39;s milk, wasn&#39;t something that Ethan had thought to test, and now Carl, whose attention was mostly on the meal he was getting from Melissa, if he had stopped to be burped, would have notice a strange tingling sensation from around his belly button, his umbilical chord was beginning to regrow as Carl slipped further from infant to newborn with each gulp. Melissa, feeling odd, sat down herself into her boss&#39; chair.<br />
<br />
Melissa herself felt an odd sensation as her body began to reverse itself back into a pregnant state it had been at that age--her belly stretching as her womb stretched and her cervix did as well. Carl&#39;s umbilical chord soon was long enough to reach Melissa, it began to poke and prod--causing Melissa to be brought out of the rather discomforting feelings she was feeling from all the changes, to a feeling of shock and horror as it sunk into her head that her boss was growing young enough to need a womb to continue living, and it seems her own womb was readying itself for the task. Scared by what might happen if the chord failed to find a womb, Melissa stood up and dropped her skirt and panties, stepping out of them and her shoes, feeling that they&#39;d only be in the way of what was surely to come.<br />
<br />
With the clothing out of the way, it took Carl&#39;s chord barely any time at all to find her vagina and enter it, soon connecting with her and an odd feeling began as she felt the chord begin to grow a sac inside her, further stretching her already stretched belly. It was then she began to feel labor pains again and she let out a grunt and a groan as she felt her body contract not as though she were pushing, but instead as though it were pulling upon the chord as Carl was pulled from her breast and in order to keep him from falling to the floor, Melissa did her best to lay him down beneath her and squat over him, preparing for what was surely to come.<br />
<br />
Outside the office, her screams and groans largely went unnoticed as everyone was still on lunch break and were on another floor of the office building, eating lunch. She screamed but no one could hear her scream as Carl&#39;s feet stretched her already dilated cervix a bit further, and still the process continued until his whole head stretched it the farthest it had been since her pregnancy the first time around, and then with one final pull, he was pulled further up and in to Melissa&#39;s womb.<br />
<br />
By now, all complex thoughts Carl had had were beginning to fade as he settled into his new Mommy&#39;s womb, moving about and shifting until he found a tight fetal position to curl up and feel safe and secure in. Memories were fading, worries were gone, and all that Carl could think about was the rhythm of his Mommy&#39;s heartbeat as it began now to pump blood for him.<br />
<br />
Outside, the contractions began to lessen now that Carl had settled into his new home, and Melissa&#39;s breathing slowly returned to normal as from the exhaustion of the reverse birth she collapsed into Carl&#39;s chair once again, and placed her hands protectively on her stretched stomach.</p>
