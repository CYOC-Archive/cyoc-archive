<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris had been working out, taking testosterone, going to the gym when he appeared in the showers. Men were nude, black, white and Latino. Despite embracing his male form something must have set him off. All the dicks swinging around must have triggered his transformation. Before he knew it he was nude and Julia again. Worse of her blood dripped from pussy and mixed into the shower water, she was having her period!<br />
<br />
The men were <br />
<br />
He needed female underwear and clothes like a diabetic needed insulin, he needed clothes for Julia. The Extractor&#39;s punishment was embarrassment turn Julia on and off like a person might flick the lights on and off in a darkened room. She found herself knocking on Amy&#39;s door.<br />
<br />
She told Amy a story close to the truth that she was still unable to get their hands on clothes. Julia claimed that she and Chris weren&#39;t getting along, she had his credit card but that was it. She brought a white bra, with underwear shorts and matching shirt. She brought bras and panties that were sexy but not G-strings. Julia also picked up bikinis favoring red and blue.<br />
<br />
Her shirts were loose and she wore jean shorts with ballet flats when she got around. She needed a look and she went for Audrey Hepburn. Although she didn&#39;t have Hepburn&#39;s dark eyes and she was a good head taller. However with a 60s style hair wrap and the glasses she pulled it off. After a few drinks she kissed Amy, and soon they had their closes off and were rubbing their breasts against each other. <br />
<br />
More out of a need to gain an assistant, even Dracula needed a Renfield, and Amy was both geographically and personally close. Chris came around to Amy&#39;s place and spoke to her about Julia. <br />
<br />
&quot;Never seen us together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she says bad things about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we are the same person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bullshit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can prove it.&quot;<br />
<br />
A loud &quot;Thoomp!&quot; and Chris&#39; balls and dick had become a vagina, she doubled over in pain as the changes happened so rapidly (but still painfully) that by the time she stood up her hair was at it&#39;s normal length and her breasts plunged deeply into Chris&#39; green polo shirt. Her nipples were erect, like glass cutters. <br />
<br />
&quot;Touch them, you did last night and tell me I&#39;m wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s long fingered delicate hands felt up Julia&#39;s breasts soon she took her polo shirt off and they were groping each other&#39;s bodies. Julia&#39;s breasts were bigger and she fumbled for the bra strap clasp. Amy was jealous about Julia&#39;s rack but she accepted that Chris was cursed. Julia had Amy&#39;s bra of her perky B cup breasts bounced free as Julia tackled her neighbor to the carpet. <br />
<br />
Julia kissed Amy on her petal warm lips, the taste of her lipstick. Amy&#39;s breasts were already erect, her nipples were hard. Megan&#39;s training allowed Julia to have Amy moaning in pleasure. She lifted Amy&#39;s panties and started attacking her pussy lips. Amy twitched and jerked with desire. Her orgasms were small, almost like stage orgasms but her hips jerked, what they lacked in sound they made up with sincerity. Julia was treating Amy in a way no man had. <br />
<br />
Her breaths became hard and more shallow as she panted like a bitch in heat. Julia made her climax with a long drawn out moan. They lay in each other arms with Amy&#39;s head on Julia&#39;s breasts. Eventually Julia said: &quot;We need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am being held hostage by a mad scientist and I need your help. I am slipping from Chris to Julia, I agreed to be this &#39;Extractor&#39;s&#39; test subject and it worked! But now I realize the lies I was told. She can have at least several forms, I was told it would last a few hours. I am a guinea pig, a rhesus macaque, a canary in a cage for that monster. I need help in getting my life back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy sighed, her breasts heaving.<br />
<br />
&quot;We go to the police.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I could go to jail for this. I don&#39;t know what I am turning into. The Extractor must be held responsible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellen was wearing a black sports bra and baggy red shorts along with black tennis shoes and black socks. She pulled her long auburn hair up into a ponytail and started her work out. <br />
Ellen was going really well, everything felt good; in fact it felt easy to her. She stopped when she got an itch on her chest that she just couldn’t shake. She got up from her machine, and bumped her head on the overhead bar. “Ow” she yelled rubbing her head “Stupid bar…never hit that damn thing before…Shit that hurts” As she walked across the room to get a drink, the itch on her chest got worse and then her legs started to itch. “Fuck…I itch all over” she said.<br />
Ellen downed her water in three large gulps; she wiped her brow with a towel and turned toward the mirror. “What?” she said to herself. She walked toward the mirror with a confused look on her face. The mirror seemed lower; it was cutting off the top of her head. As she walked closer, it got worse until she was standing in front of it and the top of the mirror was at her chin. She looked around the room and realized that everything looked smaller to her now. That was when she felt the pinch in her shoes. <br />
She looked down and knew that something was definitely wrong “What the fuck is going on?” she said as she realized that one; the ground was definitely farther away from her eyes and two: her toes were just about to burst out the ends of her shoes. She quickly yanked her feet out of the shoes and she peeled her socks off; dropping them in disbelief. “What the hell happened to my feet?  “Holy Shit! I’m turning into back!”<br />
“Oh man this is happening” She stammered “This is so fuckin crazy” she said as her legs continued to grow and change. She had worked out, but her baby fat had held firm in some places even in her twenties. Now her thighs grew long and toned and muscled and her calves bulked up losing their femininity. Her ass rode up and her hips pulled inward. That was when the itch in her groin took off. There was a burning and pulling sensation as her female anatomy rearranged itself. She felt a popping sensation as testicles descended out of her and her penis grew and grew making the fabric of her shorts strain as she stood at attention.<br />
Ellen’s hands hit the shaft through the shorts and she squeezed tightly, throwing her head back in excitement “I’ve got a dick!” she yelled in a much deeper voice than she had spoken in before.<br />
She laughed a deep laugh as her left hand clutched at the Adam’s apple now protruding from her throat.  “This is so fucking awesome” Her waist widened and her stomach became more defined as the itch in her chest intensified. He ripped off the now very tight black sports bra and watched in wonder as her breasts shrunk back into her body. Her nipples shrank down and hair sprouted across her chest.<br />
His shoulders rose up and his arms lengthened and grew stronger and more muscular. He put his hands before his face. They were stockier and the veins stuck out more on the backs; as his fingers and palms become rougher and calloused. He even had hair on his knuckles now.<br />
Ellen spun toward the mirror and crouched down. Already looking at his strong chest, he crouched down into a squatting position and watched as his face changed. He ripped the band from his hair and for the last time, hair fell over her shoulders. Quickly, it retreated inward leaving short red hair behind. Her brow thickened and her nose grew broader. His eyes got narrower and her ears came out. Stubble broke out across his upper lip, cheeks, chin, and jaw line as his jaw and chin became more pronounced. <br />
<br />
Ellen now stood up to his full 6’2” height and looked at his toned 210lb frame in the mirror.  Chris was doing something that was affecting his control even though he has made Chris Julia. Had the splice of the DNA been contaminated? He felt like Frankenstein having created the Creature.  Something had happened with Chris, may be it would Treatment B. Chris/Julia had to die.</p>
