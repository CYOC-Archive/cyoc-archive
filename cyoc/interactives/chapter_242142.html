<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had only been three days since Connor left home, but it already felt like a lifetime ago.<br />
<br />
During his time away, Connor had gone to great lengths to to protect the Hoti and Kane family. The veteran hunter worked with S.P.E.A.R, making peace with them and defeated a serious threat in the Amberhills. For the time being, peace was achieved, however it didn&#39;t mean there weren&#39;t consequences to be faced.<br />
<br />
Connor sustained a serious beating in his fight with the werewolf Henry Amberhill. The physical cuts and bruises were evident, but the internal injuries were just as severe. A bruised kidney and lung, a concussion, and a minor tendon tear in his shoulder would take time to heal. This was on top of artificial hip. Connor had been in a significant amount of pain since the fight, walking with an even more pronounced limp. Already he could tell significant damage was done, a second hip surgery perhaps closer than he wanted. Still, after everything, he felt it was worth it.<br />
<br />
The only problem now for the middle Moreland son was the reaction of his family. Nat was kind enough to inform both Caleb and Spark of what happened. Needless to say, neither seemed happy, especially with S.P.E.A.R&#39;s involvement. Connor was not looking for to the inevitable tongue lashing he would receive from both his brother and wife as he pulled into his driveway.<br />
<br />
Turning off the car, Connor looked to the wrap around front porch, noticing Caleb standing there waiting. Following their father&#39;s death, Caleb was thrust into a difficult role, acting as both brother and father to his younger siblings. In regards to Chase, it meant the pair butted heads more often than Connor could count. Connor though was different.<br />
<br />
At the time of his father&#39;s passing, Connor was 17 years old. Yes, it was young but he was nearly an adult at that time. It meant Caleb&#39;s relationship with Connor usually was more personable. Still, it didn&#39;t mean that Caleb hadn&#39;t occasionally brought the hammer down. Staring at Caleb, thoughts of those times formed in his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor, you need to do better with classes.&quot; &quot;Connor, don&#39;t worry mom by staying out past curfew.&quot; &quot;Connor, college is important, you need to focus on getting your degree, hunting isn&#39;t everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those were some of the interactions that Connor had where his brother acted as more of a paternal figure than a brother. At the time, it irked Connor but as time went on, he understood. Especially after he had children of his own. The brothers now laughed about those instances, bringing the pair even closer.<br />
<br />
Now though Connor could see the grim expression on Caleb&#39;s face. It reminded him of his father, that stern, intimidating glare that often made the brothers wilt in their youth. Caleb looked none too pleased as Connor now exited his car, wincing in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Caleb stated. &quot;When I put you in charge I expected something stupid to come from Chase. Wasn&#39;t expecting you to charge off like some damn comic book hero.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Caleb I....&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor wasn&#39;t able to finish as Caleb approached, squeezing his brother in a hug that made the younger man grunt in pain. &quot;I&#39;m proud of you,&quot; Caleb said with pride. &quot;Dad would be too. Your crazy ass pulled off one of the bravest things I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
A goofy smile now cracked across Connor&#39;s face as Caleb now smacked his little brother upside the head. &quot;Don&#39;t ever scare me like that again ya dipshit!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No promises,&quot; Connor laughed. &quot;Besides can&#39;t let you and the twins have all the fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
The brothers now began to laugh, Caleb clapping his brother on the shoulder as he pulled out a pair of cigars. It was a rare thing the two did to celebrate, usually accompanied by a glass of brandy. Connor was in the clear with his brother, but as the front door opened, Connor locked eyes with his wife Spark.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be inside,&quot; Caleb grinned. Connor nodded, watching as his brother advance up the stairs as he now turned to Spark. &quot;Don&#39;t be too hard on him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alone with Spark now, Connor locked eyes with his wife. Spark&#39;s sapphire blue eyes seemed to twinkle with tears, the petite woman&#39;s face tense. Connor wasn&#39;t sure if the woman was about to scream at him, punch him, or burst into tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi honey I&#39;m home,&quot; Connor smirked.<br />
<br />
Spark was quiet, slowly walking towards her husband. Slowly she raised her hand, caressing Connor&#39;s cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re mad,&quot; Connor said glumly. &quot;I get it. I took to big a risk, put myself in harms way. I need to be careful...for you and the kids. But...I needed to do this Spark! I&#39;ve... I&#39;ve felt like a burden to all of you for years...never felt like I pulled my weight. I ...I....had to Spark just to prove that I can still be the person you fell in love with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark said nothing, watching as tears filled Connor&#39;s eyes. She always suspected that he felt some bit of inadequacies and sadness about his injuries. To have him lay his soul bare to her like this now made tears fall from her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S...Spark?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just...just shut up for a moment okay,&quot; Spark sniffed. &quot;I get it why you did what you did, I&#39;m not dumb, I know you want to do more....but I love you Connor no matter what. I&#39;m just happy you&#39;re safe and I&#39;m so....so proud of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark now squeezed her husband in a massive hug, the longtime couple shedding silent tears as they gripped each other in a loving embrace. Connor and Spark would have stood there forever, holding one another until the hunter noticed his eldest daughter now quietly step onto the porch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaida I..&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor couldn&#39;t finish his sentence as the 12 year old girl lept at him, squeezing him in a hug as she sobbed. &quot;I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re home,&quot; Kaida cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m okay Kaida,&quot; Connor said softly. &quot;I&#39;m okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sounds of Connor&#39;s other children now echoed into the evening, the two younger kids happily jumping on their father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it true dad,&quot; Jay said excitedly. &quot;Did you beat the monsters?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sure did son,&quot; Connor smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew you would daddy,&quot; Cali said excitedly. &quot;Mommy and Kaida were scared but not me. My daddy is the strongest guy in the world!&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor chuckled softly, listening to the excitedly cheers of his children as Spark gave him a tender kiss. All the hunter could do was beam from ear to ear as he noticed the look of pride on his brother&#39;s face, a bottle of brandy and two glasses in hand. Despite his limitations and injuries, Connor had shown to himself that he was a burden to no one. Now, he could look forward to a well deserved drink and an evening basking in his family&#39;s love.</p>
