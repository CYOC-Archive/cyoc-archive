<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dean gulped as he watched this guy just really going to town out there on himself. Dean did not usually think of himself as male attracted, or adjacent to it at all, but something about this brazen display of sexuality was awakening a response in him. Something of a similar want or need. He tried to tell himself even as he sweat and his skin lightened a tinge that Todd might come down and end up seeing him like that. That someone like Mike might see him and he&#39;d be known forever as Wankin&#39; Dean around the school. <br />
<br />
Dean barely noticed as his hand started to drift down to his pants that his body composition was changing. He groped his manhood and moaned, &quot;G-Gotta keep control over myself...&quot; His body was tightening and toning up, abs sculpting themselves up into a sharp, powerful relief, suited for exertion during swimming, his shoulders developing greater tone along with his back and arms. He had thinned out already, now he was even standing there becoming more toned.<br />
<br />
Dean gulped and opened up his pants, &quot;Ooh...man, I-I&#39;m sure Todd is just off fucking around with that paranormal stuff. Now I can just...enjoy myself.&quot; Dean groaned as he felt his large, indecent manhood slip out of his skin tight underwear. Curious how light the skin was, but maybe it was just cold around here or something. Good thing he was not experiencing shrinkage of any other kind. He grinned as his jawline shifted outside his notice.<br />
<br />
His face becoming lighter, prettier somewhat, lips more visibly kissable and eyes wider and more expressive. His hair started to grow out a bit more and lighten a little further in color. Dean itched his pectoral as he felt his body hair retracting, acquiring the look of a man who shaved more or less everywhere for the sake of a swimming career. And not exactly one lacking in accomplishments.<br />
<br />
Dean stifled an even louder moan when he felt his ass grow a little larger and tighter and stronger. Pushing up against his clothes. He could barely handle it. By now he was smirking and pumping his hips into his all too eager hand. Muscles tightening and releasing on his arms, flexing with the effort in his masturbation. Dean wondered why he was feeling suddenly so much more at ease. It just seemed like a thing to do out here. Like his sense of taboo of open sexual displays was being eroded somehow.<br />
<br />
He still told himself he&#39;d be polite if Todd showed up. He&#39;d either zip up again even if he still needed to cum, or ask Todd if he wanted to jerk off too. Wouldn&#39;t blame him, Dean told himself, just look at this stud standing out here, just takin&#39; care of business. Dean almost lost his grip a few times, and then wondered if he was always uncut. He swore he didn&#39;t always have a foreskin...<br />
<br />
Dean&#39;s eyes went from almond colored to blue in the space of an instant as he gasped, watching the guy in the swimming area really seem to get into it. &quot;I&#39;m...not into the guys, but hot damn. I wouldn&#39;t mind fooling around with him if I was into guys...&quot; Dean murmured to himself. He didn&#39;t know why just watching was turning him on so much. He bit his lip, feeling it getting closer and closer. Just feeling so incredible...<br />
<br />
Dean almost fell backward as he felt the orgasm starting to surge up inside of him.<br />
<br />
He felt his sphincter clench and his nipples go erect, and Dean grit his teeth tight, &quot;I&#39;m...&quot; He couldn&#39;t even complete the sentence let alone thought as he felt his orgasm blast through him. It was just one more stroke that finished him off. Dean outright almost screamed from pleasure as he pumped his hips wildly, falling forward a bit and only just catching himself. His freckled, pretty boy face streaked with the sweat and telltale blush of a sexual experience.<br />
<br />
Except who was standing there now did not look much like Dean at all.<br />
<br />
He now resembled more some handsome, effete Norwegian swimmer. His body shorter, but much more compact and strong, toned everywhere. He needed some new clothes to wear, he knew it. Dean however still didn&#39;t even realize he&#39;d changed much at all. Despite by all accounts feeling oddly more...&quot;giggle-y&quot; now. &quot;Ohhh man...oh wow, wow, that was something else. I gotta do that again.&quot; Dean&#39;s lascivious smile was that of a man eagerly contemplating his girlfriend&#39;s embrace. Despite the inferred outlook of his current appearance.<br />
<br />
Dean looked outside for the first time since his own culmination of pleasure.<br />
<br />
It looked like the guy out there was just about done, and was now getting up. Damn, he looked like some kind of bodybuilder. All muscle and brawn and strength. Well, the dude looked nice enough. More than nice. Dean contemplated what to do. Something was weirdly imploring him to go and get in a swim. &quot;Should I make the approach...&quot;</p>
