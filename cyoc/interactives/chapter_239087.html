<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trip to Siberia would be a long one, they were to board the Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express and take it all the way to the Siberia, the trip would take at least a week. But this was the way Lady Roseblood desired to travel. Prince Andrew happily accommodated her request and the two entered the mortal realm in Poland and made their way up to Belarus.<br />
<br />
Travel during the night was something Prince Andrew was unaccustomed to. He felt stupid for forgetting that Lady Roseblood was not a dhampir like him, she was a full vampire and couldn’t go in the sunlight. She refused any protection spell or magic items, she was proud of her nature and preferred to travel like the rest of her kin. They stayed in luxury hotels as they made their way towards the Belarusian border. The first night they encountered a slight problem.<br />
<br />
After checking in and getting settled in their room Prince Andrew was flipping through a room service menu when he realized his companion’s biology. He looked towards her and she guessed his question and answered before he could ask.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about me your highness…I am not unaccustomed to procuring my own sustenance. Though it has been quite a while since I hunted in a city.” Lady Roseblood mused.<br />
<br />
“You mean killing someone? I understand but I don’t know if it’s such a good idea. Perhaps you could just drink animal blood?.” Andrew said.<br />
<br />
“Don’t tell me you’ve never drank from a human before?“ She replied.<br />
<br />
“I haven’t in fact. Father always kept us away from those things.” He revealed.<br />
<br />
“That’s a shame. No wonder you aren’t as powerful as I am.” She said and put her hand on Andrew’s chest and whispered passionately, “The blood of mortals not only nourishes us but it makes us stronger. To deny yourself this…..I hope his grace had a good reason…”<br />
<br />
Lady Roseblood then swayed away from him and looked out at the dawn sky from their window.<br />
<br />
“You know even Princess Isabella partakes in the blood of humans, even though she is a dhampir like you…and deadly Little Ann, you think she was born that powerful? No, it’s the feasting of a human’s life essence that made her so strong.” She explained.<br />
<br />
“T—T-That’s not the point, there are people after you remember. I just think we should keep a low profile.” Andrew offered.<br />
<br />
“No need to worry. I won’t make a scene…I am nothing if not…discrete.” She said cupping Andrew’s cheek with her hand.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think it’s a good idea. You can drink animal blood instead.” He replied a placing his hand on hers.<br />
<br />
They looked into each other’s eyes for a moment before she gently pulled away and faced the sunrise through the window. She pulled the curtains closed just as the sun peaked over the city skyline. However she stopped for a split second and a ray of sunlight escaped before she could close the curtain. She stood there for a moment, cupping the small burn before it began to heal. Then she turned back to the vampire prince.<br />
<br />
“Alright…I’ll drink animal blood…for you.” She said the last part quietly, “But I desire the blood from a virgin European Bison.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you. I’ll get you whatever you want. How about lamb’s blood? It’s a human delicacy so it has to be the equivalent for our kind right?” He said.<br />
<br />
“Blood from a lamb…symbolical of Christ, I don’t believe that would be very wise.” Roseblood explained.<br />
<br />
Andrew left to retrieve the blood she had asked for, he was unsure where to find bison blood but Lady Roseblood gave him the location of a restaurant that acted covertly as a vampire one as well. His thoughts were turned to what she had said. Would drinking human blood really make him stronger? Would it allow him to protect his family?<br />
<br />
When he returned he found her dressed only in a bath robe, her long wine colored hair was wet and she was dripping from the how shower she had just taken.<br />
<br />
“Y-you uh…you’re dripping water onto the carpet.” Andrew said, trying not to stare at her body through the thin robe.<br />
<br />
“That’s what maids are for.” She said.<br />
<br />
He handed her the bottle of bison blood. “Here it is. I hope it’s what you wanted.”<br />
<br />
She took the bottle, her fingers brushing against his. A spark ignited between them, a connection that was both electric and ancient. She smiled, a knowing smile that sent shivers down his spine.<br />
<br />
“It will do…for now.” she said, her voice low and seductive, “Your highness, it appears that you forgot to get yourself something to eat.<br />
<br />
“I’ll get something at the cafe down the street…perhaps we could go somewhere when the sun sets. We might as well see some sights while we’re here.” He offered.<br />
<br />
“I’d like that…but not tonight. Tomorrow.” She replied.<br />
<br />
Andrew nodded and left for the cafe. He didn’t see Lady Roseblood when he returned later in the day. He tossed the flowers he had bought her on the table as he read the note left on the kitchen counter.<br />
<br />
‘Dear Prince Andrew,<br />
I have elected to go shopping. Do not worry, I promise to not…partake in human blood.<br />
-Lady Roseblood.<br />
PS : I already picked out some sheep’s blood for dinner, it’s no lamb’s blood but it’s close enough.’<br />
<br />
The dhampir sighed and threw himself on the bed and soon fell asleep waiting for his love to return. When he awoke he found that he had slept through the night. His eyes adjusted to the light and he jumped up when he saw Lady Roseblood enter the room. She had dozens of shopping bags around her arms but the thing that surprised him was her clothes. She no longer wore her prim Victorian dresses. She now wore a designer winter coat with heeled boots and tight pants that hugged her curves. Her wine colored hair was in a tight ponytail and he could see that she had hidden her old blood eyes. He found himself lost in her deep blue eyes.<br />
<br />
“You look amazing.” Andrew couldn’t stop himself from saying.<br />
<br />
“Thank you. I couldn’t go walking around in my dresses outside the vampire realm.” She replied.<br />
<br />
“Wait. You were just outside?! But the sun, I thought—“ he said in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“Drinking animal blood has its uses: being able to walk in the sunlight, and avoiding unnecessary killing. There are some disadvantages…but it’s nothing you need to worry about.” Lady Roseblood explained.<br />
<br />
Andrew wanted to ask her more but was distracted by her appearance. She was beautiful before but dressed more casually and with her human eyes, she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t we go see some sights?” She said almost playfully.<br />
<br />
“I would love nothing more my lady.” Andrew replied.<br />
<br />
“You can call me Eveline. And I’ll call you Andrew. It will be less conspicuous, don’t you agree?” Eveline said.<br />
<br />
As they walked the streets of the polish city they marveled at the beautiful architecture and rich history of the land.<br />
<br />
“You know Andrew, this is the first time I have felt the sun on my skin since I was turned by your great grandfather.” She said.<br />
<br />
“Really? I don’t visit the mortal realm too often. I suppose it is nice.” Andrew replied.<br />
<br />
They soon found themselves surrounded by a market. The delicious sent of food weaved trough the vendor stands. The couple eventually came across one that caught Andrew’s nose; a Bu&#322;ka z pieczarkami stand. Andrew took in the delicious smell before purchasing one and returning to Eveline.<br />
<br />
“I know you can’t eat it, but you can still smell right?” Andrew asked holding up a roll to her nose.<br />
<br />
She smiled but gently moved it away from her face.<br />
<br />
“It smells like rot…all human food does. But I appreciate the thought.” Eveline said.<br />
<br />
“Really? My great grandmother used to cook for my siblings and I all the time. I apologize my lady, I had no idea.” Andrew said.<br />
<br />
“She was being polite.” Eveline replied.<br />
<br />
Andrew smiled too but was feeling like a jerk for not knowing. Eveline sensed this and grabbed his hand.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it. It hasn’t bothered me in centuries.” She smiled.<br />
<br />
The two continued their tour of the city and on the next day on their way to Belarus Evaline insisted they visit the Bia&#322;owie&#380;a Forest before they cross the Polish border and onto Moscow.<br />
<br />
The forest had a beautiful primeval feel to it, green and forest life everywhere. Andrew noticed Eveline strolling through the dense forest, she appeared enchanted by the beauty around them.<br />
<br />
“You like it here my Lady?” Andrew asked looking up at the magnificent trees high above them.<br />
<br />
“Yes. It’s beautiful but most of all…It’s so peaceful and natural…You know, we vampires weren’t always so civilized and decedent. The first of our kind hunted in these forests centuries ago, back when this forest covered the entire European Plain.” Eveline explained, her expression dreamy.<br />
<br />
“I guess I never thought about it before.” Andrew replied.<br />
<br />
“We should get going. It’s probably not safe to be in the middle of nowhere. Not with my would-be-killers still out there.” The vampire reminded.<br />
<br />
“I was starting to think you had forgotten.” Andrew said.<br />
<br />
“I almost did…but things are different now…I-I’m not…” she said too quiet for her companion to hear.<br />
<br />
Hours later they were in Moscow. There they would take the Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express all the way to Siberia. The winter streets of Moscow were blanketed in snow, despite hailing from even colder regions, he noticed Eveline pull her coat tighter, a slight shiver escaped her normally steely demeanor.<br />
<br />
Andrew decided to flag down a taxi and told Eveline to wait for him to find one. She nodded and he walked up the sidewalk looking to hail a cab. Meanwhile Eveline felt a presence and found herself unusually fearful. The crisp Moscow air bit at Eveline’s pale skin as she waited on the curb. She watched him, his dark hair tousled by the wind, she couldn’t help but smile at his frantic attempt to flag down a taxi.<br />
<br />
A group of men, faces obscured by the shadows of nearby buildings, materialized from the alleyway. Their eyes, cold and predatory, fixed on her. Eveline tried to ignore them, focusing on the distant glint of the oncoming cab. But they were relentless, their voices a low, menacing growl.<br />
<br />
“&#1069;&#1081;, &#1050;&#1091;&#1082;&#1086;&#1083;&#1082;&#1072;! &#1050;&#1072;&#1082; &#1085;&#1072;&#1089;&#1095;&#1077;&#1090; &#1090;&#1086;&#1075;&#1086;, &#1095;&#1090;&#1086;&#1073;&#1099; &#1087;&#1086;&#1076;&#1072;&#1088;&#1080;&#1090;&#1100; &#1085;&#1072;&#1084; &#1101;&#1090;&#1091; &#1084;&#1080;&#1083;&#1091;&#1102; &#1091;&#1083;&#1099;&#1073;&#1082;&#1091;!”<br />
<br />
“Such a pretty thing.” one sneered, speaking English, stepping closer.<br />
<br />
“O-&#1054;&#1089;&#1090;&#1072;&#1074;&#1100; &#1084;&#1077;&#1085;&#1103; &#1074; &#1087;&#1086;&#1082;&#1086;&#1077;.” Evaline said. <br />
<br />
Evaline flinched. Their touch, though fleeting, burned like fire. Fear, a foreign sensation, clawed at her throat. She tried to fight back, but the strength that had once been her constant companion was gone. She punched one of the men but all she had to show from it was a broken nose, she was aiming to break the man’s jaw off. The men then overpowered her, their laughter a cruel counterpoint to her despair. They shoved her against the wall and laughed at her struggle. She tried to kick, but the thug holding her neck put his leg between hers and kept her legs spread back.<br />
<br />
Tears welled in her eyes, a humiliating betrayal. She had always been the hunter, the predator. Now, she was prey.<br />
<br />
The cab screeched to a halt, Andrew’s face etched with concern as he saw the scene unfolding. With a roar of rage, he launched himself at the men, his strength amplified by his dhampir heritage. The fight was short-lived. He easily bested them and sent them scampering away.<br />
<br />
He pulled Eveline into his arms, his touch warm and gentle. “Are you alright, my lady?” His voice was rough with concern.<br />
<br />
Eveline clung to him, shame burning hotter than any of the men’s touches. “I-I I’m fine.” she whispered, the words catching in her throat despite her best efforts.<br />
<br />
Andrew held her close, his arms a comforting cage. “It’s alright Evaline. You’re safe now. I know I said to lay low but I didn’t mean you couldn’t defend yourself.”<br />
<br />
She darted her eyes away in shame and guilt consumed Andrew’s heart.<br />
<br />
“You…you couldn’t defend yourself…could you?” he said.<br />
<br />
“…N-No, I couldn’t…animal blood allows us vampires to walk in the sun…however…I-It doesn’t grant us the power or strength that human blood does.” She almost whimpered, ashamed of her weakness.<br />
<br />
“I-I…I’m so sorry my lady. I didn’t know…” the brown haired man apologized.<br />
<br />
“I should have told you…but then you wouldn’t have let me do it…I-I just wanted to join you in the sunlight…” she revealed pulling away.<br />
<br />
“No, it’s my fault. I promise I won’t put you in danger like that ever again. I swear it by my crown.” Andrew stated, “I will protect you.”<br />
<br />
“Protect me…” she looked away for a second before turning back. “Thank you, your highness. W-we should go. The cab won’t wait all day.” She said.<br />
<br />
They both walked to the car and Andrew held the door for her. She looked at him before she entered. She hated being treated so delicately. But she ignored those thoughts and allowed him to close the door behind her. Once Andrew was seated beside her they ordered the cap to head to the train station.</p>
