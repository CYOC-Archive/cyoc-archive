Warning: This chapter has a hetero sex scene at the end. It will be the only one in the story. <br />
<br />
Aaron awoke on Saturday to the sound of knocking on his…well, his dad’s bedroom door. He slowly got out of bed as the door opened. <br />
<br />
“Geez, dad.” Aaron covered up his now massive body with the blanket.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry. It’s not like I haven’t seen any of that before, it being my body.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah well dad, it’s my body this week so just don’t look at me naked alright? It feels weird. Hey, what time is it?”<br />
<br />
“7 o clock. I was wondering if you wanted breakfast. I’m making some.”<br />
<br />
“Geez, it’s so early…I want to sleep in a little more.”<br />
<br />
“Wow. I guess I just have your energy and biological clock and vice versa now. I’ll have to remember that. Just come in when you’re ready.”<br />
<br />
Aaron’s dad Jake closed the door behind him and Aaron stretched out on the bed, touching his huge muscles. God, he felt so horny all the time! All he could think of was having sex. Every day that went by it was getting harder and harder not to think of him finding another adult he could get naked with and FUCK. FUCK! FUCK! He stroked his cock and soon he was furiously masturbating. He thought of all the good looking guys at work. And some hot chicks, too. Altogether he masturbated three times before he was able to get up and take a shower. He looked at himself in the mirror and prepared to shave when a thought occurred to him. <br />
<br />
I bet I can grow a beard all by myself now!’ he thought. He smiled as he felt his stubble, which he was very proud of, and did several muscle poses. He had just learned he could make his pecs dance, so he did that both with and without a shirt. Aaron was becoming obsessed with how good he looked in his dad’s body.<br />
<br />
He stumbled into the kitchen only to watch a frustrated Jake trying to make pancakes. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, son. I don’t know what’s wrong with me today.” Aaron looked at all the failed pancakes, mushy piles of goo collecting on a plate. <br />
<br />
“Here, you better let me handle this. I can make some up in no time.” Jake weakly protested but Aaron shooshed him by assuring he could make them faster. Jake felt emasculated by the fact his son was now twice as tall as him and could easily just push him out of the way and just...take over. But he was so hungry that he allowed it. He looked at Aaron enviously putting some eggs on the grill, bacon and sausage, and pancakes to boot! Why had it been so hard for him? Was the magic affecting his ability how to remember things he&#39;d learned in his old body? Soon a whole pancake breakfast had been whipped up. Father and son sat on the couch. Jake found himself really getting into the Saturday morning cartoons on cable…some of them were from the 90s and seemed to be pretty cool ones that he had missed after he had given up watching cartoons on Saturdays.<br />
<br />
Aaron laughed. “You like these, dad?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, some of them. I just haven’t watched cartoons in a while, I guess. So what do you want to do today?’<br />
<br />
Aaron scratched his stubble. “I thought maybe you could…me and you could go to the county fair? They’re here in town throughout the next week.”<br />
<br />
“Really?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, didn’t you read about it in the paper?”<br />
<br />
“I guess not. I’ve been really busy this week…haven’t had a chance to do much reading.”<br />
<br />
“Well we can’t get home by bus, so if we go then one of us has to drive.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no. You are not driving.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, dad! Just gimme a chance! I bet I&#39;m a super good driver. I bet I&#39;m super good as you, Dad! Look at me, I mean I&#39;m like totally adult sized now and I can drive easy! I&#39;m a way better driver than other kids my age would be. Cause like, I&#39;ve totally seen you do it and I paid attention! Pleeeease.” Aaron whined with his big man voice. To anyone that didn’t know their situation, it would have looked incredibly odd for such a huge muscular man to beg a little kid as Aaron kept doing. “I can practice in the parking lot.”<br />
<br />
‘You’re only in 6th grade. You could total the car, we could get insured,” Jake reasoned. &quot;There are a million reasons I should not consider this.&quot; <br />
<br />
“Yeah but I’m tall now! I can learn! I did a good job at your work for you! It&#39;s like the magic let me know all about your accounts and people&#39;s names and stuff. The magic is great! It&#39;s like totally helping me out to be more adult like you and stuff! Come on dad, what do you say? You can go on all the rides and…and eat cotton candy. You could be the kid who gets to have all the fun and I could pretend to be the Dad and like, I could do all the stuff you did for me last year. And..and...and I could even carry you on my shoulders!”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not a little boy. I am not going to enjoy it like you would.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh. Bet you would. Bet you&#39;d feel just like a kid again. I mean, why don&#39;t you take advantage of being me? You could go to the park tomorrow and play with other kids! And you could like, have SO much fun as a kid with all the games and rides! Your brain is like my brain now so you&#39;re like, you&#39;re gonna have so much fun and I&#39;ll be stuck thinkin about going into work on Monday!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh. Boy, cotton candy sure does sound good for some reason.” Jake’s mouth watered mysteriously all the time now at the mere mention of sugar.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t forget funnel cake and garlic fries,&quot; Aaron said, bending his knees so he could look at his dad at face level. He put his hands on his knees and whispered conspiratorially. &quot;I have to be on your diet, cause you said no sweets for me. But you&#39;re just a kid and you can still have em and you can stuff your face as much as you want! And it will be so much fun! We didn’t get to go to the cabin in the woods. Come ON. When ELSE am I gonna get the chance to DRIVE, Dad?”<br />
<br />
“When you&#39;re 16. Look...if I agreed to this, we would go back at the slightest hint of trouble. You have to convince me that you’ll be able to make it out okay. We may have to spend most of today training you and then tomorrow go to this thing.”<br />
<br />
Aaron did a dance in his dad’s body and accidentally knocked over an end table that went crashing over. “Man, sorry dad! I still have to watch things…I’m not used to being so big!”<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Outside of their apartment building, father and son had gotten dressed and Aaron slid into the driver’s seat for the very first time. He felt the awe of it and smiled with glee. He was overwhelmed by how cool this was. If only his friends could see him!<br />
<br />
&quot;This is awesome! I&#39;m the adult and you can pretend to be my son! This is so great! I&#39;ll do a totally for real very very good job of being the dad while I&#39;m in your body, I promise, Dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron..you&#39;re not my Dad. I have a dad. i&#39;m not going to call you that,&quot; Jake insisted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on. It&#39;s just for fun,&quot; Aaron reasoned. &quot;If you call me Aaron while we&#39;re there and someone you know is nearby-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would never happen. There are going to be too many people.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Still...if you DID call me Dad, it would make me super happy. Pleeeeease? Call me Dad. Just once!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to learn to drive or NOT?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Dad. Jeez, I&#39;m just trying to enjoy it. It was like, totally scary going to your job. I didn&#39;t know anything about it and then when I got there it was like I had all this knowledge. So maybe it&#39;ll work again!&quot; <br />
<br />
Over the next hour, Aaron&#39;s father told him what everything was and how it worked. And they went over things like what lines you had to stay inside on the road. Slowly, he was allowed to back up out of the parking overhang. The parking lot was right next door to the apartment complex and before he knew it, Aaron was turning circles and stopping and making turns all by himself! He felt so powerful being the driver. He was doing a GREAT job so far! He could do this just as good as Dad ever could! A look of worry and concern filled his father’s voice.<br />
<br />
“What is it, dad? What’s wrong? Aren’t I doing okay?”<br />
<br />
“N-no…I’m just a little shocked is all. You’re picking things up literally right away. Usually it takes weeks or even months to get to the point you’re reaching. I mean, this is really smooth work.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, thanks! So can I drive us to the fair now. I&#39;ll just use my turn signal here...”<br />
<br />
“I…I don’t know. How about we do a test run around the block first.” Jake watched intently as his son drove in his place. He drove around the whole block paying attention to traffic signals and doing everything correctly. For Aaron, it was like remembering things he&#39;d forgotten. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, it&#39;s like I&#39;ve done this for years. I think it&#39;s working, Dad! I think I know how to drive just as good as you can. It&#39;s like my adult brain lets me know everything I need to! Isn&#39;t this cool, Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
“Well…geez this is amazing. You…you are a good driver. I can&#39;t believe the magic is working like this. How is this possible? I didn&#39;t experience this when I swapped with my Dad.”<br />
<br />
“Honestly, dad…I think it’s like…being in your body is like that scene in the Matrix where the guy knows how to do kung fu and stuff. Like, I knew how to use the gym machines, and I knew how to do your job and I know how to talk to grownups at your school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At your school,&quot; Jake corrected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, the magic is helping me! It&#39;s a good thing,&quot; Aaron said, as he got on the highway. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh, are you sure?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Dad. I got this. Watch,&quot; Aaron said, confidently. He eased his way onto the highway. Jake was transfixed. He saw Aaron navigating with his turn signal and his mirror and he felt a mixture of pride and fear as he learned his little boy was just a good a driver as himself. What&#39;s more...he was forgetting how to do some of the things Aaron was doing. He had forgotten how to even make the turn signal go on. Jake was ashamed and he couldn&#39;t tell Aaron that. It was suddenly frightening to him. <br />
<br />
“Isn&#39;t this great? I&#39;m a good driver. Hey, I can drive to work on Monday now! Or I can drive us to the grocery store. I can drive us anywhere. I&#39;ll take you to the park or the beach. Just let me know, Dad, and I&#39;ll drive us there, okay? But for today, let’s go have ourselves a great time at the county fair, whoooooo!”<br />
<br />
On the road, Aaron sometimes felt the need to drape his arm out the window when he was stopped at a light…people had a tendency to want to check him out and he was getting used to smiling back. He loved the attention but dad didn’t seem to notice. He chuckled. <br />
<br />
“Man, how much longer until we’re there?” Jake asked, sounding very much like a pre-pubescent kid.<br />
<br />
“We’ll get there soon…you know where it is Dad, it takes at least 45 minutes to get out there.”<br />
<br />
“Oh right. Of course. Maybe I should check the map anyway to make sure we know where to park.” Jake opened the glove compartment. A cigar rolled out. Without even thinking about it Aaron took it and while was driving chewed off the end and spit it out the window and propped it in his mouth. He reached over for the lighter that was also there when his dad said in a pipsqueak voice “wha-what are you doing?” <br />
<br />
Aaron pulled over so he could light his cigar. “Sorry, dad,” he said sexily while his mouth was full of stogie “I shouldn’t try to light this while driving.”<br />
<br />
“No that’s…YOU DON’T SMOKE!”<br />
<br />
“Dad, I’m in your body now so it’s okay. You smoke these things. Look, don&#39;t freak out. I would never do this in my body but I&#39;m in your body and you&#39;re a grown up man. You can smoke cigars whenever you want, Dad. But I have to go back to being a kid in a few days so I&#39;ll never be able to smoke again until I&#39;m like 18.”<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s taking things a bit far, Aaron. You can&#39;t just do whatever you want with that body!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU smoke cigars, Dad. How often do YOU smoke, by the way?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That...that isn&#39;t important!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Aaron reasoned with him. &quot;I mean, I have nicotine in me and this body knows that it likes cigars. I had on the other night and-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU SMOKED A CIGAR?! Without telling me or asking permission first??&quot; Jake said, sounding like a little kid freaking out over nothing. Making a mountain out of a molehill. Aaron rolled his eyes in a very dismissive way. He didn&#39;t really want to deal with this drama. He was feeling too good to have his day ruined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you ever ask me if YOU could smoke a cigar?&quot; Aaron asked his dad, who mumbled something. &quot;Exactly, Dad. Now look, if I&#39;m going to take you to the fair, I want you on your best behavior, young man.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha. Very funny.&quot; <br />
<br />
Aaron sighed. &quot;I mean, I wasn&#39;t exactly kidding, Dad. I want you to respect me. I&#39;m going out of my way here to make sure that you enjoy the experience of being a child again. I want us both to enjoy this. Did you ever think that we should try to make the best of it? Not just hide in our apartment but really see the world through each other&#39;s eyes? I want to do that with you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but...I&#39;m the adult here, really.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So am I. I mean...I know that, Dad. Of course you are!&quot; Aaron gesticulated, holding the cigar in his fingers. He looked so big and adult and important. His voice carried so much MORE authority than Jake&#39;s now. His words sounded a lot more reasonable and logical than they did from the previous week before this swap nonsense had to happen. It disturbed Jake. He was the adult with the adult thinking and yet...he was coming across as just...childish. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just I am the adult, though!&quot; he complained, flailing his arms apart in a pouty way and he turned his head away, then crossed his arms in a huffy, little kid way. He wasn&#39;t getting his way and it was so unfair! He wanted to be the big adult again!  <br />
<br />
“Yeah but now I’M the adult! Why is that so hard for you? It&#39;s just for a couple of days!&quot; Aaron was exasperated. This whole having Dad be the kid again thing was getting annoying. Why was Dad being so unreasonable? &quot;We both know that you&#39;re the Dad who&#39;s going to be in charge again. So answer my question. How often do you normally smoke cigars?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...I...didn&#39;t ever tell you this but I smoke a few times a week. Usually my pipe, though. I&#39;m an avid fan of Montecristo, Gurkha, Romeo y Julieta, Partagas...god I miss smoking so much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad. Listen to yourself. I&#39;m in this big body that is so used to smoking tobacco that I naturally just wanted to try some for myself. And it makes me happy. And now I know what it&#39;s like, so when I&#39;m me again I&#39;ll wait until I&#39;m 18 to try it again. But for now, just let me have this. I&#39;m not doing anything inappropriate. Everyone who sees me sees a grown man who can make decisions for myself. And you would be helping yourself because I&#39;ll be happy smoking it. Aren&#39;t you in a good mood when you smoke one?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...yes, but...okay but you are NOT going to smoke when we&#39;re back in each other&#39;s bodies.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Deal, Dad.&quot; Aaron shook his dad&#39;s puny little hand. God, his arm is like, so tiny compared with mine now. I have to be careful not to snap it or something! And my hands! My hands are SO much bigger than Dad&#39;s! He has the tiniest little hands and I have huge ones! More than big enough for this steering wheel, haha! <br />
<br />
 Aaron brought his new lighter up and puffed contentedly as he drew smoke from the beautiful smelling cigar, and Jake smelled the heavenly aroma as it filled the car.<br />
<br />
“Look, it’s just a very grown up thing to do and…you really did do this before?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I did it last night. I just…wanted to know what it was like. Come on, don’t be sore with me.” Aaron said, not sounding to worried. Chomping his cigar he felt like such an adult that his cock grew hard. He started up the car again and pulled onto the highway again. <br />
<br />
“Well, even though you shouldn&#39;t get used to it, I guess I am sort of proud of you. At least it&#39;s a very manly thing to do and quite frankly, men that smoke them are seen as...masculine.”<br />
<br />
“You want me to act like you, see!” Aaron said, convincingly. &quot;I&#39;m just convincing people I&#39;m like YOU, Dad!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. That&#39;s...that&#39;s good. No, you&#39;re right. It&#39;s good that you&#39;re acting manly like me. I&#39;m proud of you, son.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Better not call me son in front of anyone, though. Call me DAD cause that&#39;s my name now, hahahaha!&quot; Aaron smiled broadly as he chomped his stogie. Jake threw him a look which he ignored. <br />
<br />
Jake was uneasy with the way Aaron was taking this, but at least he was being a good, if not phenomenal driver. Jake was fairly happy with that and to a certain extent proud of how well his son really was handling being an adult. But at the same time he didn’t want Aaron getting too ahead of himself or cocky. He was still just a little boy deep down inside and not an experienced adult like him. He didn’t know about the ways of the world yet, not really. And smelling the potency of that cigar was making him fairly dizzy…he really wanted to be back in his own body! Cigar smoke never affected him like this. It was harder to take into his little lungs, even secondhand. Looking up at his own body was also sometimes disorientating. He caught himself daydreaming of Aaron as being an adult sometimes and that was just something he couldn’t do. He had to be very careful not to treat Aaron like TOO MUCH of an adult because then he would get used to it. But in a public place he might have to if it were required. Why had he ever agreed to this in the first place? It was madness! He shouldn&#39;t be doing this. He wanted to go back! Why couldn&#39;t he be a bigshot corporate business type guy and sell stuff with gym equipment and be like, big and important and help with accounts and things? Like that one dude with the gray hair. What was his name? Who did Dad work with? <br />
<br />
He stopped himself. No no no no! He&#39;s not the dad! I&#39;m the dad! Me! I am the ADULT and AARON is the little boy! I&#39;m in charge, not him! <br />
<br />
“Alright dad, I think we’re here,” Aaron said, chomping his cigar which had burned down quite a bit. <br />
<br />
“Wow, cool! I can hardly wait!” Jake said, surprising himself by how childish he sounded. “I mean…that’s good. Good job with the driving there, big guy.” Aaron&#39;s smile was infectious in how much pride shone through. Jake couldn&#39;t help but smile at how happy he had made his son. <br />
<br />
Inside the county fair were all sorts of rides and attractions. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, son. I&#39;ll just pay for some tickets for us!&quot; Aaron announced. He put the stub of the cigar in his mouth and paid over bills out of his dad&#39;s wallet, which HE got to carry around now. With his new tall legs, Aaron was on top of the world. He was taller and bigger and more muscular than most OTHER dads. Heh. I&#39;m a dad now! I&#39;m a dad and my dad can&#39;t tell me what to do. I bet he couldn&#39;t stop me from doing something he wanted to do even if he wanted to! <br />
<br />
Jake gratefully took the tickets his new &quot;Dad&quot; gave to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks...Dad.&quot; Aaron smiled and put a warm hand on his tiny dad&#39;s shoulders and rubbed them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...you called me-!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know. If it means so much to you, then fine. It&#39;s just an experiment. We aren&#39;t going to keep doing this.&quot; <br />
<br />
Aaron took his cigar out. He&#39;d almost smoked it down to the end. He ground it into the dirt near a garbage can and tossed it inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, KIDDO! Let&#39;s go have the best fun ever! You ready, SON?&quot; Aaron was giddy. His dad was going along with it! He felt so grown up! This was great! He felt his big muscles heaving as he walked. This was great. He couldn&#39;t WAIT until he was older and he got to be a dad himself! He hated the idea of going back and being a kid now. He just wanted to make sure Dad had the full kid experience!<br />
<br />
Jake and Aaron spent several hours the way they normally would at a carnival. Only Aaron was the one that took the strength test this time. He was so excited…last time he could barely lift the hammer! He slammed it down and sent the bell all the way to the top! A few people clapped and Aaron smiled deliriously. I&#39;m soooooo strong now! I could NEVER do that before! he thought. <br />
<br />
Some rides though, dad couldn’t go on because he was too short. But he let Aaron go on them alone because he had always wanted to go on them. Aaron was giddy about that and afterwards the two made jokes about it being just like Big with Tom Hanks, only in reverse.<br />
<br />
“You want something to drink, dad?” Aaron said as sunset arrived.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I could go for a beer right now.” Both man and boy smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, SON. Beer is for daddies like me!&quot; <br />
<br />
“I’ll take a lemonade. I&#39;ve been craving one all day! I never crave sugar like this.&quot; Jake told him. <br />
<br />
Aaron went over to the stand (it was so cool that he was the one with the wallet now and got to pay for everything.) and brought his dad back a lemonade and a beer for himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were kidding!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, SON.&quot; Aaron was really having fun calling his dad &#39;son&#39;. In fact, it was even giving him a boner for some reason!  &quot;It&#39;s just one beer. You drink beer, don&#39;t you?&quot; <br />
<br />
“I do but...you can&#39;t drink more than just that one.  You’re driving tonight, after all.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, SON. I’ll just have this one.” Aaron drank the beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;That tastes...awesome. Way better than sugar. You want some?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I do, actually! But...we&#39;re in public!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right. Maybe I&#39;ll let you have a beer when we&#39;re at home tomorrow,&quot; Aaron whispered into his dad&#39;s ear, bending down so the little guy could hear him. <br />
<br />
Jake was so excited by that. Beer? Me! Wow, he&#39;s going to let me drink BEER? That&#39;s so cool! <br />
<br />
Wait, why is that so cool? I&#39;ve had beer so many times. I am a grown up. I&#39;ve had beer before! I can&#39;t...remember what it tastes like, though. And dad&#39;s beer smelled so gross! Jake wasn&#39;t sure he even wanted any! <br />
<br />
Dad? No, he&#39;s not the dad. I&#39;m just confused. It&#39;s because I&#39;m in this body. This nightmare will all be over with soon, so it&#39;s okay. <br />
<br />
After they were finished with their drinks, Jake wanted to go shoot at the fake rifle range so Aaron gave his dad some money. While he was waiting, a nice lady, who was pretty hot noticed his huge sweaty muscles. They started talking and before Aaron knew what he was doing he was giving her his cel phone number (well dad’s anyway) and she was saying how sweet he was and not like a lot of arrogant guys she met. He liked to talk about real things, like how much he loved his son and wanted him to have a great time today. Aaron blushed as she felt his arm and said they should get together soon. Aaron said they would. <br />
<br />
“How about tonight?” Jennifer asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah…yeah I could do that after uh...my son...um...Aaron goes to bed.”<br />
<br />
“Would that really be okay? I mean...I know I just met you, but...I feel like we have a connection.&quot; She was speaking to him in a weird tone. He felt his cock throb. Aaron nodded happily. <br />
<br />
“I’ll call you later. Uh…do you want to hang out with me and my son for a while?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, let me just go to the bathroom first.”<br />
<br />
Jake was pretty tired so Aaron decided to lift him up with his now big strong muscles. He&#39;d been wanting to do this all day! Jake couldn’t believe it. Aaron actually placed him on his shoulders. It had been decades since anyone had done that. <br />
<br />
“How’s that feel, SON?”<br />
<br />
“Wow! Thanks,” Jake said, feeling a mixture of bewilderment and elation. His son’s back and shoulders were so immense and strong! He was beyond impressed, so much so that it was easy to forget he had been the one who had inhabited that big ol&#39; body he was now riding on top of! It wasn’t hard for Aaron to carry Jake at all! It was amazing! Jake had forgotten what it was like to be tall in the few days he had been small. It felt like a relief to look down on other grown ups again!  But when Aaron put him down after a while, he felt a brief, sharp sense of disappointment at having to look up at all the grown ups once more. Before he knew it some woman was talking to his son. He had told Aaron not to talk to strangers! But then Aaron introduced them. It turns out he met this woman just earlier. <br />
<br />
So he decided to be nice and cordial and play the part. He didn’t appreciate this. He was constantly and increasingly calling Aaron “Dad” by habit after about three hours passed. And Aaron kept referring to him as “son”. It was embarrassing and sort of degrading that this was happening in front of another person. Aaron was ignoring his former dad. He talked with Jennifer about things Jake didn&#39;t understand. Why were they talking about real estate? Why did Aaron know about real estate? How boring! And now they were talking about how Jennifer had all these nephews and nieces but no kids of her own, but she always wanted them. They were talking and talking. Aaron absentmindedly handed his dad some bills to go get food or do some games. He was so taken with Jennifer! She needs to leave! he thought. Jake was beginning to get into a bad mood. This day is for DAD and me not some lame girl! <br />
<br />
No...what am I thinking?? He&#39;s not the dad. I am. And it&#39;s not like he&#39;s going to do anything with a grown up woman or anything. Why am I even allowing this? Because if I say anything, it will be rude and I&#39;m just a little boy. I&#39;m not allowed to be rude to grown ups so I can&#39;t blow my cover. I have to go along with this. It&#39;s not like I can drive myself home and I don&#39;t want to get into an argument with Dad. NO! Not dad! Why do I keep thinking that?? He&#39;s not my dad, I&#39;m the dad. I&#39;m the ONLY dad here! <br />
<br />
Finally they were ready to leave. Jake was pretty tired. <br />
<br />
“Did you have a good time, son?” Aaron asked when they were in the car.<br />
<br />
“I…I’m your dad, Aaron!”<br />
<br />
“OH RIGHT!” Aaron laughed. &quot;Dad, thank you so much for letting me call you &#39;son&#39; for all of today. That made me feel so cool!&quot; <br />
<br />
“Yeah I know. So that woman was really into you.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Jennifer is really nice, Dad. She&#39;s my new friend.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well, let’s just get home. I’m about to fall asleep.”<br />
<br />
“Dad, it’s only like 9 o clock.”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh.”<br />
<br />
Jake dazed in the car as Aaron drove, not worrying a bit about his eleven year old son driving around town in a big body. For some reason he just didn’t feel like worrying about it anymore. Before he knew it they were home. He rubbed his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Man, you must be wiped out, son. C’mon, let’s get you upstairs.”<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not your son,&quot; Jake mumbled. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know. It&#39;s just fun for me to say, remember? Today I was the Dad that loved his son with all his heart, just like you&#39;ve done with me.&quot; Aaron bent down and kissed Jake on the cheek and smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ew, gross,&quot; Jake said. Aaron laughed, in a mature way that reminded Jake of something. Some in joke he no longer remembered. <br />
<br />
In truth, Aaron felt proud of calling the little guy &#39;son&#39; and it seemed to weird to call him &#39;Dad&#39;. I mean, since when does any grown up call a kid &quot;dad&quot;? It should be this way until we swap back, Aaron thought.<br />
<br />
Aaron locked the car with his electronic key. Jake didn&#39;t even show me how to use these, he thought. Cool! I know how to use so many things now! <br />
<br />
They got up and Jake went to bed and was asleep in no time. Aaron got on his cel phone and called Jennifer. Before he knew it she was knocking at the door. He nervously opened it.<br />
<br />
They talked and watched some TV. Aaron knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to score. Being in this body was driving him crazy. And then, before he knew it, she had her hand on his leg. If only the kids at school could see him now! He was starting to get flustered, which Jennifer thought was real cute. He was breathing a little fast. He was only a boy! He&#39;d never done any sex stuff with another adult before! <br />
<br />
He smiled and not knowing what to do looked down and then started lightly rubbing her arm. Then reached over and kissed her…a grown up woman with boobs! He picked her up in his arms and carried her into his bedroom and shut the door.<br />
<br />
She took off her clothes and he was so, so much bigger than she was. He knew just what to do, though. He&#39;d experimented with some women in college. It hadn&#39;t been his thing, though. He kept picturing jocks. But Aaron was into girls. His dad was the gay one. Wait...I never went to college! I have dad&#39;s memories now?? But he was SO horny and his dick was SO hard that he didn&#39;t care whose body he was in. He reached for the extra large condoms he kept in the dresser. He took off his shirt. Jennifer was enraptured with his muscular, bodybuilder physique. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, you&#39;re huge! Look at you!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I am huge. Huge everywhere!&quot; <br />
<br />
His dick flopped out and he proudly shucked his pants off. Jennifer made a little &quot;o&quot; with her tiny mouth. <br />
<br />
He rolled the condom on expertly, something he had never done before but it felt like a thousand times. Nothing special. He was ready to FUCK! He lubed himself up. <br />
<br />
Sliding into her felt amazing. He took her stringbean legs up in the air and she moaned and moaned as he plowed her, and before he knew it he was fucking in a rhythm that brought them both such extreme pleasure....<br />
<br />
But his senses were overwhelmed. He was picturing the guys from work. He was picturing how hot they were. Jennifer was hot but nowhere near as hot as a guy! His interest in girls had faded after his freshman year of college. They&#39;d been okay. Jennifer was nice and it was SO hot that she wanted him and his giant muscles! That turned him on. It turned him on to be SO much bigger than her and SO much more powerful. He could pick her up and fuck her! <br />
<br />
So he did. He carried her standing up, impaling her on his huge dick. Aaron was more turned on by his own body and his reflection in the mirror on the all than he was with this chick! He stared at himself. <br />
<br />
I&#39;m so hot. Italian good looks, tan skin, sexy stubble, slicked black hair. I look like a fucking porn star! I&#39;m a fucking muscle god! I&#39;m the fucking DAD now! I&#39;m the adult! I&#39;m the adult! I&#39;m the dad! I&#39;m the grown up! I&#39;m a fucking bodybuilder! I&#39;m a muscle stud! For every one of these thoughts, he pummeled her, getting more and more turned on. She moaned in absolute bliss. No one, she told him afterwards, had ever ever fucked her like that before in her life. <br />
<br />
Sunday morning, Aaron woke up and had never felt better. Last night he had learned how to use a condom and fuck. He thought about the word. Fuck. He had fucked. Fucked a grown woman. He was now a total adult in every way, he thought. He had become a MAN. This woman he had fucked and overpowered and he had taken her body to new heights of pleasure with his fuckstick. His dick was 8 inches long and THICK, too! He smiled. I&#39;m amazing. My body is amazing. Everyone is gonna want to be fucked by a stud like me! Especially the hot guy from Morph Corp. I should fuck him!! he thought eagerly. There were so many guys he wanted to fuck now. He wanted the experience with Jennifer. It made him feel grown up and attractive and it was hot, but more because he got to lose his virginity. He didn&#39;t exactly feel like doing it with a woman anytime soon. He just wanted to try everything like his dad had. He didn&#39;t have all his dad&#39;s memories. He was just slowly becoming more mature and adult, he realized. He was giddy over the feelings that this left him. <br />
<br />
What was going to happen when they swapped back? he wondered. I can&#39;t...I&#39;m not sure I can go back after this! Maybe I can convince Jake to stay like this a little while longer. <br />
<br />
He crept to the door with Jennifer and fondled her ass a little before she left and gave her a long good bye kiss. He shut the door and turned around to see his dad standing there in shock.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Oh. Um. Hey there, son!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I am NOT your son! And you...did you do something with her? In MY body?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, sort of?&quot;<br />
<br />
“Aaron…that woman…we saw her yesterday. What were you doing with her?”<br />
<br />
“It’s called kissing, Dad.”<br />
<br />
“Aaron..she she was a stranger.”<br />
<br />
“Hahaha! Dad, come on. You tell little kids to worry about strangers. I&#39;m like, a grown up now? So I don&#39;t have to worry about it. And she&#39;s not a stranger anymore! We’re like, friends now, Dad.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my God. OH MY GOD.”<br />
<br />
“Dad, what is it?”<br />
<br />
“Aaron…did you do anything with her other than kissing?”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean, Dad?” Aaron tried to play coy and pretend he didn&#39;t know what Jake was talking about. <br />
<br />
“I mean…you know. Did you…did you two take your clothes off and do grown up things?”<br />
<br />
“You mean did we have sex and fuck?&quot; Aaron was suddenly feeling really good about himself.  &quot;Yeah! We did! I wanted to know what it was like, okay? And I&#39;m you now, so it&#39;s all good. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to date her or anything. I just wanted to see what it was like.” Aaron grinned broadly. “You proud of me, Dad? She was really nice and so hot. I mean, for a girl. Now I’m a real grown up, just like you!”<br />
<br />
“No…no this can’t be happening. Oh, man. What have I done?”<br />
<br />
“Jake, are you mad?”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t you dare call me by your first name! Enough of this nonsense. Call me Dad or nothing. Aaron, I’m getting my body back in a few days. You cannot get used to this. You are a child. You should NEVER have had sex in my body without permission!”<br />
<br />
&quot;Easier said than done, Jake. I mean, son. I mean...look, it would be easier to call you Jake than Dad. I mean you&#39;re so tiny now. It feels like I&#39;m the dad. It feels wrong to call you Dad now. I&#39;m so tall and huge-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron, I am the adult in this room! I know it looks like I&#39;m a little pipsqueak but I&#39;ve been around a lot longer than you! You should NOT have sex at your age and I&#39;m very disappointed in you. When I had the sex talk with you last year, I thought we made it very clear you were NOT to have sex until you were at least 16, and that was only after I was convinced you could handle yourself in a relationship maturely. You had sex with a total stranger.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So? I mean, I got to know her and we spent hours talking together so it&#39;s not like we were strangers. It&#39;s like we were on one big date. She doesn&#39;t get out much. She takes care of her mother-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;i don&#39;t want to hear it. You should NOT be having sex. You are NOT a real adult,&quot; Jake said. Aaron rolled his eyes. Aaron was starting to get irritated. <br />
<br />
“So? I feel like an adult. I act like an adult. Well, most of the time. It&#39;s getting more and more easy for me to be like you, Jake.”<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re not gonna call me Dad like I asked you to?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just easier, I think. Given that I&#39;m big now,&quot; Aaron reasoned, although it was a stretch. He could be more respectful but dad wasn&#39;t respecting him very much right now, so what did he care? <br />
<br />
“So that woman is gonna think that I want to be with her. And YOU! You are just a child. A child!”<br />
<br />
Aaron flexed his biceps and looked at his father with a doubtful look. “I dunno, Dad. Does a child have 20 inch biceps? I mean…ever since we switched bodies I feel like this body had a mind of its own. You have to admit. I&#39;m confident now. I&#39;m not me anymore. I think. But I&#39;m not you either. It&#39;s like...I&#39;ve become the grown up version of me in your body. I don&#39;t feel like a kid. I mean I do sometimes but then it goes away. It&#39;s like the magic is forcing that part of me out and I feel more and more comfortable in this body and with other adults. And it&#39;s fucking awesome!&quot; Aaron exclaimed, spreading his hands out in the air. <br />
<br />
“I don’t believe this.”<br />
<br />
“It’s just sex, Dad. Look, if it makes you feel any better I won’t have sex while you’re in the house from now on.”<br />
<br />
“From now ON? You won’t have sex at all, not if I have anything to say about it!”<br />
<br />
“Dad, she is a nice lady. She’s pretty. I just want to do everything that an adult does while I am one…I don’t want to go back to being a kid but I have to anyway. So I figure why not enjoy it? I’m gonna be back to being me soon. But now I know what sex is like…and it’s awesome! NONE of the other kids in my class have had sex like me.” Aaron grinned proudly.<br />
<br />
“That woman is gonna think that I want to date her. Women aren&#39;t like gay men. They are far more emotional and they get attached. You don&#39;t know everything. I still know some stuff.&quot; Aaron looked amused and crossed his arms. As if to say &quot;this is gonna be good.&quot; He was really not even pretending to have much respect for his dad&#39;s status as a father figure. Jake picked up on it. &quot;Okay…look…just promise me you won’t do anything else with her. This is only for a few more days and then we go back to normal. I guess I can tell her something when I&#39;m back in my body. Just don&#39;t have any more contact with her.”<br />
<br />
After this Jake had a long talk with Aaron to make sure he understood about how to have sex safely. Aaron finally relented that he wouldn’t have sex again until he was in his own body and grown up for reals. He exhaled in an annoyed way. He was getting fed up with this conversation. &quot;Fine. Look, let&#39;s just move on from this,&quot; Aaron said sternly. Then he changed his tone. He was shocked how authoritative he had sounded just now. Jake had picked up on it, but didn&#39;t say anything. &quot;I promise, Dad. Extra super swear. I won&#39;t have sex again. Are you happy now?”<br />
<br />
Jake sighed. “Yeah. Super happy. This whole experience is just a barrel of laughs for me. Okay. Let’s just grab some breakfast.”<br />
<br />
“Great. What would you like me to make?”<br />
<br />
“I thought I would make some eggs.”<br />
<br />
Once again though, things didn’t go like Jake planned and his omelet got burnt. Aaron once again took over and confidently stepped in with an arrogant smirk. He took the spatula. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, SON. I&#39;ll take it from here,&quot; Aaron said, and with a swagger to his step, he proceeded to dance around the kitchen. He took his shirt off and flexed as he worked. He turned on some tunes and bopped his head, thinking about how hot it would be if he could fuck some dudes. Bring up some boys to fuck. Yeah. That&#39;s what he needed. Some BOY ASS. Jake would never have to know about it. Maybe he could do it real late after little Jake went to sleep. <br />
<br />
Before he knew it, Jake&#39;s new &quot;dad&quot; had made another excellent meal. Jake couldn’t wait until all this weirdness was over. At least it was Sunday. Nothing could go wrong on a Sunday…could it?</p>
