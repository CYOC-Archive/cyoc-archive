<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And this is the vial of the spiked punch,&quot; Jason spoke as he handed the vial to Megumi&#39;s father, Gorou Tachibana, &quot;Hopefully this puts Decrux behind bars for good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is more for the law to decide,&quot; Gorou said slowly to the young weretiger, who in his fursona towered over him. Of course, as a werefox, Gorou also knew that even if he transformed he&#39;d be well shorter than a fully grown weretiger. Now, while Jason wasn&#39;t fully grown, the fact that tigers were larger than foxes was still fairly obvious. &quot;And she has managed to skirt the worst in the past...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason slowly nodded. It was a fairly frustrating thing for many in Moon Lake, as weres of all kinds, regardless of whether or not they&#39;d been born weres tried hard to show that they weren&#39;t the stereotypical monsters depicted in movies. Did it happen from time to time? Sure, but it was rather rare, and when it did happen it was a sad and frustrating thing. He remembered his father being rather angry over the previous rogue were scare with Yvette Smith going after a college professor and taking Moon Lake to the point where a WERE Alert might have been issued with a general call to all of Moon Lake&#39;s weres to actually hunt the rogue with direction from the Moon Lake PD. His dad had been at a point where Jason figured that if that hunt had been called that Yvette Smith probably wouldn&#39;t have lived if his father caught him.<br />
<br />
But Yvette Smith was caught before that alert and hunt were to be called and the situation passed. But then came this new incident relating to Alice Decrux, right on the heals of the previous one. The fight that Ms. McCoy got into that resulted in Melissa&#39;s father becoming a weretiger had the real potential to be embarrassing for Moon Lake&#39;s weretigers, just as the Skulk held Yvette Smith&#39;s actions as embarrassing, and were it not for Decrux&#39;s involvement in the fight, Jason figured his own family might have had some anger at Ms. McCoy. Decrux&#39;s involvement only added to some frustration as Decrux had a history that seemed to flirt causing trouble that Moon Lake was well aware of, and thus the potential that Decrux had started it was very real. Jason figured that his parents would be pleased to hear that Melissa&#39;s father was adapting quite well to being a weretiger and seemed quite happy with Ms. McCoy, though Decrux causing further trouble might offset that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, hopefully she goes away for quite a long time,&quot; Jason spoke and then looked over to Megumi who stood beside her father, &quot;Do you need Alice and I for anything more, Megumi?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, my friends,&quot; Megumi gave a small smile, &quot;you&#39;ve been of great help in making sure a bad situation doesn&#39;t get any worse. Thank you. My father and I can wait for the policeman to return to give him the tainted punch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason nodded and looked over to Alice, with her Lapine ears raised and her nose twitching with each breath and her lips pulled to a small smile as well. They wished Megumi a good night and then slowly made their way back through the building and out the back of the school. Both Jason and Alice lived on the streets that went along either side of the high school, though with Moon Lake&#39;s layout more like a wagon wheel and with forest between each street, it had meant that there were plenty of trees between their houses, though it had also provided both with plenty of cover for fun. And that was on their minds as Alice lead Jason into the woods behind the school.<br />
<br />
The sounds of various weres enjoying themselves were much less prevalent now, though the dance was nearly over and many probably left after the pursuit to rescue Melissa while she&#39;d been under the influence of Love Potion Number Nine. Though Alice could hear some aroused moans coming from a few directions and she made sure to avoid them and hope that not too far in the future she and Jason  would be having similar fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man... what a night,&quot; Jason said from behind her and feeling his penis begin to tent the front of his costume. It had been specially built to fit around his weretiger form, but that didn&#39;t mean it&#39;d be able to hide his arousal. He also caught some scent from Alice that indicated she was growing slightly aroused as well, possibly thinking on what was to come. &quot;I can&#39;t believe that anyone would be so... stupid... as to pull a prank like this for any reason. I mean... the drug was watered down... but Melissa was pretty out of it when we caught up to her and practically threw herself at Trevor after we arrived...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... what Decrux did was stupid,&quot; Alice nodded, catching the scent of Jason&#39;s growing arousal, &quot;had it been stronger or more potent... the response could have well triggered an orgy and potentially had a lot of Statute 1A violations. Not everyone in Moon Lake is a were, after all... and WE would have had to deal with it... But thankfully we got lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jason agreed as he ducked under a tree branch as Alice lead him through the woods with fallen leaves from earlier years crackling under their pawed feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you said that Trevor was calm and polite with Melissa... right?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... though as I said... it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if Melissa is a werecow by Monday,&quot; Jason nodded, &quot;it&#39;s pretty obvious that she likes him and he made it very obvious that he likes her when he stormed out to her rescue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A very loving relationship,&quot; Alice smiled and glanced back to Jason as they reached a spot in the woods where she and Jason had had plenty of their own private rendezvous in the past.<br />
<br />
In a private way, Alice was actually a bit jealous of Melissa and Trevor. She was happy that they were happy, but in a way, she wanted that same sort of loving feeling too, and with Jason in particular. It was why she playfully teased him as much as she did. In many ways Jason had been more than a friend, but a real hero as well. They&#39;d grown up together and one time in Middle School, after one of her practical jokes backfired and person she&#39;d pranked tried to get even, Jason had quite literally fought him off. Alice had felt a real attraction to him ever since, though her attempts to get Jason to see her in a way that went beyond &quot;friends with benefits&quot; hadn&#39;t worked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is,&quot; Jason nodded as he began to remove his costume as Alice turned. He couldn&#39;t see her happily smile at his muscled chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would you think about that?&quot; Alice asked as she began to slide out her costume, exposing her budding breasts and with her nipples poking out through her fur in expectation on what was to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s very good for Melissa and Trevor,&quot; Jason answered, &quot;She seems smart has really been thinking through with what kind of were she wants to be... more than some do... though many of them might have already had a good idea so it doesn&#39;t take much thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason pulled down his pants and managed to kick them off so that his costume lay on the ground in a lumped pile, but was close enough that he wouldn&#39;t lose them when he and Alice went their separate ways. Alice had done the same as she set the rest of her costume down in a spot that was opposite Jason&#39;s costume. She approached Jason with a small smile as he continued...<br />
<br />
&quot;And Trevor&#39;s always been a nice guy... and I&#39;d think he&#39;s actually NEEDED someone like Melissa,&quot; Jason commented, &quot;Someone who isn&#39;t going to simply look at him as a giant sex toy. He&#39;s more than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you,&quot; Alice told him and hopped up to give him a kiss on the cheek. He caught her as she hopped up and held her to him and happily hoped and fantasized of Jason truly claiming her as his mate. She couldn&#39;t help but moan a bit when she half lifted her up and bent his head down to lick at her erect nipples.  He then moved to lay her gently on the ground beneath him and she eagerly awaited getting his large barbed penis inside her as it would fit her hopes of Jason declaring his love for her and they could go from being just &quot;friends with benefits&quot; to an official couple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jason said simply, &quot;though after all the stress that Decrux put us through... I&#39;d think both of us could need this to blow off some steam.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice wanted to sigh at that. That wasn&#39;t the statement of love that she&#39;d hoped to get out of Jason. As the two of them had been close. He laughed at her jokes, including the pranks she&#39;d played on him. In fact it&#39;d become something of a tradition between them in that she would prank him in the hopes of him putting the fact that he had gotten so much attention from her as a sign that she loved him and saw him as more than just a friend and return those feelings in kind. After all... they couldn&#39;t stay &quot;friends with benefits&quot; forever. Sure, it&#39;d be fun, but Alice had hopes of growing up and having a family of her own, a son and a daughter, and to do that, she would prefer to be married to the father.<br />
<br />
However, she couldn&#39;t deny that Decrux&#39;s actions had added unwanted stress that would give everyone some need to unwind. And at the same time Jason&#39;s trail of licking kisses had reached her vagina and his rough feline tongue was enough to send Alice into an orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready when you are,&quot; Alice eventually managed as she spread her legs and wrapped them around Jason&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
Jason nodded and came forward, and licked her nipples again before slowing beginning to ease his erect shaft into her, with both of them giving a heavy moan as he did so. He had some hesitancy as he slowly thrust forward, and primarily due to the barbs at the base of his penis while in his were form. In nature with mundane cats, that feature of their anatomy was to help insure that any and all offspring would be sired by that male, even if it meant pulling any semen from a previous bout of mating out, and in cats this could actually be physically painful as these barbs would be digging into a female&#39;s most sensitive areas. He didn&#39;t want to hurt Alice that way, as she had been a good friend. Sure she&#39;d enjoyed practical jokes to a point where one might think she should have been born a werefox, but she was a good person and the pranks she pulled weren&#39;t harmful.<br />
<br />
In that, Jason figured that Alice would make someone very happy some day, and he didn&#39;t want to ruin that potential future for her by doing physical harm to her as he thrust his hips forward. He did like her and in the way that she wanted him to like her, and he did relish the fact that Alice had so frequently allowed for these sorts of &quot;friends with benefits&quot; sort of sessions was something he liked and loved, but he&#39;d never been able to admit that. Partially as he wasn&#39;t sure that Alice Weiss truly loved him in the same way. Sure, they were friends and she enjoyed pranking him, but then he also had to privately admit that he was pretty easy to prank as there had been plenty of times where he&#39;d left himself wide open to it. And in that sense it&#39;d make sense to prank him so often, as it was so easy. Because of that, he didn&#39;t want to do her any harm and the thought that she might want the same thing from him never occurred to him.<br />
<br />
And for Alice, while planned fantasy hadn&#39;t worked out in inspiring Jason to declare he loved her, she could feel her own passions burn as he thrust into her with pauses only to give him time to caress her breasts. At that point it felt too good for her to really care, and there would of course be another day. So she would have the time and opportunity to try again.</p>
