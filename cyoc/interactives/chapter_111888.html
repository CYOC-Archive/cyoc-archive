<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James was  silent for a while.<br />
<br />
He finally turned back to Kayla.<br />
<br />
&quot;I used to wish you had never turned me into a frog, but another way I wouldn&#39;t have met her. I do love her, Kayla!&quot;he avowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fucked up, just sayin&#39;, dude!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kayla, will you do me a favour?&quot; James begged very strong of his words. She nodded a bit reluctant. James stuffed his hand inside his pocket and got out his cellphone. He asked for a paper and pen, none of them had one, Kayla took her wand out of her pocket and conjured it. He wrote something in it, using his phone as a table. He then gave the paper to Kayla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you leave , Kayla. Go to this adress, I beg you, wave your wand and erase everyone&#39;s memory of me&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do a memory erase spell, can&#39;t you?&quot; <br />
<br />
She nodded but thought she wouldn&#39;t be capable.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were the one who got me into this, it&#39;s only fair you help me out of it&quot; James accused. Kayla swallowed dry, he was indeed right. &quot;Go to my family&#39;s house and make my parents, brothers and whoever is there that I ever existed. They never had me as a son or a brother, do you understand?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kayla retained the piece of paper inside of her pocket and draw her wand out once more. She had understood what James wanted to do. She had to ask him one more time if he was aware that she&#39;d leave the place in hours, by the breaking dawn he&#39;d have no more possibilities to change back into human. That while he had been a frog living in that pond he always knew that one day she&#39;d appear and wave her wand to give him back his previous life, but that would never happen again.<br />
 <br />
James was silent for another moment, this time shorter.<br />
He shrugged his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;My biggest reason to live is down there in that pond. My love and my family, I&#39;m a father now Kayla. I got children to take care for&quot; he laughed.<br />
<br />
Kayla complied. She gave a step back and pointed him the wand - &quot;Buffos vatrakios!&quot;<br />
The wand&#39;s tip lighted up green. James felt as exposed to some sort of radiation. He kind of hiccough and his eyes bugged out - his peripherical vision was diferent. He looked down to his hands which were green with brown spots, a webbed film starting to appear between his fingers. His spine felt strange, his knees bended and from that moment on everything started to change, he felt the clothes looser and looser until his shirt and jacket swallowed him. He fell among his clothes under a dark soft dome. Everything was dark. Kayla shook them and James sled out of a sleeve into the ground. His prespective had changed, the body didn&#39;t felt so strangea s the first time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; he said. Kayla heard a common &quot;ribbit&quot; coming form the frog. It jumped out of that place and left her there alone by the margin while it plonged into the pond&#39;s waters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup Kayla, you fucked him up good&quot; she admitted. Took the paper from her pocket and checked the adress, it was a sad move but James was right it would be better that way. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile James swam and found out some of his friends. All of them were surprised he was there, remembering how freakish it was the experience to see him transform into a human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, guys I came to stay. I only have one question, where&#39;s Lisa have you seen her?&quot;<br />
<br />
The answer was the one James knew in his heart: in the log. He swam quickly almost half of the pond to the log where they first consumated their love. When he aproached it he decided to jump into the margin, hop over the leaves and grass and enter the log from behind. There she was on the other side of the log, by the water. James entered, advanced cautiously and noticed how sad she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong , love!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;James!&quot; she hopped and turned around. &quot;What did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I came back ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You gave up your life as a human for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I realized that giving up on my lige would be stay there&quot; he answered her. Lisa leapt near him and they fondled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t live in your world. I&#39;m sorry you had to stop being a man for me&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m only a man by your side, croaking or not&quot; he kissed her and happily reminded &quot;Where are my little tadpoles, have we named them yet?!&quot;<br />
 Lisa showed them the pool under the log where their kids were lodged, all of them ten were sleeping, pressed against the walls. James was so happy to know that seven of them were boys and the three were beautiful princesses. <br />
<br />
His life had changed, he knew that, and also knew he wouldn&#39;t regret. Like time showed him. hopping around, munching flies, catching slugs, swimming across the lake, croaking a serenate to Lisa he wouldn&#39;t change none of that. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s the story of James, the man who was born human but died as a frog!</p>
