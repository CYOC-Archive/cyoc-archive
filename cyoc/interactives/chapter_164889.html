<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A couple hours past when Alice began to hear the front door creek open. Startled, as she was lost in her shows, she quickly rose up to her feet while on the couch to greet her mother as she stepped into the house. Already she could tell she was exhausted, it was obvious judging from the time that she got caught up doing overtime again. She was certainly a work-a-holic, but she really needed to be. Alice&#39;s father passed away when she was really young, so her mother, Lana, was the only one providing for the both of them. They had been in some rough times in the past, but thanks to Lana&#39;s new job, they are doing well again financially. Too bad it also means her mother spends most of her time at work however, Alice barely gets to see her much anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mom!&quot; Alice squealed from on top of the couch, &quot;How was work today?&quot; Lana slowly walked over to behind the couch so that she could lean down to give Alice a quick kiss on the head. At her current elevation, Alice was about as tall as her mother&#39;s collarbone.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was exhausting,&quot; Alice mother sighed, &quot;But at least it is all worth it to come hand and see your tiny beautiful smile.&quot; Alice couldn&#39;t help but blush. Her mother had always been loving and caring in the past (possible to an over degree), but her words hit differently than normal today. Perhaps it had something to do with her new size? &quot;How about I make the two of us dinner and we can catch up at the table?&quot; <br />
<br />
Lana began to slowly walk towards the kitchen as she gave a quick hand motion telling Alice to follow her. Carefully, Alice hopped down from the huge couch and began to speed walk in order to catch up to her mother, careful not to trip over the gown bunching up on the floor around her. Thankfully, Lana was used to walking slow so that her diminutive daughter could catch up. As Alice approached her mother from the backside, she looked up in awe at her towering figure. Normally her mother was only a few inches taller than her at 5&#39;3&quot;, but at her new height of 2&#39;6&quot; she was a real amazon. Comparing her height to her mother&#39;s, Alice found that she was just barely as tall as Lana&#39;s butt. <br />
<br />
&quot;How does a grill cheese sound cutie? We can split one.&quot; Alice nodded in agreement as she watched her mother slowly pace around the kitchen, making her meal. Every step she made created a soft vibration on the cold, hard kitchen floor. Alice couldn&#39;t help but get turned on at the site of her giant mother, it was just so exciting being around someone so huge. Looking up at the now towering furniture of house is one things, but observing an enormous member of her own species, close up, it&#39;s a spectacle to behold. It didn&#39;t take long for Alice&#39;s erection to return, her penis going from about 5 inches soft to its full length of 9. Sticking far in front of her, it was very easily noticeable as it tent up her nightgown. There was no point in trying to conceal it, but her mother didn&#39;t really seem to care. She obviously had noticed at this point, giving a quick smirk towards Alice&#39;s direction to confirm those claims, but it was probably a normal sight to her at this point. A dick so large on a body so small is very hard to control, especially with such inadequate clothing.<br />
<br />
 After their food was finished, the two of them moved to the dining room table to eat. Alice sat across from her mother, where she had to squat down on her knees just to see over the table. The two of them discussed their day as usual, laughing, joking, having fun. Her mother would tell her stories from her office, about crazy co workers and deranged bosses. Two whole hours must have passed as they sat there and talked. Even with all the changes to her body, Alice and her mother were still inseparable, perhaps even closer than ever before. <br />
<br />
As the clock struck 10 o&#39;clock. Lana looked on in disappointment. Tomorrow was another day of stressful work, and she needed to be up early. Sighing, she slowly rose to her chair and began to walk to her bedroom. Alice hopped down along side her and looked up at her mother longingly. Lana looked disappointed as she spoke, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Alice, I know we were just having fun, but I need to head to bed. I have work tomorrow.&quot; Alice looked down in defeat. &quot;I envy you Alice,&quot; Lana continued, bending down to look her daughter straight in the eyes, &quot;I wish there was somehow a way that I could live in your shoes. So filled with energy and carefree attitude, despite your small size, you overcome the world with a big heart and a proud spirit.&quot; <br />
<br />
As Lana moved slowly down the hall and into her room, Alice stood alone in thought. &quot;Live in my shoes, eh? That doesn&#39;t sound like such a bad idea.&quot; With speed, Alice rushed down the hall and into her own bedroom. Climbing back on the chair, she found the Chronivac opened on her computer, just how she left it. Where her name was listed at the top of the program, she replaced it with her mother&#39;s. Suddenly the 3-D figure changed from herself into Lana. Below was where all her stats were listed. Alice&#39;s attention immediately shifted to the height option. Right now it was at 100 percent, but that was soon to change.<br />
<br />
&quot;If mom wants to be small like me let&#39;s go all out.&quot; Slowly the slider shifted down. From 100 to 90. 90 to 80. 80 to 65. 65 to 50. At 50 percent her total height, Alice&#39;s mother would still be slightly taller than her at about 2&#39;7.5&quot;. However, Alice was beginning to grow curious, since she shrinking her mother anyway, why not be the taller one in the relationship for once. With that 50 moved to 40. Which means her mothers final height would be 2&#39;1.2&quot;. &quot;Perfect, now just to wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice didn&#39;t want her mother to freak out by shrinking her before she went to bed. She wanted this to be a huge surprise for her in the morning. Hopefully, shocked about her new stature, she&#39;ll opt to call in sick so the two of them could spend the whole day together. &quot;Maybe we could go the park down the street,&quot; Alice daydreamed, &quot;I would love having a picnic there, it&#39;s always so beautiful as I pass it on my morning jogs. <br />
<br />
Alice felt an hour slowly pass her by as she sat idle in her chair. Thinking it was certain that her mother was asleep already she slowly began to creep across the house till she reached the door to her room. Reaching up she pulled the handle as quietly as possible. If she was asleep, she definitely didn&#39;t want to wake her poor mom up. Thankfully, as Alice peered into the dark room, she could see the slumbering figure of her mother faintly as she tossed and tumbled on the bed. With a quick skip back the Chronivac, she hit &quot;Y&quot; on her previously inputted command. Which much giddy she eagerly climbed on top of her bed. &quot;Tomorrow will be so much fun, I can hardly wait.&quot; Setting her alarm to match her mother&#39;s, it wasn&#39;t long till Alice was fast asleep, snoring as loud as a bear. </p>
