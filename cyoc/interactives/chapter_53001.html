<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well in order to gain this power you have to become my child,&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That means I'm going to become pregnant with you and give birth to you,&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you make me your child without that?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The power can only be passed on through pregnancy and the birthing process,&quot; the woman said. &quot;I'll take good care of you though. Now lets get you out of those oversized clothes so we can continue.&quot; She took your shirt off then lifted you out of your other clothes. &quot;Well you're cute as a little boy,&quot; she said setting you down. You looked down at yourself and had to admit that she was right about that. &quot;But you know something?&quot; she asked in a conspiratorial whisper. &quot;I think you'll be cuter as a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; you asked shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll also have to block your memories but I'll unblock them when you're twelve,&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; you said backing up. &quot;I didn't say I wanted your gift only to be changed into a girl and have my memories blocked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm blocking your memories so it's easier for you to adjust,&quot; the woman said. &quot;As for becoming a girl I want a daughter and I think you'd look really cute as a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I don't want to be a girl?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
The woman smiled and said, &quot;You don't have a choice if you want this power.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman reached under her skirt and took her panties off. You knew you weren't going to win any argument and decided that the best thing to do would be to run. You turned around and started running but the woman caught you easily. You started kicking as you shouted, &quot;LET ME GO. LET ME GO.&quot; To your horror you felt yourself shrinking again. You went down in age to four years, three, two, one, eleven months, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, and still you grew younger. You couldn't speak now but you could cry and cry you did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Mommy will take care of you,&quot; the woman said in a soothing voice as you regressed. &quot;Oh I should have told you that when someone is regressed past birth they go to the nearest human female that can become pregnant. In this case that's me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You continued to get younger and soon you were just a day old. The woman sat down on the floor and held you near her pussy. Your belly button grew out into an umbilical cord and snaked it's way into the woman's pussy. She moved you closer to her pussy and your feet went in. She kept pushing you further into her pussy making sure that she held your arms to your side as your groin and waist slipped in. Soon all that was left outside was your head and then it wasn't.<br />
<br />
It was dark in the woman's womb. You couldn't see but you could feel and you felt a fluid flow around you. You could feel yourself getting younger still and you had to wonder just how young you were going to get. Would you become so young that you go past conception?<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Nine months later:<br />
<br />
You squirmed around in your warm and comfy place. You were happy being in here hearing your Mommy's voice and her heartbeat. You didn't want to leave but your Mommy said that it would be time to be born soon. You didn't know what being born was but you didn't want it. You had moved into a new position and were just laying there when you felt something move you. This confused you and you tried moving around again. Each time you did though you would be forced into a new position. Finally you decided to just go with it and let whatever it was move you as it would. After awhile the fluid that surrounded you drained away. You were confused by it since it had always been there. Some time later you felt something pushing you and you went into a confined space. You were squeezed and then your head was in a bigger space. The only thing was that it wasn't warm. Something was put in your mouth and you could feel something being sucked out. You heard a voice say, &quot;Push,&quot; and then you were being pushed again. You came out pretty quick and when the cold air hit your body you started crying from the fear. Over your crying you hear the same person say, &quot;Congratulations. It's a girl.&quot; You were taken and placed on something then you were wrapped up in a pink blanket. You calmed down seeing as you were warm again.<br />
<br />
You were handed to someone who said with a smile, &quot;Hello there little one.&quot; You recognized the voice of your mommy and calmed down some more.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's her name?&quot; someone asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elizabeth Marie Powers,&quot; your mommy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's the father?&quot; the person asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know his name,&quot; your mommy said. &quot;It was a one night stand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; the voice said. &quot;Elizabeth Marie Powers born at 12:12:12 AM on October 31, 1997 to Annabelle Lynn Powers. Congratulations to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; your mommy said.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
12 years later:<br />
<br />
You woke up early in the morning. Earlier than usual. It was your 12th birthday today and of course Halloween. What made it even better was that it was a Saturday meaning no school. You had the whole day to celebrate your birthday. You practically jumped out of bed and ran to the bathroom. You wanted to get started on your day as early as you could. Once in the bathroom you took off your nightgown and panties throwing them into the hamper. You sat down on the toilet and did your business. You took your shower and wrapped a towel around your body and hair. You went back to your room and used some lotion on your legs and arms. You smiled as you thought of that cute boy Kevin. You're sure he would like to feel how soft your skin is and you're thinking you might let him do that later. You hoped he would come to your party. You were too old to go Trick or Treating but you were still going to dress up. You looked at your costume for later. You had decided to be a witch this year. Your mom had suggested it for you and you went with it. Giggling you took off your towels and went to get some clothes. You took out black panties, a black bra, and black knee high socks. Going to your closet you took out a dark blue T-shirt and a blue denim pleated skirt. You stopped to look at yourself in your mirror. You had a bit of pubic hair and your breasts were a AA cup. Your breasts weren't likely to get much bigger since your mom only had A cup breasts herself. Your hair was Strawberry Blonde and down to mid back. Your eyes were a brilliant green. You run your hands down your body feeling the slight curve of your waist and hips. You loved your body but something seemed to be off. You couldn't figured out what it was and you couldn't shake the feeling no matter what. You had brought it up with your mom but she couldn't help when you couldn't even guess what seemed off. Sighing you turn away from the mirror and get dressed. Once dressed you brushed your hair and put in the pentagram earrings your mom had bought for you. You slipped your feet into a pair of black Mary Janes then started to go down for breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't brushed your teeth yet young lady,&quot; your mom said standing in the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
You blushed and said, &quot;Sorry Mom I just forgot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well get your butt in here and brush your teeth,&quot; your mom said with a smile.<br />
<br />
You giggled as you headed back into the bathroom. Your mom couldn't keep a straight face with you. Even when she was serious with you she would be smiling. When you had started puberty a couple years ago she had sat you down and talked to you about your body and sex. She was smiling all throughout the talk but she was serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready for today?&quot; your mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; you said the excitement evident in your voice. &quot;I think it's going to be a special day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe more special than you think,&quot; your mom said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, what's wrong?&quot; you asked looking at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you after breakfast,&quot; your mom said looking sad.<br />
<br />
This worried you since you haven't ever seen your mom like this. After breakfast you were sitting on her lap just enjoying being held by her. You were both quiet and she was stroking your hair. &quot;This is harder than I thought it would be,&quot; she said at last.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's harder?&quot; you asked snuggling a little closer to your mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promised you something when I became pregnant with you,&quot; you mom said her voice somber. &quot;At the time I didn't know just how much your happiness would mean to me. I've been arguing with myself whether I should keep that promise or not seeing as how it could make you very unhappy and mad at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it have to do with my dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mom didn't answer right away. After a minute or two in which she continued to stroke your hair she said, &quot;It's a bit complicated. If I keep my promise you'll know just how complicated it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've always told me that I should keep my promises,&quot; you said looking up into your mom's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I should keep my promise but I don't want to make you unhappy,&quot; your mom said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it something really bad?&quot; you asked kind of afraid of the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;That depends on what you feel is bad,&quot; your mom said. She sighed and said, &quot;I guess I'll keep my promise. I just hope that you won't hate me.&quot; She touched your forehead.<br />
<br />
You were about to ask her what she meant when your memories came flooding back. You looked down at your body with wide eyes. Your mom strokes your hair again and you cuddle up against her thinking. Before you had experienced living as a girl you would have been mad at being made a girl. Now that you have lived as a girl without knowing that you were a man before you realize that you enjoy it. You looked up at your mom smiling and said, &quot;I don't hate you Mom. I still love you and I'm not mad at you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be your daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you don't hate me?&quot; your mom asked looking surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not Mom,&quot; you said turning around and hugging her. &quot;I've enjoyed being a girl and I want to continue to be a girl. I'm still happy. You were worried over nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mom hugged you and said, &quot;You have no idea what that means to me. And you're still calling me, &quot;Mom.&quot; I am sorry I did it this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't have accepted it any other way Mom,&quot; you said making sure she knows she's still your mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you're still happy?&quot; your mom asked sounding unsure.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am happy Mom,&quot; you said smiling and hugging her tighter. &quot;I wasn't all that happy in my old life especially after the day I had when you came to me. Now I don't have that much to worry about except school and what boy I like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we should get ready for your party,&quot; your mom said sounding happier than she had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean shopping?&quot; you asked a hopeful tone in your voice. You knew it was a stereotypical girl thing but you did like shopping. You could spend hours at the mall just browsing through the clothes stores.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it involves a little shopping,&quot; your mom said with a smile. &quot;Go get your purse and we'll be ready to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
You quickly run back to your room to get your purse. You checked to make sure you had a couple tampons in case you got your period and that you had some of your allowance since you wanted to buy some make-up. Your mom did say you could start wearing make-up when you turned twelve. You made sure you had your cell phone in case any of your friends wanted to talk to you while you were out shopping. Going back to the living you begin to wonder what will happen at your party.</p>
