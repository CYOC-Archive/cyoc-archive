<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Three weeks passed. How was everybody doing?<br />
<br />
Will had to change his outfit. It was unbearable to wear tight clothing. He would just itch, and itch, it was horrible. Looking in his closet rewarded him with nothing. Creativity would be needed in order to find what he wanted.<br />
<br />
Underneath the kitchen sink was a green table cover, it was very thin. Will was able to manipulate the cover, and cut holes in it with his claws. Now he had a hole for his head, and arms! Now it was like he was wearing a poncho. This fabric wouldn&#39;t irritate his body as much, and it was large enough to conceal his body down to his upper thighs, but it wasn&#39;t perfect.......<br />
<br />
It made a annoying crunching sound every time he moved, it frustrated him. This sound reminded him of the squeaky boots episode in SpongeBob. He couldn&#39;t sleep with it on. Tossing, and turning was something Will always did. That fucking sound drove him crazy, he needed his sleep. Wearing no clothes was a bad idea in the cabin. Will decided that sleep was more important, so he slept in the nude. That won&#39;t backfire at all.....................<br />
<br />
<br />
James felt like he was punished the worst of the three. He couldn&#39;t do anything with these hooves. Hands are something we take for granted as humans. Opening the fridge, doing the dishes, bathing himself, everything was a challenge. Will, and Cameron were nice enough to help him with tedious tasks, like grabbing a book, or a plate, but they couldn&#39;t help him with everything.<br />
<br />
Clothes were just a nightmare. Have you ever tried putting your clothes on without hands? It was just the worst. Donkey fur made it even uncomfortable to wear pants. Lust would only increase if he wore nothing, James understood that. If his friends tried to help him, they probably couldn&#39;t resist that large dick of his. <br />
<br />
His big testicles made it awkward sitting down, he learned that the hard way as he almost vomited when he full on sat on them. His life was a living hell, but it was a hell of his own creation. He could just avoid clothes, and be naked. Life would be so much easier. He wanted to escape the cabin, but he mentally could only focus on his changed body. His dick was always erect, he really couldn&#39;t masterbate anymore. He would need a person, a lover, a mate, only they could make him orgasm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cameron was doing the best of the three. He unlike the others, had no fur at all. His problems were similar, but a tad bit different. His breasts were bigger than before, they were full of breast milk. His nipples were larger, and soooooo sensitive. Pink puffy areola surround his erect nipples. Cameron tried easing them himself, but to no avail, it had to be a mouth. His two sisters wanted to be sucked on, that was the only way. Cameron thought of himself as a man, but when he stared at Will, and James when they ate, Cameron could only look at their mouths, the tongue that would move the food around. Cameron would start to pant, and imagine if that food was his twin sisters, if they would suckle on his breasts, They were such a great size. He probably looked so sexy. He sometimes wished one of them would pull off his bra........<br />
<br />
Ironically, Cameron was the one that didn&#39;t wear a shirt. The cabin was nice enough, that there were some bra&#39;s in his closet. They were so soft. He chose the red lingerie bra, it contrasted with his long blond hair. Wearing sweatpants was the easiest, as he only had to wear them a little lower underneath the dog tail. Sweatpants were a tight fit, his butt was just so thick, big, sexy........ He slapped his ass when he was in the shower, and that sound would ricochet all around the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Now was the interesting part. Everytime he wore a shirt, it would pleasure his 4 nipples underneath his red bra, he couldn&#39;t wear 3 bra&#39;s, so it was very hard trying to avoid changing with that awesome sensation. His teats were just so sensitive, they might be smaller than his main two breasts, but boy did they pack a punch. Deciding that shirts are a no go, Cameron would only wear a bra.<br />
<br />
This would let everyone look at his 4 smaller puffy dog teats. James was the leader, and would have opposed this. With James&#39;s new hooves, he barely had time to look out for the others. This left the blonde with free reign on what he wanted to do. Wearing a bra with no shirt on was so erotic for everyone looking at that. How long could the other two stare at that? Lust was building, Cameron showing off his chest would only escalate everything.</p>
