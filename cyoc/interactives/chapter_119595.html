<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back at the high school Marco and Luca watched from the stands as Park scored the winning goal.  Luca continued to check his phone for a response from Ty, but he hadn&#39;t heard anything from him in nearly two hours.  While they waited, Marco and Luca chatted.  Even though he found the Latino hot, he was about as interesting as watching paint dry.  Marco had taken off his shirt during the game claiming he was hot and Luca hadn&#39;t really noticed how close he was, mostly because of the number of people in the stands.  Suddenly Marco pulled Luca close and kissed him.  Luca was shocked..he didn&#39;t know how good of a kisser Marco was, and he submitted for a moment before breaking the kiss and jumping back, just as Jae and the other arrived.<br />
&quot;Yo man!  What the hell was that?!?&quot;  Luca said anxiously.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your damage little dude?  Why wouldn&#39;t I kiss you?  We&#39;ve been dating for 3 weeks now.&quot; Marco said in a hurt tone.<br />
&quot;no no no no no..this isnt right.&quot;  Luca said<br />
Jae put his hand shoulders and pulled in, hugging him.  &quot;Calm down.  What&#39;s going on here?&quot;<br />
Luca pointed &quot;Marco just put the moves on me...he knows I have a boyfriend.&quot;  Marco looked away hurt.<br />
&quot;What are you talking about Luca?  You, me, Park and Marco went to see a movie a couple of weeks ago.  You guys sat in the back where you jumped into Marco&#39;s arms.  After that night you two have been inseparable.&quot; Jae said concerned. <br />
&quot;No no no no..&quot; Luca shook his head &quot;You and Park and Ty and I went to the movies where that happened.  Marco was at the beach.&quot; <br />
&quot;What are you talking about?  What happened?  Why don&#39;t you remember?  Who is Ty?!?!?&quot;  Marco said getting more upset.<br />
&quot;Who is this Ty?  Tell us about him...maybe that will help&quot; Jae said trying to be the voice of reason.<br />
&quot;Ty...Ty was my bf.  He&#39;s 6&#39;5...big...muscular...wouldn&#39;t hurt a fly...black...he&#39;s beautiful inside and out..he was sweet and smart.  You introduced him to me on my first day here.  He helped me get through the break up with my ex.  He helped a lot of you with homework.&quot;  Luca said, a tear running down his face.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have to listen to this!&quot;  Marco said, hurt, getting up.  <br />
&quot;Just a bit Marco...&quot; Jae said.<br />
&quot;Anyway...&quot;  Luca continued.  &quot;He was meeting up with Kai this morning for a campus tour.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hang on&quot; Tristan interjected.  &quot;Who was with Kai?&quot;<br />
&quot;TY!  TYRONE JACKSON!  My boyfriend!  Why can&#39;t any of you remember him???&quot;  Luca sobbed, wondering if he was losing his mind.  &quot;We started dating after I got back from Barcelona.  And Tristan and Silas he was helping you with math.  And Marco, we joined you, Tristan, Silas and Jae at the beach right before I went to Barcelona.&quot;  He finally broke into tears, crying into Jae&#39;s arms as Jae tried to comfort him.  All them were confused now.  Just as Silas was about to say something, Jae gave him a look and shook his head.  <br />
&quot;Wait...Ive got proof!&quot;  He pulled out his phone and pulled a picture and showed them.  &quot;Look!  This is a pic that I took  of us in the bleachers, the day he pulled me on his lap.<br />
<br />
They looked at the phone and were surprised quite a bit with they saw.  Luca was smiling, his head tilted, as if it were resting on something or someone...but the most bizarre thing about the pic was that Luca appeared to be floating.<br />
&quot;Do you all see?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Whoa...it&quot; Park started.<br />
&quot;Luca do you remember who took this pic?&quot; Jae interrupted.<br />
&quot;Yeah...Marco...we always sit together when we watch you guys practice.&quot;<br />
Jae took the phone from Luca and help it at an angle that Marco could see.  &quot;What do you remember about this?&quot;<br />
Marco grabbed the phone, still hurt, until he looked at the picture...puzzled.  &quot;Like I remember him asking me to take a pic and telling me to back up so that everyone was in the pic.  I...I don&#39;t remember why.  Like I know the reason...but I can&#39;t remember.&quot;  Marco said, now less hurt and more confused.  <br />
Jae took the phone back and looked at Luca, who was still visibly shaken.. He pulled Luca close, using his thumb to wipe away his tears and then pulled him into a hug.  Park, Tristan, Silas, and Marco got up and joined Jae&#39;s hug as Luca sobbed into to Jae&#39;s chest.<br />
Jae looked down and tilted his sensitive friend&#39;s face up and said &quot;I don&#39;t know why none of us remember him nor do I know why you remember him.  If anyone else said something like this, Id think they were clownin,  but Luca, of everyone I know you above anyone else, have pure heart, a sweet personality and that when you see something wrong you try to correct it.  That&#39;s one reason.  This is the second...&quot;  he gave Luca his phone back, showing him the pic, causing Luca to gasp.  <br />
Luca took the phone and went to his text messages.  He pulled up his texts with Ty &quot;I dont understand...there&#39;s his name...but the texts are gone.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s pretty weird too.  Did you try calling the number?&quot; Jae asked, knowing the answer.<br />
&quot;Yeah...at first I got Ty&#39;s voicemail, which was weird because he always picked up.  When I tried a second time it changed to a message saying that the user had not set up their voicemail, like he just got the phone.  Then during halftime I got a call from someone sounding British asking why I called and what I wanted.&quot;<br />
Jae looked at Park who gave him a reassuring look.  &quot;You guys are my crew and I will always look out for you.  I love each of you like a brother.  I would do anything for any of you.  And as far as you know, we&#39;ve been tight most of our lives...but that&#39;s not exactly true.&quot;  They looked at him confused.<br />
&quot;I think that it&#39;s time you know the truth.&quot; Jae said somberly...</p>
