<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You stepped out through the subway door and into the oppressive heat of the station.  It was like someone had set the station’s heating system to 100 degrees as the stifling air caused sweat to begin beading up on your forehead.<br />
<br />
The sharp temperature change caused you to momentarily pause a few steps away from the open car, when you head the shrieks of two laboring women come from behind you.<br />
<br />
“What’s… unnghhhhaaaaaa!!” one of them exclaimed, followed shortly by a second, equally confused voice crying, “Its so… aaaahh!  Please I… nnnghhhh!  I don’t underst… nnnaaaaah!”<br />
<br />
The reminder of the mess you had left behind, coupled with the sight of a number of onlookers rushing to help was all you needed to continue your speedy exit from the station.  You began moving through the crowd as you made your way towards the escalator at the far end of the platform, but something just seemed wrong – and not because of the wand’s mess behind you.  <br />
<br />
The further into the station you got, the hotter things seemed to be.  Even worse, the heat had fully soaked into your body and it was beginning to sap your strength, though no one else seemed to notice.  As the sweat dripped into your eyes you came to pause near a set of stairs about midway down the platform.  Looking up, you could see that they led directly to the street.  <br />
<br />
Climbing the stairs in this heat would be a lot harder than just riding the escalator, but the escalator itself was still a few hundred yards away and also meant going through a large mezzanine before you could get outside.  These stairs, on the other hand, would take you right there.  It wasn’t ideal, but you had to get to cooler air.  <br />
<br />
You gulped down some saliva and began climbing.  <br />
<br />
The first step came easily enough, but when your foot landed on step number two, you felt a strange combination of weight, sloshing, and jiggling coming from your chest.  You looked down, but what you saw made no sense.  <br />
<br />
Towards the top of your chest, your sweatshirt was being pressed out into two distinct points – almost like there were two balloons affixed on top of your nipples.  Even more strange, the points kept pushing further and further out, as though whatever was under your sweatshirt was inflating.<br />
<br />
Raising a curious hand, you cupped the rightmost protrusion, and your brain was immediately assaulted by two very different sensations.  Your palm found itself wrapped around the bottom of something that felt soft, with the distinct but subtle sloshing of fluid inside.  But it wasn’t that sensation that was cause of your soon to be panic, it was the other sensation – the one that came from your body.<br />
<br />
While your hand told you that it was cupping something soft and flesh like, your nipple told you that it was being gently pinched between the sides of two fingers.  Then there was the other sensation – of the palm cupping the flesh around your nipple.  It was something you’d never experienced before, because you’d never been able to experience it before.  Your nipple was supposed to be flush against your chest, but now it was bulging out, with a large mass of soft, slushy, and sore flesh separating it from your ribs.<br />
<br />
Your watched as the mass continued to grow under your sweatshirt, felt the increased pressure pushing out into your palm, and became distinctly aware of the tugging on your back caused by the addition of new weight to the front of your chest.<br />
<br />
“Wha…”  your mouth slammed shut prematurely as a dainty, feminine voice emanated from it.<br />
<br />
You looked back up, away from your shifting flesh and towards the top of the stairs.  It was at that moment that your brain shut down.  Deep down inside you knew what was going on – that the orb from the subway hadn’t harmlessly passed through you – but the implications of everything that was going on was simply too much for your rationale mind to process all at once.  So rather than trying, your brain just flipped a switch to shut the thinking part of it down while it sent the instinct part of it into full gear.<br />
<br />
Fight or flight.  That was all you could do.  Fighting your changing body wasn’t an option, so you went with the only other thing you could do.  You ran.<br />
<br />
A burst of energy went to your legs as they began to rocket up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Step number three saw a much more pronounced jiggling from your chest as your new C cup breasts took full shape and filled with milk.  Without thinking, you brought your left arm up to help support them as your right arm grabbed onto the stair rail to help you ascend.<br />
<br />
Your foot landed on step four and you could feel a strange tingling in your dick.  You tried to tense it, only to feel it rapidly deflating – almost like coming down off a hard on, except you’d started flaccid.<br />
<br />
Step five and the sensation in your dick almost completely vanished, being replaced by a feeling of powerful, circular, and wet muscles clamping down against themselves from a point just in front of your ass all the way into the bottom of your abdomen.  <br />
<br />
Blond hair fluttered down in front of your eyes as your foot came down on step six, and the arm that was cupping your breasts came up to brush it away, exposing your breasts to the uncomfortable reality of gravity’s effect on two large, fluid filled objects.<br />
<br />
At that point you closed your eyes.  The bulges under your sweatshirt and the changing sensations in your crotch were bad enough, but the long, straight, womanly hair was the final straw.<br />
<br />
You kept ascending the steps, eyes closed.  The hair on your head continued to grow longer as the hair on the rest of your body vanished.  More steps and your body began to shrink and contort as it went from 5’11 to 5’4 and your pant legs began to bunch up at your ankles.  <br />
<br />
More steps and the waist of your jeans became loose as you went from weighing 165 pounds to 125.  Your left arm, which was in full damage control mode trying to brush your hair back while cushioning your breasts, took a momentary break from that to undo your belt, cinch it as tight as it could, then refasten it.  <br />
<br />
Your shoes began to get loose as you continued to ascend the stairs.  Fortunately, both your shoes and newly tightened pants managed to stay on your body, albeit quite loosely, as your body settled on its final height and weight.<br />
<br />
You opened your eyes and saw that you were about 3/4 of the way up the stairs.  What you didn’t see was that your skin had begun to smooth out while muscles, bones and organs regenerated as your previously 37 year old body de-aged down to a young and fertile 20 year old girl.<br />
<br />
Not much longer to go – you still hadn’t regained your rational faculties as your body began to again move towards the top of the stairs.  <br />
<br />
Another step, and another strange sensation, this time from your lower abdomen.  You could feel a pressure growing more intense as something seemed to be pushing into both the back of your belly button, the top of your hips, and the front of your spine simultaneously.  More steps and a new sloshing sensation, both similar to and different from the one in your chest, began to come from that pressure in your abdomen.<br />
<br />
Only five more steps to go.  Five more steps until you could escape, or so your ill informed brain told you.  You lifted your leg, raised it up, and slammed it down on the next step when you felt something else slam down against what your body told you was the backside of the very top of your new vagina.<br />
<br />
Your muscles clenched down against the thing that had just appeared inside of you, feeling it over and telling you that there was a round, hard thing pressing down into your hips from above.  Then, connected to that, was another softer thing, with four squirming little protrusions sticking off of it.<br />
<br />
Your foot landed on the last step, and you looked up and out towards a busy city street.  Panting, you looked down, past your swollen breasts, and to the huge stomach pressing out into your sweatshirt underneath them.  Letting go of the stair rail, you cupped your new stomach with both hands and got to once again experience an all new, dual sensation.<br />
<br />
From the outside, you could feel a strong jolt against your palm as the skin on your stomach kicked out.  From the inside, you could feel that squirmy thing inside of you kick out into the tender flesh that contained it.  <br />
<br />
You felt your new body over as the realization of what happened finally caught up with you.  That light that had entered your body earlier had been the soul of one of the crowd members.  It had transformed into the wiggling, kicking baby that now occupied your newly formed uterus, taking the rest of your body with it.<br />
<br />
It was exhausting – you could feel the baby sapping your body’s strength as your heart and lungs were both working for two people despite having only been designed for one.  Then there was the weight and pressure of gravity pulling the baby’s body against your own, straining the muscles and ligaments that had held your previously male body together without issue.  And unlike the soreness that was caused by exercise, you couldn’t just stop carrying the baby…<br />
<br />
Well… not in a way that you wanted to think about.  You’d seen the woman on the subways and…</p>
