<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brianna was half asleep on her wife’s now were-tiger chest, to her amazement and joy she could actually hear Stacy purring in her sleep. She didn’t think Tiger’s could purr but were-tigers clearly could. She couldn’t wait to be a were-cat herself, Stacy had said tomorrow they had to meet at some park a few hours away. Luckly it was her day off at the hospital tomorrow and the kids where home from school since it was a Saturday. She was about to fully fall sleep when her phone started ringing. <br />
<br />
With some complaint because she left her wife and picked up the phone.<br />
<br />
“Hello.” Said Brianna <br />
<br />
“Mrs. Smith this is Rockwell High and we have your son Josh in our office and we need you to come in as soon as possible, there is a matter we need to address with you.” said the voice on the other end of the line.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I will be there soon.” said Brianna as she looked at Stacy who’s eyes where opened and listening in to the phone call. <br />
<br />
It only took a few minutes to get dressed and Stacy to put on the necklace which acted like a spell focus which allowed her to maintain the spell which made her look human with ease. <br />
<br />
They arrived at the high school and walked into the principal’s office only to find Josh sitting in front of the principal’s desk however he wasn’t alone, Josh’s teacher Miss Jones and worse of all Josh’s father Kevin. <br />
<br />
“What is he doing here?” inquired Brianna as she glared at her ex.<br />
<br />
“I am Josh’s father.” Stated Kevin <br />
<br />
“Your rights were taken from you by the courts.” Stated Stacy remaining more calm then her wife as she glared at the principal and more so Miss Jones. The principal’s eyes widened a bit at the news that Kevin had no parental rights to the Josh. “I wonder why he was contacted.” <br />
<br />
“I have filed an appeal to that.” Snapped Kevin “And you have no right to be here, you…”<br />
<br />
“Don’t talk to my mom like that.” Snapped Josh as he jumped up and glared at his father.<br />
<br />
“Principal Lefeld, this man and calling him a man is an insult to all true men was convicted in a court of law and sentenced to prison for domestic and child abuse and other crimes.” stated Stacy as she went into lawyer mode. <br />
<br />
“That is a lie, I was manning him up it wasn’t abuse. A belt to the…” snapped Kevin but Stacy went on.<br />
<br />
“His rights were taken from him as part of a deal for less prison time, there is an active protection order for Josh and Brianna from him. I also adopted him so he is my son just as much as my wife’s. Him being here is a crime within itself and I really want to know how he got here before us.” stated Stacy as she moved forward and leaned over the desk to glare at the principal. “Now unless you want me and the firm I work for to open a law suit that would make the school board’s head spin, I want you to get that police officer I saw sitting in his car in here now and have that man…and I use that term lossy arrested for breaking that protection order.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Said the principal as he pressed a button on his office phone. “Linda, will you go out and get the officer and bring him in here please.”<br />
<br />
“YOU CAN’T DO THAT YOU LESBIAN WHORE!” snapped Kevin as he moved toward Stacy fist raised but Josh jumped to his feet and punched his dad hard in the face sending him to the floor with clearly a broken nose.<br />
<br />
“Don’t touch either one of my moms ever again!” yelled Josh as Stacy smiled to herself, she didn’t try to force a relationship with Josh, but hearing him call her mom was always nice.<br />
<br />
“Kevin…honey!” yelled Josh’s teacher Miss. Jones as she rushed to Kevin who had stumbled to the floor.<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess, that confirms who I thought called him.” Confirmed Stacy as she straightened up and look at the principal. “I recommend you look into Miss. Jones and see if she helped violated the protection order on my son.”<br />
<br />
“He isn’t your son, you Godless monster, you and all sinners are doomed to hell.” snapped Miss Jones. “I am trying to save his young man’s soul by getting him with a good man to provide a good role model.”<br />
<br />
“If Kevin is a good role model, I don’t want to see a bad one. I have some scars to prove that.” Stated Brianna as the cop came in. <br />
<br />
“Officer arrests this man, for violating a protection order among other things, I will fill you in later.” Said the principal “Miss Jones go back to your classroom and gather your things and leave. I will have to talk to the school board about what you did today.”<br />
<br />
“But…” said Miss Jones wide eyed.<br />
<br />
“Go.” Snapped the Principal<br />
<br />
“I would like everyone to write a statement.” Stated the officer. <br />
<br />
“No need.” stated the Principal as he pointed to a camera in the corner. “School policy, all meetings are recorded.”<br />
<br />
They waited until Kevin left in handcuffs and Miss Jones left with tears in her eyes knowing she was likely losing her job. <br />
<br />
“Now…why did you call us in?” inquired Brianna <br />
<br />
“Josh got into a fight with another student.” explained the principal “However given that the student was Miss Jone’s nephew makes me wonder if this was all some kind of plan. Rules say we have to give him out of school detention for fighting but I will speak with the school board to see if we can look the other way on this case.”<br />
<br />
“Good.” stated Brianna as she smiled at her son. “Now would you call over to the elementary school, we are taking Josh and Emily home for the rest of the day.”<br />
<br />
“Understandable.” Stated the Principal “I will make the call, they will have your daughter ready at the office and I apologize again for what happened.”<br />
<br />
“We will see what you do before we accept that apologize or not.” stated Stacy <br />
<br />
“Josh go get your stuff from your locker, we are going home.” Said Brianna as she looked out the window of the school office to see her abusive ex get put in the back of a police cruiser.</p>
