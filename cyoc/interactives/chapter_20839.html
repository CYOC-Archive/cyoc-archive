<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Many thanks for the letters recieved from you, our readers. The public was just as surprised to discover these special grants of government funds, and the experiments done on our newest generation.<br />
<br />
Those letters, some from parents of those placed in long or short term contracts. All of those who dare to speak out considered the news of our reporting as, informative, and helping society to govern its leaders.<br />
<br />
I talked at length with one such young man, his name is plainly Kenneth, as telling his last name would inspire some to show their indignations.<br />
<br />
As from our inquest of these experiments, those who have reached their term limits, are at last being released from confinement. Kenneth, a student at college was short on cash, his continued schooling would have come to a standstill, if not for discovering these tests. In dire need he signed a contract, volunteering his body and life for the period of five years.<br />
<br />
He was just nineteen when last this young man entered the doors of this facility. Now, upon his reinstatement, transitioning completed, he walked out almost a free man, but at the age of twenty-four.<br />
<br />
When he entered the experiments his puberty growth spurts had almost subsided. As he was old enough by law to bind his contract, he had a body still growing, maturing, and willing to gain mass.<br />
<br />
He told me of seven seperate injections, these began the process the  professors called &quot;Reformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The word is exactly sounding as occured, it forced his young body into a realm of species change. Ken, his experiment should have directed him into the equine testing, as it did with our last subject, Daniel. <br />
<br />
Instead he was placed into an experiment using a revolutionary Proton ray, its function being to rearange, and meld a subjects D.N.A. making his or her body conform to a new species.<br />
<br />
It was from an arguement between a professor, a nurse, one test subject standing as an Angora billy goat, and our friend Ken.<br />
<br />
During a short quarrel the Proton Ray discharged, directing a wide beam engulfing the goat, nurse, and Kenneth. Lucky for him he was to the farthest side of the beam. This granted some protection from the  unwarranted strength the beam was left set after its last cleaning.<br />
<br />
Almost instantly the Goat and Nurse vaporized, their D.N.A. and Gene patterns enveloped and dissolved by the Ray and its force. <br />
<br />
Ken became the unwilling recipient of the other two patterns. His Reformation Serum injections took hold upon the newly transitioned Gene structures, causing him to litteraly evolve into a totaly different species.<br />
<br />
When he awoke it was more than six weeks after the situation. He found himself held in a dark cell, away from the eyes of those who needed not to know of him and what happened.<br />
<br />
As Ken tells it his awakening was not without some terror, he was willingly ready to become as did Daniel, but found this not to be the case.<br />
<br />
Awakening, he sat up on the side of his cot. A mind and brain feeling as if full of cotton, simular to the morning after syndrome.<br />
<br />
A deep breath made him instantly aware of his newly grown breasts, &quot;CC&quot; in size, but covered over with a shaggy golden coating of hair. <br />
<br />
Seeing his change, he went to stand up and losing his balance, fell back on the cot. Stunned, scared, he lay there collecting his thoughts, trying to calm himself, only to sit up again, this time taking inventory of what had happened.<br />
<br />
His new formed breasts were just the tip of the iceberg. As hands having long fingers, they too being coated in short golden hairs, smoothed down the length of sleek and sassy body.<br />
<br />
His reporting of the sensation we can not describe in the open news, but to suggest of increased feelings of and for sensuality, the female parts of his body reacted in an animalistic fashions.<br />
<br />
Jumping up, spling his stance, Ken stood upright, feeling and seeing his legs. Longer than those he walked in upon, thighs those of a female human but from the knees down he had legs, feet, and cloven hooves like those of that Angora billy goat, only larger.<br />
<br />
Seein all this having happened, he was changed of species and gender, becoming not a pure animal, certainly not a human, but a mix breed. If anything could be suggested as a breed, he or rather she stood as a mythical satyr woman.<br />
<br />
As breathing increased from his fear, the sensation of being both female and of goat taunted him into mental patterns of bestial lust.<br />
<br />
Ken tells in scriptic detail of a guard coming with his meal tray. The man entered the cell expecting to find the inmate sleeping or sedated. In this case he or she was wide awake and jumping up, struggled the man to the floor. In simple words, Ken raped the guard!<br />
<br />
Clothing torn from Ken's fingers, they bearing small and sharp hooflets. He struggled but upon looking into Ken's yellow golden eyes, a trance kept him doing as what Ken lusted he should do, they mated.<br />
<br />
Once the act was completed the guard escaped Ken's grasp. Naked he fled the cell, locking it shut, and returning to his duties. As if from tales of olden times the sexual encounter found the guard soon in a cell across from Ken. The Reformation serum carries a residual flux reaction, infecting those who would have sexual relations too soon after the transition process in defined.<br />
<br />
Ken tells me that at the time his changing mind and attitudes toward humans, men mostly, had him thinking of them as things of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Sprouting horns made Ken look the part, white they were, growing out of his cranium. Spiral horns, needle pointed, they were as much a weapon as having sex with a man.<br />
<br />
Taking to singing, Ken made the male guards swoon that kept watch over him and his soon to be male partner.<br />
<br />
The guard being of a older age, matured in life and body found his change to goat and satyr to much, committing suiside in his cell.<br />
<br />
Ken was removed from the cell often for testing and further experiments. Chained like some bull in a rodeo, his arms and legs shackled so tightly he could make only small moves.<br />
<br />
Like those creatures of myth, Ken's tail grew out, goatish in form.  he could wiggle it and found the thing as a toy to help pass the time.<br />
<br />
After a space of time, eighteen months to be exact, Ken was transfered to Brazil. Sold as one does livestock, he was to become an erotic dancer in some private night club. It was there he lived day by day, eating scarps of food tossed at him from lusty members of a jeering audience.<br />
<br />
As with those who from drink or stupidity got too close, he did as before, raping them there in the night club. Infecting them of his female satyr goat juices, they who had sex with him/her, paid a deer price.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the pun but from my morale thinking if they treated Ken as lower than an animal, they had it coming. Actually I might consider that some actually wanted to become as beasts, acting all quite simular to the brutes.<br />
<br />
Ken was by our investigation returned, Reformed, and now can with his contracted funds, enter again the human society.<br />
<br />
It must take some toll, mental, physcial, and moral. As for anyone to be transitioned and become as an animal, some cost of personal self  must be part of the price.<br />
<br />
Our next subject will be of a young woman, she now freed after exceeding her contract time limit. Her accounting of the staff and their humoristic remarks tells much of those Un-professionals that do this type of work.</p>
