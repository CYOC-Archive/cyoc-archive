<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David Carlson was an avid jogger, a white male sporting well cut black hair and a nice runners build. Things were pretty rough for him lately however as he recently broke up with his girlfriend and it’s put a large amount of stress on him to the point where he decided to put in extra distance on his usual jog, hoping to work out the frustration. Unfortunately, David forgot to account for how much was left in his water bottle. With it now empty, the poor jogger was feeling the thirst hit him hard and the last thing he wanted was to suffer from a lack of hydration. Darting his head around to find a place to refill or grab a fresh drink, David could only find what looked like a weird convenience store filled with strange Knick-knacks that a nerdy role player would enjoy. The store had a sign that read “New RealiGulp drinks available.” David was skeptical at first since he never heard of the brand, but since he couldn’t find anywhere else to grab a drink, he decided he might as well give it a shot.<br />
<br />
Surprise was the first thing that came into his head when David saw the employees. One appeared to be male, but they also had breasts so large you could mistake him for a woman and the person at the front desk who said hello was not only dressed like a witch, but she appeared to be wearing the most realistic owl person costume he’s ever seen. The concern was dismissed when David saw the designs on the RealiGulp cups had people with similar appearances on them. “They must be dressed like that as part of the promotion”, he thought. As he was browsing all the different kinds of drinks, he noticed that all of the humanoids were all in very seductive poses and wearing very revealing clothing. The one that caught David’s attention the most however, was a drink called “Satyr-Shake”. The title was kinda misleading as only one of the Satyrs displayed on the cup had the features of a goat, the others had the lower body’s and features of other hoofed species. There was a male satyr that had the legs, tail and ears of a mighty equine stallion and another had the features of a donkey. A female that was also on the cup had the legs and features of a sheep. Another thing to note was that unlike the other cup designs, none of the satyrs were wearing any clothes, resulting in the males large cocks and the females pussies being visible. The only exceptions were the tops the females were wearing, which did a poor job at covering their tits, and one child satyr who was actually pretty well covered and had a more childish and playful appearance compared to the adults. <br />
<br />
Realizing how late it was starting to get, David grabbed the Satyr drink, paid the anthro owl at the counter and began to jog back home, failing to notice the store magically disappearing behind him. The first sip of the shake was mesmerizing, it had a flavor of well aged grape wine. “Pretty fitting for a Satyr themed drink”, David thought, unaware that the RealiGulp’s magic was already consuming him. His legs were forming fur around them with every sip he took. By the time he was halfway done with the shake, his track pants, shoes and shirt had faded away and revealed his lower legs covered in white fur that featured black stripes along with his build becoming even more fit and toned than it already was. David quickly tripped on the ground as his feet painlessly formed into hooves, he immediately got back up on his new appendages and resumed his jog like nothing happened. A zebras tail sprouted above his asshole and his ears also formed into zebra ones as they moved up to his head. By the time he finished the shake and threw the empty cup in a nearby trash can at the park, David felt a sudden rush as his libido spiked and he quickly knelt on the parks soft grass and began to stroke his still human cock that was beginning to grow along with his testicles.<br />
<br />
The humans in the park were first giving the zebra satyr weird looks, but the reality warping magic washed over them and the weird stares changed to rolling eyes as they accepted David’s masterbating as typical satyr behavior. After some more stroking, David’s cock and balls had turned black and grown to the size and shape as any other male equine and with a few more moans, he finally shot out a large rope of equine cum and with that, David Carlson was now a fully fledged zebra Satyr. <br />
<br />
“HEY! WATCH WHERE YOU’RE CUMMING!!” David immediately snapped out of his post nut bliss and his zebra cock went into his sheath when he noticed that his fluid had landed on a blonde women in her 40s that was sitting on a park bench reading a book. “Sorry!” He quickly replied as he resumed his jog back home, not noticing the women’s breasts were starting to expand and deer fur was forming around her legs as the reality changing magic from the zebra cum was beginning the process of making her a deer satyress that would be as contagious as David is. Once he arrived at his apartment, the interior and amenities had changed to accommodate for his new Satyr form. Sex toys were stored in the bedroom closet and the bathroom even had a dick pump for incase he felt the need to rut. Pictures of him with his family now featured David in all his zebra satyr glory while the others remained human, reality changing so that he was adopted into the family instead. He quickly took one last glance of a picture of him with his ex-girlfriend, “Why was I even angry?” David asked himself. Sally’s the idiot for wanting to take it slow with a satyr like me. The trotted over to the kitchen and began to cook dinner for himself.</p>
