<br />
Duncan had been glad when the ball was over and done with. He wasn’t too much into the whole royal balls or fancy suits, but he was one of the princes of the Tepes family, so he had to deal with those matters a lot of the time. At first he thought he would be able to enjoy his free time now away from everything, however his mother pulled the rug from under his feet only a few days later.<br />
<br />
“Mom, you can’t be serious, I have to what?” Duncan asked as he stood in front of his mother, Lady Kyra, who sat on her throne.<br />
<br />
“Duncan, Princess Isabella Salecio D’ombra di Venezia is a guest in our home and she’s personally requested that you show her around the manor and I expect her to have a good time and for you to be a good host to her.” Kyra said as she waved her finger towards her son.<br />
<br />
“But mom, can’t Brendan or Andrew do it? They’re more,” Duncan started to say.<br />
<br />
“More princely? Don’t goof around or play practical jokes on the family or staff? Duncan Tepes, you may have all the fun you want, but you need to take your role as prince of the Tepes family seriously sometimes.”<br />
<br />
“I know, but you know I’m not the most cut out for the job. I’m sure dad thinks so too.” Duncan said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
“Duncan, Duncan, my sweet boy. You need to show your father you can take the job of being a prince seriously, then he’ll see what a capable man you are. Now, let me just fix your hair a little, Princess Isabella will be here any moment.” Kyra said as she now brushed her son’s hair down a little.<br />
<br />
“Mom, please...” Duncan said slightly groaning.<br />
<br />
They heard footsteps and saw Princess Isabella approaching them.<br />
<br />
“Ah, Princess Isabella, how lovely to see you again.” Kyra said bowing towards the young woman.<br />
<br />
“Oh, thank you very much your highness,” Izzy said curtsying to Lady Kyra. “But please, I much prefer to be called Izzy.”<br />
<br />
“My apologies, my son Duncan, will be escorting you around the manor.” Kyra said motioning to Duncan who remained stiff before Kyra gave him a slight slap on the back and he bowed towards Izzy.<br />
<br />
“Uh...it...it will be my honor, I guess, uh....Princess....Izzy?” Duncan said being a little unsure on just how to address her.<br />
<br />
“Just Izzy will be alright, if I may just call you Duncan, your highness?” Izzy asked fidgeting a little while slightly looking at the floor.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah, I mean, yes please do so.” Duncan said while nodding.<br />
<br />
“Wonderful, have fun you two. I have to go see my husband on some political matters.” Kyra said leaving her son and Izzy alone in the room together.<br />
<br />
“Well, come along Izzy, I suppose I’ll show you around the manor.” Duncan said with a shrug.<br />
<br />
“As you wish your highness, sorry, I mean Duncan.” Izzy said as Duncan led the way out into the hallway.<br />
<br />
Over the years since becoming Lord and Lady of Tepes manor, Wyatt and Kyra had collected many pieces of art in their travels around the world. There were extravagant portraits and statues that lined the hallways of the manor. Duncan tried his best to recount to Izzy some of the history of some of the art in the hallways, but sometimes he fumbled with the stories.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry Duncan, did you say that this kitsune statue was created by a werewolf?” Izzy asked while trying not to giggle.<br />
<br />
“Well, I mean, maybe a werewolf created one of these statues, or maybe even painted one of these portraits.” Duncan said while trying not to blush.<br />
<br />
“Speaking of portraits, I like this one, I also like this cute little boy in here in the front.” Izzy teased pointing to a Tepes family portrait of the family as the siblings all looked to be very young children.<br />
<br />
“I can just barely remember this one. My parents wanted us all too look nice for the portrait and had me and my brothers in suits with our sisters in dresses. Nyx and Andromeda loved it, Andrew thought he looked handsome in a suit, I guess Brendan liked it. As for me, eh, it was never my thing.” Duncan explained as Izzy nodded at his words.<br />
<br />
“I know what you mean, as papà’s only daughter I’m always have to get dolled up for stuff, I prefer clothes that make me feel more free rather than restrained to sitting in a chair all day.” Izzy said as Duncan nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, can’t say I picture you attending tea parties and stuff. I like visiting the other realms and meeting some of the people there, but I could never get through all the...delegation talks or political stuff, I’d rather just be able to enjoy my freedom and keep my title of prince.” Duncan said as the girl nodded before seeing another portrait of Duncan and his siblings.<br />
<br />
Izzy looked to see that the siblings looked to be in their preteens here and began to see Duncan’s more free spirited side show in his chosen attire for the family portrait. Izzy couldn’t help but notice something peculiar and thought to ask Duncan.<br />
<br />
“Tell me Duncan, why is it that your sister Nyx looks like she does today in this portrait when your earlier one shows her to look more...well, lively I suppose is the word.” Izzy asked as she saw Duncan looking a little sad now.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, that’s meant more for family ears only. Let’s just say Nyx had a bad day once.” Duncan explained as he now looked lost in thought.<br />
<br />
“Duncan, did you know one of my brothers and I were involved in a race recently?” Izzy asked as Duncan raised his eyebrow at her.<br />
<br />
“Um, no, I guess I didn’t. Who won?”<br />
<br />
“Well, it was a pretty close tie, so we came in neck and neck!” Izzy answered with a smile as Duncan began laughing and understanding that she had just made a joke.<br />
<br />
“Do you know another one?” Duncan now asked with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Do you have a favorite kind of fruit?” Izzy asked.<br />
<br />
“Not really, what’s yours?”<br />
<br />
“Neck-tarine!” Izzy answered as they both went into a little laugh.<br />
<br />
“Hey, you know what? I know a few things we can do that are just as funny.” Duncan said as Izzy was now curious as to what they were doing.<br />
<br />
Duncan and Izzy stopped by his room where he ran in quickly and got out a few bottles of glue. Izzy was still unsure of just what they were doing but followed him anyway. They arrived at a little patio area outside and he instructed her to squeeze some glue onto the opposite side of the chair, to which she did so. The chairs were white so the glue didn’t really show unless you looked carefully at it. Duncan then had the two of them hide and wait. Soon enough they heard Duchess and Cassandra coming by with tea in their hands to sit down.<br />
<br />
“I can hardly believe the commotion that happened with Princess Nyx and that kitsune.” Duchess said taking her seat.<br />
<br />
“I know, I can’t recall anyone from the kitsune realm being invited to the ball. Though Nyx did turn out to be safe, so at least nothing too serious happened.” Cassandra commented.<br />
<br />
“Although we were serious on the dance floor and no one seemed to notice, or when we snuck away to the bathroom. Several of the other ladies came in to see us though.” Duchess smiled with a chuckle as Cassanda smiled back and puckered her lips towards Duchess.<br />
<br />
“Follow my lead.” Duncan whispered to Izzy as she smiled and nodded.<br />
<br />
“So do you think it was okay to leave that thing in Duchess and Cassandra’s room, Izzy?” Duncan asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes Duncan, I’m sure they’ll be very surprised when they see what we left them in their quarters.” Izzy smirked as they walked by the table loud enough for Duchess and Cassandra to hear them. Duchess and Cassandra now looked at each other with a little worry.<br />
<br />
“Do you think he did?” Duchess asked Cassandra.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t doubt he might have.” Cassandra said as she and Duchess got up and found their chairs rising with them.<br />
<br />
“Duncan!” Cassandra and Duchess shouted as they heard Duncan and Izzy running off with a little laughter.<br />
<br />
Duncan and Izzy now made their way to the Tepes library where Duncan’s brother, Brendan, was trying to do some reading. While being behind a bookshelf, Duncan and Izzy quietly replaced the books with print, with books that were completely blank. Brendan went to grab one book as he put another back and got out the book he just grabbed to open it, only find it blank, then he went to another book, only to find that one blank as well and the ones after that.<br />
<br />
“Duncan!” Brendan shouted as he knew his brother was somewhere nearby.<br />
<br />
Now the two pranksters made their way outside to where they saw Hanako sitting on the ground meditating. Duncan and Izzy made their way up to a spot where they would be directly standing over Hanako and used a bucket of water they had filled and began to tilt the bucket down towards Hanako.<br />
<br />
“It sounds like someone nearby is playing a practical joke on me, and if they think it won’t get them in trouble, then they should know I will make them do months of hard training in the rain if a prank is pulled on me!” Hanako shouted loudly as Duncan now looked worried as the water was about to fall onto Hanako’s head.<br />
<br />
Izzy felt bad that their prank might result in Duncan getting punished, so she ran as fast as she could down below and pushed Hanako out of the way of the water and instead getting herself wet.<br />
<br />
“Why Princess Isabella, I see our illustrious Prince Duncan as doused you in water. Would you like me to see that he’s punished?” Hanako asked Izzy as she stood there wet.<br />
<br />
“Oh! No, please, he...he didn’t mean anything, I only...saw you about to get poured with water and came to your rescue.” Izzy said.<br />
<br />
“Very well, I thank you for your rescue, but it appears your clothes are soaked. I’ll help you find another one.” Hanako offered.<br />
<br />
“Uh...actually Auntie Hanako, I’ll help her find some clean clothes to wear.” Duncan offered from up above. Hanako sighed at Duncan calling her by that term, but let it pass.<br />
<br />
“Very well young man, but I hope your pranks are through for the day.” Hanako said as Duncan made his way down over to Izzy.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, I forgot my Auntie Hanako doesn’t particularly like my pranks.” Duncan apologized as Izzy was shivering a little bit as Duncan gave her a towel he picked up along the way.<br />
<br />
Duncan and Izzy made their way over to Andromeda and Nyx’s bedroom. As the girls were away visiting their aunt and uncle. Miss Cheyenne happened to be in the room and was surprised to see the two of them there, especially the wet princess.<br />
<br />
“Why Princess Isabella, is that you? you’re absolutely soaked, don’t tell me, Duncan did this?” Miss Cheyenne asked glaring over at Duncan who looked ashamed.<br />
<br />
“Yes, but it was an accident, the prank was....meant for someone else. Do you think you could help me find something to wear? Duncan still has to show me around the rest of the manor.” Izzy asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, Princess Andromeda has been wanting to give away some of her old dresses she doesn’t wear anymore. I’ll help you pick one out, Master Duncan, please wait outside.” Miss Cheyenne said as Duncan nodded.<br />
<br />
“Oh uh—it doesn’t need to be anything fancy.” Izzy tried to say but was guided into the room by the other vampire.<br />
<br />
Duncan was still feeling guilty for pouring the water over Izzy, even though she hadn’t been the one intended for the prank, it still surprised him that she took the prank to get Duncan out of trouble. He had been having a great time with Izzy, but now he thought the time for pranks was over and he needed to do something nice for her.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, Izzy emerged from the bedroom wearing a beautiful long, pale pink bouffant dress with trumpet sleeves and boat neck neckline. Her strawberry blonde hair was dried and styled in a crown braid.<br />
<br />
“Wow, that was one of my sister’s? It...it looks amazing on you, Princess Isabe....I’m sorry, I mean Izzy.” Duncan said blushing a little as Izzy blushed too.<br />
<br />
“T-Thank you Duncan, I thought it might be a little much…do you think we could go somewhere for a little fun?” Izzy said thanking Duncan with a shy smile.<br />
<br />
“Actually, I think we should....go somewhere....really nice. Just excuse me, I need to ask Miss Cheyenne something.” Duncan said as he stepped in the room to speak privately with Miss Cheyenne.<br />
<br />
“Miss Cheyenne, what’s a....lovely place to go on to palace grounds? I want Izzy’s day to end better than how it’s gone.” Duncan asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, I would say our rose garden maze, that has a beautiful fountain in the middle of it. You remember, you got lost yourself there once while playing with your mother.” Miss Cheyenne suggested as he recalled the event from his childhood.<br />
<br />
“Thank you miss Cheyenne, you’re a life saver.” Duncan thanked as Miss Cheyenne went back to searching through Andromeda’s clothes she didn’t want anymore.<br />
<br />
The day was now coming to an end and night was fast approaching. Duncan took Izzy to the Tepes family’s rose garden maze out in the back. Over the years, Lisa had made the garden for her family to enjoy, it was also in a way, her apology to Wyatt and Kyra for her earlier actions before she was welcomed back into the family.<br />
<br />
“There’s a fountain in the middle, but it’s a little hard to find.” Duncan said as Izzy now rushed towards the maze.<br />
<br />
“Then I guess you’ll have to find the fountain and me Duncan!” Izzy shouted happily as she ran through the maze in her dress, Duncan now chased after her and tried to listen to where she might be, but when he ended up where he thought she was, she had vanished. It took Duncan several minutes to eventually get into the middle where Izzy was sitting on the fountain feeling the water with her finger.<br />
<br />
“It’s about time you got here.” Izzy teased.<br />
<br />
Duncan now made his way over the fountain and sat down beside her.<br />
<br />
“Izzy, I’m...I’m sorry that I poured water on you earlier, I hope it hasn’t ruined your day.” Duncan apologized.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Prince Duncan, it hasn’t ruined my day at all. In fact, you’ve made my day. Most of the time, Princes from other families that I meet will usually talk forever about themselves and never let me get a word in edge wise. But you prefer the more carefree way of royal life and I’ve...never met someone who feels the same way I do like that.” Izzy explained as Duncan smiled at her as she smiled back.<br />
<br />
“It’s...it’s a really nice night, maybe we should back...” Duncan said before Izzy grabbed his face and kissed him on the lips, which surprised him, but he returned the kiss all the same.<br />
<br />
“I’ve had a really good time today Duncan, but I must be getting back to my quarters. Thank you for the kiss.” Izzy said as Duncan was still amazed at the kiss they shared.<br />
<br />
“I...I....I think...I’m in love?” Duncan said to himself as he now lay down on the fountain contemplating his day with Izzy over in his mind.</p>
