<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The choices went on and on so eventually you just slid the screen back to the start. There, cow was the one your eye fell on first and it seemed simple enough.  Touching the screen to make your choice, there is a cute &#39;moo&#39; that comes as a screen with options comes up, catching you somewhat off guard.<br />
<br />
The image of the cow on screen is somewhat pixelated and the choices started to narrate when you go to read.<br />
<br />
&quot;Choose your heifer&#39;s milk productivity,&quot; it says.<br />
<br />
With little worry, you decide to go for broke and choose the largest.  Might as well make a cow that&#39;s useful for more than just  calves, you reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Choose your breed cycle,&quot; it said with choices lighting below.<br />
<br />
Standard was 9 and options went down to Accelerated Plus Plus, which was merely 60 days. Again, you know the more useful the animal, the better their chance of dying of old age.  You can&#39;t help but feel for this cow you figure you&#39;ll get a print out picture of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Name your heifer,&quot; with a text box appearing.<br />
<br />
Thinking for a moment, you remember a girl you used to know that was pretty big, both in the gut and chest, and you smirk, typing in &#39;Bessie&#39; which seemed fitting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Final question, choose fertility rate,&quot; the voice said.<br />
<br />
You blush as the choices come up.  The choices start at Hard and go to Heated, with percentages listed to the right in parenthesis. You couldn&#39;t but laugh, as &#39;Heated&#39; provided a &#39;99.98%&#39; chance of prize.  While you could have wanted a challenge, you figure you&#39;re already maxed out on other stats so why not go for the rest and at least walk out with a prize.   Even if you only just deserve it for picking the easy choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agree to your heifer,&quot; the screen says, listing your choices just above a spotted cow with a large belly, udder and hearts coming from the rear. You hit, &#39;Agree&#39;. &quot;Thank you. Bull &#39;Stanley&#39; being called to main stable. Please, stand straight and look ahead at red light.&quot;<br />
<br />
With no reason not to listen, you do as you&#39;re told.  Two slots open in the wall in front of you as you&#39;re somewhat disoriented by the light.  Two mechanical arms come out, one clamping a thick ring to you nose and the other clipping a yellow tag to your ear.  You cry out in pain and stumble back.  Touching your nose and ear, there is a dribble of blood down your ear and your nose is sore. The tag is loose enough for you to pull it over enough to read.<br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;Heifer (Bessie), Producer, 99.98. 60 day&#39;&quot; you read while a cold sweat suddenly crops up over your whole body. Your clothes are quickly damp and your wiping your sleeve and stumbling backward. There are mechanical sounds around you that ring in your ears. Tugging at the tag again, you notice it reaches further in front of you as it seemed the flesh had started to elongate.  At first you think it&#39;s the tag but then you feel something similar on the other side. Your heart starts to race.<br />
<br />
Your nostrils flare, at first trying desperately just to breathe with the steel obstruction now hanging heavy from it. Soon you were more able, but you couldn&#39;t see that it was because you nose had started to change.  Looking just vaguely bovine with it&#39;s widening. This, though, is lost on you compared to the sudden hardness that had taken your cock.  Your jeans were tight and quickly stained as before you could even hold back, you orgasmed harder than you have in ages. It lasted longer than any however, as you continued to ejaculate as if your body needed to get out every drop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Incorrect gender detected.  Adjusting and augmenting to continue changes,&quot; said a voice that was more human than recording for a change. You wanted to call out but your voice caught in your throat as the last drip of seed emptied from your cock and tightness now gripped your waist.  <br />
<br />
You are suddenly very away that your belt is struggling while the button at the front of your jeans is taxed to the limit. You put your hands to your hips and waist to try and keep it together but you could feel the flesh beneath gaining mass.  There was no amount of restraint that could stop that.  Moving your hands around, your ass to had swollen and you blush hard and gasp when the seam down the back splits and only your taught boxers are keeping your dignity in tact.<br />
<br />
&quot;99.98, huh?&quot; tisked the voice like the bearded ticket seller from the beginning.  &quot;Might as well welcome you to the farm, Bessie,&quot; followed by a laugh.<br />
<br />
Your belt finally snaps off and you close your eyes, somehow trying to think your way out of it.  Your hands retreat from your split up closer to your back and there your fingers stop.  They feel something wiggling underneath.  Curious, you try and get your fingers on it and miss at first but when you finally do get it, squeezing hard, you let out a deformed yelp.  The appendages seems attached to you. Your bowels gurgle and jaw and face are starting to get pulled into the soreness that has already taken your nose.<br />
<br />
Opening your eyes, you see the beginnings of snout and then, following a twinge of pain in your gut, you clench your ass as hard as you can. In doing so, you tighten your fists and dig in your feet, knowing you cannot possibly do what your body feels like doing right now. When trying to just unclench your hands, you&#39;re unable.  Looking down, you see the fingers merged and starting to grow heavy with the beginnings of hooves.<br />
<br />
If you were in doubt, or denial, there was little way to argue things now. The weight of your hands, pulling you forward to the ground, was more than just heaviness.  Some echoing voice and force tugged at your shoulders and arms too.  Indeed, the bones were growing and bringing the straw floor even closer.  With your gentiles aching, gut churning, and shirt feeling constricting, staying on just two legs was lost in the shuffle.<br />
<br />
You clattered forward, clumsily.  Your shirt rips in places while your jeans do the same, with the seams barely holding together. You moan, your jaw saw and the pain only dissipating when the sudden sensation of your tail wiggling free to the air hit you. Your pelvis started to crack, bones shifting and bulging from your skin .  You feel dizzy, tears running down your puffing cheeks.  Brain trying to put it together and even though it&#39;s obvious, in your heated mind it still can&#39;t quite justify what&#39;s happening.<br />
<br />
The zipper and button of your jeans, having done a noble job, finally tore and popped off respectively, your boxers giving way as well to a sudden dangling heaviness between your back legs.  Looking under, you see your balls have swollen considerably and hang more forward.  Weirdly, they had merged into one and in doing so, along with added growth, had taken your cock up too.  It hung, misshapen, and odder still, there looked like several more budding deformities growing to match. Veins and even a light fuzz were spreading over the surface while the sack itself start to fill. Of course, you realized what was happening.<br />
<br />
Despite that, you try and wiggle your cock like you knew you always could.  Instead of any movement from what now used to be your cock, now teat, you got the oddest tingle from a place near your taint. While you had watched your nose push away and tail sprout, a small slit had been forming that now, bent over, was more swollen bovine sex than anything male, or human. Only now, with the womb and ovaries starting to take shape along with the rest of your organs, do you really understand what you&#39;ve done.<br />
<br />
Above your new gender, a puckering and swollen asshole was letting out small puffs of methane.  Your tail was starting to sprout it&#39;s tuft and your shoes finally tore open, revealing similar changes to your hands. It&#39;s hard to balance with your weight still growing and every breath spreading your ribs further without them retracting. Even your neck is starting to hurt.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s then, among all the other sensations going over your body, that the one you were trying to focus on most was lost. Your asshole opened, with only a few, wet- but massive- turds filled your already maxed boxers. Sobbing, you know you can&#39;t hold it anymore and just relax.  A torrent of cow shit quickly fills what&#39;s left of the spaces in your clothes before bursting them and slopping to the ground between your hind legs.  Soon five, six, and then seven and finally ten pounds of shit are piled behind you, a smelly beacon to your poor decisions.<br />
<br />
After a spurt of hot, hormones heated urine, you move away from the shame that still plops from your rear.<br />
<br />
In the distance, there was a thunder of hooves followed by snorts.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Bull &#39;Stanley&#39; has arrived,&quot; a male voice announces loudly, followed by, in a softer voice,  &quot;Is subject far enough along you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
That comment was lost when your udder started to rub against the ground beneath you.  This was followed by a rumble of your stomach, which had now multiplied, and caused it somewhat fatter tongue to wet. Something you had failed to notice before, a trough full of feed, was placed near the wall near a large pale of water. <br />
<br />
You don&#39;t even think, your hooves move, slowly, and you find your head looking down at what is certainly feed. Telling yourself you only needed a bite to clear your thoughts, you shut your somewhat bulging eyes and open your mouth.  The feed fills your still growing snout, somewhat shakily and after a chew with only some changed teeth, you swallow. Still, your mind aches.  Another bite turns into ten, and you&#39;ve put on close to 700 pounds in the last ten minutes.<br />
<br />
From the rear, you were a heifer in heat, with quite the swollen udder that was now starting to leak milk onto the ground; the steels grates taking it in.  Your head, though deformed, is still fairly human, as your hair and features were still holding on. For now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Subject &#39;Bessie&#39;, prepare for your contest to begin,&quot; said the ticket man, from some place where he was obviously watching you.  And he wasn&#39;t alone either.<br />
<br />
You tried to speak but a guttural bellow was all that started to form so you shut your snout and closed your eyes.  Your pained ears, now hanging low and looking bovine, picked up on a sliding door at the opposite end of the room.  Soon, hooves and snorts followed and started to come closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You chose a very interesting path,&quot; the voice says to you while the hooves get closer.  &quot;The game is if your mate there get a bullseye, and gets you knocked up, you win a trip to our farm for the rest of your life.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Your eyes shoot open and you forgo any silence.  Protesting, nothing but bellows and vague &#39;Moo&#39;s came out of your mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most GIRLS who come here just want a quick, interesting experience.  You, my boy, seem to want to serve the Lord by making our farm plentiful.  Thank you, unless you&#39;re very, very... lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, while you were lost in his words, a wet snout pressed into your swollen sex that you only just now felt. Soon there was a tongue at it, and you didn&#39;t know whether to be turned on or disgusted.  Looking back, you saw a massive pull, similarly nose ringed and ear tagged. <br />
<br />
You were trying to read the tag but only made it to &#39;Bull &#39;Stanley&#39; before the voice cut in.<br />
<br />
&quot;He chose like you, except her took the path his gender dictated.  His fertility rate, I should mention, is also 99.98%.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, and before you could even think to moo another protest, there is a wight on your hind quarters and you see Stanley starting to mount you.  You. You are being mounted by a bull and as you feel the sudden prodding at your rear, you realize you&#39;re fucked.<br />
<br />
The bull finds his mark and pushed in, hard, and you are trying to process it but fail.  Milk is oozing out of you and with every inch of bull cock pushed, your face pushes out.  When he finally buries it all, your body can&#39;t help but tense, allowing you to feel all two feet of bull penis now shoved in your heifer body.  Your snout now in, the successively thrusts send ripples through your body, seemingly urging the changes on. Your old teeth fall under hoof as new fatter ones grow in around the fat tongue that licks the length of it all.<br />
<br />
As a brown and white fur takes over you, cameras flash, and a recorded voice says, &quot;Physical changes, complete.  Mental pending conception.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, physically speaking, you were a 1,276 pound heifer, with just over a hundred of that udder weight. Your mind was all you had left and all that could feel was the bull and the power he had over, and on, you. You hardly felt the minutes tick by until pushed deep as he could and shot his load, pumping so much into you that it wasn&#39;t long before it was leaking out of the back of you.<br />
<br />
More followed when the bull dismounted, trotting off to eat feel while your backside was left used.<br />
<br />
The door opened at last but even if you wanted to, you were too wide to fit now.  The bearded man looked at you, smirked, and walked around behind you.  There he put on a long plastic glove that stretched nearly to his shoulder. You lost sight of him but then you felt his fingers and soon a hand at your still sore cunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to find out if you&#39;re a winner, and get to on a permanent vacation, or you walk out of here on two legs,&quot; he send, trusting his arm into your sex.  Soon, his entire shoulder was in you.  &quot;Even if you do beat the odds and turn back, you&#39;ll never forget bull cock in you.  Or this,&quot; he said, starting to inspect you.<br />
<br />
Your head dropped and in front of you was the feed. Part of you was hungry, and the other wanted to run out of here on two feet. It was only the feeling of the arm being removed from you, that you looked away from the feed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, guess I got my answer,&quot; the man said, his arm dripping with excessive juice from you.</p>
