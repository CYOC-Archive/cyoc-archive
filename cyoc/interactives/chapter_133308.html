<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Omg like babe, so glad to finally be with ya!” Johnny spoke in a lisp, as he flipped his long gorgeous platinum blonde locks over his petit silver earrings. His cute button nose and red lipstick donned his twinkish facial features with ocean blue eyes beaming in delight.<br />
<br />
His body was slender, as he wore a bare pink tank top with the words GAY PRIDE in rainbow glitter on top. A jersey shore tan donned his slender body, as his finger nails glittered in purple manicure.<br />
<br />
His small package is encased under pinkish briefs, which is encased over a purple spandex shorts. Wearing bright light tan sandals, the twink giggled as he leaned over his boyfriend, being a short 5ft 6 while his boyfriend was a 5ft 11.<br />
<br />
“Same Johnny, so glad to meet you in person.” Davy responded, his curly orange beard filling up his pouchy face. The red head had curls growing down the back of his head, he had a pudgy nose and framed squared specs which encased his light green splendor-with freckles having decor his cheeks.<br />
<br />
He wore a large red checkered-rolled up sleeved flannel which barely fit his huge gut. Moobs over the muscle in his pecs with average long arms, filled with explosions of hair wherever he went.<br />
<br />
He wore some loose fitting jeans, supporting his fat and girthed up member underneath those large boxers-although not of a straight brand. His feet was encased in some leather shoes as he leaned down briefly and kissed his babe on the cheek.<br />
<br />
The two of them lived far apart,met online over Tinder and hit it off right away. Despite the two of them being different in apparel and looks, they were like soulmates-understanding towards one another due to both of them getting severely bullied by jocks, who eventually signed onto the army after the graduation.<br />
<br />
“They hated conservatives, which fueled their liberal lust.” The voice smirked, it sought them out and smirked, as it decided to use their past to their advantage-turning into the very things they despise.<br />
————<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!” Johnny spoke, as they arrived at the old gay pride parade-which was now labelled “Christian Pride”. The twinkle twink starred in shock, as he clutched his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god!” Davy spoke, which was ironic as it was a “Christian” gathering-or at least the hateful ones. He wanted to grab hold of Johnny and flee, but—<br />
<br />
“ATTENTION FAGGOTS!”<br />
<br />
The both of them froze in their positions, next to one another as their bodies were no longer theirs but the curse’s, and the army sergeant to some degree. <br />
<br />
Marcus Gospel came out of the shadows, crossing his arms at the two gays having pitched tents at the sight of each other-which rose even higher the moment they saw Marcus. The poster boy of a homophobic jock who became an army sergeant.<br />
<br />
The two of them tried to scream, but their mouths were glued shut. They could not disobey the sergeant, as the curse made way to transform them into their new roles.<br />
<br />
“FAGGOTS! DROP AND GIVE ME TWENTY!”<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, the two recruits dropped to the floor, getting ready in push-up position as their respective arms struggled to follow the commands, but felt extremely compelled to do so.<br />
<br />
With the first push-up, the two of them were nearly out of breath, as though its killing the unhealthy gays in them. They winced and are already in sweat, as though they’ve been in the hot sun for ages.<br />
<br />
For Johnny, the sun melted the jersey shore tan he sprayed on, as it dripped onto the floor, revealing a new fresh tan-sun cooked naturally. For Davy, his pale white skin sizzled as the milky white gave way to a healthy tan as well.<br />
<br />
Two, they somehow managed to do two, not noticing the swell in their muscles, becoming mildly easier than the first impossible round. Their cores tightened, Davy’s fat melting bit by bit and Johnny’s soft tummy constrained deeper as hints of stones already can be seen thanks to the curse. Its only twenty...its only twent—-<br />
<br />
“BACK TO ONE FAGGOTS! DROP, COUNT AND GIVE ME FIFTY!”<br />
<br />
“ONE!” With that command by their drill sergeant, their mouths immediately opened, as their mind snapped. Realizing they disobeyed their commander in charge for not counting while doing their push-ups.<br />
<br />
“TWO, THREE!” Each round becoming much easier, and determined, partially not wanting to do more than fifty and partly enjoying the exercise-ad though they’ve been doing it in their entire life.<br />
<br />
As they continued to bellow, their legs expanded, both stretching long and of their same lengths. Their torsos did the same, despite having different body masses as of this moment-both of them reaching a hefty 6ft 3. Which was above the Marcus gospels’s height and will grow to be much taller in a few years shortly.<br />
<br />
The two of them regressed in age, gaining a more youthful but much tougher sheen than they has previously. Both were initially in their late twenties but as they were under the new sergeant-they became much younger, respect your authority figures and elders-said the bible.<br />
<br />
“TWENTY FIVE!” <br />
<br />
The two of them felt testosterone churning in them, as their biceps swelled massively, Davy losing fat and both of them gaining incredible muscle mass. They internally smirked, as their palms and arms became larger and larger-swift hairs appearing on their killer guns as their palms grew rough and tough, fingers stretching and pulling as though they have lifted weights and played sports for their entire life.<br />
<br />
“THIRTY FIVE!”<br />
<br />
Their shoulders widened, as their shirts RIP in satisfaction. Johnny’s petite back took on a huge domineering size like Davy’s did, traps rising as his newly formed muscles flexed in bliss, loving to show how tough he is-which is completely contrary to his once petit and lanky bod. <br />
<br />
The flat chest and moobs each of them respectively had firmed up and PUSHED OUT! Tearing away the below average fabric as it revealed their hard-earned, bowling ball sized pecs. As their core bursts in response, revealing cocky eight packs despite just barely hitting nineteen. <br />
<br />
No steroids but ton of muscle training.<br />
<br />
“FORTY FIVE!” They both bellowed, as their voices deepened from lisps and gay slang, vocal chords shifting and breaking to permeant bass. Hollering and shouting on the football field eradicated gay musicals and drama as their voices seemed more appropriate in a war than in performance.<br />
<br />
Sudden flush of Pride echoed in them, as their respective Adam’s apples grew hard and prominent. Adam means Man, MAN APPLE, so they gotta act more like men.<br />
<br />
THEY ARE MEN<br />
<br />
The men that once bullied them shifted to brothers in arms. From barely running away from the bullies to successfully tackling the opponents team and receiving the footballs for quarterback to land the touchdown. They both were expert linebackers, and runners and literally everything, cause they worked hard in sports, even though they barely passed high school.<br />
<br />
Their thighs grew tight , Johnny’s spandex broke which revealed his way-larger, enormous bulge in those pink briefs...in which he now found the colour pink not manly enough for him. While as Davy’s newfound rival muscles struggled in his uncomfortable pair of jeans, having more muscle than he had fat previously.<br />
<br />
The two of them almost heaved a sigh of relief, as they ate about to hit the fifty mark and be done with it. But like how mark was raised up-<br />
<br />
“INAPPROPRIATE ATTIRE FAGGOTS! ANOTHER FIFTY!” The sergeant ruthlessly bellowed into their ears, starring them down as they-without question, continued their push up spree.<br />
<br />
“FIFTY ONE, FIFTY TWO, FIFTY THREE!”<br />
<br />
The two hollered, partially out of rage that they were being punished like that, and rage for some reason dressing like fags. The old them hated the drill sergeant, the new them saw it as justified, no gays were allowed into their unit!<br />
<br />
As they continued their pushups, their groins naturally thrusted into the air, like they were topping chicks. Becoming much longer and increasing in girth like how an American army man should be like-or at least the stereotype.<br />
<br />
Their butts rounded, as they completely destroyed their own undergarments as it revealed their tight asses, matching to each other and a steady rivalry with Marcus’s.<br />
<br />
As they briefly turned their heads at one another, any concern they had for the other shifted to boyish rivalry-seeing who can do the most push ups up to 100 first to show who was manlier between the two, and who gets the girl first.<br />
<br />
“SIXTY FIVE-SIXTY SIX!”<br />
<br />
They were playing no games, as their undergarments reshaped themselves to identical jockstraps, XL and of a famous sporting good brand. Taking care of their well endowed members as their respective body hairs get maintained, not overly hairy but not hairless-with a treasure trail trailing downwards to their pubic bush area, with nicely aligned fur hitting their pits and pectoral areas, and handsome lines trailing their arms and feet.<br />
<br />
The broken spandex grew much longer on Johnny’s thighs, growing downward as they shifted to a more durable material. Same with Davy as, like with Johnny, dark green fatigues matching with their drill sergeant appeared all around their new cargo army pants.<br />
<br />
With their feet much huger, even for Davy. They grew to be size 13s fit for stomping and in the commando line of the battlefield. As the respective unfitting sandals and tight fitting leather shoes shifted to large black army boots from the US army.<br />
<br />
“EIGHTY NINE!”<br />
<br />
Their shirts took on a different toll, as Johnny’s singlet turned plain starch green, with those glitter letters of GAY PRIDE falling off onto his tight waist-materialising an army uniform with Marcus’s unit insignia wrapped around his waist.<br />
<br />
Davy’s however, materialised a white tank top beneath his broken down flannel, as the flannel shifted starch green and turned into the army uniform identical Johnny’s. Both of their respective uniforms also had their new heterosexual names on them, almost completely taking over.<br />
<br />
“NINETY NINE!” <br />
<br />
In the final act of their old selves, they turned again to once another, partly grinning cockily while bitterly bidding the other goodbye. As their faces squared out, tying the similarity between the both of them closer as though they really were not different at all.<br />
<br />
Johnny’s silver earrings fell as the holes that were made on his ears sealed up, falling down and looping around his neck as silver earring materialised into a cross and a pair of dog tags respectively.<br />
<br />
Davy grimaced but managed to force a smile internally, even the old part of him was happy, at least the two of them were still united, even in a heterosexual homophobic army way. He tried to recall the old Johnny, but memories of the two of them roughhousing each other since young surfaced-as his new cocky self did not intend to lose to his twin bro.<br />
<br />
His facial hair got shaved off, turning into aftershave as it was barely accepted in the army-but still is. It made him look gruffer, like one of those movie actors on screen-or those veterans after war. His shave turned dark brown and so did his hair, as his freckles faded away to pure caucasian. Spotting a crewcut on top, sides completely buzzed off-his very own specs fell and surrounded his neck to form a cross and dog tags similar to Johnny’s.<br />
<br />
He blinked his eyes, as the green faded to hazel, and his facial features broadened out, gone was the old Davy.<br />
<br />
Johnny looked at his now ex-boyfriend one last time, mind reeling at the thought of even having a boyfriend. Noticing the new face starring back at him, Johnny’s new self cannot help but smirk back.<br />
<br />
His own facial features manned up, developing aftershave like his bro but managing clean shave most of it except the important parts near his upper and lower lip-it was his style, and he knew the ladies loved it.<br />
<br />
His long blonde locks got buzzed off with one ZZZZZT! Leaving his top shaved in a buzzcut as if killing off the last of the gay, real men had short hair-or even shorter till there’s barely any! His new conservative self took over, as he blinked his eyes to a new hazel, as his hair roots shifted from blonde to dark brown.<br />
<br />
“100!”<br />
<br />
“GOOD JOB MAGGOTS! YOU ERADICATED THE FAGS!”<br />
<br />
“THANK YOU SERGEANT!”<br />
<br />
The two of them got up, saluted their drill sergeant and then one another. Almost looking at mirrors aside their slightly different army styles, but manly nonetheless.<br />
<br />
In fact, Johnny question what he saw in Davy, he was as buff and as muscular as his bro anyway, why the heck would he be attracted to him? What was he-GHEY? Jonathan was not gay, never was.<br />
<br />
Likewise, Davy had a extreme thing for petite WOMEN. Thinking his twin was a twink and had a curvier body than them? HAHA FUCK NO! They were real men and pussyhounds, that’s why they joined the army! David is proud to serve his country.<br />
<br />
Privates Jonathan and David smirked as they shook hands with one another, their dog tags reading “NO FAGS” on Jonathan and “ALLOWED ARMY” on David, read together as “NO FAGS ALLOWED ARMY” as that’s their motto with Marcus Gospel-their commander in charge.<br />
<br />
An intricate cross and their units insignia bore on their right and left cross respectively. They were Marcus’s prized christian recruits, being heavily obedient and football jocks like he was back in high school,<br />
<br />
With that, like David and Jonathan in the bible, the soul tie between them strengthened more than over. Dedicated to serve their country.</p>
