<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I want to be a shepherd, mom. German Shepherd.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure thing.&quot; <br />
Jamie typed on the Chronivac. &quot;How old do you want to be?&quot;<br />
&quot;Umm... as old as I am now, I think. 19.&quot;<br />
His mom giggled. &quot;I think they mean it in dog years. Let&#39;s make you... 2.5 years old. It&#39;s on the edge of maturity for German Shepherds. Next question: what gender do you want to be, Jeff?&quot;<br />
Jeff blinked. &quot;Uhh, male, of course.&quot;<br />
His mom chuckled. &quot;Figured. Now for reality alter details... whoa. This thing...&quot; She trailed off, looking at the options. &quot;You know what? I want to choose myself on this one, okay?&quot;<br />
&quot;What were you thinking, mom?&quot;<br />
Jamie smirked. &quot;I&#39;ll set it so everyone, besides you and me, will think you were always a dog. Let&#39;s say... we adopted you when your were a puppy. Okay?&quot;<br />
Jeff thought about it. &quot;Hmm. And that way, no one will think anything is sttange, so I&#39;ll get to hang out with them more easily and naturaly...<br />
&quot;Sure, mom. What&#39;s next?&quot;<br />
His mom looked over all the details. &quot;Lots of jibber-jabber, like fur color, lentgh and height, weight... I&#39;ll just set all to &#39;Average&#39;, alright? Hmm, and there&#39;s this one... the mental changes.&quot; She looked at Jeff, eyeing him. &quot;What are you saying, Jeff?&quot;<br />
Jeff stuttered. &quot;I don&#39;t know... I mean, I... I want to stay myself, right? Uhh...&quot;<br />
His mom grinned as she got an idea. &quot;I think I got it. I&#39;ll let you stay pretty much the same, but I&#39;ll add some... canine instincts to your brain. Not anything serious, just stuff like knowing how to walk as a dog - you know, on all fours - and such. Okay?&quot;<br />
Jeff nodded. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s probably a good idea.&quot;<br />
His mom smiled. &quot;It&#39;s all set, then. Let&#39;s start it!&quot;<br />
She clicked on the button, giggling like a little girl. &quot;Oh, forgot to tell you - I&#39;ve set it so your transformation will take a few minutes to finish. I think it&#39;s the most fun.&quot;<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t felt anything. &quot;I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s... wha-&quot; his eyes widened as he looked at his hands. His thumbs were shrinking, and his fingers become shorter. His nails lenghened, becoming claws. Brown fur started spreading along his 4-digited hand, and up across his arms.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s crazy!&quot;<br />
His mom laughed, enjoying the show. &quot;How&#39;s having paws, Jeff?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just so bizzare.&quot; Jeff stared at his new paws, then tried to grab the Chronivac, but he just couldn&#39;t grab it with his paws. <br />
&quot;What are you doing, Jeff? Dogs cant lift things up with their claws. And why do you want it anyway?&quot;<br />
&quot;I forgot to ask you for how long this change is going to last.&quot;<br />
His mom grinned. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about that. I set it so whenever I choose to, I can turn you back.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. Okay then.&quot;<br />
While they were talking, the changes spread quicly along Jeff&#39;s arms, making them bend and stretch. Black and brown fur sprouted ll over them.<br />
&quot;Whoa, I...&quot; Jeff tried moving his changed arms.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s harder to move them?&quot; Jamie giggled. &quot;Well, those aren&#39;t hands anymore, Jeff. Those are your new front legs - they dont need to be as flexible as human arms.&quot;<br />
&quot;I get it, but-&quot;<br />
He stopped as he looked down at his feet. They felt... very uncomfortable in his shoes. He took his shoes off, ony to see his feet going through the same process as his hands, turning into canine paws. The changed spreaded up his legs, making Jeff feel discoordinated.<br />
&quot;Whoa, I-&quot; He put his hands over his mom&#39;s shoulders for support. &quot;It&#39;s hard to, to-&quot;<br />
&quot;To keep your balance with those legs?&quot; His mom chuckled, looking like she has the best time of her life. &quot;Dogs are quadropod, Jeff. Meaning they walk on all fours. Try it.&quot;<br />
Jeff gulped. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be on all fours...&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, you ARE going to be on them soon, whether you like it or not. So I think it&#39;s best to try it, before you back changes.&quot;<br />
&quot;O-okay.&quot;<br />
Jeff took his hands off his mom, and immeadiately fell down. Thankfuly, he managed to catch himself with his hands - no, not hands, his front legs.<br />
&quot;Just in time,&quot; Said his mom, as Jeff&#39;s back started to arch, pushing the boy down and forcing him into quadropal stance. He groaned.<br />
&quot;Is everything alright, sweetheart?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah mom, it&#39;s just... it&#39;s so weird...&quot; Jeff tried to get up on two again, but he realised he just can&#39;t. Suddenly, he heared a loud &#39;pop!&#39;, and a strange feeling came from his backside. He felt like there was... something... growing up above his anus.<br />
&quot;Is that your tail, Jeff?&quot; His mom couldn&#39;t contain her laughter. &quot;I want to see it. And we gotta get rid of your clothes anyway, so...&quot; Jamie giggled and pushed a buttom on the Chronivac. Jeff&#39;s clothes dissappeared in an instant. He screamed. &quot;The hell, mom!&quot;<br />
His mother snickered. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t be so shameful about it. I&#39;m your mom, Jeff. I&#39;ve seen you naked before. And dogs don&#39;t wear clothes anyway.&quot;<br />
Jeff sighed and blushed in embaressment, but he knew his mom was right. He looked back on his exposed body, and saw a tail hanging above his anus. He focus, and managed to move the tail from side to side. He gasped. &quot;That&#39;s... actually pretty cool.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know!&quot; His mom laughed. Jeff&#39;s body was completely covered in fur now, and was completely canine, apart from his face, and...<br />
&quot;Eep!&quot;<br />
&quot;What is it, Jeff?&quot; asked his mom, confused. Then, seeing how red her son became, she smirked. &quot;Oh, I see.&quot;<br />
Jeff felt his privates heating. He looked down, and saw his member turning red. A sheath formed around it, covering it with protective fur. His balls was covered too, and were sent a little backwards, just under his tail.<br />
&quot;And now, for the best part... or rather, the second best part...&quot; His mom chuckled, making Jeff blush even harder. &quot;Your face!&quot;<br />
Jeff&#39;s nose pushed forward, and his teeth grew larger and pointier. His ears perked up, turning pointy and long. His eyes moved to opposite sides of his face, and the tip of his nose turned black. His tongue lengheted and hung out his motuh for a second.<br />
&quot;How are you feeling, boy?&quot;<br />
Jeff tried to answer, but to his horror, a confused bark came out. His mom giggled. &quot;Oh, forgot to tell you about that. As part of the realitly alteration, I set it so you won&#39;t be able to talk - that&#39;ll look pretty weird, right? - but I did made it so I, and only me, will be able to understand you.&quot;<br />
Jeff whined. &quot;Can you understand this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I can.&quot; His mom giggled. &quot;I most tell you, it&#39;s a childhood dream come true, Jeff. I&#39;ve always wanted a dog.&quot; She snickered. &quot;Well, now that you are a dog, what are we going to do?&quot;</p>
