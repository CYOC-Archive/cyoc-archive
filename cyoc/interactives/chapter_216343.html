<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janessa’s sense of time had been badly thrown off by being in the harem. Time had seemed to pass slowly there, broken up only by visits from Antyny and when been escorted to a dining chamber for their meals. The recent visit to the council chamber had been pleasant not just because it offered the opportunity to gather information, but because it enabled her to get out of the harem chambers for some fresh air. <br />
<br />
Therefore, when Janessa woke, she was groggy and slightly confused. It felt like it should have been morning, but the lack of natural light coming in from the small window in the private room made it clear that wasn’t the case. She was about to exit the private room when she heard the sounds of giggling coming from outside. “Oh, you two are just so handsome, and it’s been sooo long since we had a man between our legs. Isn’t that right, Borya?” She heard Francesca purr. Walking to the door of the private room, Janessa slowly peaked her head out. <br />
<br />
Instead of being at their posts outside the door, the two harem guards were inside the quarters, their eyes huge as Borya and Francesca worked their magic. Both girls were dressed in similar outfits to Janessa’s, the main difference being the color scheme, which was a shimmering silver rather than gold. They slowly circled around the two men like beautiful, sensual sharks. Borya ran a hand across one of the guards’ chests, smiling at him. The two guards looked like they had found a massive stash of gold just lying in the street. <br />
<br />
“So…..are you boys up for a good time?” Francesca asked, she and Borya pulling off their uniform tops near simultaneously. The guards barely spared a look at each other before they each embraced a woman and, already beginning to passionately make out with them, carried them over to the bed. <br />
<br />
Janessa watched as both guards hurried stripped out of their uniforms and began thrusting into their waiting partners, who spread their legs wide. “Harder, Haldar! Oh, please, harder!” Borya cried. She knew that Antyny allowed his harem guards to take Francesca and Borya to bed, but this was a reward for performing their duties well….not something they did on their own initiative. And, since the rebels never bothered to leave any more than two guards outside of the harem quarters, that meant they had left their posts. Janessa rolled her eyes. Men. She wondered if she’d ever been so blinded by the thought of bedding a pretty girl she’d neglected her duties. With a sinking feeling, she realized she probably had. <br />
<br />
Silently closing the door and turning, Janessa just barely managed to stifle a girly shriek of alarm. There was a man in the private room! He looked to be about fifteen years older than  than her, in his mid to late 30s, with short blond hair and a beard He put a finger to his lips, motioning her to be silent, and she agreed, slowly glancing over her shoulder to make sure the door was shut. How had this man gotten past the guards?<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about Haldar and Annak.” The man said with a smile. “It was simplicity itself to plant the lust spell in their minds and get them to leave their posts. Neither are very bright, I’m afraid. They wouldn’t notice if a cavalry charge smashed its way through here right now.” Janessa nodded, her own eyes widening. Of course! This man had magic of his own, hence the hair color. <br />
<br />
“I’m Yevgeny, by the way. Anya’s brother.” The man continued, causing Janessa to gasp. “Yes, I know who you really are, your highness. I must say, that amulet really did a number on you.” <br />
<br />
Janessa had never met Anya’s brother, but he’d heard of him. Yevgeny had been a soldier in his father’s army for years, then had been assigned to “other tasks.” His father had never said what they were, but Yevgeny was often out of the country.  <br />
<br />
“So you’ll turn me back?” Janessa said eagerly. True, sex with Antyny was wonderful(stupid magic, she thought with a grumble) but she’d always wanted to get out of here eventually. And with Yevgeny present, her chances of escape were much, much better. <br />
<br />
Yevgeny shrugged. “Not at the moment, no.” <br />
<br />
Janessa’s jaw dropped. <br />
<br />
Yevgeny sighed and began counting on his fingers. “Item one: I have been ordered by YOUR loyalists to remain in the city and gather as much information as possible. The war, in case you didn’t notice, is not going well. We have the best defensible land in the country, loyal men, and some supplies, but that’s about it. Item two: that is an incredibly powerful amulet, and I’m not sure what Anya was even thinking letting it out of her sight. Undoing its magic completely is going to be a long process, and time is one thing we simply don’t have. Item three” and here his smile seemed more like a wolf bearing its fangs. <br />
<br />
“You may have been good to Anya, but as her brother seeing her have to be a concubine, even a well treated one, well…..” he trailed off. “Perhaps this is the amulet teaching you a lesson of sorts. Magic works in strange ways.” He said. “And finally, item four: if you vanished at present, the rebels would turn the city upside down. We will only get one shot at an escape. No, your highness, I’m afraid you are stuck for the time being.”<br />
<br />
Janessa sighed. His logic seeming entirely sound. And, she had to admit, perhaps he had a point about Anya. Being on the other side of things had helped Janessa see the situation rather differently. “Okay.” She said. “Well, in that case, I have some information to pass on.” <br />
<br />
Yevgeny nodded when she told him what she had learned. “Good work, your highness. Gather as much information as you can, but be careful.” He handed her a small bracelet, which she slipped onto her wrist. “If you get into serious trouble, use the amulet, and then press the stone in the center of the bracelet three times. I will come to help.” He smiled again. “And with that, I must take my leave. The guards and your harem sisters are currently slumbering, the little spell I cast having run its course.” He nodded gravely at Janessa. “Good luck.” <br />
<br />
With that, Yevgeny’s form shimmered, and he walked towards one of the chamber walls, passing right through it and vanishing. Janessa sat on the bed, mind swirling. What now?</p>
