<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the three boy friends wandered down the beach, James couldn’t help but notice that they couldn’t keep their hands off each other.  What was he going to do with them when get got to the party?<br />
<br />
After thinking for a moment, James decided to take things one step further.  He made some more adjustments to the Maker so that it would take hours for all three to experience all the changes he had planned.<br />
<br />
Sean and Mike suddenly felt a little uncomfortable in their speedos, but they also felt warm and moist.  Thinking that is was only precum they and that they were so excited about all those gorgeous men on the beach, they ignored the warm moist feeling.  <br />
<br />
Then there was a sharp stab of pain and Sean and Michael threw themselves in each other’s arms.  They were trembling and afraid to go on, but oddly sexually aroused at the same time.  Rafael suddenly felt a pain to, he thought for a second he was having a heart-attach, but when he reached up to his chest, he realized his hand had roughly crossed his pec and caught on a very large stainless steel nipple ring.  Completely ignoring his boyfriends, he looked down to see that both nipples were pierced and the glint of sunlight shining from the rings accented just how large and hard his nipples really were.<br />
<br />
By the time Rafael was able to think again, the color and vivaciousness had returned to Sean and Michael.  They were deep-throating each other, right there on the boardwalk and didn’t care who saw. <br />
<br />
“You guys are embarrassing…” Rafael started, and he noticed that even he was beginning to feel more than a little tight in his leather speedo.  The sunshine on the black leather was making things so hot that he had to take his hand and pull at it to let at least some cool air in.<br />
<br />
“Like you’re not gonna get arrested showing off your cock to everyone on the beach…” Sean started out.<br />
<br />
But the changes were just too much.  They had to get somewhere fast.  There was no going back to the men’s room now… they were too far away.  And there were so many straight guys on the beach, they knew they’d get beat up if they tried going back there.  Since they had made down past the arcade, Michael remembered a guy he used to know who had a place nearby.  He couldn’t remember why he hadn’t thought of his friend before.  There had been some sort of fight he remembered, but he couldn’t remember what it was about … the guy was cute… he remembered that.<br />
<br />
It only took a couple of minutes to get to his house and Mike knocked on the door.  <br />
<br />
“What do you want kid?” came from inside…<br />
<br />
“Rob – it’s me, Mike … I .. ah … need to talk to you…”<br />
<br />
A drop dead gorgeous 20 year old redheaded man opened the door and his jaw dropped…. “Mike..?”<br />
<br />
“Can we come in…?” Mike was still trying to remember why Rob and he hadn’t ever been lovers….<br />
<br />
“Sure …dude… what happened to you?”<br />
Robby was looking at Mike, and Mike hadn’t changed that much from the last time he’s seen him.  He was definitely “out” now … and he didn’t seem to have changed that much from high school.  <br />
<br />
“When did you get the tattoo Mike?” Rob asked innocently.  Mike was lost for words.  “Silly boy … it looks so cute…” and Rob smiled down and then he just stared, frozen at Mike.<br />
<br />
“You threatened to beat my ass just for being gay and now you turn up with your… whatever … and want… what the fuck do you want Mike?...” Rob’s face had turned red and he was shaking with anger.<br />
<br />
Tears welled up in Michael’s eyes and he was at a loss for words.  ‘What’s wrong with me … Rob could have been my best friend with Sean &amp; Rafe?’<br />
<br />
“…we .. ah… couldn’t go back to the men’s room and ah… we need… to … OH GOD ROB… I’m so sorry … I loved you but I couldn’t tell you … you scared me…” was all Michael could get out.<br />
<br />
“Okay …now I’ve got it … there were too many straights in the men’s room and you were afraid to get your ass kicked so you came down here …. I’ve got your number twink … fuck you.”<br />
<br />
Then a flicker of a smile came over Mike… “…okay Rob – but please… let us use the bathroom first…”  <br />
 <br />
In the complete absurdity of the situation, all the guys laughed.  Rob then shook his head and smiled, leading Mike down the hall to the darkened bathroom.  He flipped on the light and as his hand came down, it brushed against Michael’s side and squeezed his butt.  Mike giggled and their eyes met.  <br />
<br />
It could have easily developed into a non-stop sex-scene, but Rob closed the door and started back down the hall to tend to his other guests, … some new friends.<br />
<br />
Michael just couldn’t figure out what was happening to him.  He walked over to the mirror to check himself out.  He remembered the pastel blue nylon bikini, but he didn’t remember his hoop earings.   He broke out in a cold sweat when he saw that there was a bright green hummingbird tattoo under his left ear.  It looked like it was trying to play with his hoop.  <br />
<br />
He remembered loving his hair, long and red and curly and seemed to notice for the first time just how long it hung down his back.  He could sit on it.  And then he remembered the pain.  He tugged at his speedo and felt so much relief when he pulled it down to let his dick breathe.  This was just too much to believe.  He was sure that he was cut, but when he looked down, he had a heavy foreskin covering his long thick penis.  When he saw it, it excited him so much that a the bright purple tip started to push it’s way out into the light.  He stood there breathless as he watched the monster emerge into the light.  There was a huge 8 gauge Prince Albert shining through his manhood.  The feeling of excitement continued to grow and Michael gave up any hope of ever being able to put his speedo back on over this monster.  It took both of his hands to encircle it and it didn’t look like it was ever going to stop growing.  It had to be over ten inches and he could only guess how fat it was.<br />
<br />
Rapt with wonder at his new body, Michael hadn’t heard Sean pounding on the door.  Sean finally just barged in and dropped his speedos… he couldn’t wait anymore for his friend.  Michael turned as he heard Sean rush in and Sean came to a complete stop – mystified by the sight that met his eyes.<br />
<br />
As Michael looked at Sean, it was as though it was the first time he had ever really seen his friend.  The bleached hair, the tattoo… ? the tattoo?  Sean had a tattoo of a bright butterfly under his ear that he had never seen before.  When Sean saw Mike standing there with his glory, he saw that he too was uncircumsized and had a Prince Albert.  <br />
<br />
About that time, Rafael and Rob showed up…”Hey … if there’s a party … it’s my house… I should be invited…”  Rob only pretended to be miffed.  He certainly hadn’t planned an afternoon like this, but he was going to enjoy it now that it was here.<br />
<br />
It took no encouragement for Rafe to drop his hot leather speedos and check out his new endowment.  Sean moved toward Rafe with the deepest look of lust in his eyes.  He began to rub his hands over his boyfriend’s slick and shiney head and down his back, pulling Rafe’s tongue into his mouth and kissing him deeply.<br />
<br />
Michael just stood there, looking at Rob and then down to the floor.  He was so ashamed of the way he had treated his friend.  Tears started to well up in his eyes and then Rob came over and put his arms around Mike.  He put his hand under his friend’s chin and forced him to look up into his eyes.  “It’s okay Michael … we were just kids … it doesn’t matter anymore … you found me again and now we can be together - … ah… if that is what you wanted. ….”<br />
<br />
Then Mike realized, ‘fuck yeah…. Fuck the party … fuck everybody… I want to be with Robby.  I want Robby to fuck ME!!!  He was always watching me,… he always wanted me… how could I have been so blind?  I treated him like dirt.’<br />
<br />
“Robby, … I want you … if you want me… I just couldn’t say it before…” and the two embraced.  “Ya’ know… if you want… I could still kick your ass – I mean if you’re into that sort of thing….” and the two laughed and started wrestling right there in the bathroom.  Mike was no match for Robby and almost immediately, Robby had Michael in his arms and was carrying him down to the bedroom.  <br />
<br />
Sean and Rafe watched as Rob had Mike outmatched.  As the two disappeared down the hall, they decided to go out to the living room and get comfortable.  It was going to be a very long afternoon.  The leather couch didn’t seem disagreeable either under their naked bodies, and as the hot afternoon sun slowly began to fade, the two friends became lovers, feeling safe and protected in their new friend’s home.<br />
<br />
“When was that party ‘sposed to start?”…</p>
