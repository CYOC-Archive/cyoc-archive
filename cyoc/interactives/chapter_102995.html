<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having tested the light on girls you decide that maybe now it&#39;s time to try it on a guy. You quickly spy another couple, this time a guy and a girl in their late teens. They&#39;re an ordinary enough couple, the guy tall with dark blond hair and a scruffy mustache, the girl short with ample curves and long brown hair. You can&#39;t wait to make them less ordinary, but how?<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Alexander sighed. Summer was nearly over and he and Samantha were trying to enjoy it as much as they could. He was going to be going to the local college in a few days and three weeks after that Samantha was going to be starting beauty school.She&#39;d always wanted to be a beautician and someday wanted to run a hair salon of her own. He wasn&#39;t so sure about  what he wanted to do with himself, he didn&#39;t even know what he was going to major in once he started college. Yeah he had a year more to decide, but it was still frustrating.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d gone to the mall because they couldn&#39;t think of anything else to do and now they were just sitting around thinking. Reaching out he took his hand in hers and gave it a gentle squeeze. He was lucky to have ended up with a girl like Samantha and he knew it. She was smart, determined and really knew what she wanted to do while he&#39;d kind of just drifted through high school without a plan. Back when he was in middle school he&#39;d figured that he&#39;d go out for a sports team when he got to high school, but that wasn&#39;t to be. Yeah, he&#39;d been tall and thin and kind of had a runner&#39;s build, but that had been in middle school. He stayed thin, but that was because he didn&#39;t put on much muscle.<br />
<br />
Smiling at the memory of trying out for the cross country team, he rubbed his thin mustache, the result of month&#39;s of effort to grow. He wasn&#39;t the best guy on the team, but he&#39;d tried. Heck, he was one of the shorter guys on the team, but he&#39;d been determined. It was the only sport that worked for him since he wasn&#39;t really strong or coordinated for any others. It wasn&#39;t for lack of effort though.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d always been small, and he&#39;d had to work hard to prove himself. When he&#39;d been younger he&#39;d gotten teased a lot for it. By the time he was in high school there were girls in his class who were taller than him, better athletes too, so he gave up on the idea of trying out for any sports team. Instead he&#39;d turned his efforts to his studies. he&#39;d always been fond of math and he was pretty good at it, not the best, but he was nothing if not determined and he managed pretty good grades.<br />
<br />
Smiling at the memory of making it into the advanced placement calculus class he ran a hand through his scruffy hair. It was getting long, maybe he should think about getting a hair cut. Or maybe he&#39;d wait until Sammantha learned how to cut hair and he&#39;d let her do it for a grade in beauty school. Yeah, that seemed like a good idea, besides it would make her happy.<br />
<br />
He looked over at her and put an arm over her shoulder. They were about the same height and Samantha wasn&#39;t especially tall, but she didn&#39;t seem upset by it. There were times when he still couldn&#39;t believe she&#39;d said yes when he first asked her out. A nerdy little shrimp like him and a really hot girl like her didn&#39;t seem like something that would happen, but it had.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<i>Pleased with the results on the guy you decide to play around with the girl as well, maybe throwing in some mental changes as well to really mix up the dynamics of their relationship.</i><br />
-<br />
<br />
He&#39;d had a crush on her ever since middle school, but he&#39;d been too shy to say anything. She wasn&#39;t like the other girls, didn&#39;t make fun of him for being so short and scrawny, so he&#39;d been optimistic about having a chance with her. Still, it had taken him years to get up the courage. He was surprised to learn that he  was the first guy to have ever asked her out, but it honestly shouldn&#39;t have been that shocking to him. She was tall and thin, but still fairly curvy so she was attractive, but maybe not the sort of attractive most guys would notice.<br />
<br />
Yeah there&#39;d been a lot of jokes when they first started dating, but that was expected since Samantha was taller than him. Then again, she was taller than some of the other guys too so for once he wasn&#39;t alone. She took it well and he was used to that sort of thing by that point so it wasn&#39;t too much of a difficulty. Besides, Samantha had always been a bit of a tomboy, so she didn&#39;t care what the girls said about her. Most of her friends were guys and once the two of them had started dating the guys stopped teasing him. He wasn&#39;t jealous of her friends at all, to them she was just one of the guys and honestly, he could see why. Taller than any of the other girls in their grade and almost totally flat chested she wasn&#39;t the sort of girl most guys would go for. The fact that she liked to keep her hair short, barely reaching her shoulders didn&#39;t help. She said it kept it out of the way when she played sports, which had always been a passion of hers. In high school she had decided that softball and the girls&#39; fieldhocky team weren&#39;t interesting to her and she&#39;d asked to be a part of the wrestling team. After several weeks of back and forth discussion it was determined that there were no rules against girls joining the team and the coach had agreed to let her try. By the end of the year he was glad that he&#39;d agreed because she was one of the better members.<br />
<br />
So yeah, there were jokes about her being the man in their relationship, but she was going to college on an athletics scholarship so the teasing was mostly good natured.<br />
<br />
Sam reached out and gave his hand a gentle squeeze and he smiled at her. He really was a lucky guy. There were times when he still couldn&#39;t believe that she had asked him out back in their first year of high school. He&#39;d been intimidated at the time, but he was glad that he&#39;d found the courage to say yes.<br />
<br />
She put an arm around him and pulled Alex closer to her, &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing really,&quot; he said, nervously straightening his shirt, &quot;Just about how we&#39;ve got a lot of big changes ahead of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sam laughed, &quot;But it&#39;s exciting too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exciting for you maybe,&quot; he smiled back at his much taller girlfriend, continuing to fidget with his shirt. He always felt self conscious when they went out together, it was something she was trying to help him get over but it was hard. She was so relaxed, so self assured. Even the way she dressed reflected it, tall and muscular she had a hard time finding women&#39;s clothing that fit, so she tended to wear guy&#39;s stuff most of the time. Between that and how short she kept her hair she regularly got mistaken for a guy and she didn&#39;t care. That was part of what he found so attractive about her, that she looked and to an extent, acted like a guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exciting for both of us,&quot; she encouraged, &quot;Getting away from those jackoffs from high school will be good for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still nervous,&quot; he said meekly, ashamed to be admitting as much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she gave him a little squeeze and kissed him on the top of his head.<br />
<br />
Beneath his shirt he could feel his puffy nipples starting to perk up. There had been a lot of jokes about him being the woman in the relationship and maybe they weren&#39;t too far off. He really did like it when Sam played with his chest. Unable to help himself he blushed at the thought.<br />
<br />
Sam seemed to realize what he was thinking because she smiled, &quot;Want to head back to my place? Both my parents are working late today so we should have time to do whatever we want.&quot;<br />
<br />
