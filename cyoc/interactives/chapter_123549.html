<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m scared I don&#39;t know what to choose,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too late! It&#39;s 60 seconds, now for your transformation, you&#39;ll become a DIY dummy. What does this means? It means that for a start, your naked most the time. Your skin can morph into anything and anyone, even having the clothes, memories and voice of the person. You can tear your skin to morph into things, but you have a limit. You have regenerative skin, but you&#39;ll have to tear a certain amount to make something, a tiny piece for a atom, and all of it for a new universe. You can even stretch your body like gum. And the people who raised with you knew this. For your dare you will have a great day, with a lot of good luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you must be wondering why I&#39;m doing good to you? I have seen you reached so much good, and I thought it would be nice of the world to give you this ability, besides being naked, but hope you&#39;ll like it,&quot; said Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww thanks, now Transform or Dare, Kyle?&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I say dare,&quot; said Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now for your dare, I want you to tell me all of your likes without remembering this, then be quiet, while holding the phone, for 2 minutes,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like girls and diapers,&quot; said Kyle.<br />
<br />
Kyle was raised mostly with girls in his life. His father is unknown, and he lives with 4 girls and a mom. He had a bad childhood for his sisters telling him about his gender. He had a bad time, but he is kind and sweet most of the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now Transform or Dare, Kyle?&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, 60 seconds is up, now you get both. For your transform, you&#39;ll turn into a beautiful, loving girl, at birth who has a disorder which won&#39;t allow you to properly potty train. So you wear big, thick diapers all the time. And for your dare, you&#39;ll also have lots of good luck today. I wanted you too to have what I have, so thanks,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh, thank you so much!&quot; said Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sadly, I don&#39;t have much time,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too, but I&#39;ll talk to you later, good bye!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the phone hang.<br />
<br />
Jen Side: As Jen hang up, she turned immediately naked, but didn&#39;t care. She wanted to test her new powers. She wanted to start with being her maid in her French maid suit. She started thinking of her in her maid suit and started transforming. Her hair turned black, skin turned a little darker, looking Asian. Her eyes turned into a beautiful blue, her face formed up make-up on the spots, and her mouth greatly changed inside. Her body and breast shortened, while her belly was growing some fat. Her butts changed a little bigger, and her &#39;area&#39; lengthen, while her legs turned shorter and fatter. Then black cloth started to appeared, turning to areas and forming into a French maid suit. She was getting new thoughts with the ability, and said, &quot;Oh wow, this works,&quot; in a soft, sweet voice. Then she wanted to see her in a black one piece, which she has never seen her in it. She started to think how it would look in a one piece, then the suit was starting to changed. The dress and the hat was started to disappear, but the panties and bra was left. Then the bra and panties started to connect each other and started forming around her body. When it was done, she was shocked to see her looking really good. She wanted to change back, so she though of her before this, and her body turned longer, her butt and &#39;area&#39; shortened, her breast bigger, and her face turned back to normal. Then she wanted to see on her skin. She took it out, feeling a little pain but grew back at the area. She wanted it to be a pencil, and her skin turned into a pencil. She was really scared and excited. She grab her stuff in her self-made backpack in her stomach, and changed into a white dove, flying to school, thinking what to change into?<br />
<br />
Kyle Side: As he hanged up, he felt weak, and fell on his bed, feeling pain. His chest and facial hair was growing back in, while his own top hair growing brown, wavy hair, while her face was turning smaller and more feminine. Make-up appeared on him, looking beautiful. Then his body changed. His body grew a little smaller, and felt something popping out of his chest. It was boobs, growing at a perfect DD, and felt himself skinnier, from losing fat around his waist and belly. His waist and butt grew big, but his &#39;area&#39; was sucking up to into a beautiful something else and reformed his special hair. Then his legs grew longer and a bit fatter, but his feet grew smaller. Then his clothes was changing. A blue bow appeared on her hair, a black bra appeared out of nowhere, while his shirt changing color to blue and pants was forming to a blue skirt halfway to the knees. His shoes were changed it&#39;s color and size. And his boxers turned into a big, thick diaper. He, or rather she, was getting her memories forming different, being appreciated and loved. She got up to hear his mother saying, &quot;Come on, the bus can come here anytime.&quot; &quot;Ok mom!&quot; She replied in a higher pitched voice. She got up to she herself on the mirror. &quot;I look beautiful. I love it,&quot; said Kyle, or Kylie. She looked at her room to see boy magazines, make-up, etc. She went to her drawer to get her socks, and put on her shoes. She walked down to eat her breakfast and got her bags, as she was going on her bus to see her day.</p>
