<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I wanted to try again with Cal and do a different approach. Thanks for reading!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You can come out, friend.” The voice called. “There’s no reason to be afraid.” The voice coaxed gently.<br />
<br />
Cal hesitated for a moment before calling out, “I’m sorry, but I have no clothes,” he warned. He heard the man snort and stamp his feet.<br />
<br />
“Since when has that ever mattered? Come out of the woods, boy. Let’s stop this foolishness.” <br />
<br />
He gulped and stepped out from his hiding place among the bramble. Standing on the margins of the road was a tall man, one of the tallest men Cal had ever seen in fact. His chest and shoulders rippled with hard, lean muscle, coated in a healthy layer of wiry body hair. His beard was thick and shaggy, his brown hair braided and dreaded. He wore only a pair of trousers, the cuffs rolled up to expose his hairy legs and enormous feet. <br />
<br />
“There’s a lad,” he chuckled, leering at Cal’s nude body and beckoning him to come forward. Cal traipsed out of the undergrowth, and approached the man. He was even taller up close, standing at a towering eight feet tall. Cal tried not to stare at the hard shape snaking down the leg of his loose leather trousers. <br />
<br />
“Don’t take this as a complaint, boy, but why are you naked?” he asked, with a deep brogue that sounded familiar and yet, he couldn’t place the origin.<br />
<br />
“I..uh…” he began, still unused to his new deeper voice. “I…was travelling and I got robbed.” He couldn’t tell the man how he had found himself in this forest or this new manly body; he’d think Cal was crazy.<br />
<br />
“A shame,” he said, grimacing, but there was a weird tingle in his eyes. “My d…my home,” he corrected himself, “Is not far from here. I could offer you some clothes? And some fare to make it to port?” He offered in a congenial tone. <br />
<br />
“Port?” Cally asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“Roundbottom Port? Its just a few hours walk, o’er the hills. I assume you were either on your way there, or leaving.” He mused.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I was on my way back from…visiting family and I got ambushed. They took all my things, my clothes, and they knocked me out and left me in the middle of the woods.”<br />
<br />
Cal saw a brief flash of disbelief in the man’s deep, dark eyes, but the stranger continued to smile warmly at him as he spoke. “My offer stands, lad. Unless you want to wait for those ‘robbers’ to come back for the rest of you.”<br />
<br />
“No, I…thank you. I would greatly appreciate it,” he said, remembering his manners. <br />
<br />
“Splendid. Follow me lad, and try not to trip over that cock of yours!” he guffawed, leading a blushing Cal back down the trail the man had come. <br />
<br />
“I’m…Cal,” he said as they walked at a brisk pace down the leaf-strewn dirt road. <br />
<br />
“You may call me Luka.” He replied, offering him a giant, calloused hand to shake. Cally took it, wincing when the man squeezed a little too hard.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I don’t know my own strength sometimes,” he chuckled.<br />
<br />
Cal eyed his massive frame and said, “Yeah, I can imagine. So, you live out here?” he began, trying to ignore the fact that he was walking through the forest naked and with a stranger he just met. <br />
<br />
“Yes. Myself, my husband. And many of my brothers. We’ve lived in these woods for generations.” <br />
<br />
“Lucky you,” he commented. <br />
<br />
“Yes, I never did understand why you hu…you men live in the cities. So far from nature.” <br />
<br />
Cal had grown up in the country and heard this before. “Well, sometimes you gotta go out in the world and find your own way,” he offered. <br />
<br />
Luka nodded. “Yes, a man does have to find his own path. Although,” he turned to Cal, “A man has to be careful of which path he takes.” He said with a mischievous growl.<br />
<br />
Cal didn’t know what to say to that, Luka led him off the road and down a narrow game trail. They entered a little forest clearing, in the center of which was the enormous, buttressed stump of a long fallen giant tree. There was a fire nearby, over which a pair of whole carcasses leaned on wooden racks, sweating and slowly cooking over the smokey fire. An opening had been carved into the base of the tree, flanked by a gaggle of warped chairs and a line of earthenware garden pots bearing spikes of aromatic herbs and flowers. A small trail of smoke drifted from a stack on the top of the tree stump. Luka led him up to the doorway and pulled back a linen curtain to allow him in. <br />
<br />
Cal’s eyes took a moment to adjust to the darker light. The room was warm and humid, with an earthen smell; Cal could feel the bare soil beneath his big toes. He peered around the room, seeing an immense pile of blankets and furs that he figured must be the man’s bed occupying one side, and a small hearth and kitchen-area occupying the other. Cal stood there awkwardly, nosing through the man’s things with his eyes while Luka dug around in a big trunk for a pair of clothes. <br />
<br />
“I know I have some spare trousers somewhere,” he muttered. “They might not fit you though. My husband and I are rather big men.” He chuckled, while Cal looked at the strange, dried objects hanging from the ceiling on strings of twine. <br />
<br />
“Anything’s fine,” he said, trying to be gracious so that he could get the hell out of here. This place was starting to creep him out.<br />
<br />
“Here we are!” he finally said, pulling out a pair of red linen pants and handing them to Cal.<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” Cal stepped into the pants, blushing when he had to gingerly grab his cock and feed it down one of the legs, before pulling them up over his waist and cinching them tight. “You wouldn’t happen to have spare pare of shoes? Or flip-flops or something?” he asked.<br />
<br />
Luka laughed, his back turned to Cal as he picked up a pitcher of water and a pair of pewter mugs. “No, lad. We don’t wear shoes.” He said, as if that were a regular life choice. <br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“You get tough feet when you live a life in the forest, lad. Here, drink up; you look parched.” He handed him the mug. Cal took it and examined it. Who uses pewter anymore?<br />
<br />
“So, is it, ah, hard, living off the grid like this?” he asked, sipping the water. It had a strange sweetness to it but otherwise tasted normal to him.<br />
<br />
“I don’t take your meaning,” he said, his haughty façade failing for a moment as his heavy brow furrowed in confusion. <br />
<br />
“I mean, how do you guys get by without power or septic?” he asked. He hadn’t seen any panels or pumps or anything around. <br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“The bathroom?”<br />
<br />
“We bathe in the river,” he said simply, as if misinterpreting the term. “Drink up; you’re talking crazy. You must be dehydrated.” <br />
<br />
Cal shrugged and finished his water, smacking his lips at the almost cloyingly sweet taste. His mouth and tongue started to feel numb; his stomach began to churn and feel warm as well. He coughed, feeling the heat begin to spread up to his chest and burn the back of his throat.<br />
<br />
“May I have another?” he asked, clearing his throat again.<br />
<br />
“Of course.” Luka said with a smile, grabbing the pitcher. Cal eagerly guzzled the water, sighing as the hot feeling on his throat seemed to dissipate. The heat grew stronger everywhere else though. His skin began to break out into a sweat, his heart racing. Cal took a deep breath as he felt a swelling sensation between his legs, looking down to be reminded of his newfound maleness by the heavy erection slowly tenting his trousers. Cal wanted to feel embarrassed, or ashamed, or grossed out, but he didn’t. Instead, as the warmth spread through him he began to feel a powerful vigor, a sense of confidence and virile hunger that rushed Cal’s worries and stray thoughts in his mind. His hand slowly crept to take hold of his growing cock through his pants, gasping as he curled his fingers around his thick, pulsing shaft. It felt like an electrode of sensitivity, as if all of the roads of pleasure in his body ran to his cock. He stroked it and moaned, stimulated by the soft fabric, as his cock fully hardened in his grasp. He was so preoccupied that he forgot Luka was even there, until he heard a throaty chuckle and his head snapped back up.<br />
<br />
“You want some help with that?” he said, his hand gliding over his own growing bulge as he watched Cal fondle himself. Cal shut his eyes tight and reopened them again, staring at the man. Before, in his daze and confusion, Cal hadn’t even thought to consider Luka the man beyond his intimidating bulk. But now, Calvin found himself getting lost in the dense forest of hair on the man’s hard, muscled chest, following the thick trail of curly black hair down his hard, 6-pack and past his navel to where it disappeared below the waist of his trousers. Cal licked his lips at the sight of the heavy, cylindrical shape snaking down the leg of his pants. <br />
<br />
“Oh, god yes!” He said eagerly. The big man gave him a wide grin through his bushy beard, Cal only just now noticing how sharp his incisors were. Luka stood up from his chair and sauntered over to Cal, effortlessly picking him up in his big arms and carrying him to his bed. He laid Cal down and collapsed on top of him, giving him a hard kiss and parting Cal’s lips with his rough tongue. Cal relished in the sensation of the man’s coarse beard running against his own, running his hands over his hairy back and his powerful neck. The man began taking his kissing and licking lower and lower down Cal’s body, licking the inside of neck, playfully nibbling Cal’s hard, hairy nipples, and slowly making his way down the straining tent in Cal’s trousers. He undid the knot and pulled them down, letting Cal’s thick cock thud against Cal’s hard abdomen. Cal looked down at the man as he handled and stroked his cock, seeing it erect for the first time. It looked enormous to his virgin eyes, at least nine or ten inches long, with a slightly conical red head and just the right number of swollen veins running along its surface. He felt a surge of pride at his cock as it started to feel more and more natural.<br />
<br />
Luka’s ministrations weren’t hurting either. Cal let gasp and pressed his head back against the furs as Luka took the head of his cock into his mouth. He let out a throaty giggle, Luka’s beard hairs tickling along his shaft as the man inhaled his cock deeper and deeper into his maw. He closed his eyes as Luka sucked and massaged him with his big mouth. Luka’s big hands roamed over Cal’s rough, hairy skin, teasing his nipples and feeling along the muscles of his chest and stomach. One of his hands found Cal’s balls and began to deftly massage them one by one, making Cal’s hand shoot out from reflex and latch onto the arm that was busy stroking his belly. He was shocked at how densly hairy his arm felt; thick and slightly oily, almost like fur. But under Luka’s assault he couldn’t bring himself to investigate. He winced as something sharp briefly grazed the skin of his cock and his head shot up.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, my fangs are getting long,” he apologized, looking up at Cal and smiling, and if it weren’t for the expert head he was just receiving, Cal would have screamed.<br />
<br />
The man’s face was completely covered in fur, his nose and jaw pushed forward just enough to give him the vague appearance of a muzzle. His brown eyes had turned a bright and haunting yellow, his ears round and furry, sticking out from his shaggy mane. Cal saw that Luka’s chest and arms, his entire body, was covered in a pelt of dense, shaggy black fur; it was shorter and lighter colored where it ran over his chest and belly, the undersides of his arms, but everywhere else it was the definition of a protective fur coat. Luka was giving him a wide, “wolfish” grin, his long incisors peaking out from his lower jaw, a clawed finger delicately tracing along the sensitive flesh of his inner thigh. <br />
<br />
“There’s no reason to be afraid, my friend.” He growled, his once rich voice now overlayed with a gravely rumble. <br />
<br />
“What, what the hell are you?” cried Cal, abandoning all pretense.<br />
<br />
He chuckled, taking Cal’s cock back in his leathery paw; Cal didn’t like the look of those long, ursine claws so close to his new sensitive tool. “I’m a werebear, lad. You definitely aren’t from around here.” He commented, his yellow eyes staring hungrily at Cal.<br />
<br />
“I…how did you know?” Luka had his cock resting in his clawed hand; Cal could lie or fib out of this one now. <br />
<br />
He sighed and shook his head at him. “The humans of these parts know not to stray into our woods. Too many accidents, too many…” he licked Cal’s cock, making him close his eyes and inhale deeply, “Disappearances.” He continued. He stood up from call and began to unlace his trousers; Cal saw his legs were long and powerful, and curved like a the hindlegs of a normal quadruped. <br />
 <br />
“But when a human is foolish enough to wander onto our land,” He whistled, pulling down his pants. “Boy, do we treat them to a good time!” he chortled, pushing his pants down tossing them aside. <br />
<br />
Cal’s sat up to get a better look as his pendulous schlong spilled from his crotch. If he was proud of his cock before, Cal was feeling quite diminished now. The cock flopped between his legs, ten inches long but clearly still hardening, matched with a pair of heavy, furry nuts. The shaft of Luka’s cock was dark, hairless, a pink head poking from the black foreskin. It wasn’t totally bestial, but it also wasn’t fully human either. Calvin watched it slowly grow to full mast, dangling almost down to his knees and throbbing gently with his heartbeat. He found himself wanting to do all the things to it that Luka was doing to him. His body felt like he was roasting; his balls began to ache and churn. <br />
<br />
“Clearly, the arousal-inducing tincture I spiked your drink with has taken its effect. It makes this next part much easier.” He smiled.<br />
<br />
“What are you gonna do to me?” whimpered Cal, tearing his eyes away from his beautiful man-meat to look into his yellow, mirthless eyes.<br />
<br />
“We’re going to fuck of course, and then, tomorrow, you’ll meet my brothers and we’ll play a different kind of game.” He promised with a sinister sneer before falling back down on top of Cal. Luka grunted as he nuzzled against Cals chest and neck, filling his nostrils with a danky, woodsy musk that made Cal’s cock throb painfully hard. He yelped as Luka’s rough, black lips pressed against his own, his long tongue pressing its way in and melding against his own. Cal found himself returning the kiss eagerly, stroking his hand through Luka’s fur and gripping him close. Luka broke the kiss to flip Cal onto his stomach; he laid his wait on top of him and began to lick and nibble along the back of his neck, behind his ears, making Cal moan and thrust his ass against the man’s pelvis. Luka pulled back and settled Cal into place with his strong hands, sheathing his claws before reaching down to insert a thick finger into Cal’s virgin ass. Cal tensed and groaned as Luka inserted another, stroking and probing him in appreciation. <br />
<br />
“You’re so slick,” he commented. Huh, so that’s still the same, Cal thought to himself, thankful as he didn’t see much in the way of lube ling around the place. But his thoughts were interrupted as Luka pressed his bulbous cockhead against the waiting entrance to Cal’s ass.<br />
<br />
“You will make a beautiful bear,” he said, leaning down to kiss him on the forehead. “I hope you make the cut.” And then he pressed himself in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Call groaned and clenched at the foreign sensation. He’d taken dicks in the past as a woman, of course, but he’d never tried anal. He tried to breath and let go, feeling his body relax and his hole open to Luka’s advance. He pressed himself in more, this time not stopping as he slowly drove inch after inch inside of him until he bottomed out against Cal’s ass. He placed one hand on Cal’s neck and the other around his comparatively smaller hip and then began to pound into him. His long, deep strokes began to quicken in pace as Cal’s ass surrendered to the man’s invasion. Cal thrust his pelvis back against the man as he fucked him, stroking his own cock while he moaned at the sensation of Lukas heavy balls slapping against his own. <br />
<br />
As Luka fucked him, Cal could feel another strange sensation, seemingly building from his ass. It seemed to grow and spread with each thrust, making his skin itch and his muscles spasm. He felt his cock throb and grow in his hands, but he figured it was just normal until the heat grew stronger and he felt his bones begin to ache. The haze of pleasure Luka had laid over him kept his attention focused on the bear’s giant cock tenderizing his insides, and his own demanding shlong between his legs. His face began to hurt as Luka increased the speed of his pounding, fucking Cal with all the force he could muster before slamming himself in balls deep and holding himself there as he came. Cal’s own cock erupted in his hands as he felt Luka’s cock pulse and swell within him as he expelled his voluminous load deep into the changing man’s bowels. Cal moaned and collapsed as his own orgasm wracked his body, his ass clamping down around Luka’s cock as the pleasure and the warmth melded together and, without a word, he passed out.<br />
<br />
Luka chuckled and gently pulled himself out of Cal so as not to disturb the sleeping man as he changed. He watched with relish as brown fur slowly filled in the bare patches of tanned skin on the young man’s body. His face was already furred and elongated, sharp canines peaking out from beneath his lips. Luka left the man to rest on the bed, before stepping out to find his husband and his brothers and give them the news. Tomorrow, the games would begin!</p>
