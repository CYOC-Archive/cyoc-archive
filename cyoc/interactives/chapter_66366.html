<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The master wondered how he'd explain to Chu and however many servants she contracted their new little sister. True, they were destine to <br />
serve him and to love doing it, but they didn't mean they couldn't be upset or angry at a blatant wrong doing. And he'd rather not have to <br />
spend his long life with servants who hated him. He was truly an idiot: he should have included an escape clause in that contract after all.<br />
<br />
He learned her 'new' name was 'Hinata.' Having picked from the only 'japanese' names she supposedly knew as a boy from a popular cartoon. <br />
Kupochu had apparently set a precedent when she had chosen her name. <br />
<br />
No family name, since her life was simply serving the household and her Master and Contractor. If pressed she'd say her family name was <br />
'Serves' as in 'Hinanta Serves.' Which in her mind was simply truth. Maybe it was due to the trauma of nearly dying, or maybe it was using a <br />
contract on someone already so young, but 'Hinata' showed no thought or reaction to her parents' deaths, or that she was now child labor, and <br />
that she could be considered kidnapped by some. <br />
<br />
Her old name was less than a ghost to her, and her old life like a daydream. <br />
<br />
He handed out small trivial tasks for her to carry out for him each day, which she carries out with an eager smile on her face. It made her <br />
listless and melancholy not to have anything to do for him, it was her nature now, it was literally her destiny. The transformation of fate in her <br />
contract meant being his servant was her reason for being born! <br />
<br />
He comforted himself that instead of an immortal little eight year old cat girl maid. she'd instead be a dead little eight year old boy if he hadn't <br />
given her the contract. He ordered her to just enjoy herself and to just play when not on duty. Though as was her nature now, she'd stop to <br />
clean or tidy up something if she spotted something in need, or him in obvious need. The front and backyard weren't that huge, and the <br />
household was walled in from all sides, but it gave enough room for a hyperactive eight year old to run around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are we the only ones here master?&quot; She asked when he first brought her to what was for all intents and purposes her home now. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have another maid, Kupochu, but she's out this week recruiting new servants, it's a hard task taking care of this house by yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren't by yourself master! You have me!&quot; Hinata hugged his arm without hesitation or fear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but it goes get lonely, and it's too much for just one servant to handle.&quot;<br />
<br />
A suicidal part of his mind considered turning himself into a cat girl maid as penance with their only master then being the household itself. A <br />
family of immortal cat girls serving an empty house for the rest of civilization, how poetic. But he couldn't contract HIMSELF, a hole could not <br />
go through itself, and a blizzard could not warm itself up by it's own power. And it felt too much like a coward's way out.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot to handle by yourself?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and that's why Kupochu is out finding new maids to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata smiled and nodded. The master had no idea that he might have just unwittingly planted a new dangerous idea in Hinata's head <br />
concerning playmates and family from her old life. The cat girl maids were, ultimately, free thinking creatures in spite of being bound by <br />
destiny to him. Time would tell if Hinata would think to act on this foolish idea, or weather she'd be inspired to from having no one else to play <br />
with her own age as the master repeatedly told her to 'play' but many games taking more than one player. The simple solution of asking the <br />
master to play with her did not occur to her at the moment. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Kopuchu had said within a week she'd bring back 'lots' of new maids to help with the work load, but she had after much disappointment and <br />
frustration she had only managed to contract one. Thankfully the week was far from over, the idea of having effectively lied to her master with <br />
her failure made her feel sick inside. But her progress was not encouraging. <br />
<br />
She had been sure that her friends she had as Carlson would have been perfect, and they would contract their friends, and those friends would <br />
contract their friends, and so on, until she had a full and complete staff to keep the house perfectly running for the master! <br />
<br />
But that plan had gone down the pipe. Her friends as Carlson thought she was joking, or thought she wasn't Carlson, or thought he was crazy <br />
for signing a magic contract to turn her into a cat-girl maid, or thought she was a foolish cat girl maid for wanting to be a life time servant, all <br />
depending on how far the revisions to fate had spread. Though none of them tried to talk her out of her new carrier choice. <br />
<br />
She bit the bullet then and contacted her family, they were polite and welcoming to their daughter, they didn't call animal control or ask what a <br />
stranger was doing in their house, but none of them had interest in joining her in employment as a house keeper. They were mostly happy that <br />
she wasn't mooching off them anymore. <br />
<br />
Recruiting Bachiko was a god send! Bachiko it turned out had been a drifter and no immediate friends or family in the area she could call on. <br />
This was a blow to Kopuchu's plans because she had been hoping Bachiko had a few contacts of her own that they could use to find <br />
contractees. <br />
<br />
The two attempted to trick people into signing with a fake petition, but the ink would always run dry or the pencil would break when the <br />
person would attempt to sign. Apparently while she could leave out details, she could NOT outright -lie- about what the contracts were and it <br />
had been a conscious and willing decision. <br />
<br />
They apparently couldn't be drunk either as the two sisters found out when they had tried to get some bar flies to contract but found they were <br />
too plastered for it to found as an act of free will.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know sis,&quot; Bachiko suggested as the two dusted themselves off from leaving the bar, &quot;Maybe we should just find people who are unhappy <br />
and have them contract?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kupochu implored, &quot;But I promise master LOTS of new maids! In a week! That would take a month to contract enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bachiko signed as she thought, wrapping her tail around herself. &quot;The rules say the person just needs to know they're signing a contract, and <br />
they have to have their wits more or less when they sign, and can't be forced into it. But everything else is fair game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so. Kupochu never asked master for details.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we should go back and ask master for them then, I'd like to meet him.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Chu seemed mortified by the thought, &quot;Go back-?! Without 'lots' of new sisters? NO! Kupochu won't! Kupouchu won't break promise to master! <br />
Next time master see Kupochu she has lots of new servers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand sister. But unless we can think of something effective and practical, we might just have to return to master and ask for help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We help master, not other way around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then THINK 'Chu! How do we solve this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; . . . There's always the soup kitchen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. That's good. And we can always just find day workers if need be. And remember with the economy there's going to be plenty of people <br />
more or less looking for jobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes yes you're right! Maybe we just going about this wrong way!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly. Now let's start recruiting sisters!&quot; While Kupochu was her sister and Bachiko loved her, Bachiko was beginning to shape up into the <br />
actual planner for the pair.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
A pudgy thirty year old faux blond woman sulked out of the unemployment office. She wanted to work, she had education and a good track <br />
record, but the simple fact was that no one was hiring. Being a single mother wasn't helping matters.<br />
<br />
The woman startled when she bumped into a teenager girl holding a clip board dressed in a cliche version of a french maid outfit. It wasn't <br />
Halloween. There was also a small table that had been set up. Strange there were a good number of chairs behind it and refreshments and a <br />
city map behind it, but only one other girl sitting down in a different but equally jarring cartoon style maid costume. The sway of their tails did <br />
catch her eyes however.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello and good day.&quot; Said the one with orange and black stripped hair with ears and tail to match.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you care to sign up for some long term employment with full medical and dental?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not interested in a 'cross-play cafe' work, or whatever it's called.&quot; But then again, what choice did she have?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it's not anything like that, well not really, your contract says you'll be treated fairly. And I promise you'll love the work. I'm Kupochu by the <br />
way, and this is my sister Bachiko.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please to meet you. Would you care to sign?&quot; <br />
<br />
The thirty year old woman read the contract, seemed like legal jibber or even a JOKE contract, whoever employed these girls must have been <br />
running a performance show or something, well, she did have no experience with acting, music, and the like, so, she signed.<br />
<br />
The woman felt dizzy as soon as the contract was signed, her fate, destiny, and the reason she even breathed at all being rewritten in the big <br />
book of everything. <br />
<br />
The two sisters were rather surprised when she stayed thirty years old, but lost a good deal of weight, her body become a lot more toned, and <br />
her skin tone also became a lot more pale. Her eyes turned pink, as did her hair, and cat girls and tail and other details emerged that marked <br />
her as being something other than human. She actually gained an inch or two. A dark magenta and white maid outfit morphed from her <br />
clothes, though her shoes dissolved leaving only paws like feet until the first two sisters. A frilly headband formed on her head at her now long <br />
pink hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I, what's going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Kupochu said, &quot;Everything will be clear in a second. Just think about serving master with us, think about living your home, think <br />
about how you're going to be a happy cat girl maid.&quot; It was rather strange for the two teenager cat girls to address one whose age not changed <br />
and remained thirty (and would be that age for eternity being now immortal). <br />
<br />
&quot;Happy . . . cat girl? Maid? . . I-&quot; Realization struck her brain. &quot;Oh yes! I know! I just can't wait to begin to service master! This is so wonderful!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So what's your name?&quot; Bachiko wondering if she'd name herself or if Kupochu would be naming her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Pimiko! I live to serve!&quot; The thirty year old cat girl maid saluted to her teenager seniors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to our family!&quot; The two hugged her, pressing against her motherly breasts, she hugged back.<br />
<br />
