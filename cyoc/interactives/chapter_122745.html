<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I walked out of Lisette&#39;s room.  I was reminded of my freshly-pantied pelvis with every step, my member hard within them, but concealed.  I arrived in the dining room, where my mom and Tabitha were already sitting, chatting merrily.  I joined the conversation and we spoke of idle things for a little while until Lisette announced that it was time for dinner.<br />
<br />
We dutifully washed up and took our places at the table, nicely set by Lisette.  She served us a dinner of chicken and rice.  A simple dish, to be sure, but Lisette&#39;s cooking was incredible.  The memories of the new reality told me that Lisette had worked many long hours to master her maidly duties.  Thus, the food was as spectacular as the house was immaculate.<br />
<br />
Lisette made to leave, to go sit at her traditional seat in the kitchen, apart from her mistress and her guests, but my mom stopped her.  &quot;Lisette, please, I think you should dine with us!  After all, our children are here visiting.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;d like to visit with you too.&quot;  Tabitha and I voiced hearty agreement, happy to have Lisette not be relegated to the kitchen.  Servant or no, she was family.<br />
<br />
Lisette blushed and curtsied, and did as she was instructed, taking a space next to us.  &quot;Nevertheless, Mistress, your servant shan&#39;t shirk her duties!  If Mistress or her guests are in want of anything, this servant begs them to be forthcoming in swiftly demanding it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be so,&quot; my mother replied.  We spent about an hour eating.  Lisette was very attentive in filling our drinks as they ran low, and retrieving seconds if they were desired.  She took the dirty plates immediately upon them being finished.  When everyone was done, she brought in dessert: an ice cream drizzled with red sauce.<br />
<br />
Tasting it I recognized the distinct musky flavor of my mother&#39;s pussy juice again within the flavoring.  The sauce turned out to be pomegranate syrup.  It turned out to be surprisingly delicious.  Tabitha said as much, and Lisette replied &quot;Oh thank you mistress Tabitha!  It is flavored with the divine taste of Mistress&#39;s pussy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t give me so much credit!&quot; said my mom in a somewhat embarrassed tone.  &quot;It&#39;s not all me.  The pomegranate adds much more flavor.  Plus, Lisette has been a bit selfish this evening.  You see, pomegranate is her favorite flavor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisette blushed deeply and turned away.  &quot;This one did indulge her selfishness, Mistress,&quot; she admitted quietly.  &quot;If this slave has erred, she begs Mistress to punish and correct her in any way Mistress deems most fit...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No punishment this time,&quot; said my mother.  Lisette looked relieved, but maybe also just a little... disappointed?  &quot;However,&quot; my mother continued, &quot;you will tell our guests how pomegranate came to be your favorite flavor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisette&#39;s blush let up slightly, but remained.  &quot;Well,&quot; she started, &quot;During the dark period years ago, when this servant sought to reshape her form and behavior to best serve Mistress, Mistress had kindly informed this one, in mistress&#39;s words: &#39;your balls will be the size of pomegranate seeds when we&#39;re through with them!&#39;  Most happily, this task was completed in due time.  This one has been most delighted in this fact, and as a result, pomegranate ever since has reminded this one of how far she has come to become the humble servant before you today.&quot;<br />
<br />
We were left to silently contemplate her words for a moment.  It was quite an unnerving thought, and a bit gross, to think that&#39;s what had happened to my dad.  I had to remind myself that Lisette, formerly my dad, was happy in her new life... that this is what he--now she--had most desired.  At least that&#39;s what my mother and my memories told me, though I wasn&#39;t sure I believed it.<br />
<br />
We finished dessert and wrapped up our small talk, while Lisette left for the kitchen to clean up.  My mom announced that she had a client to attest to this evening, but that it was nearby and she wouldn&#39;t be gone long.  We excused ourselves as my mother went upstairs to get ready.  After a few moments of us waiting in the living room she returned, outfit and make-up refreshed, carrying a large bag of &quot;tools&quot;.<br />
<br />
She told us, &quot;You can do what you like for now, and go to bed when you like, with the arrangements you had before.  If you need anything at all, just ask Lisette.  She has been instructed to attend to your every need and obey every request--so long as they adhere to my universal rules.  I doubt that would come up anyway, but she&#39;ll let you know if it does.  Anyhow, I will be back soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
With her out of the house, Tabitha and I weren&#39;t sure what to do.  Seeing Lisette milling about, tidying up not just in the kitchen but elsewhere, we decided to be out of her way and went into the backyard again.  In the backyard was a beautiful flower garden, with a gazebo on the other side.  We went to the gazebo and sat on the bench.  we made out for a while.  <br />
<br />
After a bit the sound of yelling brought us to a stop.  It was coming, apparently, from the next house over.  A man was yelling profanities and general verbal abuse at someone.  After a minute of listening we were able to pick up that it was his daughter he was yelling at.<br />
<br />
Tabitha nudged me and said &quot;Use the ring.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I was thinking of doing so already, so I wished &quot;I wish I knew the circumstances of that household.&quot;  The answer popped into my head right away.  It was a man and his only daughter.  His wife, her mother, lived there too.  This man, named John, was verbally and physically abusive towards his wife.  However, lately his wife had grown distant and was frequently not around.  As a result, his wrath had been directed more toward Leanna, his daughter, lately.<br />
<br />
I thought about the wife and why she was around less often.  Uh... it turned out to be one of the women who was jogging in the park this morning!  She was one of the ones I had wished would fall in love with the other jogging woman!  I thought some more and learned her name was Wendy and she had started dating Rachel, who lived at the house on the other side of our house.<br />
<br />
I wished to know about Rachel&#39;s household as well, and learned that she was married to a small and timid man named Lenny who found it hard to do men&#39;s work around the house and also found it difficult to please his wife.  They had a son named Simon who was big and muscular, unlike his dad.  The son was something of a bully at school, making fun of and beating up kids smaller than him for reasons relating to poor self esteem.<br />
<br />
I realized I could, and should, use the ring to help these families and their problems.  I looked at Tabitha.  She knew what I was thinking, and nodded.  I knew what she would have said too: &quot;Help them, but do it in a sexy way!&quot; she would have said.<br />
<br />
So I made some wishes.  &quot;I wish that Lenny would become a huge and muscular man named Lorne, with a big cock and who was incredibly good at anything stereotypically masculine, including working as a carpenter, handyman, and auto mechanic, and at golfing, fishing, and weight-lifting.  I wish that he loves sports and beer and sex.  However, I wish that he is extremely gay, loving men, especially small men, like a guy like him would stereotypically love women, and that he prefers to be the top during sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that John would become a small, scrawny man named Gilly who was timid and no good at anything stereotypically masculine, but that he would be good at sewing, cooking, and gardening, and would enjoy stereotypically feminine things like watching soap operas and daytime talk shows, keeping healthy with fad diets and exercises, and working in his garden.  I wish that he would never abuse anyone ever again.  I wish that he also was extremely gay, and I wish that even though he hates to admit it, he loves being the bottom during sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Gilly and Lorne would slowly and steadily fall in love with each other, first just passing fancy, then casual interest, and progressing slowly into a deep, loving relationship.  I wish that Rachel and Wendy would continue slowly falling in love with each other at the same rate as Lorne and Gilly, and I wish that they would not abandon their families as they do so as was previously wished.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Leanna would now become an assertive and strong-willed girl who has a strong aspiration to become a lesbian dominatrix, like my mother Francine.  I wish that she would practice her sexual and dominatrix skills regularly and that she would frequently visit my mother for practice and guidance.  I wish that her mother and father were very supportive of her life goals, and that when others aren&#39;t available to practice with, that her dad would offer himself for domination practice and her mom would offer herself for practice in lesbian sex, and that none of them would have a problem with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Simon&#39;s insecurities and need for bullying came from a deep desire to dress like a girl or woman, not always, but sometimes.  I wish that he really wants to join the all female cheerleading squad at the school and wear their outfits and cheer on the hot athletes.  I wish that he is bisexual and likes hot girls and had guys.  I wish that he would like dressing as a woman for other occasions sometimes too, and he would especially like to wear women&#39;s&#39; uniforms and costumes.  I wish he will want to change his name to Sally and that as he grows up he will become an expert and professional drag queen who loves to woo lovers and surprise them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that as time goes on and these two families come together as the mothers and fathers fall in love with each other, that they will still stay in their current marital status for convenience.  They will remain close to their original families though of course that love will become only platonic, but will be strong like family.  I wish that Leanna and Simon--eventually Sally--would become close friends, but would not become lovers due to incompatibility, but that they would become besties and support each other and help each other find love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish all of these things just wished would now come to pass,&quot; I concluded at last.  The shouting stopped.  I knew that though some effects would be seen immediately, the wishes were long-term and it would be a long time before they were fully fulfilled.  Tabitha smiled and kissed me, clearly impressed by the wishes.  They were what she asked for, helpful to others, and sexy at the same time.<br />
<br />
We sat quietly for a while, until we heard the sound of my mom&#39;s car pulling up from afar, over in the driveway.  With that we headed back inside.</p>
