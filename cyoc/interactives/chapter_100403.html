<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sammy was somewhat conflicted on Jessy&#39;s question. Doctor Sammy&#39;s answers made some real sense that on some level &quot;non-friends&quot; would want to be be friends on some level. However, a part of him also figured that the answer didn&#39;t necessarily refer to any conscious desire. Wanting to be a friend on the inside is one thing, but normal humans on the outside watching that wouldn&#39;t come to that conclusion. He remembered clearly not coming to that sort of conclusion before he became a baby fur. In that sense, finding a way to make sure baby furs had more control over their powers was important. So long as there were normal humans out there, they would be afraid that they were losing choices or losing what made them who they were. And the images of Teddy transforming his guard and a scientist without laughing himself was plenty of proof of that. That would only lead to fear and conflict, which Sammy didn&#39;t want.<br />
<br />
However, that part of his mind also wrestled with a great deal of curiosity as to what would happen with Teddy. Whether or not what Teddy had shown stopped due to Teddy running out of battery power or because Teddy turned it off for a moment didn&#39;t matter all that much. The baby fur that Sammy became had a fair amount of curiosity about what would happen to Teddy  next because of how it ended. With child-like fascination, he wondered if Teddy and his new friends made it to his sister&#39;s. He wondered if his sister realized that Teddy meant her no harm and only wanted her to be happy. It wasn&#39;t unlike when he was a little kid watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoons on television. He wanted to see what happened next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would there be anyway Jessy and I could come by later and see what happens with Teddy?&quot; Sammy asked to Doctor Sammy for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Doctor Sammy answered, &quot;but why would you want to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna see if the first fur knows more about how our powers work... if she has any ideas on how Teddy transformed his guard and the scientist... but don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t break my promise not to tell,&quot; Sammy answered, &quot;See if there is any way we can make so that normal humans aren&#39;t so afraid of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others looked to him briefly and Sammy continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might let us all be friends without humans needing to fear us,&quot; Sammy explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that makes sense, I suppose,&quot; Doctor Sammy commented, &quot;though you&#39;d need to come back here to see Teddy&#39;s updates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy nodded, &quot;I understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then turned to Jessy. He knew the raccoon baby fur was just as curious about Teddy&#39;s adventures as he was. He didn&#39;t want to force her into following him if she didn&#39;t want to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you wanna come, Jessy?&quot; Sammy asked her, &quot;I&#39;d like you to come... but if you don&#39;t want to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I&#39;ll come with you, Sammy,&quot; Jessy said to him, &quot;It&#39;ll be fun, and if Doctor Sammy will let us catch up on Teddy&#39;s adventures later, it&#39;ll be okay. It&#39;ll let us be explorers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy leaned over to hug her. He was happy for the answer as Jessy was his bestest friend. Doctor Sammy smiled to both of them as they hugged and waited quietly for a few moments. After a moment, she spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d best get to the airport if you&#39;re still wanting to find the first fur,&quot; Doctor Sammy commented, &quot;that&#39;d be the fastest way to get to Florida.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that they made their way out of the restaurant and caught a bus that took them to city airport, which was on the eastern part of the state capital. The building didn&#39;t look like it had changed too much outside looking like it was now made of plastic and was colored blue and white. When the bus came to a stop, Sammy and Jessy stood up and calmly moved into the aisle between the rows of seats on the bus and briefly looked back to Doctor Sammy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t say were exactly the first fur lives... but she does live in Florida,&quot; Doctor Sammy answered, &quot;I think Jackie Ville would be the place to start first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay,&quot; Sammy said to her and then gave Doctor Sammy a hug, &quot;thank you for everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be sure to bring you some interesting stuff if it might help your research,&quot; Jessy promised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Doctor Sammy smiled back, &quot;and good luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Sammy and Jessy got off the bus along with a couple of other baby furs and began to walk into the airport. Sammy privately marveled at all the changes that had gone on as they walked into the building. That was an element of their powers that Sammy found amazing and even helpful. If all the world changed, they would be able to remake it so that it worked, but that worked for them and Sammy knew that normal humans might be afraid of them for how they changed things. That fueled his reasoning for his mission. He didn&#39;t want humans to fear him or any other baby fur.<br />
<br />
They entered the airport building to find a bird baby fur standing inside holding a cardboard sign that read &quot;Jackie Ville&quot; in crayon.  She looked like a robin baby fur with dark brown feathers on her head and back with a short yellow colored beak. Her chest and belly were covered in red feathers, and Sammy could see long dark brown tail feathers sticking out of the back of her diaper. She didn&#39;t have true wings the way a mundane robin would look like. She had feathers on her arms, but for the most part her arms looked like any other toddler&#39;s arms. The feathers on her arms weren&#39;t long flying feathers like there were on normal birds and even more interesting, her hands looked like they were feathered. In that, it was like something out of a cartoon, but the feathers on her fingers looked very sturdy.<br />
<br />
Sammy and Jessy walked up to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re flying to Jackie Ville?&quot; Sammy asked, reading the sign.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m the pilot, do you wanna go?&quot; the robin baby fur asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sammy answered, &quot;I&#39;m Sammy and this is my bestest friend Jessy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessy waved to the robin baby fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Maxi,&quot; the robin baby fur replied, &quot;I&#39;ll be your pilot. We&#39;ll be leaving soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then pointed to a sign that hung from the ceiling. It was like an enlarged screen from a Lego airport set with a short list of flights, but instead of a listing of &quot;on time&quot; or the new expected time of arrival or departure, there was a smiley face next to the listing for Jackie Ville. Sammy and Jessy smiled at that.</p>
