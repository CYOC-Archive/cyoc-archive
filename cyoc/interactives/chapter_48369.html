<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Abby had been trying for two days to engage her brother in an activity that she considered rather girly. She had asked him if he wanted to play pretend with her. She asked if he wanted to play dress-up with her. She asked if he wanted to play house and dollies with her.<br />
<br />
And in each occasion, he had refused. But Abby had noticed something. Something that brought hope to her that her wish was working. And that something was a look in his eyes that surfaced whenever she asked him or caught him staring at her toys. A look she had seen on several occasions when she had walked into the living room and found Bobby watching a commercial or some programme aimed at a young female audience.<br />
<br />
But beyond those few times, Abby could not get her brother to engage in anything female. Disappointed slightly, she had decided to go over to Stacy's place and when her mother had left for work that morning, Abby had left as well, leaving her brother alone in the apartment and the hopes that he would do something very girly while she was out.<br />
<br />
Across the hallway, she had knocked and when Stacy's grandfather had let her in, Abby decided to be content with just having fun with her friend for the rest of the day.<br />
<br />
At about the same time Bobby was getting the mirror from his mother's room, Abby started to form an idea. As the day wore on and the hour that marked the third day came and past, the idea grew and grew, until Abby was sure of what she should do. Explaining, &quot;I have to go home for a bit. But I can try and come back later,&quot; to Stacy, Abby exited the apartment and started across the hall to her domicile.<br />
<br />
As she fished her house key out of her pocket, she heard someone downstairs begin climbing the steps up. Letting herself in, Abby paused as she realised that the apartment was dark and briefly wondered if she should turn on a light. And then she saw that a light was on somewhere and decided to investigate the source.<br />
<br />
Moving through the darkened apartment on cat's-paws, she made her way back to hers and Bobby's rooms. Stopping short, she saw that the light was coming from her room. Stepping up to the doorway, she peered in.<br />
<br />
Inside, she saw Bobby posing in front of her mirror, wearing what appeared to be her clothes. Covering her mouth to stifle the giggles she could feel coming on, Abby quickly composed her and stepping into the room, she took a look of surprise and exclaimed out loud, &quot;Oh!&quot; and waited.<br />
<br />
Before her, Bobby turned about and Abby saw that same look in his eye and then she watched as it started to fade and acting quickly on her plan, she said, &quot;You look very pretty, Aimee. If you want to wear my clothes, that's fine. What are sisters for? But please ask next time, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
In front of her, the look in Bobby's eyes intensified again and as he replied, &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Abby secretly smiled on the cleverness of addressing her brother by a girl's name to get him to do something girly. Before her, Bobby was picking up a doll of Angelina Ballerina and asking something of her, while behind her she could hear someone entering the apartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby? Will you play with me?&quot; Bobby/Aimee again and looking at her brother, thinking of him as a her and that this was her sister, Abby nodded and entered the room.<br />
<br />
Taking Aimee's hands...she wanted to think of this person as Aimee for the moment in hopes that it would prolong the way her brother was acting...Abby asked her, &quot;So what do you want to play,&quot; and then waited for an answer.<br />
<br />
In front of her, Aimee twitched back and forth, a look of thought on her face...which made Abby pause a bit because Bobby was taller than her and though his face had changed a little bit, it still was the face of a boy. After a bit, Aimee replied, &quot;Can we play dress-up? Just you, me and Angelina?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Abby was about answer back, when a voice exclaimed from behind her, &quot;There you two are,&quot; and turning her head, Abby saw her and Aimee's mother.<br />
<br />
Striding into the room, the woman entered Abby's closet, explaining as she did, &quot;Your Aunt Andi is town and wants to take us out to eat at a nice restaurant. Abby, can you loan your sister a dress. She's outgrown all hers and I haven't had time to purchase her anything new.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure, Abby watched as her mother take several dresses out and she laid them on the bed, she replied, &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; letting go of Aimee's hand as she did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will do,&quot; her mother said as she placed a dress that was all one piece on the bed. Looking at the dress with the green multi-tiered lower half and the white cotton top, she picked it up and handed it to her sister as her mother placed a matching dress that had a red lower half instead of green.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby...take your sister into the bathroom and I want you two to take a bath together before we leave. Okay,&quot; their mother said as she laid out two pairs of underwear and a two pairs of white tights from Abby's dresser.<br />
<br />
Nodding, Abby took Aimee's hand, noting that the look in her eyes was fading, she squealed out, &quot;Come on Aimee. Aunt Andi is visiting,&quot; and led her sibling out of the room and into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, cleaned and dressed...and enjoying the effect it had on her sibling when she addressed him by a girl's name...Abby found her and her sister sitting in the back of their mother's car. Sitting quiet in the back, she thought it to be good thing to see her brother squirm. On top of that, she found it to be very pleasurable to find out that her brother didn't have boy parts, but now had girl parts instead.<br />
<br />
Next to her, Bobby/Aimee was lost in thought as well. Mostly on his mind was what was happening to him. On one...and it was side that was growing...he liked the idea of dressing up and looking pretty. He liked the way the dress he was wearing looked on him...though he did have to wonder how he was able to fit in it. But at the same time all that was happening troubled him. The disappearance of his penis and testicles to what he now knew to be private parts like his sister's. The fact that his mother and sister saw him as a girl and addressed him by a girl's name.<br />
<br />
And that was the other thing. Every time he someone called by the name Aimee, that feeling of being mesmerised increased to a point where he lost himself completely. Running a hand over the fabric of the lower part of the dress, Bobby/Aimee shifted in her seat. Underneath he could feel the undershirt shift, while the tights he was wearing pressed closer into his crotch.<br />
<br />
Looking down, he stared at the black Mary Jane slip-on shoes he was wearing, wondered how he could fit into them, and then thought, &quot;If this keeps up, I'm probably going to wind up being a girl...which is not something I want. So, how do I stop what is happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
As he thought this, the car came to a halt and his mother climbed out. Assisting him and Abby out, she guided the two across the lot and into the restaurant.<br />
<br />
Inside, Bobby Aunt Andi hugged and kissed by and him, &quot;Oh you look so adorable, Aimee. And you’re getting so big,&quot; and before Bobby could say or do anything, his Aunt turned and began doting her attention on Abby.<br />
<br />
Shown to a table, Bobby sat down, but stopped when someone handed him a kid's menu. Unsure, he began to peruse the choices, while his mother caught up with her sister.<br />
<br />
Slowly, the evening passed and except for his Aunt treating him like a little girl and calling him Aimee all the time, the only thing he found more embarrassing was when he had to use the woman's toilet when he wanted to empty his bladder.<br />
<br />
After dinner, they returned to the apartment, where more bad news awaited Bobby. As his Aunt set her suitcase down, Bobby turned and began making his way toward his room, only to be diverted by his sister Abby, who asked him, &quot;Do you want to play with me? Maybe we could sleep together tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
The feeling of being mesmerised began to creep over him and trying to fight, Bobby lost just as his mother replied, &quot;That's a good idea Abby.&quot;Take Aimee and help her get ready for bed and I'll come tuck you two in a bit,&quot; and before Bobby could stop himself, he giggled like a girl and followed his sister at a run to her room as his mother called out, &quot;No running in the house, girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside Abby's room, Bobby/Aimee accepted the pyjama pants and shirt from his sibling and turning around, he asked her, &quot;Can you undo the buttons on the back of my dress?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Abby agreed and walked over to assist. Afterward, she turned and asked Bobby/Aimee if she could help. Afterward, Abby and Aimee shucked off their dresses and undershirts, and then each began to pull on their pyjamas.<br />
<br />
Handing her sibling the plush Angelina, Abby explained, &quot;I think she'll be happier with you,&quot; and then climbed into her bed.<br />
<br />
Excepting the doll, the feeling of being mesmerised waxing and waning, Bobby/Aimee cradled it in a motherly fashion. As he did this, he climbed in bed next to his sister. After a bit, their mother came in to tuck them in. Turning out the lights, she bid the goodnight and closed the door.<br />
<br />
Lying next to Abby, who was already asleep, Bobby stared up at the ceiling, the soft glow of the nightlight illuminating the stars that Abby had stuck there. Thought and thought raced through his mind, but none offering a solution to his problem. After a bit, he to slept. And as he slept, the room around him and his sister began to twist and turn until it easily accompanied two young girls instead of one.</p>
