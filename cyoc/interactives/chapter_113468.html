<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boys continued laughing at Austin as he picked up the dice. Austin was embarassed but even he had to admit it was a bit funny. He had a huge, muscle bound, hairy linebackers body, but he now had a hairless, tiny cock and balls. It was such a stark contrast! As he started to roll, he had to admit it was kind of nice not being so horny and having a clear head; the huge football member that Jack now had made so much testosterone and made him so horny! He doubted his new equipment could even get hard!<br />
<br />
Austin rolled and the laughter died down; the boys leaned in to see what the changes would be. Austin rolled a 4, moved his piece, and picked up a card. Knowing this game was for real now, he crossed his fingers and took a deep breath as he looked at his card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jockstrap&quot;, Austin began to read in his very deep bass voice. &quot;You already have the body of a jock, so why not dress like one? From now on, you can only wear jockstraps!&quot;.<br />
<br />
As soon as he finished reading, there was a flash. Austin looked down and saw he was now almost naked, wearing nothing but an obviously well worn jockstrap! It had various stains on it and looked like it hadn&#39;t been washed in weeks! Austin&#39;s mind, however, told him this was normal. It was his lucky jockstrap. He always wore it! Why would he wear anything else?<br />
<br />
It was wrapped tight around his large, muscular legs and waist, however, the pouch was very loose. Afterall, Austin had a very tiny penis now.<br />
<br />
The other 3 boys watched Austin and how he seemed to think his choice of clothing was natural. They looked at each other and shrugged; The board game must have changed Austin&#39;s mind to think it was normal.<br />
<br />
Reese was the next to pick up the dice. He glanced at his crotch and his massive, fleshy sleeve of a foreskin in disgust. He needed to change back! He rolled and got a 2. He moved his piece and landed on a special space. &quot;Orientation Change&quot;. He didn&#39;t know what that meant, and he didn&#39;t feel any different. Reese picked up his card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Age 5 years&quot;, Reese read to the group. Almost instantly he felt a puling sensation in his torso. Reese started to get a little bit taller. He groaned at the sensation. His muscles in his legs and arms started cramping up as well. Within seconds, Reese could see he was a few inches taller. &quot;Whoa dude, your getting bigger&quot;, Cody exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Reese stretched until he reached 6&#39;2, at which point he stopped. His muscles kept slowly expaning until they were a bit developed, but still lean. They were, however, not much compared to Austin&#39;s massive football muscles.<br />
<br />
Reese groaned, in a slightly deeper voice, as he felt like he was kicked in the balls. His balls began to grow slightly bigger and hang a bit lower. Reese looked down and noticed hair growing on his sac. His cock also began to get sightly bigger, but stopped shortly afterwards. It was already 7 inches before he pulled the card, so he didn&#39;t have much to grow. Unfortunately, the massive foreskin was still in place. Standing up, Reese could now see the foreskin hung almost to his knees!<br />
<br />
Reese looked down and saw light brown hairs growing on his legs and arms, racing up his forearms and legs. He saw a moderate sized bush push out around his member. A small line of hair grew up to his belly button. Reese felt his chest tighten as small muscles developed. His nipples went hard as a couple brown hairs pushed out around them. Other than those few nipple hairs, his chest remained bare. Reese felt itching under his pits as small brown hairs pushed there way out, finally giving him a normal amount for his age. Lastly, some very light stubble had grown around his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa&quot;, Reese said, his voice deeper now. He was now 23, and his body had done a fair amount of growing and catching up. He now had a moderate amount of body hair and some lean muscles. Although it was nothing compared to Austin&#39;s body, it was still impressive.<br />
<br />
Reese handed off the dice; he still hadn&#39;t figured out what the &quot;change orientation space&quot; meant, so he figured it was nothing. As he sat back down, he couldn&#39;t help but steal a glance at Austin. Man, his chest was so muscular and developed. ANd look at all that hair on his chest now! Reese felt him penis twitch a bit at the thought. He quickly turned his thoughts to other issues, wondering why he had been checking out his friend.<br />
<br />
Cody took the dice and rolled for his turn. He hoped it was good. He was desperate to change his body. It was disgusting and filthy now, exuding horrible scents, being covered in sweaty body hair, and he also had pubic lice!<br />
<br />
He rolled a 6 and moved forward. He set down his piece and picked up a card. &quot;Hung like a donkey&quot;, he said.<br />
<br />
Just then, he grabbed his crotch as he felt a tremendous and painful tugging sensation. He looked and saw his average member expanding, growing thicker and larger at a ridiculous rate! It quickly filled with blood and became very erect. With each pulse of blood into his engorged member, it became bigger and bigger. Likewise, his balls began to grow and hang lower, now about the size of tennis balls.<br />
<br />
Cody figured that the card just meant he would grow a very large package. However, Cody felt a wave of panic as his head began to flatten and expand, looking less human. As the package reached its maximum size of 16 inches, a large ring appeared about halfway down the shaft. As this occurred and the head began to get flatter and flatter, a bunch of loose skin began to form at the base of his crotch. His eyes bulged out as he realized that it was an animal sheath! He was growing a donkey cock!<br />
<br />
Cody watched in horror as the pigment turned a coal black at the tip and began to spread downwards. It quickly covered his whole member and swept down to his massive testicles. The changes stopped as quickly as they started.<br />
<br />
Cody and the rest of the boys looked at it in shock. The member was jet black and absolutely massive! The head was flattened completely, and the loose skin at the base had formed a full sheath. His balls were now about the size of baseballs. The room quickly filled with a very musky smell; Having already pulled the slob card last round, Cody&#39;s crotch began to stink as if he never washed it. The smell began to turn him on even more, to his dismay, and a bead of pre cum formed at the end of his animalistic cock! &quot;Whoa Cody! That&#39;s crazy! You have a donkey cock!&quot;, Austin exclaimed in his bass voice.<br />
<br />
Cody was disgusted! Not only was he a nasty slob, but he now had an animal&#39;s cock attached to his body! He no longer possessed the genitals of a human being; they now belonged on a huge, dirty farm animal. He reached down and cupped his giant balls. He shuddered to think that they were now producing donkey sperm, and that the only children he would ever be having would be donkey kids.<br />
<br />
Jack grabbed the dice from Cody. &quot;It&#39;s my turn. We have to finish this! If we don&#39;t, we will all be stuck like this!&quot;. <br />
<br />
He rolled and got a 1. He landed on a &quot;draw two cards&quot; space. He groaned.<br />
<br />
Jack picked up the first one and read it aloud. &quot;Permanent Erection: You never have to worry about not getting it up, because you will always be hard from now on&quot;.<br />
<br />
As soon as he read that card, he felt a stirring in his crotch as the blood rushed into his member. He looked down at the huge, hairy member he now had, that used to be Austins. It very slowly began to pulse and get slightly harder and harder. It slowly rose up and out as it became more full of blood. Finally, the hairy member was fully hard, pulsing slightly and extending out from the impressive thatch of pubes 11 whole inches. Jack groaned at the feeling. Reese couldn&#39;t help but stare at his friends new member. For some reason, he was feeling turned on as well.<br />
<br />
Jack cupped his hairy balls and groaned; &quot;Oh man, it feels so hard. It&#39;s making me so horny&quot;. He had no idea how he would function with his member like this from now on. It was pulsing and aching it was so hard, and he was ubelievably horny. On top of that, there would be no way to hide it in his clothes anymore! It would be like an 11 inch steel pipe in his pants, not to mention it was now leaking precum like a faucet! &quot;Oh man, it really aches and hurts you guys. Its the hardest erection i&#39;ve ever had&quot;!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry up, draw your next one!&quot;, Austin tells him. Jack reluctantly reached down and draws his last card; &quot;IQ Drain. Say goodbye to 25 points of your IQ&quot;. <br />
<br />
As soon as he reads that, he feels a rush through his body. His eyes go glassy as they lose his previous shimmer of intelligence. Jack suddenly can&#39;t seem to think straight. What was he doing? A drop of drool escapes his mouth as he tries to concentrate. He looks down at the card in his hand. What did it say? He tries to read it, taking considerable effort. &quot;I.... Q.... Duh... rain....&quot;. He stops and looks at his friends, who seem terrified by Jack&#39;s loss of intelligence.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean? I don&#39;t under stand much. Reading too hard too&quot;, Jack mumbles. He tries really hard to remember what &quot;IQ&quot; was, but he as no idea. He shrugs. It doesn&#39;t matter, and it hurt him to think to hard anyways. He looks down at his huge hairy erection. &quot;Why cock hurt so much. Why it hard?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh guys. We need to finish the game. Jack is as dumb as a bag of rocks now!&quot;, Cody said in a worried tone. They all looked at Jack. A vacant look on his drooling face as he explored his new 11 inch erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. We need to finish the game&quot;, Austin agreed. Austin picked up the dice and prepared to start round 3.</p>
