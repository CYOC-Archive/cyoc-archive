<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well, it’s a problem, something that if Jared told you about ah…, he is gone, ah elsewhere and will come back on Friday next at 8:00 pm. He has a mission, or ah no, as that really isn’t the right way to address the issue!<br />
<br />
What I mean or want to need explain is ah…, Jared is, as here, this was his lucky coin. He, Jared did not realize what this coin could do as…, ah, now let me think!<br />
<br />
As told to me, when Jared had the coin in his pocket, ah it was waiting, or would do a curse, cursing him to if he donned on an item of clothing that was previously worn by someone else, the curse would change the wa-warer’ to become that other person!<br />
<br />
However, in the case, the situation what is as a problem for our Jared to work out, he came out to the barn and was not properly dressed for the weather. He had this coin or this Medallion if you consider its size. Anyway, as of what I was told, that Jared got cute and to keep himself as warm, he made use of,  donned, covered his shoulders, chest and back, and using the Velcro straps, he wore then the horse blanket last used when Jasper was alive.<br />
<br />
The Medallion rules over a curse set in place some centuries ago. It began to assert the ramification of the curse, but Jared said a wish and asked an open question about what he saw he was becoming; and that questioning worked to open a dialog, of questions and answers between our son and the, this Medallion.<br />
<br />
Jared saw that through the curse being put to changing him, he would be as one of the damned, and with his heart and head thinking to try as save his religion, he requested the ability to revert on the weekends to being his human self. This horse what resembles Jasper is the cursed embodiment of our son. Jared is as was Jasper when he had worn that blanket, and Jasper the dead life entity is alive again and also living as a co-owner of this horse; as I think that tells how I heard it as told to me!” Bob Morrison said, and after the long explanation to his wife he stood there looking like an embarrassed, humiliated man with his hat in his hands; hoping his wife would be as believing.<br />
<br />
“Jasper huh,” said Margery as she walked slowly from being by the barn doors facing toward the house. “And this is now my son, my Jared!” <br />
<br />
As the Misses walked up to facing the horse, and she acting as bold and blunt, said as asked, “Jared, and if you were to nod your head four times for me I would believe that what your father just said is not a foolish story.”<br />
<br />
Jasper looked toward his dad and then swung his head to facing at his stern faced mother, before he paused for a moment, as inhaled deeply and then sighing, Jared did nod his horse head four times as asked.<br />
<br />
To which Misses Morrison turned around and with her back faced toward Jasper, she whispering, asked then, “Do you ever go with us to attend church on both Sundays and twice a month go to the prayer service on Wednesday nights; stop a hoof once for yes and twice for no!”<br />
<br />
Margery was watching her husband to see if he would do anything to signal the horse as how to answer, she wondering if the new stallion was a trickster. What she saw her husband do amazed her, as Bob walked around to standing behind Jasper, where the horse could not see him at all.<br />
<br />
“Thump – thump,” Jasper did raise and clump down hard his left fore-hoof to signify the correct response, a profound “No” answer.<br />
<br />
Misses Morrison then turned to again as facing the horse, she grimaced a small smile before saying, “A left-handed horse, and why not sense my son was left handed. As is this horse knowing my religious son does not attend the Wednesday service because he bowls on a league on Wednesday nights.<br />
<br />
My son knows the reality of Earthly, Natural, and of Demonic as did out minister preach his Sunday morning sermon based on Corinthians 3, verses 19-23; as again a single hoof stomp for a Yes answer and two stomps…”<br />
<br />
As just then the horse did one hard tromp of his left fore-hoof onto the barn flooring boards!<br />
<br />
Margery turned quickly to look into the eyes of the horse Jasper, and then she looked past the horse to see her husband was crying.<br />
<br />
“Divine providence wins the day, and as for you Jared, I hope on the coming weekends you will join us at both services. As on Sunday morning and also go to the vesper service at 7:00 pm Sunday nights; you need not make a reply. Well now, let me get a good look at you, as yes you do resemble Jasper in every way, even to that small scare where a mare took a bite at your right shoulder.” Margery said, and her husband Bob then exploding said, “You would believe all of what I said, like really?”<br />
<br />
“You were telling the truth, and my questioning of Jared did well to prove that Jasper is alive again, and our son is cursed!<br />
<br />
Now then, as much of what you said and Jared proved is his new reality, I would say this situation does not set well with me, and is correct to specify, that our son has a curse put on his life. As you my husband, you gained back your prized stallion for use as a working stud; and Jared being as was Jasper seems to be relishing his being a stallion!<br />
<br />
I suggest you put our son to pasture and let him eat… his greens, as then you come to the house and we shall have a wife to husband conversation about what became of our son.” The Misses so said, and Bob took hold again to Jasper’s lead reign, and lead the fully aroused stud stallion to where he could munch his erection back into its sheath.</p>
