<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Lenny Schroeder was having the strangest day. He’d left his wife and kids behind in a small subdivision twenty miles out from the small Arizona city he patrolled and almost as soon as he hit the city limits he started feeling odd. He loosened his tie-a navy blue one that his wife said matched his blue eyes-and opened up the first button of his shirt. At first he thought it was his breakfast acting up-he’d eaten waffles with his kids and was pretty full-but he quickly realized he was starving for some reason.<br />
<br />
He didn’t have much time before his shift started but he couldn’t ignore the ravenous rumblings of his gut. He ran his hand down to pat it and found it far squishier than it should be. He glanced down, and was shocked to find himself staring at a rather doughy gut. The hard-won abs he’d maintained for almost three years had been replaced with a small paunch. He rubbed it and pinched it slowly, fingers digging half an inch deep into his newly formed lard. Each touch and pinch of his fingers across the slowly growing belly was electric-so much so that he could feel his cock jolt to life in the oddest erection. He was so mesmerized with playing with his new gut that he jumped when a car honked behind him.<br />
<br />
Lenny blinked. He couldn&#39;t even remember pulling into McRonald’s, but he had, and the car in front of him had already made their order and gone. He rolled down his window and rolled forward. When the young woman asked what he wanted, he found himself ordering more food than he’d ever ordered for his entire family.  He got his meals and pulled out of the drive-through and was halfway down the street and stopped at a light when his phone rang. He reached over to check who called when he realized he was holding a half-eaten McRuffin. <br />
<br />
Wrappers strewn about him indicated he’d devoured two others in the less than thirty second drive to the light. The light turned green and he drove on autopilot and stared at the half-eaten McRuffin. His stomach rumbled. Lenny took a breath and went to work on the rest, hand digging into the other packages, mouth chewing with a gusto. The cool air from his AC tickled the hairs of his burgeoning gut as his shirt untucked itself from his dress pants as it rode up to his slowly budding moobs.<br />
<br />
“The weirdest day ever,” Lenny mumbled, mind divided between the food and the road. <br />
<br />
He dug into the glove box with one growing paw, the dusting of black hair on his fattening forearm spreading rapidly as he dug out the pill bottle. Antisomnolants to ward off hibernation. It also aided in decreasing his currently swelling anxiety.  He downed the pill with a huge pull from a half-drunk two liter of Fountain Dew. He eyed it critically, wondering for a brief moment where it had come from and questioning if it had been a can before, then his thirst surged back in full strength. He shrugged and drained the whole thing in one big chug. Then he tossed it in the backseat with the other empty ones.<br />
<br />
A voice in his head was telling him everything was wrong, he wasn’t supposed to be a hugely obese, hairy slob bursting out of his civilian clothes-clothes which were quickly mending themselves and enlarging to keep up with his furry gut and floppy moobs, which now sagged on either side of his beach ball-sized belly. His hand brushed his pepperoni-sized nipple and felt a shock of pleasure shoot from it to the tip of his dick. His hand moved further south and gripped the side of his gut and gave it a jiggle. His whole body wobbled in a pleasurable wave. He blushed and felt a bit of warm pre trickle down the side of his cock.<br />
<br />
His hands went to loosen his tie and found himself grasping empty air. His proper starched dress shirt changed colors from white to a muddy brown that better matched his green eyes, the buttons became crumbs from his McRuffin which his paw brushed off. The seams of his button-up melded together and a logo from some game formed on it. It took him a second to realize it was the Quad Force from the Legend of Esmeralda. Of course it was, how could he forget such a classic! <br />
<br />
He reeled for a moment, wondering how he knew anything about nerdy shit like that, but new memories inserted themselves. No longer was he a track star in high school, but he spent his days on his Mintendo and online games. As these new thoughts roiled around his increasing foggy brain, his dress pants rolled up his larger, furrier legs, revealing hairy cankles, the material shifting into khaki as they became cargo shorts. Dress shoes quickly shifted into sneakers, the backs stretched from him never actually unlacing them, just shoving his growing paws into them.<br />
<br />
The car was changing too. What was once a tiny, spotlessly clean Boyota Borolla shifted into a huge black Bord 6x6 Dualie truck.  He needed it for his near-7 foot, five hundred pound anthropomorphic black bear form. Wrappers and cups littered the passenger side to the extent that it overflowed onto  the seat itself. His backseat was just as filled with wrappers and cups and spent two-liters. The smell of new car changed just as quickly to slightly rotten garbage which Lenny didn’t mind at all-if anything, it made him hungrier. As he stuffed another McRuffin in his face, a growing pressure on his finger threw him off. His digit was much fatter than the gold band was scaled for and it started to hurt. He checked for cars behind him so he could pull over and take it off, wondering why he hadn&#39;t gotten it resized.<br />
<br />
When he checked the reflection in the rear view mirror he did a double take. <br />
<br />
His face looked...off. <br />
<br />
Not just the double chin that welled into existence as he stared, quickly becoming a third and a fourth chin, as rings of fat began to encircle his head, That tended to happen when you ate as much as he did. His face itself looked off. His nose was wider, darker and moist and his lips seemed to overhang his face a bit too. His whole mouth, he realized, had pushed out, making the sudden growth of his beard all the more noticeable. <br />
<br />
As he stared, he felt something well up deep inside him, somewhere near his ever-growing stomach. Lenny held it back. He would never be so crass-but the pressure wouldn&#39;t relent, increasing to an unbearable level. He struggled to hold it in, but the tremendous belch erupted from his mouth with such force that it propelled it forward into a full-blown copper furred muzzle and sent his blackening jowls wobbling.<br />
<br />
The belch startled him so much he that almost swerved into the curb. When he pulled back onto the road and searched for his turn-off, he found the world looked much more bleary than it had moments ago. He blinked and rubbed his eyes. He couldn&#39;t read any of the signs now. Suddenly, there was a *pop* and a pair of thick prescription glasses appeared at the edge of his snout. He ginned. Of course he just needed his glasses, bears had notoriously bad eyesight. <br />
<br />
Lenny shook his head and wondered what was wrong with him today. He rubbed his gut that now sagged between his thighs like an apron, clawed paw raking his soft round form idly as he thought about what could be the cause. Then it struck him. The pill! He wanted to smack himself in the head. Of course! Doctor Smitz had said that dissociative episodes were a possible side effect. He’d just hang out with his partner Rusty and talk to him about it to ground him in reality, maybe jerk him off. Wait...no? That&#39;s not something...<br />
<br />
Lenny struggled with his memories, but his mind circled back to Rusty and his sexy-his boyfriend. What he would love to do with them. He licked his chops and blushed but pushed away the thoughts. He would never, of course. He was straight and had a wife and kids….but for the life of him, he couldn’t seem to remember their names. Or their faces. The ring on his finger, which had started to really pinch, disappeared. Lenny gave a sigh of relief and rubbed the pins and needles out. What was he thinking about again?<br />
<br />
Marriage? Lenny snorted at the thought and scratched at an elongating and furry ear. It twitched in response, his long tongue lolling out automatically. Rusty had told him the ears were an androgenous zone and he never believed him, but if the tent in his pants was any indication, he’d hit that nail on the head. Guess dogs weren’t the only species that enjoyed a good scritch! He chuckled, a low rumble that managed to scare even him.<br />
<br />
“Where did that come from?” Lenny rumbled.  &quot;WHOAH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Every word had such a profound bass to it. He guessed it was due to all the weight and huge frame, but it still surprised him. <br />
<br />
He blushed, remembering when one of the drivers he’d stopped had jokingly asked if he’d become a bear to have an excuse to eat all the donuts he wanted. Which was silly because he worked out every day-Lenny paused. Did he? He was very sure he used to be-had to be, to enter the Academy and pass. More memories filtered in. He&#39;d been a skinny twig of a cadet and had applied to become a bearman but hadn&#39;t realized how much work it took to maintain a muscular figure like the bearman in the recruitment posters had. Hours spent in a patrol car hadn&#39;t helped and he hadn&#39;t had any motivation and now....he stared down at his gut and patted it. It wobbled, the pressure shift on his ccock, buried deep in the folds had him gasping. He&#39;d never realized how sensual being fat was until now. He remembered when Rusty had suggested hitting the gym with him and Lenny had half-jokingly told Rusty that only thing he ever worked out was his gut and the only shape he was interested in becoming was round.<br />
<br />
Rusty hadn’t taken that well. Lenny remembered the sudden disgust he’d seen flicker across Rusty’s face, as, just for a moment, he’d actually grimaced and rolled his eyes before he seemed to mentally switch to his regular, happy tone. Lenny shuddered, the reaction full body as it sent his fat rolling around.  Rusty had let his boyfriend suck him off once…Troy, he recalled. He licked his sharpening fangs. Yeah. What a hot tigerman. Troy definitely didn’t mind Lenny’s weight, seemed to really enjoy playing with it, which made him feel warm and tingly. The memories made his cock spurt even more pre, his shorts practically soaked by now. <br />
<br />
Lenny&#39;s guts roiled again, more pressure growing. He shifted himself in his seat. The final change occured then, his legs and thighs growing massive in his pants as he felt another rumble, this one lower in his guts. He didn&#39;t bother holding in the roaring fart that sent his widening asscheeks jiggling, the movement letting the nub of his bear tail to pop out of the hole that had appeared in his pants just for it. He sniffed, lips wrinkling in disgust at how foul it was and rolled down his window to let the air in. That one was too much even for him to handle! <br />
<br />
He chuckled. Rusty would&#39;ve killed him if he&#39;d let that one slip out during their patrols. Poor dog. <br />
<br />
His cock throbbed in his pants, though, oddly, the tent it was making wasn&#39;t as visible as it used to be. Lenny fiddled with his jockstrap and dug around in it to relieve himself. A quick jerk before he started his shift wasn&#39;t out of order. Maybe it was just what he needed to get his head right. He expected to find his thick seven inch cock but his paw instead got lost in his furry fat pad. Lenny blinked his heavily lidded eyes. Where had his cock gone? His padded fingertip brushed past a hard little nub of flesh and he moaned.  <br />
<br />
Was-was that small thing his cock? He could have sworn it was bigger! His fingers accidentally rolled the nub between them and he moaned again, the stain in his pants growing darker. He reached a little lower and fondled his balls, which rumbled and churned and grew another inch in circumference as he held them, now almost the size of cantaloups. Yeah, of course he didn&#39;t have a big cock. He was a heavy producer and a...bottom? As if in response to his quest, his asshole began to itch and tingle.<br />
<br />
Gingerly, Lenny reached back-an action that took alot of effort on his part-and gently inserted one fat finger into his rectum. His tongue lolled in pleasure and the warm tingles in his cock intensified. He shoved his finger as far in as he could and almost shouted in joy as his cock spurted even more precum into his jock, the truck filling up with the stench of bear musk. Lenny flexed his finger and felt his paws curl from pleasure as he seemed to have bumped something in him that had stars fill his eyes. He removed his finger and was about to insert again when he heard an audible *pop* and suddenly his asshole felt pleasantly stretched and filled.<br />
<br />
Lenny blinked and felt around his ass. His paw touched a strange rubbery plug. His heavy furred brows curled in confusion before his face lit back up again. Right! Rusty had given him a whole set of beginner buttplugs to get him used to handling big dicks. Of course he had, no one could take that twelve inch red rocket without some serious practice! He briefly wondered why his finger smelled like ass if that buttplug had always been there but...he sniffed it again...it didn&#39;t? He could have sworn.... Lenny wrote it off with a shrug. The plug would get him all the way quicker than his finger would anyways.<br />
<br />
The big bear took hold of the buttplug and began to shove it in and out. He panted heavily, precum oozing from his nub of a cock in a steady stream. He&#39;d have to change his pants later. Lenny huffed in and out in tandem with the plug, the tingling in his cock intensifying with each passing second. <br />
<br />
A car honked behind him. He flushed and pulled over and used his now free hand to pinch and tug his nipples, sending firey jolts of pleasure to his cock. He was so close, he could feel pressure building in his cock, welling up, the tingles and warmth too much for him. His paw went from his nipple to his gut and slapped it, sending his fat wobbling. In and out the plug went, smacking his prostate each time, truck rocking in tandem with his movement. Waves of pleasure washed over him.<br />
<br />
Lenny&#39;s long tongue lolled from his mouth. Oh god, he was gonna...he couldn&#39;t hold back, he wasn&#39;t even touching his cock, and yet he was still gonna....!<br />
<br />
And then something else snapped into place with a *pop*, appearing just as suddenly as his buttplug had. The pleasure ceased just on the cusp of orgasm. Lenny blinked. He looked down and saw a gleaming silver cage had ensnared his cock and balls. He groaned, memories flooding in, of Rusty scolding him for jerking off before he&#39;d come over and spoiling the night for everyone for having desensitized his cock. It took three hours before he could cum, he remembered, embarassed. So Rusty had locked his cock in the cage to train him. He&#39;d take it off when they met up to have sex, of course. Lenny wondered what had compelled him to try to fuck himself with the plug. Hopefully Rusty invited him over today, he was really horny and it was clearly scrambling his brains.<br />
<br />
The big black bear finished his sandwiches and pulled into his parking space at the HQ. The truck rocked as he rolled himself bodily out of it. His butt plug, only half-lodged, nearly fell out. Lenny quickly straightened himself out and shoved the plug back in, sending a jolt straight to his crotch when it bumped passed his prostate. Thankfully, his enormous gut overhang would hide the large wet stain on the front of his pants. <br />
<br />
He adjusted his clothes and found himself panting and slightly embarrassed. Maybe he did need to hit the gym after all. Didn’t need to stop eating, but some muscle mass might be good. Doc said he could pack on the muscle just as fast as he packed on fat, after all. And maybe Rusty wouldn’t look at him…the way he’d looked at him. He wondered if Rusty stared at him like that when Lenny wasn’t looking. <br />
<br />
The big bear shook his head. He needed to at least pretend to workout with him, then, though he’d much rather go home and play with his…Lenny paused…kids? No, play against kids on his PS5. Duh! Kids. Lenny scoffed, spittle flicking from his flews. He had a hard enough time talking to women, let alone getting married and having kids with one. It would take away from his Fortnite time.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Rusty, the well-muscled German Shepard Anthro stepping out of a sweet Mustang. He’d gotten it after a big drug bust a month ago. Lenny hadn’t even thought of the advantages of joining the force as a canine-anthro. He’d just wanted to be big. He blushed again. Really big.<br />
<br />
“Hey Lenny, lookin’ good big bear!” Rusty called out as he strolled over.<br />
<br />
Lenny waved and lumbered to meet him. “How’s life?”<br />
<br />
“Had a bit of fun with Troy.” Rusty frowned. “You still haven’t activated the gym membership I gave you.”<br />
<br />
Lenny rolled his eyes, “You don’t like fat guys, right?”<br />
<br />
“No. They’re disgusting slobs.” Rusty shrugged unapologetically. “Troy likes them just fine though, which weirds me out. Look, if you don’t want to work out-”<br />
<br />
“Will working out make you stop shooting me dirty looks?” Lenny asked. <br />
<br />
Rusty looked at him in shock. Lenny was also surprised by his own forwardness. He was a gentle giant…but he had different memories there, too. Like he’d once kicked a guy’s ass for looking at him the wrong way, like Rusty had. A growl rumbled in his throat. Maybe that’s what Rusty really needed-<br />
<br />
“Whoa big guy!” Rusty stepped back, arms held up in front of him, and Lenny realized he’d stepped forward to loom over him. &quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry for mocking you, okay! I just..didn&#39;t know you were so into it. Nice shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, thanks.&quot; Lenny shook his head and stepped back. “J-just knock it off with the teasing. I’ll go to your stupid gym for an hour a day, five days a week and lift weights. No cardio. I like being big.”<br />
<br />
Rusty had a strange look on his face, speculative, almost…calculating? Lenny was pretty good at reading people. He was an interrogator, after all. That outburst of aggression had changed Rusty’s perception of him. <br />
<br />
“Yeah…like a powerlifter…yeah, I can work with that.” Rusty seemed to be speaking to himself. <br />
<br />
Lenny shrugged, “If that’s what you wanna call it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the uh, stuff I gave you?&quot; Rusty pointed at Lenny&#39;s crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s uh, been difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet.&quot; Rusty grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, I felt really weird today. Can you believe that I thought I was married?”<br />
<br />
“You don’t say.” Same speculative look. He knew something. Which was strange.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, maybe it’s the pills. Disassociation or whatever.” Lenny found himself saying.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you come over after your workout? You can use our shower.” Rusty gave him a lewd wink. &quot;I&#39;ll wash that big gut of yours myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rusty gave his belly a pat. Lenny blushed and his nub of a bear tail wiggled. Rusty was acting awfully suspicious, but if ignoring that meant he’d have Troy’s amazing tongue on his cock and Rusty&#39;s cock up his ass...<br />
<br />
“I’d love to.” <br />
<br />
Rusty smirked and they went inside and started their shift.</p>
