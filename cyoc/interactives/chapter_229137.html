<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark for his part was extremely patient, explaining why certain ideas were probably a bad idea for someone new to D&D and suggesting more powerful races or classes for each build. Even coming up with good backstory ideas on the fly.<br />
<br />
Troy was conflicted. His head was still trying to figure out his course of action to get the book, His body was still exhausted from using his earlier, and now he wasn&#39;t sure he even wanted to go through with this. Mark was clearly just trying to work through some personal shit and enjoying himself in peace and now Troy was potentially going to steal the thing that gave him the ability to affect the world in any meaningful way. <br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that he had a boner that would not go away. He didn&#39;t think Mark would be his type. Then again, Dustin was his type and he wasn&#39;t exactly excited to try that again now that Dustin was finally back to normal. Maybe if he could convince Mark to cooperate, they wouldn&#39;t have to fight at all? What if Mark wasn&#39;t even interested? He would have to be a little subtle about his intentions.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Anyways, You could be the Gnoll bard but  Gnolls are a non-playable race by default so we would have to homebrew it.&quot; Mark explained. &quot;Also the modern setting would put a bard as more of a rockstar and that might be hard to explain your involvement in the party. We can work around this with the right backstory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, aren&#39;t bard&#39;s notorious for having sex.&quot; Troy said. &quot;Would that make things awkward if I am constantly having to roleplay sexy encounters opposite you?&quot; The question was asked in earnest but Troy realized his emotions were spilling out in his words again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not unless you want it to be awkward. I&#39;m a pretty open minded guy. If you&#39;re wanting to fuck the NPCs into submission, your perfectly within your right to try&quot; Mark smiled, looking up at Troy. He let his gaze linger on Troy before winking and looking back at his notes. Maybe he was interested after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind that at all. Sounds like something we would want to do in private though&quot; Troy whispered just loud enough for Mark to hear.<br />
<br />
Mark stopped writing things and straightened his back. Looking across the table at the shorter man. &quot;Wait a minute.&quot; A smile crept across his lips. The look would have probably been more powerful and sly on almost any other man. On Mark, it looked kinda silly but no less cute. &quot;Was this&quot;, He gestures toward everything in front of him, &quot;your way of asking me out on a coffee date?&quot;<br />
<br />
And the Dominos began to fall. If he was to get out ahead of this, he needed to be upfront with his information and ask for collaboration. &quot;I guess, in a way, yeah. Though I admit I had some ulterior motives.&quot; Troy steeled himself. &quot;I uh… know you have a book. The Book of Myth to be specific.&quot; Mark&#39;s cocky demeanor faltered and he looked a bit pale.<br />
<br />
&quot;I… I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; Mark shifted uncomfortably. Clearly trying to get closer to the book in his bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you have it because I have The Book of Beasts&quot; Troy gestured to his bag. &quot;I don&#39;t want to fight you!&quot; Troy quickly added. &quot;I think we might be able to work together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark seemed skeptical. His hand reached into the bag and pulled out the book. Troy followed suit. Neither broke eye contact. &quot;This puts a damper on what I thought was just a coffee date. So what&#39;s the play?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I might be able to help you and you might be able to help me.&quot; Troy said, flipping to the back of his book where several blank pages were set. &quot;Do you honestly want to be an elf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye-...&quot; Mark almost answered yes immediately. He thought for a second then sighed. &quot;No, Elves have this natural feminine beauty to them and I was hoping that if I was an elf I could actually start getting hits on the dating websites I use. I just want people to see me as attractive.&quot; He looked over at Troy. &quot;I was excited about this potential date.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can still be excited.&quot; Troy encouraged. &quot;The plan is for me to create a new animal to your specifications and then transform you into it. You can also transform me into a mythical creature and we can both come out of this happy. If you still want to… enjoy each other&#39;s company after that, I am willing to do that.&quot; Troy gave the cockest smile he could.<br />
<br />
Mark thought about it. &quot;But I can&#39;t be transformed in a way that is natural to the world. I&#39;ve already tried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The transformation only changes reality if the recipient doesn&#39;t witness you transforming them. You will always be a witness to your own spells so it doesn&#39;t work. If we change each other, it might actually stick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok… How about we go back to work because we are going to be late otherwise and we both transform each other into what we would want the other to look like. Then we can go on a date after work.&quot; Mark seemed excited again. Troy was nervous, some incredibly cautious part of him told him this was a dangerous gamble. He decided to ignore it <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.&quot; Troy said, putting his book back in his bag and getting up from the table. &quot;Let&#39;s see what you can come up with for me. I already gave you some ideas of what I like.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two made their way back into the office building, occasionally giving side glances to each other. Once they got in the empty elevator, Mark pulled Troy close and kissed him. Troy willingly returned the kiss. The kiss lasted for a few seconds before they separated as the elevator opened. Each walking back to their desks as if nothing happened.</p>
