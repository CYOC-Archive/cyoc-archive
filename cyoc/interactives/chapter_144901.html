<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well Randy, I&#39;d say you porked out on that cake!&quot; Rexie the imp grinned, in spite of her form being younger than randy, the little boy wet himself. Where the cake had transformed young Zack into a towering wolf-man and now part of the line of King Lycaon (the first werewolf), and cured him of his fatal disease... The bully Randy, who before had been tall for his age... had been turned by the cake into a green skinned creature with the head of a pig, covered in mud. <br />
<br />
And Zack shifted into his wolf form... and Randy had squealed and dirtied himself again. And had covered his head and cowered, exposing his curly tail. His feet now hooves. His eyes red, and his hair black. <br />
<br />
Ayami The Succubus, with only Randy getting a clear view, briefly shifted into her true form as a succubus, an old woman with a nightmarish face... this scared Randy even more! The bully was now scared witless. <br />
<br />
Rexie and Ayami both saw... Zack didn&#39;t have it in him, yet, to devour his pathetic and helpless prey... &#39;I guess that makes sense, Zack sees himself as a super hero right now... I  he never read many anti-hero comics,&#39; Ayami thought. <br />
<br />
But Zack sure wanted to SCARE Randy as much as possible! The wolf beast howl and snarled, and put his fangs around the green pig boy&#39;s neck and shook it. Randy squealed. <br />
<br />
&quot;From now on! You work for Zack! You&#39;re HIS stooge!&quot; Ayami said. &quot;But don&#39;t worry about anyone laughing at you... as far as anyone knows, you&#39;ve always been the creature you are now, covering yourself with mud. Your friends, your teachers, your parents. THey&#39;ve only known you as you are right now! Unless you&#39;d rather feed Zack some bacon right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;M ZACK&#39;S STOOGE! I&#39;M ZACK STOOGE!&quot; The bully wailed. <br />
<br />
Zack let go. &quot;Good! ... Let&#39;s play tag! Your it! You get a five second head start!&quot; Randy ran away from his family backyard squealing. Randy&#39;s parents looked outside, and only saw their green piggy son playing with the towering wolf Zack, and saw nothing wrong with that. <br />
<br />
Zack would toy with Randy for a few minutes, then grapple him... Randy closed his eyes wondering what the inside of Zack&#39;s stomach would look like... and Zack gave him a noogie. Randy open his eyes, to find Zack grinning down at him. &quot;Boo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Randy squealed and shut his eyes again. Zack gently put him down. <br />
<br />
&quot;And this is what it always feels like to be scared of you... from now on, you be scared of me. And I don&#39;t want you bullying anyone else, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;G-GOT IT! BOSS!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well this is fun...&quot; Rexie said, &quot;But I&#39;ve got to go see Mia...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If... what Lilith said is true... and she wiped away Rex... that means Mia doesn&#39;t remember me...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You hate Lilith for that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Maybe.&quot; Rexie said a little darkly. &quot;If that&#39;s the case... either way. She&#39;s always been a wiz at computer like me. I wanna see if she can form a pact with me to become a witch...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that make you Mia&#39;s familiar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe. Either way, she&#39;s the only thing from my life as Rex that mattered to me. If I have to rebuild my friendship with her piece by piece, I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++ <br />
<br />
But as fate would have it. Something had happened since Rex had been turned into Rexie.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; said a Japanese woman with a umbrella, hat, and black coat. &quot;I am here for Mia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing at the front door, Mia&#39;s father said, &quot;But you&#39;re not Mia&#39;s regular babysitter! Where&#39;s Clara?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh she&#39;s very busy now... &quot; Indeed, being an expensive glass doll was time consuming work. &quot;But that doesn&#39;t matter... I am here for Mia...&quot; Fox tails emerged from under the woman&#39;s coat, as little balls of flame floated around her. &quot;And you will give her to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Rexie teleport to Mia house... she turned invisible and intangible and floated through the walls. Nothing was different. &#39;Guess I didn&#39;t matter that much to their lives after all.&#39; But then she realized something else... &#39;Where is Mia?&#39; The little girl was missing from every family photo! Her toys were missing! And Rexie floated into her room... and found it was now a study. <br />
<br />
Rexie snarled. And appeared in a burst of flames in the family kitchen. Her former self&#39;s brother and sister-in-law startled. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are-&quot; She grabbed her brother by the forehead and hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is Mia?!&quot; Her former self&#39;s brother shook, and Mia found to her shock... Mia was missing from his memories, in fact, it was like there was cut out pieces of his memory missing! She forcibly let go of him and grabbed her old sister-in-law who had been reaching for a fire extinguisher, and found that her memories of Mia had also been forcibly removed. Rexie sniffed... and what sound have been Mia&#39;s room overwhelming smelled of magic... Rexie teleported around the house, looking for any clue... she found the strong trace of magic... a few white fox hairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Rexie teleported away. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
&quot;What a pair of adorable children... &quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie and Jack turned to see a Japanese woman, wearing a white fur coat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh hello,&quot; Kellie said awkwardly. Both she and Jack felt at unease, but weren&#39;t sure why. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no need to be worried children, I mean you no harm. I am just a woman who wishes she&#39;d had a family of her own... And such exceptionally wonderful children you are... such power inside you... You&#39;d be perfect... You are perfect...&quot; Rainbow colored swirling flames appeared around her, and Jack and Kellie found themselves drawn to those pretty swirls... They couldn&#39;t look at anything else... didn&#39;t want to look at anything else... There was just the pretty swirls, them... and mama...<br />
<br />
&quot;Now my dears... let&#39;s me off to home...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mama,&quot; the two echoed, shrinking down to adorable eight year olds. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Morgan began brawling her eyes out. She sensed it. As did Lilith, and all the other magically inclined present. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
Circe sensed it, she had the same &#39;baby watch&#39; on Jack as did Baba and Lilith... and she knew who Lilith would blame on the spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit! Vixi! Manage the paper work while I&#39;m gone! No human should give you any trouble giving over the deeds to the land, and will happily give you the loop holes the modern merchant princes of your world use to avoid giving tithes to the rulers of the land.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure my goddess? I don&#39;t want to fail you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve sculpted you through my own will Vixi, no human alive can resist you. You may not be able to turn men into pigs and women into dogs on your own, yet, but you will be able to make them putty in your hands, figuratively of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you goddess! I&#39;ll begin working out the formalities! Will you be using your magic to convert the park into a commune for our kind and an attraction for unwitting human, or shall I look up construction crews?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll discuss that with you after I&#39;m back!&quot; Circe teleported away. <br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish goddess!&quot; Vixi said, only hoping she could prove that the faith her goddess had placed in her was not misplaced. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
&quot;CIRCEEE!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lightning crashed, and the witch appeared. Circe snarled in indignation, &quot;I swear by Cronus himself, that kitsune is NOT one of mine! I prefer animals that AREN&#39;T empowered by magic of their own unless they&#39;ve earned it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Baba Yaga appeared, saying, &quot;As much as I&#39;d like to see Circe get lectured, she is innocent in this incident dear, and we don&#39;t have time to waste.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith snarled, her eyes glowing solid read, her fangs and claws showing as she grew in height, &quot;All of you!!! GET. ME. BACK. MY. SON!&quot; <br />
<br />
Katie demanded, &quot;What is going on?! Did something happen to mom and dad?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Lilith hissed. &quot;I can smell their stink! I can&#39;t sense their present nearby anymore! But I can sense the presence of kitsune! DO YOU KNOW HOW KITSUNE REPRODUCE?! They don&#39;t! They&#39;re barren! Or at least this branch of them are! The only have one means of gaining children of their own! Most just go after orphans, but some want to get &#39;high quality&#39; material.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SHE TOOK MIA! My little niece!&quot; Rexie teleported in, flames in her eyes and coming out of her mouth. &quot;LET ME AT HER! I was gonna help her become a witch to be proud of! I&#39;m not letting who she is get wiped away!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirty-seven.&quot; Claudia said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say fifty if Merlin goes after the kitsune together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika! What are you two betting on at a time like this?!&quot; Katie demanded. She felt exactly the same as Rexie and Lilith right now. <br />
<br />
&quot;How many pieces that kitsune gets torn into by the time Merlin and Lilith are done with her.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;ll be lucky if there&#39;s anything left for Boss-Mother or the Old-Goat when I&#39;m done with her! No one hurts Mia!&quot; Rexie snarled. She put on a green-camo army helmet (with holes for her horns) that clashed with her cute white swimsuit and rubbery red skin.<br />
<br />
Lilith meanwhile summoned a Hell found that she placed a saddle and mounted in 18th century lady-like poise. &quot;Kill everything that stands between me and my son.&quot; She said calmly. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
Ayami startled, sensing the voice from the mother of demons and turned to Zack. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Zack... looks like you&#39;re getting your first superhero rescue mission! And it&#39;s on a timer! How do you feel about a fox hunt to save some kids?&quot; <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Now do you love?&quot; The white kitsune asked, now in her eight-tailed fox form, wearing a red kimino with black trim. <br />
<br />
&quot;We love you mother.&quot; The three children said entranced, their eyes swirling, fox ears having popped out of their heads, little fox tails emerging from their behinds, and fur ever so slowly spreading. <br />
<br />
The kitsune startled... sensing... enough power to make even a nine-tails quiver... heading straight for her... Her mansion had defenses against meddlers... But this... was unexpected... But she didn&#39;t need to hold them off... only delay them. <br />
<br />
Once upon a time they had been war vets, disabled and left to be forgotten by the country they&#39;d lost life and limb for... Now they were her personal guard, experienced soldiers, fox-men beasts, as able to fight with their claws and fangs as uzis or shotguns, or with magic to turn meddlers to ash. <br />
<br />
&quot;I sense we have intruders coming to take my new children from me... do not let them pass until all my new childrens&#39; essence had been turned into my own and their old selves are lost forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It shall we done, we shall die for you mistress,&quot; the hulking fox-man said. &quot;Bert! Charlie! Doug! Mistress commands it! Let none intrude upon her! Kill them all!&quot;</p>
