<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Merritt had a fitful night of sleep.  <br />
Part of it was he much he&#39;d hated being stupendously fat.  Six foot one, 165 pound Merritt had always been a slender pretty boy, always been a superlative runner.  He&#39;s used the Chronivac to take it even further, fine tuning his body such that he could run 400 meters in just 45 seconds.  But that was sort of going from 98 to 100 on the fitness scale.  <br />
Making himself a 500 pound super fatty in response to an overweight neighbor&#39;s words about knowing what other peoples&#39; lives are like was a reasonable use of the machine.  But an hour later Merritt shuddered just thinking of how his body felt in that transformation.  His enormous gut!  His buns like a humiliating  pair of medicine balls back of him!  He shuddered.<br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t even shuddered at being turned into a fly.  <br />
<br />
Stray thoughts of being 500 enormous pounds did not help Merritt&#39;s sleep.  But there was also doubt creeping into his mind about Etta.  She was super  hot, one of the hottest women he&#39;d ever seen and easily the hottest he&#39;d ever dated.  He&#39;d been partial to the smart girl next door type in high school and college.  Etta was almost as tall as him, blond and slender with a face and body that inspired guys to walk into street signs and doors.  Merritt almost couldn&#39;t believe his luck in meeting her at a club right around the time he was let go from the NSA.  And with the little improvement to his skin that he got from the Chronivac, they made a great couple.<br />
<br />
The sex was incredible and non-stop.  Whenever they were together, they were doing it.  Merritt was surprised that such a high class woman like Etta would let him do everything and so often but she did.  That was why, when she whispered wanting to do . . that, in his ear, he didn&#39;t immediately say no.  How could he when she hadn&#39;t said no to anything?  It was . . okay, that&#39;s the best that Merritt could have said about her putting on a strap on and bending him over the side of the bed.  What stuck with him more was her surprised laugh.  He&#39;d told her that he&#39;d done ballet but as a 10-12 year old because his sister was in the class and in college with his girlfriend.  He wasn&#39;t gay.  <br />
<br />
Etta had laughed, with surprise at how hard it was to jam the strap on up his pristine hole.  &quot;Oh my god, you really haven&#39;t been stretched out before!&quot;  He&#39;d been offended, &quot;I . . . danced . . . ballet . . . I  . . . never . . . did . . . it . . . with . . . guys!&quot;<br />
<br />
She really thought he&#39;d been bi and had probably had a bunch of guys take advantage of him because he was pretty and showing himself off in ballet!  Did she really understand him at all?<br />
<br />
And that had added onto another doubt.  It had been two months now and they&#39;d had hours and hours of fantastic sex.  But he didn&#39;t know her and she didn&#39;t know him.  What did he really know about her except her body, that angelic face, those blue eyes, those perky round tits, that great ass?  He was a sort of traditional guy.  But what about her?  She barely knew anything about him.  That was crazy.  Didn&#39;t girls always want to know everything?  She didn&#39;t seem to care, still, after two months.  He started to wonder.<br />
<br />
Anxieties intertwined and fused.  Merritt was in the living room of his apartment.  He was naked.  He was enjoying the sight of his slender trackstar body in the full length mirror placed against the bookcase along one wall.  In the middle of looking over his shoulder at his spectacular buns, he heard his overweight neighbor, Suzanne, in the hallway yelling something at him.  <br />
<br />
Merritt went on looking at himself in the mirror but suddenly the image was changing.  First his face got a little puffy and then his distinct 8 pack abs got a little puffy and less distinct.  Then, his hips deepened and widened.  He reached back in shock, feeling his ass as it deepened and widened some more.  His thighs, too, had become immensely thick.  And now his whole body blimped out, an enormous gut expanded out from his belly and rolls of fat covered his sides and back.  He had a half dozen chins and his face was so fat and swollen that it looked like it might pop if a needle was pressed to it.  Even his hands and feet became so this as to be disgusting.  He got heavier and heavier till he heard Suzanne&#39;s voice in the hall,   &quot;500 unless she loves you this way!&quot; before diminishing in exiting laughter.<br />
<br />
Merritt looked at his shocking reflection in the mirror.  He had buried penis, hidden and inaccessible behind his massive gut hanging down over it.  His chest looked like a worst case scenario for gynecomastia.  If his massive rump had been any bigger he might&#39;ve been assigned a jockey.<br />
<br />
And now there was a knock at the door.  &quot;Merritt!  It&#39;s me, Etta!&quot;<br />
He panicked, initially thinking of throwing some clothes on but he didn&#39;t have anything that fit this humiliating 500 pound body.  <br />
&quot;Um, it&#39;s-it&#39;s not a good time, Etta!&quot;<br />
&quot;There&#39;s never a bad time for you and me,&quot; she fairly purred at the door.  <br />
He didn&#39;t remember giving her a key but, to his horror, he saw the bolt turn and the door open.  Etta came gliding in with her usual smooth sashay.  She dropped her bag on the counter saying how much she was thinking of his great ass and great big dong before stopping in front of him.  Her jaw dropped.  &quot;You&#39;re-you&#39;re . . !&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 500 pounds now,&quot; admitted Merritt.<br />
She looked him with complete disgust.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re Merritt?&quot; she demanded, her fast scrunched up in revulsion.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I . . I . . think I offended a neighbor.  She put a sort of fat curse on me,&quot; he said gesturing to his shockingly obese new body.<br />
Etta backed away.<br />
&quot;But, she said that I&#39;d return to my 165 pound self if . . . if you did it with me.&quot;<br />
Etta&#39;s eyes went wide.<br />
&quot;I should do it  . . . with a world record fat ass like you?&quot;<br />
&quot;But, honey, don&#39;t we have something serious?&quot;<br />
She shuddered and her voice got shrill.   &quot;You&#39;d crush me if you got on top of me!&quot;  She pointed where his penis probably was behind his gut.  Merritt wasn&#39;t much surer of its location than she was.  &quot;How would I even get to your thing?  It&#39;s big, and I love that but it&#39;s not three feet long and that&#39;s what I&#39;d need to be able to even touch it.&quot;<br />
&quot;What about . . ,&quot; Merritt began hesitantly &quot;What about . . . that?  You-you liked doing that to-to me.&quot;<br />
She snickered and pointed.  &quot;Have you seen you big your ass is?  I think the strap on would have to be three feet long just to do you.  And the idea of touching that ass you have now is enough to make me puke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, honey, if you don&#39;t do it with me, I&#39;ll be stuck like this forever,&quot; Merritt pleaded.  He added a whimper and a sob.  Finally Etta slowly approached him.  Merritt held out both hands to her, his sausage fingers sweaty.  Her hands seemed tiny in his immensely fattened paws.  Merritt pulled her gently toward him and stretched his neck forward, the multiple chins of his neck becoming more distinct as he did so.  He pushed his lips forward to kiss her, feeling tremendous gratitude toward her for overlooking his temporary quarter ton mass.<br />
But their lips never met.  She couldn&#39;t do it.<br />
&quot;Ewww!  You&#39;re so fat and sweaty and disgusting!&quot;  She flailed her arms against his mudslide of a chest, bouncing off it then the rolls of fat that projected more than a foot out from his side.  She hit the ground and scampered quickly away from him.<br />
<br />
Merritt had tears in his eyes now.  &quot;But, Etta, I&#39;ll be stuck like this for the rest of my life.  Don&#39;t you care for me?&quot;<br />
Suddenly, from nowhere, there was a mannequin of naked 165 pound ballet dancer and track star Merritt off to the side in his living room.<br />
Etta went to it and rubbed a hand across extra round, drum tight little buns and kissed full round lips below cheek bones sharp enough to cut deli meat.  <br />
&quot;This is what I cared about,&quot; she said giving the mannequin lascivious caresses.<br />
Of all times, at that moment Merritt let out a stupendous fart, seemingly amplified by his enormous ass.  <br />
Etta looked at him with disgust and shook her head.  He shuffled slowly toward her pleading with her but with one push of her lady&#39;s hand he started falling backwards, unable to control his huge new spherical body.  He fell backward into the couch, his quarter ton mass crushing the seat and some of the structure of the couch under him.  With a grunt he tried to move on from his humiliating awkwardness and extract himself from the couch but his astonishingly large ass was wedged in tight, some sort of board or strut wedged up the middle of him and each gigantic buttock extended irretrievably into the frame of the couch.  Try as he might, Merritt couldn&#39;t extricate himself.  His grunting efforts were accompanied by Etta&#39;s laughter.  And finally he realized that, with his impossibly obese new body, he was caught and would never get off that couch.  He would die there.  And Etta caressed the naked mannequin of his former body but only laughed and laughed at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh!&quot;<br />
Merritt woke up gasping.  He jumped out of bed and in the half light coming through a window looked at his naked self.  He was six foot one.  He had a 29 inch waist and 4% body fat.  He caught his breath.  Maybe his pride in his slender athleticism always meant at least a degree of discomfort in contrasting physical attributes.  And weighing 500 pounds had been shocking and disconcerting.  But what did this mean about Etta?</p>
