<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cautiously, Ric and Josh approached the door. &quot;Go on, pollo grande,&quot; Josh hissed, but he wasn’t smiling when he said it. Ric, eyes shut tight,
<br>
 reached out, turned the knob and violently threw the door open. 
<br>

<br>
 A loud snort from Josh shocked Ric into looking. There, in a Looney Tunes t-shirt and denim overalls, stood a boy, about 10, who could have
<br>
 been a shoo-in for the job of poster child for Hayseed, Inc.: gap-toothed, with a swath of freckles spread across his rosy cheeks and nose, the
<br>
 pudgy face was set off by a protruding set of jug ears. A stray cowlick of pecan-colored hair stuck up at an acute angle near the back of his
<br>
 scalp. A wheat stalk stuck into his mouth was about all that was missing to complete the picture. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Um, can we help you, little boy?&quot; Ric began. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Kids. Pfeh! Just what I don’t need,&quot; snapped the boy, a slight lisp softening his speech. He continued talking, but something was odd - both
<br>
 Ric and Josh could see his lips moving in synch, but the voice they heard wasn’t coming from the boy - it was as if it was inside their heads.
<br>
 What’s more, this was the gruff, low, strident voice they’d heard earlier. No lisp now. Just a clear tone that cut through any outside sounds. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Make way for Yenarek, o foolish ones. Know that I am the most powerful of powerfuls, the scourge of mine enemies, whose bones bleach in a
<br>
 thousand lands. Immortal I may be, but do not waste my time!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Determinedly, the boy brushed by Ric. &quot;Ah, yonder be my mace and my shield. Just the two? Ah, well, no matter. Now!&quot; With that, he snapped
<br>
 his fingers. 
<br>

<br>
 Marco, suddenly no longer confused and aimless, snapped to attention, his gaze fixed on the boy. &quot;Protect!&quot; he shouted, then strode forward
<br>
 and slammed the door shut. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;What the....&quot; Ric and Josh both thought. Mr. Mendes, who had not looked well before, was positively becoming hideous now. Greenish-black
<br>
 scales covered him all over, his nose had all but receded into his skull, leaving two large flared nostrils. Francisco's lower jaw protruded
<br>
 noticeably now, in turen making his chin recede. A narrow tongue flicked out from thin, cold lips every few seconds. His arms were tight against
<br>
 his sides; slowly swaying in a small semi-circle, now-yellow eyes fixed on the boy. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Behold the power of Yenarek,&quot; the disembodied voice announced. &quot;One shall guard my physical form with his life so long as I am present. The
<br>
 other shall make a fine symbol of the power of Yenarek, an icon to bring despair into the hearts of those who oppose me!&quot; He moved leisurely
<br>
 to an armchair and plopped down, sneaker-clad feet dangling off the floor. One lace was untied and hung, frayed, in the empty air. &quot;Now, about
<br>
 my book. I sense you have made use of its power. Two of you, hm? Good. Good. Two are but half as formidable as one. Yes. Yes. Come, you
<br>
 may now approach.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Approach, my ass,&quot; Ric said. Motioning for Josh to follow, he began to run straight at the boy. &quot;You change Mr. Mendes and Marco back, you
<br>
 little snot — uh!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 A large, stron hand clamped down on Ric’s shoulder and stopped him cold. Another did the same for Josh. &quot;Protect!&quot; It was Marco. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ow! Hey, leggo, amigo. C’mon, that really hurts!&quot; Josh said. &quot;Protect!&quot; was the only reply. 
<br>

<br>
 Yenarek laughed, an oily, rasping sound. &quot;My guard will squeeze until you bleed, if I so wish.&quot; he said. &quot;I can call him off, if and when you are
<br>
 ready to show some sense.&quot; he reached into the chest pocket of the overalls and pulled out a stick of gum. Slowly unwrapping it, he paused just
<br>
 before popping it into his mouth. &quot;Well?&quot; he asked. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;O–okay,&quot; Ric said through teeth clenched in pain. &quot;We give.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Wise,&quot; answered Yenarek. He waved his hand towards Marco, who forced both Ric and Josh to the floor, then released them. &quot;Know this,
<br>
 whelps, and know it well and true. Defy me and die. It is but that simple. Know you the whereabouts of my book?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Josh and Ric looked at each other. &quot;Yes,&quot; Ric whispered. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Toy not with me,&quot; Yenarek snapped back. &quot;Speak up and speak truly.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Yes,&quot; Ric said, louder and more steadily. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Good, good. Yes,&quot; Yenarek replied. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;How do we know it’s yours?&quot; Josh piped up. &quot;I mean, you could be, I don’t know, some evil guy trying to get it from its rightful owner.&quot; Out of the
<br>
 corner of his eye, Josh saw Ric turn and look at him, wide-eyed and with his mouth agape. Josh, having blurted out the challenge wothout
<br>
 stopping to think, was just as stunned at his act of bravado. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ha! Spirit, eh?&quot; Yenarek laughed. &quot;Good, good. There may be a use for the lot of you after all.&quot; he pulled the wad of wet, chewed gum from his
<br>
 mouth, reached over and pressed it against the bottom of the chair. &quot;Fortuitously, my calendar is free just now. It would amuse me to answer.
<br>
 But beware - stay where you are - my guard may not be as – forgiving – as the beneficent Yenarek. Understand you my instructions?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Ric and Josh both gulped and nodded. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Good, good. Yes,&quot; Yenarek nodded in reply. &quot;Thus begins the tale of Yenarek and his book of changes. Know you that thousands of years
<br>
 ago, before the rise of Greece and Rome, before the first pyramid was begun, lived a powerful sorcerer, Yenarek by name. Mastered the
<br>
 arcane arts of all types, he did, yet he realized that in ut a short span of time he would pass this world as do all who dwell upon it. Yenarek
<br>
 studied and prepared for years, both mentally and physically, to cast The Great Spell, one that no one on this plane had dared try to fathom,
<br>
 much less perform. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;That spell, my pups, was for immortality. And work well it did. But Those Who Oversee Existence are not without a sense of humor. Once cast,
<br>
 the spell was irreversible. With the level of knowledge achieved by your society, I can explain what ocurred. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;The spell changed yenarek at a genetic level. To compensate, Those Who Oversee existence provided a balancing factor - Yenarek would be
<br>
 incapable of passing his gift to any progeny. Thus have I, the powerful Yenarek, been trapped in this ludicrous form ever since. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I discovered as time continued its unstoppable tread that I did not age. But there were other cosmic payments stacked on the opposing tray of
<br>
 the scale that came to light as well. First, my powers would have little or no affect on those who also had not yet achieved man or womanhood. 
<br>

<br>
 Think not that this gives you any advantage. There is no advantage in facing Yenarek. When your friend there (here he pointed to Francisco)
<br>
 answered my summons, the mighty Yenarek cast spells to bring all of age who were within range of my voice under my thrall. Such a shame
<br>
 there were only two. No matter, they will dispose of you with dispatch if I so wish. Second, my own memory and ability to retain knowledge was
<br>
 becoming that commensurate with my apparent age. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;While still able, I transferred as much of my skill and knowledge as I could onto a series of tablets. Since, they have been enshrined in scrolls,
<br>
 on parchment and, in this age, into a series of books. Apparently one of my minions, in a futile attempt to escape my service, managed to steal
<br>
 away with the Book of Changes, which later came into your possession, I know not, nor care, how. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I sense that the Book has bonded with you already. This is a small inconvenience, but none that the eminent Yenarek cannot undo. Understand
<br>
 you this tale? Do you desire more? I find this interlude amusing, but warn you that Yenarek tires of amusements quickly.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 During this monologue, both Ric and Josh had gone pale. Ric felt a trickle of cold sweat running down his sides. Josh was nervously tugging at
<br>
 stray locks of his hair. &quot;Um, yes, I think so,&quot; Ric said. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Then bring me my book, you vomitous excuse for a boy,&quot; Yenarek shouted. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;It – it – it’s going to take both of us,&quot; Ric began. &quot;I can’t reach it alone.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;And both of you are here still?&quot; snarled Yenarek. &quot;Begone and do my bidding. Your telephone has been silenced, the windows and doors of
<br>
 this abode sealed. Yenarek shall admire his formidable handiwork on your friends, but my patience is not without limit. Now go!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Ric moved first, literally grabbing Josh’s shirt and hauling him up and towards the bedroom. Yenarek had apparently lost interest in them as
<br>
 soon as they agreed. &quot;Guard, refreshments to celebrate my foreordained victory,&quot; he said to Marco. &quot;Yes. Good, good,&quot; he intoned, one hand
<br>
 absent-mindedly reaching out to stroke Francisco’s scales. 
<br>

<br>
 Once there, Ric closed the door. &quot;What’re we gonna do, Ric?&quot; Josh blurted out. &quot;I mean, we’re way over our heads here. But we’ve gotta find
<br>
 some way to change Mr. Mendes and Marco back. I’m scared, bro. I mean really scared, right down to my center.&quot; Josh sniffed, and Ric could
<br>
 see tears begin to well up in his eyes. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Listen, Josh, I think we may have one chance. Something that – kid – in there said gave me an idea. It might not work, but follow my lead,
<br>
 okay?&quot; Josh nodded and wiped his sleeve across his face. 
<br>

<br>
 Ric lifted up the mattress and retrieved the book fro where he’s hidden it earlier. He sat on the bed and opened it. The book was still blank. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Come here, Josh,&quot; Ric whispered. &quot;Give me your hand.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Holding his own hand on top of Josh’s, Ric moved both of their index fingers to the open page. As soon as they made contact, one word
<br>
 flickered into view. &quot;Yes. I thought that might be it. Remember when – he – said that two were half as strong as one? It’s going to take both of
<br>
 us to do this. The book must have bonded with both of us, since we used it together, or something, I think.&quot; Ric hissed, uncertainly. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;This isn’t going to work like this,&quot; Josh offered, as understanding dawned. &quot;Let me get behind you.&quot; Here, he jumped up onto the bed and knelt
<br>
 behind Ric, then reached his hands around Ric’s body. &quot;There, let’s try it like that.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Paired hands moved across the page, one word at a time appearing as their touch traveled. Josh had to crane his neck to see of Ric’s
<br>
 shoulder, but they both were able to softly read the words as they showed. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;&quot;Ric, I don’t think anything’s gonna happen,&quot; began Josh. &quot;Oooh, Jesus, I feel kinda – weird – all of a sudden.&quot; he tried to remove one hand to
<br>
 steady himself, but the boys’ hands were stuck fast. &quot;What the holy hell?&quot; Josh asked. &quot;Ric, I — glrumph....&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;What’re you...&quot; Ric began, then felt Josh’s weight press on him. &quot;No, wait a sec,&quot; thought Ric, &quot;Even Josh isn’t that heavy. What is...&quot; The
<br>
 weight increased, deadweight, pressing deep into Ric’s back. 
<br>

<br>
 Now Ric tried to get a hand free, and was awestruck to see that his and Josh’s hands had begun to fuse together. &quot;What – did – we – do?&quot; he
<br>
 thought. Slowly, then picking up speed, Josh’s body and Ric’s, partially liquefied, melted together into a large, roughly human-shaped mass,
<br>
 then coalesced a little smaller, a little more defined, until, finally, thankfully, there was one boy sitting on the bed. The whole process had taken
<br>
 no more and 15 or 20 seconds, but had seemed like hours to Ric and Josh. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;You okay?&quot; the boy said aloud, softly. &quot;Yeah, I’m okay. Am I here, or are you?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I think it’s both of us, dude. Like we’ve become, I don’t know what to call it,&quot; the boy began. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;RicJosh,&quot; he interrupted himself. &quot;Yeah, that’s it! ‘Two is half as strong as one.’ The book made us one. It MUST want to stay with us.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 RicJosh, carefully, stood up and stretched. To anyone outside, the boy would have looked like neither Josh nor Ric individually; the fusion had
<br>
 created a whole new set of features, but there were still bits around the eyes, the mouth, the way he carried himself, and so on that were
<br>
 reminiscent of either one of the two who had been there but moments before. Their clothing has melded as well, creating a carnival of colors
<br>
 and patterns, not displeasing, but certainly not typical young teen attire. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I/we do feel more, I don’t know, powerful,&quot; RicJosh said to himself. Entwining his fingers together and cracking his knuckles, RicJosh reached
<br>
 onto the bed and flipped open the book. A short spell, only covering one-quarter of the open page, showed, the letters almost glowing. RicJosh
<br>
 flipped through other pages, but all were blank save the one. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;That must be it. One shot and one shot only,&quot; RicJosh thought. Sitting on the edge of the bed, he began to memorize the short string of odd
<br>
 words. The effort came unusually easily to the newly-melded boy. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Dawdle not longer, feckless ragamuffins!&quot; Yenarek’s voice boomed in RicJosh’s head. &quot;My thirst has been slaked and I long to hold once
<br>
 more my dread volume!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ready? Ready.&quot; RicJosh concurred. Holding the book, he stood and took a deep breath. &quot;One, two, three ... let’s do this.&quot; RicJosh strode to
<br>
 the bedroom door and briskly walked into the living room. 
<br>

<br>
 Yenarek was standing, poking at Marco and feeling the man’s muscles. 
<br>

<br>
 Three steps into the room, RicJosh quickly repeated the memorized spell. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ah, the sound of magic ... what?&quot; Yenarek said as he turned to face RicJosh. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;My book! Hand it to me, quickly! I — &quot; All the rest was reduced to a gurgling sound. 
<br>

<br>
 RicJosh watched, rapt, as Yenarek seemed to waver in and out of focus. His skin blanched and his hair lightened to a bright white. 
<br>

<br>
 His outline still shifting, Yenarek folded in on himself, and simultaneously shrank down ... smaller ... smaller, until all that remained where he
<br>
 stood was a rumpled pile of boy’s clothing. 
<br>

<br>
 RicJosh moved forward, and saw a lump moving under the shirt. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Protect!&quot; Marco shouted, and pushed RicJosh aside. Reaching into the fabric, Marco pulled up, by its tail, a shrilly squealing white mouse. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Protect,&quot; he said again, holding the mouse up, his arm extended, just out of RicJosh’s reach. RicJosh, emboldened by his/their success thius
<br>
 far, used all his strength to move forward. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Protect,&quot; Marco again shouted. He grabbed the mouse’s tail between the thumb and forefinger of his left arm and used his right to push
<br>
 against RicJosh. &quot;Protect!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 RicJosh strained and grunted, managing to push Marco back a few inches, but knew that they were outclassed. RicJosh swatted futilely at the
<br>
 airborne mouse, causing Marco to move that arm higher and extend it further back and out to the side. 
<br>

<br>
                                                      *THWACK* 
<br>

<br>
 No one really saw it. 
<br>

<br>
 As Marco moved slowly back, his outstretched arm had come just close enough and – with a blur of pink, a forked tongue had sped from Mr.
<br>
 Mendes’ mouth, enveloped the mouse and pulled him into a now-lipless maw. Francisco swallowed his prey before anyone had realized what
<br>
 had happened. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Pro – huh?&quot; Marco said, a dazed look in his eyes. &quot;&iquest;Que pasando? &iquest;Qui&eacute;n estas? 
<br>

<br>
 RicJosh, using both hands, managed to pull Marco’s still-pushing arm away. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Sit down, Marco, mi amigo,&quot; RicJosh began. &quot;It’s a long story, and afterwards we’re pretty sure we can undo everything that has happened,
<br>
 including to us. As for the wiz-, er, mouse, he’s gotta be beyond saving. You wouldn’t be talking to us otherwise.&quot; RicJosh gently reached up
<br>
 and, using both hands, forced Marco down onto the couch. 
<br>

<br>
 Off to the side, a low, contented humming and soft clicking sounds came from Mr. Mendes.</p>
