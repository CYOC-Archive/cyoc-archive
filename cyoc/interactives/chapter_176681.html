<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rose ran her hands up and down Nate’s chest, the light was already coming in through the window. Both of them where basketing in the afterglow of what they had done a lot of over the night. Kelly and Kenny had been 100% right, mer-sex was amazing. It was unlikely anything as a human but it felt so personal like you and the person you were with was all that was in the world. <br />
<br />
“That was the best.” Said Nate as he put his face into Rose’s hair, he was tired but maybe it was this new merman form or the fact that he and Rose had waited so long to make sure that their birth control was working but they had gone so many rounds he had lost count. One thing he had not expected was that subconsciously his tail fins locked on to Rose’s tail holding onto her like another pair of hands while her own fins which were located in a slightly different spot locked on him. It helped explain why merman and mermaids had fins in different spots, to help with the process of mating without legs which can wrap around each other. <br />
<br />
“That was mind blowing.” added Rose as she rested her head on his chest. This was their scheduled day off from all lessons and duties which was part of the reason why Rose had decided that last night would be the night. The other reason was the necklace which rested around her neck, her engagement necklace. The royal jewelers had brought it to her the day before and it was breath taking beautiful. <br />
<br />
“You know…” said Nate “You called me Cain a few times.”<br />
<br />
“I did?” inquired Rose slightly concerned as she tried to remember but lost in the moment, she couldn’t remember calling her future husband by his merman name instead of the name he knew his whole life. <br />
<br />
“It is my name; I will have to get used to it.” Said Nate as ran his hand down Rose’s bare back to her ass, right where her skin turned to red/pink scales. He gave it a playful squeeze and maybe that was enough as Rose rolled onto him and pulled herself up to his face and gave him a deep kiss. That kiss shot energy into both of them as their fins locked again and they began to gently roll around as another mind-blowing sex began. <br />
<br />
In one of the smaller dining rooms in the section of the Summer Palace which was their current home, Mike and Stacy were enjoying a breakfast. Their apartment did not have a dining room being more akin to a hotel room with an attached sitting room, so they ate in the dining room.<br />
<br />
“So Sam, Amanda and Taylor are gone.” said Stacy as she studied a small disk which showed a holographic version of a newspaper. “I wonder when Amara is going to make another trip to the human world to see if anyone else wants to join from our list.”<br />
<br />
“I a day or two.” added Amara as she swam into the room, the staff stiffened a bit and began to rush around as the Princess entered the room. They quickly brought her a meal and she thanked them by name.<br />
<br />
“We can’t just grab a bunch of people suddenly.” Said Amara “For Karen and Kat, they were both near the point you all disappeared from and a heart-stricken mother and someone losing a lover killing themselves in suicide is a story everyone can believe without question.” <br />
<br />
“True.” admitted Mike “Nate will not be happy to see Kat.”<br />
<br />
“Why?” inquired Amara concerned wondering what relationship Kat and her brother had. “Does my brother hate Kat?”<br />
<br />
“Hate is a strong word, Nate well Cain is number 2 in our graduation class for computer science, Kat is number 1.” answered Stacy “The two of them have been rivals since they started going up against each other in class. Kat beats him at every turn, not by much but she always seams to do.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” laughed Amara “You had me worried for a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Princess Amara, we can’t say thank you enough for everything you and your family is doing for us.” Said Mike<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it.” Said Amara, everyone knew that if Nate hadn’t been the missing Crown Prince they wouldn’t be getting this special treatment. They would get help of course, each of them now had money in special accounts given to them by the state to help start their new lives. They where entitled to basic apartments and education in the education center by the island where they transformed. Nate being the crown prince had brought them into the circle of power which was not normal for newly arrived people. They were living in the guest rooms of a palace and where being taught by the best of the best in their fields which was going to open a lot of doors for them. Already Mike’s architecture teacher was showing his work to some of his friends in architecture companies and there was interest in him, no internships/jobs had been offered yet but it was only a matter of time. Stacy was taking to the legal field with same skills she had on land and she had talked with Nate’s Aunt the Prime Minister of the nation and she wouldn’t be surprised if a government job was coming for either her or Sam since both of them were studying to be lawyers. She paused for a moment and looked around, by name Kelly and Kenny would have been down here.<br />
<br />
“Where are the two Ks?” inquired Stacy.<br />
<br />
“Not sure.” Stated Mike “Likely screwing like bunnies.”<br />
<br />
“Bunnies?” inquired Amara confused she had never seen a bunny being a mermaid, Mike explained as Amara chuckled. “If they keep going at it like love fish they may find themselves with a little mermaid or merman soon enough.”<br />
<br />
“Well if that happens it happens.” said Kelly as she entered the room followed moments later by Kenny who looked a little worse for wear. “Birth control is there for a reason, but when it happens it happens.”<br />
<br />
“What happened to you?” inquired Mike as Kenny pointed toward Kelly, with a smile on his face. <br />
<br />
“She made friends with a guard who told us about…” started Kenny as Amara raised her hand. <br />
<br />
“I don’t really want to know what sort of stuff my guards do in their bedrooms just like I don’t need to know what happens in your bedrooms, or my brothers/Rose’s bedroom and you don’t need to know about what happens in mine.” Said Amara<br />
<br />
“Let’s just say I found a new favorite toy.” Said Kelly with a playful grin as Amara groaned. <br />
<br />
“I told you I don’t want to know.” Complained Amara<br />
<br />
“We are only learning about your culture? Our new culture.” countered Kelly with a playful grin <br />
<br />
“And I already know about the culture and judging by how he looks, I can guess what “toy” you used but while we merfolk are far more open than the surface but this is a Palace and I am a Princess.” Stated Amara as her voice turned harder for a moment. “Remember that.”<br />
<br />
“Alright…I am just playing.” stated Kelly defensively as she flicked her new blue hair over her shoulder and did a grin which caused Amara to glare at her for a moment before laughing herself. <br />
<br />
“You remind me of one of my cousins, the one who is always getting into trouble but is the most fun.” admitted Amara.<br />
<br />
It was well past lunch nearing dinner time by the time Karen opened her eyes again, she was still tired as hell, but she was also hungry as hell. She looked around Kat was still out, but the rest of the room was empty. She slowly got out of bed and floated in the water, it was strange as she floated a few inches off the floor, she gave a light kick of her new tail and moved over to a large mirror which was located alongside the wall. She looked at herself in the mirror, her dirty blonde hair still looked the same, her face looked the same to her, her body from the waste up seamed the same as well. But the longer she looked at the mirror the more she noticed minor changes, a few wrinkles where gone and she looked a little younger. Then she stopped and really looked at her face, one of her eyes was shifting colors going from a greenish blue to a golden color. <br />
<br />
“My God.” Said Karen as she watched as her other eye began to change to a dark golden color. She just floated there looking at her eyes before she slowly turned around only to stop as she spotted a few colored scales on her tail. She expected to see yellow scales like her daughters instead she saw a what she best was a mixture of bronze and copper scales with a few golden ones mixed in.<br />
<br />
“Ah…I see your tail is already coming in, right on track.” Said Doctor Manius as he entered the room. <br />
<br />
“This is just strange.” stated Karen<br />
<br />
“I can understand, I was born a merman but I have been helping humans for years and I will be doing so for a long time to come.” Said Doctor Manius “You will have a while to get used to it.”<br />
<br />
“I am just a middle age woman who is starting to wrap her mind around this.” Stated Karen <br />
<br />
“Middle age by human standards, you are 45 or, so right?” inquired Manius as Karen nodded her head. “You have around another 70 years or so at the least likely more the way technology is going.” <br />
<br />
Karen just blinked as she looked at him slightly confused.<br />
<br />
“Merfolk average life span is in the nearly 140 years old, the retired King and Queen that would be Prince Cain’s grandparents are 145 years old and still in good health I have been told.” Said Doctor Manius with a smile. Karen assumed that Prince Cain was Nate, she had meet Nate a few times, he seemed like a good kid and was happy for both Rose and him, however she couldn’t help but think she was less then middle age in this world. “You are still a young mermaid and we age slower than humans, we don’t show our age as much, I would expect by the time you finish become a mermaid you will look more like you did in your mid-30s, hell I am older then you.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t believe you.” stated Karen as her eyes ran up and down Manius, he had to be a few years younger then she was. He had to be maybe early 40s at most likely late 30s. <br />
<br />
“I am 51.” answered Manius “and the way medical technology is advancing I have another 100 years in front of me, just like you do.”<br />
<br />
“100 years.” Said Karen with a shake of her head. “Do you know where my daughter is?”<br />
<br />
“She is in the dinning hall.” answered Amanda as she appeared holding a tray of food. “Sorry both you and Kat where out and we where hungry, Sam and her are still down there talking.”<br />
<br />
“Am I allowed to leave this room?” inquired Karen as she looked at Manius<br />
<br />
“Normally no, but if I escort you down and you and Kat there are special since this is a royal mission, it will be fine.” Said Manius as he opened the door. “So Mrs. Campbell do you want to go for a swim?”<br />
<br />
“Sure.” Said Karen as she tried her best to keep upright only to learn that most merfolks swam horizontally and only went verticals while they were floating in one place. It was a strange thing to get used to. <br />
<br />
While Karen and Doctor Manius headed out the room, Amanda sat down beside Kat who seamed passed out only to have one of her hands shoot out and grab what looked to her to be a French fries off Amanda’s plate. She bit into it only to raise an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Merfolk have potatoes underwater?” inquired Kat<br />
<br />
“It taste like potatoes but it is a type of coral. They have a lot of things which taste like different things on the surface, they have a type of starfish that I swear tastes like chicken.” answered Amanda as she ate a few of her own fries. “You will be disappointed in one thing about being a mermaid?”<br />
<br />
“And what is that?” asked Kat as she sat up in bed, her died silver hair was already going back to it’s natural brown be that part of the change itself or being so long in salt water she wasn’t sure. “Because so far everything you have told me seams amazing, they accept gay and lesbians as equals, no oppressive faith damning people to hell, clean energy, technology which is at least a few decades ahead of us, longer lives and looking damn hotter.”<br />
<br />
She added the last part with a low growl which caused Amanda to blush, Amanda was the more classic women in the relationship, but Kat wasn’t masculine by any means. She was more the classic goth girl, medium size chest, a thin build, a decent ass who wore a lot of black and silver. While Amanda was the more classic homemaker look, but with a chest most women would die for until they had to walk around with it. Apparently being in the water made that a lot easier on the back but Kat couldn’t wait to have some fun with Amanda in the bedroom. Amanda had never slept with a woman until Kat came into her life in college, Amanda never admitted what she really wanted to anyone but Kat saw it right away because her folks where the same way. When she came out she was abounded by her folks and she saw the same fear in Amanda’s eyes when they met. <br />
<br />
“Well, you know your plan of putting a wedding ring on where you have a tattoo.” said Amanda as Kat raised an eyebrow and raised her hand, the dragon tattoo was still there, and it went down to a rainbow flag which went to her ring finger. She had said for a long time she could not wait to have a wedding ring on that finger, well that clearly was not going to happen. She could see that the fingers where already webbed. “Mermaids don’t wear rings. They use necklaces instead.”<br />
<br />
Kat shrugged and put that to the side, it was minor issue and if that was the worse she would gladly take it. <br />
<br />
“I did learn something from the doctors which will take your breath away. They here have found a way for mermaids in same sex couples to have biological kids with each other.” explained Amanda as Kat looked at her in amazement, both of them had talked about wanting kids in the future, but they figured the only way was either a sperm bank or adoption. “From what I understand they take an egg from you and from me and combine the DNA in both of them to form a new egg ready for implantation, then if we want by magic they can randomize the gender which raises the risk of failure or we don’t randomize it and the baby is a mermaid. I figure in a few year what a better middle finger to our religious nuts of parents if they had a biological grandchild from a lesbian marriage.”<br />
<br />
Kat pulled Amanda into a deep kiss, her hands going into Amanda’s dark raven locks and Amanda’s hands pulling her close to her. When they parted they remained forehead to forehead.<br />
<br />
“This place just gets better and better.” Said Kat with wonder in her voice. “We have a few years to decide that I just wonder what color my tail is going to be, I haven’t spotted any changes in that yet. I just pray it isn&#39;t some girly color like pink.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn&#39;t put it out there but what is wrong with pink?&quot; said Amanda with a playful smile. &quot;A pink goth mermaid, sound great to me.&quot;</p>
