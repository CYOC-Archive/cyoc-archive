<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madison couldn&#39;t stop staring at Mr. Cameron, who she now started remembering as Nathaniel Cameron, Nathan for short. Sports star and sexy highschool dreamboat, this boy next door was the entire package. <br />
<br />
Nathan walked over to her, calmly holding her by the arms. &quot;Hey.&quot; He smirked, his face a bit close to hers. At the moment, he was still taller than her, so she had to look up at him. &quot;...H-Hey...&quot; The girl was speechless. She never thought her teacher would be this hot at her age. &quot;You&#39;re staring. You want some of this?&quot; He said softly. The young man gently entwined his hand with hers.<br />
<br />
Pauline just watched with her eyes wide open. &#39;There&#39;s no way she&#39;s going to--&#39; her thoughts were cut off when she saw Madison&#39;s other hand reach up to feel Nathan&#39;s big, strong pectorals, making him let out a soft moan. &quot;Mmm, heheh...I&#39;ll take that as a yes.&quot; With that, the big guy reached his other arm down to her ass, making exaggerated grunts as he showed off his strength by picking her up and carrying her over to the bed. All the while, Madison looked like a blushy mess.<br />
<br />
Pauline just rolled her eyes...but she couldn&#39;t deny Mr. Cameron had become a pretty hot guy. Maybe she should let her friend have this one. She always did fantasize about having her &#39;YA novel&#39; moment. Maybe after this, she could have a turn with him too.<br />
<br />
Nathan gently laid Madison on the bed, the teen climbing onto it with her as the two of them got their clothes off. Though, instead of topping, he wrapped himself around her, encouraging her to climb on top of him. &quot;Imma let you be the rider this time.&quot; Madison just nodded excitedly as she followed his lead, now resting her body on top of his. With their bodies entwined, they cutesy nuzzled each other&#39;s noses, giggling as the blushes on their faces were intense.<br />
<br />
Deep down, they were both nervous, but as they gazed into each other&#39;s eyes, they couldn&#39;t help thinking about how cute the other was. Slowly, their faces drew closer and closer, until their lips met in a kiss.<br />
<br />
During this process, Nathan&#39;s cock had been rock hard, a whole ten inches of throbbing meat right up against the girl&#39;s rear. As they felt each other&#39;s bodies, his hands gliding across her back and her legs, Madison&#39;s feeling up every highly trained muscle from his tight back muscles to his biceps, his ass, and his stomach, he couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore. He needed her right now, and he could tell she needed him too. They broke the kiss, panting heavily as he finally inserted his hard rod gently into her, taking the girl&#39;s virginity. They groaned together in love and affection, the young man noticing Pauline with a phone in her hand, taking pictures. He just smirked. Something inside of him told him he shouldn&#39;t be doing this with her, but he didn&#39;t care in the slightest. His body felt that loving tingle that needed attention. With that, they went back to making out. <br />
<br />
Madison, of course, was living in a dream. No way in hell did she ever think she could land a guy like him, the other guys on the sports teams kind of brush her off a lot, but Nathan felt different. In fact...he actually did feel different. His muscular arms didn&#39;t feel as big and bulky as they were a moment ago. But she just brushed it off, even as she felt his jaw shift as they kissed. &quot;Hmmm...mmmghhh, ungh, damn...you&#39;re so tight in there, Maddie...&quot; Nathan grunted in between breaths and kisses as he sensually grinded and thrusted into her. &quot;Aheheh, well, you are pretty big...&quot; She giggled. &quot;And handsome.&quot; She was smiling like an idiot, just like he was. &quot;Ahahahah, well, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re enjoying yourself. A girl as beautiful as you desErves it.&quot; Neither of them noticed the young man&#39;s voice crack as they continued their sexy time together. <br />
<br />
Pauline, however, wasn&#39;t too engrossed in the action to notice. She put her phone down and took a closer look at him. His face seemed...a bit rounder than before. His body not as big and strong looking. Then it hit her. Wasn&#39;t the patch still on him? Oh no. She needed to do something, quick! &quot;Madison! Madison! Girl, slow down!&quot; She whispered loudly to her. But she ignored her. Madison was too blinded by her horny feelings to notice Nathan&#39;s sexy muscles shrinking in her grasp.<br />
<br />
The now younger man was seventeen, inching his way past his sixteenth birthday. &quot;Unnngh...uhhhHhh...&quot; his thrusting was getting harder, feeling more and more desperate to cum rather than taking in the moment. His body was getting smaller, his legs stretching and feet flexing as he felt a tightness inside of him, his bones cracking and shifting as he grew shorter and younger. &quot;I-I...can&#39;t believe a girl like you would wAnt someone like mE...&quot; Nathan panted, his voice getting higher as his Adam’s Apple began to shrink. &quot;Are you kidding? I&#39;ve always wanted a guy like you!&quot; Madison replied, totally unaware that guy was quickly becoming a kid beneath her.<br />
<br />
Pauline tried everything. Calling out to her, clapping, even straight up waving like she was flagging down a taxi. Nothing worked. Madison continued to rub Nathan&#39;s shrinking body up and down, the two of them moaning into each other as the young man reached her height, his handsome face shifting again and getting cuter as he reached fifteen years old. By now, he wasn&#39;t nearly as strong as he used to be. Though, his sports training had started as early as sixth grade, so he was still pretty muscly. Thick, especially with his baby fat returning to him, but not defined. &quot;Ungh...unnnNnngh, yeah, I feel so gOod, Maddie...&quot; Nathan groaned, his formerly deep masculine voice becoming higher, sounding more like a jockish young boy as he inched closer to the start of highschool at fourteen. &quot;Ugh...keep it up, big boy...we&#39;re almost there...&quot; Madison grunted, not realizing her &#39;big boy&#39; wasn&#39;t so big anymore. In fact, he was her height now and getting even smaller than her. &quot;Uhhhngh...I never thought I&#39;d get to have sex with my babysitter...ungh, fuckin&#39; hot...&quot; The young teen grunted as he recklessly thrusted into her with the uncontrollable horny urge of a boy who had only just started learning to deal with his sexual development, his cock still rock hard, but now only five inches in size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ungh...huh? What are you talking about?&quot; That sentence made Madison be a little more aware, but what really snapped her out of it was Pauline going &quot;Maddie! Maddie! MADDIE!&quot; Maddie moaned out her reply. &quot;Ugh, what?! I&#39;m busy!&quot; She then looked down at the young man she was doing. Well...the REALLY young man. The boy was now a fourteen year old, on his way to becoming thirteen again. His body was much smaller, now just a bit under her height. But despite the immense loss of muscles, Nathan was still pretty strong looking. A flat yet firm stomach, biceps and thighs that still had a bit of meat to them, small lightly defined pecs that could still be felt up, all leading up to a thinner neck that had a very slight lump since his voice had started to drop a year prior, and a cute face that was starting to show the handsome angles he would have as a highschool senior. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?!&quot; Madison needed a moment to process what she&#39;s looking at before realizing she started having sex with Nathan without taking the patch off, so it caused him to keep growing younger as they fucked. Still feeling his cock in her knowing she can&#39;t stop here, she quickly lifted the boy up, the young teen lovingly grabbing onto her and moaning as she grabbed the patch and ripped it off of him. He grunted and gasped as he felt a tingle from the magic stopping, which only caused him to get pushed over the edge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, hnn-NNNNGH!&quot; Gritting his teeth with one big thrust, Nathan arched his back and held onto Madison tightly as he exploded, shooting blast after blast of his adult cum inside of her that had been built up too much for his smaller balls to contain. Maddie couldn&#39;t hold it in either, letting herself release with the not so big boy inside of her.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath and biting his lip, Nathan came down from his high with her. He looked at her nervously, feeling awkward yet incredibly euphoric from having his first time with a girl he admired. &quot;Hah...so...d-did I do a good job?&quot; He blushed, wanting her approval.<br />
<br />
Madison, though flustered and slightly embarrassed, couldn&#39;t help but smile. She looked at the cute boy and could still see the makings of the big, strong guy he&#39;ll become in four years. &quot;...Y-Yeah...yeah, you did great.&quot; She lowered herself a bit and gave him a little kiss on his lips, making his eyes widen, and his face get even redder. He gulped, chuckling as he felt flustered from the affection. In his mind, he was having sex with Maddie since she offered to give him a little lesson on being an adult. It started with a handjob, then escalated into full on sex when they couldn&#39;t control themselves. His body felt her touching his budding muscles and felt too sensitive and aroused to stop himself from pushing her to let him in. And here they are now.<br />
<br />
Now that the patch was off, Nathan wasn&#39;t going to get any younger. But as cute as freshman Nathan was, Maddie wanted hot highschool senior Nathan back. They needed to figure out how to grow him up again. But until then, she was a little too tired to think. So for now, they snuggled together while Pauline got to brainstorming.</p>
