<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The walk was quiet and comforting and not knowing about what had happened elsewhere, Eric and Julie loved every moment as they walked along Moon Lake&#39;s streets. While they had gone over many of them on their first date when Julie had showed him around town and all the high points of interest, Eric was seeing them through new eyes and through a rather singular focus, which happened to be the girl on his arm. Nothing really mattered to him beyond seeing Julie smile, and held her arm in his and had his other free hand softly rubbing the back of Julie&#39;s hand as they walked along. Even the scents of other weres on the street didn&#39;t matter to him, so long as Julie was there.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is nice,&quot; Eric said to her, &quot;it&#39;s a nice day... and I&#39;m with such lovely company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could say the same,&quot; Julie smiled back to him and about the pearl necklace that Eric had given her. It was a surprise and would probably be a bigger surprise for her father when he gets home, but she couldn&#39;t see herself with anyone but Eric Anderson. The two of them might have to wait to get married, but there was no doubt in her mind that marriage and happiness were in the future for both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... YOU are the one that&#39;s lovely,&quot; Eric answered, stopping to brush a strand of blonde hair away from Julie&#39;s eyes, &quot;I&#39;m just the one lucky enough to have caught your attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve more than earned it, my darling,&quot; Julie answered and hopped into Eric&#39;s arms to kiss him, relishing the closeness and the pure love that she swore she could feel radiating off of him, similar to the aura of light that her eyes picked up that had told her when she first saw Eric that he was her one true love.<br />
<br />
Eric eagerly returned the kiss and wrapped his arms around her. She felt warm and soft and he found it very easy to not only hold her but to be tender and gentle. Her bright blue eyes, that his eyes had changed to match, practically shined on their own and made her beautiful, and that made him happy and eager to spend the rest of his life with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks to you showing what all there is to love about Moon Lake,&quot; Eric smiled after they came up for air after the kiss, &quot;allowed me to be willing to go out there and truly become part of the town.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie playfully &quot;bopped&quot; his head with one hand, &quot;You&#39;d be part of the town even if you stayed a Normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them slowly resumed their walk and with their eyes often turning to each other as they walked along. They eventually came by the school and Eric did glance to it, though he could see anything beyond the exterior of the building as there was no school in session on a Sunday.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how things will go tomorrow,&quot; Eric commented off hand after a moment, &quot;with regard to... well... everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure everything will go great,&quot; Julie smiled to him, &quot;practically everyone knows we&#39;ve been dating and will see that we&#39;re happy together. They&#39;ll give you a big congratulations and will wish us both well. That will be great, just as Lee and Violet gave you their congratulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric thought for a moment and then nodded. Running into the two weretigers had gone fairly well, and Eric felt a great deal of pride in saying that he became a were for love. He had become a were for love, and he felt no shame in that. Not knowing precisely what love was didn&#39;t matter. All that mattered was knowing that he was in love and that he was happy. He also remembered Nate saying something about people congratulating him about becoming a werewolf, maybe even to the point where Nate thought it was too much. Julie&#39;s words gave him a bit of confidence in that regard.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re probably right,&quot; Eric commented with a smile, &quot;Yvette Smith&#39;s antics aside... everyone in Moon Lake has been so good to our family...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two began to head back toward where their families lived and Eric looked to Julie as he continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ve been especially good to me,&quot; Eric smiled, &quot;and it has me anxious to see every new day with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie smiled and they walked on. As they did so, the sun began to slowly descend over the western horizon. It soon generated a pinkish purple glow that spread across the sky as they walked. Eric noticed it and felt that things were fairly beautiful with it, it seemed to make Julie&#39;s blue eyes twinkle even more, not knowing that Julie felt the same about his own eyes. The two of them made their way back to the Stovall house without incident. They found Eric&#39;s bags where he had left them near the front door and just inside it before they left shortly after brunch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a great time,&quot; Eric said to Julie as they stood just inside the door and he pulled her to him, &quot;Thank you, for loving me... for letting me be your weremer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for becoming my weremer and thank you for loving me as well,&quot; Julie replied, &quot;and we&#39;ll both have a lot to look forward to many happy years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded and looked deeply into Julie&#39;s twinkling eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so, my Jewel,&quot; Eric smiled to her and both again kissed and held each other close. After a few moments, they finally pulled apart slightly, with their arms resting around each other&#39;s waists. &quot;I never want this moment to end...&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie nodded. She didn&#39;t want it to end either. She&#39;d had plenty of friends growing up in Moon Lake, most were girls and had had their first transformations. They enjoyed a lot about being weres and the fun that had come with it and often urged Julie to go over what she had promised her parents, but she always insisted to remain true to her promise that she would only enjoy more adult fun if she found her one true love. Then one day, she saw a young brown haired boy in school and was fairly quiet as he walked, but he glowed and was a sign to her that he was one true love, and that made her very happy. She learned he was named Eric and was new to Moon Lake and the two of them began to fall deeply in love, which made her even happier. She didn&#39;t want the moment to end either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither do I,&quot; Julie smiled and then sighed, &quot;but... we may have to. We have school tomorrow and I&#39;m sure your folks will want you home for dinner tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded. He had pretty much promised to be back home for Sunday dinner. He could feel the pull of a were&#39;s libido as he looked to Julie with the idea of enjoying a warm evening with Julie but he retained control over himself. He had his responsibilities to honor and the word he had given his parents. He also internally rationalized the fact that four years wouldn&#39;t last too long. Soon, he and Julie would both be eighteen and would be in college. He&#39;d ask his father if there was any way that he and Julie could get a dorm together on campus, sort of like a place for married or engaged couples, though that might also mean explaining what the pearl necklace he&#39;d given Julie meant in weremer society, but if it worked, they&#39;d be together and could continue to move forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;They probably will,&quot; Eric nodded with a sigh, &quot;want to Skype or go instant message before bed tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Julie smiled, &quot;Might allow me to update you on what plans that will come when dad comes home and learns about our engagement.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Eric feel a bit nervous, as while Martin Stovall probably understood what Julie felt and could understand their happiness, he was still Julie&#39;s father. He was sure to be protective and he was afraid that Martin wouldn&#39;t respond well to the fact that he had not only had sex with Julie but had effectively proposed to Julie at the age of fourteen. Julie managed a bit of a giggle as she noted the nervous look on Eric&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Julie assured him, &quot;so long as I&#39;m on my pill and you remain respectful... IE remaining yourself you&#39;ll be fine. In fact, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be very eager to see what you look like in your were form. You&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you&#39;re by my side, my Jewel,&quot; Eric answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Julie smiled, &quot;I will be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that they broke apart as Eric collected his bags and prepared to head out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see you online tonight,&quot; Eric said to her, &quot;and in person at school tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie nodded with a smile as Eric departed.</p>
