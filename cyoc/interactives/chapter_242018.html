<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Barbara sleeps through the night, she forms a vivid realistic dream. It was an average work morning for her, waking up to her alarm at four-thirty. She starts getting ready to work, putting on her work clothes, and getting some nutrition in her system. As she grabs her purse with her necessaries and her keys to lock the door back, Barbara starts walking down the stairs to the first floor of the building, but as she closes the building door behind her, she gets startled by a loud voice which screams, &quot;FREAK!&quot; Looking back, Barbara sees a lot of people, some strangers, some she knew in the past, and even some close ones, but all of them had one thing in common, shotguns in hand. &quot;Barbara Seids,&quot; she hears her father cry out, &quot;as a freak of nature, we cannot let you live anymore!&quot; &quot;Wait, what? I&#39;m like you guys!&quot; Barbara cries back with fear. &quot;No you aren&#39;t,&quot; Martin responded, &quot;look at your left hand.&quot; Barbara looked down to realize her balloon end was still there. &quot;I&#39;m still one of you guys, this was just from some incident we all experienced.&quot; A second of silence flew by, before one of the strangers in the back yelled back, &quot;No you are not! You are but a freak of nature, and none of us are like you balloon girl!&quot; Starting to hear some guns being loaded and saw the people aiming them at her, Barbara felt fear and started to feel her left palm taking in more air, which gave her the only idea she could have. As fast as she could, Barbara put her left palm up to her mouth, and with a single blow, her skin and body stretched out as big as five times her own body. Then she quickly tied her balloon end, making her stay in this stretched-out form. She hears the guns fire, all coming at her standing direction.<br />
<br />
As she sees the bullets touch her skin, Barbara wakes up, heavily breathing from that nightmare. Looking around her surroundings, Barbara gets brought back to reality, realizing it was all just some bad dream her brain was playing on her. Turning over to her nightstand with her phone, Barbara takes it out and realizes it is about ten-thirty in the morning. Taking a huge sigh of relief, Barbara gets out of her bed and puts back on her silk robe which was on the floor. Walking out into the kitchen, Barbara goes over to her cabinets, and eats a breakfast bar for her morning, slowly getting up for the day. As she finishes her bar, Barbara looks down at her hand, reminding her of her dream. Taking a sigh, Barbara knew what she was going to do next. Walking over to her closet, Barbara looks through the things inside and finds the helium tanks in the far back. She tried to pick the one she used for a party before, but the weight of it took her aback, having her carry it with some more strength. After a minor adjustment of her strength, Barbara finally got the tank on her kitchen table.<br />
<br />
Taking a breath of relief, Barbara is about ready to fully try out her new form. But there was still one major step she hadn&#39;t done in reality yet. She needs to tie her balloon lip. Barbara still needed a way to untie her lip, so she decided to look up some ideas on her phone. After a bit of research, Barbara learns that a chopstick under the knot will slip out the knot entirely and she does have a wooden pair left from some takeout. After grabbing the pair and snapping them into separate chopsticks, Barbara was ready for her first major step. Stretching out the balloon end, Barbara gets her right hand to make a knot and finally ties up her balloon lip. As she lets it go and it retracts back, Barbara now feels in a good constant state with the air in her body, but she grabs the balloon tie back, using her mouth to hold it at, and uses the chopsticks on her right hand to insert it under the tie, making space for the lip to release air and reverting the tie, retracting back untied. Now knowing that she can untie herself whenever she needs to, Barbara now goes towards the helium tank, turns it a few times, and inserts her balloon lip through the nozzle, making sure it is securely in.<br />
<br />
Making sure of her mental preparation, Barbara makes the move, and using her right hand to hold tight, tilts the nozzle upward for the helium to go through her. Getting that same feeling of comfort from before, along with some cooling breeze, Barbara starts to feel and eventually sees the air protruding from her body, mainly her belly. She started to float up in the air, making her un-tilt the nozzle, putting Barbara in a constant state in the air. Using her strength from her right hand, she grabs the lip and lets the lip off the nozzle, stretching it a little to do a single-hand tie. After tying her left palm once more, Barbara is now in the air, floating up with a big belly making her in a supine position. Realizing how much weaker the belt for the robe has become, Barbara unties it and tightens the robe against her belly, making the air immediately go through her chest and thighs and changing her position to an upright, levitating stance. Barbara immediately felt her once comfortable boyshorts into full on briefs. She tried looking down at her legs, but she can only see her now enlarged chest. Barbara wanted to see what her body looked like now. She started to have problems reaching down to the table, floating nearly up to the ceiling. It took some tries, and some pressure on her arm and hands reaching down, but she eventually grabbed her phone and took some pictures of her new floaty state. Looking at the images, Barbara completely thought her body was nearly sex-doll-like in body proportion and knew who to send these pics to. Sending them straight away, she sees that Martin immediately asks for a video call, which she agrees to.<br />
<br />
Getting into a video call with her boyfriend, which she hasn&#39;t seen since the Great Fusion Wave, and seeing her boyfriend look the same as before made Barbara smile with comfort, while Martin could only look at her with a lot of lust, making such comments to her as, &quot;Damn Barbs you look like a sex doll,&quot; &quot;You would be the perfect cartoon in real life,&quot; and &quot;Barbara, I wanna know how you feel now.&quot; Barbara was having fun with it, feeling the dreams from her youth coming through Martin&#39;s comments, and did a couple of lusty poses for him, even flashing him once which made him lose himself. In between the lust, however, the two have a good time talking to each other about their time being stuck alone. Barbara had a good reason to love that man, other than his actual good pay, and Martin is still in love with Barbara&#39;s personality. She told him about her terrible dream, and Martin was reconfirming his love for her, never wanting to point a shotgun or even shoot her at all. Other than that, the two didn&#39;t have much to talk about, but they still enjoyed each other&#39;s company.<br />
<br />
So after their nice call, Barbara just wanted to enjoy her floaty state. She tried to move her legs around, but she barely made any movement towards the living room side. Barbara tried to do a swimming motion, which made her better progress. Eventually reaching near the couch and coffee table, and throwing her phone on the couch, she went down once more over the coffee table and tried to challenge her height in the air to grab the television remote. After some more hard attempts, Barbara finally gets a grab on the remote, and plays a drama she was watching on and off these past few months. Throwing the remote at the couch, Barbara decides to untighten the robe, but she is still in her levitating pose. She tries to push down on her breasts, in which it did go back down to her belly, like the center of her airflow, and it made Barbara float a little weird, at a forty-five-degree angle in between her belly and butt. After some squeezing of her thighs and butt, she also got their air into her belly making her back in a full-laying position again. The robes would gracefully slip off her low-hanging arms, revealing her bare breasts, but Barbara could only enjoy her afternoon by watching her show.</p>
