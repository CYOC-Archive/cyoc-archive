<br />
Max was glad that ultimately he didn&#39;t throw up - and instead, apparently, it was just the feeling of the Muscle Tech-X working its way into his body. He&#39;d woken up the next morning to a whole new him. His tan looked excellent, he looked if anything slightly taller, and he&#39;d put on something like 30 lbs of muscle over night. His gut had formed into a nicely cut six pack while pressing out a bit. He recognized it as a sort of &quot;muscle gut&quot;. The drug it seemed had not compromised his body type while also making improvements on it. His arms...oh fuck, his arms. With them and his newly brawny shoulders, it had been a struggle getting a short sleeved shirt on. He ultimately resorted to wearing a thin material white tank top that clinged to him in ways it never had before.<br />
<br />
He also found himself having to wear a larger pair of shorts than before due to the tone and size on display in his quads and thighs, and even his calves looked more cut, like diamonds. Muscle...he&#39;d really put on quite a lot of muscle. He remembered Liam bragging to him about getting some of his own, even paying a deal more to get next day delivery. Liam intended to use two whole dosages of the Muscle Tech-X - even if it made him as uncomfortable as it made Max the prior night, it ultimately turned Max into the hulking example of masculinity he currently was.<br />
<br />
But when Max went to football practice after school that day, he found himself not exactly the only one who had indulged in the drink. It seemed given that a former football player had taken it to great effect, others were as well. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t really blame them given how fucking awesome it felt. Max felt like a fucking god the whole day he was at school. The ladies just could not get enough of the new and improved Max Bronson.<br />
<br />
He wanted to give them a taste of his dick, to really test out his sexy new body, but he had a pretty intensive schedule, and he didn&#39;t want to get behind on his classes. So he decided when school wasn&#39;t so intensive he was going to see about going out with some of the women who piqued his fancy. Like Bess Kincaid and her tits, ohh fuck her tits, yeah...yeah fuck her tits! He&#39;d fuck her tits, heh.<br />
<br />
As Max looked around in the locker room, contented in his fantasy for now, he saw some of the other jocks had taken to it almost as well. Some of them even better;<br />
<br />
Dillon McKale had been one of the more tubby offensive linemen, and even though Dillon had been rather weighty, it was always rather astonishing how fast the guy could move when he was out on the field. But now? Dillon was a different kind of heavy. His gut was still rather large, but it was more tight and strong rather than obese looking. And every other muscle on him looked huge, jacked, and toned. His face had gone from jowls and acne to angular, handsome and astonishingly good looking. His stringy and rather oily blond hair had become longer, wavier and more even. Easily the most impressive muscle on Dillon was his pecs, which almost seemed too big! Max kind of wondered how many doses Dillon had so far.<br />
<br />
Caleb Holbrook the preppy had gone from the pretty boy fullback to the jacked pretty boy fullback. Caleb looked amazing, and part of that could go to how much money the rich boy was willing to spend on his appearance. His body had gone from slender and rather toned to much more muscular and toned. His chest wasn&#39;t as huge as Dillon&#39;s, but his legs looked fucking insane. Caleb had muscles in his legs so huge, Max figured he might need specialized gear just to handle his leg size. Caleb definitely noticed - while he was changing clothes for the day he was flexing his quads for the mirror across from him, grinning at how good his legs looked. Though admittedly, Caleb&#39;s face almost looked too femininely pretty...<br />
<br />
Jose Sanchez had been pretty muscular already, but the addition of Muscle Tech-X had pushed him from simply lean, boyishly good looking and muscular to almost devastatingly handsome and smouldering. However, Jose had been previously one of the more hairy guys on the team. He was actually somewhat shy about his chest due to that. But now? Now Jose looked smooth. Not a whit of hair on his chest, arms or even legs - only a little teasing bit right before his groin. He seemed to be inspecting his body - almost worried, but distracted by how good he looked and felt.<br />
<br />
Even Coach Daniel Bradshaw had apparently gone on it. His body had been more like that of a former jock, heavy and strong but fat and rather out of shape by comparison. His black hair had been thinning and he&#39;d taken to shaving it down to a buzzcut. But now? Now Coach Bradshaw had gotten a nice tan out of it, his muscles looked solid, stronger, and more toned, and Max swore he could see the impression of abs through coach&#39;s polo shirt, which seemed stretched tight. But Coach usually had some stubble or even a light beard - today he looked like the kind of guy who never needed to shave!<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright folks, let&#39;s get our drills started,&quot; Coach said as he entered, seeming to look at everyone who had gone on the Muscle Tech-X first to check something. &quot;Max, Dillon, Caleb, Jose, I&#39;ve got a special workout planned for you guys today, taking into account all the work you&#39;ve been doing lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
He winked, and Max wondered if it was really that obvious. <br />
<br />
As the rest of the team ran off, some of them deciding then and there to start on Muscle Tech-X themselves to get in on the specialized workout, Coach regarded them, &quot;You boys, go right on ahead into the weight room. I&#39;ve got your circuits ready and selected your workout partners for the day. Don&#39;t want anybody overstraining their bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
He handed out some pieces of paper with a rather long and intensive workout listed on there, along with who Max was going to be working out with that day...</p>
