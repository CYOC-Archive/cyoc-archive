<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eileen dressed herself, returned to normal, and admired the brilliant cleaning job her robot form had done. The house was immaculate.<br />
<br />
Now dressed and ready, she awaited her husband Eric. And revenge.<br />
<br />
About a half hour later, Eileen stood by the door as it clicked and unlocked. A disheveled middle aged man in his late forties entered clumsily and closed the door behind him.<br />
<br />
Eric Paulson undid jacket and looked around in amazement. &quot;Holy shit, you cleaned up today, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; Eileen said pointedly, and took her husband&#39;s coat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, anyway, girls are gone?&quot; Eric kicked off his shoes, heading for the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just you and me, darling.&quot; Eileen said venomously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I picked up some shit to fix the furnace. Gonna have to call Henry tomorrow.&quot; The middle aged man had no idea doom was about to fall on him. He was making a sandwich.<br />
<br />
Eileen waltzed up beside her husband of 23 years, placed a hand on his shoulder, and smirked. &quot;I&#39;ve known about you and Emily for two years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric dropped the knife he was holding and began to tremble, his colour draining to ash. &quot;I-I...&quot; He gulped. &quot;I can explain!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need.&quot; Eileen said simply. &quot;You&#39;re a snake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no.&quot; Eric gulped, scratching at his suddenly itchy neck. &quot;I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, honey.&quot; She said sweetly. &quot;You don&#39;t understand. You&#39;re a snake now.&quot;<br />
<br />
To Eric&#39;s surprise and confusion, his accusing wife reached around him seductively and pulled him close to her, placing an enamouring kiss on his lips. He felt wam. Itchy. Tingly. Scared.<br />
<br />
She stuck her tongue in his mouth passionately, and he moaned and felt arousal flooding other weird sensations away. She hadn&#39;t done this for years! It felt really great, and Eric lost himself to pleasure as his wife cupped his groin in her hand. Her face contorted into shock and then amusement suddenly, and he looked on in sudden alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; He said, missing his slimmer tongue flicking out almost absentmindedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t feel that?&quot; She said with a maddening smirk. &quot;Come on, baby, let&#39;s get these clothes off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eileen took her bewildered husband&#39;s hand, and led him to the bedroom playfully. He noticed his pant legs dragging on the ground and scrunched his face in uncomprehending confusion as they reached the bed.<br />
<br />
Eileen stood with her hands on his shoulders. Why did she seem so tall all of a sudden?!<br />
<br />
Eric gulped as his wife tenderly kissed his neck and helped lift him to sit on top of the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, honey, don&#39;t freak out, okay?&quot; She winked.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-w... Okay?!&quot; Eric said in bewilderment. Eileen pushed him back onto the bed and quickly grabbed his pants, ripping them away down his waist with no effort and tossing them to the floor.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s face turned to horror as he saw it first. The jutting red cocks. As in more than one. Surrounded by olive plates and green tropical scales all the way down his waist to his feet. The way he was sitting, he watched a long serpentine tail growing from under his scaly green balls, slowly lengthening as he watched in pure distilled freaked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God!&quot; He finally yelled, finding that yes, those were his two throbbing members, and yes, those were really his legs. &quot;W-wha-what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a snake, honey.&quot; She said in a creepily reassuring voice. &quot;I&#39;m just helping you become what you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric watched for a few minutes more and began shaking as he watched the same pattern overtake his hands and realized he was slowly but surely shrinking before his wife as his shirt grew baggy around his diminishing form.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, baby!&quot; Eric said, tearing up as the scales reached his neck and began to climb upward. &quot;Please! Please make it stop! I know you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh.&quot; Eileen said, putting a finger to his lips as they hardened to snake scales. &quot;It won&#39;t be forever.&quot; She joined him on the bed, watching was fascination as his tail grew longer and thicker while his feet were beginning to shrink much faster than the rest of him. He looked at her helplessly, in terror, and she kissed him again, her hand finding his twin man hoods and squeezing them together, making him hiss in her mouth. As he shrank, he also grew more serpentine, and as Eileen caressed and cuddled her changing husband snake his hands and feet had reduced to shapeless stumps on the end of disproportioned and tiny limbs.<br />
<br />
Breathing helplessly, watching his transformation advance helplessly and in total terror,  Eric watched as Eileen removed his shirt and pulled it off two tiny shrinking arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a handsome serpent.&quot; Eileen said sweetly, and kissed him more as his entirely reptilian face began to push out into a snake snout. He was now so much smaller she couldn&#39;t even stick her tongue in his mouth, and he began flicking out his own tongue to taste the air, like the snake he was becoming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor thing.&quot; She said mockingly. &quot;Look at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric hissed in startled alarm as his wife pulled him up on top of her lap, and he realized his arms and legs had been reduced to tiny nubs on his rapidly dehumanizing torso. His neck was lengthening now, thickening, and his tail was long enough to slither at Eileen&#39;s feet even as he continued to shrink relentlessly.<br />
<br />
He hissed in pleasured delight as his wife now took both his much smaller manhoods in each hand and began jerking them. He bucked his snake tail and began to coil around her body for warmth as he lost humanity, grew longer, and shrank still smaller.<br />
<br />
Eileen smiled warmly in arousal as he husband shrank against her, besides a few vestiges of human shape, more or less a serpent. She smiled as he hissed and bucked into her hand. Her mere fingertips were enough to jerk the whole length of his cocks now, and he coiled his length around her arm lovingly as he felt climax approaching.<br />
<br />
The left cock released first, spilling forth a creamy white liquid across her hand, and the second was not long either, releasing against her arm. Eileen grinned wider, watching the little green snake hissing and writhing in orgasm as he shrank down to his final size, coiled around her arm as he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, my snake.&quot; Eileen smiled, hopelessly turned on. The serpent flicked his tongue anxiously and she watched his expressionless reptile eyes dart over his body and finally locking on her gaze. The snake hissed, realized it could no longer speak, and constricted tighter around her arm in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry.&quot; She said, carefully gripping his neck in between her fingers and pulling his glassy body away from her arm. &quot;The girls will love their new pet.&quot;</p>
