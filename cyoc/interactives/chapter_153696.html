<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Feeling his stomach growling, Freddy ran downstairs to see a plate of breakfast at the table waiting for him along with his parents sitting in chairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Freddy dear, would you mind sitting down?&quot; his mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure&quot; Freddie replied as he sat and began to dig in, appreciative of finally being able to eat human food again.<br />
<br />
Freddy&#39;s mother coughed before she began. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother and his classmates had to come home early from their school trip. Apparently, there was an issue with the hotel they were staying at and they couldn&#39;t get another one booked for that many people in time. Your father and I are going to go over to his school to pick up Josh in a little bit. Will you be Ok being home alone for about twenty to thirty minutes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t one of you stay behind?&quot; Freddy asked nervously as he finished his meal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Josh is very upset about it&quot; his father answered &quot;and I think it would be best if the both of us went.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t be long&quot; his mother added. &quot;Just for a short period of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, can&#39;t I join you?&quot; Freddy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it would be best if it was just your mother and I&quot; his father answered. <br />
<br />
Feeling a sense of nervousness, Freddy sighed and reluctantly agreed as his parents got up to get ready to go. Sitting over his finished breakfast, Freddy already had a sense of dread over what could happen while they were away. He had just gotten it on with the neighbors dog, something he never thought he&#39;d do. Even though he loved Michael, it seemed that his canine instincts were overtaking his rational mind. If he wasn&#39;t careful, Ellie could trigger yet another transformation. As he got up to put his dishes and silverware in the kitchen sink, his parents came in from behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember to grab the collar from the carport in case you start turning back into a dog again&quot; his father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t be long&quot; his mother added. <br />
<br />
His parents made their way out the door as Freddy took a moment to compose himself. It wouldn&#39;t be that long, right? It was only twenty to thirty minutes. He could preoccupy himself while he waited for them to come home. Freddy started to make his way upstairs before remembering. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have to get the dog collar&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;I have to be careful that Ellie doesn&#39;t come under the fence again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly, Freddy made his way  back downstairs to the back door and opened it to head outside, leaving the door slightly ajar behind him. Freddy looked around the yard and saw no sign of Ellie. Relieved, he made his way over to the carport. He managed to grab the collar from the shelf and was about to turn to head back into the house when Freddy heard an excited yip below him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ellie!&quot; Freddy screamed as he jumped back, startled. <br />
<br />
Ellie began to nuzzle at his leg as Freddy began to panic and make his way back into the house. Before he was able to reach the door, he was knocked over by Ellie who made her way to his crotch and began to lick it. Freddy froze in fear as he felt his penis began to change into the sheath of a dog again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; Freddy said out loud as his tried to free himself from being pinned under Ellie&#39;s weight. <br />
<br />
Freddy managed to maneuver himself off of Ellie before running into the house and shutting the door behind him. Ellie pawed at the door and barked wildly as Freddy began to take off his clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! Shit! Shit!&quot; Freddy exclaimed as he removed his shirt and pulled off his pants and underwear. He found that his body was already covered in black and brown fur with creamy white fur on his stomach. His legs were already beginning to reform into the hind legs of a dog with his feet turning into paws. Not long now before he resumed his four legged position. <br />
<br />
&quot;I haaavee to geett thiiiiss colllarr onnn&quot; Freddy said as he speech began to slur into a series of growls. <br />
<br />
Freddy began to feel his snout make its return and his ears crawling up the top of his head. He began to feel his hands go numb as he took the collar and proceeded to place it around his neck. He managed to lace it and secure it in place before his hands completely turned into paws. Freddy lost balance and fell onto his front and back legs as his body reshaped to fit into a four legged stance. His tail reemerged and soon he resumed the stance of a full grown, adult German Shepherd male. <br />
<br />
Upon finishing his transformation, Freddy felt his tongue emerge from his snout and he began to pant in fear. His sensitive ears picked up the sounds of foot steps as Ellie&#39;s barking continued during the transformation. Freddy heard his neighbor coming into his yard as he began yelling at Ellie from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad dog! Bad girl! What did I tell you about staying on your side of the fence?! Get back here now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Freddy could hear Ellie&#39;s whimpering as she was dragged back into her yard. Freddy&#39;s neighbor opened and closed the gate separating their properties and then proceeded to drag her back inside of the house. This left Freddy stuck in his dog form as he no longer had an outlet to release his seed in order to change back. Upon looking down, Freddy noticed his red penis sticking out of his sheath. He tentatively reached down with his snout and began to lick it hoping to self pleasure himself into orgasm. He barely made headway when he heard the sound of the front door knob turning. Panicked, Freddy shuffled his clothes under the couch with his snout and ran to hide behind it before he heard the door opening. He peered over the couch and looked out to see....</p>
