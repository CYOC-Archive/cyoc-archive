<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alpha woke up a few hours later, feeling oddly groggy.<br />
<br />
He sat up with a gasp, remembering the fight he’d had with Sam and Bubba. The muscle bear checked himself for any changes and sighed in relief when he found none. He was still sitting in his car and his neck had a kink in it from sleeping in such an awkward position. <br />
<br />
“He is awake, Buck.” Bubba’s voice came from his window.<br />
<br />
Alpha turned and saw a fat anthro raccoon staring down at him. His eyes were glazed, likely from the control spell. He looked around and saw Sam, also an anthro raccoon, staring at Buck. The tubby trucker cub was yawning and waddling over to Alpha.<br />
<br />
“You okay, Dustin?”<br />
<br />
Alpha blinked, wondering why his cub was calling him by his real name…then remembered he’d been transformed. It was all so confusing, his mind was such a jumble of realities…<br />
<br />
“Yeah, just confused, Buck.” Alpha sighed. “We win?”<br />
<br />
“Yup.” Buck smiled and held up the Book of Living Forms.<br />
<br />
Dustin took it from him and Buck blushed and looked away. He was surprised at how quickly their implanted personalities resurfaced when they no longer held the Book. This could make any further reality changes a bitch to deal with.<br />
<br />
“How did they get us?” Dustin asked Buck.<br />
<br />
“Their body odor. They created a special…pheromone cocktail that passively transformed anyone who smelled the special musk into their desire.” Buck replied. <br />
<br />
“How?” Dustin asked sharply, thinking back to the jockstrap.<br />
<br />
“Merged the Book with themselves. Eu De Trucker.” Buck smirked.<br />
<br />
“So…how did they manage to get controlled?” Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
“Merging with the Book makes it undetectable, but it also lessens the protections it gives you from other Book users.” Buck shrugged. “It takes time to unmerge and this whole incident was completely coincidental. Caught ‘em with their pants down, so to speak.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Dustin bit his lip and stared off into the distance. “We got ourselves a problem. We can’t leave them anthros, obviously.”<br />
<br />
“But then the Control spell won’t work on them anymore!” Buck protested. “I say we turn the whole place into a fucking zoo!”<br />
<br />
“Right. Very cool, Troy.” Dustin rolled his eyes. “And then who chops our fucking cars?”<br />
<br />
“Oh. Fuck!”<br />
<br />
“Right. That’s the problem.” Dustin mused. “We need them to chop our cars, but that can’t happen if they are anthros or ferals.”<br />
<br />
“Reality shift?” Buck asked.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck might happen if we do that?” Dustin asked. “I mean, anthros don’t exist. One existing is a wrinkle in reality. We’d have to turn the whole garage into a bunch of anthros.”<br />
<br />
“There’s, like, twenty people here.” Buck scratched his beard. “Plus two dogs and some rats.”<br />
<br />
“We avoided reality shifts since we started. Clint changed the world slightly, man. Twenty three people transforming at once?” Dustin shuddered. “I don’t like it, man. We could get caught in it.”<br />
<br />
“No, you did a mass half before.” Buck replied. “We just designate the garage area, have you and Bubba and Sam plug your ears, and…well, send Bubba and Sam in first so they get their new forms sealed in. Then we have a garage full of anthro mechanics and truckers.”<br />
<br />
Dustin sighed. He still didn’t like it. Too many variables, too much could go wrong. It required finesse and Troy barely had that. He might have done it himself….but if he did it and didn’t have enough energy…Dustin shuddered at the thought.<br />
<br />
“You have to do it. You’ll need to focus.” Dustin handed the Book back over.<br />
<br />
“Thanks. Wow, the mental shifts get kinda…” Troy stifled a burp, “Fucking nauseating.”<br />
<br />
“Man up.” Alpha ordered.<br />
<br />
“Tch. Alright, I command everyone to the center of the lot.” Troy gestured.<br />
<br />
Alpha got out of the car and wobbled his way to the center of the lot, discretely holding onto Troy’s shoulder. He was still woozy from all the energy those spells had sucked out of him. Actually, he wondered if it could kill him if he wasn’t careful. Probably.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Sam and Bubba, stand five feet in front of us and plug your ears.” Troy pointed.<br />
<br />
Sam and Bubba walked in front of the garage. Behind them, far into the garage, a group of dogs were having a suck and fuck fest. Troy frowned. He hadn’t ordered them to do that. What the fuck had Bubba and Sam done to them? If they were this horny, how the hell did they get any repairs done?<br />
<br />
“Ready?” Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
Troy nodded.<br />
<br />
“Focus. Anthros. Keep it together, deep breath, then whisper it.”<br />
<br />
“Plug your ears.” Troy said.<br />
<br />
Dustin sighed and did as Troy asked, then turned away.<br />
<br />
“Mass Half.” Troy whispered, concentrating on the area in front of him and the garage and parking area in the back, where some guys were likely smoking and fucking.<br />
<br />
As the words left his mouth, he saw more workers coming around the corner of the garage and concentrated, attempting to further expand the spell. He didn’t want to cast it twice. Twenty something people was a big spell, but Troy had built up so much tolerance to the energy draining effect…it should just be, like, the energy equivalent of fifteen Shapes, right? <br />
<br />
The four workers who had just exited the back of the shop, likely on their way home, began to shift. Troy had decided to just turn the entire shop into anthro raccoons, as that was easier to envision. It also meant no real magic would be needed to shift Sam and Bubba, as they were already anthro raccoons.<br />
<br />
As the four men finished shifting into anthro raccoons, Troy was giddy. It had worked! They hadn’t even noticed the changes, just kept talking amongst themselves and smoking. <br />
<br />
Troy wobbled, more energy siphoning out of him to the other workers in the garage. As they began closing up shop for the day and drifting out into the parking lot, Troy began to feel his handle on the spell begin to slip.<br />
<br />
“D-Dustin!” Troy gasped as he felt the spell almost…wobble.<br />
<br />
A memory came to him, the one where he was so angry, he wanted to turn the whole lot into a zoo. He felt the spell wobble lazily and latch onto that instead. Troy grit his teeth and tried shoving it back into anthro raccoons, but his focus was slipping along with his energy.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?” Alpha asked, coming to Troy’s side.<br />
<br />
The worker’s forms wavered and shifted again, some falling to all fours as various zoo animals. They seemed to become pairs, two the workers shifting into gorillas, cigarettes shifting into bananas. The other two settled and stretched on all fours as gold fur enveloped them and they became lions. One of them didn’t have a mane, however.<br />
<br />
“I think the spells gone wrong!” Troy latched onto Dustin’s arm. “Help!”<br />
<br />
All the other workers were shifting into more exotic breeds, all feral. Two men became zebras, falling to the ground with a bray. The lot around them became a grassy plain. Troy couldn’t concentrate on that, though, because the workers next to them became seals and the ground beneath them sunk into a watery depression, where they began to swim around. Bird cries and animal roars filled the air. The entire garage was shifting and transforming into caves and iron-barred exhibits.<br />
<br />
“You gotta focus, Troy!” Alpha yelled in Troy’s ear. “Anthro mechanics!”<br />
<br />
Bubba and Sam suddenly wobbled and fell onto all fours. Their clothes vanished and Troy watched in horror as their bodies warped and twisted. Bubba swelled, muscle and fat piling onto him, fur growing shaggy and brown. His head cracked and reshaped into a grizzly bear’s visage. Sam’s body twisted, muscles growing lean and limber. His head shifted into a lupine shape, and soon a gray furred wolf stood there. The wolf gave a yelp as his cock and balls suddenly pulled back into his body, and when the wolf turned to sniff himself, Troy saw a very feminine spade right under the female wolf’s anus.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit!” Dustin tried backing away, I think I can see it moving towards us!” <br />
<br />
Troy saw it as well, and when he shifted his gaze from the animalistic tableau before him to Dustin as he turned to run, the shimmer of reality followed his line of sight and struck the muscle bear. More energy surged from him, and he watched as Dustin twisted and shifted, fur sprouting, his form growing wolf-like.<br />
<br />
Soon, only a wolf stood where Dustin had been, panting slightly. Then he lifted his nose to the air, scenting something. Troy watched him trot back towards Sam. He gave the female wolf a lick on her hindquarters, then mounted her. Troy gasped in horror as he realized what was happening.<br />
<br />
The entire lot was turning into a zoo. And not just any zoo, one which practiced captive breeding. The Book of Body could change genders, it was lending its power to the reality shift, making it all come together.<br />
<br />
And try as Troy might, there didn’t seem to be anything he could do.<br />
<br />
The spell continued, gravel driveway becoming a path through what was clearly a giant zoo with enclosures and a gift shop. Troy kept his focus on the scene in front of him and started walking backwards. He knew he was running out of energy, but for some reason, even after transforming the workers, the spell was still sucking the life out of him. <br />
<br />
A squirrel ran across the road into the lot, hit the shimmering reality field, and instantly transformed into a huge, long-necked giraffe. For a moment it stood, startled, and then a large enclosure walled it off and the enclosure itself moved towards the back of the zoo. <br />
<br />
Troy groaned, continuing to walk backwards. <br />
<br />
That was why it had all gone out of control. The spell had hit EVERYTHING in the garage, including any living thing, like mice or rats and birds and…oh god, he’d probably even shifted some insects into animals too! No wonder he was running out of energy, he’d spread the field too wide!<br />
<br />
If he hit the road, he was pretty sure he’d escape the reality shift’s clutches and just pass out. On a highway. Yeah, that was pretty damn risky. Across the road might be safer, but his legs were growing weaker and wobbly the longer the spell went on. He wanted to turn and run, but since the spell seemed to swallow up whatever he focused on, he needed to stay calm and walk backwards at a steady pace and hope he made it.<br />
<br />
Sam and Dustin were gone now, he realized. They’d disappeared in a blink of his eyes, likely ferreted away to another section of the forming zoo. Modern zoos were miles wide, massive facilities, after all. Would the reality shift continue even after he ran out of energy?<br />
<br />
Troy took another step back and slipped, looking down at himself to regain balance.<br />
<br />
And the spell hit him.<br />
<br />
Troy tried to fight the pull of the spell, but he could feel an odd heat emanate within his head, as though someone had poured warm water onto his brain. It permeated his ears, his cheeks, his nose, then poured down throughout his body, as though he were being pumped with warmth. There was a crinkling noise that began to ramp up in volume, his ears tingling.<br />
<br />
He reached up to touch his ears and found them being pulled higher up his head and felt odd. The crinkling sound increased as the cartilage bent and twisted into a wider, more circular form. While he was distracted by his ears changing, his clothes disappeared, leaving him naked in the middle of the gravel path.<br />
<br />
The strangely pleasant tingling sensation prickled in his feet. Troy glanced down and watched his feet stretch, the bones shifting, the top growing a heavy coating of brown fur. His toes shifted and grew in length while the nails thickened and formed a ridge, becoming long, black claws. Fur grew in between his toes, tickling the sensitive skin in between them, followed by an odd puffing sensation from his soles. He lifted his increasingly bearish feet to watch thick paw pads form at the base of his toes and the heels of his feet, swelling and pulsing, turning dark black.<br />
<br />
Fur from his feet was spreading up his legs, which felt like they were growing thicker and heavier, the strange pulsing making them swell along with the wave of heavy fur. Troy licked his lips, mouth dry, and noticed his canines felt larger. His ears twitched nervously, the feeling alien. He was so screwed.<br />
<br />
His hands were next, taking on similar shapes as his feet. The flesh swelled and contorted. His fingers grew long, two inch black nails, then swelled thick and ungainly. He’d never be able to use them properly again. That same thick fur pelt spread over them and advanced up his arms, the sensation itchy and tingly all at once.<br />
<br />
Troy felt his back crack and groaned, arching backwards, opening his mouth in a silent moan as his spine extended. There was a tugging sensation at the base of his spine, and he felt his tailbone shift upwards. Another crack, and his spine stretched further, vertebrae popping into place, and he arched even further, feeling wobbly. The nub at the base of his spine plumped, fur beginning to cover it. It twitched as new muscles formed around it and brought it to life.<br />
<br />
His torso barreled out, muscle and fat filling out his new, enormous frame. His front was growing heavier, making his balance ever more precarious as his small belly grew larger and larger, filling up with fat. A gigantic paunch soon wobbled between his shortening legs. Troy cartwheeled his arms and found his balance, but only barely.<br />
<br />
The transformation finally reached his head. Troy felt the fur spread upwards, his neck creaking and extending. He could feel it crawl up the back of his neck, spreading around his sensitive ears. It tickled around them and over his bald head, giving him a thick coating of fur. The hair around his neck grew thicker, forming a ruff. Only his face remained human, though that was changing quickly.<br />
<br />
That warm, tingly sensation that had suffused his entire being concentrated on his face. His ears twitched as the sound of his skull extending filled his head. The fur spread across his cheeks, making him grimace involuntarily as the muscles stretched. His nose widened and darkened, wriggling into his vision as it stretched forward. His skull widened, as though someone had hooked their fingers in his eye sockets and pulled. His cheekbones shifted outwards, pulling his eye sockets with them. He moaned deeply as his vision shifted, now able to see down and around the sides of his burgeoning muzzle.<br />
<br />
Troy’s jaw cracked as his teeth transformed, becoming more appropriate for a carnivore. Fur tickled its way under Troy’s lengthened chin and jaw, his lips turning jowly and black, until the fur made it all the way to the tip of his muzzle. As it did, his nostril grew incredibly sensitive, picking up a strong male fragrance.<br />
<br />
Only then did he realize that Bubba hadn’t been moved. The big grizzly was still twenty feet in front of him and his cock had grown rigid. Troy could only groan and stare at the animalistic bear dick, nostrils huffing his glorious male scent. <br />
<br />
While the smell of the male bear was driving Troy crazy, his cock wasn’t growing hard. He looked down and noticed that his nipples were migrating down his belly towards his crotch. When they reached their destination, he noticed the flesh around them expand, the nipples growing darker and more prominent. Troy felt that strange heat spread over his genitals, a pleasant tingling enveloping them. <br />
<br />
Troy gasped as a loud squelching sound came from beneath him, his gooch splitting open. The sensation was strangely pleasurable. It wracked his body, almost sending him to all fours and sent shivers through his anus. There was an intense pressure and Troy found himself taking a deep breath. Then deeper and deeper as the pressure increased, his testicles pulling taut against the new opening, shrinking. He grunted as his balls were pulled deep inside him, the tingles making him quiver. He felt his cock begin to shrink, the skin pulling back, his cock taut and hard, now. It began to move further between his legs.<br />
<br />
He moaned as his cock shrank further, the skin stretching around the slit in his gooch. The pressure and tingles increased and the grizzly gasped as she felt her cock pull back inside her. Another lewd squelching sound came from her groin as her cockhead, no bigger than a pea, settled gently beneath a fold of her labia. Troy felt beneath her, feeling a strange wetness in her crotch…and a growing need.<br />
<br />
Troy growled as she rubbed her smooth opening, the sensation incredible. Her tail twitched and her ears folded back as she felt her cunt drip musky fluids. Bubba was so close, she could smell his maleness in the air. All she wanted was to be fucked by him, to feel him fill her womb up with his seed.<br />
<br />
She could feel the fur spread around her new pussy, tickling her cunt-flesh. Troy groaned loud, fluid leaking on her paws and thigh fur. Her arms cracked as her shoulders reconfigured. She felt her balance go at the same time, her weight falling backwards onto her large butt, a trickle of fluid moving down her twitching pucker and across the tip of her tail.<br />
<br />
There was a snort behind her. Troy glanced around and saw Bubba begin sauntering towards her, his snout lifted, black nose twitching as he scented her. Her heart began to thump as the slightly larger grizzly brushed against her side, nudging her. She felt her feminine gash grow wetter, the need to be fucked growing stronger by the second.<br />
<br />
The world whirled around them and suddenly they were in an enclosure. There was a sign nearby that Troy could barely read that identified them as North American Grizzly Bears. Bubba nudged her again and scented her neck fur, grunting and sniffing underneath her as he made his way around her new form. Troy knew she should stop him, but the thought was dim and fading as the big bear made his way to her rear.<br />
<br />
Troy turned her head and looked behind her as her mate sniffed her hot, moist cunt. The muscles winked, clear fluids dribbling down her thigh-fur. She felt Bubba’s cold, wet snout brush up against her pussy, nosing the folds. She lifted her tail and flicked it, revealing her cunt in it’s full, swollen glory, letting the big bear inspect it. Troy growled as Bubba’s tongue rubbed across her swollen folds, the sensation of his flat tongue making her shiver.<br />
<br />
The male’s big heavy paws lifted onto her rump and then worked their way across her back as he positioned himself on top of her. She grunted as she felt his weight fully settle, and then felt his hot cock rub her twitching pussy. The bear pressed forward, his cock spreading her silky lips apart, sliding his warm member further and further inside her. She clenched and gripped it with muscles she never knew she had.<br />
<br />
With a deep grunt, the bear thrust, stretching her lips apart. She could feel his hot breath on her ears and felt the widest part of his cock finally sliding inside her. Then he drew his hips back and thrust, the sensation of him stretching her virgin cunt incredible, her bean rubbing against the smooth shaft sending electric shocks of pleasure through her new, sensitive teats.<br />
<br />
Bubba grunted and panted loudly, his thrusts growing more aggressive. The smells were making Troy crazy, the feeling of his thick cock stretching her, rubbing her in all the new places clouding her mind, her brain tingling as the spell tightened further. She could feel his furry balls gently slapping her undercarriage. The powerful animal on top of her bucked and wheezed, and the feel of him on top of her was so…dominating and arousing.<br />
<br />
The big bear roared and bit down on her neck, claiming her fully. Troy was shocked but the grizzly was incredibly aroused, letting her mate take her like a sow in heat, which she was. She felt the bear’s hips thrust and roll, his balls pulling up tight, slapping her more firmly. Her cunt was quivering more with each firm thrust and new she was close, the warm, tingly waves of orgasmic pleasure building with every thrust. She shivered and felt her neck extend as she felt her climax peak.<br />
<br />
Bubba released her neck and roared, burying his cock deep inside her. It throbbed and hot warmth flooded her insides, filling her up. Troy felt her own orgasm rush through her, cunt contracting and squeezing the cock inside her, milking it, the pleasure pulsing throughout her body. His dick continued gushing seed deep within her womb as they both shivered in the throes of orgasm.<br />
<br />
Troy panted, closing her eyes and letting the tingles in her brain finish their work. She was happy and content with the big bear on top of her. She felt Bubba’s big flat tongue lick her furry head lovingly, muzzle moving down to nuzzle into her ear. The female nuzzled the male back, loving how perfect he was. He pulled out of her and gave her trembling cunt one final lick.<br />
<br />
The grizzly clenched new muscles and felt a small gush of cum splatter out of her backside.  Her body now satisfied, Troy felt the heat that had taken hold of her being vanish as his male personality began to reassert itself.<br />
<br />
The book, Troy realized, must have offered her some protection.  No, she corrected herself, it must have offered HIM some protection.  That thought, the idea of being a male, seemed so foreign.  When she tried to imagine what it felt like to have a cock, her mind came up a blank.  <br />
<br />
No matter how she tried to picture it, she couldn’t remember feeling what it was like to have a cock, or to be human for that matter.  Her new body felt so natural, the drooling cunt below her ass so normal, the best she could picture was what it might feel like to stand upright in her new body – the feeling of using her front claws like fingers or having someone suck her erect teats as though they were a cock.  But she couldn’t remember the *feeling* of being a male human, even though she remembered being a male human just minutes ago.<br />
<br />
Wait a second, Troy realized… her erect teats?  Troy gently ran a thick paw along her chest, feeling twinges of pleasure as it bumped into several small mounds of flesh, each topped with a rock hard nipple.  As she reached the teats in her crotch that through from before, of treating one of her nipples like a cock, forced its way into her mind.  <br />
<br />
Troy could feel her thick, leathery paw pads massaging one of her lower nipples.  She could feel a strange sort of pleasure and heat radiate out from it and spread to the rest of her body.  It was a new sort of diffuse pleasure, one she had never experienced before.  The more Troy rubbed, the more she tried to imagine the nipple as a cock.  Was this what it had felt like?  <br />
<br />
Then she felt a release… not so much an orgasm as a release of… pressure?  The slight dampness that was simultaneously soaking into her belly fur and the bottom of her paw told her that something had just come out of her body, but what?  Was it cum?  How could she cum with this new body?<br />
<br />
She raised the paw to her more sensitive nose, flared her nostrils, and took an inquisitive sniff.  It didn’t smell like cum.  In fact, it didn’t smell like anything at all.  <br />
<br />
She parted her lips and let her tongue come out, running it through the fluid that was glistening on the bottom of her paw.  The taste was sweet, almost like… milk…<br />
<br />
“Oh no!” Troy thought.  Reality had changed.  That didn’t mean that she had been turned into a grizzly bitch and teleported to a breeding zoo.  It meant that she had always been a grizzly bitch.  It meant that she had spent her whole life in this breeding zoo.  It meant that this wasn’t the first time her new body had fucked.  It meant that she had already been…<br />
<br />
Troy felt something squirming in the bottom of her belly.  Then she felt something else kick against her spine – a kick that came from the inside of her own body.  Troy realized she was feeling the grizzly’s cubs… her cubs.<br />
<br />
“Please!” Troy cried out mentally.  <br />
<br />
Holding onto the book hadn’t been a blessing.  Holding onto her… his… mind had been a curse.  Dustin, Bubba, Sam – they were all blissfully unaware of their old existences, content to live out their new animalistic lives.  But Troy knew better.  Troy couldn’t remember… his old body, but he could remember… his old life.<br />
<br />
“Please, all I wanted was to have to fun,” he thought, “I don’t want to be a bear.  I don’t want to be a breeder.  I don’t want to be a…” another internal kick reverberated through the thick layer of bear fat covering her furry belly.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to be a mom!” Troy cried in desperation.<br />
<br />
Just as Troy finished her last thought, she felt a strange miasma creep into the back of her mind. It felt like it was a speaking to her, offering her something, waiting with morbid anticipation for her to beg for her old life back.  It felt like it wanted… something, but what?<br />
<br />
Realizing that whatever entity had wormed its way into her consciousness might not stay long, Troy let out a final plea, “I’ll give you whatever you want, just give me my old life back!”<br />
<br />
There was a bursting sensation from inside of her stomach, like a water balloon had burst.  Troy felt despair fill her being as amniotic fluid rushed down her canal, streaming out onto the ground below her.  She knew what was about to happen.  She knew the life she was about to live out.  She knew that her plea hadn’t been good enough.  That the being in her mind had been dissatisfied with her.
