<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BACKTRACKING:<br />
Douglas Cooper raced home as fast as the sirens on his Sheriff&#39;s cruiser would allow him to traverse the streets of Moon Lake. Normally he would of reprimanded any other officer who did what he was doing now: using the sirens to speed their journey on what was basically a personal matter, but it <i>was</i> an emergency.<br />
Cooper turned off the lights and sirens as he made the final turn on the way to his cabin in the woods, but didn&#39;t slow down any until the rustic residence was in sight.<br />
<i>Definitely have to think about remodeling and expanding the place with my growing family,</i> he realized, stopping the car in front of the place.<br />
Grabbing the hand of bananas he &quot;borrowed&quot; from the employees&#39; break room, the Sheriff&#39;s plan was to quickly tend to his nephew Darrell first, and then to the one who needed him most.<br />
<br />
NOW...<br />
Joan Morning Cloud thought she was floating.<br />
She knew she was feverish, but didn&#39;t understand why.<br />
The last thing the weretigress remembered was lying on the floor, staring at her child Darrell and missing her new fiance Douglas something fierce.<br />
The floating sensation replaced the hard tactile feeling of the wooden floor beneath her fur, but now it felt like she landed as the warm embrace of the comforter on the bed she shared with her lover surrounded her.<br />
A moment later she felt something wet lay across her furry forehead.<br />
Joan tried to open her eyes even as she moaned, calling out Douglas&#39; name longingly, but the darkness claimed her once more.<br />
<br />
Douglas Cooper had picked up his future wife as gently as he could and carried her to the bedroom they shared.<br />
After quickly making all the preparations for a long afternoon together alone that he needed to, Cooper quickly stripped off his Sheriff&#39;s uniform and happily assumed his werebear fursona, staring with deep love and affection at his mate.<br />
They had already had their were-wedding when she accepted his marriage proposal, but unfortunately there was no chance to celebrate their union due to Fredrick Parker&#39;s planned siege of the town jail to break his no-good son out, and the longer Joan went without Douglas the sicker she was becoming.<br />
But all that was behind them now as the werebear crawled into bed to be with his weretigress.<br />
<br />
Joan felt a tingling sensation all across her furry body.<br />
It started at the lips of her muzzle before travelling down her neck.<br />
There was a very sensual and prolonged experience in and around her breasts before the tingling sensation started down her stomach and now was circling that wonderfully magical place between her legs.<br />
The weretigress opened her weary eyes. As her blurred vision slowly came into focus, she dearly hoped that what she was seeing now was not a fevered delusion.<br />
&quot;Douglas?&quot; she moaned.<br />
&quot;Yes darling?&quot; he said, peering up from between her legs and joyfully licking the <i>honey</i> from his muzzle while smiling at her.<br />
&quot;Is it really you?&quot; she hoped.<br />
&quot;Yes darling, it&#39;s really me. I&#39;m back, and we have the rest of this afternoon and all of tonight to start our new life together,&quot; promised Douglas, before giving her vagina another long and sensual lick, stopping to tease the clit with a push of his nose as the werebear deeply inhaled her heated scent. &quot;But there&#39;s one thing I have to ask you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I already said &#39;yes&#39;. We just need to set the date,&quot; Joan reminded him.<br />
&quot;We will be discussing that later, along with a lot of other stuff, but I have to ask you this right now: did you take your weretigress birth control pill this morning?&quot;<br />
He would willingly help Joan add more children to their family in time, as many as she wanted and could safely bring into the world, but not today.<br />
&quot;I... I don&#39;t remember,&quot; she admitted, before Joan started to sob.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay dear. Just a moment,&quot; said Douglas, before the werebear raced to the bathroom.<br />
He quickly came back with a little pink pill in one paw. He handed it to her along with a bottle of water.<br />
Joan anxiously took her prescription, then set the water bottle down on the nightstand near her.<br />
&quot;Now then, where were we?&quot; Joan asked with a smile, holding her paws out to him.<br />
<br />
Douglas took her paws in his, not caring about the contrasting colors between tigress and bear.<br />
All that mattered was how much they loved and needed each other, especially at this moment.<br />
As he laid in the bed beside her, Douglas started repeating his earlier path of kisses.<br />
This time, Joan responded more enthusiastically than before, savoring every touch of her fiance.<br />
Douglas took his time working his way back to where he left off, not only to allow his mate the chance to enjoy every little kiss, but also to give her birth control pill time to work its way through her system.<br />
Soon he was back where he was when she regained consciousness, joyfully slurping up delicious gobs of tigress honey from her furry chalice.<br />
&quot;Oh Douglas!&quot; moaned Joan, but this time from the joys of experiencing multiple orgasms, even as her paws continued to caress his head and attempt to press Cooper&#39;s muzzle deeper into her vagina.<br />
<br />
Hoping she was ready, because he couldn&#39;t wait any more, Douglas reared up and &#39;walked&#39; closer to her on his knees.<br />
A huge smile crossed the weretigress&#39; face as Joan saw the large werebear penis approaching its target.<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; Joan roared, spreading her pussy lips open with her own paws as she felt the tip of his penis tease her clit.<br />
Joan reached up to embrace her man as his cock slowly entered her.<br />
The werebear gently released his entire body weight as his furry form sank closer to her striped body, Douglas&#39; hard bear-hood being hungrily eaten by his sex starved tigress.<br />
Not completely realizing it until now, Joan Morning Cloud had started recovering from the pain and anguish of an unconsummated were-wedding the moment Douglas Cooper first touched her.<br />
Each tender kiss was another step on the road to wellness, and now with him deep inside her, the weretigress finally felt complete with her werebear.<br />
Douglas waited to continue. Savoring holding Joan in his furry arms once more, relishing the feeling of her body against his, his maleness deep within the grasp of her feminine cave, as if it was never going to release it ever again.<br />
Finally, as if by mutual yet silent consent, they began to move; each slowly giving and taking in their erotic dance of love.<br />
Soon their movements started to become more frenzied until it developed into a race to reach the finish line and achieve the ultimate objective of orgasmic bliss together.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before the bear growled and the tigress roared, heralding the arrival of the pinnacle of their union as their bodies shook together in mutual orgasm.<br />
<br />
Joan Morning Cloud slowly opened her eyes, feeling the weight of her mate upon her body.<br />
The fact that his shaft was not only still hard but also deep within her only added to the weretigress&#39; new sensations of happiness and well being.<br />
At last, for lack of a better word, she finally felt complete.<br />
Her paws gently caressed her were-husband&#39;s fur as he snored lightly.<br />
It felt as if they had reached the summit of some unscaleable peak together and jumped out into the unknown as one.<br />
The first touch of her lips against his caused Douglas to stir.<br />
He opened his eyes to stare at his new were-wife.<br />
Although at least a good decade older than her, having never been married before, it was a new experience for him, but one Douglas was looking forward to every second of.<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; was the first words they spoke, practically in unison.<br />
&quot;So, we&#39;re married now?&quot; asked Joan, nuzzling against him.<br />
&quot;Only in the eyes of nature, each other, and our fellow weres,&quot; answered Douglas. &quot;We still have to set a date and have a more formal ceremony to satisfy the laws of Washington State and the rest of the world.&quot;<br />
&quot;The problems with that mobster?&quot; she asked, a little fearfully.<br />
&quot;All taken care of,&quot; announced Douglas with a smile. &quot;I don&#39;t have to be back at work until tomorrow morning, when the Feds show up for their originally scheduled pick up of Daniel Parker and hopefully take his father and goons off our paws. But I already talked to Tachibana of the Elders&#39; Council before Darrell called me. The Code W alert will stay active until all the Parkers are gone from Moon Lake though.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is Darrell all right?&quot; she asked with concern.<br />
&quot;He was worried about you when he called 911 to get a hold of me, but everything&#39;s all right now,&quot; promised Douglas, holding her closer.<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said Joan with a smile before kissing him.<br />
When their lips finally parted, the tigress stared at him and said coyly, &quot;I do have one request hubby.&quot;<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s within my power, it&#39;s yours,&quot; he promised, wrapping his arms tighter around her, as if never wanting to let Joan go again.<br />
&quot;I want on top this time!&quot; she announced, as the weretigress started to flip them over.<br />
<br />
And outside in the living room of the Cooper Cottage, Darrell Cooper simply smiled as he turned up the volume on the television set and started eating another bowl of cereal with bananas.</p>
