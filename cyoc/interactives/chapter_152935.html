<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex hit the button to randomize all, and waited as the game processed.  Then the results came up.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Name: Bortock Brandywire<br />
Sex: Male<br />
Race: Beastfolk(Bull)<br />
Occupation: Slave<br />
Class: Barbarian(Wild Walker) lv 1<br />
:::<br />
<br />
What? Slave? Well, that wasn&#39;t good.  He supposed that if the game was like most games, the plot would allow him to get free, though?  Then he looked at his stat rolls and his skills.  He noticed that he had a Wild Wisdom once a day skill that let him temporarily switch his attack with his wisdom and use specific spells.  So he could be a warrior that could turn into a mage?  Well that was cool.  Since obviously he should make a DPS fighter build, he assigned his stat rolls accordingly, including the 8 bonus points granted by his randomization, so that the rest of his character sheet looked like so:<br />
<br />
:::<br />
STR: 22<br />
DEX: 16<br />
CON: 18<br />
INT: 13<br />
WIS: 9<br />
CHA:  10<br />
<br />
Active Skills:<br />
<br />
Bullserker lv 1: Once a day skill that increases your strength for a short time.<br />
Wild Wisdom lv 1:  Once a day skill that temporarily switches your strength with your wisdom and allows the the use of specific spells.  More spells unlocked at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Passive Skills:<br />
-Nature Affinity:  As a Beastfolk, you have a natural affinity for nature, and will be stronger in nature magic,  herbology, or beast taming, should you choose to pursue those paths<br />
-Breeder Stud: Blessed with unusual virility and stamina.  Large genitals, greater sperm production, and a random chance for a +1 to constitution at each level up.<br />
- The Cursed Hero: You will level up quickly, but luck is not your friend, and evil will be attracted to you.<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
<br />
-Summon Wild Beasts lv 1(only available with Wild Wisdom):  Summon any nearby wild beasts to fight for you.<br />
-Nature&#39;s Blessing lv 1(only available with Wild Wisdom):  Give a target HP regeneration for a short time.<br />
<br />
Information:  Born to the Maltuck tribe of the hills, you enjoyed a simple and free life in the wilds and looked to one day becoming chief of your tribe, until Orc slavers captured you.  Now you&#39;re about to be auctioned.<br />
:::<br />
<br />
He chuckled at the Breeder Stud passive skill.  That was certainly nice.  Then a tingling and came over him, and he realized he was really going to transform into a beastfolk bull-man!  He started to grow and gain muscle, instantly tearing his clothing to shreds. Woe, what a rush! It didn&#39;t take long till he was well over 7 feet tall and rippling with muscle from head to toe.  Then he began to grow fur.  Horns grew in.  His snout pushed out and he grew a whip-like tail.  Looking down at his cock he realized it was about to grow, and with eager lust he began to rigorously beat off.  Grunting bull-like sounds, he rapidly achieved an erection, the biggest of his life, and then it only grew bigger, and bigger.  It was incredible!  He felt so powerful!  So masculine!  He was the ultimate stud, and this was the ultimate ego trip.  His balls swelled larger, and soon he was working a 13 inch shaft with balls  bigger than tennis balls!  Then he came, spraying an absurd amount of cum across the room. <br />
<br />
Afterwards he smirked as he looked at all the cum with pride, and idly stroked himself as he considered trying another round.  He certainly felt he could.<br />
<br />
But then the cottage environment faded away, and he found himself in a cage at a slave auction.  His hands went to the magical slave-collar around his neck, which was his only adornment.  His still dripping cock was on full display for the crowd as he stood there in his nakedness.  He might have been embarrassed if he were still human, but he was a wildling beastfolk now, and used to going naked.  It was strange how much he felt like the new character.  Alex was still in there , but he felt like Bortock the bull now, and he liked it, liked feeling strong, wild, and powerful, even if it made him loathe being a slave all the more.  He reminded himself that he might get free.<br />
<br />
Then it was his time to be showcased.  The orcish slave master came to his cage.  &quot;You&#39;re up, bull,&quot; he said, &quot;Now be a good little animal or that slave collar will put you in a world of pain.&quot;  Bortock snorted derisively.  He hated orcs.  He&#39;d kill the slave master before this was over, but for now he&#39;d bide his time.<br />
<br />
Following directions he stepped up onto the stage.  Many potential buyers came by for a pre-auction inspection.  They poked and prodded at other slaves, but the glare in his eyes made most of them keep their distance from Bortock.  Then came one who didn&#39;t seem intimidated.  He looked human, but if he was, he was the most powerfully built human Bortock had ever seen, and almost as tall as Bortock.  But something didn&#39;t seem right about that.  This human had the vibe more of a sniveling and sneaky sorcerer than of a powerful warrior, even if he did have a layer of ego covering that up.   He looked at Bortock with evil in his eyes.  &quot;What&#39;s your name, slave?&quot;  he asked.<br />
<br />
Bortock only sneered at him, until the slave collar was triggered, sending searing pain through his whole body.  He glared at the slave master,  unbroken, but he decided to answer anyway.  &quot;I am Bortock of the hill tribes.&quot;  he said with pride and raised chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, an unbroken spirit, eh?&quot;  said the human.<br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize, Lord Renux.&quot; said the slavemaster, &quot;We&#39;ll have this one better trained, soon.  Let me take him away and show you to some other options.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, that won&#39;t be necessary,&quot; said Renux, &quot;I very much enjoy watching their spirits break.  I&#39;ll train him myself.  Leave him on the stage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Renux left, but soon another customer who seemed intimidated showed up.  This was was a VERY busty dark elf sorceress though.  His cock twitched as he looked down her robe.  She wore no undergarment, and he could easily see her nipples from his superior height.  When she noticed him staring, she only smiled and winked at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this one looks like a fine specimen,&quot; she remarked to the slave master.<br />
<br />
&quot;yes, but not yet broken in, sadly&quot;  said the orc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? how lovely.&quot; she said, stepping closer, &quot;I may touch, yes?  I need to know if he&#39;ll make a suitable breeder.&quot;  Again she winked at him.  <br />
<br />
Ok, he definitely hoped she&#39;d be the one to buy him now!  The orc nodded, and she stepped closer.  Then to his shock, but most certainly not to his displeasure, she grabbed his cock and lifted it up.  She brought her head shamelessly close as she peered at it, even sniffed it as she hefted it, and then did the same with his balls.  He started to grow hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll need a full demonstration of his breeding capacity, of course.&quot; she said, and then she started to work his shaft with her hands!  Bortock grinned at her as he grew to full size, and the look of surprise, and even lust, on her face as she saw how big he could get made him smile all the wider.  Oh, he&#39;d be fucking this bitch soon, sure enough.  Then he came, spraying cum all over her face and down her breasts.  The orc tried to apologize to the sorceress, but she only waved him off and smiled at Bortock as she licked the cum off her lips.  &quot;Excellent!  He&#39;ll do quite nicely indeed.&quot;  she said.<br />
<br />
Then she left, and the auction began.  </p>
