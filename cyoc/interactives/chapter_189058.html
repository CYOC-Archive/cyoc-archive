<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim placed the ring on the table, unaware of its powerful reality altering abilities. He then went back into his office for work while Georgia sat down in the living room to watch some real housewives. Erika, meanwhile, was happily biting a chew toy in the other room, blissfully unaware of who she had once been.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, Georgia had pulled herself off the couch and away from her &quot;garbage&quot; tv to get a snack. As she waddled, she tried to remember if when she was pregnant with Mindy or Kyle that her cravings were this bad, but for some reason the answer wasn&#39;t coming quickly to her.<br />
&quot;Ugh, damn this pregnancy brain.&quot; She muttered.<br />
<br />
On the counter she spotted a jar of pickles. With a lick of her lips she narrowed in on the prize, and in scooping up the jar also managed to subconsciously grab the ring as well. It was pressed between the jar and her hand, right up until she laid her large ass back into place. Once she sat down, it slid gently onto her right hand, making her unaware of any changes she made.<br />
<br />
While chomping on a pickle, her pigging out was interrupted by a kick from her stomach. This caused her to cringe her face up, but soon followed it with a light smile.<br />
&quot;Well, at least I&#39;m VERY close to popping.&quot; She chuckled aloud.<br />
<br />
She tried to focus back in on the t.v., but suddenly her world spun a little. She shut her eyes to try and focus in, and when she opened them once more she found herself sitting on the bathroom floor. &quot;Why am I surprised...&quot; She thought to herself. &quot;I remember, I came in her to check... oh my god.&quot; She thought before her jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
In her hand was a pregnancy test, and in the little display were two red lines. Her face lite up with glee.<br />
&quot;Holy crap.&quot; She mumbled. &quot;I&#39;m pregnant!&quot; <br />
<br />
Then, her vision blurred once more, but only for a moment, so fast that she hardly noticed. She let off a sigh, seeing yet again a single solitary line. Jim and her had been trying to get pregnant for a while, but they just weren&#39;t getting another.<br />
&quot;Oh well.&quot; She thought, throwing the test out. &quot;I guess we&#39;ll just have to keep trying.&quot; She smirked, thinking about the next few nights of hot love making and cream pies.<br />
<br />
While Georgia walked out of the bathroom and through the hallway, she felt happy at how easy it was to move around. It was an odd thought, but figured it was just one of those random good feelings you get like when one remembers how nice it is to be healthy rather than sick. She brushed her brunette hair aside with her manicured nails and strutted along, unaware she was even wearing the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOM!&quot; A loud but distant voice yelled out, breaking her calm happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.&quot; She sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! There you are!&quot; Kyle called out, rushing into the room.<br />
<br />
Georgia stared at him as he ran up. He took after Jim more than she did, and was slowly becoming her handsome young man. Though he did have her hair and eye color, he looked a LOT like a younger Jim. However, her thoughts of pride dwindled upon seeing his face looking nervous and concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; She asked, placing her hands on her hips to emphasize her worried but annoyed tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, uh, can you help me with this project thing I need to hand in tomorrow? I know, I know, you told me to do most of it but I just thought you could give me a little helping hand?&quot; He asked with a sly grin and a shrug.<br />
<br />
Kyle was usually good at having his way, but Georgia was having none of that today.<br />
&quot;Ugh, unbelievable. You have to do it on your own, you&#39;re in 8th grade now for goodness sake, you&#39;re not a toddler anymore, I can&#39;t always hold you hand!&quot; She scolded just as another minor bout of dizziness hit her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy, look what I drew!&quot; A cute voice announced from below.<br />
<br />
Georgia looked down and smiled. Her three year old Kyle was proudly holding up a nonsensical smattering of paint colors on a canvas that she had given him. She patted him on the head, then gave him a forehead kiss which caused him to giggle. The child ran away, likely off to do some more messy hand paintings.<br />
<br />
&quot;My oh my he&#39;s such a creative boy.&quot; Georgia thought to herself. &quot;Hope he keeps it going forwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Georgia now walked again with joy in her heart. She couldn&#39;t place why, and she felt like something was... different somehow, but it didn&#39;t stop enjoying the feeling. She rounded the living room then made her way up the stairs, noting that she&#39;d need a new bra as her breasts were a little... unruly with each step up. She sighed, hoping that if Jim and her did have another kid that it wouldn&#39;t permanently increase her cup size like it had when she had Kyle a few years back.<br />
<br />
She was heading for her own bedroom, but was interrupted yet again when the house phone began to ring about. She stopped for the closest phone, that being in the guest room, then sat on the bed to talk to whoever was on the other line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; She answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Georgia! How are you girl!&quot; The voice of her old friend Wendy from college answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey girl, and you know, it&#39;s whatever.&quot; She lied, inadvertently making it more truer than before. &quot;How are you?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, to tell you the truth I&#39;ve been a bit down lately. But, I was talking with Susan and she gave me a great idea. Her daughter Tina was going out to a party tonight, and I thought maybe we could all go, like old times!&quot; She suggested.<br />
<br />
Georgia sighed. As much as she&#39;d love to, she just couldn&#39;t go out and party like they were young again.<br />
&quot;Sorry Wendy, but I&#39;m not a college student I&#39;m a mother.&quot; She began before feeling a twinge lightheaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So anyway, Brad will pick us up at like 9, and then- hey girl, you even listening?&quot; The other line asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, what?&quot; Georgia asked, slightly thrown off.<br />
<br />
&quot;The party girl, you&#39;re still in remember!&quot; The voice laughed.<br />
<br />
Georgia suddenly remembered, the party! How could she have forgotten? What kept making her so dizzy? She glanced around her room to see if there was some like mold or weird sound or something but saw nothing unusual. Her room still looked like a typical high school girl&#39;s room with boyband posters, purple walls and a large bed stuffed to the brim with pillows that she was now laying on, talking into her cell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, gotta make a mental note to change this stuff. It&#39;s fine when I&#39;m at Uni for months but MAJORLY embarrassing if I ever bring a boy home.&quot; She thought, twirling her suddenly blonde hair, given to her by a new mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Tina, like, go ahead.&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay good. So after Brad-&quot; She began when a tiny voice from behind Georgia interrupted her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, one sec Tina.&quot; Georgia grumbled. She then turned around to see her little sister Mindy standing in her doorway. &quot;What&#39;d you say twerp?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I SAID you promised to play with me!&quot; Mindy teared up, pulling on her dress. &quot;Why don&#39;t you ever do stuff I want? Why can you do whatever?&quot; She asked, annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna know why? Because I&#39;m the older one and YOU are the younger one.&quot; Georgia scoffed. She was about to return to her call when she felt like she was almost falling. She quickly realized that duh, it was because she was standing up... why had she felt like she was sitting just a bit ago?<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway Tina, even if I didn&#39;t have work to do I also promised my little sis something.&quot; Mindy explained on her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, whatever nerd. God, I still can&#39;t believe we&#39;re roommates.&quot; She scoffed before hanging up.<br />
<br />
Georgia gawked as her sister stood up, towering over her. Why was that surprising again? She still couldn&#39;t place it and still didn&#39;t really care. Her sister wore a comfy sweater, a short skirt with dark leggings. Her blonde hair was unkept in a mane of hair which just touched her shoulders. She straightened her glasses, smiled, then the 19 year old leant down to talk face to face with her little sister.<br />
&quot;Hi G, you ready?&quot; Mindy asked.<br />
<br />
Georgia gasped &quot;You can play with me?&quot; She asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
Her vision blurred for a millisecond and Mindy&#39;s smile turned to a frown. <br />
&quot;Sorry kiddo I got work to do right now.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Maybe tomorrow okay?&quot; She replied before grabbing her laptop, patting a sad Georgia on the head then walked off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, nobody wants to play today!&quot; She thought, frustrated. As she began to walk back to her own room, her mind was racing in anger. &quot;Stupid Kyle just wants to paint bad, Daddy is still working, Mommy was still on the phone, and now Mindy won&#39;t even play!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mindy walked into her bright pink room, then plopped on the floor with anger in her eyes.<br />
&quot;Now how can I play princess?&quot; She muttered to herself.<br />
<br />
Just then, the slightly open door creaked open more. Georgia was initially hopeful but that quickly left as Erika the Saint Bernard trotted into her room, panting heavily. Georgia went back to pouting, but soon couldn&#39;t ignore the massive dog as she tried to like Georgia&#39;s face. The little girl only could just barely keep her off.<br />
&quot;No Erika, no! You&#39;re a dog, not a little girl, you can&#39;t play princess!&quot; She yelled before suddenly falling forward, as if the dog had vanished.<br />
<br />
She sat back up, shaking her head from another dizzy spell then looked forward. Standing before her was a little girl with wavy red hair, a ton of freckles and a massive smile. The girl smiled at Georgia, and held up a Cinderella costume and a Belle costume.<br />
&quot;Come on Georgia, let&#39;s play princess!&quot; She yelled happily.<br />
<br />
Georgia blinked a few times, then her shocked face became one filled with joy.<br />
&quot;Okay Erica!&quot; She laughed, running over to pick the Cinderella costume. <br />
<br />
The two girls began to play, unaware that this morning, before reality changed, they had been husband and wife.<br />
<br />
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Jim walked out of his office with a yawn. He could only work for so long before needing a brief break, and working from home just made breaks way easier. As he walked into the kitchen to grab a snack, he felt like something was off. He glanced around and didn&#39;t see anything out of the ordinary, however.<br />
<br />
He saw his wife Susan talking on the phone and his daughter Mindy typing on her laptop, but nothing was different about them... at least he was pretty sure. Just as he was about to leave, he spotted that the counter was empty, and the ring they had found earlier was gone!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh geez, where&#39;s that ring?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, okay Wendy I gotta g- yes I know Tina isn&#39;t warming up to you but you are her step mother so just portray dominance! Okay, okay... okay good, bye hon.&quot; Susan said as she hung up the phone. &quot;What ring honey?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ring... you and I found before?&quot; He said, unsure of that answer himself.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Susan&#39;s eyes seemed to light up. <br />
&quot;Oh THAT ring, I totally forgot honey! Sorry, I fully forgot. I don&#39;t know where it is, I didn&#39;t move it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you Mindy did you see it or take it?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gosh like no dad, you know I&#39;m not the biggest jewelry girl.&quot; She snickered. &quot;Why do you want it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it could be worth something.&quot; Jim replied. For some reason, he felt like he should&#39;ve had a better source of extra side money, but no longer had it anymore. <br />
<br />
The ring was struggling to catch up the new reality&#39;s memories as too many large changes had happened at once. Jim shock his head of his confused thoughts and continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look just keep an eye out for it and let me know if you find it please.&quot; He said. &quot;Oh, someone&#39;s gotta drive Erica back to her parent&#39;s place later.&quot; He added.<br />
<br />
Jim left, Susan began to vacuum and Mindy continued her work, unaware of how their reality had been entirely different not too long ago. So, who would eventually find the ring with Georgia? Would they try to take it? Would more changes ensue? Would someone finally become aware of future changes by placing the ring on their left hand?</p>
