<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Malik groaned in boredom as he watched the security scrying orb at the lookout station. His fellow lookout and workout partner, Salim, rolled his muscular shoulders while keeping his eyes on every orb. They’d been commanded to keep watch for pirates and offshore storms. Malik hoped pirates would make a try for their ship. He’d give anything for some action.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter was that he hadn’t really been paying attention for the last two hours. Instead, he’d stared at his reflection on the crystal orbs and flexed. Although he was only 19, at 6’4 he was well-built, muscular from street fighting, and deeply tanned. Scars from those street fights crisscrossed his flesh, but it did nothing to distract from his rugged good looks.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t remember much about his past beyond that, which he had to admit was quite weird. Sometimes he’d remember being a rather runty street urchin, barely surviving life on the streets before joining the crew in hopes for a better life. It was all rather vague, but for some reason he was sure he’d sucked off the otter-kin captain and had managed to impress him by using techniques he’d picked up when he’d worked as a janitor at a brothel. <br />
<br />
But that was only done out of desperation. Malik didn’t like how sexually active the crew was with each other. He wouldn’t call himself prudish, it was just that it didn’t feel right, going on a dangerous adventure and fucking his crew-mates. Like they weren’t taking things seriously, downplaying the fact that despite the ship likely being a powerful artifact, it would still get sunk by the literal armada the Crimson Corsairs could bring to bear.<br />
<br />
That and the fact that every shift forced him with another horny crew member that wanted to suck him off. Again, he didn’t mind getting sucked off, he was gay. But it just didn’t seem professional. So he’d basically avoided talking to anyone on the ship. It was too bad, because if they’d just acted like an normal crew, he’d likely have taken passes at them. Any of them, really, they were all hot, being around them made him flustered.<br />
<br />
Apart from the weird perversions, the perks were great. They pay was absolutely amazing. The uniforms were sharp looking. The Captain was a clothing designer and every once in a while he’d force Malik to model for him. He…didn’t mind the Captain. His little dick was actually fun to suck off and, well, he’d never say no to the Captain. Too bad he was married to that strange metal Dragonborn.<br />
<br />
Plus there was the cool baton they’d issued to him and the crew. It was made using strange magics, capable of extending 15 feet with a word. Excellent range, plus the lightning damage that was powerful enough to knock most people out in one blow was also nice. He patted it lovingly.<br />
<br />
Too bad he’d never get to use it. Ship duty was so boring. He wanted to be out there, with the adventuring party, killing pirates. It was why he joined the crew, after all. He still couldn’t believe how lax everyone was. There wasn’t even anything more complex to do, the little robo-bolds performed all the maintenance. He thought that was a mistake. Everyone on the crew should be knowledgeable of the ships function and maintenance.<br />
<br />
Malik couldn’t handle it anymore. He got up from his seat and started for the door.<br />
<br />
“Where are you going? Isn’t it a little early for lunch?” Salim asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to make better use of my time.” Malik replied.<br />
<br />
“Look sahib, I know that this is boring and easy. But we’re new to the crew and need to prove we can do easy jobs before we move on to more complicated duties.” Salim stood, staring at Malik with some concern.<br />
<br />
“Prove that we can withstand sheer boredom?”<br />
<br />
“That we can be relied on. That we are willing to put in our time.”<br />
<br />
“You’ve got this covered.” Malik said coldly, walking to the elevator and pressing the down button. “I’m finding something else to do.”<br />
<br />
Salim sighed as Malik left. He knew how Malik felt. But the adventurers already had able fighters, they didn’t need Malik out there, they needed him defending the ship. Salim just hoped Malik hit the gym to work off his frustration and come back in a few hours and not do anything stupid that got him kicked off the ship.<br />
<br />
-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-==-=-=--==-<br />
<br />
Indeed, the gym was Malik’s destination. The ship was in full swing, robo-bolds rushing around underfoot, carrying supplies and equipment. He walked past the cargo hold and paused at the open doorway. The gnolls were picking up crates and moving them around, stacking them and organizing them properly. They wore nothing but thongs, their fur glistening with sweat.<br />
<br />
Malik gulped, dick growing hard. The gnolls were wagging their tails, musk creeping out into the hall. They seemed just as excited as he was, the red tips of their lipstick-like cocks halfway out of their sheathes. Music was playing from a speaker and they were shaking their tails in sync with the beat. One of them noticed Malik watching the gnolls from the doorway. His eyes went from Malik’s face to his groin, lingering over the tent in his pants, then back up to meet Malik’s eyes. The gnoll winked.<br />
<br />
He blushed and closed the door before he got any ideas. The gym was next door and, to his great relief, was empty. Many strange-looking contraptions, likely of the kobold’s design, filled the room. Captain Rashid had told them that they would help them train. Each machine came with a tracker that noted improvements from the last session and their personal muscle to fat ratio.<br />
<br />
Malik walked over to one of the weight machines and cracked his knuckles. For the past few days he’d been working on his arms, trying to grow his muscles into veritable pythons. He lay down on the bench, ignoring the sign that said he needed something called a ‘spotter’. Likely another attempt to get him to fuck another crew member. He did a few tests reps, adjusting the settings into something a bit more difficult. Then he began lifting in earnest.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
“...48...49…50.” Malik gasped, lifting the barbell above him, hands and arms starting to shake from exertion.<br />
<br />
Malik struggled on for a few more reps, his mind focused on becoming strong enough to join the adventurers. His arms grew heavier and heavier. Malik pushed for one last rep. The weight rose shakily up on twitching arms. Then his muscles gave out and the weight fell.<br />
<br />
“Gah!” Malik wheezed at the sudden weight on his chest. <br />
<br />
Desperately, he tried to lift it off of him, shift it to his side. But his arms felt like rubber and he couldn&#39;t summon enough strength. He wheezed, looking around for something or someone to help him. His eyes fell on the warning sign next to the bench. Realizing how screwed he was, the human kicked his feet and rocked his chest, trying to get the weight off of him.<br />
<br />
His vision began to blur, cock inexplicably growing hard from lack of air. Malik’s struggles began to slow. His legs gave one last kick as his thoughts began to fade. Suddenly, the weight was lifted off his chest and he took a big gulp of air, heart pounding in his chest. He clutched his chest and stared as the weight continued to rise, a pair of ghostly hands lifting it away.<br />
<br />
“Why are you in here? You should be back at your post with Salim.” A deep, angry voice spoke from the doorway.<br />
<br />
Malik managed to prop himself up using the bench. Zuberi was standing in the hallway, scowling at him angrily. His black robes fit him perfectly, emphasizing his huge, protuberant belly. The shiny bald dome of the orc’s scalp glistened under the artificial lights of the room. He clearly shaved it. The mage hands continued hovering a foot above Malik’s head, keeping the weight from crushing him.<br />
<br />
The human rolled out from under the barbell and the orc lowered the weight, settling back in its bar. He came to his feet and glared at the orc in annoyance.<br />
<br />
“Just working out. Something you should think about doing, old man.” Malik crossed his arms. “And shouldn&#39;t you be working too?”<br />
<br />
“I work on far more important things than my body. And you should be grateful. If I didn’t happen to be going to the galley for a snack, you’d be dead.” Zuberi snorted. “We all have jobs to do. Yours is lookout. So get on it.”<br />
<br />
“No, gramps, I don’t think I will.” Malik strode over to the orc, who was only a few inches taller than he was and pressed his firm abs against the elderly wizard’s gut. “And if you’re so smart, maybe you can answer a question I’ve been having. Why are the otter and kobold so ripped if they never work out?”<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re young and headstrong and that&#39;s a recipe for disaster.&quot; Greg replied to the rather arrogant human, watching as the muscular youth started to size him up. The idiot. &quot;Besides, if you can&#39;t follow basic instructions like &#39;Don&#39;t lift without a partner&#39; or &#39;Don&#39;t leave your post&#39;, then you&#39;re just going to get yourself killed. Get back to your station.&quot; <br />
<br />
“And do what? The robo-bolds do everything complex around here and you have two crew members doing a job that one person could easily do alone.” Malik said, growing angry. “I’m tired of constantly having to fight off horny crew members. I just want to be alone sometimes!”<br />
<br />
“While I can certainly respect that, we have you work in shifts just in case one of you gets a wild hair up your ass and runs off. Or needs to use the bathroom-”<br />
<br />
“Or to get us to fuck while the Captain watches from a scrying orb and jerks off.” Malik snorted.<br />
<br />
Zuberi grinned. “Or that, yes. Look, I can tell you’ve got some brains. Use them. How is rebelling while we’re docked in a port going to help you?”<br />
<br />
“That’s just it, I want to be out there with them!” Malik growled. “You took one measly crossbow bolt and here you are, going to the galley to stuff your face. They can take me out with them.”<br />
<br />
“You think you can handle adventuring when you can barely handle your own job?” Zuberi laughed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m pretty sure I can.”<br />
<br />
“So, let me get this straight. You want to take my place in the adventuring party?” Zuberi looked at him seriously. “Are you sure that’s what you want?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
Zuberi rubbed his bare scalp and shrugged. “Okay. Then let’s make a bet. Beat me, and I’ll let you in our circle.”<br />
<br />
“What’s the bet?”<br />
<br />
“Follow me and I’ll show you.”<br />
<br />
Zuberi brought Malik to the game room. Scrying orbs vied for his attention. Some of the games here had fake guns, wheels, and oddly-configured devices called ‘controllers’. Malik glanced at them. He and the other crew members had been uncertain about them when they first got on the ship, but now they’d play them regularly. It was all strangely realistic.<br />
<br />
The orc wizard walked towards a table in the back.  On the table was a plain, unadorned deck of cards. Zuberi pulled out a chair and indicated Malik to sit down. Music began to play from the speakers, something foreign and rather catchy. The orc shuffled the cards using the strange ghostly hands while he grabbed a bottle of whiskey and took a glug from it.<br />
<br />
“Really? A card game, old man? I thought we were going to play something that required a bit more skill than this.” Malik grinned at the orc, who was shuffling the cards like a pro.<br />
<br />
“We’re playing strip poker. If you’re nude, I win. If I’m nude, you win.” <br />
<br />
“And I get a seat at the table, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, but if I win, I can anything I want with you, including what your position on the crew is.” Zuberi said.<br />
<br />
“Stop flapping your jowls and deal cards, wizard.”<br />
<br />
Zuberi smirked and the game began. The orc lost hand after hand. Stripped down of most of his clothing, his green skin glistened in the light. For some reason, the orc showed no sign of quitting. If anything, he appeared more confident, rubbing his bare gut, giving it a slap. It was distracting and rather off putting. The orc lit a cigar and stroked his beard. Eventually, the only thing left on his aged body was his undergarments and his dense gray treasure trail.<br />
<br />
“Looks like you’re about to lose, orc.” Malik grinned, still fully clothed. “One more hand and I win.”<br />
<br />
“You seem confident. Fine.” Zuberi growled, eyeing Malik. “Let’s double the rewards. If you win, I give you my position. If I win, I get to do whatever I want to you.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, double or nothing.” Malik smirked. “Were you throwing the game on purpose then?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe.” Zuberi smiled back, running his sausage-like fingers through his chest hair, watching the human’s eyes as the followed his hand’s movement with interest. “But maybe you won’t mind what I have in store for you?”<br />
<br />
Malik blinked and shook his head. “Stop trying to throw me off my game. I’ll agree to your terms.”<br />
<br />
Zuberi smirked, patting his belly, his eyes glowing purple. Malik stared as Zuberi’s gut as it jiggled. The orc grinned and used mage hand to open a bag of chips, popping them into his mouth. When the next round of cards were dealt, the old orc won easily.<br />
<br />
“Lucky.” Malik took off his grip-gloves and set them aside. As his did, his hands turned green and swelled with fat, his callouses disappearing, leaving only wrinkled, soft skin. He scratched his hand as coarse black hairs grew on the backs of them and on the knuckles, unaware of their sudden similarity to Zuberi’s.<br />
<br />
“Gods, I can’t believe it works.” Zuberi’s eye widened as the changes finished.<br />
<br />
“What works?” Malik asked impatiently, scratching his head with his meatier hands.<br />
<br />
“Oh, just my strategy to beat you, young man.” Zuberi smiled and dealt out another hand.<br />
<br />
“Fine, have it your way. If I find out you’re cheating, I’ll kill you.”<br />
<br />
Zuberi said nothing, too busy counting cards to care about the threat. He kept an eye on Malik, interested in how the changes would occur. Malik lost two hands in a row.<br />
<br />
“Alright, take off your uniform cap and that necklace.” Zuberi said.<br />
<br />
“There’s no rules about which clothes I need to remove first.” Malik protested.<br />
<br />
“I apologize, you are right. Go ahead and unlace your boots.” Zuberi rolled his pretty blue eyes.<br />
<br />
Malik blinked. “Damn. You got me. Cap and necklace it is.”<br />
<br />
The human removed his hat and necklace. His face bloated as soon as the clothes left his body. The skin of his face grew weathered, lines etching themselves into his forehead as it turned green. Malik scratched his head, the hair thinning and falling away. His neck thickened up, chin wobbling as fat filled it. He reached out and grabbed the bottle of whiskey, taking a slug. He rubbed his eyes as they became a brilliant blue, a pair of glasses popping into existence on the bridge of his nose. His nose crunched as it grew broader. His teeth thickened, tusks poking up from his lips.<br />
<br />
“Nerves getting to you already?” Zuberi grinned, staring into the aged but handsome orc face across from him, looking completely out of place on a young human’s body.<br />
<br />
“You’re lookin’ kinda handsome all of a sudden.” Malik stared with piggy orc eyes and grunted in a deep voice that sounded almost exactly like Zuberi’s. <br />
<br />
“You too.” Zuberi smirked. <br />
<br />
Malik adjusted his cock, which had grown hard after seeing such a handsome orc. He rubbed the bald spot on his shiny green head. Zuberi smiled, knowing the gesture was one of his ‘tells’ that he did when he needed some luck.<br />
<br />
The game continued. Malik lost another hand. Zuberi grinned and gestured at the human’s shirt.<br />
<br />
With a grunt, Malik lifted it away, revealing large, hairy pecs and a set of nice abs. He moaned, feeling a pressure in his stomach, and realized he was straining to suck in his gut. With a sigh, Malik relaxed his muscles. His skin started to stretch as it filled up with soft, warm fat, and Malik felt the beginnings of relief, but the feeling didn’t stop. His gut continued to grow inches of hard fat towered over his waist in the form of a pot belly. <br />
<br />
Malik blushed purple as he stared down at himself and gave his big belly a jiggle. He wasn’t sure if he could meet Zuberi’s eyes. Hadn’t he just boasted of his great figure? And yet here he was with a belly that rivaled the obese orc’s. <br />
<br />
A soft green hand rested on his new gut and gently squished it. Malik groaned, cock thumping against his underbelly. He looked up into Zuberi’s handsome blue eyes and relaxed. There was nothing but acceptance there. Malik moaned and let the orc rub his gut, wondering why he’d been so embarrassed. He’d always had a gut, right?<br />
<br />
As he gave in to the gently, pleasurable rubs, his hairy pecs began to sag and fill with fat until moobs lay on top of his huge gut. His arms shortened and became flabby and a double chin wobbled into existence as it rounded out his neck. A wave of green pigmentation swept across his body. His belly grew even larger, gently pushing him away from the table until it was as large as Zuberi’s. The orc-which was what he was, now, aside from his limbs- adjusted himself in his seat, his throbbing.<br />
<br />
“Feeling better?” Zuberi asked.<br />
<br />
Malik nodded silently. His stomach grumbled and he reached for the bag of chips that Zuberi held out for him, as though he knew what the new orc craved. Pickle flavored, the package read. Though what a pickle was eluded the new orc. Some delightfully sour and salty thing, he supposed.<br />
<br />
“That hits the spot.” Malik smiled happily, rubbing his rotund gut. “For some reason, I was positively famished.”<br />
<br />
Two more hands and two more losses.<br />
<br />
Malik grumbled and shuck his boots and pants. The muscles and bones in his legs creaked as they shortened and thickened to fat. He scratched and itched the top of his feet as dense black body hair covered his body. He grunted as his skin turned green and then darkened. Everything turned gray and began to sag as years started to pile on him. He wiped his brow with a heavy green hand, feeling hot and sweaty.<br />
<br />
He absentmindedly scratched his chest hair and used Mage Hand to shovel chips into his maw. <br />
<br />
Zuberi smiled, feeling a connection forming to Malik and stroked his cock. The New God, Marcus, had given him a chance to become as powerful as his allies. He’d been pissed when he couldn’t do anything, one-shotted by some mook back in the alleyway. Everyone else had something that let them deal with threats. <br />
<br />
Marcus had told him his gift would double his powers, but he hadn’t thought the god was being literal. He would have preferred a massive power boost, but cloning himself was also great. Distantly, he knew Malik was just a dumb human kid, but new memories were telling him otherwise. That he’d always been a clone of Zuberi and only used the name ‘Malik’ as a way to explain his presence to others. The cover story was that they were identical twins.<br />
<br />
Malik was struggling with his underwear. They were so tight and constraining! He wanted desperately to stroke his dick. The sight of the incredibly handsome orc across from him was working Malik into a frenzy. There was a strange, hollow feeling of incompleteness inside him. New memories were assaulting him. Instead of playing for something silly like being able to leave the ship, they were playing for who would become the Prime Zuberi. They were on their last hand.<br />
<br />
“I’ll win this one.” Malik grinned.<br />
<br />
“You’ve been saying that and yet you’re down to your underwear. Speaking of…” Zuberi slid his own undergarments off and began openly stroking his huge green cock.<br />
<br />
Malik gulped as he watched the orc across from him lean back, exposing his beautifully thick, dark green dick. A large green hand stroked the large head where it stuck out form the fat-pad, gently coaxing a dollop of pre from it and bringing it to the old orc’s lips. Zuberi licked his finger clean with a smile and winked at Malik.<br />
<br />
The former human glanced down at himself and saw only his huge gut. He leaned back and felt himself through his underwear. Puny, lost in the fat that encircled it, the tip slick with pre. How could he ever be the Prime with a cock so pitifully small?<br />
<br />
Malik removed his underwear, sliding down his chubby legs and kicking them away into a corner. His duplicate smiled. Memories came to him of using Time Displacement magic to make another version of himself. The only drawback was that they would both become older, but they didn’t mind that one bit. Who wouldn’t want to become a hot, old bearish orc like him? At first, it was hard to adjust being two separate being but one orc in mind. Marcus helped make the bond between them stronger than ever before. A HUD system appeared in his sight. <br />
<br />
He turned and saw himself in the reflection of one of the dark game screens. He was naked, green skin glistening with sweat, his bald dome reflecting the lights above him. His jowls jiggles as he craned his neck to see himself. He slapped them lightly, feeling the hard fat wobble. He turned to Zuberi and Malik saw the dice of fate above his clone’s head and realized this was exactly what he was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
“I fold,” Malik said, letting himself lose. <br />
<br />
<br />
The last of his skin turned green and his cock pulsed in anticipation. It started to grow, bloating up to the thickness of a soda can. His balls grew heavy, descending down his thigh, feeling sore and bloated. He felt a soft-skinned green hand take hold of his dick. Prime Zuberi’s strokes are gentle but firm, rubbing him in the way that Zuberi loved. The clone leaned back and groaned happily, noting the Prime’s erect cock.<br />
<br />
“I knew I’d win sooner or later.” Prime Zuberi spoke.<br />
<br />
Clone Zuberi smiled and lazily reached over and took his Prime’s cock in hand, stroking him slowly. The idea of not being a real person, just a very hot, bearish clone of an orc wizard was strangely arousing. There was nothing to tell them apart now. Zuberi was him and he was Zuberi. His balls pulsed and the last of his human cum dribbled onto the floor. <br />
<br />
They began stroking each other with increased eagerness. It was like they were in sync, each stroke was like stroking their own dick-a double stroke. Time seemed to slow down for them as the pleasure reached a crescendo. With a roar, they both came in unison. Cum splattered the underside of their guts.<br />
<br />
“Looks like I won this time. I make a great adversary.” Prime Zuberi smiled.<br />
<br />
“I wanna see us together.” Zuberi said gruffly.<br />
<br />
Both Zuberi’s walked over to the mirror and viewed their bodies. They both grinned, loving the big, hairy gut they both sported, firm yet yielding to the touch. One of them stroked their long, salt-and-pepper beard while the other rubbed their bald head.<br />
<br />
“Woof!” Prime Zuberi told his clone.<br />
<br />
Zuberi grinned tuskily and winked. “If you like me so much, why don’t you fuck yourself?”<br />
<br />
“That was the plan.” Prime Zuberi smirked.<br />
<br />
The kissed, tongues wrestling between tusks. The clone moaned, cock spurting precum excitedly as Prime bore him to the floor. Slicking his hand with precum, the other orc bent down and began sucking the clone off. Clone Zuberi moaned.<br />
<br />
Prime prodded the Clone’s asshole. Then he quickly stuffed a fat finger into the old orc’s used hole. The clone groaned as the Prime began knuckling his prostate, milking him.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long for him to erupt into the orc’s loving maw. They traded places. Clone Zuberi sucked down a load of his self’s cum and grinned happily.<br />
<br />
As they finished exploring each other, time came to a stop around them. The world was dead silent. Then came a blinding glowing light that filled the room for a second before a divinely handsome elf appeared in the middle of the room. He regarded both of the orcs with a smile.<br />
<br />
“I see you two are enjoying the boon I give you.” Marcus walked around them, inspecting them in fascination.<br />
<br />
“Thanks you I have twice the power!” Prime Zuberi laughed.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I can compete with the others now. And maybe I can convince Rashid to take us both at once.” Clone Zuberi grinned.<br />
<br />
They both laughed. Marcus’ garment could hardly hide his arousal. Though Prime Zuberi might think otherwise, both orcs were charming in their own ways.<br />
<br />
“You might have double the power but you’re still not on par with the others.” Marcus said, turning so they wouldn’t see his tenting erection. “You’ll need to find a powerful artifact. The Watch of Time.”<br />
<br />
“The Watch of Time?” Both orcs asked in unison.<br />
<br />
“Yes. With the watch of time, any Chronomancy you perform would be child’s play.” Marcus nodded sagely.<br />
<br />
“Oh mighty god, where may we find this marvelous artifact?” Prime Zuberi asked, intrigued.<br />
<br />
“It is in the possession of another traveler like you and your friends. Cherish your gift, as I will give the others their gifts as well. Use them smartly.” Marcus stepped back into the light and vanished.<br />
<br />
Prime and Clone stared at the empty spot where Marcus had stood. Time resumed, and they were both assaulted by sounds. They took a moment to collect themselves.<br />
<br />
“In another traveler’s possession.” Prime Zuberi mused.<br />
<br />
“May I make a suggestion?” Clone Zuberi asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
“When we go to check on the Corsairs, you stay on the ship while I go with them.” Clone Zuberi said.<br />
<br />
“Of course.” Prime Zuberi grinned tuskily. “But when you get back, let’s being Salim into our game, okay?”<br />
<br />
“Deal.” Clone Zuberi grinned, eager for a three way.</p>
