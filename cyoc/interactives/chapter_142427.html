<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Detective Cathy Bond found herself moving towards the one place she&#39;d never imagined ever going to willingly. Well, to be honest, it wasn&#39;t entirely her own choice. But considering the changes that had been happening to the police department since Chief Benson Burlington took over,  she had to come here. Her career, and possibly more,  depended on it.<br />
<br />
The new chief had been quietly nut systematically removing any and all gay officers from the force. Not simply firing them, but somehow making them vanish completely. No one seemed notice they were gone, nevermind that each had been replaced by an openly and proudly heterosexual cop.<br />
<br />
 Cathy had been away on medical leave, due to a serious on-duty injury, but her instincts as a detective had caught on to the departmental changes immediately. A little more digging had turned up each vanishing had occurred after meeting privately with the Chief and his wife (whose presence as one of his subordinates was another red flag in her book).<br />
<br />
 Still, she might&#39;ve kept her head down and gathered more proof of this illegal activity to turn over to the higher-ups, had she not gotten a call from an anonymous man. What he said chilled her to the bone...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
&quot;Detective Cathy Bond. We know your secret. The one thing you&#39;ve hidden from your fellow cops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy had stayed quiet, not wanting to give this bastard any satisfaction. She thought for a moment she recognized the voice, but wasn&#39;t entirely sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;The silent act will change nothing, Detective. We have photographic roof, and we won&#39;t hesitate to share with your colleagues...&quot;<br />
<br />
She could read a big &#39;If&#39; at the end of that sentence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some records from your case log. Bring them to us and your secret remains safe. Refuse and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O..Okay. I understand. What files?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All of the files you&#39;ve have on the Gustav family, Every last note and scrap of paper you&#39;ve gathered. Make sure you bring everything or else we&#39;ll have to make an anonymous call to your Chief..&quot;<br />
<br />
The pause before her response was palpable. The requested files seemed to click something in her memory, She knew who she was speaking to now, and how serious he could be.<br />
<br />
&quot;...okay, Tanjiro. But how do I know you won&#39;t double cross me once you get what you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I&#39;m a man of my word, Dyke-tective Bond. Bring the material this evening at 6 to the Gustav estate. Don&#39;t be late.&quot; <br />
<br />
There was a click and the man was gone.Standing there and holding the receiver, Cathy grit her teeth, not happy that she&#39;d been found out by the Gustavs.  Part of her knew it was a bind of her own making, but it still infuriated her Of course, she had no way of knowing that a certain curse had also be given to her courtesy of her caller&#39;s insult..<br />
<br />
Grabbing her coat, Cathy headed out. Getting to her desk was easy enough, as was getting the requested materials. She also managed to get out of the station without encountering the Chief. Now came the hard part.<br />
<br />
As she drove the meeting, the detective reviewed mentally how she&#39;d gotten to this point.  She had hidden that she was a lesbian since leaving the academy. The plan had been to try to avoid increasing the already high hurdles she&#39;d be facing as a woman trying to rise in the ranks of the department. She&#39;d planned to come out once she made detective, but the moment never seemed right or safe.  However, now the truth had been found out by one of the city&#39;s more infamous crime families, and they&#39;d put her right over a barrel with it. <br />
<br />
Perhaps if the current situation with the Chief hadn&#39;t spooked her so badly, she might&#39;ve just gone public with her homosexuality. But as it was, that option possibly held more risk to her. <br />
<br />
However, despite all of this, Cathy had one ace in the hole. It was sooner than expected but the situation seemed to warrant it. All it had taken was a few taps on her smartphone and a digital copy of the information on both the Gustavs and what was happening in the department was on its way to an investigative reporter by the name of Neil Fox.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, if things went badly, the truth would still get out there...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Cathy pulled up in front of the Gustav estate. It was a somber affair on the outisde, truth be told. A restored neo classical manor with pillars, it seemed to belie the tastes of its owner, Don Marion Gustav&#39;s tastes. <br />
<br />
As she exited the car, Don Gustav&#39;s right hand man and chief fixer, Tanjiro, was there to greet her. How exactly a Japanese criminal rose such prominence in an Italian crime family was a mystery, but most chalked it up to the man&#39;s utter efficiency in solving any problem his boss put before him. Of course, none of that explained the nickname he had. &#39;Uncle Sleazy&#39; seemed an inaccurate description, if you&#39;d never met him in person and only knew his reputation. <br />
<br />
&#39;So glad you decided to join us, Detective Bond.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your invitation was hardly something I could refuse, Tanjiro.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was impatient, not really comfortable with the look the fixer was giving her. Dressed in a plain manner with a dark blue pants suit and comfortable black flats, Cathy didn&#39;t cut a overly sexy figure. Her bust was modest, and her ass was hardly curvy at all. This was coupled with shortly cut brown hair and hardly any make-up, all part of a deliberate effort to avoid attracting unwanted attention from her male colleagues at the station. But somehow, this guy&#39;s gaze was...frankly speaking sleazy. <br />
<br />
&quot;This way, detective. The boss will see you in his office. Right at the staircase, down the hall. The last door on the right.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded at the direction and walked into the manor past the leering Japanese gangster. The walk didn&#39;t take too long, but did allow her to hear Gustav&#39;s daughter and her boyfriend trying to sneak upstairs. Cathy idly wondered if the guy was one of her father&#39;s flunkies or an outsider as she knocked on a heavy oak door.<br />
<br />
A voice with a heavy Boston accent told her to come in and have a seat. She complied, but had to hold back a slight gasp at the sight of the crime boss&#39; office....<br />
<br />
All along the wood-paneled walls were marble busts of naked women, that were big chested and presenting the goods to any passerby. Cathy gulped down her gasp and started to walk towards the plush chair in front of the massive oak desk of Don Gustav, whose own seat was turned away from her. He seemed to be on the phone. However, she was not able to suppress the slight tingle of arousal the sight caused in her, triggering the &#39;were breeder&#39; curse she&#39;d been harboring since the phone call earlier....<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
On the desk of the Italian-American crime boss, a new picture frame was rising up out of the wood. As glass covered it, the image of the Don himself could be seen dressed in a tuxedo, his arm around a  beautiful blonde woman in a wedding dress. Next to this, a box of pre-cut Cuban cigars appeared, turned towards the visitor&#39;s seat. <br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, the curse began to work on reshaping her shoes into something more suitable for the woman was to become. The black flats crunched slightly as tall heels pushed out of the back of their soles, With each clack of the heels, the inky darkness gave way to a deep maroon. The finished pumps caused Cathy to adjust her posture making her stand taller.  <br />
<br />
Next to be transformed were her slacks. The two legs fused together and began to steadily crawl upwards, the blue turning maroon. In the process, they revealed that the detective&#39;s legs had become much more toned and shapely, as her socks had becoming sheer stockings that shimmered slightly which each step. The developing skirt stopped just above her knees, where the stockings clipped into a garter belt that now hung there. <br />
<br />
For a moment,  Cathy paused in her walking, her hands unconsciously adjusting her skirt which had been pulled tight by the swelling of her buttocks and thighs. The rounding of her butt pulled her panties in between the cheeks, transforming them into a black thong. There was a slight crack from the small of her back that caused her new ass to jut out a bit further. This adjustment rippled up her spine and raised her height by several inches. As she again strode towards the plush chair, there was a definite sway from her hips.<br />
<br />
Inside her head, there was now a flood of new information that served to jumble up her memories. Somewhere in this chaos, the part of her that had been afraid fell away, replaced with a growing confidence. After all, she&#39;d requested this meeting, hadn&#39;t she? Another part of her said that wasn&#39;t right at all, but a sultry voice with a thick Russian accent quieted the doubt with a single authorativ &quot;Nyet&quot;. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, some of the maroon had jumped from her skirt onto her fingernails, which grew longer and almost claw-like as polish spread over them. As she instinctively caressed the top of the chair, her hands popped and cracked as her fingers thinned a bit, leaving them delicate but strong. Coming around to its front, Cathy sat down in the chair, crossing her sexy legs confidently even as the velvet fabric of the chair seemed to mould itself to her thick ass. <br />
<br />
As she sat there waiting for Don Gustav to turn around, the curse rapidly worked its power on her blazer. Maroon spread across its surface, even as its cut was being altered to hug her torso closely. The two black buttons on its front turned gold, and then tripled in number. The wide lapels narrowed a bit while the shoulders broadened with padding. Underneath, her blouse was struggling to remain in view. But it was a fruitless struggle as buttons popped off in response to a surge of growth from her chest. Her breasts seemed to gurgle as they swelled up larger, pushing the now buttoned up blazer outwards to afford an unobstructed view of her bountiful cleavage.  <br />
<br />
A sudden need for a smoke washed over Cathy, which something she&#39;d never felt before. It surprised her greatly, as tobacco smoke always caused her cough, even if it was second-hand.  Before she knew it, she was leaning forward in a perfect arch to grab an already cut cigar from the open box on the desk with her finely manicured left hand and bring it up to her now thickening lips. Her right hand had fished out her detective&#39;s badge from a pocket in her jacket. In the time it took to bring it up towards her face,  it had twisted itself into a golden zippo lighter with a red star on its side. Her right thumb flicked the flint with the ease of a pro and lit the cigar.  Unconsciously, she found herself taking a long drag on the cigar, some of the sweet smoke floating out her mouth. There was no coughing, which should&#39;ve frightened her but a sudden rush of pleasure wiped that particular reaction from her memory.<br />
<br />
With each puff of the cigar, old memories drifted away, replaced by new ones. Her career as a police officer disappeared into smoke, as a new life as a member of the Russian Mafia became visible. She&#39;d been recruited out of the military, one of the few women that the Mafiyah bosses allowed into the organization. Of course, she had to work harder than the men around her, but she relished that challenge with a passion she&#39;d never had before. The things she did to get ahead were repulsive to the fading Cathy, especially having sex with men. However that revulsion seemed to weaken as quickly as it had sprung up, replaced by a lust for carnal pleasure with opposite sex. After all, what use was it to her advancement if she couldn&#39;t seduce her rivals...<br />
<br />
Now from the top of her head, a wave of blonde was washing downwards. Its descent also caused sudden growth in her hair, which now flowed over the wide shoulders of her jacket. An unseen force pulled some of it into a loose ponytail, which caused two long locks to settle in front of her pierced ears. As this was happening, the detective&#39;s face was being change. Cheekbones rose up, as her nose narrowed. Eyebrows were plucked into perfect arches.  Her brown eyes blinked themselves into a dazzling blue.   <br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, the police detective&#39;s car had pulled itself into an unoccupied garage. Its transformation was beginning to buckle and warp its shape. The compact car began to stretch longer, the red paint fading to a neutral grey. Its clear windows became opaque with tinting, indicating its owner desired anonymity and privacy during their travel. The now concealed interior was a sea of rich leather. Worn tires renewed themselves as the luxury sedan finished forming. The final touch was the appearance of vanity plates that read &quot;Queen&quot;...<br />
<br />
=======<br />
<br />
There was a squeak from across the desk as Don Gustav finally swung his chair around to address his &#39;guest&#39;. His eyes initially widened in shock at the sight of the sexy blonde in maroon smoking a cigar.   He was pretty sure this wasn&#39;t the lady he expected but before he could act on this thought, reality changed again. Around his ring finger, a wedding band curled itself into existence, with its twin appearing on the mystery woman&#39;s finger. Marion blinked once, then twice as new memories informed of who this was before him...<br />
<br />
&quot;Caterina?&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of that name seemed to be the final piece of the puzzle for the woman who&#39;d once been Detective Cathy Bond. She smiled, her cigar clenched in her prefect white teeth. She was the second wife of Don Marion Gustav, Caterina Bolshoi. Originally, she&#39;d been sent as a spy by her Mafyiah superiors, but something else had blossomed between the two of them. Here was a man worth of her love and loyalty. He listened to her advice on things and was treated as a full partner in his criminal doings. Which was unlike those bastards back in Moscow. <br />
<br />
That he hadn&#39;t even been mad when she confessed the real reason she&#39;d come into his life clinched it. She cut ties with her old organization, bringing along only her most trusted men to bolster the ranks of the Gustav family. Of course, when he eventually proposed, she&#39;d said yes. Their wedding day had been a glorious day, and she&#39;d taken her rightful place as his consigliere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Da, Marion. I am back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby, it&#39;s like you wuz gone forevah&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nyet, my dahling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caterina Bolshoi-Gustav said those last words as she crawled across the desk to deeply kiss her husband. The crime boss put a hand on her massive right breast.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s about I show ya&#39; how much I missed ya&#39;...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vonderful...&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, the curse had claimed another victim. </p>
