<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dylan Spence&#39;s heart was pounding in his chest what had to be a mile a minute, he guessed. If you asked him a month ago if he ever thought he&#39;d be thirstily kissing and making out with Allison, one of the most beautiful and popular girls around campus, he would&#39;ve bitterly laughed and asked if you were joking. Joking indeed. All Dylan could think was that this had to be some prank. Some sort of...of dream! Here he was! Making out with Allison, his cock hard as a rock in his pants. And...fuck. He could feel himself even leaking a little bit. He blushed at that - he didn&#39;t want to come too soon, that&#39;d be majorly uncool.<br />
<br />
Let alone cum from just...just kissing her like this. He needed...needed to get himself de-escalated. Was she really gonna touch him? Dylan breathed and separated momentarily from her as she lightly kissed his cheek, her hand moving and feeling his chest and stomach. Dylan knew well enough that even with his body muscled up more, looking better and more fit, he was still heftier than most guys and not in the kind of movie star shape women seemed to prefer in the guys they went out with.<br />
<br />
But as Allison felt up his stomach and chest, she didn&#39;t seem to mind his heftier build. If anything she seemed to appreciate how unconventional his body was by comparison. &quot;Shirt off...&quot; She moaned under her breath, and Dylan gulped. He knew where this was going to go before too long. But he didn&#39;t want to disappoint her. He wanted to help her, to do what he could to please her. So he went ahead and straightened up and took his shirt off.<br />
<br />
He heard her make a light gasping noise when she saw him - a noise Dylan had never thought a woman would make when he took his shirt off. She moved in again and started touching his broad shoulders first, his chair tilting with the way they were moving in it. He spoke, &quot;I err...maybe...maybe we should move away from the computers and stuff...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right...mm, let&#39;s go to the couch.&quot; Allison answered, still heady with desire. She knew on some level she shouldn&#39;t be fucking around like this. But she also felt desperate, rather frightened and astonished by what was going on with the guys at school, and unsure about the future. She needed something like this to keep her head in it. To provide her with some comfort after some of the freakiest highs and lows of any high school.<br />
<br />
Dylan, shirtless and shivering, led the way over toward the couch downstairs, large enough to accommodate he and Allison&#39;s perspective tryst. The stocky young man watched her remove her shirt and fought down an immediate aroused response. He&#39;d let her lead the way rather than assert himself right now. She was the one instigating the encounter. He leaned back on the couch as Allison pressed herself against him, kissing his neck while her hands felt his stomach and chest - roughly palming his broad chest and powerful shoulders - and pressing her own groin against his.<br />
<br />
Dylan groaned and felt himself involuntarily thrust. He thought about the least sexy things possible, trying to fight off an early emission. He was so inexperienced though, and he was not very good at kissing either - the time he tried to kiss her being very sloppy. Though Allison didn&#39;t seem to mind too much. She just told him &quot;You&#39;re so adorable&quot;, and led the way on kissing him back. Dylan&#39;s blush resurfacing. He didn&#39;t even know where to go from here. Could he...could he...?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I...&quot; Dylan groaned. He looked at her. She seemed so into this. But he remembered what went on earlier, and who she was with. Dylan didn&#39;t want to do something they&#39;d regret. And he didn&#39;t want the girl he liked to regret things about this. As hard as Dylan was right now, and as much as he&#39;d love to thrust that organ he never got to use with a girl before into her...he just couldn&#39;t let her run right ahead into this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allison...are...are you sure this is what you want?&quot; Dylan said, managing to calm himself down. She kept touching him, kept rubbing him, in ways that excited all this new testosterone running in his body. Made him want to just strip down and press his cock in there. But he couldn&#39;t just do that now. Not when she was obviously distressed and acting on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dylan...please...&quot; Allison murmured. &quot;I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure this is what you want?&quot; Dylan breathed and looked her in the eyes, &quot;I mean, I don&#39;t want you to make any mistakes here. I&#39;m not gonna sit here and fuck you and ruin your relationship. Just...are you completely sure about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison was touched by Dylan’s sentiment. He was offering her control over something in a life that seemed to be full of change and upheaval. Yet she was so…well, excited…<br />
<br />
She blurted, “Yes, Dylan, take me, take me now!”<br />
<br />
With that, Dylan’s inhibitions went out the window. He took off his glasses, then pulled Allison down onto the couch, at which she giggled. He unfastened her bra clumsily, while she expertly ripped off his pants and underwear.<br />
<br />
Dylan just let his body take over. He’d never done this before, but he seemed to move on autopilot, like an expert. He moaned as Allison gave him one of her signature blowjobs, then they changed positions and he thrust himself deep into her, finally shooting a massive load.<br />
<br />
Breathing hard, he felt Allison tug at him a little. He rolled over and smiled.<br />
<br />
Allison had noticed that Dylan looked even more different. He had sharper features and more definition to his muscles. But before she could say anything, he grinned and said, “We’re you satisfied?”<br />
<br />
Panting, she said “Oh, yes,” and decided to wait to reveal the truth.</p>
