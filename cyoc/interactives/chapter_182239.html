<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Then Lina saw Lucy enter the room, her long legs slightly spread out as she walked, then she let out a yawn and stretched her arms up over her head &quot;morning all&quot; yawned Lucy, getting a chorus of good mornings in reply as she lay down next to Lina and Viki &quot;good morning lovers&quot; said Lucy, Lina simply lay her head on Lucy&#39;s sholder, gently stroking her fur, Viki on the other side of Lucy was doing the exact same, their eyes closed as they enjoyed eachothers company.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are sweetheart&quot; came Sofias voice as she hopped into the lounge, she was now looking at Misty who now removed herself from Martha&#39;s teat and bounded up to her mother, Sofia laughed, &quot;still hungry were you baby?&quot; She asked Misty, who nodded in reply, everyone chuckled, no matter how much anyone tried that little girl just refused to talk, this caused Lina to turn to her swolen underbelly, the fur on its surface retreating to reveal its translucent surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you girls get any ideas&quot; she whispered to her swolen womb as she bend her torso down to kiss its surface, her fur then returning over its surface lime a blanket as she petted her belly getting a few lazy kicks in reply, then she saw a hand and a black paw on her belly, looking up she saw that both Viki and Lucy were now hugging around her large exercise ball of a belly, then everyone herd a loud beeping, and warning lights began flashing red on the walls &quot;WARNING: hord detected and closing fast, fifty meters and closing, aerial and ground troops detected, brace for impact and prepair for combat&quot; came Alice&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
The first one to take off was Sofia, Misty was tucked away in her pouch with her torso poking out of the top, her hands and paws peaking over the top, Sofia began bounding at high speed, her tail up I the air to balance her body as her strong back legs propelled her forward and out into the command car, Lina and Viki were next, despite their sizes they both moved with surprising speed and grace, Vikis black tiger body moving with impressive agility and Linas bear half was almost at full galop as she followed behind and Lucy&#39;s long legs galloping over her head, her long legs giving her the ability to traverse more ground than Linas shorter pawed legs.<br />
<br />
When they entered the command car Linas face whent pale, in the distance was what looked like a sizable swarm of locusts, but with a blue glow to them, heading directly towards them, then Lina grimised as her womb began to stretch and wriggle as her children trashed within her, it was her, or at least an extension of her, then the swarm surrounded a single point, creating a ball of black and blue.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Lina saw her , a woman dressed in a green toga, her hair was blonde, tied back in a ponytail that ran down to her feet, her eyes were glowing white, sparking with power, various plants were grown along her neck and arms, and a large pair of antlers emerged from the top of her head she had her arms outstretched towards the train, she had golden thread on her silk sleeves that were shaped into the outline of deer and various other creatures, but her feet were not there, only a long tail like that of a genie made of brown mist, creating a type of twister as the hord of the hive queen&#39;s flying troops spiraled around her, then tendrals of brown mist struck the train from her hand, and Lina felt something pass through them, it was cold, cruel and controlling, this feeling seemed to pass through everyone because each person gave a slight shiver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warning: multiple entities have appeared on my senior abord the vessel, identity code: unknown, locations: cars two to ten&quot; said Alice, Sofia had a confused look on her face &quot;but that would be everyone abord, cart two was where Martha Mazy and the lamia girl were&quot; she said as they all slowly turned to a hissing sound coming from the connecting hallway between the command and lounge cars &quot;eniciating lockdown protocol&quot; said Alice as they all saw the lamia girl luge towards them, her eyes now glowing white as a large metal shutters came down infront of her, a loud thud came a few seconds later from her impact<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s one of our sisters, the sister of the wilds&quot; came Echos voice as a small green mist snake emerged from Linas palm and coiled around her forearm &quot;she controlls all creatures instincts, keeps balance in the food chain and controls their breeding seasons&quot; she said with a hiss, then Lina raised an eyebrow at the little snake &quot;young ladies do not hiss, no matter what, understand?&quot; She said, no matter what the situation she was determined to keep her children an the right path, &quot;yes mommy&quot; came Echos small voice in reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;So if she&#39;s now controlling everyone abord the train, why are we all fine&quot; Asked Lucy as she bent down to look at Echos small mist snake, then a small six winged bird flew from linas other palm, a trail of white mist following behind it as it perched on Lucy&#39;s sholder &quot;that would be me, she may control you lot but she&#39;s in the sky, my domain and I&#39;m not one for shairing my sacred charge&quot; came Storms angry voice, her white mist feathers puffing up as she turned to look at her corrupted sister outside<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother with your permission, may I try and knock some sense into my sister?&quot; She said as she fluttered over to Lina, snuggling into the nook of her neck, Lina stroked along the small mist  burst feathers, then took a deep breath &quot;fine, but promise me you will be ok and come back&quot; she said with tears in her eyes, Storm then began to seep through the trains walls &quot;I promise mother&quot; she said, then thunder boomed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You overstep your bounds dear sister&quot; came Storms voice, it was all around them, and shook through everyone like thunder &quot;you come into MY territory, try to control beings under MY protection and what&#39;s worse, go after MY MOTHERS!?&quot; She roared, dark grey clouds began to spiral around the train and the sister, Lightning flashed within the storm clouds, then behind the sister, a giant blue eye emerged &quot;if you are of your right mind you will pay dearly for your actions&quot; she roared as her giant bird form emerged from the clouds, its body now grey like the surrounding storm, Lightning striking the sister and her mighty wings creating hurricane winds around them, terenchal rain began to hammer the windscreen of the train, dimming everyone&#39;s visibility, only cryes, screeches and roaring could be herd over the booking thunder and the crash of the lightning.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when the train entered the eye of the storm, the sisters white eyes remained fixed on the train, not leaving it for a second, even as lightning struck her and left her arms burnt, she remained focused on the train above, then a giant bird claw struck out from the cloud line, then it stoped, held in place by the sisters hand, then her swarm of insect like people began to swarm up Storms mist body now no longer hidden in the cloud line and they then began clawing at her mist, leaving blue gashes along her legs, then a large white wing extended out towards the train, and all hell broke loose.<br />
<br />
Lina felt a large surge of energy from her womb as two more balls of mist appeared, as well as Echos snake turning into a ball to join them as they passed through the train walls, then a large shadow covered the train, plumes of green mist could be seen through the windows, and that&#39;s when everyone saw them<br />
<br />
First was a creature everyone was all too familiar with, a large frill neck lizard made of sand like mist came barrelling down Storms wing and lunged at the swarm, bursts of energy could be seen emitting from its frill, but instead of feeling fear from this creature of sand, Lina felt pride, that was her daughter, helping her sister and now once again in full controll, then Lina saw a large jet of pink mist emerge from Ava&#39;s back, and a massive black scorpion emerged, its claws made of the same pink mist, its tail stinger decorated with bones, Lina guessed that was Sarah, Avas twin, now fighting off the hord side by side, and finally Echos form lept from the train.<br />
<br />
She was a fifty meter long king cobra, her coils wrapped around the train  as she strick at the sisters grasp on Storms foot, ripping her hand away from her sisters talons, then her form shifted into a thick and strong boa constrictor, and she began to coil around the sister, sqeezing her tighter and tighter, lightning continued to strike the crazed sister, the bolts passing through Echos mist body and striking the sister of the wilds, Sarah&#39;s stinger doing the same as Storms bolts, injecting a sleeping agent into the sister to try and slow her down with each strike and finally Avas energy bursts were hitting Echo, giving her body a yellow glow as her power and strength grew.<br />
<br />
Then at long last something shimmered into existence at the back of the sisters head, it resembled that of a large parasite, its black mass pulsating as blue mist tendrals wrapped around the poor girls head and face, then Sarah&#39;s stinger stuck at it and pulled it off her head, letting the disgusting mass fall to the ground far below, then the storm began to die down as the swarm that had surrounded the sister of the wilds all droped dead at the same time, apparently that parasite was what kept them all alive and without it, they were all just empty husks.<br />
<br />
Then Lina herd her daughters speak to everyone &quot;mothers, what do you want us to do with our sister&quot; Asked Storm &quot;yeah I mean she could still be infected&quot; came Sarah&#39;s voice from behind Storms large body, a black scorpion could then be seen scuttling over Storms wing to rest on her neck, thes Viki turned to Lina &quot;we can&#39;t just leave her to die love, she is one of our daughters siblings&quot; she said &quot;I agree, plus she&#39;s been in the hive, maby she knows the hive queen&#39;s next move&quot; said Lucy, Lina turned to hear Sofias opinion however she already had her goggles on and was hopping around the car for needed repairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok girls........bring her inside&quot;</p>
