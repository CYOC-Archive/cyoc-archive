<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Like most 18 year olds guys, Jeff thought primarily with his penis. Right now, he was especially horny, and having this in front of him didn’t help.<br />
<br />
Jeff lived in a small town and that made the women there relatively average looking, as one may expect. Jeff’s porn tastes were more on the extreme side (he loved bimbos,) and finding a reality altering option, he immediately went to it. Jeff first made only himself aware of the changes before moving on to the menus.<br />
<br />
He found he could adjust “averages.” Clicking in this, he found “Women - aged 18 to 45” and clicked on it. Noting that he had to pick a race before he could view the image, he clicked on “white - non Hispanic or Latino” because that would give him the most options in his tiny town.<br />
<br />
Jeff was shocked to find a fully modeled 3D nude image of a woman that he could adjust and move around. It looked like a real woman, but he knew it wasn’t. The woman was simply too average looking - which is what he expected to find. She was around 25, not horrible looking but nothing to write home about. She was out of shape, had around B cup breasts, and brown hair.<br />
<br />
Jeff also noticed he could pick other races, but the thing that intrigued him the most was a check box. It simply said “apply changes to all.” He selected that and kept it on.<br />
<br />
Now that Jeff had played around with the model on screen, he noticed another option. There was an upload photo section from his computer. There was an option to replace the woman on screen or “merge” the two, with percentages deciding how much it would “lean” to the original or the new picture. <br />
<br />
Jeff being the horny man he was decided to upload a picture of his favorite porn star - Amber Peaks. She was known for having huge fake breasts (her “peaks”) and her extensive body modifications. Amber’s breasts were perky and each were around the size of her head - extreme looking and sexy to Jeff. Amber’s ass was just as extreme, and she really embodied the porn star look Jeff wanted. Her big fake lips were always covered in some kind of sparkling lipstick and just like a porn star usually did she wore a ton of makeup in her videos. The only thing Jeff wasn’t super into was her tattoos - she had one above her ass and one on her back - but he could always remove that later.<br />
<br />
He clicked upload and watched as the woman on screen changed and morphed. In between the average woman and the extreme porn star he’d chosen, the model was now quite a bit hotter, but Jeff wasn’t done.<br />
<br />
He noted the new “average” features. Around F cup breasts, fake looking - much bigger than before, but still not quite what he wanted. The hair on the model had more volume than before, which was nice. The woman’s lips were puffier and had some lipstick on them - in fact, the model’s face had significant more makeup on. Jeff noted that the expression on the model’s face was a bit more lustful, the eyes almost seeming like “fuck me” eyes. The model’s rear was more impressive than it had been, as were her hips, but it still wasn’t what Jeff wanted. <br />
<br />
He slid the slider from the 50% middle to 80% favoring the image of Amber. He watched as the model on screen became even more sexed up, her lips puffing up further, her breasts growing to J cups, her ass expanding even more. This was more of what he was thinking.<br />
<br />
However, now, Jeff could fine tune. He decided to grow the breasts even bigger, to around M cups, noting the surgery scars. “Hmmmmm, let’s make those all natural but fake looking.” He said, watching as those scars disappeared. He applied the same for any other “body modifications,” which turned him on even more because knowing that these attributes could occur naturally now was really hot. He added in a clause that the weight of the breasts wouldn’t be detrimental to any women, instead stating that women in town had developed stronger back muscles specifically for carrying them. He noticed some tattoos and clicked a “remove all” button. He made the hair even better looking, long and silky. He changed the nails next, realizing that the girls would probably end up being bisexual if he was applying porn logic, and made all of the nails long except for the pointer and middle fingers on the right hand. He noticed there was an option for “symmetry” next and applied it, watching as the model’s face became even more perfect, with no difference between the left and right sides. He increased the lip size next, giving her DSLs as big as Amber’s.<br />
<br />
He altered the model’s waist next, pulling it in a bit, as he noticed there was a slider bar for average body shape. He made it a bit more of an hourglass shape before increasing muscle mass and decreasing body fat. The model on the screen now looked like a fitness model porn star hybrid.<br />
<br />
He noticed that there was a personality tab and clicked that one next. To his surprise, it showed the “average” attributes next to the updated ones. Libido had risen pretty significantly, as had a tab called “Fitness” Jeff found he could type in some options.<br />
<br />
“Average women love dressing like porn stars.” He typed in, watching as some more attributes changed.<br />
<br />
He smiled before he typed in some more mental changes.<br />
<br />
“The average woman loves her beautiful, sexy body and takes wonderful care of it. It’s almost like a turn on for the average woman to exercise or to dress in a sexy way. Average women love showing off these wonderful bodies.” He typed in, watching as even more attributes changed, including one that was relatively high called vanity.<br />
<br />
He noticed there was an advanced options section and clicked on it. With this, he made some more extreme changes.<br />
<br />
“The makeup women have on is permanent”<br />
<br />
“Breasts don’t sag, it’s normal for them to stick straight up”<br />
<br />
“Sex toys are even more common among women”<br />
<br />
“Women don’t use the bathroom, get pregnant, or have periods anymore”<br />
<br />
“Women don’t age past a certain point. They live forever”<br />
<br />
“Women don’t create body odor like men do, instead smelling sweet and giving off strong pheromones”<br />
<br />
“Women don’t grow body hair”<br />
<br />
“Women are not subject to disease or illness”<br />
<br />
“Women have a porn addiction and love masturbating to women that look like them”<br />
<br />
Jeff, just double checking, decided to check the other models. He clicked on the “Asian woman” model, and noted she had changed just as much - as had all the other models.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled at all the changes and wondered what to do next.</p>
