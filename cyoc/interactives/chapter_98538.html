<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha quietly left the Anderson home with a slight chuckle at William&#39;s joking pronunciation of perfect. It wasn&#39;t a true purr, and more the way humans always imitated one, including Catwoman in the Batman Returns movie. As she made her way out and up the sidewalk to the Twist&#39;s home, she had the good fortune to meet up with Samantha as she pulled her car into the driveway. Samantha did smile to her as she climbed out of her car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you&#39;re looking good,&quot; Samantha smiled to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like it?&quot; Martha asked with a return smile and twirled for Samantha to get a full look at it, &quot;It isn&#39;t super fancy or anything... but it is new and best of all... it can shift with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you went to Awareness,&quot; Samantha chuckled, as she opened her passenger side door to the car and bent in to collect the carry out trays from the diner she had stopped at, &quot;Did you get much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as much as I would have liked,&quot; Martha admitted, &quot;as the prices were higher, probably to make sure the clothing could shift with a were and wouldn&#39;t be super irritating against fur... not to mention the fact that William will need pants, shorts, and underwear that can shift with him too. So, most of what I picked up today for me were bras and underwear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha stood by for a moment as Samantha backed up and was being very careful with a stack of four Styrofoam to-go boxes. Martha caught the scent of beef, pork, and chicken coming from each of them and it smelled very good. In fact the meat smelled better to her than the side dishes that went with it. It made her wonder if her were status would affect her diet in some way. She hadn&#39;t noticed any intolerance to anything that she&#39;d eaten and she was inclined to think that weres didn&#39;t have that sort of issue, as both Frances and Samantha had eaten french fries at lunch as well and didn&#39;t become sick, that she knew of. Maybe as a werecat, while she could still digest everything she could as normal human, her tastes preferred the more carnivorous diet that cats ate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something smells good,&quot; Martha commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it isn&#39;t fancy... but it is good,&quot; Samantha agreed, &quot;and since Frances was stressed by her afternoon... she really wasn&#39;t in the mood for cooking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Martha told her, &quot;We&#39;ll make it up to her tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need any help?&quot; Martha asked, &quot;I can help you carry some of them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you could help with the doors, that would be best,&quot; Samantha answered.<br />
<br />
Martha nodded and shuffled around to shut the car door for Samantha and then to walk toward the Twist family&#39;s front door. As she reached for the door to open it for Samantha, the door opened on its own to reveal Frances standing in the doorway. Martha thought she looked rather refreshed, though she didn&#39;t know just how stressed Frances had been. She brought her hand back and gave a weak smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I was just opening the door for Samantha...&quot; Martha began.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Frances chuckled, &quot;I got up a little while ago and got ready and have been waiting for my lovers to arrive for dinner...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here we are,&quot; Samantha said with a smile, &quot;feeling better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Frances nodded, &quot;a little rest was just what I needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully you&#39;re not too tired for later,&quot; Martha purred to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be up for whatever you and Sam have planned,&quot; Frances purred back, &quot;and by the way... you look good. Is that from Awareness, or something you&#39;ve had hidden in the closet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s from Awareness,&quot; Martha answered with a smile, &quot;along with what&#39;s underneath it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... can&#39;t wait to unwrap you tonight then,&quot; Frances purred again, &quot;but I suppose we&#39;d best have dinner first. I have Ben setting the places.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha and Samantha both nodded as Frances let them enter. Martha noticed that the rose petals that Samantha and Frances had laid down for her transformation into a werecat had been cleaned up and let her lovers lead her into the dining area where Ben was setting the places for them to eat. As they went, Frances then asked Martha on her afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how did your afternoon go?&quot; Frances asked, &quot;Stress free, I hope?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stress free,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;I obviously went shopping and got some things that will fit me better, and William had a productive day in getting the study guides I&#39;ll need for my certification regarding Washington state&#39;s tests and a special test that Moon Lake administers... which I do intend to take, even though elementary teachers aren&#39;t required to take. The guides are all based on last year&#39;s tests... but given what I got from the school, I can always take the test again closer to when the tests are normally administered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;Ben... are the places ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ben answered. &quot;We&#39;re all ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is good,&quot; Samantha spoke up, &quot;as I&#39;ve brought dinner!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Steaks?&quot; Ben asked, sniffing at at the take out boxes.<br />
<br />
Samantha set one of the boxes down at Ben&#39;s place, &quot;one Chicago style steak with a baked potato.&quot; Samantha set another one down at her own place. &quot;Pork-chops with mashed potatoes and gravy.&quot; Samantha continued to walk along and then set the next at Frances&#39;s at the table. &quot;Fried chicken breasts and noddles.&quot; She then moved on to the last place set for Martha. &quot;Your family has only just moved here, and you, Nate, and William have only just joined our society, so I don&#39;t known know what your favorite meal at the diner is, but I did bring one that is good... backed chicken legs and backed potato cubes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Martha smiled while Frances was readying glasses to drink from.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while I was there,&quot; Samantha smiled as she pulled out her cellphone and began flipping through the pictures she had saved and then showed one to Martha. Martha felt herself shed tears of joy at the picture with Julie leaning over a table and in a passionate kiss with her son. She had been afraid that Eric would close himself off from the world, and yet there he was. Julie was healing him and he had to be opening up, and that made her happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re kissing,&quot; Martha smiled, not noticing Ben sitting down to eat while Frances also came to look at the photo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Samantha nodded, &quot;I&#39;d just come in to pick up the orders for tonight when I saw them. Looked very romantic and too cute not to get a picture of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they were getting along?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seemed to be,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;Though... if things keep progressing... he could end up a mer...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If he chooses that, than I will support him,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;I might prefer that he wait until he&#39;s eighteen to actually go through with it... maybe sixteen at the earliest, since that&#39;s when Nate became a werewolf... but the choice will always be Eric&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Samantha nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;They do look good together,&quot; Frances commented, &quot;though it would look like both of them got gravy on their shirts.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of them broke up for a moment and moved to the respective spots at the table and joined Ben in eating. The food smelled good to Martha and it tasted excellent, though for the most part she was more overjoyed at Eric&#39;s relationship turning out so well. Even if he didn&#39;t become a were, things looked very much like being with Julie was good for him in getting away from what made him close himself off from the world. The kiss was passionate, and could be a sign of rapid progression in their relationship and might mean a conversation with both Eric and Julie together, maybe with Martin and Melissa present as well, just to lay down ground rules and make sure that neither Eric nor Julie made a mistake they might regret later, but Martha took it as a sign of her son opening up and having someone who was there for him beyond only his family. The fact that he was enjoying young love also made Martha want to cheer in excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Samantha told me you were stressed by somethings this afternoon,&quot; Martha said after a little while to Frances, &quot;it wasn&#39;t too bad, was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing bad and nothing that I can really get into since I&#39;ll likely be doing Miss Smith&#39;s psych evaluation,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;it&#39;s just things that will mean more work...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to hear all that,&quot; Martha said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;On busy days... these sorts of things happen. It&#39;s no different from a teacher deals with difficult students.&quot;<br />
<br />
That Martha understood. It didn&#39;t happen often, but it did happen. The continued eating for a little more in quiet while thinking of other things to say when Ben then stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re finished?&quot; Samantha asked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ben answered and began to casually undress himself, &quot;I&#39;m going to go for a run, let you three have some time alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben set his clothing down on his chair and then began to transform. Martha couldn&#39;t help but notice the size of his flaccid penis, and in human form, it was roughly the same size as William&#39;s was now in that state. It might be slightly bigger, but not by much, and Martha figured that was simply the difference between male werefoxes and male werewolves. Just as she, Frances, and Samantha  had DD/E cup breasts as werecats while female werefoxes were in the EE/F cup range.<br />
<br />
Ben&#39;s transformation was a bit different than her own or William&#39;s, as Martha watched the young werewolf not only grow taller, but also grow rapidly larger in terms of muscle mass. Every muscle group enlarged as fur coated him and a sheath formed around his penis and held it to his body. His shoulders widened and his pectorals barreled out into a massive chest with arms and biceps to match. Long sharp claws pushed out from his fingertips and toes and his feet began to lengthen and Ben seemed to rise upward into a digitigrade stance. His eyes became a deep amberish gold that looked rather wild while his ears became pointed and migrated to the top of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure you&#39;re full?&quot; Frances asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, mom,&quot; Ben insisted, revealing enlarging teeth as his face pushed forward into a wolven muzzle. It was longer than Martha&#39;s feline muzzle in her werecat form, and was probably comparable with William&#39;s narrow and pointed vulpine muzzle in his werefox form in length, but Ben&#39;s muzzle was broader and wider. Martha thought she heard bones cracking as Ben&#39;s muzzle formed, but he didn&#39;t act as if in pain.<br />
<br />
In the end, Ben clinched his fists and hunched forward as finally a bushy wolf&#39;s tail erupted from his spine above his butt and began to slowly wag behind him. He gave a low growling moan as if holding back a howl in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;You three have a good night,&quot; Ben then said in a lower and more growling voice as he headed for the back door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember it&#39;s a school night!&quot; Frances said to him, &quot;you have your curfew!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, mom,&quot; Ben answered, and was gone into the night air.</p>
