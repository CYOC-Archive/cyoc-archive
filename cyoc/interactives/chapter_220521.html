<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim decided that de-aging the one employee was enough experimentation on them for the moment. He then heard a couple talking on the other side of the room as they entered through the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry, it&#39;s now or never. My biological clock is running down and it&#39;s only going to get harder the longer we wait,&quot; said the woman as she entered. She looked in her late thirties and must have been a beauty at one time. However weight gain, a few strands of gray hair, and clothing that seemed a bit dowdy made her look even older.<br />
<br />
Henry looked about the same age, and looked rather embarrassed as he looked about the restaurant only to lock eyes briefly with Jim before looking elsewhere, &quot;You pick the oddest of times and places, Sally. We can discuss this later. Just put our usual in and we can talk after I get out of the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry then immediately went into the men&#39;s room. Meanwhile Sally went to the order kiosk, put in an order and then sat down and looked unhappy. Jim decided to approach her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; asked Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not really, thank you for asking though,&quot; said Sally and with that Jim hit the minus button hard. Sally&#39;s face grew rapidly softer. The lines vanished and the double chin turned into one. Her grey hair grew dark and longer then much longer. Almost as fast, her breasts seem to up on her body and became firm. Her waist grew thinner and thinner. In a few minutes, the 38 year old woman became a 20 something, and then a college girl and finally a nineteen year old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Henry?&quot; she asked grabbing her pants as she got up before they fell down. She adjusted her belt, but she had grown much too thin and had to use a bobby pin to pull her pants several inches tighter. She had to be careful not to catch her black hair which had changed to a long hippy style down to her waist. Her blouse was baggy and she was having trouble keeping it from sliding off her shoulders. Even her bra was too big and was sliding off her threatening to expose her breasts which were now high and firm.<br />
<br />
&quot;He should have been out by now,&quot; mumbled Sally as she rose and headed towards the men&#39;s room, at first knocking on the door, before entering.<br />
<br />
Sally entered the room barely able to juggle her too large clothes. Everything was much too big. Even her bra didn&#39;t fit well with the straps constantly slipping off her shoulders. Jim followed behind and hid in a corner of the entrance of the men&#39;s room separate from the main area that Sally had walked into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry, where are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim looked below the dividers and saw only one pair of legs in any of the stalls. He hit the stall where Henry was with a dose from the minus button. At the same time he flipped the MENTAL and REALITY switches so that no confusion took place with the changes he was implementing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t I even do this in peace?&quot; said Henry in an oddly changed voice, he said before trying to clear his throat. &quot;I will be right out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim could here Henry trying to get his clothes back on, he looked down to see that the pair of feet were no longer flat on the tile floor, but the heels were beginning to raise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am coming out now.&quot; and with that Henry opened the door. Jim now entered the main area, pretending to be heading towards the sinks. He turned to see Sally welcoming a child of 10 from the stall where Henry had been. The prepubescent Henry was very thin, and was continuing to shrink and youthen. As he moved to leave the stall his pants slipped to the group and he almost tripped over them. He barely held onto his underpants to retain his modesty.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are going to be late for school, Sally, I have to be there! We are learning how to multiply today, but I can&#39;t get my clothes to fit,&quot; said Henry in an increasing higher voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help ya kid,&quot; said Sally, adopting a babysitter like affection for the youthening child.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then we are going to learn our ABCs,&quot; said a much smaller Henry who was regaining baby fat at a rapid rate. He started to have problems walking as he crossed over into toddlerhood. His face became rounder with more and more baby fat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me coming mommy!&quot; exclaimed Henry.<br />
<br />
Henry grew too small for his shirt and it descended to the floor with Henry stepping out where his neck used to be.<br />
<br />
As he approached Sally, Henry was giggling and growing unsteady on his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama, Mama!&quot; cried Henry.<br />
<br />
The two year old half fell and half walked into Sally&#39;s arms. Sally immediately picked him up and began to cuddle.<br />
<br />
&quot;My boy is too little to walkie. He should stay safe in Mommy&#39;s arms,&quot; said Sally as she rocked Henry who appeared to grow lighter and lighter in her arms as he grew younger and younger.<br />
<br />
Jim watched as Henry went further and backwards, he no longer could talk. He merely made baby sounds now. As he shrank, his face grew fat and his belly extended.<br />
<br />
Jim turned off the device. He had given Sally a baby, but didn&#39;t want to make Henry too young. Too big of a push would have had him pop right into Sally&#39;s belly.<br />
<br />
As he watched however, Jim got a major surprise. The device was off, but Henry was continuing to get younger. Sally&#39;s swollen breast had broken free of her baggy clothes and too loose bra and Henry had instinctively began to suckle on it. With each mouthful of milk, Henry was getting smaller and younger With a jolt, Jim realized that the MENTAL and REALITY controls used simultaneously not only changed people&#39;s minds to accept the changes it also altered reality so that these changes could occur without the device. The device had not only youthened Sally and Henry, but had also changed Sally&#39;s breasts into a living fountain of youth Anyone who glanced at her breasts was going on a fast track to childhood, toodlerhood, and helpless infancy.<br />
<br />
Sally broke the connect between herself and the baby. Henry immediately began to fuss. The now tiny 3 month old wanted to be even younger! <br />
<br />
&quot;Not now, Henry. You&#39;ll get more later.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sally then turned the exposed nipple and showed it to Jim.<br />
<br />
With that gesture, Jim&#39;s entire world changed. He wanted it more than anything else. He wanted the years to flow backwards. Teenage awkwardness, boyhood play, childhood innocence, and the growing dependence of infancy was something to look forward to.<br />
<br />
Jim dropped the Chronivac and rushed over and began his trip back to...</p>
