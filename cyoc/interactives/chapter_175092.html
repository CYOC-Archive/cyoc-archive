<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When you managed to both sit up, it was your turn to feel odd. It started in your mouth as suddenly you had a serious craving to lick up all of your girlfriend&#39;s cum. It was so strong that you couldn&#39;t help yourself and began slurping up the numerous globs of cum around the room while your girlfriend watched. You started with yourself, but then quickly moved onto all fours as you started to clean up the floor and walls. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, your girlfriend watched you go about, amused at odd behaviour thinking it was just a new way you were trying in order to make her feel a bit better about becoming a huge walking cock. But at the same time, watching you go about on all fours with your face plastered against the ground was turning her on. So she sat down on the floor in a clean spot and started to use her feet to stroke her shaft, all while her balls were providing her tall shaft enough support to not fall over. She was so preoccupied with her self pleasuring that she hadn&#39;t noticed your body undergoing changes as well. If she had, she would have seen your arms disappear just like hers had, and how your balls blew up in size, turning into a truely large pair of breasts that were no smaller than her balls were, and each topped with their own cute nipple. Your cock had completly vanished as well. <br />
<br />
You were too distracted by how good the cum tasted to notice that you now were pushing your tube shaped upper body along the floor as your new enourmous breasts dragged behind you, leaving a trail of breastmilk in their wake. Nor did you notice how your head had flattened into your neck, creating a large circle. Or how your mouth had become a long verticle slit going from top to bottom, which then shapped itself into a pussy. Your asshoke had become a donut shape and now was prominently sticking out, splitting your now larger, more feminine shapped ass. A tube now connected the depths of your new pussy with your asshole, ensuring all contents poured into your pussy, promptly exited out your asshole before you overflowed. Of course, there was also a small internal reservoir where a small amount of cum could be stored in case you ever wished to become pregnant. But other than for that, anything that entered your pussy, wouldn&#39;t stay in it for long. Even now, most of the cum you were consuming was pouring out of your ass in a slow trickle as you digested some of the contents.<br />
<br />
When you finished the floor, your girlfriend suddenly made a loud moan, and more cum squirted out of her tip and dribbled down her shaft. Hungrily, you pushed your way over and finally got her attention. &quot;Oh my god! I.. how? No... I.. I am so sorry. I never would have guessed that the curse was contagious.&quot; Said your girlfriend, which confused you at first, but made you look over towards the mirror. Seeing your body become essentially a fleshlight with tits and legs made you shudder, and then shudder again, though even harder this time, when you realized that your girlfriend could likely fuck you now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me!&quot; You demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? Fuck you? Do you know how serious this is? You turned into a walking pussy!&quot; Retorted your girlfriend, who sounded upset at your lack of concern, but grew even harded all the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what? I want you to fuck me like the huge pussy I am. I want you to impale me with that sexy thick meat stick. I want your balls to slap my face with each of your thrusts as your cum spilles out all over my body. I can&#39;t think of anything I want more than to be filled by you, I want to have your babies, let them nurse from my tits as you pump gallon after gallon of your delicious cum into my womb and out my asshole.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing your perverted plea, your girlfriend could no longer hold herself back and plunged her face deep with in you if not only to shut you up or risk orgasming again from all of your dirty talk. The two of you fucked like this for hours. At first it was just her pushing and pulling her body in and out of you. But then it turned into you lifting her up in the air and pushing and pulling her in and out of you. Then it became her using her toes to tease your nipples as she used her tip to play with your clit. You ended up cumming over and over and over as gallon after gallon of cum passed through your pussy, into your womb, and out your ass. Finally when it was deep into the night, did you stop fucking from pure exhaustion. You were so tired that your girlfriend didn&#39;t even bother sliding out of you and had just fallen asleep inside of you as the last of her latest load settled down in your womb and slowly trickled out your ass and all over your tits. You could feel her every movement as every single little twitch she made caused you to experience absured ammounts of pleasure.<br />
<br />
While she slept, you had time to ponder what to do next, and what was the current nature of your relationship even? You were the one with all the girl parts in the relationship, so did that make you the girlfriend? And by extention, did that make your girlfriend your boyfriend? Likely. But that was something for you both to discuss whenever she, or maybe he, woke up. Honestly, you no longer even felt like a male. And found it hard to call yourself as anything but a female when you thought about it some more. It surprised you just how little that concept bothered you. You were actually perfectly fine with being female. So much so that it honestly felt natural to be one. Was this the same for your girlfriend/boyfriend? Did they now find that being male was pretty easy to accept and felt natural too? You could only hope as you didn&#39;t want to disturb their sleeping.</p>
