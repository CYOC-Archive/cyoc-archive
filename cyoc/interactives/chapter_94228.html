<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ed was ready to try his new superpower but just like when he was sitting at the computer, he didn&#39;t know what he wanted to do.<br />
<br />
Just then his mom called up to him that dinner was ready. &quot;Coming&quot; he called. Heading down the stairs he heard his family gathered around the table and paused, thinking, &quot;Maybe I can test it at dinner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Edward took two more steps dismissing the thought, &quot;My family would freak and I would be caught.&quot; He paused again recalling that with each transformation, he controls whether or not the world sees it as how its always been.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eddie! Dinners on the table! Come get some before its all gone!&quot; came the call from his mother, prodding Ed out of his contemplation.<br />
<br />
With that Edward decided to test his powers on his family... <br />
<br />
Approaching the table he hugged his mom and gave her a kiss, thanking her for dinner. Then he approached his dad, trying to decide what he wanted to swap or copy. With only a few seconds to decide he noticed his dad&#39;s stubbly face. He shaves throughout the week but lets it grow on the weekend. Ed decided on copying his dad&#39;s beard growth rate, density, and current length, and to transfer it to his mom.<br />
<br />
With that he gave his dad a hug from behind his dad&#39;s chair making sure he made direct skin to skin contact and giving a quick squeeze. While doing so he thought, &quot;I want to steal and transfer to mom my dad&#39;s current beard length and how quickly and dense it grows being the only one to realize that she having a beard and him not able to grow one is not completely normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a final squeeze Ed felt a slight tingle and a disoriented feeling which apparently meant his powers were working. He saw that mom was experiencing a similar feeling &quot;Awesome&quot; he thought as he took his seat at the table. <br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t help but steal a glance at his father, who, in his late thirties had a fair smattering of gray at his temples and in his beard. Ed tried to imagine what he would look like with his dad&#39;s beard and wondered if it would be gray when it grew on his face. That would be weird. He could reinstall the chronivac program to correct any issues or just copy beard color from someone else who has similar hair color to him and is younger than his father... Edwards eyes slowly traced their way to his older brother Jacob, who at 16 was just starting to grow healthy sideburns and something that could almost be called a mustache. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey aren&#39;t you hungry?&quot; Mom had noticed Ed lost in thought having not put any food on his plate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah mom.&quot; Ed started grabbing food while everyone else had already stared eating. Stealing another glance at his father Ed noticed that his dads face looked clean shaven. No, that&#39;s not quite right. Even right after shaving, early in the mornings before school Ed can see a shadow where his dads beard would grow. That was fading away too.<br />
On the other hand, it was mom&#39;s face who started to change. A certain shadow appeared on her cheecks. Taking a better look, Ed saw that is was a real 5&#39;O clock shadow!  <br />
<br />
Ed was excited and scared. Nervously he approached to his mom and casually touched her face and felt that she really was growing a beard. His heart sank to his stomach, then kicked into overdrive. What if his dad and Jacob see? Of course they will see but what if they realize? Well he can reverse it. But what if they are angry or scared of him? Edward thought back... Damn, he forgot to be able to steal or copy memories. If it comes down to it he could copy his age to Jacob then steal 11 years of age making him 1 and Ed would be 23. Then holding Jacob he could touch each of his parents copying Jacobs age to them. That should buy him enough time to reinstall the chronivac and sort things out. Then he could set things right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eddie dear, you&#39;re pale and sweating, are you coming down with something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No mom, it&#39;s everything okay, I&#39;m not hungry&quot; Ed struggled to come up with something plausible quickly.<br />
<br />
A couple days of beard growth had appeared on his mom&#39;s face in the matter of a minute, obviously the rest of his family had seen it as it is been clearly visibleand with Ed&#39;s relief it wasn&#39;t gray, but matched her light brown hair color except there was a hint of blonde by her goatee area.<br />
<br />
As glorious as it was, it looked horribly out of place on her woman&#39;s face. Nobody was screaming about where dads beard went, or why she had one, the only thing causing a raucous was him not eating and looking astonished at her.</p>
