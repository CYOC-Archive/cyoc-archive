<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a beautiful Saturday morning. The sun was shining, The birds were singing. And Jim was feeling the comfort of his baby blue blanket.<br />
<br />
It took him a few seconds until he realized he doesn’t own a baby blue blanket. <br />
<br />
Jim shot up from his bed, and witnessed what was happening. <br />
<br />
&#8203;“Why the fuck am I in James’s room?” He asked himself. He was about to look around till he heard a crinkle. Jim looked down to see a himself wearing a diaper.<br />
<br />
&#8203;“Is this...” he fondled with the tapes and looked at the absorbent underwear a little more “a diaper!”<br />
<br />
Jim looked around the room, trying to find something to switch out the diapers. Thinking there was some other undergarments in the room, he searched the place.<br />
<br />
By the time this was happening, his parents could already see the results downstairs with their other son.<br />
<br />
&#8203;———————————————————————<br />
<br />
“Mommy I big boy now!” He exclaimed. James was loving the fact that he was an older boy. He was loving more to the fact that he wasn’t wearing diapers anymore, but big kid underwear.<br />
<br />
“Yes sweety, you are a big boy.” She replied while fixing breakfast, “But could you put on some clothes?” She was hoping that both of her boys would love to be in the other bodies. Just in case one didn’t like it, she was making chocolate chip pancakes.<br />
<br />
“Honey could you wake up Jim.” She asked. She saw her husband walk up the stairs, followed by the half nude teenager of theirs.<br />
<br />
———————————————————————<br />
<br />
Jim was now panicking. All he found were diapers. He was thinking of going to his room to find underwear, but his father was in the doorway, and Jim’s old boy was standing there only wearing underwear.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing with my body!” Jim shouted. He walked over, ready to start hitting him, but his dad scooped him up from the armpits. “We do not hit. He is your younger brother, even if he’s in your body.” <br />
<br />
“Younger brother? My body?” He thought. He put two and two together and realized it was James in his old body, which explains why he was in James’s body.<br />
<br />
Jim was being carried back to the bed, where he was laid on his back. <br />
<br />
“Could you get me some diapers buddy?” His father asked. “Ok daddy!” James responded as he walked over to the dresser, and grabbed a diaper from the floor. He handed it to his father, who then set it next to Jim.<br />
<br />
Jim didn’t realize it, but he was getting a diaper change from his own father. He was extreamly embarassed, blushing during the whole time. “Someone made a boom boom,” Jim’s father teased as he cleaned him up. <br />
<br />
It felt like an hour to Jim. When in reality, it was only three minutes. He was changed into a new diaper and got a shirt forced on him. His father carried him while James followed behind. <br />
<br />
“James I thought I told you to get clothes on?” His mother nagged when they entered the kitchen. “Sorry mommy!” James said as he ran back upstairs.<br />
<br />
As he was gone, Jim was sat down in a high chair as breakfast was being served around the table. “What did you do to me?!” He demanded.<br />
<br />
“Aw, is my baby still cranky?” She cooed. This made Jim more frustrated.<br />
<br />
“I’m not a baby! I am fucking 16 years old!” He shouted. He never swore when his parents were in earshot, let alone at them.<br />
<br />
“Honey?” She looked towards her husband, who picked Jim up from the high chair and into the living room. He sat down and laid Jim over his knee, and then gave him a spanking.<br />
<br />
After 10 swats, Jim was released. He immedietly cried on the first one, and once he reached 10, he didn’t feel like standing. <br />
<br />
Not wanting their son to be on the floor crying, Jim’s dad scooped him up and sat him back down in the high chair.<br />
<br />
“Did you learn your lesson?” She asked. Jim nodded his head while sniffling. “It hurts” he complained. “Sweety it’s gonna hurt. Daddy wouldn’t have hit you if you didn’t say a bad word to mommy.” She cooed. <br />
<br />
James came back downstairs with one of Jim’s shirts on. “That’s my shirt!” He complained. “Nuh uh, it’s my shirt now!” James replied. The two kept bickering till their mother demanded silence. They both quieted in fear of their mother.<br />
<br />
“As you two know, you are not in your original body. We did this because Jim wasn’t being such a good boy and needed to be taught a lesson. We could have just treated him like a baby, but diapers his size cost way more than baby diapers.”<br />
<br />
“So you decided to switch our bodies?” Jim asked.<br />
<br />
“It was the only way. We could treat you like a baby again, while James gets to be a big boy for a while.” <br />
<br />
“That isn’t fair. Why do I have to be like this while he is in my body?”<br />
<br />
“Because we love you too much. You were doing drugs and sneaking into places you shouldn’t be.”<br />
<br />
“You could have asked me to stop, and I would have considered it!”<br />
<br />
&#8203;&#8203;“My point exactly. You would have never stopped unless we stopped you.” She grabbed the plate of pancakes and passed them around. “This punishment will last as long as we feel like. If you act like a good boy, we may make it a month and switch you two back.”<br />
<br />
&#8203;&#8203;“A month?! I have school and friends. They’ll start to worry about me!” Jim argued as he was having his pancake sliced up into little bits.<br />
<br />
&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;“That is why we are sending your brother to your grandmother’s she is aware of the situation and will deal with him for a while. As he is there, we told the school that you were doing drugs and asked for you to be excused while we taught you a lesson.”<br />
<br />
“Mom!”<br />
<br />
&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;“What, you want me to tell them you can go back to school? Because we can send you back right now. Maybe your friends could change your diaper while you’re there?”<br />
<br />
Jim pouted at his defeat and ate his pancakes.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
After breakfast, and another argument due to the fact that James couldn’t stay clean with the syrup and got Jim’s shirt dirty, the family got all dressed up. Both boys had to be cleaned, with Jim’s mother cleaning him and his father cleaning James. They were planning to head to _____ before they went to their mother’s house</p>
