<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Next time we&#39;ll finish the witch&#39;s hovel. Just adding some breakpoints for easy branching.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know what, she can talk and it&#39;s still better than this. Possession.&quot; A bright light flashed and Alec found himself looking up at a large pink sack. His belly felt full, but a strong sweet smell hung around the area that made him feel hungry regardless. <br />
&quot;Alec?&quot; He heard Vivian&#39;s voice booming behind him.<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; He answered in his new high pitched voice. He got on all fours and turned around. Movement wasn&#39;t nearly as precise as when she&#39;d been an adult. The paws seemed much bigger than the legs. Slightly clumsy even.<br />
Vivian stood tall before him like a giant, even blocking out the sun. &quot;Damn. You&#39;re cute.&quot;<br />
The cow behind them sluggishly started to move away. &quot;Did..did I just doom that woman to remain a cow?&quot; He squeaked. <br />
&quot;Based on what Andrea said I wouldn&#39;t think so. Her mind should reassert itself, unless it couldn&#39;t. Let&#39;s get into the witch&#39;s cabin.&quot;<br />
She took a step way and Alec found himself left far behind. &quot;Wait up!&quot; he squeaked and he tried to pursue her. Deep within a new urge awoke, he wanted to jump at Vivian&#39;s feet. Bat at them with his new claws.<br />
Vivian spun around and snatched him up, hugging him between her 6 breasts and her arm. &quot;This is probably faster.&quot;<br />
&quot;You just wanted to hug me.&quot; Alec purred as he snuggled between the soft mounds of flesh.<br />
<br />
Alec hadn&#39;t known exactly what he expected to find in a witch&#39;s cabin, though most things in his world depicted it as small, dirty and disheveled hovels. This did tick one of those boxes at least. However the walls were lined with jars and odd looking metallic tools. <br />
The way everything had been neatly lined up gave the impression that there was a system in place, even if he couldn&#39;t quite grasp what it was. <br />
A stack of chairs and a rolled up rug stood in the corner. Leaving the wooden floor empty.<br />
A black cauldron hung above a burning fire, a large bucket and a mop were placed before it.<br />
&quot;Did we catch her during spring cleaning?&quot; Alec squeaked. Vivian&#39;s body felt so delightfully warm and soft on his fur.<br />
As he peered over her arms, she scratched behind his ears.<br />
&quot;Where do we start?&quot;<br />
&quot;What if I put you on one of the shelves and you inspect the stuff there while I search the cabinets?&quot;<br />
She careful put him next to a jar containing some weird orbs floating in a murky liquid. The jar itself was nearly as big as he himself was.<br />
Alec carefully slipped passed and started inspecting the different jars. <br />
Whether it was Alec&#39;s inner child or his new kitten body, he soon found himself weaving playfully between the large jars. Nearly falling when a paw slipped over the edge, but he narrowly managed to cling to the shelf.<br />
At the end of the shelf he briefly observed Vivian who was rummaging through one of the witch&#39;s large wooden closets. She was holding up a green silky shirt. The light seemed to bounce of the fabric, giving it the impression of changing colors. <br />
She slipped it over her head, but struggled with the chest area. Finished she pulled out a dress which she threw on a stack of clothes that had accumulated on the chairs.<br />
&quot;Much better don&#39;t you think?&quot; She said as she turned around. It was a tight fit, through which Alec could see that at least her nipples had returned to normal. <br />
She put Alec on the next shelf.<br />
<br />
Alec was galloping across the last shelf when Andrea walked in. Her arms seemed to be nearly half length already and her grey skin had taken a more brownish hue. He glanced at Vivian, who was still sporting her 6 large breasts and still looked shorter than he remembered. <br />
&quot;Found anything?&quot; She asked as she walked in.<br />
Vivian motioned at the chair in the corner. &quot;I think you&#39;ll find something in there for yourself and anyone else who needs anything.&quot; <br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Alec?&quot; She said while going through the stack.<br />
&quot;He&#39;s on the top shelf.&quot;<br />
&quot;On the top shelf?&quot; Andrea rapidly followed the top shelves before spotting Alec&#39;s new Nekomata kitten body as he was climbing through a mesh wire orb with a crystal mounted inside. <br />
&quot;A Nekomata kitten? Where did you find that, they&#39;re not native to this location. And you be careful with that artifact!&quot; She held up a tank top, but struggled to put it on. Her arms were still to short to reach over her head. &quot;Vivian, a little help please. No staring at the woman getting dressed Alec.&quot;<br />
Vivian explained as she helped pull the top down over Andrea.<br />
&quot;A youth spell, the witch must&#39;ve had some crazy powerful stuff around to do that. They&#39;re even harder to cast, but easier to maintain because your body remains the same. Just younger which is a state your body knows.&quot; Andrea said as she observed Alec navigating the shelves.<br />
<br />
Other mostly normal women had entered the cabin afterwards and were trying on clothes. Vivian had focused on a closed door at the far end of the cabin. It presumably led to the tower.<br />
Alec meanwhile focused on his task of scouting, trying his best not to look in the general direction of the women getting dressed. He could feel Andrea&#39;s watchful eyes follow him around where ever he went.<br />
He sniffed a weird stick with gold engravings. Something about it made his nose tingle. &quot;Is this something?&quot;<br />
Andrea was only able to take a single step before some other girls spotted him.<br />
&quot;Oh my god, look at that! It&#39;s super cute!&quot; A girl, half covered in feathers said pointing at Alec with a feathered finger.<br />
&quot;Did you hear it&#39;s voice Amy?&quot; Alec froze as another girl bounded forward, her long blond hair and cow tail dancing behind her and snatched him off the sheld by the skin in his neck. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen a Nekomata kitten before. It&#39;s so cute and fluffy!&quot; She gave him a big hug. She smelled nice and sweet.<br />
&quot;Hey, please don&#39;t.&quot; His tiny high pitched voice trembled as she thrust him towards the other girl. The feathered girl stroke his head with a feathered hand. She smelled distinctly like chicken. &quot;Is it yours?&quot; She asked Andrea.<br />
A few other women closed in, but were pushed apart Vivian came rushing into the fray. The room spun around as she plucked him the other girls hands and took a step back. &quot;Careful ladies, we owe our lives to this little guy here.&quot; She held him aloft for all to see, hands under his shoulders. &quot;The mighty Alec!&quot;<br />
The room fell silent. <br />
&quot;That&#39;s not a guy, Nekomata are an all female race.&quot; One said.<br />
The loud noise of something wooden breaking, broke the silence and turned everyone&#39;s attention to Andrea. &quot;That should help some people.&quot; She put the two parts of the item back on the shelf.<br />
&quot;Okay, so let me explain.&quot; Alec was about to protest, but Vivian strategically placed her hand over his tiny maw as she launched into the story. To Alec&#39;s amazement Vivian actually told a stunning tale filled with explosions and last ditch efforts. There were a few more explosions, but it was more or less what happened. He&#39;d expected her to play it more for laughs.<br />
The room was silent for but a moment before Alec was showered in thanks.<br />
A woman at the back, built like a brick and clad in silver armor clapped her hands drawing attention. &quot;I found our equipment out back for anyone that wants to know. Now, I will happily go and fetch Aleg&#39;s body as thanks if you can point me in the general direction.&quot;<br />
&quot;Where is our stuff?&quot; The feathered woman asked.<br />
The armored woman pointed them outside. <br />
&quot;Andrea, can you see about that door while I point...&quot; &quot;Gwen&quot; &quot;Gwen to where we left &#39;Alec&#39;&#39;s body?&quot; Putting extra emphasis on Alec&#39;s proper name, she handed Alec to Andrea, who smelled quite unpleasant. She smelled a little sour. &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
As everyone left Andrea put Alec on the floor as she went at the door. The cabin was huge to Alec&#39;s tiny eyes. Huge walls, giant chairs and towering cabinets. Only now did he notice how small he really was, it was intimidating and he instinctively felt his tail wrap between his hind legs.<br />
He crawled closer to Andrea as she made some weird gestures at the door. He sat silently watching her work, until Vivian rejoined.<br />
&quot;Well?&quot;<br />
&quot;Try picking it again.&quot;<br />
The door swung open revealing a narrow staircase. &quot;Damn girl, we still make a stellar team.&quot;<br />
Vivian scooped Alec back up and clutched him to her chest. Alec noted that she was definitely starting to return back to normal. Her cushioning felt smaller than the first time she&#39;d picked him up. But still, he pushed himself into their soft warm embrace.</p>
