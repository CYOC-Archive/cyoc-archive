<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morgan paused as she heard movement within her sanctum. It sounded as if Rick had finally arrived for training.<br />
<br />
Ever since her attack on Akira, and the aftermath of the attack by Fukushu, the lycan sorceress had been forced into hiding. She needed to be careful, yet still had an apprentice to train. While Rick may not have been as talented as some of her past student&#39;s, she needed to prepare him for the fight to come. &quot;You&#39;re early Rick,&quot; she called. &quot;Perhaps you are finally beginning to take this seriously.&quot; Turning the corner, Morgan paused as she gazed at the trio gathered within her hideout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kari?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari, the black kitsune and Morgan&#39;s best friend, now offered the sorceress a warm smile. &quot;Hello Morgan it&#39;s been awhile.&quot; Morgan was speechless, gawking at the nine tailed kitsune. &quot;How...how did you find me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari now slowly raised her arm, Morgan noting the small friendship bracelet clutched in her hand. &quot;Remember this,&quot; she said. &quot;Remember how we placed that enchantment on it so we would always be able to find eachother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you still have it,&quot; Morgan stated in wonder. &quot;We made those at summer camp when we were what? Nine? Maybe ten years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Luckily for you Kari is incredibly organized,&quot; Tricia smiled. Morgan now glanced at the Dragon Queen. The middle-aged woman,  remaining in human form as she gave her old friend a kind smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And a pack rat,&quot; Lynne offered. &quot;Lets be honest here, Kari saved pretty much every gift we ever gave her. Could be a form of OCD.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lynne how are you even here,&quot; Morgan exclaimed as she gazed at the ghostly figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You think a little thing like being dead can stop me,&quot; she smirked. &quot;Think again Morgan! Besides someone has to be here to call you a dumbass. We both know I&#39;m best suited for that job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan frowned, furrowing her brow at the ghost of Lynne. &quot;God even in death you can be insufferably smug,&quot; she groaned. &quot;Is that why you crossed over? To tease me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We came because we&#39;re worried Morgan,&quot; Tricia stated. &quot;We heard about what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we want to help you,&quot; Kari added. Morgan perked up, were her old friends willing to help her destroy Fukushu and perhaps this new Catalyst?<br />
<br />
&quot;We want you to turn yourself in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Morgan exclaimed. &quot;Turn myself in! You can&#39;t be serious Kari.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am very serious,&quot; Kari replied. &quot;The kitsune and the Yakuza have placed a price on your head. We want to keep you safe. We don&#39;t want you to hurt anyone else or get hurt yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan we love you,&quot; Tricia added. &quot;We all grew up together. You know what you did is wrong but, we don&#39;t want to see anyone hurt you. Please, turn yourself in.&quot; Morgan scowled, turning her gaze to the ghost of Lynne Harris. In life Lynne had been like a sister. The two trading barbs, usually at Morgan&#39;s expense. Still, Lynne was the closest thing to family in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont give me that look,&quot; Lynne huffed. &quot;Yes I wanted to come here. Call you an idiot, Crack a few jokes at your expense but, at the end of the day I do care about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what would you have me do Lynne,&quot; Morgan grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go with Kari you putz,&quot; Lynne exclaimed. &quot;Let her take you before the kitsune. Maybe she can save your life. It beats waiting around to die by some heartless mercenary looking to collect a payday on your bony ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My ass isn&#39;t bony Lynne,&quot; Morgan grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHATEVER,&quot; Lynne exclaimed. &quot;Look, all I know is a metric ton of bad is heading your way. So can you please...just listen. Please Morgan! I&#39;m begging you, don&#39;t just throw your life away. We want to save you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan sighed, as ineloquent as Lynne could be, she was, in her own way  trying to help. Forces were gathering against her and she would most certain be safer with these three than whoever else was looking for her. As she looked to speak, she gasped as she felt a blade now press against her throat.<br />
<br />
Two weeks prior <br />
<br />
Abolith sighed as she and Yuriko now made their way for home. Despite being reduced to a child of six, she had rather enjoyed her girls night. It was strange for the elf honestly. After so many centuries of hating humans, she was beginning to forge friendships with a group of teenage girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Admit it you had fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith frowned, glancing at the now elderly wizard by her side. Yuriko was all smiles, the wizard had thoroughly enjoyed her evening out. &quot;Being reduced to a child is not exactly my idea of fun wizard.&quot; Yuriko smirked, she could tell just by Aboliths subtle expression. The fearsome elf assassin had enjoyed herself, making friends and just relaxing. It was something Yuriko never thought would happen, a fact she now wished to gloat over just a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah you had fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith sighed, she didn&#39;t want to admit it but she had enjoyed herself. Yes being reduced to a child had not been on her to do list, but she now understood the appeal. Things seemed simpler, the smallest things bringing great joy. Maybe that was why these wizards so often adjusted their ages. Still, she hated admitting it to someone she had considered an adversary for more than 80 years. <br />
<br />
&quot;Abolith a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith and Yuriko paused as Aiko now approached. The five tailed vixen had a serious expression on her vulpine face. Yuriko, sensing that the matter was private, now gave the elf a warm smile before entering her home. &quot;Yes Aiko,&quot; Abolith stated. &quot;I need to speak with you in private,&quot; the vixen said. &quot;I need your skills for a very important job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Present day<br />
<br />
&quot;Abolith,&quot; Kari gasped. The elf assassin now gave the kitsune an impish smirk, pressing her blade tightly to Morgan&#39;s throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here,&quot; Tricia asked, the Dragon Queens body beginning to shift. Golden wings now sprung from her back as her eyes became a solid amber hue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Collecting a bounty,&quot; Abolith stated. &quot;The Yakuza have placed a half billion dollar price on Morgan&#39;s head. Alive if possible. Dead.....just good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Release her Abolith,&quot; Kari growled, the kitsunes tails violently swishing behind her. Abolith chuckled softly, it had taken her weeks to track down Morgan&#39;s location. Once she had accomplished that the trick was gaining access to the lycan sorceress&#39;s sanctuary. Thankfully her intuition paid off. It was only a matter of time before Morgan&#39;s friends discovered her location, after which all she needed to do was follow. When Kari and the others had entered, Abolith slipped in unnoticed, waiting for a moment to strike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont kill her,&quot; Kari threatened. &quot;Or so help me I&#39;ll will make you pay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That goes double for me,&quot; Tricia and Lynne added. Abolith simply shook her head as she gazed at three very old foes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re catching me in a bit of a transitional period,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&#39;t want to kill your dear friend Morgan but she is coming with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if I refuse,&quot; Morgan hissed. Abolith now pressed the blade tighter, a single trickle of blood now slowly running down Morgan&#39;s neck. &quot;I said I didn&#39;t want to,&quot; Abolith said softly. &quot;Not that I wouldn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t let you take her,&quot; Kari yelled angrily. Abolith smirked, gazing at the dragoness, kitsune, and ghost she had battled for decades.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets be honest girls,&quot; she said. &quot;You&#39;ve never been able to defeat me. At best it was a stalemate. Do you truely wish to take that chance with Morgan&#39;s life on the line?&quot; Kari, Lynne, and Tricia now scowled. This was a standoff between them, the only question was who would make the first move.</p>
