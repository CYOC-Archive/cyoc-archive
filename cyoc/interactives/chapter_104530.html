Eric and Spencer managed to get most of their homework done before Evan came home. He was exhausted, or various reasons. One being the elaborate plan to rid themselves of Mr. Nosey (aka Sean Walker) before he stumbled upon anything he shouldn’t. <br />
<br />
The other was his father’s outlandish demand that Evan drop everything he was doing and come help him move. Evan hadn’t wanted his father to move into town in the first place. Why would he want to help him move?<br />
<br />
“Oh come on, help your dear Daddy move these heavy boxes.” Mike pleaded in a “hurt” voice.<br />
<br />
“Yes because your precious knick-knacks are so very heavy and valuable.” Evan rolled his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Gah, you’re no fun are you. I don’t know who you inherited that ‘stick in the mud’ attitude from, but it sure ain’t from my side.”<br />
<br />
“Great. I’m home if you need anything, like a lift back to Seattle. Spencer and Eric say hi.” Evan added when he saw Spencer making a waving motion with her hand from the living room. <br />
<br />
“Aw, nice to know someone cares about me.” <br />
<br />
“Dad…” But Mike had already hung up. Evan gritted his teeth as he put his phone away. He was trying very hard not to throw it into the garbage disposal. Or crack it in half with his own hands. Mike meant well, but had a very funny way of showing how he cared about his family. Kind of like Spencer. At least she knew when to keep her mouth shut. <br />
<br />
“So, how was your day? Better than mine?” Evan walked into the living room and sat in one of the lounge chairs across the way from the couch Eric and Spencer currently occupied. <br />
<br />
“Uh, interesting enough. Did Mom talk to you at all?” Spencer asked. <br />
<br />
“Ya, about that,” Evan sat forward, remembering the odd conversation he’d had with Martin Stovall, “I was already on the phone with him, so I figured why not take care of two issues at once. So I asked Martin to talk to Julie about backing off.” <br />
<br />
“You did?” Spencer’s jaw almost dropped. <br />
<br />
“Yes. Martin was more than willing. He doesn’t approve of his daughter’s… behavior either.” Evan said. <br />
<br />
“Good to know.” Spencer said, looking at Eric. They both had the same thought running through their head. Had Julie gotten a lecture when she’d gotten home? And would that keep her from making any further attempts on Eric’s “normalness”? <br />
<br />
“You kids alright? Seem kinda distracted.” Evan asked. <br />
<br />
“Just thinking about school stuff.” Spencer lied. <br />
<br />
“Really? You thinking about school stuff?” Evan raised an eyebrow. As far as lies went, that was one of Spencer’s worst since the “Santa told me he was allergic to peanuts and that I could ear the cookies” lie. <br />
<br />
“I guess.” Spencer shrugged. Evan didn’t question her further, but knew something must be going on with Spencer and Eric. Not necessarily between the two of them, but something was up. <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Nate spent his afternoon going back and forth between his homework, and staring at his cell phone. He couldn’t make up his mind about calling or not calling Kenya. <br />
<br />
Finally he gave in and dialed the number. Four rings later, and Nate felt his heart stop at the sound of Kenya’s voice. Part of him was hoping she couldn’t pick up. He had no idea what to say to her. <br />
<br />
“Nate, thank you for calling me back.” she said softly. <br />
<br />
“Ya. I wasn’t going to until like ten seconds ago.” Nate admitted. <br />
<br />
“All the same, thank you.”<br />
<br />
“Right. So, uh, how was your weekend?” Nate said awkwardly. Small talk with an ex wasn’t his forte. Talk with an ex wasn’t his thing period. But then Nate only had a handful of ex-girlfriends. And most made a point to avoid him. <br />
<br />
“Um, not the best I’ve ever had. But that’s what I wanted to talk to you about.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Nate couldn’t wait to hear this speech. <br />
<br />
“I don’t expect you to accept, but I was wondering if you’d be willing to talk. In person.” Kenya said. The past day for her had been terrible. She’d called in “sick”, and then spent the day lying in bed kicking herself for letting her life get so out of control with Jack and Nate. <br />
<br />
Her heart was being torn in two pieces, and she didn’t know which one to pull back. And, cheesy metaphor aside, Kenya wanted to be with both of them. But knew that neither would approve of that kind of relationship. Well Jack maybe, but Nate was too young. He only just became a were, he couldn’t possibly understand. Even if his parents had some kind of arrangement. <br />
<br />
It was different when you were the participating party. Watching someone else pile drive your significant other, it isn’t something that everyone could handle. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know. I’m pretty sure last time we spoke I told you I was done. Remember? I went to your house and you weren’t there.” <br />
<br />
“And then I spent the afternoon crying against the front wall,” Nate thought. <br />
<br />
“You’re still mad then.” Kenya said with a heavy heart. Any heavier and she might be pulled into the Earth’s core.  “I’m…”<br />
<br />
“God Kenya please don’t say you’re sorry. I know, okay? You’re sorry. Everyone’s sorry. I’m sorry I’m not more interesting, you’re sorry you kept the ring, Eric’s sorry he couldn’t give me better advice. Thank god Spencer didn’t say I told you so, otherwise I might have really lost it.” Nate fumed. <br />
<br />
“Wait, who said you’re not interesting?” Kenya asked, that part of Nate’s sentence sticking with her more than the others. <br />
<br />
“You got bored with me and decided to see other guys.” Nate said in a huff. <br />
<br />
“No I didn’t!”<br />
<br />
“Really? Then why did you go and see whoever it was that you saw? And don’t say it was for the money because we both know that’s not true. You work at a bank for crying out loud.” <br />
<br />
“Do you really want the truth?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Nate replied. <br />
<br />
“I missed him.” <br />
<br />
“Uh huh. Which implies you had more than just a ‘casual’ relationship.” Nate said. His face was in a hard frown. Nate glanced at his clock, and knew that he’d have to go get Eric soon. Which was a good excuse to get off the phone. <br />
<br />
“We didn’t. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy his company. But I never intended for anything to come out of the evening. It was just supposed to be that one time.”<br />
<br />
“Ya, so you keep saying,” Nate sighed, “Look I’ve got somewhere to be right now. And I need to think. I’ll call you back tomorrow. Same time?”<br />
<br />
“That’s fine.” <br />
<br />
“Right. Bye I guess.” Nate hung the phone up and leaned back into his desk chair. So much so that he tipped himself over and landed on his back. <br />
<br />
“Damn it, can’t catch a break today can I?” he thought, picking himself up. He dusted himself off and descended the staircase. William was in his office working on some paperwork, and Martha was out (wink). <br />
<br />
“Dad, I’m going over to Spencer’s to pick up Eric!” Nate called. <br />
<br />
“Alright. Why are you picking him up? The Lawson’s place is only a few blocks from ours. And what was that loud thump I heard?” William came around the corner. <br />
<br />
“I fell out of my chair. And I dunno, Eric just asked for a lift.” Nate said quickly. He wasn’t about to go and worry his dad about the whole “Julie’s gone crazy” situation. Besides, it wasn’t Nate’s place to say, this was Eric’s problem. And with any luck, it would go away soon. Or else Nate would be more than happy to help Spencer reduce that nutcase of an ex to sashimi.</p>
