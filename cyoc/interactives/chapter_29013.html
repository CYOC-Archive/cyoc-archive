<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait till you meet Peter, Eric... You'll like him... he's really laid back... typical Canadian... hehe...&quot; Ty chuckled, as he was walking next to Eric while strolling down the path which leads to the large mid-city park, where numerous tennis courts, basketball courts, and a large baseball field was located.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Canadian too actually.&quot; Eric said. &quot;Born in Vancouver.&quot; He was still a little distracted by the massive muscles he and Ty possessed. &quot;So when did you learn you could this magic stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got this power on the day I turned fifteen... It was really cool... I first tested it on my foster brother.... he totally freaked out when I made him three years younger... It was great! So, how are you feeling? Feels good, being a muscle dude, huh?&quot; Ty said, as he flexed his right arm. &quot;With guns like this, nobody is gonna bug you in school, dude! Guaranteed! And everybody loves it when I make you big! Satisfaction guaranteed, or your money back!&quot; Ty laughed. <br />
<br />
From a distance, he could see Peter and another teen on the basketball court. <br />
<br />
&quot;That figures! Whenever you see Peter, you know Allen can't be far away. Those two guys are inseparable. I swear those guys are like brothers! In fact, Allen and peter are almost like me and you! The way I can change you, well Allen does the same to Peter!&quot; Ty explained to Eric, as the slowly approached the basketball court, where Peter and Allen were taking turns taking shots at the basketball hoop.<br />
<br />
Eric smiled. &quot;Oh yeah, I'm lovin' this.&quot; he said, flexing his arms. &quot;Is Allen like you guys? Can he change other people? The way you phrased it, sounds like Allen can only change Peter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter used to be like me, where he could change everybody. Then he met Allen, and Allen wanted to try it. Prince, the wizard master, saw how Peter and Allen totally trusted one another, and he saw how skilled Allen was, and he wanted to make Allen into a wizard as well. Allen's currently in training and he did a swap with peter. He's just like me, with one exception, that he can only change Peter and nobody else. But he loves to make peter big and he'll use any excused to make him grow! And Peter doesn't care, to be honest. So Allen now has Peter's powers for one year. After that, Allen will be evaluated and if he passes the test, he can get his own powers.&quot; Ty explained to Eric. &quot;Allen may do anything he wants with Peter. Of course, he may not hurt him, or else he'll fail the test and he'll lose his powers. So, Allen's always making Peter hulk out! And Peter doesn't mind that one bit, of course!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Allen's captain of the high school swim team, and Peter's one of his teammates...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nifty.&quot; Eric said. &quot;Can you guys do more with your powers than just transform people?&quot; Eric asked. He looked ahead and saw they weren't too much further from the park. &quot;Being muscular still doesn't make you move at light speed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure! If I know you well enough, I can teleport you!&quot; Ty explained. &quot;Allen does that better than I can, I'll admit. Of course, he only has one person to practice on, so he knows Peter very well!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! Can you teleport us into the middle of the court?&quot; Eric asked. &quot;Oh and to clarify something, so you mean Peter has no powers at all right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct! Allen has Peter's powers now....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I'll teleport us to the court!&quot; Ty said. Ty closed his eyes and concentrated. In an instant, Eric and Ty found themselves standing on the center line of the basketball court!<br />
<br />
Eric gasped. &quot;Woah!&quot; he exclaimed loudly. He was standing right behind the one who he assumed was Allen, though he wasn't sure. &quot;Ty, some introductions, please…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Allen, Peter! I want to introduce you to Eric, my next door neighbor!&quot; Ty said as he pointed out Eric to Allen and Peter. Peter was slightly taller than Allen. Peter had light brown spiky hair while Allen had longer, straight jet black hair<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you, Eric...&quot; Allen said, as he extended his hand to Eric...<br />
<br />
Eric shook the offered hand. &quot;Likewise, Allen. And to you Peter.&quot; he said. He stretched his massive arms and smiled. &quot;So, Ty tells me you'll use any excuse to hulk up Peter?&quot; Eric asked Allen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Well, speaking of hulking up... What is this? Both you guys look pretty buff! And I KNOW that Ty normally doesn't look so big! So, Eric, Are you REALLY this big, or did Ty use HIS power to do a number on you?&quot; Allen wondered, giving a suspicious look. &quot;Two can play this game, because I can do this to Peter, too! I know that Ty can change everybody, but hey, I can change Peter without even looking at him! And Ty doesn't know everybody well enough that he can do that!&quot; Allen said, as he bragged about his powers over Peter.<br />
<br />
Eric smirked. &quot;Yeah Ty did this. He's awesome. I for one don't believe you.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humph! Ty thinks he's cool cause he can change anybody! But, I can change peter anytime and anywhere!&quot; Allen announced. Ty just rolled his eyes. &quot;Alright Allen....&quot;  &quot;Look!&quot; Allen said. Allen closed his eyes tight. Suddenly, Peter's pectorals increased slightly.<br />
<br />
Peter gasped as his pecs started to grow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh boy, here we go again.&quot; he groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; Allen said, as he opened his eyes. &quot;I can make him grow with my eyes closed!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can even make him grow in my sleep!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Show off!&quot; Ty chuckled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I just met Eric, my new neighbor! I can make him grow, too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Eric feels his chest getting bigger as well, while Ty has his eyes closed<br />
<br />
Eric looked down. At the start of this game he'd been muscular. So the pounds were just being added on. He looked down as his pecs grew even larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look Ty... On the count of three... we close our eyes and we each make our guy grow without looking... I'll count to ten.... then stop and we'll see who is the biggest..... The biggest guy wins, okay?&quot; Allen suggested. <br />
<br />
&quot;Deal!&quot; Ty said... Both peter and Eric were talking, without hearing what Ty and Allen were discussing. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, Eric, do you live around here? I'm from Toronto&quot; Peter said to Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;I used to live in Vancouver, then I moved to Edmonton, Winnipeg, Fredericton, Sudbury and here.&quot; he said, counting off the cities on his fingers. &quot;It's not fun to move around a lot, but you get used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allen and Ty closed their eyes. Allen started counting... <br />
<br />
&quot;One... Two...&quot;... Peter gasped out loud when he realized that his body started to grow rapidly! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man! Here we go again! I-I'm growing!!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
His legs were growing longer and wider, as well as his arms and torso! In fact, his entire body was growing in proportion, but so was Eric! <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm grooooooowinggggg!!!&quot; Peter shouted as he shot up! <br />
<br />
Luckily Allen allowed his clothes to grow with him as he grew to 7 ft... 8 ft... 9 ft in height.....<br />
<br />
&quot;Three.... Four.... Five....&quot; Allen continued....<br />
<br />
Eric gasped out loud as his muscles continued to inflate to truly gigantic proportions. He was already about 5' 8'' because of the muscle. Now he was at least 8 ft tall, and still growing. When Peter was at 8 ft, Eric was 10.<br />
<br />
Eric just gasped when he realized he was getting bigger but laughed when he realized that Peter was experiencing the same thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I guess we're BOTH growing, Eric!&quot; Peter shouted at Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Six ... Seven.... Eight....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure seems that way.&quot; Eric replied as he reached 13 ft. &quot;Hey Ty, add in more muscle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric felt his body becoming bigger and taller! Not only that, but his muscles were becoming huge as well! His pectorals were inhumanly huge; his legs were gigantic, and his arms were bigger than ever; bigger than columns on a highway!<br />
<br />
&quot;Nine... Ten.... STOP!&quot; Allen shouted.<br />
<br />
Eric and Peter stared at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh Ty... I think you won the contest this time....&quot; Allen said, as he looked over at the two giant teens... Peter and Eric were looming over them, looking down at Ty and Allen who seemed like tiny men... Peter was 15 feet tall while Eric was 19 feet tall! <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Eric is HUGE!&quot; Peter exclaimed, as he looked up at Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won! I won!&quot; Ty cheered! &quot;My guy is the biggest!&quot; <br />
<br />
Eric looked down at himself. He was simply gigantic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have more muscle?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you got the biggest muscles on earth!&quot; Ty laughed. &quot;What more do you want?&quot; <br />
<br />
When Ty walked up to him, he came up to Eric's knees.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the good thing about this is, you'll get to grow a lot, Eric!&quot; Peter said to him. &quot;I'm kinda used to this already!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric took a single step and the ground shook as it absorbed his weight and mass. <br />
<br />
&quot;How much muscle is on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric, your legs are like giant columns of steel and concrete! Your calves are like big boulders of power, bulging at the seams. Your abs are giant tiles on your torso. Your pecs are huge spheres of muscles, like peaks of a mountain range, and your arms are like the main water line! You're built like a tank right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric flexed his humongous muscles. &quot;Sweet. Now I think we came here for a basketball game. Ty, can you make me a twelve year old athlete? You know, like a basketball player or a surfer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely!&quot; With that, Allen and Ty shrunk Peter and Eric back to normal so that they could play basketball at the park.</p>
