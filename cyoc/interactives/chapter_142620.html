<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;To recap: your syllabus and introductory coursework will be emailed to you.  Confirm your receipt with a response, otherwise you will be automatically dropped.&quot; Pascal eyed his wristwatch.  &quot;The following chime means class is dismissed.&quot;  Pascal looked up just as the campus bell gently struck 12pm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect.&quot; Pascal thought to himself, tucking his notes neatly in his briefcase.  Even with the minor disruption from Master Daniel and his so-called &quot;Alpha Bear&quot; Magnus, he was able to complete the class on time.  Usually he had trouble keeping his redhead classes focused; The extreme, hyper-virility of Celtic physiology meant redheaded students were constantly leaving for relief-room breaks.  But, with Dan present, none of the students dared leave.  His presence was captivating for the redheads, but even Pascal found himself strangely drawn to Dan in a very powerful way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Professor Pascal?&quot; Dan timidly approached while Magnus towered above them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master Daniel?&quot; Pascal tried his best to maintain an austere appearance, but there was something about Dan that was gently eroding his aura of powerful sophistication.  He gulped, studying Dan&#39;s physique.  Small at 6&#39;1&quot;, but reasonably muscled...must be about 400lbs.  Even his package looked modest...couldn&#39;t be more than a foot long.  What was it about him that was so...irresistible?<br />
<br />
&quot;Since class is over, I was wondering if I could have my phone--&quot; Pascal interrupted suddenly, his heart skipping a beat at the sound of Dan&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;--No!&quot;  He steadied himself.  THAT was incredibly unlike him...what was going on?  &quot;I mean,&quot; he breathed in, breaking eye contact with Dan...those beautiful, brown, doe eyes...hypnotically captivating...no wonder the redheads were drawn to him. &quot;I mean, no.&quot; Where had his famous resolution gone?  He turned away, trying to establish a more firm presence. &quot;Your phone will be waiting for you at the end of the day.  Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to meet my TA.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pascal hurried out of the hanger towards his office, his cock rock hard and dribbling pre down his leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good god, who was that man?&quot; Pascal stumbled into his office, quickly closing the door and whipping his cock out.  Thoughts of Dan&#39;s body against his, those perfect brown eyes, his commanding voice...Pascal tugged his wedding ring off and pocketed it before returning to his two-foot cock...his husband wouldn&#39;t mind, it&#39;s just fantasy.  Pascal leaned back into his private office chair, closing his eyes as he stroked to thoughts of Dan.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
There he was, kneeling alongside Master Dan&#39;s other slaves, Patrick, Marcus, Magnus...Dan was so powerful in Pascal&#39;s fantasy, he didn&#39;t dare look at him directly.  Then Dan invited him to worship at his feet...the sound of Dan&#39;s voice was enough to push Pascal over.  Moaning as he squirted himself suddenly and abruptly with hot streams of cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-FUCK!&quot; He wiped a glob of cum from his glasses. It seemed like the more he thought about Dan, the more he was turned on by him.  What was going on?  This was so unlike him.  Although finishing quickly meant he avoided a possibly embarrassing run-in with his TA.<br />
<br />
BZZZZ...it was Dan&#39;s phone.  Pascal&#39;s heart clenched, knowing the swarthy young Master would be visiting him in just a few hours to retrieve the device.<br />
<br />
&quot;I shouldn&#39;t...&quot; Pascal thought to himself...but this wasn&#39;t any phone brand he recognized.  The device was completely smooth, no bevel, impossibly thin, but had a sturdy weight to it.  It didn&#39;t seem like it was composed of technology or materials available today...<br />
<br />
The screen was suddenly on...Pascal had the strangest feeling that it was looking back at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;SCANNING NEW USER&quot; The screen wrote out suddenly as the device lifted from his hand.  Pascal fell back, the device staying firmly in place, facing him.  The air around the device rippled and Pascal saw an endless line of devices, spanning to infinity before snapping back into place.<br />
<br />
<b># dpascal@chronivac:$</b> Welcome, David Pascal<br />
<br />
His office seemingly back to normal...Only, the device was gone? Or, rather, it had always been a beige plastic terminal which sat on his desk.  The black and green CRT screen blinking warmly at him.  The form factor was so perfectly familiar that Pascal didn&#39;t question it, he knew exactly how to interact with this thing as if it was tailored to his exact knowledge.<br />
<br />
<b># dpascal@chronivac:$</b> whoami &#8617;<br />
<b># :$</b> sudo<br />
<br />
Pascal asked the machine who was logged in, and it responded with &quot;sudo,&quot; the unix designation for users with highest privileges. With sudo, you had absolute authority over a system with the ability to run any command.  But what was the scope of this system?<br />
<br />
<b># dpascal@chronivac:$</b> scope &#8617;<br />
<b># :$</b> universal<br />
<br />
Pascal was expecting something like &quot;Read/Write&quot; for a folder, but this program apparently ran on a universal scope with superuser privileges?  &quot;Impossible.&quot; He thought to himself.<br />
<br />
A knock at the door startled the professor, &quot;P-Professor Pascal?&quot;  It was his teaching assistant, an old student of his, carrying books and papers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, please come in, Gabe.&quot;  Pascal motioned to the corner of his crowded office, watching Gabe&#39;s massive 500-pound body squeeze through to set the books down.<br />
<br />
<b># :$</b> SUBJECT IN RANGE: Gabe Tanaka<br />
<b># :$</b> Age 22<br />
<b># :$</b> Height 6&#39;1&quot;<br />
<b># :$</b> Weight 500lbs<br />
<b>#:$</b> Eyes Hazel<br />
<b># :$</b> Hair Blond<br />
<b># :$</b> Measurements 65&quot;c, 72&quot;w, 22.5&quot;a, 44&quot;q<br />
<b># :$</b> Cock Size 23&quot; long, 15&quot; circumference (uncut)<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabe,&quot; Pascal said firmly, not looking up from the device, &quot;Don&#39;t. Move.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;P-Professor?&quot; Gabe gulped.  Pascal&#39;s eyes darting between the monitor and Gabe.  The stats printed out matched Gabe exactly...was young Gabe really less hung?  &quot;Is everything okay?&quot; Gabe was being a sport, but Pascal wanted to try something...<br />
<br />
<b># dpascal@chronivac:$</b> Set Gabe&#39;s cock to 36&quot; long, 18&quot; circumference (cut) &#8617;<br />
<b># :$</b> ...50%<br />
<b># :$</b> ...75%<br />
<b># :$</b> ...100%<br />
<br />
The command finished running with an 8-bit *bong* noise.  &quot;Impossible...&quot; Pascal mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;C-can I move, Professor?&quot; Gabe had been wearing lycra pants that just barely contained his two-foot uncut cock, but now he was wearing a kilt, his thick meat swaying down towards his ankles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabe, you&#39;re uncut, right?&quot; Pascal locked eyes with his TA.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no, Professor.&quot; He blushed, &quot;I&#39;m cut. See?&quot;  Gabe reeled his cock up, showing an off the head of his cock. &quot;What a odd question...everything okay, Professor?&quot; Letting his long member fall down to his ankles.<br />
<br />
Pascal typed some more before striking ENTER on the terminal, another *bong* indicating execution had completed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course, Gabe. And...how tall are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe furrowed his brow, not sure how to respond. &quot;Well...the ceilings in your office are 14-feet-tall,&quot; Gabe went up on his toes, letting his head touch the ceiling, &quot;So, I&#39;m just under 14-feet-tall?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another *bong* sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s your GPA?&quot; Pascal grinned, looking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, well...&quot; Gabe smiled, &quot;I only have this position because I&#39;m top of my class with a 4.0 and highest honors. I&#39;ve always been an academic overachiever, you know this, Professor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; Pascal winked to a confused Gabe, opening the door to his office. &quot;Thank you for the books I requested.  Please follow up with student emails.  That&#39;ll be all for today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe ducked out of the office, not quite sure what had happened.</p>
