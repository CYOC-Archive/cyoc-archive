<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He&#39;d never given it a second thought when he&#39;d seen dogs doing their business in the park. But as he squatted to do his, Jeff couldn&#39;t help but wonder why nobody had even given it any thought about how uncomfortable it was to piss in a snowbank, especially when the person in question didn&#39;t have a cock. Finishing, he trotted a couple steps before he realised how he was walking and stopping, he sighed heavily, as best a dog could.<br />
<br />
Lately, it had been getting harder and harder for him to go about on two legs. He could still do so, it just felt more natural, comfortable, if he was down on all fours. To make matters worse, he sometimes found himself dropping to fours without any consideration, which seemed to make the discomfort in specific areas of his body more noticeable. Trying not to think about any of this, he forced himself up on two legs, and took a couple unsteady steps. Understanding what was happening, that his slow transformation canine was gradually robbing him of his ability to stand and walk on two legs, the issue he saw was further compounded by another thing that was changing at the same time.<br />
<br />
At first, he hadn&#39;t even noticed it. Too busy fighting against his need to be down on all fours, to ignoring the pain and what else it brought, it took him a bit before he realised that, when he did manage to stand on two legs, his balance had actually grown worse. Believing he&#39;d gotten used to walking about on dog paws, he was dismayed to find his progress was going in the opposite direction, and had at first was certain it was because he was being reduced to a four legged animal. But then the truth hit home as one day he&#39;d wandered into the laundry room to lay down, and was immediately confronted by a pinched sensation in his tail bone when he sat in his dog bed.<br />
<br />
The truth immediately evident, Jeff didn&#39;t need to look back and down, but did anyway. Staring at the growth, he was dismayed to see it didn&#39;t have any fur covering it, yet was amazed he was able to move it when he put some effort into making it do so. Wondering why growing a tail was effecting his ability to walk, he still didn&#39;t know almost a week later. Trotting unsteadily across the yard, thinking about all that had occurred since his fur coat had finished covering his body, Jeff found himself at least glad it provided him enough warmth when outside as he crawled through the dog door and took a moment to force himself back up onto two legs. Heading toward the bathroom, he took a quick peek into the mirror, noted that his tail was almost done growing and that it was now covering it light brown fur from the base to a little past the mid point, at which point the fur turned dark brown to black for a little bit before it turned white at the tip, whilst the underside was developing a coat of white fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m now truly a dog from the neck down,&quot; Jeff thought to himself as he made his tail wag, studied his still unchanged head, let his canine tongue hang out as he started to pant, and leaving the bathroom, he wandered until the discomfort of being on two legs became too much and he headed for the laundry room.<br />
<br />
With a relieved sigh, he dropped onto his dog bed. Turning about in place, he shifted in an effort to get comfortable. Finding the ache in his joints and other areas of his body not so bad, he knew that if he was truthful with himself, it was actually the buzzy, tingly sensation in his female parts that sent feelings of wanting, longing, through his body that bothered him the most. Trying to ignore it seemed to make it worse, and knowing what he&#39;d soon be doing, Jeff took a moment to try and focus on anything else. Looking down at his fur-covered arms, he whimpered as he stared at them, seeing they&#39;d actually gotten shorter, and were almost the same length of his legs.<br />
<br />
He understood what this meant, but didn&#39;t want to accept it. Knowing it meant he really didn&#39;t have arms any longer, but that they were now two legs, he tried to ignore the fact before him as he rolled over onto his back, and stretched out his hind legs as far as they&#39;d go. The things that were now forepaws curled in a way a dog would hold them, Jeff didn&#39;t give it any thought as he lay for a moment, wishing the need in his vulva would go away. Twisting about, he soon ended up on his side, and trying to put a forepaw down between his back legs, something he&#39;d tried to do on a number of occasions, he was once more disappointed that the clumsy set-up and design of his forepaw prevented him from satisfying any feminine itch he felt. Wiggling about until the blankets on the bed had become wadded up, Jeff cringed at what he was about to do, but, at the same time, knew it was his only option to get some relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Short of going to find a male dog,&quot; he thought as he mounted the blanket and started to rub and thrust against the soft fabric, and finding he enjoyed it as his female bits were stimulated.<br />
<br />
Lost to the ecstasy, Jeff missed it as his bones and joints began to crack and morph. His arms changing the rest of the way to forelegs, his shoulders, spine, hips all popped and realigned. Starting to pant, a grin and a very doggy look of contentment on his face, Jeff shifted his stance to better accommodate what he was doing, which in turn caused the him to loose even quicker his ability to go about on two legs. Climaxing, he stiffened, raised his tail as high as it’d go, showing off how canine he now looked back there in the process, and uttered a series of low, dog-like noises of satisfaction. Taking a couple steps away from the blanket, he stopped to turn and sniff at them before he stepped off the bed. Wanting a drink of water, Jeff tried to stand up on two legs, and immediately dropped back to all fours. Trying again, and dropping back to all fours, he started to whimper.<br />
<br />
With a glance down at the front limbs that he had no choice but to see as forelegs, Jeff thought, “No, no, no. I’m not ready for this. I want this about as much as I want eight teats and girl parts,” and turning about in place, trying to wrap his mind around what’d happened and come to accept he was now confined to going about on four legs, he found himself as upset about it as he’d been when he’d lost the use of his hands. Continuing to whimper, he forced himself to hold still and come to understand it&#39;d happen sooner or later he&#39;d lose any ability he had to walk on two legs, but didn&#39;t find such thoughts comforting as he&#39;d hoped it&#39;d been the last thing of his humanity to go.<br />
<br />
Dejected, he tried anyway to stand up on two legs. When he wasn&#39;t able to, Jeff gave in to his newest situation as he plodded out of the laundry room and toward the kitchen to get himself a drink from the bowl of water.</p>
