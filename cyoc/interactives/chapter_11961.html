<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Denber hoisted himself aboard Mason's strong back, then turning the horse to head for his farm he looked at Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your meeting with Zepar was a curse into itself, you know! Any dealing with the devils leaves them the ultimate winners, while the fool human only knows the grief of his own actions. Demons and devils feel no grief! Their's is not a thought to being of honor, their only plan is to degrade man's life in any way they can. Your power to itself is a curse which you level upon others making them beasts an animals. You gain nothing from those people's transformation except sorrow, grief, and legal troubles as the authorities realize who is behind the disappearence of the town's citizens. Yes there my boy you got a real problem! I see only one good course for you and that is to commit physical suicide and become an animal yourself.&quot; sugested Mister Denber.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood there looking up to the man he and many other kids had for years thought of a mean and nasty man. The explanation of Zepar's goals and the suggestion Jeff take his own form and become one unto the animal world seemed to have merit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say I agree, and then become an animal the devil still wins, right?&quot; asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
Mr. Denber sighed as his horse Mason snorted. &quot;Yes Jeff the devil wins every soul you curse to become an animal and whether you are an animal or human by having the power you too are acursed in life and death no doubt as well! I would suggest you think about it and if your final thought is to become an animal form then come to me first so we might find a good and worth while form for you to live out your days.&quot; again suggested Mr. Denber.<br />
<br />
Mason was anxious and pawing the ground wanting to run for the Denber farm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa Mason, whoa big boy !&quot; said Mr. Denber to his mount.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason doesn't like being this close to a cursed person either, does he!&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
Mr. Denber laughed, &quot;No, he is still very human of mind having been changed to a horse as preferred to living as a man. He loves being a horse and I treat him well, if not better than a common ignorant animal. He know's about what time it is and who is visiting my farm this afternoon. Mason is a proud and happy stud stallion, his passion and lust for a female will be gifted to him when we get back to the barn. As any man or woman enjoys physical relations so does this horse below me!&quot; said Denber.<br />
<br />
Hardly without a nudge of Denber's heels the large stallion bolted off to the barn and his waiting passions.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood there caught between his wish to see little Johnny and going to beg Zepar to remove his power and return those he'd changed back to their human forms.<br />
<br />
Walking slowly up the hill and through the thick underbrush Jeff heard some distant voices.<br />
<br />
Walking as fast as he could up the steep incline toward the old museum and where Zepar stood caged from doing all his desired evil upon the world.<br />
<br />
As Jeff reached the rear of the barn and museum he peered in through the windows.<br />
<br />
The black tile floor shone the reflections of old cars and those huge glowing yellow eyes of the crablike demon Zepar.<br />
<br />
Then the voices from above inside the barn, it was Sheriff Baker and Jeff's Dad! They were out hunting for Jeff as if he was an escaped convict. Words of both men were in anger as they ransacked the upper floor of the old barn. Jeff knew it would only be a matter of time before they searched into the museum and would then come face to face with Zepar and his evil bag of tricks.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to look across the open valley below and saw the herd of beef cattle grazing. The distant buildings of Mr. Denber's farm, and his silver steel roofs glistened in the late afternoon sunlight.<br />
<br />
A passing thought as to be what Mr. Denber said and have himself join the animals of a farm. As Mr. Boot now found peace in being a Belgian draft horse and little Johnny the lust of becoming a mature bull, he pondered even if he should become a hog as punishment for what he'd done so far.<br />
<br />
&quot;Slam bam!&quot; came the sound Jeff remembered as the thick wooden door leading from the barn above to the museum below.<br />
<br />
Again he peered in through the window as reflections of Sheriff Baker's flashlight flickered about over the black floor of the museum.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched in silence as the two men walked about looking at the old vintage cars. They had not seen Zepar yet as with their entrance to the museum the demon closed his eyes and made like a statue.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Dad!&quot; groaned Jeff as his father was walking very close toward the quite caged demon Zepar.<br />
<br />
Jeff's Father had not noticed Zepar's eyes open slowly, ready to reach over the moat of Holy water keeping the demon at bay. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey DAD !&quot; yelled Jeff turning the two men's attention toward the outside windows.<br />
<br />
Both men scurried out the museum as Zepar's eyes blinked and flashed his disgust at Jeff. Then as if he knew what was to happen the smile of Zepar showed bright white fang teeth which made a reflection of over that black shinny tile floor.<br />
<br />
Jeff expected his Dad and Sheriff Baker to come out and around the barn to find him. Yet as Jeff walked up to the corner of the huge barn he heard many voices coming his way.<br />
<br />
&quot;There he is grab that bastard kid!&quot; yelled one of the Sheriff's donut eater Deputy's.<br />
<br />
Like an angry herd of wild beasts the Deputy and several angry men stormed down the hillside. Jeff stood in horror as the men grabbed him and a couple slugged his face with bare knuckled fists.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's my son!&quot; yelled Jeff's Dad from up the hill.<br />
<br />
&quot;We got this demon bate!&quot; yelled an angered man from the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did I ever do to you?&quot; cried out Jeff as the blood trickled down from the injury of being slugged in the mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do? You lousey little monster, you made my dear wife into a common Ass, that's what!&quot; obviously said by a Mister Anguster the husband of Jeff's homeroom teacher.<br />
<br />
The click of handcuffs snapped over Jeff's wrists as the Sheriff pulled Jeff's father away from the angered mob. The group of men punched and kicked Jeff as they took out the fear and hate on his young body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, huh ugg, huh, please I didn't mean to harm anybody!&quot; screamed Jeff as fists and boots worked his body into pain.<br />
<br />
Yet the fear of those men saw only anger over what Jeff had done. They were willing to kill the boy as if that would help those his powers had made into animals.<br />
<br />
It was as the Deputy kicked Jeff upside his face the boy thought to fight back in the only way he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop this, stop you are all just a bunch of stinking wild hogs!&quot; yelled a desperate injured boy.<br />
<br />
Even before the echo of his words faded away the Deputy and his partners fell to their knees. Each man grabbed for his own throat as gutteral sounds of a hog was coming out each one's mouth.<br />
<br />
Suddenly as Jeff sat there the men who were attacking him now had a fight of personal survival on each their own hands. One looked at the other changing and squeals of anguish and fear now echoed the valley.<br />
<br />
Fingers knarled into knotted fists as a blackness oozed over them making cloven hooves out of human appendages. Groaning as their male part changed and sheaths swelled making long screw shaped penis' strain out in rigid painful erections. Changing hands almost hooves grabbed crotches as the pains of straining growth of testicles made each man squeal out of pain.<br />
<br />
The tearing out shirts made each man look at his friend while man after man's chest bulged out in huge piggy boar form. Soon each man lay on his changing back with feet and four legs kicking into the air. <br />
<br />
Grunting and squealing of the fear no doubt all the men felt as they were without the power to fight the horrid change. Jeff seeing this quandry to pain and agony he'd leveled onto these men rolled up to a kneeling position.<br />
<br />
Hands cuffed behind his back Jeff struggled to stand up as the last of each man who had attacked him finished the transfer from human to swine.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood there as the large bristled hog boars milled about him as if captured minds were begging for return to what they once had been. A chuckle came out of Jeff as he felt appeased by these men becoming hogs. He remembered an old painting he'd seen in the Chicago Museum of Art last summer. The painting was if the Greek witch Circe sitting above a sty filled with transformed men as swine. She was tossing them berrys and acorns to eat and laughing at their horrid plight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your all Hogs, bristly, wild, and wanting of food, now go to Mister Denber's farm and live your lives as the boar hogs your going to be forever!&quot; ordered Jeff.<br />
<br />
As if understood and having nowhere else to turn the eight big boars ran down the brush covered path to the pasture below. <br />
<br />
Jeff turning round and round saw the Deputy's key ring and reaching for it he soon had the handcuffs removed.<br />
<br />
The bold laugh of a pleased Zepar came from inside the barn museum. As Jeff heard it his thoughts turned again to what Mister Denber said as &quot;Demon or Devils they always win!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now affraid Jeff ran up the hill toward where he'd watched the Sheriff drag his Dad away lest he too got into the brawl. As jeff topped the hill he looked around. <br />
<br />
Three squad cars with red lights strobbing stood near the barn. A pickup truck stood with doors open and motor running. Jeff saw his Dad's car setting behind all the others but no sign of the Sheriff or his Dad.<br />
<br />
The breeze whistled around Jeff's head making hearing difficult. He stood looking around and listening for the sound of voices, his Dad or the Sheriff's.<br />
<br />
A look at the barn noted a padlock clipped to the latch making sure nobody could get into the barn. Jeff knew niether his Dad or the Sheriff would have locked themselves inside so they had to be around somewhere?<br />
<br />
Checking around the side of the barn there was no way to walk down the opposite side of the steep hill as it was all loose round stones. Jeff turned and looked back at the cars and trucks parked by the corral and barn.<br />
<br />
Then Jeff bent forward and looked extra hard at his Dad's new Lincoln. The car seemed to move or rock a little, maybe Dad was inside?<br />
<br />
Jeff ran over to the car and with the blackened windows could not see inside so he popped open a door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God No!&quot; yelled Jeff as in the backseat was a large brisled boar hog, Sheriff Baker. As Jeff whenced in fear of the sight he leaned to look at the front seat area.<br />
<br />
Forelegs and cloven hooves hung over the back of the front seat was undoubtedly Jeff's father also a large bristled boar hog.<br />
<br />
Sheriff Baker was very angered by his new state and jumped from the backseat out of the car and stood oinking and squealing his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't mean for you to be Hogs!&quot; cried out a scared Jeff.<br />
<br />
A thud and scramble inside the car had Jeff's Father now a grown and well muscled boar Hog too standing on all fours looking out the car door at his Son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad I'm sorry, I didn't want you to shange just those rotten guys kicking and beating me to be Hogs! Dad, please Dad beleive me!&quot; begged Jeff.<br />
<br />
A silence of those all there as each was deep in thought how their lives were just made different. Jeff was wondering how to get Zepar to allow all those changed to become human again.<br />
<br />
The Sheriff was worried over his family and if they would let him live at home being a boar Hog.<br />
<br />
Jeff's Father jumped from off the rear seat of his Lincoln car and stood looking up at his Son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grunt, oink, oink, sigh!&quot; came the sounds of a Hog from Jeff's Father.<br />
<br />
Jeff looking down then fell to his knees as then almost face to face with his much shorter Dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I'm sorry! I was granted this terrible cursed power by a demon named Zepar who is trapped in the museum part of that barn. I never meant for you or the Sheriff to become Hogs, really!&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
A soft sounding affectionate &quot;Oink!&quot; came from his Hog Father.<br />
<br />
&quot;My power works only one way and I might be able to bargin with the Demon to change you back, I hope!&quot; said Jeff as his own thoughts about the chances sounded unlikely to all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Squeal!&quot; screamed the exSheriff now a 300 pound boar Hog.<br />
<br />
Pawing the ground in a obviously inhuman and animal way the Hog was angered by Jeff's words.<br />
<br />
Jeff's Dad looked over his thick bristled shoulder as best a hog animal might. The Sheriff now Hog boar scramble his legs charging at Jeff with intent of doing great harm or maybe wanting supper.<br />
<br />
Quickly as any Father might Jeff's Hog boar Dad turned to defend his son. A wild scrambling brawl ensued of tusked boars fighting for the honor and reason to live. Jeff screamed at his Dad and then to Sheriff Baker but as they fought their humanity was slipping away.<br />
<br />
Jeff's Father won with a slicing cut along the throat of the exSheriff. As blood gushed forth the dying beast squealed an groaning cry and laid there motionless.<br />
<br />
&quot;You saved me Dad, you killed him!&quot; said Jeff feeling safe for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, oh God no Dad!&quot; yelled a terrified Jeff as his Father now a bestial boar Hog began to rip and bite chunks of flesh from the dead hog's body.    <br />
  <br />
Screaming and running in mad circles Jeff could only stand and watch as his previous Father now Hog devoured the Hog he'd killed. The oinks and squeals soon brought back to the scene the eight other changed men now Hogs as the wild herd did eat there one time friend.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat by inside the backseat of his Dad's new Lincoln as the feast died down and one by one the satisfied and filled Hogs wandered off toward the pasture again.<br />
<br />
Snuffling and terrorized by what he witnessed Jeff sat with legs tucked tight to his chest, fingers interlocked and tear popping out anguished eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Snork, grunt oink, oink!&quot; Jeff's Dad having calmed down his face still covered with dried blood of the victim stood oggling at his Son.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to face his Father, but then feeling such fear over what he caused the boy slammed the door shut blocking out any sight of his boar Hog Dad.<br />
<br />
An anguished cry of a fearful man's mind locked into a crude bristled form of a boar Hog was the last Jeff heard from his father. Changed into a beast, his wild feasting of flesh, and the call of that wilderness took hold driving the baor to join his new friends.<br />
<br />
A tight little ball of human boy was found the next morning still huddled inside the rear seat of a new lincoln stinking of pig urine and droppings.<br />
<br />
Jeff's Mother was there with a State Police officer and what was to be a crime scene investigation team.</p>
