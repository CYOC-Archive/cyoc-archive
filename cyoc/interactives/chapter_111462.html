<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh GAWD Eric,” Spencer screaming; “I’m coming!”<br />
“Same here,” Frieda gasping.<br />
<br />
Just like before Spencer, Eric and Frieda were in the throes of their unique style of rutting. Frieda lying on the bottom while Spencer was above; her muzzle shoved into Frieda’s furry cunt. All the while Eric mounted and thrusting inside of Spencer. Frieda was using her tongue to lap up the juices leaking from Spencer&#39;s twat; plus tickle and massage Eric furry balls dangling just above her.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s furious thrusting, making way with a loud yowl as he blows his load in Spencer. The barbs on his feline cock flexing and digging into her canal; Spencer moans and yowls as her own body shudders and spasms. With her muzzle at Frieda’s sex, she nips at Frieda’s clit. This sending the were-panthress over the edge; she too yowls as her own orgasm rocks her body.<br />
<br />
With their green feline like eyes flashing; the three not only experience each other’s orgasms, but like before they are treated to seeing what the other is seeing through their eyes as if they were seeing it themselves. Eric seeing his own penis buried in Spencer’s snatch. His and her fluids leaking out, thanks to Frieda staring at the two sexes joined together. Spencer looking at the head board infront of her; unable to move as she loses herself to the orgasmic bliss she is experiencing. Eric’s panting; he stares at Spencer’s black furred back, his breath parting the fur briefly. As each blink they are treated to each image; enjoying the view as they slowly come down from their climaxing.<br />
<br />
“Guess, it wasn’t a onetime thing,” Eric pulling out of Spencer and help her to lie down; “seeing what you two are seeing-”<br />
“We should keep this to ourselves,” Frieda getting up; “my parents still not understanding this bond of ours, they might freak out if we try to describe this.”<br />
“I wonder if we can only see what the other sees,” Spencer sighing; “during sex? Or could this be based on our empathic ability to sense each other’s emotions?”<br />
“Interesting question,” Frieda getting off the bed and standing up; “perhaps we should experiment. I’ll head into my private bathroom and you two try to see what I’m looking at.”<br />
<br />
As Eric and Spencer watch Frieda enter her bathroom and close the door; they wait a few minutes until they hear her say ready. As both concentrate, thinking only of Frieda; they spend several minutes trying to sense Frieda’s emotional state and use that as a means to connect with her. Not getting anything; Eric gets up and knocks on the door; “we tried Frieda. We can’t see whatever it is you are seeing.”<br />
<br />
Frieda walking out of her bathroom; the grey furred were-panthress with russet highlights sashays out of the washroom, her tail swaying behind her.<br />
“I was staring at my hair dryer,” Frieda looking glum.<br />
“Guess it’s a sexual only thing then,” Spencer shrugging her shoulders.<br />
“The view is great,” Eric responding; &quot;being able to see myself lodged in one of yours snatch through the eyes of the other is a sight to behold.”<br />
“On that I agree,” Frieda hugging her white furred were panther from behind; placing her paws on Eric’s flaccid member.<br />
“Are we up for round four now,” Eric purring at Frieda’s touch.<br />
“Not without me you’re not,” Spencer leaping off of the bed and joining Eric and Frieda.<br />
“Okay,” Eric grinning through his white furred were-panther muzzle; “what do we do next?”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
After debating that a quick snack and run through the woods would be just the thing; Eric, Spencer and Frieda come running down stairs. Entering the kitchen, each reeking of their sexual exploits as they come face to face with Benton and Amanda. The two were-panthers each drinking coffee; staring at the three young weres.<br />
“So what are you three about to do now,” Benton sips his coffee; “as if I don’t already know.”<br />
“we’re getting a snack and about to go out for a run,” Frieda rummaging through the fridge and seeing a package of bologna, cheese and assorted condiments.<br />
“So you’re not going to go hunting,” Amanda chiming in.<br />
“It could turn into a hunt,” Spencer grabbing a loaf of bread; “but it will most likely be a catch and release hunt.”<br />
“Catch and release,” Amanda looking curious; “just what is that?”<br />
“You catch your quarry,” Eric helping to make bologna sandwiches; “and then you let the animal go.”<br />
“Want to join,” Frieda looking at her parents as she eats her sandwich.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure,” Amanda staring at her daughter; “it doesn’t sound like our thing.<br />
“Sure,” Benton finishing off his coffee; “I guess a game of cat and mouse with a deer seems like fun.”<br />
“Your going;” Amanda looking like she swallowed something sour.<br />
“Why not,” Benton looking back at his wife; “it’s not as if our daughter and her friends are going to do anything violent. Come along,” Benton staring at Amanda; “it sounds like a great way to burn off that stress and anger you have in you.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Running through the woods the black furred were-panthress was purposely keeping a discreet distance from her husband Benton and their daughter as they race through the woods with Eric and Spencer; chasing down a large buck, a ten pointer from the look of things. Hearing Benton laugh as the commotion ahead of her dies down; Amanda approaches to see Frieda pinning the large male deer on the snow covered forest floor. Benton smiling a whooping in joy after witnessing his daughter jump and catch the terrified creature.<br />
“Did you see it Amanda,” Benton smiling and laughing; “our daughter caught the beast by her own paws.”<br />
“I heard it,” Amanda looking at her daughter stroking the buck; trying to calm it down.<br />
“Dam,” Eric approaching Frieda and the buck she is holding onto; “that was fast.”<br />
“You didn’t even give us time to catch the bucks scent,” Spencer placing a paw on the buck and rubbing it gently; “still, not a bad catch.”<br />
“Okay,” Amanda staring at the three; ”You had your fun, now let the poor animal go.”<br />
“You mean we can’t keep him as a pet,” Frieda teasing her mother.<br />
“Definitely not,” Benton chuckling; “now come on, let’s go home. By now you three should feel ready for bed.”<br />
<br />
Frieda lets go of the buck as she gets up; watching the animal rush and run away from the large group of predatory weres. Joining Eric and Spencer as they are followed behind by Amanda and Benton; the five enjoy their walk back to the estate. Benton and Amanda holding each other’s paw as they stare at their daughter; her tail and Eric’s twirling around Spencer’s tail. Amanda couldn’t help but crack a smile; seeing her daughter in love, despite it being with both a boy and a girl, Amanda couldn’t help but wrap her were-panther tail around Benton’s.<br />
“I guess we are going to have a little bedroom fun after all,” Benton purring and embracing his wife.<br />
“Well,” Amanda smiling; “I can’t exactly stay mad at you. Even if you were right that I owe some apologies to a certain were-tigress.”<br />
<br />
Benton doesn’t respond, he just purrs as he enjoys how quiet the forest has gotten lately; so quiet he walks into Spencer standing still as her ears twitch.<br />
“What’s wrong,” Benton asking.<br />
“We’re being stalked,” Spencer growling; “and its hungry.”<br />
Benton and Amanda sniff the air; picking up the scent of a wild cougar, both were-panthers growl menacingly as they scan the surrounding area for the predator that thinks it could make a meal out of them. Eric, Spencer and Frieda also growl; their green eyes flashing as they rapidly scan the area as well.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the creature leaps from a tree branch above; trying to land on Frieda. Benton seeing the creature attacking his daughter roars with rage as he quickly reacts; swiping the animal with a paw, ensuring his retractable claws bite and dig in the flesh. The cougar now in plain view; all can see that it is nothing but bare bones. Mad with hunger, desperate and a broken arrow jutting from its flank; the creature lunges again. Benton getting between the cougar and the three children, he grabs the beast and drags it to the ground. Struggling as the cougar violently struggles with the large were-panther; there is a sudden whimper as Benton snaps the neck of the cougar ending its suffering.<br />
<br />
“Amanda get the children back to the house now,” Benton looking at the broken arrow jutting from the dead creatures flank. “Contact the police and animal control,” Benton picking up the dead cougar; “tell them what happened.”<br />
“What is that sticking out of the cat dad,” Frieda looking genuinely concerned.<br />
“An arrow,” Benton helping to escort the three back; “judging by the festering smell from the wound-“<br />
“The cougar was shot by poachers,” Spencer finishing the sentence while looking at the broken arrow; “about six days ago.”<br />
“There is a tag on the ear,” Eric seeing the dead cat slung over Benton’s shoulders; “the cougar could also have a GPS tracking chip lodge under its fur.”<br />
“Let the authorities deal with that Eric,” Amanda answering; “lets just get you three back inside were it is safe.”</p>
