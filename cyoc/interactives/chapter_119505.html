<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I choose…I choose…” was all Jennifer found herself repeating as the clock ran down to zero.<br />
<br />
“You chose both apparently” Kyle said smugly from the other side of the line.<br />
<br />
“Oh shut up twerp! I mean, what was my choice really? I choose dare and I’d probably get pulled into a sick sex fantasy by some freshman I don’t know. That, or I choose transform and get turned into who knows what?” Jennifer shot back, shaking a little with anger, but unable to slam the phone down.<br />
<br />
“So you couldn’t make up your mind between the two and end up taking both? I mean, if either of those things were my objective, I’d say you would have just made your situation worse.” Jennifer now felt a cold shiver run down her spine as she realized the power she had just given the younger boy. However, Kyle continued with a lighter, less threatening tone. “Well you should be thankful that I am more of a karma and justice person than a weird sex freak looking to destroy someone for just dropping my pants in front of the school. I mean, I know it could have been worse. Take your former boyfriend for example. Brad is known for just beating the crap out of anyone he wants and then having his dad just pay off the victims.”<br />
<br />
“W-what do you mean former boyfriend? Brad and I are still going out.” And then an idea struck Jennifer. “And you had better watch out with how you curse me! You know I could call Brad up right after this call and send him your way!”<br />
<br />
“Well” Kyle began, “you could if Brad was still Brad.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt her stomach turn. She knew Kyle had the curse, but she didn’t know how he had gotten it, how long he had it, or who else could be involved. She was frightened to ask her next question, but she needed to know the answer. “What did you do to Brad?” she asked meekly.<br />
<br />
She heard another voice in the background, obviously not Kyle’s mocking her. “What happened to Brad? What happened to Brad? What happened to dickhead?” And then she heard Kyle hush the other male before continuing with her. “Like I said, I’m a justice and karma kind of person, so let’s just say that Brad will probably be the person who needs protecting from bullies rather than being the bully. But enough about former Brad, let’s talk about you and what you get to look forward to.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn’t make a sound anymore other than her breathing, which Kyle could hear and took as his sign to continue. “You see Jennifer, I actually know you a bit better than my friends who were also looking to have you suffer something far worse. You should be thankful for that. Thankful that I know you didn’t really become a bitch until you became a cheerleader in your freshman year. Thankful that I know you were only asked to be a cheerleader because of your looks. You’ve developed this nasty confidence that allows you to think you can push anyone around, sleep with anyone you want, and just generally pretend like the feelings of others just don’t exist. We need to change that nasty, mean spirited confidence. Maybe then we can see the return of that girl some of us knew. Well, I may be using the term girl a little loosely here.”<br />
<br />
The last sentence struck her curiosity enough to give her the ability to ask another question. “What do you mean girl is a lose term?” The words came out shaky as she hoped for a positive answer.<br />
<br />
Kyle sighed and continued. “Jennifer, let me tell you something about myself that will explain what is going to happen to you. You see, I’m trans. I was born a boy, but I’ve always felt like a girl. Because of this there has been a lot of hardship in my life. People think I like boys because they think I’m gay. I don’t like the person I see in the mirror every day. Even worse, my family doesn’t have the money yours does, so when I came out to my parents I found out that we are too poor to afford hormone treatment on our own, but my parents make too much for us to get any kind of subsidy. However, when I am done with you, the last part of my curse takes effect and that won’t be a problem.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s ability to be annoyed was slowly overcoming her fear. She didn’t care what all this trans stuff was, or that Kyle apparently found a way to change his situation. She just wanted to know what her fate was so she could get on with life. “Okay, so your trans, and soon you won’t be. What does that have to do with me?”<br />
<br />
She heard Kyle laugh just a little before he continued. “It has everything with who you will be. Being trans prevented me from building up a strong confidence, and I guess you could say it stopped me from developing any bad attitudes. Sounds like the perfect fix for someone, now doesn’t it?” Jennifer felt her heart drop as she was now understanding just what Kyle was talking about. She didn’t have time to respond before Kyle began to seal her fate. “Jennifer Smith, for your transformation, you will become a trans girl freshmen who came out to her parents when ‘he’ was 12. You were originally born Johnathan Smith, but changed your name to Jennifer when your parents re-enrolled you in school. This transformation will affect your whole life up till this moment, but you will keep your original memories of being Jennifer. This doesn’t mean that you won’t have memories of your new trans life, but let’s just say your old memories are more vivid for the purpose of reminding you where you fell from. As for your dare, I dare you to not be able to use the curse for a week, and when you do gain the ability to pass it on, you will do everything you can to stop yourself or others from returning you back to this exact life or something very close to it before you truly feel deep down that you have learned your lesson. Goodbye, Jennifer. Maybe I’ll see you at school.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer heard two boys laughing in the background and what sounded like Kyle’s voice laughing while becoming higher pitched before the phone click. Slowly she hung up her phone and waited. After a minute, she started feeling better. Nothing was happening. Maybe the curse wasn’t real after all. Jennifer stood up with renewed confidence, and tried taking a step to go on with her morning. And then she felt sick. Dizzy sick. Gut wrenching sick. Hot sweats and cold sweats sweeping across her in waves. Jennifer quickly spun around and buried her face into her bed in an effort to stop the dizziness and prevent vomiting. There she rested as minutes crept passed while her body and world spun.<br />
<br />
Finally everything stopped, and the world was still once again. Feeling relief, Jennifer stood up, but instantly felt new difference…saw new differences. The first was the mess of brown-auburn hair that fell into her sight. She had dyed her hair blonde years ago when she first became a cheerleader, so it was strange seeing her original hair color returned to her. Next, Jennifer pull her hair back and from her eyes to reveal her new room. Just a few minute ago she had been standing in a typical girly-girly room of a cheerlead captain. Now she stood in a toned down, mostly gender neutral room, with a computer and plain oak dressers. Looking to her night stand, she saw a collection of pill bottles. “My hormones?” she questioned allowed.<br />
<br />
As if to answer the question, new memories flooded in beside her originals. Those bottles were indeed her hormones and testosterone blockers. She remembered starting her HRT around 13, and just in time to stop puberty from doing more to change her body in the “wrong way”. Jennifer shook her head at the last thought. Body changing in the wrong way? But then it hit her, Jennifer looked down at her now 15 year old body, and there were some obvious changes from the last time she was this age.<br />
<br />
Taking a look at her chest first, her breast looked to be about the B-cup they should have been at this age, but they didn’t feel that full. Reaching a hand up, Jennifer unclasped the padded bra and let it fall to the ground, revealing perky A-cups grown from her pills. This was the first sight that really drove home what had just happened to her, but it would not be the most dramatic as she felt something new but familiar twitch around in the shorts she was now wearing.<br />
<br />
She knew what was there, and it wasn’t like she wanted to look, but she had to. Taking a step in front of her full-length mirror, Jennifer took a deep breath before dropping the shorts and underwear. Out sprung her small, shaved, and surprisingly feminine penis followed by a smooth ball sack. Being freed of its trappings, Jennifer’s member quickly hardened to 5”. And with this, all Jennifer could do was look at her now naked 15 year old trans body in mirror. She was definitely feminine enough that everyone at school would think she had always been a girl…but the small breast, the reduced hips and butt, and most of all her dick…<br />
<br />
“What the hell am I going to do now?” was the only thought she could conjure as she stood naked, and very hard.</p>
