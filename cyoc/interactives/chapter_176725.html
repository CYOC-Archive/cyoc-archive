<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was Danny deciding to go out for some cardio that weekend that would end up bringing him into contact with the jocks again.<br />
<br />
Danny took off his shirt in advance of it, looked out and checked his computer for the day&#39;s temperature. Noting it was 85 degrees, he grinned and thought about all the babes he could be impressing with his buffed out bod. It wouldn&#39;t do to keep dwelling on the ex. Let her keep on spreading that transformation and increasingly regret her decisions. Danny wanted to enjoy his life. Setting up his cellphone with a calorie tracker, he got a small bag ready by his side to hold both his phone and a bottle of water.<br />
<br />
Didn&#39;t wanna go out and hit cardio without making sure he was well stocked in his water supply!<br />
<br />
He noted as he went that Jin was wearing a tank top today - maybe because of the heat, maybe because his biceps were looking more pumped today than usual - and he complimented him as he passed by, &quot;Arms are looking pretty good today man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, thanks. Haven&#39;t really been doing much for them lately...&quot; He seemed confused by the growth, &quot;But whatever&#39;s going on, I can&#39;t say I can complain about it.&quot; He pumped a bicep flex, and Danny grinned and answered it with one of his own before heading on out.<br />
<br />
He usually maintained something of a jogging speed. Danny didn&#39;t want to overexert and burn muscle along with calories. He also didn&#39;t want to go so slowly that his body acclimated and kept its storages. So a jog it was. Danny found himself winking at some passing interested women, who seemed unable to keep their eyes off of his build. Fuckin&#39; A, Asian Adonis, Danny thought as he waved at the passersby...<br />
<br />
As he passed by someone else, he felt a sudden smack at his ass, and he looked around, seeing the woman walking by giggling. &quot;You wanna fuck me later?&quot; Danny said under his breath, but he wasn&#39;t out here today to get some sex. He was here to exercise! ...And setting up some future encounters was a side benefit. Sunning his hide, and showing off his buffed out body...who could blame the folks around here for getting thirsty?<br />
<br />
As Danny kept going he passed by two girls from his school who seemed to be chatting about something;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Trish, have you seen Terry at his house? Sunning himself like that? He never did that before!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you like how Terry&#39;s looking? You know he does, Beth.&quot; <br />
<br />
Both then laughed and - scoping out Danny all the while - kept walking on. Danny heard this all and contemplated. He knew he should keep at least some distance to make it a little less obvious. He didn&#39;t know going into this if Gabe or Terry might realize what was up. And it was the next day from such a charged day as yesterday, so... Danny didn&#39;t even know going in how those two would be acting or what was gonna be up with them.<br />
<br />
Well, nothing ventured nothing gained.<br />
<br />
Danny went ahead and started heading to where those girls had been walking from, trusting that they would&#39;ve been close by wherever Terry would&#39;ve been sunning himself evidently. This would be a great day for that kind of tanning, and Danny in fact hoped to do so later as well, as soon as he was done. But now that he knew about this, he couldn&#39;t very well keep himself from investigating how Gabe and Terry had changed so far today.<br />
<br />
As Danny approached evidently where Terry lived he guessed, he started to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
Set up out front of a large, generous two story house with a car outfront was a large white towel with a water jug with several ice cubes inside. And set up on that white towel was Danny guessed Terry going by how they&#39;d been acting. Terry staying more bold and showy whereas he guessed Gabe was much more reserved now. Approaching, he saw the differences...<br />
<br />
Terry&#39;s body had become tighter and more toned again, but in a distinctly more &quot;impressive to so inclined men&quot; way. His face seemed softer and cuter despite the confident sneer plastered over it as Terry enjoyed the attention and show he got to put on. His pecs were very nicely muscled but the nipples stood out quite well. His hair seemed longer and straighter somewhat, and looked a little darker. His body seemed to be a little more naturally tanned. And...were Terry&#39;s eyes slightly different in their look?<br />
<br />
Danny tilted his head and observed. It was also clear that Terry was wearing nothing but a pair of white short shorts. So it was clear Terry very much felt like he had a lot he wanted to show off. By now Terry tilted his head and propped himself up on one arm to see that Danny was standing there. Keeping his smirk on, Terry asked, &quot;Ohh hey Danny! You like what you see? The local girls do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh, just noticed you were really putting yourself on display...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why shouldn&#39;t I?&quot; Terry said as he crossed his legs, &quot;I&#39;m a sexy fucker. And that&#39;s something I could say for you too, bro.&quot; Terry paused and seemed to look around, &quot;Damn, we&#39;re two of the sexiest fucking guys at this school...you up for tanning with me today bro? I don&#39;t think ANYBODY could resist going for both of us on display.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seemed Terry was a little nervous, but not much. He was growing much more at home with how he was behaving. Danny considered it, looking at Terry, wondering where Gabe ran off to and then decided...</p>
