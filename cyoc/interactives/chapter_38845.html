<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry lay on his bed, wondering how he could use the blackberry to make his life any better. He certainly didn't want to be female, so changing his sex and gender was pretty much out. He could think of nothing wrong with being human, so change his species wasn't going to work. &quot;What is it that makes my life so damn miserable,&quot; Henry thought to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps a shower will help me think,&quot; he said as he got up.<br />
<br />
Stripping off his clothes, he walked across the room, naked as the day he was born and disappeared into the bathroom for the next ten to fifteen minutes.<br />
<br />
A towel wrapped around his waist, he came out and choose to sit in one of the chairs next to a table. Leaning just a little, he could see outside past the drawn curtains. Picking up the blackberry were he'd left it, Henry pulled up his profile.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I can't think of anything, perhaps I should just make myself smarter,&quot; he told himself.<br />
<br />
He was looking at his profile, trying to find the section that dealt with how smart he was when he stumbled onto the area dealing with hid strength. Curious about it, he changed it so that if he wanted to he could crumble Titanium Adamantium into a fine powder. &quot;That's if the second one actually existed and you could actually meld the two together,&quot; he thought as he saved the new configuration.<br />
<br />
His body didn't change, but his mind did. Suddenly he had new memories growing up and how he was taught not draw attention to himself because of how inhumanly strong he was. And his strength only grew as he grew, so he kept getting stronger each day. &quot;Interesting,&quot; Henry thought as he flexed his muscles.<br />
<br />
He noticed his body hadn't changed any and so to test to see if anything had really change, he stood, let the towel drop to the floor and walked over to the bed. Laying on the floor, he slid under the bed and then proceeded to bench press it. Standing, he set the other bed on top, piled the chairs and table on top and lying down once again, began to bench press that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fascinating,&quot; was all Henry could think of as he put all the furniture back and sat back down at the table with the blackberry.<br />
<br />
Liking this already, he quickly, but delicately, found the information about his intelligence and wisdom. He changed it so that he used fifty percent of his brain instead of ten and pushed his intelligence up to seven hundred and seventy seven. &quot;Seems like a nice round number,&quot; Henry told himself.<br />
<br />
Pushing the save button once again, he doubled over in pain as the inside of his brain nearly exploded. New memories overloaded and erased the old ones as he realized once again he was raised differently. He may have be uber-smart, and getting smarter as each day passed, but he was also taught how to hide it so he didn't draw attention. There was that and the psionic powers he now had.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Henry found that he could remember growing up on the farm his father owned and how he could do strange things. He could move things with his mind, hear and process other people's thoughts, he could even, on several occasions, bend reality itself. One time he got lost in the woods and it was only later that he realized that the woods he'd gotten lost in, where in an identical dimension of earth. &quot;I'm a dimension walker,&quot; Henry thought excitedly.<br />
<br />
He looked at the blackberry and suddenly he had the next thing to alter. He changed his age to eight and switched his growth pattern to 'Matures quickly, but ages slowly'. Next he typed in 'Mom and dad are the same way. Twenty human years is roughly one year for Henry, his parents and any other family member. Belongs to a race that is humanoid in appearance, but has long forgotten their species name. Henry was born some time in late nineteenth century. Species has connections to large monetary wealth, no matter were they are living. Species has dropped in population due to an increase in life expectancies. As he grows older, Henry's aging process will begin to slow until about age seventeen, he will be immortal, but his strength, maturity and intelligence will continue to grow'. Feeling confident that everything was in order, Henry pushed the save button.<br />
<br />
Immediately he was overcome by pain both by his brain as new memories flooded in and from his body as is began to twist and shrink down to that of a eight year old. He shut his eyes and curled himself up into a fetal position, hoping that the pain would end soon and it did. Sliding off the chair, Henry suddenly realized that his whole life had been reworked.<br />
<br />
He no longer worked for the bureau, but in fact traveling with his parents, who wanted to show him how to fully explore his minds powers, his strength and intelligence. Plus they wanted him to learn more about his species.<br />
<br />
Still holding the blackberry, Henry headed for the bathroom. Inside, he climbed up onto the sink and gazed into the mirror. Reflected back was an eight year old version of himself and he marveled at how young he looked. Sitting down on the sink, he thought about it and the punched in some new commands. The instant he hit save, a pain could be felt in his spine as a bushy fox tail formed. His center of balance shifted and new memories floated in that told him this was a rare feature that happens in some of his species; some are born with tails. In his case, it was a fox tail.<br />
<br />
Curious still, Henry looked over the blackberry, his eight year old mind slowly taking over. He wanted to know if mommy, whom he'd seen naked accidentally once, experienced the world differently. Leaving his sex and gender as male, he typed in the commands that he was born with a females vulva and reproductive organs.<br />
<br />
Hitting save, failing to see his sex and gender had shifted to F, Henry set blackberry down and watched in amazement as his penis and testicles shrank and then folded up into his body. As the area between his, now her, legs split apart, a tickling sensation in the abdomen made Henry think of a flower opening as it announced the growth of the new reproductive organs. Immediately new hormones and chemicals began to flood the body and Henry, now Henrietta, began to see the world in a new view.<br />
<br />
She wanted to forget the blackberry and go play with her dolls. Pretend to be their mother and have a tea party with them. At the same time, she realized that she was here with her mother and father to learn. Picking up the blackberry, she thought about it and the gave herself a matching pair of fox ears. As the new ears formed and her old ones disappeared, an idea formed and she saved and locked her profile, making sure no one could ever access it.<br />
<br />
Next she slid off the sink and headed into the room she was sharing with her mom and dad. Getting dressed in a denim skirt, Hello Kitty underwear, a white long sleeved Angelina Ballerina shirt, socks and shoes, she knew she was supposed to meet them in the lobby.<br />
<br />
Taking the elevator down, she paused before entering the lobby. Scanning the crowd with her mind, she selected a person and handing them the blackberry, told them in a mature voice, &quot;You can use this to make yourself happy. When you're done, pass it along to someone else.&quot; Leaving the vary confused human, Henrietta flipped her long dark red hair back and skipped into the lobby were mom and dad were waiting to give her the next lesson.</p>
