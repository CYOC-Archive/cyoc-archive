<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I found the keys to the apartment in a small bag hung on the desk chair. They rested there with a chaotic mess of random objects one might expect in a woman&#39;s bag: some tissues, a chapstick, some spare change, my driving licence (apparently my name was now Amy), two spare tampons (which I hoped I won&#39;t have to use), two packets of unscented lube (which I hoped even more I wouldn&#39;t have to use), and a weird plastic cylindrical item which I didn&#39;t immediately recognize.<br />
<br />
My the main door I found some flat strap sandals which I put on my feet (only now realizing how small they were - a size 2.5 according to the shoes). I locked the door (&quot;This is one high doorknob!&quot;) and with the bag hung down my shoulder proceeded to head to the exit.<br />
<br />
As I walked down the stairway I started to realize a couple things. Firstly, even though my breasts weren&#39;t really big enough to bounce very much, I clearly felt the lack of the bra in the way my nipples rubbed against the fabric of my dress. I could definitely see how might become annoying after a while. Secondly I&#39;ve come to realize how little I knew about Daniel, whom I made my boyfriend.<br />
<br />
I knew that him and Liz, my ex-girlfriend, were good friends. They had a casual fling once upon a time, but that ended quickly because, according to Liz, he was looking for a much more serious relationship than she. I&#39;ve personally met the guy once. He seemed like a decent dude, but we didn&#39;t exactly &#39;click&#39; as &#39;bros&#39;. He seemed like a too much of a lazy hippie type for me, a serious business man, to spend my time on. He was slightly shorter than me, but that was at the time when I occupied a 6&#39;2&#39;&#39; male body. He was considerably more bulky though. Apparently he had an affair with weightlifting back in high school, which showed, but since then he also let himself go a little and he gained a little pot belly. With his barrel chest he was kinda like a human-bear, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he had the body hair to match.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t quite think about who I&#39;ll be interacting with when I set my current height. Daniel was a foot and a bit taller tan Amy and two if not three times as heavy. I thought how easy it would be for him to pick me up and do whatever he wants to me. This made me feel weird. A stream of second thoughts about this entire &#39;adventure&#39; crossed my mind. Was this what I really wanted, this vacation from control? Now that I was there it didn&#39;t seem like as much as a great idea as it was when I was typing it into Chronivac. But with those thoughts also came another feeling, something almost-familiar. <br />
<br />
My heart was beating really hard in my chest and I felt slightly hot as my cheeks blushed. A muscle twitched somewhere in my pelvis. It kinda felt like, and now this will sound weird, the opposite of trying to hold in poop. Something down there relaxed, opened up a space to be filled. I felt &#39;sweaty&#39; down there and there was a kind of throbbing in my groin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap.&quot; I realized. &quot;I&#39;m getting turned on.&quot;<br />
<br />
I tried to dismiss the thoughts of our size difference and my supposed newly-acquired helplessness and my the first floor I managed to moderately compose myself. My heart was still beating like crazy though.<br />
<br />
I left the building feeling the fresh summer air on my skin (especially in my groin which, being moist, felt slightly chilly). Outside there was nobody to be seen. I looked to the left, then to the right and then...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey hottie!&quot; I heard a voice behind me. &quot;Nice buns.&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt something on my buttock. That &#39;something&#39; was no doubt a hand, but should hands be able to grasp an entire ass cheek? <br />
<br />
I turned around, or rather was spun around and in no time i felt my feet rising from the ground and the two sensitive spots on my chest being squished against someone else&#39;s vast expanse of human torso.<br />
<br />
Before I realized it, my mouth was being invaded by a foreign tongue, wrestling mine. My soft lips brushing against another set of lips. A slightly musky smell of man entered my nostrils.<br />
<br />
The &#39;opening&#39; feeling in my pelvis returned with increased strength. My female parts throbbed, getting wet. I could feel it clearly between my thighs. I was glad I was held up because my legs felt weak and I didn&#39;t know if my knees wouldn&#39;t buckle under my minuscule weight.<br />
<br />
I definitely wasn&#39;t in control now.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like eternity, the hand groping by butt moved to my waist, where it met another large hand. Together they pulled me away and gently placed on the ground. I opened my eyes and looked up. Then looked up some more. <br />
<br />
There he was. Daniel, my boyfriend.<br />
<br />
I had to seriously crane my neck up to look him in the eye. If I didn&#39;t I&#39;d be looking somewhere above his belly button.<br />
<br />
I was speechless. My mind was empty. The experience was simply too overwhelming to contain. I stared at his bearded face blankly. I probably had a stupid smile on my face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you babe&quot; he said cradling the back of my head in his hand and bringing me close to his chest for a hug. It felt like hugging a tree. How could he be just so... big?<br />
<br />
&quot;Come&quot; he broke the embrace and took my hand. &quot;Let&#39;s walk. I want to hear the news you wanted to tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit&quot; I thought. &quot;What fucking news?&quot;<br />
<br />
I was panicking inside, even more so that my body seemed calm now, just following the lead of Daniel&#39;s large hand holding my small one.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no news... honey&quot; I whispered. &quot;You must be imagining something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on!&quot; he replied &quot;I know you wanted to tell me the thing I wanted to hear for a while now&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but... I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about!&quot; I did not know what to do, what to say. My old eloquence seemed to be gone. At least when he was around.<br />
<br />
Daniel stopped walking. I stopped with him. He put his hands on my shoulders, turned me towards him and leaned in close to my face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, you know I don&#39;t like when you play games with me. I you weren&#39;t too keen on my idea of our life together but tough, I know we did it and I know you have a proof with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before I could parse what he was talking about he let me go and grabbed my bag. He seemed to be looking for something in the mess of my feminine accessory. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aha! There it is!&quot; he pulled out the plastic cylinder I was unable to identify earlier. He took it to his eye level and I saw his expression change to pure joy. <br />
<br />
At the same time my expression must have changed dramatically as I realized what was it that he was holding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally!&quot; he shouted throwing his arms in the air. &quot;I&#39;m gonna be a father!&quot;<br />
<br />
He tossed the positive pregnancy test into my hands. I started a the object with terror. That was it. I couldn&#39;t do it anymore. I needed to change back and I needed to change back NOW.</p>
