<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">      Lace struggled to twist his head around to get a better look at the scrap of fabric newly sewn into the back of his neck. The scrawny twenty-one year old doing his best to bend in ways he was never meant to. <br />
      Ten minutes ago he had woken up in a laundry basket in an unfamiliar apartment with one of the worst hangovers of his life. The last thing he could remember was the party, one his roommate dragged him to. …it was a house party. Not normally his scene, but he had been wanting to branch out more. “Fuck, how much did I drink.” he muttered to himself.<br />
      Slowly Lace&#39;s memories of the night came back to him. There was a girl… a cute one, what was her name? For the life of him he couldn&#39;t remember if he ever got it. But he&#39;d never forget her. She was tall and curvy, with long hair that had been dyed pink at one point but now her roots were coming in. Freckles across her face and tattoos across her body. “Fuck my taste in women.” Lace thought as he remembered more about her. <br />
      They had chatted a bit about video games and other nonsense and he thought they had hit it off. Later in the night however she seemed distressed. Lace had wondered why and offered to help however he could. He remembered the way her face lit up at the suggestion before being dragged off to a bedroom. The very last thing he remembered was her pointing her phone at him… <br />
      “Size: L body: 95% cotton 5% spandex, trim: 85% nylon 15% spandex machine wash warm with like colors…” Lace droned on as he read the text off that scrap of fabric; his care tag, he had a tag. <br />
      “I guess the line for the bathroom was pretty long.” She must have soiled herself waiting, and took his offer of help as permission to tf him. Judging by the strange taste in his mouth which he guessed was detergent he had been washed at least. “Still I wish she had let me keep my mind on. I got to be a total babe’s underwear and I can&#39;t even remember it.”<br />
***CRASH***<br />
      “Oh, my god, who the fuck are you?”<br />
Lace whipped around to see that same babe standing in the bathroom doorway clad in pajamas and a mug of coffee broken at her feet. “Whoa, whoa whoa! calm down” Lace instinctively covered himself. <br />
      “We met at the party last night, remember?” He tried desperately to calm her down as she backed away slowly. Her face grew into a scowl. “What are you talking about? I haven&#39;t been to a party in a week.”<br />
      Oh shit Lace had lost a whole week to being this bitch&#39;s undies. Suddenly a slight look of recognition played across her face. “Wait you&#39;re that guy I was talking to at Amber&#39;s last month. didn&#39;t you go missing?” A month?! A whole month of lost time, fuck, Lace is not looking forward to the makeup work. Wait missing? “Hold on, what do you mean missing are you telling me you don&#39;t remember?”<br />
      “Yeah missing. The cops were involved and everything. I blacked out at the party but like two days later there was police at my door asking about you. I guess I was the last person seen with you.” Lace could tell the woman still was cautious of him but there was a slight bit of curiosity in voice. <br />
      “Okay, listen you pissed yourself at that party.” She was immediately taken aback by the accusation. “First off gross, secondly what the fuck does that have to do with the naked missing person standing in my bathroom.”<br />
      “I&#39;m getting to that, jeez. You pissed yourself and needed clean underwear, and I kinda accidentally volunteered, look…” Lace turned around and lifted his hair to show her his tag. Almost immediately he felt her behind him tugging at it to read it. “huh no shit so that&#39;s where those panties came from.”<br />
      “Where&#39;d you think I came from?” She laughed. “I thought I hooked up with a girl and took a trophy home. So how was it?” <br />
Lace blushed as she was now holding onto his shoulder like they were old friends, her breast pressed tightly into his arm. “How was what?”<br />
      “Your little month-long vacation in my pants, c&#39;mon a guy like you must&#39;ve been having the time of his life.” Lace blushed further. “I don&#39;t know. You turned my mind off when you transformed me. It&#39;s like I just woke up from a long nap today.”<br />
      “Yeah that makes sense. I don&#39;t really like the idea of having a practical stranger all pressed up in my junk after all. well it was probably for the best.” Lace glanced up at her. “What do you mean?”<br />
      “I mean I put you through the ringer, you were comfy bro and cute too girlier than what I normally wear though. I was even starting to think you were my lucky panties. I mean, I wore you a lot.” she paused and lace noticed a smirk across her face. “you may or may not have gotten a front row seat to something more.” she whispered in his ear.<br />
      Lace shuttered a bit as he pictured the thought of her fucking another man in him. “You had sex in me?” She only laughed more. “Calm down, I only masturbated silly. Still I&#39;m happy I managed to wash out all the cum stains.” <br />
      Lace was at full mast which only served to embarrass him more, but the woman paid it no mind. She had started cleaning up the mug she broke. All of her earlier concern about Lace evaporated once she learned where he spent the last month. <br />
      “By the way, miss uhh. What&#39;s your name?” Lace asked embarrassed he didn’t even know the name of the woman who had emasculated him so much. “Ash.” she replied. “Ashley Dyer, but if you ever call me Ashley I&#39;ll kick your ass.”<br />
      “You&#39;re uhh I think the officer called you Micky or something right?” Lace sighed. “Michael, Michael Lacey but everyone just calls me Lace. There&#39;s always a lot of Michaels after all.” Lace cringed as he found himself explaining his name for the thousandth time. He had long since given up on convincing people to call him Michael.<br />
      “Ha, alright Lace it is then, no wonder you make for such good panties You were practically named for the role.” Ash teased. Lace ignored her teasing and grabbed some paper towels to help clean up the coffee. “Can I borrow your phone later? I need to let my family know I&#39;m alive, and my roomate, and fuck my professor too, I have to see about makeup work.” <br />
      Ash laughed. “Good luck explaining to all those people where you were for a whole month.” Lace shot her back a look. “What do you mean good luck? You&#39;re going to help me explain it.” <br />
      Ash looked annoyed. “Why should I?” Lace looked even more annoyed. “Because you&#39;re responsible for a missing persons case and your TFRM app has records of that. If you want me to vouch for you, you&#39;ll help me out.”<br />
      Ash mulled over what Lace told her for a second and responded. “Fine on one condition.” Lace finished sopping up the spilled coffee. “What&#39;s your condition?”<br />
      A devious smile played across Ash&#39;s face. “You agree to be my panties again.” Lace considered the offer for a second as Ash offered him a robe to finally cover up. it&#39;s not as if she was actually in a position to negotiate but it still piqued his interest. “Why? It&#39;s not like you need me, you even said I&#39;m not the style you normally wear.” <br />
      “I already told you you&#39;re my lucky panties, sometimes a girl just needs a little extra luck.” Ash&#39;s grin was enchanting to Lace. Well it wasn&#39;t like Lace was totally against the idea, Ash was hot as hell. “On one condition.”<br />
      “Ugh you can&#39;t put a condition on my condition.” Lace ignored her protests. “You leave my mind on next time.”<br />
      She looked briefly concerned “Are you sure? I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re ready for the full experience.” He paid it no mind however. “I&#39;m sure I can handle your worst. besides having my brain turned off for a long time isn&#39;t exactly fun for me.” <br />
      Lace held out his hand for a handshake while Ash considered it. “Deal but I don’t want to hear any whining out of you afterwards. Being underwear isn&#39;t exactly a picnic.” She smacked his hand in affirmation sealing Lace in a deal that would define the rest of his life.</p>
