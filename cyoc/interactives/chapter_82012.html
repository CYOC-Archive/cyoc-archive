<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frank managed to find some clothes to fit his bigger frame. He was the same height as his dad now, but he was <br />
definitely more muscular. His shirt fit rather snug over his wide shoulders and thick torso. He took another <br />
look at himself in the mirror, giddy at how chest hair was sticking out the collar of his shirt. He stroked <br />
his scratchy face, briefly considering getting back into the pool. He never thought about being older in the <br />
past, but after what had just happened to him, he wanted it to happen again. It wasn't even a curiosity at <br />
what he'll look like in the future, it was like an addiction. His body craved the cool feel of the water and <br />
the inevitable march into old age it would lead to. The thought disappeared as he heard a rhythmic knock <br />
downstairs. George had arrived. Frank gave himself one last glance before heading down the stairs and looking <br />
through the peep hole. He never realised how short his friend was, but of course he was 6 foot even now. He <br />
called out through the door &quot;OK George, remember that I'm Frank even if you don't believe it&quot;.<br />
<br />
The door swung open and George stared slack-jawed at the man in front of him. He was super muscular and hairy <br />
and tall. There was no way this could be his friend. But he did mention something about the swimming pool. <br />
Maybe it was magic. But luckily George had prepared for this moment. &quot;Wow, OK... If you really are Frank then <br />
you'd know the answer to this question. Eleven strawberry pecan square?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Frank grinned, he knew exactly what to say. They both came up with a nonsensical phrase to say to the other in <br />
case they were a robot or clone, resulting from watching a scary movie they both had no right seeing at their <br />
age. Well George's age. Frank could watch whatever he wanted now, even the special channel he caught his dad <br />
watching once. &quot;Eight orange peanut triangle&quot;.<br />
<br />
George was stunned, it was his friend alright. They promised to never tell anyone their secret passcode no <br />
matter what. This man, old enough to be his father, was really his 7 year old friend. He tried to say <br />
something but he just stuttered, making the man let out a deep booming laugh. Finally he said one word. <br />
&quot;How?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Frank led the boy through the house and out into the back yard and pointed at the pool. &quot;I went swimming and <br />
suddenly I'm a man. That's why I called you over. I thought you'd want to be a man too&quot;.<br />
<br />
George looked at the sparkling water, beckoning him to slip under its cold waves. The air conditioning in his <br />
house had broken down and he'd been struggling to fight the heat. He almost dove in straight then, were it not <br />
for his mom. She would be home soon and would surely panic if he wasn't there. He didn't even leave a note for <br />
her to say where he was. &quot;I'm sorry Frank but I can't. I didn't expect to be here long. I haven't told my mom <br />
where I am or anything&quot;.<br />
<br />
Frank frowned at his friend. He was hoping they'd be adults together. He didn't want to go through this alone. <br />
But he had an idea. He picked up his friend and threw him into the water. The boy came up to the surface, <br />
gasping for air and disorientated. Frank yelled out to him &quot;Now you're in the water. I'll run over to your <br />
house and leave a note on the door for you&quot;. George thought it over and reluctantly nodded in response. Frank <br />
ran into the house to get a pen and paper. He hastily wrote a note out, struggling to make it look neat as he <br />
fumbled with his much larger hands, and bounded out to George's house. The driveway was still empty. He stuck <br />
the barely legible handwritten note to the door and ran back in minutes, all without breaking a sweat. <br />
<br />
He entered the back yard to find George paddling about the pool, having stripped out of his wet clothes. He <br />
didn't look much different, yet Frank could tell he had matured a bit. He watched the boy swim a bit, and that <br />
urge to dive in started to come back. He stared at the water, trying to resist it. He hadn't noticed he was <br />
slowly taking off his shirt and pants as he tried to ignore the desire. Then without a second thought, he <br />
dived into the water, causing a big splash. He stood in the shallow area, admiring how his wet body hair <br />
looked covering his body. George yelled out to him &quot;What are you doing? you said yourself this water makes you <br />
older!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Frank called back &quot;I know, I want to be older. Even older than my parents. How cool would that be?&quot;.<br />
<br />
George wanted to respond with horror that his friend wanted to keep aging, but he understood the man's desire. <br />
The pool was just too alluring, it filled you with the desire to age. He just ignored him and got back to his <br />
own changes. He had only been in for a few minutes but he'd already grown taller, now able to stand up in the <br />
shallow water without having to crane his neck and balance on his toes. It looked like the hair on his arms <br />
was beginning to darken as well.<br />
<br />
After 5 minutes, the changes were evident in both of them. George had undergone a major growth spurt, already <br />
reaching the same height as Frank. He also avoided the bean-sprout phase that his friend went through, keeping <br />
lean and muscled throughout. He'd long outgrown the underwear he was wearing to protect his ever-growing <br />
modesty, throwing the ripped fabric out of the water. The hair on his arms and legs had grown considerably, <br />
and a few hairs were starting to pop up on his previously smooth chest. His teen hormones were going wild and <br />
George kept swimming around the pool, trying to keep his thoughts on something other than his sudden intense <br />
attraction to his friend. Frank mainly kept to the side of the pool, not wanting to disturb George just yet. <br />
He was beginning to enter middle age as more grey hairs were springing up in his lengthening facial hair and <br />
around his temples. His huge muscles were softening as his well-cut abs were beginning to fade. Small lines <br />
were appearing at the corners of his eyes. His massive cock was straining for release from his boxers, but it <br />
wasn't the right time. George was still too young. He wouldn't even understand these feelings as a boy and yet <br />
the water seemed to age his mind along with his body. He ran a hand through his hair, thinking it felt a <br />
little thinner than normal.<br />
<br />
Another 5 minutes had passed and George had reached 20 years old. He had surpassed his friend in height by <br />
several inches. He had kept his lean muscles, if getting maybe a bit bigger. Hair had spread across his body, <br />
accentuating his muscles. He had a light stubble covering his now adult face, looking like a young movie star. <br />
He had stopped swimming and went to join Frank at the side of the pool, trying to cover the throbbing erection <br />
he had from him but Frank noticed it straight away, smiling to himself at its length. It was above average but <br />
was nothing compared to his. He stroked his softer stomach, remembering when he had a body any man would kill <br />
for. Now he was 40 years old, his belly was slowly starting to grow outwards, a bulge noticeable. Grey hairs <br />
were now appearing in his body hair, while his beard was now a greyish hue from the amount that had appeared. <br />
His hairline had receded by a few inches and a bald spot was slowly appearing at the back of his head as his <br />
hair gradually thinned. He brought a meaty hand down to his boxers and with one swift movement, yanked them <br />
from his waist to show off his huge dick, solid as stone. George glanced over and gasped, he'd never of <br />
thought they'd got that big. Frank grinned widely at his friend's reaction, wrinkles spreading across his <br />
heavily bearded face, which failed to entirely disappear once he stopped. He pulled George's head down and <br />
they started to kiss, arms wrapping around each other and boners colliding. After their intense passion, <br />
George had turned around and Frank grabbed him by the waist, both ready for this life-changing moment.<br />
<br />
Frank slowly stuck his cock into George's ass, both gasping from the pleasure. He gently eased it in until he <br />
could smoothly pump it in and out. He started to rhythmically thrust, getting quicker with every passing <br />
moment. While they fucked, the water was continuing to age them. George was getting hairier, a small patch <br />
starting to spread across his lower back and spreading from his chest and up his shoulders. Frank was packing <br />
on the pounds, his small gut growing with every thrust until he had a large belly jiggling from the rhythm. <br />
His hair completely receded, his bare scalp shining in the sun. His beard was growing scraggly and greyer. <br />
Eventually he let out a guttural roar as he intensely came. George quickly joined him, both twitching from the <br />
pleasure. They leant against the pool wall, panting from the intensity. George looked over to his friend, <br />
taking in how much he'd changed since he first saw him that day. Most of his hair was grey, and his beard was <br />
starting to turn white. He had put on at least a hundred pounds, his metabolism slowing to a crawl, giving him <br />
a large flabby belly and a pair of hairy man-boobs that sagged down onto the round gut. Frank returned the <br />
look, seeing how George had turned into a fine man, his lean body now sporting a healthy covering of thick <br />
black hair. His stubble was starting to lengthen, and a few strands of grey hair appeared in his temples. <br />
George leaned down to Frank and seductively said &quot;you ready for round two?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Frank let out a hearty laugh and said &quot;Unless you have some Viagra handy on you, I don't think I'm going to be <br />
ready any time soon&quot;. His huge cock had quickly gone flaccid after his intense climax, and no manner of <br />
arousal was going to get it hard again. <br />
<br />
George slapped his friend's large belly, making it jiggle in the water, and said &quot;Well you are looking a bit <br />
past your prime there. Maybe you should get out of the water while you're still, what, fifty?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Frank considered his friend's proposal. He certainly wasn't expecting to become a fat, greying bear when he <br />
first discovered the water and yet he felt exhilarated. He wouldn't even dream of being younger. And although <br />
George wouldn't admit it, he looked up to his friend, wanting to become just as old as he was, and even <br />
further, wanting to be a bald and white-haired old man. The virus was affecting their brains, making them want <br />
to stay in the water, and the longer they stayed submerged, the more of a grip the virus had on them. Neither <br />
of them made an attempt to exit the pool as George turned 30 and Frank turned 50.</p>
