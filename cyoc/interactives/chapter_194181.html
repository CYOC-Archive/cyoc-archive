<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While she’s thinking about her adopted son transforming into something that isn’t human, or should she say, something that&#39;s not really living, is very scary for her to think about. But she wonders something… “Does my son want to be used by someone else other than me?..” She thought to herself, since you didn’t give her any specific details on who you want to be used by. She thought to ask you again if that’s actually what you want…<br />
<br />
“…Hey Jeffy?” Your mom said to you, with great question.<br />
<br />
“What is it mom?” You responded back, wondering what she is pondering about.<br />
<br />
“You said that you want to turn into something for me, right? You mentioned before that. “If you need something, now is the time!” I am just wondering if you want to turn into an object for someone else instead? I am sorry Jeff, but I don’t need anything at the moment. I mean, do you just want to become an object, and not be used by anyone? Wouldn&#39;t you get bored laying around somewhere, not doing anything? Again, are you sure you want to go through with this?” She said to you, while blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh…” You also start to blush, and get nervous. “But… I really want to be used by y-you mom! I want to get closer to you mom! Since dad’s been gone for a year or two, I notice you have been by yourself all the time. You’re always out at work, but I want to bond with you more… You can turn me into something that isn’t really important, and what ever you choose I won’t hesitate! The important thing is that I am with you.” You desperately said to her, and at the same time in very nervous mood towards her. Getting anxious that she might change her mind, and not go with your game. <br />
<br />
“Aww!~ You really care about me, huh?~ I mean, throwing away your humanity for the weekend sounds scary… And I don’t want to risk loosing you… Hmm… Alright Jeffy, as you wish! I will think of something!~” Your mother lively said to you, while also scared for going along with her son’s insane idea of becoming nothing more than an inanimate object for her to use… She still couldn’t really think of any ideas, but then all the sudden her stomach started to *GRUMBLE*. She realized that she forgot to make herself breakfast, but she just remembered that she is all out of bananas. She can’t make her morning workout shake without it. I mean she can have Jeff’s breakfast downstairs, but she isn’t interested in eating waffles, since she is used to eating things that are healthy… This is the only transformation she can currently think of, and she isn’t sure if it’s right to change her son into that “ingredient” she needs. But a least she won’t have to worry about loosing him…<br />
<br />
“Yay! Thank you mom! Alright, have you thought of something you want me to become?” You questioned your mom, on what she want you to turn into.<br />
<br />
“Well… Yes… I am not sure if you are okay with this or not but… I-I want you to become a banana… But this will be the only time I’ll allow you to become my food!” She deliberately said to you, while also getting a little embarrassed in front of you.<br />
<br />
“Huh? A banana? Why do I ne-” Then the realization came to you. “Wait a minute! Then that means… You want me to become a part of your morning workout shake? Are we all out of bananas?!” You responded back to her out loud, while getting bewildered, and also nervous. Your heart starts racing…<br />
<br />
“Well… Yeah, we are all out of bananas… This is all I can think of. The shake doesn’t taste right without it, and I guess the only one left is you, handsome…~ A-Anyways, are you still sure about this? Do you want to be included as a part of my daily diet? I mean, you will get an interesting tour on how my body stays in healthy shape!~” She playfully said to you, trying to put you at ease.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… Hmm… I mean, I do have some sort of curiosity on how you maintain that toned body of yours… And actually, now that I think about it. I am kind of curious on how it feels being food, let alone how the female body will use me. I guess I’m interested to experience what a female’s body is like from the inside, let alone y-yours…” You responded back to her, while you start shaking in excitement.<br />
<br />
“Well I will tell you that my body’s stomach might really do a number on you by stepping foot inside, being that I am always active. Or maybe I am wrong, and you might actually feel very cozy in here…~” She said to you, while she looks down, and begins to carefully rub her sexy gut. Then, suddenly... *GLURP* her toned abdomen went, but while rubbing and looking back at her son. She realized something. (“Wait a minute, how would I get you out of me?…”) She pondered for a second, and then it hit her. (“Oh... Oh dear… He’s not realizing the situation that might come to him… At the end… Dammit what do I do! How would would I convince him that I want to scrap this idea without making this sound embarrassing… Wait a minute, maybe there is something I can change in the machine…)” She thought to herself while getting beat red, and mildly shaking anxiously.<br />
<br />
“Uh mom? Are you okay?” You said to her, while getting a little bit dazed on why her behavior so suddenly changed a little.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s nothing sweetie…” She quickly responded back to you, with mixed emotions.<br />
<br />
“Wait, what if the timer runs out while I am still inside your stomach? That won’t be good!” You said to her, without having much thorough thought on what you are about to get into.<br />
<br />
“Hmm… Let’s see…” She nervously said to you, as she twirls back to your desk, and clicked around. She pulled up the inanimate transformation description, and starts reading the rest of it more carefully to herself. When she finished reading. “Jeffy, did you read the whole description? Because it seems like you skimmed through most of it… It says that. ‘You can’t transform back into your normal human self, unless you have enough room. If you are in a tight confined space, the countdown timer of the transformation will pause itself. If you have enough room, the countdown timer will continue where it left off.’ …Alright, so I am going to let you out after the weekend. Also, before you start your transformation, I want you to eat your waffles downstairs. Because they are getting cold!” Your mother explained, and ordered you as she continues to get even more beat red.<br />
<br />
“Uh… Alright sure! I guess, I’ll be a banana for you mom! Okay, I am going to eat breakfast. I’ll be back in 2 minutes!” You embarrassingly said to her, as you walk downstairs, and head to the kitchen. “Thank you sweetie!” She said to you, as you walk out…<br />
<br />
She then quickly swings back to your desk, and starts to browse around. “Alright, if I do this correctly…” She said to herself, while moving the mouse around, and typing a few things. “…I am going to set the transformation duration to 1 hour, which is enough time for him to transform back after I “expel” him. If my calculations are correct…” She said to herself, as she slightly moves her ass around for a second on the seat, as an anxious reaction. “L-Let’s see… Ah HA! Senses!” She said to herself as she clicked on it. And after she read all of it, she ticked off all of them… “Alright, everything else I am leaving on default, because I am afraid that I might mess this up. I don’t know what most of these options even mean! I mean, there are a lot of options in this, and it&#39;s very overwhelming!.. Okay, I think this is the “Object Selections” Hmm, alright let’s choose banana!” She said to her self as she selected it, and then fills in the parameters that point to her son…<br />
<br />
“…Alright, I think it’s all set!” She said to herself, and then called you from downstairs. “Jeffy?! Are you done eating your waffles? I finished setting up your transformation!” She out loudly said to you!<br />
<br />
“Yeah! I just finished! I am coming up right now!” You called back to her, as you then head upstairs… When you arrived back to your mother seemed to be in her relaxed state again, but you wonder why she seemed weird for a moment…<br />
<br />
“I think it’s all set! Now… are you ready, Jeffy? I am now going to apply the transformation to your body…” She said to you while looking over at the settings and parameters, while her finger hovering over the enter key.<br />
<br />
“I am ready mom…” You responded back to her, with your nervous last words.<br />
<br />
She looks back at you. “Alright… See you after the weekend, Jeffy!~” She cheerfully said to you, and then she immediately pressed enter to start the Chronivac’s magic, from son to a banana that will eventually be used in her shake.<br />
<br />
At first, nothing seems to be happening… But after a few seconds, you feel a weird tickling sensation all over yourself, pacifically your crotch region. While observing down at your own body, you watched as the world around you starts to get bigger, but in reality you are getting smaller. You feel your whole body getting smaller, and smaller. Then the shrinking stopped, and the outcome made you become around 6 inches of height. While being buried in your clothes, blinding you from the outside, the first phase is now done…<br />
<br />
Within moments, the second phase starts. Your wiener had grown and hardened, erect at an extreme level. You then start to notice your hands, and arms are loosing it&#39;s shape. It doesn’t hurt at all, but for some strange reason you can still feel them, feeling them in your lower region. You look down at your erect penis, noticing that it looks bigger? All the mass that is, or was once your arms, is now melted, and absorbed as part of your own penis. You then feel both of your legs doing the same thing, being absorbed too, making your penis grow at almost the same size as your head and torso… You are now just a head and torso with your penis at almost the size of your normal 6 inch erect penis size, but that will soon change... As your whole torso in moments begins to shrink down and absorb into your penis, giving it the extra mass it needs to hit 6 inches! Now all that’s left is your head, as it starts to melt, and absorb into your own penis like the rest before… You still have all of your senses, you can see, hear, smell, taste, and feel as a whole through your own penis body. With your hole vision, you can see at all angles, a 360 degree view of all of your surroundings. But you still can’t see anything currently, due to you being buried in your clothes while your in the middle of transforming. Unfortunately you can’t talk, nor you can move. Which makes sense, since you are becoming a banana for your mom in the long run… Once the second phase is done, you are now your own disembodied cock! Now for the last phase…<br />
<br />
You lastly start to feel your whole cock body becoming more soft, becoming more malleable. You feel your body rapidly mold itself like clay, starting to take form into a banana like shape. When your cock body is done being shaped into any ordinary banana, you start to then feel another sensation that is happening. You then start to feel really really weird, as your body’s skin color starts to become light yellow, and your skin texture is starting to become more like a banana. It continues as your supposed organs, skin, etc start dissolving to become the inside of what any regular tomato should look like… It’s now done… The transformation from human to a banana is done. You were once her adopted son, and now you are the “fruit” your mother desperately needs in her shake…<br />
<br />
While your mother got spooked while also surprised as she watched you shrink down, the Chronivac gave a pop-up notifying that the changes are finished, and that you are now safe to use. For her it seemed kind of instant, but for you the changes seemed slower. Layla noticed the pop-up on the screen, and assumed that the transformation is done. “I guess you are done, my special little ingredient.~” She said, as she walks towards to the pile of clothes where her fresh banana is buried in. As she squats down, and moves the pile of your clothes out of the way to get a look at you… You see light, resulting with a giant sight of a golden blonde hair beauty that is your mother, which is towering on top of you at the size of a skyscraper with a nice view of her panties under her sleepwear, with a camel toe peeking through. Realizing how powerless you currently are being at the bottom of the food chain, she looks down at her prey with a chuckle. Reality came back to you as the giantess’s hand lowers down towards you, and effortlessly plucks the banana(you) out of the pile of clothes, which is giving you sensitive sensation all over you. Being that your whole penis is now based on your new banana body, it’s hard to resist the overwhelming pleasure. Her hands feel very soft, harm, and tastes a tad salty. Probably because it’s Saturday morning, and she hasn’t taken a shower yet… You feel extreme force all over you, as she raises you up to her beautiful face to inspect your transformed self. You look at the goddess hazel eye’s as she inspects you, while feeling her warm breathing hitting your tomato body, sending you shivers down your spine. But you have no spine, you are just a banana… You also get a good look all around using your new body, and dazzled on how the world from this perspective looks so huge! You realized, that time seems to be a lot slower at this size… You can’t believe that this is all happening, by being something that isn’t considered sentient. It amazing!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, this is incredible! My little Jeffy, you&#39;re now a delicious banana!~ I can’t believe my own adorable son is now at the palm of my hand… So cute!~ Don’t worry my little “fruit”, you will be tucked away inside your mommy where you will be safe!&quot; She said to the banana while lightly rubbing and patting at her toned abdomen, but the banana obviously didn’t respond to her statement. “Too bad you don’t have the ability to talk nor move. Nor see, hear, smell, taste, and feel. But that’s okay! I’m sure you wouldn’t mind but, I did that for… privacy reasons.~” She teasingly said to you, as she walks out of your room, and head downstairs to the kitchen… You don’t really understand what your mother means by that, since you still have your sense of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and feel. Maybe she put down something, and it didn’t really work? Maybe there is some sort of bug?.. You wonder why she tried to do that to you…<br />
<br />
While she head towards the kitchen, and examines you more. &quot;Wow, you look and feel exactly like a real banana! You are literally the real deal!.. And it seems like you are also at the 4th stage of ripening… Hmm... I guess you’re good enough, your purpose will be very useful for diminishing any possible, constipation issues that I might get.~ I hope after having you inside me for a couple days, you will be able to reform back to being my handsome son again.~&quot; She said to you surprised, while also sensing her being kind of frightened on how powerful this Chronivac is... Then all the sudden her toned tummy made a loud *GRUMBLE* sound. “Huh? Oh, I guess I have to use the bathroom…” She said to herself, as she starts to carefully rub her gut to help ease the discomfort. “Alright my little fruit, I have to use the bathroom. I’m going to leave you here on the kitchen counter. I’ll be right back!” She said to you, as you watch her sprint out of the kitchen, and headed towards the bathroom to do her business…<br />
<br />
The moment she left the realization finally came to you! (“OH GOD! Is that why she tried to disable my senses?!”) You thought to yourself, while getting concerned and excited at the same time. You don’t know what to say in your current situation, but this might get nauseating on what might happen to you during the end. Her using the bathroom is a hint on how this will all go down… You have been on the kitchen counter for 4 minutes. You hear someone’s distant exploding footsteps heading towards you…</p>
