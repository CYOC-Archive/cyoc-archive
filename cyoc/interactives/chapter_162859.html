<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Author&#39;s Note: There is another body swap story going on in another thread that also uses the name &quot;Brad&quot;. They are totally different characters from this storyline. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad finally got home as his new buddy...well, Dad&#39;s buddy, Jake, dropped him off. Dad was going to get a ride this morning anyway, but his car was fine, which was odd. Brad had been thinking about it all day. Did it have to do with the fact that Dad and Jake were more than just &quot;friends&quot;? Brad didn&#39;t know what to think. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your kid home?&quot; Jake asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s 6:30. He should be in there.&quot; Weird to think of Dad as my kid! Brad thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, all that extra work pretty much cancels out the possibility of an afternoon quickie.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A quickie? What&#39;s that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, we haven&#39;t had the chance to fuck in forever.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ohhh, Brad thought, and suddenly got nervous. And also curious. <br />
<br />
Jake was suddenly looking at him with lust in his eyes. Brad felt so...enamored. Jake kissed him. Brad had never been kissed before. He inhaled deeply as he kissed this man who was a giant to him just yesterday. Rugged, 32 years old, a blond buzz cut and taut muscles, Jake had a charisma and Southern accent that was driving Brad wild! He had never felt sensations like this before! He kissed Jake back, passionately enjoying his first time kissing another adult! And he didn&#39;t care that it was a man, he just felt so...horny! It felt so good! Time seemed to stop as they kissed. Jake pulled away. <br />
<br />
&quot;We need to make time for some fucking and sucking, bud.&quot; He patted Brad on the knee. &quot;See ya later, Ben.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ben. That&#39;s what his new name was. It felt weird but...he was getting used to it. He walked, in a dreamlike state, to the front door. He felt disorientated. The doorknob was a lot shorter than it was before. He had to reach down for it! Weird! He was having so much fun being tall! <br />
<br />
When he came in, he called out for his dad. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Dad! Daaad! I&#39;m home! Where are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; He saw his old little boy body come from the living room. &quot;Is Grandpa here?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Does it look like Grandpa is here?&quot; Brad asked, too sarcastically, and cringed. He shouldn&#39;t talk down to Dad like that, even if he was just a kid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; A new voice said. &quot;Mister Monahan? Can I please talk to you for a second?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeremy? What are you doing here?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, he&#39;s my best friend. Are you...angry?&quot; He saw his Dad get a worried look on his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can explain. Can I just talk to your dad alone about...a research project of mine? I want to do construction worker for my uh...job project.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s next semester.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah well I have a lot of questions. Come on, MISTER Monahan.&quot; Jeremy led Brad in his new dad bod out past the kitchen and into the back yard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what is going on? I&#39;ve had a long day! I don&#39;t have time to answer your stupid questions.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know it&#39;s you, idiot! I know you&#39;re Brad!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What? Dad told you? Then...why didn&#39;t?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sort of have a problem right now. So I sort of tried to help out and called my grandpa and I gave Brad...I mean...your Dad this little bracelet. It&#39;s supposed to help with the swap. My grandpa says sorry, he didn&#39;t think the amulet would work after this long. He says he thought it was like a battery and just ran out of juice after time. And I was like it&#39;s magic, it probably doesn&#39;t work that way and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I am in my Dad&#39;s body. This can&#39;t get any weirder!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh, I think it miiiight. See...now...your Dad thinks he&#39;s you. And he acts just like you. So...you remember that you guys swapped bodies, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course. But it&#39;s complicated. I keep remembering things that my Dad knows how to do. Like, dude...I drove a car today!&quot; Brad bragged, pointing to himself with his thumb. &quot;It was awesome! I knew what I was doing and no one even taught me how!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;So your Dad never showed you how to drive or anything?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Heck no. My Dad never has time for me. Or patience. Hey. Do you know what this means? This means...I can do whatever I want! I can be his dad and give him orders and make HIS life miserable!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That does not sound like a good plan.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like an awesome plan to me and since I&#39;m a big huge adult with muscles, I outrule you,&quot; Brad said, smugly. &quot;Dude and check it out, I even smoked cigarettes today. And no one stopped me! Last night I uh...&quot; Brad remembered doing some pretty crazy things, like getting a huge boner for the first time, lighting up a cigar while wearing his Dad&#39;s leather jacket and beating off his dick for the first time. Having an orgasm, smoking, looking like a stud. &quot;Nothing. Um. I smoked a cigar, that&#39;s all. And drank beer!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Great. I&#39;m happy for you,&quot; Jeremy said. He did not sound happy for Brad. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was fun but stressful because of the whole body swap thing. But hey, I think I&#39;m getting used to this big body!&quot; He showed off a big bicep and flexed with a ridiculous grin on his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, cool. I&#39;m going home.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, are we gonna hang out again? I mean, you and I can totally do what we want now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, we can&#39;t. I can&#39;t hang out with you. You&#39;re like, super old now. And there&#39;s your SON now. He thinks he&#39;s you so you&#39;d be hanging out with HIS friend. That would be super weird for him and it&#39;s kind of super weird for me, too. I need to go home and think. I&#39;ll see ya later, dude.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey, add my dad&#39;s phone number to your phone,&quot; Brad told him and gave him the number. <br />
<br />
After Jeremy left, Brad felt filled with power. He had fantasized about this in secret. Being totally in charge and Dad had to do what he said. This was his dream come true! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, son!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Dad?&quot; Brad&#39;s body came out. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s for dinner?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...dinner? I dunno. Make it yourself.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to make dinner? By myself? Really?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um. Yeah. I&#39;m beat. Why don&#39;t you make us some macaroni. I think you can handle yourself...son.&quot; Brad said, trying to sound authoritative. <br />
<br />
Brad sauntered past his new &quot;son&quot; and decided he&#39;d go into Dad&#39;s man cave - the basement. He came down the stairs. The shag carpeting, the pool table, the weights...hey...the weights! <br />
<br />
Brad smiled gleefully as he picked up a 50 pound dumbbell. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woooooow.&quot; he said out loud, curling it and really feeling the burn. He knew how to curl a 50 lb dumbbell right off the bat! He started exercising, feeling a rush of endorphins as he did so. He exercised his chest with some lateral raises, a dumbbell in each hand that yesterday he wouldn&#39;t have been able to budge, let alone lift! He felt so fucking powerful! He experimented more. He did squats, and various back exercises, really feeling the burn on his lats. Wow! His arms, though...they were the most enjoyable thing ever. They were so firm and round. He couldn&#39;t believe how big they were! He did some more curls and really felt the burn again. He was sweating and grunting when he heard his old voice come down the stairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um...Dad? I&#39;m done making dinner! I mean, I sort of made it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brad came upstairs, pounding the stairs with his massive weight. He grinned. I&#39;m so big I made the stairs pound! I&#39;m like a superhero in this body! <br />
<br />
Dad had been having a little trouble with the cheese powder mix clumping up. His new &quot;dad&quot; stepped in and added some milk, showing Brad how to disperse it evenly and stir it. Then he chopped up some vegetables from the fridge. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ew, gross, you&#39;ll ruin it,&quot; Brad said, making a face. <br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re good for you. Don&#39;t you want a healthy body some day? You want to look like me or some fat slob?&quot; Brad told his old body, annoyed. Am I really that annoying? he thought. &quot;You can&#39;t live by carbs alone. Now watch, we&#39;ll add all these in and make it way better.&quot; <br />
<br />
They ate their meal, and &quot;Brad&quot; poured himself some milk. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY. Son. You want to hand me a beer?&quot; Brad said, testing his former self. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Dad.&quot; The boy handed him a beer. Dad, who had been turned into a child, just gave his son a beer! &quot;This is so cool. I can drink beer because I&#39;m an adult!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know. Why are you telling me that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I just want to rub it in.&quot; Brad grinned and drank. Dad didn&#39;t remember how good beer was! This was hilarious! <br />
<br />
&quot;I had a problem with the bullies at school today but...I handled it and sort of...defended myself.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Who was it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mikey Evanston and Ricky Shiner. They&#39;re huge. And I sort of did this thing where I twisted Ricky&#39;s arm and flipped him over and sort of jumped on top of him like a wrestler.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What?? You did THAT? That&#39;s awesome!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and the vice principal saw Mikey calling me a faggot and gave him detention.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, those kids fucking suck. They needed a lesson. Hey, I&#39;m proud of you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Dad!&quot; <br />
<br />
He thinks I&#39;m the Dad! Hey, maybe this whole being a dad thing won&#39;t be so hard after all! <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I need help with my homework.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh...sure.&quot; the new Ben said. Man, I just want a cigarette. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I like the mac and cheese with vegetables. The cheese hides them pretty well.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna go outside and smoke a cigarette. I&#39;ll be right back when I&#39;m done,&quot; the new Ben announced. <br />
<br />
He lit up his prize and inhaled. Dad couldn&#39;t do anything to stop him! He was free! And he could drive to work all by himself tomorrow morning! This whole adult thing was gonna be the easiest thing ever, Brad thought. Brad didn&#39;t know how to drive this morning, but now he did. It was crazy. He wanted to drive some more! <br />
<br />
He finished smoking and came inside. He helped his &quot;son&quot; with his homework. Dad was always yelling at me, he thought. I want to get even. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Into your jammies. Brush your teeth and into bed by 9:30!&quot; Brad announced. He remembered that he gave his Dad cigarettes this morning but he doubted that Dad even remembered that. <br />
<br />
He waited until Dad took his shower and came out in a towel. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; The new Ben, which is how the real Brad began to think of himself, pretended to fold the jeans, and then felt inside the pockets...and took some cigarettes out. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is this? You stole my cigarettes!&quot; <br />
<br />
The New Brad looked panicked. He looked confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t put them there!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So how did they get there? I didn&#39;t put them there!&quot; So what if it&#39;s a lie? This is too much fun! Brad thought, looking as menacing as he could. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...don&#39;t think so. Oh...no...my bullies told me to bring some for them. But...but I didn&#39;t!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you lying to me, you little fuck? Huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
Brad felt sudden anger over all the times his dad yelled at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You think it&#39;s okay to lie to me, huh? These are for ADULTS. NOT for children! These cost me money! And I&#39;m addicted so I can&#39;t stop. I work all fuckin day so you can live in this house, and this is the thanks I get? You&#39;re grounded, you little shit! No TV, no internet, no playing with friends for a week! Now apologize to me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;m sorry...I just...I don&#39;t know what came over me this morning. I remember taking them and I just wanted to try one so badly because...I can&#39;t remember. You do it,&quot; the New Brad said, helplessly. <br />
<br />
&quot;So that means you can do it? You&#39;re twelve years old. Not a grown man like me. When you start earning a paycheck and paying bills, we&#39;ll talk about fun adult things. But for now, if I see you anywhere near my beer or my cigarettes and I&#39;m gonna fucking spank you so hard your ass will fall off!&quot; <br />
<br />
Wow, I really sound like dad! Where is all this coming from? The New Ben wondered. I even scare myself! My voice is so deep and scary now! <br />
<br />
Brad started to sniffle. Dad in his little boy body was now totally vulnerable. Brad remembered all the times his Dad yelled at him and made him cry. And then made fun of him for it. <br />
<br />
&quot;You gonna cry? Like a baby? Or you gonna man up? I mean, you&#39;re a kid but when I was your age...&quot; <br />
<br />
When I was your age it was just a few days ago! he thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;When I was your age, I was earning my keep and working hard at everything. So get your ass in bed, and I don&#39;t want to hear a peep out of you tonight! <br />
<br />
He slammed the door shut and grinned. He was in charge of the house now! He popped another beer out of the fridge and watched some TV. He watched an adult rated show he was never allowed to watch, Game of Thrones, but found it boring. He drank his beer and started to get hard. He felt his big dick and started stroking it, getting more and more aroused. He whipped out his dad&#39;s phone and remembered his dad went to certain websites with pics of hot men. He started getting really hard and was breathing differently. Oh god, this felt amazing! He was overcome with all the endorphins and testosterone flowing through his body. He gritted his teeth and felt his body convulse over and over, like he was in an earthquake. <br />
<br />
A huge rope of cum shot out and landed on the floor. The New Ben grunted and more dribbled over, great big gobs of it, flowing over his hand, coating it with translucent milky man-seed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. That felt great! Man, am I tired, though. Gotta get up early the next morning.&quot; <br />
<br />
He sleepily trudged back upstairs to his new, more spacious room. Brad, in his new awesome body, was going to be a really cool dad. He definitely wanted to experience everything he could from being a grown up and with Dad not able to remember anything, he could reign supreme without Dad being able to say no to him! <br />
<br />
He set his dad&#39;s...er...his new alarm and tucked himself in, noting how far away his feet were. He giddily pulled the blanket up so he could wriggle his toes. They were so far away. <br />
<br />
This is awesome! he thought, as he curled up and went to sleep, happy that his secret wish had finally come true.</p>
