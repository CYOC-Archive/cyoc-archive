<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Early in his research, Jerry named the kind of mental connection he and Ben were sharing, &quot;The Link.&quot; The Link was a a complete bonding of body and mind. The more a human was altered before entering the link, the more powerful and complete the integration became. Jerry controlled everything for Ben at this point, yet both were in equal control. Jerry and Ben felt a strange sensation, then another mind was attempting to join the link.<br />
<br />
Ben knew that Jerry was coming back, and the link severed between the two. Soon after, Jerry opened his eyes and saw light above the surface of the fluid he was submerged in. Jerry tried to move, but was still firmly held by the lining of the growth. Jerry watched as a shadow moved above him and then a pressure on his body. &quot;What is Abe doing?&quot; thought Jerry to himself and the person entering his &quot;pod&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not Abe dear, just me. Now don&#39;t start going all lovey dovey on me now. Abe suggested that I check in on you. I know this breaks my vow, so be happy. Don&#39;t analyze it to death like you do everything else.,&quot; thought Mother Sarah.<br />
<br />
Jerry&#39;s mind started to wander and with a quick, &quot;Silence!&quot; from Sarah, there was a calm stillness between them. Sara sat down in Jerry&#39;s lap, and the lining of the growth quickly attached to her body and nervous system. Sara would quickly stifle any stray thought from Jerry as she became bonded to him. Once fully bonded together, Jerry and Sarah were essentially the same consciousness. Together the joined with Ben again, who was not aware of the time that had passed. The three shared a long dream together, with the purpose of helping Ben grow in understanding himself far beyond his life experience. Jerry-Sarah also worked Ben&#39;s body and mind to best reflect his new understanding, then Ben fell into a deep sleep while the remainder of his body became fully hybridized. Jerry and Sarah monitored Ben&#39;s progress, but also took the opportunity to share themselves with each other, for the first time in over fifty years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; thought Jerry.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how petty, silly, and full of self-pity you were. Do us both a favor and come back to the contemplative order,&quot; thought Sarah. Sarah knew Jerry&#39;s urge was strong to accept, and she also knew what held him back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jerry was not going to re-argue the past. Sara is the one who took the vow to avoid the link as much as possible, and not joining telepathically unless it was absolutely required. Abe&#39;s wife and Sarah&#39;s sister, Claire, was lost in the link just after the four of them had built the second school and the garden building they now were in. Clair had been called by the meteorite, and sat down beside it after it was moved to it&#39;s present location in the garden. Alien modified plants began to encircle her and her body and was absorbed. Nothing like that had ever happened before and would never happen again. It took Jerry years to uncover the secrets of the Meteorite, but it was Claire who gave all the answers. The original alien sentience was dying, and Claire was its successor, and the price was not a hybrid body, but a fully alien form.<br />
<br />
Sarah smiled as Jerry thought, &quot;I&#39;ll move Ben into a dorm room, and then you will rejoin me in our order.&quot; The years of hesitation, regret, and bitterness melted away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep your mind clear  and calm for a while.&quot; thought Sarah.<br />
<br />
Sarah opened her eyes and began shedding the fibrous shell she was encased in. Her body appeared younger, as woman in her early 60&#39;s. Jerry opened his eyes, as Sarah was pulling at his encasement, allowing him to stand up in the pod. Jerry smiled as he examined his wife&#39;s body. Jerry smiled, &quot;I always did love the horsecock clit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sara kissed Jerry&#39;s cheek, &quot;And you know how I loved your clean, smooth manly body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jerry returned the kiss, &quot;And don&#39;t forget the tight, slick pussy to milk you with.&quot; Jerry took Sarah&#39;s hand as she helped him out of the pod. Jerry took time to close the growth and allow it&#39;s yellow-green shell to heal.<br />
<br />
Jerry and Sara stood facing each other&#39;s naked bodies for a long time. Sara reached out and wiped a tear from Jerry&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I hurt you.,&quot; whispered Sarah. Jerry nodded his head slowly. Sarah, picked up her habit off a nearby branch and left the garden. Jerry watched his naked wife leave, then returned his focus to Ben&#39;s pod. The pod was now greenish blue in color. Ben&#39;s body was no longer human, but fully merged with the alien DNA.<br />
<br />
The growth in the root split open on it&#39;s own, and Jerry reached in to pull the fibrous shell away from Ben&#39;s body. Ben was still asleep when Jerry picked him up out of the pod, closed it, and returned him to the room in the school. It was very late, the hallway clock said it was Friday at 3:09 am.<br />
<br />
Ben awoke just after 7am after being asleep for over two days. His last memory was finishing a test and turning it into Sister Abigail. He was even more surprised to see that he was sleeping next to a naked man with a puffy pussy. That&#39;s when he noticed he shared a similar pussy between his own legs. Ben remained calm as he thought this was not normal, and that he should be freaking out about this.  Ben was hungry, and breakfast was served until 7:30am, so he quickly stood up and fell down. Ben then slowly climbed back onto the bed to attempt to stand again. This time he took to standing slowly, and was successful. Ben slowly stepped over to a dresser and began looking for clothes. He found a form fitting long sleeve shirt and a pair of what were very tight yoga pants with a zippered opening in the crotch. Ben made it to the dining room after getting lost many times in the hallway maze with no time to spare, as they closed the door as soon as he entered the serving line. Ben got his breakfast tray and sat down at a table with a few students. He noticed they were dressed differently, wearing slacks and a dress shirt, and this was normal. One of the boy&#39;s at the table moved to sit across from Ben and the two started talking. Jason had been at the school since he was three, and he was seventeen. Jason knew that Ben was new, and invited Ben to attend classes with him today. Jason reached out to take Ben&#39;s tray, and Ben knocked it away, and took Ben&#39;s tray as well as his own to the tray return window.<br />
<br />
 Ben returned and reached out for Jason&#39;s hand, &quot;What are the classes here like?,&quot; Ben asked.<br />
<br />
Jason smiled, and reached out for Ben to take his hand, &quot;Oh, the normal english, science, math, latin, cooking and sewing, economics, history, and there are other classes you can attend when you are ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben and Jason left the cafeteria together for the first time, but not the last.</p>
