<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a long night for Dan.  He knew night had come when he could no longer see the thin sliver of light coming from under the garage door.  He hung in silence, alone, upside down, in pain and in darkness through the entire night.  The only sound to keep him company was the occasional &quot;drip&quot; of blood from his cavity onto the floor in front of his face.  It was cold as well.<br />
<br />
He knew morning had come when he could once again see the sliver of daylight from under the door.  Dan tried to mentally prepare himself, as he figured someone would be coming to butcher him at any time.  But to his surprise, no one came.  He heard not a sound.  He knew the day was progressing as the sliver of daylight grew slowly brighter, then slowly started to dim again.<br />
<br />
Finally, Dan was shocked to hear the garage door motor kick on and saw the garage door opening.  Again from his upside-down vantage point, he saw people approaching... there were four.  He saw Jack walk up with his parents and... Kat.  Yes, Kat.  That Kat, his witch sister.<br />
<br />
Jack spoke first, &quot;So Kat, you know now that my parents are really into hunting... And I wanted to show you the big buck my mom got yesterday.  Nice, huh?&quot;  &quot;Wow, Mrs. Johnson,&quot; said Kat, &quot;That&#39;s amazing.  Beautiful deer!&quot;  &quot;Does this creep you out, honey?&quot;  Sarah asked Kat.  &quot;No, not a bit,&quot; Kat answered, &quot;I don&#39;t mind venison at all.&quot;  &quot;Well, that&#39;s good!&quot; Sarah said, &quot;because if you&#39;re gonna be hanging out around here with Jack this winter, you&#39;re gonna be helping us eat this thing.  It&#39;s gonna keep the freezer full for quite a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Steve spoke up, &quot;Kat, it was really great meeting you and having you spend the day with us today.  It&#39;s just refreshing to see you how happy you and Jack are together.  Reminds me of Sarah and me when we were younger and first going out.  But now,  if you don&#39;t mind, we&#39;re gonna get to work here butchering this meat up and stocking the freezer tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You gonna have the head mounted?&quot;  asked Kat.  &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;Such a beautiful buck, we&#39;re gonna have it mounted and put it up right on the dining room wall.  Don&#39;t ya think it&#39;ll look nice there?&quot;  &quot;Yes, definitely,&quot; answered Kat, &quot;Hey, you know I live not far from the taxidermist.  If you&#39;d like me to drop it off for you, it would be no trouble at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that would be a big help, Kat,&quot; said Steve.  &quot;We got sure our work cut out for us tonight.  Let&#39;s get the head off, and you can be on your way.&quot;  &quot;Ok, sounds good, said Kat.  Can I help or anything?&quot;  &quot;Yeah,&quot; said Steve.  &quot;Grab onto those antlers there, so we don&#39;t drop the head and mess it up when it falls, ok?&quot;  &quot;Like this?&quot;  asked Kat as she grabbed onto Dan&#39;s antlers, lifting his head.  &quot;Perfect,&quot; said Steve.  &quot;Now Jack, you come around behind and hold the legs steady alright? And Sarah, you can help by folding the skin out of the way a bit as I cut into the neck here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan was now being manhandled by the group,.  With Kat firmly gripping his antlers, he was forced to stare straight at her chest, while Steve grabbed his knife.   As he felt the first cut into his neck, he was the only one to see the smirk appear on Kat&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
The pain lessened significantly, as Kat telepathically said &quot;You&#39;re welcome&quot; to Dan.  She had silently cast a quick spell to block the worst of his pain.  Even so, Dan could feel his head being held up by his antlers, his legs being held, the knife&#39;s cutting and sawing motions and his skin being pulled back.  Didn&#39;t take more than a few minutes and his head broke free from his neck, quickly pivoting and leaving his head still held and looking straight up at Kat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Kat,&quot; the three said in unison.  &quot;My pleasure!&quot; said Kat, happily.  She grabbed a garbage bag and stuffed Dan&#39;s head inside, tying it off.  Dan heard the now slightly-muffled voices... &quot;Bye Kat, thanks again!  See you soon!&quot;  &quot;No problem, I&#39;ll drop it off for ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan felt like he was at the bottom of the food chain now.  His head in a bag, swaying as Kat plopped it unceremoniously onto the floor of her car, closing the passenger side door and getting in the other side...  And his meaty body now left behind, being butchered to stock up the freezer of Kat&#39;s new boyfriend and his parents.<br />
<br />
As she drove, Kat opened up a telepathic channel for Dan to communicate, only to her of course.  &quot;Wow, you had quite a couple of days, huh?&quot;  she asked.  &quot;My God, Kat,&quot; answered Dan, &quot;You&#39;ve made your point.  You&#39;ve had your fun, now please turn me back!&quot;  &quot;No can do, &#39;deer,&#39;&quot; laughed Kat.  &quot;Why the hell not?&quot; yelled Dan.  &quot;Because,&quot; she stated simply,&quot; after I turned you into a deer... and essentially gave you a new life, I cast another spell to erase your entire human existence.  I&#39;m an only child.  To my Mom and Dad, you were never born and have never existed.  In fact, because you were never born, your bedroom was never used for you... as I grew up it became a second playroom for me, which I now use as a comfy cozy study.  My life if so much better this way...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kat!&quot; rejected Dan, &quot;You can&#39;t do this!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; replied Kat, &quot;I did.&quot;  &quot;Then why can&#39;t you undo it?&quot; asked Dan.  &quot;Silly deer,&quot; said Kat, simply, &quot;because you&#39;ve already been shot.  You screwed up your new life so fast, I didn&#39;t have time to undo anything even if I wanted to.  You&#39;re being butchered as we speak, and filling the Johnsons&#39; freezer.  I&#39;m not taking that away from them!  Besides, Jack is my new boyfriend now, and I really like him and his parents.  They&#39;re so super excited that they&#39;re gonna be inviting me over for venison dinners...  I just don&#39;t wanna take a chance of screwing this up.  I have such a wonderful life now...  So much to look forward to.  And I&#39;m not gonna be bossed around by some deer head in a garbage bag!&quot;  &quot;KAT!&quot;  shouted Dan, right before she cut off his channel to talk.<br />
<br />
Then she spoke again, &quot;I&#39;m going to do you a favor though.  I mean, I don&#39;t have to do anything for you since you were never even my brother... But, I&#39;m in a good mood... So I&#39;m going to cast one more little spell, to take away your consciousness until you&#39;re all butchered, packed up, frozen and your taxidermy work is all done and your head is proudly hanging on Sarah&#39;s dining room wall.&quot;<br />
