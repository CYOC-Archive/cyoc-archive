<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amielle felt nervous all day.  She knew the report she&#39;d given would get her in big trouble.  She just didn&#39;t know what form that trouble would take.  Toni had noticed her apprehension, and kept trying to get her nerves to calm, but the Angel couldn&#39;t shake the growing sense of impending doom.<br />
<br />
“No matter what happens.  No regrets.  This is what I wanted”, she told herself.<br />
<br />
Later that afternoon, after Toni went to talk to Gemory in private, Amielle was reading a book in the sitting room, when she heard Mist talking to someone in the foyer.  Immediately she realized that Mist had dropped her disguise.<br />
<br />
“She has sanctuary here, you know that, right?”  Mist was saying.<br />
<br />
“Mist.  Come on, you know me.  I&#39;m not the violent type.”  The newcomer was female, mid-teens perhaps?<br />
<br />
Mist snorted.  “I&#39;m sorry, pull my other wing why don&#39;t you?  You&#39;re a damn berserker if there ever was one!  And I suppose you got your hands scuffed up by knitting?”<br />
<br />
“I swear, I&#39;m not here to start anything, Mist.  Do you want me to swear on the seven secret names of God?”<br />
<br />
Amielle paled.  An Angel, it had to be!  That was the most sacred oath any Angel could give!<br />
<br />
“Please don&#39;t, I have a couple of demons in the House, and while Gemory could handle it, you&#39;d light the Succubus girl on fire!  Fine, fine, go on in, but I&#39;ll be watching you.”  Mist warned the visitor.<br />
<br />
“Promise?  I&#39;ll put a little extra sway in my step just for you, Mist.  Oh by the way, before I forget, J wanted me to tell you he misses you.  Mary too.  He wants to talk.”<br />
<br />
“I...see.  Thank you for the message.”  Mist sounded subdued.<br />
<br />
Amielle tried to pretend she didn&#39;t hear the conversation, when a girl came into the room.  She was about 15, with dusky skin, long, light brown hair, and olive eyes.<br />
<br />
Even though Amielle had never met the girl before (in this form, at least), she knew exactly who it was.<br />
<br />
She immediately went to one knee on the floor, her head down in genuflection.  “Archangel.”<br />
<br />
She felt a hand on her head.  “Oh please, do get up, Amielle.”<br />
<br />
Amielle slowly stood, and faced the Archangel Raphael.  Raphael&#39;s chosen form was actually shorter than Amielle (though taller than Gemory and Toni), and Amielle tried to remember the protocol.  Should she change size?<br />
<br />
“Now relax.  I&#39;m not here to punish you.  Shall we sit?”  Raphael gestured to the couch.<br />
<br />
Amielle nodded and sat down, facing the Archangel.<br />
<br />
“Now, isn&#39;t that better?”  Raphael smiled sweetly.  <br />
<br />
“If you&#39;re not here to punish me...why are you here?”  Amielle asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, well, I&#39;m taking charge of the investigation.  Which means, I&#39;m you&#39;re new boss.”<br />
<br />
Amielle felt her blood run cold.  “I won&#39;t act against Toni!”<br />
<br />
“Oh but I&#39;m fair game?” Both angels turned to see Gemory leaning against the doorway, arms folded.<br />
<br />
“GEMMY!”  Raphael moved so fast, that, from Amielle&#39;s perspective, she practically teleported (which Angels can do, but it takes a lot of energy so it was done rarely), glomping onto Gemory and bowling the Duke of Hell over.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ve missed you soooo much!” Raphael had ended up straddling the smaller girl, and Gemory was momentarily gobsmacked.<br />
<br />
But then...  “Get off of me, you love freak!”<br />
<br />
“Oh Gemmy, you haven&#39;t changed a bit!”  Raphael leaned down and gave Gemory a kiss on the lips before rising and offering a hand to the fallen...Fallen.<br />
<br />
Gemory sputtered.  “Bleh, Angel slobber!”  She wiped her mouth, then, with a growl, took Raphael&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
The Archangel helped her (rival/enemy?) up with a huge smile, then hugged her.<br />
<br />
Gemory, for her part, put up with it for a few moments before pushing Raphael away.  “Have you taken leave of your senses, Raphael?  Have you forgotten we&#39;re enemies?!”<br />
<br />
Raphael pouted.  “But that was so long ago...weren&#39;t we friends once?”<br />
<br />
“I guess the part where you cut my wings off and punted me over the edge of Heaven has skipped whatever passes for your brain, you senile love-addled nitwit!”  Gemory&#39;s eyes lit up like blazing hot coals.<br />
<br />
“I said I was sorry!”  Raphael got down on one knee, held up both hands as if she were praying, and bowed her head.<br />
<br />
Amielle had seen that gesture before...it took her a moment to place, it, but then it came to her.  She&#39;d seen a girl in an anime do this before!<br />
<br />
“Oh for the love of Lucifer, stop.”  Gemory sighed.  “I despise you, you know that?”<br />
<br />
“Whyever for, Sempai?”  Rapahael grinned.  Well that cinched it.  The Angel of Love was an anime Otaku.<br />
<br />
“Because it&#39;s impossible to stay angry with you when you act like a lunatic!”  Gemory smacked Raphael on the top of her head.  Then yelped when her hand started smoking!  “Damn it all!  I forgot about your 20,000 watt halo!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, Gemmy.  Do you want me to kiss it and make it better?”  Raphael offered.<br />
<br />
“No!  I&#39;m engaged, you deranged nutcase!”  Gemory protested.<br />
<br />
“Oooh, I heard!  I hope you&#39;ll invite me to the wedding!  I mean, I know I can&#39;t expect to be a bridesmaid, but I&#39;d love to see it!”  Raphael gushed.<br />
<br />
“Oh sure, that will go over well.  The bride&#39;s family on one side, a pack of devils on the other, and you.”  Gemory groused.<br />
<br />
“But aren&#39;t I family?”  Raphael pouted.<br />
<br />
“Oh sure, sure, I expect you&#39;ll want to sit in the same row as Luci?”  Gemory waggled her eyebrows.<br />
<br />
“Ah, no, that probably wouldn&#39;t be a great idea.”  Raphael deflated a bit.<br />
<br />
“Well I guess palling around with Raziel has helped you gain some common sense.  Now what&#39;s this about you taking charge?”  Gemory folded her arms again.<br />
<br />
“Well, there are a few complications, like the fact that you, Gemmy are in capital-L looooove!”<br />
<br />
Gemory blushed a little, and the fire in her eyes dimmed for a moment.  “I...well, that is...”<br />
<br />
“Ah ah ah!  You can&#39;t deny it!”  Raphael waggled her finger.<br />
<br />
“I wasn&#39;t going to!  I love Danielle Western and I want everyone to know it!”  Gemory yelled, then realized what she&#39;d said and put her hands over her mouth.<br />
<br />
Slender, yet strong arms wrapped around the Devil from behind as Danielle entered the room behind Gemory.  “You don&#39;t know how happy I am to hear that, love.”<br />
<br />
All the fight went out of Gemory and a serene, contented smile appeared on her face.  The expression looked so odd on the Duke that Amielle wasn&#39;t sure what to think of it.<br />
<br />
Raphael, however, seemed elated.  “So, it IS true!”  She took one of Danielle&#39;s hands and shook it.  “Congratulations, Miss Western.  My Sister is a fine catch!  Welcome to the family!”<br />
<br />
“We are NOT Sisters!”  Ok, well, maybe not all of the fight had gone out of Gemory.<br />
<br />
“Oh?  And how would you define it?  Were we not Created by the same God?  Or are you still insisting you&#39;re a boy?”  Raphael raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“...idontwanttotalkaboutit...” Gemory mumbled.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, you know who I am, but I have no idea who you are.  Another Angel, I&#39;m guessing?”  Danielle asked.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s right.  I&#39;m the Angel of Love, Raphael, at your service!”<br />
<br />
“Wait...the Archangel Raphael?”  Dani blinked.  “You&#39;re like, a big deal, right?”<br />
<br />
“Oh no, Archangel is a fairly low rank.  Just above Angels like Amielle, nothing special about me.”  Raphael insisted.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s a load of bullshit.  Don&#39;t listen to her lies, Danielle.  She&#39;s one of the Famous Four.”  Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
“Angels can&#39;t lie, don&#39;t be mean Gemory.”  Raphael protested.<br />
<br />
“But they can bend the truth, unless they are directly asked a question.”  Gemory pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Famous Four?”  Danielle looked confused.<br />
<br />
“Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, and Uriel.”  Amielle supplied.  “Their deeds have far outstripped their rank, to the point even most humans have heard about them.  Well, maybe not Uriel.”  She admitted.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Uriel always says she&#39;s our George Harrison”, Raphael added.<br />
<br />
“That must make you Ringo Starr.” Gemory teased.<br />
<br />
“Well he was the heart of the Beatles.  I can live with that.”  Raphael grinned.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I take that back.  You&#39;re too much of a prima donna.  You have to be Paul.”  Gemory corrected.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m starting to think I should read the Bible or something, with all these Angels popping up.”  Danielle shook her head.<br />
<br />
In unison, Raphael and Gemory said, “Please don&#39;t!”<br />
<br />
Gemory glared at Raphael, who shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh, why not?”  Danielle blinked.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;d just get confused.  While the Bible is the Word of God, it has been interpreted by Man, and it&#39;s not always..precise.”  Raphael explained.<br />
<br />
“Interpreted, huh?  Is that the word you want to go with?  The book is full of lies, and men have been changing it around for centuries to suit their own agendas.”  Gemory sounded smug.<br />
<br />
“Oh and I suppose you had nothing to do with that, Sis?”  Raphael countered.<br />
<br />
“Not your Sister, and if I did, so what of it?  I&#39;m EVIL, you daft twat!”  Gemory growled.<br />
<br />
“Gem, be nice.  Even if you don&#39;t like her, she&#39;s family, right?”  Danielle put a hand on Gemory&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Gemory looked like she wanted to say something, but instead nodded, suddenly subdued.  “Kay.”<br />
<br />
Raphael looked at the two of them, then to Amielle.  “I&#39;ve seen it with my own eyes, you were right, Amielle.”<br />
<br />
“Right about what?”  Danielle asked.<br />
<br />
“No ordinary love could tame a Devil like Gemory.  What you two have, is True Love.”  Raphael explained.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s...impossible.”  Gemory protested.<br />
<br />
“True Love?  Like, what The Princess Bride?”  Danielle sounded confused.<br />
<br />
“I love that movie!” Raphael gushed.  “And, well, in a word, yes.  Love has many degrees and forms it can take, but the purest, truest love, is heartfelt, unconditional, and reciprocated equally- simply put, your love for one another is so strong, it creates a positive feeback loop, becoming ever stronger!  It&#39;s an uncontrolled chain reaction!”<br />
<br />
“Uh, that sounds dangerous.”  Danielle seemed worried.<br />
<br />
“It can be.”  Raphael admitted in a more sober tone.  “A strong emotion, no matter how positive, can trigger other emotions.  Just as you love more fiercely, you can hate more fiercely.  Be more afraid.  More jealous.  However, if you can ride out the storm, your love can overwhelm these other emotions and grow stronger for it, like tempering the blade of a sword.”<br />
<br />
“Demons can&#39;t...love like that.”  Gemory sounded uncomfortable.  “Even if...we want to.”<br />
<br />
“Why not?  You used to love that way.”  Raphael said.<br />
<br />
“UNTIL GOD BETRAYED US!”  Gemory shouted.<br />
<br />
The two Angels winced, and even Danielle felt unnerved, but she just crouched down and held Gemory tightly, even as the Devil&#39;s body trembled.<br />
<br />
Toni had come out of nowhere to hold Amielle, who was cowering behind the couch.  Raphael, for her part, quickly regained her composure.<br />
<br />
“Sister, I love you more than you realize.  But my goodness, you can hold a grudge for a long time.  Do you realize how long it&#39;s been?”  Raphael folded her arms, mirroring Gemory&#39;s usual pose.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s been one million years or two million years!  IT STILL HURTS!”  Gemory was crying now, even as Danielle sat down and pulled the demoness into her lap.<br />
<br />
Raphael suddenly looked very sad.  “I&#39;m sorry.  I shouldn&#39;t have come.”  She headed for the door, then paused.  “Amielle, I&#39;ll contact you soon.”<br />
<br />
And before anyone could react, the Angel of Love had fled Kingsley House.<br />
<br />
But Danielle was able to see the tears in the Archangel&#39;s eyes.</p>
