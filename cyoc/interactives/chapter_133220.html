<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trey didn&#39;t want to be at this party. Trey usually didn&#39;t go to parties like this. He knew that he was only invited because he made it into the football team just barely, because someone else pulled out. Even then Trey was a thin, stick insect of a man, with beige-like hair, that could of easily been pushed around in a single game of football. He wasn&#39;t even sure why he joined the football team. He didn&#39;t really enjoy football. He only wanted to be popular and liked, hence why he went to this party. He checked his phone for the time. 11:54 pm. &quot;That&#39;s it&quot; he thought &quot;I&#39;m calling a cab&quot;. He immediately looked through Google to find a contact that was close to where the party was being held, and called the phone number to get the fastest cab out of here.<br />
<br />
&quot;...okay, thank you&quot; Trey replied as he ended the call. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeey, Trey!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god&quot; Trey thought. <br />
<br />
Brent Hardacre. The football jock. Brain the size of a walnut with the below-average IQ of a P.E. Teacher, which isn&#39;t surprising knowing that his father IS the P.E. Teacher. Trey tried to keep a brave face on as Brent stumbled drunkenly towards him. &quot;H-hey Brent&quot; Trey said awkwardly. &quot;You gonna have a drink with usss?&quot; slurred Brent, trying to keep his balance. &quot;Nah, man, I&#39;m uh heading out, it&#39;s been fun though&quot; Trey lied through his teeth. Brent immediately sobered up as soon as he heard the word &quot;no&quot;, to him, the word &quot;no&quot; ,when it comes to drinking, doesn&#39;t exist. It feels forbidden to him. &quot;Wait, so you&#39;re not gonna have a drink at all?&quot; questioned Brent. &quot;No, it&#39;s fine, I&#39;m just waiting for my ride home&quot; Trey responded. Brent found it, the way that he could get this &quot;kid&quot; to drink. Make him drink during the wait for his ride. All Brent had to do was somehow guilt trip Trey. &quot;Come on, man. You are one of the popular kids, aren&#39;t ya?&quot; Brent teased. Trey knew that Brent disliked him. Brent was always waiting for Trey to prove himself that he was sporty and popular. He knew if Brent didn&#39;t see Trey the same way as the other Football players, he would be a nobody for the rest of the year. Still, Trey resisted. &quot;I&#39;m good, man&quot; &quot;Oh come on, have a drink, co-&quot; Brent responded, until he thought of the greatest idea, according to him, which isn&#39;t the most intelligent idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY EVERYBODY, TREY IS GONNA SCULL HIS FIRST DRINK TONIGHT&quot; Brent yelled to everyone in sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no&quot; Trey said, under his breath. Peer pressure is something that Trey couldn&#39;t really handle. When it was a small group of 4 or 5 people, he could handle it. 5 or 6, maybe. 6 or 7, possibly. 7 or 8, not at all. Brent had gathered at least 16 people who wanted to see this or just followed Brent&#39;s word since he was the most popular guy in school. Trey was surrounded by people, making him feel uneasy. He went to check his phone, just to keep his eyes off the crowd of people. He checked the time. 11:57 pm. 3 minutes until the cab arrived. &quot;Great&quot; Trey thought, as Brent advanced towards him. &quot;Come on, man. Do it!&quot; Straight after he spoke, he started chanting &quot;Do it!&quot;, saying it louder and louder each chant. Brent lifted his hands to make everybody watching chant with him. Soon everyone around him was chanting &quot;Do it! Do it! DO IT!&quot; to Trey. The peer pressure finally got to Trey, he didn&#39;t want to do it, but he didn&#39;t want to disappoint anyone. He swallowed his pride, and turned to the cups on the table. They were already filled with whatever alcohol they had at the party, but he had to drink one. He slowly moved his hand towards the cup in the middle of the table. The reason: It was the cleanest cup there. He grasped the cup with his bony hands, and lifted it towards his neck. The chanting became louder and louder as it reached his mouth. He had to do it now, there was no way he could say &quot;no&quot; now. He lifted the cup towards his lips, swallowed his dignity, and chugged it until there was no more.<br />
<br />
As soon as he dropped the cup down to his chest, the crowd roared with cheers. Trey, slightly embarrassed, itched his chest through his shirt. His cab rocked up as soon as he walked past the crowd. Trey was annoyed with the whole party that he didn&#39;t speak to anyone who were congratulating him, including Brent. Trey opened the door to the cab, went inside and slightly slammed the door. &quot;Where do you want to go?&quot; questioned the taxi driver. &quot;I just want to go home&quot; Trey answered, giving his street address so the driver knew where to go. Trey looked out the window as the car drove off, seeing the crowd of people that crowded him drunkenly wave at him. During the drive, his chest started to itch again. It was more painful than it was before, spreading a little more than the first itch. Trey was just 6 minutes away from his house, he would check what has been itching him then. <br />
<br />
7 minutes later.<br />
<br />
The taxi finally made it to his house, after a minute of the taxi driver being confused on where the house was. Trey, exhausted and annoyed, paid the taxi driver without speaking to him, and left the car to enter his house. Trey closed the door and turned on the lights, he had to have some food after the awful taste of the alcohol he had. He walked to the kitchen, noticing a note on the kitchen table. Wondering why, Trey read the letter. <br />
<br />
Dear Trey,<br />
<br />
Take care of yourself when we are away. There is food in the fridge if you are feeling hungry. <br />
<br />
Love Mom and Dad. <br />
<br />
His parents were away on a business trip, both of them worked in the same company, different fields, of course, but still close together. Trey completely forgot about they were away. The mention of food in the fridge made him hungrier than he was before. Trey opened the fridge to see if there was anything he fancied. He found a bowl of Mac and cheese covered in cling-film, grabbed it, removed the cling-film and stuck it in the microwave for 45 seconds. The smell of cheese flooded his nostrils, it was so overpowering. Trey took it out of the microwave before it was finished, grabbed a fork and began to chow down on the cool Mac and cheese. A couple of bites in and he was feeling the itch on his chest again, far more painful than it was before in the cab. He couldn&#39;t handle it anymore and rushed to the bathroom. Trey itched it through his shirt, but that didn&#39;t seem to stop it. He had to take off his shirt to see what it was, and as he did, he looked in the mirror with shock.<br />
<br />
Fur. White and grey fur. On his chest. His fur. Trey&#39;s heart skipped a beat, he was breathing heavily, and all the fur did was start to spread. Trey watched as his front teeth extended to his bottom lip and the area around his nose started growing whiskers. He had to find a way to stop it somehow, but how? How could he treat something like this? He would probably go to Area 51 rather than a hospital as soon as people saw him. His bony hands lengthened into claws, and the base of his feet lifted into his ankle. His new claws shook with fear, as Trey continued to look at himself in fear. His ears started to stretch like taffy onto the top of his head and became more rounded. The fur was spreading more and more that it was reaching his lower-half. He didn&#39;t know how, but he had to get his pants off. The fur made it uncomfortable for him to wear. His claws thankfully still had his thumbs, albeit mouse-like thumbs, and with a swift movement, he took off his pants. Fur covered his legs and stomach that it practically covered him all over. He felt something push by the base of his spine. He noticed that something was pushing out by his back. He stopped breathing for a second as soon as he turned around. &quot;A tail&quot; Trey breathlessly spoke &quot;I&#39;ve got a FU-&quot; Trey stopped as his face felt like it was pushed out. His jaw spread forward while his nose became a pale pink. After all the pain, he opened his eyes. There before him was a mouse. A mouse that retained it&#39;s human shape. It was him. He was the mouse.</p>
