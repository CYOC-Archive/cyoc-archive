<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Whatever Alex intended to say to Sigg was lost from a knock on the door. Olin stepped in without waiting for an answer, acting like he owned the place. Though considering he was king, he very well might, Alex thought. He was certainly more dressed for it this time, too. Instead of the work pants and boots with his chest exposed he wore a belted tunic, finely decorated but still sleeveless to show off the tattoos decorating his shoulders and arms, and around his brow was a thick golden circlet. He was still wearing the scuffed up work boots, which amused Alex for some reason. &quot;Enjoy your walk?&quot; Olin asked cheerily.<br />
<br />
Sigg stared at Olin like he was about to get into some deep trouble. &quot;I.. I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t think..&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex hopped up from his seat. &quot;I asked him to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Olin made a shushing noise and waved off Sigg. &quot;It&#39;s fine. Maybe its a good thing, stories are already spreading around of a too tall not quite dwarf stranger without any braids in his beard. We may be a stoic lot, but we do like our stories. It&#39;d get around eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex reached up and touched his beard at the mention of braids, making Olin laugh a deep belly laugh. &quot;Once you&#39;re an adult you should be wearing braids. Only younglings don&#39;t, but that&#39;s not important now.&quot; Olin sat down on one of the chairs, motioning for both Alex and Sigg to take a seat. &quot;I&#39;ve just had a nice long talk with the clan council about what we should do with you. It&#39;s been a long time since a Dwarthricite forged dwarf joined us. Not many outsiders are eager to make become on of us, in fact in the last decades many of our younglings have left to become city dwarves, or worse gave up their dwarveness altogether. It may not seem it from our bustling home, but our people are fading.&quot; Olin let out a deep harrumph on what he thought about that.<br />
<br />
For some reason, Sigg winced at that. Alex wanted to ask why but Olin kept rolling on. &quot;So we decided we&#39;d be happy to welcome you as a guest among us for a fortnight. You may take advantage of our hospitality freely, but by the end of that time you must either move on, or else petition a clan for membership and join us. Pretty much all the clans seemed interested in welcoming you if you wanted, so there&#39;d be no problem there.&quot; Olin made a small humming noise and stroked his beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Either way, we&#39;d need to keep that.&quot; Olin said with a nod towards the Dwarthricite crystal. &quot;Though we will compensate you of course, we are not thieves. If you leave we&#39;ll give you enough riches that you could set up your own noble house in the nations above. If you stayed, well, we don&#39;t work that way, but it would result in you having a fairly high standing in our society for the value of your contributions.&quot; Olin grinned slyly. &quot;Which is why any clan would be happy to have you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure I..&quot; Alex started but Olin cut him off with a gesture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think on it, enjoy our hospitality. You have time.&quot; Olin stood already heading towards the door. &quot;Oh, and the clan council agrees that Sigg here should be your chaperone and guide during your time among us. I hope that won&#39;t be a problem, Sigg.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a question and Sigg furiously shook his head that no, it was not a problem. &quot;Ah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Olin reached into the pouch on his belt and produced a small wooden box he placed on the table. &quot;A gift to welcome you.&quot; Olin looked to Sigg. &quot;Put some proper braids in his beard once it&#39;s long enough. Some of the elders were quite scandalized.&quot; Olin chuckled, amused before he left, not even waiting for  proper farewell, and as brusque as he entered. Alex had a feeling that most of the dwarves would be like that. Direct, blunt, and honest.<br />
<br />
Alex reached out to open the lid of the box. Inside were various beads, rings, and amulets. He recognized them immediately as being some of the beard decorations pretty much every dwarf wore. From what little Alex knew of such things, back home this would have been a small fortune in precious metals and gems. &quot;Sorry.&quot; Alex said looking to Sigg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? For what?&quot; The blond dwarf turned his attention back to Alex and away from where Olin had been standing.<br />
<br />
&quot;My outburst before... and for being stuck with me.&quot; Alex said with a nod to the box.<br />
<br />
Sigg grinned, white teeth bright behind his golden hued beard. For a moment Alex found himself fantasizing about playing with those braided moustaches and almost missed what Sigg said to him. &quot;I was going to volunteer to be your guide anyway, saves me the trouble.&quot; Sigg looked into his eyes and chuckled. &quot;You&#39;re worse than a youngling with his first chin hairs, preening and stroking like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex hadn&#39;t realized he was running the back of one of his hands over his sideburns as he played with some of he beads in the box. Blushing furiously he shut the box lid and put his hand down on the table. &quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t know what keeps coming over me, it&#39;s like..&quot; Alex could only think to describe it as when a guy first figures out how to jerk off, but didn&#39;t say it. Instead he felt a rough hand cover his.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. We all go through it.&quot; Sigg reached out and put his other hand on Alex&#39;s cheek, his thick fingers stroking the brown fuzz under them. Alex found himself leaning into the hand, but also wanting to jerk away. Sigg laughed cheerily. &quot;It&#39;ll calm some, eventually. But everyone thinks us dwarves a somber and stoic bunch, focused on just our work. Truth is that&#39;s how we distract ourselves. In private, though..&quot; Sigg leaned forward and for the second time that day planted a rough but eager kiss on Alex&#39;s lips. Alex found himself eagerly returning the kiss, his hand wrapping around the dwarf&#39;s, their fingers intertwined.<br />
<br />
Soon they were both on their feet, clothes coming off and flying about the room as they carelessly tossed them about. Alex barely registered that he didn&#39;t stand as much taller than Sigg as he did this morning, that Sigg didn&#39;t have to go on tippy toes and yank his head down to kiss him as they made their way to the bed.<br />
<br />
The dwarf placed both his hands on Alex&#39;s newly furred chest and pushed him back onto the bed, climbing a top the former human and straddling him, their cocks laying side by side on Alex&#39;s fuzzy stomach. Alex&#39;s was the longer, but he noticed with some surprised that Sigg&#39;s was the thicker tool.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s hands went to Sigg&#39;s waist, then around to grab at his ass cheeks, which like his stomach were thickly muscled with some soft padding rounding it out into a pair of orbs, covered in a light dusting of fuzz. Sigg lifted himself up, grabbed Alex&#39;s cock, and began to lower himself on to it. Alex wanted to squirm in pleasure. It was warm, and tight, and felt.. perfect. Like Sigg&#39;s backside was made just to fit his tool. &quot;Are.. are you.. sure about this?&quot; Alex panted as Sigg began to rise up and lower himself on to the cock in an even steady rhythm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to make you want to stay.&quot; Sigg said with another big smile, and a deep and rumbling laugh. &quot;Grab it, I know you want to.&quot; At first Alex thought Sigg meant his cock, but his hand seemed to move on its own, reaching up to run his finger&#39;s through Sigg&#39;s golden beard. &quot;See? You&#39;re practically one of us already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sigg roughly massages Alex&#39;s chest muscles as he continued to work that cock, and Alex found himself quickly approaching orgasm. &quot;I&#39;m.. I&#39;m..&quot; Sigg roughly hilted himself right onto Alex&#39;s lap, his gut being flooded with the once-human&#39;s cum. Sigg&#39;s own cock exploding thick white cream across Alex&#39;s furry torso. They stayed like that for a few minutes, both panting heavily before Sigg rolled off of Alex&#39;s softening rod with a slick pop. He reached over the side of the bed and grabbed the rough tunic Alex had been wearing and used it to clean his own cum out of Alex&#39;s body hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.. did that help?&quot; Sigg asked, sounding like he already knew the answer. Alex just nodded as he lay on the bed, partially stupefied. A moment later, Sigg was sidling up next to him, wrapping a pair of thick, strong arms around him and pulling him in to a spoon, even if Sigg was the shorter one, it didn&#39;t feel so in that moment. Alex felt comfortable and right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Alex managed to ask finally, his back pressed against Sigg&#39;s chest and stomach, one of the dwarf&#39;s hands teasing a nipple as the other stroked his still short beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I think we&#39;re going to be good friends, and you&#39;re going to be a very handsome dwarf, so I wanted first dibs.&quot; Sigg replied with a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Alex asked, his eyes locking onto the crystal that glowed softly not far from where they lay, he hadn&#39;t noticed before but it wasn&#39;t a steady glow, it pulsed very slightly, like a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What more do I need?&quot; Sigg replied, sounding perfectly satisfied and content. &quot;Sleep, we can talk when you wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex did find himself drifting off, comfortable in Sigg&#39;s arms and even with Sigg&#39;s cock resting between his ass cheeks, not that the dwarf seemed ready to go on to round two quite yet. There was still something strange Alex couldn&#39;t quite put his finger on, but it slipped through his thoughts as he dozed off to sleep.</p>
