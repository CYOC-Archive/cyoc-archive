<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, a long way away from where David had just transformed, James (who had started the situation) was watching TV earlier that morning. James noticed a few odd stories about small crowds of homosexual, Speedo clad men roaming the streets in a smaller town nearby. He hadn't intended for the problem to inflate to that level...he had to correct what he had done.<br />
<br />
He had caught a bus soon afterwards to the town; as he stepped out, he noticed the shop where the Speedo merchandise was flooding in. As he watched from a distance, he noticed a young boy, about 13 years old run from the shop into an alley aong side the store. Spying into the shop, he made out a crowd of Speedo men smothering the floor with their bodies as they had sex with each other. James slowly put his hand into his pocket and withdrew the Maker Device. He was sure all he had to do was utilise the &quot;Return to Default&quot; program, and so with careful aim at the entire crowd, he activated it.<br />
<br />
Like film speeding up, the men began to change back to their regular forms. The Speedos transformed back into what they should be; ranging from baggy pairs of boxer shorts to underpants or even board shorts. Hair sprouted from the majority of the men's chests, and most of the abs and muscles faded away along with the stunning tans. The hair atop a few of the mens' heads also faded away into baldness; but the only thing that truly disappointed the men was their deflating packages. A few of the Speedo Men had actually been younger males, 10 or so in their teens where hanging around back, looking around nervously. Everyone was their regular selves again, just without any decent clothing.<br />
<br />
Slowly, it began to sink into the confused crowd what had happened to them.<br />
&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; one man murmured, setting off the entire room into a low conversation. One by one, the men and boys picked up their clothes that lay across the floor, mostly in tatters now and dressed back up before fleeing back to their homes to hide in case the transformation was to occur again. Everything was relatively okay.<br />
<br />
James was now the only one left in the store, so he decided to have a look around to make sure everything was okay. He stepped up to one of the crates near the front and gasped at what he saw: an entire batch of red Speedos sat there, tempting him to grab one, to try one on. Resisting this urge, he raised the Maker device to neutralise the Speedos back to board shorts.<br />
<br />
As he clicked through the files, he heard a noise behind him. He quickly spun around...there was no one there. Sighing, he turned back around, and there in front of him was David, one of the last Speedo Men, his boner etched out against the tight red spandex. David smiled, and with a quick smack of his hand, the Maker device flew across the room and shattered against the wall. James looked at the remains in disbelief. What was he going to do?<br />
<br />
David slowly moved closer and closer to James; his only escape was now blocked by the contagious muscle man in front of him.<br />
&quot;S...stay away...&quot; James stammered as he reached around behind him for a weapon of some sort.<br />
David continued to smile. &quot;What are you going to do?&quot;<br />
James was now cornered against the crate of Speedos, with no where to run. He shot a look over his shoulder for a means of escape, but it was in these few seconds that David took his chance and lunged at James. <br />
&quot;Argh!!!&quot; James shouted as he leant backwards to avoid his hands, tumbling into the Speedo crate. He deserately tried to climb out, to get out of the cell he was stuck in. However, the more he struggled, the more Speedos tumbled across onto him, burying him in a pit of spandex.<br />
<br />
James felt the smooth cool feeling of the Speedo wrap around his body like a blanket. It took him a moment to realise his clothes had dissolved into nothingness. He clung for his shorts, which were slowly fading away into shadows. <br />
&quot;No...&quot; he murmured as he desperately tried to hang onto them in vain. <br />
It was too late...all of his clothes were gone now...James was sure he had to get out then or he would never have a chance. He sprung out from the pile of Speedos using a sudden burst of energy. David was still there in front of him, but something was causing his smile to spread even wider.<br />
&quot;Nice...&quot; David laughed. James gazed down at himself; somehow, one of the Speedos had found its way to its home position across his crotch and ass. As he looked up at David, he felt his penis enlarge and fill the tight material. His entire body had inflated in muscle to match that of David, and as the tan slowly set into his body, so did his lust for men...any man would satisfy this urge...he just needed to have one...</p>
