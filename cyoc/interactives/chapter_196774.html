<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the night wore on both kitsune found themselves slowly becoming more at ease. For the two warriors, keeping vigil during the night was a familiar feeling. Akira and Fukushu now found themselves talking of old times, <br />
<br />
&quot;I never understood why you would subject yourself to night watch Fukushu,&quot; Akira stated. &quot;You were the son of Tatsu, General of the army, why would you stand guard with the average kitsune soldier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always thought of myself as a soldier,&quot; Fukushu shrugged. &quot;No better than any of the men under my command. How are you to lead if you think yourself better than your subordinates?&quot;<br />
<br />
:i always felt the same way,&quot; Akira stated. Fukushu nodded, giving his former apprentice a small grin. &quot;And that is why I choose you as my second in command. You thought as I did, cared for your soldiers and thought of yourself as one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira simply nodded, leaning back in his chair as he cast his vision towards the ceiling. &quot;It was a simpler time then,&quot; he said softly. Fukushu nodded on response, their time in the kitsune army was indeed far less complicated than their recent history.<br />
<br />
Fukushu now paused, his vision narrowing as he moved towards the window. &quot;Their is someone out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira jumped to his feet, quickly joining Fukushu before sighing in relief. &quot;It is just children.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu narrowed his eyes, these &quot;children&quot; as Akira stated looked close to adulthood. While his old apprentice may not have any problem with interlopers, Fukushu was far more cautious. He would take the necessary precautions to keep his family safe.<br />
<br />
**************************<br />
<br />
Rick wiped his mouth as he finished off yet another beer. The 17 year old had made his way up to the old witches house, for no other than a cheesy thrill. The fact that his girlfriend Beth believed in all the old stories caused the teen to smirk. Beth now clung to his arm as she nervously glanced at the Mishimura estate. &quot;Rick we should go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax babe,&quot; he grinned, pulling the frightened girl closer. &quot;I&#39;ll keep you safe from the big bad witch.&quot; This seemed to put the petite blond at ease as she cuddled closer to him. &quot;Yo Matt we got any more beer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ricks friend Matt now opened the trunk to Rick&#39;s car, fishing out another can that he tossed to his friend. &quot;Starting to run low bro,&quot; he said. &quot;Only six left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you you should&#39;ve bought more than two 12 packs,&quot; Matt&#39;s girlfriend Nicole grumbled. &quot;And why the hell did we come up here? This place gives me the creeps.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because there&#39;s no one around,&quot; Rick answered. &quot;Besides, thought you liked scary stuff Nicole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Movies not creepy old houses,&quot; she grumbled, tossing her brunette hair over her shoulder. Rick scoffed, Nicole maybe a cheerleader but she could be such a bitch sometimes. Glancing at the Mishimura house he didn&#39;t know why everyone always thought the place was haunted. Yes it was older, standing out amongst the darkened sky like some Gothic manor, but ghosts? Monsters? Rick simply  chalked it up to small town superstition. Thats what coach always said, small towns can be superstitious.<br />
<br />
&quot;So anyone got any plans for the summer,&quot; Matt asked. Rick shrugged, most likely he would keep dating Beth over the summer, in between workouts with Matt. The two were going to make a big impact for the football team for senior year. After that, Rick didn&#39;t know. His grades weren&#39;t the greatest but his father told him he couldn&#39;t just hang around the house. Maybe he would get a job at the Soul Drive plant. Their had been an announcement not too long ago about a plant being built nearby. They offered good pay and benefits and even better he didn&#39;t need a college degree. Maybe that was the answer. For now thought he needed to pee.<br />
<br />
Stepping away from Beth, Rick now stood before the Mishimura estate as he unzipped his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing,&quot; Beth exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What babe I gotta take a leak,&quot; he responded. Letting out a contented sigh, Rick now began to urinate on Yuriko&#39;s lawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you crazy,&quot; Beth yelled in alarm. &quot;That place is haunted! You trying to invoke a curse or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick simply scoffed as his bladder continues to empty. Curses. Monsters. It was all a bunch of superstitious nonsense.<br />
<br />
Or so he thought.<br />
<br />
An orange tail flew from the darkness of a nearby tree, wrapping itself around Rick before squeezing him tightly. Rick was so taken by surprise that he now urinated on his own pants as he stared in fright at two glowing eyes in the darkness.<br />
<br />
Fukushu growled at the teen, watching the color drain from his young face. The scream of a teenage girl now drew his attention, a young blond pointing at him in fright. The girl and her two companions were frozen in fright, yet they could still cause quite a bit of racket.<br />
<br />
Three more tails now sped out of the darkness, ensnaring the teens on their grasp. Fukushu now used thise tails to entombed them, covering their moves as he held them above the ground. For now they couldn&#39;t make any noise as he dealt with this boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You dare desecrate this land,&quot; Fukushu hissed. Rick could do little more than whimper, his bladder draining all over his jeans as he gazed into the vengeful eyes of the kitsune in front of him.<br />
<br />
Fukushu&#39;s lips now curled into a sneer, the kitsune unsheathing his sword, which he now held against the teens shaft and scrotum. Rick&#39;s whimpering now rose an octave as he felt the cold blade against his manhood. &quot;Are you worried about losing this....little thing,&quot; Fukushu sneered.<br />
<br />
Rick&#39;s eyes began to water as his bowels now emptied inside his boxers. Fukushu&#39;s face contorted in disgust as the teen messed himself. The smell alone was putrid yet it was the teens demeanor that truely disgusted the kitsune. Listening to the boys boisterous attitude, the kitsune was disappointed to find him cowering like a scared child. Perhaps he should simply eliminate this child if for no other reason than to save him from further embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Ahem.<br />
<br />
Fukushu turned slightly, noting Akira standing in the shadows. The five tales kitaune shaking his head no. Fukushu sighed, dropping the teen. Rick&#39;s jeans now stained with his own urine and feces. &quot;Leave,&quot; Fukushu growled. &quot;And let others know that they will not be so fortunate if they desecrate this land again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick and the others scrambled to their feet, leaping into the car before speeding away as fast as possible. The sound of screeching tires echoing through the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that really necessary,&quot; Akira asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve grown soft in your time amongst wizards,&quot; Fukushu countered as he sheathed his blade. &quot;These...children have no respect if they urinate on Yurikos home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Akira stated. &quot;But frightening children is one thing. Killing them is completely different. A body will draw undue attention to Yuriko. It is better to exist solely as myth and legend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu simply scoffed as the two kitsune made their way inside. He disagreed, yet he would abide by the request to keep his family safe. &quot;We say nothing to our wives Akira.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Akira said. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure they would have our heads if they discovered what happened.&quot;</p>
