<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Was that what I think it was?&quot; Julie Stovall asked, a bit alarmed.<br />
Gun shots* always meant violence, and that was the last thing anyone in Moon Lake wanted, even if there wasn&#39;t a were involved or risk of the town&#39;s secrets being exposed.<br />
&quot;Not sure,&quot; replied her fiance Eric Anderson, uncertain if he heard what he did. &quot;They sounded too far away.&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you kids lock the back door behind you when you came in?&quot; Melissa Stovall asked, looking at her daughter.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; replied Julie, before rushing to the back door to do so.<br />
&quot;Okay. Let&#39;s head upstairs,&quot; said her mother, knowing that the rest of the Stovall residence was secured. As they rushed upstairs, Melissa couldn&#39;t help noting that while Eric and Julie held hands, he insisted on being last, to make sure the ladies were ahead of him and safe.<br />
Once on the second floor landing, the adult turned to her charges and said, &quot;Okay. Do you have any clothes here Eric?&quot;<br />
Eric blushed a bit at that, but then said all he had was his Halloween costume, and that was scattered across the backyard on their rush to get to the freshwater swimming pool and each other&#39;s arms last night.<br />
&quot;Maybe you should start leaving some stuff with me, in case...&quot; began Julie, but her mother shook her head, for now was not the time to discuss that, despite the fact their relationship had the Stovalls&#39; blessings.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see if anything of Martin&#39;s fits you,&quot; offered her mother, thinking of some of the stuff her husband had outgrown but they had yet to part with. &quot;After I call the police.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you think that&#39;s necessary?&quot; wondered Julie. &quot;I haven&#39;t heard anything since we came upstairs.&quot;<br />
&quot;Better safe than sorry,&quot; pointed out Eric, as sirens began to be heard in the distance.**<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
After they enjoyed a romantic coupling together, werefox William Anderson and his werecat wife Martha fell asleep where they laid in the woods across from the college, with his thick vulpine penis buried deeply in her hungry vagina, the top knot still lodged within its folds.<br />
As the first rays of dawn began to shine over Moon Lake, they felt someone gently nudging them.<br />
&quot;Hey you two sleepy heads,&quot; cooed werevixen Joyce Carlson, staring at the couple. &quot;It&#39;s morning. We have to defur,&quot; she added, before her foxy features retreated back to reveal her human form. &quot;But we&#39;re deep enough in the woods so we can still have some fun if you wish,&quot; said Joyce, as one bare hand started caressing her bountiful bosom as the other moved to tease her clit.<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t get arrested for public nudity?&quot; wondered Martha, as she watched the nude woman play with herself. She had taken her werecat birth control pill late Saturday afternoon, so still had hours of protection left.<br />
&quot;No. The woods across from and surrounding the college are pretty thick, so unless you happen to stumble across someone or are intentionally looking for them, we&#39;re safe,&quot; explained Joyce. &quot;It&#39;s why a lot of weres come out here. Just as long as we&#39;re not fur-ree...&quot;<br />
But Joyce&#39;s words had become moans, for Martha had kissed her husband and then crawled over to start licking the cream from in-between their new friend&#39;s legs.<br />
William watched as his wife&#39;s feline tail retreated back into her rump, Martha&#39;s ears resumed their human position and shape, and her silky fur receded into her bare skin.<br />
Yet even as a naked, normal human female, Martha was still beautiful and highly desirable in his eyes.<br />
&quot;Are we alone?&quot; William asked, even as he willed his fursona away, for now. Yet, regardless of what form he was in, there was no denying the interest expressed by his rapidly hardening cock.<br />
&quot;There might be another couple or two out here, but I haven&#39;t gone looking for them,&quot; replied Joyce between moans. &quot;I always finish any dance with the partners I started with,&quot; she added, before the black haired beauty with dark chocolate skin switched positions to return the oral flavor Martha was granting her.<br />
&quot;How long until your next were—&quot; William began to ask her.<br />
&quot;Noon,&quot; said Joyce, even as she felt her body shudder in pleasure. &quot;Now hurry up and put that dick where it belongs!&quot;<br />
&quot;With pleasure,&quot; William said with a smile, noting that all their clothes were still nearby where they left them last night before starting their threesome.<br />
Soon three naked humans were doing and enjoying everything they had before sunrise.<br />
When they would talk about it later, William and Martha would agree that while there were noticeable differences between having sex in their regular forms versus their fursonas, sex was now more enjoyable than ever before since joining were society, but they would prefer to do it furry whenever possible.<br />
They would also agree to invite Joyce to join them more often, whether it was just a girls&#39; night out or another menage a troi.<br />
The happy couple and their friend kept enjoying what was probably the favorite past time of Moon Lake until the sound of a gunshot interrupted their fun.*<br />
&quot;Was that—&quot; William began, reluctantly removing his tongue from between Joyce&#39;s legs even as Martha stopped riding his penis to take a look around.<br />
&quot;That sounded close, but there&#39;s no hunting in Moon Lake. Is there?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
&quot;Not legally,&quot; replied Joyce, breaking away from enjoying the tasty treats offered by Martha&#39;s breasts. &quot;Even in their normal forms, weres don&#39;t use guns to go hunting. We better get dressed,&quot; she added, rushing from the couple to grab her clothes as another shot was heard.<br />
The Andersons quickly joined her, the three of them rushing to put their clothes on as a couple of more shots were heard.<br />
&quot;That sounded close,&quot; commented Martha, worried.<br />
Although still in her human form, Joyce cocked an ear and said, &quot;I hate to say this, but somewhere on Wood Street, near your house.&quot;<br />
&quot;The boys!&quot; William and Martha shouted in unison, even as the sound of sirens started to fill the air.**<br />
&quot;Which one should I call first?&quot; William asked, digging his cellphone out of a pants pocket.<br />
&quot;Nate. He was supposed to spend the night with Alex. Even though he should be at or at least with Julie, I&#39;ll call Eric and make sure he&#39;s all right,&quot; replied Martha.<br />
But the worried parents didn&#39;t know that their son&#39;s cellphone was with the rest of his stuff scattered across the Stovall&#39;s backyard, as Joyce saw the concern grow on Martha&#39;s face as her attempts to contact Eric kept going straight to voice mail.<br />
