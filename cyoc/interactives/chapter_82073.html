<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...I wish that that any panties you wear will turn into one of the special kinds I'm imagining.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen instinctively crossed her hands in front of her crotch. She could feel a trembling as the magic began to affect her clothing.  Kyle laughed at her embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd love to stay and see the look on your face as those finish transforming, but Lauren needs my cock inside her.&quot;  The scrawny freshman turned away before calling over his shoulder &quot;A bit of advice?  You might want to be seated when the bell rings.&quot; and with that he and the geisha were lost in the crowd of passing students.<br />
<br />
Jen swallowed the lump in her throat and crossed her arms over her nearly naked breasts.  She was tempted to pull off her panties where she stood rather than submit to another of Kyle's perversions, but she knew as short as her skirt had become, the first time she used the stairs or bent over everyone would know--<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmp!&quot; She flinched as her panties pulled tightly against her skin.  She felt the material shrinking in front and back as the sides climbed higher on her hips.  It was getting colder too and felt... sticky?  She owned a few explicitly sexy panties; thongs and  g-strings mostly, so she wasn't surprised when the material settled into her ass-crack.  Of course Kyle would give her a wedgie.  But it still felt odd.  She shifted from one foot to the other and was glad she'd gotten a bikini wax recently; the front barely covered her mons and felt slightly ?clingy? she guessed, and frilly at the same time.  She imagined trying to walk in something that was pulling against the skin on either side of her vagina if she hadn't trimmed her pubes and winced at the thought. <br />
<br />
Jen glanced at the passing students.  Girls in tight feminine clothes, guys all enjoying the scenery, many sporting obvious boners--which the girls were eying, appreciatively? Jen swore to herself.  Kyle was changing more than just the way people dressed, and since she only remembered the old way things were she was going to be clueless about whatever sick new social norms Kyle had invented.  She decided to head for class, no profit hiding in the lockers, and there was a bathroom on the way she could duck into and get a look at her new underwear.<br />
<br />
She hissed as the material in between has ass cheeks shaped itself into a sharp ridge pressing painfully against her body from the base of spine all the way down between her legs. The outer edge widened, spreading her ass cheeks before taking on the same fringy feeling as the front. When she clenched her ass she could feel the panties resisting and springing back into shape like some sort of kegel exercise tool. Maybe it was some kind of rubber?  Then the ridge started working its way up her front. Jen barely resisted the impulse to clutch at herself as it worked its way between her labia as she walked.  Then a sudden pain in her thighs made her stumble into a passing Junior.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay Jennifer?&quot; he was staring at her exposed breasts and was getting an obvious boner.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fine!  Sorry, just a bit sore from practicing.&quot; Jen lied and bit her lip.  Either Kyle had enlarged the guy's package, or whoever he'd been dating had been unusually discreet; the guy was seriously well hung! <br />
<br />
&quot;See anything you like?  I know I do!&quot; Jen blushed furiously as she tore her gaze off his erection. He was watching her face now, and Jen felt herself flushing even harder at his knowing expression.  He had a dusky complexion with wavy dark hair.  Good looks over-all, but not Jen's type.  Keeping his eyes locked on hers he reached over and gently stroked the side of her breast.<br />
<br />
What was she doing?! Jen railed at herself.  Sure the guy had a big schlong, and was easy on the eyes, but she was a Senior!  No way should she be letting him just cop a feel in the hallway. She had a reputation to maintain, and a boyfriend! It dawned on her that while she'd been thinking outraged thoughts she'd also been doing nothing to stop him.  He was grinning at her and Jen realized he'd begun fondling her breasts with both hands, and she was smiling back at him!<br />
<br />
&quot;If you ever need help 'practicing,' give me a call okay?&quot; He paused caressing her and waited for a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, sure!  You bet! I love practicing!&quot; Jen heard herself babbling like some star-struck tween. What the hell?!  She was even leaning into his hands a bit!<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure you do, the cheer squad is famous for it after all.&quot; He grinned and tugged gently on Jen's breasts, pulling her forward into a brief kiss. She reciprocated automatically, trying to get her mind off the huge cock digging against her belly. He let go and stepped back, running an appreciative gaze over her tits, legs, and back up again. &quot;Tony Spinoza, my numbers in the directory.  Okay? You won't forget?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No danger of that, thanks Tony!&quot; Jen heard herself say cheerfully and found herself waving  to jiggle her tits as he turned and kept walking.  Jen blinked, it was like her mind was coming out of a fog.  She spotted the bathroom and started walking towards it, again feeling a sharp pain between her legs.<br />
<br />
After a couple steps she found a way to walk that didn't pinch her legs around what felt like a flat bar with sharp edges running between her legs. She was rolling her hips like crazy between the heels and underwear, but at least she wasn't in pain--down there anyway. Jen tried to ignore how her breasts were flying around.  They hurt at full extension, but seemed to bounce back into shape without any harm.  As she approached the door she froze, feeling some sort of knob pressing against her asshole. She took a tentative step and winced as she felt the knob slip into her sphincter and start to mushroom inside her. Each step she took tugged at her asshole, sending unwelcome shivers racing up her spine.  In front the intrusion between her pussy lips felt like it was widening, spreading them the way her ass was being spread. Jesus! what kind of imagination did that freshmen kid have!<br />
<br />
She made it into the bathroom and and queued up waiting for a stall.  She had to plant her legs spread to keep the bar from pinching, but it didn't look too awkward, more like her thighs had chaffed and she was keeping them from rubbing together.  The other girls were fixing hair and makeup.  High heels, fishnets, plunging necklines, and tiny skirts were much in evidence.  Jen sneered slightly.  She spotted several ways each girl might have better presented her assets, apparently fashion sense wasn't included in Kyle's changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Tony Spin-za huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen glanced at the girl behind her in line. Kortney Drescher, another senior, though not part of Jen's social circle.  A tall brunette with a decently large rack, she'd gone for a more classy look, kind of like the teachers Jen had seen in passing, though the box-cut of her neckline was anything but demure.<br />
<br />
Kortney touched up her lipstick in a compact without looking at Jennifer.  &quot;I wouldn't mind draining his ball sack, if you know what I mean.&quot; She blew a kiss at her reflection and tucked the compact away into her cleavage. &quot;You girls on the cheer squad got a real advantage with your tits on display like that.&quot; She looked critically at Jen's breasts. &quot;Mine are bigger, but I couldn't cum fast enough in the tryouts to make the cut.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen felt her jar hanging open. Girls competed? to display themselves for men, and cheer squad required speed orgasm tryouts? &quot;I, I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're up next Blondie, try not to be too loud, okay?  Sounds great on the field, but in a space this small it'd be oppressive.&quot;  Kortney smirked at Jen like she'd just counted coup.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I don't..&quot;Jen struggled to think why she'd be loud in a bathroom stall. She didn't piss hard, or fart loudly, and why would that matter on the field? She looked at the taller girl and blushed in confusion and frustration over the handicap Kyle'd given her. She shifted her weight and clutched at her crotch; her panties had kept working themselves deeper into her pussy as she'd been standing there and were starting to swell into the unmistakable sensation of a dildo trusting ever deeper into her loins.<br />
<br />
Kortney stopped smirking and stared curiously at Jen. &quot;Wow, he got you really worked up didn't he?  And didn't have the courtesy to finish you off.  Typical guy, clit teases the lot of them; show off a big rod in their pants and leave you wet and panting for release.&quot;  She took Jen by the elbow and walked her over to an open stall.  Inside was a combo toilet and bidet. &quot;Okay, you settle yourself in and go to town 'til you can think clearly again, okay?  That's right.&quot; Kortney gave Jen a little push and pulled the door closed behind her.<br />
<br />
Jen absently flipped the catch and thought about what she'd heard.  'Clit-tease' instead of cock tease, girls needing to get off after getting aroused--like blue balls she guessed, only instead of pain they felt, what? Kortney had treated her like she was a child. Jen thought about the way she'd acted once she was presented with Tony's massive wang and realized she was grinning again at the memory of it.  Not childish, but dumber, Jen decided. Kyle had changed things so women get dumber when they become aroused, and, what? don't get smarter until they've come?  But she'd recovered, hadn't she? Jen frowned, she might be fooling herself, or she might be different since she didn't remember the world the way everyone else did.<br />
<br />
Jen was distracted from her thoughts by her underwear giving a final shiver and settling into place.  Biting her lip Jen hesitantly raised her skirt to take a look.  She was wearing something shaped like french-cut panties made of a soft but resilient silicone rubber in the school colors. They were smooth on the outside, but tacky and clinging against her skin. Jen felt her pulse speed up as she ran a finger under the frilly edge. Her pussy was unfolded, lips spread wide and her inner folds stretched out trapped in faintly translucent rubber like some kind of bas relief sculpture. She could see droplets of her own juices gathering under the silicone. And lodged right in the middle was what looked like the butt end of a huge dildo three inches across. It was black and melded seamlessly with her underwear. there was a large red button set into it. Above that the ridge under the smooth surface of her panties had worked into her clitoral hood stretching it out and away and leaving the swollen mound of her clit sticking out through a hole in her panties.<br />
<br />
Jen sank down onto the toilet looked at the sex toy she was wearing instead of underwear. She grasped the base of the dildo and tried to pull it out.  The faintest movement pinched her stressed pussy lips, and sent sensation racing through her clit. From the stall next to her she heard the unmistakable squelching sounds of someone masturbating a very wet pussy.  Startled Jen realized she'd been hearing low moans, cries and other indications that every girl in the bathroom had been pleasuring themselves in the toilets as well as their other needs. Jen found herself wiggling the dildo in time with the girl in the next stall.  She gasped at how quickly her overfull pussy had her yearning for release. Teetering on the brink of orgasm Jen shifted her grip to shove the dildo in as far as it'd go, and felt the red button on its base depress.<br />
<br />
It took Jennifer several seconds to realize the bestial howling shrieks she was hearing were coming from her own mouth. The dildo pulsed and vibrated inside her, sending pleasure slamming up her spine.  From the other stalls girls cried out their own release. Jen's orgasm outlasted them all. When she was done she felt limp as a rag doll. She slowly peeled herself out of the panties. The dildo was ribbed and spiked and she stopped trying to pull it out after the first few inches had her pulse racing again.  She did manage to relax enough to work the mushroom out of her ass and did her business.  The hot urine trickling along the corrugated surface of the dildo was almost more than Jen could stand.  She'd never tried pee-play before, but she could certainly understand the appeal.  Jen brought her self to orgasm twice more in quick succession, neither time as loud or intense as the first, and she reluctantly replaced her panties after washing herself in the bidet.<br />
<br />
She was trying to decide whether to stay in the bathroom all day or plead ill and go home.  There'd just be other perverted panties waiting for her there, however innocent they looked now.  There was sudden knock on her stall door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, how's your head?&quot; Kortney called out<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, thanks!&quot; Jen called and realized it was true.  She'd been so preoccupied with her transforming underwear she hadn't noticed how it had gotten harder and harder to think  before she came.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better hurry if you want to be seated in class before the bell rings. I mean, it's a prep-ralley, so I assume you're wearing one of the remote vibrators like the rest of the cheer-squad, and you know Mr Davis will really use the hell out of his activator if you give him any excuse.<br />
<br />
Jennifer stood, letting her skirt drop back into place.  No way in hell was she letting old man Davis make her cum in the middle of class!</p>
