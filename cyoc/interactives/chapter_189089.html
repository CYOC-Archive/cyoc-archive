<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your freshly glazed girlfriend pushes you off of her and makes for the bathroom arms draped out as strands of cum dangle from her body to the floor. Once the door closes you hear the water start and faint humming from inside. <br />
<br />
You take a few towels from<br />
The kitchen nook in your room and do you best to sponge up the mess that you made in the empty space of the bed. As you turn back to the kitchen for more towels you ponder where the original bed ended up only to turn around and see it back in its place the last bit of mess gone from sight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, ok. Least we won&#39;t have to sleep on the couch tonight.&quot; You mumble to yourself.<br />
<br />
In that moment you hear your girlfriend call out your name from the bathroom. &quot;Come here for<br />
A moment!&quot; She yells.<br />
<br />
Eager to hopefully have some shower sex you pounce to the bathroom and enter.<br />
<br />
The lavish tile bathroom is full of warm steam that soothes your skin as you enter. The shower is huge by convention standards easily three yards long and two wide with a clear clear glass partition between it and the bathroom and a mounted bench in its far back. (For company/enjoyment/or for the elderly your unsure) but you can&#39;t place if it was like that when you used it earlier?    <br />
<br />
Whatever your focused on your girlfriend her sleek body dripping with hot water, chestnut brown hair laden with water clinging to her back and shoulders her supple breasts streaking soapy foam and her round belly sticking out against her waistline. Wait? when did that happen? <br />
<br />
Your girlfriend turns to see your slack jaw look and gives a sweet giggle. &quot;Relax, I&#39;m not pregnant or anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
You compose yourself and sigh a breath of relief before she continues. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like with the bed I was just wondering about things. Like I was just a mattress and then in the shower I remembered waterbeds were a thing and what it would feel like to fill up like that...&quot; She paused to poke her bulging belly and it jiggled in place like jello. &quot;And then I figured I&#39;d let you watch me this time...&quot; Your girlfriend&#39;s face became flush with color at the declaration weather it was from the hot water or embarrassment you weren&#39;t sure (likely the later)<br />
<br />
She turns to face the shower head and opens her mouth allowing water to fill it and she begins to gulp it down quickly her throat bobbing rapidly somehow. <br />
<br />
You see this translate to her belly it quickly becomes more and more pronounced with each gulp of water she takes! Soon the cantaloupe buldge is beach ball sized and she is holding her round spherical belly up with her hands, knees bent from the weight.<br />
<br />
With her hands on its forward bottom side she lifts the sphere up and into her body instantly her ass, breasts, and thighs swell out with the displaced mass, widening her stance but still gulping down water.<br />
<br />
She swallows more and more shifting the mass back into her body over and over until she looks obese in size but without fat rolls. Her belly and thighs are tight with the waters weight. Her breasts sag slightly, though being easly beyond any measurable size. <br />
<br />
She stops drinking only for a minute to face you her plump inflated body facing you and pressed up against the (somehow unfogged) glass. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to keep going&quot; she moans in a slightly husky voice. <br />
<br />
You see now that she&#39;s turned to you so she can reach the water nobs, turning them both and increasing the pressure of the water!<br />
<br />
Still facing you she turns her head to the water opening her mouth again to guzzle down the liquid once more. You watch as her belly grows again pressing against the glass quickly. She shifts her hands to its front again and push downward.<br />
<br />
Instantly the growth shifts to her hips and legs swelling thick and tount becoming pear shaped. Soon her thighs a swallowed into her round belly as her crotch expands downward to her knees. Her pussy inflated like the rest of her body, visibly soaked by her own viscus fluids and not just the shower water.<br />
<br />
The growth decends to her feet spreading her legs imposably wide as her engorged pussy lips now rest on smooth tile of the shower. Your girlfriend&#39;s feet also expand only more comically, the toes expanding into little spheres as water fills them too, each joint looking like eggs attached  to her football shaped feet.<br />
<br />
Still more growth comes as her distended orb of a lower body begin to fill  upward. Creaking can be heard over the running water as your girlfriend begins to rise upward her head reaching close and closer, inch by inch until her face is pressed up against the shower head. <br />
<br />
She gives you a sideways glance to see that your watching then her mouth opens imposablely wide as though it was rubber like the rest of her body and latches around the shower head.<br />
<br />
The sound of running water ends and all about the room your girlfriend&#39;s muffled moans and creaking body echo against the ceramic and glass walls.<br />
<br />
Her chest bellows out rapidly inflating into her stomach and her breasts stretched tight and outward slowly ariolas puffy mounds utop the smooth half spheres of her tight breasts, nipples erect and round as giant over ripe grapes. <br />
<br />
Her shoulders are overtaken by the swelling and her arms ar sucked into the mass up to the elbow. No water seems to be feeding into them further and they rest at her sides, draped over her massive semi sphere breasts, in a vain attempt to hold them.<br />
<br />
With a wet *pop* your girlfriend pulls her lips off the shower head, now standing vertical with the admixture. Her orb of a body is now wedged firmly against the shower walls and the glass standing two feet taller then you. Her head resting atop her round body unchanged, except for the lack of a neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you get the door for me honey ?&quot; she asks in a very husky and gargling voice. Her arm flails uselessly against her body in her own attempt to reach downwards. <br />
<br />
You approach the handel and undo the simple latch only to be thrown back as the door erupts open from the pressure of your inflated girlfriends  body against the glass. The fixture doesn&#39;t break luckally but you are sent onto the the floor watching in horror as your girlfriend freed from the tight confinds of the shower twirls her arms in the are and begins to fall forward overtop you.<br />
<br />
You prepare for the afterlife as her water filled girth crashes onto you. Her body is warm, hot even as the weight swirls around you, smothering you against the cold tile floor. You can feel the water inside her sloshing about overtop you and are immediately aware of you throbbing erection as it pokes dangerously into her girlfriends tight body, afraid that a sharper object might pop her like the giant water-balloon she now resembles.<br />
<br />
Pinned to the ground you begin to feel the sloshing above you increase shifting from side to side. After a moment your girlfriend is thrown off you, rolling to the back of the bathroom. you get up in time to watched her launch herself up to her feet again like a &#39;wibble-wobble&#39; child&#39;s toy and take short awkward steps on her puffy feet, dragging her engorged inflated sex against the bathroom floor, leaving a wet snail trail in her wake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry&quot; she says in her foghorn voice towering over you in her inflated body that fills half the titanic bathroom. &quot;This water weight is murder on the legs...&quot;</p>
