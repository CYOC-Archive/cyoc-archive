<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Geoff excitedly bounded down the stairs and headed for where humans kept their food; in the kitchen. He opened the refrigerator door, and his eyes lit up. Now that he&#39;s on top of the food chain, the very pinacle, and as an omnivore, Geoff found the idea of eating meat enticing. Not just meat, but vegetables and fruits. And, oh boy! What vegetables! Vegetables that was denied him when he was a donkey, and someone&#39;s property. He had no idea such wonderful plants existed. His owners never bothered to feed him anything other than a bunch of grass and hay, or oats on occasion as a treat. <br />
<br />
An idea popped into his head:<br />
<br />
A sandwich!<br />
<br />
Geoff got all the ingredients his new human mind told him would be the best. Bread, cheese, mayo, oil, vinegar, ham, salami, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, peppers, cucumbers, pickles. All the stuff that Jeff loved on a sandwich. <br />
<br />
Once he finished preparing it, he sat down to eat. What a culinary delight this was, kept secret only for humans! Jeff was a human. <br />
<br />
As Geoff sat there eating his delightful new feast, he mulled around in his mind how much of life he missed as a smelly old donkey in a fenced-in field. Neglected and bored 99% of the time. The 1% he wasn&#39;t bored, was when he was gang-raped by the stallions. Well, &quot;bored&quot; wasn&#39;t the right word for it. He realized he didn&#39;t have much of a mind to be &quot;bored.&quot; Regardless, there was nothing to stimulate whatever small fragment of a mind he did have. <br />
<br />
He said it to himself again. Humans aren&#39;t fair, and that Jeff was a human......<br />
<br />
Half his sandwich finished, he smiled. He put everything away, cleaned up before his....&quot;mom&quot;....came home so he wouldn&#39;t leave a mess for her, grabbed the other half of his uneaten sandwich, and ran upstairs, back to the chronivac to check on his &quot;twin.&quot;<br />
<br />
There he was. Struggling with his new form already. His fingerless blocky hooves proving to be an irritation as he is muttering to himself about how his &quot;hands&quot; were feeling &quot;cramped&quot; while pawing the ground with them. <br />
<br />
&quot;So Jeff is already beginning to feel the mental anguish over the loss of his precious hands and the inconvenience of hooves. Just as he wanted to feel. A human mind that grew up with hands and feet, stuck with useless blocky hooves now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff realized that Jeff wanted to experience actually being a donkey. And one of the things he realized, was how unfair life was. A big part of being a donkey, is the simple-minded incapacity to realize just how limiting their bodies were. Well, since life is unfair, Geoff will not give his &quot;twin&quot; the experience of being a simple-minded being. He will keep his human mind completely intact, so he can know his new limitations.<br />
<br />
He decided next would be to make it very difficult for Jeff to ignore his instincts like he was currently doing now. Instincts, such as eating and drinking. But before he made anymore adjustments, he grabbed the mic to tease Jeff a little bit first. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff. Hey. Jeff! Guess what I&#39;m eating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly heard the mirthful voice of his twin come back to him. Finally! He wondered what he was up to. He was already beginning to feel the regrets of becoming a donkey again. Especially without his new trusty human companion nearby. But he was irritated. He wanted to eat before he transformed back into a fucking donkey again!<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m eating your favorite kind of sandwich! Salama, ham, and Swiss cheese in the garden with mayo, oil, and vinegar!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that&#39;s not fair! I wanted to eat before you sent me back into this body again! Let me have some!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not ah, ah, ah, you wanted to experience being a donkey. You are surrounded by your lunch; grass! Besides, you&#39;re lower on the food chain now. Your species doesn&#39;t eat meat.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t want to eat grass! I want to eat a sandwich! That wasn&#39;t fair!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;WHO said anything about &quot;fair&quot;? You&#39;re a donkey now, and time for you to start acting and being treated like one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But- Hheeee hhaaww heee hhaaww hhheee hhhaawww!&quot; <br />
<br />
And with that, Jeff could no longer speak!<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. I can no longer understand you. I took away your ability to speak. Donkeys don&#39;t talk. What would happen to you, if your OWNER came out and heard you talking? You&#39;d become a circus freak. So I am keeping you safe from that fate. Haha.&quot; <br />
<br />
This was beginning to worry Jeff, as he realized he had just put his entire faith into his new twin. He was now just a plain old donkey who cannot speak, and utterly helpless to do anything about it! He was totally at the mercy of Geoff. <br />
<br />
&quot;And....one more thing before I go,&quot; Geoff continued through the mic, speaking to Jeff. <br />
<br />
&quot;You had said you wanted the full experience of being a donkey. Well. Donkeys are ruled primarily by their instincts. As you shall find out. Have a great feast. Haha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee haaww hee haaw!&quot; Shit! Jeff is unable to speak! He was pondering what Geoff was talking about, and meant to ask before he realized the words on his mind was unable to escape out of his donkey-shaped larynx. Jeff could think alp the words he wanted. But none of them would ever be allowed to leave his mouth in any intelligble fashion. <br />
<br />
As he was frantically thinking about this, suddenly hunger pangs hit him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I really should have eaten before- HEY! Oh no...&quot; He realized he couldn&#39;t resist going for a mouthful of grass. Before he knew it, he was grazing on dull and bland grass, and there was nothing he could do about it. He was hungry, and it was food fit for a grazing ass near the bottom of the food chain. He was, afterall, just an herbivore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuummm....one last thing, Jeff...&quot; Geoff said through the mic as he was watching Jeff grazing. <br />
<br />
The camera angle with a great shot of Jeff&#39;s loaf-shaped behind with tail swinging around, trying to smack insects off his hide. Geoff thought that looked mighty uncomfortable, with insects constantly bothering his flesh. He knew all too well how it feels. <br />
<br />
While Jeff heard him come back, he couldn&#39;t bring himself to react, he was so busy with his grazing feast. He wanted to, but he found his resistance to his donkey instincts all but gone. All he could do, was patiently stand on all fours placidly muching on the grass. Waiting for Geoff to say what was on his mind. <br />
<br />
Geoff adjusted the camera angle to get a good look at Jeff&#39;s face. It was just the face of a simple-minded creature chewing on its underwhelming meal. But behind that ugly donkey face, was a sharp-whitted human mind. The mind of a teenage boy who wished for this experience. <br />
<br />
Trying to stifle his mischievous chuckling, Geoff opened the mic again;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have decided to keep you like this on a more....permanent basis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing those words, Jeff&#39;s stomach nd heart immediately dropped. It was almost like being stabbed in the heart. Permanant!? <br />
<br />
He stopped chewing, and looked up. His eyes big dark donkey eyes nearly bulging out of their sockets.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! It can&#39;t be!&quot; thought Jeff, as it registered in his mind, just what that means for him. Bit he also felt suddenly horn at the prospect of being trapped like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now. If you&#39;d like to become human and be my twin again, just say so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes, please!&quot; Jeff thought. But he was afraid of what would come out if he attempted to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a no? You would like to stay as a donkey then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhaaaawww!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! No!&quot; Jeff thought<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s all you have to say? Just a jackass bray?&quot; Geoff tittered.<br />
<br />
He tried to speak again. To beg for his release. To not be left as a donkey forever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww hhheee hhaaww hhheee hhhaaww!!&quot; Jeff closed his eyes, as he concentrated on trying to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaaww hee hhaaww hhhee hhhaaw!&quot; His inability to speak a word on his mind, and the idea of never having hands again and being stuck on all fours forever, made him hornier than ever. This was it! His fetish come true! <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, OK then, jackass. I actually haven&#39;t decided whether to leave you as a stupid useless donkey forever. But I probably will. Ill let you know in a few days or so. Maybe next week. Or next month. Maybe even a year from now. Who knows? Anyway, Goodbye, and have fun eating your crappy grass and drinking from a trough. Haha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhaaww hheee hhaaww hheee hhhaaww!&quot; Jeff was now practically screaming. <br />
<br />
Geoff left the chronivac monitor on, just to observe the human-minded donkey.  He just wanted Jeff to stew over his situation for a while, not knowing whether he will ever come out of his current situation or not. <br />
<br />
Jeff stopped braying, contemplating his life. He had a strange mixture of opposite feelings. He was glad to be stuck like this on the one hand.&quot;I&#39;m a donkey now! I&#39;m just a stupid farmyard animal, same as all the rest! I&#39;m just a fucking donkey!&quot; And on the other hand, he was terrified. <br />
<br />
The duel conflicting emotions made him horny again. His big black throbbed penis came out. He automatically tried reaching for it, but the digitless blocks on the ends of his forelegs were solidly unyielding. As was his wordless vocalizations<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww hheee hhaaww.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, nothing I can do about it now, I guess,&quot; he thought, as he tried to push his mounting discomfort to the back of his mind. His belly started rumbling again, and he decided to concentrate on obeying his instincts again. He went about his business of grazing.</p>
