<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Is it crazy if I want to try being a Dalmatian?&quot; Jeff asked. At least he wasn&#39;t asking to a dog that could fit in Sally&#39;s purse, but he still thought Dalmatians looked a bit silly with polka dots all over their bodies. But that&#39;s part of what was so great about them!<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it matter?&quot; said Sally. &quot;We have a device that can turn our strangest fantasies into reality! What used to be crazy, isn&#39;t anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t sure he was happy about her use of &quot;we&quot; in that sentence. The Chronivac was HIS! He was just letting her use it to humor her, in part because she was just helping him change into an animal for a little while, which he had already thought about trying anyway. She was just the family pet, and she&#39;d better not forget it!<br />
<br />
All at once, Jeff felt very strange between his legs. He peeked down his shorts and gasped at what he saw. Sally looked at him but didn&#39;t seem as worried as he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t need those just to be my pet,&quot; she explained calmly. &quot;It&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of, some of my best friends as a dog were like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just was both impressed that she&#39;d programmed his changes so quickly and humiliated that he&#39;d apparently let his dog neuter him. And she&#39;d better not get too carried away with thinking of him as her pet! This was just until everybody else got home! He supposed he could live with the indignity that long. After all, if he wanted to properly test the Chronivac, he was going to have to step out of his comfort zone a little. When this was over, he might have to erase some of Sally&#39;s human memories of him, though.<br />
<br />
Hurriedly hiding what she did, he got a funny feeling on his skin. It was like an itchy tingle all over him. Looking down to see if he was changing more, he found black and white hairs sprouting all over him. Well, this was what he wanted. Hopefully he wouldn&#39;t look too ridiculous in front of his pet-turned-master-who-was-most-definitely-still-a-pet!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, your coat looks adorable!&quot; Sally commented as his coat neared completion. &quot;Let&#39;s see the rest of it. Those clothes look ridiculous over dog fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff gulped. He was gonna have to be naked? In front of somebody? Without his you-know-whats? Oh well, he might as well get it over with. He&#39;d agreed to be a dog, and it was time to follow through on that. He reminded himself it was just for a little while, so it was okay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow!&quot; said Sally after he was done. &quot;Look at all those spots! Your coat came in just as perfectly as the Chronivac said it would. Mind if ... mind if I touch?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t even fully make sense of what she was asking until after realizing that he&#39;d already absent-mindedly nodded. This was all just too weird, and he couldn&#39;t really think of anything to say. His dog was now a gorgeous woman who was asking to touch his naked body, which was confusing enough. Furthermore, he didn&#39;t have the hormone levels to get aroused at the idea of physical contact with a bombshell, which was embarrassing but probably for the best in this situation. When she gently ran her hand across the fur of his belly and then started rubbing it, though, his eyes rolled back in his head and he couldn&#39;t even bring himself to care how unnatural it all was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful, don&#39;t kick me. Roll over a little bit,&quot; said Sarah. Jeff found himself lying back on the bed with one of his legs out striking the air. He shifted to a less dangerous angle while his legs were still almost human, and Sally pet his sides and back instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s a good boy? Jeffy is!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff inwardly resented getting pet-talk a woman who would still be a dog if it weren&#39;t for him, but feeling of dexterous fingers against his wiry short fur had him too intoxicated to respond. His tongue lolled out, and he groaned. If being his old pet&#39;s new pet could feel like this, maybe it was worth all the weirdness!<br />
<br />
By the time it was over, Jeff had rolled all the way over onto his belly and was taking deep breaths in and out. Relaxation coursed through his body even though her hands were gone, and a drumbeat-like rhythm was soothing his inner being from out past the far end of his back. Realizing he&#39;d never felt that pleasant rhythm before, and thinking he knew what it was, he stared down his back to try to see it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tail? I&#39;m ... I&#39;m wagging my tail!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See? You&#39;re getting to do things you could never have attempted as a human,&quot; said Sally reassuringly. &quot;But I thought you&#39;d be more curious about your ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reaching up to feel them, Jeff was amazed with the furry flaps that were hanging over the sides of his face. His arms and legs jerked and twisted, and he had to let go and stick his hands out in front of him on the bed. There was now a lot less mobility in his shoulders than he was used to! He tried to say something, but the only sound he could make was a bark. Still, watching his paws form was amazing. He was already looking forward to having his hands back when this was over, but he had to admit there was something pleasant about the way his new pads rubbed the blankets and his claws pointed in front of him like little compasses. Strangest of all was when his face grew forward, and he soon found himself staring down the spotted top of a broad muzzle. His nose felt so huge at the end of it, too! Sniffing his bed, he was amazed to find it drenched in his old human scent and his new dog scent already. Sally&#39;s human and dog scents were also in the room, and they both seemed pleasant to his blocky snout. She petted his head again, and he wagged his tail wondering what they were going to do together next.</p>
