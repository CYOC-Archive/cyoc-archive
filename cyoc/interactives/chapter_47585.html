<br />
<br />
     Time had no meaning where I was. All I knew was that night followed day and I had given birth twice now. My body stood in the barn, on all fours; hoofs touching the ground tail swinging behind by gigantic bovine ass. It was now, in those rare moments between sunset and sunrise, I thought about the past and what brought me here to this place.<br />
<br />
     To this body.<br />
<br />
     I’m a cow. Big, fat, and covered in white and black fur. An udder on my belly is squeezed every morning, and milk comes out of me. My face is long, my tongue is thick, my teeth are flat and I have a pair of horns coming out of my head.<br />
<br />
     To look at me, you’d think I was normal. That I was born this was. An animal. A thing that stands out in a field and eats grass. That gets fucked by bulls. That gives my milk everyday. That gives birth to calves. That gives manure from my ass, milk from my belly, and eventually meat from my bones. But I wasn’t always this way. No, no. Not always.<br />
<br />
     Once upon a time, I was a woman named Kathryn Rogers. Three years ago, I was not an animal. I was born a human. A thing that goes to work, makes money, lives in an apartment, and eats pizza. That has safe sex with men. That uses its brains to figure out complex problems. That eventually gives birth to normal human babies. That gives advice from my mouth, work from my hands, and ideas from my brain.<br />
<br />
     And then things changed completely.<br />
<br />
     I was once 5’6”, weighed 130 lbs., long blond hair, and green eyes. Thin waist, C-cup breasts, bubble butt of sorts, with long legs. I was sexy, though I never flaunted it. Everything was going good. At 22, I was on the fast track. Graduated college with a degree in Media Production, and all set for a job at a local TV station. Two weeks after graduation, I was at a bar with this man I had just met earlier in the evening. His name was Doctor Douglas McKane.<br />
<br />
     I was a little drunk, but I knew one thing about this guy. He was hot. And though I never flaunted my sexiness, I was a little on the easy side. So, we went back to his place and made love all over his apartment. After hours of some of the best sex I’ve ever had, I feel asleep on his bed.<br />
<br />
     When I woke up, I was shocked to learn it was three days later and I was far from his apartment. I was laying a large room, with sterile walls. The only feature was a locked door on the left wall. I felt confused and disoriented. He assured me that everything was all right.<br />
<br />
     And then he told me the truth.<br />
<br />
     “I’ve found way to rewrite ones genetic structure. It could be one of the greatest discovers of our time. But it’s not fully tested yet.”<br />
<br />
     “What do you mean?” I asked, realizing suddenly that I was completely naked.<br />
<br />
     “I’ve been bringing women here for four years, Katie,” he replied, calling me by my nick-name. “The first tests were easy. Changing arms and legs and what not. Re-programming the DNA in their appendages to that of animals. Eventually, I’ve been able to do it the entire body.”<br />
<br />
     It started to sink. As if on cue, my naked body began to tingle. It started to feel itchy. I looked down and saw a thin layer of hair on my skin. “Wha-what did you do to me?”<br />
<br />
     “Take it easy,” he chided. “The transformation is beginning. You’ll be fine.”<br />
<br />
     My jaw started to ache, along with all of my joints. My tongue began to feel thick and numb. I could feel my teeth flattening out. As much as I wanted to cry out, my mouth refused to work that way. My throat felt hoarse, and my mouth was changing, lips growing thicker and flabbier.<br />
<br />
     It was at that time that my fingers cramped up. I made a noise, and then fell onto my side. My arms hurt badly, but I still managed to get a good look at my fingers. They were clenched together like fists, and were turning black. My feet were doing the same thing. The entire time, my legs couldn’t move. They were stuck sitting out in front me. The same with my arms, which were now much longer than they were.<br />
<br />
     I tired to stand up, but ended up just rolling onto my back. I looked down at my breasts, which were feeling rather strange. They were tingling. In fact, right in front of my eyes, they were moving. They were shifting down towards my abdomen. When they got there, they sort of lumped together. A new set of nipples appeared. I felt odd as this gigantic, four nippled breast got larger; the nipples grew long and veins appeared all over the breast. That’s when it hit me. I was turning into a cow.<br />
<br />
     My arms and legs - well, they were both now legs - thrashed wildly. I could feel the transformation taking place within my body. It rumbled, and muscles twitched wildly. I hated it, I hated it, I wanted it to end!<br />
<br />
     McKane walked over and heaved me up and I was suddenly on all fours. “Best to do it now, honey. Tipped cows are very hard to push. Especially considering how fat you’re getting.”<br />
<br />
     He was right. My entire body was feeling heavy and weighed down. My neck felt sore, but I still tried to look back. My eyes hurt, but before I closed them, I saw that my skin was covered in black and white fur. Not only that, but I was huge. I watched as my skin swelled up with fat.<br />
<br />
     I felt a pull right above my now gigantic ass. I knew for a fact what had happened. I had a tail, with a small tuft at the bottom. I moved it with my mind; felt it flop around behind me. My very bones hurt as they changed position. I closed my hurting eyes as my face seemed to push out. Snot ran freely from my nose. I felt something pulling hard my skin on my forehead and realized that I had horns. And then my ears felt like they were being pulled outwards.<br />
<br />
     All evidence of my hair was gone. And as I opened my eyes (which had changed positions), it was all over.<br />
<br />
     I was a cow. My legs worked in unison and stepped away from McKane. My mind was reacting somehow and I couldn’t get anything straight. I was an animal. Fat, furry, and ugly. An animal. But no. I was a human. Thin, smooth, and beautiful. What was I? What was happening to me?<br />
<br />
     I needed to say something. Something needed to told. Something to confirm what I was. And so, I opened my mouth, grunted, and talked.<br />
<br />
     “Moooooooooo!”<br />
<br />
     And that’s when I realized. I wasn’t quite all animal. I wasn’t quite all human. I was both. I was worse. I was a human trapped in the body of an animal.<br />
<br />
<br />
     I had to make the transition into my new life quickly or I wouldn’t survive. I could remember everything, but I felt dumber all the time. I couldn’t remember how to say words or how to run away. No matter what though, I just knew I needed to live on and get through this.<br />
<br />
     The animal part of me demanded a lot from my human mind. It was hard to realize that and come to terms with it. But I did. Some things came instinctively to me. For example, eating grass and barley. Taking a shit in the middle of a field. Swatting flies away with my tail.<br />
<br />
     And, as much as I had to admit it, having sex with bulls. It was something I had to deal with, but it felt so good to have that gigantic cock in me. Forced into my bovine pussy. Impregnating me.<br />
<br />
     Now that was something hard to deal with. Giving birth hurt like hell, and not having the emotional bond I should have with my children was hard. You see, a human female takes care of their child and raises them. But a cow female doesn’t. A cow takes care of them, feeds them, but I didn’t feel the concern nor the bond I should with my calves.<br />
<br />
     Being milked was something else. Dr. McKane had other farmhands and some other scientists working here too. Every morning, one of would come out, grab hold of my teats and give ‘em a good yank. I was milked from my udder. Once upon a time, that thing got my sexual attention. And now, it just gets me ‘nutritional’ attention.<br />
<br />
     But like I said, this has been going on for three years. I’ve given birth as a cow twice now. Fucked as a cow twice now. Been milked as a cow every morning now. Even been tipped by some local teenage bastards.<br />
<br />
     I’m an animal. A human trapped within an animals body, forced to accept what has happened. With that comes the realization that my fate is not getting married, having human children, watching them grow, having grandchildren, retiring, and then dying happily. It’s to stand in a field until I’m sold to a meat farm, killed, and being fed to children in their Happy Meals.<br />
<br />
     It’s taken a long time for me to accept this. And maybe I don’t fully do. But I don’t have much of a choice, do I? No.<br />
<br />
<br />
     It’s now been three years later, and like every night, I fall asleep standing up. It’s storming outside, meaning I get to be in the barn with all of my friends. That’s right. I said friends. You see, this entire farm is composed of people transformed like me. Males and females. I haven’t seen any of the appendaged people, but I’m assuming they were either killed or they are kept in the house.<br />
<br />
     As dawn comes, I’m surprised to see Dr. McKane walking through the barn. All eyes fall on him, but he doesn’t pay it much mind. I’ve come to assume (and it took me a long to time to do that, because of my slow working brain) that he does this when he’s stressed or just needs some thinking time.<br />
<br />
     Something must be bothering him, because he’s been doing it a lot more lately.<br />
<br />
     But my mind leaves it alone as I spot one of the farmhands - I don’t remember his name, I never can - heading in. He leads us out to pasture and suddenly, my only concern is whether or not I’ll be fucked today. I keep seeing the bull that fucked me twice before. He’s been eyeing me. Somewhere in my mind, I wonder what he looks like as a human.<br />
<br />
     That thought gets shot down when one of my calves moos. I moo back, still not quite understanding what it said. But like the animal that I now am, I rub my head against its and then walk off. There’s some good grass over at the other end of the field.<br />
<br />
     The rest of the day passes without incident. With no rain nor dark clouds, I fall asleep in the field with the rest of the herd. I close my eyes, knowing that I’ll be milked in the morning and maybe I’ll be lucky enough to be fucked too. Part of me then tells the other to just succumb. Drop the human hopes and ideas and just be a cow.<br />
<br />
     I fall asleep before a decision is made.<br />
<br />
<br />
     There was hand on me and it woke me up. My black eyes opened and my lumbering head looked over to see a man dressed in all black. He pulled out a needle and poked my ass with it. After taking a - what was that stuff called? It’s been so long - oh! Blood sample. After taking a blood sample, he pushed me towards the back of the field.<br />
<br />
     I got a good look at the farmhouse. Men in the same black suits, carrying guns are moving towards it, forcing Dr. McKane and his staff out. Another human touches my neck.<br />
<br />
     “It’ll be okay. You’re going to come with us.”<br />
<br />
     “Moooooo!”      The human looked confused, but just pushed me towards a huge truck at the edge of the property. The rest of the herd is going along with me, including the calves. Once in the truck, I take one last look at the farmhouse. Dr. McKane is running, then there’s a bang, and then he’s dead.<br />
<br />
     It doesn’t take long for me to realize that something is going on. Everyone is making noise, assumedly about what just happened. Moos and oinks and clucks and neighs and barks. We’re all curious.</p>
