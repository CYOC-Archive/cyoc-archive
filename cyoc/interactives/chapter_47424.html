<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark had just finished toweling off and damp drying himself and his new 24/7 briefs with a towel, when there was a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
He didn't think Rico would knock, so he walked to the door and opened it. It was Tony's kid brother, Roger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Rog, how's it hanging?&quot; Mark said with a yawn.  <br />
<br />
He tucked his thumb inside the elastic waistband of Roger's brother and leaned against the door frame. He pointed with his other thumb over his shoulder. The snoring shape of Tina could be seen on top of the bedspread.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd invite you in, but I got company,&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're wearing my brother, so you already know the sitch. You can either give him back right now,&quot; Roger said.<br />
<br />
Mark felt his briefs grow tighter riding up his butt crack. He heard Tony's mind shout YES in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, what are you talking about?&quot; Mark said defensively.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can give him back, or you can take over Rico's deal and pay me to rent the briefs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, heh, what makes you think I'll do either?&quot; he felt the fabric binding him relax as the briefs slid out of his butt crack. He could sense Tony's defeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ever hear about the carrot and the stick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I got it right here,&quot; Mark said suggestively squeezing his hardening cock through the tight red briefs.<br />
<br />
&quot;See this?&quot; Roger said holding up a shiny chrome cock ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, that's not a carrot or a stick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it's both.  It used to be Rico.  The carrot is - you take over the rent payments and you get both Tony and Rico for the same price. You can wear Rico to make your junk look bigger inside Tony. The stick is you can go inanimate like Rico and Tony, and I'll just take Tony back. Maybe your girlfriend would like to find an extra tampon in her purse when she wakes up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tampon?  I was just kidding. I'll pay the rent, now give me Rico.  That bastard was inside me, I cannot wait to put my junk inside him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here ya go,&quot; Roger said with a sigh.  He was always telling his bro that frats were gay, and Mark just reaffirmed that impression in Roger's mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Roger, oh, man, he's a tight, but perfect fit. How's it look?&quot; he said parading around with his briefs tucked under his erect cock and balls.  The silver of Rico glinted from the base of his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, you look fine,&quot; Roger answered rolling his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, she's dead to the world. You wanna go for some breakfast.  I'm really in the mood for breakfast burritos with lots of beans,&quot; Mark confided as he pulled on his jeans.  He could hear Tony's mental groan at the thought of all the stinky farts he'd get blasted with today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, but I've got to drop off Hannigan, so he can do his workout laps at the pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hannigan? Is he with you in your car?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, he's right here,&quot; Roger said opening his windbreaker to reveal that he was wearing a spandex green and yellow wrestling singlet. He snapped one of the shoulder straps with his thumb and grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to change him back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Actually, this was sort of his own idea.  On may way home last night, I cut through an alley to go to my car, and found Hannigan drunk in the alley pissing. He'd finished most of a quart of Everclear, and was planning to ride home on his motorcycle. He got on it, and they both tipped over.  I helped him up.  He was insistant that I let him drive home, and I could see he was in no condition to drive anything, let alone a motorcycle. I couldn't physically overpower the guy, so I decided to wear him home. Just yesterday he suggested I change him into a wrestling singlet if he failed to live up to his deal for changing the swim team captain into his water polo suit,&quot; Roger blurted out with a laugh, and then he thought better of it. He didn't know Mark that well, and didn't want to create a situation where the idiot might try blackmailing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wicked, so he's wearing the swim team captain when he plays water polo?  Wicked! Hey, since he's not taking up the passenger seat, how about you give me a lift. My beamer's over at the club - fuck no- that bastard Rico's henchmen took my car to a chop shop!&quot; Mark exclaimed in anger and frustration as Rico's mind told him the whole story. &quot;Uh, I still need a lift, 'cause Rico's car is a stickshift, and I normally drive automatic - I think I totally stripped his gears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the cock ring heated , &quot;Yeow! Haha!&quot; Mark shouted with surprise and laughed as he realized Rico was pissed up his car being ruined too. The metal ring got hot, but not painfully so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I'll give you a lift.  But let's go. Hannigan's still out of it, so if he remembers being a wrestling singlet at all, he may think it was a dream, if I can get him home before he comes to,&quot; Roger said, &quot;You can finished getting dressed in the car.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger turned.  Mark grabbed his shoes, socks, shirt and hoodie. Then he stepped out of his room, and quickly went back inside. Under his arm was a book and a magazine. He closed the door, and hopped on one foot as he pulled on a sock following Roger to the stairs.<br />
<br />
As he put on his dirty Versace t-shirt and Dolce and Gabbana hoodie, and turned to Roger with a mischievous look in his eye. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know my father says I spend way too much on clothing, so he's cut my clothing allowance to $1000 a month.  If I paid you that, do you think could change some of these guys,&quot; Mark asked eagerly opening the book to display a bunch of half-naked or completely naked college guys, &quot;Into these?&quot; he opened the magazine which turned out to be an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch catalogue or something similar. <br />
<br />
&quot;These two smarmy guys can be athletic socks,&quot; he said pointing, &quot;Bill can be the right sock and Ted the left one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger had a memory flash as he pulled up at the stop sign. He turned to Mark and said, &quot;Oh, yeah, Tony said he hated washing your socks 'cause you use them as cum rags.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark looked nonplussed, and then suddenly he grinned.  &quot;Tony doesn't have to worry about washing my socks any more.  I've got a new cum  rag, and I'll be handwashing him myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt Tony's horror at the realization, and his grin broadened as he sensed Tony's secret longing for his new job to start as soon as possible. Mark had a weird reputation at the frat of being a total jock-off - some said professional, others said amateur - but either way it was true.  Mark kept a board in which he recorded his daily workouts. In addition to the different icarian weight machines, he included masturbation and sex. He prided himself on cumming at least 8 times a day.  He claimed that he liked to exercise every muscle of his body, and bragged that he could get hard and cum practically whenever he liked becaused of his rigorous training. Tony seemed to shrink away from Mark as much as he could what with being wrapped around his ass and balls, as he heard Mark's brain whirring about maybe increasing his reps to 10 or 12 per day.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll think about it,&quot; Roger said non-commitally. Then he asked, &quot;Who are those guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this is the Pan Hel Yearbook. Didn't your bro ever show you? They say it's for frat bros only, but  you're family? Anyway, your bro's in here. Ah, here it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
He opened the book to a winter scene.  Tony was naked in the snow with a small yellow icicle hanging from his cock, and his tongue was stuck to the cock of bronze statue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man that's fucking funny!&quot; laughed Roger.<br />
<br />
Rico and Tony seeing through Mark's eyes had different reactions.<br />
<br />
Tony was mortified that Mark was showing Roger his humiliating picture.  It was tradition to show the pledge's during hell week in the Yearbook. Mark's photo was there too almost leapfrogging over another frat bro during the Viagra &amp; Fosters chugging-leapfrog contest.<br />
<br />
Rico's reaction was that's fucking hot. He liked the way Tony was immobilized bent over with his bare ass invitingly offered to any strange cock that walked by.  He wished he'd been there. The ring tightened around the root of Mark's cock. Rico's mind added, I wouldn't mind seeing that photo of Mark too. A leapfrog contest, as soon as I'm my old self, I'll -  then the ring loosened up a bit. Unlike Tony, Rico wouldn't change back when removed, Roger had to want to change him back.<br />
<br />
This last thought of Rico's made Mark harder. He unbuttoned his jean's fly and let his boner pop out. &quot;Hope you don't mind, but these two are really stimulating me. Fuck, I can't wait to have a whole wardrobe made out of guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All frat bros?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, some blackballs and there are some guys who didn't pledge too, but we can go through the shopping list over breakfast after you drop off Hannigan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger rolled his eyes.</p>
