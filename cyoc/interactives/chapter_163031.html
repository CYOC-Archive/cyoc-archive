<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Reverend Manson stood silent, he was not praying, but he has looking at Jasper, as knew the animal was Jared Morrison, but both horse and human were inseparable. “I heard you Robert, as time will tell all!<br />
<br />
Margery, dear woman, your family is in shambles. First I need to know, where is that silver Medallion?”<br />
<br />
A scared and shaking Margery walked away from the barn door entrance, as she approached the Reverend, but kept at a distance, as if she were embarrassed by her being a naked Anthropic pony mare. Marg coughed twice and tried to give the minister a verbal reply, but what came out of her mouth was a garbled sort of whinny. <br />
<br />
She acted as one being frustrated by her lack of a regained ability like that of her husband; Marg pointed her right hand and hairy index finger toward the farmhouse.<br />
<br />
“Now listen to me, the curse that brought you and your family to the brink of Hell is not dead, but rendered as dormant. Listen to me Robert, as of your present situation; the last of you what was changed seems to be your larynx, as  it was the first of you the blessed water worked to redeem is you ability to speak.<br />
<br />
Hear me, and because your transition from human to equine happened in the biblical term, the twinkling of an eye, a devil’s eye, your redemption to being again as a human man, will happen at a slow, at an eleven month pace.” The Reverend said as he began to explain to each of what to expect.<br />
<br />
“Eleven months, but Revered, how can I being as his mare form could I survive the lust and temptation of not asking of a stallion to mount me, and mate with me?” A worried Robert asked, as realized his gender was fighting to accept what the curse-host devil had as a plan.<br />
<br />
“You are right on the money there Robert, as your having become a female and while needing to live for a while as being a mare, many temptations shall abound. So then, a friend of mine from college years is a Veterinarian, I shall ask of her to come here tomorrow and do a minor surgery. <br />
<br />
She will scare your vulva and then stitch it as shut-closed. The cuts will heal and seal your vulva, making of any mating as an impossibility.<br />
<br />
That process will assure you cannot mate, but the devil invoked sense of female and animal lust is something hard to describe, or worse to endure. Yet be stalwart of heart, as know your humanity hangs in the balance. I wish to see you in due time seated in a church pew and praising your true maker!” The Reverend said with a smile.<br />
<br />
“My greatest of thanks, and yes, do call your Vet lady to come and do what you described, as have her come soon, like real soon; the musky scent I smell is of Jasper having an erection at this very moment!” Robert said, but was for the most still as Roberta, his/her pony mare self feeling her estrus.<br />
<br />
“Margery, Marg,  where are you?” The Reverend asked, as while he was talking with Robert about his situation and condition, Marg feeling embarrassed had slipped away to her hiding.<br />
<br />
“Margery, there are things we need to speak of, you need to know how best to deal with your ailment. Please come to be by us, as there is nothing about a woman I have not seen. As you are not my first woman to be tempted, and/or allowed by the devils to change a human to an animal embodiment.<br />
<br />
Hear me, as from having ingested the blessed water your body shall begin a quicker mode of transitioning different than what Robert must endure. A primary issue in your favor is that the devil did not affect a change of gender, you are still a female. What of you the devil caused to change to equine shall revert back, so I need to know what he, it informed you to beware of, as how you were tempted to make a woman with true faith as want to become an animal?<br />
<br />
Margery, yes I see you, as please come closer, I will not harm you, and there is nothing between us for the feeling of being embarrassed. Robert come hither and console, calm your wife. Marg, your transition shall come with pangs of mare lust the same as Robert shall feel, but the surgery my friend can do for Robert will not do well for you. What you need to do is be strong of your faith, hold tight to your savior, and call me when the need or urge becomes nearer to being unbearable.<br />
<br />
Excuse my preponderance, but what or who did you mate with during your twenty-four hours of passion?” The Reverend asked, as Marg pointed again toward the farmhouse, but Robert spoke up and said bluntly, “Dolthan, a donkey Imp was her downfall!”<br />
<br />
“DOLTHAN,” Reverend Manson exclaimed aloud, “I thought by now he would have let the curse to heed in him the devil’s desires and become a whole donkey. He was the worst student and most unruly person in Sunday school”<br />
<br />
“Dolthan was not born an Imp?” Robert asked as he looked toward Marg, who from the news about Dolthan she had fallen to lying face down onto the barn floor.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I know a great deal about Dolthan, and to answer your question, Imps are created through evil, Imps are never born of a woman or animal.<br />
<br />
Dolthan went to a yard sale, or an estate sale, where he found a book. The book was the historical hand written ledge of a coven, a group of practicing witches. He drew a pentagram of the concrete basement floor, as set a candle at each pentacle point of the pentagram and lit each with a flame. This I know from what a scared as younger, and a teenager Dolthan told me, when he held a wish to repent.<br />
<br />
However, he was well beyond the point of no return to any saving grace, as what he requested to gain was an enhanced maleness. Foolishly, he failed to restrict what a Devil might consider is as an enhancing of a teenager’s gender. Dolthan was gifted the genitals of a Andalusia Mammoth donkey Jack. At the first he felt horrified and came to me to act as a mediary, as if I by being a minister held some power to request the devil to change Dolthan&#39;s genitals to something not as big. I am sure that devil smiled, and he inspired Dolthan to feel the rush of equine levels of testosterone what he could never deal with or ignore.<br />
<br />
As from his own mouth did Dolthan tell of his rush to go and breed, he in a flurry of sexual desire did seek and mate that first night with not less than eight pony mares, two jennet donkeys, and got kicked by a grown mare for being a bother. <br />
<br />
Kicked unconscious, when he awoke in a stable the next morning and felt hunger, he ate from the grain bin his fill. He called me to beg for help, as told of his second full day of enjoying equine sex, but did so at the Saint Micheal’s Donkey-Basketball stud farm; where he did indulge another full day of breeding. He said that the Devil decided that Dolthan would make a fine form of a donkey Imp. As know this, he is dangerous and conniving toward any human, and can from his beastly infectious semen, is capable to begin a person to change, as becoming of an equine something.  He cannot be trusted no matter what he says, and/or cannot he speak the truth about anything, he became or is the perfect devilish ploy for hellish Demonic endeavors, now is he in the house?”</p>
