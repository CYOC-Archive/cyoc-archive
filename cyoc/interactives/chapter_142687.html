<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“A woman should be with a man...nothing else!”<br />
<br />
Danielle arrogantly stepped into the women’s restroom, leaving Claire in the dust as the jogger could only ‘freeze’ due to the curse as a result of the upcoming transformation. <br />
<br />
Breast nipples tightening and hardening as a result of that stern, arrogant wave from that conservative christian-Claire always had a hard on for these arrogant types which switch back and forth from their innocence and anger.<br />
<br />
Like all cursees, she too had a story. The blue-dyed pony tailed Caucasian dyke was always mistreated by men when she was younger, which was why she toughened up into the runner she is now.<br />
<br />
Well..., ‘used to be’.<br />
<br />
The now former runner felt her feet thinned out beneath her, those running shoes concealing those size 14s tanned feet beneath her, as they shrunk lower and lower, shoes completely taking on the form of slightly less extreme, brunette flat tops as she had been running-but not extremely as her size 7 feet were more delicate that not.<br />
<br />
Rising up her slenderizing knees were purple stockings, classical and light as her skin tone lightened up to a fair caucasian tone as her running shorts split apart and exposed her bottoms, giving an exposure to the fact she is still a woman, despite how butch Claire represents herself.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on the park bench, her skirt feathers finally materialise gently as her buttocks plumped slightly instead of a bubble butt tonality. She had been sitting more often than not...even carried by...she had to be sitting in order to-<br />
<br />
-LA<br />
<br />
Fingers pressing down, almost as though they were playing notes as music scores decor over the gorgeous patterns that was her skirt, the boxers she had been wearing as a shield, only to be dripped with virginity as the tough butch felt so uncomfortable...so vulnerable in her growing femininity.<br />
<br />
She needed help...she needed someone strong to take care of her....her chest definitely shortened-while in contrast, her breasts perked up SNAPPING past the binder she once wore. Her gorgeous fingers, while still playing an invisible musical instrument in front of her-picked up her smartphone-only for it to upgrade itself to a cisdroid model that she had protested with....a group against.<br />
<br />
She reeled in disgust, unknown as her slender purple manicured fingers typed down almost naturally, pressing the call button to an unknown number, unable to control herself as she put it to her ear and let it ring.<br />
<br />
As the tone rang, it modified the dull call-tone into...a classical tune, a song familiar to her as her arms slender, fit but growing conservative, feeling as reserved as ever since that youth ministry leader told her. Reserved in public-except when you have to ‘defend’ the word.<br />
<br />
As her black tank top stretched far down her arms, they purified themselves to white as another layer embraced forward into a lady pink vest. As a light colour tie knotted itself across her collar-an insignia of her church’s logo pressed over on her now D-cup sized breasts. A huge balloon for a virgin? Just like how her husband to be-<br />
<br />
Calling Handsome~<br />
FLICK-<br />
“Hey Gorgeous~”<br />
“Hey Handsome~”<br />
<br />
Instantly, her breasts perked up at the sound of asian tenor melody of her hunky Boyfriend. In a instant, her new life flashed beyond her eyes as a more re assured-yet conservative youth leader takes hold, her voice could only echo the song of femininity as it ought to be.<br />
<br />
The growing Christian had a love for God, a piano prodigy who soared in gospel tracks and raised in a traditional household. Instead of men attacking her for not being a woman enough, men flocked to her for her talent and songs as well as her sweet but confident personality. While as dykes and gays would call her a ‘Marie who?’, an insult to her uniqueness and everything about her.<br />
<br />
“Just finished the paperwork with Uncle Chen, on our way to our-*cough*”<br />
<br />
Her back figure surely had a greater posture, and those lesbian abs had to tone down ALOT! Both she and her boo always had to deal with homosexuals as though they used to be one-what a ridiculous notion! Her boo sure is getting sick of it...literally!<br />
<br />
Muttering a prayer through the invisible piano being played, expertly pressing those keys as though she were grabbing the heartstrings and purifying the audience-especially any gay ways. Her shoulders straightened as her face only echoed the White caucasian energetic presence she had-with some occasional anime gaming for reasons but mostly dedicated to her graft.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?”<br />
“*Cough* I’m fine...must have caught...”<br />
<br />
Her hair graced blond as it framed her cherubic cheeks greatly, blushing as make up decorated her innocent glow, lips smiling in gorgeous red as she could smell the boy next door joke from a mile away.<br />
<br />
“THE GHEYYYY!”<br />
“Haha eww!”<br />
“Just kidding gorgeous, y’know I’m immune to that....besides, my eyes are only for you~”<br />
“Haha...aw”<br />
<br />
Her eyes blinked in their new sky blue purity, the future Mrs Chen could only smile in bliss as she was grateful to God for giving her such a loving, strong-soon to be husband that could understand her inside out. A couple of earring adored the side of her ears, musical note diamonds of crests as she could only dream of the life with Daniel.<br />
<br />
“Wanna go get some burgers Honey bunch?”<br />
“Sure Peekaboo, anything you want.<br />
<br />
Claire never dated a guy before, Clarissa dated her husband to be for a long while. Claire was a self sufficient strong woman, while Clarissa relied on her Peekaboo more than ever as she on the bench for his arrival.<br />
———————<br />
Meanwhile, as the two lovebirds are about to meet, as Danielle stepped into the restroom, already restless as her ‘time’ is up. Her body began reverting as she returned to her original form as Dani the dyke.<br />
<br />
Likewise, the gay germs from the former Dante have infiltrated Lennard’s shirt-already in mid process changing back as he clutched his checkered shirt and the new crucifix Dani-bunch from him during their park ride, resisting the gay urges to no avail.<br />
<br />
The conservatives had their gorgeous, handsome, victim attracting features reverting to their homosexual selves, barely retaining anything aside for a craving to transform back despite their disdain for what they did.<br />
<br />
Danielle’s gorgeous body melted away as a desire for those cheerleaders came back once more. Likewise, the strong back of Lennard’s, which piggy backed his lover and many kids became far weaker as it begged to be carried by someone strong.<br />
<br />
Their big sibling person fading away, replaced by a need for one as the more the two tried to hold onto their love for another, the more their gay selves wrinkled in disgust as they momentarily take hold once more.<br />
<br />
Lennard’s attraction to females, especially to her fiancée Danielle, have been returned to Dani as she could recall her crushes and her good friend Allen. Likewise the same gay essence have been returned to Allen, as his eyes went wide open, searching around for his former ‘girlfriend’ in a state of disarray.<br />
<br />
Little do they know the curse has something else in mind for their ‘reunion’.</p>
