<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mesozoic Enclave got more settled and the IAC started winding down, the residents started focusing more on running their businesses. The Great Indoor Marketplace will be doing a lot of business with things that can&#39;t simply be drone-delivered. It wasn&#39;t quite the teen hangout spot yet, mostly because Dinotopians are largely adults with a few hatchlings. The Sandstone Casino and the Roost will be doing a bit less business as summer was ending so was vacation time.<br />
<br />
Club Claw was still rather busy, but more than just what appeared on the surface. Yes, there was a big demand for a Dinotopian stripclub and plenty of Dinotopians were willing to make up for lost time. But there was also a lot of activity going on in the back. Not just training new dancers how to perform, but doing adult videos for Animalia&#39;s premium page. That was in pretty high demand too, but Dinosaur City being set in conservative Texas made it a lot harder to do any filming without getting into legal trouble.<br />
<br />
Of course, directing a porno isn&#39;t as easy as it sounds. Rachael had been in this business long enough to know what to expect, though she was more usually in front of the camera instead of behind it. She knew there were things like lighting and camera angles to make videos look less amateur and more professional. There was also music that&#39;s important to set the rhythm and cover up some of the less desirable noises.<br />
<br />
But Rachel&#39;s main frustration right now was getting the actors to listen to her. Right now, she was working with some of the new herm <i>Dakotaraptors</i>. As a <i>Pyroraptor</i>, she wasn&#39;t really puny compared to them since Animalians were always at least human-scaled in size. But a little bit of raptor instinct made them see her as a smaller, less-threatening creature, something their ancient versions would most likely hunt if they shared territories. While not ruled by instinct, this particularly rambunctious lot was finding it hard to take Rachael seriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, that&#39;s enough ad-libs,&quot; snapped Rachael, &quot;If we have to stop and add each little new idea to this thing, we&#39;re never going to get it done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, just one more thing,&quot; said one of the raptors. Rachael rolled her eyes. Of course it would be Crosslash. Shi&#39;s the one most likely to stir up trouble just for the heck of it, even if it&#39;s just to prolong the current disorder. Rachael was willing to bet shi was a class clown back in grade school.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, we&#39;re not doing the pillow fight. I don&#39;t care if feathers are supposed to come out, your claws rip them open more and all the feathers fall out and make a mess,&quot; said Rachael.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I was thinking we could add something as an extra,&quot; said Crosslash.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is it this time?&quot; asked Rachael, rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;My conversion video,&quot; said Crosslash, holding up hir phone. Shi had to do it a bit more carefully now that shi had sharp claws.<br />
<br />
That did get the other raptors&#39; attention. &quot;I didn&#39;t know you recorded it,&quot; said one of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, so I can fap off to it later,&quot; said Crosslash.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are such a narcissist,&quot; said another raptor in a teasing, mock-chiding tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, if you&#39;ve got a body this great, of course you&#39;ve gotta love it,&quot; said Crosslash. Rachael fought back the urge to facepalm. Crosslash&#39;s vanity was almost as big as hir penchant for causing mischief.<br />
<br />
&quot;So fire it up already,&quot; said another raptor. Once Crosslash had set up hir phone to play on a bigger screen, the others crowded around to watch. Rachael was admittedly curious as well so she got in where she could watch too.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, pre-conversion Crosslash was a petite woman. If it weren&#39;t for the fact that she was wearing a bra, she could easily pass for an androgynous man. Though it was equally likely that she was actually a trans-woman. She had rather pale skin, blue eyes, and hair that was on the paler side of blonde. &quot;Hey there, it&#39;s Chelsea coming to you for the last time. You might remember hearing me more than seeing me, can&#39;t say I blame you. Chelsea just fades into the background leaving only her voice like poor Echo. But nobody&#39;s going to overlook me now.&quot; With that, Chelsea took a deep drink of milk before sitting back on the bed. &quot;See you on the other side,&quot; she said before her transformation started.<br />
<br />
The changes soon became obvious. Her skin prickled before feathers and scales started sprouting. Her waif-like frame started growing in size as muscles became more defined. The hands that clenched the bed soon grew claws as the pinky fingers shriveled away. She lifted up her feet to show her toes were becoming claws, the big toes shrinking away into dewclaws while the second toes become the large sickle claws raptors are so famous for. Chelsea moaned as her face started pushing out into a muzzle, her teeth getting sharper. Her pale hair was falling out as feathers took their place.<br />
<br />
Chelsea massaged her breasts, which were quickly becoming too large for her small bra. Between her new claws and the fabric&#39;s weak material, she had little trouble ripping it off, showing the feathers that were growing over her tits. &quot;Now that&#39;s more like it,&quot; she said as she groped herself. Her panties were also getting tighter as her hips and ass expanded. So it made it easier to see when something started pressing from inside, a bulge that grew bigger until something red started slipping out over the top. &quot;Well, look who&#39;s hear,&quot; said Chelsea before reaching down and ripping hir panties off. Her new raptor dick sprang free, becoming bigger in the open air.<br />
<br />
Chelsea started stroking hir dick, flipping over and showing hir backside to the camera. Hir new tail was growing out nicely. Shi raised it up to give a good view of her ass, especially the slit shi was also packing. In case it wasn&#39;t obvious where it was at first, shi reached behind hirself and stuck two claws into it. Shi jolted a bit slowly reapplying them. &quot;Might wanna trim these claws a bit. Don&#39;t want something that sharp poking at your valuables,&quot; shi said.<br />
<br />
Shi soon flipped over again, showing hir herm raptor form close to completion. Shi grasped one breast as shi continued pumping hir dick. From the way shi was moaning and the way pre was leaking, shi was very close. As hir feathers finished covering hir up and hir muzzle grew out to its full shape, shi hit hir climax, sending a spray of cum that just missed the camera. The herm raptor sighed before looking straight at the camera. &quot;Well, that&#39;s it for Chelsea. Crosslash is going to be more seen than heard,&quot; shi said.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite a show, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; asked Crosslash. The others didn&#39;t have to tell hir. Shi could smell their arrousal and shi could the bulges between their legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok, it was hot stuff, but I don&#39;t think we can add it to the film,&quot; said Rachael, &quot;Maybe you can post it on the premium page, I haven&#39;t read all of the rules for it. But let&#39;s focus on making this movie.&quot; She will admit that Crosslash has plenty of sexual appeal. And shi might also have a bit of an inferiority complex, but Rachael wasn&#39;t a psychologist. She was trying to make some adult movies. It didn&#39;t have to be high art like that Moreau play they&#39;re going to be doing on Labor Day, but it has to pass muster. Which would be easier if these herms weren&#39;t so easily distracted.</p>
