<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wanted to test it now that he saw it might work. But who to test it on he wondered. Then Jeff heard music coming from outside his window, so he went to investigate. Outside next door Jeff saw his neighbor Gabriel listening to music on a CD player while sitting on a lounging chair reading a book. Jeff saw his test subject. Jeff looking at the options on the chronivac decided to go all out, but first he check if there were any options to prevent his test subject from accidently destroying things. He found some options mainly for awareness and altering the things around the changed subject to better accommodate their changes.<br />
<br />
Jeff selected that Gabriel would be partially aware of the changes happening to him and that the world would accommodate all changes made. Jeff then went to look if there were more options besides just the sliders and he found a few so he decided to use them as well.<br />
<br />
Jeff first change he made was to give Gabriel DD-cup breasts and purple hair. He quickly hit accept and then went to see the changes he made from his window. He saw Gabriel&#39;s chest expand till two large mounds rested on his chest and his hair changed to purple. Jeff satisfied that the initial test work, he went back to his PC and made many drastic changes to Gabriel.<br />
<br />
Jeff gave Gabriel a massive dragon-taur body filled with many large breast under it, three large pussies at the rear, and in the front a large mouth-pussy that has many grabbing tentacles in it, to grab any women who visits Gabriel now a her and drag them into the mouth-pussy for them to be absorb into her. Jeff then gave her two types of tails some would be like a Lamia but be covered in breasts and pussies, while the other type would also be covered in breasts and pussies but end in large flower like pussy. Jeff gave her 9 tails. <br />
<br />
Jeff was then interrupted by a message asking if the tails that were Lamias, if they should have different personalities are should they just be an extension of Gabriel. Jeff decided to just make them an extension instead of being independent. With that out of the way Jeff continued now focusing on Gabriel&#39;s upper half. Jeff gave Gabriel three large upper torso&#39;s instead of just one, he then gave her lots of arms and many rows of large breasts. Jeff changed the nipple types on the four upper breast and the four lower breasts, on the upper breasts he changed them to have Lipples (mouth/lip nipples), while on the lower ones he changed them into pussies. Jeff made Gabriel have a super high libido, be super sensitive (sexually), have no refractory period, lactate, and squirt like crazy when she comes. <br />
<br />
Jeff altered Gabriel&#39;s body and face structure to be extremely feminine. Jeff made Gabriel hair scarlet red and lengthen it in till it reach her draconic lower half, Jeff then made it so the color of her scales matched that of her new hair color. Jeff looked at the preview and saw a dragon-taur who was mainly of many, large, breasts when viewed from the front, and from the rear, many tentacle like tails above three large, dripping wet, pussies and above all that a cascade of scarlet red hair flowing along a very feminine backside. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt like he could do a little more Gabriel was massive with many breasts but he felt like he could do more with her. Jeff then realized since she was next door he could give her kids who would then be his girlfriends. With that in mind Jeff added more heads to her, he gave her two heads for each torso giving her nine heads in total on her upper bodies with three heads from her lamia tails (three tails are lamias) . Jeff then changed the extra heads to be completely draconic and made it so the heads were her wives who merged with her and are now in control of the extra heads. Jeff then had an idea to add more extra features to Gabriel. Jeff made it so the draconic heads could extend to reach any were on her body, he made the wives be complete sluts, who constantly tease their monstrous body, he changed all the tongues to be incredibly long and prehensile. Jeff gave her many tentacles coming from her backside and divided their control between the different people/heads.<br />
<br />
The last few things Jeff did was to make the three hottest girls from his class be Gabriel&#39;s children and all three would be his girlfriends and share him, but he made them to remain normal, he also made it so they were madly in love with him and their new mother, and would gladly help their mother to get off. He then altered Gabriel&#39;s mind so that he would within a month change her name to Lilith. With that done and him quickly checking to make sure the chronivac would automatically change the would to fit the changed Gabriel in, Jeff hit enter. The moment he did that he heard the sound of moaning coming from next door, Jeff smiled to himself and went to his window to check his handy work. <br />
<br />
What Jeff saw what look like a tower of 20 large breast all leaking milk, and under that was a large pussy-maw that was nestled between two powerful draconic legs and just past that underneath were 26 large breasts leading down to Gabriel&#39;s hindquarters. Jeff was rock hard at seeing the monster he created. Jeff started to masturbate while thinking whether he should make her bigger with more breast and pussies, use the chronivac on his family, or call up his new triple girlfriends.           <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Some one please continue this. I want to see what other things people come up with in this scenario.</p>
