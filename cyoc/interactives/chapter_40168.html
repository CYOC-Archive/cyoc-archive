<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oops! Sorry.  You ran out of time.  Now you get both.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no wait!  I wasn't ready!&quot; Jennifer whined.  She was busy reeling over what her friend had told her to answer him in time.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the dare:  You have to kiss Michelle Reyes!&quot;  Jennifer's mouth dropped open in silent shock.  Michelle and her were long time enemy.  She was just as pretty as Jennifer, more even.  She comes from a less fortunate background, but everyone likes her.  She is very popular and Jennifer hates her for it.  There was no way she would ever kiss Michelle Reyes!  She'd kill herself first.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No way, freak boy.  I'm not listening to you.  Buy a mag and get your jollies in private.&quot;  Kyle sighs and then laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the transformation:  You will become a pussy...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!?!&quot;  Jennifer screamed in rage and cut him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will become the sex organ of the very girl you kiss.  After you kiss her of course.  You will remain that way for twenty four whole hours.  You will have all your senses so, you will be able to see, feel, hear, smell and taste the things around you.  You can even communicate with her via telepathy of you choose.&quot;  Jennifer was silent, at last, in total shock.  &quot;It only twenty four hours.  I could've demanded eternity.  But not everyone is as wicked as you!  Good luck!&quot;  He laughed and hung up.  She was still in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a freak!&quot;  She screamed.  She was going to be late.  She quickly found the rest of her outfit and high tailed it to school. At first, she was a bit worried about the disturbing phone call.  But she realized that she didn't believe in curses.  <br />
<br />
She decided that she wasn't going to worry about it.  As she was headed home after cheer practice, she noted that nothing unusually had happened.  The phone weirdo was just trying to live some perverted fantasy.  She almost felt sorry for freak boy.  She promised to make his life very miserable.<br />
<br />
The next day, Jennifer dressed more comfortably in the new jeans and blue ribbed shirt.  She was running late, again.  She could find one half of her favorite pair of sneakers!  She rushed to leave and was relieve that the phone hadn't rung.  <br />
<br />
she spent the whole day as she usually did and when the final bell had struck, she was out the door.  Her locker was on the other side of the school.  And what with her having to stop and talk to friends, she was often the last one to leave.  <br />
<br />
She finished at her locker and was rushing out to catch the bus when she ran into Michelle Reyes.  Michelle was a little taller than Jenn and her half Hispanic half native American background gave her an exotic look.  Her long straight black hair splayed across her back and narrow shoulders as she picked herself up.  She was alone and looked like she was in a hurry as well.  She was on her way to the restroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch where you're going, bitch!&quot;  Jennifer barked.  Michelle rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ran into me!&quot;  Michelle countered and turned to walk away.  She wasn't the confrontational type.  Jennifer, suddenly and without warning dropped her back pack, grabbed Michelle by the shoulders and kissed her!  Michelle fought to get away.  Jennifer fought to stop herself, but her body wouldn't respond.   <br />
<br />
Jennifer finally broke off the long and passionate kiss.  Remembering the curse.  Michelle stood wide-eyed, stunned and breathless.  Jennifer squinted and bared her teeth still clutching Michelle's shoulders.  &quot;I hate you!&quot;  She hissed through clenched teeth and then she vanished with a soft pop!  <br />
<br />
Michelle jumped and gasped as Jennifer's body exploded into billions of tiny invisible particles.  Michelle covered her mouth, trembling as Jennifer's empty clothes and accessories fluttered to the floor, a heap at Michelle's feet.  Before Michelle could move, the tiny particles flew effortlessly under Michelle's clothes, into her jeans and underwear.  <br />
<br />
There, the particles coalesced and replaced Michelle's sex.  The process sent disabling shock waves of pleasure coursing through Michelle's body.  Starting from her center and rocketing out to her toes and head and everything in between.  <br />
<br />
She had to lean against the wall for support as the waves intensified.  She crossed her legs, shoved her hands between them and squeezed.  Her bladder still needed to be emptied.  She was aware of that, but it wasn't so important now.  <br />
<br />
She felt she was about to pass out.  Her beautiful brown eyes rolled to the back of her head.  Her toes curled as much as they could in her hot sneakers.  It felt so good, she didn't want it to stop and then when she thought she couldn't take it anymore, the sensation eased and then finally vanished.  <br />
<br />
Michelle was on her knees, covered in sweat and breathing as if she'd just run a marathon.  She opened her eyes and licked her suddenly dry lips.  She was leaning over Jennifer's clothes.  So close that she could smell Jennifer's scent in her shirt.  Her deodorant was starting to fail.  She pushed herself away and sat up and looked around.  <br />
<br />
She didn't know how long she'd been here.  She didn't know if anyone had seen what had happened.  To Michelle it was Karmatic justice.  Divine retribution.  But, Michelle worried that they would blame her for what had happened to Jennifer.  What ever it was.  Everyone knew they were enemies.  <br />
<br />
Would they blame her?  She needed to get rid of the evidence.  Michelle quickly gathered up Jennifer's clothes, shoes and bundled them to her chest.  She pick up Jennifer's backpack and rushed to the bathroom.  The bathroom was empty thankfully.  She quickly stuffed the shoes and clothes in the backpack.  She calmed herself and reminded herself that she'd done nothing wrong.  <br />
<br />
Now, That she was calm and the rush had faded, the need had returned and she really had to go.  Jennifer woke up and found herself someplace warm, damp and smelly.  It was also dark and her there was some strange taste in her mouth.  She was about to complain when the darkness was lifted a little.  <br />
<br />
Her view was still blocked by a large white wall.  Well, it wasn't exactly white.  She found herself pressed up against the wall.  It was very soft, cloth like.  But the air was fresher and then, the giant wall pulled away from her and she mentally gasped.  <br />
<br />
She watched in horror as the crotch of a giant pair of panties was pulled from her face to come hastily to rest between a pair of giant dusky brown knees!  Then, she saw the toilet coming quickly toward her as Michelle launched herself on to it.  Jennifer screamed, but was quickly cut off by a steady stream of liquid.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was mortified!  She had to spend twenty four hours like this?  There was no way she would make it.  The humiliation alone was already killing her.  Having to spend a day between this skank's dirty legs!</p>
