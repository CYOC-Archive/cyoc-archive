<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Howard James was a very lucky man. He had everything going for him. He had a good job, an okay body, he was very smart and had a very attractive wife whom he loved very much. He was quite short at five foot four but his wife was even shorter at four foot eleven so he didn&#39;t mind. <br />
<br />
He was a thin man weighing just over a hundred pounds. None of it was muscle though. He had a slim face, with average looks: Small nose, green eyes, brown hair and pale skin. <br />
<br />
His wife, Sarah, was the same. Very thin with very little muscle. However she did have very large breasts for her size which Howard loved. She also had a slim face with average looks, small nose, brown eyes, red hair, pale skin and red framed glasses that she couldn&#39;t see without. This resulted in her often searching around on the floor for them with her eyes closed if she ever tripped or got knocked over, which wasn&#39;t a hard thing to do considering her size.<br />
<br />
They had met each other through at university and had bonded over their love for science, comics and video games. This led to them dating and then it just snowballed from their. Eventually leading to them getting engaged and ending up where they were.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Although Sarah loved Howard as much as he loved her, she had always felt in the two years that they had been living together. That he treated her alot like his mother. <br />
<br />
Howard had lived with his mother since he had got married. Which didn&#39;t bother much considering they had only been twenty three when he proposed. But it meant he had never lived on his own. So he didn&#39;t know how to cook, or clean or do any form of home economics. And since Sarah did, and she did it well. Howard just left her to it. But this resulted in him expecting her to do certain things. For example it had got so out of hand, she had to book his dentist appointments. And she was sick of it. <br />
<br />
Yes she was happy that, he had a good Job. And he brought in a good amount of money. Not as much as her but enough so that if she didn&#39;t work they could still live a happy life. But that meant she essentially wore the pants in the relationship all the time. And he, as she saw it, might as well have been wearing a diaper. <br />
<br />
She had heard about this store that apparently sold magical items and these could be used to change people in various ways. Being a scientist and such but she was at least willing to try it. So on a normal Saturday when Howard was out. She got changed into a yellow knee length skirt, a blue undershirt, a red button down cardigan and a pair of black leggings. Then she put on her brown, knee high boots and got in the car.<br />
<br />
She drove to the store, she knew where it was because of some flyers she had seen and because she worked right next to it. But she had never been in their before.<br />
<br />
When she strolled in She was amazed at how large the store was. It was like wal-mart but full of things she had never seen before.<br />
<br />
A man came up to her and greeted her. He was vey tall and vey old. With a long beard that was tidy and brown. He was wearing a black cloak that reached the floor and a fez on his otherwise bald head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings little girl, welcome to the magic shop, how can I help you today?&quot; He asked in a large booming voice. Sarah was a bit taken aback by his personality and slightly annoyed that he had gotten her confused with a child but it had happened before. <br />
<br />
&quot;um...hello, do you have anything for my husband?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Husband? Oh I&#39;m sorry I thought you were a little girl dear. But your husband well, is there a problem of some sort?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorta. He treats me like I&#39;m his mother. I don&#39;t know if you have a cream for that or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I see well do you want him to stop or something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a grown man, he&#39;s too old to still be as helpless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh, so you want him to do as you say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we don&#39;t have an item that we can hive you for that but if you&#39;ll follow me to the back.&quot;<br />
<br />
She followed the man to a small room near the back of the building. He walked swiftly and she almost had to run to keep up.<br />
<br />
He reached into a box and pulled out two small boxes full of pills. One full of blue pills the other full of white pills. He told her that for this to work she would have to give him one of the blue pills everyday for a month and she had to take one of the white pills everyday as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;The changes won&#39;t be instant, in fact I doubt you&#39;ll notice anything for the first few days but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to tell eventually,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;okay...well thankyou and how much is that?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh its free dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, well thankyou.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re very welcome. Oh one more thing.&quot; He reached into the box again and pulled out a small stone. It was diamond shaped and had a red glow over its pink surface. &quot;Make sure you keep this in your house as well otherwise it will become hard for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took the stone and was escorted out of the building. She was still skeptical but was willing to give it a try. She got home, luckily Howard wasn&#39;t back yet so she took out the stone and hid it in a place Howard never went, the basement. Then she started preparing dinner. She made sure to grate up one of the pills into his food. And then she poured herself a glass of water and took her pill. It was quite chalky but didn&#39;t taste of anything or smell of anything. Which was what she wanted.<br />
<br />
About two hours later Howard walked through the door. He hugged Sarah and sat down for dinner. Sarah poured him a glass of wine as she thought about how much she was going to enjoy this month if this worked.</p>
