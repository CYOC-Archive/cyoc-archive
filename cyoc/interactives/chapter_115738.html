<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer sat down with her bowl of cereal and contemplated her dilemma. If only she&#39;d waited a few minutes, then she wouldn&#39;t be sitting here munching cereal while imagining every spoonful as a different cock, delivering a burst of milk and nutrients to her mouth.<br />
<br />
As she took a few more lusty bites, tongue fondling the spoon as she removed it, she heard Ernest walking Hannah out of the front door. He came back inside, and immediately noticed Jennifer. &quot;I thought you and Barry were going to finish your day, what happened?&quot; Jennifer looked up at him, her eyes tracking first to the bulge of his briefs, and then up to his face before she finished her mouthful and spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I wanted to, but I just really wasn&#39;t feeling like being penetrated. But don&#39;t worry! I made sure he was really entertained!&quot; she proclaimed as she stuck her spoon between her breasts and mock-licked a spoon dick. &quot;Oh, and he said he&#39;d let you borrow VR Soldiers 2, whatever that is.&quot; She gave an exaggerated shrug, which sent her nipples on a ride.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really surprised Sis, usually you&#39;re finished with your daily cycle before you get home. It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve seen you this far along at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jennifer continued to munch at her cereal, she thought today was a little odd, now that her brother mentioned it. She had taken a bit longer to get ready today, &#39;but other than that...&#39; she thought back on the events of the day, which didn&#39;t seem too out of the norm for her. She decided she was just getting deja vu from all the times her brains had been fucked out today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I almost made it through. Anya and Hannah are so goddamn sexy! Thinking about them just makes me wanna start drooling again!&quot; though her sopping cunt was doing just that.<br />
<br />
Her brother&#39;s tone took a concerned note, &quot;Well, just remember not to fall asleep without completing your day, you know how much you hate it when you have to deal with a morning after that.&quot; She furrowed her brow. What would happen if she didn&#39;t fuck someone else by the time she fell asleep? The thought almost displaced the sea of cocks swimming through her imagination. She was almost excited to find out, but Ernest made it seem like it was an inconvenience at the very least. &quot;Just remember to let me know if you need me. Hannah was a handful, so I&#39;ll need about an hour to recover my stamina a little. Keep yourself occupied! Play my video game or something.&quot; he waved into the Foyer, which still hadn&#39;t been cleaned up from Jennifer and Barry&#39;s bukkake session. <br />
<br />
As he put his shirt on and walked back up the stairs, Jennifer finished her cereal and decided to take him up on his offer. She retreated to the GameStation at the big screen, and loaded up her favorite game. She might have been a cheerleader, but her brother was a bit of a dork so she always had games around. Her favorite game was called &quot;Bez&quot; and was a trance-rhythm game. As she started poking around at the menu options, she found one of the modes she&#39;d throw on if she wanted to play without consequence. &quot;Endless&quot; mode. Not that she wasn&#39;t good at the game, she just had a few things to mull over and didn&#39;t feel like paying strict attention to her timing.<br />
<br />
But as the level started up, she noticed with a heightened awareness that the controller was thumping and rumbling in time to the beat. She became distracted by the surging motors inside the controller. She had been holding the controller normally, but with her increased bust size her nipples were resting comfortably on the top of it. Every time the beat pounded, her tits buzzed. Soon she was laying, sprawled out, lower half across the floor while her upper half was cradled in the couch cushions. It didn&#39;t take long for the music, the stimulation, and the activities of the day to take their toll on her, as she drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
She awoke with a dry feeling in her mouth. Like she needed a glass of water. But the fluid that came to mind wasn&#39;t clear at all. As she got up to try to procure the magic elixir, she noticed that she couldn&#39;t. In fact, she flopped triumphantly forward, her additional mass anchoring her in place. As she woke up and sized up her situation, she realized that her breasts had increased in size while she had slept, and were now too heavy for her to lift. As she continued to observe the differences, she noticed that--while her stomach remained slim--her waist had ballooned out as if the asses of two Brazilian porn stars had been surgically fused into her already ample booty.<br />
<br />
But she wasn&#39;t alarmed. In fact, she began trying to navigate her hand through the sea of flesh to find her slit. She barely had room for rational thought, aside from one phrase that was screaming through her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, fuck my brains right out my dripping cunt right this fucking second!&quot; she moaned loudly, hoping her brother, a neighbor, or even the neighbor&#39;s beautiful daughter (for that matter) would answer the call.</p>
