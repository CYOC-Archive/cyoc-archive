<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>You don't want to find out what made them, but you examine them closely and find that they belong to a... a werewolf.</Br>
<Br>You stand back up erect, shocked at the discovery that you just made. For so long, you thought that werewolves were just a tale of fiction, a creature of fantasy made to scare people and not something of reality. It was then that you thought about something, something that you had forgotten for some time. You remember that when people tell stories, it usually is from something that really did exist. A version of a werewolf story that you remember hearing about, now that you were thinking of it, had to deal closely with what you would consider to be more of a bigfoot. Now that you saw those huge prints, a mix of wolf and human, you knew that at least a single werewolf really did exist.</Br>
<Br>Not really knowing what to do, you just decide to go about your business like you had planned in the first place. It was the middle of the day, there wasn't another soul around for miles and you smiled when you thought about doing whatever you wanted... especially for the very fact that you could. Thinking about it, you just decide to go back into your cabin and just relax, especially since that was what you had come up there to do.</Br>
<Br>As you watch satellite television, after having read a part of your favorite book "An American Werewolf in London" which also had a movie adaptation, you hear a rustling noise outside but pay no attention to it. You knew that you were in the middle of a very secluded forest and it was more than likely just an animal scurrying about through the brush a few feet from your window. Paying little attention to it, you think about your choice of reading material and how funny it was that there was a real werewolf print outside the cabin. Having read the book and seen the movie, you wonder if the werewolf that had come across your cabin was anything like the werewolf David was. Hoping that it was a more human or anthro version that you have seen in several adaptations of a werewolf, you just go on watching television. However, that was until you heard a knock on the front door, which startled you a bit. Having not expected to have anyone to come across your secluded home in the woods, it was more than odd that it had happened so quickly.</Br>
<Br>Not wanting to be rude, figuring it was a traveler that had gotten lost or even one of the other people that lived far away and just wanted to stop by and see if anyone was home, you decided you wanted to see just who it was. Not needing to take more than five, normal strides, you arrived at the door and opened it to greet your visitor.</Br>
<Br>There in front of you was a man of average height, with an average muscular build, with a light shadow on his rugged face, deep brown eyes, average sized nose, with a nice and stylish forward comb through. His hands were of average size, but they looked hard and rough from what was hard work from some activity. He had a nice, but average tan with a medium covering of hair on his exposed skin, which included: a portion of his chest; his entire forearms and his lower legs that were exposed from wearing shorts. You also noticed that he carried with him a large bottle of water that was half gone, rugged and seemingly well used hiking boots. He was everything that you could consider to be a "man's man".</Br>
<Br>You smiled at the man to be polite and to give him a welcoming greeting. "Hello... what can I do for you?"</Br>
<Br>The man smiled, showing off his perfect white teeth, and you noticed that his bottom and top K-9s were very sharp, but you thought nothing of it.</Br>
<Br>"Oh... well I was just taking a long walk through these woods that I like to call home and I happened to come across your cabin. I have been by here a few times, since I like to get my share of exercise, but usually there is no one here. Since I was within a few feet of your home and I heard your television going, I knew that I should just come by and have a chat with someone I could consider to be my neighbor... even if we are fifteen miles apart, give or take."</Br>
<Br>Having listened to his words, you couldn't help but to think that the guy was nice and genuine. Even though he had a very manly appearance, his voice was average and yet slightly soft. He was also an eloquent speaker for someone who looked like they worked in the construction industry for the majority of his life. You also realized that he was around your age of the mid-twenties. Not wanting to have him think that there were ill feelings, you decided to engage him in conversation.</Br>
<Br>"Hey yeah! It is always great to meet a neighbor, regardless of how far apart one may live from another. I do have to admit, you kind of startled me. I don't want to sound like a wimp or anything, but not having nearby neighbors, you kind of have to jump when you hear a knock on your door."</Br>
<Br>You both chuckle, knowing that you had a point. "Yeah, I know what you mean there man. When I first started living out here a few years ago to relax and rid myself of the hectic life the city had, I was much like you when I got my first visitor. There is nothing to be ashamed of... besides, between you and me, I..." He looked around a bit sheepishly, almost embarrassed by the statement he was about to make. "... I yelped like a frightened little girl."</Br>
<Br>Not expecting that, you try to hold back your laughter in fear that this guy might pummel you, but failed miserably. Fortunately, he burst into laughter shortly after you lost your composure.</Br>
<Br>"Well... that certainly isn't something I would expect to hear from a guy like you. Would you like to come in for a drink? It is actually nice to have company out here in the middle of nowhere."</Br>
<Br>The man thought about it for a second, while scratching his scruffy face, then smiled. "You know what, I would like a drink. Water is great, but when there is a chance you can have something else, you definitely have to take it."</Br>
<Br>"Great, come on in and make yourself at home!" You said as you motioned for him to enter, stepping out of his way then closing the door behind once he was quickly sitting on your sofa. "What would you like to drink? I have soda, Whiskey, Scotch, Bourbon, Beer and good old Moonshine. If you don't want any of those, I could refill that water bottle for you, since half of it is gone already."</Br>
<Br>Surprised by your assortment, he smiled and then chuckled. "Man, you really are prepared just in case something were to happen and you got stuck. Hell, you could throw one hell of a party with just yourself! What kind of beer do you have? I really could use a cold brew."</Br>
<Br>You laugh openly, realizing that he did have a point, but it wasn't often that you got up to the cabin and each time you did, you were sure to bring another liquor to add to the selection for a rare occasion such as this.</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I guess you do have a point. I have a relatively new beer that is brewed in my hometown of Lunarton. It's called 'Blue-Moon-Brew. It is really good and quite flavorful."</Br>
<Br>As you told him what the beer's name was, he picked up your DVD of <u>An American Werewolf in London</u> and laughed. "I'd like to have one, if you don't mind. You know, I have this very movie back at my place... it's one of my favorites."</Br>
<Br>"Sure not a problem. That's cool, by the way, that you like a good werewolf movie too." While you walked over to your cooler to grab a couple beers and a bottle opener, you kept speaking. "You know... an hour or two before you knocked on my door, I saw some interesting tracks outside, but the weird thing was it looked like it was something out of a fictional movie. I could have sworn that they were from a werewolf! Do you think werewolves even exist there... um... you know I never did get your name." You finished as you handed him the opened bottle and sat down.</Br>
<Br>"Oh... sorry about that. The name is David and yeah, I think they could exist. I mean why couldn't they? People think aliens are out there in space somewhere. People think that bigfoot roams the woods in Oregon and Washington here in the United States. Why couldn't a werewolf exist? I mean hell... look around you. There is so much forest for as far as the eye can see. In fact, this country is so sparsely populated, there could be all kinds of creatures that we don't even know about roaming around out there in the vast wilderness. Hell, if a werewolf did exist, it could be in human form right now. Hell... for all you and I know, either one of us could be without even knowing the truth about one another. Don't get me wrong, I think you are a nice guy from what I have seen with your hospitality, but you really could be a werewolf. I mean think about it... the beer you have, the town where you are from... all could be cheesy hints that I need to fear for my life."</Br>
<Br>You both chuckle, especially since you knew he had a point. "Well... I can't help where my parents decided to settle down and give birth to me. I also can't help the beer's name, especially since I come from such a strangely named town and they named the beer to be associated with the town, even though they only sell it from 'Lunarton'."</Br>
<Br>"Yup... you are probably right. Hell... for all you know, I could be the werewolf and trying to throw you off track, all so you had no suspicion that a darker side lived deep within me, but... that is all nonsense. You and I, we are just a couple of guys enjoying a good brew while bullshitting with one another."</Br>
<Br>You two clanged your beer bottles together, cheering one another on your new found friendship. Having gotten lost in the time you were having with David, you noticed outside that it was starting to get dark. Thinking you should be hospitable even further, you consider offering him to stay there for the evening. Not wanting to be rude, you decided that would be the best course of action and leave the ball in his court.</Br>
<Br>"So David, in all the time that we have been talking and since you arrived near the end of the afternoon, it has started to get dark. Being the hospitable guy that I am, I would like to offer you a place to stay for the night. If you would like, you could stay here and sleep either on the sofa or in/on an extra sleeping bag I brought with me in case I had a visitor or if I wanted to sleep directly under the stars and the moonlight since it's virtually impossible to do in the city."</Br>
<Br>David scratched his face again, this time through a slightly thicker shadow, since he apparently had not shaved for the day, going with a more manly and rugged look. "You know, I think I will stay here since you have offered it to me. Walking home in the night, in these woods, can be treacherous and if there is a werewolf out there, it probably would be a good idea to stay here. Besides, if the werewolf decided to attack the cabin since there are dwellers inside, two against one massive beast would be better than going mono-e-mono."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah... true, very true. Alright, I'll go and get a blanket and some pillows to make things a bit more comfortable. It is still early, so I will just set them beside the sofa and you can ready yourself at any point."</Br>
<Br>David smiled again and you thought you caught something out of the corner of your eye. You could have sworn that David's already sharp and longer than normal K-9s were slightly longer. Thinking it was just your imagination, you ignored it and went about your business. As you got everything ready for him, David just sat on the sofa and mindlessly watched the television while eying the movie and fiddling with the case. When you came back in the room from your the storage closet in the master bedroom, you noticed that he was really looking the movie over.</Br>
<Br>"Hey David, you seem to be really looking that movie over. Would you like to watch it?"</Br>
<Br>His eyes seemed to light up and have a luminous glow about them, like a small child opening a toy on Christmas Day. "Yeah, I would like that! Also, could I have another beer... if you don't mind? That is a damned good brew!"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah sure! Why don't you go ahead and pop the movie in while I grab the cooler over so we can get drunk. I have a lot of this beer in my possession, since it is mainly what I drink. I also have found the movie to be a bit funny when drunk."</Br>
<Br>You and David laughed while you went and got the cooler of beer while David put the movie in. When you were on your way back, you noticed something odd again, but thought your eyes were playing tricks on you. His body seemed bigger, filling his clothes a bit more while his body was a bit hairier than you remembered. Again, you ignored it, thinking you already had a slight buzz going since you didn't eat for a while before drinking that first beer. When you sat down beside him, you saw that the movie had started and the duo were just entering the bar. Cracking open the next set of beers, you handed one to David and mindlessly watched the movie. Almost immediately, you both chugged down a large amount of the beer, being thirstier than you had even realized.</Br>
<Br>Sitting there, watching the movie with your new companion, time flew by and before you knew it, the movie was at the part where David was about to transform for the first time. David, the manly guy sitting beside you, looked at you with glazed over eyes and smiled. You noticed that his face was definitely more rugged, having thick stubble, thinking that he just grew facial hair abnormally fast.</Br>
<Br>"Hey bud, do you think that you could pause the movie? This is my favorite part and I really need to drain my snake."</Br>
<Br>You chuckled. "Yeah sure! I am sure you know where the bathroom is, especially for that need."</Br>
<Br>"Heh, yeah I do! Right out your front door." He laughed, obviously just as inebriated as you were.</Br>
<Br>David got up, walked to the front door and stepped out a few steps, then drooped his fly. He let his cock hang free in the breeze while he relieved himself. When he was done, he shook it a couple of times then walked right back into the house. Shocked that he just walked back into your place with his cock hanging there for you to look at, you just gave him an odd look.</Br>
<Br>"Um... David... do you know you still have your cock out?"</Br>
<Br>Sitting down on the sofa next to you, he didn't respond or pay any attention. When you repeated yourself, you got his attention. David looked at his crotch, saw his cock and smiled.</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I guess it is... what do you think? Do you like what I got?"</Br>
<Br>You were a bit taken aback by his comment, you were definitely feeling a nice buzz going and you knew that he had one too. Not really knowing what to say, you just looked at his member and thought nothing of it really. You juggled the idea around in your head for a second, then came to a decision.</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I guess. I am not queer or anything, but I'd have to say you do have a nice dick. Yours is a bit thicker than mine even in your flaccid state."</Br>
<Br>"Heh... yeah..." He said as he trailed off in a drunken haze.</Br>
<Br>Not really caring that he had his dick out, you returned your focus back on the movie, while looking over to him for a second to ask him a question. "You want me to start the movie back up?"</Br>
<Br>"Hell yeah! His transformation always gets me hard!"</Br>
<Br>Even though you were feeling a good buzz, you still heard the strangeness in the comment. Thinking he was just talking for the sake of talking, you played it off again. Hitting play, the blue moon song came on and David started to undergo his transformation. As you were watching, not paying any attention to David beside you, you heard him grunt and moan. Looking over at him, he had a huge smile on his face and then you saw his cock. This time, it was fully erect and bigger than you thought possible. His cock was a full seven inches, as far as you could tell and was as thick as a soda can.</Br>
<Br>"Dude!" You exclaimed. "You are sporting a woody and it looks like you are leaking pre!"</Br>
<Br>David looked down at his cock, smiled, then looked right at you. The look on his eyes was new, foreign and beastly. If you weren't buzzed, you would have sworn that his eyes were a deep emerald green while the whites of his eyes were an amberish hue. "Yeah, I suppose you are right!" He then paused for a second, then smiled broadly. "You wanna touch it?"</Br>
<Br>Really surprised by his comment, you didn't know what to say or even do. This was all starting to get really weird, really fast.</Br>
<Br>"Um... I think you should go David. I know I said that you could stay here, but that was before things got really strange!"</Br>
<Br>"Oh... you don't like me like this?" He asked, his voice no longer sounding slurred from the alcohol.</Br>
<Br>"Um... I do like you bud, but not like that!"</Br>
<Br>"Well... I am sorry, but I told you that his transformation gets me worked up. Besides, I saw how you were looking at my cock before I got hard and especially after. We are in the middle of the woods, no one is around for miles, as you are well aware. Why don't you just go ahead and touch it, I know you want to. I know that you want to touch it and even get your fingers on my juices."</Br>
<Br>You look at David strangely, noticing things were even more different about him now. His muscles were definitely bigger, even to the point of making his clothes tear where they could not hold against his now hulking size. His entire portion of exposed skin was covered in his thick auburn hair color, it was almost like... no wait it was fur. Your eyes widen in the truth of what was going on, especially seeing that his hands had thickened while his fingernails lengthened forming claws. Within seconds, you could hear and then see his feet bursting forth from the Timberland boots he was once wearing, sharp claws and all. With every second his body became more lupine, with his face pushing out into a snout, his ears elongating and becoming more triangular while moving to the top of his head while his muzzle finished pushing outward. You look an notice that his nose was at the end of his snout, flattened by the new construction of his face. As you took a step back to give the creature it's space, you notice that he ripped a hole in the back of his pants to allow his tail to be free. Within seconds, his fluffy wolven tail burst free. David took a step toward you, closing the gap between you two, and you just stood there... not knowing what you really could do. Then David took another step forward and you could see a couple things. First, his cock was slightly longer and now as thick as a beer can, while his pants split and allowed you to see that his baseball sized balls had a bit more room. The second thing was, where he was still wearing the now very constrictive clothing, large tufts of the auburn fur poked through the large tears in the clothes.</Br>
<Br>Something really unexpected happened then, David... in his lupine form, talked. "So human, I bet you didn't expect that I was the werewolf?" Surprisingly to you, he still sounded the same, even though his voice was gruffer, guttural, and slightly deeper.</Br>
<Br>Not able to move from fright and shock, you stood there and mustered the strength to at least be able to speak. "Actually, I kind of suspected. You did give a few subtle hints in the way you were talking, not to mention... I noticed subtle changes in your physicality, but ignored them because I thought I was seeing things from my buzz."</Br>
<Br>David stepped closer while you remained where you were. All you could see was his now wolf form and the much bigger cock with a raging hard'on for the entire world to see. Although the whole world didn't see it, only you did and it was huge. You contemplated the werewolf's offer, thinking about touching it, not really knowing if you wanted to or even if you should. You knew in doing so, that would spawn something you may or may not like, but it was an intriguing offer.</Br>
<Br>David breathed in the air deeply, thinking he smelled something different around him, something different in the room. David stepped closer to you, while you remained still. David was still the six foot tall person you had met, but he was slightly taller from his digi-grade stance. Sniffing the air again, David realized that there was something different about you, something familiar. All you could think about was him being a werewolf for one and how massive his junk was, especially since you always felt that you were lacking in that department. You were always shy about undressing in the locker-room in front of all of the guys, fearing that you would be made fun of for having a small dick and balls. You weren't more than five inches long and an inch thick while your balls were the size of small grapes. What he had, what was there for you to look at, you thought was beyond amazing.</Br>
<Br>"Human... there is something different about you, something very familiar to me, but I cannot put a claw on what it is. You smell... you smell... either like me or aroused. I can't tell which though."</Br>
<Br>You had a werewolf right there in front of you, smelling everything you were giving off. You were curious to check him out further, but still weren't sure if you wanted to cause what you knew what would happen. All you could think right now was <Em>Oh Wow...</Em></Br></p>
