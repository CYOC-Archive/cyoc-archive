<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel scowled as she touched the back of her panties, feeling the warm mess sitting inside. Man, that potion was ripe! Just one sip made her poop her panties! She thought she should be disgusted, given that she was supposed to get a nice present but instead got what seemed more like a prank. However, strangely enough, the feeling of pooping out of her control was kind of nice. It was like the responsibility was taken away from her, and instead filling it with relief. She eyed the potion carefully. If just one sip made her do that, what would the whole potion do? She had no doubt it would be permanent, and more likely than not she&#39;ll walk away incontinent for the rest of her life. However, that didn&#39;t seem to bother her that much. She could just start wearing diapers to school, explain that she got in an accident and needed them now. Yeah, it&#39;s be a shift, but one she thinks she&#39;d like to see happen. She made up her mind: she wanted to see what this potion did to her, and even if the results included some severe side effects, she doesn&#39;t think she&#39;ll regret it. Besides, someone sent this to her as a gift, right? They had to have given this for a reason (unless it was a horrible horrible prank from another, which she would rather not think about). With that, she raised the potion.<br />
&quot;Bottoms up, diapers here we come.&quot; She chugged the rest of the potion and finished with a satisfied sigh. No turning back now. The first effects showed up as a major commotion in her belly, groaning and gurgling as well as an increase in pressure. Just as before, the pressure moved down and out her butt as a major fart, this time a lot louder. This fart reverberated throughout her body, almost like a speaker, as it made tiny ripples throughout her body. The ripples slowly started to get bigger, Rachel noticed, as her body did. With a look of surprise, she touched her now chubbier belly with curiosity. Was this potion also making her gain weight? Her question was answered as her body continued to expand, making her shirt ride up over her now plush belly. She felt the same with her butt, the poop filled panties squishing closer and tighter to her behind. She was starting to think she should&#39;ve prepared a bit more before drinking. She decided to try and make her way to the bathroom without disturbing anyone. This was easier said than done as she had no control over her mega-farts, and was starting to have trouble moving with her fatter body. Luckily, she made it with little trouble as she locked the bathroom door behind her. She quickly removed her panties before they became too tight to remove, and emptied the poop into the toilet. With that, she plopped down on to the toilet waiting for her inevitable bowel movement. She then stopped herself. Why would she sit on the toilet for that? Isn&#39;t that taking away the fun of no control? Yeah, she&#39;s not controlling it, but it&#39;s happening in a place where that doesn&#39;t matter. She got back up and put the panties back on, hoping it could hold its weight. Her body was much much larger now, so she had quite a bit of trouble seeing as she could barely see over her belly. She stepped onto an electronic scale, and when realizing she could no longer even see her feet, stepped off to she her weight. 320 lbs. She was now 320 pounds? Looking into the mirror, she saw just how swollen her body looked, fat hanging off of every inch of her. The fart started coming to a sputtering end, hinting Rachel off to what was going to happen next. As she predicted, she felt soft poop coming out and filling her panties. When that feeling of pooping yourself without worry came, Rachel knew this was all worth it. She didn&#39;t even know why, but she knew she really liked this feeling.  Every now and then a fart would come out with the poop, but it was mostly just a relaxing bowel movement. It wasn&#39;t ending anytime soon, though, as more and more waste made its way into her too small panties. With panic, Rachel realized that she might soon run out of room and start making a mess on the floor. Hoping that would not happen, Rachel moved to try and relieve her panties by dumping its contents into the toilet and flushing. Three times she had to do this, and she was starting to fear that she&#39;d clog the drains, but finally the bowel movement came to an end. She still had a fair amount of poop left in her panties, though. She looked at her reflection, seeing the new her as a dull fart came out: a fat, gassy, bowel incontinent girl. And she was now stuck like that. A major pang of regret hit her in the chest, making her second guess this decision. Did she make it too impulsively? She didn&#39;t know she would get so obese or gassy. Was she fine with that too? How would she explain tripling her own weight? And while poop was usually silent, there was no way she could hide her farts. She sighed heavily as she bounced her belly. She made this decision, so she now had to live with it regardless of how she felt. She might as well try and see the positives here. She...was now fat. Great. She was super jiggly, though, which was fun. Plus, she was probably super cuddly now, too! Looking down at her still bouncing belly, Rachel tried to think of some more positives about her new body. She spun her body left and right, watching with amusement as her body followed. The jiggly-ness was actually really fun, even if her body was a bit harder to maneuver. Another loud fart shot out of her butt, once again out of her control. What was good about that? Well, it did jiggle her jiggles, she found. She was starting to sound ridiculous. She was thin, and now she was one of the fattest girls in school. She was also gassy with no control over it, and to top it all off she was bowel incontinent. That was, like, the lowest you could get in the school hierarchy that she swore existed. Well, now that meant only her real friends would stay by her side, and she could do things other people were afraid to do in public without even a second thought. That had to count for something. Also, pooping herself felt amazing for whatever reason. That was the main reason. With another sharp fart, Rachel turned to empty her panties again and start a shower. Time to clean off! What should she do next?</p>
