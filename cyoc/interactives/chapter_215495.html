<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite the Animalian virus promising restored youth and perfect health, not everyone in the country is wanting to go through conversion. Some people didn&#39;t want to become part-animal for various reasons. And others didn&#39;t want to start their lives over. They may have grown weary of this world and experienced all they wanted to. They may be satisfied with their long lives and be ready to move on peacefully.<br />
<br />
Such was the case with Maybanke. She&#39;s had a very long life, actually turning 100 last year. Sadly, her husband didn&#39;t live as long as her. Even more sadly was that her children had died during Hurricane Sandy 10 years ago. Fortunately, Maybanke still had her three grandchildren and had altered her will so that upon her passing, her possessions will all be sold off and all of her money would be divided among her grandchildren. She would have been satisfied passing on knowing her family would be well-off.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, her eldest grandson wasn&#39;t satisfied with this. He wanted his inheritance now. And what&#39;s more, he was demanding a larger cut of the fortune than the others. And he wouldn&#39;t take &#39;no&#39; for an answer, even after 10 years. After the first few months, Maybanke thought that her grandson was in trouble for gambling debts. Eventually, it became apparent that while he did gamble, he wasn&#39;t as nearly in the red as he claimed to be. It seemed he wanted access to more money so he could get into even higher stake games. Then he brought his own lawyers and have been looking for a way to undermine his grandmother to get his inheritance early. To his credit, he never tried to bump her off. But it wasn’t until he said to his face that he deserves the lion’s share of his inheritance over his fellow heirs that Maybanke decided to do something quite drastic to put him in his place.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you realize that double-dosing someone of your considerable age will make Regressive Hypersexuality Syndrome a guarantee,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t drive me completely mad, will it?&quot; asked Maybanke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not mad, you&#39;ll still be rational. But your actions and decisions may be heavily-based on your rampant hormones,&quot; said Dr. Stein, &quot;You may need to relearn self-control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you will be providing someone to help me with my new urges,&quot; said Maybanke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, though you should realize that the specific Animalian you&#39;ve chosen comes with their own particular social structure,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meaning I will have to join someone&#39;s pride?&quot; asked Maybanke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily a pride. I understand these smaller groups are referred to as &#39;dynasties&#39;, that seems like a contradiction of terms,&quot; said Dr. Stein, &quot;Though there is one such dynasty that&#39;s been looking to expand.&quot; He handed her a file pertaining to Andrew and his mate, Kinjara. Andrew already had a son, now fully-grown and with two mates of his own. Maybanke thought they seemed like a nice couple and if she was going to be reliving her wild years, it may as well be with just two people instead of a large group.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Quite to Maybanke&#39;s surprise, not only was Kinjara open to the idea of her joining their small pride, but she insisted that she and Andrew would convert her personally. She wouldn&#39;t have expected a married woman to respond like this, but it was a convenience. Soon enough, Maybanke was dropped off at Andrew&#39;s house. Kinjara rushed out to meet her with Andrew behind her. &quot;Greetings, my new sister-mate,&quot; said Kinjara joyously. She paused when she saw how old and frail Maybanke looked. &quot;You&#39;re a bit older than I was expecting,&quot; said Kinjara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be turning 101 in August,&quot; said Maybanke, &quot;And I have six great-grandchildren.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kinjara turned to Andrew and asked, &quot;Don&#39;t centenarians become bigger, more impressive Animalians?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew shrugged and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s strictly true, but it seems to be the case for the ones that have converted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, perfect,&quot; said Kinjara. She turned to Maybanke and said, &quot;You look a little too fragile for what I initially had in mind, but I think we can adjust. With that, she easily picked up Maybanke and carried her inside. Maybanke was a bit shocked to be handled this way. True, old age has shrunk her and made her lighter, but she felt like Kinjara was carrying her like a doll. And she also couldn&#39;t help but feel intimidated by the lionesse&#39;s strong, curvy physique. It almost made Maybanke feel like a child in comparison.<br />
<br />
Maybanke was carried straight to Andrew and Kinjara&#39;s bedroom. Jeff wasn&#39;t home as he was at college with his mates, or at least one of them. &quot;You know, I&#39;m really grateful that you&#39;ll be joining us,&quot; said Kinjara, &quot;As proud as I am for my stepson having two mates, it just feels off with him having more mates than his father. Now if you&#39;ll just strip down, than we can start having fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We?&quot; asked Andrew, walking in behind Kinjara.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to keep my new sister-mate all to yourself,&quot; said Kinjara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now hold on, hold on, aren&#39;t you an uplifted lioness?&quot; asked Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Kinjara, running a hand over her smooth scalp, &quot;And at times, I envy Zoe and Lena&#39;s hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I thought uplifted animals can&#39;t have any homosexual urges,&quot; said Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, well, lionesses are a bit of a special circumstance,&quot; said Kinjara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still more?&quot; asked Andrew wryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s true that as feral beasts, we have no interest in our fellow lionesses. But once we uplifted, our libidos went up, and often there&#39;s not enough male to keep us all satisfied. So we help relieve each other when the king&#39;s busy with one of his other mate,&quot; said Kinjara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I never heard of that,&quot; said Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s something we keep behind closed doors,&quot; said Kinjara, &quot;It&#39;s easy for people to pick up the wrong idea about our &#39;harems&#39;. Anyways, we only do it with fellow sister-mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so would Zoe and Lena...&quot; started Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as often,&quot; said Kinjara, &quot;Jeff keeps them mostly satisfied, though I&#39;m sure they have their fun when Jeff is resting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me.&quot; The two lions turned to Maybanke who was down to her underwear. &quot;Could we get started on this before I lose my nerve?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. Andrew, kiss your new mate,&quot; said Kinjara. Andrew nodded before bending down and delivering a kiss on Maybanke&#39;s lips. She gagged a little as his rough tongue forced its way into her mouth for a moment. The small spines left her mouth tingling afterwards until she felt the tingling spread. &quot;Good, now strip down while I help her with her second dose.&quot; Kinjara had been wearing her tribal costume and a dressing robe, partially to set the mood, but mostly so it would be easier to take off. She picked up Maybanke and placed on the bed. &quot;Drink, sister-mate,&quot; she said in a throaty growl, &quot;Become the lioness you were meant to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybanke hesitated at first, but she already had one dose and it was too late to stop now. It felt awkward for her to be suckling from another woman&#39;s breast, especially a woman so much larger than her. But as Kinjara&#39;s milk went down her throat, the tingling she felt intensified. Strength she had never felt before flooded her body as old age was being washed away. Her skin began losing its wrinkles and liver spots though those minor details were soon lost as downy hair grew over her body before thickening into tawny fur. Her weakened bones creaked as they strengthened and grew, her muscles growing to keep up. As more and more milk went into her mouth, her remaining teeth became sharper as new replacements sprouted, her tongue getting rougher as it became more feline.<br />
<br />
Kinjara looked down with approval as Maybanke grasped her arms, her grip growing stronger as her nails extended into claws. Her feet were reworking themselves into massive lion&#39;s paws as her tail started growing out. Her underwear was getting increasingly smaller on her growing frame, especially she started assuming a more curvaceous figure. Extending her own claws, Kinjara slashed through the straining cotton. Maybanke sat back up with a start, clutching her breasts which were rapidly regaining the roundness of her youth. &quot;I believe she&#39;s ready for your scepter, my king,&quot; said Kinjara.<br />
<br />
Maybanke looked behind her to see a naked Andrew on the bed, his leonine dick fully erect. Just seeing it gave her a burning need stronger than anything she felt in her life. &quot;Yes, give it to me,&quot; her voice sounding less like a creaky old woman and more like a big cat. Andrew grasped her much shapelier hips and positioned his dick under her growing ass. Once he was properly lined up, he plunged in deep.<br />
<br />
Maybanke let out a low moan as she felt Andrew penetrating her. Her body was going through the last parts of her transformation. By then, she was mostly lioness, but she kept growing. Her height and muscles were coming closer to Lena&#39;s class. Her breasts became larger than her old head had been and Kinjara was now fondling and sucking on them. Maybanke&#39;s voice deepened as her face finished pushing out into a muzzle. But the biggest change was when her shoulder-length grey hair exploded out into long ruby tresses that went down to near her ass. Maybanke let out a mighty roar as she came a lioness for the first time, Andrew soon following as he pumped into his newest mate.<br />
<br />
Kinjara grinned up at the impressive amazonian lioness that Maybanke had become. &quot;Centenarians really do become the most impressive Animalians,&quot; she said, &quot;It looks like you have your own Guennol Lioness now, Andrew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew huffed and said, &quot;Of course, that&#39;s up to Maybanke if she wants to stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I want to stay,&quot; said the new lioness, &quot;And don&#39;t call me &#39;Maybanke&#39;, it sound so old and fussy.&quot; She weaved a hand through her long mane, more voluminous than the one she had years ago. &quot;It looks like I can start calling myself &#39;Ruby&#39; again,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And is Ruby ready to share with her sister-mate?&quot; asked Kinjara.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as Andrew has enough for both of us,&quot; said Ruby. Before, she had never really consider being with another woman. But now she wouldn&#39;t mind being in a perpetual threesome between these two sexy lions.</p>
