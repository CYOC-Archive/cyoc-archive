<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick laid on his bed for a while, his mind trying to comprehend what had happened. He wanted to laugh, cry, and throw a fit all at the same time. Charity had taken everything, the once sweet girl turning out to be a class A bitch. Slowly he reached down to his crotch, fingers coming into contact with his new pussy. He let out a heartbroken sigh. This had to be a horrible nightmare, but he knew it wasn&#39;t. There had to be a way to fix this. Things don&#39;t just happen. There&#39;s always cause and effect. Charity had some knowledge about it, but was she the start? When did this start? Derrick sat upright with realization. This all started when he fucked that chick Lara. Surely she knew what happened. He hopped off the bed, staggering as the drop seemed farther than he had remembered. Derrick glanced at the door, the full length mirror revealing the terrible truth. He was short... really short. Losing nine inches meant he now stood a very modest five foot, three inches. There was no way he was going to stay like this. He opened the door and headed down the hall. He knew where Lara and Jethro stayed. They roomed next to each other and made no secret how much they enjoyed each other&#39;s company. Hell, the two even got noise complaints... though never from girls. <br />
<br />
He approached the door, hearing the usual chorus of moans and groans. Did these two ever stop having sex? <br />
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I was laying on my back staring up at Lara who bounced joyously on my dick. This had become our activity of choice, me laying here while Lara fed my cock to her pussy till I had nothing but dry climaxes. I didn&#39;t mind though, hell no. She was always hungry and I was always her meal of choice. Blame it on her succubus genes or... whatever, but her pussy never got old. Always tight, always wonderful, and always able to coax whatever seed my testicles produced, out into her uterus. She started shouting. She was about to cum. She leaned her full weight on my chest, bouncing her hips up and down. I felt my balls tense, then release as she screamed, spasming with her own climax. She collapsed on top of me, more likely out of affection and gratitude rather than physical exhaustion. &quot;Fuck, I love your cock,&quot; she groaned. <br />
<br />
I reached up to wrap my arms affectionately around her when there came a sudden banging on our door. Well- my door but Lara never spent time in her room anyway. She shot up and was heading to the door fully nude while I attempted to cover myself with a sheet. Hey, sex addict or not I still hung on to conventions of modesty. Lara may be comfortable in her own succubus skin, but I definitely didn&#39;t want my dick to be a sight that was communally appreciated. She threw open the door to reveal Derrick, or at least what I recognized to be Derrick. Still while his face was familiar, the rest of him wasn&#39;t. I remembered him as being six foot and well built, but the man that stood at our door was thin and a midget. His eyes widened as he beheld Lara in her birthday suit. &quot;Damn,&quot; he muttered before Lara pulled him in and closed the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Derrick, how can we help you?&quot; Lara asked, tossing me a pair of gym shorts which I slipped on beneath the sheets. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s rich. You know what you can do? You can fix this!&quot; he shouted, dropping his pants that appeared a few sizes too big anyway. His dramatic display turned out to reveal... nothing. I blinked, rubbing my eyes as I placed my glasses back on. Sure enough where his manhood used to be there was nothing but the shaved pussy of a woman. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my goodness,&quot; Lara gasped, putting on a fake impression of sympathy. &quot;What happened? You used to be such a stud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened? You tell me! Ever since I fucked you she&#39;s become some sort of monster. Everytime I came inside her I would shrink and she would grow, like she was some sort of parasite! She took my dick!&quot; We all just stared in complete silence, as though trying to comprehend what was being said. &quot;Hello, do you have an antidote or something? Can you fix this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I can, Derrick. I mean you are right, I&#39;m the one who caused it, but I&#39;m sure we can both admit that you deserved it,&quot; Lara admitted, folding her arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-? No man deserves this!&quot; he screamed. Lara huffed, giving him a look of disbelief. He shifted awkwardly. &quot;Well okay, maybe I did deserve it a little but come on, this is too fucking far!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, admittedly I didn&#39;t think she&#39;d take it this far. I just figured she&#39;d lose interest once you were shrunk down to three inches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you do it?&quot; he pressed, Lara cocking an eyebrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Magic,&quot; she answered.<br />
<br />
Derrick stared at Lara in disbelief. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s cute. You expect me to fuckin&#39; believe that?! Nothing happens without a reasonable explanation. You had to have used chemicals or something like that, right? So just give me the antidote so my dick can grow back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you dare make demands of me, little boy!&quot; Lara hissed, the room suddenly becoming dark as her eyes glowed an ominous pink and her form gradually changed to look demonic. Bat wings exploded from her back as a tail sprouted just above her ass. &quot;I am not some pathetic little human who dabbles in amateur chemistry. I am a succubus. I feed on sex. Man&#39;s seed is my entre, a woman&#39;s milk is my chardoney, and her nectar is my dessert. I use magic and can erase you from existence without a second thought. So show me some damn respect!&quot; she hissed, horns sprouting from her forehead to curl down and around her temples. &quot;I punished you because of your infidelity, cursing you to lose your manhood to the woman you betrayed and then made your loss her gains. At the cost of what you prize most, she became the woman you wanted most. That is what I did.&quot; <br />
<br />
Derrick sat in the corner, curled up in a fetal position and desperately hoped that the monster who stood over him didn&#39;t harm him. &quot;Please, don&#39;t hurt me. I learned my lesson, I swear!&quot; Lara relaxed, her demonic accessories seeming to fade and vanish into thin air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you?&quot; she asked, cocking an eyebrow. &quot;You know Derrick, I don&#39;t mind promiscuity. Hell, without it where would I be? A low-powered fairy having to suck her mate dry and then move on. My kind tried that before, didn&#39;t like it. Too much death and not enough sex. However, if you&#39;re going to be a little man whore, at least do the decent thing and stay out of committed relationships. If it&#39;s one thing I hate, it&#39;s infidelity. Charity was loyal and you betrayed her as often as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I know I can&#39;t fix that, but I&#39;ve learned my lesson. I&#39;m not ready to commit, okay. I won&#39;t. Just... please give me my manhood back. I don&#39;t even care if my body stays like this just... please...?&quot; He looked at her with the most pathetic eyes I&#39;d seen in a man. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hm... maybe you have,&quot; she muttered, getting a drink of water from our mini fridge. <br />
<br />
She was obviously thinking about what to do. I could virtually see the wheels turning. She admitted that she did not expect Charity to take it this far so perhaps restoring his cock was only fair. However, it wasn&#39;t like he wouldn&#39;t adapt to having a pussy. Perhaps this was his just desserts. After all, did he even try to reconcile with Charity? Maybe Lara could finish what Charity started and make him fully woman. Then again, perhaps she could leave it up to fate and make a game out of it. High stakes indeed, but at least Derrick would take responsibility to some degree.</p>
