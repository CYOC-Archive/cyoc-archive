<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick and Chad typically didn&#39;t stay this late on a Friday, especially when the season was in. This was their only Bye week, so they would have typically been out partying with the rest of the team. But Derrick wanted to continue his leg conditioning to help beef up his quads for his new placekicking position with the team. Greg, a fellow senior and their primary placekicker, got injured the previous week, so Derrick had to step up to take on both punting and placekicking duties. Chad, one of the team&#39;s starting Wide Receivers, had been close friends with Derrick since they were both in elementary school, and offered to help out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bro,&quot; Derrick said, &quot;I might have overdone it on the leg presses, I hope I can recover in time for our game against Beach County next week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be alright, man,&quot; Chad replied, &quot;I hear ya though on taking it hard, I&#39;m gonna sleep in way late tonight, it&#39;s been a rough week, what with the conditioning that Ryerson has been putting us though, and the offensive drills that Coach Travis has been demanding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, Travis is a good coach, but he runs a tough practice,&quot; Derrick agreed. <br />
<br />
The men wound their way around the halls of the athletic center and back to the Varsity Men locker room for the football team. They had never stayed this late on a Friday before, so they figured that no one else would be around on a Friday night. Still, the locker room was unlocked, as they knew that the facility team didn&#39;t actually lock the athletic building or the football field until 10pm. <br />
<br />
&quot;You gonna shower tonight?&quot; Chad asked, pulling his T-Shirt a few paces ahead of Derrick as they worked their way toward their respective lockers. &quot;I might have to bail, supposed to meet up with Cynthia tonight,&quot; Chad added, winking to his buddy. <br />
<br />
Derrick smirked, &quot;no shit?!&quot; he said. &quot;She&#39;s the one who took your virginity away, right? She likes those younger men, hey?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind! College girls got more experience anyway, am I right?&quot; Chad chuckled, kicking off his tennis shoes. &quot;It would be better if I showered first, but I don&#39;t know if I have the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick pulled his own t-shirt off before turning back to Chad, now down to his compression shorts. &quot;Party tonight is over at Tom&#39;s uncle&#39;s house, though, right? Doesn&#39;t he have the pool and hot tub?&quot; Derrick added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah that&#39;s true,&quot; Chad reasoned. &quot;May be no need to shower then. Hey you want to come tonight? I know you and Liz broke up a few weeks ago, but hey! There&#39;s gotta be other chicks there you  might like, want to meet up with? Or hook up with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this a Wholesale Fuckathon? A flea market for pussy?&quot; Derrick said laughing, turning his gaze ever so slightly as Chad pushed down his compression shorts. <br />
<br />
Derrick sometimes wondered why he found himself eyeing a gaze toward his fellow jocks on occasion, even though he never popped a boner or fantasized about it directly. He found that he did like to take a sneak peak at his buddies whenever they were in the locker room, and realized that he probably paid more attention to the bodies of his teammates than they probably did to him, even though he knew he was certainly keeping up with them in his own athleticism.<br />
<br />
Chad turned to Derrick as he lifted up his left foot and caught his black compressions on his hand, Derrick saw once more as his dick swung to the left and like a pendulum waved back to the right to catch up with the rest of his body. Derrick quickly moved his eyes up to Chad&#39;s. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, bro,&quot; he said, continuing the conversation as he pulled off his own socks and slid down his gym shorts. &quot;The team is having a party tomorrow night at Brandon&#39;s, I don&#39;t know if I should do two parties in one weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I hear you, bro,&quot; Chad said, tossing his shorts into his longer but casually standing and conversing with his friend in the buff. Derrick liked that about his team, everyone was cool with their nudity regardless of the circumstances, but in the locker room, whether with a big or small group, most of the guys were not shy about hanging around naked. <br />
<br />
Derrick quickly joined Chad&#39;s state of nudity by pushing down his own compressions as he felt the cool breeze of the locker room whisk the sweat away from his loins. The initial feeling of getting naked always felt good to Derrick. He restood and turned back toward Chad and then nodded his head toward the showers. &quot;What the fuck, I smell like shit, I&#39;m gonna hit the showers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bradley number 4, baby!&quot; Chad said, pulling out his towel and swinging it toward Derrick, the corner edge of the towel just missing Derrick&#39;s abs by an inch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, too close for comfort!&quot; Derrick laughed, tossing a shampoo bottle back toward Chad. <br />
<br />
The &quot;Number 4&quot; Bradley pole was the was the one always coveted by the team since it was the pole that had both the perfect mixture of hot and cold and also the strongest water pressure. Now that Derrick and Chad were seniors, they had no problem getting that pole after practices and games with the full team, but they spent the first three years of their time vying for the pole that they could never get. Not a problem tonight though.<br />
<br />
Chad turned toward the showers and Derrick started pacing his way behind him, glancing up and down at Chad&#39;s toned back and firm butt as it rocked up and down with each step of his feet and his quads. Derrick got lost in his gaze for a moment, a moment too long, because he didn&#39;t watch his step and noticed he stepped in something incredibly cold and sticky. <br />
<br />
&quot;Squelch,&quot; his foot hit the floor as Derrick felt a shudder race through him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eww,&quot; he said, Chad turning around to see what was going on. <br />
<br />
Derrick looked down and below his right foot was a wadded, wet cotton jockstrap, an old style from the 80s. Derrick&#39;s first thought was that it looked like an old Bike brand that no one under 40 would ever wear, but Derrick quickly moved his foot out of the way and sat it back on the concrete floor of the locker room, only to still feel a sticky substance on the bottom of his foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, bro,&quot; Derrick said. &quot;Disgusting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad chuckled. &quot;Who the fuck left that there? HOLY FUCK!&quot; Chad realized, &quot;I think Ryerson wears those old fuckin jockstraps.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s shit on it, bro!&quot; Derrick answered back. &quot;Whoever wore that must have jacked off into it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s laughter exploded, &quot;did you just step in Ryerson spooge?!&quot; he asked. &quot;That&#39;s fuckin disgusting!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick bent down to pick up the strap, he had to know who&#39;s it was. &quot;Doesn&#39;t Steve the lineman wear these old things too?&quot; Derrick said, investigating it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe but put that fuckin&#39; thing down!&quot; Chad answered, &quot;that is definitely has cum all over it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick then realized that he had actually picked the sticky jockstrap up, why was he compelled to pick it up in the first place? Then he realized that since he first stepped on it, he was drawn to it. He kind of liked it. <br />
<br />
A couple of guys on the team wore jockstraps, but he never remembered anyone sporting the old style. Most of the guys, if they wore jocks at all, wore those Nike Pro or Under Armour jocks with the built in pads. Derrick had only worn a jockstrap during a summer at football camp a few y ears ago but found he preferred the compression shorts generally. <br />
<br />
But this one was different. Just holding it made Derrick feel like he would be the best player, the most skilled football player. Now, if only he wore it. He brought it closer to his face to look more closely at it. Sure enough, it was covered in creamy yellow and white mucous. Chad was right.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you gonna eat it, bro?!&quot; Chad said, still trying to sound funny but now sounding more worried. &quot;Come on, man, get rid of that thing, throw it away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick looked up at him. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll keep it? Who knows, might be a good luck charm!&quot; he told him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t be serious,&quot; Chad said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, bro, maybe I&#39;ll put it on now!&quot; Derrick said, throwing his towel out of his left hand. &quot;Why not,&quot; he added, now unfurling it, &quot;it&#39;s giving me this, feeling that I can&#39;t explain, I just feel like I gotta.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, don&#39;t do that,&quot; Chad added, &quot;Just put the fuckin&#39; thing down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick was already stepping his left foot through the unfurled straps, following by his right. Chad took a couple of steps back. He couldn&#39;t help but notice that Derrick was sporting a horizontal erection, a morning wood kind of stance that could only say that Derrick was actually excited by what he was doing!<br />
<br />
&quot;Derrick, dude,&quot; Chad said, now growing quiet, &quot;what are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick yanked the jock up over his thighs and let the cold, sticky cock pocket fold up over his hard dick and balls. He quickly bent his knees and let the straps take their place around the crest of his butt cheeks and he pulled the waist bands up on top of his Adonis. <br />
<br />
Snap.<br />
<br />
Despite the cold and stickiness, Derrick was somewhat impressed with himself. &quot;I think I might start wearing jocks at the games now! I feel like a million bucks when I have this on. I think it&#39;ll make me a better...&quot;<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t able to get &quot;Player&quot; out of his mouth before the bands on the jock tightened uncomfortably around him. They awoke with a force that Derrick that never felt before. &quot;AWW!&quot; Derrick shouted as he grabbed the bands. &quot;It got really tight. Oh fuck, Chad, I can&#39;t get it off!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick started to fumble around in a panic trying to get the jockstrap off, but he felt the cock cup awaken with a strong vibration, and as it did he noticed a new surge of energy enter into his body through his cock and balls. <br />
<br />
Derrick quickly lost his footing as the left foot jolted forward, he felt his exposed butt protrude hard against the straps as he nearly fell to the ground, catching himself with his hands on the floor. That was when he noticed that his hands and feet were exploding with growth. His eyes widened as his feet began to ripple wider, toenails stretching forward as the feet expanded, black hairs sprouting from the tops of his toes and then his feet as a dull, brown complexion started to stain his formerly pale feet. As they bubbled upward, his feet took on a rough texture and his nails hardened and elongated. <br />
<br />
The darker complexion moved up Derrick&#39;s legs and forearms. His thin, short blonde hairs on his legs darkened to a dark brown as his calves bubbled then pushed out new contours of sinew. His legs soon turned into a coarse carpet of brown as his thighs bulked up thicker and thicker. The rumbling on his cock, meanwhile, was starting to finally manifest in his package. His dick quickly thickened into a fat, long sausage of a cock while his balls filled and dropped heavily filling the jockstrap with his new Man Meat. Meanwhile his finely-toned butt began to push out with hard muscle and fat, thickening into boulders of an ass and protruding and stretching the jockstraps around his ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH FUCK!&quot; Derrick finally shouted with fear. &quot;What the fuck is happening to me, bro?!&quot; He shouted to Chad. &quot;What the FUCK!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad couldn&#39;t help but look on, he was completely hypnotized by what was happening in front of him. Derrick had been well-cut but not thick previously. That was quickly changing as his gut filled and fattened, both hard muscle and weight from age started to weigh in on him. Soon his flat but strong pecs began to beef up and out into large pectorals. His thin puff of blonde hair over his chest began to thicken with a the same coarse brown hair that had matted his legs. Soon, his shoulders followed as the muscle moving up from his hands began to match. Thick brown hair grew to cover his forearms as veins began to poke out. A thick dusting of dark hair then moved downward to his bellybutton, a new treasure trail covering his body. Derrick&#39;s fingers calloused as his body took on an age and maturity of an older man, an older man who had experienced a lifetime of football, a lifetime of keeping a well-built body but had been beaten down only so slightly over time with age and experience. His ass covered with a new blanket of brown fuzz to match the hairiness of the rest of his body. <br />
<br />
Derrick grabbed his head as he felt it contort. His thin, handsome image of a punter began to widen out, his jawline pushing outward, his face squaring up, wrinkles increasing across his shadowed face with a brown scruff. His blonde curled lengthened out into a dark, thick salt and pepper crew cut. <br />
<br />
Derrick looked to Chad with a plea in his eye, &quot;his mind, Chad, I can fuckin&#39; feel him, I&#39;m becoming him! NOO!&quot; he shouted as he felt his personality, his own history, his own consciousness move away as the attraction and lifeforce of another man began to overwrite him. &quot;He&#39;s taking over! Fucking Ryerson!&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly Derrick&#39;s fear of losing his life became displaced with the memories and personality of the Coach overriding him. That smattering of a fear became a deep, mature chuckle as Derrick felt the embrace of the Coach. <br />
<br />
&quot;FEELS FUCKIN GREAT, HUH, RICHARDSON!?&quot; Ryerson shouted looking at the young lad in front of him. <br />
<br />
Richardson - Chad&#39;s last name. Only Coach called him that. Chad watched as the new Derrick, a clone of Ryerson in every way, walked over to the mirror to check himself out. He gave his heavy package a quick tug and whispered &quot;fuck yeah&quot; as his boner grew to full size under the cock pocket of the jockstrap. <br />
<br />
Chad stumbled behind him as he tried to run, falling over the bench and landing on his naked butt. <br />
<br />
Ryerson turned himself back around. &quot;What the fuck is wrong with you kids?&quot; the coach said with a smirk. &quot;Don&#39;t you know to always keep your fuckin hands to yourself! Don&#39;t fuck with someone else&#39;s property!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryerson walked closer to the senior and unfurled his cock, erection aimed like a gun right on the naked jock below him as Ryerson stepped either foot on either side of the Wide Receiver. &quot;You like what you see, now?&quot; he asked, slowly pumping his exposed dick up and down.</p>
