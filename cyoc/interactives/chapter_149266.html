<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>By CAIN</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once again, they pushed away from each other in sheer horror and revulsion. Oscar actually lept out of the shower without even turning it off or grabbing a towel and made a bee line to the bedroom, where he hastily grabbed some baggy gym shorts and sandals and nothing else. He fled their condo without any thought of where he was going or what he was doing – All he knew is he needed to get away from there, get away from him, and all of the thoughts in his head telling him to do things he didn’t want to do. Even if they felt really good, and even if it felt natural…<br />
Meanwhile, David curled into a ball in the shower, water still streaming down his body, he hugged his knees as he cried to himself. What was going on? He thought to himself, Why did he do that? It didn’t make sense, none of it made sense. It must have been that mystic woman, she did this! She turned him into his own dad, took away his muscles, his massive cock, made him a little submissive bitch! He continued to cry, trying not to think about what just happened, or the voices telling him all the things he should do that he found unappealing, even if it felt good in the moment, even if it was what he wanted to do now, deep down…<br />
Oscar found himself in a local park he often frequented for anonymous hookups. Even though he just had a mind-blowing orgasm only a few minutes ago, he felt like getting fucked might get him back into the right frame of mind. He went into the far stall, the one with a hole in the wall to the next stall, and sat on the toilet and waited. It was about ten minutes later someone came in. At first he thought it was just a regular park goer, since they were mainly hanging around the urinal area. But then they walked down the bank of stalls and paused in front of the stall Oscar was in now, likely checking to see if it was occupied, he’d hoped. Then the individual walked into the next stall and in no time, had their pants down and their cock through the hole. Oscar saw the thin but long pale uncut cock with a few red pubes peeking through the hole. His mouth began to water, and he took the entire thing deep down his throat. He spent a great deal of time paying particular attention to the foreskin, sliding his tongue under it and swirling around the head. Then he would go back to deep throating it. <br />
All the while in his mind he was loving this, his body, however, was still not impressed. His cock remained totally flaccid (still an impressive 7 inches soft, but again, completely soft). He tried to rub it through his shorts, trying to coax it to grow, but nothing. He was getting frustrated now, and started to panic a little. He could tell this stranger was getting close to coming, so he pulled off. “Get the fuck over here and fuck my ass with that amazing cock now, bitch!” then, he was hard as a rock! “So that’s it, being dominant is what turns me on now? Fuck…” Oscar thought to himself. <br />
The stranger hesitated for a moment, probably a straight dude on the DL and wanting to keep it that way. He put his dick back in his blue jeans and zipped up. “Shit” Oscar thought, “I scared him off. I fucking blew it, and not in a good way…” But the stranger’s curiousity won out and a few seconds later Oscar saw the scuffed up brown work boots under the door of the stall and a brief knock. Oscar opened the door and in walked a young blue-collar man, likely in his early 20s, tall and well-toned and broad shouldered under that flannel shirt with a handsome face, with an obvious bit of tobacco in his lip, and amazing green eyes and ginger hair. “We gotta be quick” he said, in a sexy deep southern drawl, “I have to be at work in 10.” He paused and pulled out his cock again for me to continue sucking, “Oh, and don’t ever fucking call me a bitch again…” He said, voice dripping with unconcealed threat. “I don’t care how big you are fag, I’ll beat the shit out of you. Now fucking get me hard so I can fuck that ass.” Oscar obliged, feeling a little scared and, in his mind at least, very turned on by this curious straight dude threatening him, even if his dick had already softened back to its dormant form.<br />
Oscar stopped sucking and turned around, dropping his shorts to the floor and exposing his muscular (and virgin!) ass for the fit ginger to demolish. “Here it comes” Oscar thought to himself, “I’m gonna get fucked, and by a cute young alpha guy no less!” The stranger spit on his hand, working the spit around Oscar’s slightly hairy hole, “You ready for this meat fag?” “Yes Sir, fuck my ass, I need it dude!” “Well since you asked so nicely,” the ginger said, with a devious smirk and then he roughly slid in all of his several inches, until his balls hit Oscar’s ass. Oscar yelped in pain and squirmed underneath the fit young alpha, which only made the ginger hold him tighter, “Fuck you got a tight hole bitch! Stop moving around so much, just fucking relax and enjoy some southern hospitality.” He said with a smarmy look on his face. Meanwhile, Oscar’s ass was throbbing in pain, and not in a good way. It was so painful he thought his dick actually got smaller, but maybe it was just the cool air of the bathroom. Suffice to say, he was not enjoying this at all! But it was too late, he was already committed, so he couldn’t back out now, and he was sure the alpha ginger wouldn’t let him leave before he shot his load anyway. <br />
So Oscar just did what he could to relax, and despite the dick in his new ass not being terribly thick, it was still too much for him to take. He started seeing stars and got dizzy, and a little ill in his stomach. The ginger took this as his little anonymous bitch getting so into it and turned on that he might pass out from the amazing dicking he was giving this muscle bitch. Sadly, for the old Oscar, it definitely was good – Not as good as his son, but definitely top five fucks he’s ever had. But for the new Oscar in the overly beefed up teen alpha master body, this was pure Hell! “I’m gonna cum bitch!” the ginger said, as he leaned over Oscar’s wide back and gripped his massive deltoids for support to thrust even harder. “You gonna take my load you little muscle fag? You want this load don’t ya? Need a real man load in that tight muscle ass? Get ready for my ginger juice you little roid bitch!” <br />
Oscar was beyond turned on… Mentally. But physically, he just wanted this shit to be over. He realized he made a huge mistake – or worse, what if this dude had some kinda disease? And here he was fucking a total stranger bareback… “Way to go, you get this incredibly fit muscular teen body that is a work of art and you go and get it infected with some stupid STD”, Oscar thought to himself. And then, as he was lost in self-deprecating thought, he heard the ear splitting orgasm of the ginger and felt what had to be a cup of cum at least flood into his tight asshole. “Ohhhh FUCK! Ohhhh FUCKKKK! FUUUUUUCK!!!” the ginger screamed, oblivious to the idea that this should be a discreet and quiet encounter. “Phew, Damn! Shit!” He said, as he wiped the sweat from his brow as he pulled out of Oscars tender asshole, Oscar felt the cum follow it, and a little bit of shit along with it about to fall to the floor. Oscar quickly spun around and sat on the toilet as the contents of his freshly deflowered ass oozed out into the bowl. <br />
The ginger put his softening cock back into this boxer briefs and zipped up his jeans. He saw the look of mental exhaustion on Oscar’s face and smiled, then he spat a good amount of tobacco juice straight into Oscar’s face. Astonished, Oscar flinched and reflexively wiped the spit from his cheek, feeling a little of the sickly sour tasting spit make its way into his mouth. “Damn bitch, you’re nasty, but one Hell of a hot fuck! I’m down for that again sometime – That ass! FUCK!” He exclaimed as he turned and left the park bathroom. <br />
Meanwhile, Oscar just sat on the toilet, allowing the remaining cum and shit to run into the bowl until he was sure it was all gone. All the while, he questioned what the Hell he had just done and what he was going to do now going forward. The last of the evidence gone, he wiped the rest away and flushed, deciding he was going to go back home and try to figure out something with David… If he can.</p>
