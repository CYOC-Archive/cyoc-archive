<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Saras now Jason&#39;s POV:<br />
<br />
And then &quot;slap!&quot; right across my face. then, Jason&#39;s mom walked right in front of me and grabbed my face roughly. She shouted, &quot;WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, YOUNG MAN? With that hore again! You&#39;re supposed to look after your little brother tonight, and because you&#39;ve been with your slut, you&#39;ve made me and your father late for our date! So march! and get your brother into the bath before I get your dad to use the belt on you again!&quot; <br />
<br />
I was terrified. I&#39;d never been hit in my life, and Jason&#39;s mom didn&#39;t hold back with that slap. I felt blood coming out of my nose, and tears started streaming down my face. Then, Jason&#39;s mom grabbed me by my/Jason&#39;s ear, pulling me up the stairs, saying, &quot;God, how did we raise such a pussy?&quot; She threw me onto the stairs, saying, &quot;Get going! Do you really want me to get your dad to get his belt!&quot; <br />
<br />
I quickly ran up the stairs, not knowing where I was going but not wanting to be near this crazy woman any longer. My face was in pain, and I was terrified of being hit with a belt. I didn&#39;t expect Jason&#39;s home to be like this. I would never have guessed he was being abused.  <br />
<br />
Is That why he never wanted me to come here. I now realized this was a terrible idea, and I could see why Jason was so upset about the idea of me being him and coming here. I knew I needed to survive now, than the fun I thort I was going to have! and that meant I had to get his brother into the bath. But I didn&#39;t even know his brother, having never met him before <br />
<br />
So, I wiped the tears away from my face, trying to calm down and stop crying. I started looking through the doors. The first door was the bathroom with the bath in it, at less I found that. <br />
<br />
Then, I heard a noise that sounded like a kid humming. It must be Jason&#39;s brother. I quickly went to the door and knocked on it, but there was no answer. I could hear what sounded like running around, and it seemed like the kid was putting things away. So, I walked in and saw a scard looking black hair 7-year-old version of Jason looking at me in shock. He said in an annoyed voice, &quot;Gosh, Jason! You terrified me. why You know not to knock! I thought you were mom or dad, and I was going to get in trouble if they saw this mess. And You know what they&#39;ll do to me if they did!&quot; <br />
<br />
Feeling depressed, knowing that I did, even though I had just met his mom less than 5 minutes ago.  <br />
<br />
and It seemed like a weird way to know it&#39;s your brother coming in without knocking, but whatever, I really didn&#39;t want to get hit again. I knew I could deal with other stuff like figring out where Jasons room is, and fixing this later. So, I said, &quot;Mom said I need to get you in the bath, and... she said dad will use the belt on me if you don&#39;t!&quot; <br />
<br />
He looked upset, looking at my/Jason&#39;s face right where it still hurts, and I knew there was probably a mark and blood there. He said, &quot;Jason, I&#39;m... im so sorry. Did mommy do that because of me?&quot; I saw tears in his eyes as he ran up to me, wrapping his hands around my legs and burying his head in my/Jason&#39;s belly, crying. He said, &quot;Why is it like this? Why us?&quot; <br />
<br />
To be honest, I didn&#39;t know why. Jason could have told me, and my mom and we would have helped. Why didn&#39;t he call child services or the police?  <br />
<br />
I knew that&#39;s what I was going to do now! Now think of it. and I knew Jason wouldn&#39;t be happy about it, because there must, must be a good reason why he hasn&#39;t done it before? But it must be the right thing to do, right? I looked down at this small kid who thought I was his brother. I knew I needed to do this for at less this kid crying in to my stumick, <br />
<br />
But I couldn&#39;t do it with Jason&#39;s parents in the house. So, I bent down and said, &quot;It&#39;s okay, Benny,&quot; remembering his name that Jason mentioned to me once. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m going to get us out of here, okay? I just need you to take a bath so... mom and dad will go out, okay?&quot; Rapping my hands around him. <br />
<br />
Benny looked up with tears in his eyes, looking tired and fed up. Like Jason had said this before, but he nodded his head and said, &quot;Do...do you promise this time?&quot; I didn&#39;t know what Jason had tried before, not knowing if he tried calling the cops or anyone before. Or he just said it to him before? <br />
<br />
But calling child services needs to work, because I could feel bruises under Jason&#39;s shirt now, realizing they were bad feeling very painful now. So, I said, &quot;Yes, I promise. I&#39;m going to get us out of here and away from those monsters. Now go take your bath.&quot; <br />
<br />
After that, I walked downstairs slowly. When I saw Jason&#39;s mom, I said, &quot;Um... Mom... B-Benny is in the bath now?&quot; She just looked at me with hate and said, &quot;You are such a waste of space. Your dad and I are going out now, and no food. Neither you nor Benny deserve it. And if you try stealing anything from the kitchen like last week, you won&#39;t get away with it like last week, and you won&#39;t like what will happen, okay?&quot; I just nodded my head, never feeling this scared in my life. It was chilling to see how this woman looked at me with such hate, and new she would be happy to hit me again, and again. <br />
<br />
And after that, she left. I quickly went to the phone and picked it up, realizing things about Jason that I just shrugged away before this night. From the bruises on his face to his arms, to how he would look scared now and then and didn&#39;t want to leave my house, asking if he could stay, but how could he leave his little brother alone here? He&#39;s only seven and obviously terrified! <br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t want to think that he didn&#39;t care for him, but thinking about it, he never talked about him. He only ever mentioned him when I asked, with him saying he has a little brother. Now I knew that he... the boy I loved, let his brother just be treated like this when he was safe every day and night at my house, and new that Jason is just as a coward, letting such a young boy get hit! And know him and me are over when we are back to normal, so, I dialed 911 and...</p>
