<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke had left Raul with the other kids at the locker room when he felt a sudden sickness. He must be exhausted because of preparing the photo session all week. He went to restroom to wash his face and maybe he could eat a snack for the vending machine. While he was in front of the sink, he felt a sudden and very strong arousal. His body was asking for a release and he knew the only way to do it was with a jerk off.<br />
I need to do it. He thought. Just five minutes and I will be okay.<br />
He had the habit of masturbating using a condom, so he usually had one in his pocket for any situation. It was a regular one, average size for an average guy. He went to a toilet and sat. He pulled the condom from his pocket and, carefully, he put it around his dick which was erect since a while.<br />
C&#39;mon, friend! We had job to do! He said to his dick and started to jerk off.<br />
After some minutes, he hadn&#39;t reached the climax. It was taking more time than usual but he didn&#39;t complain. It was a very satisfying experience. His left hand was moving up and down so quick that it looked like a machine. He was gasping and moaning so hard that it can be heard in all the restroom.<br />
You&#39;re becoming stronger, pal! He said and then he felt the climax coming. Here we are!<br />
But the shot was quiet different from what he expected. In the past, his loads had been some drops or a little squirt, but now his load was so full and strong that the condom almost slipped from his dick. The sensation was amazing and he felt like his soul had fled from his body for an instant and then returned to him to transforming in a new man.<br />
This was incredible! He muttered as he gasped. I need a couple of minutes to catch my breath.<br />
He saw his dick had softened again inside the condom and that this thing was almost full with his cum. It was like holding a water balloon. He thought he can&#39;t throwing it away in the trash can and he began to think what to do with it.<br />
His dick was still inside the condom swimming in his cum. His soft size was so small that it didn&#39;t covered the half of the condom. But, after a second he began to feel aroused.<br />
A second shot? He thought. I never had made one before... well, I&#39;m becoming a man, I guess it&#39;s necessary if I expected to have more activity in the future.<br />
He was to jerk again when he felt a sudden shock in his dick. It was like if his whole body feelings were concentrated in his penis and it was becoming stronger and stronger.<br />
I can&#39;t take too much time! He said while he was losing himself. The photographer will go...<br />
He felt a sensation similar to peeing but instead of piss, his dick was shooting cum again.<br />
How is this posible? He said. My dick is soft and I&#39;m cumming.<br />
The condom pumped up even more to its limit.<br />
It will burst! He moaned.<br />
He was holding the condom with a hand but it was becoming so heavy that he needed both hand to avoid falling. Then he felt a completely new sensation, all the cum in the condom was returning to his body!<br />
He can feel the cum entering by his dick head and moving through his penis until reach his balls. He was lost in ecstasy that he didn&#39;t realice his balls were becoming bigger, going from tiny plums to avocadoes. His scrotum can&#39;t hold this growing and it was stretching up to its limit. Meanwhile his dick was swelling too, as it was sucking the cum it was displacing the space which was left in the condom. After some seconds, it was as big as the condom itself and heavy as a big water balloon.<br />
The condom had a few drops of cum left but Luke&#39;s penis was still growing and the average condom couldn&#39;t hold it any longer and it finally busted with a big popping noise.<br />
When Luke regained consciousness, he tried to stand up but the new weight between his legs took him by surprise. His new appendage was like a third leg, monstrous big and heavy. It could be impossible to hide inside his speedo and he can&#39;t go outside naked like that. The only option he had was to wear a towel and hope nobody asked for it.<br />
He went to his father&#39;s office where he had some towels in a cabinet. He had some troubles to walk , so it took more time than what he expected. He put a towel around his waist and took some more in case he need them.<br />
Whit his difficulty to walk he went to the pool. it was difficult because the giant penis and balls where swinging all time.<br />
My scrotum hurts! He said while scratched his balls. Definitely these things are not for swimming.<br />
When he arrived the pool room, he saw that no one was there. He had taken too much time and the photo session was done.<br />
The photographer and the kids were not there anymore.<br />
Luke thought it was good because then nobody would be able to see him like that but he was worried about the photos. Also, the kids were not around and he was responsible of them until they parents came back for them.<br />
He returned to his father&#39;s office and looked for his cellphone. He called the photographer who explained that he had finished the photo session and left the building some time ago. When Luke asked for the kids, he said he didn&#39;t know anything, but then he remembered that the kids were talking about a sleepover.<br />
Luke remembered too that Joshua had said him that they planned to have a sleepover this weekend. But Luke was responsible of them anyway. So, he thanked the photographer and went to the parking lot. He rode his bike and drove to Joshua&#39;s house. He was only wearing his windbreaker and a towel which made him look odd to anyone who look him on the road. When he was arriving to Joshua&#39;s house, his towel flew and his big dick and balls where at their full glory moving with the wind. He was embarrassed but fortunately nobody was around to see him.<br />
He arrived to Joshua&#39;s house where he saw Raul&#39;s mother&#39;s car leaving the place.<br />
They should be here... He thought and parked his bike. But first, I need to find something to wear.</p>
