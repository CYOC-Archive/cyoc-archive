<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finally we approached my house.  I suddenly remembered it was in a somewhat messy condition.  But I had this ring.  I wished that the house would be clean so that Judith wouldn't be put off by its appearance.  As I opened the front door, I saw that it worked like a charm.  The house was all spic and span.  She remarked, &quot;You have a nice house.  You said that it's just you and your mom?&quot;  I replied, &quot;Yea.  Just the two of us.  We get along well, she's pretty young still.&quot;  She then said, &quot;I hope I'm not being too intrusive, but where's your father?&quot;  &quot;Oh, no, it's OK,&quot; I said.  &quot;My mom got pregnant when she was 17.  The guy who was, is I guess, my father pretty much abandoned her.  Luckily my grandparents didn't.  They helped her so she didn't have to drop school, and she makes a decent living.  So I have no idea where my father is.  It doesn't really bother me.&quot;  We both sat down on the couch, as she got some books out of her backpack.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry for asking,&quot; she said.  &quot;I've always had the 'traditional' family.  It's hard for me to imagine what that must be like.  But anyway, let's do some math.&quot;  I quickly butted in, &quot;Can ask you something first?&quot;  &quot;Sure,&quot; she replied.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It's about what happened at the bus stop.  I'm sorry to bring it up again, but what exactly was that snob saying to you?&quot; I asked.  She kind of looked down at her shoes, somewhat nervously.  &quot;I wish I could tell you.  But I don't know.  She was calling me ugly and flat-chested.  I'm not sure why, but she and a lot of other people do.  It really bothers me.  You're one of the first people who has never said anything like that to me within 5 minutes of talking to me.&quot;  Her eyes started to well up a little.  It was apparent that she had been mistreated by other kids for a long time.  &quot;Everyone's mean to me.  They call me names like that.  She said the clothes I am wearing were horrible for me.  I don't dress like this all the time.  In fact, I never do,&quot; a puzzled look crept across her face. &quot;I don't remember putting this on today.  I was wearing something much different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Uh-oh, I thought.  I wished she thought of her new looks as hers, but not her clothes.  Before I could make another wish she said, &quot;Whatever changed her appearance must have changed my clothes!  This is totally weird.&quot;  I said, &quot;Yea, that is really weird.  It sounds like someone is practicing magic.&quot;  She laughed and said, &quot;If there was such a thing.  I consider it magical enough that you didn't find the time to insult me somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then a different look passed on her face.  She looked at me deeply, while I looked at her totally puzzled.  She inched closer to me on the couch.  &quot;Jim, I really want to thank you for being so nice to me.  This may sound silly to you, but it means a lot to me.&quot;  Now I was the one to be taken aback.  I didn't really expect this kind of natural behavior.  I finally said, &quot;Sure.  Uh-I-I'm not to sure of w-what to say--&quot;  She interjected, &quot;Don't say anything then.&quot;  With that she bent over and planted a firm kiss on my lips.  I wasn't too sure of what to do, so I acted naturally too.  I kissed back.  It seemed to last for hours.<br />
<br />
Finally, after what was only about 10 seconds, our lips parted.  She turned her head away slightly, as I recovered from the shock of the moment.  She broke the silence.  &quot;I don't mean to be too forward, but I just feel good all of a sudden.  I feel like a different person all because of what happened at the bus stop.&quot;  No kidding, I thought.  You pretty much are.  Then she turned back and looked at me with her emerald green eyes.  &quot;There's something I've always wanted, Jim, but I've never been able to have it.&quot;  She then smiled suggestively and said, &quot;You don't really want to study math now do you, Jim?&quot; <br />
<br />
I couldn't think of what to say.  I blabbered, &quot;W-well you're the uh-uh,&quot; I noticed she was running her fingers over her ample chest, &quot;the uh-tutor.  You tell me.&quot;  She continued to slide her fingers down past her chest to her stomach and then further underneath her skirt.  &quot;OK then,&quot; she said, &quot;I want you to come over here and return my gesture.&quot;  I did so without thinking twice.  Her lips tasted like strawberries, as if she was now wearing a scented lipstick thanks to my wish.  She then broke away and said, &quot;Wait.  I've never done this before.&quot;  I just gazed at her and said, &quot;Neither have I.  Can we take this risk?&quot;  &quot;Yes,&quot; and with that she reached for my belt buckle, &quot;Let's do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was in a state of euphoria.  Here I had created this beautiful girl, but I hadn't changed her personality or made her do what we were now doing.  It was as if my wishes were coming true without me having to actually wish them.  So I knew this wasn't the ring's influence.  Then I thought, maybe we can have some fun with the ring later.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, she loosened my belt and was tearing at my pants.  She ripped them off and could clearly see my fully erect cock through my boxers.  &quot;Is that for me?&quot; she joked with a laugh in her voice.  And with that she tore my boxers off too and clamped down hard on my cock with her mouth.  I felt that I couldn't be any more turned on, but as she kept on, I could feel myself getting even harder.  Then I felt a thrust coming from my cock.  I was coming.  Her grip grew even tighter as she sucked down everything that spewed forth.  Then she lifted her head and said, &quot;I hope you have some more left.  I'm not done yet.&quot;  With that she backed off slightly and lifted her top up slowly and seductively.  Her ample breasts slowly emerged from their spandex confine, and she lifted it off completely and threw it in my direction.  &quot;They're waiting for you,&quot; she said in the most sultry manner possible.  I looked at them for just a second.  They had to be D cups at least, with large brown areolas and firm, erect nipples.  They longed to be sucked.<br />
<br />
I then slipped off my socks and shoes, and took off my shirt, too.  I then jumped over to her, in order to return the favor.  I took hold of her left breast with my hands, and looked at her.  She smiled and said, &quot;What are you waiting for?&quot;  I placed my mouth around it.  God, was it big.  I sucked away, concentrating on the nipple.  As I sucked she let out moans of passion, and I saw that her fingers were again creeping under her skirt.  I thought to myself she just needed to wait for me.  I started in on the other breast, giving it the same teasing treatment that I had with her left one.  &quot;Oooohhhh yessssss,&quot; she screamed, and I decided that she was ready.<br />
<br />
She unzipped her boots and kicked them off into the air.  I finished my sucking and planted another kiss on her firm lips.  Her tongue found mine and we shared that kiss for another 10 seconds.  Then I broke away and asked, &quot;Ready?&quot;  Still slightly moaning, she said, &quot;Ohhhh, yes.&quot;  With that I laid her down on the couch.  Lucky for us, this couch was big enough for her to lay down upon.  I reached for her skirt and pulled it down off her waist, exposing a red thong.  I yanked the skirt past her knees and she helped me by kicking it off her feet.  I then gave the thong the same treatment, leaving her fully exposed as I was.  She had no hair to speak of there, and I presumed that was another effect of my wish.  &quot;Come onnn,&quot; she moaned, somewhat impatiently.  <br />
<br />
I placed myself on top of her and began to kiss her again passionately.  My cock found the slit that it was looking for and I entered her slowly.  Remembering our line about should we do this, I decided it was best not to chance it.  I wished again silently that she would not be impregnanted from our action.  With that out of the way, I focused back on pleasing her.  My cock was now fully within her pussy, and I began to thrust.  While I kissed her I worried that I had already shot my load, but as I continued thrusting I could tell that I need not worry about that.  As I continued my mouth found its way back to her breasts.  I began sucking again, all while thrusting her as well.  Her moans and screams of sexual ecstasy grew louder.  &quot;Ooohhhhhh, Jimmmmm.  Yesssssss!&quot; she screamed.  Just then I felt myself coming again.  As I did, she let out a climaxing scream too.  We came at the same time.  I slowly withdrew from her as we both recovered from our pleasure.  My cock found the open air again, and I noticed there was blood on it.  Well she wasn't kidding there.  I thought it would be best for us to not make a mess of my mother's couch, so I wished all blood and fluids would not stain any furniture or carpeting.<br />
<br />
We both then sat up and she laid herself across me, gazing up at me with a look that could only be described as love.  She then reached up and took my face in her hands, and laid another passionate kiss on my lips.<br />
<br />
Then...</p>
