<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thanksgiving had been wonderful, but it was only a short week long break and I was soon back in Helena to complete my studies there at the MLEA. Beauregard didn't do anything over the course of the week and it was a pleasant vacation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do well, George,&quot; Molly said to me as I prepared to drive out on the Sunday morning that was the last day of the break.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; I smiled to her, &quot;and I have been. All the instructors there love the effort I've put into the training.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you think you'll graduate?&quot; Molly inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm pretty sure I will,&quot; I said confidently, &quot;and I intend to study hard to pass all the tests... including the Civil Service Exam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear,&quot; Molly smiled, &quot;when is the graduation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a couple of weeks,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want anyone to come to it?&quot; Molly wondered, &quot;I'm sure your Dad would like to see you earn your badge.&quot;<br />
<br />
I blinked at that, but soon nodded. My folks did know I had been accepted to the MLEA and I had told them I had been doing well, but I hadn't invited them to the graduation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have to ask them if they'd like to come out, but I'm sure they would,&quot; I then spoke, &quot;what about you? Do you want to come out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would, but I'm not sure about whether or not I'd get the time off from the school,&quot; Molly commented, &quot;If your graduation is a couple of weeks, we'll be nearing the Christmas break when you graduate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might help you out,&quot; I shrugged from the driver's seat, &quot;let me know how it goes. If it does work, we'll try to arrange something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly then nodded, &quot;You better get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded to her and then began to back out. With it now being late November, there were snow drifts in places and I was driving almost thirty miles per hour under the speed limit in places to avoid slipping and sliding on icy roads.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
That night after returning to my &quot;dorm room&quot; I called home. My dad was always busy with a lot of things related to his own work, but Molly was right, he would be proud to hear that I would be earning my own badge. And if they came out, it would play into some of my long term plans as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Wayne residence,&quot; came my mother's voice on the other end of the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? It's me,&quot; I spoke into my phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;George? How are you doing? Where are you right now?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just got back to the MLEA after a week off for Thanksgiving,&quot; I said, &quot;I've been doing well. From the grades I've gotten back so far, it looks like I'll graduate pretty close to the top of my class here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is good to hear,&quot; my mother answered, &quot;and how is Molly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's doing well, too, Mom,&quot; I answered, &quot;still working as an aide in Columbia Falls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss you, you know,&quot; my mother told me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; I chuckled, &quot;say, I was thinking, what would you say to coming out for the Academy graduation? You could come out, see our home... though you'll need a hotel room because Molly and I haven't been able to buy a real bed for the two of us yet...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want us to come visit?&quot; my mother asked, sounding excited, &quot;that's wonderful!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can easily,&quot; my mother's excitement did not decrease.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about dad?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he has some vacation days for this year left,&quot; my mother answered, &quot;and I'm sure he'd be proud to attend...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you'll come?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll try to, your father is working late tonight,&quot; my mother replied, &quot;but I'll be sure to talk to him about it. When is the graduation day?&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave her the date and heard a chorus of &quot;thank yous&quot; come through the phone. It made me chuckle a little bit as we then said our good-byes and I let my mother return to what she was working on, and I resumed my studying. I had to maintain my grades before graduating.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next few weeks went by with little interruption. I continued to study hard and focus on preparing for the coming graduation from the M.L.E.A. and proving that I could be a good officer. That I could avoid repeating the mistakes I had made when Molly was transformed if I ever came across a similar situation. The grades I got back continued to be encouraging.<br />
<br />
And wasn't the only one doing well. Ahab may not have looked all that strong or athletic, but his muscles were all wiry and he amazed many of the instruction officers in charge of physical fitness classes with what he was able to do. He and I got along well and actually began to forge a bit of a friendship, but we both knew that it wouldn't really last all that long. I would be returning to Columbia Falls and he would be working in Bozeman. After graduating, we wouldn't have much in the way of interaction.<br />
<br />
My folks did call back and promised they'd be able to make it, but when graduation day from M.L.E.A. arrived, the biggest surprise was that Molly and Dave had also made their way down to Helena and they were seated next to my parents as my graduating class filed into the seats. Marion McNight stood behind a podium with a desk beside it. On the desk were several boxes which likely contained the badges we would receive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; Marion spoke as everyone sat down, &quot;friends and relatives, welcome to the Fall/Winter graduation ceremony for those that are now graduating from the MLEA and will join Montana's finest in protecting the citizens of our fair state. Some will be state troopers, some will be game wardens, and some will be city police officers. All should be valuable protectors of justice. And thank you all for your hard work and dedication. I thank all of our guests today for their presence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marion then paused and looked back to us.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will read the names of the graduating officers by their class rank,&quot; she then spoke, &quot;each graduating officer will come forward and will accept their badge and return to their seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then took the first badge off of the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Graduating at the top of the Fall/Winter Class, George Wayne of the Columbia Falls, Montana Police Department,&quot; Marion announced.<br />
<br />
I quietly went forward and accepted my badge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for the chance, ma'am,&quot; I felt I had to tell her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make your department proud, Officer Wayne,&quot; Marion replied with some politely, &quot;you may return to your seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma'am,&quot; I saluted her and returned to my seat.<br />
<br />
Marion then returned to the list of officers.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm proud of you, son,&quot; my father said to me as I met with him, my mother, Molly, and Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations, buddy!&quot; Dave spoke, &quot;I'm glad I could be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a bit surprised to see you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Molly needed a ride, and you had told me to look after her while you were here,&quot; Dave replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he did a wonderful job,&quot; Molly added.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've both made a very outgoing friend,&quot; my mother commented, &quot;I'm glad you have a friend like Mr. Choir who would do this to help you both...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Dave,&quot; Dave told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is the schedule now?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to collect my things,&quot; I said, &quot;and then I thought we'd go out to a good steakhouse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; Molly smiled and pulled me into a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;When do you start with Columbia Falls?&quot; my father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm to report as soon as possible, but according the paperwork, I won't officially start until next year...&quot; I said slowly, &quot;so we should have time for a family Christmas out here... if you have the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds fine,&quot; my dad smiled, &quot;I'm not due back until the day after New Years.&quot;</p>
