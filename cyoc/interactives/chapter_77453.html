<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danielle sat down on her bed.  It had been an eventful six months since Kat had made her who she was.  She'd adjusted surprisingly well, but she still had moments when she realized how weird her situation was.  Taking off her clothes, she looked at herself in the mirror.  At five foot three, she wasn't tall, but she wasn't short, either.  As she gazed at her reflection, she had one of those weird moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a girl.  A woman.  I am literally, in every way, a fox-woman.&quot;  Her ears twitched a little as the emotion welled up in her.  She'd probably never see her family or her old friends again.  She was stuck here for the amusement of her sick sister, and she'd even had her identity and her gender stolen.  Danielle wasn't sure whether it was cruelty or mercy (given Kat's nature, she suspected the former), but Kat had not only made Dan into Danielle, but had also made her very attractive, with long, raven-black hair, a fit body that was neither scrawny nor bulky, large-ish breasts, a fantastic coat of red fur on her back and limbs, with white on the front of her torso and black on her hands, feet, and ears, and a beautiful face.<br />
<br />
And she was also magic.  Kat hadn't intended it, but the family gift still ran through her despite her new species - and the world she was in was also inherently magic.  During her first month, her adoptive parents had taught her all they knew about the use of magic, and she'd shown a remarkable aptitude for it.  Most people here used it in some form or another; blacksmiths used fire magic to make themselves invulnerable to heat, sailors mastered water and air magic, doctors worked with healing and body magic and so on.  It was everywhere.  Danielle had found, ironically, that she was extremely adept at transformation, healing and other life-oriented magic, so her &quot;parents&quot; had given her the option to study it intensively.<br />
<br />
Now, here she was, a lovely woman with a good education, trying to find her place in a new world with a new gender.  The fox-man who had found her, Rick, had fallen for her almost immediately, but was kind enough to put off any advances until she had adjusted more.  Danielle smiled at the thought that she already had a lover, but put the thoughts aside.  It was time for her to play a bit with her magic.<br />
<br />
Standing naked in front of her mirror, she pointed at herself and focused, picturing her transformation.  It was the first time she'd done more than minor changes to any person, so it was a big moment.  Slowly, her height increased six inches, while her fur darkened rapidly and turned light grey on the stomack, dark grey everywhere else.  Her face itself changed, as her eyes went from brown to green and the proportions changed, while her breasts became somewhat bigger.  It seemed longer, but after about three seconds, it was done.  She grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... I have complete control over what I am.&quot;  She was in a good mood now.  Her circumstances really weren't that bad, and this really sealed the deal.  Yes, it was freaky and shocking but, overall...<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I really am better off here.  I'd like to punish Kat, but I don't think I'd give this place up.&quot;  She changed herself back - mostly, she kept the green eyes and only shortened herself four inches - and put her clothes back on.  Turning, she leaned out her window to smell the salt air mingle with the scents of early autumn.  Just then, there was a knock on the door, and her mom called out to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danielle, Rick's here to see you!&quot;  Danielle grinned and ran downstairs.  She wanted to show off her talent for her... well, there wasn't a word for it except &quot;boyfriend.&quot;  When she appeared at the bottom of the stairs, Rick had just removed his boots, and his fifteen year old brother had tagged along..<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, beautiful, it's been too long!  Have you gotten taller?  And you've got green eyes?!&quot; he said as he hugged her tightly.  She gave him a quick kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both.  I've been practicing my magic, dear.  Wanna see?&quot; she asked, knowing the answer.  Both Rick and his brother, as well as Danielle's mom nodded eagerly, so Danielle called their dog, Sam, over.  The little Pomeranian equivalent scurried over happily, having no idea what was about to happen.  Danielle knelt down and pointed at the tiny dog and focused on the changes she wanted to happen.  The little creature suddenly found its legs extending rapidly, while its body grew larger.  Soon, all that was left of the little dog was its hilariously tiny head on the massive body of a German Shepherd analogue, which soon changed.  Finally, its... male parts... pulled into its body and vanished, leaving the creature a female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ta-da!  Sam is now a female Tanian Cattledog!&quot; Danielle said, rather proudly.  Poor Sam looked around baffled at &quot;her&quot; new condition.  Danielle's mom laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor little Sam!  I dunno though, I think I like him - er, HER - better this way.  Not as yippy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; said Rick, &quot;what else can you do?  Have you gotten to people yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you think I gave myself green eyes and an extra two inches?  Of course I can do people!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;In fact, if anyone's willing, I'll demonstrate on them!  Speaking of people, I don't believe I've formally met your brother, here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!  This is William.  William, this is my girlfriend, Danielle,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, you don't shut up about her,&quot; groaned Will, &quot;but she is talented.  Tell you what, I'll let you change me if you want.  I like this kind of stuff.&quot;  Danielle grinned from ear to ear.  She'd wanted to try it out on a person besides herself, and this was the perfect opportunity to do something really dramatic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, get ready, this is going to be weird!&quot; She focused on Will, who began to change at once.  Red hair cascaded off of his head as he became shorter.  His frame shrunk in proportion, and, while it wasn't visible to anyone else, like Sam his maleness pulled inward and vanished.  However, what was visible was a pair of lumps growing outward on his chest rather rapidly.  Finally, even his clothes were altered, as his pants and shirt fused together into a dress that left no question about the nature of Will's changes.  He, or rather she, spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa... Wow, my voice is weird.  Okay, you got me, that's really impressive, especially after only six months.&quot;  Will moved around a bit, feeling her new body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my girl's got quite a bit of talent,&quot; said Rick, &quot;Though, as much as I'd like to have a little sister, you should probably change Will back now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will replied...</p>
