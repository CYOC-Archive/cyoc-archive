<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think... I&#39;d like that. Need to pick up some clothes from my place though,&quot; Miles said, patting James&#39;s cheek and starting to head out of the kitchen. &quot;Your....&quot; James trailed after, squinting. &quot;Miles, we&#39;re.... we&#39;re at your place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy big guy, most people take at least a few months before they&#39;re talking about moving in together,&quot; Miles quipped, smirking back at James who was still perplexed by the bit. He got he was being teased, what he was getting caught up on was one of the issues they would need to be addressing in taking this all on.<br />
<br />
This was not his mansion. He lived in a modest and on the whole limited single apartment. The mansion belonged to Miles. Looking to Miles though James&#39;s eyes were brought down to that perky butt, getting something in his huge body to growl. &quot;THAT is mine,&quot; something said in James, whose chest fluttered, swallowing and shoving the thought to the back.<br />
<br />
Miles was well ahead of James down one of the halls, making the way to his normal master bedroom and into said bedroom&#39;s closet. Pulling out a garment bag usually set up for business trips he got to work.<br />
<br />
Making a selection of a handful of shirts, pants, underwear and socks, Miles had a decent option of clothing combinations for James set up, zipping up the garment bag with a bit of difficulty. Soon as James caught up though the garment bag was tossed at him, fumbling with it a bit before hoisting it over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miles I&#39;m.... I&#39;m still not following. I mean. What are you doing?&quot; James asked, just sort of following at this point. &quot;You&#39;re gonna need some clothes to change into at my place and when we get there we can bring some of mine back here,&quot; Miles said, walking ahead of James in the direction of the garage. Miles though pivoted and pointed him back to the room. &quot;Much as I love the look you&#39;re gonna need something else to wear out.&quot;<br />
<br />
James halted, looking down to see his &#39;Kiss the Cook&#39; apron still covering his front, blushing and nodding and heading back to the bedroom. He&#39;d gone there with the intent of getting dressed for going out but stopped to survey it in comparison to the established sex room he and Miles had been spending all their time in.<br />
<br />
This room was considerably more modest with a slightly colder restrained coloring looking comparatively normal. James smiled a bit at the thought of spending more time here with Miles before grunting and refocusing, looking through the closet to find some clothes.<br />
<br />
It took a few minutes but he was eventually able to get a rather casual form fitting outfit together, mainly consisting of a snug workout t-shirt and some sweats. Most of Miles&#39;s casual clothing were workout oriented, as it were.<br />
<br />
Feeling satisfied and unable to keep from popping his pecs a few times in the mirror, James returned in the direction Miles had been heading in. After a bit of walking he eventually reached the garage where Miles was already set up in the passenger seat of one of Miles&#39;s many cars, perking up after seeing James who jogged over and set down in the driver&#39;s seat.<br />
<br />
Starting the engine and plucking a designer pair of shades that seemed to be consistently in the car&#39;s overhead, James got the car rolling and on its way out the mansion&#39;s garage. Miles meanwhile couldn&#39;t help but rub James&#39;s arm before pulling it over him and leaning in, indulging himself on the drive to James&#39;s apartment.<br />
<br />
XXX<br />
<br />
The sun was out and traffic was reasonably lax considering the time of day. Miles was smiling and enjoying the ride, feeling nestled in James&#39;s beef in the luxury model like it was some dream.<br />
<br />
James was taking to being the driving force for this interval, big enough to have his arm around Miles and keep a hand on the wheel while having an elbow out the window, looking like some jet setting stud with a hot date out for a Sunday drive.<br />
<br />
Needless to say the two in the car got a few stares while pulling in to the garage for James&#39;s apartment. They&#39;d need a pass for the day, and James went over how it&#39;d probably be smoother to just register one of Miles&#39;s cars under his name, not having one of his own in the lot.<br />
<br />
Walking the halls and getting recognized by neighbors, James fumbled on occasion with greeting them first while introducing himself as James&#39;s boyfriend. Miles, still adjusting to both the relationship and keeping up being James, went increasingly pink with everyone congratulating his scoring to the side after meeting the two. His head was somewhere between getting to hear his old body get complimented and being egged on over his cover model of a boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Where he had to assume James hadn&#39;t brought many men home-if any-it was also weird to think of them as being in different leagues appearance wise. As himself, James had looked cute and sexy with that air of innocent charm about him.<br />
<br />
While he wasn&#39;t sure how James had viewed him while being himself, if it was anything like how Miles had taken to viewing James in his body... well. Maybe they didn&#39;t appreciate the exact same features as James probably would have been on Miles 24/7. Or if he had then he sorely needed to learn how to express himself.<br />
<br />
Even in casual clothing he was a specimen for sure, the black t-shirt stretched out and giving a nice highlight beneath every group, making Miles bite his lip while he stole an ogle of James while he unpacked the garment bag.<br />
<br />
James was just trying to be careful as he worked, somewhat reeling when he&#39;d entered his apartment. Nothing had changed per se but it looked and felt different from Miles&#39;s body. He was almost surprised he&#39;d lived there, his head risking brushing the ceiling, making him reflexively hunch over. Dating his boss almost seemed like a minor adjustment when compared to how much he was going to need to adjust to being so massive.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what are we doing with these?&quot; James asked, holding up some of the pants. Miles snapped back to attention and got to work hanging up the different clothes in James&#39;s closet next to his own outfits. After the garment bag was empty, Miles repeated what he&#39;d done, albeit with James&#39;s clothes, getting a few in there. James watched him all the while, making something of a connection.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re.... keeping each other&#39;s clothes?&quot; he asked, trying to formulate. &quot;We&#39;re having a change of clothes at each other&#39;s places so it&#39;s never an issue wherever we head home at night after work,&quot; Miles finally explained, giving James a bit of a look, who widened his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long&#39;s it been since you&#39;ve dated anyone?&quot; Miles teased, James shutting his eyes in a bit of embarrassment. &quot;Sorry, I.... sorry. I just.... this is the first time I&#39;ve been so serious with anyone,&quot; James admitted, scratching the back of his head bashfully. Miles smirked and walked over to give him a kiss, cooling the big guy down who pulled him up in a bear hug while kissing back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know. You&#39;re really dating young,&quot; James finally brought up, getting a laugh out of Miles. &quot;Guess I just have a taste for bodybuilding company heads fresh out of undergrad,&quot; Miles quipped back, biting on James&#39;s obvious nipple through the tight fabric.<br />
<br />
Whatever retort James had melted into a horned up moaning while Miles teased and sucked on his man&#39;s pec. It hadn&#39;t been inaccurate per se though Miles also typically hadn&#39;t switched bodies with any of his more youthful one night stands either, so James was probably something of a special case.<br />
<br />
James let Miles get a good suck before letting him go to grab at his shirt&#39;s lower opening and pull it up and off in a flashy motion, his big beef flopping out for Miles to admire and drink in, the nipple he&#39;d been sucking on now red, stiff, and obvious. James popped said pec a few times like he was winking before going back to the closet to rummage about before coming back with a few of his toys as well as some lube.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... wanting to use some of those on me, big guy?&quot; Miles asked coyly, curling a finger through his hair while pulling the compression shirt he&#39;d worn over off. &quot;Nah I&#39;ve got that seat filled,&quot; James quipped back, smirking and smacking Miles&#39;s rear. Miles yelped and smiled back, in line with James putting on the big man part once more.<br />
<br />
Instead James pulled his sweats down and set down on the bed, getting Miles&#39;s interest while he stripped down further to his underwear and settled next to James who was squeezing his base up. It took a few minutes and pressure and some more of Miles nursing off of James&#39;s now bare pec but he was able to hit full mast after enough, throbbing and red.<br />
<br />
While Miles smiled at his big guy&#39;s cock, James was on a mission, bringing up the toys and holding them up against his hardon. Taking a bit to confirm that while some were close, James&#39;s cock outsized all of the toys he&#39;d had, giving a bit of a self satisfied smirk after being convinced of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know somewhere we can stop by tomorrow, we&#39;ll get a cast of me so you can practice some more,&quot; James said, giving Miles a kiss, who pondered. &quot;For... dicks?&quot; he asked, looking James&#39;s hardon up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ll need to shave but I&#39;m guessing your body&#39;s never leaves anywhere bald for long,&quot; James said and smirked, grabbing and fondling his balls teasingly in Miles&#39;s view. Miles could only chuckle and nod in confirmation, still getting a bit of a rush to have such a virile man for himself.<br />
<br />
James meanwhile had picked out the biggest dildo to slick up in some lube before working down his sweats and rolling to the side to try lining it up with himself. Miles raised his brow, helping him out in spite of not getting what James was up to. &quot;Going by how tough you were to top and what cravings I&#39;ve gotten I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t work on your prostate much,&quot; James explained after being confident he&#39;d started pushing the dildo past.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.... no. I guess not,&quot; Miles said, trying to think. &quot;And you haven&#39;t wondered why getting dicked by me feels as good as it does?&quot; James tried to continue the train of thought. &quot;Because you&#39;re a hunk with a horse cock that could rail me for days without missing a beat,&quot; Miles said, giving James a slap on the ass.<br />
<br />
James grunted and flinched, the slap admittedly helping him a bit with pushing up. Miles&#39;s body clearly still viewed any sort of penetration it wasn&#39;t doing to be alien and if not negative at the very least not useful. It was the first thing it had run into regarding its new driver that it wasn&#39;t fully on board with.<br />
<br />
Undeterred by his new body, James kept the pressure on the dildo while trying to relax his rim, largely feeling discomfort and pain, even with the lube to help. He was only able to get so far but also accepted he wouldn&#39;t be able to go legitimately deep, unsure if the force his reflexes were putting up would pinch the dildo off up his insides.<br />
<br />
It ended up being a bit of a compromise, rolling back onto his back on the bed with the dildo only about halfway past, getting a bit more while on his back. James changed his focus to his cock which he spread and stroked with the lube to start jerking himself off, getting his other hand behind his head while a smile formed on his face.<br />
<br />
Getting his new parts the health and flexibility he&#39;d hit in his old body would be as uphill as picking up all of Miles&#39;s bodybuilding habits, and James wished there was some way to directly converse with his body that this wouldn&#39;t make it any less of a top.<br />
<br />
He knew though the only language his new muscles spoke though were results, the jerking off already starting tingles up the thick muscle fibers filling the man out, moaning and starting to hump up with the dildo firmly planted up his juicy glutes.<br />
<br />
Miles was hypnotized by the display of the sweating shiny beast getting himself off in the small twin sized bed, James shutting his eyes and gritting his teeth while his inner pressure got worse. Looking him up and down Miles had to smirk at the quip of men that had gotten big enough growing a second armpit on their abs, looking there before looking up to the first.<br />
<br />
James was fully spreading out his left upper body while his hand was behind his head, giving Miles a show of his huge arm, broad back, and puffed up pecs coming together in that fuzzed up pit that was giving off a raw unwashed reek.<br />
<br />
Staring for a bit, Miles swallowed before gently taking James&#39;s raised arm and guiding it down behind him while pushing his face up James&#39;s vast and deep armpit, pulling his arm behind the back of his head while he breathed in and started to tease James with his tongue, his whole face being covered from James&#39;s huge and sweaty muscle mass.<br />
<br />
The sharp bitter scent of James&#39;s body odor was at its peak here, feeling like Miles was drowning in his boyfriends body while sucking on his pit. The hair was curly and fuzzy in comparison to his suave whisps he had everywhere else, tickling Miles in the face and getting him to giggle while he drank deep from his man&#39;s hormones and muscles at this nexus.<br />
<br />
James only noticed what Miles had been setting up after it had started happening, reflexively giving a strong squeeze that Miles moaned at, trying to relax for the sake of making sure he could at least breathe but still loving the scrape of his tongue in there, making him all the more conscious of his huge body and its power.<br />
<br />
Between the jerking off, toy planted up his rear, his boyfriend pleasuring his pecs and sucking on his pits, James hit his peak much faster than he was expecting. His cock felt like it was shooting off empty initially before he felt the heat fly up his length and jet out with enough force to spray, leaving his upper body and Miles&#39;s entire body with a layer of hot spunk before the actual ropes fell back down and painted James&#39;s abs.<br />
<br />
This happened a few times until his huge body had left both layered in sweat spotted with thick globs of cum trailing up his torso, the climax taking enough energy from James to let his clamp on Miles go. Miles kept sucking, having been pushing himself in and eventually coming up after noticing the relax in movement to survey James panting and covered in cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clean it,&quot; James said without thinking, his eyes still shut and his breath still short. Miles moved in a similar autopilot, pushing up onto his big torso to start licking up the sweat and cum from his boyfriend&#39;s front.<br />
<br />
James brought his hand down to stroke Miles&#39;s hair, smiling and enjoying the tongue bath while Miles savored the salty sweet mix James had left all over his front. The thick body hair occasionally got caught but was largely pressed down by all the sweat and spunk as Miles cleaned off the beast gratefully, savoring every drop coming from this bull he was now bonded to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm...sir...,&quot; he mumbled incoherently between licks, extremely hazy from having been sucking up his fumes for what hadn&#39;t been long enough, wanting to go back to getting drunk and high off his man&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Miles&#39;s lungs and blood were still full of James&#39;s musk and James was trying to recalibrate after the jetstream of a climax he&#39;d gotten out of his cock. As the thinner lighter male lapped up the sharp nectar his top was granting, he felt his large hand rubbing his back in what was either gratitude or approval, too focused on getting more of his man in his mouth to respond.<br />
<br />
The cleaning went on for a few more minutes before Miles stopped and laid out on top of James who readjusted to lay in bed, breathing slow while his cock throbbed in the air, the two men laying together in as much of an embrace they could swing in the snug bed as sunbeams of the afternoon started passing through the window.</p>
