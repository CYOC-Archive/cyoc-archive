<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tristan woke up with a start. He jumped out of Andy&#39;s bed. &quot;Wha--What the hell!?&quot; he whimpered. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Andy stirred awake. He couldn&#39;t help but smile at the jock standing there confused in their shared dorm. Tristan almost just looked like an average guy compared to the hulked out meathead he&#39;d been almost two weeks before. His muscles weren&#39;t nearly as big and bulky nor was he as tall. Even his powerful jawline looked to have softened ever so slightly. He still had a handsomeness to his face, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as masculine as it had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Andy asked, rubbing some of the sleep out of his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in bed with you!&quot; Tristan shouted. The strap on his sleeveless shirt drooped down his arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so we slept together last night?&quot; Andy smirked.<br />
<br />
Tristan bit his bottom lip. He was clearly trying to be angry, but the thought wasn&#39;t as upsetting as he wanted it to be. &quot;Don&#39;t say that,&quot; Tristan warned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t say what?&quot; Andy teased. &quot;That ever since we started rooming together, I&#39;ve wanted to have sex with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again Tristan wanted to be angry. He wanted to be pissed off. The thought of two men having sex was disgusting. Or at least it should have been. Both his mind and body were betraying him as Andy got out of bed. The small, nerdy guy sauntered over to him. The six inches in height had dwindled down to only three. Andy placed his hands on Tristan&#39;s chest and raised up onto his tiptoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always thought you were so sexy...&quot; Andy whispered.<br />
<br />
Tristan couldn&#39;t control himself. His heart was beating faster than ever. A bit of sweat formed on his brow as he tried to tell himself how revolted he should be. &#39;This was wrong!&#39; Yet, his face leaned forward. His lips pressed up against Andy&#39;s as the two kissed. Not just some pec on the lips, but full on tongue. Passion filled the two as they kissed.<br />
<br />
Even though Tristan had lost so much of his muscle, compared to Andy he was still an absolute beast. He easily guided the smaller man back over to the bed and lifted him up onto it. The kiss only broke for a second before he had climbed on top. His body grinded against Andy&#39;s. Tristan was hard as a rock. Harder than he&#39;d ever been for any woman. He couldn&#39;t stop. Nature was taking over whatever thoughts he had as he continued to feel around Andy&#39;s soft body.<br />
<br />
Repetition had given Tristan plenty of skill. Andy hadn&#39;t even realized his pajama shorts and underwear were off until Tristan broke the kiss. The jock raised himself up, looking down at him. &quot;Damn it...&quot; Tristan whined as he felt his cock throb. &quot;Why are you so fucking hot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just born that way,&quot; Andy smirked.<br />
<br />
Tristan let out a frustrated growl. &quot;Fuck you...&quot; he lifted Andy&#39;s legs up over his shoulders and positioned his cock against his asshole.<br />
<br />
Andy flinched. &quot;FFFFFFFUUUUU--&quot; His eyes went wide as his hands gripped for anything they could possibly hold onto. Feeling Tristan&#39;s dick push inside was more than he could have imagined. The intense feeling of having the jock&#39;s cock slide in and out was better than he could have imagined. His hands clawed at the bedding as his body began to twist and writhe under the sheer pleasure his body was going through. There was no stopping him as he came all over himself. A hefty load covered his pajama top.<br />
<br />
&quot;God damn your pathetic...&quot; Tristan smirked as he continued to use Andy as his own personal toy. He was clearly enjoying it as he kept thrusting into the other man. However, with all his experience, he could clearly hold on a bit longer than Andy. Eventually he let himself finish, with a hearty grunt. A dopey smile filled his face as he did so.<br />
<br />
After a little bit of relaxing, Tristan pulled out and then laid down with Andy. &quot;That was better than I expected...&quot; he smirked. His arms reached around Andy and pulled him into a hug. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare tell a fucking person. Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;G-got it!&quot; Andy obediently agreed. There was still far too much of a size difference between the two for Andy to feel comfortable saying anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Tristan kissed him on the cheek. &quot;You keep up this good boy act and maybe we can do it again.&quot; The tone in his voice almost sounded joking, but the seriousness on his face said the exact opposite. Tristan went and got his stuff to take a shower and then left the room.<br />
<br />
Andy eagerly went to the book, excited to make his next change.</p>
