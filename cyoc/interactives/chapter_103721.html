<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Let me just start off by saying totally on board with a little Anderson girl running around the house. The only problem I have with Martha being pregnant is it doesn&#39;t really make sense if you follow the time line.  I mean, it&#39;s been almost three months since William&#39;s death. I&#39;m no expert but wouldn&#39;t she be showing a little by then? Not to mention all the other tell tell signs (i.e. the lack of her monthly visitor). I don&#39;t think she could have gone so long without realizing she was pregnant. <br />
<br />
Anywho, that&#39;s my only issue with Martha suddenly being pregnant. I&#39;ll let someone else make the final call (I&#39;m with TMW on the kid being a girl) and move things back to another arc for the time being. And on an unrelated topic, I would request that anyone who adds chapters to this thread add the (Earth-3) tag to the title - bj88<br />
P.S - Sorry I haven&#39;t been posting as often. School is winding down, got a lot of stuff to take care of <br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Back to Moon Lake’s newest resident…. <br />
<br />
Claire and Barbara spent their morning talking with countless individuals. First, Barbara showed Claire the dorms (pretty standard dorms for a college), and then introduced Claire to some of her friends, now working at the college. <br />
<br />
One decided to tour the campus with them. Chloe Scott was currently working as a teacher’s assistant for one of the film studies teachers. But normally she worked in Seattle at one of the local TV stations as part of the camera crew. <br />
<br />
“So, Moon Lake treating you alright?” Chloe asked. The three were standing outside one of the computer rooms where Chloe had been working. <br />
<br />
“It’s been surprisingly welcoming. There’s still initial shock of the news about weres, but now that its wearing off I’m really enjoying myself. And both Barbara and Ryan have been exceptionally nice.” Claire said.<br />
<br />
“Ryan? Oh, Ryan Connor! Ya, he’s such a gentleman. I’d date him in a heart beat, if only he wasn’t a werewolf…” Chloe sighed. <br />
<br />
“There’s nothing wrong with werewolves Chloe.” Barbara said.<br />
<br />
“Wolves eat deer.” Chloe said flatly. Barbara rolled her eyes and suggested they go look at some of the classrooms. While Chloe ducked into the room she’d been working in, Claire took a moment to ask Barbara what that was about.<br />
<br />
“Oh, some of us take the whole ‘predator-prey’ thing a bit too seriously. More so on the prey end.” Barbara says dismissively. Being at the top of the food chain, she doesn’t see a problem with inter-species couples like that. Chloe on the other hand sees the potential danger in “hooking up with a meat-eater”. <br />
<br />
“What kind of were is Chloe?” Claire asked. <br />
<br />
“White tailed deer. And that’s just Chloe for you. A good number weres aren’t bothered by that kind of stuff, evident in that weretiger and weremink combination.” <br />
<br />
Claire nodded, and wondered what weres were the most compatible for someone like Ryan. Aside from the obvious werewolf, other predators. A bear? No, she didn’t want to get that big. One of the “big cats”? A strong possibility. But first Claire would have to find some. <br />
<br />
Chloe reemerged carrying her backpack just as classes let out. Moving with the stream of students, Barbara and Chloe guided Claire through the halls to the art wing. It was one of the newer sections of the college, having just gotten an update. <br />
<br />
“I take it you’re impressed.” Barbara smiled, watching Claire’s face light up like a kid’s on Christmas. <br />
<br />
“And then some. No offense, but I didn’t expect there to be so much.” Claire admitted. <br />
<br />
“Well, it’s no RISD but things are pretty good around here. Most outside students come because the school’s fairly small, but still close to all the big cities. Most of the income comes from outsiders, so we get all kinds of fun toys to lure them in.” Barbara half joked. <br />
<br />
“And Moon Lake’s a bit more resourceful than people might think.” Chloe adds.<br />
<br />
“Obviously. Where are we headed now?” Claire asked. <br />
<br />
“My photography professor’s room. He teaches all the fundamentals and the mechanics. In addition to the more specialized classes like landscaping and photojournalism.” Barbara said. <br />
<br />
The room in question was at the end of the hall, off to the left. Across the hall was a darkroom, which Claire found particularly interesting. She’d never used one before, what with digital photography becoming more and more common. <br />
<br />
Barbara knocked on the door, and a man’s voice called for them to enter. An older man with salt and pepper hair was working at a computer on the opposite side of the classroom. Once closer, Claire could see he was using photoshop to edit a picture of a dock. <br />
<br />
It was just the old wooden dock surrounded by calm water. But the photo had a certain blue tint to it, and the water especially looked darker than it should be. Made all the darker since the lighting was restricted to the top of the photo where you could easily make out the outline of the buildings in the background. It looked as if there were supposed to be boats docked, but none could be seen. <br />
<br />
“Barbara, good to see you. And Chloe, I heard you were working for Berns now.” The man turned around and smiled when he saw two of his former students. A slight darker haired girl stood behind them, eyes transfixed on the computer screen. <br />
<br />
“Ya, just for the semester. Then I’m back to Seattle.” Chloe said. <br />
<br />
“Uh-huh. And this must be the young lady you told me about. Mitchell Davis, pleasure to meet you Ms. Robertson.” He held out a hand for Claire, which she accepted. His hands felt weathered and worn, but not in an uncomfortable way. Davis clearly knew his way around a camera though. Claire saw smudges of ink on his shirt sleeves, though they were rolled up his arms. <br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you too. What are you working on? It’s beautiful.” Claire gestured to the monitor behind the professor. <br />
<br />
“Ah, I go the majority of the photography for the college. Brochures, the website, and things like that. Just going through the latest batch of images. This one was taken in Seattle, by the docks obviously. Right before sunset. Best time of the day to get photographs. Suns not too high in the sky.” Davis said. <br />
<br />
Claire nodded, knowing that natural lighting was always difficult to deal with. It was unpredictable, and you can’t control it. Which is why Claire was leaning away from anything that involved the outdoors, at least in terms of a job. <br />
<br />
“Barbara tells me you’re planning on transferring from Oregon. What kinds of classes are you taking there?” Davis asked. <br />
<br />
“Doing the foundation studies; drawing !, spatial dynamics and design I. I’m set to take histories of photography next semester.” <br />
<br />
“Well the good news is all of those classes are transferable for credits. If you’re planning on being a photography studies major, I’d sending in a small portfolio. Let us get a better understanding of your personal style, and tastes.” <br />
<br />
Barbara and Chloe sat down at a table while Davis and Claire continued their talk about the programs offered at MLCC. Claire’s fascination and surprise at how thorough the school’s program was never ceased. Suddenly her accidentally stumbling upon Eric and Cassie in the woods wasn’t so awful after all. It was the best thing that could have happened.</p>
