<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The clock on the dash of Derricks old red dodge struck 7:15 as the starts of the sun rise started to peak over the horizon. They had made good time just turning onto a gravel farm road. The road almost seemed to drive straight into the mountain ahead. “Where are we going?” Remy questioned. “Just a bit further. There is a canyon ahead, the road dead ends there. That’s where we will park.” Derick replied. Remy did not reply, she just sat there looking ahead at the changing terrain. They entered a narrow juniper forested desert canyon. Almost immediately the road started to get rougher. Stopping Derrick jumped out and locked in the warn hubs on the truck. Jumping back in Derrick replied with a smile. “Just in Case.” They slowly made it to the end of the road was a turnaround loop resided.  A spur off of the loop was what Derrick had been looking for. Seeing it deserted like he knew it would, he planned his rout.  He expertly backed the camp trailer and pick up into the spur. When he had parked the thick junipers concealed the truck and trailer completely from the road and a bubbling creek was running not 30 yards from the trailer. Derick turned the old Dodge off and exclaimed. “We’re here!” Remy got out of the truck and stood there smelling. “I smell those furry fast little creatures.” “You mean rabbits?” Derick asked. Remy nodded and proceeded to walk around the camp site smelling. Derrick remarked to himself at least she still has some dog spirit. Derrick left Remy to explore as he set up the trailer. This trailer was old, but it was functional. It had a kitchenette dining table, bathroom and a queen sized bed. Just enough to feel like a home away from home. Derrick finished setting up the trailer and laid down on the bed. The sun was up fully now outside and the trailer was illuminated by the warm glow coming from the windows. Remy was still exploring outside. He stretched out and laid there. Eventually he started to think of Remy, and how her long slender legs were perfectly shaped. And even how she was so smart. Eventually he started to feel roused once again. Shaking his head realizing that a certain part of him was rock hard. He walked over to the sink and splashed water on his face. Eventually he calmed down and he grew soft once again. Suddenly Remy came through the door and exclaimed. “I caught one!” Dereck looked over and saw that Remy was holding a limp cotton tail rabbit in her hands. “Good job’” Derick complemented. Then asked. “Do you want me to clean it, so we can have it with dinner tonight?” Remy cocked her head in confusion and asked. “Why would you clean it?” Derick just replied. “It’s going to taste better.” Remy handed the rabbit over to Derick. Derick walked back outside and proceeded to wring the rabbits guts out. He then tore off the head. Remy watched in fascination as he performed his work. He then took out his pocket knife and proceeded to skin and process the carcass. He then rinsed the carcass off in the creek and brought it into the camper. “Here you wanna help?” Derrick asked. Remy nodded and followed him into the camper. Derick handed the rabbit carcass to Remy and proceeded to instruct her on the proper way to remove all the valuable meat from the carcass. Derick noticed that Remy was starting to slobber. Noticing this he voiced his concern. “Remember we are not going to eat it yet.” To which Remy then asked. “Why? Derick replied once again. “Because it will taste better.” Once the meat was separated he placed it in a bowl in the refrigerator. Then he said. “Okay now we will wait until this afternoon to prepare it.” Derick and Remy both walked outside and Derick started to gather fire wood and stack it in a pile. He allowed Remy to continue to explore just like she used to. While she explored Derrick happened across several wild asparagus plants, wild onions, and dandy lions lettuce. He collected these and placed them in a large bowl in the trailer.  Eventually it started to become evening. Derick called Remy over and had her assist with preparing the stew. He had noted that Remy needed less instruction in preparing the food than before. Eventually the stew was slowly bubbling next to the fire under the intense care of Remy. After about an hour Remy declared the stew to be done. Derick waked over and confirmed that the stew was indeed done. She pulled the stew off and set it on the counter of the camper on a hot pad to cool. Derick ladled out several scoops into two bowls. He then passed one to Remy along with a spoon. He then served a plate of the wild greens that he had gathered from earlier. “Here let the stew cool a bit and enjoy.” Remy looked questioningly at Derick when he handed the plate of greens to her. “You don’t have to eat it, but I suggest trying it.” He replied when he saw her look.  Remy sat down at one of the chairs next to the fire. Derick sat down next to her. Derick couldn’t help but notice how attractive Remy had become. He caught himself staring at Remy, but Remy hadn’t noticed yet. Remy had been slowly mastering the spoon and enjoying every mouthful. Derick returned to his stew thinking Keep it together man, she’s a dog. Later when the fire was not but a few embers Derick grabbed a shovel and shoveled dirt on top of the coals. Once the fire was banked he asked Remy if she was ready for bed. Remy indicated that she was and they both headed back to the camper.</p>
