<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lex blinked, and his eyes were now open. He threw off his blanket. Morning light streamed through. He rubbed his face and felt rough stubble there where nothing had grown before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Man, what a crazy...dream.&quot; <br />
<br />
This isn&#39;t my room, he thought. He sat up and realized that he now had arms triple the size of his old ones. That went for the rest of him, too. Maybe he was still dreaming, he thought. Every part of him was swole. His large nine incher bulged obscenely behind his boxer briefs. Glancing at the giant kielbasa schlong he now possessed, he slowly looked around at his spacious room. Car posters. Hot babes on magazines. Dumbbells and barbells. The architecture spoke of an old mansion that had kept up with the times. The wood was stained and smooth, the walls and furniture had a nouveau antique look to them. He had never seen a room so enormous.<br />
<br />
And the mirror with the stud inside it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you? Is that...is that...it can&#39;t be...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lex was in front of his reflection now. He looked like an all American jock. Tan muscles, stubbled face, a big strong jawbone. Round boulder shoulders, rocklike arms, a chest that could list a bus. He had a solid square shaped head. Eyes were glinting. The jock in the mirror wore an innocent expression of awe and wonder. Lex realized that he wasn&#39;t wearing glasses. He waved his hand in front of his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...not wearing glasses.&quot; <br />
<br />
He had the beginnings of sideburns. A face that was both rough and beautiful, savage and lovable. Short dark brown hair accentuated his face. Nothing exciting about it. It looked normal and healthy instead of scraggly and greasy. It complimented his incredible body. His teeth were perfect. No braces. He had an adorable smile and puppy dog eyes. He flexed his arms, shook his leg muscles. Jumped up and down a few times and felt his pecs bounce. Every part of him felt good. <br />
<br />
Why hadn&#39;t he known how good he could feel? He was pumped and healthy and brimming with masculine grace. He had the face of a boy you couldn&#39;t say no to. He tried pouting. Oh, God, I&#39;m beautiful! <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m....so HOT!&quot; My voice. It&#39;s... &quot;This is my voice now. Wow. I sound fantastic.&quot; It sounded almost musical. The voice of a jock who was well liked, funny, husky but not too deep. He sounded like the epitome of charming. It was impossible to hate a voice or face like his. Everyone who met Lex loved him. He was a big adorable muscle jock. He poked at his bicep. HUGE! He realized he knew his arm size was 18 inches. And he was 17 years old. He turned 18 in just a month. <br />
<br />
A calendar on the wall read 2003. What the heck? He frowned. That couldn&#39;t be right. <br />
<br />
There was a knock at the door. Gillian, who was Colt&#39;s mom, walked in. Only now he knew where his good looking face came from. Her family was filled with handsome, strong jawed men and nubile women with good figures. The combination of genetics had resulted in him bearing only a slight resemblance to his former self. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, I need you to take your brother to school today.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Let me just get dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hustle hustle hustle! We all have a busy week ahead! Don&#39;t forget to take this to your coach.&quot; She handed him a permission slip for the field trip. His football team was traveling across state lines in a few weeks. <br />
<br />
Lex got dressed automatically. He knew what clothing he had and he knew all the stuff he needed to be ready for school. He noticed his shoes were size 15. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...if Gillian is my mother now...that means I took her away from Colt!&quot; <br />
<br />
He tried thinking of his old mother and realized all his memories of her were gone, replaced by a loving, fun, smart woman who encouraged him his whole life, cultivated a rich understanding of the world in him. He realized how lucky he was. <br />
<br />
He came downstairs dressed in a green, yellow and white varsity jacket. His father was there. Both of them were taller now. Lex stood at 6&#39;2&quot; and his father Thomas stood at a decent 6&#39;3&quot;. Thomas still had a similar face, his face had changed way less than Lex, who resembled almost nothing like his previous form. It looked like someone had put Thomas&#39; head on a much bigger man&#39;s body. A body that could bench press a few more hundred pounds than it could before. Thomas emanated confidence. His poise, the way he carried himself, had changed. There was nothing complacent or meek left in his demeanor.  Thomas was wearing a suit that cost more than most men could afford and his sleepy eyed face was a little handsomer, more filled out, firmer. His body was pumped. Maybe not to the same level as his son, but he definitely kept in shape and was steep competition against most men at the gym. <br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I wanted the ribbon cutting ceremony catered by Bouquet Enterprises. We have a deal with them. Cancel the plans to use the sushi place. It&#39;s pretentious. We need to maintain a public image for an American company that sells made in America products. Tell them we want classic American all the way. Simple, economical, picnic food that you would share with your neighbors at the park. We want everyone to feel like they&#39;re at a family gathering. And the press better be there this time. We&#39;re creating jobs in this town. I owe it to the community. Are you writing this down?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t shave today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey there Parker.&quot; He looked down at his adorable brother with his mop of auburn hair and infectious innocent smile, only 11 years old. Previously, he dimly remembered Parker was Corbin&#39;s son but now he was Thomas&#39; second son and Lex&#39;s beloved little brother. <br />
<br />
&quot;You look more grownup when you don&#39;t shave,&quot; Parker laughed. <br />
<br />
Lex self consciously touched his stubble. &quot;Forgot I had to,&quot; he mumbled. <br />
<br />
&quot;After four years you forget?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More like you stayed out late again with Vanessa again,&quot; Thomas said, adjusting his tie  &quot;Hey, that reminds me. You can invite her over to study on Wednesday, but you gotta look after Parker. Your mother and I have to go to a city council meeting that night.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can we watch movies?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Something not too scary,&quot; Lex told him. Parker smiled mischievously and drummed his fingers on the counter, which meant he was expecting at least a cheesy monster movie they could make fun of together. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even mind babysitting. Parker got along with Vanessa and was afraid he would be in the way. Time with the two of them was becoming very wholesome and family oriented. Puzzle and game nights, movie nights, reading out loud to each other. Unlike most little brothers trying to be a pain when he was sharing a moment alone with her....and oh my god I&#39;m not gay anymore. His jaw nearly dropped at the thought.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you two. You two knock it out of the park today, huh? Have a good day at school!&quot; Thomas turned back to multitasking as he got ready to go into an office where he oversaw thousands of men at work across various cities and counties. They made concrete and construction vehicles, Lex remembered. <br />
<br />
He drove with no glasses. He had never driven a car before. His father didn&#39;t have time to teach him in the life before. Now it was no problem. A Jaguar. He was driving a 1998 Jaguar from is dad&#39;s collection, gifted to him when he turned 17. It, like everything else in his blessed life, was breathtaking. <br />
<br />
His little brother waved goodbye excitedly as he dropped the kid off in front of the elementary school. A brother. He had a brother. <br />
<br />
Parking at school, he got out of his car and every step he took, he was filled with excitement. He knew his schedule had changed. He was now taking AP science classes and scoring top of his class. He was in metalshop now. Student government. He was on the football team and the debate team. Academic honors. <br />
<br />
He realized, almost with tears, that he was happy and fulfilled. He spent his day participating in class after class. It was like he had shifted to a world where he went to school with entirely different people, instead of the ones who had ignored him or mistreated him or avoided him, but now everyone seemed to be friends with him. And he liked them back. He couldn&#39;t believe how well adjusted he felt. 2003 wasn&#39;t too bad, he thought. No covid. No apocalypse every day on the TV. No jocks and gang members threatening to push him off a balcony. <br />
<br />
Before lunch, he spotted a short, 5&#39;3&quot; kid with glasses and scraggly greasy long black hair. He kept his head down and his shoulders hunched. He looked like he was having a bad day. The kid hugged his books as people muttered &quot;freak show&quot; and &quot;fag&quot; wherever he went. <br />
<br />
The kid passed him in the hallway and looked up at him, squinting and trying to place the handsome jock. Lex didn&#39;t have strawberry blond hair, but he was beautiful, tall, and athletic.<br />
<br />
&quot;L...Lex?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? Colt? Holy shit, it is you. Wow, you look like I used to.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you recognize me? I woke up in some tiny apartment and there was this guy in a fedora who told me I had to live your life from now on! My dad is working at a restaurant now. Dude, you have to get him to change things. I...I don&#39;t like this. Look at me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why would anyone want to look at you?&quot; a mean girl said, passing him by in the hallway, and giggled cruelly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone is laughing at me! You have to unwish this! Please, dude! I can&#39;t live this way! I&#39;m supposed to have a CEO position by the time I&#39;m 30.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Lex said slowly. &quot;I think,&quot; he put a big hand on the puny boy&#39;s shoulder. &quot;This is the start of a beautiful friendship, Colt. I take it that you have knowledge of this new reality the same way I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s like a nightmare. I know this wasn&#39;t what it was like before but at the same time....everything changed and I remember being small and nerdy.&quot; He started to cry. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH come ON. Stop being such a little pussy!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You tell him, Lex! FAGGOT!&quot; some random tall jock screamed while brashly belching as he passed them by. <br />
<br />
Lex found himself laughing. &quot;OH come on, that was funny, Colt. You&#39;re a...you know. You like guys now, I take it. Dontcha? What do you think, man? You think I&#39;m hot?&quot; <br />
<br />
Colt backed away and ran off down the hall, to find somewhere to hide and cry like the little inferior gamma male he now was.  Colt proceeded to the lunch room where all the popular kids were waiting for him...</p>
