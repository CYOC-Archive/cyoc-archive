Report written by Dr Howard Mendez; Independent Assignment Regarding Entity #7612<br />

<br />
———<br />
<br />
William (aged 42) sits on his sofa at 6:59pm on a Wednesday evening. He is seated beside his wife Jane (aged 40), and his daughter, Miranda (aged 14). William’s older son, Thompson (aged 16) was assumed to be upstairs playing video games.<br />
<br />
William had gotten up from the sofa, leaving his wife and daughter to watch the television together. He was preparing dinner (his memory fades as to what he was preparing) for the four in the household.<br />
“Miranda,” William said to his daughter, who looked him in the eyes (Jane also looked at his), “can you go upstairs and tell your brother Dinner will be ready in five minutes,” William asked, politely.<br />
“Sure,” Miranda replied, politely. She hopped off the sofa and made her way up the stairs.<br />
<br />
William continued to prepare the food when he heard a quick three knocks at the door,<br />
“I got it,” Jane said, lifting herself off of the sofa.<br />
William didn’t expect anything out of the ordinary, perhaps a neighbour or one of Thompson’s friends.<br />
William had not been watching as Jane opened the door, and she was just out of sight from where he was standing. William was surprised when Jane opened the door and closed it a few seconds later, not coming back inside the house.<br />
<br />
William could hear Jane speaking to someone, the voice being masculine and deep. William did not assume an affair, but was intrigued by why she closed the door behind her.<br />
More than three minutes had passed, William could still hear Jane’s voice, so he did not assume she was in any kind of danger. Miranda came down the stairs, followed by her older brother. Thompson had a baggy sweater on, but was in a good mood. Both children helped lay out the table, seating themselves. <br />
William was about to serve the dinner, when he heard a large growl from outside the front of the house. Jane was no longer talking.<br />
Both children had heard the noise and were looking to the door.<br />
William calmly assured the children their mother was okay, and made his way to the front door. He opened it and felt immense terror as he stared at what was there.<br />
<br />
In front of him was a figure of pure power that vaguely resembled his wife.<br />
She was over eight feet tall with dark red skin. She had two long horns protruding from her forehead and large vampire-like teeth poking from her mouth, with pointed ears that were quite a lot larger. Her whole body was thicker and much more muscular. Her waist was twice the size with very prominent and strong abs. Her breasts were twice the size of her head and very full. Her arms had multiplied twice, leaving her with six incredibly large and muscular arms. Her legs were also very muscular, but she still had two of them. Her toenails and fingernails were very long and pointed. Her hair was very bushy and long, changing from her normal blonde hair to a charcoal black.<br />
<br />
William knew it was his wife, but his instinct was to grab his children to protect them. Jane, or what was formerly referred to as Jane, started chasing after her husband, bending down to get under the door.<br />
William tried to get to his children, but was unable to as the creature grabbed his foot, pulling him into the air. She roared at him, seemingly trying to talk to him.<br />
Thompson had already begun calling the police and was in the process of getting his sister out of the back door of the house, away from the demon monster. The creature seemed to become incredibly sad as she watched the children run away. She roared at William again, definitely trying to communicate.<br />
<br />
William took a deep breath and asked her to put him down, she complied. Her eyes were filling with tears, roaring again. William shushed her, comforting her. He was sure this was his wife, transformed into a beast by some means,<br />
“How did this happen?” William asked her, she knew she couldn’t reply. She leant backwards and grabbed the box, dropping it into William’s hands, “this?” He asked. She looked frustrated, he knew his wife never liked being doubted. This was definitely Jane.<br />
<br />
William tried to open the box, but was unable to, even with his strength. Jane grabbed the box from his, trying to pull it open with her much stronger arms, but even she was unable to. The box didn’t appear to even have a scratch after this either.<br />
<br />
Before Jane could further to try to explain her situation, an unfamiliar siren was heard from the front of the home. Instead of the police, a few trucks had appeared out of nowhere, all with a large logo that read ‘G.E.T.’, which neither Willian nor Jane recognised.<br />
A man stepped out of the truck, and could see the calm nature of the demonic beast, and chose to approach it calmly. Then he spotted William,<br />
“You there,” the man said, his voice sounded like it was from the 1920’s, despite his body only looking younger than Williams, “the human,” he said. <br />
William looked at Jane, who looked at him, both worried.<br />
“Yes… sir,” William said, approaching the man,<br />
“Have you any idea what this is?” The man asked,<br />
“I believe…” he hesitates, but continues, “this creature is my wife.”<br />
<br />
The man scans Jane up and down, then looked back to William, “we’re going to have to bring with us,” the man stated,<br />
“Just her?” William asked, Jane looking worried,<br />
“Both of you, and your children.”<br />
“Can you fix her?” William asked, making sure his wife can be saved,<br />
“Perhaps,” the man said, “but we don’t understand what has changed her. We don’t know what power she possesses,” he clears his throat, “but we will try,” the man finished. He turns away, walking back to the truck. The back of the truck opens, it looks large enough to fit Jane, William, and maybe even the two children.<br />
<br />
William leads Jane to the truck, sitting her down in the centre of the room-sized back.<br />
William finds his children with other G.E.T. Personnel, who follow him into the truck. They are apprehensive at first, but William explains that the monster is their mother, and that these people should help her get back to normal. He asks them to join him with her to make her feel calmer.<br />
<br />
As the trucks are about to leave, William realises something,<br />
“Hold on!” He says, rushing back to the house. He picks up the small wooden box from the ground. As he exits the house, a personnel stops his, asking him not to bring any personal belongings, but he explains that the box is what he thinks caused the transformation. <br />
He is quickly surrounded by G.E.T. Personnel as they quarantine the box and place it in a completely different truck.<br />
<br />
Then the trucks lead of, the family watching as their family fades off into the distance.<br />
<br />

Written Log : Notes from Author : Howard Mendez<br />
<br />
This was the first instance of Entity #7612 being utilised in a public setting that resulted in G.E.T. being alerted to the situation.<br />
As of present day, we have yet to locate the individual(s) who placed Entity #7612-1 within the Jell household. Various security tapes and witness statements have confirmed that it was placed deliberately, but the motivations of such person(s) have yet to be discovered. As of right now, the identity of the individual(s) are not being actively looked out for, but the case is yet to be forgotten and will be pursued at a later date.<br />
As of now, Entity #7612 is being researched for origin and tested for the limit of it’s power.<br />
The Jell household (excluding Jane) has been relocated to a safe, G.E.T. monitored site where they are living peacefully, with active communication with us under an NDA that forbids them from telling anyone about the organisation.<br />
<br />
Jane Jell (Entity #7612-3) is still in containment, but consideration for her release is being negotiated as her transformation has been significantly decreased.<br />
‘G.E.T. LOG — Entity #7612-3 (File 2)’ will recap Jane Jell’s current status, and should detail her release conditions.<br />
