<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Lauren left, Aaron pulled on some of her clothes and ran out the door.  He followed her from a distance, covertly shadowing her.<br />
<br />
He had no intention of staying this way.  Now that he had the ring, he could switch back with her, whether she liked it or not.  But he had to be sneaky.  She was much stronger than him now. <br />
<br />
Lauren went to the gym.  Aaron was not surprised.  It was where she spent most of her time as a female.  She probably wanted to test out her new body on the gym equipment. Aaron followed her in and watched her work out.  He found himself getting excited as he watched.  He looked away, but found himself staring at other strong men as they worked out.  They were appealing to him, enticing.  He couldn&#39;t stop himself from ogling their beautiful, sweaty hard muscular bodies.<br />
<br />
The first thing I need to do is get rid of this strange obsession with men, thought Aaron.<br />
<br />
He looked back towards Lauren, and saw that she had left.  He spotted her entering the men&#39;s locker room.<br />
<br />
Shit, thought Aaron.  I can&#39;t go in there.  I can barely control myself out here.  I should probably just leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, sexy, &quot; said a voice behind him.  <br />
<br />
He turned, ready to give the jackass a piece of his mind.  He was surprised to find a woman standing behind him.  A beautiful woman.  She was tall with a statuesque model&#39;s figure.  She had moderately sized breasts, and a nice toned athletic body.  She obviously worked out a lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna get something to eat?  Maybe some place private?&quot; said the woman.<br />
<br />
Aaron was shocked.  The woman was hitting on him!  He quickly realized she was a lesbian.  He stared at her and began to get an idea.<br />
<br />
Yes, this might work, he thought.  I can switch just a few things with her.  I can at least get back my height.  And maybe get rid of this nagging desire for men.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t realize you were not interested in women.  I won&#39;t bother you, &quot; said the woman.<br />
<br />
Aaron realized he must have been staring mutely at her for an embarrassingly long time.  She must have gotten the wrong impression.  He reached forward, and grabbed her arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no. I am sorry.  I was just a little shocked.  I have never been approached by someone as beautiful as you, &quot; said Aaron.<br />
<br />
The woman smiled.  &quot;Thanks, but I find that hard to believe.  You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.  I was a little unsure of your orientation.  You seemed to be staring an awful lot at those men.  But you carry yourself like a man, so I figured ....&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron shrugged. &quot;Well, you were right.  And I am glad.  But how about we have that meal at your place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, &quot; said the woman. &quot;My dates usually aren&#39;t that forward.  And I usually don&#39;t do that kind of thing on a first date. But there is something special about you. I can feel it.  Let&#39;s go.  My name is Samantha, by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Erin. Pleased to meet you,  &quot; said Aaron.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Inside Sam&#39;s apartment, Aaron was beginning to get cold feet.  He had only been with Lauren before.  This felt wrong.  <br />
<br />
But you aren&#39;t going to have sex, thought Aaron.  Just a few slight changes, then you are out of here.  A little bit of her attraction to females, a few inches of height, then out the door.<br />
<br />
Sam emerged from her bathroom in a sleek tight black negligee.  Aaron noted with some disappointment that he felt no sexual attraction to her body.<br />
<br />
But that will change soon, he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to change into something more comfortable?  I have some spare clothes you can wear.  They will probably be too big for you, but that shouldn&#39;t be a problem for what we intend to do, &quot; said Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw, I&#39;ll just go au natural, &quot; said Aaron, as he stripped out of his clothes.<br />
<br />
Sam gasped.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So bold.  And so beautiful.  Even sexier than I had imagined, &quot; said Sam, as she ran her hands along Aaron&#39;s chest.  <br />
<br />
Aaron still felt nothing for her.  When she didn&#39;t get the desired response, she tweaked Aaron&#39;s nipples, teasing them in her fingers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get into bed, &quot; said Sam seductively.<br />
<br />
Sam threw Aaron on the bed.  She continued to massage his breasts, but his nipples remained inert.  She began to lick them, teasing them with her tongue. But he still remained unresponsive.  Aaron could see her growing frustration.<br />
<br />
Well, here goes nothing, thought Aaron.  He concentrated, and wished to gain some of her sexual orientation, her desire for women.  He felt his mind changing, and his pleasure growing.  His nipples jumped to attention, and became erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, looks like somebody is getting excited. I must be doing something right.  I was beginning to think you weren&#39;t really into women, &quot; said Sam.  She began to trace her tongue down his body, trailing it past his stomach and resting on his clit.  She began to lick his cunt earnestly.  <br />
<br />
Aaron was in absolute heaven.  But he wanted more.  He wanted her to excite him more.  He felt his mind continue to change, growing more excited at the thought of sex with women.  All kinds of women.  With long sexy legs, smooth skin, sensitive clits, tight cunts, large breasts.  We wanted them all.  He wanted it all.  His whole body was on fire as it started to change again.<br />
<br />
Sam felt funny.  First, she began to find this girl more unappealing.  She had the sudden strange urge for cock, something she hadn&#39;t felt since she experimented with men in her college days. But now it had returned with a vengeance.  She wondered why she was even giving this girl oral pleasure.  Then her body started to feel weird.  Her skin felt strange, and her breasts tingled.  The hairs on her arms stood up, and they appeared to be getting thicker. Her clit felt engorged, like it was bursting past her vaginal lips.  She was about to stop fucking the girl, when suddenly her mind shifted.  She found the girl incredibly attractive again.  She was so feminine, so womanly.  Her cunt was so delicious.  Sam felt the sudden urge to pound her, to grind her groin into hers.  She lifted her enlarged clit, and slid it into her pussy.  It was so tight, and her clit exploded with pleasure as it slid in and out of her cunt.<br />
<br />
Aaron felt something penetrating him, and realized something was wrong.  He looked down, and saw a skinny tall man driving his dick into him.  Aaron&#39;s excitement soon withered.  He liked women, not men.  He backed away from the man, scooting his butt across the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, who are you?  Where is Sam?&quot; asked Aaron.  His voice was even higher and softer now.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?  I am Sam, &quot; said the man.  His voice was squeaky, like a boy going through puberty.<br />
<br />
Sam realized something was wrong now, too.  She looked down and saw a small dick and pair of testicles where her vagina used to be.  Her body was more masculine, and covered in hair.  She looked angrily at Aaron.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done to me?  What have you done to me?&quot; yelled Sam, as she shook Aaron&#39;s arm painfully.<br />
<br />
Aaron was scared.  He hadn&#39;t intended to turn the woman into a man.  But he had just gotten lost in his desire.  Now she was attacking him.  And he could think of only one thing to do to defend himself.  He concentrated, and focused on gaining her height.<br />
<br />
Sam rapidly shrank down to 5 ft 4 inches, while Aaron shot up to 6 feet. Sam freaked out, frightened by the new changes in her body.  She didn&#39;t want to become a midget.  She let go of Aaron, and ran out of the room.<br />
<br />
Aaron gathered up some of Sam&#39;s clothes and quickly put them on.  He was the right height, but his waist was much thinner, his hips were much wider, and his breasts were much larger.  It was not  good fit.  But it was enough to at least keep him covered while he escaped.<br />
<br />
Aaron silently cursed himself as he fled.  Now not only was he more feminine, but thanks to Sam&#39;s desire for women, he now desired to be more feminine.  He didn&#39;t know if his subconscious would even allow him to wish to become male again. He decided to head to Lauren&#39;s house before he made anything worse.  He prayed that he didn&#39;t get sidetracked along the way.</p>
