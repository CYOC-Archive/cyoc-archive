<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later that day, Matthew was in the gym. He trained very hard; in only the 8th grade, he <br />
was already 190lbs of lean muscle. Most people thought he was a young-looking adult. <br />
As he curled the 90 pound weight, his biceps engorged with blood and power. He <br />
remembered beating the shit out of that little fucker John earlier, which only gave Matt <br />
more motivation to pump up his muscles bigger and stronger. <br />
<br />
After his twentieth rep, Matthew stopped to take a break. Working out always made him <br />
hard. He loved being a stud, a real man with big muscles. Real men don't pick on little <br />
guys. Real men only fight to protect, and when they fight, they don't stop until the fucker <br />
surrenders. Real men aren't pussies like that dickhead John. He glanced in the mirror and <br />
hit a double bicep pose. Matt wasn't wearing a shirt; his sleeves always burst when he <br />
worked out his arms from their huge size. The owner of the gym worked out with Matt <br />
sometimes and let him get away with it after looking at Matt's amazing physique. The kid <br />
had less than 2% body fat; that's only about 3 pounds of fat in his entire body!<br />
<br />
A few older guys were looking at him enviously. Matthew sneered at their pathetic fat <br />
bodies; some of them were bigger than him, but nobody was as healthy. Matt could beat <br />
any of them in a fight if they challenged him. His 9-inch dick rose in his shorts as he had <br />
these thoughts and the stud let a moan escape him. He was about to get up and <br />
dominate the bench press when the little Asian kid from earlier came up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matthew!&quot; Jason yelled, &quot;Here you are! I've been looking for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trying to keep his powerful erection from being to obvious, Matt said, &quot;What's up? You <br />
should have expected a jock like me to be showing off over here.&quot; He lifted the weight he <br />
was curling earlier a few times, making sure Jay knew that Matt was curling his weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're massive!&quot; Jayson gasped when he got closer to Matthew's sexy body, &quot;And strong.. <br />
really strong!&quot; he noticed the heavy weight. &quot;How would you like to be even stronger?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stronger? Of course I want to be stronger!&quot; Matthew stood up and flexed his enormous <br />
chest, knowing that Jay and all of the other dweebs were secretly taking mental photos to <br />
masturbate with later, &quot;I want to strong enough to destroy a truck or rip a tree out of the <br />
earth. I want to be able to break every lifting record that mankind has ever set.&quot; Matt <br />
looked over at the bench press, &quot;I want to bench a hundred billion tons for reps! I want to <br />
be stronger than anyone has ever imagined!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt's cock was now fully hard and bulging out of his shorts. But he didn't care. Why <br />
would he? The men are jealous of his youth and massive size, the women just want him <br />
in bed. He growled as he stared lustfully at his almost-nude body in the mirror, &quot;I want to <br />
be strong enough to lift the planet with a single arm, have muscles denser than titanium <br />
and stronger than nukes. That's the kind if power I want.&quot; He knew most of the pussies in <br />
the gym came, but he was still hard... still rock hard and ready to fuck like a real man.<br />
<br />
Jason smiled at his power-hungry friend, &quot;Matthew, I may be able to give you that power. <br />
Will you please follow me to the locker room.&quot; <br />
<br />
Matt looked down at Jason and whispered, &quot;Fuck yeah.&quot; And strutted off to the lockers.<br />
<br />
When the two arrived there, a few guys were already inside. &quot;GET OUT, FUCKHEADS!&quot; <br />
Matthew roared. A few of them ran out, but some of the ones who weren't done clothing <br />
themselves stayed. Impatiently, Matt picked up two of the fuckers in each hand and threw <br />
them out in the hallways nude. That prompted the remaining idiots to flee.<br />
<br />
&quot;That... was a little harsh, wasn't it?&quot; Jay mumbled.<br />
<br />
Matt chuckled, &quot;When this muscle-dude is around, what makes you think they'd leave?&quot; <br />
He stroked his 6-pack casually, &quot;They'd wait around just to spend time admiring my sexy <br />
muscles. Trust me, I know from experience. They're all fags.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay didn't want to continue this topic, so he went down to business, &quot;I've learned some <br />
magic from a book... a spell that makes someone far stronger and more muscular. It can <br />
only be used once by any person and takes nearly a year to memorize. I was planning on <br />
using it on myself to get revenge on those bullies, but you... you want that power much <br />
more. You're really hot and big already, imagine how massive you'll be with the spell! <br />
You're still a teenager, too! Think of your size as an adult with my magic!&quot;<br />
<br />
This sounded great to Matt, &quot;Good! Just make me as big as possible!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't do that!&quot; Jay hesitated, &quot;I still have to keep you in the possible limits of humanity <br />
before you become another species or destroy the universe's laws. The thing is that the <br />
limits have never been tested before... we could adjust a few things about your body's <br />
anatomy, but we have to keep you human. Also, we have to consider how big you want to <br />
be. What do you think we should do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt sat down to think, unconsciously flexing his muscles at the thought of growing into <br />
a perfect musclegod, a man so masculine that the most macho of men looked like little <br />
girls in his presence. Both him and Jay were becoming hard imagining the young stud as <br />
an indestructible freak of nature. Eventually, Matt grinned and said he wanted to be...</p>
