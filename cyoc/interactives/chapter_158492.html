<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With his artificial body, Jeff didn&#39;t need to rest or grab any food or water, so it was almost six hours before he got a little bored with Chelsea and decided to take a break. He tossed Chelsea into the top drawer of his night stand, her silicone pussy still dripping lube, and looked down at his body. He would have to go out in public again some time, and it would probably be better not to look like a weird cyborg when he did. It was easy enough to form a realistic outer shell around his metallic body, though he wished the shell was a transformed person, instead of just something he made out of thin air.<br />
<br />
It was an odd thought. Had the fusion with the Chronivac done something to him? Did the machine made for transforming living things *want* to transform them, so now Jeff did, too? He supposed it didn&#39;t matter. Whether it was because of Jeff or the Chronivac, he wasn&#39;t going to stop. In fact he already had some ideas about what he wanted to do next.<br />
<br />
Jeff spent some time playing around with modifications to the family parakeet until his dad came home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bud, what&#39;s up?&quot; He set down his bag by the front door and started taking off his shoes, quickly taking in the scene downstairs. &quot;Where&#39;s your mom and Chelsea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Chelsea went out with some friends,&quot; said Jeff. &quot;Mom&#39;s taking a...&quot; He paused. &quot;Actually, why am I doing this. Here, I want to show you something.&quot; There&#39;s no need to bother lying, Jeff realized; he had all the power here, and it&#39;s not like his dad was going to be a person much longer anyway.<br />
<br />
His dad was puzzled as Jeff led him upstairs, but turned into naked shock and confusion when he stepped into Jeff&#39;s room and saw the pussy and buttocks sticking out of the wall. He was even more puzzled when Jeff took out a fleshlight from his night stand. And when Jeff explained, and gave his dad a glimpse of the anguished minds of his wife and daughter trapped in these forms, he became both furious and terrified. He gave his dad some time to vent, to yell, to insult him---Jeff had heard something similar from Chelsea herself not long ago, and guessed it wouldn&#39;t be the last time someone lashed out at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change them back,&quot; screamed his dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a good guy, dad, but you don&#39;t tell me what to do now. I won&#39;t change them back. But you shouldn&#39;t be sad about the empty house or their suffering. You have your own future to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
His dad went pale. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t you dare. Don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For what it&#39;s worth, you&#39;re a good dad, and this isn&#39;t revenge for anything you&#39;ve done wrong.&quot; He flicks his hand and his dad&#39;s clothes are gone. &quot;It&#39;s not about making you suffer, though you will. It&#39;s about being put to use.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another gesture, and his dad is shoved to his knees by an invisible force, and his hands forced to his ankles, which meld together. Then his legs fuse together. Dad gives him a pleading, defeated look before his face, except for his mouth, is smoothed over and his entire head recedes into his shoulders, his whole form shrinking except for his inexplicably erect cock. His mouth, his only remaining facial feature, slides down his back somewhere. He has no idea what&#39;s happening to him now, except that he can feel all his bones soften into something flexible, and is startled when suddenly he realizes he can taste the bedroom carpet through his penis. His arms and legs have become flexible loops, and his cock now feels like an impossibly massive part of him; meanwhile his mouth, wherever it is, opens and fills up, somehow pushing his tongue out onto the surface of his body. The slight pleasure he feels through his penis as it shifts against the floor during his transformation abruptly stops, and is replaced by a sensation of unbearable pressure at even gentle motions. Finally, whatever was happening stops.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Once his dad&#39;s transformation was done, Jeff called his friend Laurel, and got her to come over once she was done with dinner at home. Laurel was a pretty, unambiguously queer girl with a bright green pixie cut on the school&#39;s lacrosse team, and Jeff had not been able to figure out for a long time why she was friends with him. They seemed to run in different circles, and didn&#39;t even have the same taste in movies and music. But she had seen it in him before he had seen it in her, and she was the first to remark aloud to him, when they were checking out the same girl at the mall, that she wished she could turn the girl into a dildo, use her once, and leave her alone in the closet. They had, it turned out, similar tastes in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out, this is your mom?&quot; They were in Jeff&#39;s bedroom. &quot;And she&#39;s fully conscious like this?&quot; She stuck her finger into the pussy mounted on the wall. It was slick and warm and twitched a bit trying to expel her. She grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re actually connected, so they can feel what the other does.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you hear them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did at first, but then I thought, what&#39;s the point of turning them into objects if I&#39;m going to know all about their feelings? I haven&#39;t paid any attention to them since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of me feels like I should object to this on feminist grounds, but it&#39;s way too hot. Ugh, I&#39;m so jealous of you.&quot; She slid her fingers out of Jeff&#39;s mom/the lube dispenser. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d be willing to do some favors for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned. &quot;Way ahead of you.&quot; He threw back the blankets on his bed to reveal some sort of one-piece, electric blue rubber strap-on harness and dildo, complete with dangling semi-realistic balls. It wasn&#39;t a series of awkward straps like many harnesses, but more a pair of rubber underwear with a dick attached. Laurel excitedly picked it up, noticing and poking at the soft blue rubber tongue on the inside. &quot;It&#39;s my dad. Do you like him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That color! I&#39;m a little worried about this design, though. Won&#39;t the weight of the cock just pull this off me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;ll cling to you when you&#39;re wearing it, so you can use it like an extension of your body. His tongue, which can still taste, will automatically start going when there&#39;s a pussy against it. You&#39;ll be able to feel through the cock as if it&#39;s your own; my dad, however, can&#39;t ever feel any pleasure. In fact any pressure on it is pretty unpleasant for him. Plus he can taste through that, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, this is fantastic! I don&#39;t know what to say!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I haven&#39;t got to the best part yet!&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The next weekend, Laurel was making out with Carol on the couch of the woman&#39;s small apartment. Or was it Cheryl? They&#39;d met at a party that Carol, at 25, was kind of too old to be at. Certainly too old to be into Laurel, but the two had hit it off. Cheryl was so pretty with her dark eye makeup and a slightly retro peach dress. Maybe her name was Kathy.<br />
<br />
They kissed deeply, Laurel&#39;s hand down the older woman&#39;s pants, three fingers inside her. Carol frantically worked off her pants, and then helped get Laurel&#39;s off using her feet, trying to avoid Laurel having to take out her fingers. She did anyway briefly, to position her pussy over Carol&#39;s face, and went back to fingering her while the woman lapped at her wet pussy. After a few minutes of this, Laurel stopped and climbed off Carol and retrieved something from her purse. A bright blue strap-on.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been sterilized, don&#39;t worry.&quot; It was true, too. She had rubbed herself to climax the previous night while Jeff&#39;s dad was bathing in a pot of boiling water.<br />
<br />
Carol grinned. &quot;Someone comes prepared.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laurel slid it on, the tongue inside coming to life, quite against Jeff&#39;s dad&#39;s will, to continue what Carol had started. They kissed, Laurel tasting her own fluids on Carol&#39;s lips, before Laurel turned the older woman around and bent her over the back of the couch. Entering her was a more amazing sensation than Laurel could have imagined, and she began pumping slowly. She remembers that Jeff&#39;s dad is tasting all of this, is tasting the inside of Carol, while also feeling like she&#39;s crushing his cock. Jeff said his dad had also been made aware of what would happen to the women he entered.<br />
<br />
Carol moaned, &quot;Mmm, yes, yes...&quot; Laurel picks up her rhythm, riding the sensation, and doesn&#39;t know how much longer she can hold out. &quot;Slow down a little,&quot; Carol requests, but Laurel doesn&#39;t seem to hear her. &quot;Hey, a little slower. Hey--aah! That hurts, swetie, please stop.&quot; Laurel rams into her over and over, as hard as she can, causing Carol to yelp. &quot;Stop! Hey, stop, get off! Ow!&quot; But it&#39;s too late for Carol: Laurel comes through the strap-on, quickly ejaculating a full pint of semen into the woman, the overflow squirting out onto both their thighs. Laurel lets Carol atand up, but grips her close and doesn&#39;t let her get off the dildo.<br />
<br />
Carol is crying, trying to struggle free of Laurel&#39;s grip. &quot;Let go of me! You giant asshole, how could you...&quot; She&#39;s distracted by the strange sensation of liquid creeping up her belly. A thick film of milky ejaculate is expanding out from between her thighs, creeping up her torso and down her legs, hot and sticky. Laurel&#39;s arms, and then all of that&#39;s her pressing againt the woman, are drenched in the stuff as it continued to spread outward from her crotch. &quot;What is this? What&#39;s happening??&quot;<br />
<br />
As it creeps over Carol&#39;s breasts, Laurel leans close to her ear. &quot;You know, I never did remember your name.&quot; It is up to Carol&#39;s face and rushes into her mouth, growing to fill it with a thick puddle of semen, and soon it covers her head and there&#39;s not an uncoated inch of her body. Once that happens, the change is almost instantaneous: with a loud slosh, Carol&#39;s form collapses into a person sized mass of thick, hot semen, soaking the floor and Laurel in the process. Laurel lies down in the warm puddle on the hard wood floor, breathing the smell in deep, rolling around and coating herself in it as it cools off and grows stickier. She runs her tongue through some of it. Jeff assured her that though it was organic, it would also be rendered inert, incapable of getting her pregnant. If someone looking into Carol&#39;s disappearance were to test it later, they would find it belonged to someone very similar, genetically, to Carol herself.<br />
<br />
After a while, when she&#39;s feeling disgusting enough, cold coagulating semen in her hair and on her eyelashes and everything else, she retrieves the real prize. Shoved to the side of the puddle by her wallowing is a thick black dildo, in the smoothed, stylized shape of a feminine human figure.<br />
<br />
Carol, still conscious inside, is still mostly trying to figure out why she can&#39;t move, something she very much wants to do now that Laurel is some kind of giantess holding her in one hand. Coated in cum herself, she can&#39;t see very well, and she can&#39;t seem to even blink it out of her eyes. &quot;Jeff said you&#39;ll be able to hear me for a couple of hours in case I wanted to rub this in.&quot; Laurel carries the dildo over to the bathroom, washes it off under the faucet (Carol realizes she doesn&#39;t seem to need air anymore in the process), and holds her up to the mirror. The first thing she notices is that Laurel looks disgusting right now, but then she sees the dildo Laurel is holding up right now and realizes it must be her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s you, from now on. Even if there was a way to reverse it I&#39;d never give it to you.&quot; Laurel starts fingering herself again, mushing a gob of drying semen against her clit. &quot;Your hearing will go away eventually, but you&#39;ll still be able to feel and smell and taste. But you&#39;ll never feel pleasure again, even emotionally. Go ahead, remember your happiest memory.&quot; Carol thought back to the early days of her first romance. She remembered the events, the girl&#39;s face, but felt absolutely nothing except for more despair as she realized what had been taken from her. &quot;Apparently the change has made a bit of a change to your mind, though.&quot; Laurel brings the Carol dildo above the light switch, continuing to rub herself with the other hand, then brings down the dildo to flick off the light.<br />
<br />
If Carol could, she would scream and sob and scream some more. She would claw and fight and struggle to get that light back on, or to run somewhere, anywhere, where there was the comfort of light. Dark was terror. Dark was death. Then the light flicked on again, and the terror subsided.<br />
<br />
&quot;The process makes you claustrophobic and afraid of the dark. Because what I&#39;m going to do is use you once, some time soon, and then leave you alone in the dark forever.&quot; She was panting, about to come from her fingering, and Carol was being squeezed hard in Laurel&#39;s hand. &quot;I want you to know I didn&#39;t have to do this to you. And I could have made it pleasant. And, best of all, it didn&#39;t even need to be you; I would have been happy doing this to almost anyone else. Rough luck, huh?&quot; She came, a small, lazy orgasm. She set Carol down on the counter, facing the mirror, and showered herself off.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Over the next couple of months, Laurel acquired two more dildos this way, these three residing in the bottom drawer of her dresser. Over he next two years she got twenty more, that she kept in a box in her closet to keep her mother from wondering where she was getting so many. Some of them she never even used before leaving them in the box. She gets busy sometimes, what can you do? Jeff&#39;s dad, the strap on, would have wept for these women every time if he could have, but instead he would keep being used to do this to people.<br />
<br />
When Laurel had only four such toys, Jeff was curious to see Laurel&#39;s transformed partners for himself. She only let him see her fifth, briefly, before she used it. &quot;I can&#39;t show you them afterwards. They need to stay alone and scared after that.&quot; She said this in front of the dildo, wondering if the transformed woman could read her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s cool, I get it. Hey, want to fuck Chelsea with your friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, they&#39;re mine. That&#39;s what it&#39;s about for me, I think. They&#39;re mine, only mine. I&#39;m the last good thing they ever experience. They can&#39;t leave me, and once I don&#39;t want them, light is gone from their lives forever.&quot; She kisses the dildo (her name was Sandra, she remembered this time), now really wishing it could hear her, and slips it back in her purse. &quot;We&#39;re kind of fucked up, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, extremely,&quot; Jeff says.<br />
<br />
A buzzing sound and a pale blue light come from Laurel&#39;s purse. She pushes Sandra out of the way and takes out her phone, the caller ID on the screen reading &quot;Hailey&quot;. She answers. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up? Oh, really? Yeah, I bet I could think of...&quot; She looks at Jeff. &quot;Actually, Jeff&#39;s parents are out of town for a couple of days, I bet he&#39;d let you guys use a room here.&quot; Jeff cocks his head, but doesn&#39;t dissuade her. &quot;Yeah, I can give you a ride, don&#39;t even worry about it. Okay, bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hailey, from my lacrosse team. She&#39;s trying to find a discrete place to...&quot; She makes a circle with one hand and pokes the index finger of her other hand into it several times, &quot;with her boyfriend Lyle without, you know, parking in public or in one of their parents&#39; house. I&#39;ll pick them up and bring them back here. You live alone now, right, so you can decorate this place in a style that suits you.&quot; She has a gleam in her eye. &quot;They&#39;re a really cute couple. I wonder if they&#39;ll be as cute together when they&#39;re not people anymore?&quot;</p>
