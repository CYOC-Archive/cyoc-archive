<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You head on into the cool night air, Mason&#39;s penis is practically pulling itself inside of him like a turtle.  You giggle with giddy anticipation, tomorrow little brother you&#39;re in for a nasty surprise, you think to yourself as you walk up to the first neighbor with a video doorbell.  You make sure they get a nice view of Mason&#39;s shrunken penis and even let them see his ass before moving on to the next house.  You repeat this act at eight houses before you&#39;re a ways away from your home and hear the tell tale signs of a party.<br />
<br />
You can hear the music before you can see the people.  You approach the back yard and stop for a little bit.  It&#39;s one of your neighbors, a senior, Ella, you know who has always been nice to you.  You can see a number of people you know drinking beers and swimming in the pool.  You decide to approach, still completely naked.  Ella notices you first, and her face goes white with shock.  &quot;Hey&quot; you say with as much courage as you can muster, &quot;mind if I swim?&quot;  She is shocked at the sudden appearance of a naked 11 year old at her party.  The other partygoers have now noticed and theres some pointing and laughing as well as confusion.  Ella regains her composure and starts to say no, but you jump in the pool.  &quot;So refreshing&quot; you state to everyone, &quot;you should all try it, you don&#39;t have to worry about size because I&#39;m clearly the smallest&quot; you offer up awkwardly to a lot of laughter.<br />
<br />
No one else joins at first until after a few minutes another guy strips down to jump in, waiting a moment for everyone to take in the image of him naked.  He was bigger than average but claimed, &quot;biggest and littlest in the pool&quot; with drunken glee.  After this a few other guys, insulted by the insinuation that he was biggest jumped in and eventually being sure to show off their mostly average manhoods.  The girls all laughed at what they said was a stupid dick comparing contest but they all looked whenever one of the boys got out of the pool.  Eventually all the guys were in but one, Lia, who was teased for being a chicken.  I had seen Liam in the locker room, he always went to change in a stall, and never showered off  at the gym after working out. &quot;Are you smaller than my tiny dick&quot; I asked with Mason&#39;s mouth causing everyone to chuckle at me and him.  &quot;Its ok bro&quot; a senior named Kyle offered, &quot;it&#39;ll grow bigger.&quot; I laughed and told him to get my phone, showing him my older brother&#39;s dick pic, stating &quot;nah, my family are all clit dicks.&quot;  The phone got passed around to all the girls, many of whom had had  a crush on my older brother until that moment.  <br />
<br />
Finally after a lot of teasing, the final guy out of the pool, Liam gave in to peer pressure and started to strip down.  I watched with giddy anticipation, as I felt like I was finally going to see another dick as small as mine.  Liam took off his shirt first, and then his shoes and socks, and then his pants, before looking around at everyone staring at him waiting for him to pull down his boxers.  &quot;Very subtle guys and girls&quot; he laughed as he took in everyone staring at him which got a laugh and then some chanting &quot;show us your dick&quot; over and over.  I got out of the pool and stood next to him, shaking Mason&#39;s little endowment to the laughs of everyone.  After a few &quot;Show us your dick&quot; Liam pulled down his boxers and exposed a giant cock.  The crowd went silent, some girls gasped, some guys even gasped.   <br />
<br />
Liam was a little drunk but liquid courage only took him so far.  I stopped him trying to hustle into the pool.  &quot;Whoa dude&quot; I exclaimed, my eyes not leaving his easily 9&quot; dick, &quot;thats massive!&quot;  I dropped to my knees in front of him, shouting out &quot;All hail, king dick!&quot; Liam blushed as several girls came over now very interested in him.  I got back in the pool with the other guys &quot;Wow, he&#39;s a real man, puts all of us to shame!&quot; I said very matter of factly to them all, eliciting no response but some mummers about &quot;size of the boat, but motion of the ocean&quot; which made me laugh.  &quot;You&#39;re girls don&#39;t seem to think so&quot; I pointed to the group of girls gathered around Liam. I watched as Ella reached out and gave the giant cock a little caress causing it to twitch, and making her boyfriend Justin extremely jealous.  &quot;What a slut&quot; he says under his breath while covering his own average manhood, &quot;mine is big too when I&#39;m not in the cold water!&quot;  Several other guys clearly  surprised by Liam&#39;s size murmur their agreement.  I decide to pipe in, &quot;Don&#39;t worry guy&#39;s you&#39;re all bigger than me and my brother who&#39;s in college so you&#39;ve got that going&quot; I say lowering myself onto the edge of the pool so Mason&#39;s dick is at eye level.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah dude&quot; Justin says with more than a little contempt, &quot;you&#39;re family has some real small dicks!&quot;  Everyone laughs at this, it takes some of the edge off of seeing Liam&#39;s giant dick knowing there are older smaller guys out there.  The guys in the pool relax a little seeing Mason&#39;s tiny dick, and knowing they&#39;re bigger than him at least.  &quot;We should all compare sizes!&quot; I saw as soon as the idea comes to me.  A few of the girls jump on the idea, goading the guys into it.  I stand up next to Liam and say &quot;We already know who the biggest and the smallest are&quot; and slowly the other guys come around to it. &quot;Hard or not hard?&quot; asks Justin while he stares at Ella who is still stealing glances of Liam&#39;s manhood.  &quot;Hard&quot; some of the girls state, and a few of the guys agree.  <br />
<br />
After a little negotiation the girls agree to take their tops off to get the guy hard and then they go from guy to guy measuring their dicks on a piece of paper.  Liam is by far the biggest and Mason is by far the smallest at a little more than 2&quot;.  One of the girls takes a few pictures of all the guys lined up from biggest to smallest.  Justin is next to me as second smallest at 5&quot; which makes him extremely mad.  The party then moves inside...</p>
