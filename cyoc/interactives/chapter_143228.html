<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun was barely up when Mr. Marshall heard a knock on the back door.  He was having coffee before going out to check on the animals.  The previous day had been long and a little nerve-wracking, what with the police looking for Eric, and him wondering what Carl would say.  So far, his cover story that Eric and Jacob had gone off hiking was holding up, so he hadn&#39;t had to make a decision yet on turning hem back human yet.  He was surprised to see Carl standing on the porch, looking nervous and embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, hi, Mr. Marshall.&quot;  Carl was big and muscular, but still had the rounded face and peach fuzz of youth.  A tangle of unkempt pale blonde hair covered his head, and his features were a little too coarse to be handsome.  His cheeks turned red.  &quot;Um, I just checked the barn and Jasper...  well, you know.  Jasper is still in there.  So he didn&#39;t go hiking with Eric.  And there&#39;s this big horse I never saw before.  Um, is that...  is that Eric?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Marshall sighed.  It looked like the decision was made for him - he&#39;d have to turn the boys back now.  &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure.  He must have played around with that Medallion after we left.  I found the mare later.  Her name is Bonnie.  She was a champion Clyde brood mare for me until a little over a year ago.  Lost her to colic.  Anyway, I figured I&#39;d let the boys be horses for a while, since they wanted to try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The admission seemed to be all that Carl was worried about.  &quot;Oh, man!  I am so glad to hear that.  I mean, you&#39;re gonna change them back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot;  Mr. Marshall shook his head.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t leave them stuck as animals.  But I didn&#39;t want to cheat them, either.&quot;  He smiled slightly.  &quot;Though I don&#39;t think Eric was expecting to end up a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl laughed.  &quot;That&#39;s for sure!  I&#39;d make sure the harness came from a stallion before I ever tried it!  Jacob was just lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy&#39;s statement made Mr. Marshall blink.  &quot;So, if you knew you could be a stallion, you&#39;d want to try being a horse, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot;  Carl grinned.  &quot;I mean, not forever, but just trying it like Jacob and Eric?  I&#39;d jump at the chance!&quot;<br />
<br />
All of Mr. Marshall&#39;s good intentions to restore the boys today disintegrated.  &quot;You know, I was thinking about going over to visit a friend who has a Clydesdale farm.  I bet he&#39;d loan me a harness from one of his young studs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl&#39;s eyes brightened.  &quot;Really!  Oh, that would be fantastic!  Could I pick out the horse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see why not.  Are your parents expecting you home soon?&quot;<br />
<br />
He shook his head.  &quot;Nah.  Dad&#39;s on a business trip for a week.  And my mom lives in Ohio since the divorce.&quot;<br />
<br />
Every word was a confirmation that fate wanted the boys to be horses for a while longer.  &quot;Then let&#39;s go!&quot;  Mr. Marshall grabbed the keys to his truck and they headed off.  He felt a little guilty about not mucking and feeding he horses first, but the Clyde farm was close by and they wouldn&#39;t have to wait long.<br />
<br />
Bill Blair was a big, brusque guy who didn&#39;t have a lot of friends, but he and Mr. Marshall got along well.  So he didn&#39;t even go out with Mr. Marshall when asked for the load of a harness.  &quot;Grab any of them you want.  I&#39;m finishing my breakfast!&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for Carl to find the horse he wanted - a beautiful black Clyde with white feathering, massive, but curious and friendly.  His nameplate read &#39;Jake.&#39;  Mr. Marshall knew that Jake was a ten year-old champion stud - perfect.  They took Jake&#39;s harness and returned to the stable where Jasper, Bonnie, and the other horses were getting restless.  Mr. Marhsall pointed at a large empty stall by Bonnie&#39;s.  &quot;Get that all cleaned up and stocked for Bonnie, and then clean hers up for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was still nervous about changing this last boy, but Mr. Marshall busied himself with taking care of chores until all was done.  He was surprised to find Carl had not only cleaned up, but had stripped and was standing in his stall. &quot;Guess you are anxious!&quot;  Mr. Marshall chuckled and got the Medallion from where he had hidden it in the house.  Carl had Jake&#39;s bridle in his hand, nervous, but grinning.  &quot;Well, I wanted to get it done.  I figured you&#39;d change us all back the same time, right?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Nodding, Mr. Marshall said &quot;That&#39;s the plan.  You sure you want to do this?  Remember, Jacob said it was more than just changing shape.  When we&#39;re done, you&#39;ll be Jake the stallion, not you in a horse&#39;s body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl hesitated, and Mr. Marshall felt his heart sink.  But then the boy reached out his hand for the Medallion, and gripped the chain firmly.  This was the first time Mr. Marshall had actually seen a transformation, and he stared in amazement as the boy started to swell and change, hair darkening and spreading over a body that became massive and muscular.  His penis and testicle swelled out faster than anything else, but the rest of Carl&#39;s body soon caught up with the immense stallion&#39;s equipment.  Mr. Marshall was surprised not to see any fear or regret on Carl&#39;s face - if anything, it looked like the boy was relaxing into a warm bath, totally content and happy.  <br />
<br />
And that was just how Carl felt.  The sense of mass, of muscle, of incredible strength was only amazing for a few minutes, and then the huge equine form felt completely normal to him.  In truth, a strong nearby scent caught his attention even before the transformation was finished, and Jake&#39;s mind focused on the heady aroma of a needy mare.  The intense sexual drive and instincts caught Carl up as well, entwining boy and horse far faster and more completely.  There was no mix of awareness, no hesitation of the human essence.  Carl had become Jake so completely that no trace of the boy remained - there was only a very aroused stallion.<br />
<br />
Mr. Marshall watched the huge stallion&#39;s nostrils flare, his top lip curling up as he drank in Bonnie&#39;s scent.  All he had to do was let the two loose and he&#39;d have the foal he wanted.  But that would trap Eric as a mare for over a year.  The boys had wanted top be horses, but he was pretty sure they did not want to be one that long.  And Eric had wanted to be a stallion.  Well, that was the assumption.  The two Clydes snuffled at each other and whickered, getting more agitated.  Even Mr. Marshall could smell the mare now.  Bonnie was in full heat and need.  He&#39;d have to change them back now, or let things take their course.  What to do?  Eric and Carl were so entrenched that they&#39;d never remember what happened.  Would mating reinforce the equine mind?  All three seemed so content as they were.  And it wasn&#39;t like anyone could blame him.  The two Clydes kicked now.  He had to make a decision.</p>
