<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There are many untold stories of what happened during the original Outbreak. It was a rather chaotic time where animals seem to randomly become humanoid after drinking some water. Many humans were accidentally exposed to the virus. Sometimes it was a former pet gaining the sapience needed to profess their true love for their former owner. Most often, it was a recently-uplifted animal, still grappling with the new world they had been forced into, who ended up infecting people in their confusion. Fortunately, some accidents ended happier than others, with people meeting their future mates through this unlikeliest of first meetings.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Janine Griffin had been one of many children who were at the Lyre Zoo when the Animalian virus made its way into the zoo&#39;s water supplies. She was by the giraffe exhibit, which was her favorite part of the zoo. Giraffes were so majestic, graceful, and quiet. Janine was a quiet girl who didn&#39;t like a lot of noise, so she spent most of her zoo time at the giraffes.<br />
<br />
One of Janine’s favorite things to do at the giraffe exhibit is feed them spinach. The giraffes were so tall that they could stick their heads over the rails and grab the spinach with their long tongues. Usually, one of the zookeepers were here to supervise visitors feeding the giraffes, but there weren’t any around right now. Well, Janine brought her own spinach and surely it wouldn’t be too bad for her to give the giraffes a snack by herself.<br />
<br />
A giraffe soon approached the rails. Because of Janine’s shortness, she couldn’t see much of the giraffe beyond the top of its long neck. She thought something looked a little strange about the giraffe, that its face looked more expressive than normal. But it was still looking at the bag of spinach hungrily. Janine opened the bag and held out a few leaves of spinach. The giraffe wrapped its long tongue around the leaves, licking Janine’s fingers in the process before pulling them into its mouth. Janine winced and muttered, “Ow.”<br />
<br />
The giraffe paused in chewing and asked, “Are you alright?”<br />
<br />
“I’m fine. I just got a papercut earlier and I forgot,” said Janine. Then she blinked and asked, “Did you just talk?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I’m getting used to it too,” said the giraffe before swallowing, “Good spinach.”<br />
<br />
“But how can you be…” started Janine before she felt a tingling in her finger where the papercut was. She looked to see that the flesh wound was healing up. But the finger was changing as well, becoming a little longer as the fingernail became darker. The rest of her fingernails were starting to change as well, growing thicker before covering her fingertips like hooves. Her skin was changing too as fur was growing out in yellow and brown patches.<br />
<br />
“Uh oh, looks like you’re changing too,” said the giraffe, “You better head over to the gate over there. It’s unlocked.” Janine quickly headed over to the gate, feeling stranger as she walked. She started putting on more height as her bones stretched out. Her shoes started feeling uncomfortable as she felt her toes fused and changed. She soon took them off after she went through the gate, finding it surprisingly easy to walk on her new hooves. More changes were sweeping over her body, like the tail that was growing from her backside, the ossicones and larger ears that were pushing out through her hair, and her face stretching out into a giraffe’s muzzle.<br />
<br />
By the time Janine had entered the giraffe enclosure, she had become an anthro giraffe. There was a considerable amount of bared skin between her blouse and her skirt now thanks to the big boost in height she got. Fortunately, she hadn’t gotten much wider or they wouldn’t have been able to stay on her body. But Janine felt very nervous and awkward. She had to reach quite a bit up to run her hand through her short brown hair.<br />
<br />
It turned out that the talking giraffe also had an anthro body and he stood much taller than Janine. Janine recalled that the two giraffes who were living at the zoo were brothers named Stretch and Stilts. She wondered which of the two she was talking to right now. &quot;Sorry, I should have realized that I might change you,&quot; said the giraffe, &quot;Especially after what happened to Farrah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Farrah? What happened to her?&quot; asked Janine. Farrah was the zookeeper who most often talked to visitors about the giraffes and supervised the feeding they did.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s in the back with Stilts,&quot; said the giraffe who was apparently Stretch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doing what?&quot; asked the still-naive Janine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, mostly this,&quot; said Stretch before leaning down and licking Janine across the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! snapped Janine, wiping away the drool from her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re already a giraffe,&quot; said Stretch.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s still...&quot; Janine paused as she felt a tingle pass over her. &quot;I feel funny,&quot; she said. She wondered if she was turning back into a human, but she soon put on more height than before. Her blouse and skirt came under more pressure than before, especially as her hips started widening out and her chest started to push out. Her blouse last the least amount of time, tearing open and sending buttons flying everywhere as her growing breasts were exposed to the open air. Janine moaned, her voice deepening as she matured. Her panties became horribly tight as her pelvis expanded. It became very distracting when they started digging into her deepening folds. The material soon became wet before they were shredded apart completely. The skirt lasted the longest because of its looser and stretchier material, but eventually her hips and ass tore it apart too.<br />
<br />
Janine felt a great amount of vertigo from her second transformation. As if she wasn&#39;t tall enough before, now she was a full-grown giraffe woman. At 10 feet tall, she was a very tall and curvy glass of water. She hefted one of her breasts, which was easily bigger than her head was only a few minutes ago. The action sent a fresh wave of pleasure to her giraffe vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still alright?&quot; asked Stretch, though he was rather distracted by Janine&#39;s adult beauty. The zoo had been looking for females for the giraffe brothers before and Stilts had been able to prove himself more dominant to claim Farrah after she had changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel great,&quot; said Janine. Now she noticed how very handsome and muscular Stretch was. Her new giraffe hormones were climbing up her long neck and pounding in her brain. &quot;So, what did you say Stilts was doing with Farrah?&quot; she asked in a husky voice.<br />
<br />
Stretch&#39;s cock responded quickly and stretched out to as impressive a length as the rest of him. &quot;They&#39;re doing this,&quot; he said in a low voice before close the distance between them. Janine responded quite eagerly to his kisses and licks, especially when they traveled down her neck and to her breasts. Not long after that, she went from vertical to horizontal as her new mate took her for the first time.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After that, Janine couldn&#39;t stay in her parents&#39; home anymore. It wasn&#39;t that they disowned their daughter for becoming a giraffe woman or having sex with another giraffe. One couldn&#39;t be blamed for an accidental double-dose as was common during the Outbreak. But Janine literally couldn&#39;t stay with her parents as their apartment was just too small for her titanic size. Though new apartments soon opened up for megafauna Animalians and they were able to move to someplace spacious enough.<br />
<br />
But over the years, as her relationship with Stretch grew, Janine wanted to feel a bit more independent of her parents. They meant well, but they still see her as having grown up too soon. Anyways, it wasn&#39;t fair that her parents had to keep living in an apartment designed for giants which made them feel like dwarfs. Janine had thought about moving to Dinosaur City, but she hadn&#39;t worked up the nerve and before she did, the apartments were all bought up. But with this new colony being set up in Colorado, maybe she could get a headstart in finding a place for her and Stretch. Surely the Dinotopians wouldn&#39;t mind a few mammalian neighbors.</p>
