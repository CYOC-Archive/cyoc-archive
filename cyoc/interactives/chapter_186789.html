<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry had initially had a cold shower but then sense had prevailed and he had turned the hot water on. He didn’t enjoy having a shouting match with Alicia. That was how his marriage to Maureen had ended. He didn’t want this marriage to end before it even started.<br />
<br />
The shower was over a bathtub. He put the pug in and when the water was sufficiently deep, sat down. He kept the water running until it covered his body. An advantage of being shorter was that he could stretch out more in the bath. <br />
<br />
He contemplated his very odd looking body stretched out in front of him. Breasts, big beautiful breasts over a slim waist and wide hips above shaved legs and painted toenails. Only the penis still in his groin revealed his true sex. <br />
<br />
What a waste of a truly unique experience it would be if he and Alicia broke up? He couldn’t let that happen. He admitted to himself that he was jealous. She had just been flirting. She had not actually cheated on him. And yes, she had made sure both of them were invited to Alex’s excursion tomorrow. It had just been her little game again. Alex was just another puppy and Alicia was playing the unobtainable goddess. <br />
<br />
Henry also admitted he was jealous of Alex’s big masculine body. A total contrast to his own current form. It had made him defensive and possessive. He knew that being possessive was a flaw in his character. Maureen had called him that frequently enough. He decided he would get out of the bath. Knock on the bedroom door and apologise to Alicia.<br />
<br />
So Henry let the water out. Dried. Put on a bathrobe and knocked on the bedroom door. There was no reply, so he knocked again “Alicia? Can I come in?” Still no reply. He tried the handle. The door opened. There were clothes on the bed but no Alicia. <br />
<br />
He looked around the room. There was nowhere for her to be hiding. She must be in the lounge he figured. He had just expected her to still be in the bedroom. He walked back to the lounge. She wasn’t there. She wasn’t on the patio either. <br />
<br />
He returned to the bedroom, starting to feel alarmed. Only on the second visit did he spot the note. He read it and the alarm bells rang more loudly. She had gone back to the bar! Where that Alex had said he would be hanging out! For a moment Henry saw red.<br />
<br />
He read the note again. “I will not let you control me. I’m heading back to the bar. If you still love me, as I love you, get dressed and join me. I have laid out an appropriate outfit on the bed. I would much rather have fun with you than on my own. It is after all our honeymoon” She said she still loved him! She just wanted to have fun! With him! To prove it she wanted him to get dressed in the clothes laid out on the bed. He recognised them. The top he had worn the other night. The leather skirt she had worn. He remembered how sexy her legs had looked in that skirt. He remembered undoing the buttons on the front of the skirt.<br />
<br />
He could do it. He had to show Alicia that he still loved her. He had to go or else she might go home instead with that jerk. He could not allow that to happen. No! he scolded himself. Alicia would not go home with Alex, that’s just jealousy rearing its ugly head once more. She is only testing him. But to pass that test he needed to go and get her. And to go and get her he needed to put these clothes on. He went to work.<br />
<br />
It was easy enough to get dressed. He now knew how to. First the bra and the camisole. Then he returned to the lounge where in a temper he had flung his shaper panties. He needed them to keep his penis under control. While there he retrieved the wig and the net that went with it. He returned to the room and pulled up the black pantyhose. He was actually appreciative that Alicia had not made him wear her stockings and garter belt as she had the other night. Yet at the same time there was a touch of disappointment somewhere in there as well.<br />
<br />
He then put on the lacy top. That was actually trickier with his long pink fingernails than he had expected. He knew he had no time to waste. Alicia was expecting him. At least he hoped she was expecting him. He put the skirt on. It fitted his waist and hips perfectly. He did up those buttons he had so willingly undone the other night. He looked at the heels on the bed and decided they could wait.<br />
<br />
He moved to the bathroom and fixed the net and the wig to his head. From his handbag he retrieved his brush and fixed his long blonde locks. Then also from his handbag he found his lipstick and applied the pink colour to his lips. He was sure that had Alicia being helping him she would have redone his face and eyes, but she wasn’t and he had no time to waste. He looked stunning enough as he was.<br />
He sat down and strapped the heels to his feet. They were 3 inches and looked relatively flimsy. If he had of had time he would have practised walking in them but he did not. The only practice he was going to get was the walk to the bar.</p>
