<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The adult content warning is more for references to what happened in the previous chapter.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucy managed to relax a bit after she and Zoe finished their transformations and Zoe managed to relieve some of the sexual tension that they&#39;d all been feeling since the present &quot;adventure&quot; began regarding Megan and Jenny&#39;s arrival and making sure that all the members of the Chapman family would become slug people like them. Experiencing a &quot;male&quot; orgasm was different, pleasurable but different, though Lucy also knew that slug people like the mundane animals they were originally created from were largely hermaphrodites and had both male and female reproductive organs. Lucy had also felt this as well, but she was also trying to process a great many things that were hitting her all at once.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing was picking up base feelings from Grace, Whitney, and even Zoe. It was as Grace had described the previous night after her transformation completed. It wasn&#39;t telepathy in that she could read their minds, but she got some sense of the feelings that were going through her sisters and mother as she transformed. The feeling that remained steady was an assuring sense of love that Lucy expected to feel within her own family, and that was a relief as none of it was controlling. It left her mind free of any haze or confusion, which Lucy took as a great sense of relief. But that wasn&#39;t the only thing she sensed. There was also a sense of triumph that was there and not coming from any of her family members and that got Lucy to turn on her tail back toward the closed and locked door to the master bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the Hive, Lucy... Zoe,&quot; came Megan&#39;s voice from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;We knew you had it in you,&quot; Jenny added with her voice also sounding triumphant, which gave Lucy some hint of what had been going on when she and Zoe began transforming into slug women. They sensed that Lucy and Zoe were starting to change through the hive mind that linked all slug people and were trying to taunt or lure Jeff to them. &quot;Wasn&#39;t it fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Taking our humanity from us isn&#39;t fun,&quot; Lucy spoke as she slid forward toward the door and her eyes squinting at the door.<br />
<br />
She had the sense that Megan and Jenny were aimed more at tormenting Jeff and that her and Zoe&#39;s transformations was just another way for them to torment the Chapmans. Particularly as they likely knew that she and Zoe weren&#39;t completely lost to lust or the control of this mysterious master, just as Grace wasn&#39;t, and now Whitney was freed from it. That was enough to get Lucy angry enough to stare down the door and &quot;confront&quot; the pair of slug women that started everything. If only to defend her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you did enjoy the pleasure of feeling your penis erupt and the birth of the desire to use to pleasure someone... and feel them put their penis in your vagina at the same time,&quot; Megan countered, &quot;You can&#39;t hide that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy couldn&#39;t immediately counter it before she felt Grace and Zoe come up behind her on either side. At the same time she heard footsteps and knew that Jeff was approaching the door as well. Lucy also sensed Whitney approaching as well, and that boosted her confidence as well. That got her to finally respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not the point,&quot; Lucy said back, &quot;you took our choices away! And you&#39;re still out to take our brother away and enslave us all to this master of yours!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we wouldn&#39;t take your brother away,&quot; Jenny countered, &quot;in fact we&#39;d want you all to stay together with us. After all... if he becomes a male slug... we&#39;ll all have his children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And even if he becomes a slug woman, we&#39;d all still be together and be fathers and mothers at the same time,&quot; Megan added.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still taking his choice away!&quot; Lucy growled back, &quot;You never ASKED Jeff if he wanted to be a slug person. You never asked us if we wanted to be slug people. If you asked Jeff and he said yes... that would be perfectly fine. I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s how slug people are SUPPOSED to interact with humans!&quot; Grace piped up from Lucy&#39;s left, &quot;we&#39;re not supposed to force ourselves on others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet that&#39;s what you&#39;ve been doing,&quot; Jeff added, glancing over to look to see Zoe and Grace rubbing Lucy&#39;s shoulders, as if comforting her. Whitney was a bit further behind, but was still looking to her eldest daughter, &quot;you&#39;ve wanted me... and you sensed that Lucy and Zoe were transforming into slug women and used that to try and taunt me about how we can&#39;t escape...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t,&quot; Jenny pointed out, &quot;you&#39;ve locked yourself in that room and your only way out is through the door to join us... or until your mother or siblings  bring out the slug person in you... either way, we&#39;ll all be a hive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I&#39;m to be part of anyone&#39;s hive... it&#39;ll be one I choose,&quot; Jeff answered, &quot;not one I&#39;m forced into. And I won&#39;t let you hurt my sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurting them is the last thing on our minds,&quot; Megan countered, &quot;after all... your mother became a sexy slug woman. I&#39;m sure your sisters became quite sexy two. We&#39;d actually have a lot of fun together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Serving your master? No way!&quot; Lucy shot back as she looked at the door.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t see through the wooden barrier and was glad that the locking mechanism was on their side of the door and that Megan and Jenny couldn&#39;t knock the door down, but she could get some sense on where Megan and Jenny were. They were right on the other side of the door, and Lucy had the sense that both were carrying triumphant smiles on their faces now that she and Zoe had transformed. It was a taunting thing that both infuriated Lucy and scared her at the same time. It was infuriating because there was the threat of attacking who she was and scary because Lucy also had the sense that there wasn&#39;t much could be done about it. She was a slug woman, Zoe was a slug woman, and there was a part of her that did enjoy the pleasure that came with the orgasm after her transformation completed.<br />
<br />
The bigger thing to fear was that this master that Megan and Jenny had. Just as they had sensed Grace&#39;s resistance and her and Zoe transforming, she had some sense of what was going on with the two slug women that had visited the house the previous evening. As Grace had described, their minds were hazy and as such there was the real potential that they were victims of this master as well, but his control over them was greater. Before all this began, Lucy would have doubted things like magic was real, but that couldn&#39;t be doubted now that she had completely changed species and gained additional anatomy that human females didn&#39;t have. That thus made her more nervous about what this master could do. So far they&#39;d only had to deal with Megan and Jenny and their powers could be resisted. This master would be different.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may not have a choice,&quot; Megan spoke in a more serious tone though one that also sounded more blank than anything that would show emotion. It was serious but showed no triumph or any confidence. It was almost as Megan&#39;s voice was robotic.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is always a choice,&quot; Whitney countered, &quot;it&#39;s tough to resist... I know... but that doesn&#39;t mean not resisting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but it isn&#39;t so much a matter of resisting being part of a hive,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;we like being together... mating together... laying our eggs together. That&#39;s not something to want to resist. It&#39;s love and family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We aren&#39;t your family,&quot; Zoe spoke toward the door and wrapping the tip of her tail over the top of Lucy&#39;s, &quot;you came in and made us change because you wanted us too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t let you take us over and we won&#39;t let you force yourselves on Jeff!&quot; Lucy added.<br />
<br />
&quot;And neither do I want to be with you,&quot; Jeff added, trying to sound as strong as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Jenny replied, &quot;you are the only human left in the house now... and you&#39;re in a room with four slug women. You can&#39;t get out as a human. You will join us one way or the other and once you change, our hive will be complete. You&#39;ll feel all our lusts and find it pleasing. You&#39;ll join us for that alone...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t bet on it,&quot; Jeff answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can... but we can also wait,&quot; Megan spoke, &quot;we&#39;ll be downstairs... hoping you come out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff frowned and looked over his shoulder to see Lucy still focused on the locked door with her eyes narrowed. He then looked to see that Zoe shared the same look and even the normally shy Grace shared a similar look as they flanked either side of Lucy. Maybe that was part of the whole hive mind thing that slug people had. It might not be telepathy, but it could well allow slug people to support each other. It was a few moments before he noted his sisters relaxing a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they gone?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least downstairs,&quot; Grace spoke, &quot;which should give us enough freedom to think over what to do... particularly relating to things like breakfast or getting out of here.&quot;</p>
