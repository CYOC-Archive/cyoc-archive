<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Al Alexander sat is his government class, the few splatters of donkey semen stinking, caused varied students seated around him to give him looks as if he needed to take a shower. Stinking, the semen dried but held to spreading a musty sort of odor, something even the teacher pickup on, and made a terse remark.<br />
<br />
Lucky or maybe not for Al but the semen which flew in his direction stuck to his shirt, it catching mostly light sprayed flecks. These flecks dried, turned then a murky white, and became crusty. The crusted droplets would pop loose, falling from off the shirt, and went in any direction.<br />
<br />
The ceiling fan in the Government class helped to lift and spread the dried semen, it finding entrance into things like purses, into pockets, attaching to gum packages, makeup cases, and a few found the way into the cup of coffee setting upon the teacher's desk, as Mr. Marriweather continued to sip at his drink as he expounded of his learned knowledge about how or government is supposed to work for us.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ted Washburn sat listening intently to the teacher explaining the higher levels of understanding how people should write and express succinctly to those reading of what thoughts were there on a page to read.<br />
<br />
Like the others there in the bathroom, Ted was excited with interest, he a city boy, had never had until then the chance to see an animal whack off. He had got into the situation, and wanting to be the envy of those there, he knelt close, giving of one hand to helping the animal as it thrust and pumped, he sliding his hand along the great length of black silky smooth donkey dic. <br />
<br />
When Drake blew his first donkified load, Ted had seen it building, the donkey balls jerking, as if something were soon to surge, he then leaned toward the donkey rump wishing not to catch any of what then roared out the opened end of that sensual hose.<br />
<br />
Try as he did, the last dribbles and drips fell from off the cock's end, and landed on the bent knee of Ted. He saw it land on his dress slacks, but in the wild thrill of that special moment, he ignored it, and the fair size of a plopped mess soaked threw, causing a spot of infection on his skin.<br />
<br />
Sweating as if he had just finished a footrace, Ted mopped the beads of perspiration as they continued to erupt on his face and forehead. Even the bodily scent Ted knew was his from past times when he would do some strenuous exercise, the scent this time seemed more than something acrid.<br />
<br />
Sweat on his skin acted as a direct aid in helping to spread the infecting semen. Seated, Ted felt his leg had a severe itchy sensation, the feelings spreading up the leg, soon entered his groin, he finding it impossible to ignore then, did scratch at where he felt any an itchy sensation.<br />
<br />
The teacher took note as did a few fellow student seated close by, they looking as Ted sat feverishly scratching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr Washburn, are you having a fit of fleas?&quot; The class teacher asked Ted, as if to ridicule the student into remembering where he sat and that others near him were feeling a sense of distraction.<br />
<br />
Ted, normally an attentive student and always using the best social manners, seemed this time to be caught up in his itchy situation, he failing to pay any attention to the teacher, and sat there scratching then at his groin.<br />
<br />
Teacher Mr. Samuels, stepped toward Ted, and with grabbing of a bare skinned hand to the sweaty infected arm of his student, the infection spread to yet a new level. Picking Ted up from out his seat, the teacher ruffly escorted Ted to the classroom door, informing the student top go home and there take care of his itching problem.<br />
<br />
Ted listened that time to the teacher, he a man Ted would on any other given day have shown the man a greater sense of respect. A nodding head suggested of Ted in agreement to the thought he return home and shower, use then some medication to ease the itch and any rash.<br />
<br />
Ted went to the parking lot, got into his car given him to drive by loving parents, and starting it, he began to get cramps in his hand and in his itchy leg.<br />
<br />
Driving soon shown the lack of attention to traffic when Ted had a pair of close encounters with other driving the say road. His last near miss had the woman driving the other car give him a rather stunned facial expression, he thinking she had seen a ghost.<br />
<br />
Not quite a ghost, but if Ted were as responsive as he was on any other such day, he would see in his rear-view mirror the continued changing reflection of a young man gaining skin coloration and fur over his head and face likened to that of a brown donkey. The long thirty mile drive from college to home every day and especially on this day, seemed to be as if driving to infinity.<br />
<br />
Moving closer to a new sense of a infinitive sort of future, Ted was near to screaming from his sensing itchy and scratching when his attention changed direction. The feel of tickling to the peaks of his ears turned his attention to looking into the rear-viewing mirror. One look there and what he had not seen happening did come at him full-force.<br />
<br />
There peering back at him from the rectangular mirror, Ted saw a partially morphed head of a human changing to become a donkey. There he saw his face, his nose, mouth, thick lips and when he tried to grin at his mirror, he saw then the stout frontal teeth belonging to a donkey and made for cropping and grazing on grasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no,&quot; is what Ted had thought to say, but what issued from out his wide opening mouth he heard as the heehaw bray of the donkey he too would soon then become.<br />
<br />
Fear and anger at what he saw his head changing like, caused out of him several more brays, the last of the seven brays seemed to make him feel rather contented about his changing of form. So then he felt a growing sense of excitement, and pulling the car to the side of that rural road, Ted had a thought to exit the vehicle, walk away, and into the tall bushes that worked as a winter snow fence, but for him and in his present self would  do well as a vanity screen.<br />
<br />
A scramble of strangely uncoordinated legs had Ted falling butt first out the car, lasting hard down on the tar stoned road.<br />
<br />
Stunned by his complete lack of coordinated getting out of the car, as he sat on the pavement, Ted saw still in the car and on the car floor, was his shoes.<br />
Wondering as to why his shoes would have fallen off his feet, Ted reached out and taking hold of his pant-legs, he hoisted them up, seeing then for the first time how he had a hoof for a toe, and his feet, his heel then as a hock on the hind like foot of some donkified human. <br />
<br />
Leaping upright, Ted had to grab at his car side to hold his balance, he standing on changing legs and strange feeling hoofs.<br />
<br />
Wiggling, Ted removed his pants, having no sense of concern if then some other car might come past his situation. The removing of the cloth covering his changed legs, sent the young man into a sense of personal arousal, seeing how he held then an erection so huge, it reminded him of the donkey in the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Instantly, Ted related the fun with that donkey as the real reason for him changing, he becoming soon as much a donkey as was that other donkey. Oddly, the thought of this happening was hitting him like a wondrous fun time would come his way, animal existence held a sense of wonder, and he liked the offer of living completely as do the beasts of the fields.<br />
<br />
Euphoria of the richest sort of desired dreamy state took firm control of Ted and he ripping off his remaining clothing, did dash off into the pucker brush along that road.<br />
<br />
Exertion, physical running sent the infecting properties to engulf the human both of body and of mind, as a hour later and all of what began as a nice person had become a brutal idealistic donkey Jack, he, Ted searching for what his bigger balls told him they wanted him to mount, hump, and give his first hearty donkey release.<br />
<br />
Ted satisfied, Al Alexander was by then attending his first afternoon class. He had stopped in at the bathroom, stood in a toilet stall and took inventory then of what all on him had changed. As changes on Al moved slower due to his lack of anxiety felt and shown, he had a slow manner of excepting what might become of him, hoping that the changes would hold off until after his last class.<br />
<br />
Noon luncheon, teacher Mr. Merriweather decided to leave the college, he feeling an increased temperature, he thought he was too sick to teach. He drove to his condo, and there laid down on the sofa, he fell into a deep, life and body changing sleep.</p>
