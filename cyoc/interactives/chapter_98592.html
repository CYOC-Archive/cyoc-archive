<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You sleep like a log, exhausted after the Meatageddon.  You&#39;re feeling much less stuffed and bloated the next morning, thankfully.  <br />
<br />
Of course, George is willing to honor the bet and is eagerly awaiting your decision.  &quot;It turned out so well last time.  Maybe I should just have you choose all my shoes from now on.&quot;  He then winks flirtatiously at you.<br />
<br />
You do your best to ignore him as you dig through is massive pile of shoes he&#39;d brought along.  You eventually find what you were looking for.  You hand him a pair of large, white, well-worn tennis shoes.<br />
<br />
George frowns, considering them.  &quot;Huh.  My dad&#39;s shoes.  You really want me back in your old and fat club, I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grinning, you lean back on the couch, your enlarged gut protruding from under your shirt.  &quot;I thought you liked being your dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrugs, tossing some of his long, blonde curls back over his shoulder.  &quot;Yeah, I do.  I just, you know, kinda got used to being a girl.&quot;  He grins and pouts his full, red lips.  &quot;Am I just too much for you to handle, big boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani rolls her eyes and playfully smacks him on the shoulder.  &quot;Oh, behave.  While it was nice having another gal around, I think I would prefer it if you two weren&#39;t making out all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your face turns hot and cherry red.  &quot;B-but- We never-&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani tries to hide her riotous laughter by cupping her hands over her mouth.  &quot;Calm down, I&#39;m only teasing.  Oh, you should see the look on your face.&quot;<br />
<br />
You see that George&#39;s feminine face has also reddened by a few shades.  &quot;Uhm, right.  Just let me get some appropriate clothes on first that won&#39;t get shredded.  Then I can change.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few quick minutes later, and George has replaced his blouse and skirt with a set of extra-large, billowing sweat clothes.  He has to hold up the pants to keep them from falling off his dainty waist.  &quot;Let&#39;s just get this over with.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Rani watch with amusement as George slips on the magic socks and large tennis shoes.  He looks down at himself, still swimming in the excess fabric, before striking a pose.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I could make this work.  What do you think, Rani?&quot;  He tries a couple more poses.  &quot;Am I a trendsetter, yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani smirks.  &quot;You know, now that you mention it I do feel the urge to where bulky clothing that&#39;s five sizes too big.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watch as the feminine forms of George&#39;s face begin to harden and become squarer.  His hands, being the only other part of his body visible, become less thin and delicate, and more blunt and angular.  His female shape is quickly becoming more masculine.<br />
<br />
He rubs a hand across his chest.  You can see his breasts are quickly shrinking away.  &quot;Ah, well.  That was fun while that lasted.&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice was also deepening.  Just for a moment, he sounded like his old, teenage self.  His nose hardens, becoming more pronounced, along with his brow.  His hair begins to retract, rapidly shortening as it transitions from blonde to a coppery brown.<br />
<br />
George winces briefly and grabs at his crotch.  &quot;Ah, there it is.  Good to have you back, guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani grimaces and glances at you.  &quot;Ew.  Do guys really talk to their dicks like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug, taking a sip of your beer.  &quot;Only if you&#39;re George.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point, George looks like an average, young guy in his early-twenties.  In fact, he doesn&#39;t look too far off from his teenage self, if a little older.  That&#39;s about to change, though.<br />
<br />
Firstly, George quickly begins to gain height, growing an extra foot or so.  The clothes don&#39;t look as bulky as they did before.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah.  I forgot just how tall my dad is.&quot;  He winces and grabs at his throat, finding his voice had deepened several octaves, being fairly close to his father&#39;s deep timbre.  Though, he still sounded fairly young.<br />
<br />
As he reaches his final height, you notice his face begin to fill out, his cheeks becoming round and his neck widening.  He pulls up his sweatshirt, revealing a growing gut as his body begins to pile on flab.  While his body thickens with fat, it also does so with hair, gifting George with his father&#39;s dense covering.  Before long, his burgeoning belly has a thick coating of coppery hair that runs up to his chest and, from what you can infer, around to his back.<br />
<br />
Rani grimaces.  &quot;Humph.  That&#39;s attractive.&quot;<br />
<br />
George smirks, thick stubble coating the lower half of his face.  &quot;I&#39;ll take that as a compliment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a friend who&#39;s a beautician.  She specializes in waxes.  If you want I can make you an appointment.&quot;<br />
<br />
George&#39;s stubble is quickly growing out, becoming a thick, frizzy beard.  He strokes a thickening, hairy hand through the growing tangles.  &quot;You&#39;re just jealous of my manliness.&quot;<br />
<br />
George&#39;s body is widening as yet more weight piles onto his frame, making him the mountain of a man that is his father.  His hairline begins to recede as wrinkles begin to appear around his eyes and grey sprinkles in his beard.<br />
<br />
Colby steps in, buttoning the last few buttons on his waistcoat.  &quot;You guys started without me?  I wanted to see what-...&quot;  He stops when he looks at the still changing George.  Colby glares at you.<br />
<br />
You shrug.  &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
He glances pointedly at Rani, and then back at you.<br />
<br />
You shrug again.  &quot;No, seriously, what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really think it&#39;s a good idea for George to be turning into... you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
George&#39;s changes seem to be slowing.  He chuckles loudly and rubs a hand across his thinning scalp.  &quot;I&#39;ve got too much hair everywhere else, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Befuddled, you merely shake your head at Colby.  &quot;I don&#39;t see a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby hisses through his teeth.  &quot;Do you really want George to be in the same body that Rani was in when her ex tried to kill us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rani leans toward the two of you.  &quot;What?  Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby&#39;s eyes widen.  &quot;Uh, I mean-&quot;<br />
<br />
She hops up and looks up at the newly transformed George.  &quot;I thought that beard looked familiar.  I never got to look at myself during that whole thing.  For obvious reasons.  Is that want I looked like?&quot;<br />
<br />
George chuckles loudly, gaining his father&#39;s infectious enthusiasm.  &quot;You wore it well, too, kiddo.  This guy can be frightening when he wants to be, but he&#39;s really just a gentle ol&#39; bear.&quot;  He laughs and squeezes Rani in a one-armed bear hug, much to her shock and dismay.<br />
<br />
Colby clasps his hands.  &quot;Rani, we&#39;re really sorry if you find this form... upsetting.  If I had known that&#39;s what they chose I would have-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no!  It&#39;s fine, Colby, really.  Don&#39;t worry about it.  It doesn&#39;t bother me.&quot;  She struggles to release herself from George&#39;s grip, but he only chuckles and squeezes her tighter, pressing her into his soft form.  &quot;George, if you don&#39;t let me go I will neuter you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He grins and releases her from his overly friendly grip.  &quot;I did just get those back.  Luckily, I got me a replacement right here.&quot;  With surprising speed, George reaches out and grabs Colby in a two-armed bear hug.  &quot;Come on, give your little bro a hug.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;George!  Will you...  This is embarrassing.&quot;  Despite himself, Colby grins, his cheeks turning red under his copper and grey beard.<br />
<br />
Rani&#39;s face scrunches up, her dark eyebrows nearly meeting in the middle.  She turns to you.  &quot;Hold on.  Just a minute ago, George said he was turning into his dad.&quot;  She points at the overgrown George, who has begun roughly rubbing Colby&#39;s bare scalp.<br />
<br />
You nod.  &quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nods slightly.  &quot;interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
George finally releases Colby, who winces as he rubs his sore scalp.  George grins at the rest of you.  &quot;You know, you never realize how much you liked being in a body until you&#39;re back in it again.  What are we waiting for?  Let&#39;s have some fun!&quot;</p>
