<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He didn&#39;t want to ask her, but he wished she&#39;d push a little harder. He found himself moving his hips, just to get the little extra stimulation. It felt so good being filled. But it still wasn&#39;t quite enough, he needed something else in there. This was a temporary respite, he knew it. He needed something thick, something warm, something hard.<br />
&quot;What is this?&quot; Dan moaned in his girly voice. &quot;I want more. Please give me more!&quot; <br />
He was going crazy. He pushed his hips up further, the sole of the stiletto touched his bare ass while the heel went in completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember what my favorite words were for telling you off big brother?&quot;<br />
Dan moaned in response.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, fuck off. That&#39;s exactly what you need now every time I find you annoying. Do you know what you need? Can you guess what you need?&quot;<br />
Dan was rocking himself, the stiletto slipping in and out of his wet hungry cunt. Through the haze, the realization hit. He needed cock. A big fat one and he needed it now. <br />
&quot;You bitch!&quot; He groaned and immediately regretted it. He felt the pressure building again. He needed to push and with each push he felt the wonderful stiletto leave his fuck hole further and further. <br />
&quot;Noo...&quot; he moaned softly as the egg pushed the stiletto out and plopped from his soaked vagina. His dick pumping more cum onto the floor as his body shook. <br />
He barely had time to recover, his vagina was empty again, painfully so. He stuck all his fingers in, thrusting and wriggling desperately.<br />
&quot;Help me, please!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, you did say please, but I&#39;m just not sure. You didn&#39;t seem grateful just now. Maybe you&#39;re just trying to use me?&quot;<br />
Dan bit his lip as he kept thrusting. He needed more. &quot;NO!! No, I&#39;m not! I&#39;m sorry. Please fill me with a big...&quot; He hesitated, he still had pride. <br />
&quot;Yes? A big banana?&quot; Kat said teasing.<br />
He couldn&#39;t &quot;Big fat cock! NOW! PLEASE, Fuck me hard! Please! I can&#39;t take it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m a girl, I don&#39;t normally have a cock now do I? Aren&#39;t you just being silly.&quot;<br />
&quot;Please! I...I&#39;m begging!&quot; <br />
&quot;Okay, fine.&quot; Kat waved her hands and pulled down her pants and pulled her panties down slightly. Just above the edge of her pink panties was the most wonderful dick he&#39;d even seen. He felt tears running down his face, he needed that thing inside him. He needed his sister fucking him.<br />
He twisted and turned, aiming his aching cunt at his sister. &quot;Put it in! Please!&quot; He pulled his fingers away to make room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold up brother, let me set up my phone camera.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, not now, please fuck me!&quot;<br />
His sister thrust her dick in him. It slipped right into his soaked hungry pussy. It cried out in happiness at being filled. Dan gasped, it was the best feeling. She moved slowly, thrusting away. Dan needed it now, he bucked his hips faster and faster.<br />
He heard his sister moan behind him, she shivered, gasped and came. He could feel her hot spunk enter his hole, his body exploded in another orgasm. Twitching, he slumped down in his own mess. Feeling spent, but finally fulfilled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now brother. What do you say to your sister?&quot;<br />
He didn&#39;t want to say it, but what would happen if he didn&#39;t. He couldn&#39;t go through that again. He turned on his back in his mess. She was holding her phone. &quot;Well?&quot;<br />
&quot;T...Thanks.&quot; he whispered.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I couldn&#39;t quite catch that. Did you say thanks for something?&quot;<br />
He wanted to glare, but he was too tired and felt to dirty. &quot;T.h.Thanks for the dick.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good, now clean up your mess before mom and dad get home.&quot; She lowered her phone, pulled up her pants, the dick disappearing as she did so and walked off.<br />
<br />
Dan slowly got up, his knees weak from exertion. He could feel his large balls brushing his sensitive vagina. Left with no choice, he held them in his hands and carefully, with his massive member dangling between his legs he made his way up stairs. The head of his huge dick slapping the steps. His sister was at the top of the stairs. Her grin could be seen from space.<br />
He took a careful shower and looked through his clothes for something to fit him. At least the shower made him feel better. He put on his ill fitting boxers, guiding his dick through one of the leg holes. He couldn&#39;t pull them up completely, but at least it kept his massive balls away from his slit. He found some loose fitting sweat pants that was a decent fit. Did his belly look rounder?<br />
<br />
He slowly made his way downstairs, he felt a little bloated. How much did his stupid sister fill him. He was going to tell mom as soon as she got home and he was going to wait for them downstairs. He looked at the pile of eggs on the floor and the fluid stain where he&#39;d been. He felt sick to his stomach, like he was going to puke.<br />
His sister however was waiting for him already. &quot;You look much better brother. You look positively radiant with that belly. Now, how about cleaning up your mess before you get too big?&quot;<br />
Dan looked down, he had an unmistakable belly now. He looked like he was smuggling a soccer ball below his shirt. He pulled it up and a round hard belly stuck forward, seemingly even growing right now. &quot;What&#39;s this? Am..did you make me pregnant?&quot; He couldn&#39;t believe it.<br />
&quot;Of course, I didn&#39;t. Like I&#39;d want more little yous running around. This is a fake pregnancy. It will be over when you lay another egg, but it will get much bigger before then.&quot;</p>
