<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You really have bad BO so you decide it's better to shower first.  It's afternoon and you've slept through the time you were supposed to have gone to work.  You wonder why Richie or anyone else didn't wake you.<br />
<br />
You get into the shower and you get lathered up.  You're thinking about what's happening to you.  You're different, so very different today.  Perhaps it was the blood brother ceremony last night, the mixing of your blood with that of your biker brothers.  Perhaps it's those protein/vitamin/hormone shakes.  You feel a bit stiff and sore, but stronger too and the hot water is taking some of that soreness out of your muscles.<br />
<br />
You are definitely noticing more hair on your body.  You feel the stubble on your face and realize the hairs are thicker than they were.  This is very strange; you're starting to look like Grizz and his brothers and Richie.  Before Grizz brought you here, you had black hair and you're starting to look like you were born to this family.  For all intents and purposes, to Grizz, you ARE his son as of last night.  This line of thinking has brought on a real persistent boner.  You rub it and are rewarded with incredible pleasure.  You look down and can wrap two hands around your rock solid meat with an inch or two beyond that... you couldn't do that before.  It feels so damned good and you must have been really horny because in just a couple of strokes you shoot.  You grunt just like Grizz does when he's moving something heavy.  The sounds of your grunt is at once familiar and oddly unlike you... at least the old you.  <br />
<br />
You're starting to really like the new you, the stronger bulkier you, the you that's more confident, more gritty, more like Grizz; your Dad... Wow! That’s right, he's your Dad now, it's so weird but so comfortable too.  You know this man will do for you as if he had made you with his own sperm and you owe him all the loyalty and love a son can give.  You realize that if you were to stay with your new dad until after you're a legal adult, you could be Grizz's son for life.  The idea appeals to you.<br />
<br />
You finish up your shower and dry off.  Your cock is still semi hard and filling out your boxers nicely.  You get out the after-shave and splash it on your face and rub some on your chest.  You get the deodorant out and slather it in your hairy pits.  The spicy smell of Grizz's scent makes you feel manly, makes you feel more in touch with him and you realize you really love the scent now.  You don't care that it's a cheap after-shave, it smells warm and manly and you can feel the bear hugs Grizz gives you when you please him with your workouts or your work in his custom shop at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
You decide to skip shaving, damn it, every other man in this house has a beard and even if yours is gonna be scraggily for awhile, you want one.  <br />
<br />
You go to your room and grab some cut off jeans and don't bother with a shirt.  Half or more of the guys here don't bother with them half the time and you're now family... might as well start acting like it.<br />
<br />
You head toward the stairs and pass by Pops' room.  The TV's on downstairs and you can hear some cheering occasionally.  You guess the guys are watching football, you can smell cigars and hot-wing sauce.  You glance in as you're passing by and see an ashtray on his dresser by the opened door.  You go into his room, you don't know why; it's impolite.  Impolite but not forbidden.  You look at the three-inch stub of a fat cigar Pops has left there.  You are lost in thought, thinking about Pops and how grandfatherly he is to you.  You pick up the stogie and hold it to your nose.  It's a strong scent and it, like the spicy after-shave, has strong associations with Pops for you, though it also connects Grizz with you because he smokes the same brand.<br />
<br />
You put the chewed end in your mouth and close your eyes.  &quot;So this is what it's like.&quot;  You think, distracted by the strong scent and taste.  You chuckle and it sounds a lot like Grizz's chuckle which surprises you.  You think about the oddness of all of this, rolling the cigar around your mouth.  You were so distracted in your musings that you didn't notice Pops come up the stairs.  He comes into the room while you are concentrating on the feel of the cigar in your mouth and he gently puts one big hand on each of your shoulders.  It startles you, but you don't fear being caught.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I was wonderin' when you'd get curious about cigars.  I've seen how you look at me and Grizz when we're smokin' one.&quot;  Pops says.<br />
<br />
You take the cigar out of your mouth and you say, &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothin' to be sorry for, Gus.  It's a natural curiosity.  Part of becomin' a man.  Grizz was a little younger than you are when he first chomped down on one of my cigars.  My other sons tried them too, but only him and Bull have picked up my habit.&quot;  Pops says.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you're not angry with me?&quot;  You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell no!  I mean, it's a kinda rude to go into a man's room without askin' but I understand why you're not thinking exactly straight at this time.  You've just gone through a very important rite of passage and you're head is full of stuff you gotta sort out and I imagine you're searching yourself for an identity.  You don't know what to be at the moment.  You're distracted and you're changing.  It's natural.&quot;  Pops said and turns you around to face him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So Gus, you wanna light that stogie up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I thought I wasn't allowed.&quot; you say<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you're not allowed outside of the house with one, but as long as Grizz and I know, you're not breaking house rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
You hear someone call for Pops downstairs, one of the bros but you're not sure who and he calls back, &quot;Just a minute Red, I'm talkin' to my grandson.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pops calling you his grandson makes you feel so odd.  Happy, proud and manly all at the same time and yet it's still so new that it's strange too.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only rule in this house, Gus, is that you don't sneak around and you don't do stuff you're told you can't; like go out drinkin' before you're old enough.  Last night was a very special rite and you were allowed a beer.  Don't expect to get another until you're eighteen.  You might get a couple of sips here and there, but not a whole one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;However, Cigars are OK as long as you have no more than one about as big as that one in your hand a week until you're older.  You also can't do stupid shit like smoke in bed... that's why you found that one stubbed out, I put it out before I went to bed.&quot;  Pops smiles at you.  &quot;But I expect you're far too bright to do something so stupid as to smoke in bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you wanna spark up and follow me downstairs?&quot;  Pops asks.  &quot;Five or six of the bros are hangin' out watchin' the game and I'm sure you'd fit right in with us.  Grizz excused you from workout and work today 'cause that blood mixing last night was bound to tire you out... what with the changes and all.&quot;  Pops says and winks at you like you're in on something.  You wonder what he means as he flicks his Zippo lighter and offers the flame to you.  You draw flame to the cigar and cough as the first smoke enters your lungs.  Pops laughs and tousles your hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grizz was just like that his first time.  You'll get used to it.&quot;  Pops says.  &quot;Let's head on down and watch the rest of the game.  Half time is over by the sounds of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You puff on the cigar and cough a bit more, &quot;Smooth!&quot;  You say and it makes Pops laugh again.  You head on down behind Pops to watch the game and join in the male bonding.</p>
