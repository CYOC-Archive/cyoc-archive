<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jen next awoke it was because someone was gently rubbing her head. She grunted and tried to stretch, but the pads made that difficult. She cracked her eyes open in the bright light of the kennel and saw Mina reaching through the bars to pet her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rise and shine sleepy head!&quot; she sang. &quot;Ms. Lockehart will be here soon so you need to wake up and eat your breakfast!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen grumbled but rolled onto her hands and knees. The pads were great for protecting her while crawling around, but she felt that sleeping in them wasn&#39;t as fun. Her knees and ankles felt slightly cramped. Groaning and still trying to stretch she crawled over to her bowl. Mina had filled it with scrambled eggs, she could see bits of sausage, pepper, bacon, and potato mixed in. Happy that it wasn&#39;t last night&#39;s cereal she dug in and at her fill. Mina happily filled it a second time and looked like she was going to do it a third time when Amelia marched through the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mina!&quot; she barked. &quot;Is Jen ready for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mina jumped hurriedly to her feet and stood at attention. Jen noted that she seemed to be sweating slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am!&quot; she cried. &quot;She has eaten her breakfast and is ready for morning play in the yard!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
She marched over to Jen&#39;s cage and looked Mina up and down. She sniffed slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright girl? You look like you&#39;ve been up all night playing with the dogs. You weren&#39;t, were you? You know it&#39;s against the rules to take any dog from the kennel after lights out unless its an emergency.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No ma&#39;am! I was up all night prepping Jen&#39;s meals for the coming week so that chef doesn&#39;t have to worry about it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Amelia and Jen stared at Mina. She held herself ramrod straight as if she were a soldier being inspected by a drill sergeant. Jen watched another bead of sweat run down her forehead. Amelia sniffed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very commendable. Now I am going to have to ask that you go home and get some sleep. You and Yuri are currently the only nightshift workers I can find and I need both of you in perfect condition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please ma&#39;am, before I leave may I take Jen out into the yard for morning playtime!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia seemed to consider this.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Not today. Jen has a very full schedule since this is her first day of training. Maybe next week, but only if you GO HOME now and sleep!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mina swayed for a moment. Then her hand came up as if she were going to salute but she stopped it before it could get higher than her chest. With Amelia&#39;s withering gaze following her she half ran, half marched out of the kennel.<br />
<br />
&quot;I honestly don&#39;t know what is wrong with that girl.&quot; Amelia muttered. &quot;One moment she&#39;s the most efficient worker you&#39;ve ever seen, the next she&#39;s tripping over her own two feet and dumping a cartload of dog food down the hallway.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sniffed a third time and looked down at Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re here at night now too. Maybe once your training is completed you could tell me what it is she gets up to. I&#39;ve asked security but they swear she spends the entire night behaving and doing her scheduled work. I swear she must be doing *something* wrong, she always looks guilty when I see her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia contemplated Jen for a moment. As she stood there a group of carers came in and greeted her before going to feed the dogs their own breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well, I can worry about Mina another day. Right now we have work to do. Let&#39;s get you out into the yard for free play time. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll want to participate directly but you should at least begin to acclimatize yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia unlocked the cage and attached the leash to Jen&#39;s collar. Jen followed her out of the kennel and into the yard she had briefly visited yesterday. They were the first ones there and Jen took advantage of the peace and quiet to pee again. Amelia praised her for it. After dealing with nature&#39;s call, Jen decided to explore the yard for a bit. It was larger than she thought, the bushes on one side screened off a whole section. Jen was about to wander into it when she noticed the large floor-to-ceiling windows that opened straight into the male wing of the school. She could clearly see a group of trainers leading dogs down the hall to their own yard. She decided to stay in the other section, which only had a few small windows that showed only paneled ceilings in the bitch wing.<br />
<br />
As she was poking around the corners the carers brought out the first group of dogs for play time. Most of them ran off to play with each other but a couple of them were curious about the strange new dog and came over to check Jen out. She spent a few minutes trying ineffectually to keep them from licking her face and let out a shriek when one of them got behind her and began licking her pussy instead. In moments several of the carers had run over and separated her from the rest of the dogs. One of them kept apologizing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am so sorry Jen. Percy! Heel! She just got excited to meet you that&#39;s all. She didn&#39;t mean any harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
By this point Amelia had strode over and began rubbing Jen&#39;s back to calm her down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s too soon to have you out here with the rest of the dogs.&quot; She mused. &quot;Marissa, is anyone using the side yard at the moment?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Ms. Lockehart. Tammy booked it for this afternoon so she can let her collies run but it should be empty right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect. I&#39;ll take Jen there instead. We can work on her speed before lessons begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was led back into the building and down another hall to a different door. This one opened onto a long grassy space that stretched for about 100 yards. It was surrounded by a high chainlink fence topped with razor wire. Jen eyed the wire nervously, wondering what it was for. As if reading her mind, Amelia answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s for keeping unwanted guests out. We are fairly deep in the wilderness here and have to deal with the occasional bear or coyote coming to visit. There is another fence further out that almost always stops them but we maintain these fences as well just in case. Now let&#39;s work on your agility. I can&#39;t mosey around waiting for you all month.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia put Jen through her paces, having her crawl as fast as she could up and down the length of the yard. By the end of the hour she was exhausted and sweaty but hadn&#39;t made much improvement. Amelia stopped to inspect her gloves and pads to ensure they were providing enough protection. Satisfied that Jen wasn&#39;t hurting herself with all the running she let her rest for a few minutes before leashing her again and taking her to one of the classroom spaces.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Obedience training proper was interesting for Jen. She had an obvious advantage being able to directly understand the commands that were being taught and following them without the need for physical intervention. Amelia discovered that if she put Jen at the front of the group then some of the more intelligent dogs would start to imitate her. Jen quickly became the &#39;teacher&#39;s pet,&#39; much to everyone&#39;s amusement. After morning class the rest of the dogs were taken back to the yard to play some more, but Jen was taken back to the kennel so that one of the carers could give her lunch while Amelia went and ate her own. Lunch was similar to last night&#39;s dinner, a meat paste with chopped vegetables mixed in. The carer sat and stroked her back while she ate. Jen found it quite soothing.<br />
<br />
After lunch the carer brought Jen back to the yard. She was a little worried but it was mostly empty, most of the trainers had taken their charges out for individual training so the only ones left were the quiet, well-behaved ones that mostly left Jen alone. She wandered around a bit until she saw Amelia enter the yard and begin talking to one of the carers. She was about to crawl over when she realized that nature was calling for the second time that day, only worse. She panicked. She needed to go *now* but she couldn&#39;t bring herself to just shit right in the middle of the yard with Amelia and the carers watching. She wanted to cry again. Noticing her distress, Amelia excused herself from the group and walked over to see what was wrong. For the second time that day she seemed to read Jen&#39;s mind with surprising accuracy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to shit, don&#39;t you.&quot; she said bluntly. &quot;Well, the sooner you do it the better you&#39;ll feel. Just get it over with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen stared up at her pleadingly, but Amelia wasn&#39;t budging. Choking back a sob, Jen awkwardly squatted. Amelia walked a few steps away and turned her back to give her a bit of privacy. The carers all around the yard seemed to simultaneously find something interesting to look at in every direction but Jen&#39;s. Jen could feel how badly she needed to go, but she didn&#39;t think she could do it. Bracing herself, she began to push and was shocked at how quickly and easily it just slid out. She was so surprised that she released her bladder without thinking. In seconds, Amelia was behind her with a plastic bag to scoop up her leavings. Jen yelped when she felt something cold and wet slide across her ass and spun around to find Amelia dropping a wet-wipe into the bag before she tied it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;See,&quot; she said smugly, &quot;I told you you would feel better. I had our chef prepare your meals with a few special ingredients to make it easier for you to pass and also a bit more pleasant for those of us that have to clean it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jen sat there gaping at her she heard clapping and cheering. She turned and saw that the carers were congratulating her. She felt her cheeks burn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be embarrassed, you did a good job for your first time. Be proud of yourself. Come along now. We have afternoon lessons and then I want to get you back in the side yard before dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Afternoon lessons were just the same as the morning ones. Learning new commands, repeating the old ones until they became second nature. Once again Jen found herself at the front of the class so the other dogs could follow her example. After lessons it was back to the side yard, which she had to share with two very energetic border collies that kept lapping her as she struggled to find the right muscles to boost her speed. Finally she reached the point where she was just too exhausted to move and Amelia decided to call it quits for the day.<br />
<br />
Jen was led back to the kennel and Amelia locked her into her cage, instructing her to lie down and rest until dinner. Amelia herself had to finish some paperwork before she headed home but she would see Jen again in the morning. Jen drank some water before laying down gratefully on the soft cushion of her bed. She must have dozed off because the next thing she knew a familiar voice was calling for her to wake up. She opened her eyes and saw Mina standing outside her cage with the food cart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wakey, wakey!&quot; she called, &quot;Time for din-din!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen pulled herself off her bed and over to her food bowl. She was a little sore from her exercise in the yard but she pushed through it. Mina squatted down and scooped food from the container into the bowl which Jen began eating without any hesitation. While she was enjoying her dinner she couldn&#39;t help but notice a faint buzzing sound, like a cellphone vibrating in someones purse. She glanced up from her bowl and nearly choked.<br />
<br />
Mina was still squatting in front of her, but she was staring off into space with a blank look on her face. What caught her attention though was the fact that from her low angle she could see straight up the girl&#39;s skirt. Mina had decided to go without panties today so Jen had a completely unobstructed view of her fiery orange bush with her stiff clit poking out of it. The source of the buzzing was also quite noticeable. Mina had a strap around her thigh holding a remote with a thick wire coming out of it and disappearing between her hairy lips. It was obviously a vibrator and Mina seemed to have it on full blast. The insides of her thighs were slick and shiny with her juices and as Jen watched she saw her thigh muscles twitch as she let out a nearly inaudible gasp that was almost lost in the sounds of all the dogs eating. Mina started to come down from her orgasm and Jen quickly buried her face in the bowl again, pretending she hadn&#39;t just seen any of that.<br />
<br />
Mina gave her seconds and left the bowl of dry cereal, just like the night before. Jen was too shocked and tired to watch her leave, opting to just collapse on the bed and pass out again. If Mina came back again later that night to repeat her masturbation session Jen didn&#39;t know. She slept solidly through the night and woke up the next morning as Mina was delivering her breakfast.</p>
