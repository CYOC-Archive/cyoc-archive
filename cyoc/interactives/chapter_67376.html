<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Baxter and Tom stared at the approaching cat-man. He obviously was not as extreme a transformation as either Tom or Baxter, retaining a much more human physique, at least above the waist. He seemed nice, though. Smells good, too...<br />
<br />
'WTF?' thought Baxter. 'Where did that come from? Smells good? Actually, he does smell good...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hello there. You smell good too. I'm Reg, by the way.&quot; Both Reg and Tom were looking at Baxter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I just say 'He does smell good'&quot; said Reg, Tom, and Baxter all in unison. Baxter blushed, or at least felt his face flush, though you couldn't see with all the fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you did,&quot; said Tom. &quot;And you smell pretty good yourself, Azure&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, she does,&quot; said Reg. &quot;Azure smells very good...&quot;<br />
<br />
The way Reg said Azure, Baxter realized he liked the name. And he liked Reg. Especially his smell. Actually, he liked Tom and Reg's smell. He liked them so much he was content to just stand there and lean forward to smell them both in turn, but mostly Reg. In fact, Baxter was so engrossed with this that he lost all motivation to do anything but smell Reg.<br />
<br />
A moment later Baxter quickly realized that he and Reg were not just smelling, but were actually nuzzling each other. It might have been when Reg began to kiss Baxter, but it definitely became clear when the two slowly dropped to their knees and began caressing each other. Baxter felt Reg's gentle caress of his breasts become a more pleasurable kneading as the two continued. Reg lay back and Baxter almost instinctually crawled forward until he was on all fours above Reg. Baxter was aware of how his breasts hung and swayed as he positioned himself over Reg. Baxter began to lean forward so his tits just caressed Reg's muscular chest. The feeling was electric, and his claws came out involuntarily. He began to nip Reg with his tongue. The texture was unlike anything Baxter could describe, and the feeling of running it over Reg's chest, neck, and arms was suprisingly pleasurable. Reg was obviously in heaven himself as he arched his back to allow Baxter better access to his tummy as well.<br />
<br />
The position Baxter was in, on all fours and leaning forward, necessarily put his ass up in the air, and Baxter could feel his tail moving side to side in long arcs as it caressed his butt. He also felt like he had to poop, except it was different. He was pushing on the inside like he was constipated, except he didn't need to actually use the bathroom, he just felt the need to pump his muscles down there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got you, Azure&quot; said a voice from behind, bringing Baxter out of his own world and into the reality that he was parading his nether regions for the world, blissfully unaware of the consequences. Reg was still enjoying the tongue grooming Baxter was giving out when a pressure at Baxter's rear side reminded him about Tom. Tom who was a cat-man. Tom who was being left out. Tom who ... who smelled soo-oo-ooh-oh oh oh ahhhh...<br />
<br />
Baxter was in control no more. Instinct took over as Tom pushed his rock-hard man organ into Baxter's newly acquired orifice. Baxter obliged and even pushed back to get Tom in deeper. Baxter loved the feeling of fullness and the contractions of his pussy around Tom's dick. After a moment lost in time, Baxter felt electric spasms of joy and peace wash over him as his pussy clamped around Tom, milking him ferociously until Tom himself began to pound and spasm into Baxter. MEEeeooowwwWWW!<br />
<br />
A new sensation of warmth spread inside Baxter. It was primal pleasure. He relaxed somewhat as Tom almost yanked his penis out. Baxter could feel the enormous volume of Tom's semen inside his pussy. 'I have a pussy' thought Baxter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you do, you sweet pussy cat, and now it's my turn,&quot; said Reg as Baxter again felt a large, hard organ probe his holes. Reg had apparently gotten up while Tom had pounded Baxter senseless. Baxter felt Reg zero in on his vagina, and then thrust inside. It was heaven all over again, including the second blasting with Reg's sperm.<br />
<br />
If felt so good, in fact, that Baxter insisted on this treatment at least once a day. And Reg and Tom were always pleased to oblige. In fact, it seemed that none of them really had any conscious control in the matter. The lust seemed to exude from Baxter. At least for a few weeks. Then Baxter no longer wanted anything to do with Tom or Reg. He wasn't angry, just indifferent. Reg and Tom started calling Baxter &quot;Blue Lust&quot; because of Baxter's new name &quot;azure&quot; seemed appropriate for how they felt now that the sex was all gone. Everyone very soon found out why, but not before Baxter's other breasts had begun to swell a little.</p>
