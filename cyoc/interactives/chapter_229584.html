<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ok so let&#39;s do this thing of reviewing some of these fics on Alternaterealities.horny.xxx. Under the Tag &quot;Unfuta&quot;, the third most popular story published last week was one with the following title:<br />
<br />
//A world with only TRUE-FUTAS and UNFUTAS// Huh...what?? What the hell is supposed to be a /TRUE-FUTA/??? That term doesn&#39;t sound familiar to You at all.<br />
<br />
Will it be a new weird kink/fetish that you haven&#39;t encountered yet?? And maybe it&#39;s another pretty kinky and popular thing that you haven&#39;t experimented with yet?? Laura, maybe this is the inspiration you were looking for so much!! Let&#39;s see what this /TRUE-FUTA/ thing is.<br />
<br />
After doing a quick search on Google, you find the following, apparently a True-Futa is this hypothetical and fantastic idea, of a Woman who, similar to the Unfutas, only has one set of genitals, but in this case the True-Futa would be a woman who only has balls and cock down there, she lacks the pussy under her balls, the only thing that is connected to her body down there are her balls and her cock.<br />
<br />
Huh...that sounds weird to you, why are there suddenly several kinks with the idea of a woman having only one set of genitals instead of two?? As everyone knows, a woman since always is supposed to be something with cock, balls and pussy in her crotch!! All together. The idea of something with just a cock and balls underneath without the vagina located under the balls, just sounds like a man to you. So a True-Futa would be something like that typw of crotch, on a female body of someone with likw breasts...? That sounds odd.<br />
<br />
Where do these people get these weird ideas of a woman not having two genital sets, exactly?? What is next, Cockless men?? Men with Pussy??? <br />
<br />
At reviewing this story that you decided paid attention to, other tags it has are...hyper-size yikes. It&#39;s been a while since you read something with giantic tits or that kind of thing. This will be something kinky for sure.<br />
<br />
In any case, it catches Laura&#39;s attention that among the tags, it seems to indicate that this fic is about a world without men. Hmmm that actually interests Laura.<br />
<br />
Laura would be lying if she said that she has never asked herself, why men even are a thing?? I mean women don&#39;t need them to reproduce and have offspring.<br />
<br />
Maybe this fic will help Laura find what&#39;s fun about these kinks, let&#39;s see.<br />
<br />
Laura began to review more the description of the fic to see what the premise of it was, and she noticed that the description was quite long and detailed, which actually excited her, she decided to dare to read the whole thing out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;...In this world, there is no such thing as men, they have never existed and have never been there, the idea of men as a concept simply doesn&#39;t exist, and therefore there has never been such a thing as masculine pronouns, he/him are simply words that have never existed and no one has ever used it to describe something, only she/her has existed since forever.Therefore all the names that have been used for individuals have always been feminine. Because all the people have lived on this planet, they are all women, they have all had breasts. No human has ever lived without breasts on her body.<br />
<br />
But with respect to women, there have always been two classes of women. These two classes are known under the names /Unfuta/ and /True-Futa/. Each one has only one set of genitals. What the Unfuta have connected to their crotch is simply a Pussy, therefore they have developed a uterus inside their bodies. While a True-Futa has Cock and Balls in her crotch and they don&#39;t have an entrance that allows them to get pregnant, as is the case with the Unfutas. A woman is born with one class or another.<br />
<br />
However, the differences don&#39;t end there, since the bodies and minds of the Unfuta and True-Futa develop differently, especially in terms of their body proportions, and the way these bodies work.<br />
<br />
To begin with, all women have huge breasts, large and giant sizes. The Cup-Size of a True-Futa is minimum J-Cup at adulthood, and the size of these varies from J-Cup to Q-Cup, with all large sizes being equally common in that range. While an Unfuta has much larger breasts, the majority of their bodies is just breasts usually. An Unfuta is a minimum Q-Cup as an adult, and its size varies from Q-Cup to ZZZ-Cup.<br />
<br />
And all of these breast sizes are developed naturally, breast enlargement surgeries aren&#39;t a thing in this world. No one has ever seen them as something necessary.<br />
<br />
This is why very large size bras are the most common in every store. From A to I-Cup are bra sizes that are used exclusively when the woman is going through puberty, since at 18 years old, no woman is under J-Cup. That&#39;s why adult women with breasts that aren&#39;t bigger than their head, isn&#39;t a thing.<br />
<br />
Saggy Breast is also something that doesn&#39;t exist. All women&#39;s breasts have a perfectly sexy, perky and bouncy size, with a lot of filled in there, all tits are fat.<br />
<br />
In a True-Futa&#39;s body, all of its overgrowth goes to other areas.<br />
<br />
They have really HUGE dicks. The minimum cock size of an adult True-Futa is a 18&quot;long cock with 6&quot; diameter, and the maximum length of True-Futa&#39;s Cock is 6ft long and 18&quot; diameter, a True-Futa with that gigatic Cock size is really common because all sizes within that range are equally common, and these women can walk perfectly with these things larger than a woman erect with no problems, in the same way that the Unfutas can move with those huge tits without problems despite the large space that each kind occupies.<br />
<br />
A True-Futa&#39;s balls are huge, at least the size of her head and they go from that size to larger, because they have a huge amount of cum stored inside. Most True-Futas can fill a swimming pool with the sperm they produce in a day. While Unfutas have a huge amount of milk stored in their tits, and with that they can constantly fill a swimming pool with what they produce in a day. True-Futas also produce milk daily in their breasts, just in a much smaller quantity.<br />
<br />
And both the cum and liters of sperm that the True-Futas produce, as well as the milk that they and the Unfutas produce, are incredibly delicious and addictive.<br />
<br />
And both types of women are total perverts. As adults, they are constantly thinking about sex and lewd things.<br />
<br />
True-Futa loves playing with her huge dicks too much, thet spends hours every day masturbating, covering everything around them with the delicious smell of her sperm, and licking and sucking her own huge cocks.<br />
<br />
While an Unfuta loves to play with her breasts and spend time milking herself or spilling her milk everywhere...&quot;<br />
<br />
My god, Laura got a huge boner reading all that, she is a sucker for every perverted fic with a very detailed and written description like this one, but Laura herself couldn&#39;t believe that she read the entire 700 words of that description out loud, she blushed in embarrassment and had to cover her mouth. Maybe Laura was into these things a lot more than she thought?? The combination of world without men and Hyper-Sizes made her get too involved?? What was Laura doing reading paragraph all the way until the end, she thought.<br />
<br />
And what Laura didn&#39;t suspect is that the Controller recorded exactly every word of what she just read, and that huge paragraph was written on its screen...<br />
<br />
BEEP.</p>
