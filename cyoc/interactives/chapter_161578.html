<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Twiddle, twiddle, twiddle,” the laboratory phone began to ring. As the stately doctor turned and walked away from interrogating the girls, went to answer the incoming call.<br />
<br />
“Laboratory, Doctor Byle here, who, Gerald, no I sent him on an errand. Oh, as yes that could be a real problem, yes, well yes, at present I am in a position to remedy your difficulty, correct assumption, you could call back when Gerald arrives, thank you for the heads up!”<br />
<br />
“Now , where were we, as you came for checking if from the attack you might have some transmitted infection, and Gerald would do some testing. Well then, if you would be so kind, enter the dressing room there to the right of you, and remove all your clothes, there are hospital gowns laid out on a shelf, please put one on and come again here for the tests to begin.<br />
<br />
As for you, her friend if you would take a seat there by the door, as the tests take a few minutes to prepare, and only a minute or two to actually complete.” The Doctor told Carla what to do, and Jen to sit, as wait.<br />
<br />
Acting somewhat reluctant at the request of the Doctor, Carla went and entered the dressing room.<br />
<br />
Jen did as she was told and walked to find a set of four chairs near the laboratory entrance door. As she sat down, Jen looked at the floor around the chairs. See saw what looked like dried globs and or puddles of some chalky white substance. Jen began rubbing her tennis shoe at a fat glob, this holding her attention as she nearly forgot about Carla.<br />
<br />
“Ah-ha, you are prepared so nicely, here, please take a seat on this examination table. Good, now let me begin by checking your vitals.” The Doc said as Carla wishing the tests would be finished soon and she could then leave the research company, she felt nervous about the Doc and from what other things she had seen.<br />
<br />
“Heart sounded good,  blood pressure is on the high side, well that is easy to understand as to why, so now if you would swing your legs this way and lie back on the table, as I shall take a blood sample, and do a vaginal inspection for any injury the bull might have caused.” The Doctor said, his voice sounding softer, more calming.<br />
<br />
As Carla laid there acting as willing, she was still wary of this doctor, wishing it was Jerry doing her examination. She watched as the doctor began arranging some items he planned on as needed to do his examining. She saw him open a small refrigerator, the door blocking her from seeing inside. The Doctor stood for a minute thinking about what he needed and then he retrieved a vial, and then took out a second vial, before returning to sitting alongside where Carla laid waiting.<br />
<br />
“Okay, now if you would not like to watch me taking blood, just look at the wall.” The doctor said as he fumbled with what he had set together on a surgical tray. As out of the corner of her left eye, Carla watched with some sense of apprehension, she saw the doctor filling a syringe with a blue colored, as sparkly solution.<br />
<br />
The doctor turned his back toward Carla as he fidgeted with something more, as she could not see as of what he had. He then turned and said, “Here we go!”<br />
<br />
Carla felt the pin-prick of the syringe entering her skin, and then felt a cold feeling from around the injection area. She moaned slightly as the doctor said, “Easy now, it comes with a mild sensation of discomfort, as… there, all done!”<br />
<br />
The doctor rose up to standing beside Carla, as he stepped to the end of the exam table and shocked his patient, asking Carla to raise her knees, bending her legs, and then lay wide her legs to the sides for his ease of doing a vaginal examine.<br />
<br />
“Ow, hey,” Carla yelped, she feeling the sting of a second syringe poking her in a very sensitive place.<br />
<br />
“Nothing to be concerned about, just a local muscle relaxing injection; as it allows the probe an eased entrance to collect a sample.” The Doc said, but Carla felt worried, as the second injection had with it that same chilling sensation as what she felt a few minutes before in her upper arm.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Carla felt a wave of calmness engulfing her, as she closed her eyes, not wanting to think how the doctor was violating her body. <br />
“Easy, now just, lie there and relax!” The doctor said, as he watched his patient slowly eased into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
Just then the laboratory door opened and in walked Gerald or Jerry as he preferred being addressed. “Hey, oh hi Jennifer, Doctor Byle, are you doing the examining?” Jerry asked, as he walked across the laboratory to opening the small fridge and placed the blood samples he went to get, as put inside the fridge.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me Doctor, but two vials are noticeably missing from inside the cool storage.  Now I know both Jennifer and Carla, as they, or Jen called me to request for Carla to be tested. I agreed to do it, and after the tests told Jen I would call them at her home. I know, it is later, but I work the night shift, and usually things are slow at night. The slow times would allow me time to process the samples taken. Did you draw ant blood, where is the sample vial…, no you didn’t, what is this, bovine serum, you used Reformation serum, you injected, she is asleep, like out cold, and what then do you plan to do next?” A then worried Jerry said, as he turned to cast a look back at Jennifer, she calmly sitting, waiting for Carla.<br />
<br />
“You, keep quiet, as Doctor Haun had a confrontation with a patient in the orientation room, and these two girls heard and saw too much for them to just stroll out of here and inform possibly the authorities. Your Miss Carla just received a phase one injection  of Reformation Bovine serum, as she was attacked by a bull what inseminated her vaginally and orally. His semen should react directly with the bovine serum, as when she awakes, by then placed in a T-cell, her ultimate transitioning she shall see, feel, and realize her fate.<br />
<br />
As for her friend, I have not decided what her fate could be, I need to check the daily order catalog, and decide from that as to her manner of transition. You call security, and have Miss Carla moved to her T-cell, and inform Miss Jennifer that her friend became ill, and requires hospitalization, do you understand me?” The Doctor said as cold and confident that he had saved the company from a possible embarrassment.</p>
