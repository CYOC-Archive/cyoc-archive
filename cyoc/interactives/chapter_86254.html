<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake woke to the luxurious feeling of warm sunlight filtering through unfamiliar curtain. After a moment or two he remembered he was in Katie&#39;s bed. Oh, right. Hadn&#39;t he - no, wait, that had to have been a dream, right? The thing with the watch, and his penis, and the dick-measuring competition he actually won? It had all the hallmarks of a dream, but that being the case, how exactly had he ended up at his girlfriend&#39;s apartment? He swept his hand through the bed, hoping to find Katie&#39;s curvaceous form, but it seemed he was alone. He guessed five more minutes wouldn&#39;t hurt. He&#39;d confront how he got here then...<br />
<br />
His attempt to roll over and catch five more minutes of that great dream was rudely interrupted by some kind of obstacle, and after a moment, an at once familiar and unfamiliar tumescent throb commanded his attention instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, all right then,&quot; he muttered, his hand gliding down below his waist. Then froze. Expecting to encounter Old Faithful (okay, Old Unreliable if one got right into it, which he rarely had), five point four inches, it instead encountered the root of a significantly larger, thicker member. Said member responded by almost instantly adding what felt like another half-inch in girth.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-holy crap.&quot; The realisation that the previous two days had not, in fact, been a dream brought back vivid recollections of Katie&#39;s titfuck, those E-cup breasts sandwiching an at last worthy member. Soon he was at full mast, hard in a way his morning wood had never been before - hand roaming up and down an endowment which, if he remembered the size charts correctly, put him in the top 10% of American men. Grade A, he thought, distractedly. His hands roamed upwards, ascending the unfamiliar height to the top of his cock, where one encircled his engorged plum-sized head. I&#39;m a two-hander, he realised. And not even a borderline one - one hand was clearly roaming up and down his shaft while the other massaged his now precum-slick head.<br />
<br />
Knock-knock.<br />
<br />
Hmm? Part of his mind registered the knock, but the bulk of his neurons were currently occupied in absorbing the vast waves of pleasure emanating from his organ. It&#39;s coming from another world, he thought dreamily as images of Katie&#39;s tits washed through his consciousness. For a moment she quivered, hair darkening, waist and hips thickening, then it was Liz who was servicing his expanded cock in his mind&#39;s-eye. He barely even noticed the substitution, starting to buck his hips, fucking his hands as his balls swelled, left hand hitting the bloated sack with each stroke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; a male voice called out, slightly hesitant &quot;Is is anyone there?&quot; Jake recognised Josh&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie, c-can you get it?&quot; said Jake, trying to sound as normal as possible between the pre-orgasmic shudders that had never been part of his masturbatory experience up until now. No response. It occurred to him that given the light outside she might already have let for work.<br />
<br />
 &quot;F-fuck.&quot; Jake threw his left arm out and reached around madly on the dresser. Tissuestissuestissuetissue-<br />
<br />
Too late. He cupped his right hand underneath his penis, but the first jet ignored the measly trajectories of old and instead hit the undersheet halfway down the bed with an audible splatter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, shit, shit!&quot; Jake brought himself into an upright position in time for the second jet to spurt almost vertically, landing across his thigh and the right-hand side of the mattress. He doubled over, which had the desired effect of directing the third jet between his legs, almost reaching the bottom of the bed. The fourth and fifth jets thankfully seemed to be running out of steam, and he was able to lever himself out of bed, his endowment still heavily tumescent. He glanced at the bed. It looked like a group of seagulls had selected it for carpet-bombing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, is that you?&quot; said the voice at the door. Dammit, if he hadn&#39;t said anything Josh might have gone away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just, erm, coming,&quot; called Jake, weighing up his options before dumping the soiled sheets onto the floor. A sixth aftershock hit him, spurting thick, white cum onto the floor near Katie&#39;s coffee table. He grabbed the nearest thing to hand - a fluffy pink bathrobe - and wrapped it around him, trying to ignore the pleasurable waves from his still 80% hard dick. He exited the bedroom and closed the door after him. Get rid of Josh, then clean up. Then assess the damage to your career by being - he looked around for the watch but couldn&#39;t see it - X hours late for work.<br />
<br />
It occurred to him just before he opened the door that Josh might not have had the best motives for coming over so soon after losing a sexually humiliating contest. Should you really be letting in a 6&#39; 6&#39;&#39; body builder who you just made look inadequate - no, not just inadequate but a bragging liar - in front of his girlfriend, he thought. You must really want a beatdown. The door opened and he found himself staring at the bigger man&#39;s pecs, poorly hidden by an XL tee. He looked up, expecting to see a glower that would precede a beatdown, but if anything Josh looked despondent.<br />
<br />
&quot;You OK, man?&quot; Jake asked. &quot;Come in and sit down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh shrugged - a &#39;I can so not be doing with this&#39; gesture, and followed Jake through into the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not keeping you, right?&quot; asked Josh. &quot;I mean, you work 9-5, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the ship&#39;s sailed on that one,&quot; Jake said. &quot;I just got a new watch and I didn&#39;t set an alarm, and Katie didn&#39;t wake me up. I guess they tried phoning my place. I&#39;ll just have to come up with an excuse. You want coffee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... You got it last night, right?&quot; Josh said, his shoulders dropping.<br />
<br />
Jake coloured slightly. &quot;Y-yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t totally a loss, then. I mean, that bullshit game. I&#39;m really sorry Liz put you - us - through that. And for taunting you. Not cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for being the bigger man.&quot; Woah, fuck, did you really just say that? Jake cringed at the unintentionally cruel double meaning. Josh for his part just shrank further into his chair. Hunched over he didn&#39;t look that much taller than Jake. Jake walked through into the kitchen and put the kettle on.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, erm,&quot; Jake looked through the cupboards for coffee grinds. &quot;you didn&#39;t just come back over for that right? Did you want to speak to Katie? Looks like she&#39;s long gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Josh said. &quot;Actually, I was hoping to speak to you.&quot;</p>
