<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sky above was a luscious mix of tangerine, yellow, white and pink colours, whilst the ocean was a tempting near-clear shade of blue. Gazing out at it, Jeff Kaylon breathed deeply, thinking, &quot;This is paradise,&quot; and looking down, noting he was naked, he thought he should be upset at the fact that his semi-pudgy body was on display for any to see, but rather found himself settling into a feeling of tranquil bliss.<br />
<br />
Unabashedly he stepped into the surf. Liking the feeling of the warm water as it lapped over his feet and up past his ankles, he wiggled his toes and buried them in the sand. Thinking about going back out, he was caught unaware when a set of hands slipped under his arms and arms encircled his torso, hugging him in an affectionate manner. Smiling, knowing it was Richard, he leaned his head back against the other man&#39;s shoulder. As he did this, Richard leaned down and kissed Jeff&#39;s cheek and whispered, &quot;We should take a vacation here more often, shouldn&#39;t we, honey,&quot; as Jeff placed his hands over Richard&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
A feeling of something being off starting to eat at him, Jeff found himself answering, &quot;Mmmm, we should&quot; in a low, sultry tone as he continued to lean into Richard, liking the man&#39;s scent, the way he felt and the sensation of being safe and secure as long as Richard held him.<br />
<br />
In response, Richard gently spun him around, cupped his hands on either side of Jeff&#39;s cheeks and kissed him fully on the mouth. Suddenly realising he was being kissed by another dude, who was just as naked as he was, Jeff tried to resist, but instead leaned in an returned the gesture. Wanting to say no, he instead articulated a noise of pleasure as Richard, in a caressing manner, slowly moved his hands until they were lovingly running through Jeff&#39;s short hair. Liking what he was experiencing, Jeff missed it as, with each pass, his hair lengthened until it was down past his shoulders, missed it entirely as Richard gently guided him down so that they were both lying on a towel.<br />
<br />
A soft noise and a giggle of what he was sure to come, Jeff found himself letting Richard do so, even as a voice in his mind screamed that it was wrong. Eyes drifting down, and spotting Richard&#39;s penis, which was starting to thicken, Jeff reached down and began to stroke it, encouraging it to become fully hard. Atop him, Richard smiled and drew his hands down and, cupping Jeff&#39;s chest, began to massage it. As he did this, Jeff continued to play with Richard erect member, teasing it, fondling it, liking how it felt in his hand, which had started to shrink, becoming petite and feminine. Suddenly realising what was happening to not just one of his hands, but both, as well as his chest, which had began to balloon out into two, pert and full B cup breasts, Jeff tried to cry out, but instead moaned in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Richard, hearing this, grinned and trailed his hands down Jeff&#39;s body, causing his stomach to flatten, his torso to take on a more hourglass shape, his hips to flair and, as he started to dip his hand between Jeff&#39;s legs, Jeff&#39;s butt and thighs to take on a more feminine appearance. Not wanting this, but unable to communicate this, as he kept making noises that he did, whilst his mind insisted it was okay, Jeff cried out in excitement as he felt a rush of comforting warmth wash over him, the nipples on his breasts and the area between his legs felt engorged and sensitive in a pleasurable way. The feeling going whole body, he tried to fight against it as his penis and testicles began to regress and pull between his legs and began forming what would be first the exterior female genitals, then the interior. Knowing what was going to happen, both wanting and not wanting Richard inside him, Jeff tried to push the guy away and instead grasped him and pulled him closer.<br />
<br />
Abruptly, Jessica sat up and looked wildly around her room. Confused, feeling weird, breathing heavily, unsure why she was looking at a girl&#39;s bedroom, the dream still holding firm and refusing to leave her, it took a moment before she was able to start to put it all together. Listening to the soft noise of the overhead fan, liking the way the cool circulating air wafted against the exposed parts of her skin, how soft the sheets felt, and the way the sleeper shirt she was wearing, which had shift up past her waist, felt, Jessica smiled contently. Thinking of the past couple days, she tried to sort out all the had happened and instead found herself thinking about the dream.<br />
<br />
Slowly her hand drifted to down to her exposed groin and not really paying attention to what she was doing, she idly began to run a finger over her groin, slowly moving it downward and toward the area between her legs. The warmth she was feeling growing, as well as the sensation of sensitivity and engorgement in her breasts and vulva, she absently rubbed her fingernail against her clitoris. Shuddering expectation as the dream and the image of Richard left her, it suddenly dawned on Jessica what she was about to do. Sitting up, her mind rebelling against the idea of using one finger to self-stimulate then masturbate, she moaned out, &quot;Ugh, no,&quot; and standing, she rushed across the room as quietly as she could and into the private bathroom.<br />
<br />
There, she shucked off her nightshirt and stepping into the shower, she turned on the water. A shudder escaping her as the cold water hit her, she thought, &quot;Ick. I was about to masturbate. To Jill-off like a girl,&quot; and feeling conflicted, she adjusted the faucet till she had somewhere between cold and tepid water. Letting her mind wander as she began to work a dollop of shampoo and conditioner into her hair, she mentally went back over the past three days.<br />
<br />
When she&#39;d told her aunt about making the squad, aunt Carol had squealed out, &quot;Congratulations,&quot; in such jubilation that Jessica had found herself joining in, even though she wasn&#39;t sure why she was getting so emotional and excited. Afterward, her aunt had treated her to a meal of her favourite foods and the two had sat about discussing what it meant to be a cheerleader, of which Jessica learned her aunt had been one, but only in her freshman year of high school. Afterward dinner, Jessica told about Tanya, to which aunt Carol found it good that Jessica had already made a friend, and after the dish were put away, inquired, &quot;Is it all right if I go over to Tanya&#39;s,&quot; to which her aunt insisted she should, so long as it was all right with Tanya&#39;s parents.<br />
<br />
When it had been okayed by Tanya&#39;s mom, her dad didn&#39;t really care and left the decision up to his wife, Jessica had gotten directions to where Tanya lived. What had started as a only a visit for the night turned into a two day visit, at the behest of Tanya. From this, Jessica had gotten her first taste at being a girl. Over the course of two days the two had gone swimming, roamed the malls checking out clothing stores, music stores or sat in the food court checking out boys, something that not only bothered Jessica that she was not only doing so, but also that she thought a number of them cute, and sat around at Tanya&#39;s going over the handbook coach Gillian had given them, watching movies, most of them dramas or romances, teasing Henry, Tanya&#39;s cousin who was spending the summer, and generally doing things Jessica felt only a girl would do, including a sleep over with two other girls from the squad the second night that kept them all up until about two.<br />
<br />
When Jessica was finally able to get home on the twenty second, under the excuse of wanting to pack, she had instead sat around and thought of ways to get the remote back. And with every idea she came up, she quickly found a reasons why it wouldn&#39;t work. Eventually giving up for the time being, she instead focused on packing. As she did, she thought about the last two days and how much had happened. How she&#39;d gone from being Jeff to Jessica, and from there fallen into a world that didn&#39;t make much sense, even though she was able to assimilate pretty good.<br />
<br />
&quot;All thanks to a programme,&quot; she thought as she finished her shower and exiting out of the shower, she began to slowly dry herself off.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts going back to the remote, she dumped her towels in the laundry and hamper and headed back into her bedroom. Glad she was no longer feeling so horny, perturbed by what she&#39;d almost done, and the thought of how good it would have felt, Jessica took a dress from her closet, a strapless bra and thong from her dresser and began to get dressed. Doing up the fasteners on the front of her bra, which caused her breasts to take on a fuller appearance, she slipped on the dress and zipping up the hidden zipper on the side, she wondered if maybe she could make some sort of deal with coach Gillian. Slipping on her underwear, trying to figure out what sort of agreement could be reached, she looked in her bedroom mirror and studied her appearance as she went over the possible deals she could offer and the ways she could try and convince the coach to accept them.<br />
<br />
Her mind going back over the past two days, of all the things she&#39;d read on the internet, the dream and the way it had made her feel, she huffed in agitation. Taking some earrings from the jewellery box on her dresser and putting them in her ears, she whispered, &quot;There is no way I can do this. Not for four years,&quot; and thinking, &quot;I need to get that remote back,&quot; she collected her shoes and headed for breakfast, hoping she could convince coach Gillian to come to an agreement before she was sent to camp.</p>
