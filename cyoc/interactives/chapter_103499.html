<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary easily dodged Kelly&#39;s first attack, but that was because she had anticipated it.  But as she ran around the apartment trying to avoid Kelly, she found the game much more difficult this time.  Kelly was so vicious, determined and focused.  And she attacked with an animal-like rage.    It was obvious she playing for keeps this time.  There would be no more catch and release.<br />
<br />
Kelly tore the apartment apart looking for Mary, destroying furniture, appliances and even walls to deny Mary a hiding spot.  Surely the neighbors had heard the commotion and were calling the police.  Someone had to be on the way to rescue her.  But she knew she didn&#39;t have time to wait for help.  If she didn&#39;t try something soon, she would be dead.<br />
<br />
Mary&#39;s lucky break came with a knock on the door. Kelly hissed loudly.  She didn&#39;t want any interruptions.  But as a key rattled in the lock and the door slowly opened it looked like she wasn&#39;t going to have a choice.  <br />
<br />
Mary was surprised to see her landlord standing in the doorway.  He had obviously been called because of the noise,  and had opened the door to investigate.  He now stood in silent shock at the destruction around him.  Holes in walls, smashed appliances, broken counters.  Slowly, he regained his senses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddammit Mary!  What the hell were you doing?  You better come out and give me a real good explanation, or I am gonna call the cops,&quot; said her landlord.<br />
<br />
Mary ran to the door as quickly as she could.  She didn&#39;t know where Kelly was hiding, but she wasn&#39;t about to waste her chance to escape.  And to warn her landlord.  But she was too late.  Kelly rose up from behind the couch, towering above the landlord by resting on the distal tip of her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck.....&quot; said the landlord, as he stared at Kelly in stunned silence.  Then he turned and tried to run.  But the human was much too slow for the snake.  She sprang forward and sank her fangs into the back of his shoulder.  The man winced, then fell to the floor, twitching and drooling.  Mary knew he was lost, and ran past the two of them out the door.  Kelly hesitated, unsure if she should follow Mary or stay with the man.  And that hesitation gave Mary just enough time to slip out the apartment complex and into the streets.<br />
<br />
Kelly hissed.  Her prey was lost, and she was still very hungry.  She dragged the landlord&#39;s body into the apartment and shut the door.  She didn&#39;t want to be discovered.  A least not yet.  She watched the man&#39;s twitching slow, then stop.  She could sense his body cooling, and realized that he was now dead.  She realized that her venom must be very potent, and for some reason this made her excited.<br />
<br />
Her stomach rumbled.  All of this chasing had expended much energy and she was famished.  But she had no prey.  She looked down at the man.  Kelly wanted to turn him into a mouse like Mary, but she doubted the vials would work on a dead person.  <br />
<br />
Bu why do I need them? she thought.  I can just eat him like this.<br />
<br />
The small part of her brain that remained human protested.  But her larger reptilian brain reasoned that she was no longer human so it could not be considered cannibalism.  She slid over to him and opened her jaw wide.  But it was obvious that he was too large to fit.<br />
<br />
Kelly&#39;s stomach rumbled loudly again.  She needed nourishment.  But she couldn&#39;t make the man any smaller.  The potions wouldn&#39;t work on the dead.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly, she had an idea.<br />
<br />
But there is no reason I can&#39;t make myself bigger, she thought.<br />
<br />
She slid over to the box of vials and looked through it.  She found the refilled growth vial, as well as another one that interested her - the female vial.<br />
<br />
Well, it couldn&#39;t hurt to make myself a little more beautiful, she thought with a smile.<br />
<br />
Her remaining small human brain pleaded to use just a little of the vials, but the thought of becoming bigger and more dominant was just too tempting for her reptilian brain.  She downed the entire contents of both vials - first the female, then the growth.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t have to wait long for the changes this time.  Almost immediately she felt her waist narrow and her hips widen.  Her breasts swelled beneath her scales.  Her groin tingled, as her cloacae become tighter and more sensitive.  Kelly was unaware of the changes inside her body.  Her reproductive organs became more fertile, producing twice the number of eggs at twice the rate. She would now lay larger clutches of eggs twice as often. She smelled a strange chemical in the air, and realized that she was now emitting powerful pheromones.  They would bring snakes from miles away to mate with her.  She wondered just how powerful the pheromones were.  Would they affect humans, too?  After all, part of her was still human, albeit a very small part.<br />
<br />
She was suddenly wracked with pain as her whole body then began to stretch and grow.  Kelly assumed it was due to the growth potion, and was disappointed that her growth stopped at double her previous height.  She was unaware that female snakes were larger than males, and that this was just part of the effects of the female vial. She had yet to begin growing form the growth vial.<br />
<br />
But it was enough to allow her to swallow the landlord.  He slid easily into her new larger jaw and body.  But as he settled in her stomach Kelly realized something.  A larger body meant a greater hunger.  She needed more prey for satisfaction.  Luckily, she could smell much more prey in the surrounding apartments.  She slid out the door, just as the growth potion began to kick in, and she began to first of many future growth spurts.</p>
