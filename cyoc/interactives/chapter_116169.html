<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty looked around the classroom but he didn’t see anybody else he could change, so he just put his books back into his backpack and he silently wished for the bell to ring. The bell rung right away, signaling the end of the period, even though it was a few minutes early, but nobody seemed to care. All the students got up and grabbed their books and bags before walking out of the classroom. <br />
<br />
Ty walked outside and sat at one of the table near the patio where he spotted a lady who was sitting there, all by herself. She was staring at her cell phone while she was sitting in the shade, under a tree. Ty focused on her and he learned that this was a substitute teacher for one of the English classes. <br />
<br />
He figured out that her name was Cynthia but everybody called her Cindy. She had just turned 30 and she had a boyfriend of the same age named Eric, who was also a teacher at the school. But, she didn’t like her job because it was too much work and she quietly wished she could be a guy instead of a girl so that she could be fat and lazy and not have to work so hard. Furthermore, she had a fondness for big, heavy guys, like those big, fat, extremely obese football players who were the big blockers or linebackers on the high school football team. These were the guys who weighed over 300 pounds with their big arms, thick legs and fat necks. Nobody could tackle them or bring them down because they were so big, fat and heavy. She really liked big guys who were so incredibly large and heavy. Lastly, Cindy was incredibly fashion-conscious and she liked to wear matching shoes, socks, pants and shirts. Wearing clothes which had matching colors was very, very important to her and she always did her best to look nice, clean, and very color-coordinated. <br />
<br />
So, while Cindy was sitting at the table and while she was playing at her phone and browsing pictures of all the members of the current high school football team, Ty decided to grant her greatest desires by making a silent wish and then by sitting there and to watch the dramatic transformation take place. <br />
<br />
So, the thirty-year-old woman set her phone down as changes started to happen, all over her body. <br />
<br />
Her long, blonde hair started to recede into her head. Suddenly, she only had short, straight blond hair on her head, which barely covered her ears. Her thin, narrow face puffed up a lot, now that she was about to become much heavier thanks to significant weight gain. Her cheeks became thicker and her neck grew wider. <br />
<br />
Her breasts completely disappeared but in their place, she grew a set of mam-boobs. Lumps of fat filled out her chest and her torso as her chest and her stomach rapidly inflated with a large amount of fat all over. Her arms and legs followed suit, growing thicker and heavier all over as well. Her hands and her fingers grew into thick, fat limbs. Her legs were short and incredible wide as they were surrounded by thick layers of fat all over. Her arms were the same, with large slabs of fat hanging from her underarms between her shoulder and her elbow. <br />
<br />
Finally, her pussy disappeared and she gained a thick, large, fat penis with balls instead. But, since her belly had become so wide, she could never even see her cock because her stomach would block her view. She would have to stand up and get before a mirror to see it. <br />
<br />
Ty was watching the amazing transformation from a distance. The attractive middle-aged woman was changing into a very obese 15-year-old boy!<br />
<br />
Now that she had become a he, Ty had to make sure that he was wearing the appropriate clothes. So, he gave him red shorts, white shoes, red socks, and a white shirt. He was completely color-coordinated!<br />
<br />
Since Cindy was now a guy, his name was now Charlie! So, Charlie got up and waddled over to Eric’s classroom, where Eric was sitting all by himself, grading papers. Reality had changed, so Eric had totally accepted Charlie as his boyfriend! <br />
<br />
“Hi, Eric!” Charlie said, as he waddled into the classroom. “Man, it’s so hot outside! I was sweating! And, that walk wore me out! I need to sit down!” the obese boy said as he quickly plopped down on one of the chairs in the front row. <br />
<br />
“Hey there, Charlie! Let me finish grading these papers and then I’ll take you over to my house, okay?” Eric grinned. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ty had followed the entire exchange and he was pleased. Cindy had changed into Charlie and he was still happy to have Eric as his boyfriend!</p>
