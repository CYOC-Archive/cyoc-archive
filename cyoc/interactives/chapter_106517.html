<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen&#39;s morning went quietly. She was up and was there to help Tad get ready for school and walked him to the door to wave goodbye as he ran for the bus. He waved back and then climbed onto the bus. With that, Jen returned to what she would have for the main part of the day. That would relate getting a new start, which she knew she&#39;d have to do. She and Jeff had saved a fair amount of money and the military had excellent benefits packages for veterans which covered a lot of Jen&#39;s moving expenses and helped get the rent for the house that she and Tad were now living in. However, that wouldn&#39;t last forever and wouldn&#39;t be good enough to cover all their expenses, particularly when Tad went to college, which Jen was determined to make sure that her son went.<br />
<br />
That would mean that she would need to find work and have some stable income. Things that related to what happened in Seattle the day before might still be around, and Jen was fairly sure that many in Moon Lake would probably be nervous on that issue, but she was sure that so long as the official police/FBI investigation thought that Lionel Ulysses&#39; tail was a costume that there wouldn&#39;t be any trouble that would be easily beyond what Moon Lake could handle. The town had probably had measures to deal with random reporters, conspiracy theorists, and even cultists for years. The threat of exposure might be there, but for the moment, Moon Lake would be safe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank heaven for small victories,&quot; Jen thought to herself as she walked back into the kitchen/dining area and sat down at the table where she had the morning newspaper set out.<br />
<br />
She sat down and quickly folding out the classified section to see what positions were open and available that Jen knew she was qualified for. She&#39;d gone through College and had a fairly general education though her major had been in math and she had some skills in accounting based on her education, which was an option. It wasn&#39;t the only one, though, as she remembered moving around with Jeff when his unit was moved to a new base or when the Marine Corps transferred him to a new unit that was at a different base. The Marines, being a smaller service and technically part of the Navy Department, didn&#39;t have as many bases as the Army had forts and posts, but it had still meant that Jen had had to move around a fair deal while Jeff was alive and serving his country. In doing that, Jen had held various small jobs. She&#39;d done yard work for a landscaping company, she&#39;d worked part time at a local Walmart for a while, and even as a school secretary for a year, which gave her a fairly  good work record, which she wasn&#39;t that far removed from. She&#39;d only left her last job as part of the move from Quantico to Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
The Moon Lake paper wasn&#39;t necessarily the biggest paper around, but it did have a decent classified section that included all the various job listings that were presently open along with other things that were wanted. Jen sipped her coffee and began to look through the listings in that section of the paper. She quickly found that since it was late October, many of the landscaping companies that did typical summer work weren&#39;t advertising new positions, though not that those positions weren&#39;t the ones that Jen had on her mind first. She figured she would look into a career that fit better with her education or would at least be more with regard to the sort of clerical work that she&#39;d also done before. A part of her even thought to get a job with the school, but since their school year had started, they likely had a full compliment of staff, which meant they wouldn&#39;t be needing a secretary and she didn&#39;t have the education or certification to even consider teaching or administrative type positions. This didn&#39;t leave her with too many choices, but Jen did keep her focus as she ran a finger down the list of potential job openings out there.<br />
<br />
She looked through and found a couple of positions to look for. One was a part time position as a bank teller at a Wells Fargo that had opened in Moon Lake. Another was as an aide to the town&#39;s museum director to handle the museum&#39;s budget, and this was a full time position. She also found a janitorial position open with Tachibana Industries. These were the only ones that were open and fit within her abilities within Moon Lake and she wrote them down at the top of a page in a notebook, including the job, the phone numbers, and the addresses. She then went through the listed jobs that were in areas that weren&#39;t in Moon Lake. Most of these were in Seattle, which wasn&#39;t too terribly far from Moon Lake, but Jen made a point to put down all the openings there that also fit with either her education or her experiences.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... this will look like a good start,&quot; Jen thought to herself as she looked at her list of choices, &quot;now I guess I&#39;ll need to start brushing off my resume and get the job applications... but it&#39;s still a good start.&quot;</p>
