<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m home!&quot; Jeremy shouted as he came in his house. It was unusually quiet, maybe his parents hadn&#39;t arrived yet. He dropped his bag in a chair and took a glass of water. He was watching his magic ring all the time grinning at the idea of becoming someone else&#39;s age.<br />
<br />
&quot;If this thing is real and it can alter reality then... I could be a grown up or a little kid and no one would care about it.&quot; Jeremy thought about swapping age with his father and becoming the man of the house or swapping with sister and getting the attention she got as the little one.<br />
<br />
He was thinking about it that he didn&#39;t notice his mother coming in until they accidentally touched each other in the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry honey.&quot; She apologized when she suddenly stop moving like she was in a trance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, mom. Mom? Mom, what happened to you?&quot; Jeremy said as he watched his 40 years old mother standing still. A mystic glow covered her before it moved inside his ring. Then, his mother started to change, her arms and legs shortened, her breast deflated and her height went down until she looked like any other girl in Jeremy&#39;s class.<br />
<br />
The blue dress she was wearing seemed too big and out of place on her but it immediately started to change into a white blouse and denim blue jeans. Her makeup disappeared and her long nails became shorter. Finally, her shoes turned into sandals and her earrings became simpler.<br />
<br />
It seemed that her transformation had finished but she still didn&#39;t move. Jeremy was agape, he can&#39;t believe that the girl in front of him was his mother. He was going to touch her face when he noticed his ring was growing again and then it shot a light beam to him blinding him momentarily.<br />
<br />
When he opened his eyes again he noticed that his mother was way more smaller than him. He wondered if she had shortened but when he looked at his arms he realized that he had changed instead.<br />
<br />
His thin arms now were thick and hairy and his hands look manly and calloused. Fortunately, the ring had grown to fit in his thicker fingers. He kept exploring his body noticing that his clothes had changed yet. His belly was exposed and he could see a thick layer of hair in there. The hair was even protruding from above and connecting with the hair in his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got a beard!!&quot; Jeremy said and then he stopped when he heard how deep was his voice now. &quot;Woah! I sound like dad now!&quot;<br />
<br />
He kept touching his beard, then his Adams apple and chin. As he did that he also noticed his biceps bulging and the armpit hair under them. He wondered if he was that hairy all over and put his hands on where he expected more hair. His crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh jeez! It&#39;s big!!&quot; He grinned as he cupped his new manhood. He was tempted to undress and watch the goodies but he remembered that his mother was still in front of him. Instead, he kept looking down, noticing his thick and hairy legs and his new size 14 feet. &quot;I wonder how tall I am now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, his small clothing started to change. His tight pants turned into black training short and his ragged shirt became a grey tank top that showed up some of his newly got hair. Finally, a pair of sneakers appeared on his formerly exposed feet completing his outfit. He seemed ready to go to a gym or so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad! Watch your steps! You&#39;re going to fall on me!!!&quot; Jeremy&#39;s younger mother shouted as she began to move again.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry.&quot; Jeremy apologized realizing that his mother&#39;s mind has changed too and now she was his daughter instead. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t got new memories so he had to act accordingly. &quot;I was distracted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see it. Are you going to the gym? Can you drive me to Erika&#39;s home?&quot; She asked as she took a small purse where Jeremy&#39;s bag was a moment ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sure.&quot; Jeremy replied not quite sure if he can drive a car despite his new look. He also wondered if that Erika his daughter was talking about was the same Erika he had a crush on. Then, he followed her as they came out of their house when Jeremy looked at his father coming home.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m too old to be his son now. So, what will happen?&quot; Jeremy thought before his dad noticed his presence.</p>
