<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony was a little surprised when David started trying to tell him what to do using words he didn&#39;t recognize. It occurred to him that police departments might not necessarily train their dogs using all the same words that regular people use to train their dogs. He certainly seemed to understand everything else David was saying. It was all okay, though, because Tony got a little cookie every time he got something right!<br />
<br />
Tony realized that at some point David might start giving him dog treats, and he really hoped he would be able to stomach those. For now, though, his diet was all set up for human digestion, albeit much healthier and more athletic than a typical human diet. Even the little cookies were calorie counted. Naturally, Tony didn&#39;t have to count his own calories or make any choices about his own eating habits in any way. Everything important here was done for him. All he had to do was just do what they told him.<br />
<br />
The only thing that worried him was that his nostrils were starting to feel a bit moist, and come to think of it, they were starting to feel slightly enlarged and separated as well. He hoped he was not starting to get a cold or some kind of hay fever! David seemed to be looking down at Tony&#39;s nose every once in a while, so maybe he was keeping an eye on things and would get him some cold medicine if needed. Tony decided to just keep doing his best at the commands David was teaching him!<br />
<br />
David, meanwhile, had noticed Tony paying more and more attention to scents and less attention to his modesty, so David was already thinking ahead to step three: getting Tony used to as many scents as possible and maybe getting a head start on the actual drug sniffing even before the end of the week. For now, though, it was time to take the training one day at a time. Bonding with Tony and observing his behavior was still priority one.<br />
<br />
Lunch was pleasant for David and almost like an out-of-body experience for Tony. For David, it was a tuna salad sandwich on rye bread with a side of green beans. For Tony, it was beef stew with vegetables in a dog bowl. It certainly wasn&#39;t dog food by any means, but it perhaps wasn&#39;t too far off from some of the things he might eventually be eating later on. He still had the option of sitting at the table and using silverware and napkins to accommodate his human mouth, but David wanted him to start getting accustomed to the kinds of dishes he would be eating out of in his new life. Tony did not really care what he was eating out of. The smell and taste of FOOD was rapidly becoming his reason for being the closer he got to his new canine life. And Tony could smell 100% every individual ingredient that was in the stew. Tony did not immediately notice just how much wider his tongue was, and David wonder if Tony had any idea just how much it would eventually be lengthening as well. David did at least notice Tony taking the last few slurps of the stew with his widening tongue instead of his spoon.<br />
<br />
Tony and David chatted a little bit, although Tony ended up needing some caution avoid biting his wider, flatter tongue while speaking, and after they were finished, they just went out into one of the doggy play rooms to hang out for a while. David petted Tony a little bit, and then Tony would go over to one of the dog toys and start experimenting with how an animal might play with it, and several times David even started playing tug of war with him! For the last few minutes of David&#39;s scheduled time with Tony, he let Tony lean against him and just sort of gently patted Tony&#39;s belly here and there. Tony was loving every instant, hanging out his tongue in mindless pleasure. It was not much longer than a human tongue yet, but it might have been as wide as a dog&#39;s tongue already. It was already as prone to drooling it seemed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know, I think I&#39;m gonna love being a dog,&quot; Tony lazily muttered while lying on his side next to David.<br />
<br />
&quot;I certainly hope so, because it looks like you&#39;re going to be a good one,&quot; David said to him. Tony looked and seemed to be considering something, and then he reached his mouth out and started licking David&#39;s hand. David giggled. &quot;Alright, alright, you can have ONE more cookie, buddy, but that is your allotment for today,&quot; he gave in, bringing out the last final tasty treat with a smile. Tony gulped it down and then even licked up some of the crumbs off of the play room floor. Then he just rolled right back over on the floor for some more attention before his new friend had to leave. David started rubbing Tony&#39;s belly again, and Tony was just really getting relaxed again, when suddenly David&#39;s touched a place that sent an instant shiver through Tony&#39;s body and made him kick his leg out harder than every before! Tony yelped and sat up, trying to figure out what had just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Tony, you okay boy?&quot; asked David, but Tony didn&#39;t answer. He was too busy staring down at his crotch. The sensation had been low enough that he first thought David might have touched his dick or his balls, but it was still too high up on his groin for that. With just a second or too of looking, Tony found the sensitive little bump that was now sitting on one side of his belly, and he even found an identical bump on the other side. He realized that they were every bit as sensitive as too similar bumps higher up on his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nipples?!&quot; he said aloud to no one in particular. David answered him, &quot;Yeah, male dogs have &#39;em, too. I hope that won&#39;t be a problem. We&#39;ve all got &#39;em after all. You&#39;re just going to have a few extra more than you&#39;re used to, is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
With David getting ready to go back to his office and then eventually leave for the day, he said his goodbyes to Tony&#39;s and led the sharp-clawed, wide-tongued, wet-nostriled, four-nippled man back to the temporary housing room for the evening. Tony thanked him for the day and then sat back down on his bed to wait for dinner. He realized his day had been strange and completely different from anything he had experienced as a human, but he also realized he was looking forward to the next.</p>
