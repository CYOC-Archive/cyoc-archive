<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While many aspects of life while going through the present pandemic was rough, there was a lot that remained rather &quot;normal&quot; in an interesting way. One of those things was in the nature of business that had some measure of shaping how Animalia functioned. The big thing was with the Brown farm. While Martin and Josephine were glad to see that Abby&#39;s grades had done well enough to graduate, they also knew that the farm still had a lot to do in order to keep Animalia functioning. They fed most of Animalia&#39;s herbivores with apples and some other vegetables and even had some areas set up as a sort of &quot;farmer&#39;s market&quot; where the Chicken Animalians could sell unfertilized eggs which would in turn help feed the carnivorous and omnivorous Animalians. This kept a lot of things busy.<br />
<br />
However there were times when there were desires and demands for things that weren&#39;t necessarily necessities. The big thing was often chocolate. Normal chocolate, made from the Cacao Bean, carried certain chemicals, like  Theobromine, that could be poisonous to dogs and cats and some other Mammals. It meant that many Humans lost the ability to have chocolate after becoming Animalians, though they still wanted chocolate. This in turn lead to discoveries with the Carob tree, which produced seeds that were similar to those produced by the Cacao tree, but they lacked the Theobromine that was poisonous to various mammals. It had lead to the Carob tree being used to make &quot;chocolate&quot; treats for dogs among other things. <br />
<br />
Now there was some talk of interest from Martin and Josephine Brown in getting some Carob Trees, or at least the seeds for them as a result. However, it did mean some negotiations and negotiations that weren&#39;t exactly easy.  A search online had found a farmer in Greece that had the extra seeds to grow the trees, but they had other questions they needed to figure out. For they needed to know if the Carob Tree could take northern Nevada&#39;s at times dryer climate or its colder winters than what it normally got in the areas where it grew and was naturally prosperous. It took some work, but they were able to eventually get in contact electronically with the Greek farmer who worked exclusively with Carob trees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully he isn&#39;t too startled by us,&quot; Martin said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most people are generally used to Animalians by now,&quot; Josephine assured him, &quot;and he might be quite willing to do business with Animalia... or at least provide some help... assuming that things like international trade opens up again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d prefer that waits until its safe...&quot; Martin gave a short snort as the computer screen clicked on with an icon that gave the man&#39;s &quot;number.&quot; His hand drifted to the mouse and before he clicked on the icon, he added, &quot;hopefully he&#39;s good with English... as I don&#39;t know Greek.&quot;<br />
<br />
They answered to find that the man they were speaking to was not the farmer they had found, but a man in a relatively good looking suit. He had a thick black mustache and a rather warm smile, but wasn&#39;t quite what Martin and Josephine expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello... is this Phillip Appedos?&quot; Martin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexander Napolis,&quot; the man corrected in English, though with a noticeable accent, &quot;Mr. Appedos is someone my company has bought Carob beans from... And we try to essentially make chocolate without using Cacao beans. You are Martin and Josephine Brown... the founders of Animalia? Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re part of Animalia, but not necessarily its founders,&quot; Martin answered.<br />
<br />
Though technically that could be considered true, given the fact that they had been providing Horizon with the animals as part of the government project to produce more productive animals without some of the negative issues that earlier attempts had had. It was only when these experiments went &quot;wrong&quot; that Animalia was born, though more by accident than by design. However, the ones that became Animalians first were Clara and Robbie the first in their family to become an Animalian was Abby. In that neither Martin nor Josephine could feel they could claim to be Animalia&#39;s founders.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were looking into some form of expansion... and with the Carob trees, and thus were looking for the best price and the advice for raising the trees,&quot; Josephine commented, &quot;thus why we expected Mr. Appedos, as he&#39;d do a lot of the farm work for it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... he did share some notes with me, so I would be able to answer some questions,&quot; Mr. Napolis answered, &quot;If you wouldn&#39;t mind answering one of mine...&quot;<br />
<br />
Josephine and Martin glanced to each other and then shrugged before turning back to the computer screen and then nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the interest that&#39;s got you going beyond your own borders?&quot; Mr. Napolis wondered, &quot;the Carob tree grows well anywhere there is a Mediterranean climate, and thus there are growers in southern California that do grow them and in relatively decent numbers. Trading with them, I would think, would be cheaper for you as it wouldn&#39;t take long to get the substitute chocolate from California, you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about your government&#39;s tariffs and travel restrictions... and the distance between California and Lyre/Animalia, Nevada isn&#39;t that great... You&#39;d have easier options available to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re actually looking to do some local growing,&quot; Josephine explained, &quot;and most of the farms in California don&#39;t have the seeds to transfer them. Some of that might be from demands for it as a healthy alternative or for pet treats... while we&#39;d look to be doing this for Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Mr. Napolis said slowly, &quot;and that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking at?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re trying to see if we can get the seeds to plant some Carob trees,&quot; Martin agreed, &quot;but that would also require some information on caring for them. Such as how much water do the trees need? How warm does it need to be and can they handle cold weather?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help there...&quot; Mr. Napolis smiled, &quot;the tree generally grows well in a Mediterranean style climate and can endure droughts. The tree can live with just under ten inches of rain to just under twenty inches of rain a year. And if you&#39;re wanting the trees to be more productive for agriculture, you might only need around twenty two inches of rain a year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin and Josephine glanced to each other for a moment. While they were in the part of the state that actually got the most rain, the state averaged around seven inches of rain a year. That was essentially less than what Mr. Napolis had said what was needed, though this mirrored what they&#39;d had with the apple trees they had planted, though to a greater degree, and they were able to offset those needs with irrigation techniques. Many of which were originally used to make sure their livestock and hay could be watered, but after Animalia started, using it to water the apple trees also worked. The hope was that the same would work with these Carob Trees.<br />
<br />
&quot;The big thing will be on your temperatures,&quot; Mr. Napolis commented, &quot;you will forgive me, but I do not know your climate...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lyre and Animalia are in northwestern Nevada, pretty close to California and Oregon,&quot; Josephine answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our summers can be pretty warm with ninety degree highs and fifty degree lows,&quot; Martin added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ninety degrees?&quot; Mr. Napolis asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ninety degrees Fahrenheit,&quot; Martin answered, &quot;Probably closer to fifty degrees Celsius... but I&#39;m not good with the conversion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Napolis nodded in acceptance of that. That would indicate that Animalia had relatively warm summers.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about your winters?&quot; Mr. Napolis wondered, &quot;while the trees are hearty against drought... they won&#39;t do well in prolonged cold winters. Some areas in Greece in that Mediterranean climate zone might see some snow on occasion... but it won&#39;t last long and particularly on the southern slope of a hill, mountain... but we won&#39;t have blizzards the way you could see further north in Europe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can be a bit different...&quot; Martin said slowly, &quot;our winters aren&#39;t necessarily as cold states like Montana in the winter... as we can get highs of around thirty seven degrees Fahrenheit or around two degrees Celsius and lows of fourteen degrees Fahrenheit or minus nine Celsius. And at times we will get a fair amount of snow in the winter.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that, Mr. Napolis frowned, &quot;then I&#39;m afraid you may have a problem... the trees may actually survive what water you get there... but if you&#39;re getting more than a millimeter of snow and it lasts during the winter... the trees may not survive your winters. In this it may not be worth your time and effort to plant new trees only to have them die of cold in the first winter. And you can&#39;t change your geography. In this, if Carob is what you desire... I&#39;m afraid your solution has to be through trade not through agriculture.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin and Josephine frowned at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I know your neighboring state... California has Carob orchards in the more southern parts of its state, as the farmers there often compete against our farmers here in Greece for the production of the bean,&quot; Mr. Napolis spoke, &quot;and you would do better to do business with them than with me. Especially right now with your government restricting access to your country from Europe outside of following some major hurdles...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin and Josephine nodded, knowing on the travel bans and restrictions that were ongoing in relation to the Corona Virus.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re sorry to have wasted your time,&quot; Josephine gave a sigh in defeat. Trade was an option, and from time to time the markets in Lyre and Animalia did have some Carob treats that had come from California and some of the orchards there, but there was the hope to be able to provide for more in Lyre and Animalia in a way that they would want. But if the trees couldn&#39;t handle northern Nevada&#39;s winters, they also knew that it wouldn&#39;t be worth the work to plant something and then have the first frosts kill it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s never a waste of time to talk with someone who is polite,&quot; Mr. Napolis spoke, &quot;and perhaps... even if I can&#39;t help you get into the business of growing Carob Trees... perhaps we would work out a deal in which we can sell the beans to your markets... or to you and you will then sell the beans second hand... Some prices may change because of shipping and other regulations... but that is business...&quot;</p>
