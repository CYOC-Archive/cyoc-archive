<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly alone I had to stop and pause. This was all very weird. Just as quickly as the girls engaged in sex with me they had left almost as though I were a vending machine that they just used for occasional snacks. Still, it wasn&#39;t unpleasant. I came twice and... I felt my groin absent-mindedly realizing my balls were once again larger. It must have been the work of Lara, though she wasn&#39;t even in the same building this time. Did she have some sort of psychic link? I shrugged, pulling my pants up and heading out the door. Two girls were loitering in the halls talking, both stopping to stare at me as I passed, lusty smiles on their faces. This wasn&#39;t a dream, it was real. I remembered Lara mentioning pheremones, and how she had amplified them. I dared to ask how much. It wasn&#39;t long before I was back at Love Hall, and standing outside while rifling through my pockets to find my key. A girl came along, seeing me struggling and reached into her purse for her own key, opening the door with ease and holding it for me. I thanked her to which she replied &#39;anytime&#39; before grabbing my ass and giggling. I shook off the oddity and headed up the two flights of stairs only to find Charity standing outside her room and looking over some papers in a folder. I froze for a minute, contemplating whether or not I really wanted to talk to her this soon after our awkward encounter. My only alternative, however, was to simply go back down to a lower floor and follow the hallways to the opposite stairwell. Just I was about to turn and pursue my detour, Charity looked up at me and our eyes locked. Too late, now I had to commit so as not to appear rude. Much to my surprise she did not look as uncomfortable as earlier but instead offered an innocent smile and even a slight wave. <br />
<br />
I smiled back and ascended the last few steps before coming face to face with her. &quot;Hey, Jethro. Everything alright?&quot; she asked very nonchalantly, holding her folder to her chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, just uh... helping a classmate move. Seems this floor is really popular huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I guess it&#39;s just one of those things, you know? Seems like a lot of people here know each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
We both nodded awkwardly and then fell into an unsettling silence. &quot;Listen I&#39;m- I&#39;m sorry about last night, with... with you and Derrick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s fine,&quot; Charity smiled, waiving it off like it took place years ago. &quot;I&#39;m sorry it was awkward earlier I just somehow imagined we&#39;d never see each other again and then you showed up at my table and... yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I could move to another floor,&quot; I offered. This is why I never dated in high school, I was always the nice guy that bent over backwards for girls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no... why would you do that? I mean, we&#39;re both adults, right? Besides I, uh...&quot; she stopped looking at me oddly. &quot;Look, could you do me a favor?&quot; she asked suddenly. <br />
<br />
I blinked. &quot;Um... sure...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, I know Derrick and I just broke up last night and I&#39;m not going to lie and say I&#39;m looking for a serious relationship already but I was wondering if you- if we could...&quot; She trailed off before finally moving forward and kissing me. It wasn&#39;t a typical pecking kiss either, as she suddenly went from zero to sixty practically eating my face. She wanted sex, that was clear, as was my answer as my dick grew to full erection within seconds. Hearing no argument, Charity grabbed my shirt and pulled me into her room as I slammed the door behind us. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she gasped breaking away from me and practically tearing off her shirt. &quot;I just felt so bad about last night I could barely sleep and then when I did sleep I just dreamed about you, and when I saw you I just realized how much I want you again and- oh, is he... bigger?&quot; She asked, pulling my pants down and having a look at my erection. She didn&#39;t wait for an answer but simply plunged my length into her mouth and began sucking and stroking with her lips and hands. I had to admit, she had gotten pretty damn good at this. She gripped my hips and began bobbing up and down on my dick. I moaned, feeling the excitement levels rising before it finally gave way to climax. I groaned as I came inside her mouth, Charity accepting it with grace. Something was different about her. The night before she seemed cold an uninterested but now she was skilled as a porn star. I could only guess Lara had something to do with this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mm... that was delicious,&quot; Charity smiled. &quot;Now how about the main course.&quot; She moved over to the bed and stripped what remained of her clothes off and spread her legs wide. I could see her pussy was already wet and decided to oblige her. I stripped myself and got on the bed, priming to enter her. She looked at me with anticipation and cooed as I plunged into her depths. My ministrations were measured steadily growing in speed and intensity until she was clawing at my back from the pleasure. Soon enough she came, and I did shortly after. &quot;More,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I want more. Please...&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled instinctively. &quot;As you wish,&quot; I replied. I can&#39;t remember much after that, only that I filled her again and again until she passed out from exhaustion. The sun was setting and I still wanted to see how Lara was doing so I dressed and left her room.</p>
