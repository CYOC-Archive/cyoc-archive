<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Run! Get out of here! If you stay, you'll never be happy!<br />
<br />
The voices screaming out in the young boy's head were frantic. Jacob Collins was only ten years old when his father had died in a war <br />
overseas. His mother had married again three years later in order to help support him. His stepfather already had a son who he favored <br />
over Jake and was cruel to the boy whenever his mother wasn't around. His stepbrother was just as cruel as his father and bullied Jake <br />
at the school they went to. And now, just weeks after Jake's 15th birthday, his mother had died in a car accident. He would miss his <br />
home, family, and friends, but he knew he couldn't stay. <br />
<br />
He had packed a bookbag with neccessities and some of his most precious possesions before running away. His mom's cross <br />
necklace, his dad's watch, and his art kit. Jake was an amazingly gifted artist. He could draw anything from memory and draw it exactly. <br />
He had planned on going to college to become an animator, but with his stepdad he knew it wasn't possible. <br />
<br />
He first went somewhere he knew well; a playground in the nearest town. There was a store nearby where he bought a map and tried <br />
to decide where to go. He made up his mind and, by the end of the day, he had arrived in the next town. He began to look for a place <br />
to sleep when he saw a building with the back door cracked and light streaming out. He decided to see if the owners would let him <br />
spend the night. <br />
<br />
He walked up to the door and knocked. The door was loose on its hinges and swung open from the knocking. Jake looked inside to find <br />
that the building was actually abandoned. It was an old store that had been cleared out and boarded up. The room Jake had entered <br />
was a small room where the door had fallen off its rusty hinges exposing it to the rest of the building. The light was coming from a <br />
circular hole in the wall. Jake looked inside the hole to see that it was a small, empty room like the one he was in, but he light was <br />
coming from a window through which he saw...daylight!<br />
<br />
Curious and confused, Jake walked through the hole and into the other room. It was even smaller than the one he had been in, just big <br />
enough for the hole, a door, and a small window on one side. He looked out and saw the sun shining down on a city far larger than the <br />
one he had just come from; and somehow...different. He heard voices from the other side of the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mary! I want those tables spotless! Just 'cause our customers eat like pigs don't mean they have to live like 'em!&quot; said a loud male <br />
voice sounding similar to Danny Devito. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, your majesty,&quot; came a sarcastic, Brooklyn-accented fenale's voice, &quot;I'll tell the dust to settle somewhere else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I don't need no wise cracks from waitress who can't even work a cash register!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack decided he would try knocking on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What is it? I thought we were done with this!&quot; the man said angrily as the door opened. <br />
<br />
Jake's mouth dropped as he saw who had been talking. In the doorway stood a pikachu with a cigar in its mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a kid! A freakin' kid!&quot; he complained, &quot;Alright, where's Marty? This is the last straw!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pokemon pushed past Jake to the hole and jumped through. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Marty, I told you I ain't doin' this shit no more!&quot; he yelled until he saw that the place was abandoned.<br />
<br />
The creature came back into the room where Jake stood and looked up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, how'd you get here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I ran away from home,&quot; Jake explained, &quot;I was looking for a place to sleep and the door was open. I came in to ask if I could sleep <br />
there, but it was abandoned. I saw the sun coming through the hole there and wanted to check it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, poor kid,&quot; came the female voice as into the doorway came a big-busted cartoon woman with a navy blue jogging suit, frizzy black <br />
hair, hoop earrings and too much makeup. &quot;Look at 'im Franky, the little guy's scared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, no, no! I ain't taking no runaway in!&quot; the pikachu argued. <br />
<br />
&quot;He ain't askin' for ya leg, he's askin' for a place to sleep!&quot; she said angrilly and took Jake by the arm. &quot;Come on in, sweetie, make <br />
ya'self at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you deaf?&quot; the pikachu said, &quot;I said he ain't comin' in here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he's in ain't he?&quot; she gave him an &quot;I beat you&quot; stare. <br />
<br />
The pikachu stopped to think about that while he closed the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright, fine! But if he stays, he works!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He can work later. The kid looks exhausted, let him sleep in the back.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman led a confused Jake through the bar he found himself in to a door next to the bar. Once inside, she indicated an old couch. <br />
<br />
&quot;You can sleep in here, doll, just make yaself comfy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks,&quot; Jake said, &quot;But, can I ask you something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that's right, you came through the portal. You're prob'ly all confused. This is ToonWorld, hun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ToonWorld?!&quot; he repeated in shock.<br />
<br />
Jake had read about scientists connecting with parallel universes a few years ago. He had heard that ToonWorld was one of the most <br />
popular. It was a place where everything worked like a cartoon and the laws of physics were warped. It was also a place where <br />
anything drawn on Earth was instantly copied to. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, kid, this is ToonWorld alright. But you just get some sleep and we'll talk later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
ToonWorld, Jake wondered to himself, Well I guess if you're going to run away from home you might as well go to another dimension.</p>
