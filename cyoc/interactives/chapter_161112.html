<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It is getting dark,&quot; Rob stated the blatantly obvious as he and Amy Nettles stepped out the Nettles&#39; front door and onto their front step.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it is November,&quot; Amy said playfully over to him and elbowed his shoulder a bit, almost giggling as it made his backpack shake a little, &quot;the sun goes down earlier this time of year.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two came down the front step from the Nettles home to see that the sun had set and a blanket of stars was hovering over a small town in Washington state. It had been a situation that had its fair share of mysteries, particularly given how many of the girls Rob had seen at school looked and then combined with the story that his sister Rachel had given him on the reason for that being that those girls were likely weres of some kind and her explanation being that a friend of hers had already become a were. At first, it struck Rob as something of an elaborate prank, though as he looked over to Amy, the notion of that being a prank were much lower.<br />
<br />
The female wereskunk stood beside him calmly and quietly, and other than taking off her shoes and socks, she was in her were form with her long black and white striped tail hanging limply behind her. That was more than enough to prove to Rob that weres were real, and while Amy had been a bit playful with him, she had also been friendly and didn&#39;t seem to mind some of times where most girls that Rob had known in the past would call him a pervert for. In fact, Amy had also said she was looking for more than just a sexual partner, which surprised Rob that she would be so comfortable with that, as for the most part for him... the subject always seemed &quot;dirty.&quot; That said, Rob also wasn&#39;t going to turn down a beautiful girl wanting him to be her boyfriend, even if she was a were and her were form was a skunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention between helping you understand that no one was pranking you and getting nervous about my dad being overly protective didn&#39;t necessarily help you get your home work done quickly,&quot; Amy gave an added giggle as they walked out from the front step and toward the sidewalk in front of the Nettles home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which you had great amusement at,&quot; Rob commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad enjoyed it too!&quot; Amy giggled, &quot;but see... that&#39;s a lot of the fun about Moon Lake. Sure some of us may look a bit different... and can do somethings normal humans can&#39;t do... but deep down, we&#39;re ultimately the same anyone else you&#39;ve ever met.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob gave a slight nod when a loud roar came from across the street, and seemed to come from the woods behind a row of houses. It was soon accompanied by another shortly after. Amy initially turned only one ear to it, as it was something that she was fairly used to, and she was also thankful that the walls in her home were well insulated to muffle the sounds her parents made after dinner. Of course, wereskunks couldn&#39;t roar, but that didn&#39;t mean they made love silently. However, she did notice that Rob had slowed his pace and was largely looking in the direction from which the roar had come from.<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds like a couple of werelions or weretigers got started a little early this evening,&quot; Amy said slowly, &quot;or maybe a werebear... I can&#39;t really tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Outside...&quot; Rob said slowly, &quot;so is it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we&#39;re perfectly fine,&quot; Amy assured him, &quot;they&#39;re just having some adult fun, as it were. In this, they&#39;re not threatening anyone...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But outside?&quot; Rob asked as they walked along.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s one of those things that weres can and will enjoy from time to time,&quot; Amy gave a knowing smile, &quot;sex is... well... rather popular with weres, and often especially with new weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like after they get old enough to transform?&quot; Rob wondered, thinking on some of the things that Amy, her mother, and her father had explained on were development.<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly... but especially for any normal human that becomes a were,&quot; Amy explained as she lead him along and making sure he didn&#39;t wander off the sidewalk and into the street. The street was presently quiet, but she could hear some cars in the distance over the roars coming from the woods, and knew that accidents could and did sometimes happen. &quot;Normal people can become weres in one of three ways... being bitten, being scratched, or through sex. Usually the last of the three is the most popular... and regardless of which, once the transformation begins, it must be completed and that generally DOES require sex between the new were and the were that changed the human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds kinky,&quot; Rob said slowly as they approached the corner that was opposite the Van Direstag home.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be,&quot; Amy shrugged, &quot;and functions similarly to what most weres do with born weres when their first transformation approaches. It helps their body go through all the physical changes with a minimum of pain and discomfort. Though in the process, from what my mom has told me... is that that process also introduces into the new were all the natural instincts and potential behaviors of that were-species into the new were. And it can be quite rapid...&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob looked across the street, and while there were some lights in the distance, they were at a stop sign and had the right of way, &quot;Sounds risky...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if one isn&#39;t prepared,&quot; Amy assured him, &quot;and is one of the reasons why, while Moon Lake has the Mandatory Were Law, we also have rules against forcing the change on anyone else. And often when looking into those following the Mandatory Were Law, that it goes through City Hall so that the person can meet with representatives and get all the ins and outs on that species... and going beyond just the guidebook. It helps them prepare. Others may change because they fall in love with the were that changes them... though that&#39;s also the case in which the human involved has learned about their boyfriend or girlfriend&#39;s were-species and thus are better prepared for it... and thus have more self control after their transformation completes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But once the transformation is complete they should be fine?&quot; Rob wondered as they crossed the street and moved toward the Van Direstag home, which had a light or two on in the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming the person is ready for that influx of instincts that go along with the were they&#39;ve become,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;those who may be particularly driven in some respect... but not necessarily ready for certain instincts may be easily overwhelmed by them as they come in with the same strength to match as whatever drive they might have had before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meaning if they reject weres quite firmly...&quot; Rob began thinking on how his father had seemed to reject them the previous afternoon when Rob and Rachel had returned home. At that time, his father had seemed to be overly against things like the Mandatory Were Law if not weres in general.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... enjoying being a were once the transformation is completed would be the case with any were, regardless of their normal personality,&quot; Amy spoke, getting some personal wonder if there was something Rob wasn&#39;t telling her. But it wasn&#39;t her place to try and make any judgements based on the fact that she only knew Rob from two days a school and talking with him on her couch after the second day at school. &quot;But that transformation could bring a high state of euphoria... for both born weres completing their first transformation and for normal humans after their transformation is completed. I that... I suppose someone that may have rejected things before that transformation is completed may be on a greater high than is normal... or someone was drugged before they became a were... that might also raise the post transformation euphoria... but my mom would really be the one to ask THAT question.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy then took Rob&#39;s hands in hers softly, and made sure that her claws didn&#39;t scrape Rob&#39;s skin in the slightest. He gave a weak smile at that, which gave Amy some sense of comfort, though she was trying to comfort him at the moment<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
Rob felt a bit better at the question. He couldn&#39;t really explain it, as he&#39;d never had a pretty girl actually talk to him like this before. Some back in Michigan might have flirted a bit because they were teenagers and were open to some form of experimentation, though Rob never got that far, often because Rachel and her friend Melissa ended up walking him home in the past. Others avoided him altogether because his attempts at flirting came off as week and he eventually shied away because he didn&#39;t want to come off too strong. Amy seemed to be somewhere between those two extremes. She was very flirtatious at times, but at the same time, she also seemed to care, and as she held his hands, the part of her that seemed to care made him feel even better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Rob answered as he gave her hands a squeeze and feeling how soft Amy&#39;s fur felt. It wasn&#39;t soft and fluffy the way long haired cat&#39;s fur would be, but it was still rather soft and that felt rather nice. &quot;It&#39;s probably just some jitters that go on between being new to town and having to deal with the Mandatory Were Law and all that... all the new stuff that I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen before. Thinking I was getting pranked and then having to think things over. Which you did help with... though there&#39;d still be a lot to think about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded and then pulled him into a hug, with her arms around him and her fingers pressed against his backpack, &quot;and don&#39;t worry... you&#39;re safe here. And don&#39;t rush into anything. The big thing is that once you become a were... regardless of what kind... you cannot go back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Rob managed and kissed Amy&#39;s check, even though her fur tickled his lips a little, &quot;see you tomorrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Amy smiled and they parted ways.<br />
<br />
With that, Rob went in to find Rachel and Frank seated in the living room as another set of roars rose again from the area behind their house. He stood there with a bit of a dopy grin on his face and said to his older siblings, &quot;She likes me.&quot;</p>
