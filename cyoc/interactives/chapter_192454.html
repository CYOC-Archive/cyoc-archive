<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You turned to say something to John, but Laura quickly flew towards John, summoned a wand out of nowhere, and tapped his nose with it. <br />
<br />
“There. I chose first!” She yelled, excitedly. <br />
<br />
Before you could react, Christine already had her wand touching your chest. <br />
<br />
Christine’s magic was very weak. You could tell that she lacked any real magical source. Any semi-competent magic user could have resisted her spell. Unfortunately, while you had the knowledge to know how to form counter spells, you lacked any technique to apply them. You still tried anyways. <br />
<br />
“Contera! Contre! Urg, I mean Contra!” You shout, trying to use the proper movements and tone for the spell to work. Unfortunately the effects of Christine’s spell started to take effect. <br />
<br />
The speed and accuracy of transmutation spells is dependent on the amount of magic stored in a magic user’s body. Magic users all have a base amount of magic, that increases the more they practice their magic, along with increasing with their age. Magic users can also increase the amount of magic they can use by pulling from items that have magical energy to them. While this energy can be mined in magic caves or stolen from monsters, it can also come from the soul of a magic user. Transmutating a rival magic user was seen as a form of humiliation, and intense rivals would often make the effects permanent. This practice was formerly banned in most cities, though a ban could not be enforced outside. <br />
<br />
Christine was 21 years old, which is very young for a magic user. Her base storage of magic in her body was naturally low, similar to you. She also lacked any items with magical properties, with the exception of her wand. This meant that your transformation was going to be slower, unlike the transformations you witnessed back in Stonewood. You had hope that John could resist transformation before his was complete, but you lacked any hope for yourself. <br />
<br />
It started with your clothes. Your jeans, shoes, socks, everything became instantly tighter. Each fiber and string slowly poking through your skin, until they were one in the same. This process lasted 6 seconds, which was already longer than any of the spells you saw in the Stonewood auditorium. However, this still wasn’t enough time for you to recite the counter spell in time before the next part. <br />
<br />
You felt black fabric form from various parts of your body. Among these parts, was the bottom of your lip, which tightly connected with the top lip, tightly sealing your mouth. All you were capable of doing was making muffled noises, which would’ve made the counter spell impossible, unless you were skilled enough to cast magic without speaking. You weren’t. <br />
<br />
The fabric used on you is one of magical origin. It does not exist in the mortal world. It is thick, and lacks flexibility, but it is also tough and capable of storing lots of magic. It is the preferred fabric for those who prefer to keep a distance from their targets. It is also capable of sparkling as if it had sequences on it, though the wearer can prevent this effect from showing. <br />
<br />
Other spots where this fabric suddenly appeared were your eyelids, knees, feet, and fingers. For stronger spells, the effects hit the entire body at once, but for weaker spells like this, only some parts can transform at the same time. For your eyelids, the fabric closed your eyes shut and started to merge with your eyeballs. This surprisingly didn’t blind you, because you maintain magical properties that keep your senses. <br />
<br />
For your fingers, the fabric merges each finger together, lining them up open palmed. For your knees and feet, the fabric merges your legs together. <br />
<br />
The process of fabric forming feels like a little sting in the spots they formed. Each sting lasts for a short enough time that it doesn’t cause immense pain, but when enough stings are happening at the same time, it feels irritating. When the fabric merges two body parts together, there is a similar sting. The difference is that it also itches like a rash. This process lasted 10 seconds before the next part. <br />
<br />
Before your body was consumed by the fabric, you started to feel pressure throughout your body.  The pressure started on the top of your head, and spread to the bottom of your chest. The force “squished” your head into your chest, leveling your scalp with your shoulders. This force of pressure felt like getting squeezed a little bit too hard. It hurt, but it wasn’t as painful as something like getting ran over. When your head started to mush with your chest, both parts started to go through a process of flattening. This happened because the organs under the skin/fabric started to turn into fabric itself and merge with the skin. This stings just like the process on your skin. This lasted for 4 seconds. <br />
<br />
Throughout this transformation, your body stood upright, despite having no ability to properly stand anymore. You realized that you were floating in the air while this transformation occurred. <br />
<br />
Your legs, arms, and crotch went through this same process of flattening, eventually to the point where your whole body became a weirdly shaped, long, flat fabric. It took 3 seconds. <br />
<br />
You noticed that the fabric towards your feet and on your arms was a lot more similar to lace. Although a lot more thinner than the other fabric and less opaque, it is still tough and not flexible. You also noticed that you haven’t shrunk much, with shoulders to toes being the same height as Christine’s shoulders to toes. <br />
<br />
You weren’t wearable quite yet at that time. You needed one more step to be completed. <br />
<br />
Your “leg” started to wrap behind you first, merging together causing the rash like feeling. Your “skirt” actually was fairly tight, which would limit the movement of its wearer. Slowly, this merging occurs all the way until your shoulders, in which forms into a neckline. Two circular holes form right next to your “sleeves” which the ends of the sleeve fabric started to merge into. The merging of your sleeves was the final part of your transformation. This entire process was the fastest, lasting only 2 seconds. Christine walked up to your floating body and immediately put you on. <br />
<br />
The second you were first worn, magic energy began to flow from your body into Christine’s, numbing your senses. Despite no longer having a brain, you were still able to think, and maintain all the senses you had while human. Magical energy from your soul still remained in this form, and would continue to replenish itself theoretically for eternity. Similar to animate magic users, magic clothes and accessories continue to accumulate more magic energy as it ages. Even as your energy flew into Christine, you knew that you would always continue to remain conscious. <br />
<br />
“Now let’s see how you look on me,” Christine said. She walked towards a window and you could see yourself in the reflection. You were a black dress with a skirt reaching almost to the ground, with lace-like long sleeves. You looked fairly conservative for a magic user’s dress, which usually is more revealing. However, you were still a tight dress on Christine, showing off her wide hips and supporting her decently sized boobs. You felt especially tight on those two locations. <br />
<br />
“It looks beautiful, but it needs something still. Ah,” Christine said. She snapped her fingers, and you can see yourself start to sparkle, as if there were sequences on you. The difference was that nothing additional was added to your body, and the effect was much more mesmerizing.<br />
<br />
Having your fabric touched by her felt soothing, like you were gently being rubbed. Everytime your fabric was rubbed by her hairless body, you felt pleasure in those spots. Despite being a dress that restricts mobility, you wanted Christine to move, to make you feel pleasure. Unfortunately, Christine’s long hair prickled your back and left it feeling irritated. <br />
<br />
Your inability to move or speak was the worst part. You felt so defenseless, so weak, and honestly very claustrophobic. This paralysis gave you the worst bits of panic that you have ever felt. Since there was no way to express this panic, it built up more and more. <br />
<br />
You heard a voice. It was Christine’s. “Calm yourself, my beautiful dress. I will keep you in good company and treat you well. I didn’t want to do this to you, but I had to in order to survive. So I’ll make sure you remain happy.” Her words caused you to ease a little, but still felt the worst panic of your life. <br />
<br />
She spoke telepathically to you. You try to do the same. “Can you hear me?” You think. <br />
<br />
“Yes, but only when I choose to, so make sure I’m listening. I’m going to check on Laura now, so I’m tuning you out,” Christine said, telepathically. <br />
<br />
You couldn’t tell how John was doing that entire time. You almost forgot about him. You hope he escaped, or better yet, took out Laura and is coming to save you.</p>
