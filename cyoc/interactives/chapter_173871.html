<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The real Clover was trying to hide his enormous erection as his fiance, formerly Bill but for the next week &quot;Clover&quot; climbed into bed beside him. She looked so sexy in that nightie. That had been a good purchase. The new &quot;Bill&#39;s&quot; dilemma was how to get &quot;Clover&quot; to relax enough to agree to be fucked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bill&quot; knew that the new &quot;Clover&quot; was attracted to his body. A persons sexual preferences remained with the body so he knew that &quot;Clover&quot; found his current body almost irresistible. However &quot;Almost&quot; was the key word and he knew he could not force the situation. The nightie he had convinced the former Bill to wear didn&#39;t hide her erect nipples. The new &quot;Bill&quot; recognised that &quot;Clover&quot; was hot for him. It was very hard not to jump her and force his way. &quot;Clover&quot; would not resist and before long would be enjoying the experience, however to do so would be against every principle that the true Clover stood for. He would have to be patient and wait for &quot;Clover&quot; to initiate sex.   <br />
<br />
He just wished that wouldn&#39;t take too long. They only had 7 days in each other&#39;s bodies.<br />
<br />
He waited until his fiance was in bed beside him. He held his own hands to stop himself from touching &quot;Clover&quot; then asked &#39;So go ahead and ask away. What would you like to know?&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;A lot&#39; &quot;Clover&quot; replied. &#39;You told me you were Uncle Eric last year. Who else have you been?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I was uncle Eric last year. The year prior I was Mum&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Your Mum? Peggy?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yep. And the year before that I was my cousin Stacey&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;The cousin who Charlie has become this year?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes that&#39;s right. And the year before than was my first on the adult table and I became Gerard&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Who&#39;s Gerard? Have I met him?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;He was on the other table. Married to Aunt Beth, uncle Eric&#39;s youngest daughter. Remember Stephen the boy who became a cheerleader, his father. Relatively short with dark hair&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe? I remember the boy who became a cheerleader&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t worry you will meet him some time this week. The real Gerard is your sister Michelle for the next week&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;So this is not your first time being an adult male?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well no. I told you I was also Uncle Eric and when I was about 9 I spent a week as Simon when he was 17&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Did you....? Have you ever had sex in a different body?&#39; Clover liked that Bill had bought up the subject of sex. It was clearly on her mind.<br />
<br />
&#39;No actually. Only in that body you now possess. I&#39;m a virgin as a male or in another female body&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;What? You didn&#39;t even masturbate?&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s not what you asked. I haven&#39;t had sex with anyone else when I&#39;ve been in a different body. You try spending a week in a 17 year old boy&#39;s body and not jack off&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;So where do the single adults sleep? It seems to be only couples and families in this wing&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;In the other wing there are share rooms for single males and for single females. When I became Gerard I moved out of my bed in a girls room and into one of the male rooms. When I was Uncle Eric I moved into his room&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;What&#39;s the best swap you have ever had?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Today. I don&#39;t ever remember being this excited. I love the idea of being you and I love that you are me&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;So what do we do for the next week. I had imagined going bush walking, fishing and maybe a trip into town if I got tired of constantly being with your family&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;We still go bushwalking and fishing and do all the sorts of things people do when spending a week in the mountains. There is also horse riding and swimming if we get a warm day. And I would be more than happy to have a trip into town. Maybe we could go dress shopping?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Swimming?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes. You will find a bikini in the wardrobe&#39; He let &quot;Clover&quot; contemplate that. &#39;If the weather isn&#39;t so great there is a games room and there are activities just for the girls. You might be interested in make-up lessons and we have several hairdressers in the family. You might want to try a new hairstyle&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I like your hair as it is&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Totally up to you. It&#39;s your hair now. You can do what you like with it. Even shave it off. When I get my body back It will be exactly as I was when I touched the stone. If we wanted we could get ourselves tattooed, they would be gone once we change back&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;So your saying I could chop off my hand and it wouldn&#39;t harm you at all?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well I wouldn&#39;t recommend chopping off your hand. That might hurt but yes you can do what you like with that body. It&#39;s not technically my body. Last year Kimberly was &quot;Clover&#39; and she got a blonde perm and a nose ring. When I got my body back I was my usual self. I have some ideas about what I might do with this body - if I do something radical don&#39;t you get upset. You will get your own body back as it was&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Okay I will admit I am curious. Any hints?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No. I think you will be surprised. Maybe even a little bit shocked. Anyway it&#39;s late and you need to be up early. I suggest we turn off the light and try to get some sleep&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well we can try. I must admit I am mentally tired&#39; said the real Bill in her sexy feminine voice. &#39;You&#39;re the man. You can get up and turn off the light&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;My pleasure. My Lady&#39; Clover got up and turned off the light. When he got back into bed he lay down carefully not touching &quot;Clover&#39;. He was dying to but knew he had to refrain. <br />
<br />
Bill got a glimpse of the bulge in Clover&#39;s crotch as he got up to turn off the light and knew he was ready for sex if Bill so desired. She was very pleased that Clover was not forcing the situation.<br />
<br />
They lay there awkwardly in the dark for what seemed like ages but was probably only a minute. Before &quot;Clover&#39;s&quot; hand sought out &quot;Bill&#39;s&quot;</p>
