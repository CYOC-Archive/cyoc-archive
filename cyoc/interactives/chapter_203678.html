<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ever since she&#39;d been a little girl, Shannon Smith had known she wanted to be a mother. As a child she loved playing with dolls and the feeling of being responsible and smart that she got from it, and as she got older she grew to really enjoy getting to help and care for others, particularly young kids who needed her to help them with stuff at school and that kind of thing.<br />
<br />
When she hit puberty, a different and less innocent dimension came to it. She developed a fetish she kept private from everyone: a breeding kink. Much as she knew she was much too young to act on it, the idea of someone fucking her, cumming inside her and getting her pregnant turned her on a lot. One thing she did like to do that was a clue to her fetish and fascination was find out whether guys she liked wanted kids someday too- if they didn&#39;t, that was kind of a dealbreaker to her.<br />
<br />
Thankfully Shannon eventually found a guy in college who did, and who she got on really well with. His name was Ollie, and he was sensitive, patient and in her opinion very handsome. They started dating quite soon after they met, and a few months after they had both graduated and gotten decent-paying jobs, Ollie proposed to her and she accepted. A few months after that they had a wonderful wedding, and that night when Ollie offered to consummate their marriage, Shannon decided to tell him about her fetish at last and asked him if they could do it without protection. Ollie agreed, and the sex that followed was the best experience Shannon had ever had up to that point. Getting to see her husband&#39;s handsome body above her as he fucked her, and feel his firm hands against her flesh and his cock fill her with the wondrous warmth of skin-on-skin contact, was beyond amazing for her, and after she felt his shaft pulse and his warm seed fill her up, she cuddled him to her and dozed off, certain that as she slept she would conceive a beautiful child for them to love.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t how things would pan out for her and Ollie. Despite all her worries and desire about impregnation, Shannon hadn&#39;t gotten pregnant from that night. A few weeks after they returned from their honeymoon, she admitted to Ollie that she wished she had, and Ollie tried to reassure her that it was OK- one day, they&#39;d have a child, or maybe a bunch of children if she wanted, he said. He also agreed to keep having raw sex with her to see if she could get pregnant, but soon both of them were growing frustrated. Sometimes Shannon would feel sick and tired after having had sex, but she soon came to realize this was nothing to do with having gotten pregnant.<br />
<br />
Eventually they decided to get some medical advice about what was going on, and eventually the doctors explained that Shannon was not ovulating during her periods, so there was no egg to fertilize. Shannon was devastated, but they explained it meant she could get treatment, though there was a long waiting list and it was rather expensive.<br />
<br />
The night they gave her the diagnosis, Ollie comforted her and they spent a while just cuddling and watching stuff together. After some time, Shannon noticed her husband had an erection, and decided to stroke it through his jeans. In response, Ollie reached to her chest and cupped her breast through her shirt, making her pant.  Soon they escalated this to making out, and then to undressing each other. Once they were both naked, Ollie hesitated for a moment. &quot;Are you sure you wanna do this?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Shannon smiled. &quot;Even if we can&#39;t have sex to make a baby, I still want to have sex with you, babe! You&#39;re cute, and handsome, and you have an amazing cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ollie blushed and then pushed his shaft inside her. The horny young woman moaned as he pounded in and out eagerly, and clung to him while he held her down and thrusted passionately. At last he groaned and came, pumping every drop of his seed inside her.<br />
Unbeknownst to Shannon and Ollie, Ty&#39;s egg form had implanted in Shannon&#39;s womb that evening, and promptly got fertilized and impregnated Shannon.<br />
<br />
A few days after their lovemaking, Shannon had begun to feel nauseous and drowsy again. She figured it might just be her depression returning, but it felt different this time. And so, one morning she went to the bathroom, found a pregnancy test and peed on it. After a minute or so, it turned the colour for &#39;pregnant&#39;. Shannon double-checked she wasn&#39;t just too tired she was reading it wrong, but no- it really was the &#39;pregnant&#39; colour. <br />
<br />
She raced out of the bathroom to show Ollie. In nine months, they would have a...</p>
