<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen finally found her sock as she heard a car pull into her driveway. Looking out the window, she smiled when she saw Mike, one of her boyfriends, jump out of the car of Collin, another boyfriend. She also Aaron and Zach, her other two boyfriends, in the back seat. She raced downstairs to see Mike already through the front door.<br />
<br />
Mike was a running back for the high school football team. He was 5'10&quot; and weighed about 195 pounds. He had a kind smile, very short, light brown hair, green eyes, and a light tan. His most prominent feature was his pecs, which protruded out several inches. He often joked that if they got any bigger, he would need to start looking for bras. He knew about Jen dating the other three guys. He cared for her deeply and would accept her faults, almost to the point of ignoring them completely. Although he never told Jen, he truly felt that he loved her.<br />
<br />
Aaron was a wide receiver, was 6'1&quot;, and weighed about 210 pounds. He had very wide shoulders, thick, muscular arms, small little dimples when he smiled, blond hair that touched his ears, brown eyes, and very white skin. No matter how much he tried, he couldn't get a tan without getting burnt to a crisp. He knew about Jen dating Collin, and Zach. Aaron had a self-esteem issue that Jen used to her advantage, saying that he must be pretty special if she wanted him to be her third boyfriend. His self-esteem issue stemmed from the fact that he was secretly bisexual and preferred guys more than girls. No one, not even his most trustworthy friends (and certainly not Jennifer), knew that secret.<br />
<br />
Collin was a linebacker, was 5'11&quot;, and weighed about 265 pounds. He had a massive build, to say the least. He had wide shoulders, a muscle gut, a thick chest and back, arms the size of a football, and huge quads and calves. He had intense blue eyes, dark brown hair in a buzz cut, a dark tan, and a cocky grin that made anyone, even straight guys, melt a little on the inside. He only knew about Jen dating Zach at the same time she was dating him. Having a massive ego, he often voiced to Jen that he should be her only boyfriend. But, out of respect, and perhaps fear that she would dump him, never expressed his opinion to Zach. His deep, dark secret, though, was that he had a very small cock, only about 4 inches long when hard. He was also in denial about his homosexuality yet had a little crush on Aaron, getting aroused if he stared at Aaron in the locker room for a second longer than he knows he should.<br />
<br />
Zach was the star quarterback and was the hottest guy in the entire school. He weighed about 180 pounds of pure muscle and was 6'0&quot;. His arms, chest, and thighs were the most muscular parts of his body. He had a sexy face, brilliant green eyes, a rich and deep tan, and short, dark brown hair. There were many rumors going around the school that he was going to become a model for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch in the summer next year. Jen was very attracted to his body, deeming him the hottest of all her boyfriends. He was oblivious to all of Jen's exploits with the other guys. Jen didn't really like his personality - he was relatively clueless in her opinion - which was why she started to date other guys on the side.<br />
<br />
Jen skipped up to Mike and kissed him briefly after saying, &quot;Hey there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; he replied, winking at her. They were about to kiss again when Zach raced inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe,&quot; Zach said, kissing Jen. &quot;I need to piss like a race horse. Do you mind if I use your bathroom real quick?&quot; Jen shook her head, and he took off down the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are we still on for tonight?&quot; Mike asked Jen, wrapping his arms around her.<br />
<br />
She nodded and said, &quot;It will have to be here though. I gave an excuse to Aaron that I had too much homework.&quot; As if she would ever do homework on a Monday!<br />
<br />
&quot;What did he want to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to the movies tonight,&quot; she answered. &quot;He's going with Collin instead.&quot; They heard Zach come out of the bathroom, and she pulled away from Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll see you in the car,&quot; Mike said, Jen completely oblivious to the dejection in his face. He walked out as Zach walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ready to go?&quot; Zach asked.<br />
<br />
Jen was about to nod, but she felt something take over her. A strange force that was completely foreign to her body. She felt her mind being pushed into the back seat and just watched as she looked up into Zach's face and ask, &quot;Not quite. Transform or Dare?&quot; She then lunged at him, kissing him passionately.<br />
<br />
Zach was unprepared for the question but forgot what it was as soon as Jen started kissing him. He felt his dick swell up with blood, and his lycra muscle shirt tightened a little. But he paid it no mind. He moaned as a small wave of pleasure washed over him. Then, a minute later, Jen pulled away and looked at him with a weird glint in her eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since you didn't answer in time, Zach, you get both,&quot; Jen replied, the words completely surprising to both Jen and Zach. &quot;Firstly, for your dare, after I am finished you will ask me Transform or Dare. When I answer Dare, you will dare me to forget this conversation and to ask you Transform or Dare again, to which you will answer with Dare. When we get to school, you will go find Kyle Perkins. For your transformation, you will become a gay bodybuilder who has the hots for Kyle. Your mind will change first while we are heading to school. Your body will change the closer you get to Kyle. Your transformation will complete when you find Kyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fu-?&quot; Zach began to ask before stiffening up. &quot;Transform or Dare, Jen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ask me Transform or Dare again. After this conversation, you will forget everything about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare, Zach?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen smiled before continuing, &quot;You will forget this conversation and also fall madly in love with Kyle Perkins as soon as you see him.&quot; Finally, the strange force left her body. She couldn't believe what she had done. How could she have...what did she do again? That's right! She just kissed him and was about to tell him that she was ready. A strange, alarmed look faded from Zach's eyes as he looked expectantly at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; she answered. &quot;All ready to go!&quot; She handed him her bag and walked out of her house.<br />
<br />
She approached the car and saw Collin, Aaron, and Mike all squished into the back seat. A strange force took over her and, just as she was about to greet Collin and Aaron, she leaned her head through the window. What was even weirder was that they both leaned in to meet her. She kissed them both for about a second and withdrew her head. The force left her and became alarmed that Collin would get angry at Aaron kissing her. But they just smiled at her and exchanged greetings before continuing their conversation like nothing strange just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Zach asked as he came around the car after putting her bag in the trunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; Jen replied hesitantly. &quot;Did you see that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See what? You and them kiss?&quot; Zach inquired nonchalantly. Jen's eyes widened and nodded. &quot;You're always like this. That's how you're supposed to greet someone. It's when you kiss a second time that it becomes romantic. Why does it bother you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...don't...know,&quot; she answered slowly before getting into the car. Had it really always been that way? Since the others weren't concerned about it, why should she then? She shrugged it off and readjusted her bra which felt a little loose as Zach pulled out of the driveway.</p>
