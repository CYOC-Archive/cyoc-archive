<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hai, I'm Home!&quot; a loud feminine came from the hallway, followed by a the sound of a closing door.<br />
<br />
Dan rose up immediately &quot;Yesss!, Mum has returned now you're going to get it, and - Moooauw&quot; Dan was interrupted as he felt a strong hand slap his ass &quot;Bah, mother has returned earlier as I had foreseen&quot; Kat said with a concerned face &quot;No matter once I come up with a good story there should be no problem&quot; Dan's sister grinned to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, sweety how was youre day. I could leave office earlier because of your birthday&quot; Their mother came through the garden door into the backyard.Dan walked to his mother right away &quot;Mom, Mom, Mom, Youre daughter is an evil witch and she did this to me&quot; Kat only let out a loud laugh.<br />
<br />
Unaware to Dan his sister was the only one who could hear him, His mother could only hear a faint Moooo. &quot;Kat! what is this&quot; Mother said in a loud voice. Dan was overjoyed his mom would save him now. &quot;Why is their a young heifer in our BACKGARDEN!&quot; Kat's Mother pointed to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;O isen't it great, I received her as a birthday present from farmer Fulbrow. He knew I wanted to be a livestock owner and he decided to give me my first animal&quot; Kat said in a girly innocent voice.<br />
<br />
(Farmer Fulbrow was a farmer just outside the sub-urb, and was an old friend of her)<br />
<br />
Dan was shocked! Coulden't his own mother hear him?! It had to be of Kat's magic. He thought quick, maybe he could spell a message to his mom in the ground, Dan scraped his hoof on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young lady, you can't just have such a large animal here. Think about all the trouble, yes we have a very largeback garden, only because youre father has such a successful job. But we live in a residential area and-&quot; She stopped as the young cow seemingly wrote the letter D in the soft soil.<br />
<br />
Shit thought Kat, I can't let my little brother get out of this. I will get revenge after these years. Quickly she made a small gesture with her hand.<br />
<br />
Dan stopped in his movement, for some reason. He could no longer think about writing. He could read, he still knew what the words meant. But he just forgot how to write! He pushed his hoofs into the ground but he could only stand still. WTF is happening more of my sister's magic, Dan was thinking, His sister was really wicked he still not wanted to believe what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;But mother!&quot; Kat quickly said &quot;You were the one who said I needed to find a job,You promised me you would support me in every way, Didin't you?&quot; Kat smiled, as she padded the heifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Err, I didn't mean it like that, and&quot; Kat's mom was thinking yes, she desperately wanted her daughter to work, a decent job, she was doing nothing but fun things always neglecting her duties and school. And indeed she had promised her to support her in every way, Lifestock owner was a strange thing. But at least she would learn some responsibility with this animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;We simply use the stable that is already there&quot; Kat pointed to a little 1 animal stable in the corner of the yard. It had been there when her family had moved into this house. Probably the former owner had a horse or something. &quot;And food is not an issue, she can eat grass,hay and I will feed her veggies and fruit everyday.&quot; Kat grinned wickedly at her brother, in such a way that there mother could not see it.<br />
<br />
Dan's mother thought about it.<br />
<br />
Dan looked at the little stable, he was shocked. Surely his sister didn't really intend for him to live there, and what with the story about grass and hay. But more importantly he, he needed her to change her back. &quot;Kat if you stop this now, and change me back, I promise I will tell none and we can just live one like nothing happened&quot; Dan pleaded, he was trying to sound confident, but he failed miserably.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about the sound? She seems to make a lot of noise&quot; Mother said, obviously she heard another Moooo from her son.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, she only makes a faint Moo and besides the dog of the neighbors makes far more noise. &quot;Kat said while she made a prouling face &quot;Her milk production will be starting soon, you know much you like biological milk far more then that white-water from the store...&quot; Kat knew exactly was she was doing, She knew the weak spots of her mother.<br />
<br />
Dan was starting to feel darker and more grim. Maybe if he would run over her sister he could stop the spell. He pulled his right-hind leg up, but he found he could not move any further. He looked at this sister.   Kat only trying to palm their mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well sweety, If this will help you with you future job, and learn you responsibility, we might. I have to ask you're father and brother though.&quot; Mother said with a smiling face. &quot;Speaking of which, where is youre brother Dan?  The heifer let out a soft Mooo.<br />
<br />
&quot;O, yes I almost forget to tell you, he and his friend are working on a school project, They will go on a trip to observe teachings at other schools, kind of a exchange student, He might be back in two weeks&quot; Dan's sister said amused<br />
<br />
&quot;Typical of him, Doesen't even take the effort to let his own mother know, sigh, Well Don't forget you're birthday party tonight, it will be in the back garden.&quot; Mother walked away to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure you take good care of her, it would be best if you would also let a vet come to check her.&quot; That was her final word, then she was gone.<br />
<br />
Kat let out a loud Laugh &quot;HaHaHa and how was that show brother dear?&quot;<br />
I told you, I only need a good story.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a sick fuck, and what do you plan to after 2 weeks, besides there is no freaking way I am going to produce milk for you, I am a man and not a cow!&quot; Dan felt a bit of a hero, well at least the last few words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Muhahaha, In case you didn't notice I am the only one who can hear you!&quot; Kat said amused &quot;And tonight you will be the center of my party, tomorrow we will let a vet check you, of course I am a very considerate livestock owner, you should be happy! HeHe, it's is true mom's a witch but she lost all her powers when she married our father, well she wasen't a talented witch anyway&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat conjured a strong leather leash and threw it over Dan's head.<br />
&quot;I'l just bring you to the stable's for now.&quot; Kat pulled Dan through the high grass.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No, No, I am not going to just walk peacefully with you&quot; Dan gave out a loud Moo. &quot;O I am afraid you don't have a choice, cows a re very docile animals, And this leash makes you even more obedient.<br />
<br />
And indeed Dan found he could not resist, slowly one hoof after the other he started moving to wards the stable.<br />
<br />
<br />
