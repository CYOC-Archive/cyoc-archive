<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim decides to wait for the jock to suit up first. &quot;Go ahead man, I'll get ready in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris chuckles at the kid before dropping his boxers and turning to him. &quot;No one here is afraid if getting naked, it's all good...&quot; he says, smiling at his large package and bulked legs. Chris unfolds the jockstrap and takes a brief whiff of the cloth. &quot;Man, this this is pristine, just right for me!&quot; He says, noticing the uncovered chaps. &quot;Ass exposed! Bonus!&quot; he shouts jokingly. Kevin walks over and sees his naked buddy unfurling the strap as he lifts his left leg into it. &quot;I always dig a new jockstrap...&quot; he laughs as he slips his right leg through the clothing.<br />
<br />
Chris bends down at his knees as he slowly pulls up the jock over his hairy shins, knees, and bulked quads. As he gets closer to his crotch Chris smiles, &quot;man, these things feel pretty damn good!&quot; he says, pulling them over his large package and behind his exposed and muscular buttocks.<br />
<br />
Chris immediately tilts his head back and up involuntarily toward the ceiling as he stretches his back, bending it backwards as he lifts his feet off the ground, balancing on his toes as he stretches his entire body. “Ohhh, yea!” he shouts. Jim wonders what the hell is happening to the guy. Looking at the cloth Jim sees an emanating blue glow of electricity become brighter as what appears to be streaks of electricity circle and stretch itself over the cloth, around the sides of Chris's ass cheeks and to the back of the garment. “Fuck yea, I can feel it!” Chris shouts. &quot;I can feel myself gaining something...Oh! YEAH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bending his shoulder muscles back to their relaxed position, muscle starts to grow over Chris's shoulder blades, protruding out, then wrapping down and into his biceps. They were becoming refined, strong, and assured. Looking down at his lower arms Chris notices veins begin to protrude and additional muscle warp itself.<br />
<br />
Then, grabbing his abs, Chris chuckles as they begin to expand. His abs contort and slim liquifying into almost a puddle of water, then began to grow outward: even, defined muscles forming an eight pack. They harden as the creases grow deep grooves into his body. As the muscle growth hits his waistline, new muscles begin to form on his quads and under his cloth, creating tight contours pushing against the garment.<br />
<br />
He grabs his butt as it starts to grow. His rear forms hard muscle on itself, growing outward, strong, further tightening the garment. His ass moves outside the straps as a deep and strong bubble forms. As the side ass muscles flex and lock in place, rounding to become a tight bubble butt, hair wraps around and onto his legs, creating a new thick layer of blonde hair over him. His thighs snap tall and grow, becoming refined and strong as he gains height. They then begin pecing outwards and matching the growth of his ass. They became like footballs as rock hard muscle grows into them. Hair also begins to grow on his legs, then up and around his man package. His pubes began to grow over his waistline, wrapping itself around his belly button and up, in a thin line toward his chest. There, hair begins growing, slightly but evenly, over his new man-pecs and chest. His arm hair grew and darkened and his arm pitts tuffed additional hair underneath.<br />
<br />
The changing captain causes the team, now mostly suited up on their own, to turn to their quarterback. &quot;What the fuck,&quot; a linebacker asks before Kevin buts in, &quot;Chris, dude, what the hell is happening to you? Are you okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Stay here, motherfucker!&quot; Chris orders. &quot;I feel incredible, watch me transformmm...ohh! YEAH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down and checking out his growing body, Chris begins to chuckle at the pleasure. But even as he continues to transform into this musclular football star, becoming more and more intimidating, Chris clearly becomes happier at the atheltic endurance rushing over him. Admiring himself as he continues to grow, Chris feels his package begin to fill out as it pushes hard against the cloth, his cock and balls becoming large and clearly defined behind the garment. Chris looks down to see his new enormous package and turns to show his team before more electric bolts spark out and over his growing, muscular body. “Oh fuck!” he shouts. “I can feel it...I can feel...powers!”<br />
<br />
If it wasn't enough for the jockstrap to turn Chris into an athletic champion, the blue cloud from within the garment starts to form outward and consume the body that's growing. Jim could see Chris gaining something more than human. Something supernatural. Powers. The powers only the gods of ancient times could have held. The cloud quickly envelops Chris, violent, like a tornado, wrapping around his newly formed body. The transformation was still physical: his body slimmed to an even and proportionate mix of muscle; but Jim could see that Chris was also gaining supernatural powers. Electric bolts started forming within the clouds and gracefully running over his skin. The outline of Chris's body sparked with power, his body seemed to snap in and out of existence as it became more than human, more than physical. Chris gained the power of transformation, the power to turn into anything he wanted, the power to read or control other peoples minds, to leave them at his will. The power of immortality and invisibility. The power to spread own power to others, if he wanted, or to enslave them. He began laughing as he gained the knowledge of all of this, realizing the liberation of becoming something so incredibly superhuman. His laughter grew louder while still under the cloud, all of these powers and more deposited into Chris.<br />
<br />
Still under the electric cloud of power Jim noticed the jockstrap literally absorb into the jock, leaving the bare supergod naked nad proud. Chris became the jockstrap and the jockstrap became him. The now naked-Chris felt truly one with his godly body and abilities. His new identity complete, his naked and now natural form absorbing the last of his power acquisition. “Yes...” he shouts under the bolts of power, “I am power!”<br />
<br />
As the cloud of power poured and evaporated itself back into Chris's body he now stood there, complete with the transformation of the football god. Lifting his arms to reveal his naked self, Chris smiles at the team, transformation complete in all its naked, godly splendor. His package was huge but still proportional to the massively built and muscular body held within. Looking up at the ceiling, relishing in his power acquisition, Chris curled his arms in muscular relief. Looking down at his naked godly body transformed, Chris relished in his newfound existence. He flexes his arms and runs his hand along his chest and abs feeling his newly defined body. He turns to see his ass, tight and refined, a beauty even to the gods.<br />
<br />
Smiling at the team, he turns to Jim. &quot;You, my friend, made me into this, into this being of all might. I can thank you by doing whatever you'd like..&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim, surprised that the new supergod is actually granting him a request, contemplates what to ask of the godly athlete...</p>
