<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ulysses had worried his words of kindness and sympathy had sounded worse than fake, <br />
had sounded worse than contrived.  As it turned out, Mary and her half-sisters plus Fox <br />
and Gary's daughters weren't -looking- for poetry. They were looking for kindness. <br />
Something Ulysses had always had in spades.  <br />
<br />
Ulysses wasn't a muscle bound wall of muscle like Lawrence or Roger or Zack, or Alpha-<br />
Jesen... Ulysses wondered if he needed to bulk up, if that was really what women of all <br />
species of man loved. <br />
<br />
But Ulysses found himself under a pile of reddish-gold, midnight black, and dirty orange <br />
fur of little girls who were quick to show their appreciation to the teenage boy. Ulysses <br />
realized that he didn't feel as nervous or feel his heart pounding when the half-sisters <br />
Robyn and Maxine were flirting with him.  <br />
<br />
'Maybe it's better that I'm a lupman and Mary's a leoman...' Ulysses thought, if Sarah's <br />
taught me anything, family isn't -just- about genetics...And maybe I just feel more comfy <br />
about around.' <br />
<br />
Of course the age difference would make -anyone- turn their heads, but none of the <br />
leoman cubs or Ulysses actually -care-. <br />
<br />
 Realistically, Ulysses realized he had thought Lawrence and Roger looked nicer before their <br />
discomfort at appearing feminine had inspired them to abandon all else in favor of bulking <br />
up. Apparently Roger's sister, Megan, had a falling out with her brother over his new <br />
lifestyle for a year before they had finally made up.  Ulysses had no idea that Lawrence had <br />
already and was going to come under fire from his aunt over abandoning his books for <br />
weight machines.  <br />
<br />
In spite of all of them, few if any words were actually spoken... 'Maybe... maybe I just need <br />
to be there for them after all...' Ulysses thought. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Gillie.&quot; Said the black and gold male lion man in a tone like they had known each <br />
other for years. Gillie held back a sigh. &quot;I just wanted to say thank you for letting me know <br />
where my sister was this morning, I know I disappointed you when I didn't become a cop <br />
too, but I'm just glade you don't hold it against me.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Sister?' Gillie wondered, She darted with her eyes looking at the male lion man and Wanda <br />
trying her hardest NOT to look at the package between his legs (which since her <br />
transformation had become more distracting than the things hanging from all the woman's <br />
chests). She saw the similar fur color.  <br />
<br />
She stared blankly for several seconds which the lion man in front of her apparently <br />
mistook for harshness and his posture become less tall. That was when it clicked. <br />
<br />
Gillie did her absolute hardest NOT to scream this time, or faint, neither would do her any <br />
good and would only bring trouble. Instead she put on her best poker face and said, &quot;It's, <br />
okay... everyone's free to make their own choice, and the life of a cop isn't for everyone...&quot; <br />
<br />
That was when he hugged her, &quot;Thanks Gillie!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie struggled to stay conscious until he finally let her go. Realizing there was no sublime <br />
way to figure out Tabby's new name without hurting people who were apparently as close <br />
as family, Gillie knew she'd just have to wing it. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're the head of police?&quot;  Asked one of the lion women Gillie didn't recognize. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Mal'akh Bialyk, as you heard, I have watching people grow old and die in the <br />
gallery since before your grandmother was born... I'd... I'd... OFFICER BIALYK reporting for <br />
duty!&quot; Mal'akh did her hardest to stand at attention and failing pathetically. <br />
<br />
Gillie groaned... she really didn't need this, &quot;Look I, that is, I'm honored but, you see, ugh... <br />
I'm happy to see someone whose that dedicated to their duty but, you just get healed... <br />
then I think, I hate to say, but I think you're going to have to see how the police have <br />
changed in the last two hundred something years....&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;...oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we out of the running?&quot; Lexi asked her sister. <br />
<br />
&quot;Naw.&quot; Nellie replied and did her best not to laugh least she feel agony, &quot;You know Chief <br />
Gillie, no way she'd ever take a mate. Tad is still open season.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm standing right here you know.&quot; Tad pointed out simply. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;In their paranoia, the witches thought the people of Glendale themselves had called the <br />
five 'witch hunters' on them. And of course, that brought back memories of the angry, <br />
superstitious, paranoid, ruled by fear locals that had cost them the life of their mother. .... <br />
Rather ironic since Marie's group tried to fight -against- the madness and paranoia of the <br />
witch hunts in Colonial America that began a few years later. Needless to say this made <br />
them even more ruthless and desperate. Maybe they saw defeating these witch hunters as <br />
avenging their mother.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;And why are you mentioning this now?&quot; Betty asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just cause for the last time in their lives, the witches had someone they cared about other <br />
than themselves, (their familiars and what little emotional endearment they had remaining <br />
towards their godfather  not withstanding).  YES! I know! They did MAKE this Joella, <br />
customized her utterly, making her the perfect 'friend' they wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'Body do what they wanted' so she was a puppet?&quot; Maddex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only the way we're all puppets of our memories. Joella, for that was who she was now, <br />
fully accepted her friends were now 'big', she was hammered not to refer them to as 'grown <br />
ups' or 'adults.'  <br />
<br />
And since Joella didn't drop dead like a puppet whose strings were cut when the witches <br />
died. Marie realized Joella was a living being with a heart and mind of her own. So even if <br />
Marie had that kind of power, or rather, gave into the temptation of using the game, or <br />
curse that way that was struck onto her by the witch's dying breath for that purpose, Marie <br />
realized that doing so would be killing an innocent person to bring back into existence <br />
another innocent person, in short, making her no different from the witches.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And Joella herself?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully they didn't give her magic. So she wasn't a part of their grand scheme. She was <br />
passed off as simply an orphan they had found and adopted. Of course their geasses took <br />
care of problems, but the incomplete damaged Geasses did mean they had to work -<br />
harder- to make everyone accept this story.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And Runner-Bear believed this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He figured they had renamed an orphan child Joella in honor of their dead friend, but he <br />
never guess the full horrid truth though some of his guesses came close.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for Joella herself, they spoiled her rotten, they dotted on her and lavished her. Unlike <br />
them however, Joella had a desire for actual friends, rather than just things. The witches <br />
made her the Joella of their idealized memories, but of course they didn't run those <br />
idealizations to their logical conclusion. <br />
<br />
 &quot;So while Joella did love them, that DIDN'T stop her from loving anyone else, empathizing <br />
with everyone else, and caring about everyone else, in a genuine manner, or with her <br />
'grandfather', rather than the fantasy world the witches lived in now. In a way she was like <br />
me. They also magically regressed her age by one year after every birthday so to keep her <br />
at that age until their ideal world was created. She didn't start growing until after her foster <br />
parents were dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't like where this is heading.&quot; Maddex said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone monster has a another side. Stalin was devoted to his mother. Hitler in his final <br />
day finally married Eva Braun before they ended their lives together. Al Capone looked after <br />
his son. This didn't make them any less -evil-, make them any less deserving of <br />
punishment, but at the end they were all still people. And while their Joella might have <br />
been a replacement for the original, they used her as the final justification to create an <br />
ideal world for her.&quot;   <br />
<br />

1686 Winter <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on come come on! Is that all you've got?! Come on I know you can run faster than <br />
that! Now move it!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;AAAH!&quot; Kathrine finally gave in and scream. <br />
<br />
Armando said confidently in front of the panting Kathrine, &quot;You can bet I'll make a lion out <br />
of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
1687 Spring <br />
<br />
Armando said aggravated at the sleeping felman in front of him where she had fallen <br />
asleep standing up her knees knocked her body still in position, &quot;I am somehow going to <br />
make a lion out of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
1687 Summer <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you seen Kathrine? All those bruises and claw marks? I think she even lost a fang a <br />
bit back... those wolf-cubs are monsters I tell ya!&quot; <br />
<br />
1687 Fall <br />
<br />
Armando groaned and turned his head away from the broken sight in front of him, fall on <br />
the ground face first, &quot;I'm tired of this. Your progress is patheitc. Go home. Make up <br />
whatever lie you need to. How could I ever make a lion out of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Where In The Lord's Name do you think you're going?... We're not done yet!&quot; <br />
<br />
Armando started and turned around. &quot;What did you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was like a mask had fallen off her face. <br />
<br />
The felman covered in blood staining her painfully bright fur crimson, &quot;We're not done yet! <br />
You said three years right? They're not up yet!&quot; Kathrine said fire in her eyes. &quot;So come <br />
back here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Armando narrowed his eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I a felman! Not a leoman! And I am proud of it! It is what God chose me to be! I am no <br />
one's lion but His! So be silent! Unless you're scared one tiny little felman can surpass a <br />
lupman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Armando roared and came at her, Kathrine didn't need to duck as far as another would, and <br />
drove the spear foreword past him, then swung the butt of the weapon up and smack him <br />
in the face right on the nose. <br />
<br />
The elder lupman watching this laughed and clapped. This felman would do just fine.</p>
