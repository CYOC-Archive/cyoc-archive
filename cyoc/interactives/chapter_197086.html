<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was not exactly difficult for Neil to make his exit amidst the torrid scene that played out in front of him at Brock&#39;s place. He didn&#39;t know WHAT happened to Brock there, as it seemed like his whole persona shifted a bit during that escapade with Parker. But whatever the case was, it was clear to Neil now what was happening. People weren&#39;t just changing at the gym now. He seemed to have some sort of effect on people who had been to the gym. He&#39;d changed Parker via sexual contact, yet he hadn&#39;t changed Clarissa. And none of the other guys from the club he&#39;d danced with were changed either - so it meant three things;<br />
<br />
1) the change was induced via either attendance at the gym, or via sexual contact with him specifically.<br />
2) the gym was changing people&#39;s preferences and identity based on some sort of inclination or personal conduct.<br />
3) Neil was not exempt from this. <br />
<br />
He found that when he went to get himself dressed while Parker and Brock were still fucking that he had a card in his wallet. His eyes widened when he saw it was a professional bodybuilder ID card for the local athletic league. He never remembered getting one, let alone ever competing. Yet here it was - a card and, as he surveyed his phone, several pictures of him grinning on stage as he pumped his muscles for the audience.<br />
<br />
Yet unlike others at the gym, he wasn&#39;t overtaken by what was going on.<br />
<br />
He still remembered how things &quot;should&quot; be. He didn&#39;t know why, and he didn&#39;t know what else was going on. But he knew enough to know that going to that gym was only going to push things further along. And while Neil definitely liked the effects of this so far, he didn&#39;t fancy the idea of getting even further pushed along. He quite liked his personality, and had no interest in seeing it affected - going by the assumption that the change would eventually effect it.<br />
<br />
Walking home alone in the dark of night was always a bit intimidating to Neil, but that was when he was a small, diminutive guy. Now he felt more capable. His athleticism let him feel stronger, and thus safer. <br />
<br />
Neil looked in the window of a nearby closed for the night business, observing his heavily muscled frame - suited for physique performances and displays of muscular aptitude. Fuck, but he looked even better than Bradley did now. He shook his head and kept walking. He didn&#39;t want to think about what might happen if Bradley asked HIM for workout help now considering how big he was. He had to consider what he was gonna do from here on out.<br />
<br />
As he kept walking eventually he got a phone call. As he pulled his phone out, he saw it was from Brock. Shrugging his shoulders, Neil decided to answer it. &quot;Hey, Neil here. You got done with Parker?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...whew...man,&quot; it sounded like Brock was...still affected at least a deal by whatever went on with him in there, but he wasn&#39;t sounding entirely like that now. If Neil had to guess, that sort of persona was something Brock was slowly growing into, and he got a peek at it tonight. Brock chuckled on the other end, &quot;Hope I didn&#39;t intimidate you at all there, man. Kinda got really into the angle, you know? Remember how intense that guy &quot;Sir&quot; was?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...yeah,&quot; Neil nodded, and decided. Brock obviously couldn&#39;t tell what was happening to him. But Neil could. What seemed to Brock now just like erotic roleplay was a glimpse into the man&#39;s future, once the changes were done with him. Still, even over the phone, while Brock seemed to be &quot;back&quot;, he sounded a deal more mature. As if some of that stayed with him;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know dude, how about you and I do a workout tomorrow at my private gym? I might have to take it easy,&quot; Brock said chuckling on the other end, &quot;Gotta be careful. I think I might&#39;ve finally worked out so hard - and fucked so hard - I gotta take it easy. I swear, I really am getting older, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t know the half of it, Neil wanted to say. But he knew trying was futile. So he just said, &quot;...Well, everybody needs to be at least a bit careful. You being as big as you are...well, you gotta be extra careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suppose you&#39;re right...damn. Well, see you tomorrow for our private workout. Bring a babe or a dude, if you&#39;d like to get something going. Otherwise, it&#39;ll just be a workout. I gotta hit the sack...and shave up. Fuck, when did my beard get so thick...?&quot; And with that the phone call ended, and Neil was left wondering how long it was going to be until the &quot;play&quot; that Brock made during that time with Parker became the whole of him. It was like he couldn&#39;t even see the trajectory of his mind and outlook...<br />
<br />
Well, if Brock couldn&#39;t tell he was physically changing, he wouldn&#39;t be able to tell he was mentally altering as well. Neil wondered how many more days it&#39;d be until those mental changes fully took over...? He shook his head. Maybe he needed to try and see Matt or Lucas at college tomorrow. See if they were dealing with anything similar.<br />
<br />
By the time Neil got home at the dorms, he could see there was a light inside. So he figured at least Max was home. <br />
<br />
As Neil opened the door, he was greeted by quite a sight on the dorm couch in the front room.<br />
<br />
Max - at least a little bit brawnier than the last time he saw him at the gym and still a little bit stocky looking - on the couch, poised above a brunette. Sex wasn&#39;t happening quite yet, they were more in the phase of simply making out, but Clara was down to her bra and gym shorts, and Max was only wearing a pair of boxers. As soon as Neil entered, both realized they now suddenly had company and Max gasped, pulling up and looking at Neil, &quot;Woah...uh...didn&#39;t...know you&#39;d be home so soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil could see a very prominent bulge in Max&#39;s shorts, so it was obvious what he was thinking of doing tonight. Clara looked at Neil and propped herself up on the couch, feeling Max&#39;s arm just as well, &quot;Wow...is this the guy you told me about? The one who changed so much? Neil Booth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The man the myth the legend...&quot; Neil wryly commented, &quot;Yeah, and---wait. Wait wait wait.&quot; Neil almost dropped his bag when he realized what Clara just said. &quot;You can tell? <i>You can tell people&#39;re changing!?</i>&quot; He was almost too overjoyed. It almost felt like he was going insane. To have someone else to talk to, to---to communicate with about all this... it was too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, don&#39;t cum all over the place, that should be what I&#39;m doing tonight!&quot; Max teased, &quot;Of course she can. Of course we can. I mean...if you&#39;ve got even the basic ability to perceive reality, you can tell things&#39;re going down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perception... Neil pondered that word for a moment, but decided he needed to do more with it later. Even as he stood there, he realized how charged the atmosphere was. Max and Clara looked back at each other. Max looked at Neil, and said, &quot;Well, you know what we were gonna be doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much mystery there,&quot; Clara commented as she ran a hand along Max&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t wanna keep you lovebirds from your time together...&quot; Neil said as he picked up his bag to start heading to his room. Wondering how his quarters had changed since he was apparently now a big time bodybuilder. Probably a whole bunch of trophies and stuff that he didn&#39;t even remember acquiring. &quot;Enjoy yourselves. Go full stud mode, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you...don&#39;t mind this going on...?&quot; Clara asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a bit.&quot; Neil answered, &quot;Proud of my bro. You two feel free to fuck each other till next morning if you want.&quot; Neil would&#39;ve asked about joining in, but he didn&#39;t know what any sexual contact with Max might do. And he was admittedly a little worn out from a pretty heavy night of sexual bliss. He needed to figure some stuff out about what happened to him.<br />
<br />
As Neil walked off, he heard the two of them murmuring sweet nothings to each other before resuming making out - and he knew it would likely not be long before they were outright fucking on the couch. He considered getting something to eat and seeing what effect his changes had had on their living accommodations, or seeing what happened in his room...</p>
