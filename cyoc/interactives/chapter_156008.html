<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maya nodded. &#39;Thank you. I should be running away but as bizarre as this is, but you are the first shred of hope I&#39;ve had in years.&#39; she paused. &#39;Uh, so how do we do this?&#39;<br />
<br />
Sophie smiled. &#39;Each drone carries one queen larva. I push it out and we let go up your butt. It highjacks your digestive tract and starts growing and fusing with you.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sophie pushed one hand down the front of her yoga pants. A look of concentration and then she pulled her hand back, holding what looked like a rubbery dark walnut with three pencil sized tendrils from its rear.<br />
<br />
Maya&#39;s eyes went wide again. She believed Sophie before but seeing it made reality sink in. Determined, she turned away and loosened her belt. &#39;Do it.&#39;<br />
<br />
The busty goth girl pulled the back of Maya&#39;s pants and dropped the larva into the gap. It knew what to do and quickly forced its way into her back door.<br />
<br />
&#39;Now we wait a bit for my other self to finish drinking Dante under the table. He decided to go macho and match me drink for drink. He&#39;ll never win as I have total control of my drones&#39; metabolism and my brain is hundreds of miles away.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sophie filled the time by giving Maya a play by play of what was going to happen to her.<br />
<br />
Inside the bar, Sophie had created one of the more memorable evenings in the history of the bar. After her &#39;sister&#39; had left, she had offered to do a round of shots of 151 with the guys at the bar. Slamming down the high proof alcohol, she proceeded to ask the bartender to fire up the karaoke stage. She belted out a fairly impressive and very high energy rendition of Halestorm&#39;s Mz. Hyde. This included dancing, which added quite a show of bouncing titflesh to the spectacle.<br />
<br />
This was followed by a round of double shots, and more karaoke. Any guy who attempted to hit on her was answered with a challenge; darts, pool, or even beer chugging. She humiliated them all.<br />
<br />
Other customers started buying her drinks, entertained by her antics and wanting to see how much more this strange girl could drink.<br />
<br />
She paired the drinks up and shared with a chosen few around her at the bar, especially Dante.<br />
<br />
An two hours in and the aspiring druglord was reeling under the combined impact of well over a dozen drinks. Sophie finished singing &#39;Freak Like Me&#39; and returned to the bar and offered to share the four shots waiting for her with Dante. The second pair of shots proved to be his undoing and he fell off his stool.<br />
<br />
Maya and the second Sophie entered the bar right on cue. They eased the catatonic drunk off the floor and took him out to the Winnebago. Tossing him on the bed, they left him and returned to the bar.<br />
<br />
A second round of dinner was ordered, along with countless additional drinks. Maya found herself joining in the extreme alcohol binge but couldn&#39;t manage a buzz. Sophie caught on the her confusion and whispered to her. &#39;The larvae has your metabolism ramped up to several times normal, you&#39;re breaking it down for calories as fast as you can drink it.&#39;<br />
<br />
Two hours passed, Maya could feel things happening. A tingle had been working its way up her back. When she felt the area, she could feel a rope of flesh working its way up her spine. She also could feel odd sensations and movement inside her lower body. Her stomach was bloating out, and she wasn&#39;t sure it was just from the huge portions she was eating.<br />
<br />
A pressure built at the base of her skull, followed by a pinch and release. Moments later Maya was horny. A switch had been flipped and her brain had thoughts only for fucking. It took all her willpower to keep her hands out of her panties.<br />
<br />
Sophie picked up on this, one drone escorting Maya back to the RV while the other quickly squared up the portions of their bill not comped from the wing contest.<br />
<br />
Maya was stripping as the RV door closed behind them. She crawled into bed and with newfound strength tore Dante&#39;s cloths off him.<br />
<br />
Dante stirred but failed to react appropriately. Maya straddled his head and pressed her oozing wet slit onto his face. The powerful pheromones she was exuding slammed carnal instincts inside Dante into full gear. His cock rose to full attention and Maya mounted him without hesitation.<br />
<br />
They quickly built up into rough aggressive fucking. As it had been with Sophie and the twins, there was no technique, just frantic sex in a race towards orgasm. <br />
<br />
Maya and Dante were oblivious to what was happening, but Sophie watched with interest as moving raised lines spread outwards from Dante&#39;s crotch. It quickly formed a bulging network under his skin extending all around his body.<br />
<br />
Dante grunted as he began to orgasm. The bulges under his skin began to pulse with his thrusts. Maya was draped over his torso, showing no response but just taking in everything Dante was giving her.<br />
<br />
Dante&#39;s barrel torso slowly contracted. Mass drained from his thick limbs also, carried by the growths under his skin and pumped into Maya&#39;s cunt. The black girl&#39;s stomach was expanding, taking in the mass syphoned from her abusive husband.<br />
<br />
A dark fuzz appeared on his head, slowly stretching out into a thick head of smooth raven hair.<br />
<br />
He face was reshaping as well. Dante&#39;s nose thinned and adam&#39;s apple vanished, jawline softening as his lips plumped.<br />
<br />
His body was diminishing further as well, his shoulders had narrowed dramatically and all muscle tone had vanished. His waist cinched inwards while hips turned outwards. <br />
<br />
His areola spread slightly as soft flesh blossomed underneath.<br />
<br />
Maya&#39;s belly was now a taut beachball. She rolled off her feminized abuser, a rope of dark flesh still connecting her pussy with his twitching cock. Slow pulses still made their way down this connector and into Maya. Dante was unrecognizable, appearing to be a teenage waif of a dickgirl.<br />
<br />
Sophie decided the show was over and moved on to the next stage. She flushed the alcohol from her drones with a thought (it had only really impacted her senses anyway).<br />
<br />
One drone started up the TV while the other followed in the DeSoto.<br />
<br />
They drove off into the night, driving towards the farm to ease Maya into her new existence.</p>
