<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up gently being nudged from above. &quot;Wakey wakey, Kiddo...&quot; You hear a sweet voice from above and your eyes open. You see Uncle Jack leaning over you. He beams down on you as he coos, &quot;Hey, Kiddo, how&#39;s my little guy?&quot; You smile at his patronizing attention, and you bring your fists to rub your eyes. You can tell it&#39;s morning, but all the window blinds are closed so it&#39;s not too bright. &quot;Time to get up, Kiddo, we gotta get you changed.&quot; He moves to the end of the bed and takes you by the ankles, gently pulling you so you slide within reach. The covers get bunched up with you, but you move effortlessly over the rubbery sheets. Uncle tosses the covers aside, and reaches towards your crotch. &quot;I don&#39;t think I gotta check you, now do I?&quot; he asks you. You blush and say, &quot;I went boom boom.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s what I thought&quot;, he says as he undoes your onesie.<br />
<br />
He hitches the front and back of your onesie up so your diaper is free and ready. You look down and see that the front is yellow. You must have gone pee pee in your sleep. Uncle undoes the tape strips at the front, and you feel the heavy diaper front pull away from you, leaving your damp dick exposed to the cooler air. &quot;Butt up!&quot; you hear, and you oblige by using your feet to push your butt upward. You can feel the poo from last night clinging to your butt, but the back of your diaper is heavy enough that it falls without too much complaint. It is whisked away as Uncle rolls it up and disposes of it. You set your butt back down on the bed, patiently waiting for your new diaper.<br />
<br />
Presently Uncle comes back holding just that, and says &quot;Now here&#39;s your new--Uh oh! Butt up!&quot; You lift your butt up again, and realize you got poop on the sheets. &quot;Sorry, Uncle...&quot; you say bashfully. &quot;No problem, we just have to wipe it all clean...&quot; He dutifully produces a wet wipe and wipes your bottom as you hold it up, and then the sheets where your butt touched. &quot;The bed&#39;s all clean! Now butt down, and legs up.&quot; You oblige, lifting your legs as high and open as you can, making your backside relatively available to him. He takes a couple more wet wipes and uses them to wash around your butthole and penis. In just a few seconds, you hear the rustle of something being unfolded and slid under you. &quot;Legs down.&quot; You relax and lie down on the bed, and no sooner do you do that you feel a puffy diaper along your butt and being folded up over your groin. Uncle expertly tapes it up and cheerily says, &quot;All clean! Now we&#39;ve got to get ready for the day! Come on, get up.&quot; You obey as you get up and stand in front of him.<br />
<br />
He produces a few clothes. &quot;We gotta get you dressed before we can go out shopping.&quot; He brings a plain green tee-shirt over your head. You help by sliding your arms through the holes. It&#39;s hard for Uncle to dress you when you&#39;re the same size as him, so you help in any way you can. He then presents denim shortalls to you, and you hold his shoulders as you step into them. He pulls them up over your diaper, and pulls the straps up behind you to latch them to your front. Now your diaper snugly rests inside, and you feel a little bit more secure. &quot;And now your socks and shoes,&quot; Uncle says with finality. You find it nice that he&#39;s repeating the words so you can learn them, even though you already know them. He helps you into some short, white socks and some velcro shoes, and you are now ready for the day. &quot;Alright, Kiddo, let&#39;s head out. We&#39;ve got lots of things to get for your room.&quot; You nod and say, &quot;Okay Unca&#39;!&quot; You grab his hand and he leads the way. <br />
<br />
You walk down the hallway together to the front door of Uncle&#39;s house, and you can hear and feel your diaper rustling under your clothes. But you&#39;re not embarrassed, that&#39;s supposed to happen. You stop on the way for Uncle to pick up a duffel bag of some sort. Maybe it&#39;s more diapers. You exit the house hand in hand, and Uncle turns around to lock the door. Once he&#39;s done, you both start walking down the walkway to his car. But with each step you take, you start feeling more and more confused. It&#39;s as if two different strings of thoughts are happening at the same time, talking over each other. And just before you get to the car, everything snaps.<br />
<br />
The last thing you remember doing was chatting with Jack in front of his TV. Then you went to sleep, and you had this weird dream that he dressed you like a baby. Then today you were going to go out shopping. You look down, and see yourself wearing those exact same baby clothes. Adult-sized baby clothes! You look at Jack, and see that you&#39;re holding his hand. You look at him and see that he&#39;s shocked, and you two jerk your hands away from each other as if a snake bit at them. &quot;What just happened?&quot; he asked frantically. You are lost for words, and say &quot;I... I don&#39;t know...&quot; Jack stutters, &quot;You were... I just... What???&quot; He reels in shock and disgust, realizing how intimately you two got into the caretaking roles. It looks like Jack also wasn&#39;t aware of what he was doing. You ask him uselessly, &quot;What happened, Uncle?&quot; Wait... Uncle? He spins around and barks at you, with a bit of venom, &quot;Do NOT call me that, Kiddo...&quot; You start in surprise, and he stops as he realizes what he just said. You two stand in shock as you find Uncle and Kiddo still coming out of your mouths. What&#39;s going on?<br />
<br />
You find yourself feeling small after he yelled at you, and you grab one arm with the other hand as you shrink into yourself timidly. But soon you feel something else: a warmth blooming through your groin. It takes you a few seconds to realize what&#39;s going on: you&#39;re peeing yourself! Unc... Jack scared you and made you pee your diaper! You look down at yourself and see nothing through the shortalls, but you know your diaper is there, getting fuller as you try to stop in vain. You feel tears coming to your eyes as you uncontrollably wet yourself. You look up to Jack and see him pacing frantically. As your stream slows to a dribble, you ask him timidly, &quot;Is this the curse?&quot; He looks at you, and then the house, but remains stunned and speechless. Your embarrassment overflows and you start crying in earnest. Your voice cracks as you say, &quot;I don&#39;t wanna be a baby...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack looks at you, and after only a moment&#39;s hesitation says &quot;Oh, there there...&quot; He comes towards you and embraces you. You immediately hug him back as you start sobbing. Your tears fall onto the sidewalk behind him as you babble. You&#39;re scared, you&#39;re embarrassed, you wet yourself, all of it comes pouring out of your mouth. Jack listens and lets you cry as he strokes the back of your head and soothes you. &quot;Ssshh, shhh. It&#39;s okay Kiddo...&quot; You cry in his arms for a couple more minutes, but eventually your fit dies down into sniffles. He keeps rubbing your back to comfort you, and you return the favor.<br />
<br />
Without breaking the embrace, you say with your voice still shaking, &quot;I think we&#39;re still stuck as Uncle and Kiddo.&quot; He doesn&#39;t respond, but you continue: &quot;I think we need somewhere else to live so we can break this curse.&quot;</p>
