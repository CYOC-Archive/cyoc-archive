<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was no hesitation before she knew who she should spread this ecstacy too. Her neighbor just across the hall, and one of the sweetest women that Joanna knew. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t even a question that Katrina was a bright spot in a city full of apathetic people. She was hard-working, kind, throwing herself into helping with any problem she saw others struggling with - there were a few times, when things got pretty bad for Joanna financially, where her neighbor had worked her ass off to help provide her with basic necessicities. There was no-one in Joanna&#39;s life who seemed more deserving of some happiness.<br />
<br />
And what luck - today was her day off. She&#39;d be sure to be at home still, unaware of the happiness that was coming her way. Joanna&#39;s form quickly receded back into a black, shiny puddle on the floor, before it began to move, hurrying towards the door. Her ever-malleable body had no issue slipping under the doorframe into the empty hallway, and promptly doing the same with Katrina&#39;s door.<br />
<br />
The interior of her neighbor&#39;s unit was sparsely decorated, with rather plain and basic furniture. She tended to live quite simply, no extravagant displays outrageous hobbies. The kitchen and connected living room seemed devoid of activity, but she could sense someone moving and making noise nearby. Life in the bedroom - that had to be where Katrina was. Silently her slime-like form sped that way, one slive of her peeking under the closed bedroom door to inspect the situation.<br />
<br />
Her excitement at seeing the girl on the other side was short-lived. She was there, lying curled up on the bed, her average, olive-skinned body dressed only in plain white bra and underwear. The curly hair that she kept short and pulled off to one side was in a mess... and though her pretty face was buried into a pillow, she could tell the girl was crying. The sobs caused a tremor of heartache to reverberate through her form, a heightened emotional response to what she was seeing.<br />
<br />
This couldn&#39;t persist. She couldn&#39;t let someone who was so normally bringing joy to others lie there, lonely in whatever had brought her to tears. The rest of her body quickly slipped in and reformed silently into its humanoid shape. With a bit more urging, her human features returned as well, making her appear as she once had, complete with clothes manifested on her body. Eager though she was to share her amorphous form, it might scare Katrina to suddenly see, and that was the last thing she wished to inflict on this wonderful girl.<br />
<br />
A hand reached out, gently resting on Katrina&#39;s shoulders, and the woman&#39;s large, almond-colored eyes opened in surprise. &quot;J-Joey?&quot; She stammered out her nickname for her neighbor, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had the day off, and I heard you crying... it got me worried.&quot; She gently rubbed the girl&#39;s back as she tried to hide her tears. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was shame in her eyes as she darted her gaze towards the bed. &quot;Uh... n-nothing, it&#39;s... it&#39;s fine, just... s-sorry to wake you....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; She leaned in, her hand shifting up to brush through Katrina&#39;s curls. &quot;It&#39;s okay. You can tell me. Please... I just want to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Though her gaze remained locked on the sheets below her, the sincere tone seemed to bring a bit of the truth forward in Katrina. &quot;I just... M-Mark... he...&quot;<br />
<br />
She pointed to her phone half-heartedly on the nightstand, leading Joanna to grab it and scroll through the text conversation Katrina had open. It was with Mark, Katrina&#39;s boyfriend - the guy had always given her a seedy feeling, like he was a bit of a shitbag taking advantage of a sweet girl. She felt rather affirmed in that assessment as she saw this morning&#39;s exchange, her eyes opening wider in shock. &quot;...that son of a...&quot;<br />
<br />
Over a fucking text message, on a goddamn Tuesday morning. She was having trouble imagining a shittier way to break up with something. Setting the phone back on the nightstand, she leaned in to give the girl a hug. Katrina returned it out of reflex, and just a hint of desperation for some human contact in a moment of pain. &quot;That jackass has no idea how good of a thing he just lost,&quot; Joanna said, patting Katrina&#39;s back as she buried her face in the other woman&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Quickly she worked her way up onto the bed, laying next to Katrina and just holding her for a while. The tears just kept on coming, Katrina unable to get out any sort of coherent words; Joanna just stayed silent, eyes closed and chin nestled against the top of her friend&#39;s head. She wanted to Mark&#39;s stupid face in, but far more important to her right now was being there to comfort someone who had only ever been kind to her.<br />
<br />
It only reaffirmed to her that Katrina would need to be the first to receive this gift - and that it had to be soon. She only waited until the tears finally seemed to have started before gently shaking Katrina, looking down and speaking in a soft voice, &quot;I... think I can do something that&#39;ll help.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause and several sniffles before the girl in her arms responded. &quot;W-what... w-w-what is i-it?&quot;<br />
<br />
By the time she looked up into Joanna&#39;s eyes, the arms wrapped around her had already become a thick, viscous liquid, pouring onto her skin like a massage being dumped all over her back. Her mind reeled in surprse as she felt a pleasant tingle and wet sensation everywhere that her body was touching Joanna&#39;s, but she couldn&#39;t bring herself to turn from the gaze in her eyes. It was just so... loving. So much affection poured into a single gaze.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t offer questions as Joanna leaned forward, their lips coming together. It was surprising, unexpected, but so very full of adoration taht she couldn&#39;t find a single complaint. Katrina&#39;s eyes fell closed as her whole body became warm; her gown had vanished, but she could have sworn that she was still wrapped up, even more so than before. In her arms she could no longer feel Joanna&#39;s body... but she could still feel her, all over, as if Joanna was covering every part of her skin.<br />
<br />
A gasp left her mouth as their minds connected, right in sync with the feeling of warmth and being covered reaching her chest and nether region. A flurry of thoughts flew between their minds - memories, emotions, feelings, desires, hopes, dreams, fears, and greatest of all, loves. Joanna could have sworn that she could feel her very soul colliding with Katrina&#39;s - and what a wonderful soul this woman had. So much kindness, such a ceaseless desire to bring happiness to those around her. Only marred by a single crack, the scar of someone rejecting the love she&#39;d offered.<br />
<br />
Katrina&#39;s eyes opened, her mouth hanging in shock as she looked at what had happened. Joanna&#39;s slimy form had covered her from her toes up to her neck, encapsulating her in a joyful caress. It was entirely bizzare and alien, and yet she found herself scarcely concerned; she could feel that this material was her neighbor, and that she meant no hark at all. In fact, her eyes soon closed once more, as she rolled over and hugged herself. The affection of it nearly overloaded Joanna&#39;s mind, the shifting of her form upon the other woman&#39;s back increasing greatly.<br />
<br />
She only pondered how far to go. Desperately, she wanted to join with Katrina as the entity from the vial had joined with her. To be unified as a single being, a living propogator of joy. And yet... she might feel guilty, to take such a bright, beautiful soul, and seal it away permanently within her own. Perhaps it was better to give Katrina this gift, but to let her remain her own person, her own separate, blissful soul. Or, she further considered, such things could wait - the feeling of her form stretched over Katrina&#39;s body was heavenly, after all. Why not enjoy it for a little while?</p>
