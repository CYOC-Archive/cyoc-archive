<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hacjuel&#39;s voice rang in the leopard woman’s head, she wanted more followers but not to alert any humans to their presence. Her nose twitched as she smelled more than one human in the area and she crouched down started prowling like the leopard she was and waited until the two humans retreated into the tents to make her move. She slowly made her way over to one of the tents, Dan’s tent, but of course she didn’t know that nor did she need to know it.<br />
<br />
She moved with grace and elegance over the ground, as silent as the night itself as she cut open the tent with her claw, and peered in before she took any further actions. She saw her target sound asleep, but as she approached him she paused as she got a vision from her god.<br />
<br />
That vision was of this man becoming a male, hunting with her, mating with her, and fathering her young. Various scenes flashed in her mind, and they were enough to cause her pussy to get moist, and the warmth of early estrus in her thighs. She blushed as she normally shouldn’t fall victim to such foolish lusts, but then she paused as this was a vision from her god. Was it perhaps her destiny to become mates with this human? The race certainly needed worthy males to impregnate females with future generations of precious little kittens.<br />
<br />
Hacjuel instructed her to disarm this individual, take him somewhere silent, and turn him and seduce him with her feminine wiles. And so she nodded, lunging at Dan, bringing her arms up under his and putting her one of her hands over his mouth while she grabbed the amulet from her neck.<br />
<br />
Dan woke up, screaming and struggling then suddenly pulled a knife from a pocket on his chest and made a violent motion to attack his assassin. However, the leopard was prepared for this and she grabbed his wrist, and held his arm back before she leaned closer and whispered,&quot;Shhh, calm down now, there is no need for that human. I am not here to harm you, but to present you with a gift. The more you struggle against me the harder this will get, so make your next choice wisely.&quot;<br />
<br />
The leopard woman’s tail flicked in front of Dan&#39;s face and he was caught off guard by this, and she used this opportunity to disarm him and he dropped his knife to the ground. The amulet seemed to give off a faint glow as the gem touched Dan&#39;s back and as the woman whispered,&quot;Shhh, it’s going to be alright, far better even than your pitiful humanity, just calm yourself now. Think of peaceful things like nature at its purest, a lush green forest with a small stream, or the satisfaction you get while skinning your prey after the hunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan continued to struggle for a few moments, but as the amulet&#39;s glow intensified he seemed to fight less and less. He was eventually calm enough that when the leopard woman reached for the amulet and removed her hand from his mouth he kept silent.<br />
<br />
The moment the amulet was on Dan&#39;s skin he paused as images of himself as a prideful make leopard flashed through his mind. He not only enjoyed the hunt, but he lived for that rush of adrenaline he got through his veins after every kill. Questions he had immediately included,&quot;What did the hunt amount to? Why did he need this rush? Why was he even considering this in the slightest?&quot;<br />
<br />
He soon got the answers to all of them as he was released and he turned around to see the gorgeous leopard woman before him. She smiled at him and kissed him on the mouth passionately, brushing her tail by his pants and legs as the fur started sprouting on his body and the parted lips, him completely shocked of her beauty.<br />
<br />
He opened his mouth to speak, and she placed a finger over his and quietly growled,&quot;Stop, just follow,&quot; and he nodded, watching the mysterious feline woman grab his knife and guide him outside of his tent and into the dense woods.<br />
<br />
The two traveled roughly 500 meters and Dan overlooked the female&#39;s body. Her breasts weren’t great, and certainly didn’t bounce according to his preferred male taste, but that meant she could hunt. Judging by the way she held the knife also indicated that she knew what she was doing, but why did that matter when her ass was the perfect shape, the perfect jiggle, and the perfect kind of soft firmness. <br />
<br />
Dan didn’t know why he knew this all just by a glance at her, but it was all he needed to turn him on enough to get a full erection on in his pants. But as he was lost in her looks, Dan tripped over and fell face first onto the ground and groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; the leopard woman growled then looked around, and thankfully nothing seemed to hear him fall.<br />
<br />
The leopard woman then leaned down to help Dan and when she reached for him he held up his hands as a sign of refusal and said,&quot;I-I’m fine, just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay quiet, I don’t care if you don’t want my help male,&quot; She hissed at him then rolled him over onto his back and pulled off his shoes and socks. Just as she thought, Dan was not used to having paws yet and tripped over like a newborn infant at trying to walk and he scraped his knee off of the brush of the forest, and a few thorns stuck out of his body.<br />
<br />
The leopard worked efficiently and removed the thorns then proceeded to lick the blood from the open wound just before the area around it sprouted fur that would’ve protected him if it was there before. Dan groaned,&quot;H-Hey stop... y-your tongue feels rough and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, and let me clean the wound with what I have human,&quot; She hissed again and Dan nodded to her as the rough tongue stroked his open wound like sandpaper.<br />
<br />
After awhile though her kicks started feeling pretty nice and tender, almost healing in a way. His legs seemed to bulk up with the addition of the fur and a tail sprouted out just above his rear just like hers. &quot;A-Ah... w-who are you?&quot; Dan asked looking up at the woman puzzled, smiling, and in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; The leopard woman replied,&quot;Someone who cares, someone you care for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Wait what? I-I meant your name... why would I also c-care for someone I just met?&quot; He replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Name? Grrrr,&quot; She snarled at him then tore his boxers off viciously with her claws and glared at him,&quot;You humans are so overzealous, names are just things you refer to each other by because you’re too feeble to rely on sight or scent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan saw his erect member grow a furry sheath around it, his balls swelled to the size of golf balls, and his 5 inch cock nearly doubled in size in front of him. &quot;I-I n-not exactly it’s j-just easier to call each other b-by name instead of...&quot; Dan began then the leopard woman firmly grasped his cock and squeezed his shaft and he shut up and let out a small whine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you just be quiet? Hacjuel doesn’t want us to be discovered, why don’t you just listen to his words of wisdom like me?&quot; The leopard woman replied bearing her sharp teeth and fangs at him.<br />
<br />
Dan paused as he heard the voices in his head start speaking to him. As they spoke he stared off into space and his eyes were slowly changing color. &quot;I-I...&quot; Dan muttered and paused,&quot;...S-Sure miss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan’s shoulders and arms bulked up, his hands and fingers turning into ferocious claws like the leopard woman before him. Dan’s body also seemed to gain a boost of muscle mass which included chiseled pecs, cut abs, and ripped muscles on his arms and legs. All of this caused his shirt to get torn up in the process into rags.<br />
<br />
The leopard woman nodded as this happened then she paused and looked down at Dan&#39;s twitching cock and grinned. Romance certainly was not necessary and almost never needed, however wasn’t seduction just a method of attracting a mate? Yes, it certainly was, and human romance was just a twisted version of seduction.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’ve got a naughty idea,&quot; The woman thoug to herself as Dan’s changes progressed.<br />
<br />
Dan&#39;s hair changed into fur as his memories faded and turned into primal instincts, only heightened to their limits by his human level intellectual prowess. The god Hacjuel proceeded to replace these memories with much more useful teachings, skills of hunting, survival, and how to use everything around him as far as plants for healing and animal remains to make tools.<br />
<br />
His head grew flat as his entire face pushed forward into a muzzle filled with sharp feline fangs and teeth. His nose grew larger, wet and his smell far sharper along with his hearing, and especially his eyesight in the pitch black darkness.<br />
<br />
He was stunned by in the same way the leopard woman was from his skull reshaping and his human brain without it, and he growled, clutching his head when this happened. However soon he felt a wet rough surface stroke his erect member and he roared out and orgasmed, shooting a small load up into the air that landed on the rags of his shirt, and chest.<br />
<br />
When he noticed this, there was no more Dan, just a leopard man. He saw the soiled rags on his chest and immediately tore them off with a growl and sat up, locking eyes with the leopard woman for a couple seconds as his red barbed member throbbed at her beauty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better?&quot; She asked grinning, sitting up slowly into a seated position like a feral cat wound and licked the back of her right hand.<br />
<br />
The male leopard blushed at her beauty and nodded,&quot;Much better, I appreciate this more than you can ever imagine, I thank you female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need, Hacjuel&#39;s awakening is upon us and we are disciples,&quot; She replied then purred,&quot;Besides, it’s a perfect night to do what every male and female creature out there does, ‘tis the season~&quot;<br />
<br />
The leopard woman’s voice grew sultry as she crawled up over the male, her pussy releasing the feminine hormones calling him to mate with her, that she was fertile and ready for her motherly calling.<br />
<br />
The male smiled at her and said,&quot;Yes, you shall be the first to bear my seed then, and our kittens.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded to him and growled,&quot;You don’t know how much I need this right now! Clearly Hacjuel has called us together for this very reason, no?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; He replied smiling,&quot;Then let’s begin, before the humans uncover another forsaken treasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You, me, or a pregnant me?&quot; She replied then he growled,&quot;I correct myself, for it is all of the above, and... my wrath!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let us make haste then, while the night is young!&quot; She growled and he nodded to her then watched as the leopard woman eased herself down upon his erect cock.<br />
<br />
She moaned loudly and yowled,&quot;Oh great Hacjuel!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, is that all the patience your heat has to offer before orgasm?&quot; The male chuckled and she hissed back at him,&quot;You should be where I am if you’re so confident male!&quot;<br />
<br />
The male smiled and put his hands on the female&#39;s plump rear, and grunted as he thrusted upwards and pulled her hips towards him at the same time causing her to yowl and his dick to slip deeper into her tight folds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmrrrraaaagh!&quot; She yowled loudly, rubbing her tender breasts as she allowed the male to take the lead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Urgh! You’re first time too huh... rrrragh! You’re such a tight cute pussy cat,&quot; He growled thrusting a bit further into her tender folds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes, give me moraaarh! Breed meaaaagh!!&quot; She then screamed and climaxed for the second time tonight, roaring out into the night as her pussy clenched the male’s cock tightly from all sides.<br />
<br />
The male soon followed, roaring out pridefully as his seed sprayed into her fertile womb, overflowing it as they overflowed the surroundings with sounds of roars and blissful moans.<br />
<br />
The female was left panting, her tongue sticking out as she smiled of ecstasy and lust. The male chuckled then took off the amulet and bestowed it back to her, and graciously she accepted it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I can keep that and my new mate a bit safer if they were together. You can be the prophet of the new generation, our own oracle.&quot; He said smiling and kissed the female’s cheek.<br />
<br />
She rolled her eyes at him and hissed,&quot;I am a hunter, not a priestess, I’m getting off now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The male chuckled,&quot;You mean your cumming again? I didn’t know I was that powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
The female rolled her eyes, standing up and moaning as she put the amulet on around her neck. &quot;Tch, males,&quot; She thought to herself then the two paused and looked off as rags of lights could be seen in the distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans,&quot; The female hissed then the male stood up with a grin and said,&quot;I can take care of them for you, those torch beams don’t bother me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But their fast metal fire bows will, think twice, act once,&quot; She hissed back and the male&#39;s ears lowered and he nodded and whispered,&quot;right, so what now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I’m the leader now,&quot; the female though then on her own will decided to...</p>
