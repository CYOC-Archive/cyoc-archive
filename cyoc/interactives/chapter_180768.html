<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a quick pass around a little walking trail, Benjamin strutted back out through park&#39;s entrance, leading his bloodhound brother that was trotting along behind him. His first chance to take Jonathan out for a walk was everything he had secretly hoped for, even more! He had enticed his brother to give himself permission to be a little more canine. His brother was more of an eager walking partner now and less of a sourpuss. Oh, and not only that, Benji had totally hit it off with a hot babe. Maybe it was true what TV sitcoms said about a dog being a chick-magnet--Jon might have to be his permanent wing-man from now on!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile on the other end of the leash, Jon was looking sly and sporting a major blood-red boner as he walked. Being able to store scents and retrieve them like a dog can was like having his own personal porno that he could watch without anyone else knowing. Even their little jaunt through the woods was like having several movies he could sample all at once: every new inch of trail was telling him stories--stories about who and what had been there before him, how long they had stayed, how long ago they were there, and where they had gone off to after that. He could have followed some of the park-goers back to their homes, if he wanted to. And just like with the corgi, Jon was almost effortlessly able to pick and choose which scents would be needing a more thorough review from him later. He kept on wagging his tail the whole time, stoked about the exclusive new personal library he now understood he was building. He hadn&#39;t even considered that there might actually be PERKS to changing turning into a dog, and in all honesty, he was relieved that there were. He had really been starting to think that his life was basically over before he came here--that there would never be anything new for him accomplish or take pride in if he didn&#39;t end up finding a way to change back. Now he had a real-life superpower! Even so, he would still eagerly let go of his rewarding new muzzle-borne DVR if it meant he could still have a chance to be something more than his younger brother&#39;s tail-wagging mutt for the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
The comforting part of his outing so far, from Jon&#39;s perspective, was that he was basically just as much of a bloodhound (and therefore just as much of a human) as he was when he left the park bench. Since he hadn&#39;t given into any new urges that he hadn&#39;t already, he hadn&#39;t he hadn&#39;t had any major new changes, or at least that was the way he thought. The poor thing didn&#39;t have a clue that his and his brother&#39;s whole farce about holding back his urges really just a sham. Benji&#39;s lips were still sealed, of course, and no one else could determine that Jon still in any way remained human. Although he could speed up his changes by indulging his new instincts somewhat, his transformation was totally inevitable would be complete within three days (if the Chronivac was still working, that is). Nothing he could to would stave it off for more than a few hours or so, and there wasn&#39;t any method within his immediate control for him to change back.<br />
<br />
All at once, the capable inhuman snout sent back an urgent announcement into the young man&#39;s brain, causing his mouth start to water and making his furry light-brown tummy start to rumble. The instinct he was feeling now was a familiar to humans as it was to dogs--and it was especially familiar to any humans who had every skipped meals due to stress. There was something scrumptious up ahead, and Jonathan wanted something to eat badly!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Benji, is it OK for you to maybe get me a little light snack? I ... you know I didn&#39;t eat dinner,&quot; he said humbly, noticeably sniffing the air. &quot;There&#39;s a hot dog stand near by, maybe even you&#39;ll want one too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jon smiled warmly at his brother&#39;s puppy-dog pleading again and knew he had enough money in his pocket to say yes. &quot;Sure, Jon. Show me the way, boy.&quot; He figured it might be too much to ask his brother to resist all of the new-found food smells he must be getting bombarded with on an empty stomach, and it might be nice to let him get an impromptu snack the way a human would, instead of forcibly making this any more of a dog walk just yet.</p>
