<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Grrrr.&quot;  Your stomach grumbled.  You did tell Tharin that you were hungry as a joke, but it seemed as though you actually were.  However, you&#39;d sworn you wouldn&#39;t go out in the daytime to collect souls.  Considering the amount of time you&#39;d spent in Falrenkar, it must have been late morning or early afternoon.  However, when you looked at the little clock on the microwave, it read 4:30.  You entered the door at 4:30.  Either you spent 24 hours exactly in Falrenkar, or time didn&#39;t pass when you were gone.  Deciding that the latter was true, you tried to sense evil souls in the area.  After about a minute of searching, you discovered a clump of evil souls a couple of miles away.  &quot;Perfect.&quot;  You grinned a toothy grin, licking your lips in anticipation.  You snapped your fingers, making yourself invisible, walked over to your balcony, and took off in the direction of the soul cluster.<br />
<br />
You were praying to your lack of God for an interesting flight.  The 30 mile journey was too boring to comprehend, even with your nearly flawless demon mind.  Good thing it only lasted 25 seconds.  You landed in front of a seemingly normal house.  However, this house was full of truly evil souls.  Out of the 8 souls, only two souls were not yellow, and they were black as night.  You were going to have a feast worthy of a king, which at one point in you life, you were.  Funny how things come full circle.  Anyway, you decided to have fun with this group.  Still invisible, you walked to the house, where you walked through the door using the powers you loved so dearly.  Once inside, you noticed a group of people sitting trying to plot something.  You quickly gathered that these people were terrorists, and were plotting to systematically blow up important land marks all over Los Angeles.  Out of the 8 people, 6 of them were from ISIS, while the other two were American-born ISIS sympathizers.  You gathered that the two Americans were the two with the black souls, seeing how they were basically committing treason against America.  After surveying the situation, you tried to make a plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I have the bomb for Universal Studios, Ahmet will take Disney...&quot;  One terrorist started, but was interrupted by you becoming visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to intrude, but I have souls to collect.&quot;  You growled angrily, disgusted by the evil radiating off of their souls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Collect this!&quot;  One person yelled, pulling out a gun and firing directly at you.  You smiled as you caught the bullet in your fingers, proving your superiority over the gunman.  With the bullet still in tact in your hand, you laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that really the best you can do?&quot;  You continued laughing, playing with the bullet in your hand.  &quot;You know, that was not as fun as I thought it would be.  Maybe this will be.&quot;  You grinned as you flicked the bullet towards the gunman.  The bullet moved with speeds unobtainable by any gun, and became coated in black fire.  The bullet passed directly through the gunman&#39;s head, killing him instantly and setting him on fire with the black fire.  The black fire slowly dissolved his body, leaving nothing but a bright yellow soul.  You telekinetically forced the soul over to you where you took it and ate it in front of the remaining 7 people.  After eating a soul that tasted like a bag of potato chips, you burped.  &quot;Delicious.  Now, who&#39;s going to be seconds?&quot;  The terrorists were terrified, (pun intended) and had no idea what to do.  You started to play with them, choosing which soul would be next with Eenie Meenie Miney Moe.  Eventually, you pointed to the man who was talking before.  He seemed like the leader, although he was not one of the black souls.  You were saving those for last.  &quot;You!  What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ibrahim!&quot;  He screamed in terror.  &quot;Please don&#39;t kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why shouldn&#39;t I?  You were about to try to kill thousands!&quot;  You growled angrily.  &quot;You people are scum, and I am he who wipes away the scum.  When you&#39;re in Hell, remember Ral Gadnar.  I&#39;ll come to visit to make sure you&#39;re suffering enough.&quot;  You smiled as your red eyes started glowing green.  Immediately, Ibrahim started to distend.  This inflation continued until he eventually exploded.  Blood, bones and guts rained down around the whole room, covering the remaining 6 people.  You gathered the all of the gore into a ball, similar to what you did with the woman before, and solidified it.  By the time you were done, it looked like a large red crystalline sphere.  &quot;You know, I&#39;m going to keep this one as a decoration.&quot;  You smiled as you started to extract what seemed like energy from the ball.  You then opened a pit to Hell, where you dropped whatever you extracted from the ball.  Immediately, yellow soul number 2 appeared, and you ate it.  After closing the pit, you took the red orb and made it disappear, sending it to your mansion.  &quot;Now, soul number three.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please stop this!  We promise not to do anything anymore!&quot;  One man shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we have a volunteer.&quot;  You smiled evilly, raising your hand in front of you.  You pulled your hand closer to you, making the man&#39;s body rush towards your own against his will.  &quot;Your death will be fun.  For me.&quot;  You grinned as you lifted up your hand, creating a sword of pure blackness.  You then brought it down on the man, cutting him in half vertically.  You immediately opened up the pit for him, sending his body to Hell.  His yellow soul appeared, and you ate it right there.  You were starting to get a little full, but you couldn&#39;t end your killing here.  You needed to finish the job.  &quot;Ugh, all of these salty souls are making me thirsty.&quot;  You said hoarsely.  You used your powers to make a bottle of water appear.  While you were seemingly distracted, drinking the water, one person brandished a knife and threw it at you.  Without even looking, you caught the knife, made it disintegrate, and shot a bolt of energy in his direction, killing him and sending him to Hell instantly.  You took the black soul away, and proceeded to eat it.  It tasted like Ice Cream, the perfect thing to get rid of the saltiness in your mouth.  Once you were finished with your water and soul, you got extremely angry.  &quot;It&#39;s a shame really.  Attacking me when my guard was down, and making me kill the soul I was saving for last early.  A shame really.&quot;  You said patronizingly.  The final four people were cowering in fear, unable to even move.  &quot;Oh the fear of mortals.  It&#39;s so entertaining to me to make a mortal like you cower in fear.  Too bad I&#39;m never able to make it last.&quot;  You continued, trying to figure out how to kill these remaining people.  While you were contemplating, one person tried to stand up.  You immediately looked in his direction, terrifying him even more with your red eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please have mercy Mr. Gadnar.&quot;  He started.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s Lord Gadnar to you, and don&#39;t you forget it!&quot;  You yelled angrily, beginning to form a ball of black energy in your hand.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I&#39;m truly sorry Lord Gadnar.  Forgive me please.&quot;  He pleaded.  &quot;Since I know my death is inevitable, can I please repent quickly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.  Does anybody else want to try to repent?  Pray to their God.&quot;  You asked.  The other three raised their hands.  &quot;Fine, you can pray to your God.  However, I won&#39;t be listening.&quot;  You laughed as the four men started to pray.  You were watching their souls carefully, and noticed that they were not changing color at all.  After they finished, they stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we&#39;re ready.&quot;  One said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to hear something funny?&quot;  You started.  &quot;When I said that I wasn&#39;t listening, I wasn&#39;t kidding.  None of the evil from your souls has been lifted, and it never will be.&quot;  You conjured the black sword again, and cut your way through all four men with just one swing.  You immediately opened the pit to Hell, where they will suffer for eternity.  After they fell out of sight, three yellow souls and one black soul appeared.  You went to the kitchen of the house, got a plate, fork and knife out, and proceeded to eat the souls at the table like a regular meal.  Your meal consisted of souls tasting like an omelet, and pieces of salted buttered toast.  It was delicious.  Once you finished your breakfast, you left the house through the way you came in, making sure you became invisible first.  Once you were in front of the house, you turned back.  It still looked like your normal house.  Unable to cope with the fact that 8 terrorists were using it as a base, you wanted to destroy it.  You faced the house, and stared at it.  Your red eyes glowed a brighter red, and the house immediately blew up, waking up the whole neighborhood.  Happy with your annihilation, you flew back to your mansion.<br />
<br />
When you returned, you felt strange.  It wasn&#39;t a bad feeling, but it was weird.  Immediately, you figured out what was happening.  Souls 101 stated that after consuming enough souls, you&#39;d get even more powerful.  Considering you just ate 8 of the most evil souls in existence, there was no way you weren&#39;t powering up.  You could feel yourself changing.  You started growing taller, pushing 7 feet tall.  All of your muscles grew proportionally to your growth, and strengthened immensely.  However, the greatest change you felt was in your power.  You could feel yourself becoming more powerful, able to break the limits on what a demon could accomplish.  You were radiating unholy power to the point where a faint black aura surrounded your body.  Once the power-up was complete, you felt amazing, but extremely tired.<br />
<br />
You walked up to your bedroom, where you noticed that you were now too big for your bed.  There was an easy solution though.  Using your powers, you expanded the whole house proportionally to your growth.  Now everything was perfect for your new demonic form.  You also noticed the red orb you created out of Ibrahim.  You made a small pedestal on a table in your room, and put the orb there.  It was a beautiful, albeit macabre, centerpiece for the room.  Satisfied with your breakfast, you laid down on your new, bigger bed, and passed out.</p>
