<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had come back the following day since he had class and decided just to pick up the latest box of &quot;failures&quot;. He just figured he&#39;d be nice and save the trouble and cost of mailing them to him as he was here today. The box itself had some weight to it so there must&#39;ve been a few in there. Just thinking about it was making him feel a bit excited thinking about the possibilities inside. While he was carrying his box down one of the main hallways of the main building, he was blocked by a pair of young women. They were taking up the hallway chatting about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, do you two want to move? You&#39;re kinda in the way...&quot; Jeff said with some annoyance in his voice. He even hefted the box as if he were running an errand. Helpful prop this box of goodies was being. <br />
<br />
The pair of girls just talking to one another pretty much just ignoring Jeff and his box. So he tried again this time a bit more forceful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Get outta the way! Don&#39;t you see some of us have stuff to do?&quot; He growled his words as he stared at the pair.<br />
<br />
This time he&#39;d gotten their attention though, they were glaring right back. The first of the pair to speak to him was the taller girl wearing a generic name brand pink t-shirt and blue shorts. She had one of those nice runner&#39;s bodies about her... Jeff realized she&#39;d only gotten angrier at his staring.<br />
<br />
&quot;The hell is your problem? We&#39;re having a conversation... There&#39;s other hallways, go use one of them, yeah?&quot; She spouted as if she were better than him. The other girl grinned at her words before speaking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Why don&#39;t you just fuck off, huh?&quot; She giggled with a mean sneer. She was what some people might call a short stack. She might be barely reaching five foot tall... If she were taller though, that body of hers would be rocking those curves with tits and an ass like that... All that barely contained in a soft looking sweater and tight jeans.<br />
<br />
They went right back to talking seeming to be done with their attention to Jeff. Looking around to be sure that he wouldn&#39;t be caught again like the other day, he sat his box down and pulled out his phone. He wasn&#39;t even concerned with these two enough to use <br />
Stella to see just who they might be. All he saw was a pair of bitches that needed to learn their place. So once his box was safely on the ground he made as if he were dialing a number on his phone while he scanned them.<br />

With the pair scanned into the chronivac, he went about making their more appropriate forms to be... This was going to be another one outside of the norm but, it went so well last time. This would definitely be easier to do.<br />

Special Notes: Target will walk to the wall while removing all clothing. They will then bend over until they can reach around their legs. Their torso will stretch until their breasts lay on the floor with their head facing the wall. Any item shoved inside its vagina will be dissolved within thirty minutes of entry. The vagina will pull the object inside at a safe speed. <br />
<br />
Satisfied that he were finished with his entries, he looked up in time to see the pair staring back at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Creep, didn&#39;t we tell you to get lost?&quot; The taller girl growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... What she said...&quot; The shorter girl taking a &quot;menacing&quot; step forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, you two will be out of my way in a couple minutes anyway.&quot; Jeff mused.<br />
<br />
Just as they looked confused, Jeff hit enter... The pair stopped in their tracks and then kicked off their shoes. As they approached the empty space along the wall, more clothing feel free to the floor. Shirts, pants, socks, and panties from the tall one. Neither had elected to wear a bra and the short one even decided to go full commando. Either way once they got close to the wall the pair started bending at the waist. The neatly folded themselves in half prominently displaying their pussies for all to see.<br />
<br />
The shorter girl&#39;s lips were puffy but, neat while the taller girl&#39;s were tighter but, looking a little more flowery... With that set in place, the pair&#39;s changes went their separate ways. The shorter girl&#39;s torso stretched until her large breasts lay of the floor with her nipples hardening against the cold tiles. The taller girls legs started shrinking lower her breasts to the floor in a different way with much the same result. Tattoos formed on either side of their pussies denoting the expected materials each was now for. An outline of a soda can and the word aluminum on the shorter girl and an outline of a plastic bottle and the word plastic on the taller girl. Soon the transformation was at an end and they were now completely aware recycling bins.<br />
<br />
Collecting their clothing, Jeff rolled up the clothing into roughly cylindrical shapes and approached them. Yeah, sure their purpose was for their intended items but, Jeff knew they&#39;d take anything. Probably nothing new for them anyways, he chuckled to himself. So the shorter girl was first, he nestled her sweater against her snatch and watched as it swallowed it down with a little gusto. Her stomach bulging out a bit as the sweater was drawn deeper inside. So it went again for her jeans, her stomach bulging out even further and just a bit lumpy. The taller girl was given the same treatment, her shirt, shorts, and lastly her panties. The panties just vanished without even showing on their way down.<br />
<br />
With a satisfied sigh, he turned back to his box, glad to have put the trash where it belonged. While staring at his box, he decided he&#39;d actually peek inside of it now since he&#39;d already set it down. Opening the box with a grin on his face, his grin died immediately... Whether it was by a dare, a joke, or whatever... one of the balls wasn&#39;t like the others... Thankfully, the staff had segregated it from the others but, still there it was... One of the balls was sporting an average sized dick from what Jeff could figure... The rest were comparatively pleasant and dainty across from it, four in total. <br />
<br />
Picking the outlier out of the by the cloth is was laying on he approached the recycling girls one more time. Seeing how full the shorter one looked and how much of a bitch the taller one had been... She got the treat of getting to take a dick one last time. Settling the head of the dick against the pussy, Jeff watched as the thing was carefully swallowed inside. This definitely caused her stomach to bulge as it was lowered into its final resting place. Sure, they could&#39;ve been a victim of a cruel prank but, permanent was permanent. That and he had no need for any dicks besides his own, so tough luck buddy...<br />
<br />
He recollected his box now a bit lighter and closed the top. Off he went to class but, not before a quick trip to the bathroom. He really needed to wash his hands...</p>
