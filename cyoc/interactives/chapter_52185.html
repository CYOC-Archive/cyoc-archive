<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Standing just outside the door to Madame Lutulla's Shoppe, you wonder what you 
were going to do with your life now that things have made a huge change. You knew you 
couldn't go back to the way things were because you looked so drastically different. You 
had a thick beard that you didn't have before, which would be an easy fix if you weren't 
spotted by anyone you knew. If you were spotted, it may be a whole world of trouble. 
However, your beard was the least of your problems.</Br>
<Br>With the initial transformation, you gained a hell of a lot of muscle mass, making you 
look like one of those professional power lifters, with a thick layer of fat at your tummy, 
but was rock hard from all of the muscle behind it. You were furrier than you ever had 
been, even in your younger days, when you were your hairiest. Before, everything was 
light and average, now it was like a forest of hair everywhere except on your now massive 
biceps and triceps, from what you could feel there was none on your back and that 
massive bald spot that was on the crown of your head was completely gone. Those things 
were definitely not easy to explain away. Even though you were happy with what was given 
to you, to a degree, you sigh while heading over to the massive rock you saw which was a 
few feet from the entrance to her oddly placed shop in the middle of the woods. The 
majority of you was happy, especially with the longer and thicker package you got. You 
knew that even though a bear naturally had a small penis, with human and bear DNA 
mixed together, your package went from being an average girth to what looked like a soda 
can. Between the new muscles, hair and the new package, you had to say that the package 
had to be the best part.</Br>
<Br>Sitting on the rock, you flex your arms while placing your forehead on your massive 
hands, bent over and thinking about what you were going to do. Thoughts of the mediocre 
life you lived, the average house, job and car were what you enjoyed the most in life, even 
though it wasn't the most ideal, it belonged to you. Now, nothing really belonged to you 
and you were the odd man, no... odd werebear out. Even thinking that was hard, since you 
never even thought that such things existed. Werewolves were one thing, since they were 
in movies and role playing games, but werebears... you would have never guessed.</Br>
<Br>Knowing you were going to have to start over again, you replayed what Madame 
Lutulla said to you. The potion would give you control over your new form, but you would 
never be human again. You wonder how much control you had over your forms, so you 
decided to do a little experimenting. You decide to start off really small and really simple, 
focusing on all of your muscles, willing them to grow slightly. Within a matter of seconds, 
you feel your body start to swell slightly, tightening your tattered clothing. Looking 
yourself over, you could not believe that just a little bit more muscle made you look even 
more impressive. Happy with the way you were now, you wonder what else you should 
experiment with. Even though you wanted to continue, you knew that being in the middle 
of the woods probably wasn't the best place to try it out, in case a hunter or an 
unsuspecting normal human being stumbled upon you. Looking around, you realize that 
your senses were all heightened as well. Sights, smells and sounds were all coming to you 
at once and while it was a bit overwhelming at first, it was seriously exhilarating. You 
could tell if someone or something was coming a mile away, you could even tell that there 
was another building nearby, with the new smells coming to your nose. You wonder how 
exactly you could tell it was a building or what, but you decide to save that for another 
time.</Br>
<Br>Using your newly found powerful nose, you sniff the air constantly, finding your 
direction and then hone in on it. Heading in a general eastern direction, you walk through 
the forest being careful not to trip on a rock or something. As you could smell the scent 
getting stronger, you knew you were getting closer, you found yourself walking a bit 
faster than you had intended. Every step that you made, whether it was on a twig that 
snapped; blades of grass being scrunched with your weight; mud your feet sunk into 
making a popping noise as you pulled out; it was all fresh, clear and crisp like someone 
had plugged your ears into a very sensitive microphone. Getting closer now, you could 
really smell the scent of chopped and aging wood, like that of a log cabin and before you 
knew it, the place was before your very eyes. Wanting to be sure that no one was around, 
you hunkered down, being as quiet as you possibly could, which you found was relatively 
easy and you allowed your new scents to tell you the story of this place. Breathing in 
deeply, you could not smell the scent of any other animal or even a human being that has 
even been in the remote vicinity of this place. It smelled old, musty and... unused. Your 
eyes perked, your heart raced and your manly hair stood on end. This place was perfect, 
no one had been here in ages from what you could tell and that meant it was a good 
chance that no one would ever come around there again.</Br>
<Br>Getting back to your feet, you walked toward the cabin, finding yourself to be 
cautious like you were when you first approached the place. Nearing the windows, you 
peer in and with your new peepers, you can see it is dark and somewhat infested with 
cobwebs. The whole place had covers over the furniture riddled with dust and you felt your 
heart race with joy. This place really could be your new home, but you still approached the 
door and entered with caution. Just like you thought, as you opened the door, you could 
see the dust fly up with the fresh air blowing in, leaving scoring marks in its wake. 
Entering, you look around you to see the entire place being in the similar if not the same 
condition as the rest of the place, which told you chances were high that no one had been 
there in forever. Walking around, you find a massive stair case that led to a loft like space. 
Going up the stairs and into the space, you found that it was where a massive bedroom 
was, complete with a massive bed that you were sure would be able to hold your newly 
acquired massive body. As you turned to head back down the stairs to continue exploring, 
you could see all of your foot prints in the dust, with the treading of your shoes as well as 
where the tattered parts of fabric brushed along the flooring. It was like a new form of art, 
but you knew that if you were going to make that place your own, you would definitely 
need to take care of all the dust and make the place a bit more homely. Back downstairs, 
you found door at the base of the steps, which you hadn't noticed before you went up. 
When you opened it, you saw a large kitchen with an eat-in dining room, complete with 
furniture and all the appliances a werebear could need or want. Looking around, going 
through cabinets and the like, you found all the necessary cookware, dishes and so on, 
but there wasn't a bite to eat. Again, this just influenced the place being deserted. Looking 
around further, you found another door that led to a full bathroom complete with dust 
and more cobwebs. Thinking that this was all you were going to find, since it completed 
all of the space of the place that you could see from the outside, you step on something 
hard which depresses into the floor. A loud pop could be heard from the living room and 
your first instinct was to prepare to fight, as you feel your body edging on changing 
completely to give you new strength, skills and possibly abilities. Walking slowly into the 
living room you could see in the dim light from the almost full moon that the bookcase 
that was covered in cobwebs and dust had moved, or at least a section of it did. Moving 
further into the room, you could see that a part of it was uneven with the rest of the wall 
and your heart soared. You immediately recognized that you uncovered a secret 
compartment and your child-like curiosity kicked in, which meant you threw out all of your 
self imposed precautionary measures off to the side. Bounding toward the bookcase, you 
found that what you thought was a small opening was actually a rather large one. Putting 
your hand inside the opening, you pulled it open further and found that opened easier 
than you thought it would. As it left a ninety degree angle at the crease, lights came on 
one at a time and illuminated a stone staircase. Curiosity flooded your mind and without 
thinking, you went down the stairs, one at a time.</Br>
<Br>As you found yourself at the last step, lights came on in the entire room and the 
ones that illuminated the stairs went off, just as the hidden door shut. For the first few 
seconds, you wondered if you were going to be trapped down there, but that was also 
superseded by your curiosity. Wandering around, you found that the whole place was like 
the entire place that was upstairs, just on one flat floor plan. However, the only thing it 
didn't have was the kitchen, but everything else, including the necessary furniture was 
there. You knew that this would be the perfect place for you to test out how much control 
you really had over your form or forms for that matter. You knew that this was also the 
perfect place to live and you were going to find out if this place could be bought, but after 
your self experimentation. Standing there, you close your eyes and just focus on yourself, 
moving into a deep meditative state. Quickly, you stumble upon the animal presence 
within yourself and your eyes pop open in a flash. It startled you, even though you knew it 
was there, you just didn't realize how easy it would be to find it.</Br>
<Br>Wondering what else to try, you decide to strip down to nothing to ensure none of 
your clothes would get further damaged and so you could be as comfortable as possible 
with any changes that may come about. Focusing on your hair, you will yourself to grow 
just a bit more and just like your muscles, your body complied. Looking at your friend, 
even though he was mainly covered up by your belly, you could not help but to smile. 
Wanting to be able to see more of him, you willed your tummy to go down in fat and for 
that material to turn into more nutrient for your body. Like the snap of a finger, it melted 
away leaving just a bit of pudge and a whole lot of cock. Unbelievably, your cock looked 
like it was at least seven to eight inches in length and as fat as a soda can. Your heart 
soared and you wanted to play with him, but you reserved yourself for later. Even though it 
was a very low chance, you may be able to get one of your buds up to the cabin to enjoy 
your new self together. Going back to the task at hand, you focus on your entire body, 
wondering what it would be like to be in full werebear form.</Br>
<Br>Just like with everything else, within moments of thinking about it, it started to 
happen. Your muscles swelled just a bit more; hair thickened and covered everything while 
becoming more like fur; your hands and feet thickened up as pads developed on your 
palms and soles while your claws grew out; you could feel your face push forward while 
your teeth shifted to meet the needs and demands of your new form; as your face pushed 
out, your ears rounded and grew hairy while moving toward the top of your head; while 
your face finished forming into a snout, you could feel your nose change, flattening out 
while growing cold and moist; you even felt your cock and balls grow even more, but 
slightly, which made you want to play with them even more; and as the last bit of your 
change happened, mainly your body finalizing its new form, you felt the base of your 
spine lengthen slightly as your nubby tail formed.</Br>
<Br>When it was all over, you felt compelled to find a mirror and check out the new you. 
Looking around, remembering where everything was... to a degree of course, you 
remembered where the mirror was and you went up to it. As you came into view of 
yourself, you could not help but to smile. You looked amazing in your werebear form, 
covered in massive muscles, thick and rich chestnut colored fur, sporting a nice piece of 
wood and grapefruit balls to match. You hoped that the fat you reduced went to your balls 
to help produce a healthy batch of seed. You knew you could make your balls produce as 
much as you wanted, but you were more curious to see what they would make on their 
own. Deciding what to do next, you stand there silent and...</Br></p>
