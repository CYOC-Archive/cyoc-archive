<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But Andrew never got another chance to sneak away and so in the end he went with the flow of things. He even enjoyed it, even if something in the back of his mind said that something was horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
And now they'd finally returned to Dani's and Maria's home, their parents not yet home and Maria announcing, &quot;I'm going to call some friends and we can have a sleepover,&quot; and headed for the phone in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Andrew tries to get Dani's attention, but his friends not paying the slightest bit attention. Frustrated, Andrew sits down. Suddenly he remembers the yellow egg and withdrawing it from the purse, he begins to work it in the same fashion that the other one opened up. And after a bit of working it, it does open. But what's inside is not what Andrew was hoping for.<br />
<br />
The egg twists open and out falls three more pieces of fabric, each tightly rolled up. Picking up two of them Andrew sees that they're girl's underwear. Closer inspection reveals that one is for a young female, &quot;About five or six,&quot; Andrew thinks to himself, not knowing how he knows this and the second one he picks up he can already tell that it's for a girl his age. Frustrated, he begins to stuff the three pairs of underwear back into the egg and as Maria walks into the room, he puts the egg back into the purse, unaware that one of the pairs of panties didn't wind up back in the egg, but inside the purse instead.<br />
<br />
As Maria walks toward Andrew and hands him a pair of pink and white pajamas, she explains, &quot;Jenny, Elizabeth and Tanya are all on there way over. You'll want to change into some pajamas. I thought the new pair I bought you would look really cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew is about take them, but instead he asks, &quot;Don't you think this has gone far enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria laughs and tells him, &quot;Oh no! I want to punish both you and my brother for dressing in my clothes and for being in my room. And on Monday, you'll be going to school dressed like a girl. Plus, you'll meet Mark for your date. Only then, I might let you off the hook. Watching you become embarrassed is going to be such fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that said, she dumps the pajamas on the couch and begins to leave the room. As she is leaving, Maria tells him, &quot;If you don't cooperate, I could call your mother back and tell her what you were doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You called my mother,&quot; Andrew sputtered as he picked up the pajamas.<br />
<br />
Maria laughs and says, &quot;I called her and explained that you'd be spending the night over at Dani's and she said that it was fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to come up with anything, Andrew watched her leave. Upset on how things where turning out, he walked upstairs, saw the light was on in Maria's room and instead entered the bathroom. There he dumped the pajamas on the sink, along with the purse. Opening the door, he went to Maria's room and seeing her talking to Dani, Andrew waited.<br />
<br />
When she was finished, he told her, &quot;I'm taking a shower. Unless that messes up some plan of yours!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria giggled and told him, &quot;Don't be silly. Let me show you where the towels are and the hygiene supplies are,&quot; and with that said, she pushed past Andrew and disappeared into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Andrew entered just as she was pulling a hand towel, a wash clothe, a body towel and a sponge of some type, something Andrew thought might be called a loofah sponge, out of the closet. Seeing Andrew, Maria explained as she set down some hygiene supplies, &quot;Everything you need to use is here and I expect you to use it, or I'm calling your mom, as well as my parents.&quot; and with that said, she exited the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Andrew picked up the body wash, a product called Strawberry Bathe, and just sighed. Wondering how to get out of this, he began to get undressed. After that, he ran the shower water and then got in.<br />
<br />
Washing himself with breasts and a feminine body was a whole different experience and Andrew actually enjoyed it, especially the way the sponge and body wash felt against his soft skin. Smelling strongly of strawberries, Andrew exited the shower and began to dry himself off.<br />
<br />
He didn't quite understand how he knew how to dry himself off, but he just did. The hand towel was used to dry his hair, at which point he found another and wrapped that around his head. Next he took the body towel and dried himself off with that. Wrapping that around his body so that everything from his breasts down to his crotch was covered, Andrew went over to the sink to put on the pajamas. It was then that he noticed that purse had tipped over, which didn't bother him, but also that Maria had apparently entered the bathroom while he was washing; for next to the pajamas was now a pair of underwear.<br />
<br />
Thinking sarcastically, &quot;Thanks,&quot; Andrew picks up the underwear, noting that they're white with what appears to be pink mice on the front, and puts them on.<br />
<br />
The moment he does, a tightening sensation can be felt and Andrew wonders, &quot;What the hell,&quot; as a ticklish feeling can be felt inside of his groin and lower abdomen. But before he can dwell on it, the feelings pass and suddenly Andrew notices that he feels different. If he didn't know any better, he would have described the feeling as being more feminine.<br />
<br />
Scared, he takes the towel off and looks down past his breasts. Where there is suppose to be a lump, is only smooth fabric, that is slightly big in the front and in between the legs. Spooked beyond belief, Andrew reaches down the underwear, only to pull his hand back in shock. Quickly he pulls down the underwear down and it quickly becomes apparent why they are kind of big as Andrew looks into a full body mirror on the back of the door and takes in his new privates.<br />
<br />
He, now she, is shaved and Andrew can see that she has a camel toe and memories tell her that she's had that since sometime after puberty began. Without thinking about, Andrew pulls the underwear off and sits down on the toilet. Reaching over to the hygiene supplies that Maria left out, she selects a bottle of lotion and proceeded to apply that to her body.<br />
<br />
Feeling cleaner, thinking she smells nice, Andrew begins to get dressed. White panties with pink mice on the front, a spaghetti strapped tank top and a pair of matching pink and white cotton pants, that are buttoned just below the knees and show off her lower legs.<br />
<br />
And just as she's reaching for the doorknob, Andrew tells herself, &quot;No! This has gone on long enough. It's time I told someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Opening the door, Andrew called out, &quot;Maria, can you come here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing Maria exit her bedroom and ask, &quot;What,&quot; Andrew just made a come here gesture and ducked back into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
She didn't have long to wait as Maria entered and asked her question once again. Instead of answering, Andrew started off by apologizing for taking her clothes and then began to explain the events that had led up to her taking Maria's clothes; the arcade, the eggs and the prizes inside. After that she explained what had just happened now and to offer proof, Andrew first lifted up the tank top and then after that pushed her pajama pans and underwear down, exposing her privates to the other girl.<br />
<br />
Maria only stared for a minute and then scoffed. &quot;You expect me to believe all that? What you have on your chest and what you have covering you penis and testicles, any one can buy those at a novelty shop or even on the internet. Stop fooling around Andi, or I'm calling your mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Downstairs the doorbell rings and Maria says, &quot;Our guest have arrived. I expect you and Dani to act accordingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Desperate, Andrew reached for the purse and with drew the pink and yellow eggs. Handing them to Maria, Andrew said, &quot;At least open the eggs and see that I'm telling the truth. They open by pushing inward and twisting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria sighed and said, &quot;Fine,&quot; and began working the pink egg. She pushed inward and then twisted. Opening the egg, she found nothing. Tossing it back to Andrew, she said, &quot;Very funny Andi,&quot; and left, still holding the yellow egg, muttering dark comments about people who would try anything to get out of the trouble their in. <br />
<br />
Pulling up her pajama pants and underwear and then pushing down her shirt, torn between liking how they felt on her soft skin and how odd it was that she was in this predicament, Andrew left the bathroom and vowed that one way or another, he would get back to that arcade either tomorrow or Monday.</p>
