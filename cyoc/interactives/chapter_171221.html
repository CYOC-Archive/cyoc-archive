<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John closed his eyes as he felt the transformation agent enter his arm, he had read that the entire transformation would take around 5 minutes with a max of 10 minutes. His arm felt warm as the agent rushed up his arm and he thought for a moment he could feel it in his own heart before spreading across his entire body. Maybe he was just imagining it but he swore he could feel it. Then for a long moment nothing seamed to change he began to look around as he did he noticed that the salt water no longer hurt his eyes. He could look though it as if it was air.<br />
“My eyes have changed.” He thought as he looked toward his sister, he could see her clearly now and noticed that her dirty blonde hair had shifted colors. It was losing the blonde and becoming a rich brown instead. Like him a mermaid was looking after her, while a few others moved around. He focused on that mermaid, she had bright neon green hair. He wasn’t sure if it was some kind of coloring or maybe with everything else unnatural hair color was now natural. <br />
“You are doing great.” said the mermaid nurse as he looked back at her. “You heard me didn’t you?” <br />
A quick nodded confirmed it.<br />
“Well…you are doing great you are in what we like to call phase 1, your body is adapting to the sea. Hearing, sight, taste…well you can’t taste anything but plastic from the guard at the moment and the like we will know when phase 1 is done when you get your gills. There is some cosmic changes that happen during this time as well but they are minor care to see.” <br />
Before John could even nodded his head in conformation the nurse reached to a side table and pulled out what he thought for a moment was a golden hand mirror, only to realize that it wasn’t gold but bronze. He remembered from his science class that Bronze withstood salt water better then most. Then all thought of metal left his mind as he looked up into his own face, however his eyes had changed from a green to a sky blue and his hair had turned from a dirty blonde leaning more into the brown then the blonde to a light blonde. <br />
He was transfixed by his image that he didn’t feel at first the pain in his side, the nurse noticed the small amount of blood at once and began to rip the air line out of him. He bite down on the plastic not wanting to give up on air but with each passing moment he found it harder and harder to breath. Then with a tug the air line was ripped out and water flooded into his mouth. He closed his mouth and tried to hold his breath.<br />
“It’s alright…take your first breath of the sea.” Reassured the mermaid as his lungs burned and burned before he gave him. The water fully filled his lungs and then passed over his gills and out of his body.<br />
“There…you are ok.” Said the nurse as John took a few calming breaths.<br />
“I am…” he said then he noticed his voice was higher.<br />
“Well know you enter phase 2 and that will not be kind for you.” Said the nurse as John was about to ask why when he felt his shoulder blades snap inwards as his broad shoulders narrowed. His frame began to shake as his whole body began to spasm. He could feel himself lose muscle mass; he had worked so hard to get as close to a six pack as possible, but he felt those muscles disappearing. He felt his hips widen a bit even as his legs grew longer. In the mirror which the nurse still had up he watched as his strong jawline smoothed out, his Addams apple vanished, and his lips grew fuller. For a half a second, he seamed to be about half way between a woman and a man, when the process speed up. His skin smoothed out his short now brownish blonde hair turned into a paler and paler, losing all the brown and the blonde, until it became an almost silvery white color as it began to grow longer until it reached his shoulders. He raised his head and looked down, his body was now narrower and a strange mix of both shorter and longer. From the waist up he was shorter but his legs where growing longer. <br />
“In preparation to becoming a tail.”  He thought as suddenly he felt like he had been kicked in the balls. He wanted to shot his arms to his privates but while he was focused on the changes he failed to notice two merman had swum up and they grabbed his hands before they could move. He winced in pain and then he felt a pulling sensation and he knew what that meant. He was no longer a man…he was now a woman; tears began to flow even under the water as pressure built up in his chest as two breasts pushed out. He watched them advance, they had covered his chest with seaweed wraps but he could see them push out. <br />
“Large A cups…maybe a small B.” thought John “At least I am not some blonde hair bimbo mermaid.”<br />
There was only one thing left to do and it happened, his now her legs where pulled together as they began to merge together. Skin grew over the gap, even as bones and muscles moved around. As the skin advanced it began to harden into a scale pattern. The scales turning a mix of white, silver and sky blue even has his legs grew out into a long set of fins with light sky blue membrane. A likewise membrane also sky blue grew between her fingers at the joint.<br />
“There you are done.” Said the mermaid which had been helping him. “Lets set you up.”<br />
His whole body was shaking as he was sat helped up, he didn’t even notice the pressure of the water, no more if it had been air. He expected to be turned toward his sister only to be instead turned toward the dock. There a large mirror was set up and he saw himself…well herself for the first time as a mermaid.<br />
What looked back at him was a rather attractive young woman, of age with what he had been as a man. She was short for sure, maybe one of those girls who would be lucky to see over 5 feet in height but still very hot, long hair and a good but small chest, a large chest on a small frame would have been bad. She was activity for sure, then there was the stuff that made her a mermaid. A silver, white and blue tail which went very well with the silver/white hair and deep blue eyes.<br />
“You turned out very well.” said the mermaid nurse as tears began to flow from his…well her face as she put her now smaller hands into her face and began to cry. John…his life had died…it had been reborn as this silver mermaid and she had no idea what to do next.</p>
