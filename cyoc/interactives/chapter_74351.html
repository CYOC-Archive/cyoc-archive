<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Returning her hug you roll the flashlight in your hand, thrilled at the opportunity that has presented itself. By the end of the day you're sure that you'll be able to get exactly what you want and make it so that Christina never ends up dating a jerk ever again because if all goes well she'll be dating you. At the start you never would have thought that you'd be doing this, but something about just the little changes you've made to her, specifically the thought of her inch and a half long clit-cock. For some reason you find it strange and attractive in equal measure. Because she's naked you can actually feel it against your leg, more than that, you realize that it's half hard. It seems that Christina really is attracted to girls, more than that, she's attracted to you, which means that what you'll be doing to her is perfectly justified. After all, you're not attracted to girls, but when you're done she won't be a girl.<br />
<br />
Perhaps these thoughts are your way of justifying what you're about to do, but even if things go wrong, you reassure yourself that you can always just use the light to change her back to normal and forget about all of what happened. After all, you're the only one who will know what happened due to the light's power to adjust reality.<br />
<br />
When she lets go of you and steps back, looking very embarrassed, you smile reassuringly at her, &quot;Rodger was a total jerk, and you're done with him, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Christina says softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, because he was horrible for you,&quot; you try to encourage yourself as much as her with your next words, &quot;And you're done with guys too, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; she says even more softly, &quot;I mean I think the way I feel around girls is the way most girls feel around guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing wrong with that,&quot; you say gently, ready to begin the next part of your plan, &quot;But I bet Rodger made you feel that there was.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nods, and says something too quiet for you to hear.<br />
<br />
Very carefully you continue, &quot;I bet Rodger made you feel bad about a lot of things, like your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; she says quickly, and with enough strength that you have to fight back a cheer, &quot;He made me feel like if I looked and dressed differently I wouldn't feel so weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All those things he said about your body are lies, you're beautiful the way you are and I can help you see that,&quot; you hold up the flashlight, &quot;This is a magic flashlight, it's power is to make people feel better about their body. I bet that each time I shine it on a part of you you'll be able to think of one thing about that part that makes you proud.&quot;<br />
<br />
This makes her giggle, &quot;Like you're going to 'highlight' all my positive features?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You laugh as well, but for very different reasons, &quot;All of your features are positive and I can tell you exactly how. Are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nods slowly and spreads her arms, &quot;Let's give it a try.&quot;<br />
<br />
You think that part of the reason she's so eager to go along with you is because she's relishing the change to display her naked body to another girl. Perhaps she's even hoping that you are as attracted to her as she has been to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome,&quot; you turn the light to a low-medium pink setting and shine it on her chest, watching as her d-cup breasts shrink slightly.<br />
<br />
She remains silent and you turn the light's setting even lower, causing her breasts to shrink down to a perky little b-cup, &quot;Come on, there has to be something there you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina smiles and gently rubs her reduced breasts, &quot;Well, I guess that it's a good thing that they're so small. I mean yeah big breasts are attractive, but I feel bad for the girls who have back problems because of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
You put the light to an even lower pink setting reducing her breasts even further to a scant a-cup and she continues, her face brightening, &quot;Rodger made me wear a padded bra to look more like the other girls, which I hated. Now that he's gone I can go back to not wearing bras, which is nice. I'd hate it if I had to wear a bra all the time. They feel so restrictive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a chance you flip the light so that it's at a very low blue setting, shining it carefully across her chest, taking care not hit her breasts and make them vanish completely. After all, you don't want to make her a total guy if you don't have to, you just want to get her to a state you find sexy enough to date and you think that her barely budding breasts are cute it a way. Under the low blue light her chest becomes slightly more toned, you're able to keep her breasts, but beneath them there is an obvious amount of muscle. Pleased, you move the light up to her shoulders, which widen slightly, and then down her arms, where you can see muscle developing.<br />
<br />
Christina looks at her arms and smiles, making a show of flexing. Her muscles would not be terribly impressive on a guy, but they're at a state where most girls would have to do quite a bit of working out to get, &quot;I'm fit too. That's pretty cool, right? I mean yeah I'm not bulked up out of my mind, but ever since grade school I've been able to do pushups better than any other girl I know, pull-ups too. I like working out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It shows,&quot; you say excitedly, bringing the light down to her stomach and watching as the faintest suggestion of abs become visible, &quot;Have you started doing situps or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she pats her stomach, &quot;And I think it's starting to show too. I'd have better results if not for Rodger taking up so much of my time and keeping me from working out. Now that he's out of the picture I'm going to start working out again and getting serious about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; you ask, bringing the light lower, to shine it on her legs, taking care not to get it between her legs. The more you think about it, the more you decide you want her to keep her clean shaven pussy and little clit-cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah. I'm not going to try to get hugely muscular, mostly because I don't want to end up looking like a guy,&quot; she laughs and runs her hands over her now narrow hips to emphasize, &quot;I don't think girls who look like muscle bound Amazons are hot and I don't want to end up looking like one, but I do want to see if I can get a bit better tone than I am now, and maybe get a proper six-pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn the light off and take a step closer to her, &quot;You mind if I take a closer look at you, maybe shine some light one one last thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes light up when she sees where you're looking, &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Putting the light down on her bed you kneel down in front of her so that you are at eye level with her crotch you stare at her clit-cock, licking your lips hungrily as it grows fully erect, its little, perfectly formed head slipping past the foreskin. When it reaches its full inch and a half glory you take it in your mouth, hardly able to believe what you're doing. Christina lets out a moan, which drives all doubt from your mind. You flick her clit-cock with your tongue a few times before letting your tongue slide down past its base where it meets her pussy and further still, to her flush and full pussy lips, just starting to grow moist with her arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never thought that you'd do this to me,&quot; she gasps, &quot;I've been wanting this since we first met.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your only response is to plunge your tongue further into her pussy. You're amazed by how much you're enjoying this, especially how good her salty-sweet pussy juice tastes to you. You could suck her off and eat her out all day and if the way Christina is moaning and bucking her hips is anything to go by, she feels the same way too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes! Yes! That's the spot,&quot; she moans, grabbing you by the hair and pressing your face hard against groin, &quot;Oh! Suck my clit until I cum!&quot;<br />
<br />
As much fun as you're having making your friend moan and squirm, you think that it might be time to change things up a little.<br />
<br />
Pulling back you smile up at her, &quot;How about you return the favor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before she can say anything you've stood up and are taking your shirt off and throwing your bra to the floor, presenting your perky b-cup breasts to her. She takes one look at your nipples, pink and practically begging for attention and she knows exactly what to do. Bending down she takes one of your nipples in her mouth sucking hard and flicking her tongue across it. She attends to your other breast with her hand, groping and squeezing until you're moaning uncontrollably. One of your hands finds its way down to your pants and you unzip your fly and slide your fingers into your panties to finger your plush slit.<br />
<br />
Christina realizes what you're doing and practically shoves you down on to the floor. Above you, she turns so that you are once again facing her clit-cock and she strips off your pants and panties, giggling at what she sees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow you look hot down there, just a little bit of hair and such a tight little slit, but where's your clit?&quot;<br />
<br />
You squirm and try to finger yourself, but she pushes your hands away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this it?&quot; she slides one of her fingers down and gently rubs your clit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; you gasp, &quot;That's it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This cute little thing?&quot; she rubs you again, teasing, &quot;It's not even a mouthful!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she gently brushes her lips over your clit before plunging her tongue into your pussy.<br />
<br />
You gasp, but she silences you by bringing her clit-cock down into your open mouth and you oblige, eagerly sucking on it as she eats you out. Juice form her pussy drips down onto your face and you lick lap it up, enjoying every sticky drop, drawing your tongue across her slit to get more of the delicious juices. Without a doubt, Christina's pussy is the best thing you have ever tasted and the feeling of her mouth at your pussy, tongue thrusting in deeps and then withdrawing to flick across your clit is the best thing you have ever felt.<br />
<br />
You have no clue how long you two spend sixty-nining, but eventually you are both too exhausted to continue.<br />
<br />
Christina rolls off of you with a heavy sigh.<br />
<br />
Pussy tingling from all of the pleasure she gave you, you shift position so that you are lying next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing,&quot; she gasps, her shoulder length hair a tangles mess around her face, &quot;I came so many times.&quot;<br />
<br />
She reaches out and gives your nipples a gentle squeeze. As sensitive as you are right now that touch alone is enough to send one last orgasm jolting through you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same here,&quot; you gasp out as soon as you're able to catch your breath.<br />
<br />
For a time you lay side by side in the swelteringly hot room, until Christina finally sits up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a shower so bad right now,&quot; she laughs and licks her lips, &quot;So much pussy juice.&quot;<br />
<br />
You join in her laughter, wondering what will happen next. Against all logic, it seems that you have a girlfriend now despite never having been attracted to girls in the past, and more surprisingly, you couldn't be happier about it. Just being around Christina makes you feel happy and more than a little horny and it's obvious that she feels the same about you.<br />
<br />
You sit up next to her and she pulls you into a deep kiss, which you happily return. The feeling of her little breasts and the muscle beneath them pressed against yours and her strong arms wrapped around you makes you feel so safe and secure.<br />
<br />
When she at last breaks the kiss she smiles at you, her eyes shining with happiness, &quot;I'm so lucky to have a girlfriend like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; you say without hesitation. Before today you never would have imagined having a girlfriend and you don't think that you're a lesbian, but there's no denying your feelings toward Christina.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; she says with a smile, &quot;Care to join me in the shower?&quot;<br />
<br />
As much as you want to say yes, you take a moment to think.</p>
