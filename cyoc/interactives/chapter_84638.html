<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Midnight was standing there, being highly nervous as shi was now wearing what could be described as a partial tux. Thanks to Danna, with what she put on the inside, it was preventing the outfit from pulling. They had decided that where Midnight was originally born male, shi&#39;d wear a tux and Talia would wear a very long gown. Luna had been designated as Midnight&#39;s &quot;Best Man&quot;, Midnight had asked Ryles and Raul to be the &quot;groomsmen&quot;. Talia had selected Lia as the Matron of honor, Flake and Alexis were the Brides maids, and as for Danna and Mikkie, they made the outfits. Snowflake and Janice were going to act as Ushers. As young as they were, during rehersal, they got teased because Janice had finally got tired of waiting for Snowflake to make hir move. So Janice took hir best friend, and planted a deep and passionate kiss right on hir liips. Snowflake was shocked at first but press into it with an audible purring Snowy and Sally were both there and were happy. As they knew it&#39;d be those two becoming mates, but what was a shock is they looked at each other as best friends still, but at the same time as much more. Diamond and Reca had become the ring barers. Considering how close the two were born. Fluffy and Marry were the flower girls, and the residing priest, well, turns out to be as a favor to Jess, hir father. Justin, being royalty, well, shi had some sort of power to perform cerimonies. Francine was helping with the decorations, telling... er demanding where everything goes. Midnight had a surprise for Talia, and had asked that the cake be made during the wedding then as a surprise be brought in. Shi had struggled, in the past six years to keep hir from going to the south side of town, for shi had a gift for hir. It was agreed, by Raul and Maria that they&#39;d help with building a home that Talia would be accustomed, grant it the statue Talia had known, but this... this was different.<br />
<br />
As everyone was greeting each other and as guests and family had arrived. To their surprise a Jackat walked right up. Shi looked familiar but Midnight couldn&#39;t place where, until shi spoke up. &quot;Greetings Talia, greetings Midnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you the President of Egypt?&quot; Came Sally&#39;s voice from behind hir daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Former President. I resigned last year and it&#39;s left to another Kat. It would seem nations which had changed, like France, and Italy, have decided, with permsion with the UN, returned to what they once had, having kings and queens, or emperors and empresses. Well, Egypt went back to the ancient times with Pharohs. They figured that seeing as with the adjusting, and they say it&#39;s temporary, it may be wise to have a leader who isn&#39;t elected for the time being. Which all things considering, I think it&#39;s for the best. However, I do have news for you, Miss Sally, those two that proceeded to rape you, have been put to death. And I, well, have wondered if... perhaps a former president could make hir residency here in your humble town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. President, we welcome you with open.... arms.&quot; Sally tried to swallow as she was blocking out the insident that had occured due to some Jackats. Shi didn&#39;t blame the man in front of hir but still was warry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Kairo works. Yes I know, it&#39;s like the city I was in charge, but it&#39;s my mom&#39;s idea.&quot; Shi chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, welcome, Kairo.&quot; Talia walked up and shook hir hand. &quot;Please, have  seat.&quot; Shi directed and Kairo nodded doing so.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Once the last of the guests had arrived, thankfully it was for rehearsal, they had got up front to prepare for for the actual wedding. Midnight looked at Talia and smiled. The rehearsal went off without a hitch, meaning they were ready for the actual wedding. After the rehearsal, Midnight had asked to talk to Snowy and Maurice alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Midnight?&quot; Maurice had asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was wondering, if there was a way you can engineer my dna, to um... well.... to give me wings.&quot; Shi asked nervously. &quot;You see, I wanna fly with Talia out of the chapel, but I want it to be a surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowy smiled. &quot;Well, you know, I was wondering when you&#39;d ask. After all, it was after you and hir started to grow close, it was only a matter of time. So, me and Maurice have been working night and day on something, and I believe it is what you want. You see, we did find some of Talia&#39;s blood from a cut and extracted it, years ago, after Cairo. And engineered a special syrum. This will take a week to take effect, perfect time to hide it. As for the unvailing of hir surprise, we have it set so when you take hir there, shi would be able to see when ment to.&quot; Showy walked up, and injected two needles into Midnight, on each side.<br />
<br />
Midnight smiled. &quot;I guess I should&#39;ve asked if it&#39;d affect my pup, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;PUP?&quot; Maurice said. &quot;You mean you&#39;re pregnant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does Talia, Sally, or Charlie know?&quot; Snowy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, Talia knows. We&#39;re going to tell mom and dad after the wedding.&quot; Shi said and hugged the two. &quot;But I think I best get back home. Talia will worry.&quot; Shi giggled and Midnight headed out.<br />
<br />
Snowy giggled. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go talk to Sally and Charlie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to tell them, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am.&quot; Snowy giggled. &quot;But only cause they are trying to figure wedding gifts for the two.&quot; Shi headed out to tell them.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Snowy had found Diamond sitting there frowning, as shi was headed there. Shi stopped and looked. &quot;Dia, sweety, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My sisters don&#39;t like me.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense, sweetheart. What about Reca?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reca does, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here, hun.&quot; Snowy sat down and rubbed Diamond along the back. Shi then looked up and thought. &quot;Why did me and Maurice have to do that? Make that stupid ass virus.&quot; Shi said to hirself. &quot;Dear, they love you, they may not show it, but look at Midnight and Luna, your eldest siblings. You know they were adopted too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y... yes.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do know they love you right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so.&quot; Diamond replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, there&#39;s no guess so. All your siblings love you. If one of the others came up to tease you, even if they would not admit it, dear, they&#39;d hurt them.&quot; Snowy lifted the pup up. &quot;Besides, perhaps they&#39;re jealous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;J... jealous? Of what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sleak, and cool fur. I mean come on, I wish I had fur like that. So smooth, and warm.&quot; Snowy didn&#39;t mean it, but only said it to cheer the pup up. Which worked. Shi nuzzled into hir. When Snowy sat hir down, the pup ran off.<br />
<br />
During their talk Sally walked up. &quot;What was that about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Dia is very much sensitive right now. Shi feels like the odd ball.&quot; Snowy giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, poor dear. So you ready for the wedding?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly. But on that note, I think I know what you can get Midnight and Talia both.&quot; Shi said to Sally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? I am all ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Midnight and Talia both are pregnant.&quot; Snowy giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hun, you&#39;re telling me something I known already. And no, they didn&#39;t tell me. I can see their faces. It reminds me of Luna when shi had hirs.&quot; Sally giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Well, I think things are going to be growing. Funny, Janice was supposed to be very small, now it&#39;s the center hub for kats.&quot; Snowy gave a slight giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it has. And we got a few new residents with in such a short short time.&quot; Sally giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you nor Jess talk of your mother, any idea on what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, last I heard, shi was doing studies in Antarctica. We last contact with her several years before the very first outbreak so we just assumed she was gone. Dad and her had already been devorced, so we just moved on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Sally, perhaps it&#39;s time we search for her.&quot; Came a voice from behind. &quot;Mom has been missing for far too many years. And assuming she&#39;s dead, even if she is, she deserves to be home with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally smiled looking at hir sister. &quot;Well, then, what do you say, we have a week before the wedding, we go for a trip down there and search.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we&#39;ll wait until after the wedding. Either way, mom will be coming home with us.&quot; Jess walked up to hir sister. &quot;It&#39;s time for her to be home with her girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally only smiled. &quot;You&#39;re right. And if she is a live, she&#39;ll get one hell of a shock when she sees you and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess giggled. &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Shi sat there as they watched.</p>
