<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Terri's father's actions were a bit perplexing. He may have liked me as a son-in-law, but he had never supported Terri financially, at least as far as I remembered. In many cases, I had even thought that he didn't really like his daughter. After all, with as much money as he had, wouldn't he have done more to support Terri and her sisters? During our marriage, Terri had told me that all of them had to work part time during high school and through college to pay for college, and they were still paying off the loans as far as I knew. Maybe it was a tough love sort of thing. I really didn't know.<br />
<br />
I also didn't know for sure if Kevin was going to continue with the scheme that he, Night, and Terri cooked up to get Devon either arrested or shot dead by the police. The quarry was not some place Devon would be expected to be, and as we had entered, I had noticed that there were a fair number of cars parked in employee and visitors parking spots before descending into the large pit that the quarrier's had dug out to get at the rock being quarried there. That might create problems, and if the police arrived too far away from sunrise, there would be no guarantee that Terri, Night, myself and any innocent that Devon had lured into his pack would be able to escape... at least not without attracting a lot of negative attention. At the moment, though, I didn't really have time to focus on that. I had Devon Lycos standing in front of me under a rising full moon.<br />
<br />
The revelation that he was my boss was one thing, but seeing him up close was another. I'd never been high enough in the chain of command to see him up close before. The times when I had seen him was at a few scattered office parties, and I was far enough away that I couldn't make out much. All I could see was that he was with an incredibly hot woman, though some of that might have because Devon Lycos's wife, Jenni, commonly wore attire that showed off her rather impressive assets. But seeing him up close, now, was more than enough for me to see why Terri and Night had some reason to be nervous around him or about him.<br />
<br />
Devon Lycos was built like a tank. He was easily a few inches taller then I was, and his shoulders were much broader then mine. In addition, his clothing looked like it was straining to contain a very large amount of muscle. And all of that was likely to get bigger as the moon rose higher. It was enough to make me slightly nervous, but his actions with regards to Fred's wife was enough to keep me angry. If he wanted to be dominant and the Alpha in Fangton, that was perfectly fine. With all the women around him, me, Night, and Terri, he had no reason to fear me, but Francine Jones was innocent. Fred Jones was innocent. What Devon had done was wrong and unforgivable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... this... this will be good,&quot; Devon gave a half smile as he began to disrobe, &quot;You'll LEARN to obey me!&quot;<br />
<br />
I noticed out of the corner of my eyes that Jenni and many of the other women there were beginning to take their clothes off as well, and I had a good understanding why. Our wolf forms were too big for human clothing, and we'd destroy them if we didn't take them off. And as the moon rose higher, I could feel my own wolf &quot;screaming&quot; within me to come out. I could feel a few beads of sweat going down my face, and within my pants I could feel my penis beginning to become erect. I wanted to change... I needed to change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Orr... you could let us go,&quot; I growled back at him, seeing if I could get him to go for Night's original idea of dividing Fangton between two packs, and ignoring the growling tone that my voice had started to take, while beginning to take my own shirt off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Divide Fanton?&quot; Devon mused, &quot;I could... you could have yourrrrrr house and only yourrrrrrr house and none of my females.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then took his pants off and gave a very vicious looking smile, &quot;Orrrr I can... I CAN MAKE YOU OBEY ME AND MAKE YOU MISERRRRRRRRABLE!&quot;<br />
<br />
I could feel the same pain I felt as my first transformation started the night before hit me again as I got my own pants down. It hurt, but not as much as the night before, and did nothing for the erection between my legs. As I looked around, I could see all of the others beginning to transform as well. Most of Devon's pack of she-wolves shared the body type that Jenni had, and that Night and Terri had gained by becoming werewolves. Large and perky breasts that showed little inclination to sag at all, as well as wide hips with obvious signs of sexual arousal in their nipples and genitalia. Some of them were even beginning to grope each other as they changed. However, a couple of them, some of those that were from my office looked much the same as they did before they were likely bitten. They were likely like me and were either freshly bitten or had only been werewolves for a month or two. They were showing the same sings of pain that I was.<br />
<br />
&quot;TERRRRRRRI IS MINE!&quot; I growled at him, feeling the power of the change beginning to take over my body and seeing two of Devon's transforming girls pull both Terri and Night toward him, &quot;AND I WILL DEFEND NIGHT AS WELL!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU WERRRRRRRRE NEVERRRRRRRRRR ATTRRRRRRRRRACTED TO NIGHT BEFORRRRRRRRE AND YOU DIVORRRRRRRRCED TERRRRRRRRRRI,&quot; Devon answered as he pulled them from the other two girls and held them to his chest, I could see his claws beginning to push out of his finger tips, &quot;AND THEY LIKE ME, DON'T YOU MY GIRRRRRRRRRRLS?&quot;<br />
<br />
Terri and Night, lost in the arousal of their own transformations, as their breasts began to grow larger and their fur began to grow, began to play with Devon's penis, which was a foot long and had twice the girth mine had in human form when erect, and it grew bigger with each breath Devon took. The sight of it angered me tremendously as well as gave me some jealousy as well. While I could feel my own penis swelling larger, I was still smaller than him. The part that angered me was the fact that he was using the heightened sexual arousal that every werewolf seemed to be in to his advantage.<br />
<br />
I gritted my teeth and gave a low angry growl at him for that, and felt my teeth altering and changing. My canine teeth were already beginning to lengthen into fangs. Devon didn't seem bothered by it as Jenni and another of his she wolves that had been a werewolf for a while came and began to fawn on him through his shoulders, which were beginning to be covered in fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;SEE, THEY LOVE ME, NOT YOU!&quot; Devon gave a triumphant growl.<br />
<br />
I only growled back as I felt great throbbing pain hit my feet as I felt the arch of my foot lengthen. I was beginning to rise up into a digitigrade stance, as were the others. But, while Devon looked half triumphant at having those that were followers and those that were too aroused to fight his attention, I noticed that not all of them seemed to be as happy with the situation as the others. Slightly behind Devon and to my right was another female werewolf. She only looked like she was eighteen or nineteen and was covered in sandy blond fur. Her already large breasts had swollen larger still, and her nipples looked more teat like than like a human nipple. Her second and third pairs of breasts were also rapidly growing to catch up with the primary pair. As I looked to her, I also caught her scent. It smelled like Devon and Jenni combined in a way. This had to be Devon's daughter.<br />
<br />
But that wasn't the major issue. The issue that attracted my attention was that while she was transforming, as we all were, and that she was enjoying the transformation, as one paw playing with her top right breast and the other massaging the outside of her vagina, there was some worry on her face as well. It was like she wasn't entirely supportive of her father's harem. As I felt my muscles begin to rapidly enlarge underneath my skin and fur, I decided to play to that. Devon had created a harem of she-wolves for him to have sex with, but I doubted all of them had been without boyfriends when they had been bitten. I might be able to win them over if I tried to play to their needs.<br />
<br />
&quot;ONLY BECAUSE YOU'VE RRRRRRRROBBED THEM OF THEIRRRRRRRR LOVES!&quot; I growled at him, as the pain and pressure began to move toward my head and spine. I could feel my ears stretching and changing into triangular points and moving toward the top of my head, &quot;THEY &quot;LOVE&quot; YOU BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CHOICE! IF THEY COULD HAVE THEIRRRRRRRRRR OWN BOYFRRRRRRRRRIENDS, I BET THEY WOULDN'T &quot;LOVE&quot; YOU AS MUCH!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT IS PACK BUSINESS! A FRRRRRRRRRRRESHIE LIKE YOU HAS NO RIGHT!&quot; Devon growled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;IT'S WHAT IS RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIGHT!&quot; I challenged, noticing favorable responses from Devon's daughter and a couple of the other she-wolves that were present that were arranged around me to keep me from running off, &quot;AND IF THEY'RRRRRRRRRRRE TOO SCARRRRRRRRRRRRRED OF YOU TO FIGHT... I WILL FIGHT FORRRRRRRR THEIRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIGHTS!&quot;<br />
<br />
What followed was a great amount of pain and very audible cracking as I felt the bones in my face snap and change. They rapidly began to push forward, forming a large canine muzzle. I was very nearly free, and I could feel it. Devon and the others were close too, but the responses I noticed in at least a few of Devon's she-wolves gave me some confidence. I especially figured that things would go well if Devon's daughter sided against him.<br />
<br />
&quot;SO NOBLE,&quot; Devon growled back in a tone that indicated that he didn't care, &quot;FIGHTING FORRRRRRRR THEM, TAKING THEM FRRRRRRRRRROM ME! HA!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO, FORRRRRRRR THEIRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRIGHT TO CHOOSE THEIRRRRRRRRRRRRR OWN MATES!&quot; I retorted, &quot;NOT BEING TIED TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RRRRRRRE THE ONLY MALE HERRRRRRRRE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Devon moved forward toward me, and leaving Terri, Night, Jenni, and the fourth female that had been fawning on him behind him. Both he and I were beginning to breathe deeply as and the pain and pressure began to move to my spine. My tail would soon grow, and I would have attained my wolf form, though, if I didn't get help, I knew I was fucked. While the gap between Devon and I had narrowed as we transformed, he was still bigger and looked stronger than I did.<br />
<br />
&quot;THEN LET US COME FRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREE, AND WE'LL SETTLE THINGS HERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRE AND NOW,&quot; Devon snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES, LET'S,&quot; I snarled back as I began to feel my tail grow.<br />
<br />
And then it happened for all of us there, my tail grew out behind me, as did the tails on the other werewolves. Our full wolven forms were now visible for anyone with eyes to see. I felt a great release in transforming and despite my willingness to fight Devon, to give the other she-wolves their rights and to give Francine Jones some justice, I joined him and the others in howling to announce the completion of my transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAWWWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; rose the howling chorus from all of us.</p>
