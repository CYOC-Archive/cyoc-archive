<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Half an hour after Zoey had called “Jess”, the “girl” and Juan arrive home, “mom! We’re here,” she calls.<br />
<br />
“I’m in the kitchen,” Zoey calls back, she then turns when the two enter the kitchen holding hands, this doesn’t go unnoticed by Zoey, ‘not good,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I’ll need to have a chat with Juan’. The “woman” smiles, “so, you must be Juan,” she says, “it is a pleasure to meet you”.<br />
<br />
Juan smiles, “it is a pleasure to meet you too, miss Davis,” he says.<br />
<br />
Zoey smiles, turning to “Jess”, “why don’t you and Juan head into your room,” she suggests, “food will be finished in an hour”.<br />
<br />
“Jess” nods, “sounds good mom,” she says, “come, Juan”.<br />
<br />
Zoey watches the two children leave the kitchen, as soon as they have vanished, her smile fades, ‘this is NOT good at all,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I shouldn’t have messed with Jeff’s mind, he’ll be so mad at me, all I wanted to do is to fulfill his desire to experience what it’s like to being a girl. I really have to let Juan know, this might make him mad and hurt him, but, better he knows the truth than having a much ruder awakening’.<br />
<br />
An hour later all three are sitting around the dining table, “wow, this smells absolutely delicious, miss Davis,” Juan says, his mouth watering.<br />
<br />
Zoey chuckles, “I’m glad to hear that,” she says, the “woman” had cooked up a nice meal, nothing special, just a salad with a French dressing and some spaghetti in a cheese sauce, “tuck in you two”.<br />
<br />
“Jess” grabs her fork, “wait,” Juan suddenly says, both Zoey and “Jess” look at the boy questionably, “um… at home, we pray before eating. It… it’s important to me, so… um… w-would you mind?”<br />
<br />
Zoey and “Jess” look at each other, then at Juan and smile, “Jess” lying her fork down, “not at all,” she says.<br />
<br />
Juan smiles, reaching out his hands to Zoey and “Jess”, “take my hands, and I’ll lead us,” the boy says, after Zoey and “Jess” take his hands, all three bow their heads. The 12-year-old takes a deep breath, “O Lord, we thank you for the gifts of your bounty which we enjoy at this table. As you have provided for us in the past, so may you sustain us throughout our lives. While we enjoy your gifts, may we never forget the needy and those in want. Amen”.<br />
<br />
“Amen,” both Zoey and “Jess” say.<br />
<br />
After letting go of Juan’s hands, the two smile at the boy, “wow, that was one hell of a prayer, Juan,” the “girl” says.<br />
<br />
“I think we should take on this tradition,” Zoey says, what do you say… Jess?”<br />
<br />
“Jess” smiles and nods, “we sure should,” she says.<br />
<br />
Juan smiles, “that… that means a lot to me, thanks,” he says.<br />
<br />
“No problem,” the two say.<br />
<br />
“Now, eat before it gets cold,” Zoey says.<br />
<br />
The two children nod and tuck in, “this… this tastes amazing,” Juan says, looking over at Zoey, smiling, “you’re an amazing cook, miss Davis,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Aaaaw, thanks Juan, you are really sweet,” the “woman” says.<br />
<br />
Juan blushes a little, “my parents have raised me well,” he says.<br />
<br />
“They sure have,” Zoey says.<br />
<br />
When they finish eating “Jess” turns to Juan, “hey, do you still have some time to continue the video game we have started?”<br />
<br />
Juan looks at his watch, “yeah, I have at least an hour before I have to head home,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Jess” smiles, “cool, then let’s go,” she says, getting to her feet.<br />
<br />
Juan gets to his own feet, “um, Juan, do you mind if I talk with you for a minute,” Zoey then says in a serious tone.<br />
<br />
“Um… okay,” Juan says, he then turns to “Jess”, “I’ll be up in a minute”.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” the “girl” says, she then turns and heads up stairs.<br />
<br />
Juan sits back down at the table, “what is it you’d like to discuss, miss Davis,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Before I tell you… I want you to promise not to blame… Jess for anything and not to be mad at her,” Zoey begins, “because… I noticed the way you two look at each other… holding hands… there… there is something you need to know, about… me and Jess”.<br />
<br />
Juan looks a little confused at the woman, but he can tell that something really important is on her mind, “o-okay… I promise,” he says.<br />
<br />
Zoey sighs, she then takes a deep breath, “Jess and I… we… we aren’t who we seem to be,” she begins.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean, miss Davis,” the 12-year-old asks.<br />
<br />
Zoey hesitates, wringing her hands and seeming to become really nervous.<br />
<br />
“Miss Davis,” Juan asks, now starting to feel a little worried.<br />
<br />
Zoey looks at the boy, and Juan can see the look of fear in the woman’s eyes, sensing that, whatever she’s about to say, might make him mad. “I… I’m scared that… that you’ll get mad,” Zoey says, Juan can see tears forming in the woman’s eyes, “I… I don’t want to hurt your feelings… I… I don’t want you to hate… us”.<br />
<br />
“Miss Davis, you are starting to scare me,” the boy says, “please… tell me, what is going on? I promise… I promise to try and understand”.<br />
<br />
Zoey looks at the boy, she then lets out a sigh, takes a deep breath and starts explaining, “Jess… Jess is not really Jess… she… she isn’t even a girl… well she is currently, but that… that is not who she really is,” the woman’s voice shakes with worry and fear, becoming more and more nervous.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Zoey takes a shaky inhale, “Jess… she… she’s in reality my older brother Jeff,” the woman then continues, “and… and I am in reality his little sister Zoey, Jeff… Jeff is 16 and… and I am six”.<br />
<br />
Juan’s eyes widen, at first the boy thinks the woman is being crazy or insane, but seeing the fear and tears in the woman’s eyes causes the boy to hesitate.<br />
<br />
Zoey senses that she needs to explain more clearly, “Jeff… he got this weird program called “The Chronivac”. It… it’s a program that is able to change the appearance of anyone and anything, it also is able to change the reality and… minds”.<br />
<br />
“That… that sounds just… crazy,” Juan says.<br />
<br />
Zoey nods, “I… I didn’t believe it at first either,” she says, “but… Jeff showed me by changing his hair color from black to pink and back again. He… he then asked me if I’d like to try something with the app, and… well… I… I was curious and wanted to experience what it would be like being a mom, so… he… he made me older and added the mind of a grown woman to my child mind”.<br />
<br />
Juan stares in disbelief at the woman in front of him, “th-then what happened?”<br />
<br />
Zoey takes a deep breath, “I… having a 16-year-old son felt… not right,” she continues, “I… I wanted to see what it’s like being a mom from the beginning. S-so… so I used the program on Jeff, when… when I read his stats, I… I saw that one of his desires was that he wondered what it would be like being a girl… I… I decided to transform him into a baby girl and have him age up a year every three hours, without him knowing. I… I also decided to adjust his mind to his new age, I… I thought… I thought it wouldn’t do any harm, that… that Jeff would still be… well Jeff mentally… b-but…,” Zoey trails off, tears rolling down her face.<br />
<br />
“But it seems that his mind has developed into that of a girl,” Juan mumbles.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah… he… she… she doesn’t remember who she really is,” Zoey says, “I suspect, when we transform back in nine hours, that her… his mind will also return to normal”.<br />
<br />
Juan lets out a gasp, “oh… crap basket,” he mutters, leaning back in his chair, “I was wondering why she seemed to look… taller and… older earlier. I… I thought it was just me, that… that my mind was playing tricks on me,” he mumbles, “but now… it… it all makes sense”.<br />
<br />
“I… I’m so sorry, Juan,” Zoey says, “I… I didn’t know… I didn’t think a situation like this would happen. I… I really messed up… this… this is all my fault,” the woman breaks down, burying her face in her hands as she sobs.<br />
<br />
Juan doesn’t say a word for a while, “will she… I mean… will he remember… remember what he did as a girl… remember… me?”<br />
<br />
“I… I don’t know,” Zoey admits, “only one way to know: wait for her… him to be back to normal”.<br />
<br />
Juan strokes through his hair, noticeably frustrated.<br />
<br />
“Juan… please… I… I’m truly sorry,” Zoey sobs, “I… I didn’t think… all I wanted was to… was to experience what it’s like to be a mom. If… if you want to be mad at and blame somebody… I am the one you… you should hate… not Jess… I mean Jeff”.<br />
<br />
Juan doesn’t respond at first, he just stares at the sobbing woman, ‘this is absolutely crazy,’ the 12-year-old thinks to himself, ‘but… but what if it’s true? I… have to know!’<br />
<br />
“Ju-Juan,” Zoey asks carefully.<br />
<br />
Juan looks at the woman, he then takes out his phone, dialing a number then holding it to his ear, “hey, mom,” he says, “yeah… nah… I’m fine, would it be okay if I stay at… Jess’s place for eight more hours? It’s 2pm now, James can pick me up at 10pm,” the boy looks at Zoey who’s eyes are wide, a look of confusion mixed in with fear in her eyes, “thanks mom… yeah… see you later,” with that he hangs up and puts his phone away.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what… what was that about,” Zoey asks.<br />
<br />
“I want to stay and witness you and… Jess transform back,” Juan says, “I… I just have to know”.<br />
<br />
“B-but… but wouldn’t that… make you mad? Especially when… when Jeff might not… you know… remember you and what he… did”.<br />
<br />
“Then that is something I will have to live with,” Juan says, “it… it will hurt for sure… but… but I promise to not hold a grudge against Jeff… nor you”.<br />
<br />
“Y-you… you sure,” the woman asks.<br />
<br />
Juan gets to his feet, he then walks around the table and lies a hand on Zoey’s arm, looking into the “woman’s” eyes, his face serious, “I am sure, Zoey,” he says, “I’ll… I’ll be fine, please… I just got to know”.<br />
<br />
Zoey thinks for a while, she then sighs and nods her head, “I… I guess I owe that to you,” she says.<br />
<br />
Juan smiles, “thanks,” he says, letting go of Zoey’s arm.<br />
<br />
Zoey wipes her tears away, managing a small smile, she then looks at the clock on the wall of the dining room, “well… according to the time, “Jess” should be 13 years old now,” she then turns to Juan, “what… what do you want to do? In her state… she… she might…,” fear once again appears in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Juan however gets it, “do not worry, Zoey,” he says, “THAT will not happen, I promise”.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” the “woman” says.<br />
<br />
“JUAAAAAAN,” they then hear Jess call from upstairs, “I’M WAITING!!”<br />
<br />
Zoey and Juan look at each other, “thanks for being honest with me, and telling me all this, Zoey,” the boy says, smiling.<br />
<br />
Zoey smiles and nods, “and thank you, Juan, for understanding and not being mad,” she says, “y-you really are an amazing boy”.<br />
<br />
Juan smiles, “I’ll see you later when it’s… time,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’ll meet both of you in “her” room,” Zoey says, Juan gives a nod and hurries up the stairs, soon Zoey hears a door close, “well… that went better than expected,” she mumbles, getting to her feet and starting to clean away the dishes and tidying the kitchen.</p>
