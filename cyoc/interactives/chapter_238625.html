<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chloe&#39;s life was peaceful until her parents separated. But when her mother left her father and Chloe lived alone with him, she was unhappy at first. But then her father surprised her by telling her that he had met someone new. When Chloe met her stepmother for the first time, she was pleasantly surprised and thought that everything would be better from now on. When the two moved in together, Chloe found out that her new mother had also brought two girls with her. Their names were Sm and Alex and they were both a few years older than Chloe. At first it seemed as if the three of them were getting on well. But that gradually changed and eventually her stepsisters only saw Chloe as their slave and their toy to play with. Whenever one of them was supposed to do something, they couldn&#39;t, so Chloe had to do the work. They also annoyed Chloe when they were bored or needed to let off steam.<br />
<br />
One Saturday afternoon it happened again. Alex and Sam called out to her and when Chloe asked what was wrong, Sam threw a remote control at her head. &quot;The remote control for our TV is broken,&quot; Sam told her. &quot;Go and get it repaired at the shop a few streets away.&quot; &quot;And if I don&#39;t do it?&quot; she asked. &quot;Then we&#39;ll tell mother that you used our TV without our permission and the remote control broke,&quot; Alex said to her. Chloe shuddered slightly. The two of them had threatened her a few times and each time they had made good on their threat. So she got dressed, took the remote control and set off.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes she arrived at the shop. From the outside it looked like a junk shop for electronic devices. Chloe went in and immediately saw the owner. He looked like an old professor and inventor. She had been here several times and the two knew each other. He asked her kindly about today&#39;s reason and she told him. However, he realized that this was not the whole truth and asked her to sit down. After he gave her something to drink and something to nibble on, he asked why she always appeared here looking a little depressed. Chloe thought it was finally time to confide in him, so she told him everything about her stepsisters. When he heard this, he asked her to give him the remote control and told her that it would take a while. After a while, he came back and gave her the remote control. She looked a little different now. He explained to her that this was the ultimate remote control with which you can really change everything. She laughed at first because she thought it was a joke, but he quickly proved her wrong after he asked her about her favorite animal. When she answered hamster, he pressed a button and shortly afterwards Chloe was a mix of girl and hamster. Then he immediately transformed her back and gave her the remote control and instructions. On the way back, Chloe read the instructions and thought about what she should do with her sisters. When she arrived, she went straight to her sisters&#39; room. &quot;Finally,&quot; Sam said to her, &quot;that took a long time. Now give us the remote control.&quot; &quot;I won&#39;t do that,&quot; Chloe said bravely, facing them. &quot;Go get it if you want.&quot; Alex didn&#39;t wait long and slowly walked towards Chloe. She pointed the remote control at her stepsisters and pressed a button. There was a bright flash of light and when Chloe saw something again, she noticed that the room had changed. It now looked more like her room. Then she looked at the floor and at the place where Alex had been. There was now a stuffed animal that looked like a hamster on two legs and whose face was similar to Alex&#39;s. Then she turned to her bed and saw a small shirt there. It was the perfect size for her new stuffed animal, and on the front was an anime girl version of Sam&#39;s head. She had turned her sisters into her new stuffed animal, complete with all the equipment that goes with it. Reality had also changed so that Chloe was now an only child. She grabbed her new toy and put the shirt on it. Then she held it at eye level. &quot;I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re wondering what happened. Now your remote can change everything and I used it to turn you into this.&quot; She held her stuffed animal in front of a mirror. &quot;I hope you like the new you. But don&#39;t worry. You won&#39;t stay like this forever. If I ever need something or I&#39;m bored, I&#39;ll turn you into something else. And don&#39;t get your hopes up. Everyone thinks I&#39;ve always been an only child. I think we&#39;re going to have a great time.</p>
