<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler watched the wheel turn and felt excitement bubble up within him when he saw the wheel slowing down as it approached one of the &quot;Normal&quot; panels which had the power to revert a body part. He&#39;d give anything to have even one of his bizarre changes undone, if only for a while. The audience gasped. Tyler let out a sickening groan when it inched past &quot;Normal&quot; and landed on &quot;Hydra necks.&quot;<br />
<br />
First he felt his neck grow much longer and become covered with scales. This new neck was as prehensile as his monkey tail but much longer and more muscular to hold up his enormous head, which he could now point in any direction he chose: up, down, forward, backwards, even upside down. It was kind of messing with his balance, too. Without his huge muscular &quot;front&quot; legs, he would have easily toppled over from stretching his monstrous neck and head too far out in front of him. He was just getting over the motion sickness when his chest widened, his elephant legs spread apart, and he felt six other necks grow in.<br />
<br />
At first, they felt like scaly tentacles, and he imagined he knew almost what it was like to be an octopus, feeling so much control over so many appendages all at once. Of course, Tyler new that hydras only have so many necks because they have so many heads. His heart thundered in agonizing anticipation.<br />
<br />
They all turned out to be identical. Six new crocodile snouts with triceratops beaks at the end, six new horse cock tongues waggling in and out, twelve new goat horns, eighteen new triceratops horns--plus more horns out the side of each new head. And on every face two sets of compound eyes swiveled and swayed between Venus fly trip eyelids. Even the Madame was almost nervous at this point. (Almost.) Her magic could create new heads, but it could not create new consciousnesses to inhabit them. Her only choice was to expand Tyler&#39;s mind yet again, and it was going to take a powerful magical expansion to cope with the complexity of a form like this. Otherwise he would finally go into shock and die right there on the stage. The Madame was quite capable though, and the show must go on!<br />
<br />
So every head was Tyler, and Tyler was in every head. He nearly fainted from the arousal of his numerous penises. The Madame&#39;s magic was strong, of course, and Tyler did not faint. The tingle of the electron field coursed through all of his hammerhead shark eyesockets. Nothing was overwhelming Tyler quite as much, though, as much as his vision. There was no longer any direction around himself that he could not see. Every head was pointed in its own direction, and every eye had a countless lenses on its surface. He saw, simultaneously, every wall of the tent, the floor, and the ceiling. He saw Madame, and the audience, from several points of view. He saw his back, his front, and his sides. One of his heads was tucked underneath his elephant legs, giving him a stunningly detailed sight of his abdomen, his goat legs, and the chimeric genitals that were still hanging from his crotch. Most of his heads could even see each other! And he could reposition them all at will, giving him a dynamic view of everything, especially his own hideous self. One of his eyelids caught a fly and slammed shut to digest it. It barely mattered. His new-found omniscience was excruciating, and he screeched from all seven throats, pounding the floor with his feet. Then the tent fell silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at me, Tyler.&quot; The Madame spoke calmly.<br />
<br />
It took work. Seeing her was easy, but looking... focusing his many attentions on one figure... that took coordination. One by one, he maneuvered his seven heads into position. One by one, he angled his thirteen open eyes just right. After what felt like hours of trial and error (but was really just seconds), he had the Madame centered in his sights. He paused for a moment, and just stared. It was exhausting, but it really did calm him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s enough,&quot; she said at last.<br />
<br />
In those few seconds of staring, Tyler realized that looking at just one thing--something he had taken for granted as a human--was now actually quite awkward. It felt limiting and almost vulnerable to leave so much of himself and his surroundings unobserved. He let his heads start to drift around again, exploring the panoramic world he now had access to. On an intellectual level, he still wished to be human again, but now, having seen from every angle the unprecedented creature he had become, humanity seemed like only a distant memory and a faint hope. He could no longer relate to being short, bipedal and tailless, watching the world from just one face. The humans he saw around him were almost as alien to him as he was to them.<br />
<br />
The audience gave a standing ovation. The board changed yet again.<br />
