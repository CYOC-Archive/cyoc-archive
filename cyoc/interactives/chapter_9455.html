<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The old store proprietor watched as Denise left his store and quietly chuckled to himself. Knowing that all he needed to do was wait before claiming her and her boyfriend as his own.<br />
It was a hot summer’s day that was going to become a sultry hot night for two. A dinner at an expensive restaurant, a nice long walk by the lake in the park and then a trip back to her place. <br />
Once back at her place, the living room couch offered them the perfect place to satisfy their mutual and sexual desires. As Cameron got ready for her, she lit the candle and wafted its scent about the room with a casual wave of her hand. She then walked over to her boyfriend and allowed herself to be lowered down next to him. <br />
The two then begin to probe and grope one another as their passions rose and their private inhibitions began to disappear. Cameron was the first to feel the effects of the rich, musky scented candle. The scent aroused him and brought about an erection down inside his pants, pushing his underwear and pants up into a little tent for all to see. <br />
Denise too had a feeling of raw almost animalistic passion go through her. It was an experience like she had never felt before in her entire life. As Cameron began to become aroused and feel erect, she inflamed his passion by stroking his tented pants and made him moan with increased desire. The two of them then practically began to pant in union as they continued to intimately explore every inch of their bodies. <br />
Minutes later, the two of them had unconsciously moved themselves from the couch and onto the floor of her living room. Because her place had been built at the end of the 19th century, the four storied flat offered its inhabitants no air conditioning whatsoever. And even with the windows open, they felt no respite from the dusty, hot atmosphere of the street outside. Thus by the time they started to pull off each other’s clothing, their clothing was streaked with their sweat and their bodies were slick with it. <br />
As Cameron leaned on his elbows with his butt held up high above hers, he wondered how he could so deeply penetrated into her body. But that thought quickly disappeared as her moans of satisfied sexual, sensual delight mixed with his and stole away his ability to reason. <br />
Passion met passion and the two lovers were so caught up in the moment that the candle’s subtle influence upon them went unnoticed. Had they been aware of what was happening to them, she would have seen that her lover’s appearance was more dog-like than what she remembered of him. And as for him, he would have noticed the extra sets of teats slowly emerging along the length of her chest as it grew longer and leaner. <br />
As she lay there, letting Cameron do as he willed, she didn’t notice the spreading of rich, fawn-colored hairs growing all of their bodies. Or of the beards, mustaches and long, bushy eyebrows that were starting to grace their faces. <br />
Cameron was so deeply connected to her that with each thrust of his pelvis, his legs stretched out behind him. Kissing her with his lips soon did little to satisfy him, so he began to nibble and muzzle her fur covered cheeks. Panting much more heavily than before, he growled with each thrust. She growled back at him and licked her blackened lips with her tongue before contentedly some more. <br />
Who’s to say which one of them at last noted the changes that were making each of them into a large, shaggy sheepdog. As an explosion of canine instincts and false memories began to rewrite their thoughts, desires and hopes into something more appropriate for their new four-legged existence. <br />
Had Denise not seen the changes to her mate’s body as something completely natural, she would have screamed at the sight of being mated to a sheepdog. But she didn’t as she too was well on her way to being his shaggy mate. <br />
Cameron growled and panted with pleasure. And due to the fact that he was more canine than human than she was, he had long ago already accepted his transformation into a faithful and obedient dog. Sniffing about his mate, he nuzzled her and wagged his tail with delight. Standing up on all fours, he struck a confidant pose as a large, shaggy Briard. <br />
Slowly she slid out from under the dog standing above her. Cameron’s half-erect canine cock slid out of her body, giving both dogs a fleeting touch of pleasure. Soon she sat back on her shaggy haunches, watching as her hands became shaggy forepaws. <br />
As her mate stood next to her, sniffing her and gently nuzzling her, she looked down at her body. The fawn-colored fur was now thick and really shaggy. Like her mate, her fur coat was really a rich shade of fawn except around their ears which was black. Her shoulders shrank into a dog’s withers as her arms drew in closer to her deepened and broadened chest. Then her arms became an extra set of legs. <br />
A flicker of intelligence made her remember her special candle. She turned toward the table it rested upon and saw that it had burnt itself down to a mere puddle of wax. But like the smoke that wafted away from the remains of her special candle, her human intellect faded away and was replaced by the instinctual nature of her breed. To the two sheepdogs, there wasn’t a thought about whether or not this change was permanent. Nor they did wonder about who they were before. All they knew that they were dogs and had always been dogs since the time of their puppyhoods. <br />
As she stood up and felt the last of her former life disappear, she ‘remembered’ that her name was Maggie, and that she was brought here to this place to mate with Max here. She also ‘remembered’ that her master would soon arrive to pick them both up and take them back to their home in the countryside.<br />
A knock on the door soon brought both Maggie and Max to full attention. The two Briards then quickly padded their way to the front door of this place. Wagging their tails and panting contentedly, they waited for their master to open the door and happily greet them.</p>
