<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I picked being worn to class as the least bad option. I did not exactly want to be wrapped around a guy's cock for the rest of school, but being left in a locker was about as attractive as a four hour detention in the dark while straitjacketed. And I wasn't about to risk someone worse in the Lost and Found lottery. Cy did not exactly want to wear me to class either, that made it feel a bit better. He was just as worried about I was about a guy 'overhearing' his private thoughts and though he was turned on by the idea of a guy around his junk I got the sense that he didn't want to make this any worse for me.<br>
<br>
Class with Cy would have been boring if I'd been sitting there listening to a repetition of last year's stuff instead of seeing through another guy's eyes. Instead it was like seeing the same old boring shit while trying to meditate at the same time, because we were both trying to keep some thoughts to ourselves and only slowly getting better at it. He might have had trouble taking notes if I had not already picked up some of this the previous year.<br>
<br>
We both learned a lot by lunchtime, though not much that the teachers were trying to pound into their students. For one thing when he wasn't thinking about the same sorts of things as any normal guy he thought about cars, mostly. If asked to guess I would have thought he spent his days checking all the jocks out, staring at our asses or something gross. But no, he thinks about working on his 1968 Oldsmobile Toronado, a car I'd never heard of until this involuntary sensitivity training shit. It was not fun, but it was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Still he's a homo and he did slip up once and think about a guy's cock in his ass once. Ugg! I retaliated with as clear an image of the last time I went down on Stacey as I could manage. That brought a quick end to that little episode. <br>
<br>
After lunch Cy was walking between classes without thinking about anything in particular and I was feeling weirdly 'close' to him. Like what I was seeing through his senses was less distant. We got to class and plunked down in a seat and then without even thinking about it I surreptitiously scratched an itch that had developed on my balls. The shock that Cy felt was immediately obvious. He'd felt me scratch his.. uh, my, well his junk through his pouch. He was 'in' my jockstrap body and I was in his human body. He mentally grabbed for his body and I was too stunned to resist so I was back as a jockstrap once again. <br>
<br>
After reassuring him I did not do it on purpose we agreed to experiment while ignoring the history teacher droning on. Cy relaxed and I reached out for his body again... and it worked! Cy was nervous, of course, about being a jockstrap. He only left me in the driver seat for a minute or two before he seized back control again. He was pretty strong mentally and I did not want to piss him off by fighting. But I did privately wonder if I could have his body against his will. It was a possibility to think about should I not get changed back like Vinnie said after the weekend. <br>
<br>
Nothing more might have happened if I had not hit upon the idea of offering Cy something so I could have his body for a while.<br>
<br>
<i>That's right. I do the workout and you get to watch. You know how buff I am.. was before all this. All I want is to 'get out' for the hour or two while working out.</i><br>
<br>
Cy agreed and that is how I ended up working out after school. After a little while he did not even mind it that much, The Fag.. Cy was far more comfortable than me being stretched over a guy's package. Everything went pretty much as I expected at first. It was not fun starting over with working out, but it was great just having a body. Though it was not as fun being hung like a horse as I might have imagined. It was harder to, you know, get adjusted so it was not getting in the way when walking and it was not like I'd get to use the playground either.<br>
<br>
The problem came when I was about to leave the weight room and I saw Kevin. He's one of my teammates, the wide receiver ironically, and when I saw him I looked as his ass for a second and felt horny. The foreignness of the thought caused me to fumble control of Cy's body and only he kept us from falling over. I did not let go of control completely though and Cy did not fight me. He thought it would be bad to not get out of there right away and so let me take his body to the locker room to get cleaned up.<br>
<br>
<i>Okay, you're done working out my body and I'd like it back,</i> Cyrus thought at me as I prepared to take a shower.<br>
<br>
<i>Yeah... I know. I just want as much time out as I can get. Could I shower too?</i> He projected a clear image of a naked guy soaping up into my mind and his body started getting a boner. Shit! I wanted to stick my borrowed tool into that firm ass even though everything about me rebelled at the thought as well.<br>
<br>
<i>I don't think you have enough self control to do that. If someone comes in you could get me beat up. I think it is my body that is gay so you're going to feel like that as long as you're in there. God, that actually feels pretty good.</i><br>
<br>
I don't think he intended to let me hear that last thought.  He was reacting to the sensation his cock stretching out the jockstrap he was inhabiting. There was a bright note of embarrassment a moment later when my own thoughts about that reflected back to him. I thought that he was much more suited to the role of jockstrap being so into getting cocks inside him. Then I had to apologize.<br>
<br>
Upon reflection he was right even though I desperately did not want to be just a jockstrap again. Though perhaps being back in my own 'body' these instincts or whatever they are would go away. I let my control of his body loosen and found myself back where I'd spent much of the day. After I was taken off as Cy went to shower I reflected that there were worse things than being gay and being a piece of clothing was one of them.<br>
