<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing you notice are his eyes, colored amber with a slit of a pupil. You know you&#39;ve never seen eyes like that on a person before, and yet they look better than anything your memory can conjure up as &quot;normal.&quot; You quickly realize that this isn&#39;t Marisa, though. Not only because of the well-toned male physique visible through his tight black shirt, but also the fact he&#39;s standing over you, something you remember quite clearly that Marisa was unable to do. You move back quickly, looking around until you spot Marisa standing off to one side, glancing between you and the newcomer nervously. &quot;D-David,&quot; she says tentatively, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Arik. He&#39;s a... well, naga expert, obviously. Er... Arik, this is my apprentice David.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; the male naga says, drawing your attention off of Marisa again. You weren&#39;t sure why, but she didn&#39;t feel nearly as important as the man. You try to get a better look at him as he speaks. His hair is a charcoal gray, matching the patternless scales of his tail. As he&#39;s nearly half a size larger than you are, his tail stretches out into the store and ends past where you can see. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a naga move that fast while as cold as you are. I hope that isn&#39;t because you wanted to get away from me.&quot; He smirked, showing his fangs. They were longer than yours, for sure. Quite impressive, in fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No,&quot; you respond hastily, still trying to get a grip on your situation. &quot;I just... was expecting to see Marisa, and... not... someone so big... and snakey...&quot; You look away, embarrassed at your inability to speak properly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easily flustered, though,&quot; he said in disappointment, reaching a hand toward you and gently taking your chin with two fingers, tilting your head back to look at him. You think about pushing him away, but decide it wouldn&#39;t be your best idea. You&#39;re starting to understand how Marisa felt around you last night, staring up at those beautifully cold eyes which looked right through you. &quot;I guess that&#39;s to be expected when you were toothless just yesterday, and a human at that. Still, I was hoping for better. I thought even human magic-users had standards.&quot; You could see Marisa mouth something vulgar at this, and you likely would&#39;ve smiled at it were you not in your current situation. &quot;You haven&#39;t even bothered to do anything with your clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down in confusion, you realize with a blush what he&#39;s talking about. Despite feeling smaller compared to the male, your shirt is stretched tight, torn in several places. Without even asking, he tugs on one of these tears, ripping it the rest of the way so that the shirt slides right off. Your face goes completely red, and you wrap your arms around your chest as fast as you can. That alone is a strange sensation. Your breasts aren&#39;t the most pronounced (you could&#39;ve sworn they were larger when you had first become a girl though), but they&#39;re plenty sensitive. &quot;H-Hey!&quot; you shout at him, forcing yourself to speak in more than a fearful squeak. &quot;You can&#39;t just rip my clothes off like that! Haven&#39;t nagas ever heard of decency?&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighs in annoyance, clearly having his patience tried. &quot;Unlike humans, we believe in clothing that actually serves a purpose, which yours clearly wasn&#39;t. If it really bothers you that much...&quot; He reached into a satchel he had at his side, pulling out a black bundle of cloth and holding it out to you. &quot;Here, this is the sort of thing we wear when necessary. It should help warm you up, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
You hesitate a moment, trying to figure out the best way to take it while limiting how much you expose yourself. Not getting any the more patient with you, the man takes your wrist and pulls your arm away from your body, forcefully placing the clothing into your hand. You thank him hastily before turning away and examining the clothes. In reality, it&#39;s only one piece of clothing, a shirt that looks smaller than the one that just got ripped off. It does seem slightly elastic, though, and you don&#39;t have any other options available to you. To your surprise, it slides on easily, though the sensation is strange. It isn&#39;t just the feeling of fabric sliding over your chest that makes it odd, but the whole shirt feels somewhat damp. You do your best to ignore it, though, especially since the shirt does seem to be fitting quite well. In fact, despite how small it looked, it comfortably goes all the way down to your scales, though it does expose your shoulders, but that&#39;s hardly your first concern. Even better, the long-sleeve shirt makes you feel amazingly warm, pushing away the last bit of your grogginess.<br />
<br />
You turn back around to face Arik, smiling. &quot;Wow, this shirt re-&quot; You barely have time to see him drawing close before his lips are pressed against yours. You try to pull away, but you&#39;re pressed against the desk you curled around last night, which is now creaking at the additional pressure. Beginning to panic, you do everything to can to push the male naga off, but he&#39;s considerably stronger and knows how to use his body better. Getting desperate, you reflexively bite his lip as hard as you can, feeling your fangs sink in and the odd sensation of venom flowing through them.<br />
<br />
This seems to do it, as he pulls back at once. You wipe your mouth thoroughly, stomach fluttering in what you&#39;re sure must be some naga equivalent of nausea. You glare up at him, expecting to see him suffering from your venom. Instead, you see him smirking, licking his lips. &quot;Excellent. For a minute there, I thought you were going to make me work for a taste of your venom. Not that I would&#39;ve minded: you&#39;re plenty attractive, but we don&#39;t exactly have the time right now, and I doubt Marisa here would appreciate us destroying her stuff.&quot; Mouth hanging open, you glance at Marisa, who&#39;s looking down uncomfortably. She looks a lot more pathetic than she did when you first met her. &quot;It would seem I&#39;m pretty lucky,&quot; the male continues. &quot;Your venom&#39;s quite potent. If you weren&#39;t so unfocused, I might not have been able to resist its effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
As much as you want hit him for what he did to you, this intrigues you too much. &quot;What effects?&quot; you ask skeptically. &quot;And if it was so dangerous, wouldn&#39;t it have been better to use some non-intimate way to extract it?&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrugs. &quot;Perhaps, but none of the other ways would be terribly pleasant for you. Biting into strange objects that actively suck out venom. Trust me, you&#39;re much better off. Besides, I figured you wouldn&#39;t be too strong for me to resist. I was right, too, even if I underestimated the natural strength of your venom. It definitely took some effort to resist changing.&quot; Seeing your confused face, he sighs, his impatience showing once again. &quot;Like with humans, some naga are able to perform magic. Our magic doesn&#39;t involve fancy words and symbolic objects, though. Venomous naga are the &quot;witches&quot; and what-not of our species. An experienced naga can bite down on someone and, with focus, direct their venom to perform a certain magical effect. Since you inherited your magic from Marisa, it seems you also inherited her affinity for transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a lot for you to take in. Your venom is magic? And it can transform people? You can&#39;t help but think about trying it on Marisa, but you&#39;d rather turn back to normal. &quot;Wait, if... if Marisa&#39;s specialty is transformation... why couldn&#39;t she have just changed me back last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because human magic doesn&#39;t work on naga.&quot; He grinned proudly, glancing back at the witch. &quot;Or most of it doesn&#39;t, but Marisa&#39;s never been much good at making potions.&quot; She glares at him, but doesn&#39;t make a sound to object. &quot;Like any good naga, though, I could easily mix something together if you wanted to return to being Marisa&#39;s apprentice.&quot; You begin to nod, more for the chance at returning to humanity than being an apprentice, but he interrupts. &quot;However, before you make your decision, I want to inform you of the alternative. You see, venom as powerful as yours could help me greatly in my work. I would need more than you could give to me now, so I&#39;d like to invite you to come back to Germany with me as my apprentice instead. As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already noticed, naga are superior in many ways. It might take some time getting used to, but I assure you it will be worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Marisa shouted, finally getting the courage to approach. &quot;That wasn&#39;t the deal, Arik! She signed up to be my apprentice; you can&#39;t just come and take her away because she&#39;s more gifted than you realized.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not taking anyone,&quot; he responded calmly before turning back to you. &quot;I&#39;m simply offering David here a better choice for her future. It&#39;s ultimately up to her. What do you think, David?&quot;</p>
