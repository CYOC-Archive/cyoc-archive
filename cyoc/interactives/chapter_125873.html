-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Isaac kept striking the demonic ghoul, but its hide was very resistant to his sword. Whatever was making it this thick, Isaac only hoped he would find a weak spot in the ghoul. Unfortunately, in the futile effort of doing so, his sword had broke when the demon took Isaac’s sword by the blade without injuries and breathed ice onto it, making it brittle. Isaac only looked around for anything else, but he found himself cornered by the icy demon.<br />
<br />
<br />
The icy demon took hold of Isaac’s arms and froze them together with his legs. He then cast a spell by reciting a chant in an ancient language as Isaac felt the ice on his arms climb down to his armor, making it brittle like his sword. His armor shattered into pieces when the demon kicked it, leaving Isaac in the nude. He was also cold as the ice still remained on his arms and legs, forcing him to kneel.<br />
<br />
<br />
This was very advantageous for the ice demon because he prodded his member on Isaac’s mouth. Isaac refused to open at first, but the demon forced it open with his hands as he deeply thrust into Isaac’s mouth. Isaac gagged at this, unable to spit it out as the demon was using him for its own pleasure. He didn’t like it one bit as the demonic cock was cold; it was like an icicle was in his mouth. The demon only thrust, using its prey as a means to get off.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Mmf!” Isaac gagged as he felt his member rise. His body felt corruption seeping back, though the ring kept his mind clean. He only looked at his assailant to plead mercy, but the demon wasn’t having any of that as he finally came inside Isaac’s mouth, the cold, corrupted cream filling Isaac’s stomach. The demon must’ve been so pent-up to fill Isaac this much… the fullness it brought worried Isaac greatly. While his mind was kept pure, his body wasn’t safe from the magic that would change it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The demon slumped away, leaving Isaac to himself. He was naked and a little lustful, but he was able to break free after trying to break the ice by slamming his back on the stone walls. He still felt full from the demonic encounter… and his belly felt very cold.<br />
<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Something is wrong. He knows he is reliving a memory. Isaac recognizes this moment. This was when he was fighting the ghoul before it got away. But if he can remember everything that will happen, then why his he having visions of his past now? What&#39;s done is done. This was only one moment of his life. It&#39;s not like the outcome will be any different. Right?<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Isaac stood up slowly trying not to slip on the patches of ice surrounding him, but the cold sensation in his stomach began to worsen. Isaac looked down to see his stomach was growing scales, light blue scales and his back was being covered by white scales. Isaac was shocked, but made sure not to make a sound as to not disturb the demon as his hands and feet became claws. Isaac was wondering why the ring wasn&#39;t protecting him from the corruption, but then he realized he wasn&#39;t feeling any pain. The ring must only resist the corruption, and help the wearer to resist certain aspects of the corruption such as pain from transforming, or mind alteration.<br />
<br />
As Isaac thought all of this he didn&#39;t notice that he grew a tail, and white hair sprouted, and grew to the tip of his tail. Isaac also failed to notice his body lengthening slightly, and his face reshaping to become draconic, as well as the fact that he resembled a serpent. Isaac finally took notice when he fell onto all fours, and he looked down seeing two scaled orbs on his chest with white nipples. Isaac looked at them in shock, and squeezed one out of temptation moaning slightly. Isaac then covered his mouth as his voice sounded feminine, and afterward he looked down and saw his manhood shrink away into his, now her body. Isaac&#39;s entire body was now a female eastern dragoness, and now she knew she had to be extra cautious due to her changes. Isaac inspected her body once again seeing her breasts have enlarged to compensate for her size, which is like a snake like horse, and her breasts were at least EE cups. <br />
<br />
Isaac wasn&#39;t that filled with pleasure, but the thought of being fucked by that demon turns her on. Isaac looks at the sleeping demon, and his cock just lying there on the floor. Isaac then shakes her head thinking,&quot;Damn these beast hormones!&quot; and she looked down to see that she was pleasuring herself by squeezing her breasts. Isaac then looked down to see her clit dripping with fluid, and was disgusted, and slightly worried.<br />
<br />
Isaac then began moving slowly trying not to trip, or make a noise at all moving towards a wooden door on the opposite end of the room. Isaac finally got to the door, and realized she lacked thumbs so she had to use her mouth to open it. Isaac grabbed the handle with her mouth and the door made an extremely loud creaking noise, surprising Isaac, and...<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Isaac couldn&#39;t stop himself. He was living the vision. He could feel himself get changed. Unfamiliar female hormone began flooding his systems.  Beastly female hormone to be more precise. He can&#39;t stop the primal need of getting mated and impregnated from his thoughts. But why is he experiencing these feelings? He doesn&#39;t remember being transformed into a dragonesss. And why is the ghoul he is fighting look slightly different from the one he remembers? What happened to the ring of purity? It was supposed to stay with him, not disappear!  None of this was supposed to happen! He was supposed to gain the traits of a ice demon! Not a dragon! What is going on?! This is not how he remembered that moment!<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Isaac turned to see the demon awake and stand up, it&#39;s body wasn&#39;t much larger than Isaac&#39;s now that she was a dragoness. However the cold would prove very ineffective against this foe, and even if Isaac knew how to breath fire, it would most likely only create ice from her mouth. &quot;S...stay back!&quot; Isaac growled trying to look intimidating, but something about this demon seemed attractive to her, and her groin felt warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m....sorry, you must be terrified or in heat because of me.&quot; The demon spoke and Isaac was shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh...what?! You talk! Explain yourself or...I....I.....&quot; Isaac began but the heat intensified and Isaac frantically began trying to hide it by crossing her legs, but blushed embarrassed at herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am c...corrupted by the c...cold, and most here are the same, but it varies on area. The natural urges are relentless between the corrupted, and judging by your expression, that is true for you.&quot; The demon said<br />
<br />
&quot;N...no, I...It&#39;s just....just....so hot. I feel....too hot.&quot; Isaac said breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is but one way to extinguish this feeling. I apologize in advance, but there is no other possibility.&quot; The demon said and suddenly disappeared then reappeared behind Isaac. The demon then mounted and forced its member into Isaac and thrusted like it did before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop....It! I....I don&#39;t want this....I....I...&quot; Isaac said trying to get a hold of her feelings, but couldn&#39;t withstand her lusts as the demon got deeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we are, much more loose. Don&#39;t worry, my seed does not impregnate, only transforms, and you already have been changed so it won&#39;t matter.&quot; The demon said and then Isaac roared as loud as she could climaxing and then the demon pulled out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What....the fuck....why?&quot; Isaac asked as her sex dripped again from her juices and the stench of sex filled her nostrils.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because neither of us have a choice. Now, I used to be human like you were, but the ice down here took effect on me and I became like this. Ever since there have been those that I changed like you, males became female, females became male, all became draconic. If you wish to live your life as normally as something like you possibly could, there is a male dragon that dwells one floor below this one, and four doors down. He was not cursed by me, but he is willing to tend to your situation as long as you are willing to commit yourself to him emotionally.&quot; The demon said<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I am a paladin, not a dragoness! I want to be free of this curse now!&quot; Isaac roared<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that simple, if it was then neither of us would be here having this conversation in our drastically changed forms. I know that I&#39;m just a ghoul, but death for me is barely an option until I can redeem myself. So please, go to the dragon, and go live your new life.&quot; The demon said and sighed.<br />
<br />
Isaac looked at the demon and it&#39;s expression was serious, honest, and in it&#39;s eyes Isaac could see sorrow and loneliness. Isaac then sighed and said,&quot;I will go, but if what you are saying is false, I will know where to send the next warrior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I expect nothing less.&quot; The demon said ten layed down on the ice. Isaac then exited the room and closed the door behind her. This time Isaac had a new goal in mind, and her new instincts didn&#39;t help any as well. So Isaac saw some stairs going in a downward spiral and she followed them down, and entered a hallway with several doors. What did Isaac do now?<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Despite that never happening, Isaac couldn&#39;t help but be interested in what happened so far. So corrupted creatures can talk to certain other corrupted creatures? It looks like some transformed humans has kept their humanity under a monstrous guise. So why did the other Isaac decided help the next person to venture the crypt instead of  ending the corruption himself? Just because he is female and a dragonesss now doesn&#39;t mean he is any less capable of venturing the crypt. He still considers himself male and so long as there is a way to regain his manhood, then he will find it! Maybe it has something to do with his ring of purity disappearing? It probably taken another form. But then of again, maybe the ring really did run out of power. He hope that doesn&#39;t happen to his Halo of purity. But under the assumption that his ring of purity really is gone them maybe perhaps the corruption programed his mind to stay away from the source of corruption? That would explain why none of the creatures living in the crypt never bothered destroying the source of corruption themselves. Or then again, maybe corrupt creature are not able to destroy the source of corruption? Or maybe other Isaac  is just really depressed and doesn&#39;t think she could stop the corruption as she is now. Either way, he hopes he never falls to the corruption and lose sight of his goal. That vision may never happened, but it reaffirmed Isaac of his goal: To rid his world of corruption and save his loved ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Foolish paladin! Every moment you live, there is a choice. Any choice will decide who you are now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The vision disappears. No hallway, no more crypt, nothing. The vision faded away into darkness. Isaac was suddenly in his normal elemental body, complete with his black armor and Halo of Purity. <br />
<br />
Isaac was floating in a pitch black void. He looked around to find the source of the unknown voice.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he laid eyes on another Isaac. He looks exactly like Isaac. Except his eyes are glowing purple. His face was contorted into a sick, lust filled grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you!?&quot; Isaac demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you can figure that much out.&quot; The other Isaac responded. He chuckled to himself as if this was all a game.<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s see, he has glowing purple eyes so he can only come to one conclusion. &quot;You&#39;re Azaviel.&quot; Isaac stated in disgust.<br />
<br />
Azaviel Isaac waved his finger disapprovingly. &quot;Ah ah ah. Nope. Azaviel is still living a internal paradox in your cock. Think harder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac want to say that the other Isaac was lying. But come to think about it, if this thing is not Azaviel then why can he still feel Azaviel&#39;s power emanating from the other Isaac? If he is not Azaviel then there is only one other thing he could be.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the part of Azaviel that became a part of me.&quot; Isaac concluded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bingo.&quot; Dark Isaac confirmed. &quot;Like it or not, I&#39;m a part of your soul now. So I guess we are roommates in you&#39;re little halo now. I represent all the lust and corruption you have. For some reason, the Halo of Purity decided to separate me from you. I am your lust whenever you release your corrupt cock. In other words, I&#39;m your split personality. I was born when you took in Azaviel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac can already tell that dark Isaac is not exactly like Azaviel. He want to control his body just as much as Azaviel does. But he seems... a lot more patient and a lot less... wild. He seems more cunning and in control. He also seems to have just as much resolve as Isaac. It&#39;s as if Dark Isaac knows everything about Isaac and all his weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Which he probably does. <br />
<br />
What should I call you?&quot; Isaac asked cuastiosly.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac simply let out a laugh. &quot;I am you and you are I. I can read your thoughts and if you really want too, you can read mine as well...&quot; Isaac has no inclination to read his thoughts. &quot;Ha ha ha. I think Dark Isaac is a little basic for a name but fitting none the less. I AM a combination of you and Azaviel!&quot;<br />
<br />
With the introductions out of the way, Isaac went strait to the point. &quot;Why did you show me those visions of me becoming a Ice dragoness?!&quot; Isaac can&#39;t see any tactical value in showing him such a thing. If Dark Isaac planed on discouraging him, then he simply doesn&#39;t know Isaac enough.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac simply chuckled in pity. &quot;Those visions were not of my doing.&quot; Dark Isaac turned around for dramatic effect. &quot;But they were interesting. To think that something as simple as fighting a slightly different ghoul then the one you fought would bear drastically different results. And that&#39;s not the only thing that could change. Before Isaac could react, another vision engulfed him.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Hiking up the mountain wasn&#39;t the easiest thing in the world thought Issac. For one, despite Issac&#39;s almost complete resistance to both heat and cold, the high altitude of the mountain range chilled Issac to his very Corrupted cold and even Marry, a native of this plane barely managed to last only slightly longer than Issac did. Only through use of his magma breath did the three manage to have atleast some warmth as they climbed higher and higher, watching the plant life diminish as they progressed further up.<br />
<br />
Hiking up the mountain wasn&#39;t the easiest thing in the world thought Issac.

Only through use of his magma breath did the three manage to have atleast some warmth as they climbed higher and higher, watching the plant life diminished. as they progressed.<br />
<br />
The entire travel there took about three days, and had left the entire party exhausted. Regardless they continued, Issac didn&#39;t want to spend another second letting the tyrannical Cloud King to get away with his corrupt deeds, however right now they had to focus on the objective.<br />
<br />
By the time it was around noon, the three found themselves taking a break at a small plateau on the cloud mountain.<br />
<br />
Ilvir was sitting at the edge the plateau looking in awe at the view of the shining sun pouring it&#39;s light over the white landscape. Issac briefly wondered if the sun was also made of cloud as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite the view isn&#39;t it? Have anything like this on your world?&quot; Marry asked, wearing a set of warm hiking gear rather than her armor which was placed beside her as she sat on a cloud rock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, though I have to admit I haven&#39;t seen quite a view like this before we got here.&quot; Issac answered, unaware that he was partly looking at Ilvir&#39;s granite ass sitting on the side of the plateau, his large stone balls visible from behind.<br />
<br />
Marry smiled softly but her face turned serious when Issac turned to her and asked about their progress.<br />
<br />
Pulling out a topographical map of the region from her backpack, she layed it on the lumpy and began pointing at the plateau they were currently resting on, then trailing he returned fingers up a mountain path that led higher into another plateau about five hundred feet above them, explaining as she went. <br />
<br />
&quot;Even with your slow speed we have actually made a surprising amount of progress, usually at this point we would&#39;ve been attacked by a pack of feral animals or atleast a blizzard climbing up here, so it seems like Lord Fate and Lady Luck have blessed us here for now.&quot; She said, circling her finger around the higher plateau above them. &quot;Higher up the mountain packs of pegasi are often found, with this area here being a well known grazing spot for any herd. Most herds tend to have their own leader, the largest one usually have the strongest amount of innate air magic. If we can get you to absorb one of those, I imagine we&#39;ll have no problems until we get to the Sky King&#39;s castle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, how long until we get there?&quot; Issac asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only a few more hours on foot if everything goes well.&quot; Marry answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall we head off then?&quot; Issac said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Isaac can&#39;t help but feel sadness. It&#39;s pretty obvious  that vision was showing a world were Isaac skipped Nat&#39;s town and went straight for the mountains. If he wasn&#39;t so reckless, then Ivir would still have a body and wouldn&#39;t be sleeping inside of Isaac. He would still be able to save Ilivir from Azaviel...<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac was enjoying this. &quot;You see! No mater how small your actions may be, they can decide who lives and who you&#39;re gonna be. Will Ilivir have his freedom? Will you submit to the crypt? Or will you accept being a woman? Let&#39;s Try one more, shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Isaac could stop it, he was engulfed by another vision.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Isaac began to panic now. His cock and balls had mutated into some strange leaking vine with balls that looked like alien fruit. The smell given off by his new package was attractive to insects which swarmed him earlier. Isaac continued to move toward the crypt even still, knowing he could think of a solution once he was safe and had set up a base camp. <br />
<br />
As Isaac saw the stairs leading to the entrance of the crypt off in the distance, his feet suddenly began to cramp. Isaac stumbled and could hardly walk with his feet cramping - they felt like they were trying to spread out and escape his greaves. Isaac ripped off his greaves and let his feet free only to see his feet dig into the ground like roots. Isaac&#39;s toes were spreading into the ground, rooting him in place like some sort of tree. Isaac tried to pull his feet from the ground to no avail, he had transformed into some sort of sick tree now, ingrained into the ground with a living vine as a cock with hanging fruit for balls. Isaac knew he was in serious trouble now. The temple was so close but it was almost dusk - he would need to do something quick before nightfall.<br />
<br />
Off in the distance Isaac heard a rustle before a hagged looking old lady walked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;My my look at you.&quot; The witch mused. &quot;What a beautiful specimen you turned into. Very nice vine and low-hanging fruit hehehe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want with me, witch?&quot; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I only want that amazing growth you have there. I know you don&#39;t appreciate it as much as I do.&quot; She responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean? Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m corrupted? Im turning into a cursed tree now!&quot; Isaac said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are, but if I remove that source of corruption...&quot; she said, cradling the vine in her hands &quot;...then you will return to normal and will be fine&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you do that?&quot; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simple, I will remove the vine and fruit with my magic, which will cause your feet to return to normal.&quot; She responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my old cock?&quot; Isaac dejectedly asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Your old cock is no more. It is what you see before you now. I can&#39;t reverse its changes, but I can remove it to stop it from changing you. Don&#39;t worry though, I will leave you with a vagina to compensate.&quot; She said<br />
<br />
&quot;A vagina!? I am no woman!&quot; Isaac fearfully yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no other choice my boy. You can either stay where you are and turn into a tree, or you can let me save you by removing your corrupted dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Isaac completely forgot about that encounter. He never even got the witch&#39;s name. But why is the vision showing him this event? It&#39;s not like he would willingly give up his manhood...<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Choosing the lesser of the two evils, Isaac gives up and lets the witch remove his cock to save his life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but make it quick.&quot; Isaac says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh boy I haven&#39;t done something like this in years!&quot; The witch cheers before getting to work on Isaac&#39;s crotch.<br />
<br />
She reaches down and holds the base of Isaac&#39;s shaft before weaving a strange spell on the base. After that, she begins slowly pulling the vine cock, causing Isaac to moan in pleasure. It feels like his dick is being pulled further and further away from Isaac&#39;s body before he feels a POP.<br />
<br />
Isaac looks down to see the witch cradling Isaac&#39;s vine-cock and fruity balls, leaving Isaac with a perfectly shaven pink pussy below.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know it would look so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So normal?&quot; The witch interrupted. &quot;Yes, you now have a perfectly functional female vagina!&quot; <br />
<br />
As the witch started to walk away, she turned to warn Isaac. &quot;If you are thinking of going into the crypts, I would be careful if I were you. The creatures down there will do far worse to you than out here. Not only that, but these sort of beasts much rather prefer their victims have a vagina than a penis. Heed my warning young man.&quot; The witch said before disappearing into the bushes.<br />
<br />
Isaac was stunned by her words. &quot;They would prefer their victims to be women..&quot; Isaac thought to himself as he stared at his new genitals. He was lucky enough to be alive and not corrupted any more. &quot;Noone will ever know I have a vagina between my legs anyways.&quot; Isaac thought before donning his armor and preparing a base camp outside the crypt entrance.<br />
<br />
As Isaac slept, he could hear ominous sounds coming from deep within the crypt. He knew there was a great evil down within and he would need to be prepared if he wished to survive.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Isaac can&#39;t believe it! But then again, that would probably be something he would do. He said so himself that even he does lose his manhood, he is still a man at heart and so as long he is capable, he will find a way to regain his manhood and purge his world of corruption. But the vision keeps going...<br />

<br />
Isaac was blessed with another quiet night - no disturbances or evil breaches his protective ward. Isaac eat and drank before ensuring his weapons were prepared for the crypts. Isaac&#39;s weapons of choice - a hammer - was enchanted with holy markings which would obliterate any evil that comes in contact with it. Isaac preferred a blunt weapon over a sword for it&#39;s effectiveness against both flesh and non-flesh.<br />
<br />
As Isaac entered the crypt, the darkness felt thicker than any night&#39;s darkness. Isaac&#39;s magic torchlight couldn&#39;t even pierce far into the darkness. Isaac felt the weigh of this darkness upon himself, knowing that a weaker being would actually be in peril trapped in such a darkness. As Isaac cautiously moved through the darkness, he came upon a strangely lit room - the torches in the room flickered with an eerily purple flame which made the room feel as ominous as the dark passageways.<br />
<br />
At the center of the room Isaac saw a naked figure of a man crouched over himself. The man looked human from a distance, maybe he was alive!<br />
<br />
Isaac slowly crept up before calling out to the man. No response. Isaac continued closer until he was almost 10 feet away from the man. Still no response.<br />
<br />
Isaac was unsure about how to proceed. But his hesitation was answered when the man lifted his head, showing Isaac the visage of a faceless being - an face devoid of all features.<br />
<br />
Isaac readied his weapon as the being stretched its arms toward Isaac. Isaac evaded the arms and slammed his hammer on the extended limbs, burning them apart from the rest of the body. <br />
<br />
The being shrieked and stood up before charging at Isaac. Isaac again evaded the attack and struck the center of the being&#39;s back with his hammer, sending the monster flying into the wall before it slumped over motionless.<br />
<br />
Isaac stood above the presumably dead demon. &quot;Dear gods, what a terrible monster!&quot; What was even more frightening was the humorously long 14 inch flaccid penis attached the to the monster. It was dripping black ichor onto the ground.<br />
<br />
Isaac remembered the old witch&#39;s words and realized these monsters did have some propensity for females as opposed to males. &quot;That must be why they never allow women to venture into this forest. These monsters are perverted freaks!&quot; Isaac thought, knowing he was now much more vulnerable to these demons than he thought he was.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Mostly unphased by that demon&#39;s graphic display toward Isaac, he continued deeper into the crypts. The darkness washed over him again when he left that lit room and continued through the passageways before finding himself in a pitch black room. Isaac thought he could hear whispers in the shadows. He heard voices whispering strange things. He couldn&#39;t tell if they were whispering about him or at him but it was a bit unnerving given Isaac wouldn&#39;t have much time to react to an attack.<br />
<br />
Irritated by this, Isaac decided to go on the offensive. He began channeling light into his hammer before throwing it high into the air as if it were a lightweight ball. The hammer stopped at the peak of its height before emitting a brilliant flash of light. The beams of light illuminated the room, burning away the darkness which made this room its home. The whispers stopped and the room remained lit as a result of the hammer&#39;s magic. Isaac could see the darkness slowing seeping back into the lit room, and stopped its progression by drawing a warding circle into the room, establishing Isaac&#39;s 3rd and final base camp he had prepared. With a reprieve from the madness of this dungeon, Isaac had time to relax and contemplate his next move.<br />
<br />
The tunnels he traversed were winding and confusing, but Isaac knew he was making his way deeper to the core of the crypt. Isaac was still surprised he managed to make it so deep with almost no real confrontation. Looking into the room&#39;s exits, Isaac had a strong feeling one of the exits would lead him to the central tomb - his final destination. Isaac knew that he had a momentous battle ahead of him. Isaac was determined to destroy this evil after what it did to him. He thought this as he cupped his new genitalia with his hand. It looked so fragile - so gentle on such a strong paladin like himself. Isaac knew the paladin&#39;s welcomed both genders, but his confusing case might stir up trouble when he returned. He would need to find a fix for this problem or simply hide it for the rest of his career.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
As Isaac slept peacefully, a stranger passed into the barrier, unaffected by the protective ward&#39;s magic. Isaac was alerted to the presence of another being inside his safe haven and immediately jumped awake and put on under armor before prepared for battle.<br />
<br />
Isaac lept from his tent, preparing to strike the adversary, only to stop when he saw a naked man - face and all - standing before him. Isaac was still nervous about this strange man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Isaac forcefully yelled. &quot;Answer truthfully if you wish to live!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Nathan. I&#39;m a sorceror from the magic institute. My team and I were sent into these depths to study the magic within the crypt, but we were ambushed by these beasts. All my friends either perished or joined the ranks of the demons within here. I promise you I am still human - I am not corrupted!&quot; Nathan replied.<br />
<br />
Isaac couldn&#39;t sense any sort of evil emanating from Nathan, so he laid down his weapon and returned to put some clothing over this strange man before sitting down with this man to interrogate him.<br />
<br />
The two talked about their respective missions, both exchanging their knowledge and experience thus far. Isaac withheld his loss of genitals from Nathan out of embarrassment - seeing a man with a penis was strange now for Isaac, especially someone so well endowed having a flaccid 7 inch penis like Nathan.<br />
<br />
After their conversation, Nathan agreed to join Isaac in his mission. Having a skilled spellcaster would do Isaac a lot of good. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
As the two roused for their final day of action, Nathan motioned to Isaac in his armor,<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh before we rest, let me inscribe this charm onto your armor. It gives the user more vigor, more strength. I learned it before I left for this mission&quot; Nathan said as he imbued Isaac&#39;s armor with a magic light.<br />
<br />
The light seeped deep into Isaac&#39;s body, giving him a flush of warmth that was strangely centered around his pussy. He suddenly blushed as he was finding Nathan more and more attractive, making Isaac aroused! <br />
<br />
&quot;How does this magic work?&quot; Isaac asked, holding back the pleasure he was feeling and the arousal caused by Nathan&#39;s presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh simple, it amplifies the effect of the user&#39;s sexual organs. For men their testosterone is enhanced and women have their estrogen enhanced, basically improving their role as their gender.&quot; Nathan replied<br />
<br />
Isaac was a bit nervous. The spell was making him think like a women and have the same impulses - even Isaac&#39;s nipples were feeling hard and aroused by the charm.<br />
<br />
Still, Isaac could not let Nathan know about his predicament, they had far more important matters to attend to.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Isaac couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Isaac shouted. The vision shattered and Isaac was once again floating in the black void with Dark Isaac.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong Isaac? I&#39;d thought you&#39;ll be happy to see you friend again.&quot; Dark Isaac was gaining in victory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why!? THAT&#39;S IMPOSSIBLE!!! From what I heard, Nathan was in the cloud plane for at least 6 months. How could he still be in the crypt? And why didn&#39;t I recognize him!?&quot; Isaac was tired of these what-if scenarios. <br />
<br />
Why didn&#39;t he recognize Nathan! He remembers vividly the day when Nathan went on a mission for the Magic Institute to take a team to investigate the crypt. Isaac has the sinking feeling the Magic Institute sent him and his followers on a suicide mission because they were tired of hearing his theories about the crypt. Isaac blamed the Magic Institute for Nathan&#39;s disappearance. Either way, Isaac was tired of these visions. That entire vision didn&#39;t make sense.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac simply let out a tired sigh, &quot;Once again, that vision showed a alternate world. My best guess it that Nathan went on his mission around the same time you started your quest. It also seems you two never met in that world. Who knows, maybe that vision really is possible in your world. Maybe time flows differently in the cloud plane. Maybe he was about to escape the crypt but ended up going through a portal right before you got there. And maybe you didn&#39;t recognize him at first because it has been a while. Who knows.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac was gritting his teeth in anger. &quot;WHY ARE YOU SHOWING ME THIS!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac rolled his eyes in annoyance. &quot;Didn&#39;t you hear me? I said those visions were not of my doing. They are YOU&quot;RE doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac&#39;s anger changed into confusion. &quot;My doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac gave Isaac a all knowing look. &quot;Now you are catching on. Think  about what you were doing before you went to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m asleep?&quot; Isaac muttered to himself. Then again, it makes perfect sense if this were all a dream. But what did Dark Isaac meant by what he was doing before he slept? Well, the last thing he remembers was that he was looking into the oracle hand mirror...<br />
<br />
!<br />
<br />
In that instant... Everything made sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;You get it now? Right before you went to sleep, you were staring into the oracle mirror. It seems that mirror has the power to show you what would happen if a different choice was made. The mirror must be showing you what-if visions in your sleep.&quot; Dark Isaac said triumphantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;If that is true... then how do you fit into all of this?&quot; Isaac asked. Though deep down he already knew the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already told you. I&#39;m the part of Azaviel you took into yourself. I have nothing to do with the visions you are seeing. My best guess is that you are still staring at the mirror in your sleep and its showing you what your heart wants see. What would happen if you gave in to the corruption? What would happen if you avoided Nat&#39;s town? What would happen if you found Nathan. The mirror didn&#39;t show you exactly what you wanted, or rather it showed you what was possible. I&#39;m just along for the ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac narrowed his eyes. &quot;So if you&#39;re not here because of the visions, then what are you here for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac gave a wicked smile. &quot;I&#39;m here to finish what Azaviel started. I&#39;m here to take over your body.&quot; He said simply. <br />
<br />
Isaac immediately went on his guard.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac simply chuckled to himself. &quot;Unfortunately for you,  I have the chance to take over your body whether if you are asleep or awake.&quot; Dark Isaac taped the Halo above his head. &quot;I&#39;m also in the Halo of Purity. I am a part of your soul after all. In other words, I&#39;m your shadow. That means the Halo of Purity won&#39;t interfer when I try to take you over. And like I said, I have 24/7 to fight you for control. I just decided that now would be a good time to introduce myself to you, my roommate.&quot;<br />
<br />
And as if a light switch was flipped, the black void around the two Isaac&#39;s changed into the Basilisk Shrine. The place Isaac encountered Azaviel.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac readied a sword made of Purple crystal. &quot;Remember this? I think this memory makes a great battle field! Don&#39;t you think!&quot;<br />
<br />
The battle worked just like Isaac&#39;s fight with Azaviel when he possessed Ilivir. Both fighters are using paladin fighting techniques. The only real difference from the Demon Ilivir fight is that Dark Isaac is matching Isaac blow for blow. Or rather, he is mirroring Isaac&#39;s every move. What is Dark Isaac&#39;s game? And why is he grinning like a mad man?<br />
<br />
Before Dark Isaac could carry out his plan, someone charged into the fight and separated the two Isaacs.<br />
<br />
Standing in between the two Isaacs was Ilivir in his human form, and he looks pissed. Isaac is just relieved that Ilivir doesn&#39;t have blue veins anymore. That means he no longer is his spawn and he has his freedom back.<br />
<br />
But before Isaac could call out to Ilivir, he began charging at Dark Isaac.<br />
<br />
Iliver was surprisingly giving Dark Isaac a good fight. He&#39;s using outdated paladin sword techniques that were surprisingly effective against Dark Isaac. Oliver was actually showing a lot more skill and strength then when he was possessed by Azaviel. <br />
<br />
Isaac stood in awe struck as Ilivir dodged and weaved like a master paladin. Iliver may be cowardly as a human, but he was a surprisingly good fighter! Dark Isaac was no longer smiling. He was actually sweating as he was getting pushed back by Ilivir. During the whole fight, Ilivir was shouting things like &quot;How DARE you make me your child!&quot;, and &quot;Give back my body!&quot; and &quot;I want my freedom back so I can experience the sex on my OWN terms!!!&quot;. Isaac was puzzled by that last comment.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Ilivir was able to place a fatal blow across Dark Isaac&#39;s chest. Dark Isaac was staggering in pain as purple blood sprayed across the ground. <br />
<br />
Dark Isaac was panting hard. But before a enraged Ilivir could place the finishing blow, Dark Isaac disappeared.<br />
<br />
Before Isaac and Ilivir could react, Dark Isaac&#39;s voice could be heard all over the Basilisk Shrine. &quot;Well... It seems Ilivir&#39;s spirit was stronger then I thought. I didn&#39;t expact him to wake up so soon. Much less make it into the Halo of Purity to save you. Oh well. I guess we will have to share space for him in the Halo. I&#39;m going to lick my wounds. I&#39;ll be back to fight you for control later. Remember this though. I can still take you over when you are awake, and any soul in the Halo can comunicate with each other. So I gues you&#39;ll be hearing us in your head when you are awake. I look forward to that so I can torchering you. Imagine all the nasty things I could say to your friends.... Sweet dreams fair paladin.&quot; And with that, Dark Isaac&#39;s voice faded away. <br />
<br />
But Ilivir wasn&#39;t done. As soon he laid eyes on Isaac, he began charging him. Isaac tried his best to evaded his as Ilivir demanded to be set free.<br />
<br />
Isaac tried his best to calm Ilivir down as he dodged his attacks. &quot;Wait! I&#39;m sorry for making you my spawn! It was the only way to save your life!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oliver responded with, &quot;I remember EVERYTHING! How dare you use me like that! How dare you take away my freedom and humanity! For my god, my king and whats left of my dignity I will kill you monster!&quot; He screamed as he took aim.<br />
<br />
Isaac just barley dodged a fatal blow. &quot;It&#39;s not that simple! Your body was destroyed by the granite elemental!&quot; Iliver&#39;s sword early swiped Isaac&#39;s cheek. &quot;Tell you what! I&#39;ll let you share my body until I can find a body for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Iliver immediately stopped his attacks. &quot;You will?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! We can switch control over my body depending on the situation!&quot; Isaac reaffirmed. <br />
<br />
Iliver thought it over for a moment before answering. &quot;That will do for now. But remember this. I was one of the High Paladins back then! I could fight back demons without any armor or weapons as long as I have my holy spells! If you don&#39;t find a human body for me, I will kill you.&quot; Iliver&#39;s spirit spat at Isaac before fading away. <br />
<br />
Eventually, the memory of the Basilisk shrine faded into the familiar black void.<br />
<br />
Isaac was once again alone, left to his own thoughts. As he processed what happened so far, he come to realize that he will be dealing with voices in head for now on. That is something he will have to endure. At least Ilivir is safe and back to his human self. That&#39;s all Isaac could ask for.<br />
<br />
Once Isaac was in peace, he opened his eyes.</p>
