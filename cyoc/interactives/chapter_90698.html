<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake had always admired his dad and had wanted to grow up to be like him.  Knowing this Jake was curious about what would happen to him if he made some changes to his dad&#39;s look that were more based in style and preference than genetics.  Would he grow up trying to emulate his dad?<br />
<br />
He decided first to change his dad&#39;s activity level.  He would not change his dad&#39;s actual build but just how much he enjoyed exercising.  After some searching he found a menu in the chronivac for activity preferences.  Under this menu there was a large list of activities and next to each activity on the list you could slide a bar to indicate the level of interest.  The level of interest ranged from uninterested to obsessive.  For his dad, Jake selected weight lifting and set the interest level to high.<br />
<br />
He then thought about a changing a style preference as well.  After another long search through the endless menus of the Chronivac Jake found what he was looking for.  He found a menue regarding personal style.  You could change clothing preferences, hairstyles, even color preferences.  Jake decided to start with something simple.  Since they were both very hairy men he thought he might take advantage of this and have his dad grow some facial hair.  After some thought he selected a mustache and decided to make it a walrus mustache - one where the hairs were so long that they obscured both the upper and lower lip.  After making this selection and getting ready to finalize his choices Jake wondered - because I idolize my dad will I grow up to be interested in weight lifting and decide to grow some facial hair as well?<br />
<br />
As he hit enter, his dad immediately began feeling the effects of Jake&#39;s selection.  First his clothes began to feel very tight but only in certain places.  HIs sleeves began constricting his expanding biceps and his shoulders and chest began stretching out the top of his shirt.  His shirt and pants became looser around the waist but his pants tightened around his rapidly growing thighs.  Within minutes Jake&#39;s dad had changed from a slightly pudgy, middle-aged man to a man with the build of an avid weightlifter.  His clothes altered to have a more athletic cut and show off the years of work Joe put in at the gym.  He still was very hirsute with fur traveling all the way up his massive arms and thick tufts of salt and pepper hair emerging from his shirt collar but now he was much more fit.  Joe&#39;s hirsuteness increased even further as he felt a tingle on his upper lip.  Soon a bushy stache flecked with gray consumed both of his lips.  Joe then tugged at his tight shirt sleeves and rubbed his mustache like he had looked like this for years.<br />
<br />
As soon as his dad had finished his transformation, Jake began to feel its effects.  Similarly fat melted off of Jake&#39;s body and his muscles increased in bulk.  He even remembered spending time with his dad at the gym as a teen and even helping his dad shave his body for an amateur bodybuilding competition (which was a half day ordeal).  His size did not reach even half of his dad&#39;s but he was clearly very fit and still very hairy.  He had obviously not taken to weight lifting like his dad but he definitely new his way around a gym.  For  few moments no additional changes occurred and Jake thought that he must have not inherited his dad&#39;s taste for facial hair.  Just as Jake thought he was done changing he felt his whole face itch.  Within minutes a thick full beard had sprouted where he had once had heavy five o&#39;clock shadow.  The beard blended into his forest of chest fur and there was no clear demarcation to where his beard ended and his pelt began.  Clearly even though he wasn&#39;t an amateur bodybuilder like his dad he had to show him up in the face fur department.  He stroked his beard and it felt all too familiar.  Like he had had it for years.  Like before he looked back at his old family photos and noted the changes.  In all of the photos his dad had a full stache sometimes alone, sometimes accompanied by a full beard.  Jake, on the other hand, had grown up experimenting with facial hair styles as teens tend to do,  Even at age 14 he had a thick goatee given his family&#39;s hirsute genes.  In high school he had a shorter full beard and a fully hairy chest and in college a handlebar mustache and hair that extended up his arms and grew up his back just like his dad.  Only in the more recent photos did he have the thick face fur that he currently sported.<br />
<br />
As he thought, changing his dad&#39;s style and activity preferences had a definite impact on his life.  He then started scrolling through more of the Chronivac menus and wondered what other intergenerational experiments he could try,</p>
