<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jamie and Kylie talked as they drove to school.  &quot;Well that was pretty easy with your parents,&quot; Jamie said.  &quot;Now we can expect a piece of cake with mine.&quot;  Kylie asked, &quot;How do you think your parents would have reacted if we didn't do that dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie answered, &quot;Probably not too well.  They wouldn't have disowned me, but they would've been upset.  You can bet they wouldn't let us be alone in the house together either.  That won't matter now.&quot;  Kylie leaned back in the seat and daydreamed.  &quot;That's a relief,&quot; she said.  &quot;So now that we know how our parents are, what about the girls?&quot;  Jamie let out a slight laugh.  She was more concerned with making sure that their parents wouldn't object.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; Jamie thought.  &quot;I really don't know.  I mean, they're going to be fine with it.  The curse guarantees that.  How exactly they'll react is a different story.  I wouldn't be sure.  I have a feeling Jenn will be the hardest to accept it.  Judging by what happened yesterday, Trish will think it's kinky.  Liz is hard to tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie had no idea what her lover meant by what happened yesterday.  &quot;Jame,&quot; she decided that would be a good pet name as long as Jamie approved, &quot;what happened yesterday?&quot;  First Jamie asked, &quot;Jame?  Is that a pet name?&quot;  Kylie said, &quot;It's only a start.&quot;  Jamie told her, &quot;I like it.&quot;  Kylie smiled.  &quot;Anyway,&quot; she continued, &quot;For whatever reason Trish dared Jenn to make love to her.  I think Trish was interested in having control over her for once.  They've been best of friends for years, but Jenn usually dominates their friendship.&quot;<br />
<br />
The memories of yesterday triggered a bad thought in Jamie's mind.  She had had sex with Liz.  Though she wouldn't call it having sex.  She gave Liz an orgasm by using her fingers, but Liz never did much of anything to her except suck her breasts a little.  Still, she thought, she would have to let Kylie know about this before Liz said something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie, there's something I have to tell you.  Liz and I got caught up in the moment yesterday when they were having sex.  We ended up having sex, too.&quot;  A slight look of shock washed over Kylie's face.  Jamie noticed this and tried to reassure her.  &quot;Kylie, it wasn't love or anything like that.  It's just that we were both sitting there naked, watching our two best friends enjoying themselves sexually, I guess we just figured we should see what all their pleasure was about.&quot;  Kylie's expression softened.  &quot;To be honest, I did everything to her.  She didn't do anything to me.  And don't worry, I didn't use my tongue on her.  You're the only one who has gotten that satisfaction.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kylie seemed satisfied with her honesty.  She wanted this to be an honest relationship, as it had been so far.  Honesty was all she could ask for from Jamie.  She said, &quot;Thank you for being so honest with me.  Better I hear it from you than Liz.&quot;  She reached over and gave Jamie a kiss on the cheek.  The less obstacles, the better Kylie figured.  Jamie reasoned the same thing.<br />
<br />
They got to school.  Jamie parked in her assigned parking space.  The girls got their things and went in search of the other three.  Jamie wanted another test of the curse.  &quot;Kylie,&quot; she said, &quot;Hold my hand.&quot;  Kylie was about to ask why until she realized what Jamie was trying to do.  She took Jamie's hand in hers and the two lovers walked hand in hand in search of their friends.  As they walked they noticed one or two sideways glances but nobody made any comments.  Those that did glance at them did not looked shocked or appalled, either.  They simply looked, as if they were seeing any other couple holding hands.<br />
<br />
Winding their way through the maze of cars in the parking lot, they headed towards the usual morning gathering place of Jennifer's clique.  Facing the front entrance of the school there was a statue of Franklin Roosevelt.  In the statue he was seated in his wheelchair.  He had visited this area of the country early in World War II, going across the country raising morale for the war.  Some years after he died, the people of the town erected this statue at the school as a symbol of leadership.  It was under this statue that Jennifer and her friends gathered every morning.<br />
<br />
Jamie led Kylie to the spot, as Kylie would not have found it on her own.  Jennifer, Trish, and Liz were already there.  Trish spotted Jamie and Kylie first.  She waved them over with a look of urgency on her face.  That look quickly evaporated, though, when she saw how Jamie and Kylie were walking.  Her mouth dropped wide open as she let out a slight gasp.  Liz and Jennifer looked at her and saw her reaction.  They both turned their heads and saw the sight at which Trish was still gaping.<br />
<br />
Jamie and Kylie, hands still clasped together, walked up to the other three.  &quot;What's up, girls?&quot; Jamie asked cheerfully, as if nothing was out of the ordinary.  Jennifer looked too shocked to speak.  So did Trish.  Liz was able to find words first.  &quot;Uh, what's going on with you two?&quot; she asked.  &quot;What, this?&quot; Jamie asked, as she held up her and Kylie's hands high in the air.  &quot;Uh, yea.  That,&quot; said Liz, pointing at their hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I tell them?&quot; Jamie turned to Kylie and asked.  The tone of her voice was one of teasing.  In a way, she was.  She had always taken strife from her three friends for her relative lack of love life.  Now she was taking pleasure in the fact that she had started one and they were shocked by what they saw.  Kylie grinned back at Jamie, giving Jamie all the answer she needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie and I are lovers,&quot; Jamie said with complete confidence.  &quot;Last night at her house, we both discovered that we're lesbians.  And we found that we were both highly attracted to each other.  So we spent most of the night fucking each other.&quot;  Even Kylie was a little surprised that Jamie was that up front about the previous night.  But she also knew that the three of them wouldn't have any problems with it after some initial shock subsided.<br />
<br />
Kylie continued to think to herself as Jamie kept talking.  &quot;Let's see if I can't anticipate some of your questions.  Yes, we are lesbians.  Yes, we are seeing each other.  We don't know if we're in love, that will take time to reveal.  Kylie's parents are absolutely fine with it; in fact, they don't mind me coming over so we can have sex.  We don't know how my parents will react, as we're telling them after school.  And, no, we don't care what everyone else thinks.  This is about us, not what others think of us.  The only people whose opinions we really care about are you three.&quot;  After listening to Jamie's speech, Kylie decided she wouldn't say that they dared everyone to think their relationship was normal.  If Jamie wasn't going to say it, neither would she.  Unknown to Kylie at the time, but Jamie thought the same way.<br />
<br />
Now Trish was able to muster up some words.  &quot;Well, it doesn't bother me,&quot; she said.  &quot;I suppose that if it makes you two happy, I'd rather see that.  What do my opinions matter anyway?  Everyone thinks I'm a slut.  I don't care about them, so, yea, why should you care about what others think of this?  Good for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Liz offered her opinion.  &quot;Jamie, I was starting to think you might be after yesterday.  The way you came on to me, I mean.  Did you tell Kylie about that?&quot;  Jamie nodded.  Liz figured that meant there were no problems with it.  She continued, &quot;I thought you would find the right person eventually.  I just didn't imagine it would be another girl.  But Trish is right, your happiness is most important.&quot;<br />
<br />
During this time Jennifer's mind had been boiling.  Her mind was not sure of what to think.  She knew what she would normally think.  She would accuse Jamie of trying to upstage her or of trying to turn the cheering team into a group of lesbos.  She could not actually produce these thoughts now, though.  The dares of Jamie preventing her from being jealous of Jamie, and of Jamie and Kylie's dare making it so that she'd be OK with their relationship took over her mind.  She finally said, &quot;Great, if that's what you two want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Secretly, she had hoped to take Kylie for herself.  She had released Kylie from her control, yes, but she had begun to devise a plan to change that.  She would make Kylie her love slave by making her a she-male.  She was planning on transforming Kylie so that she would possess a cock like Kyle's, only one that had completed puberty and figured to be much longer and thicker.  Jennifer had been salivating over the idea.  Now it was no more than that, just an idea.<br />
<br />
Jennifer's mind now found something for which she could get mad at Jamie and Kylie.  She turned red faced and shouted, &quot;Well I suppose that between all your cunt licking you didn't come up with an idea on how to pay back that bitch!&quot;  She said it so loud that a few people turned their heads and looked at her as if she was insane.  She noticed this too, and screamed, &quot;Fuck off!&quot; to those who looked at her too long.<br />
<br />
Jamie coolly replied, &quot;Actually, Jenn, we did.  We think it's really simple.  Wanna hear it?&quot;  Jamie's talent for lying tricked even her closest friends.  Jennifer shouted, &quot;Oh just fucking spit it out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, then,&quot; replied Jamie.  &quot;Here's our idea: You want to humiliate Miranda, right?  Let's see what we know.  She told Kyle to call you yesterday.  But now she doesn't know that Kyle ever existed.  So she doesn't remember him calling you.  She has no idea the curse works.  If you go up to her and say it to her, she'll probably be so shocked, or just not believe it, that she won't say either.  That way, you give her both!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer began to calm down.  &quot;So how do I actually curse her then?&quot; she asked.  Jamie hadn't really thought it out this far.  Everything she had just told Jennifer was on the fly.  Now she did it again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give her the Dare first.  Dare her to be your slave.  But be tricky with the dare, like how we made it so you could walk naked in public.  Dare her to be your slave so that she would take any kind of orders from you, would make her cheering friends go along with your decisions, and lastly, so that everyone would know she is your slave and therefore make fun of her constantly.&quot;<br />
<br />
So far, Jennifer really liked the sound of what she was hearing.  Miranda would have to do what she wanted her to do, and everyone would know it.  She would be humiliated, and her reputation destroyed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I love the sound of that,&quot; she told Jamie.  &quot;So what for the transform, then?&quot;  Jamie decided to stop giving her ideas.  &quot;Oh come on, Jenn, you could do anything.  The only thing that I would say is that turning her into an animal or something like that would defeat the whole point of the dare.  So you'll have to choose carefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer wasn't very happy with being told what to do.  She especially didn't like having to think for herself.  This was the kind of thing that she relied on others to figure out for her, and then take all the credit for if it worked out alright.  However, she was a little wiser for her troubles of the previous day.  She had witnessed the power of the curse.  She saw that it could alter people's minds, their looks, their feelings.  She also saw how multiple effects could be squeezed into one transformation or one dare.  Armed with all of this knowledge, she had her plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right, Jamie.  I will have to choose carefully.&quot;  Then she smiled evilly.  Trish, Liz and Jamie recognized that as her trademark of hitting upon a great idea.  &quot;And I have chosen carefully,&quot; she added.  &quot;OK, what do you guys think of this?&quot;</p>
