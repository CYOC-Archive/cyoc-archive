<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colin always dreamed there was friendly dragons living in the world, and with his powers he could make this world reality, and the way he wanted it. Not only that, but if the book was really as powerful as he was thinking it to be, he could replace the current god (if he really existed) by one that would more actively discourage the kind of comportment his sister had been victim of in the old reality.<br />
<br />
So the teenage boy started to write &quot;Back when the universe was a big empty nothing, appeared a strange being that look exactly like a dragon would. The being itself don&#39;t know how it came to be, just that it was, and still is. That first dragon, or rather dragoness since she&#39;s a female, both mentally and physically, also knew she was a living but no less immortal and eternal goddess and could do absolutely anything out of that big nothing she lived in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the curious, she look like what the old world would have called an &#39;occidental&#39; dragon or a &#39;western&#39; dragon, but with white hair atop her head, between her horns. Most of her body is covered in scales displaying an ever changing rainbow of colors, the one on her underside shaped like the ones on the underside of a snake. Like we can expect of such a creature, she have enormous bat-like wings. What is surprising is that she also have no less than four eyes, two on the front of her head and one on each side, all of them with silver-colored cat-like iris.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since she felt lonely, her first action was to create more dragons using herself as a model, both males and females. Unlike her, those other dragons weren&#39;t gods and, while they were long lived, they still grew, aged and then died. They also were far less colorful than herself. But those still accepted to see her as a friend first, so it was enough for her to be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But not everything was perfect, and she soon discovered her friends didn&#39;t live long once they reached adulthood. It wasn&#39;t because of a lack of air or food, dragons live on the ambient magical energies. No, instead they somehow weren&#39;t able to clean themselves good enough and it caused sickness. Not that the goddess is any better at cleaning herself, but being what she is only made thing uncomfortable for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So to remedy this she created a second species who would feed on a dragon&#39;s grime: the kobolds. Some would say a kobold look like an anthropomorphic dragon, others that it look like a lizard variant of humanity. The fact is that most of a kobold body look like a human body, down to the size, with a dragon-like skin, although without any the scale on the torso, crotch include. They also have a dragon&#39;s head and tail, but no wings. They also are, like all drakonoïds, (dragons include) homoiothermic reptiles, meaning they are warm-blooded creatures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the first dragon was still a young goddess back then and made an error when creating kobolds. The poor things couldn&#39;t live without forming a mental bond with a dragon. Thankfully, a dragon touching a kobold egg in enough to form such bond, even if each dragon could only bond with one egg.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, as reptiles all drakonoïds lay eggs. But were a dragon egg is barely bigger than a chicken one, kobolds have eggs big enough to contain an human newborn, which make their females easily identifiable, thanks to their wide hips. (But they don&#39;t have any boobs, since they don&#39;t breastfeed their young.) And while the females of both species never lay more than one egg at a time, on some rare occasions kobolds have identical twins, (which mean two kobold born from the same egg) something that never happen to dragons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The next problem rapidly presented itself: Not having wings, kobolds had a hard time moving in the great nothing that was the universe, forcing them to cling to their draconic partner and ask it to go near another dragon so they could join their friends or spouse. So the goddess decided to temporarily put all those peoples and herself in a time-space bubble and caused the big-bang knowing it would, in the long run, create planets. She also knew that life would eventually develop on its own on some of those planets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t know if earth is the only planet to have developed life or if others did, dragons and kobolds stay mute on the subject. What we do know is that evolution gave some species a paththought similar enough to the one of dragons and kobolds they could learn to communicate with them. On earth, those are all apes, which include humans, and most cetaceans species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At first communications was hard, of course. Especially since drakonoïds &#39;speak&#39; telepathically, involuntarily turning into mush the brain of any other species they try to communicate with this way. (Only because, being telepathic, their communication is far more complex that simple speech.) Thankfully, kobolds can also speak orally when they are somewhere with an atmosphere. And while dragon can only roar and growl, their kobolds are more than happy to serve as interprets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then one day, by accident, it was discovered that any species thinking similarly enough to a drakonoïd could form a mental bond with them by touching their egg before it hatched. For example, a human could bond with a kobold. Of course said human then wouldn&#39;t be able to bond with either a dragon or another kobold, and neither could <em>his</em> kobold, which would probably mean he would die starving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Similarly, another human could bond with a dragon by touching its egg before it hatched. Said human then wouldn&#39;t be able to bond with another dragon but, because kobolds can&#39;t hatch, and would even die, without being bonded, this human and his dragon could bond with one of the smaller drakonoïds by both touching its egg. That said, they would have to both stay in contact with the egg for at least 1 minute instead of a simple touch like normally. Somehow, a drakonoïd can&#39;t bond with another drakonoïd from the same species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another thing to know is that, once linked to a drakonoïd, a similarly minded being can be contacted telepathically without their brain turning into purée. They can also communicate this way, but only with the drakonoïd they are connected to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, not wanting their kin to be bound to anybody, they made sure they had an island were no being would be able to bind itself to their unborn young. After all, while there is neither evil dragon or evil kobold there is, alas, some evil humans, even if they don&#39;t think themselves evil. If they had a friend they judged worthy, drakonoïds would let him bound with a dragon, as long as said friend was willing to, but it needed the approval of not only the goddess, but of most drakonoïds on top of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once psychically bound, a dragon somehow gain the ability to take on the appearance of a member of the species their bound to once old enough. (Basically once he is at least as tall as an adult member of said species.) A capacity they keep once the being they are bound to died. For example, most dragons can take on the shape of a kobold, even if it mean they have to become smaller. Said appearance would be of what the dragon would have looked like if they had been a kobold. The same logic apply to a dragon bound to an human, and so forth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It somehow caused some human/dragon couples to come into existing, and not necessarily between two who are bound together. The same apply to human/kobold couples, somehow. In both case, the babies will always be born as one of the two species, not as a hybrid of the two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Strangely, the only kobold/dragon couple is between the goddess and her husband, which is also the kobold bound to her. Their link made said kobold as immortal and eternal than her, but he still isn&#39;t a god.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For a long time, the goddess choose not to have any children. But the day that changed, some malicious human somehow convinced a lone dragon to steal her egg and bring it to them, hopping to bind themselves to her kid, thinking it might prevent the goddess from acting against them if not outright make him have enough leverage to make the first dragon ever to obey him. But somehow the egg fell before it could reach its destination, right in my hands, back when I was a little kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hadn&#39;t tried to catch it, I didn&#39;t even see it fall because of how small it was. But as soon as I touched it I knew it was a dragon egg, feeling a mental link form with the being inside. I was grateful it was far more sturdy than it looked, or its inhabitant would have died. I decided to bring it back home, were it would be secure until its parents came looking for it, grateful it was the summer holidays.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, the goddess wasn&#39;t happy some dragon accepted to steal her baby from her, nor that it ended bounding with a kid fearing I would be a bad influence on it, but what was done was done. She insisted on me staying near the egg, apparently it&#39;s important for a drakonoïd to have the being they&#39;re bound to near when they hatch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Normally, when a bound dragon hatch, who or what they&#39;re bound to choose their name, so their kind can say it. But I was a kid, so when the goddess asked how I decided to name her daughter after she hatched, I asked if she shouldn&#39;t be the one naming her, being her mother and all. It gave me a slightly better standing with the goddess, who was still extremely wary of the situation, especially since her daughter had somehow inherited her immortality which I now shared, (a closely guarded secret) and made her think a long time. It needed to be a name I could say after all. In the end, she selected the name Neptune.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unlike what the goddess expected I wasn&#39;t a bad influence on her daughter, who even is a positive one on me. We aren&#39;t a couple Nep&#39; and me and won&#39;t be for a long time. We would each date different people on our separate side eventually, but will never last long. We will some day end up together, but we don&#39;t realize we&#39;re made for each other yet even if the first step toward our future life as wife and husband had been taken recently, when after taking on her human form for the first time, she flew straight to my grand-parents home in Denver, Colorado were I was, just so she could show me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Being old enough to transform also meant she was old enough to need a kobold to help clean herself, and soon after I saw her as a human for the first time we were joined by her mother, who recently accepted it wasn&#39;t a bad thing for her daughter and me to end up linked, even if the circumstances were far from ideal. She had come with a kobold&#39;s egg, and gave it to us so we could bond with it. As we dit so, we could feel there wasn&#39;t one but two babies in it. Not only that, but they were Neptune&#39;s little sisters, which somehow made them the first kobolds with wings. (They&#39;re also immortals, but that could just as much come from Nep&#39; and me than from their mother.)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From our calculations, they should hatch for my anniversary, just like their big sister did, and it&#39;s exactly what will happen. Then their presence in our lives will slowly bring Nep&#39; and me closer until we decide to start dating, precisely a hundred years after they hatched.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin then recopied his long text so things were always that way, even for him. Once he was done both reality and his memories rewrote themselves. Then, once that was done his long text disappeared, letting only the one about the changes he had done to his sister be in the Journal of Facts. After all, things always were that way, so they didn&#39;t need to be written in the magical book to be so. Did they?</p>
