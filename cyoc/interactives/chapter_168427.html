<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I can&#39;t wait for her to maybe come back next month! I want my dick back now! There must be other options! Can&#39;t you just morph it back?!&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes, we could try morphing it back. It&#39;s expensive though and there&#39;s no guarantee for success.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have money! And I can make more money!&quot; Alec flashed his card. &quot;I&#39;m an adventurer.&quot;<br />
&quot;Very well. It&#39;s convenient that you&#39;re an adventurer, because we&#39;re going to need spell casting components. If you can collect some, we can cut a deal on the rate.&quot; The wizard stared at Alec with his deep brown eyes. <br />
Somehow, Alec felt that there was something sinister behind them. His vagina however disagreed as he felt it clench at the sight of those deep brown eyes. What was it doing to his boxers? He really wanted his dick back.<br />
&quot;Tell me what you need.&quot;<br />
The wizard grabbed the projection hovering over his table and swung the screen around, showing off several images.<br />
&quot;We need some Minotaur milk&quot; The image showed a large human with a cow&#39;s head. A large udder hang between her human legs while 4 large breasts covered her torso. Dangerous looking horns were on the sides of the cow&#39;s head. &quot;They live near the eastern canyon.&quot;<br />
&quot;Some dickweed from the western swamp,&quot; The image showed a brownish reed with a long narrow sausage like fruit on the end. &quot;Careful when you pick that though, don&#39;t pick the overripe ones without gloves. But it would be better to pick a younger one. And beware the immortal swamp witch that lives there.&quot;<br />
&quot;We need some ball herbs,&quot; A small green herb with round purple flowers was shown on the screen. &quot;You can find them in the outskirts to the east. These should be easy.&quot;<br />
&quot;and some honking frogs legs.&quot; A large brown warty frog with large orbs on the back was shown, it actually looked more like a toad to Alec. &quot;The legs need to be fresh, so it&#39;s best if you bring me a live frog. They live at the edges of the western swamp, since you&#39;re going there anyway it&#39;s probably most efficient to search for them there. But you can also find them on the riverbanks to the south. Their call is quite distinctive.&quot;<br />
&quot;Those are the rarest ingredients we need, everything else we have right here in ample supply. Give me your card and I will load the locations.&quot;<br />
Alec handed over the card and the wizard swiped it through his desk before handing it back.<br />
<br />
&quot;So those Minotaurs, are they friendly?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sometimes, but they don&#39;t like it when we ask for their milk. It makes them feel like livestock.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, thank you d..white wizard.&quot; Alec got up and remembered something. &quot;Err, Do you know if..umm I need..&quot;<br />
&quot;No I don&#39;t, I would bring some tampons just to be safe.&quot; The wizard looked up and straight in Alec&#39;s eyes. &quot;Unless you want a more thorough investigation.&quot; Alec immediately felt a heat build up in his nether region. It felt, empty and warm.<br />
&quot;No thanks.&quot; He hurried out of the room.<br />
<br />
Alec left the wizards guild. He still had that stupid vagina, but at least he had 2 leads for a solution. He had agreed to a questline and he needed to prepare for that. However should this attempt fail, then hopefully Amber would be back in town again and have cooled off enough to put him right. <br />
He looked at his adventurers card which came to life and presented a map of the area with multiple highlights. It really was wonderful technology.<br />
First things first, he needed better equipment. Fortunately, the map helpfully provided directions to the armory as well. Despite how late in the day it was, he decided that he was going to try it anyway and to his surprise, the armory was still open.<br />
He went in and was greeted by a heavy set man in a leather apron. His arms appeared as thick as tree stumps, while his face sported a heavy stubble. The store was lined with weapons of various sizes and types. Blunt weapons on the left, cutting on the right and piercing in the middle. His eye was immediately drawn to a huge broad sword. It&#39;s flawless hilt shone in the light and it&#39;s large cross shaped hand guard was at least as large as his lower arm.<br />
&quot;Overcompensation much?&quot; The shop keeper laughed friendly, but the remark hurt. &quot;There&#39;s no way you can carry that with those scrawny arms.&quot;<br />
He tore himself away from the giant blade and turned to the shopkeeper &quot;What do you suggest?&quot;<br />
&quot;Give me your adventurers card son, let me have a look.&quot;<br />
Alec handed it over while admiring a narrow slightly curved blade, with a narrow round hand guard.<br />
&quot;Hmmm, well with those stats and that budget I can advise you on some fine daggers and some minor leather armor to start with.&quot; He pulled a drawer out of his counter and put it before Alec. A large assortment of daggers of various shapes and sizes. The shortest were barely longer than his rusty throwing knife, the longest seemed more like short swords. <br />
Alec tried a few, none were magical like the dagger Amber had. &quot;I currently don&#39;t have magical weapons.&quot; The shopkeeper explained. <br />
He ultimately settled on a short sword. Slightly tapered at the end and with a single cutting edge, it reminded him of a short katana, which made him feel like a badass. It was attached to a complementary belt he received with the purchase. <br />
He also exchanged his rusty throwing knife for a new one and added an extra for a total of 2 knives. Now all he needed to do is learn how to use those things.<br />
<br />
They then went for some armor. The shop keeper helped him put on a leather undershirt, some leather arm guards and offered some leather protection for his legs, but Alec declined. The leather was heavy enough as it was and he still needed the money to get his dick back.<br />
&quot;No leg protection? When I was young I went in full platemail, but then my dad was a blacksmith. You kids have balls of steel these days.&quot; <br />
Alec winced. This guy had a way with words to make him feel bad, even if he didn&#39;t mean it like that.<br />
The man ran the card and pointed Alec to the local supermarket. &quot;Yeah, this is a town with an adventurers guild. They pay us to stay open all day and most of the night.&quot;<br />
Alec quickly purchased some food supplies and some stuff, which he stupidly assured the pretty cashier, was for his sister.<br />
<br />
Alec fell flat on his back on his bed in his hotel room and closed his eyes. He was exhausted. He immediately veered back up. He really needed to take a leak. &quot;Fuck, I never went after discovering my...predicament.&quot;<br />
He went to the toilet and habitually grabbed at nothing in his pants. He groaned and sat down. His boxers had a small stain in them. Peeing felt weird, like how it felt when he was Amber, except now he was himself. Afterwards, he carefully wiped his pussy and went back to his bed.<br />
He needed to decide what item to tackle first. He was going to go to the adventurers guild tomorrow, maybe he could create a party.<br />
<br />
Alec lay in his bed, sleep didn&#39;t want to come to him tonight. He knew one way, back when he was a guy, but that just seemed strange. He couldn&#39;t do that now right?<br />
Still, he was a little curious. He knew how it felt as a woman, but now he was a guy. Would it feel more like normal, or more like Amber? It was research, right? So it wasn&#39;t bad. Not worse or more perverted than normal jacking off. It wasn&#39;t like he was going to be able to hook up with girls looking like this, himself was all he had. Right?<br />
Slowly he stuck his hands down the blankets and on his underwear. He felt the warm smooth mound beneath the fabric, so alien yet undeniably his. He slowly started rubbing it, thinking of the hot green skinned girl at the wizards guild. It felt, strange, but good. He started rubbing faster, his finger and the fabric slid between the lips and he shuddered as it moved over his enlarged clit. He was wet, he was warm. <br />
He pulled his hand back and stuck it inside his boxers. He squeezed his fat clit and moaned. More sensitive than his erect cock was, yet very similar. He slid his finger past it and between the outer labia. Rubbing the inner labia. God that felt good. He felt his vagina walls twitch as he thought of the the wizards guild. He lay on his stomach, his hips in the air as he rubbed his pussy. <br />
He felt the pressure building. He gasped as the sudden sensation of his own finger penetrating him. He pumped his finger in and out while rubbing with the other hand. The pressure was building like normal, but he felt so empty. His vagina walls clenched around his finger. Before he knew, two fingers slipped in and he gasped again. Yes. His other hand grabbed his fat clit as he buried his head into the pillow.<br />
It was coming. He rubbed even faster, he was so fucking wet. He wanted it, he needed it deep! He pushed his fingers deeper. Coming! He gasped &quot;DOCTOR!&quot; <br />
As he felt the release race through his body, his hips bucking. His body quivered and he collapsed. He lay there breathing heavily. What did he just say? He wondered as he fell asleep.<br />
<br />
The following morning he got up early and felt a little embarrassed. He knew he started thinking of the green skinned girl, but did he really gasp for the doctor? What was wrong with him? Did he turn gay? Was he always gay? Not that there was anything wrong with that, but maybe he was just bi and never knew? <br />
This was way too confusing, maybe he should just abstain until he was transformed back. <br />
Still, the thought lingered, but what if these feelings stayed?<br />
He changed his underwear and got dressed. He had breakfast in the hotel and left to the adventurers guild.<br />
