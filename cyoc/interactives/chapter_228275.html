<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark woke up, feeling an odd weight on his face. <br />
<br />
Opening his eyes, he could clearly see that his face was still buried in his friend&#39;s bosom.<br />
<br />
Aaron...no...Mark remembered him calling himself Ari. Herself?<br />
<br />
He still couldn&#39;t quite believe what had happened yesterday. All of it was just... so much. <br />
<br />
Trying to get away from her, he soon found that he couldn&#39;t get out of her firm grip. Six of her arms against two of his. <br />
<br />
So, he chose to enjoy the fact that he was being cradled by an attractive woman, even if that woman had been the most masculine guy in the friend group just yesterday.<br />
<br />
Almost placing a hand on Ari&#39;s hip, he wasn&#39;t quite sure what to do.<br />
<br />
Something primal in him wanted to feel her up, but that wouldn&#39;t be appropriate without her consent... even if she herself had one hand firmly on his junk as he just noticed. He would just have to assume that happened while they were asleep. <br />
<br />
Ari&#39;s body was kind of cold, he realized. <br />
<br />
Was she... cold blooded now or something? That would mean she would have to be very careful in the winter. <br />
<br />
Overall, her body was rather smooth, hard, and heavy. Her skin did not give way in the way human skin did. Her breasts and genitals were softer than the rest, squishy even. <br />
<br />
A part of him wanted to fondle them, but that would be creepy, right? She was asleep and couldn&#39;t say no, so he should probably not do that. <br />
<br />
Her sleeping body obviously didn&#39;t have the same thoughts holding it back as  its hands were all over him.<br />
<br />
The feeling of a woman resting on him was oddly...fulfilling in a way. She seemed so content. <br />
<br />
He wanted to kiss her, but again, he held himself back. He didn’t want to be a creep. <br />
<br />
It would take a couple of minutes for her to suddenly open her mouth and yawn loudly as she stretched every single limb before opening her eyes and locking onto him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, yesterday wasn&#39;t just a dream, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We really did that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark nodded again.<br />
<br />
She sighed. &quot;Guess I am a spider chick now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only till afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ari gave him an odd look for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... and then we will turn this around by making YOU the hot and horny lady  for a day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark blushed at the thought even if deep down he found it a little exciting. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess...it&#39;s fair.&quot; He told her.<br />
<br />
Ari looked surprised. &quot;Didn&#39;t expect that. I was just joking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Might I remind you that I am bisexual and was in a relationship with Michael once? Getting dicked is nothing new to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Ari was the one being bashful. <br />
<br />
She seemed to think for a while, still resting on top of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You make me feel beautiful.&quot; She said. &quot;It is a really odd feeling. I feel appreciated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark thought for a moment. &quot;Heh, I wish I could feel handsome sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are!&quot; She insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s just the effects of the transformation talking out of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raising her voice, sounding slightly angered, she said. &quot;No, your standards for what is and isn&#39;t beautiful are just warped by everything around you.  You look decent. 7/10. Stop comparing yourself to super models, and maybe you&#39;ll be fine with your looks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slightly shocked by her outburst, he looked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... sorry for...diminishing myself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ari shook her head. &quot;Sorry, I just...can&#39;t stand my friends talking about themselves. It is the same as when Leira or Michelle complain that no one is ever going to love them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of their eyes narrowed at once. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right, that is also new timeline shit, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think.&quot; Responded Mark. <br />
<br />
They kept close to each other for a while. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you...want to keep cuddling or...?&quot; Asked Mark.<br />
<br />
Stretching, she said. &quot;Nah, if we do that my libido will make me do stupid stuff again. I am not interested in getting knocked up by you today.&quot;<br />
<br />
She seemed to think for a while,&quot;What would happen to the fertilized eggs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The transformation would become permanent&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? It is literally just a cell.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrugged. &quot;I also find it weird. I am starting to suspect it isn&#39;t quite a matter of practicality and maybe more of ideology...or worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The programmer of the pad having a breeding fetish.&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would be surprised if someone who made something like that wouldn&#39;t have a dozen different kinks.&quot;<br />
<br />
They continued chatting for a moment before eventually getting out of bed, Ari staring at him like at a Juice piece of meat. <br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t used to sleeping with someone with a much higher libido than his. <br />
<br />
Eventually he got his clothes back on, to the dismay of Ari as she couldn&#39;t keep her eyes of his chest. <br />
<br />
She spent a lot of time till she found something that both felt comfortable and didn&#39;t look like it was designed by the God of lust. <br />
<br />
Even when trying to look casual, she felt intimidating. She was a whole lot of woman.<br />
<br />
It actually made him feel a little inadequate to see that she was not only more beautiful but evidently stronger than him. He did find her strength attractive, but it also made him feel bad about his weaker physique. <br />
<br />
They left the room, getting a knowing glance from Michelle  sitting on the couch who gave Ari a thumbs up oddly enough. <br />
<br />
Apparently, they hadn&#39;t been as quiet as they thought last night. <br />
<br />
Leira soon joined them for breakfast, pulling a kilogram of raw meat out of the fridge. <br />
<br />
Upon getting weird looks, she just reminded them that she was a dragoness. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, who is our next victim?&quot; Asked Leira. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t we just chill today?&quot; Retorted Michelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I think we have to think tactically.&quot; Said Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drawing up battle plans?&quot; Joked Ari. <br />
<br />
&quot;What I mean is that we need certain things. A doctor is going to be needed if any of you should ever get sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do that when the time comes.&quot; Responded Leira before putting a claw on her heart. &quot;I, for one, want to have some fun with this. Let us go to the beach and make some babes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ari didn&#39;t seem to vibe with that. &quot;Use it on people who would want it. Furries or whatever. I see moral problems with anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are such a buzz killer. You know that?&quot; Asked Leira. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am the substitute for your lack of a conscience.&quot; Retaliated the spider. <br />
<br />
Mark and Michelle got to watch as the two erupted into furious debate. <br />
<br />
Michelle put an arm around his waist as if trying to comfort him, but it was obviously more for her own sake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cut it out, you two!&quot; Proclaimed Mark eventually. &quot;I am not tolerating the breaking of our friendships over this!&quot;<br />
<br />
To his surprise, the significantly larger dragoness and spider stopped shouting at each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, master,&quot; sighed Leira with slight bitterness. <br />
<br />
&quot;We will focus on those who seem like they would like it or really deserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking pleased with herself, Ari seemed content while Leira was less so. <br />
<br />
The conversation then went to where they would go today. Ari decided to take a day off, and the rest of them wouldn&#39;t have to work today anyway.  <br />
<br />
So, they decided to go to the plaza, certain that a candidate would find themselves. <br />
<br />
As they walked through the city, they got a couple of looks, but nothing of real interest happened. Someone snapping a pick of Leira was the most interesting thing that happened as she did a couple of poses on her four limbs. <br />
<br />
Travelling through the vibrant Plaza, Leira and Ari were approached for pictures multiple times. Michelle, less so, but Mark was pretty sure she liked it that way. <br />
<br />
They sat down at a small bakery, getting something to fill their stomachs.<br />
<br />
The sin was shining down on them as they watched the people go by around the centre of the plaza. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then what are we going to transform the next person into?&quot; Asked Leira.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much more importantly, are we going to make them aware?&quot; Asked Michelle.<br />
<br />
That was a question they weren&#39;t quite certain about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having other  people run around who are aware might cause them and us problems.&quot; Said Michelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, if you intend to continue your male-to-female gender-bending streak, then what would happen if you transform someone much more attached to their masculinity into a feminine woman. Instant gender dysphoria.&quot; Added Ari. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then we should make them unaware. Mental changes can be repealed, unlike physical ones, if we change our minds.&quot; Told Mark. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good to know.&quot; Said Ari. <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t their reaction part of the fun?&quot; Asked Leira.<br />
<br />
Mark rubbed the back of his head. &quot;I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
They eventually came to the conclusion of mild mental changes. Their memories would remain mostly intact even if they as a person changed. One important aspect was that the command to not tell anyone about it would be ingrained into them. Another was the &quot;transformation acceptance increaser,&quot; which would make them tend towards a better reaction than they would have without it. Someone who was really angry would only be pissed off at the changes. <br />
<br />
With that negotiated, it was time to find a new person to transform. <br />
<br />
Leira pointed at the owner of the bakery, a young man, maybe in his early twenties. There was a hyper-realistic drawing of a bee on his apron with a heart beside it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we picking off all the small business owners?&quot; Joked Mark. <br />
<br />
&quot;I bet that guy would love being a bee.&quot; Offered Michelle.<br />
<br />
Leira rolled her eyes. &quot;You and your anthro bugs.&quot;<br />
<br />
It appeared that they were in agreement as Mark pulled out the pad. He had gotten a message from the company that made the TF-Pad, but he decided to ignore it for now. <br />
<br />
Scanning the man, they found out that he was called Samuel. Some symbols appeared during the scanning process. <br />
<br />
&quot;Favorite animal: Bee<br />
People are very likely to prefer becoming their favorite animals if anthro transformation is enabled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selecting the favorite animal option, Mark was met with a preview of Samantha when a pop-up appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make queen?&quot; Read Mark out loud. <br />
<br />
&quot;What does it do exactly?&quot; Asked Ari.<br />
<br />
Opening a tool tip, he read with an increasing blush. &quot;<br />
<br />
- Guarantees attraction to men. (Bisexuality still possible)<br />
<br />
- Pregnancies result in more eggs.<br />
<br />
- Honey produced from mammaries has a 9 in 10 chance of transforming people into bee workers (always female) and a 1 in 10 chance to turn them into drones/princesses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys are so into this.&quot; Facepalmed Ari as the rest of them were a little bashful.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is more.&quot; Proclaimed Mark. <br />
<br />
&quot;This person will be a vassal instead of a servant. Vassals are those with the ability to transform people independently from you and serve as an intermediary to the servant class. <br />
<br />
They will still start as subservient to you but may choose to seek their own destinies in the future even if they have a good relationship with you, becoming rivals, allies, or neutral parties. While vassals help you grow your power quicker, they also serve as a check on you. Should you ever start being too malevolent and oppressive, your vassals may start getting ideas.<br />
<br />
Having at least one vassal is a requirement for going beyond 100 transformed people.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was a lot to swallow.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are really expecting their users to go full world domination, aren&#39;t they?&quot; Commented Ari. <br />
<br />
Leira laughed, the draconic sound alerting nearby people for a moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon craned back to them as she sat beside the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I was in control here, this city would already be under our thumb.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your.&quot; Replied Ari.<br />
<br />
Mark shook his head and selected the queen option. <br />
<br />
The preview proportions shifted, growing taller as the abdomen expanded to a suitable size for storing a couple dozen fist sized eggs. <br />
<br />
Mark halted before clicking the accept button. <br />
<br />
He took a good look at Samuel, unsure of whether or not to do this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would he like this?&quot; He asked himself.<br />
<br />
As if to answer his question, a message appeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are far too kind-hearted to be the user of a TF-PAD. Look, we are adding an acceptance indicator that will show you how likely someone is to like the body and personality you want to give them.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, a new indicator appeared that stated that Samuel&#39;s reaction would be confused awe followed up by rapidly increasing acceptance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are they so desperate to get you to transform people?&quot; Asked Ari.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do they gain out of this?&quot; Questioned Michelle.<br />
<br />
Shrugging, he pressed the button that would make Samuel become Samantha, the queen bee. <br />
<br />
Samuel served another customer when his hands started to harden, nails becoming claws as his hands took on a black pitch.<br />
<br />
Looking down in surprise as his customer left, he raised his hand.<br />
<br />
What the fuck was happening to him?<br />
<br />
Stepping backward in shock, he almost fell over as his legs grew longer, shapelier while his toes became claws. <br />
<br />
A collar of fluffy fur took over his neck while black exoskeleton advanced up his arms.<br />
<br />
No, it couldn&#39;t be. He was too old for this to happen!<br />
<br />
This thought was quickly disproven as he pushed his rear backward, his butt becoming increasingly plumb. <br />
<br />
Antennas started poking through his lengthening hair that was taking on a golden color. <br />
<br />
His hips widened to fill his pants further while his thighs thickened only to be covered in that similar exoskeleton.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s shock had become awe as he stared at himself in fascination. <br />
<br />
Blushing, he saw his pants tear and got a view at his crotch where his dick was being pulled inwards, his new ladybits forming while his testicles underwent duplication multiple times to become ten pairs of ovaries. He felt every last change like a tingle. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...am a woman!?&quot; He shouted as his shirt evaporated into thin air, revealing his feminizing torso.<br />
<br />
His nipples hardened as the flesh below them bulged outward, becoming furry, golden breasts that grew and grew till they were half the size of his head. A feminine moan erupted from his lips. The sensation of his new mammaries filling up with honey was oddly pleasing to him. <br />
<br />
Soon, two more arms joined the fray as he started to feel himself up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe it. Oh! Is that how I sound like? Sounds sexy.&quot; He purred.<br />
<br />
Below his shoulders, wings grew out.<br />
<br />
Oh, this was just fulfilling all of his childhood fantasies!<br />
<br />
Almost instinctively, he lifted his butt into the air as an abdomen shoved its way out above it. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, his head had reshaped, becoming softer and feminine, his mouth framed by mandibles while his eyes had become compound ones. Fur and exoskeleton would soon claim his head.<br />
<br />
His nose and ears were just small holes on now.<br />
<br />
As the transformation finished, Sam&#39;s tattered clothing flew up at him, becoming a form-fitting, white dress. <br />
<br />
He hugged himself in giddiness.<br />
<br />
His little bakery, meanwhile, had also gotten a little upgrade, now being much more bee themed. <br />
<br />
A dull pain encroached on his mind for a moment as it was filled with a few commands and a sudden sexual interest in men, he realized, as he suddenly felt attracted to pretty much every adult in the plaza. Were people always this hot? Also, why did he suddenly feel like calling himself Samantha?<br />
<br />
But above all, there was a deep fondness for a man she had only seen at her little bakery once or twice. <br />
<br />
Mark and his little band sat at a table.<br />
<br />
Sam walked over, giddy and happy. Her legs were a bit unwieldy, but she would manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, master! Look, I am a bee woman now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark, who was looking up at her in quiet awe, took a deep breath. <br />
<br />
&quot;How are you feeling, Sam?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome! I didn’t know this could still happen at my age!&quot; <br />
<br />
She looked down at her chest. &quot;The whole woman thing will need  time to get used to, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam turned back to her bakery. <br />
<br />
&quot;But, what happened there? Where did all the bee stuff suddenly come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
The group eyed each other. Sam obviously thought that this was just some distant bee ancestry finally manifesting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps more mental changes are in order.&quot; Whispered Leira.<br />
<br />
Mark sighed and walked up to her, grabbing the TF-PAD. <br />
<br />
He scanned her again, being locked out of body options. <br />
<br />
Instead, he gave her new knowledge. Knowledge of the TF-PAD and the knowledge that he was the cause of her change.<br />
<br />
Sam suddenly clutched her head and then slowly turned to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. This is why I feel this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment, she gazed off into the distance.<br />
<br />
When she turned back to him, she wrapped her arms around Mark and gave him a kiss on the cheek, followed by a light slap. The other three ladies instantly appeared offended as Mark put a hand on the spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have to give me lady parts?&quot; Asked Sam, her arms pushing up her chest from below.<br />
<br />
&quot;I prefer women, sorry.&quot; Replied Mark. <br />
<br />
Sam grinned as she leaned down to him.  &quot;You&#39;ll buy me bras and other lady products out of your pocket. If I am gonna have to be your hot bee lady, then I want some benefits out of it, at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark agreed. <br />
<br />
Walking away, she said. &quot;I meanwhile, am gonna have to do some self-exploration and figure out my identity all over again. Fuck you for making me want dick by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like her already.&quot; Commented Ari. <br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t you have made her a bit more submissive?&quot; Asked Leira. <br />
<br />
&quot;A bee queen being submissive?&quot; Doubted Michelle.  <br />
<br />
They continued chatting about Mark&#39;s new vassal. Her higher degree of autonomy was quite obvious as his friends suddenly seemed absolutely, instinctively repulsed by the idea of anyone ACTUALLY hurting him. <br />
<br />
Going around the Plaza, they continued to do a little shopping.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the time for Ari to turn back had come. They retreated behind a building  and watched in anticipation for Ari to become her old self again, but as the minutes passed by... nothing happened.<br />
<br />
The realization slowly dawned on them. <br />
<br />
Ari turned to him slowly, studying his nervous face. &quot;...Fuck.&quot;</p>
