<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, grandma&quot; said Dani, as Julia settled into the car &quot;Wanna get laid tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia had been stimulated by her new body and sexuality, the extreme attractiveness of the new female bodies she had been surrounded by, and those two cute teenagers who were just so obviously right for each other once they worked up the courage to admit it.  She was also powerfully curious about what sex with a woman was like.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a wonderful idea, dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++<br />
Surrounded by middle-aged and elderly women who looked like what they were, Elizabeth felt more comfortable than she ever had since the Great Change.  (There were some former men there, but they wore no makeup and were dressed in modest clothing.  Why can&#39;t Robbie be more like that, Elizabeth thought.)  They had made a great fuss over Billie, although they were clearly saddened to hear that she was a changed boy.  They tried to cheer her up, claiming that God would turn her back into a boy, a topic that really didn&#39;t interest Billie.<br />
<br />
The service was a kind of fundamentalism that was usually a big turnoff for Elizabeth, but she didn&#39;t want to be rude and she was moved by the sincerity and fervor with which these women prayed for the great curse to be lifted.  She found herself joining them.<br />
<br />
++++++++++ <br />
Katherine and Sophie were doing the dishes as Logan played video games. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey&quot; said Katherine &quot;Logan needs our acceptance right now.  If being butch is how she comes to terms with being a girl, we need to support her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, sweetheart&quot; answered Sophie &quot;It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve heard how people talk about Kate behind her back, and I hate the thought of people talking about Logan that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The world is a very different place now&quot; Katherine replied.  &quot;Hopefully people will be less cruel and ignorant now that patriarchy is gone forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe&quot; Sophie answered &quot;But I don&#39;t know.   People are people.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
After a wonderful day of humiliation at school as she introduced herself to her classmates with her new name, Dumbass White Bitch was back home with her parents, who could barely muster the interest to ask how her day had gone, not that DWB had any intention of giving an honest answer.  (The fact that her parents were now both women didn&#39;t seem to have changed their relationship, which continued to be based on obsessive hostility to each other and poorly concealed indifference to their child.)  Her heart leapt when she saw she had gotten a text from Queen-bitch Kira &quot;Hope your ass is enjoying its night off, cause my paddle is gonna be busy tomorrow!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dumbass White Bitch went to sleep with a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++<br />
This is two nights in a row out drinking, Robbie thought.  I&#39;m having a good time, but do I want to turn into an alcoholic?  The thought of another morning in Hangover Town distinctly failed to appeal.  After her second cocktail, she overcame her exhibitionism, made her excuses and left (Mary and Lucy were kind of sending body language that they&#39;d rather be home ripping each other&#39;s clothes off anyway.)  Elizabeth and Billie still weren&#39;t home from their mysterious &quot;meeting&quot; so Robbie settled in for an evening of masturbating to Lucy Lawless in front of the TV.<br />
<br />
She flipped briefly to local news to see that there were two big stories--a mysterious woman who had been found wandering the streets with a bloody knife and a video of a car disappearing on the road.  The Great Change was going to make it difficult to identify the woman, as there was no way of knowing if she had even been a woman before the change.  They were working on fingerprints and dental records as well as cross-indexing with missing persons records.  The woman didn&#39;t seem to know much about her past, but her reactions seemed to indicate that she had been some kind of prisoner.  Poor thing, Robbie thought.<br />
<br />
As for the disappearing car, the general attitude seemed to be that we were all now living in a world where there were going to be a lot of things that couldn&#39;t be explained.  Got that right, Robbie thought.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
Julia woke up and looked with a fond smile at the gorgeous black woman still sleeping on her bed.  They had met at a club Dani had taken her to, started talking, and found agreement both on their past histories--both were formerly straight born-women who had been widowed, old and in pain before the change--and on their enormous excitement about their new lives and curiosity about their new sexuality.  When Julia had suggested satisfying that curiosity with a no-strings-attached one night stand, the other woman had eagerly agreed.  A quick dash back to Julia&#39;s apartment and a long session in bed as the two women tried things they had only heard about in their previous sheltered existences.<br />
<br />
The sleeping woman awoke.  &quot;Good morning, Miss Julia Armitage.  Is that coffee I smell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Miss Sabrina Carter, and it most certainly is.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
Hmm. . .Allison thought as she sorted through her closet, what is precisely the right outfit for going to a ball game with your butch girlfriend and her mother who was formerly her father?  Something femme but sporty, proper but with just the right hint of sluttiness that Logan will pick up on and the old folks won&#39;t.  I never had so much fun getting dressed as a boy!<br />
<br />
But Allison&#39;s day was just beginning, as Logan drove up with Katherine, came to the door, offered Allison her arm, walked her to the car, and opened the car door for her.  It was the most perfectly happy moment in either of Allison&#39;s lives.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
Robbie and Elizabeth went through their weekend morning routine without saying a word to each other, their faces expressionless masks.</p>
