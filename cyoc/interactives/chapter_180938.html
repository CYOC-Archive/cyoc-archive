<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You look over your still-changing body as you lay on the ground.  Your lower body is grossly disproportionate.  Your hind legs and hips are massive, forcing your rear into the air.  Your spine has elongated, but not nearly far enough have the lower half of a full cow.  Your forelegs are the furthest behind, as they&#39;re clearly too small to support your weight.  While you cannot see it, you can certainly feel a tail slowly lengthening among your hindquarters.  Your upper body was far less afflicted, with just cow ears and horns adorning your skull.  Well, that&#39;s not entirely true.  While they were human, you recently gained two prodigiously large breasts, a clear warning that your days as a man were numbered.<br />
<br />
It was so surreal, to feel your form continue to grow in bulk as your mother and sister watched.  Your second chest barreled outwards, slow but unyielding as it tried to catch up with the rest of your changes.  With little else to do, you looked pleadingly to your mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry baby, you&#39;ll bloom into something beautiful.  Just let the process flow through you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were confused by her words.  &quot;Wait.  If yooou...&quot;  You&#39;d forgotten about how the changes had made you moo out some words.  Surely, you could prevent that if you focused on it.  &quot;If, you, knew about this curse-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a blessing, Milo!&quot;<br />
<br />
You grunted as your body bulged out further.  &quot;Whatever.  If you knew that we turn into the animals we keep, why put me with the cows? Why not let me decide, or have me tend-&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mother gave a confused look.  &quot;Cows were your true calling!  And that was fortunate, because we needed someone to tend the cows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cows were NOT my calling, I just did as I was told.  Why didn&#39;t you do it, or-&quot;  Your voice had further modified, resulting in you sounding less male and more husky female. &quot;-Or, have Amber do it after she changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I would be separated from my horses and Amber, her chickens.  You&#39;ll understand how crazy that sounds once you&#39;re finished.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your legs have seemingly grown enough, allowing you to stand.  As you do, you feel the terrible weight that your lower body must now be.  You looked nearly as large as some of the dairy cows you&#39;d milked, and you were still growing.  You were about to offer a rebuttal, but the act of standing seemed to cause the changes to accelerate.  You grew dizzy as you tried to keep yourself upright, but more concerning were your assets.<br />
<br />
Your udder quickly went from a pink patch to a massive bulge, filling the space between your hind legs and nearly throwing you off balance.  Not to be outdone, your breasts exploded with newfound growth, dwarfing your other family members&#39; sizes as each grew larger than your head.  You struggled to breathe, cupping your hands beneath your mammaries to help relieve some of the weight on your chest.  Instead, you learned that your breasts were only halfway done as you felt two new, unmistakable lumps obscured by your current rack.  In a matter of seconds, a second pair of breasts bulged out, shoving your original pair further into your line of sight as they fought for space.<br />
<br />
You take a staggering step forward, only to feel a sudden chill as your udder&#39;s sensitive teats were dragged across the floor.  A mooing moan escaped your lips from the sensory overload.  You guide your hands over your mammoth breasts, realizing they, too, were unbearably sensitive.  Not only that, but the nipples were elongated, like some kind of hybridization between human and cow.<br />
<br />
Through the haze, you realize just how easy it is to lose yourself to this body.  You bite your tongue to focus on the pain, but even that was muddled.  With little else, you punch yourself in the breast.  What was ecstasy quickly turned to nausea, allowing you to focus on the real world.  <br />
<br />
You&#39;re not sure how long it took to snap yourself out of it, but you now stood much taller than your mother.  Of course, you chastise yourself.  Cows are kept for their meat and milk, and if your sister was a &quot;queen of chickens,&quot; it&#39;s no surprise the &quot;queen of cows&quot; would have more than what any one cow could offer.  As you slowly regain focus, you realize your mother and sister are arguing, with Amber doing most of the talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;...has a point.  I was fine with my change because it wasn&#39;t too extreme and I did think the eggs were useful.  I thought Milo was going to become a bull-centaur and he&#39;d be fucking cows or be well-hung and that&#39;d keep him happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Amber.  No matter what you or Milo thinks, your animal calls out to you and you take care of them.  It doesn&#39;t matter if he was taking care of dogs, or fish, or turkeys.  He&#39;d have become a cow centaur regardless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, that really only applies to you.  You liked horses.  I hate chickens, but I did it because that was my chore.  I like this body because I won&#39;t ever need to deal with chickens with my own steady supply when I leave the farm.&quot;<br />
<br />
You take a few heavy steps forward, causing your various assets to sway out of sync with your core.  Thankfully, it seems you&#39;ve grown into your udder so it doesn&#39;t drag.  You clear your throat as you approach your family, causing them to end their discussion.<br />
<br />
Your sister gave a sheepish look, then averted her eyes.  &quot;Looking...Large and in charge, Spotty.&quot;<br />
<br />
You focus on your mother.  &quot;Okay, I&#39;m changed.  How do I go back to normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is your new normal-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You and Amber were human just few minutes ago.  Tell me how to change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mother and sister exchange glances.  &quot;Well...&quot;</p>
