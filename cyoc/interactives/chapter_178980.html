<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy was so shocked, that she couldn’t say anything or even scream. She looked around- her legs transformed in the water, so nobody should have seen transformation- but could she be so sure? Then she looked at Veronica, who stopped swimming too. Now Veronica noticed that her hands have changed too- they were covered in pink scales and the same webbing and side fin that Amy had grown. In order not to show her tail, Amy dived and swam, much faster than before transforming her legs, towards Veronica. „WHAD DID YOU DO TO ME, WHY HAVE I BECOME A FUCKING FREAK?”- asked Veronica madly, and then she saw that Amy evolved the same hands, and that she now have tail instead of legs.<br />
<br />
 &#8232;&#8232;„What did you… Are you a real mermaid?”- asked Veronica, now more scared than angry&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
„I have transformed a few minutes ago… It must be cream’s side effect, I didn’t know that this will happen”- answered Veronica<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;„YOU DIDNT KNOW? What are we going to do now, what will happen to meeeeee…aaaaaaah”- Veronica could not finish her sentence when she started screaming. Amy understood that Veronica’s legs started transforming too. From third’s person’s perspective she was watching the same situation as happened to her before. Her tail was forming on Veronica’s legs, and like her hands and swimsuit turned pink. By the way the swimsuit, because she was wearing a bikini, the bottom part was teared down. &#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Veronica looked with shock and fear at Amy and asked again- „What are we going to do now? What will we say to birthday party guests? How will we explain that our legs have changed? How will we get our human forms back?”- she kept on asking.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
„I maybe have a plan, it’s not so clever and I can’t answer all your questions, but it’s better than nothing. Look at me and behave like me”- said Amy and swam towards pool’s edge and sat on it, exposing her tail to publicity. <br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;„Whaaaat, are you both mermaids?”- asked one guy who was closest to Amy. He and other people couldn’t stop looking at Amy and her tail. Few of them took photos of Amy.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
„Yes, for today’s special me and Veronica are mermaids”- said Amy with wide smile. „I think, that you didn’t notice, but on the pool’s bottom was a chest with our mermaids costumes, the gloves- she waved her hand, and the tail. Me and Veronica have been training few weeks to do such an amazing show, right Veronica?”- the last part Amy said to Veronica, who was still in shock and stayed at the centre of the pool and moved to join Amy.<br />
<br />
„Yes, it was so difficult, especially to hide our costumes and then put them on, but I think that everything worked well”- said Veronica with shaking voice. &#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
This story seemed and sounded to be believable, so the people continued partying. Amy and Veronica asked two muscular guys to put them on pool chairs, because they wanted to rest after their show. But still, party was focused on them and people kept on coming to them, asking some details and taking selfies with today’s specials. Maybe everything went so unexpected, but Veronica was sure that everybody from now will talk about this legendary party. After few minutes on pool chair and few drinks she calmed down and started thinking again about the rivalry. She was glad, that on the one hand Amy didn’t take the whole attention, and to be honest, being a real mermaid was so exciting experience, if only she was alone at the pool, or at least with one of this handsome guys… on the other hand, she didn’t have an idea how she will become human again, and what’s more frightening, Amy didn’t know it too. &#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Veronica asked Amy about the last subject when the atmosphere among the party guests relaxed a little bit. Amy didn’t know what to do but, she asked somebody to bring her bang and her staff to her, including box with fish cream. There was a phone number to shop where Amy had bought it, but unfortunately, the shop was closed on the weekends, so they had to wait for two days with her tails, fins and only god knows what else to contact some shop worker. &#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
During this time, they could focus on their transformation effects. They didn’t lost their fingernails, but they got the same colour as rest of their hands, and get a little bit longer nad sharper. They were afraid that they can’t spend so much time without water, but it was okay for them. Still, being in water was so pleasurable feeling that they considered going back to pool or maybe this time hot tub… One thing was sure- they weren’t mermaids like in cartoons or some TV shows and movies. Their tails looked more natural and… alive, not just like straight limb covered in scales, in addition with scaly tops. They could bent their tails, that legs in costume tail could not manoeuvre, but they didn’t do it because they couldn’t explain that to the people. Because of obvious reasons Veronica kept her upper part of bikini, and Amy didn’t take off her one-piece suit, which she kept only in order to cover her breasts, because her transforming pelvis had torn apart bottom part of the costume. &#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
The reason why Amy and Veronica admitted that they are sill changing was a fact, that their faces developed some kind of permanent make-up which maybe wasn’t the same colour like rest of their transformed bodies (which would be boring). They lips got more pink, but not pink like Veronica’s body and more fish like making them bigger and more alluring. Their faces got shiner, more clear look and their eyebrows turned into two lines of dark scales.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
„Hey, I saw your performance, and I have to admit that I’m not always speechless, but this time I certainly was, good job”- said the guy, who just now sat next to the girls. &#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
„Thanks, it took me a lot of effort to do such a complicated poses, but I’m glad that you like it”- said Veronica, who again felt a fight spirit between her and Amy&#8232;&#8232; <br />
<br />
„I meant you both of course, my name is Paul”- he introduced himself. „My father and I are running some water park and we want our staff to be so creative and skilled like you two”&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
„I can help you and your father to get more visitors, maybe even I can do some showing for you”- Amy felt her chance too.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
„Okay girls, If we could meet next week and talk about that making some training for our staff or if you, Amy, would like to work for us, I would be very glad.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
This moment Veronica reminded herself, that upstairs she has prepared bedroom, on purpose for such ocassion. She turned to Paul, put her scaled hand on his arm and started speaking softly and slowly „Yes, we can meet next week, but why are we waiting? It’s fine now, I have a lot of time tonight to discuss all possibilities”- she moved her fish lips to his ear and started speaking really slowly „Upstairs I have a special office, when I can talk with you about details of contract, and even show more of my… special skills”<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Paul looked like hypnotized, he didn’t say anything but he smiled and cought her tail by one arm, and her back by another and started walking with her towards Veronica’s house. Veronica could catch her phone and look with triumph at Amy and sent her a kiss. „Maybe being mermaid is not such a bad thing” she said to Amy and hugged Paul’s neck with her scaly arm. Amy was left alone at the pool chair and she felt defeated</p>
