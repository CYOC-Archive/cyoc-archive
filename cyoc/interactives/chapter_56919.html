<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lawrence had to object, &quot;The witches were hung, not burned, and wood was bloody <br />
expensive back then, so it wasn't like they could just throw it around tra-la-la. And <br />
burning witches is what they did in EUROPE, and in some countries still burn a dummy of a <br />
witch as part of the festivities. Hanging was how they killed witches in Colonies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Their bodies were burned after they were dead, hoping that would end the Game, no such <br />
luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Betty said, &quot;And wouldn't everyone have dehydrated to death if everyone was just <br />
unconscious for the witches' trial long enough to proceed with due process that Marie Cruz <br />
was dead set on using, not to mention the wandering predators, the SHEER ACCIDENTS <br />
that would happen from people fall over like zombies when holding a cutting knife or <br />
riding a horse!&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza nodded, &quot;I didn't say it somehow SAVED LIVES. If they had remained conscious <br />
they likely would have recovered their wits much faster, and could have likely helped Marie <br />
some of them that were closest to their previous selves before the witches remade them. <br />
Like I said, Joella, Ben's family, the former mob, and the like were unique individuals, not <br />
merely robots.&quot; Marie-Eliza added, 'It's the same reason why some of the gem twins had to <br />
go BACK to being twins, and they were only separated for a few hours... these children, <br />
family, and pride, had been alive for months, rooting their place in existence. Much like the <br />
game itself, they existed independently of them.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Those witches were wrong,&quot; Maddex's heads said together since they were wired to the <br />
same brain and thus didn't have independent Egos like Joy and Ingrid. &quot;Dragons scales are <br />
tough, really tough, but they CAN'T survive swimming in molten lava anymore than a a <br />
lupman in the best equipment in existence today could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The witches had never seen a volcano, and everything they knew about dragons was <br />
hearsay or folk tales, leaving Europe when so young, they hadn't had time to really learn or <br />
meet dragons themselves to stamp out myth from the truth.&quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
1689 August 10th 1:11 PM <br />
<br />
&quot;ENOUGH!!!&quot; Gaal whose name mean abomination roared. It was enough to make even Lilith <br />
shudder. Her sisters looked at her. &quot;YOU THINK TWO HUMANS AND A DRAGON AND A <br />
FELMAN CAN DEFEAT A COVEN OF WITCHES, AN ARMY FAMILIARS, AND A PRIDE OF <br />
LEOMANS-?! YOU-ARE-MIS-STAKEN!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Outside, Marie Cruz felt a shudder, and in her gut, and in her eye that saw without seeing, <br />
she knew were about to get very bad. <br />
<br />
&quot;What we -create-,&quot; Gaal hissed along with Lilith, &quot;WE CAN ALSO DESTROY!&quot; Gaal swore, <br />
having the most lucid thought she had in years no matter how brief. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz's sixth sense screamed a warning, &quot;LINUS! GET AWAY FROM THE CANNON!&quot; <br />
Marie Cruz rolled away from the weapon and Linus who still had a firm grip on it so it <br />
couldn't be stolen from him.  He dropped it. That wasn't a mistake. The mistake wasn't <br />
getting as far as he could away from it and not laying on the ground with his hands over <br />
his hears and his mouth open like Marie did. But Linus didn't have a sixth sense, it didn't <br />
give the precious two second start warning Marie Cruz had been given. <br />
<br />
As the cannon started to glow, Linus had just enough time to take one step away, and turn <br />
his head and bright up his hands. And the cannon exploded. Deafening. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the discarded Cannons around Kathrine and others still around the witches' <br />
grounds turned into giant serpents, all programmed to protect the witches' holdings and <br />
kill all intruders on sight.  Kathrine harsh lessons from the Roman Lupmans was the only <br />
that saved her from being bitten in the leg and recieving an amount of poison that would <br />
have dissolved her bones and killed her in minutes it was so potent.  <br />
  <br />
Marie turned to check on the teammate she had different historic and philosophical <br />
viewpoints on, and made a small gasp in horror when Linus looked at her. A lesson man <br />
would have, should have been, screaming in the purest agony. Where Linus' hands had <br />
been were now mangled stumps. <br />
<br />
Linus looked at his hands, staggered to his feet and grunted, &quot;I do believe we had best <br />
hurry.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gaal then sent a SHOCKWAVE of adrenaline and electric force through her knocked out <br />
pride and familiars, FORCING THEM AWAKE! Only the dead, stayed dead. That was the <br />
power had never achieved, in spite of being perhaps the most powerful in existence. <br />
<br />
Dawn awakened with a headache, but awake, aware, and able to fight... like the familiars <br />
and Hercules and Earl as they too rose awake... of course Hercules was still trapped under <br />
a super heavy door... but he was able to lift it up enough for the familiars to get out from <br />
underneath him. <br />
<br />
In one fell swoop, Gaal by her lonesome had undone a large chunk of the Hunter's progress <br />
and advantage.  And the Hell was not over yet. <br />
<br />
Drago make the perfectly rational assumption that Twilight would be a slow moving brute <br />
with no reaction time or agility. <br />
<br />
However... of the witches' creations 'perfectly rational' is the last thing he should have <br />
expected. <br />
<br />
Drago's assumption had been wrong.  Twilight was not some poor animal whose traits had <br />
piled on top of each other going beyond what their musculature was intended for... her <br />
body, bone structure, the shape of her muscles, the way her muscles connected, her <br />
internal organs, her lungs, her nervous system... ALL OF IT... had been remade to make her <br />
body a perfect killing machine. <br />
<br />
Twilight did a foreword flip, and landed on all four of her hands, and with one strong PUSH <br />
of her super human strength, she propelled herself right at Draco, her feet making contact, <br />
cutting scales, and knocking the wind out of him and him out of the air. They landed <br />
together, Draco just managing to avoid him wings from suffering a second damage. <br />
<br />
Draco was no soldier, no warrior, in spite of what his ancestors boasted, battle prowess <br />
was learned, not born, he had been in only the battle with the witches, and the THINGS <br />
That Would Not Be Spoken Of during the trip the New World and the encounter with the <br />
lupman ship captain that was settled without the need to set anything on fire. <br />
<br />
And Draco in this twisted turn of events... for one moment, forgot the most basic rule of <br />
breathing fire. Never ever try to breath fire in close range combat, no matter what. <br />
<br />
Twilight reacted as fast as Lioness would, and clamped on Draco's jaw like he was an <br />
crocodiles. And the flames back-washed. If he had been human, his lungs would have <br />
been burned alive and he would have suffocated. Instead, he only coughed blood as a <br />
reflex in his throat saved him. He took out the daggers... and Twilight upper arms grabbed <br />
his forearms... while the lower arms grabbed the daggers, and crushed them ignoring the <br />
pain. Draco kicked her in the knees, then the stomach, then the chest, and then the faces. <br />
She didn't let go. He clawed at her hands, she didn't let go. <br />
<br />
Finally he banged his head against hers and then her other one... leaving his dizzy but free <br />
and back pedaled from her as her she held her heads for a few seconds. <br />
<br />
Kathrine having beheaded a giant snake that tried to bite her in the face and didn't make <br />
the mistake of back into Draco, knowing that that was the LAST THING they needed, least <br />
the child familiar's attention was finally united in one target rather than two. <br />
<br />
Then things got worse.<br />
<br />
The children were insane, not stupid, and were childish, not mindless. And they had a very <br />
deadly weapon children were legendary for: imagination. <br />
<br />
Gloria shouted, &quot;ICE!!!&quot; But it wasn't at Kathrine or Draco, it was at the sky... and sleet <br />
began to fall, a rain and snow mix began to cover the battle field... it might have slowed <br />
down the cold blooded snakes some... but it also put out all of Draco's fires (it was not an <br />
oil-fire)... and rendered it nearly impossible for him to fly, and effectively useless for him <br />
to maneuver if he somehow got air born. <br />
<br />
'If we fight this as a war of attrition we're going to lose, badly,' Marie Cruz thought, 'If we <br />
treat this as a typical military battle we're going to lose, badly. The witches are the only <br />
targets that matter... the more time we waste on their guardians and protectors, the more <br />
we making accomplishing our real goal impossible... ' <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you tell where the witches are with that dead eye of yours?&quot; Linus asked, his mind <br />
still going in spite of everything, holding his musket with his arms and doing the trigger <br />
with his teeth if need be. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Yes... the amount of power they're putting out now, it's easy... I can tell where they <br />
are... they aren't near any of the windows... which would made things easier ... I think... <br />
inner most room... second floor.&quot; It SCARED Marie Cruz that her second sight was had <br />
managed to increase in ability since the battle began... the witch grounds were practically <br />
over-saturated with Mana. <br />
<br />
The two hunters entered through the front door, only to be confronted by the child <br />
familiars and leomans that had been knocked out before, but now fully awake and ready <br />
for round two. <br />
<br />
Linus, with two missing hands, looked at Marie Cruz calmly and said, &quot;I do believe this is <br />
where you and I part ways Miss Cruz, The Lord Willing, You and I shall meet again both in <br />
this world and the next. Please be a dear and lay the witches to rest before I end up torn <br />
limb from limb or end up something TOO unnatural please? Thank you. May The Lord Be <br />
With You.&quot; He said in a perfectly calm and friendly voice. Then snarled and ran with his <br />
musket held in his arms ramming the baronet halfway into Earl's stomach before he caught <br />
up with his hands and Linus then kicked him knocking both away. <br />
<br />
Dawn leapt onto Marie Cruz, knocking the wind out of her, the larger, stronger, faster, and <br />
more reaction quick lioness pressing her attack cutting at Marie's flesh. But Marie was used <br />
to pain, and stabbed Dawn in the joints of her arms and knocked her off her for a few <br />
seconds. She felt the child familiars on her, pressing their will against Running Bear's <br />
charm. Marie Cruz tabbed into her sixth sense, and threw them off course for a precious <br />
minute before the child familiars (including a blond Lupman with very long hair) adjusted <br />
for it. <br />
<br />
Marie LEAPT at the stair case, landing on a protect door they had blasted off and onto the <br />
broken stairs. That was when she heard a herculean roar, and saw the strongest Leoman <br />
she had ever seen lift the heavy armored door above his head with equally herculean effort <br />
and THREW IT AT HER! <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz avoided the might projectile that would have smash her in two. But it did <br />
smash the upper part of the staircase thought... causing the frame leading downstairs to <br />
collapse along with part of the roof.  None of the smashed material reached the <br />
downstairs... However.<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz saw that she was now totally cut off from downstairs, and downstairs was now <br />
cut off from her and the witches. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz sighed, and took out the bowie knife she had edged with the bones of the dead <br />
witch, and took out of her bag a skull. Marie Cruz knew she was damned to Hell, she might <br />
as well, make use of forbidden tools for the higher cause then. &quot;Help me find them.&quot; Marie <br />
Cruz said holding the skull AND her crucifix in the the other hand and traveled in the <br />
effective maze that was the second floor letting her second sight and the higher powers <br />
lead her to the Coven of Chaos.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So it was just her against the witches at the end.&quot; Maddex's heads observed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes....  meanwhile, one by one, as the child familiars abandoned the original scheme to <br />
turn the hunters into mud, her friends were changed into things that were not her friends.  <br />
Linus being in a closed space would go down first, and turned into a an armless, legless <br />
female Venus sculpture on a pedestal.<br />
<br />
 Kathrine would end up being mass tackled by the lionesses in a horde. She had managed <br />
to disembowel the first two who tried.  She was able to out maneuver and squeeze out less <br />
enough, but was so distracted she didn't notice the child familiars invade her mind and <br />
turn her into a naked perky, and docile female child by the time she squeezed out. The <br />
witches never had the chance to expose her mind to the infinite chaos so she survived the <br />
transformation quite sane. <br />
<br />
For Draco, with his speed, determination, and natural resistance he lasted the longest, they <br />
turned into a forelegs purple dragon with the IQ of a dog.  <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz felt all of this... but she pressed on...  The witches being in the minds of all <br />
their slaves micromanaging their attacks at this point had left them distraction to their own <br />
bodies' safety, and this oversight gave Marie Cruz the advantage she needed, as well as the <br />
combination of Running Bear's charm, her sixth sense, and the shock of seeing their <br />
mother's skull DEFLECT a spell meant to atomize her.  Enabled Marie Cruz to send a <br />
dagger into Gaal's frontal lob. <br />
<br />
This shock wave caused reality to -snap back- on the most recent changes done through <br />
the witches magic, meaning within the last hour or so, meaning those to Marie Cruz' <br />
companions making them completely alive and whole and sane and most importantly, <br />
themselves... <br />
<br />
However since Linus' hands hadn't been technically destroyed by magic in of itself, they <br />
didn't grow back. <br />
<br />
Sister Kathrine was so happy it was over she didn't wait to get her clothes back on when <br />
she hugged Marie a few minutes later. <br />
<br />
Father Draco made putting his clothes back on his FIRST priority and made a point to never <br />
EVER speak of his short time having four legs like the dread feral dragons of legend with <br />
the brain of a pet. <br />
<br />
Linus meanwhile at once did some first aid on their former enemies, saving the lives of <br />
some, using medical supplies he had on him using his teeth and toes!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;And Twilight?&quot; Betty asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;She was a special case, since they she had made her changes willing to herself. She <br />
remained as she was... when the Big Bad Wolf Pack too Francis and Julianna for their own... <br />
she demanded she be allowed to go with them as their overseer... she actually found love... <br />
the result of witch married one of the silver twins' descendants eventually. Who was <br />
Marthas' ancestor...&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza didn't blame them for not believing that last part.. after all... Marie-Eliza <br />
herself found it amazing how she was a product of a lupman father and a human mother.. <br />
but it seemed all the species of Man could interbred in some sort or another... <br />
 <br />
&quot;And the rest of the twisting that the witches had done to Glendale?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, anything that hadn't found a root in existence Joella and her fellow 'orphans' <br />
would vanish once the witches were dead. Like the vast majority of age regressions and <br />
changes to the animals and houses and plants. Rosa and Monica were saddened that the <br />
end of the witches didn't let them age at a normal rate. But that is all in the future... now <br />
Marie Cruz began to make her way through the maze of the witches' grounds second floor, <br />
and to the room that served as the Chosen of Chaos' inner chamber. The witches still <br />
having no idea that the blades she carried were made from their own grandmother.&quot; <br />
 <br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Present Day, Present Time <br />
<br />
Sydney felt like a thief for not announcing herself as she stepped into the manor that <br />
afternoon. The gargoyles didn't attack her, after all, she was one of the pack, she was no <br />
criminal, they had no reason to block her or harm her. <br />
<br />
Sydney slowly snuck towards the manor, not sure why she was sneaking. She saw Alpha <br />
Kaylee still had the same taste in art and entertainment of the fountain was anything to go <br />
by. <br />
<br />
She entered the front doors, the lavender she-wolf there staring at the three giant entry <br />
way statues didn't look at her or seem to notice her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
The lavender she-wolf (Sydney was pretty sure her name was Sarah) turned to her and <br />
said, &quot;Hello... Sydney?... long time no see... come to help out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, maybe... what were you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just checking out the statues, something about them has been bothering me since this <br />
morning... &quot;<br />
<br />
The statues meanwhile conversed among themselves, asking their Monkey Prince if he was <br />
behind this somehow... be he assured his two mate he was now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wrong? What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno... it's just, seeing them incomplete like that feels more wrong than normal <br />
somehow...&quot; <br />
<br />
Sydney looked, and felt the same gut feeling Sarah did. &quot;I think I know what you mean.&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>What do you do now?</h3>
