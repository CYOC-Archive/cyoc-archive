<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait a minute... I got an idea!&quot; Jim said an instant before he used the balloon again. &quot;There&#39;s a pool party in Roger&#39;s house and he didn&#39;t invite me. Well, let&#39;s show him what he missed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim went to his father&#39;s room again and took a towel, a pair of sunglasses and his dad&#39;s flip flops. They were kinda small for his bigger feet but nobody will notice that his toes and ankles were poking out of them. The latex black underwear would work as his swimsuit because he didn&#39;t find anything better that fits him.<br />
<br />
Jim looked at himself in his parents&#39; large mirror and he smiled at what he saw. &quot;A little too hairy on the chest but...  Hey! I&#39;m still pretty handsome!&quot;<br />
<br />
Although he was an adult now, he obviously didn&#39;t know how to drive. Fortunately, Roger&#39;s house was only a few blocks away from his home, so he decided to walk. People on street stared at him, some of them impressed by the man&#39;s good looking and others terrified by his obvious display of nakedness. Anyway, Jim&#39;s cocky new confidence made him ignore them and kept walking to the party.<br />
<br />
Roger&#39;s house was big, maybe the biggest one in his neighborhood. The kid was son of the most important news presenter in their local TV, so he had both money and popularity. He use to make parties at his home with his friends, the sports team and any other guy he considered popular enough to be there.<br />
<br />
Jim and Roger used to get along in kindergarten, but that changed when they started elementary and Roger started to get attention due the things he could afford, including his giant pool. After that, Roger quickly joined the popular kids while Jim was left behind. However, that didn&#39;t end there, because the popular kids started to make fun of everyone else, Jim included. Everybody hates them but at the same time, everybody wants to join them.<br />
<br />
Jim thought that the balloon gives him an incredible opportunity to make a little of fun of them, but he wasn&#39;t stupid, he knew he can&#39;t just come in the party. Especially as a grown-up man that nobody will recognize. No, he had a plan, simple but effective. He would stay hiding near the pool and he would use the balloon to create some kinky confusion among Roger&#39;s popular friends.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take him too long to find a good place to hide. Those kids were so distracted by playing, talking and kissing that they didn&#39;t noticed the man watching at them from behind a bush. Jim recognized almost all the kids as upper grade classmates. &quot;There&#39;s no one from our class.&quot; Jim said as he watched those preteens pretending to be older than they are. After a while, he found out Roger, he was serving drinks to his friends and awkwardly joking at their lame adult jokes.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re using him as a waiter.&quot; Jim thought, he tried to feel bad for him but deeply inside he knew that Roger deserved it because he was a total dick with his former friends. &quot;You could try to fit among the older guys, Roger, but they will always look at you as a kid. Let me show you. Control Roger&#39;s age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim blew in the balloon and Roger started to grow at the same time. He didn&#39;t want that everybody freaked out, not now at least, so he didn&#39;t blow in too much. Just enough to make Roger look like an upper grade classmate, maybe two or three years older. However, as a 12 years old boy, Roger went through puberty in those few years. His height shot up almost a foot, his physique left his skinny look behind as he got some muscle definition and of course, some hairs grew on his armpits and, judging by the ones poking out from his swim trunk, from his crotch too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Roger. You look quite cute today. Are you hitting the gym or something?&quot; A beautiful blonde girl told him as she take a drink from Roger&#39;s tray.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh? No.&quot; Roger awkwardly replied and he immediately closed his mouth when he realized that his voice sounded deeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you don&#39;t look like a pipsqueak anymore, but you still need a lot of work to look as good as me or my boys.&quot; A big jock guy, who Jim wondered how he isn&#39;t in high school yet, told Roger as he flexed his toned arms and showed off his armpits hair, obviously hairier than the ones that Roger had just acquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to be a dick like that guy. But you could get a dick bigger than his.&quot; Jim said as he prepared to blow in his balloon again. &quot;Control Roger&#39;s dick size!&quot; And without been as careful as the last time. Jim used his powerful lungs to blow a lot of air inside the balloon.<br />
<br />
Roger who was shyly looking at jock guy posing in front of him suddenly felt a huge orgasm as he felt his dick growing inside his swimsuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Everybody! Roger is getting a boner by looking at me!!&quot; The jock guy shouted and everybody started to laugh at Roger who, although he was still growing down there, he ran away ashamed and crying. As he ran he could felt that his dick was elongating until it was too big that he can&#39;t run properly and started to strut with his legs quite spread.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; Roger shouted a second before his swim trunk gave up and bursted out. A giant foot-long dick and thick as his arm flopped out. He lost balance and fell on his butt in the middle of his living room. Fortunately, no body could see him, including Jim who didn&#39;t know that he had exaggerated with Roger&#39;s dick size.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is Roger doing in there?&quot; Jim said as he scratched his hairy chest. &quot;Oh, I really want to jump in that pool. But I have to wait a little more before that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t go out with this thing!&quot; Roger shouted as he tried to hold his ridiculously big cock. It was heavy and floppy like a bjg raw sausage. &quot;Think Roger! There must be something you can do.&quot; He said as he stood up and managed to hide in his kitchen.<br />
<br />
Roger&#39;s kitchen had a long mirror-like window to the garden. So, when Roger came in he made sure that no one was seeing him. However, he found out something else. A big burly man in his late 30&#39;s wearing only a small tight latex underwear was staring at his friends in the pool. Roger freaked out scared that he could be a pedophile or even worse, a murderer. He didn&#39;t doubt about it and used his phone to call the police.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jim was staring at the other guys playing around the pool. He had used his balloon a few times to change some girls&#39; breast size and a few boys&#39; height. To the jock who had made fun of Roger, Jim shrunk his package until he was as small as a baby one. He was suspicious of it, but he was so proud to check it in front of everyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, officer. I&#39;ll do it carefully.&quot; Roger said before he ended the call. &quot;Now... Let&#39;s tell the others...&quot;<br />
<br />
Some guys were sunbathing in deck chairs when their phones buzzed. &quot;It&#39;s a message from Roger.&quot; One of them said unawared that his feet was getting bigger at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, there&#39;s a man behind the bushes. Stay calm and go in the house.&quot; A girl read aloud as her butt got plumpier. &quot;Is this some kind of joke, Roger?&quot; She shouted expecting to be heard by her host.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit, why does no one believe me?&quot; Roger said as he watcher through the window that everybody ignored his message. Although, there&#39;s one who doesn&#39;t, Jim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! He saw me.&quot; Jim said after he heard what the fat ass girl shouted. &quot;He should have called the police. I need to move.&quot; Jim was ready to sneak out when he got an idea. &quot;Cops must came in a few minutes, but they&#39;re expecting to find a man in the house... So.&quot; He took his balloon and filled it with air before he said. &quot;Control my age.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he deflated the balloon he also regressed in age. All the hair and muscles he got as a man vanished inside of him. His height shot down until he was 12 again. However, his formerly tight underwear now was very loose and fell off his legs. &quot;Too young. Maybe I can be a little bit older and mix among these guys. Control my age.&quot; He blew a little in the balloon until he was 15 years old. Some hairs reappeared but not as much as when he was older.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better but not enough. Control my dick size.&quot; Jim said and he blew in to make his package big enough to fit his dad&#39;s underwear. &quot;And I need some ball to match. So, control my testicles size.&quot; He blew in again until he had a notorious bulge, quite big for a 15 years old boy. &quot;And now, to make things even funnier. Control Roger&#39;s age.&quot; Jim took a deep breath and blew the balloon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I keep putting up at these guys?&quot; Roger said as he watched them through a window. He didn&#39;t know that he was quickly getting older until he put a hand on the window glass and noticed the huge manly mitt that it&#39;d become.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the-?!!&quot; He started to yell but stopped when he realized that his voice had dropped too deep that it even scared himself. He kept looking at his body, unintentionally and continously flexing his new huge biceps. &quot;I-I-I&#39;m... getting... older!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger stared at his chest, broad hard and covered in a pelt of hair, his pecs emerged from it like two solid blocks. He moved his hands down through the hair, touching his well-defined six-pack at the time. He was astounded that he breathed so hard that he could feel how his abs moved in and out constantly through his big calloused palms.<br />
<br />
He shyly kept moving his hands down until he started to feel the jungle of hair that had grown around his crotch and thighs. &quot;Holy shit!!&quot; He gasped when he felt that his already big sausage had turned into a fat salami way more thicker than a soda can. A darker hue and thick veins that had appeared throughout all its surface made it look mature in contrast with its former clean skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t definitely walk with these!&quot; He gasped again as he put his hands on his big and hefty balls that hung low in a very hairy and wrinkled scrotum. For a moment, he thought he was carrying chicken eggs inside it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Who are you?&quot; A girl asked Jim as he tried to mix in the party.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Roger&#39;s cousin.&quot; Jim replied a little nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? I hadn&#39;t seen you before.&quot; The jock guy said as came closer to Jim. &quot;This is a small town and I known everyone around my ages, including freaks and nerds, and I&#39;m sure I hadn&#39;t seen you, although you kinda reminded me of that loser Jim.&quot;<br />
<br />
After hearing that, Jim knew that he must take revenge against this guy. But for now, he should keep pretending and divert the attention from him. That&#39;s when he saw him, the big burly man that Roger had become and Jim knew that it was time to create some panic at the party.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?!&quot; He faked. &quot;Who&#39;s that guy?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; The jock and the others turned their sight to where Jim was pointing and then they saw him. A freaking huge man staring at them through a window in Roger&#39;s house. &quot;What the-?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaahhh!!! He&#39;s naked!!!&quot; The nearest girl to Roger started to scream as she noticed that Roger wasn&#39;t wearing anything and his old fat schlong was swinging between his tree trunks thighs. Scared about her reaction, Roger tried to calm her down but he exposed himself even more instead.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, all the girls were screaming and running out of the place. Some guys did it too, but some others like the jock dude tried to be bold and stayed. Obviously, Jim stayed too as he was hardly trying to contain his laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh boy! This is better than I thought!&quot; Jim said to himself as some boys tried to keep their distance from the freaky nudist. &quot;I didn&#39;t expect that he turned into a beast of a man! That makes this even more hilarious!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You! Stop staring and call the police!&quot; The jock guy told Jim. He didn&#39;t like the idea of taking orders from that guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck! The police!!&quot; Roger shouted as he remembered that he had called the cops before and they&#39;re coming to catch a suspicious man. HE WAS THE MAN NOW!!<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right asshole! The cops will arrive at any moment and they&#39;ll take you!!&quot; The jock guy defiantly told Roger who was about to puke due to so much stress. It didn&#39;t take too long when police sirens could be heard in the house. &quot;They&#39;re fast! Keep an eye on him! I&#39;ll go for the cops!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim was really pissed off by that guy. It&#39;s the last time that jock gave him orders, because he was ready to twist this story even more.</p>
