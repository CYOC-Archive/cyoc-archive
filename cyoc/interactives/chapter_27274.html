<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Since the Cardinals just lost their star pitcher to another team, Jeff and Jason decide to <br />
help out and get another recruit.  Since both of them had been changed, they figured any <br />
of their Cardinals team gear would do the trick, so they sent some of their game worn <br />
jerseys up to the souvenir shop.<br />
<br />
An hour before the Cards' next game, 19 year old 6’5” Kurt decides to come early and get <br />
a good seat, only to find himself drawn to the souvenir shop.  As soon as he walked in the <br />
door, he noticed two game used jerseys - one for Jeff Smith, number 23 - and the other <br />
for Jason Beck, 45 - his favorite players for the whole team.  &quot;Damn!  The price is good on <br />
these too - only $100!&quot; Kurt said to himself as he tried to decide which one to pick out.  &quot;I <br />
guess I'll go with Smith since he's been on the team the longest&quot; and took it up to the <br />
register and paid for it, still thinking &quot;wow, I can't believe I got ahold of this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as Kurt left the gift shop, he realized it was too much of a burden to carry around the <br />
shopping bag with him for the rest of the day.  &quot;I might as well show my team pride even <br />
more&quot; he thought while he put the jersey on and buttoned it up.  When he buttoned the <br />
very top button, he felt a tiny jolt of energy come over him, but dismissed it thinking it <br />
was static electricity.  He then threw away the shopping bag and started heading to his <br />
seat.<br />
<br />
Step by step, Kurt's new souvenir jersey began changing without his knowledge or anyone <br />
around him.  The original number 23 on the front and back changed to number 29.  The <br />
name on the back then changed to Kurt's soon-to-be last name, Carpenter.  Just as he <br />
reached his seat, the t-shirt he wore to the stadium began changing underneath the <br />
jersey, becoming team issue.<br />
<br />
After sitting a few minutes, Kurt began thinking to himself about how cool it would be to <br />
pitch for the Cardinals, saying to himself “it would be so much fun to be the star of the <br />
team!”  The more he thought of it, he became more uncomfortable in his seat and <br />
extremely hot, and didn’t notice that his hair was retracting into his head becoming a <br />
brown crew cut, with his fashion black and white Cardinals baseball cap changing into the <br />
team issue red and white cap worn by the players.  <br />
<br />
“I really don’t feel good” he thought as he got up to go to the bathroom.  As he started <br />
walking up the bleachers, his socks began crawling up his calfs and his shoes changing <br />
into red and white Nike baseball cleats.  As he started to reach the area where the <br />
bathrooms were, his baggy jeans started to shrink and become form-fitting white baseball <br />
pants, with his belt changing as well to team issue.  Just has his clothes finished changing <br />
into his new uniform, he again felt another jolt of electricity.  “Damn, that hurts!” he <br />
jumped to himself, and just noticed this hallway just next to the bathroom door.  “I <br />
wonder where this goes” he said to himself as he walks down it, finding a door marked <br />
“Private Locker Room” that was unlocked, so he pushed the door open and walked in.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Jason appear from behind Kurt after he walked in, with Jeff piping up and saying <br />
“Hi Kurt, I see you found where you need to come”.  “What?!?!?  How did you know my <br />
name?!?!?” Kurt responded, somewhat scared that he was caught where he wasn’t <br />
supposed to be.  “You came to the right place Kurt, look at yourself in the mirror to the <br />
right” Jason responded, with Kurt taking a look at himself.  “What the fuck!  I didn’t wear <br />
this today!  What’s happene<br />
d to my hair!” he yelped.  “Well you’re becoming one of us <br />
Kurt, doesn’t it feel awesome wearing that gear?” Jeff calmly responded, putting his arm <br />
around Kurt’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess it does feel really good wearing this stuff” Kurt said just as his cock began <br />
to harden, starting to show in his baseball pants since he wasn’t wearing a jock yet.  “I see <br />
it does feel good, I can tell from your crotch” Jeff mentioned, “lets finish making you one <br />
of us dude, we’re only halfway done here”.<br />
<br />
“You notice the name on the back of your jersey Kurt?” Jason asked.  Kurt turned around <br />
and looked at the mirror, realizing the name on the back had changed to Carpenter, <br />
mentioning, “that’s not my last name.”  “Now it is stud” he responded as Jeff took him over <br />
to a large table.  “Hop up on this and lay down Carpenter,” Jeff asked, with Kurt laying <br />
down.<br />
<br />
“Are you ready to finish this up Carpenter?” both of them ask.  “I guess, it does feel pretty <br />
good wearing this stuff”  Kurt said in affirmation.  Both Jeff and Jason then grabbed Kurt’s <br />
arms and started stroking them up and down with their hands.  “This feels so good <br />
Carpenter, your arms are growing, muscle is expanding, you’re becoming a pitcher in the <br />
Majors dude” as the growth began, quickly swelling his arms to 22” biceps and filling out <br />
the jersey’s sleeves.  Jeff and Jason then moved their hands over the Cardinals logo on the <br />
jersey and stared rubbing his pecs, with Jason commanding “now you’re going to have the <br />
upper body to power those fast balls.”  Kurt’s pecs then started expanding, and his back <br />
muscles grew as well, making his jersey fit just right.  Then a fire started burning in Kurt’s <br />
abdomen, with a distinct six pack forming underneath the jersey.<br />
<br />
With his upper body now ready to throw fast balls, Jeff and Jason then began rubbing <br />
Kurt’s legs through the baseball pants.  “Now you’re going to have even more power to <br />
run bases” Jeff said and the growth began.  Second by second, his legs swelled with <br />
muscle, adding so much power he can now run bases at breakneck speed.  “Damn boy, <br />
you’re becoming one hot stud of a baseball player Carpenter” Jason declared as he and Jeff <br />
then decided to split up, with Jason starting to rub Kurt’s face and Jeff unbuttoning Kurt’s <br />
pants and rubbing the hard cock he exposed.  <br />
<br />
“So this feels so fucking good Carpenter, you don’t want to remember back when you were <br />
Kurt, do you?” Jeff asked, stroking the cock slowly.  “Awww, it feels so good, make me one <br />
of you” Kurt moaned.  “Then you are one of us.  Let Kurt go, let him disappear.  You are <br />
Chris.  Chris Carpenter.  You are our star pitcher” Jeff continued, as Carpenter’s cock <br />
began to grow, quickly becoming a 10” hard on, thick as a beer can.  Jeff moved <br />
Carpenter’s hand to his cock, with Jeff holding Chris’ balls, “you want to come with some <br />
huge balls, don’t you Carpenter?”  “Gawd, yes…..ohhhhhh”  As Chris kept moaning, his <br />
balls began to swell, stretching his ball sack and becoming the size of golf balls.  <br />
“One more thing left Chris,” Jason calmly mentioned as he kept rubbing Chris’ face.  “We <br />
gotta make some final changes to your appearance!”  As Chris kept stroking his cock, his <br />
face started to harden with his face becoming more masculine and a small soul patch <br />
appearing.  The tattoos the transformed Cardinals all shared in common then started <br />
forming, with number 29 tattooing itself to his left arm and a tribal armband forming on is <br />
right.<br />
<br />
“I think you’re done Chris.  Congratulations!” Jeff whispered into his ear, then quickly <br />
taking Chris’ cock into his mouth making Chris blow his huge load deep into Jeff’s throat.  <br />
“Just the kind of energy drink I needed” Jeff said as we wiped off his mouth.<br />
<br />
As Carpenter laid there recovering from that tremendous load, Jason began to zip up <br />
Chris’ baseball pants and patted his crotch, triggering a cup to form underneath to protect <br />
Carpenter’s valuable assets off the field.  “We need to go play the game dudes!” Jason said, <br />
helping Carpenter off the table and the all jogged out to the field to warm up.</p>
