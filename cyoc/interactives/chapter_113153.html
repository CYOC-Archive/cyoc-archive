<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Luna Brotherhood had just as hard a task in trying to keep things quiet regarding Lionel Ulysses death and apparent murder and thus the potential of weres being exposed to the world. They knew that someone had killed him, but from their various contacts and bugs that they had had planted within various law enforcement and even military agencies over the years, they had very little to go on. About the only thing they had that was concrete was the name &quot;Dymixious,&quot; which didn&#39;t truly say much. It gave them some hints, but also created an issue that whoever Dymixious was, he already knew about weres and was personally engaging in the same sort of tactics that the Luna Brotherhood had done for centuries. The two Luna Brotherhood members couldn&#39;t necessarily bring themselves to complain that Lionel Ulysses was dead, and in that sense sympathized with Dymixious, BUT the manner in which the murder was done had left just enough evidence that the police had questions. That was their main problem.<br />
<br />
As an agency, the Luna Brotherhood was centuries old and dating back to well before European settlers reached North America. It had played a role in trying to keep control over rogue weres and keep were communities and families safe from normal human hunters, who often couldn&#39;t tell a good were from a bad were and killed both because of it. In many ways, this had often meant that the Luna Brotherhood had had the most interactions with various governments of all kinds and even entered into agreements promising to fight for those governments in exchange for certain favors. The agreements were often vague enough that the governments would never be able to prove the existence of weres and thus allowed the Luna Brotherhood to continue its main mission and in its own way lead to the founding of various were sanctuaries, like Moon Lake. These contacts had often lead to the Luna Brotherhood getting access to certain biological agents that were the most preferred method of executing rogue weres, simply for the fact that normals would be alerted to more violent methods and suspicious of men torn apart and their scientists would be able to detect poisons strong enough to kill a were. Biological agents, however, while they could be detected were such that it would be harder to prove the act was murder and not that a rogue were hadn&#39;t simply gotten sick somewhere. This took years of practice to perfect, particularly as science and technology got better, but it was something that the Luna Brotherhood and dedicated itself to.<br />
<br />
And it was clear that it was something that Dymixious lacked and was attracting attention. And that raised two questions, how did the Seattle police get this information before they did? And who, what, and where was Dymixious? For the moment the Luna Brotherhood agents were dealing with the first of those questions and had their focus on the Seattle Police Officer Samuels. They&#39;d found some connections between Samuels and one of the bigger drug dealers in the Seattle/Washington State area and figured corruption might be part of it. Lionel Ulysses wasn&#39;t what one considered a traditional rogue were in that very little of his crimes involved him transforming to attack people. It was more that he seemed attracted to the same sorts of crimes that normal humans committed and the fact that he was a were simply complicated them. That may have put him on the hit list of more powerful criminals and that a crooked cop might have heard of Dymixious through them, as crooks tended to travel in many darker circles, and was either involved in hiring Dymixious to commit the crime or was using Dymixious as a scapegoat. For the moment, the two agents had followed Officer Samuels in the hopes of figuring that out.<br />
<br />
They had followed Officer Samuels to one of the poorer sections of town and to an apartment complex that was supposedly one of the main hideouts that of one of the bigger drug dealers in the area, the chief suspects in the murder of Lionel Ulysses. In a way, it proved the connections that they&#39;d seen, but they also knew that they&#39;d need to be careful. They didn&#39;t have any pre-placed agent in the building, which limited them with regard to getting close and for the moment that limited them to sitting a block away from where Officer Samuels had parked and listening in on the various police bands to see if Officer Samuels was expected to be elsewhere. So far none had come in, but then something began to come in that sounded like Officer Samuels speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything going on, boss?&quot; they heard Samuel&#39;s voice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing out of the usual, why?&quot; came the reply, clearly the drug lord.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this? the passenger gasped, &quot;Did we bug him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve had no opportunity to get close enough to do so... and even there, that&#39;d be a one time thing,&quot; the driver answered, &quot;it isn&#39;t like that nineties Godzilla movie where the French put a listening device on the New York mayor&#39;s jacket or shirt lapel and the mayor never notices it when he takes it off. Normally a person would see that sort of thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was a god awful movie,&quot; the passenger grumbled, &quot;but if WE didn&#39;t bug him... WHO did?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is the police band,&quot; the driver commented as he looked at the laptop that was plugged into the car and checked the program they had that monitored all those sorts of frequencies. It was even wired to the police radio they had installed in their car.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d mean the police bugged him,&quot; the passenger gasped...<br />
<br />
&quot;And that he&#39;s undercover,&quot; the driver nodded, &quot;the police have been trying to bust the guy we&#39;ve connected him to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Snookered by normals,&quot; the passenger grumbled, before the driver shushed him. The conversation they were listening in on was continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bunch a talk on the street,&quot; Officer Samuels was heard to speak, &quot;with the death of the Rat Pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... the little guys,&quot; the drug lord answered, &quot;Will miss them terribly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... Pal Joey and Pal Freddy have complained about them selling on our turf!&quot; Officer Samuels pointed out, &quot;Would we need to send a message?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Rat Pack trespassed, yes, but they&#39;ve been free agents for years,&quot; the drug lord answered, &quot;half the time when they&#39;ve sold on OUR turf, they&#39;ve been in OUR employ at the time... and even on the times when they weren&#39;t... they&#39;ve sampled enough of their own merchandise that they weren&#39;t reliable to be a real threat to our operations. Better to let the Rat Pack simply be the ones in front of us and potentially take the fall for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then who could have offed Ulysses?&quot; Officer Samuels wondered, &quot;The cops have already stated they want to catch the murderer. You don&#39;t think they&#39;d come OUR way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have nothing on us,&quot; the drug lord answered, &quot;they may suspect us, but they can&#39;t confirm anything... and as I said, we had no reason to kill Ulysses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we cooperate with the cops then?&quot; Officer Samuels asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; the drug lord replied, &quot;though... given how well Lionel Ulysses has hidden from the law and moved around and how much the Feds wanted to try him... I don&#39;t know anyone that would be dumb enough to walk into a hospital looked over by the Seattle PD and the FBI, kill him and then walk out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard some rumors about some guy called Dymixious,&quot; Officer Samuels commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; the drug lord asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Die-mix-e-us,&quot; Officer Samuels answered pronouncing the name phonetically, &quot;couple of random guys on the street... either customers or just livin&#39; in the area talked about the guy in whispered. Sounded like a brute of a hitman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;ll pass the word around and see if anyone&#39;s heard of this guy,&quot; the drug lord commented, &quot;sounds like the guy has balls if he&#39;s going to waltz into an area that&#39;s so well guarded. Could be useful for the guys who actually need killing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, boss,&quot; Officer Samuels responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though keep things quiet and low... even if it means stopping sales for the moment,&quot; the drug lord instructed, &quot;if the cops suspect some other gang offed Ulysses and come asking questions... they may run onto things they can arrest US on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Officer Samuels was heard to reply.<br />
<br />
The driver looked to his passenger and then sighed as the transmission seemed to cut out after that. They were both a bit embarrassed by essentially getting snookered into buying what was likely cover for Officer Samuels to get close to this drug lord for his undercover mission, which likely had to have been going on since before the hunt for Lionel Ulysses, but things like that could happen. The real question though, that remained was trying to find Dymixious.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what now?&quot; the passenger asked, &quot;the reporter seems to have been stonewalled by his own editor and apparently found himself a very attractive woman to go on a date with... Should keep Moon Lake safe from him... and our officer here is undercover and likely trying to find the gang connection to Ulysses&#39; death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If there is one,&quot; the driver sighed, &quot;right now our only other reference is this Dymixious, who we have no paperwork on beyond his name. For the moment, we focus on finding him. Even if he&#39;s thinking like us... he&#39;s being sloppy and thus risking weres being exposed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... to his home then?&quot; the passenger asked, &quot;stage it like a random break in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly... but that will have to wait until night,&quot; the driver answered.</p>
