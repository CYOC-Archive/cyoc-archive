<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle decided that the right thing was to try and confront Jen and Gabe's werewolf army. He carefully picked his way toward the high school, but not before stopping at home to borrow some clothes to disguise himself. He shaved his head, donned sunglasses and a business suit, borrowed his parent's car, and drove into the school parking lot. <br />
<br />
The lot was eerily deserted. He walked toward the football field, hoping to catch Jen there with her fellow cheerleaders. He was nearly at the basketball courts when an enormous fist conked him on the head. He woke up to find himself in the men's locker room, though he could see many undressed members of the cheerleading squad hoovering around. He was trussed up like a turkey, and lay flat on a bench. The leering faces of a few members of the football team looked down at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, so sorry I'm late Kyle. Your disguise was nice, but we could smell you from hundreds of yards away.&quot; Gabe walked into the room, clad in a pair of what had been jeans, but were now torn cut-offs, presumably cut off when the entire student body had changed into werewolves. A couple of his friends, stark naked, were beside him, carrying bundles of ragged clothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm so happy you could make it Kyle. Behold: the world's first all-werewolf high school! Jocks, nerds, cheerleaders, emo kids, science geeks, loners, stoners--it doesn't matter. Now they all howl at the moon, all united in their shared lycanthropy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;One big happy family&quot; sneered Kyle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; said Gabe. &quot;We're all packmates. Except you Kyle. Excuse me.&quot; He selected a shirt from the pile his naked friend was holding and tried it on. It was riddled with tears and holes. Gabe shook his head, took off the shirt and tossed it in the trash. <br />
<br />
&quot;You'll have to excuse the fashion show. We've been scouring the gym, trying to find intact clothing to wear. But the trouble is that when people change into werewolves, they tend to rip stuff. I still haven't found a decent shirt. Of course, most of us would just as well go naked. But some us must dress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To keep up appearances, when the superintendent arrives. Being an alpha, I have to do the thinking for our school. Flushed with the victory after having turned the entire school into werewolves, I had originally planned to infect the whole town. Glendale today, tomorrow the world. But I realized that if you want to get anything done in this world, you have to--excuse me--&quot;<br />
He paused to select another shirt. This one only had a hole or two in it. He kept it on. <br />
&quot;--If you want to get anything done in this world, you have to do it subtly. Or else they send the government, police and army after you. Excuse me while I try on these socks and shoes. Ah yes, they fit. Good--I'll wear these when the super comes. As I was saying, secrecy is key. For example, I realized we made a mistake when we killed at the teachers. Isn't that right Mr. Principal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was shocked to see the pale but apparently alive figure of the Principal stride in. &quot;Yes, that's right Gabe&quot; the man said blandly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thnak you principal--you can go now. As you can see, we used the T.O.D game to resurrect them as our willing zombie slaves. We plan on maintaining the facade of an all-American, normal high school, while all the time we continuing to infect newer members of the pack, and spreading lycanthropy throughout the country by stealth. Tonight we convert our younger siblings. And tomorrow, our football team goes out of town to play against Rocklin High. Naturally, we plan on giving the home team a nasty case of werewolfism. Isn't that right girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
The naked cheerleaders howled in unison. Gabe smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll do the same at every sporting event--whether it's our tennis, soccer, football, hockey, or lacrosse team, and the infected teams will do the same. Within a year, every high school in America will have become like ours. Every student will long to run naked, bestial and free, clad only in fur and surredering to the pleasures of the flesh and the hunt. But of course, there'll always be people who decide to get in our way. People like YOU.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle felt a scrap of clothing wrap around his mouth, as two unseen hands gagged him. He was yanked back as more unseen hands removed his clothing, until he too was naked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I could kill you right now Kyle. But as you said, you gave me this gift, and I feel it be right to transform you too. So listen up: transform or dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle tried to speak, but the gag defeated him. Gabe smiled and began carefully removing his own clothing and placed it on a bench. Now Gabe too was naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, you will transform into a frightened young deer. Once you've transformed, I dare you to run out of the school before we tear you to pieces. I'll give you a one minute head start.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle immediately fell to his knees, holding his sides in pain. He gaped as he saw his fingers merge and blacken into hooves. His head boomed with pain as two nubs of antlers tore out of his head. His face pushed into a nuzzle while light brown hair covered his body. He got unsteadily to his hooves. Gabe too was changing, followed by everyone else in the locker room. Kyle the deer looked up to see himself surrounded by a horde of drooling, savage werewolves. He turned and rocketed out of the locker, as pursued by the hounds of hell. He could here a clarion howl ring out, as the alpha signalled his packmates. The hunt was on.</p>
