<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">THEN - as you find yourself extremely restless that After tossing and turning for nearly an hour is when you had enough and decided to go for a walk, even if it was a rather late while trying to lose some of the excess energy for which was keeping you up at night. traveling down the dark and empty streets that while breathing in the crisp night air as you were gazing at the brilliant tapestry stars above you, you suddenly hear screaming ahead for you then rushed over to the spot where the commotion was at. you paused as you see Several meters ahead of you was a man beneath a streetlight that his body was visibly shaking for his back was turned, but his assailant stood Just a few feet beyond him - a snarling shadow obscured by the darkness, the silhouette of a massive dog (or it could of been for you weren&#39;t sure if it was for the silhouette was standing upright on two legs).<br />
<br />
although the beast was certainly terrifying that from your limited point of view on it is where you couldn&#39;t help yourself on being curious for the slightest bits of it seem to shine as it was reflective even, almost like its flesh was made of something else. Without warning that it then happened for a dog-like creature quickly pounces at the man while entering the glow of the streetlight as it gave you a better look on what it was while you were hearing strange noise form the beast, or some kind of wolf with some very human features (perhaps maybe the other way around for it was hard to tell because it was such a blend of the two). you were too amazed to even think of helping this poor sap for the person was now pinned by this monster while it bared its teeth as the sound it had made earlier was unmistakable to you now that it was the sound of squeaking latex against latex for this thing was made of rubber.<br />
<br />
You were unable to move as you were Rooted in place for the man&#39;s screams did nothing to inspire you on help him, or put your personal safety aside and run that you could only watch helplessly while the creature brings its snarling face closer to the man inch by inch... until the wolf-thing&#39;s face was inches away of reaches his. at this point however for you soon realize that the thing wasn&#39;t lowering its head just to bite him off for the kill, but it was melting over its victim instead as You were Looking down at the length of the creature&#39;s body while blinking to see the shine of its skins in the light for it was... purple? what was going on here while seeing the whole thing melting into a shapeless blob of goo as it was consuming the man who was struggling beneath it that After a few seconds&#39; worth of undulating is when the blob messily split into two smaller ones, leaving behind two puddles of liquid rubber to where it had formed for you see The first blob of goo you immediately recognize to be the purple skin wolf creature ans the features quickly taking shape.<br />
<br />
turning to see the second blob of rubber while hopefully expecting to see the man to emerge from it and escape that to your horror is where you instead watch to see the goo color shifts to blue as it clearly after gains feline features for soon a bipedal latex blue cat-thing was standing next to a bipedal purple latex wolf-thing. their gaze were soon aiming squarely at you that instead of pouncing on you as you were prepared to run is when the two creatures begin to slowly sink back into the shadows, leaving you alone by a streetlight under which lie puddles of liquid goo rubber. you Move towards the light and looking at the puddles in where Things seem safe enough - the movement seem to have stopped when they split from that thing as they now look just like any regular (albeit liquid) latex for Strangely enough, all of them look like they each have different colors while knowing the blue and purple goo you&#39;ve already seen were there of being a cat and wolf.<br />
<br />
along with a myriad of others As you continue to approach the puddles is when you shortly after hear a loud SHLOOP by your right foot that you look down to see you&#39;ve managed to get yourself stuck in a particularly deep puddle of this strange stuff for your foot was now completely submerged in a shiny latex of pink goo. it comes out easily with no worse for the wear when you pull your foot out of it that you had enough and decided to go home as fast as you can, leaving behind the events night&#39;s while seeming like it was nothing more the a bad dream. even if it was more like a nightmare while hoping it will just fade away like a faded memory that it wasn&#39;t a dream for The latex was real, but it wasn&#39;t just real for it was more legion - an entity risen from some forgotten dark pit, whose only purpose was to sate its hunger.<br />
<br />
However, this wasn&#39;t just ravenous hunger for it had gone without a meal for centuries that the man it had consumed was to last it for a few centuries more... until it had touched you. This hivemind that was driven by pure instinct had ended its starvation for it now knew a new sensation to go by, lust. it wasn&#39;t sexual lust however that this being&#39;s purpose was far too strong for such any mortal wants, but pure obsession as it formulated a plan while using an intellect it hadn&#39;t accessed since its creation.<br />
<br />
with this lust driving it for it was After eons of existence, millennia of wanting to only consume that it will soon have a new purpose in life. it wouldn&#39;t be long now as it&#39;ll Soon have what it so strongly desire for It wanted to have you for you soon wake up early in the morning the next day, ready to tackle a new day that you felt completely refreshed while having the prior night a total haze. not sure why for all you can clearly recall of it was having some trouble sleeping, although you doubt even that would give you on how brilliant you felt while being in such good spirits.<br />
<br />
so good In fact that you felt like doing nothing more than to go outside and enjoy the great outdoors for you then took a quick shower while gulping down a hot cup of coffee as you then head out your door. taking a deep breathe in while swallowing a small fragrant of the summer air that you scarcely managing to get three steps out from your front door, before your foot hits something on the ground as you started to set out the door. seeing a nondescript brown box when you looked down that On closer examination is where you can&#39;t seem to find any indication as to who sent it to you, where it&#39;s from, or even how they even brought it over to you for The outside of the box was completely free of any sort of markings while leaving you with no hints about it whatsoever.<br />
<br />
thinking the great outdoors could wait awhile longer that you decided to take the box inside and sit it on your table for Your curiosity was biting away at you as you didn&#39;t wast time, not even a single second before opening the package. once inside is where you find a layer or two of packing paper while beneath it was a mess of shiny rubber that you quickly flip the box upside down and poured out its contents and spilling the costume as it was inside all over your table. arranging the outfit very Carefully out along your table while getting a clearer look at what it is that you look at the weird outfit splayed across your table, but Definitely a costume for soon realize you&#39;re looking at a costume of... well a lion of course.<br />
<br />
Almost reflexively that you quickly rush over to lock your door for didn&#39;t want anyone walking in and getting the wrong idea about what&#39;s going on here. it&#39;s not like you&#39;ve sent for this thing anyways After all as you thought about it while wondering what kind of person would want to send this over to you that Whoever delivered this to you must&#39;ve done it by hand, something like this must be custom-tailored for it made it to get it your size extremely difficult. still, the thought of it might also be some kind of joke for it did crossed your mind that you then realize The box itself had no return address, tags, or even a mailing address for there wasn&#39;t even a logo, text, nor anything to indicate as to where it came from.<br />
<br />
in your sheer dumbfounderness while Moving your eyes over it is where you quickly took notice of what looks to be about your size that it&#39;s definitely as big as a real lion in at least one way for It was a full-body suit, one with what looks like a pair of extremely uncomfortable paw-shaped boots at the feet with a full-lengthed lion mane face that it had a pair of eye holes. the muzzle was hollow for the teeth in the mouth sat limply for the fact of it did make the costume a bit more believable that the hands did end in paw-like fingers as it certainly did help the look exactly, making it prohibitively difficult to do most of anything while wearing it. your eyes reluctantly move downwards towards the one part you hadn&#39;t investigated yet that Like the muzzle, this part of the costume is where a penis was apparently meant to go looks completely hollow for It&#39;s long enough to even fit a lion as you&#39;d imagine it while thinking on how a human being could hope to fill it out was anyone&#39;s guess.<br />
<br />
At its base was a sack - you didn&#39;t need to do any imagining to figure out what it&#39;s meant for for it&#39;s similarly large enough as you thought that Maybe something else was supposed to help fill this part out for you then shuffle through in the box to see if there was an extra piece to go with it while finding nothing of any sort. you quickly stop yourself afterwards for On the thought of realizing that your curiosity had you trying to figure out how to jam a cock into a costume. On top of everything else that the latex rubber as it was made of was rather shiny for it certainly did feel rather nice, but it must be way hot in there for it was like an oven inside while thinking on Whoever it was actually made for must be willing to go a pretty long way to satisfy their own strange kinks.<br />
<br />
you Then consider it to be one of your neighbors, but this didn&#39;t make sense either for None of them were into these sort of stuff like this that it Looks like you&#39;ll be stuck with it while thinking of going around to hang up posters. still, it might not be a good idea to add in the details of it belonging to someone with a massive cock and huge balls to the community bulletin board for you thought about the kids reading the flyer and getting in trouble for it by someone else in the community that all was left is to figuring out what to do with it as you could of destroyed it, dumping it somewhere, even the idea of selling it while feeling uncomfortable of getting rid of something which was worth much more then what this costume must be. somewhere in the back of your mind while thinking these ideas through is where you might as well just be broadcasting &quot;Hi, I&#39;M A PERVERT&quot; to every television in the world that The only other alternative option was to keep it here with you.<br />
<br />
keeping something like this here means that you&#39;ll never have the nerve to use it, but you might have the chance for it on Halloween as it&#39;s your favorite time of the year while thinking of your clothes for they could probably fit over the costume pretty easy. they also would be able to hide the weird stuff down there for if anyone asks you that you could always just say you&#39;ve found it cheap at a yard sale for you&#39;re into Halloween enough to be willing to buy it as it was also flimsy, but it was a good enough to have people you know for an excuse. yet thinking about the costume now for it left you with a question in mind of how well it will actually fit you that pushing the issue aside as The day was just too beautiful to waste up is when you decided to wait with this mystery lion outfit until later while figuring out what to do with this kinky lion suit, which weighs more than what you expected it to be for you lug the suit up to your room and carefully folded it into your chest to be stored for now.<br />
<br />
bounding down the steps after closing the trunk that leaving your house at an early morning as the sun was now rising while resolving to enjoy the day ahead of you is where Your day was a non-stop parade of activity, but you couldn&#39;t get the thought of the outfit out of your head. before noon for lunch as you were going over to your favorite place for a bite to eat, Mcdonalds for you ordered your usual meal and went by to your friend&#39;s house for the afternoon of video games that after dinner with the love of your life is when you were out to the movies later to complete the day&#39;s events while the sun was setting later to complete the day you were having. it was shortly night time again as you felt Exhausted for you soon return back to your darkened room with every intention of going right to sleep, but as you were about to get into bed is when you remembered the mysterious package that came earlier this morning as you then headed back to the truck for you opened up the trunk lid to see the suit and pulled it out.<br />
<br />
wondering where it came from, who sent this, did one of the guys do this for you, these and more thoughts raced through your mind that you laid the lion costume down on your bed, neatly unfolded and arrayed as you then thought about it coming from your lover. &quot;what if, No. it couldn&#39;t be from my sweet lover, could it? if so, how did she get it for you? everyone would have known about it from the start, but if it wasn&#39;t her, then who?&quot;<br />
<br />
you Cautiously begin to walk over to the costume and picked it up for a better look when Suddenly, the suit begins to rises! The hollow shell floats over your bed like some kind of cheap ghost effect, but there wasn&#39;t any strings holding it up for You were backing up Before your terrified eyes while the limp head gains definition as it turns toward you with its empty eyes that you then notice the head wasn&#39;t the only part of the costume to become solid at the time. the cock and sack, once formerly flaccid and flat was now erect and ready as The rest of the suit still hangs like a shroud though that you kept on backing up from the levitating suit for it was getting closer to you while shortly getting yourself caught up and stuck in a corner.<br />
<br />
unsure of how to combat this treat while cowering in the corner for you didn&#39;t know What do you do now as you sank to the floor that you realized the lion costume was once laying harmlessly on your bed has now taken on its own while the head and groin were the only areas to have a solid shape to it. fearing what it wanted that the rest of the costume outfit was hanging down and trails on the floor, like a ghost would for it was terrifying to see the vacant eyes holes looking down at you as you kept on staring at the thing while frozen in place to not even move at all. the flying suit was soon lowering itself to you, until its snout was mere inches from your face for the lion suit then retreats a little back from you that slowly standing back up is when it slowly rotates around you as it then returns back to you while noticing something when a tear somehow fell out of its empty eyes.<br />
<br />
instead of getting ready to make a run for the door as you somehow knew that it wanted something is when you shortly realized the costume of the lion had back away while figuring out you were being scared by what was going on just now, yet before you knew what the suit wanted is when you suddenly heard a flushing sound coming from your bedroom&#39;s toilet. enters the room that It was one of your friends as he didn&#39;t noticed the lion suit flying there, until about three minutes later of being in the room with you. what was he thinking when he entered the room, unknowing about the danger to come from it.<br />
<br />
&quot;hey dude! Sorry if I had to use the toilet and... WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!&quot; he screams that just like you being trapped in a corner by the costume, the suit soon had its sights on him as it then turns towards your friend while yelling out for him to run and warning him to flee.<br />
<br />
however, in a sudden turn of events as the seams on the back of the costume opens up that he entire suit rushes at the place where your friend was once standing as the costume started to engulf him stripping him off of his clothing for once this was done is when it was begging to place his arms and legs in. its torso was positioning itself on your friend for you didn&#39;t knew what was going on at this point that all you knew was to help your friend, before the lion suit could completely merges with him when a thought of your friend being a lion-man did sounded cool in your head while hearing Your friend screams out loud. &quot;NOOOOOO!&quot;<br />
<br />
so, you decided to head over towards your bed and and sit while watching your friend become covered in the latex lion suit for it was better him then you. true you did wanted to help him out of the costume, but it looked so strong that a claw like fingered hand would of pushed you to the other side of the room with a lot of strength for you to lose consciousness as you started to rub your groin for you were soon taking off your pants while thinking of him in the lion suit. you were really starting to get turned on by this as you began to masturbate yourself with joy that while this was happening is where the lion costume continues to merge with your friend for it was soon after pushing massive muscles out of your friend.<br />
<br />
seeing you on the bed for you did nothing to help out while masturbating yourself is where The costume of the lion&#39;s tail attaches itself to your friend&#39;s spine as your friend could somehow all of a sudden move it at will that he also felt something shoving up his ass. as your friend&#39;s crotch area was being coated that it soon had the sack, cock, and sheath of a lion&#39;s while having the legs finish transforming themselves over your friend&#39;s arms and legs for the last thing left was it&#39;s head, but was it soon was covering your friend&#39;s very own before long. your friend&#39;s mouth was lined up to it sharp teeth like fangs while extending itself to the lion&#39;s muzzle for your friend&#39;s eyes had finally filled the empty eye sockets that just as you began to climax and shot out shots after shots of your seaman is where little of The costume starting to brainwashing and mind control your friend, to adapt your friend into its new body.<br />
<br />
still wearing the lion outfit as your friend in the suit was struggling and trying to get it off for it was only hurting your friend though that to it, the suit felt like skin as this made your friend more concern while figuring out what was happening. giving off a mighty roar that inside the suit, you realized that your friend was gone for your friend was being controlled by the living suit as it became one with the latex lion suit. slowly getting itself up on its feet to stand while becoming somewhat of a new being that there was now an anthro latex humanoid lion creature in the bedroom with you for you were now thinking about having your friend being a lion-man didn&#39;t sound cool anymore as it truly just happened here.<br />
<br />
NOW - as its gaze was now aiming squarely at you while slowly approaching you to your bed that instead of pouncing on you for the attack, killing you even is when the creature hops onto your bed to clean off the mess of seaman you created with its tongue. scared as you were prepared to run out of the room from what was once your former friend, leaving you stun by what it was doing on your bed that with some of the seaman left on you from your masturbation is when it was beginning to lick it clean off of your feared body while gently rubbing its groin parts with you. once finished with you and the bed from licking off the seaman up with its latex tongue as you see it still had your friend&#39;s eyes while using them like they were its own that maybe there was still some parts of him left dangling inside this beast, yet there was only one way of knowing for sure if of anything really left of him inside this thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP THIS NOW! GET OFF OF ME, THIS INSTANT!&quot; you yell out that to your surprise is when it crawled off your bed and stand by the bed side, at the ready.<br />
<br />
&#39;this is to weird. it&#39;s almost like it was to serve me like my friend did when he agreed to cosplay as my... butler. hmmm, maybe there is some things left of him that&#39;s still lingers inside this new being after all.&#39; you began to think as you gave it a try, by giving out a few commands first.<br />
<br />
&quot;alright, can you speak? if so, I want you to say something to me while placing on the underwear that&#39;s on the floor of my room as it&#39;s by the pile of clothes there.&quot; you commanded for you pointed to your friend&#39;s clothes as they were laying down on the floor that to what were seeing, the latex did just as you told it to do while slipping on a pair of underwear your friend was once wearing.<br />
<br />
once fastened on as the latex lion&#39;s tail was hanging over its rear that the anthro was soon looking back at you for it then spoke with your friend&#39;s voice, yet sounding a bit deeper in pitch while also some what scruffy. &quot;sorry for scaring you like this, master. still, in case if you&#39;re wondering what happened to him that your friend is safely find inside of me for he and I are now completely merged into one being. he may have done some things with you in the pass, but now it&#39;s my turn to be with you from here on out that my services are yours to command. that said, what are your orders? what do you want me to do, master?&quot;<br />
<br />
you couldn&#39;t believe what you were hearing from this thing that not only your friend was still somewhere in this anthro latex lion, but it was calling you master. looking over to your closet as the outfit your friend dressed up in, back when he was playing the role of butler with you for it was still in there waiting for him that in a way was now his new outfit to wear as your anthro butler. turning your attention back to the latex lion man that before anything was done, you had some question which needed to be soled for he had somehow the answers.<br />
<br />
&quot;tell me what I want to know first, then we&#39;ll see from there. first off, tell me where did you come from? who created you? do you have a name? what would everyone that knows my friend think about his absents right now?&quot; you stopped there for you didn&#39;t want over ask him with too many questions for there were still some left unsolved.<br />
<br />
&quot;well first of all, that I would rather not tell you as to where I&#39;m from for not even I know where I came from and who created me. however, the less you know about where I&#39;m from, the better for I don&#39;t want to endanger you my master. you can call me by your former friend&#39;s name, but they&#39;ll later think that I&#39;m now him for I really don&#39;t have a name right now. so if you like, you can call me what ever you like for my new name. as for your friend absents that they&#39;ll think he&#39;s on a world trip while traveling around from one place to another, even going from foreign country side to far off areas of the continents and over seas. the only ones that know of his where abouts are just the two of us, for now. just you, and me.&quot; the latex lion said as he answered mostly all of your questions. <br />
<br />
&quot;alright, that would explain a few things. yet why for there must be a reason that of all the people in the world to serve form, why choice to serve under me?&quot; you shortly ask the most important question of your life.<br />
<br />
not wanting to have you be scared based on his answer truthfully that he tried to think of an answer while trying to twist and bend it, without telling you to much about last nights incident. &quot;well master, you seem like a nice guy as there were some that were also kind too. however, only you seem to know what that kindness is to your friend and all around you. compared to my last master for I&#39;ve imprinted on, which I did the same with you when I was just a hollow suit that you master are the only I&#39;ve made contact with for it felt like forever to me master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, so you imprint on that person base on whoever you make contact with first as they&#39;ll then be your future master for life. dose that sound right?&quot; you asked for it nodded his head as to tell you it was true on every word you said while leaving out the part of last nights event, hoping you don&#39;t bring that subject up for it would then had to tell you the full truth about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;w-wait just a minute here. so your telling that based on this imprint you described it to me, i&#39;m... your master?&quot; you asked, still not getting it on him becoming your servant while calling you master as you go though the process of everything else that he again nodded his head on his answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh man. I&#39;ve most of really hit my head out harder then I thought. still, if you&#39;re going to be her just as I live here that do you sleep? even if you stay here, where are you going to stay? if anyone comes over and sees you for this is really an important question as they&#39;ll want to start asking questions about you, things like who&#39;s under all this latex and most of the things I&#39;ve already asked that how are you going to answer them all back?&quot; starting to figure things out on your own now as these questions were beginning to be help solve thing that a part of you wanted him to stay here and serve not just you, but also your family house hold while wanting to know on those who see him will react.<br />
<br />
wanting to keep him safe as you felt like you didn&#39;t want him to be taken away from you that you seen his paw like hand rubbing the side of his arm, hearing the latex squeaking against latex while starting to like your former friend being this rubberized lion. &quot;ah well, I was thinking of staying here with you master for I do sleep like anyone else. yet should anyone ask me this, i&#39;ll just tell them its only a costume that I&#39;ve found in a yard sale and wanted to wear it more then ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
seeing as he looked like he was blushing is when you thought that this was enough questions for as there will be other times to ask questions later. deciding to head other to your closet, you soon pulled out what appeared to be your former friend&#39;s cosplay outfit that after adjusting it to fit over the latex lion man for this included a hole for his tail as it took about 15 minutes to do is where it was then ready for him to wear while laying it out and onto your bed. looking down at it for he was surprised to see the suit in front of him, then looking a bit puzzled at you that he had thoughts of serving you while in a pair of underwear sounded strange to those who would seeing working in the house as he would be under the masters care. &quot;sure, how did you know that I wanted to be your butler?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you want the job right now for apart of him that&#39;s wanting to play the role of being the house butler is now strongly inside of you as it won&#39;t fade away. however, don&#39;t you care of serving your master for you&#39;ll only be just wearing a pair of underwear while showing off your squeaky rubberized body that you&#39;ll also be at work? if you do care about how people want to see be dressed, then you must put it on for no one is forcing you to wear it.&quot; you said to him.<br />
<br />
you weren&#39;t sure if he was blushing for being latex, but if he was that his face would be flushing red by now as he looked away from you and at the suit on your bed. &quot;I do care about being modest and dressed around others for if that is what you wish, then i&#39;ll get dress as i&#39;ll later buy my butler outfits. if i&#39;m going to start my service to my master that i&#39;ll have to change my outfit from time to time as I can&#39;t stay in one pair of uniform forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
seeing as he made a good point on this discussion that you agreed to let him use your friend&#39;s money and let him buy out what butler outfits he wants when he goes out, after he gets dressed first. you didn&#39;t want him going out naked and having him getting himself into trouble while also for being in just underwear. &quot;just don&#39;t leave the house without telling me, TJ.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;TJ?&quot; the latex lion asked as he was just about to slip his left leg into a pair of pants while already having his right just around his ankle. questing you as to why he was just called by this name.<br />
<br />
&quot;well you did say that you don&#39;t have a name as oy yet, right? so I simply gave you one for it was my friend&#39;s nick name we use to call him, my friend that you took over.&quot; you said as he struggled to get his black pants around his rubberized waist, but with some effort while positioning his tail around a bit that he soon had it strapped on for he shortly after wards zipped his fly of the pants up.<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah, I guess you got a good point there. having you calling me by those names like it, lion man, a thing, and more dose sound like mean names to say as i&#39;ll be someone without a name to serve you master. he said for he soon was wearing a white slaved shirt while tucking it into his tight black pants that over it was a black butler uniform with a purplish necktie as he now looked like a humanoid latex lion man in a butler suit who&#39;s ready to serve its master while waiting on his first commands.<br />
<br />
&quot;now then, TJ. you may see me as your master now while being my butler, but you&#39;ll also be serving our family&#39;s household that this is your job which to this day forward. should any danger comes to harm to the master&#39;s well being that it&#39;s your job to protect and keep the master safe from immediate dangerous threats, sort of like a guardian knight who&#39;s defending the king of his castle.&quot; you began to say to this latex lion butler that was in your room now, unaware he was in a hypnotic hypnoses for he was in a trans.<br />
<br />
&quot;also, if you&#39;re contagious and infect people into living latex as your basically a suit yourself that i&#39;m gonna have to forbid you from turning them into latex. however, should you not be infectve to people that you&#39;ll be ok on making contact with others. even if you are partially a lion that under no circumstances is where you are not aloud to go around on a wild beast hunt and lose control over of yourself, even if it is to be from beastly instincts. until more household members are ready to come to serve me as their master while knowing who to serve for, your the only servant for me that you&#39;ll one day be a seiner butler to all of your fellow maidens and to your butler brethren for they&#39;ll be your under house care takers. still, no matter what the master&#39;s command is for it may or may not be something you feel like doing that like it or not, you got to do it and follow the commands of your master. now, did you get what i&#39;m saying while also understand what your commands are?&quot; you finish saying to him as he was then out of his trans for he nodded while saying that he understood what his orders were.<br />
<br />
once he knew this was out of the way and off of his chest, knowing that he won&#39;t disobey your orders on attacking people and causing them to become rubberized is when you realized something very importent. with him here? not knowing what&#39;s gonna happen to you on the next day for you had a whole day ahead of you tomorrow as he was going to be here too that you didn&#39;t bother about it right now while feeling to tiered from the day you had already, but you took him to what was going to be his future bed room. once there as you told him this was going to be his bedroom from now on that nearly feeling half asleep already, he escorted you back to your room and tucked you too bed while turning off your room lights before leaving out.<br />
<br />
it wasn&#39;t long after as he also took your former friend&#39;s clothes out from your room that he simply took them to his newly own room and set them all into a laundry basket to be washed later. he was starting to undress himself as TJ was talking to himself, about what kind of master you are. even if he was your butler now that they were kind words about you, compared to his other master he once served.<br />
<br />
&quot;this is so nice of master to do for me as to give me a place to stay, a name, even allowing me to be his butler like I&#39;ve wanted to be. however, i&#39;ll need to get up bright and early enough tomorrow morning before my master wakes up as i&#39;ll also be the one to serve him his breakfast before his day starts. still, not attacking humans is going to be had task to do as one of his friends is deeply now inside of me, but if my master is in danger that it&#39;s my job to protect him from them. commanding me not to infect them with latex is going to be a lot harder for me to do as i&#39;m mostly a rubberized lion that&#39;s made of rubber, but i&#39;ll do what I can and not to turn them into those latex thing. master, as your butler that I promise to do what I can to mostly be by your side.&quot;<br />
<br />
once he was mostly out of his clothes as he was only in his underwear while setting his uniform on his dresser self, neatly folded that by turning off his own room lights is when he squeaked his way over to bed. it was strange for he was a latex anthro lion as he was tucking himself to bed, yet his last master he served under wouldn&#39;t let him sleep on the job that to him was the most happiest feeling he&#39;d ever felt that he quickly fell asleep with a goodnight saying to his master. &quot;(yawn) goodnight master. sleep tight, and i&#39;ll see you in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
(this is where you decide what goes on during the night outside, or even the next morning. feel free to add your own line up story ideas as there are a few listed down below for anything could happen at this point that your new latex lion butler will handle the dangers now, but he won&#39;t take care of all of them by himself alone. again, thank you and happy reading.)</p>
