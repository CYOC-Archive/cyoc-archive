<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You had entered the zoo just before closing time, when all the main lights shut off. The sound of a huge gate closed as only a few lights stayed on. &quot;Oh no, I must have got locked in.&quot; you thought.  You continued walking along the park, seeing all the animals with dim lights. You heard a loud neigh and ran to the sound. A lone brown male horse with beige spots on his butt walked around his enclosed area, you thought nothing of him and moved along, until you heard a voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please come back!&quot; said the horse. You turned your head back to the horse and approached the fence, the horse seemed bigger and muscular than any other horse you&#39;ve seen before, even his testicles were almost the size of basketballs. &quot;Was that you? did you just talk?&quot; you asked with your mind shook. &quot;Yes I can, and let me tell you, there&#39;s a fucked up reason why I can.&quot; the horse said as he lowered his voice. &quot;There&#39;s a massive undercover operation going on, and this zoo is being used by the top scientists to conduct a horrible experiment. You see, half the animals here, weren&#39;t born as animals.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; You asked, perplexed by the answer. He huffed, &quot;What I&#39;m saying is, half the animals here were humans before being turned into wild animals by freak-o scientists.&quot; he said, pacing around the fence as he continued &quot;It started off as an experiment to convert humans to cows, so they could generate more food for the world. It was a huge success, they got their IQ&#39;s lowered so much, all they can think about is eating, shitting, breeding, and being milked. Now these same people are trying to get the operation worldwide, experimenting on every single type of animal, making world hunger a non-issue, but turning humans to cattle in the process.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s really twisted. So you must be one of their experiments too?&quot; You asked again, rubbing your cold hands. &quot;I was one of the top scientists, John Metway. Since nobody wanted to be an animal, they chose a name at random. That&#39;s why I&#39;m in this hunky horse body, and thankfully I was never given my animal brain degradation shot.&quot; he snorted. &quot;Come on, I&#39;ll let you out.&quot; You cracked the fence door open as he slowly galloped out the gate. When he was out, he lifted his tail, a hot torrent of manure came out his ass, and a puddle of urine coated the floor. He sighed a breath of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is your problem?&quot; you yelled. &quot;Give me break, I&#39;m a horse, I can&#39;t control it. You expect me to to shit on a toilet and wipe my ass too?&quot; John snuffled. Point made, I guess. &quot;Now then, get on my back, I&#39;ll show you the testing lab.&quot; He let you climb atop him, and dashed like a true steed across the zoo. You reached a bush that was oddly placed. &quot;New Zoo Order&quot; John said slowly, and the bush moved to show a hidden staircase.<br />
<br />
 You both entered the room, to see it was filled with animals locked up in metal stables, and vaccines filled with the transformation serum. &quot;Help me revert these guys back, press the buttons in this sequence:&quot; He pointed his soft muzzle towards the buttons in an order, and you pressed them for him. The machine dinged, and the animals reverted back to naked humans, running in a giant pack up the stairs screaming and crying. John froze as a loud alarm started blaring in the distance. &quot;Quick, tip over those shelves, now!&quot; <br />
<br />
You pushed the shelving with all your muscles, making the vaccines shatter and seep into the drain. John stomped on the vaccines with his hooves, when a piece of glass got into his leg. He jerked in pain, his ass slapping you to the floor, falling on an opened vaccine.<br />
&quot;Stop! stop right now!&quot; guards yelled at the horde of running humans. &quot;We gotta get you out of here, before they find us.&quot; You climbed atop of him again, feeling woozy and loosing sight. You could feel changes in your chest and back,  but you tried to ignore it. John blazed out the stairway, running through the zoo. Guards stood on roofs with tranquilizers trying to get a shot at John, but he slalomed through them all. You heard gunshots as John escaped into the woods, waiting for a spotlight helicopter to go away. You fainted, slipping off his back onto the grassy floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...um, you alive? Please be alive...&quot; John whispered as you regained conscience. Your body felt insanely different, there was now a big weight on your chest, your golden hair went down to your nipples, your torso felt heavy, and there was a clear dismissal of your penis and testicles. You lifted yourself up slowly with your 4 legs, and looked at your new light brown fur body. It was clear now, that you have become a female centaur. &quot;You&#39;re... you&#39;re beautiful.&quot; John remarked. he circled your body, paying attention to your new rear. &quot;Nice equipment...&quot; he chuckled, getting his sniffing nose close to your twitching vagina and puckered anus. He got one lick in before you tried to kick him with your hoof, making him snap out of out of his hornyness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I a centaur? you growled, in your new feminine voice. &quot;Maybe its a flaw in the serum, when you passed out, it worked halfway?&quot; John said. &quot;Doesn&#39;t answer why I&#39;m female, though.&quot; You doted. &quot;Obviously you need two animals to breed, you fell on a female serum. And oh boy, does it show...&quot; You looked over to him to see his long hard cock hitting his belly as he huffed. &quot;Ew, put your dick away, John.&quot; He looked downwards, his cock slowly returning to his sheath. &quot;Listen, I did some searching around, and I found a barn owned by one of my friends. He will keep us undercover for the rest of our lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... I wanna be a human again.&quot; you said in protest.  &quot;We can&#39;t go back, or they&#39;ll shoot us dead. To them we are private information that they cannot afford to go public, understand?&quot; John explained. You started to cry a little, thinking about how you&#39;ve left your old life behind. &quot;Ok, fine. Lets just go to this stinking barn already, I&#39;m cold.&quot; You began a trek to the barn, side by side. John would often fall behind slightly just so he could catch a glimpse of your big cheeks. He played around and joked with you, and by half an hour later, you made it.<br />
You approached the house next to the barn for a bearded man to come out the door. &quot;John its you! and.... why, this must be that hero you told me about! Nice to meet you, I&#39;m Red, and this is my lovely family.&quot; He said, presenting his wife and kids. You quickly covered your bare breasts in front of them as they giggled. &quot;Haha, yeah. We&#39;ll talk about it all tomorrow, ok? This little lady is tired.&quot; John slurred. &quot;Okay then, have a goodnight!&quot; Red and his family waved as you both went into the barn, and laid in one of the stalls.</p>
