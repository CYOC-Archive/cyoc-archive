<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
I opened my eyes, and found Rory Gilmore leaning over me. Rory Gilmore looking beautiful and concerned. Rory Gilmore with those incredibly bright blue eyes and the little dimple in her chin. Rory Gilmore with a long sweep of heavy, straight brown hair spilling past her shoulders as she leaned over me. She looked just like she did on TV, except I didn’t remember Rory Gilmore ever wearing such a load of messy black eye makeup.<br />
<br />
“You okay in there?” she asked in a sweet Rory Gilmore voice.<br />
<br />
I nodded and tried to sit up. “Katie? Is that...” I stopped and raised a hand to my throat. My voice was wrong. I mean, it had been wrong before, but this wasn’t the Cady Heron purr I’d almost gotten used to.  I held up my hand and looked at it. My arm was not covered in all those freckles that had come with looking like America’s favorite bad girl, but it sure wasn’t the hand I normally wore. It was thin, with long slender fingers, a definite female hand. I reached up beside my head and pulled around a handful of thick brunette hair. “Are we both Rory?”<br />
<br />
“Not exactly,” said Katie. She reached down and helped me to my feet.  Immediately I could tell that a lot more had changed than just freckles. I stood up. And up. This body was clearly much taller than the one I’d just left, and almost all of the difference seemed to be in the long legs that emerged from the bottom of my T-shirt. It was also clear that the shirt wasn’t nearly as strained by what was now sitting on my chest. I still had boobs—I could still feel them doing that jiggle, bounce, sway at every step—but they were a lot less hefty than they had been.<br />
<br />
One step at a time, I followed Katie down the hall back to the bathroom mirror. From the way everything looked, I wasn’t really super tall, probably no taller than normal, but somehow I felt like a giant. I seemed to be wired together differently. My proportions felt all wrong.  My legs seemed so long that it felt like they came up to my shoulders.  I felt unsteady, like I was walking on stilts. Even before we stepped in front of the mirror, I had a good idea what I was going to see.<br />
<br />
“Shit,” I said, studying my new face. “I’m old.”<br />
<br />
Katie rolled her new blue-blue eyes. “Just because you spent time being Lohan, don’t go all Freaky Friday. You’re like, thirty-three.”<br />
<br />
“That’s old.”<br />
<br />
Katie laughed. “You’re not old.” Her fingers brushed through the tangled brown curls of my hair. “You’re one of the most beautiful women on the planet.”<br />
<br />
I raised a hand and traced a finger along my face. Eyes almost as blue as the ones that Katie was now using sat above my high cheekbones.  About the only sign of age on my face was a pair of faint lines that curved down from each side of my nose. There was a slight upward twist at the end of my lips that made my expression seem a lot more confident and knowing than I felt. I was no longer a teen hottie. I was an adult woman. I was Lorelei Gilmore. “I’m your mom.”<br />
<br />
Katie gave a snort. She snuggled up against me from behind, throwing smooth, pale arms around me. “Oh mommy, you’re so pretty!”<br />
<br />
I shivered. “Please don’t call me that.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you love me, mommy?” Katie looked past me into the mirror. “God, look at us.” She flashed a smile. “We’re fucking gorgeous!”<br />
<br />
I reached up and poked a finger through the T-shirt into a much smaller boob than the ones I’d had has Cady. The woman in the mirror seemed almost amused by this situation, but that wasn’t what I was feeling.  “What are we going to do now?<br />
<br />
My sister might have Rory Gilmore’s face, but in her case the expression was one hundred percent Katie. “Let’s go somewhere!”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“I mean it.” She stepped around me, still admiring herself in the mirror. “Let’s get out of the house and have some fun with this.” <br />
<br />
She twisted around and looked over her shoulder into the mirror. “Jesus. My ass is like huge.”<br />
<br />
Her ass was also naked. So was the rest of her. You want to know how you tell you’re in shock? It’s when you’ve standing in a room with one of your dream girls, and she’s wearing nothing but a pair of striped socks, and it takes you five minutes just to realize it.<br />
<br />
“You’re so beautiful,” I said. My voice sounded weird.<br />
<br />
“Aww. Thank you, mommy.” Katie turned around again, pressing Rory’s little breasts upwards with her hands. “These are smaller than my original equipment, but they’re nice. Don’t you think?”<br />
<br />
“Uh... Yeah. They’re, um, nice.” A tingle went through my own boobs. I could feel the nipples tightening against the cotton shirt. That weird, warm sensation started up from somewhere between my legs.<br />
<br />
Katie suddenly ran out of the room, giving me one last flash of Rory’s smooth behind as she went out the door. I stood there for a second, breathing hard, staring into those blue eyes in the mirror. I put a finger over the tented material of my shirt and lightly pressed down.  The lips in the mirror opened in an ‘O’ of surprise. I couldn’t do this. This wasn’t me. Couldn’t be me.<br />
<br />
“I’m a MILF.” I whispered. I turned, looking at the way the T-shirt wasn’t quite long enough to reach the bottom of my ass. This was so different from being in Cady Heron’s sex bomb bod. I was older, taller, thinner. I had to admit that, watching the show on TV, I’d thought Lorelei was kind of sexy. You know, for someone that age. But seeing that face look back at me from the mirror, I didn’t feel sexy. I felt... lost.<br />
<br />
Dark brown hair spilled across one side of my face and I pushed it back. Bright eyes sparkled back at me from the knowing face. I thought for a second about what it would be like if I was stuck in this body. I was too old to go back to school. Unless I was the teacher. Only, I didn’t have a degree, or any kind of proof of who I was. I stepped closer to the glass. Could I go out and get a job like this? Would some guy want to hire me just because he wanted to bang me?<br />
<br />
Before that weird thought could sink in, Katie popped back in the door.  “Try this,” she said, holding out a blue-green something on a white plastic hanger.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t until I took it from her and turned it around, that I realized what I was holding. “Katie, this is a dress.”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh.” She pulled a tight black tank top down over her breasts and glanced at herself in the mirror. “You’re too tall for anything of mine and too skinny for most of mom’s stuff. That dress is from the when-I-lose-some-weight end of mom’s closet. I think you can pull it off.” She gave her own bare ass a slap. “I need to see what I’ve got that’ll get over these hips.” She slipped out of the room again.<br />
<br />
I hung the dress from a towel rack and turned back to the mirror.  Lorelei was looking at me with that smug expression. There was something about this face that said this woman wasn’t just good looking, she knew she was good looking. Knew exactly what every guy who saw her was thinking. Knew she had power over them. Only I felt absolutely disconnected from that face, that expression, and that power.<br />
<br />
“So let’s see the rest,” I said. Then I pulled off the T-shirt. The body underneath was a lot less curvy than Cady’s. Narrower hips. Much smaller boobs. It wasn’t my idea of a killer bod, but it was lean, toned, and I had to admit, pretty damn sexy.<br />
<br />
I shivered. “I can’t stay in here,” I said, watching the nude woman in the mirror mimic my words. The nipples on the smallish boobs had tightened into weird little red-brown knobs. No matter how I was feeling, Lorelei still didn’t quite lose that knowing smirk.<br />
<br />
I barely managed to cover myself as Katie charged back into the room.  She’d pulled Rory’s long, straight brown hair back into a loose ponytail and her famous ass was barely covered by a denim skirt originally meant for Katie’s little gymnast bubble butt. <br />
<br />
Somewhere along The way she’d taken time to wipe off her usual pile of mascara and eyeliner, so she looked a lot more like Rory and less like Rory’s evil twin.<br />
<br />
She grabbed the dress from the hanger and wiggled it at me. “Here,” she said. “Stop slobbering over yourself and put this on.”<br />
I took the bit of cloth from her fingers and looked at it. “It’s a dress,” I repeated.<br />
<br />
“I know.”<br />
<br />
“A dress.”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh.”<br />
<br />
I wrinkled up my nose and shook my head, dark curls batting against my cheeks. “I can’t wear a dress.”<br />
<br />
“Why not?” Katie looked me up and down. “It’ll look good on you.”<br />
<br />
I started to say more, but I could see the grin twitching at the corners of Katie’s lips. “What are you up to?”<br />
<br />
She looked into the mirror, turning her head from side to side so that they long ponytail swung heavily against her shoulders. “I told you,” she said, giving the mirror a deceptively sweet smile. “We’re going to give someone a shock.”<br />
<br />
I shook my head, squinting at my blue-eyed reflection. “I’m not letting anyone see me like this.”<br />
<br />
“It’ll be fun.”<br />
<br />
“It’ll be embarrassing,” I said.<br />
<br />
Katie gave me a considering look. She stepped toward me, took my right hand in hers, and lifted it up to the thin material over her left breast. “Hi there,” she said Rory’s sweetest, softest voice.<br />
<br />
A shiver ran up my long legs and along my back. “Katie...<br />
<br />
“Shh. My name is Rory.” She leaned in close, her lips so close to mine that I could feel puffs of breath when she spoke. “Your name is Lorelei.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not...”<br />
<br />
“Say it,” she insisted, her lips just brushing past mine. Her breast flattened against my fingers as she leaned in, and I could feel the warmth of her body.<br />
<br />
“I’m Lorelei,” I said.<br />
<br />
She pulled me in, pushing her lips hard against mine. Her arms went around me, her fingers sliding over the smooth skin of my back. “Yes, you are,” she said. “And if you come with me, I’m going to let you drive my car, drink some beer, and fuck Rory Gilmore.” Her hands slid down my back and fingers gripped my ass. “Would you like that, Lorelei?”</p>
