<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty thought about it a minute more, then nodded.<br />
<br />
It was Rhea&#39;s room they went to, for the harem chief knew that Ty&#39;s bed was sodden with her heat. Despite the head concubine&#39;s status within the Palace, her room was not much grander than Ty&#39;s. If it had more furnishings that was because she had lived there longer.<br />
<br />
Rhea sat Ty down on the bed beside her, holding her close with an arm around her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, tell me, dear sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
For several minutes Ty said nothing. She continued to simply lean against Rhea, thankful for the warmth and the companionship. Also she needed to recompose her thoughts after the interruption. When she finally spoke, it was to ask a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luma said you came to her willingly. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rhea smiled, knowing why Ty asked her that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it was better than anything else I could have done.&quot; She took a moment, collecting her own memories and feelings. &quot;On Earth, as Mistress said, I was a waitress. Working hard in an &#39;honest job&#39; to pay off a college education I had never really wanted. A friend suggested roleplaying as a way to relieve stress. The Game of Change was to be my first campaign. Obviously,&quot; she laughed softly, &quot;it was my last.<br />
<br />
&quot;In order to try something &#39;different&#39; from what I knew, I chose to be an Elven fighter. But I soon found I had no taste for fighting, and defaulted back to my old profession -- becoming a barmaid in Celephais. There I learned of the slave trade, and the Pleasure Palace. I was scornful, at first, even as I envied the stories of the beautiful women here. Scorn born of fear. But -- even in Celephais barmaids usually offer certain other services, and after a few months I realised how silly I was being for denying myself the extra income. Sex is, after all, a natural part of life. Not something to feel shame or fear over.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t long after that I came to Dylath, and the Pleasure Palace. Here, I knew, whores were truly appreciated. And I had grown wise enough to realise that a collar around the neck was no more a sign of disgrace than my diploma. Luma was far more worthy of service -- and far more rewarding to serve -- than the professors at my university.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.&quot; Ty could certainly agree with that. &quot;But... you weren&#39;t a slave. How could you give up your freedom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t I already a slave, though? We all have masters, Ty -- if I may call you that?&quot; Ty nodded, and Rhea continued. &quot;At home, you answer to your parents; at school, to your teachers; at work, to your boss. And there is not one boss in a thousand who cares as much about his employees as Mistress does her slaves, even those most demeaned by the world&#39;s standards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty hesitated a moment, then decided it didn&#39;t matter -- she might as well trust Rhea&#39;s assurance that she could speak her mind. &quot;But you know that you only think she loves you because of the collars, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another gentle laugh. &quot;Oh, of course; Mistress told us as she told you. But what is not to love? Mistress is beautiful; she gives us everything we could ever want. Certainly, we serve her. She &#39;uses&#39; us as the world says. And some of the slaves here, like Kitty, serve in very humiliating ways -- as the world sees it. But tell me, do you think Kitty is unhappy? -- apart from the lingering hangups of his paladin morals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... he doesn&#39;t <i>seem</i> unhappy... But isn&#39;t that only because his... his mind has been warped?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe. But have you ever thought that maybe his mind was warped before, and Mistress Luma actually has given him a way to heal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rhea stood up, and offered her hand to Ty. Ty let her help her up from the bed, curious. Slowly Rhea drew the junior Kitsune towards the full-length mirror that was a feature in every room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luma&#39;s mind-affecting magic is very limited. Even the Master of Slaves builds upon what is already present in a person&#39;s soul. Besides...&quot; She paused as they reached the mirror. Placing Ty in front of it, she drew off to the side, so that Ty alone was reflected in the polished surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I say anything else, tell me: what do you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... a vixen.&quot; Ty&#39;s voice lowered. &quot;A very beautiful... busty... red-furred vixen. Her fur matted with sexual fluids... because she&#39;s a slut. A whore. A slave for someone else&#39;s pleasure.&quot; She looked over at Rhea, tears stinging her eyes. &quot;But this isn&#39;t who I am -- who I was meant to be!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What would you rather be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty opened her mouth. And realised she had nothing to say. &quot;I...&quot; Seriously. She could not think of anything else. &quot;I don&#39;t know... but... not a slave?&quot; Once again, she reached up and touched her collar. But her mind recoiled at the thought of removing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she sobbed. &quot;I... I was a hero...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my dear...&quot; Rhea came to her, and again held her close with an arm around her shoulder. &quot;Dear, sweet Tyana. Why don&#39;t you tell me <i>your</i> story?&quot;<br />
<br />
So she did. In the process she completely broke down, and Rhea held her close in her arms, her tails brushing softly over Ty&#39;s. The new vixen&#39;s tears ran down her muzzle and onto Rhea&#39;s shoulder. But, in between her sobs, she got out the whole story -- with more detail than she thought she remembered.<br />
<br />
Finally she finished. Rhea continued to hold her and pet her, letting Ty weep into her fur. And when Ty began to quiet down, she licked the top of her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel now, Tyana?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don&#39;t know.&quot; She sniffed. &quot;Better... I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm. It&#39;s okay.&quot; Rhea nuzzled her. &quot;You&#39;ve been through an awful lot, and done far better than anyone would have expected. You have much to be proud of. That is why Mistress Luma chose you -- as you said, she values people like you. Like us. And believe me: nothing should make you prouder than the pleasure you gave her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty looked up at her, blinking away the traces of her tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being a whore means giving happiness and comfort to people, and there is nothing better in life than that. It&#39;s hard work, and sometimes thankless. But Mistress Luma values us. That&#39;s why we&#39;re proud to wear her collars. The enchantment? Really, it&#39;s just there to help us accept the truth more quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
She lifted a hand, brushing her fingers against Ty&#39;s tear-stained jaws. &quot;No matter &#39;who&#39; or &#39;what&#39; you are, Ty, what really matters is that you love yourself and are happy. If servicing Mistress Luma and dancing for her customers makes you happy, embrace it. There&#39;s no use questioning the &#39;why&#39; -- happiness is happiness. Heaven has nothing more to offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gently she turned Ty to face the mirror again. &quot;Now let me tell you what I see. A beautiful vixen, voluptuous, free of the world&#39;s petty morality. Her loins hot with the desire for life, to take and nurture a male&#39;s seed and bring more beauty into the world. Her fur coated in the marks of her sisters&#39; affection. And the golden sign of belonging to our family around her neck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty inhaled. &quot;Ohh, Rhea...&quot; She nuzzled into the side of Rhea&#39;s motherly breast. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re very welcome, dear Ty. Why don&#39;t you take another look yourself? Maybe you&#39;ll see her too.&quot; She gave Ty a squeeze, then stepped back, once more leaving Ty&#39;s reflection alone in the glass.<br />
<br />
Ty looked. The vixen looked back. <i>&quot;Beautiful...&quot;</i> Ty ran her hands over her body again, more slowly, feeling her soft fur against her delicate pads. Savouring every curve. <i>&quot;Voluptuous...&quot;</i> Yes! She felt it. Lovely. Beautiful. Powerful, even; knowing that she could get men and even women to do as she wanted with this body. Even the matted fur, while a bit of a blemish, no longer made her feel ashamed. Rhea&#39;s words resonated with her, making far more sense than her scruples about being used.<br />
<br />
She put her hands on her hips, swaying them gently. Watched her tail wag behind her. She smiled a little bit.<br />
<br />
And the vixen smiled back. <br />
<br />
&quot;I do see her, sister,&quot; she murmured, feeling over her delectable body afresh before resting her hands atop her breasts, imagining showing them off to adoring men. <i>Yes.</i> Whatever else, Ty decided, she wanted to remain both fox and female. &quot;Thank you again. So much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just happy I could give you some peace, dear one. And now, how about some more sleep? There are still a couple of hours before Luma wants you. Of course, you&#39;ll miss breakfast; but you can eat your fill later, and I think you need rest more right now. But, it is your choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty considered.</p>
