<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cole and her mentor (she really didn&#39;t like to think of Lee as her “owner”) sat in the ice cream parlor.  Lee was slowly savoring her milk shake, while Cole was happily devouring her sundae.  She was quickly starting to like being a big eater, as it had awakened a real love for food- though as opposed to Lee, who desired to prolong the experience, Cole just wanted -more-.<br />
<br />
After finishing her sundae, she went up and got a small shake of her own, as Lee was still only halfway done.  Cole noticed several men (and a few women) were staring at Lee.  Not only was she probably the prettiest girl they had ever seen in the flesh, the sensual way she enjoyed her shake was probably raising body temperatures in the vicinity.<br />
<br />
Cole just smiled to herself, knowing Lee likely had no interest (or even awareness of) in any of her admirers.<br />
<br />
Just then, the door opened, and Luke walked into the ice cream parlor with his younger sister, Alison.  Luke was easily one of the most handsome boys at her school, and even more than that, he was kind, gentle, and quick to pound any bullies he saw flat.<br />
<br />
He and his sister were very good-looking, with blonde hair and blue eyes.  Alison was still in middle school, but she was probably already leaving a trail of broken hearts in their wake.<br />
<br />
Cole wanted to say hi, as Luke was in her class, but then remembered she had been transformed.  She sighed instead.<br />
<br />
Lee opened one eye, as they had both been closed while she was slowly draining the life out of her shake.  She then scanned the room, then looked back to Cole.<br />
<br />
“You like that boy.”<br />
<br />
Cole shrugged.  “I mean.  As much as I can like any boy.”<br />
<br />
“You would like that boy more if he were a girl.”  Lee pressed.<br />
<br />
Cole looked down.  “Yes.”<br />
<br />
“Seeing that other girl, no doubt his sister, it&#39;s easy to imagine what he would look like as a girl.  You&#39;ve fantasized about this.  Quite a lot.”<br />
<br />
Cole just nodded.<br />
<br />
“But you would want him to choose, not curse him.”<br />
<br />
“I mean...how do I put this.  In my fantasies, yeah, it just happens and he&#39;s confused and distraught, and I...uh...take advantage of that.”  Cole blushed.  “But that...wouldn&#39;t be the kind of relationship I&#39;d want.  Not really.”<br />
<br />
“Humans are such complex creatures.  Never happy with anything.  You could take what you want with ease, but you&#39;d want more.”  Lee didn&#39;t sound like she was being judgmental, however, just stating facts.  “What if you could prime the pump, so to speak?”<br />
<br />
Cole blinked.  “Uh, I&#39;m listening.”<br />
<br />
“Just a moment.”  Lee got up and walked to the counter, standing behind Luke and Ali.  Alison turned and looked up at the taller girl.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow.  Sorry, it&#39;s just, you&#39;re really pretty!”<br />
<br />
Lee smiled.  “Thank you!  I was just noticing you and your...brother, I&#39;m guessing...are quite attractive as well.  I&#39;m Lee.  I just moved here.”<br />
<br />
Luke turned and smiled  “Oh, good to meet you.  I&#39;m Luke, and my spoiled princess of a sister is Alison.”<br />
<br />
“Hey!  I&#39;m not spoiled!”  Ali glared up at her brother, who was quite a bit taller than he was.  <br />
<br />
“But you are a princess, then?”  Lee grinned.<br />
<br />
Luke laughed.  “Heck yeah she is.”<br />
<br />
“I like princesses, so that&#39;s fine.”<br />
<br />
Alison seemed confused, as if she thought Lee was insulting her in some way, but Lee&#39;s smile was so sincere, it had to be a compliment, right?  “Oh, well...I guess I can be a princess then.”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t let her cuteness fool you, she&#39;s a total tomboy.  I call her princess to tease her, but she&#39;d much rather be fighting monsters than needing to be rescued.”  Luke explained.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t see why being a princess means you can&#39;t fight monsters.  Or that you would need to be rescued.  Alison looks like she would just rescue herself instead of waiting around for a hero.”  Lee said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah!  That&#39;s right!  So take that, Luke!  I&#39;m a badass princess!”<br />
<br />
“Oh man, look what you started.”  Luke laughed.  “So will you be going to school here?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, that&#39;s right, I start Monday.”<br />
<br />
“Hey that&#39;s great, well I hope to see you around school then.  If you need any help settling in, just find me.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s a wonderful offer, thank you.”  <br />
<br />
“I wish you went to my school.”  Alison said.  “I&#39;d love to have a friend like you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh dear, who says you can&#39;t?  I&#39;d be happy to be your friend.” <br />
<br />
“Really?  I mean, you&#39;d want to hang out with a kid?”  If the younger girl&#39;s eyes started sparkling or had hearts appear in them, Cole wouldn&#39;t be surprised.<br />
<br />
“Oh don&#39;t be silly, I&#39;m only 17, so that means I&#39;m a kid too.”  She winked.  “Here, I&#39;ll give you my number, you can call anytime.”  Lee produced a cell phone that Cole knew she didn&#39;t have before.<br />
<br />
They chatted for a few minutes more after making their orders.  Lee ended up with Luke&#39;s number as well, and while no one else noticed, when Luke and Alison moved to their tables, Lee snagged a few hairs from both of them.  She then returned to Cole.<br />
<br />
“Such nice young people.”  Lee commented.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, almost too good to be true.  I think Alison has a crush on you.”  <br />
<br />
“Still waters often run deep”, the devil commented.  “And yes, I noticed that.  That&#39;s why I decided to befriend her.  I&#39;m intrigued.”<br />
<br />
“So what spell are you going to cast?  I noticed you took hairs from Alison as well.”<br />
<br />
“Oneiromancy.”  The devil commented, finishing up her first shake (rather quickly, to Cole&#39;s surprise) before starting on the new one.  “Dream viewing, to be precise.  You and I are going to invade their dreams tonight, and see what&#39;s going on in their subconscious minds.  Then, depending on what we find, I plan on planting a seed inside the young man&#39;s mind.”<br />
<br />
“A seed?”  Cole frowned.<br />
<br />
“The seed of a fantasy, yes.  About being transformed into a woman.  Who knows, maybe it will take root?  If so, you might get what you want.  It&#39;s not mind control or even manipulation- a seed cannot grow if there is nothing to sustain it.”<br />
<br />
“Huh.  You really -can- do anything, can&#39;t you?  Why aren&#39;t you a King of Hell?”<br />
<br />
“Oh my, that is a long story.  I&#39;ll tell it to you, if you want, but ask me again later.”  Lee deflected.<br />
<br />
Cole noticed, but didn&#39;t press the issue.  She just enjoyed her shake.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cole stared out the window on the drive home.  Was invading someone&#39;s dreams the ultimate invasion of privacy?  Did she want to fulfill her fetish that badly?  What was she even doing?  She&#39;d sold her soul and summoned a beautiful demon who considered her a pet, of all things.<br />
<br />
And thinking about that morning, the sex...and other things...she shivered thinking about it.  Maybe she should just cut her losses and resign herself to being a pet.  Maybe she&#39;d be better off...<br />
<br />
“Penny for your thoughts, my dear?”<br />
<br />
Cole sighed.  “Just wondering what it is I really want.  It&#39;s like you said, no matter how good I have it, I want more.  But right now, I have it pretty good.”<br />
<br />
“You think so?”<br />
<br />
Cole turned to look at Lee.  “Yeah.  Just in a few days, you&#39;ve shown me things I can barely believe.  Even if I&#39;m only your pet...I think I could be happy with that life.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, Cole...you say that now, but devils are fickle.  What would you do when I got tired of you, and found a new interest?  Like that Alison girl?”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t feel jealous about that or anything.  But I guess it would suck if you got bored of me.”<br />
<br />
Reaching out with one hand, Lee stroked Cole&#39;s hair.  “Are you saying you&#39;re in love with me?”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite that.  But being with you makes me feel...content.  Is it really worth it to strive for more than that, when I could have this?”<br />
<br />
“Well no one can really answer that.  Maybe a demon who can look into the future, like Paimon could.  But I do know about love, and you are starting to grow attached to me.  I&#39;m currently fond of you, but that could change.  I&#39;ve lived for a very long time, you know.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.  I must be like a zygote to you.”<br />
<br />
Lee chuckled.  “Well you&#39;re a very interesting zygote if so.  The truth is, you&#39;re not a new soul.  You&#39;ve lived before, so it&#39;s not quite as bad as you think.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s kind of worse, isn&#39;t it?  My soul has been to Heaven, even if I don&#39;t remember it...but now I&#39;m going to Hell.”  Cole sighed.  “I&#39;m really fucked up, aren&#39;t I?”<br />
<br />
In response, Lee pulled the car over onto a side street and parked.  She turned to face Cole.  “Come here.”<br />
<br />
Cole shivered, but unbuckled her seatbelt and moved closer to the devil.  Lee pulled her into a tight embrace, and Cole felt herself shrink in the demon&#39;s arms, until she was no bigger than a child (or maybe she was a child?  At this moment, she couldn&#39;t be sure).<br />
<br />
“Now.  Listen to me well, apprentice.  &#39;Pet&#39; is only one step on the path laid out before you.  You can advance further, and I have high expectations for you.  Remember our agreement- if you fail to meet my standards when the year and a day is up, I&#39;ll leave you.  Do you want that?”<br />
<br />
“No.”  Her voice was higher pitched, but was that because of youth or just being smaller?<br />
<br />
“Of course you don&#39;t.  I&#39;m the best thing that&#39;s ever happened to you.”  Lee planted a kiss on the top of Cole&#39;s head.  “Yes, your soul has been to Heaven and experienced all it&#39;s delights.  Yet finding itself incarnated into a new life, you were filled with deep longing.  Something was missing, and even patiently striving for Heaven&#39;s rewards didn&#39;t fill that void.  You crave power, knowledge, and forbidden desires.<br />
<br />
As for whether or not that makes you &#39;fucked up&#39;, you most certainly are not.  Even as one of the Damned, you worry about others, and worry you might go too far.  You certainly are not evil...perhaps &#39;mildly corrupted&#39;.  There is, however, no saving your soul.  You are -mine-, to do with as I please.<br />
<br />
I could warp your mind and flesh, torture you, love you, or kill you now and bring you to Hell.  And right now, what I want to do, is help you achieve your potential.  So do you want to remain a pet, or are you willing to strive for more?”<br />
<br />
“I want more.”  Cole said.<br />
<br />
“Good.  I was going to wait until we got home for this, but I feel you should be punished, just a little, for such doubts.  You&#39;re not just doubting yourself, after all, but doubting me.  Now get down on the floor and pleasure me.”<br />
<br />
Cole&#39;s eyes widened.  “But I&#39;m just a kid!”<br />
<br />
“Indeed you are.  Whether you realize it or not, you&#39;re a child of seven at the moment.  But you don&#39;t need to be an adult to lick out my pussy, so get to work.  I told you there would be a test.”<br />
<br />
Cole dutifully slid to the floor, her clothing loose and baggy on her diminished body, and kneeled on the car mat.  The demoness pulled up her skirt, revealing a pair of Cole&#39;s own panties, silky and black, with a little pink bow on the front.  Lee reached down to touch them, and they vanished, revealing her naked pussy.<br />
<br />
Lee slid forward, and Cole leaned in close.  The smell of the demon was intoxicating, and she began to lick.  Lee was already wet, and her juices had a taste unlike anything Cole had ever experienced before.  <br />
<br />
She felt a hunger grow inside her, and she tried to mimic the things Lee had done to her earlier.  Part of her wished her tongue was longer, bigger, thicker.  She wished her tongue could fill Lee up like a man&#39;s dick.  She wanted nothing more than to please her mistress.<br />
<br />
She could hear soft moans of pleasure, and that encouraged her, but she needed to do more.  She needed to bring this devil-bitch to the very edge!  Then she had an idea.  A terrible idea.  But the more she worked, the greater the temptation.<br />
<br />
She began to imagine Lee in her mind&#39;s eye.  What if, instead of her tongue being larger, Lee were smaller?  A tiny girl half her current size?  Lee had told her not to use this spell on a living thing, but she was a demon, right?  <br />
<br />
She drew in power, she knew not from where, and released it.  Lee gasped in surprise as she began to dwindle, shrinking in her borrowed clothing.  Her pleasure increased the more she shrank, and it was hard for her to concentrate.<br />
<br />
The little wench!  She had disobeyed!  But oh, this felt so amazing!  She should counter it, and punish Cole severely.  But she relaxed, realizing her apprentice was simply trying to please her more.<br />
<br />
Scolding could come later.  She pushed herself closer to her lover.  <br />
<br />
By the time she was under 4&#39; tall, Cole&#39;s probing tongue felt enormous, and she was still shrinking, become tighter and tighter.  Eventually Cole would be unable to fit her whole tongue inside her, but she didn&#39;t care.  Her hips bucked and her back arched as she came, experiencing the best orgasm she&#39;d had in at least a decade!<br />
<br />
Even as she felt her body relax, she realized Cole wasn&#39;t done, as she licked the demon clean.  “Cole...you can stop now.”<br />
<br />
“But Mistress, I want to please you more!”  So earnest, this one!<br />
<br />
“And you shall, I assure you.  But my demonic cum is a bit much for a human to handle.  You shouldn&#39;t over do it.”  Lee began to grow again.  Her shoes had slipped off her feet, and it took a little magic to readjust her clothing.  She did the same for Cole, but left her as a small girl.<br />
<br />
“Now pick up my shoes...well, your shoes...and get back in your seat.”  She decided not to regain her full height, halting her growth once she could comfortably drive the classic car.  Her bare feet didn&#39;t have the same traction on the pedals, but she could manage.<br />
<br />
“Yes Mistress.”  Little Cole scrambled up onto the seat, placing the shoes between them.<br />
<br />
“You can call me Lee.  I should be cross with you for disobeying me...but you were also obeying me at the same time, and I admit, you did a very good job.  Hm.  At that size you might need a car seat.  Let me age you up a bit.”  She reached over and patted Cole on the head, causing the girl to grow just big enough for them not to be pulled over, adjusting her clothes as well.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, M...I mean, Lee.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m going to leave you like that until your parents get home tomorrow.  Well!  You&#39;ve had sex with another woman, have we cured you of your fetish?”<br />
<br />
“No, I don&#39;t think so.  I still want...you know.  But...I guess I have a new kink now.  Amazing demon girls.”  Cole grinned, looking fairly innocent.  But she was far from that!<br />
<br />
“I can&#39;t wait to turn you into a demon.  You&#39;re going to be quite the charmer, my dear.”<br />
<br />
“What kind will I be?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, your desires are too specialized for a Succubus at the moment.  Plus, you&#39;ll know a lot about magic, so perhaps an Uniila.”<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s a...Uniila?”<br />
<br />
“A Cabal Devil.  They are a special breed of Tempter, as they seduce others not with their bodies, but their minds, offering them the most addictive of drugs- magic.  Not only are the magic-wielders in their own right, but they can whisper secrets to mortals to make their magic even stronger.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds cool.  What do they look like?”  <br />
<br />
“Oh, naked human female, wrapped in mist and tattered robes.  Four arms, and a veiled face with glowing eyes usually shrouded in a hood.  Skin the color of a corpse.  Instead of walking, they levitate and fly around, carried aloft by magical power.  Don&#39;t worry, my dear, you&#39;d be quite pretty.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds cool!  So they just fly around because they can?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“Ah, most have their legs bound so they can&#39;t walk even if they wanted to.  It&#39;s not necessary though.  It depends on how loyal the Uniila is.  Because they know so many secrets, you typically have to watch them closely.”  Lee grinned.<br />
<br />
“Huh.  So what do you do with a demon that&#39;s been bad?”<br />
<br />
“Punish them, of course.  Demons have to be disciplined, so punishment for bad behavior and reward for good behavior is the rule.  If you are too lenient, others will see you as weak.  However, the severity of the punishments can vary- most Fallen, like myself, hand out token punishments rather often.<br />
<br />
Some come to like being punished.”<br />
<br />
“So every time you change me, I&#39;m being punished?”  Cole frowned.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll leave that for you to decide.  After all, you seem to enjoy your transformations.”<br />
<br />
“It is kind of cool, to be honest.  To be smaller or younger.  Not sure if I&#39;d like staying that way or not.”<br />
<br />
“Well if you&#39;re a good girl, you needn&#39;t worry about that.”  Lee parked in front of Cole&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
“You know, my parents might notice a big black car out in front of the house.”  Cole pointed out.  She had some trouble opening the heavy car door, and Lee came around to help her.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;d think so, but they probably won&#39;t.”  Lee took Cole&#39;s hand, and they walked inside together.</p>
