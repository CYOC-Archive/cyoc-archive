<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You continued wandering through the woods towards the howls fearful for your survival, and that you could learn how to live as a wolf. Suddenly you smelled something that caught your attention, like something was here earlier, and it smelled like you but only a slight hint. You were shocked by how strong your nose is, and how strong that scent was and it was like you were right next to whatever was creating it. Just then you heard a howl come from right behind you, and you were startled by it.<br />
<br />
You turned around to see three male wolves emerge from the bushes behind you growling. You stood there frozen in fear, and the three wolves began circling around you growling. You then saw one move to strike, and you closed your eyes and flinched. But suddenly you heard another howl, and all three wolves stopped and all looked over at the bushes. You then saw a male wolf slightly larger than the others emerge slowly and walked up to you and inspected you closely, and then proceeded to sniff your asshole, and you had urges to do the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Idiots!&quot; The larger male growled,&quot;Why are you all incapable of identifying a loner, from an enemy!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, she&#39;s trespassing on our territory.&quot; One of the other wolves said<br />
<br />
The larger male then walked up to the wolf and barked angrily, and yelled,&quot;Don&#39;t you think I know that, or do you not know the simple procedures in our pack!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S..sorry sir we were just following orders.&quot; Another wolf said<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you did, your nothing but a mere beta! But you all should know how our enemies smell, and if you would use that dust filled brain of yours, you would realize that if this was an attack then there would at least be a small group of betas at LEAST for bait if it was an attack! Especially when comparing the might of several male wolves to a SINGLE female wolf!&quot; The larger male barked at the lesser wolves, then growled and looked back at the one he was originally talking to.&quot;Now I would expect a mistake like this if a beta was the one who made the judgment call, but you are an omega, so start live up to your damn position! Now all of you leave us, you all disgust me with your sudden, and inexplainable ignorance.&quot; The larger wolf growled, and the other wolves whimpered and scurried back into the bushes.<br />
<br />
You were utterly shocked about how dominant the one wolf was to the other three, and that seemed oddly attractive to you. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; The wolf asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...uh, yes thank you for saving me.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t carry any scent that I am familiar with, besides the obvious scent of being a wolf. Who are you? Where are you from? What are the reasons why you are lone, and not in a pack?&quot; The male asked<br />
<br />
You hesitated, and thought fast, and responded,&quot;I...I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t know anything actually, not my name, nor where I was born. Just that I never really was part of any pack, and that my parents were both lone, and that they were killed when I was young.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Absurd! No wolf should ever kill a loner, especially with young or mate.&quot; The wolf said<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t a wolf that killed them.&quot; You said then fell silent feeling a bit guilty from what you were doing before all of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, then it was humans, definitely explains that aspect. But as a pup you always receive a name after learning how to hunt in accordance to your skill, so what is yours?&quot; The wolf asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Th...that&#39;s when it happened.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you are the only survivor out of your siblings then, how cruel humans can be killing both a mother, father, and their litter.....You&#39;ve been through a lot, and seeing that your scent is unique, and that your still alive after your claim, you must have travelled far. As far as I see on a male standard you would clearly earn the rank of at least an omega, that is for a new pack member that isn&#39;t exactly trusted by alpha standards. However, your tone, and your eyes show that despite your experiences you are gentle, but you put aside your nature for survival, and that&#39;s something that I&#39;ve wanted in someone for so long. Please, this may be a bit soon to ask if I was a beta or omega, but please miss will you be my mate.&quot; The wolf said excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...uh, sure...I think, I mean you did save me after all.&quot; You said nervously without another thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you are in my debt, but this shouldn&#39;t count as such a method to repay me. Nonetheless I appreciate you, and your scent is something that will adapt over time. I apologize that I didn&#39;t state this sooner, but my name is Shade, stealth is my hunting specialty obviously. You won&#39;t need to worry about much, so how about I along with everyone else you encounter adress you as Melancholy. A name that expresses your sorrow as much as your views of the world and survival. I am an Alpha if not obvious, and you will be respected as my mate, and bear our pups. However, unlike your situation as a pup, our young will have protection, and I promise that I will have additional guard for our young when we are there for their first hunt, so that they don&#39;t end up like you.&quot; The wolf, Shade said<br />
<br />
&quot;Th..thanks you seem so generous with those offers, but overall how will I ever repay you?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it my love, trust me, I&#39;ll get what I need from you in a manner that we both will agree to.&quot; Shade said<br />
<br />
&quot;How exactly?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I believe the trial of bearing our pups is enough. Now follow me I&#39;ll escort you back to the pack myself so that there aren&#39;t any confusions.&quot; Shade said<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, I shall follow you then my love.&quot; You said blushing under your fur at the fact that you called Shade your love.<br />
<br />
You followed Shade through the forest as you had another encounter with the wolves from before, but all Shade needed to do was to intimidate them, and they backed off. Shade then lead you to a large gathering of wolves, once there Shade said that you had to now.....</p>
