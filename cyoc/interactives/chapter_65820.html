<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking home, Tad wondered how he would explain that for Hallowe'en this year he was going to be dressing in drag. He knew his fourteen year old sister, Samantha, would probably think this was funny and lapse into a fit of giggles. His older brother Ted, who was eighteen and preparing to graduate from High School and go on to college, would probably tease him and call him something like queer-boy or some other name, while Tad's father would sneer and probably side with Ted on the issue. Tad's mother, on the other hand, would most likely not voice an opinion, unless he had a legal problem with his choice.<br />
<br />
Unsure how he should approach telling his family, finding that he really did not like the idea of dressing in drag, but figuring that it was okay if it was done for Hallowe'en, Tad shifted his package and thought to himself, &quot;After all. All Hallow's Eve is the one night a person gets to dress up and pretend to be something they are not,&quot; and then he lost himself in thought as he wondered if sixteen was too old to be dressing up for Hallowe'en.<br />
<br />
Stopping, Tad sat down on the curb and setting down his purchase, he began to eat his dinner. As he did so, watching the traffic pass as he ate, he debated on what he should do when it came to his family. After a moment, his thoughts drifted back to the costume shop and for a moment he felt perplexed, as he could not remember this town ever having such a store and standing, he looked about as he finished his meal and spying a phone-booth, he hurried across the street. Picking up the phone-book attached to the bottom of the phone, began to thumb through the white pages first and the yellow pages when he could not find a listing for a shop he just made a purchase from.<br />
<br />
Suddenly remembering his purchases, Tad dropped the book and without looking, darted back across the street, where he found the items he had purchased still sitting where he had left them. Picking them up, Tad thought, &quot;Guess I just deal with the storm, if there is one,&quot; as he began to once again walk home, he mind flummoxed by the fact that the costume shop had no listing and that he was still unsure how to approach his family, except that Hallowe'en was probably the best time.<br />
<br />
Home, Tad was glad that the house was dark, as it meant that his brother was probably still at practice, his sister was most likely out with her friends and that dad and mom were still working. Heading for his room, Tad flicked on the light, dropped the bag with his purchase to the floor, kicked off his shoes and dropping his coat over the desk chair, he flopped down onto his bed and lay there, staring at the ceiling.<br />
<br />
After a moment, he sat up and reaching for the bag, he began to pull the items out and lay them on his bed. Standing, he headed for the bedroom door and engaging the lock, just in case Ted came home early and decided he wanted to bother Tad about something, Tad turned back to the bed and thinking, &quot;All sizes guaranteed to fit,&quot; he wondered how the costume would fit over his build, as he was about six foot two and had the same build as his brother, a frame perfect for somebody wanting to play football, which Tad did not, to his father and brother's displeasure.<br />
<br />
Picking up the body suit, Tad took a closer look at it, amazed at the amount of detail that had gone into it. The fur that covered was soft and felt realistic. The breasts, Tad could see appeared to be also life-like and cupping them and then placing a hand inside the body suit just behind them, he saw that they would stick out in a way that made it appear the wearer actually had breasts.<br />
<br />
As he wondered if there was something sewn into the material, &quot;Perhaps some sort of insert,&quot; he thought, Tad turned his investigation to the paw-like feet and hands.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, he found that, like the mask, they were held in place by a pair of plastic clips and undoing the clips, he found that it was easier to look at the craftsmanship that went into their design, for they felt so life-like, Tad would have sworn that he was holding the actual foot of an animal in his hand or the actual hand of a person who had soft fur covering their hand.<br />
<br />
Setting down the paw-like hands and feet, he picked up the mask and began to examine it, finding that again everything appeared life-like and that the eyes had film-like design that made the wearers own eyes appear orange in colour. Setting down the mask next to the paw-like hands and feet, Tad picked up the clothes he had bought, suddenly feeling rather silly for having bought such items and wondering if a girl would actually put together such an outfit and deciding that he might carefully broach the subject to Sam, he turned his attention back to the body suit.<br />
<br />
Curious about the level of detail, he flipped it over and lifting up the bushy, red tail, Tads takes in what is clearly the anus and investigating further, he finds what were clearly a girl’s exterior genitals. Dropping the costume onto his bed, Tad muttered, &quot;Whoever designed this costume obviously went in for a lot of detail,&quot; as he turned his attention to the bag and fishing out the receipt, he found himself disappointed that all it had on there was a list of his purchases in light blue ink and no address for the shop.<br />
<br />
Dropping the piece of paper back into the bag, Tad wondered how it was the he was supposed to return the costume if he was unsatisfied with it. Turning his attention back to the costume, he once again thinking about how all sizes were guaranteed to fit and deciding that he might as well try on the costume before Hallowe'en, just in case he needed to return it, he began to slowly strip down, pausing at his underwear, but deciding it would probably fit better without his underwear on and taking off the final article of clothing, he reached for the costume and picking it up, he wondered how he was supposed to put it on.<br />
<br />
In the end, Tad decided that it was meant to be pulled on with the person sliding it on by going through the neck opening and sitting down on his bed, Tad partially rolled the costume up and slid his legs and feet into it.<br />
<br />
At first Tad found it to be a tight fit, but in the end managed to forced his feet through the leg holes and as he pulled the costume up, he paused and thought about his penis and testicles and whether there would be some unsightly bulge, something he had never considered before. Figuring that this was his first time trying on the costume and that he could experiment, he thought about how best to hide any bulge and in the end tucked his penis and testicles back as he pulled the costume up past his waist.<br />
<br />
Next, he began to struggle with getting his arms in, but in the end managed and sliding his hands through the openings at the end of the arms, he shifted about and pulled the costume on the rest of the way. Looking down, Tad found himself amazed at how form-fitting it was and running a hand over the costume, he found himself even more amazed that he could actually feel and that his hand touching the breasts and fur actually produced such pleasing sensations. Twisting about, he attempted to look behind and what he saw caused him to gasp as he saw that the tail that was attached to the body suit was actually twitching back and forth.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's so life-like,&quot; Tad thought as he sat down and then promptly leapt again when the sheets of his bed came in contact with the area between his legs and feeling sort of spooked, he thought, &quot;To life-like,&quot; as he reached up and began to run a hand over his neck, searching for the seam that separated the costume from the him.<br />
<br />
Scared, he began to paw frantically at the area of his neck and when he still could not find the separation point, he switched his search to the ends of the arms and then to the area around his ankles. Panicking, no longer having any wish to be wearing the costume, Tad took off across his room, fumbled with the door for a moment and when he finally got it open, he tore down the hall toward the bathroom, switching direction half-way and instead headed for Sam's room.<br />
<br />
Dashing inside, he tripped over the various objects Sam left on the floor as he made his way toward her closet and pulling open the door when he got there, he swatted at the air for a moment before finding the pull-cord for the light. Yanking on it, Tad turned his attention to the mirror that he knew Sam had had hung there three years previous and taking in the image reflecting back, he found himself close to screaming, as he once again began searching the neckline for what knew should be there, but for some odd reason was not there, as the reflection he was looking at concurred.<br />
<br />
As he realised that what he was seeing was real and that what he was feeling was also real, Tad slowly began to back away from the mirror, silently whispering, “No, no, no, no,” over and over as he attempted desperately to come up with a solution as to how to get out of the mess he suddenly found himself in.<br />
<br />
A door slamming draws him back to the fact that he was standing in his sister’s room wearing nothing but a Hallowe’en costume that has apparently somehow replaced his normal body with itself, he clicks off the closet light and turning, he starts back out of the room, stepping and tripping over items as he moves. Outside Samantha’s room, he heard the sound of voices drawing closer and realising that it was Sam and her friends, he took off down the hall toward his room, closing the door just as Sam and her friends reached the top of the stairs.<br />
<br />
As he reached for the light switch and clicked on the light, Tad looked down at his body and the sight of his chest brought tears to his eyes as he despaired of every getting the costume off and wondering how Sam might take it that she now had somewhat a sister rather than a brother, Tad took the rest of the costume off the bed, threw the items into the bag and kicking it across his room, he turned off the light and crawled into his bed. Curling up into a fetal position, hating the way his body felt, he felt the tears start to fall faster and wishing that this was all a nightmare and that he could wake up, Tad pulled the covers and sheets over his head, a tiny voice in his mind telling him that the costume shop had the answers on how to undo what had happened as he found himself drifting off to sleep.</p>
