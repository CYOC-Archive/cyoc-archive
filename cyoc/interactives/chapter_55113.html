<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Whatever was left of tom slipped away as those drops of piss hit him. Brian's bowels released and a stream of yellow piss ran down into Tom's diaper body. Tom reeled, his mind overwhelmed by the flooding sensation in him; the human parts of his mind screamed out in protest. <br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Thought Tom. &quot;THIS IS SICK. WRONG. DISGUSTING. My name is Tom! I'm a human being&quot;. <br />
<br />
But those words sounded unconvincing in his mind the moment he said them. What was his name again? T... T-.... No, that wasn't it. He was a diaper wasn't he? Yes; a huge padded diaper. Padds. That sounded like a better name. Yes. Padds the diaper. <br />
<br />
On the front of the diaper a little logo appeared, bearing the lettering &quot;Padds&quot; in big babyish lettering. Brian finished his long pee and felt bad for what he did. Diaper Tom was full of piss, and visibily swolen. Brian waddled back to his crib and lied down. As he fell asleep, the nice padded diaper hugged close to his body.<br />
<br />
When Brian woke, looked across to where the skinny guy was sleeping. Gasping, he waddled over (still encumbered by the thick diaper around his waist) he picked up a thinner diaper lying in the middle of the skinny guys crib. On the front of the diaper was a &quot;nite phants&quot; label, in big bold letters. The skinny guy had turned into training pants? Holy shit. He looked at the skinny guys bottle; empty.<br />
<br />
Brian dropped the diaper and started for the door. His tummy felt funny. Brain realised he needed to crap, and bad. Looking for the training potty they'd put out, he runs over. He yanked at the diaper furiously trying to remove the straps. But they wouldn't budge. Not even an inch.<br />
<br />
Padds would smile, if he wasn't a diaper. He'd already had hours to bond to brians form, he wasn't comming off; and he was looking foward to his gift. Brian gave up, giving into the inevitable. Letting loose, a huge load was dumped directly into padds, who drew up close to Brian, making him feel the heavy load he'd just dropped. Brian felt disgusted. <br />
<br />
He wanted out. This experiment was over as far as he was concerned. He waddled as fast as he could out to the scientist currently in charge. Mustering all his focus of mind, he tried to formulate his sentense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brian.... want.... go... out!&quot; Yelled brian<br />
<br />
The scientist appeared shocked. &quot;Brian... how are you.... still... Did you drink your bottle last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;BRIAN WANT OUT. NO BOTTLE!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, so you didn't drink your bottle, and now you've seen the other boys finally transform into their diaper selves. Huh. Well i'm afraid there's no way out now Brian. You're already regressed into a man baby. And by the looks of it, Toms pretty happy to be your diaper friend.&quot; replied the scientist, sternly.<br />
<br />
He tugged the diaper attached Brian. It didn't give way to his attempt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup. You're stuck with that To-..&quot; He glanced at the lettering. &quot;er, Padds because his mind made a choice before it transformed fully into a diaper. He wants to be with you. See, these diapers we develped are super absorbant for a reason. They never need to be replaced. He'll just slowly absorb any mess you make.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian was shocked, and he moved his arm to check the lump in the seat of his diaper. There was nothing there. Padds was  very happy. He was a good diaper. <br />
<br />
&quot;We can't transform you now you've got er, Padds attached. But we do need a mascot.. Yeah, that'll work i think.&quot; said the scientist, thinking it over.<br />
<br />
The scientist walked over to the nearby lab counter, and picked up what appeared to be a adult sized pacifier. The scientist dipped the tip in solution and walked over to where brian was desperately trying to waddle away, prevented by Padds, who liked the idea of being together with Brian forever.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really wanted a chance to use my hypnosis mix, fantastic chance&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Brian could protest, the pacifier was shoved into his mouth. Brian was about to spit it out, but the taste was amazing. He started to suck. Slowly he felt his mind clouding over... What had he come here for? He couldn't remmeber. He couldn't remmeber his name either. <br />
<br />
The scientist looked Brian right in the eye, and said &quot;Good boy. You're a good baby aren't you. Isn't that right baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
Was that his name? Baby? He glanced down at the big diaper. That felt right. Babies wear diapers. Yes. His name was baby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good baby. You'll do fine as the product mascot. Now if you're gonna be wearing that diapy all the time, you gotta make sure you use him lots, ok? You can't remember how to use the toilet can you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Baby shook his head. Happily he let go and a steam of pee filled his diaper up to the limit. He then gave a grunt as a big stinky heap was dropped into his diaper. Padds was in heaven he squezed the mess tightly to Baby's body. Baby couldn't handle the heavy weight of the diaper and fell on his big padded bottom, a giant grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Baby and Padds where happy and messy.</p>
