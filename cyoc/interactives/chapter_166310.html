<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I realize this incredulous account has thus far been entirely from my own point of view, which complicates matters. I&#39;m only an outsider to these events, I can&#39;t truly know how my nephew felt through his ordeal. Thankfully, Butch has graciously provided his own entry that offers a first-hand account of his transformation up to this point. I must warn that sensitive readers may find his account more vulgar than my own...<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t know what to expect when I first stepped into that shop. I only knew that I didn&#39;t need new shoes. Especially not the crusty, old pair of boots I was given. It&#39;s like my dad bought them with someone else in mind entirely. Then the shop clerk stole my new trainers and wouldn&#39;t let me leave without putting the boots on. How crazy is that? My uncle, who&#39;s usually outspoken about this kinda thing, barely put up an argument and forced me to put the boots on. Well, I weren&#39;t too happy &#39;bout that. They were like 6 sizes too big for me. I almost fell flat on my face when I tried walking in &#39;em, yet they never once slipped off my feet. I could tell something strange was up yet my conspiracy loving uncle barely bat an eyelid. It was sorta concerning, he&#39;s usually attuned to that sorta thing. <br />
<br />
It took a good five minutes to walk to the car parked literally down the road. It did give me a chance to get the hang of walking with them behemoths though. I climbed into the back seat of the car, my uncle offered to clear the fast food wrappers and gym clothes off the front seat when he picked me up from school but I didn&#39;t wanna sit where his nasty trash once was. It weren&#39;t long before we were off back to my house.<br />
<br />
It was cramped in the back, which was strange since it definitely felt more roomy on the way to the shoe store. No matter how I shifted my body, I couldn&#39;t get comfy. In the end, I had to stretch out across the back seats when my uncle complained about my knees jamming into the back of his seat. I couldn&#39;t understand it, was I actually growing bigger? Growth spurts didn&#39;t just happen in moments, after all. Yet I couldn&#39;t ignore the fact my clothes felt kinda snug on me. I always wore baggy clothes so it weren&#39;t right! My shirt barely covered the belt loops on my shorts, which themselves were now inches above my kneecaps. My legs were much longer, for sure. The rim of those grimy boots used to rest just below my kneecaps and now they were halfway down my calves. It weren&#39;t just added length though, as my calves and thighs looked thicker, more well-built. Not to mention I seemed to have grown a noticeable amount of leg hair too. I&#39;d always had rather dainty legs so this was a shock to me. Were the boots doing this? I tried to yank one off my foot but it clung on, no matter how hard I tried. What would I do if I got them off anyway? I had no other shoes to wear. &#39;Sides, it was actually kinda cool to be getting bigger and more masculine, y&#39;know? Maybe dad would actually pay attention to me now...<br />
<br />
Halfway into the car journey, my uncle happened to turn and see me bunched up across the backseats looking far different than I used to. I expected him to make a big deal of it, question what happened, even be inappropriately ecstatic that some supernatural energy had affected me. So imagine my surprise when he didn&#39;t even question my appearance. He just shoved his shit off the front seat and said I could push it down if I needed to stretch my legs. It was right uncharacteristic of him... It was nice to have some space, however. I said &quot;Thanks, that helps a whole lot!&quot; and immediately covered my mouth in shock. My voice was so deep! I normally sound like a nasally, cartoon nerd, but this voice sounded more like a dumb, cartoon jock. I could tell my uncle was shocked too, but he just chucked a bottle of water my way and continued driving. Then out of nowhere, he asked me why I was still wearing my boots like he didn&#39;t make me put them on in the first place! I may have made a snarky response about actually liking them now, but he asked for it! We didn&#39;t say anything to each other for the rest of the car journey after that...<br />
<br />
By the time we reached my house, I had done a whole lot more growing. My legs were long enough to stick over the flattened car seat I rested them on, and I could feel my head brushing against the roof of the car. Even more surprising, my beanpole frame had actually filled out with enough mass to go from skinny to somewhat athletic! I even had armpit hair poking out my sleeves! And you know what? After the initial shock and confusion had passed, I was actually enjoying what was happening to me. Finally, I was becoming the sort of guy my dad would be proud of. I was getting impatient, wishing to get inside so I could look in a mirror. I clamored out of that cramped car as fast as I could, happy to have some breathing room. It weren&#39;t &#39;til I stretched out my body that I realized the extent of my changes. Namely that my shirt was now more like a crop top, baring my slightly hairy stomach to the world. I didn&#39;t even realize I&#39;d busted the buttons and waistband on my shorts, exposing my underwear, and rather large looking package, for anyone to see. Ironically, the only thing that fit me now were my boots... With my clothes now too small for my larger body, I could feel a breeze in the air. I hunched over and crossed my arms in an effort to keep warm. I looked to my uncle to see if he was ready to head inside, only to find him staring at me intensely. He almost looked concerned. He finally noticed I was looking at him and blushed, saying he forgot how big I&#39;d gotten recently and he was going to deal with the car first. I just grunted and left him, I had better things to deal with.<br />
<br />
After knocking on the door, I had a small moment of panic. What if my dad didn&#39;t recognize me now I was bigger and tougher? Of course, I had nothing to worry about. He opened the door with a quizzical look that quickly faded to excitement as he pulled me into a large bear hug. &quot;Butch m&#39;boy! Y&#39;got the boots on already? They look good on ya, mate!&quot; he exclaimed while ruffling my shaggy hair. <br />
<br />
I managed to break free of his surprisingly strong grip and mumbled &quot;Yeah, yeah, &#39;m jus&#39; gonna go t&#39; m&#39; room&quot;, slurring all my words together. I squeezed my way past him and ran upstairs to my bedroom to avoid any more pleasantries and to finally check myself out. I stood in front of my mirror and gasped, bringing a hand up to my face to feel the stubble growing along my jaw. Sure, it was a bit sparse, but I had actual facial hair! I could probably grow a decent goatee if I wanted. It would complement my more angular jawline, which had shaped into a distinctly triangular chin. Yet despite how pleased I was, my heavier brow and naturally scowling lips gave me a bad case of RBF. That&#39;s &#39;resting bitch face&#39; for the uninformed.<br />
<br />
The next thing I noticed was how thick I looked. I&#39;d developed an almost rectangular torso thanks to my broad, sturdy shoulders, and thick waist that weren&#39;t too fat nor too jacked. I struggled to pull my shirt over my head, trying not to rip it. It was a favorite of mine, and I&#39;d already lost a good pair of shoes. But deep down, I knew I&#39;d never be small enough to wear it again. So with a heavy heart, I gripped it at the chest and tore it clean off my body. The guilt of ruining such a fine shirt was instantly overshadowed by an awareness of my reflection. Seeing myself topless, noting the patch of black hairs growing in the center of my chest, joining a treasure trail down to my crotch, made me realize I weren&#39;t a teenager anymore. I looked more like I could have been in college, which is a big difference. I flexed my hairy arms and grinned stupidly upon seeing them bulge with muscle. <br />
<br />
Next to come off were my shorts. I didn&#39;t even bother to try and get them over my boots. I&#39;d already busted the waistband, and the buttons on them anyway. They were harder to rip off, but when I did, boy was I in for a treat! As soon as I pulled them off, my taut underwear couldn&#39;t hold up to my larger body and swiftly shredded apart of their own accord. I could tell from my bulge that I was pleasantly endowed, but to see that monster cock dangling between my legs, swinging from side to side after being freed from their cotton confines. I gasped and reached down to rest it in my hand. It felt heavy in my grip. I couldn&#39;t help but slide my foreskin back to reveal a blushing pink mushroom-like tip, glistening with pre-cum. I could feel the blood pumping through my cock, quickly turning that flaccid lump of meat into a rock-hard erection that proudly jutted out from my crotch. I smirked, tightening my grip and slowly sliding my hand up and down its entire length. I shuddered at the tingling pleasure I felt, picking up the pace. With my other hand, I gently stroked my meaty chest, feeling the new hairs slip through my open palm and twirling a finger around my sensitive nipples. I was breathing heavily now, my head swimming from all these feelings. I&#39;d jacked off before many times, but I&#39;d never felt passion this intense. It was like a raw, masculine energy that I&#39;d always lacked, until now. <br />
<br />
I fell back onto my bed with a thud and a creak, thrusting my crotch into my huge palm. With a heavy grunt, I finally ejaculated a huge load of cum all over myself. White, sticky ropes smeared across my furry chest and smothered my face. I licked some of it off my lips, reveling in the salty, musky flavor. It was pure male essence, just like I was now.<br />
<br />
I laid back for a few minutes, waiting to catch my breath again before I pulled myself to my feet and reached for a scrap piece of my old t-shirt to wipe myself down. I spied myself in the mirror again and smirked. I looked even older, there was no doubt that I was a proper man now. My facial hair has thickened considerably to form a short moustache and goatee surrounding my lips, alongside a dense stubble that coated my cheeks. My body hair had spread to cover my pecs with a healthy dosage of curls and was making its way north to my shoulders. More hairs covered my thick waist, built up with sturdy muscle, even if a slight layer of flab hid my abs from view. It still felt solid as a rock and was more than appreciated. I thought I&#39;d stay a weedy wimp my entire life, so my rapid growth into a blossoming beefcake was wholeheartedly welcome.<br />
<br />
Now I&#39;d had my fun, I figured it was time to take the boots off. I yanked on one, using all my newfound strength in an effort to release it, but it was no use. The other boot shared a similar grip to my feet. I guessed that the boots still had plans for me, wanted to change me even further. But what else could they do? I already looked at least a decade older. However, I didn&#39;t really want to question it. If the boots wanted to make more manly and mature then I weren&#39;t going to stop &#39;em. But I did need some clothes.<br />
<br />
I snuck into my dad&#39;s room and found a pair of overalls that looked big enough to fit me. But the problem weren&#39;t my height or my size. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#39;t seem to fit my feet through the legs holes. Not with these bulky boots on. I bounced and bounced until I fell to the ground with a loud thud. I heard my dad call out from downstairs to see if I was alright. He wanted to check on me, but I couldn&#39;t let him see my big, fat schlong! However, I panicked and said I would come downstairs to him. I slapped my forehead for saying that. How could I go downstairs and greet my dad and uncle in my birthday suit? In a last minute panic, I had an idea. It was temporary, of course, but when I had no chance of putting on any clothes, a large bath towel was a handy last resort. I grabbed one off the towel rack in the bathroom, wrapped it around my waist, and made my way downstairs to the kitchen. I opened the door to see my uncle and dad both staring at me with amazement. And who could blame them? I raised an eyebrow at their slack-jaw expressions and boasted &quot;So I need some new clothes...&quot;</p>
