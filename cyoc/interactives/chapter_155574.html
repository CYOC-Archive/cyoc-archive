<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ezra screams as the two hobgoblins begin to kiss. The hobgoblin momentarily breaking the kiss to speak.<br />
&quot;He is well on his way to becoming our son.&quot;<br />
Ezra feels strange, he speaks up.<br />
&quot;What do-&quot;<br />
<br />
Ezra suddenly stops himself from talking, his voice no longer sounds like his own. It&#39;s deeper and rougher, yet presented with a tinge of nobility. Like a beast who has trained themselves as a noble... like the two hobgoblins in front of Ezra. Alex breaks the kiss as he rests against his husband. <br />
&quot;He already sounds so much like you...&quot;<br />
&quot;He does, yet he has your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ezra looks around desperately. Running to a nearby mirror and closely examining his face. Ezra stares at the mirror, locking onto his eyes. Bright blue like the sky, just like his father’s... though something is off. The blue begins to fade, becoming clear, then a bright orange. Ezra trembles, his eyes do not resemble his old fathers anymore... they resemble his new father. His reflection continues to change, his skin turning red around the eyes. The red spreading across his face, his visage becoming more beastlike as he is overtaken. His teeth sharpening, his ears becoming pointed. An itching emerging on Ezra&#39;s chin as black hairs begin to sprout. A beard slowly growing, stopping suddenly as Ezra has a short black beard. The beard well-groomed and maintained.<br />
<br />
The hobgoblin walks towards Ezra, placing a hand on his shoulder. Ezra looks up to the hobgoblin, their eyes connecting as the hobgoblin seems full of pride.<br />
&quot;My son, that beard is a step into your adulthood.&quot;<br />
The hobgoblin looks towards Alex, the two having a loving smile.<br />
&quot;We are proud of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ezra looks back to the mirror. Staring back at him is a hobgoblin... or rather hobgoblin in transit. Ezra&#39;s face fully resembles his new parents, yet his body is still distinctly human. He&#39;s so rugged and attractive, taking after his parents. A fine hobgoblin in the making. Ezra feels his clothes tightly press against him, his parents kneeling besides him as they begin to undo his clothes. The hobgoblin quickly stripping him as Alex gathers up the clothes, placing them into a neat pile as the couple watches their son.<br />
<br />
Ezra remains still for his parents, watching his now naked form in the mirror. He looks for any more changes, quickly spotting his torso. Ezra touches at his chest, noticing now firm pecs and abs. He&#39;s present with muscle, having buffed up quite a bit in such a short time. His chest beginning to turn red as black hairs sprout in-between his pecs, then grow out across his torso. Ezra matching his parents with a light coating of chest hair, and firm muscles. Though compared to his father&#39;s, Ezra still has much to grow. <br />
<br />
Ezra&#39;s arms begin to itch as they too gain muscle. Becoming firm, before turning red, then gaining a light coating of hair. His arms matching his chests bulk, as Ezra looks to his lower body for the remaining changes. His dick quickly standing erect as he slowly moves a hand to stroke it. His hand stopped as his father grabs it, the hobgoblin grinning.<br />
&quot;Son, do not worry. We have goblins for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Three goblins immediately rush into the room and approach Ezra. Rushing towards his throbbing cock, the first goblin plants his lips on the tip as the other two begin to stroke Ezra. With each stroke, Ezra sees his dick change. Pre leaking from his cockhead as the tip becomes red. It does not take long for Ezra to reach his limit, his hand instinctively holding the goblin against his dick as he feeds the creature with his seed. His cock now completely red as the goblins rotate, the first now stroking his cock with the third, as the second goblin plants his lips on Ezra&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
As Ezra feeds the goblins, he notices his final changes. His humanity leaving him completely as his legs and feet become red. Black hairs lightly coating his legs, and might reaffirming his new race. The three goblins drink their fill, then leave Ezra. Ezra staring once again at his reflection.<br />
<br />
No longer does a human greet him, instead he sees a young hobgoblin. Red skin, black hair, and full of might. Ezra has grown into his new family, his fathers behind him in the reflection. Their features being visible in Ezra now, his eyes matching Alex&#39;s, his beard similar to the hobgoblins. Each part of his body slightly resembling his parents, as it confirms his new identity as a member of their family.<br />
<br />
Ezra turns to his parents, hugging them tightly as they are filled with pride.<br />
&quot;My love, we have done well.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, we have a son now, a beautiful boy.&quot;<br />
Ezra fills with new feelings for his parents. Love for them and for what they&#39;ve done, a want to stay with them. His fathers once again speak.<br />
&quot;What should we do now my love?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well... how about our new son decides.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hug breaks as Alex and the hobgoblin take a seat on the couch. Ezra sitting as well on a nearby chair.<br />
&quot;Son, I think it is time for some family bonding. What do you want to do?&quot;<br />
Ezra thinks, staring at his parents as he decides...</p>
