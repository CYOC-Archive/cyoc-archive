<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan was still getting used to her new body, she hadn’t even really studied herself yet in the mirror. <br />
<br />
“Mrs. Maxwell…you need to get dressed we have a small selection.” Explained the doctor as a nurse pushed up a cart which contained draws of different cloths. The cart was labeled female, demonic, wings. Other nearby carts where labeled male, demonic, non-wings and so on. A nurse came over with a tape measure and found her cup size and the size of her other cloths. Susan took a few minutes to pick out a white bra and bottom set, she at first grabbed her normal size only to find that was way to tight, a few tries later she was in a set which worked. The bright clean white stood out against her charcoal skin, a pair of pants. The pants buttoned in the back with a flap/hole for her new tail. She picked out a black open back for her wings top which confirmed her skin was charcoal not black in her mind. <br />
<br />
“Well, I will have to learn all new measurements now.” Joked Mrs. Maxwell, while all this was happening the doctor was preparing the injection for Mr. Maxwell. <br />
<br />
“So are you ready Mr. Maxwell.” Said the Doctor as he finished the getting the needle ready. <br />
<br />
“Alright.” Said Mike Maxwell as he took off his shirt, he didn’t have the six pack he had when he was fresh out of boot camp, but he was still strong. He felt a little shy about fully undressing but he had no choice. By the look his now succubus wife was giving his manhood he didn’t know if he should be afraid or aroused. He settled on both as the doctor walked over and injected the drug into his shoulder. <br />
<br />
There was a pause and for a moment nothing happened, and then his legs began to burn. He looked down as he watched his feet merge from 5 toes to 3 large toes. Then the toes began to harden turning into claws. Then the back part of his foot around the heel began to lift off the ground even while the front part remained on the ground. A new toe or better now a claw formed out of his heel raising the total to four, three on the front and one in the back. This pushed his height up as his legs began to grow adding muscles. He was so focused on his legs he didn’t his ears becoming larger and pointed. <br />
<br />
Susan watched as he husband gained in muscles mass, she wouldn’t admit it to him but she missed those six pack abs he had when he was in the army. Those where back and far more defined and she noticed that his manhood had grown in size which really made her happy. He was already more then adequate in that department but now he was in a league of his own. Her new succubus mind was now filled with ideas of what they would do with that tonight. They had made five kids, maybe a six was in order. She watched as like her; he began to drop in age. She watched his face as even as he added muscles, he didn’t drop the 25 years or so like she did, but it was a good 20. If she had to guess, he would be either 28 or 27 instead of the late 40s like they both had been only a few minutes ago.   <br />
<br />
Mike didn’t know what he was changing into yet, only that he was now ripped and judging by how his wife was looking at him another kid or kids given they had two sets of twins already was in their future. He was breathing heavily a bit as he felt his shoulders grow apart as he gained more muscles. He would have thought he would have been over the top body builder type, but he seamed to be growing in height as well. His arms grew larger and stronger as his fingers become something kin to claws but they where more fleshly. Out of his shoulder blades two large wings began to form, these where still flesh color and like his wife they were bat like in nature, a tail also began to form and like his wife, it wasn’t hooked or spaded. <br />
<br />
Then the changes reached his face, his jaw line became much stronger and more defined. Growing out of his head in line with his eyes where four small fleshly horns, the smaller one in front. His short buzz cut hair stayed the same. Susan studied her husband and liked what she saw as his skin tone began to shift, going from white shifting to a deep dark red, his hair becoming black. He looked somewhat liked a devil but not the classic devil type.<br />
<br />
“Am…am I done?” inquired Mike his voice shaking a bit.<br />
<br />
“I believe so.” Answered the Doctor <br />
<br />
“What…what am I?” inquired Mike, he felt powerful, he felt strong but he didn’t know what he was. <br />
<br />
“Judging by the lack of horns, I would say Gargoyle.” said the Doctor as Mike pointed to the fleshly horns. The doctor rolled his eyes and went on. “See Demons have hardened horns like a ram or the like while Gargoyles have fleshy horns. Also the feet is a giveaway as well.”<br />
<br />
“Gargoyle…will I turn to stone during the day?” inquired Mike<br />
<br />
“No…but your natural sleep cycle is nocturnal so you would do better at night then at day.” explained the doctor<br />
<br />
“Well I’ll get him to sleep.” said Susan as Mike looked at her. Susan was the daughter of a minister, she never talked like that in public. “Sorry…I should have kept that to myself.”<br />
<br />
“It’s alright, as a succubus you have a heighten sex drive and on some levels, you feed off sex.” Explained the doctor as both Maxwell’s looked at him “I have been told succubus or Incubus sex is the best sex.”<br />
<br />
“Well let’s get you dressed and out to meet your kids.” Said the nurse “Then we can transform the rest of your family.”</p>
