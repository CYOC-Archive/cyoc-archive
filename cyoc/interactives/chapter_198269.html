<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Had to update this after a while and fix a few plot holes I had made originally. Can you blame me? The concept was hot!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh fuck, John...&quot; <br />
Kim moaned as John thrusted deep into her, the bodybuilder&#39;s breath hitched as he slammed his thickened cock into her slick entrance.<br />
<br />
John had recovered from a post masturbation nap when his vixen wife had gently entered the room and found her hunk of a husband sleeping with a throbbing package waiting for her.<br />
<br />
John growled like an animal, slamming his pelvis harder against his wife, too caught up into the welcomed adrenaline that kept him going, his pecs jostled with each motion as Kim&#39;s body rocked against the bed and baseboard, a familiar knocking and creaking was forceful enough to jolt Simon out of his sleep as he heard the two fuck like rabbits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Newly weds...&quot; Simon groaned, tossing over and hoping to close his eyes and rest for the night, as Kim repeated her mantras to God. <br />
<br />
John truly had it all, a 265 pound frame, a decent gut that had shown his six pack abs to the extreme... A milf-y wife and a brother that loved him despite it all, John was a force to be reckoned with. Cementing his victory was Kim&#39;s vapid purrs as she struggled to contain the 9 inch python that plunged in and out of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;More, more, <I>more</I>!&quot; John cried out, still not satisfied as his cock continued to ram his wife, before quickly pulling out and grabbing Kim&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;John, I- OH!&quot; Kim gasped, forcefully brought closer to her husband who threw himself into a frenzy, lapping at her crotch and sucking which sent her eyes rolling back. <br />
<br />
Kim could hardly remember a time when her husband wasn&#39;t a wanton sex fiend, but, there was a tiny voice in the back of her head, buried underneath all the satisfaction that maybe... There was a time that her husband wasn&#39;t as much a beast as he was now? That things were more... Different? Whatever doubt in her head was put away in a darker place as John slammed himself into her rapidly, causing her to screech in erotic joy before climaxing into his hungry mouth.<br />
<br />
John smirked, every vein pumped adrenaline and blood as he satisfied his wife to the degree she was in, before looking up at his handiwork and licking his lips smugly. Kim made some light, airy moans and giggled, brain absolutely shot while John proceeded to gently tease her inner thighs... Kissing and brushing his stubble against them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hail to the king, baby.&quot; John spoke, his voice deeper and nearly booming as he peered back up to his darling wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm... Nngh...&quot; Kim gurgled. She lazily rubbed circles onto her nipples before sighing with relief, hair wild and sweat dripping nigh everywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s too bad,&quot; John said, getting up as Kim grunted out a confused &quot;Hm?&quot;. <br />
<br />
She beheld his glorious figure, one to shame Adonis as he rose up, gently positioning her once again, before the 9 inch treasure flopped onto her sloppy wet slick.<br />
<br />
<I><b>&quot;Because I&#39;m not done with you yet.&quot;</I></b> To Kim&#39;s excited gasp.<br />
____________________<br />
<br />
Simon groaned in exasperation, he looked tiredly over at the clock and noted the time: 12:45 AM.<br />
<br />
It had been almost an hour and a half since John and Kim&#39;s fuck session and though he wasn&#39;t always a night owl, he wouldn&#39;t mind getting some restful sleep. Their last run lasted until 3 am where John finally tuckered himself out to wake up past noon, and Simon prayed to whatever deity that presided over men would allow him the grace of John tiring himself earlier.<br />
<br />
He could not help but feel uncomfortable over the situation that had happened. His father wasn&#39;t supposed to be like this... So... Manly and strong... and,<br />
<br />
Simon quickly took the image of John smugly flexing his muscles in his face out of his head. He shouldn&#39;t be seeing his brother like that- wait.<br />
<br />
His heart was pounding in his ear as he recalled how slightly vague the memories of John as his father was becoming. He remembered growing up in two different worlds, one where he was 12, and then... His current age...? But it didn&#39;t make sense, John was... Different, yes, but was he <I>actually his father?</I> The only thing he could recall for a father figure was John reminding him to do his homework, and, the way he wasn&#39;t picked up for in an argument with...<br />
<br />
Simon came to another conundrum: Did he have a sister...? He seemed to recall someone that lived in the house with him, John, and Kim... But couldn&#39;t put his finger on it. Unbeknownst to him, the Chronivac took advantage of the confusion, pushing his original sister Nichole out of the equation and inserting her into a neighbor&#39;s home, all the while maintaining a minimal degree of awareness that she was close to the Andersons.<br />
<br />
Confused and overwhelmed, Simon sighed and rolled out of bed as Kim screeched for the umpteenth time and left his room. Clearing his throat, he crept down the stairs in tune to the noise so as not to arouse his brother more than he already was and quietly maneuvered into the kitchen as the vibrations gently rocked the house.<br />
<br />

<br />
John sighed with relief as the fuck session came to an end, surpassing his daily record of an hour of nonstop sex and totaling a full hour and forty five minutes. Kim had drifted off to sleep, incoherent and reeling as John fell across from her, running his fingers through the grooves of his muscles and smirked to himself.<br />
<br />
Fuck.<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
He was John Anderson, IFBB extraordinaire, fuck beast of America. Fuckin&#39; A.<br />
<br />
He leaned back, putting his head behind his arms before taking a deep whiff of the sweat and sex that was laden on him, and fuck was it the good stuff. Life was good when you grabbing it by the horns and fucking it, he mused, grabbing the remote control and flipping the tv on.<br />
<br />
<I>&quot;Welcome to the Chronivac!&quot;</I> Chirped the TV as the program whirred to life. John was about to give a quizzical look, but the tv continued.<br />
<br />
<I>&quot;Greetings [John], [Anderson], are you enjoying your current changes? The Chronivac [patent pending] delivers the most intuitive and user friendly controls in all of reality alterations. Want to make your body more attractive? Simply select the subject you wish to change, press the corresponding button, and within seconds, minutes, or days, you can alter whatever you wish within range of the remote!&quot;</I><br />
<br />
John huffed, reality alteration? Get real. He caressed his pecs, &quot;These were made by hard work and dedication&quot;, he chuckled, bouncing them with ease.<br />
<br />
<I>&quot;Are you enjoying your recent change? Records show a last change was:<br />
[John], [Anderson], from [salary man] to [pro-bodybuilder].&quot;</I><br />
<br />
John snapped to attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is this thing talking about...?&quot; He said under his breath.<br />
<br />
<I>&quot;Voice recognition, analyzing... Okay, you asked &quot;What is this thing talking about?&quot;, The Chronivac was used by [Simon], [Anderson], to transform reality and change [father] [John], [Anderson], with a (role swap). Original result would have been [John], [Anderson] to become [Simon], [Anderson]&#39;s son over the course of days. New user registration changed course of original result, creating current results. Would you like to make a change?&quot;</I><br />
<br />
John couldn&#39;t fucking believe it. Was Simon supposed to be his... Son? Was that why he couldn&#39;t help but feel weird about things? Was that the doubt in his head? That he used to be his father...? There&#39;s no way, he could remember raising Simon and saving money up for college and...<br />
<br />
<I>&quot;Would you like to make a change?&quot;</I> The tv chirped again, snapping John&#39;s brain back to reality... Or, whatever this was. His heart was pounding, and he couldn&#39;t grasp what truly was real, what was wrong, he... He...<br />
<br />
He just wanted to forget about this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure, erase the old John.&quot; He said, confidently. <br />
<br />
<I>&quot;Okay, you said, analyzing: ...&quot;Erase old self&quot;. Warning: Erasing old realities will instill the current reality as the base reality. Those aware of the previous reality will no longer have memories of the original life. Are you sure you wish to continue...?&quot;</I><br />
<br />
John paused for a moment. <br />
<br />
Did he really want to go back to being a dad to Simon? A probably out of shape, non-sex fiend father who was corny and had no real wins in life but a stable paycheck? He glanced down at the award winning physique that made him John. He peered over to the shifting Kim who had slept with a satisfied grin on her lips. He thought about Simon, who seemed to have found a good footing and a good shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
<I>&quot;Analyzing... Okay, you said, &quot;Yes.&quot; ... Initializing...&quot;</I><br />
<br />
________________<br />
<br />
Simon sighed, gulping down water as he racked his brain over the changes taking place. Who had the remote? Who was changing what? What can he do without his memories, would he still be Simon or would he be some... Imposter Simon?<br />
<br />
What about his fath- His fa- His... Simon paused, the word coming to his mind was a foreign one. <br />
<br />
&quot;Father&quot;?<br />
<br />
Simon scanned his memories for his father, but strangely, he could not come up with an image of one. It was always him, his brother, and his milf of a wife who Simon was always doted on by. Sure, it was an odd family growing up and only having an older, buffer brother to rely on, but in a weird way, Simon could only think of John as his brother. Then again, maybe a brother is as good as having a father...<br />
<br />
But then what was he worried about...?<br />
<br />
Simon looked into the window and saw his own reflection gazing back at him as the Chronivac made the last few mental edits on his mind. What was old and unneeded had to be replaced, updated, renewed.<br />
<br />
Simon smiled.<br />
<br />
He had to make sure he put in extra work so his big bro wasn&#39;t gonna be so big anymore on stage. He looked down, satisfied, before flexing his modestly impressive biceps, and feeling his cock raise in anticipation. It wasn&#39;t a secret that he had a good figure, John made a lot of work being the way that he was but, Simon wasn&#39;t going to be left behind. There was something else that did come up in his head... He was looking for something, something that maybe got John to where he was now. Something with a remote, with a &quot;C&quot; in the name.<br />
<br />
Sounded like a vocabulary word he had heard in school one time. Simon shook his head, wasn&#39;t the time. Now was the time to focus on real stuff, out muscling his brother, and checking out some new cuties when they hit the gym again. He licked his lips hungrily at the thought, his neighbor Amy was always into John, but both brothers were getting ass everywhere and Simon laughed dumbly as he made his way back to his room. <br />
<br />
Maybe he&#39;d convince the cute gym receptionist to feel up his muscles, before sending John pics of his new lay. Didn&#39;t matter if they were a guy or girl, what mattered was how many fucks either brother had while lifting at the gym.<br />

John smiled, looking back at the tv screen as the Chronivac saved its edits.<br />
<br />
<I>&quot;Thank you for choosing the Chronivac, we would like to show our appreciation by mailing you a complimentary device replacement to continue your usage! Feel free to continue using this program or the device to continue your usage, and remember: What is changed can never be rearranged if you erase the original reality. Have a great (altered) life!&quot;</I><br />
<br />
John reached down and slowly ran his hands on his cock as the python sprung to life. 10 inches. He slowly rubbed the member to its peak. 11 inches. Wouldn&#39;t be long now before his-- 12 inches.<br />
<br />
John grunted, feeling his balls churned as they warmed and grew slightly to accommodate his tool. His chest began to amass itself as it pressed against his chin, the rest of his body following suite.<br />
<br />
Oh, yes, he would be <I>enjoying</I> his new life now.</p>
