<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff gulps, “I… I don’t know if you will believe me, kill me, trust me… b-but I’ll try my best to explain,” he says, the teen takes a deep breath, before continuing, “I’ll start by explaining where you are: you are in a human dominated world. Creatures like you do not exist here, only in fantasies”.<br />
<br />
The Dragon huffs, but continues to eye Jeff threateningly, “so, let me get this straight: I am the only living Dragon in a human dominated world,” it asks, it snorts when Jeff nods, “how did I end up here, you better make sense, or…,” it growls threateningly.<br />
<br />
Jeff gulps, “I… I brought you here,” he says.<br />
<br />
The Dragon narrows its eyes, “I don’t smell any sort of magic coming from you,” it says.<br />
<br />
“Th-that is because I don’t know magic,” Jeff says, “but… I have a device, which you could call “magic”,” he says.<br />
<br />
The Dragon tilts its head, “a device?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “pl-please don’t attack me,” he says, “I’ll just slowly reach into my pocket to take the device out. It is not a weapon,” Jeff moves slowly, taking out his phone. “Th-this is called a mobile, it is what we humans use to communicate with each other over a long distance,” he explains.<br />
<br />
“Okay, but what has a… mobile… have to do with me being here,” the Dragon asks.<br />
<br />
“I… I got a received a program today,” Jeff says, “which is able to do… magic”.<br />
<br />
The Dragon tilts its head, “what kind?”<br />
<br />
“Mostly transformation, but also mind control and hypnosis,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“And you say, you used that itty bitty thing to bring me here,” the Dragon asks, “how… and WHY did you bring me here?”<br />
<br />
“I… I have a picture of you at my house,” Jeff says, “I am a huge fan of Dragons, since I was a kid, I always wanted to meet a Dragon and always wished Dragons to be real, s-so I scanned the picture and converted the “fantasy” into reality… in other words: I brought you to life… I made you real,” Jeff stops to let it sink in.<br />
<br />
The Dragon shakes his head, he lets out a growl, “now I am even MORE confused,” it says, “so, I am supposed to be someone’s… creation, and because YOU like Dragons so much, you thought it would be a good idea to… bring me to life?”<br />
<br />
“Th-that’s correct,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
The Dragon grumbles, “and I doubt that you thought about the consequences?”<br />
<br />
“Consequences,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
The Dragon lets out a snarl of frustration and rolls its eyes, “REALLY? WHY ARE HUMANS SO DARN STUPID,” it roars, the Dragon the snarls at the boy, “how am I supposed to survive in a world which is dominated by humans? How am I supposed to “reproduce” if I am the only Dragon here?”<br />
<br />
“I… I didn’t think about that,” Jeff admits, “I… I just wanted a Dragon-Friend”.<br />
<br />
The Dragon lets out a snort, then it bursts out into laughter, “a “Dragon-Friend”? Humans and Dragons can’t be friends, kid,” it says.<br />
<br />
“Why,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
The Dragon rolls its eyes, “look at me,” it says, “I am a huge monster which will be hunted down by your kind! How am I able to survive with the lack of food source?”<br />
<br />
“B-but don’t Dragons have magic abilities,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
The Dragon snorts, “I know I do,” it says.<br />
<br />
“C-could you… well… um… tr-transform into a human,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“I could,” the Dragon says, “but why would I want to do that?”<br />
<br />
“Y-you’d be able to hide in plain sight,” Jeff explains, “a-as a human, y-you wouldn’t need to eat so much. I-if you were human… I… I could teach you our ways, show you all kinds of cool stuff”.<br />
<br />
The Dragon thinks about Jeff’s words, “I will have to think about that first,” he says, “for now, I would prefer to learn more about YOU and your so called “device”. I want to see that… picture of me… I want to know how you know my name”.<br />
<br />
“Th-then… what if you shrink down,” Jeff asks, “maybe to a size you be able to fit in my palm? I’d tell my parents that I got a new “toy”, so that they do not suspect a thing. When we are in my room, you can either stay tiny or grow a little. All of the answers are in my room, and I think it’ll make more sense once you have seen everything”.<br />
<br />
The Dragon thinks about it, “you know, kid,” it says, relaxing and taking on a more normal stance for the first time, “I don’t think I know if I should trust you, but… I do admit, I am curious…”.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks up at the huge creature, “I h-hope you will learn to trust me,” he says, “I… I really do not mean you any harm! Please… Ice…,” he adds.<br />
<br />
The Dragon looks closely at Jeff, it then sighs, “fine,” it says, “I’ll give you the chance,” Jeff then notices the Dragon starting to shrink as it starts to walk over to the boy. When it reaches Jeff, the beast is half the size of Jeff, its head just reaching Jeff’s hip. The Dragon continues to shrink, until its not bigger than a toy.<br />
<br />
Jeff kneels down and holds out his hand, the Dragon then steps onto the teenagers hand, and Jeff straightens up, “wow,” Jeff exclaims, “amazing! You really look majestic, even in this form”.<br />
<br />
“Kid,” the Dragon says, “stop talking and take me to your “house”, before I change my mind!”<br />
<br />
<br />
“R-right,” Jeff says and starts to walk to his car, “s-sorry, I… I am just excited! M-my name is “Jeff”, by the way,” the Dragon just lets out a huff.<br />
<br />
When the Dragon spots Jeff’s car, he asks what the “thing” is, Jeff explains, that it is a way for humans to travel. The Dragon, at first, is skeptical, “it is not alive, it has no wings… how is it you supposed to move,” it asks. Jeff chuckles, and explains how a car works, when the teen inserts the keys into the ignition, and turns them, the “thing” roars to life, causing the Dragon to jump in surprise, almost falling off the passenger seat. Ice asks, if Jeff brought the “thing” to life, like he did with him. Jeff shakes his head and explains how a car works, the teen continues to explain various things to the shrunken Dragon, while driving home.<br />
<br />
By the time they arrive at Jeff’s house, Ice the Dragon learned quite a bit, like the weird structures, which he calls “man-caves” are actually called “houses”. By now, it has become dusk, and when the street lights come on the Dragon asked how it is possible for light to appear without fire, Jeff then explained electricity to the Dragon.<br />
<br />
“My god,” the Dragon says, as Jeff parks the car in the garage, “my head is hurting from all the stuff you told me. Humans really are weird, but I must admit, your kind is also pretty smart”.<br />
<br />
“Sadly, not all of us are smart, some are stupid, like me, some are dangerous and some are insane,” Jeff says as he carries the Dragon through the house, luckily his parents were still out and his little brother has locked himself in his room, probably playing some video games.<br />
<br />
Ice has never seen a house before, let alone the inside of one, the Dragon is still trying to make sense that he had come from a drawing, and that this kid brought him to life. Ice shakes his head, he really has a lot to think about.<br />
<br />
“Here we are,” Jeff then says, opening a door and stepping inside, “this is my room. My ceiling is about to meters high, so if you plan to grow, it would probably be best if you’d grow to maybe a meter?”<br />
<br />
Ice looks around the room, “hm…,” he says, “I think I’ll stay this size for now, I might knock stuff over with my tail and wings”.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jeff says, “I’ll set you down on my desk, that is where I have left the picture of you, before heading out”.<br />
<br />
The teen walks up to his desk and lowers his hand, Ice steps onto the desk and looks down at the drawing, his head tilted, “so… this is me,” he asks, “this is where I came from?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yeah,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ice shakes his head, “so crazy,” he says, he then looks up at Jeff, “listen… Jeff, I don’t know if I should thank you for bringing me to life or be mad”.<br />
<br />
“I… I’m sorry for not thinking this over,” the boy says, “I… I just thought it would be cool,” Jeff lowers his head. Ice senses that the human seems upset, Jeff sits down on his chair, he looks down at his desk, “I… I just wanted a friend… a special friend,” he mumbles, tears start to form in his eyes, “wh-why am I so stupid…?”<br />
<br />
Ice watches the boy, the Dragon starts to feel sorry for Jeff, ‘the kid really didn’t think at all,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I can tell that he feels bad about it. I should stop being mad at him, I guess he learned his lesson’. Ice nudges Jeff’s hand with his snout, Jeff looks over at the tiny Dragon, “listen Jeff,” Ice says, “you might have done something foolish, but I must admit it does feel nice being alive”. What Jeff is unaware of, is that Ice is planning something, ‘come to think about it, I could have some fun. I can use my hypnosis on this foolish boy, and also transform him into anything I want! If I decide that I enjoy this life he gave me, I just might consider make him my female, together we’ll soon rule the humans and this world will be dominated by Dragons,’ he thinks to himself, grinning inwardly, liking the idea, but Ice decides to not push it and take his plan in small steps: one thing at a time! For now, getting Jeff to obey him is top of the list. The thought of dominating this foolish human boy, causes Ice to shiver in excitement, which goes unnoticed by Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles a little, “s-so you are not mad at me,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, I was,” Ice admits, “but now that I got to know you better and the reason why you did it, I kinda understand. I decided to at least give this life a try, maybe I might enjoy it, besides I am rather curious, and would like to learn more about your kind. So, I decided to do what you have suggested earlier”.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks at the Dragon, “wh-what do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Ice flaps his wings, he flies off the desk and lands in the middle of Jeff’s room on the soft carpet. The tiny Dragon looks up at the human, “just watch, and you’ll see,” he says.</p>
