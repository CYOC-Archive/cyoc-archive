<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A bit tired herself, Diane Tucker laid down next to her new sister werecheetah for a few minutes. It had been a very long day already, and Diane feared this would be the last decent moment of rest she got for a long time to come, what with the DA wanting to press criminal charges against her.<br />
Diane couldn&#39;t help putting a furry arm around Rikki Plunkett&#39;s sleeping form, watching the now 14 year old girl&#39;s chest rise and fall in peaceful slumber, her nipples still hard atop her budding breasts.<br />
<i>HOW?</i> was the big question on her mind, not understanding most of what her sister-in-law said in the hallway. The fur, the tail, and other werecheetah features she could comprehend, but not the beginning curves of womanhood, let alone the breasts and the fact there was no longer a male penis between Rikki&#39;s legs.<br />
Plunkett&#39;s new fur did feel nice against her own. While Diane was sexually active, since all weres have a higher libido to some extent, she was not as &#39;experienced&#39; as some, for she was more choosy of who she laid with, wanting to find that <i>special</i> someone, if not the right one for the moment.<br />
Diane&#39;s mind wandered. <i>I&#39;ve never been a lesbian, or even bi-curious, but if I do wind up going to prison and there are only other females there, maybe I&#39;ll at least grow to enjoy it...</i> she thought to herself, holding Rikki closer to her for a while longer.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s done!” finally shouted Diane, as she gave Rikki Plunkett a final kiss (for now?) and reluctantly got off the king sized bed of the hospital safe room, where her new sister werecheetah laid.<br />
Doctor Kathy Tucker and her head nurse came into the room at the announcement, to see two werecheetahs smiling at each other while holding paws, for Diane&#39;s shout had jolted her awake. Then Rikki looked up and said, “Thank you. For everything.”<br />
“How do you feel?” asked the Doctor, as her nurse started checking Plunkett&#39;s vitals.<br />
“Great!” exclaimed Rikki. “Have you ever woken up from a dream to discover the reality was even better?”<br />
“No. Can&#39;t say I have,” admitted Kathy.<br />
“That&#39;s what this feels like,” said Rikki, her smile still big on her furry muzzle.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Diane had resumed her human form and was getting dressed, when Rikki said, “Hey. Where&#39;s my big sister going?”<br />
That made Diane stop and smile, before coming back to reality and saying, “I&#39;ve still got things I have to face. The DA and all. I know you keep saying you aren&#39;t going to press charges, but he&#39;s got ideas of his own.”<br />
“What?” asked Rikki Plunkett in disbelief, as she started to rise. “Let me talk to him. I&#39;ll—”<br />
“You&#39;re not going anywhere except back in that bed to rest young lady,” said Kathy, as she started to push the werecheetah back down.<br />
“Yes, ma&#39;am,” said Rikki, fully cooperating.<br />
<br />
Now completely dressed, Diane paused to hug Kathy. “I&#39;m sorry for everything, but I hope it all turns out for the best,” she said, almost tearfully, before she left the safe room.<br />
Kathy stood and stared, watching the door close behind her sister-in-law, before she turned to her assistant and asked, “Can you start the preliminaries by yourself?” while she grabbed her cellphone out of her lab coat.<br />
<br />
Outside in the hallway, Diane Tucker faced everyone that was still there before she entered the safe room to complete Rick Plunkett&#39;s transformation into Rikki and her induction into were society. Her big brother and legal guardian Frank Tucker stood next to his lawyer, while Moon Lake District Attorney Simon Theopod stood next to the two police officers that brought her to the hospital to save Rick/Rikki Plunkett&#39;s life.<br />
“Can we please have a moment before you take me away?” asked Diane, while looking at her big brother.<br />
“Despite whatever you might think of me young lady, I&#39;m not the villain here,” began Theopod. “I&#39;m just trying to uphold the law and protect <i>all</i> the citizens of Moon Lake, weres AND normals. But actions do have consequences, and—” then his cellphone rang.<br />
Upon seeing who it was trying to reach him, the DA ordered the officers to keep an eye on their prisoner while he sought a secluded stretch of hallway away from the safe room to take the call.<br />
“This ain&#39;t enough, but I&#39;m sorry for everything,” said Diane, as she hugged her brother.<br />
“I know sweetie, but we&#39;ll get through this too, somehow,” promised Frank, as he returned her hug.<br />
<br />
Their solitude was interrupted by one of the officers. “Excuse me, but I&#39;ve got to ask. I was with the Town Chancellor this morning when she first interviewed the patient about his intentions in Moon Lake. If I&#39;m understanding all of this right, are you saying that forty-something normal adult male I saw this morning is now a 14 year old <b>FEMALE</b> werecheetah?”<br />
“Yes, sir,” was Frank&#39;s reply, to which the officer&#39;s only response was an unsuppressed shudder, an action that was not lost on the DA as he continued his phone conversation.<br />
<br />
It seemed like an eternity, but only closer to a half hour, before Doctor Kathy Tucker and her nurse rejoined the others in the hallway.<br />
“Well?” asked the DA before anyone else. He had long since finished his phone call and was now waiting for the Doctor&#39;s diagnosis before saying anything further.<br />
Kathy&#39;s nurse left with a new batch of specimen tubes to examine in the lab as the Doctor said, “I&#39;ll still need Doctor Frances Twist to confirm the mental and emotional side of things, but RIKKI Plunkett is a healthy 14 year old female who has just successfully experienced her first transformation as a werecheetah. Even her maidenhead is still intact.”<br />
“What&#39;s a &#39;maidenhead&#39;?” asked Diane, as the others looked at Kathy in disbelief.<br />
“Something I&#39;ll explain later, in private,” said Frank.<br />
“Can I talk to him, I mean—her, Plunkett?” asked DA Theopod.<br />
“Not right now,” said Doctor Tucker. “After everything she&#39;s been through today, the poor thing&#39;s tired and needs her rest. We&#39;ll be moving her from here back to the room across from my lab soon.”<br />
“I see,” replied the District Attorney, before he turned to face the policemen with him. “I want a 24 hour protective detail on Plunkett established immediately. She&#39;s not under arrest, but I want her kept safe and undisturbed by the general public until whatever furor and curiosity there might be surrounding this case disappears.”<br />
“Understood, sir. We&#39;ll get on it at once,” promised the first officer.<br />
<br />
<i>Better get this over with,</i> thought Diane, before she approached the DA and asked, “What about me?”<br />
Theopod stared at her for a moment, before briefly looking at the Tuckers, and then said, “As I started to say earlier young lady, actions have consequences. Whether you know it or not, you&#39;re now responsible for that new life in there.”<br />
“Meaning?” asked Diane, uncertain what was about to happen.<br />
The DA turned to the Tuckers and said, “I&#39;ve been on the phone with the Mayor&#39;s office. After an emergency session of the Town Council, they would like to keep this matter as confidential as possible, especially in light of Henry Wendz&#39;s involvement. Therefore, first off, unless Plunkett has made other arrangements before hand about his, I mean <i>her</i> new life—”<br />
“None that I&#39;m aware of. He&#39;s an only child with no remaining family and fully intended to relocate to Moon Lake when Samantha Twist told him he&#39;d have to become a were to protect our secret. As a cryptozoologist, he originally came here hunting Sasquatches,” revealed Frank.<br />
“Sas—&quot; began the DA, before stopping to shake his head in disbelief. &quot;We&#39;ll discuss arrangements in a few minutes, but not knowing what else to do, I&#39;m gonna take your wife up on her suggestion of adopting Rikki,” replied Theopod.<br />
“I can help with that,” said Tucker&#39;s lawyer.<br />
“Good. I&#39;ll help you <i>quietly</i> expedite matters. As for you,” said the DA, before turning his attention back to Diane. “You will now bear the full responsibilities of being a big sister to that young lady in there. I&#39;ve heard about your truancy situation, so for better or worse, the two of you will be resuming school soon as Freshmen. I want you to be a positive role model to her and make sure both of you grow up right to become good, outstanding citizens of our community. And remember this: there is no time limit in filing charges against you for violating Statue 1-A. If you ever get so much as a jaywalking ticket within your lifetime...”<br />
“I&#39;ll be good! From now on!” promised Diane.<br />
“See that you do,” said the DA, before he actually smiled.<br />
“Does this mean I&#39;m free to go?” asked Diane.<br />
“Yes. With them,” replied the DA, pointing to Frank and Kathy. Then Theopod turned to face Kathy. “Doctor Tucker, being a normal myself, for better or worse, any previous dealings Moon Lake had with Henry Wendz was before I became District Attorney. If you can spare me a few minutes to bring me up to date? Especially if you might know why the Town Council is so... concerned about him?”<br />
“Certainly,” said Doctor Tucker, before leading him down the hall so they could talk privately.<br />
<br />
Alone in the hallway, except for the officer now guarding the safe room door and the family lawyer, Diane turned to Frank and asked, “Does any of this make sense?”<br />
“Kind of,” said her big brother.<br />
“What all does a big sister have to do? Being the youngest, I&#39;ve never been one before,” pointed out Diane.<br />
“Tell you what. When Kathy&#39;s free, why don&#39;t we all grab some dinner and discuss the future. Together,” suggested Frank, noticing that the clock in the hospital hallway said it was approaching eight pm.<br />
“I&#39;d like that,” replied Diane with a genuine smile on her face, before hugging her big brother again.<br />
<br />
