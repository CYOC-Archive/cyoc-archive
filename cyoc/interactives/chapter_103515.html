<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Luke stared down at himself, he suddenly heard some boys yelling and laughing somewhere close by.  Curious, he looked around and saw a door marked &#39;Locker Room&#39; that hadn&#39;t been there before.  Puzzled, he went over and listened - this was where the voices were coming from.  He pushed it open and looked in.  A cloud of steam rolled out as he stared into what had to be the locker room of a boy&#39;s gymnasium, and an old one at that.  Not that things were beat up or worn, but something about the place looked like it was out of an old movie.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Brent!&quot;  A tall, skinny boy about his new age was toweling off outside the steaming showers, not at all shy about his nudity.  &quot;You gonna shower or just stink the rest of the day?&quot;  More boys were coming out of the shower, also naked.  Most were tall, though a few seemed more muscular.  None were as tall as he was.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Brent!  Just because you&#39;re hung like a horse means you wanna smell like one.&quot;  Another boy, at least a head shorter than Luke, grinned and came over as he dried off.  When Luke didn&#39;t respond, the boy reached out suddenly and grabbed the end of Luke&#39;s enormous cock, which had slipped even lower as he started to get aroused.  &quot;Come on, let the Beast out for some air.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke flushed bright red, which made some of the boys laugh while others looked surprised.  He let go of the door as he swatted the smaller boy&#39;s hands off his flopping foreskin.  Still, he was really interested in seeing the rest of this new body, and most of the other boys were naked.  He tugged off his uniform top first, and then kicked off the huge sneakers and socks before grabbing the waist of his shorts and sliding them off.  A large athletic supporter underneath had failed to keep his massive sexual parts in check, with a scrotum larger than his fist dangling on one side and the thick cock hanging out the other.  <br />
<br />
One of the boys threw him a bar of soap, and he caught it expertly with one hand as he walked into the long, open shower.  There were a lot of eyes on him, or at least his crotch, as he lathered up.  He had continued to become aroused, and now a solid foot of penis swung between his legs, the tip just starting to push free of his thick, loose foreskin.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Poor Beast.&quot;  The smaller boy who had grabbed him came back in the shower and stroked the shaft like it was a pet dog.  &quot;I bet Brent hasn&#39;t paid any attention to you since this morning.&quot;  The added contact brought Luke to a very impressive attention, though he was too flustered to really appreciate it, especially when many of the other boys laughed.  His own hands wrapped around the foreskin and he started sliding it up and down.  The sensations were very powerful and he grunted and arched back as he masturbated there in the shower with a large audience cheering him on.  &quot;Beast!  Beast!  Beast!&quot;  He was aware of the smaller boy pushing hi lightly so he turned to face the far wall of the shower, and of the growing pressure.  Then he arched back with a shudder as a thick jet of semen shot out and hit high the opposite wall.  Another splattered lower, and the third and final ejaculation mixed with the pool of water on the tile floor.<br />
<br />
The smaller boy reached up and touched the first blob as it began to slide down the wall.  &quot;I think we have a new record!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beast!  Beast!  Beast!&quot;  The mix of cheering and clapping made Luke flush again, but this time he felt more pride than embarrassment.  In fact, he was pretty proud of the Beast, and made sure he faced the locker room as he finished his shower.  The smaller boy threw him a towel as he finally stepped out,  A couple of boys slapped Luke&#39;s butt as they passed, and the smaller boy scowled.  &quot;Hands off!  He&#39;s mine and Penelope&#39;s!&quot;  That brought more laughter.<br />
<br />
Luke wasn&#39;t sure what to do next.  Looking around, he realized his uniform was gone!  But then he saw the clothes piled on a bench in front of a locker.  The smaller boy headed over to stand in front of the locker next to one with &#39;Brent Jordan&#39; printed on some masking tape that had been there a while.  Another piece of tape identified the boy as Mike Sanford.&#39;  Mike opened his locker and then looked back at Luke.  &quot;If the Beast is too much for you, I&#39;ll swap clothes.  I&#39;ll be glad to get Cs instead of As if I can keep Penelope happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Swap clothes?  Luke blinked as he came over to stand next to Mike.  Wait a minute.  He should have changed back as soon as he took off the uniform!  Mike chuckled.  &quot;Being a little slow goes with the body.  You stripped in this world, not the costume shop.  You can put the uniform back on and go back through the door over there and you&#39;ll end up back there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke stared.  &quot;You know about the costumes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  You aren&#39;t the first one to try Brent&#39;s uniform on.  I&#39;d put it on in a heartbeat, but it doesn&#39;t do anything as long as you are Brent.  If we put on each other&#39;s stuff at the same time, we&#39;ll swap.  Interested?  That way you can check things out and not look like a freak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke frowned, feeling confused.  None of this made any sense, and he was having trouble concentrating.  He wasn&#39;t smart, but he was real good at basketball.  Mike was smart, and good at sports, and other things.  Part of Luke&#39;s mind realized he was starting to think like Brent.  Maybe he should put the uniform back on and go back to the shop.  Or he could see what it was like to be Mike.  His smaller friend was still tall for 15, dark and handsome.   Then again, the Beast was pretty impressive.  Did he really want to give that up?</p>
