<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...Is by retrieving the key from their room. I mean, where else would you be able to find the key? The electronic lock remover didn&#39;t work, so your only option is to return to their room and find a way to unlock your smiling mask. <br />
<br />
The only issue is that the two girls will definitely recognize you. They&#39;re the ones who sealed you inside your feminine prison so they&#39;ll remember what your doll mask looks like. But you can worry about that later. <br />
For starters, you need to get as much information about this room you&#39;re in before you leave because you&#39;ll most likely not be coming back.<br />
<br />
Having already looked over the contents of the lockers, you turn your attention to the two doors on the opposite wall. As you begin to walk over, you quickly steal a glance in the mirror once more to gaze into the warmness of your mask&#39;s red eyes. The gentle allure of her smile. The way her blonde hair swirled around her as she glided away off the edge of the mirror. You swore that you could see her hips swaying with each step. <br />
&#39;It must be this blasted padding&#39; you thought to yourself, letting out a frustrated growl from your gag. <br />
<br />
Rather disappointedly, the first room was only a maintenance closet. Mops, brooms, rags, even some wrenches and screwdrivers for repairing machinery. You found it odd that a fairy&#39;s home would seem surprisingly mundane and... well, normal. At least as normal as wandering around a mansion with maids with immobile faces while being stuck in a full-body skinsuit and doll mask can be. Perhaps a fairy&#39;s magic isn&#39;t as powerful as you initially thought. <br />
<br />
The second door revealed something slightly more interesting: an office. A tidy desk with a chair occupied the right side of the room while the left side was dominated by a large set of filing cabinets. A board that was labeled &quot;Requested Tasks&quot; was across from you and it seemed to be filled up with many sheets of paper pinned to the board. You pulled the door closed behind you, only having to open it again to pull some hair from the mask that had gotten stuck outside. <br />
It was strange to feel the weight of hair on your head and yet none of the sensations that went along with it. Your latex-covered hands weren&#39;t impermeable; you could still feel some sensation through them. You found it interesting that so far you hadn&#39;t had to brush the wig&#39;s hair out of your face. You suppose you can chalk that up to how the hair was set on top of the mask. You almost find yourself appreciating the craftsmanship of your new face. <br />
<br />
You tried pulling on the handles of the filing cabinets, but found them all locked. Scanning the room quickly, you couldn&#39;t detect any keys that would open them. However, you did find a folder sitting open on the desk. Inside, you found what looked like someone&#39;s notes on a person. You let out a little gasp as you recognized the person in the ID photo at the top of the page. It was Red!<br />
<br />
Suddenly interested, you began reading the page:<br />
<br />
Subject: Faye Hartright (formerly Felix Hartright)<br />
Sex: M<br />
Age: 18<br />
Reasons for Mansion Occupancy: Experimentation<br />
History of Subject: Initially male, is now female in most aspects save for having a penis. Brought to Nym in order to check on vitals and procedure of trial. Recently took a new name (noted above) and is becoming more comfortable in their new form. <br />
Additional Notes: Has a penchant for the maids. Likes dressing up in similar fashion. Friends with Clarissa Umbreit (formerly Claude Umbreit). Well liked by staff. Routinely takes showers at 7.<br />
<br />
The rest of the page seemed to be torn out.<br />
<br />
So Red&#39;s name is really Faye? And they have a penis?! <br />
You shuddered a bit inwardly. You kinda thought she... he?... was cute up until now. Now you weren&#39;t sure what to think.<br />
I suppose that would make who you dubbed &#39;Blue&#39; Clarissa. And it seemed like Faye liked dressing up as the dolls. That would explain why that had all that stuff that you were now wearing. <br />
It looks like Faye was initially a prisoner here, but now they&#39;ve grown to like it here. Perhaps in another time, they could&#39;ve helped you escape. <br />
<br />
You mince over to the task board and start looking at the various requests. On each paper pinned up it listed who requested a service from the staff, what time the appointment was, where it was taking place, and what they wished the maid to dress as, even going as far as to list specific clothing and even eye color of the masks. <br />
<br />
You realized that these were the perfect opportunity to go around the mansion unnoticed. Anyone who saw you would just assume you were going to whoever requested one of the maids. But which one should you do? Ideally you&#39;d want one that&#39;s close to Faye and Clarissa&#39;s tower, but without knowing the layout of the mansion, you can&#39;t tell which ones are close and which ones aren&#39;t. You begin looking at the names of the people requesting.<br />
<br />
Varss, Caeldron, Jia, Amaris, ...Faye!<br />
As if in response to reading her name, the vibrating panties you were wearing starting up again at a low frequency. You instinctually jolted and arched your back in response to the assaulting pleasure. You felt yourself slowly sinking to the floor, slipping into a dreamlike state as you allow the feelings to take hold of you. You feel your eyes rolling back as your eyelids close, but as you slip into slumber, you take solace that you doll mask&#39;s eyes will remain open. Never to falter in their unwavering gaze...<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You groggily come to your senses, faintly aware of the suctioning noise of latex peeling itself off the tile floor. You don&#39;t know how long you&#39;ve been out for, but you feel different somehow and it&#39;s not just the fact that the vibrating has stopped. Slowly getting to your feet, you can see the dim reflection of yourself in the sheen from the metal filing cabinets. Still in the same latex outfit, still in the same skinsuit and mask. And yet somehow, you feel... lighter. Nothing looks different. You shake your head, feeling the familiar weight of the mask on your head. It has been a long time since you&#39;ve had some sleep, maybe you just got the rest in that you needed. <br />
<br />
Nothing in the office looks changed, and opening the door to the repair room, nothing appears different in their either. Wait... No, something is different. The belts that you had left on the floor are now gone.<br />
<br />
You feel a wave of panic sweep over you. Does someone know you are here? How long has it been? Is Nym on his way? Your chest tries to heave and intake air as you&#39;d like but it is restricted by the corset and the latex pushing on your chest. You feel yourself begin to get a bit light-headed so you force yourself to calm down. <br />
You start to reason with yourself that even if someone did see you, it&#39;s still in your best interest to get a new look and take a task and leave. <br />
<br />
Finding Faye&#39;s request still on the board, you unpin it and take it with you back into the repair room. Looking over the requirements for the maid, you find there to be next to nothing. The only thing it wants is for the doll to be wearing an &#39;evening dress&#39; and to be at their room at 6:00 PM. Doing some quick math in your head, 6:00 will be one hour away from when your location is revealed to Nym, which means you will have one hour to find the key for your mask, release yourself, and find a new place to hide. It seems a bit tight, but you think it&#39;s possible. <br />
<br />
Now, it&#39;s time for you to change your appearance. Well, at least as much as you can. You find an empty locker and open it up. First, you peel of your gloves and throw them into the locker. Curious, you run your hands across your body as you&#39;ve never felt yourself wearing this while you weren&#39;t wearing the gloves. You find you really like the sensation of the smooth fabric of your hands touching the equally smoothness of your the fabric over your hips accentuated by padding. Next, you gently take off your panties, carefully guiding the insertions out as you do so, and marvel at your feminine appearing crotch. Where once you might have had a penis, all you see is a thin slit in between your legs. You find your hand slowly going towards the opening before you hastily pull back your hand. You almost got sidetracked there.<br />
<br />
You find yourself at a halt as you consider your top and the attached stockings. There&#39;s no way to remove this part of your outfit since you&#39;ll never be able to force the top over the larger head of the doll mask. An evening dress would most likely show off your cleavage (a statement you&#39;re not too proud to admit), but it will be obvious that you&#39;re wearing the latex outfit underneath. If only there was a way to just cover up the latex entirely since you can&#39;t take it off. <br />
<br />
But there is a way. It slowly dawns on you that what you need to do is don a new skinsuit. The fabric will completely cover your body and effectively make it appear that you&#39;re not wearing anything. As you consider that, you feel a bit turned on to the fact that underneath the beautiful doll ready for a lovely evening you&#39;re creating will be a cheerful blonde doll in a very suggestive outfit. And underneath that... <br />
<br />
You&#39;re shocked out of your thoughts by another in your surprise that you don&#39;t feel an erection at that. Maybe you&#39;re becoming used to this stuff now. You&#39;re not quite sure how that makes you feel. Walking to the other lockers, you begin considering what you want your finished creation to look like. You unfold a new skinsuit from a pile of them. While it feels similar to the one you&#39;re already wearing, this one seems a bit pinker than the paler one you have on now. This color should better help hide the discoloring the black latex underneath might give. However, the skinsuit comes with a hood, which you realize that this means that you have to stretch this hood over your doll mask. <br />
While that doesn&#39;t seem like that big of an issue, you realize that even if you put a new wig or set of eyes on your doll head, the face will still be easily recognizable to Faye and Clarissa as the one they put you in. If you don&#39;t want to be found out, it means you&#39;re going to have to wear another doll mask over your own.<br />
<br />
You begin looking out over the array of doll masks in front of you. Eventually, you decide on one that seems a bit childlike. The shape of the eyes makes the face seem younger and with the eyebrows arching in an embarrassed way, a pinkish blush on the cheeks, and a shy smile, you begin to fall in love with the persona that seems to be radiating from the mask. You can feel yourself slipping into the role already: a young servant that is made to wear something mature and slightly revealing. This role is perfect for you! It doesn&#39;t require for you to act outgoing. In fact, it encourages you to be polite and subtle with your movements, looking to hide away from prying eyes. <br />
With a ash-brown wig with straight bangs and straight hair that would reach your shoulders as well as a set of cobalt colored eyes. The plainness of the hair should lend itself to the suggestion of a shy doll.<br />
<br />
With the appearance of your new look picked out, you begin looking for a complimentary outfit. You wanted an outfit that would show off a little skin, but not too much. Eventually, you settled on a satin red and black dress.<br />
The dress itself was a lovely deep red that had a lacy black trim. The skirt of the dress fell in nicely set tiered layers that would show a bit of your legs. Luckily, you had a pair of simple black stockings that would cover your legs. A sash with a finely decorated print on it would go around your waist to be tied off at your back. A small black bow of ornamental purposes hung off the front of the sash. The dress was sleeveless and while the majority of the breasts would be covered, the front of the bodice had a &#39;v&#39; of black lace that was see-through. You found a set of gloves that covered up to the wrist that was made of the same material to match. <br />
To tie your theme together, you gathered some accessories to complete your look. A lacy, ebony choker with a fake rose on the front with some ribbon tassels you found looked nice and you found a matching headress that had roses and even thorns adorning the top.<br />
<br />
As far as footwear goes, even though you weren&#39;t keen on wearing high heels, you thought that it would be the best direction to go in. Plus, your inexperience in walking in them can play into your persona&#39;s role. A blood-red pair with a matching rose with thorns seemed to be the perfect option.<br />
<br />
Now, you just had to assemble your new &#39;doll.&#39;<br />
<br />
As you picked up your new doll mask, you found a key sitting underneath the hollow inside. A few experimental closings of the mask&#39;s shell and unlockings reassured you that the mask could be removed. You tried it on your mask, but alas, it didn&#39;t work. Now the question begging to be asked was: where would you keep this key? Your dress doesn&#39;t have pockets. <br />
<br />
You found the answer to be almost humorous as you asked yourself: &#39;Where else would a woman keep things?&#39;<br />
The best place to put the key would be in between your breasts after you put your second skinsuit on. That way the key can be somewhere close by and easily accessible.<br />
<br />
With everything ready, you began to dress.<br />
<br />
You start threading your feet through the fabric legs of the skinsuit. While the suit you have on already had individual toes, this one thankfully just ended in a kind of sock. Sliding the fabric over the garters and crotch, you stood up as you pulled it over your breasts. By now, you had it over your neck and were just waiting to slide the hood over your oversized doll mask. Placing the ends of your mask&#39;s blonde hair into the hood, you started pulling it up. <br />
Immediately as you stretched it towards the top of the mask, you felt the suit begin to pull very tightly across your body. Your crotch in particular felt very much under pressure as you struggled to tug on the hood. Gnashing your teeth on your gag, you gave a might heave and managed to pull the hood over the doll mask, pulling it down into place. You felt yourself shaking all over, your muscles protesting in agony. Your body felt very tight all over as the new skinsuit squeezed you in a close embrace. Pulling the zipper to the top of the hood, you began to relax and looked at your self in the mirror. The new skinsuit seemed to only accentuate the curves on your body and made your breasts appear bigger. You silently laughed at the sight of the blonde doll gazing out from the full body skinsuit.  <br />
Now, you can start dressing yourself.<br />
<br />
Having forgone a bra, you pull on a simple black pair of panties as well as your new stockings. Placing the top of the dress over your head, you allow it to gently descend upon you as it falls into position. The top of the dress seems to stretch slightly to accommodate the larger heads of the doll masks. Tying of the sash and adjusting the gloves, you look at your bare shoulders in the mirror. If this was really your skin, you might feel a bit bare and awkward. But you felt nothing but confidence in the outfit you put together. Linking the choker around your neck, it was time for the mask.<br />
<br />
Opening the resin shell once again, you aligned the new mask over your old one. This one was noticeably missing a penis gag. Why couldn&#39;t you have been stuck in this one? Closing the halves and hearing the click of a lock, you slid the key down in between your breasts. If you had a bit of a vision problem before, it was only made a bit worse now. It wasn&#39;t much, but you could feel the slight loss of vision you received around the edges of your view. Placing and attaching the wig to your new mask, you used a brush you found to brush out the locks of your hair admiring the way the strands seemed to slightly curl at the edges. <br />
<br />
With setting the headress upon your head and stepping into the high heels, you gave yourself another look into the mirror. The transformation was remarkable. Whereas your previous form seemed to be quietly content, this face seemed to give off innocent embarrassment. You tried holding yourself in a plethora of ways, trying to find the perfect one to encapsulate who you imagined this doll to be like. You settled on one where you kept your body turned inwards, hands together, head slightly angled down, and maybe your hands would reach up to play with a strand of hair. Your heart swelled in the accomplishment of what you&#39;ve done and you felt excited to play a new role. <br />
<br />
After deciding that the best way to hold the task paper was to clutch it with both hands in front of your breasts, you opened the door to the hallway and began to set out on your journey to free yourself.<br />
<br />
Wobbling a bit as you tried to get the hang of the heels, you focused on coming up with a plan of what to do once you got back into Faye&#39;s room.<br />
As you turned a corner in the large mansion, you froze as someone else was in the hallway. They seemed to be in a hurry as they were briskly walking in your direction. You felt a stab of panic as you recognized the person to be...</p>
