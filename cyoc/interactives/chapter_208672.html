<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This very evening, I wish for my girlfriend&#39;s new boyfriend Thomas to start his new life as my penis.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; asked the genie, unsure.<br />
&quot;Of course! That&#39;ll be the perfect vengeance! He wants to fuck my girlfriend? Fine! He can do it by being in the front row!&quot; he laughed.<br />
He then thought a bit more about his wish. He wanted to make sure that jerk Thomas would suffer. <br />
&quot;Thomas will become my penis but he&#39;ll stay conscious and he&#39;ll keep his senses. He&#39;ll even be allowed to speak in a tiny squeaky voice when I permit him. He&#39;ll barely be able to move too, unless it&#39;s the normal reflexes of my own penis. That&#39;s my wish.&quot;<br />
&quot;Very well, master,&quot; said the genie.<br />
Damon could not wait for the evening to arrive.<br />
<br />
Around 7 p.m., Thomas was playing video games in his room. Tomorrow, at school, he&#39;d see Monica, his new girlfriend. A real hottie that went well with his brand-new car! She had dated a loser before but now, he would get into her panties in no time! He wanted to jerk off just at the thought of it. But suddenly it felt like he was falling, tumbling through the floor, his head spinning. What was happening to him? <br />
When he came to, it was with a start and with complete confusion. He was lying down in the dark, on his front. Where was he? In the hospital? But the fabric below him didn&#39;t feel like sheets. And he did not have a blanket around him. And when he tried to move, he could barely twitch. Was he paralyzed? He prayed it wasn’t the case. And... And what was that awful smell of sweat and why was the atmosphere so moist?<br />
&quot;Help!&quot; he cried out. <br />
Why was his voice so tiny, so squeaky and so puny-sounding? Then, a flash of light and he was staring at... At the huge face of that loser Damon? <br />
&quot;What...?&quot; he stammered.<br />
&quot;Welcome to my boxers, jock,&quot; smirked Damon. &quot;How are you liking your new body?&quot;<br />
Thomas looked around to see immense close-up of fabric and if he darted his invisible eyes on the side, he could see huge testicles and tufts of coarse pubic air. At least the air was more breathable now.<br />
&quot;What...?&quot;<br />
&quot;I always thought you were an arrogant dick. A jock who was self-absorbed. And now you stole my girlfriend? Well, you can now be a dick for real and you&#39;ll fuck Monica. As my own penis in person!&quot; he laughed.<br />
He turned to the size-length mirror and Thomas was greeted with the vision of a naked Damon. He tried to move but he could only see the penis in the mirror twitching slightly and the balls where he used to have feet move with apathy and great effort. <br />
&quot;How?...&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, a genie granted my wish,&quot; simply said Damon.&quot;Now be a good little wee-wee if you want me to change you back.&quot;<br />
Appalled and disgusted, Thomas tried to move yet again, alas producing only wore twitching.<br />
&quot;Mmmm... I like that,&quot; moaned Damon. &quot;Wait for me. will ya?&quot;<br />
He undressed and settled on the bed. There, he proceeded to poke his virile member and fondle his balls. To his utter embarrassment, Thomas felt himself expand and straighten. But it was the caresses and tickling that brought him to become straight like a pole and leaving Damon to see his penis standing to attention.<br />
&quot;Oh, I see what you like you greedy little wee-wee,&quot; he teased. &quot;Now how about a little tease?&quot;<br />
He grabbed a feather that had escaped from his pillow and glided it across his penis, making Thomas giggle and squeal, begging for it to stop. <br />
Of course Damon did not and let Thomas throb and especially twitch madly.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll call you Twitchy,&quot; he said with glee. &quot;Come on, now, Twitchy, let&#39;s make both of us happy.&quot;<br />
Thomas, now Twitchy, could feel and even taste the pre-cum dripping from what was his mouth now and it was horrifying. Not as much as the feeling of pleasure that mounted ever more and that led to blood pumping into him and releasing a flow of semen, both boys shouting their pleasure out. For Thomas, the pleasure was mixed with shame at having felt it in the first place. Also the taste of semen was absolutely horrid. <br />
Panting, Damon patted Twitchy and congratulated him. He then ordered him to be silent as he went to the bathroom. For Thomas, the acrid taste of urine was barely better and less worthy of mortification than that of semen. Luckily, Damon also took a shower and Thomas was happy for that. Then, as Damon went to bed, he patted his crotch and wished Twitchy sweet dreams. Thomas could only remain nestled in his groin, completely unhappy.  <br />
<br />
The next few days saw Twitchy, formerly Thomas, barely conscious most of the time. Life was so boring as a penis! Conversations muffled through layers of clothes and not interesting at all! It&#39;s not like he could participate, or if Damon would let him. So he dozed off, waking up only as Damon relived his bladder, the only view he got being the toilet bowl and water. Worse was the smell as Damon defecated! He knew he&#39;d only get the taste of piss and the smell of grain perspiration was omnipresent. Couldn&#39;t people let fresh air in more often down there? Or wash their crotch several times a day at least? Then, in the afternoon and the evening, Damon would masturbate and the real torture would begin for Thomas. Damon teased him mercilessly, calling him Twitchy as often as he could and enjoying his protests in his ridiculous squeaky voice. To his shame, Thomas could never resist the slight caresses, brushes or light scratches and he was quick to get erect. And release and climax was great, even if he hated it afterwards. Above all, the taste of cum was awful, like spoilt milk or rotten food.<br />
<br />
Another awful experience was when Monica and Damon got together again. Monica had been distraught at the disappearance of Thomas, and Damon swept in to shower her with comfort, gifts and nice empathetic words. Of course she&#39;d fallen for it, all the while Thomas had been made a silent forced witness of the courting amidst researches looking for him. And when Monica and Damon had had sex, the experience simultaneously great and horrible. Seeing her naked had been a treat, and then she had stroked him delicately and put him right into her mouth! Pure joy! Her teeth and tongue pressing and gliding along his new body had made him gorge himself with blood, his feet-scrotum pumping sperm in happy anticipation. The slender fingers of Monica deftly stroked Thomas and when she pushed him in, he was happy to do so, in spite of the horrible smell of her vagina, which he had come to realize was common to everyone. He himself had to live right next to an anus. The view as he was plunged in was very nice, though and the prospect of entering fully a girl&#39;s womb felt like pure bliss. And it really was, as he was wrapped tight into the lips and muscles of Monica&#39;s vagina. A few jewels had convinced mMonica to not demand a condom but to take a morning-after pill instead. Thomas had to agree that it was a good idea from Damon. Without it, there would be a layer of annoying rubber between him and Monica! And then the walls hugged him tighter and Damon thrusted joyfully. Thomas felt himself harden and expanding slightly with the blood rushing into the organ he was and he twitched madly as the climax was getting nearer. He ejaculated forcefully and plentifully, briefly making him proud of his achievement producing so much virility and fertility, the cum mixing with Monica&#39;s own vaginal fluids. Thomas relaxed, still twitching a lot, and tasted the fluids of Monica that were infinitely better than make semen, even if the smell was still horrid. He could hear the other two panting above. <br />
When Monica went away to take a shower, Damon patted him playfully with a smirk.<br />
&quot;Good job, Twitchy.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Thomas would have liked to penetrate Monica often, but most of the time, Damon preferred playing with him, as he could not see his girlfriend all the time. Worse still, Damon liked conversing during their common masturbation and he teased him endlessly, in both senses of the word. He loved hearing Twitchy&#39;s little squeaky voice as he protested or as he twitched uncontrollably each time his shaft body was tickled. To make his Twitchy&#39;s skin more sensitive, Damon had taken the habit of going to a professional waxer and if the lack of hair limited the horrible smells, the caresses and tickles were a lot more intense, increasing Thomas&#39;s sensitivity, pleasure, desires but also shame after the act. As he was half-conscious while Damon slept, Thomas wondered how long he&#39;d have to live like this. Damon seemed in no mood to change his mind...</p>
