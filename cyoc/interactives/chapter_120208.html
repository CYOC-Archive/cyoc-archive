<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You&#39;re the one, the man of prophesy that will bring about an end to the humanity and end their terror of waste on the lands and seas.&quot; The fish-girl said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what the hell is that supposed to mean?&quot; You asked and suddenly the fish-girl grabbed your leg and dragged you underneath the water&#39;s surface. You began struggling and trying to get free, but eventually you grew tired and passed out unconscious in the ocean thinking,&quot;This is how I go.&quot;<br />
<br />
You thought you were dead, but you heard a voice and opened your eyes to see a blurred figure, but then closed your eyes in a daze. You then heard the voice again, but it was clearer this time and you could make out a vague humanoid creature in front of you. You shook your head awake and you saw the mermaid floating underwater with a large group of mermen and mermaids behind her. You then realized that you were still underwater and began freaking out.&quot;What the hell?!&quot; You yelled, but your voice sounded deep and booming, and your yell was more of a roar. <br />
<br />
Suddenly these weird restraints appeared around you and held you to the ground and you couldn&#39;t move at all. &quot;What the hell?! What&#39;s happening?! Where am I?! How can I.....I can breathe here. What...what did you do to me?&quot; You asked looking up at the mermaid that pulled you under.<br />
<br />
Moments later a merman swam over to her side and said,&quot;You do know that I can eliminate this creature at anytime by your order princess.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why bother trying? He can&#39;t be harmed using most natural means, and his body doesn&#39;t age. Most of all I have a perfect plan to reclaim what the land has taken from us. Dismiss the crowd and let me speak to him personally, the restraints aren&#39;t necessary.&quot; The mermaid from before said<br />
<br />
&quot;But princess I...&quot; the merman began and the mermaid shushed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a direct order, this &#39;beast&#39; as you put it has human life experiences, and it will understand reason over violence.&quot; The mermaid said and the merman took one look at you and sighed and waved his hand.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the restraints came loose and you could move again and the first thing that you did was take a look at your body. You were shocked by what you saw, you had the body of a giant serpent at least twice times the size of any whale. You had a reptilian muzzle filled with thick teeth that were all sharp and carnivorous, and you had a forked tongue that was capable of picking up scents. Your hands and feet were now webbed and all claws that were digitigrade and made for swimming. You also had a large tail with vertical fin that ran partially up your underside and stopped at your rectom, and the top half of the vertical fin ran all the way up to your head. You could breathe underwater now and your neck was extremely long and flexible enough for you to view your own gills. You continued inspecting your body shocked until you heard the mermaid speak up,&quot;Do you realize what you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything at all, it is within your very soul that this would happen when you returned to the ocean. Tell me, have you been to the ocean at all in the past before the time we met yesterday?&quot; The mermaid asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not at all, but please elaborate on what happened to me.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a leviathan, a biblical beast that has the strength to destroy the world in large numbers. This isn&#39;t your first time either as a leviathan, you existed many years ago, but were struck down by an archangel. Now you have returned and now the angels agree with us in the sea to reawaken you to assist us in desolating humanity. We only ask of you not to destroy all life as you once tried centuries ago.&quot; The mermaid said<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No no no no, that wasn&#39;t me, I don&#39;t remember that ever being me. I don&#39;t want to hurt anyone at all, and why do you want me to desolate humanity?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;You are the only one capable now, you can breathe both in air and sea, and prevent the humans from causing anyone waste than what they already have. The world is dying, and you were once the cause of that, but no more. Humanity has made themselves a far more formidable threat than you ever were, and now that your mind has expanded its horizons of intelligence, you will be much more valuable as an ally and you won&#39;t solely rely on your instincts like you once did.&quot; The mermaid said<br />
<br />
&quot;Humanity is bad in terms of pollution, but the sea is rising because of them, and you still haven&#39;t told me who you are.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as humanity exists their pollution will cut off the vital oxygen in the water and tear a hole in the planet&#39;s atmosphere. After that happens, no species will thrive, and we&#39;ll all perish as a planet. My name is Coralline and I am the princess of my people...of the sea.&quot; The mermaid, Coralline said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...when you put it like that you&#39;ve got a strong point. Also your name is a pun with coral, but in a way I personally think it compliments you, makes you seem cuter almost. But then again I am literally a giant sea serpent ha! But in all seriousness it&#39;s an honor to meet you personally, but I would respect you more if you didn&#39;t pull me underwater like you did.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks...I guess, but my actions were necessary. If you would transform on land then you would be noticed without a doubt. The largest cave is in the abyss here is just big enough to fit you inside and you know how big I was compared to how you saw me before.&quot; Corralline said<br />
<br />
You remembered how big she was when you were human and now she was only as tall as you head, and you could literally swallow her whole if you so wished it. &quot;I see....Princess Coralline, if you can give me a place to stay beneath the surface here then you have my full support whenever you need it. I can sense my instincts and they should tell me how to survive, and I&#39;ll avoid harming anything sentient until you give me the word to strike.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate it, and your home has already been established.&quot; Coralline said pointing in the a direction, and you saw an extremely large air-pocket and you could fit about two of your giant bodies through it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a submerged cave that formed here naturally, and its roughly ten times your size. It should suit you nicely as there is plantlife within it that provide oxygen and lots of it at that.&quot;  Coralline said<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds pleasant, but where exactly are we at?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;In the deepest part of an ocean abyss near where you were found. Depths here haven been reached by humans yet.&quot; Coralline said<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, well if you need me I&#39;ll be in there. If not there then probably swimming around and doing what every other predator does and hunt.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead, my parents will probably send an escort for you and will wish to meet you eventually, farewell for now leviathan.&quot; Coralline said<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, and farewell to you too. I hope that I didn&#39;t cause too much of an uproar from my reaction here.&quot; You said then leapt towards the submerged cave and swam up to it. You poked your head inside the cave and took a deep breath with your lungs and climbed into the cave. You looked at your body once more and noticed that you had some sort of algae growing on your body. You didn&#39;t mind the algae much, but if almost felt soothing in a way. Your cave seemed spacious, but what do you do now?</p>
