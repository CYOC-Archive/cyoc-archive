<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Juan was eager to use his new phone app which held such promise, and he wanted to not let this creature get stuck in the house and die in a few days due to lack of water and food...<br />
<br />
He pulled out his app and set the creature to remain asleep until its been outside for at least 3 minutes. To test the efficacy he picked the lizard up and gently tossed it on Jeff&#39;s bed. It remained unconscious. Juan could now leave it outside and walk away but really wanted to use his app more.<br />
<br />
Since it was mating season and this little guy had already been sidetracked from his procreation mission, Juan figured it would be fun and okay to mess with it a little. Looking at the app showed it was a feral male but Juan&#39;s plans changed when he saw it was exactly 2 years, zero months, zero days old. &quot;It&#39;s your birthday little guy?! Awe, happy hatch day buddy! We have to do something really special for you!&quot; Juan said giving Jeff&#39;s back a gentle stroke.<br />
<br />
Juan went to current status and set the creatures hydration and hunger to full, and then began going through all the Chronivac Mobile apps skills and abilities. He turned off things associated with humans and the list shrank drastically. Juan pumped up the seemingly negligible hunting, survival skills, and mating instincts confused how the lizard survived this long. Then he noticed the creature was just 6 months past sexual maturity and still had a few inches to grow to be considered full size; Juan equated him in human terms to a 20 year old who as yet to &quot;fill out&quot; in his maturity.<br />
<br />
Juan smiled... &quot;Well, your day started off rough and in an inhospitable territory, but you&#39;re going to wake up the Mega Chad of lizards.&quot; Juan went to the lizards physical traits and pumped up its strength and size, gave it better regeneration should it lose its tail, made it faster, enhanced its eyesight, and maxed out its attractiveness to the opposite sex. Juan saw the lizard lengthen and thicken but didn&#39;t notice much else happen to his dismay, but trusted that he is now the young Brad Pitt of Southern Alligator Lizards.<br />
<br />
Jeff awoke to the warm sun beating down on him, it was pleasant. He took a moment to get his bearings, the Chronivac must have teleported him because he is outside and can smell water nearby. Where there is water, there are usually bugs, and where there are bugs female lizards will be searching for food. Before Jeff knew what he was doing he was moving toward the source of humidity. He hadn&#39;t planned on getting this into being a lizard but procreating was on the forefront of his mind. Talk about lizard brain!<br />
<br />
He arrived to find a small garden pond surrounded by flowers, bugs, and as he had hoped females. Rather than diving in, he climbed a tree trunk and scouted the area. One male was copulating with a female, several other males were encroaching from the east and there was a lone female hunting for food. <br />
<br />
In a blaze of speed Jeff rushed the other males on the east, scaring them off, circled back and began to fight with the copulating male, Jeff won finding the other male decently smaller and weaker than himself and assuming he was only 1 year old and confused why he would be wasting his energy if he hadn&#39;t even fully matured yet. In reality the lizard was 4 years old and Jeff was just that much more powerful now. <br />
<br />
Jeff approached the female and everything happened like a dance, she moved, he moved they wrestled and fought and Jeff found it more of a turn on then anything he had ever encountered, he mounted her despite being unsure if the first lizard had managed to fertilize her, but he wouldn&#39;t have any chance if he doesn&#39;t shoot his shot. <br />
<br />
After several hours of guarding her Jeff&#39;s human brain realized that this female may have already been impregnated and guarding her from other male&#39;s is less productive than finding a female who hasn&#39;t mated this season. Jeff released her to find the other female who was hunting earlier, his keen eyesight led him to a beetle which he instinctively devoured before realizing what he was doing. Jeff wanted to be disgusted but the thought was pushed aside as he remembered he was after that other female...<br />
<br />
The afternoon sun was beating down and Jeff realized how little he was thinking, it was as though he was a lizard for 10 minutes though hours had passed. All the in between stuff just didn&#39;t make it to his memory and floated away. Since becoming a lizard he found and defended a premium territory, and had sex... the details of it were already fuzzy like weeks had passed. It was unsettling in comparison to his human memory but he was trying to get laid so thinking about that could wait. Wait, didn&#39;t he just get laid? No, that was... hours? days? ago... He just ate, that&#39;s what he just did!<br />
<br />
And so Jeff&#39;s time as a lizard could be recounted as a nature documentary, feeding, fighting, and fucking. As he returns to human he finds things are different, but how?</p>
