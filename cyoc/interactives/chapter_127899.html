<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hannah Buckworth&#39;s eyes were glued to the TV screen. She was busy procrastinating on her bed singing along to Frozen, a movie that Hannah had probably seen one hundred and fifty times since it came out. She was happy that as a woman she was no longer teased by her peers about enjoying Disney films, because even as a boy she had a strong affinity for them, but in the middle of the “First Time In Forever” sequence when Anna first runs into Prince Hans, Hannah heard a knock on her bedroom door. She put the animated movie on hold.<br />
<br />
“Who is it?” she yelled through the door.<br />
<br />
“Hannah, sweetie? We need to talk for a minute. Can you let me in?”<br />
<br />
 The voice belonged to Hannah&#39;s mother. Her Born Woman mother that is, not the pinup model her New Woman father had turned into . “God damn, that will never stop being confusing” she quietly muttered to herself. <br />
<br />
“The door&#39;s unlocked! Come in!” yelled Hannah. <br />
<br />
Light entered the almost pitch black bedroom to reveal Zoe Buckworth. <br />
<br />
Zoe entered, flicked on Hannah&#39;s light switch, and sat down on her daughter&#39;s rose colored bedsheets. Zoe laid down a plate of Oreo&#39;s next to her, which Hannah immediately began munching on. <br />
<br />
“Thanks Mom!”<br />
<br />
“Honey” said the mother very measuredly. “You know that we care about you deeply, your father and I, but we were just talking about you downstairs, about your future, and we were beginning to wonder...is this going to be a permanent situation...you living with us? Your eighteenth birthday was a few months ago. You&#39;re going to be nineteen before you know it! Now don&#39;t get me wrong, you are more than welcome to live here until you finish college, but afterwards...are you thinking about, you know, getting your own place?”<br />
<br />
Hannah laughed with her mouth full of cookies. She finished chewing them really fast and then swallowed. <br />
<br />
“Wow, Mom, that&#39;s really putting things on front street. I&#39;m so sorry. Am I being a burden on you and Dad by still living here?”<br />
<br />
“No!” Zoe back tracked. “No! Not at all. This isn&#39;t about getting rid of you, darling. It&#39;s just that when I just wanted to make sure that the Great Change didn&#39;t ruin your educational plans. Before you, you know-”<br />
<br />
Zoe made a gesture with her outstretched hand, awkwardly trying to emphasize her daughter&#39;s stunning, statuesque beauty...<br />
<br />
“...Before I gained some self esteem” said Hannah, finishing her mother&#39;s sentence for her.<br />
<br />
“Exactly” said Zoe, relieved. She was even blushing. “Exactly. I mean, I get that your social life used to be quite difficult. I know that you were bullied terribly, and now that very same bully is now your loving girlfriend. A role reversal like that isn&#39;t something that comes around all too often. Just don&#39;t let it all go to your head, sweetie. Finish your education. Do something with your life. Don&#39;t just rely on your looks and let that brain go to waste, but as we&#39;ve seen, things can change...”<br />
<br />
Zoe snapped her fingers dramatically.<br />
<br />
“...just like that” finished Hannah.<br />
<br />
“Exactly.”<br />
<br />
“I won&#39;t disappoint you, Mom. Thanks for the Oreo&#39;s.”<br />
<br />
Hannah&#39;s mother hugged her daughter more tenderly than she ever had when she had been Larry, kissed Hannah on the forehead, shut the door behind her, and went downstairs back to the party/ orgy she was having with her wife Greta(Formerly Grant) and the next door neighbors, all of whom were covered in each others spunk. Hannah went back to watching Frozen. <br />
<br />

<br />
When Aziza al-Rashid first became one of the Sorceress Supremes that protected the Earth against all things creepy, kooky, mysterious, and spooky, she didn&#39;t know what to expect exactly. Her life had changed quite dramatically since the Great Change, but mostly in ways that affected other people, such as her parents. The social norms of Saudi Arabia, just like the social norms of all countries, had transformed quite dramatically within two years, with many people, not just born women, giving into impulses that had been kept under wrap due to social pressures. Aziza couldn&#39;t help but chuckle as her former father Farouk, now Sabiha, was led around by the wrist by her now very domineering mother Lutfiyah wherever they went, with Sabiha meekly and submissively acquiescing to her every demand. It was always clear to Aziza when she was a man that her mother had a very strong character and was the one who actually wore the pants in the family, that her father was only the patriarch by default because he was born with a penis. Now there was proof. <br />
<br />
Still, Aziza had expected something more, I dunno...dramatic? Maybe saving the universe from unholy evil? Traveling through other dimensions and interacting with gods with her fellow sorceress Regina Chung, just like they had last year? Perhaps she had read too many American comics as a child. <br />
<br />
“There we go again, daydreaming” chuckled Aziza as she got back to work in her garage restoring an old 1968 Chevy Impala for a client down the street. She was getting quite proficient with magic. Aziza could have fixed the car a snap of her fingers and given the client a free out-of-thin-air puppy to go along with it, but she liked the challenge of fixing things manually. <br />
<br />
After about forty-five minutes, she was finished with her improvements, and just as she wheeled herself out from underneath the car, she saw the ghost of her friend Regina floating in mid air. Aziza immediately jumped to her feet, wiping the sweat off her brow and getting in a combat ready position. Once she realized what was happening, though, she breathed a sigh of relief. <br />
<br />
“Oh thank God. It&#39;s just an astral projection. I thought somebody had broken into my garage.”<br />
<br />
Regina looked quite frightened judging by the expression on her face.<br />
<br />
“Aziza, we&#39;ve got a situation. Very important. Come to my house ASAP.” <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...will do.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a silent pop, Aziza teleported away to go see her magic buddy woman to woman.</p>
