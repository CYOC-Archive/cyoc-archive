<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen was carried over to the table where Melody then took a seat, while still keeping her on her lap. It was very uncomfortable for the both of them, as Jen either was stuck kneeling across Melody&#39;s legs, which hurt, or stabbing Melody with her heels, which also hurt. So Melody quickly set Jen back down onto the floor. Jen then just laid down her head inside Melody&#39;s crotch. Arguably, her favorite place for it to be. And, since she was still satisfied from earlier, it was safe for her to do this; even if her nose was then being filled filled with nothing but the smell of Melody&#39;s cock and ball sweat.<br />
<br />
Jen really didn&#39;t care who or about what the others were talking about. She was more than content with just letting Melody keep petting her head. She was use to sitting like an animal by now too. She felt unusually relaxed for being bare ass naked in the crowded mall. Her tits were not small, so they were hard to miss if anyone were to look at her. But thanks to Kyle&#39;s curse, she was not bothered once about it. No one gave her a second thought  about being naked. There was a unexpected sense of freedom about it.<br />
<br />
After a bit of time spent at the table, Melody stood up and motioned for Jen to follow her. Melody and her friends, plus Olivia all headed out of the food court and into one of the stores. It was a different pet store than the one they visited earlier. This one was much larger, which was expected given it was part of a larger chain. However the reason they aparently entered here was to make use of their animal room. This room was where people could bring their pets to play, either with other animals or to help familiarize them with being around other humans. Jen was led into the room along with the full group, and Melody unhooked her leash, but left the collar still on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, shes off the leash&quot; announced Melody. However Jen didn&#39;t know what she was meant to do exactly. So she just walked over and sat down beside and leaned into Melody&#39;s leg, resting her head on her right thigh. &quot;Oh no you don&#39;t.  I love you too but now you need to go and play with the others here&quot; instructed Melody. Jen let out a single meow, and walked over and rubbed up against her sister&#39;s leg. She also gave her thigh a playful lick, which sent a chill throughout Olivia&#39;s body, and gave her an erection. Jen didn&#39;t notice it though as she was already moving on to the next person. It took her about 5 minutes to fully go around the room. She was groped a total of 3 times, all of them by the 3, normal girls too. On of which commented that it was so unfair that a catgirl has bigger tits than she does, and can go around naked and without a bra in public with no repercussions or back pains to speak of. That girl also was the flattest one here. Jen thought that even Olivia probably had bigger tits than her, and that was before she started her treatments. Out of pity for the girl, Jen gave her an extra rub and flicked her tail in a manner that mimicked giving her a sympathetic shoulder pat. Only Melody caught on to that though. The rest didn&#39;t think anything of it.<br />
<br />
As for the 2 guys. They were overly shy with Jen. They would give her maybe 1 pat  on the head and then pull away their hand, which annoyed her to no end. Jen, out of frustration from being denied another round of petting, took matters into her own paw-like hands and pushed herself into them, while pushing a good amount of her now only 10 or so pounds of body weight into their legs. She even meowed at them and at one point, she even placed her hands on one of their knees, lifting her front half up. <br />
<br />
This was what cause the issue though. The guy she did this to immediately pushed her off of him rather roughly. Jen was not hurt but was a bit startled by his sudden action. It was one of the girls though who spoke up first. &quot;God damn it Eric, she just wants you to pet her. What the fuck is wrong with you?&quot; The other girl said the same to the other guy. It seemed as if the guys were dating the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she&#39;s, well, naked. I am dating you, so wouldn&#39;t this be cheating in a sense?&quot; says Eric. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, it just a catgirl. They practically are the same as normal cats. If this was a real girl, they you would be perfect in your reasoning and actions. But this is a catgirl. Do you get jealous of my neighbor&#39;s dog when I pet him? He has a dick. Do you see him as a threat to our relationship?&quot; Chastised the girlfriend of Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but...&quot; Eric attempts to say but is not allowed to as his girlfriend interrupted him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why would I? Just pet the poor thing already. And yes, you are permitted to touch any part of her. Though I will think it is very odd of you if you suddenly start fingering her. So don&#39;t. Not because I would be jealous, but because it is wierd that you would try to get an animal off like that. I&#39;m not into bestiality.&quot; Clarifies the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit just shut up already you two. It is literally just petting my pet catgirl. And somehow you both still manage to find something to fight about. Tia, stop trying to not appear uncomfortable and perfectly fine with everything. You clearly dislike him touching her for some crazy reason. Is it because she has larger tits than your average sized chest? For god sakes it is a catgirl. She isn&#39;t even a human being. And Eric, don&#39;t ever toss my pet again or I will kill you.&quot; Scolded Melody.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Apologized Eric. Tia just crossed her arms, but didn&#39;t confirm or deny what Melody said to her. Melody called Jen over to her, and she went happily without hesitation. All this time, Heather was just watching intently. She was not able to forget and move on from her misunderstanding about Jen&#39;s body like she wanted to, and now was not looking away in fear she will miss something. Melody realized this, and decided to not change Jen again in public.<br />
<br />
Arter another hour, the day was getting long, and everyone felt it was time to start heading home and went their seperate ways. Everyone but Olivia who followed Melody back to her house to have their &quot;chat&quot; about what happened to Jen. Jen for what it&#39;s worth, was just excited to be home, because soon her &quot;cock lust&quot; would be able to be activated again and she couldn&#39;t help but look forward to it for a change. Now that it leads to 3 orgasms worth of cum being pumped out of Melody and directly into her pussy, Jen was seeing her &quot;cock lust&quot; state in a whole new light.</p>
