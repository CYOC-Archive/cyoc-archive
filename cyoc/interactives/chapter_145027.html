<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Whatever moooves you....any thoughts on who the bridegroom should be?</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been days since Zeb&#39;s conversation with Chad cow,  Harvey the hired hand didn&#39;t seem to know Chad cow was really human, or if he did, he didn&#39;t show it.  He was a sour puss, and griped about being over worked as he hooked up Chad&#39;s udders to the milking machine.  The cold metal - no not cold-cold- Harvey did warm the plastic and metal udder receptacles in his hands before attaching them - he just didn&#39;t warm them enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cannot believe those two sometimes,&quot; Harvey muttered as he futzed with the last udder, &quot;Wanted me to milk this one by hand.  It&#39;s just a cow, why coddle it.  Sometimes I think there&#39;s something unnatural with those two.&quot;  His calloused hand finally trapped Chad cow&#39;s last udder in the device.  He flicked on the machine, as he walked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;MROOO!&quot; shrieked Chad cow, as he felt the tugging at his udder.  <br />
<br />
SQUIRT!   Tug, tug, tug, chug, chug, chug...SQUIRT, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, SQUIRT../<br />
<br />
The squirts were coming faster now, Chad cow&#39;s body quickly adapted to the device&#39;s demands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nearly ten gallons,&quot; Harvey remarked with a whistle, when he returned.  He turned off the machine, collected the milk, but didn&#39;t disconnect the udders.  He came back an hour or two later while Chad cow was munching on his cud, released Chad cow from the device and cleaned it.  This time he only whistled and said nothing.<br />
<br />
Chad cow didn&#39;t hear a human voice, except on the oldie&#39;s radio station that played over the speakers in the barn.  Music made for happy cows according to Zeb, but Chad would have preferred a more up to date playlist. <br />
<br />
It was Saturday.  Chad knew this because a few hours after his morning milking, he heard Zeb&#39;s truck drive up the drive and park.  He knew that Chad clone was with Zeb, as they drew closer to one another, his mind connected with his slutty gay other self.  He felt a bit sick, as the other Chad&#39;s memories filled him, but he exhilarated too. He recognized some of his new team mates from when he&#39;d been human.  Rick was on the team.  Brewster from the rival high school Roosevelt&#39;s Rough Riders, Smythe from Manchester Prep, a few others looked familiar, but the angles of the memories made it hard to recognize Chad clone&#39;s belly was flat over the locker room bench, or his back was across the sauna bench, and the teammates were taking advantage of his spread cheeks.  Both his butt cheeks and face cheeks were spread to accommodate more than one hard cock at time.  It was horrifying to Chad cow, but he felt each of Chad clone&#39;s orgasms, and since Chad cow had been servicing men for weeks now, he had been conditioned to enjoy it, and didn&#39;t feel the pain that Chad cow had expected.  The rush of memories overwhelmed Chad cow.  The men didn&#39;t come into the barn they went into the house.  Suddenly, Chad cow got new memories of gay sex live streaming into his mind, as Zeb, and Jude put Chad clone across their piano bench.  It was odd Chad had been to their ranch before once or twice before his transformation, and for months afterward but he had never seen their living room before.  It looked so normal.  Chad clone apparently had only been in the kitchen and up the backstairs until now too. His eyes darted everywhere.  At last it was over.<br />
<br />
Jude said to Chad clone, &quot;Good boy, Chad.  Now run along, clean yourself up, put on your houseboy thong and jacket, then get your ass out to corral, and set up the bleachers the way I told you.  Watching a bull mount his first cow usually makes men horny, and we&#39;ll have the barbecue, and then the show.  Oh, and fill your bum with extra lube, then put your butt plug in.  The team will probably all want a turn at you after lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad cow didn&#39;t seem to get a response for Chad clone about his mental cries for help.  Chad cow was sure he was going to be the cow bred in the corral today.  He wondered how many knew he was the real Chad besides Zeb, Jude and the Chad clone?  He was anxious all morning.  He tried to bolt away from Harvey, when he was led out of the barn.  He was he was hosed off, and curried in the wash barn.  It reeked of wet cows.  Then he was led out to the corral, and locked inside.  There was feed trough, water trough, and salt lick opposite the bleachers.  He could smell the burning mesquite.  The barbecue would be starting soon.<br />
<br />
He heard some vehicles arriving.  Then as the Chad cow licked his salt lick, his nostrils flared.  He smelled a musky, sexy scent that made his whithers dampen.  There was a bull nearby, a very horny bull.  Chad cow kept replaying all those images and sensations of cocks from Chad clone, but he was going to have a real bull cock inside him today.  He wondered how that would make the Chad clone feel.  Damn, he didn&#39;t know why he was so horny.  He trotted around in circles.  There had to be a way out of the corral.  He wondered who the bull was, it smelled like a real bull.  It had probably been changed elsewhere and brought here in a truck like he had.  Chad cow&#39;s mind raced as he imagined different men transformed into a bull.  He was halfway through his high school&#39;s male population, when it occurred that it could be a rival from another high school, after all a few of them were on State&#39;s football team with Chad clone, Zeb and Jude.  Could one of them had volunteered?  Maybe he&#39;d been cut from the team roster? His mind darted.  Who would have seen the vid of him becoming a bull, and then a cow, and want to become a bull to mount Chad cow?  His mind drifted back to Bruno.  Bruno would want to do it, but he didn&#39;t think it was Bruno.  While Bruno might want it, he wouldn&#39;t do it, Chad was certain.  Wait!  Chad was a cow.  A human male who became a female cow, why couldn&#39;t his bull mate be a human female transformed?  Oh, gawd, how many women had he scorned?  Oh, images of women he had known growing horns, penises, hooves and tails overwhelmed his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Chad cow wasn&#39;t aware of the crowd of young men seated in the bleachers until the scent of the bull suddenly increased, and Chad cow turned to face the scent.  Jude and Chad clone were leading a huge black bull from behind the bleachers toward the corral entrance. Chad cow&#39;s eyes were transfixed on the massive brute.  He turned his attention to Chad clone, as his former self&#39;s twin wore only cowboy boots, a shiny metallic thong, and a tiny half-jacket that looked more like something an organ grinder&#39;s monkey would wear.  Still it showed off his abs, muscular thighs and glutes, and the bulge in the pouch.  Chad cow was suddenly sorry for Chad clone, he knew that the young man&#39;s cock was locked in a steel cock cage under the thong, and would probably never see any action, except when it was allowed to spurt while other guys topped him.  He was a bit creeped out that Chad clone&#39;s thoughts were envious of Chad cow, as the clone closed the gate behind the bull, he admired the huge shaft sliding out of its sheath, and the huge balls swinging under it.  Chad stared at the strong masculine bull presence that was dominated by the intoxicating musky scent.  Catcalls from the crowd.  He was going to be mated.  The bull snorted, and advanced slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moo?&quot; Chad cow lowed softly, as if to ask who are you.  He hadn&#39;t had much contact with the other lowing cows, they were each in their own stalls, and his stall had been separate.  Did he speak cow language now?  Would the bull understand?  Did he-  Oh, crap, he was trotting toward Chad now.  Chad slowly turned away heading for the far side of the corral.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, she&#39;s shy!&quot; shouted someone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let her play hard to get, she&#39;s not going anywhere!&quot; shouted another.</p>
