<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Jayden waits for his sister to return with the clothes, the 10-year-old takes the time to think the whole thing through, ‘actually, it could be fun pretending to be a girl,’ he thinks to himself, ‘come to think of it, I am kind of curious how I would look like as a girl. The only downside is that, if I want to go out, I’d be walking around as a girl in public, but then again, no one, except me, Cody and Lucy know that I’m actually a boy, and if some boy were to start flirting with me, I can simply tell them that I am a boy who lost a bet and that’s why I am running around as a girl’.<br />
<br />
The boy’s thoughts then shift to his friend, ‘though, I am a little nervous and scared,’ he thinks to himself, ‘knowing the reason WHY he wants me to do this as my punishment, I am not sure if it’s really a wise choice to do it, what if he is planning to make ME his “girlfriend”?! I got to be careful, I won’t let him force me into anything I don’t want. Maybe I should call him later and discuss this with him? Or should I just hope for the best and see what happens? Maybe Lucy has an idea’.<br />
<br />
Jayden then hears footsteps coming closer, when he looks up he sees his sister return carrying a large cardboard box, “found them,” the 16-year-old says, setting the box on the floor, she then looks at Jayden, smiling, though her smile fades quickly when she notices the worried look on Jayden’s face, “what’s the matter?”<br />
<br />
Jayden sighs, “well, I am a little nervous and scared,” the boy says, “I mean, what if Cody is planning to make me his “girlfriend”? From what you have told me and now that I understand the way he looked at you, he seems to be obsessed with you. I have no doubt that, once I am dressed as a girl, I’ll look like a 10-year-old version of you!”<br />
<br />
Lucy’s eyes widen when she understands, “I haven’t thought of that,” she says, she then looks down at the box, scratching her neck thoughtfully, “now I too am not so sure if this is a good idea!”<br />
<br />
Jayden sighs, “I have thought about it,” he then says, “even with that being a possibility, I honestly am curious how I’d look like, and to be honest, it could be fun pretending to be a girl, at least for the weekend. I’ll just have to keep a close eye on Cody and if I notice anything funny going on, like, if he’d force me to dress up as a girl, or if he starts trying to kiss or touch me in weird ways, that’ll be the end of our friendship! I am NOT someone’s toy! I was thinking of calling him and making it clear that after the weekend: I am DONE being a girl!”<br />
<br />
Lucy smiles, “you know, Jayden,” she says, “I always thought you were an annoying twerp, BUT hearing those words out of your mouth, and seeing that you are not really happy with becoming a girl, even though you claim to be curious, I can still sense that you don’t really want to do it: I have to apologize for being so repellent towards you”.<br />
<br />
Jayden smiles, “that’s okay, I understand,” he says, “I can be pretty annoying, I admit, I guess it is because I am starting to enter puberty… you know how hormones affect the brain”.<br />
<br />
Lucy chuckles, “yeah, I wasn’t really an “angle” when I was your age and entered puberty,” she says, “listen, how about you call Cody, set things clear, and I’ll record the conversation, that way we have proof if he should claim he never said a specific thing”.<br />
<br />
“You mean, if he’d tell me to dress up as a girl, and claims to have never said it was a one time thing, we’d have proof that he DID agree to this being a one time thing?”<br />
<br />
Lucy nods, “exactly,” she says.<br />
<br />
“I’ll go and grab my phone,” Jayden says and hurries into his room, returning shortly with his phone, “okay, I’m ready to call him!”<br />
<br />
Lucy nods, “make sure to put him on speaker,” she says, taking out a recorder and setting it on her desk next to Jayden’s phone.<br />
<br />
Jayden nods and opens his contacts, soon he finds Cody and dials his number, activating the speaker.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jayden,” they hear Cody’s cheery voice, “hope you aren’t calling to tell me you’re not doing it?”<br />
<br />
“Nope, I just wanted to clear things up, because I have a strange feeling about this whole “dress up as a girl” punishment,” he says, looking up at his sister who winks at him, “so, I just want to make sure that we are on the same page!”<br />
<br />
“Right,” Cody replies, “I guess you did notice how I always stare at your sister, I must admit, yeah… I am kinda attracted to her. It is true, because she is older than me, I know that I have no chance with her, so yeah… that is why I wanted you to dress up as a girl, because you’d look exactly like her, but as a 10-year-old version of her”.<br />
<br />
“I am scared that you’re planning to make me… FORCE me to be your “girlfriend”,” Jayden says.<br />
<br />
“Ooooh…,” Cody says, “listen, you don’t have to be scared,” he then says, “I know I told you to be a “girl” for the whole weekend. I think I over stepped it, so: once you have sent me the picture of yourself as a girl, I promise you’ll not have to stay a girl for the weekend, nor will I ever force you to dress up as one again!”<br />
<br />
“Okay, so you just want a picture of “10-year-old Lucy” to…,” Jayden trails of.<br />
<br />
“Um… y-yeah,” Cody mumbles.<br />
<br />
Jayden snorts, “jesus Cody, I just hope I won’t regret this,” he says.<br />
<br />
“I swear on my life,” Cody says, “I’ll never “ask” you to become “10-year-old Lucy” after you’ve sent me the picture! Please… I… I just want a picture of… “her”!”<br />
<br />
Jayden sighs, “okay, I hope you’ll stick to your promise,” he says, “because if you don’t, you can say “good-bye” to our friendship! Because, I am NOT some kind of toy for you to mess around with! Catch my drift?!”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah! Totally,” Cody says, “just send me the picture and we’ll be done!”<br />
<br />
“Fine, I’ll see you on Monday at school,” Jayden says.<br />
<br />
“Ya! See you Monday,” with that Cody ends the call.<br />
<br />
Jayden looks up at his sister, “well done, Jayden,” she says, stopping the recorder, “we have everything we need. I promise I won’t let anything bad happen to you!”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Lucy,” Jayden says, smiling, he then turns to the box of clothes, letting out a sigh, “let’s just get this over with,” he says.<br />
<br />
After choosing an outfit, a blue jeans, a padded bra, pink socks and a white t-shirt with the image of a unicorn on the front, Lucy has Jayden sit on a stool and begins clipping the blond extensions into the boy’s hair, then applies some make up.<br />
<br />
The whole ordeal takes an hour, finally Lucy straightens herself and puts the make up to the side, “ready to see yourself,” she asks.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jayden says, getting to his feet and walking towards his sister’s full length mirror, his jaw drops and his eyes widen when he stares at his reflection, “hoooooly crap, is that really me?! I… I look so… cute and pretty!”<br />
<br />
Lucy chuckles, “I must say,” she says, “if I wouldn’t know any better, even I would mistake you for a real girl!”<br />
<br />
Jayden turns around, checking himself out from every angle, “I must admit,” he says, “I do like how I look. And I have to be honest, these clothes feel really comfortable! Better than my normal clothes!”<br />
<br />
Lucy nods and smiles, “yeah, boy clothes always look so stiff and uncomfortable,” she says, “girl clothes are much softer”.<br />
<br />
Jayden turns to his sister, “welp, let’s get that picture taken,” he says.<br />
<br />
Lucy nods, grabbing her brother’s phone, “take a cute pose, one hand on your hip, the other straight down, and stick your hip out a little… that’s it, now… smile!”<br />
<br />
After snapping the picture, Jayden takes his phone and looks at the image, “wow… hehe… I don’t even recognize myself,” he says, “haha… I got to watch out not to fall in love with myself!”<br />
<br />
Lucy laughs, “THAT will not happen,” she says, “do… do you mind sending me the picture too? I’d like to keep it as something to remember the fun I had with you!”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Jayden says, he then sends the picture to his sister and Cody.<br />
<br />
The second he had sent the picture his phone pings and he notices a message from Cody, “that was quick,” he says.<br />
<br />
When Jayden opens the message the first thing he sees is an emoji with its eyes closed and blood shooting out its nose, beneath it Cody wrote: “thanks for almost killing me! You look AMAZING!”<br />
<br />
Jayden can’t help but chuckle, “I hope we are even!”<br />
<br />
Cody writes back, “we are! This is all I wanted! Thanks Jayden!”<br />
<br />
Jayden smiles, “no problem,” he writes, “just never ask me to do this again!”<br />
<br />
“I promise! See you in school!”<br />
<br />
“Yep, see you then,” Jayden writes back, he then lowers his hand and looks up at his sister, “I bet 50 bucks that he is now naked and “playing” with himself while looking at the picture of ME,” he says with a scowl.<br />
<br />
Lucy laughs, “I have no doubt about that,” she says, “so, ready to become your old self again?”<br />
<br />
Jayden thinks for a while, turning to look at his reflection, “one part of me wants nothing more than to become myself again,” he says, “but the other part kind of thinks it could be fun staying like this for the weekend!”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s your decision,” Lucy says, “honestly, it would be fun having a “little sister” for the weekend, but it is up to you!”</p>
