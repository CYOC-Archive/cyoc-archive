<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, how does having a... oh, what&#39;s the proper term?&quot; asked Melissa Jenkins, frustrated she couldn&#39;t think of it. &quot;Forgive me if this is wrong, but how does having a mixed breed family work?&quot; she asked Eric Anderson.<br />
&quot;Fine, as far as I&#39;m concerned,&quot; said Eric happily, while giving Julie Stovall&#39;s hand a loving squeeze. &quot;While it originally wasn&#39;t by choice, Dad&#39;s a happy werefox now and the Skulk life/soul mate bond has made his marriage far stronger than it ever was before. Mom loves being a werecat since she decided to stop suppressing the bi-nature of her sexuality. Nate&#39;s the werewolf he&#39;s always wanted to be as far back as I can remember, and I&#39;m deeply in love with my fiance,&quot; he added, before reaching over to give Julie a quick kiss.<br />
&quot;Fiance?&quot; asked Melissa. &quot;Aren&#39;t you two a little young?&quot;<br />
&quot;To get married? Legally, yes,&quot; confirmed Julie. &quot;But see this?&quot; she added, pointing proudly to the single pearl necklace she wore around her neck. &quot;This is the were-mer version of an engagement ring. Eric was originally going to give it to me as a promise token before we declared our love for each other and he let me usher him into were society. But once he became my were-merman and we realized just how strongly we truly love each other, Eric decided not to wait and gave it to me that very day we physically consummated our relationship, knowing full well what it signified to a were-mer because he loved me that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Werebull Trevor Tyson felt a little uncomfortable at that moment. His feelings for Melissa Jenkins weren&#39;t in question. But to go that far, so soon in their budding relationship?<br />
&quot;Except for a werewolf named Ben Twist getting adopted by our Town Chancellor and her wife, I haven&#39;t heard too much about mixed breed families in Moon Lake. Mind you, I&#39;m not knocking the concept, just that you guys and the Twists are the only ones I know of,&quot; he quickly added, while nodding to Eric Anderson.<br />
Then Trevor turned to look at Melissa Jenkins. His feelings for her were quite strong, but they hadn&#39;t developed that far. Had they?<br />
&quot;Mel...&quot; he began, trying to figure out what the right words to say to her were.<br />
&quot;Shh...&quot; Melissa Jenkins said with a smile, while tenderly putting a finger across his bovine lips. &quot;I don&#39;t want to rush anything,&quot; she added. &quot;Some weres might be ready for such a commitment so soon. But even if I was already a were, I&#39;m not sure I am willing to make such a major promise so quickly. Let&#39;s just enjoy the moment and take everything one day at a time.&quot;<br />
Trevor Tyson simply smiled and kissed the finger that was still across his mouth.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
With everything that had been going on, Jennifer Harper wondered if they would ever get to this moment?<br />
Life seemed to have an endless supply of monkey wrenches at its disposal lately, with all of them aimed at her.<br />
But there was no more delaying or denying the future.<br />
She WAS Mrs. Jennifer Jenkins now!<br />
Jennifer was happy and in love with the man of her vulpine dreams.<br />
Furthermore, they were about to enjoy their (relatively short) honeymoon.<br />
After making sure her siblings were secure for the night, the couple left his parents&#39; house and drove to the body of water Moon Lake was named after.<br />
There, they quickly found the cabin that the Skulk were loaning them for the weekend.<br />
After unlocking the front door, Harry smiled as he picked up his beautiful bride and carried her across the threshold.<br />
The moment the front door was closed and secured, Harry and Jenny hastily stripped each other right there and assumed their fursonas, the blonde furred werevixen being lovingly taken by her werefox.<br />
One hot bout of passionate sex led to another, with the couple eventually making it to the bed in the small cabin.<br />
More lovemaking quickly ensued, with the two finally falling asleep in each others&#39; furry arms from sexual exhaustion.<br />
<br />
Jennifer awoke and looked around, not needing to turn on a light thanks to her better eye sight as a werevixen.<br />
She saw by the old analog clock on the wall it was now after 8 that Halloween night. A fact confirmed by seeing nothing but darkness out the closest window.<br />
&quot;Harry, my love. Wake up,&quot; she said, nudging her new husband awake.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he said, groggily looking around.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s time,&quot; was all Jennifer would say, as she went and took another werevixen birth control pill, for she planned for the two of them to be out all night long.<br />
&quot;Come on sleepy head,&quot; Jenny said with a smile. &quot;You don&#39;t want to miss the rest of your honeymoon, do you?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. I don&#39;t,&quot; Harry replied. A smile crossed his vulpine muzzle as his bushy fox tail started happily wagging.<br />
<br />
Closing the cabin&#39;s front door behind them, Jennifer led Harry out by a paw until they neared the edge of the treeline surrounding this area of the lake.<br />
The werevixen looked all around, to make sure they were totally alone, then stared up at the night sky.<br />
The full moon had long since passed for this October, so Luna was just a small crescent at this point; but the sky was practically cloudless and full of stars, like a sea of twinkling lights against a rich black velvet cloth.<br />
&quot;Now then,&quot; said Jenny with a smile, as she looked back upon her new husband. &quot;Let&#39;s recite the vows we really wanted to say this morning, but couldn&#39;t in public because of anyone who might be making a wedding video.&quot;<br />
Then she took a deep and began to speak. &quot;I, Jennifer Harper, having found my one true love, do take thee Harold Jenkins to be my husband in both the eyes of man and nature. You are mine and I am yours, now and forever. My heart is yours and yours alone as our life/soul mate bond declares us one and the same, vixen and fox, until the end of time itself.&quot;<br />
Then she kissed the end of Harry&#39;s nose.<br />
 &quot;Jennifer Harper,&quot; began Harry, staring at her lovingly. &quot;I knew you were the only one for me long before either of us joined were society. You really are my one true love, and I am honored beyond words that you are willing to share the rest of your life with me as my wife. In both the eyes of man and nature, you are mine and I am yours, now and forever. My heart is yours and yours alone as our life/soul mate bond declares us one and the same, fox and vixen, until the end of time itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
The couple smiled as they embraced and kissed once more, his furry body pressed against hers.<br />
Their vulpine tails wagged happily together in unison as they walked hand and hand into the woods for an uninterrupted night of pure marital bliss.<br />
Only the rising sun the next morning would stop the happy couple, and the only indication that Mister and Mrs. Jenkins were in the area at all would be the occasional yips of pleasure carried by the slight breeze that night.<br />
That, and the covert presence of a Skulk security agent who kept a discreet distance from the newlyweds as he carried out the assignment given him by Tachibana no Akane herself of making sure nothing went wrong or disturbed Harry and Jenny on their honeymoon.</p>
