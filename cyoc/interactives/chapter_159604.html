<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was heartbroken and disgusted hearing his first time having sex was watched, orchestrated, and wasn&#39;t even with a girl he was in a relationship with... He glared at Jennifer, &quot;How could you do this to me? That was supposed to be our moment. You and me. Instead you pushed me off on your mother! I was waiting... for you! If you wanted to wait longer I was fine with that, but overwhelming me and your mother with hormones for your amusement is... is... &quot; Jeff quivered with a white hot rage. Sadly, its intensity was significantly reduced coming from the mouth of a 13 year old. &quot;I am NOT one of those guys that will sleep with anything that moves if it will have me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know, and I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Jennifer pouted. &quot;The option presented itself and I was just caught up in the moment! At first I planned on making you forget the whole thing like I did to Shannon, but I realized that was wrong of me too. Then I was just going to let you think you cheated on me, but I realized that would be unfair too... I&#39;m trying to do the right thing by you. I hope you can see that... forgive me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff paused, he was really angry, but part of his mind was still 16 and he could relate to being impulsive and accidentally going too far. &quot;Of course I do...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;m going to get Shannon up and start breakfast, you make yourself into whoever you want to be. But try to hurry, Shannon will think of you as her younger brother unless you change it. She might come in to give you a hard time and that could make things unpleasant for everyone.&quot; Jennifer smiled warmly. <br />
<br />
As she moved to leave, Jeff engaged her in a hug. This was the girlfriend he had been missing, kind, thoughtful, empathetic... Jeff let out a huge sigh of relief. Finally, he thought, we are on the same side again. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, this should be really quick, I just need to load my original profile back up&quot; Jennifer smiled down at Jeff caressing his fiery red hair and walked out of the room.<br />
<br />
Jeff never realized how much of a mastermind Jennifer was up until now, Jeff did know she was cunning, that was one of the things he liked about her. She always seemed to win board games like Settlers of Catan and she always seemed to use, and win with, a different strategy. Jeff realized that perhaps it was the same strategy, but he couldn&#39;t see it...<br />
<br />
Jeff walked over to the computer chair, expecting a quick and simple reversion, as soon as his butt hit the chair his eyes went glassy and he began operating the Chronivac from within his trance.<br />
<br />
Earlier this morning Jennifer anticipated several ways this scenario could play out, but all roads led to her giving Jeff unsupervised access to the Chronivac to avoid a full blown fight and keep her boyfriend while she gets to have all the fun she wants. This was why Jeff suddenly became her youngest at 4:30 this morning, but avoiding physical altercations is just the first step. Jeff could go rogue and undo the masterpiece of control she had set up, that won&#39;t do. So she set up a few stipulations for when Jeff got within 3 feet of the emitter. Obviously he won&#39;t be able to mess with her or Shannon&#39;s profiles. She knew Jeff would probably just want to go back to his boring old life, still being a high school student, still living under his parents thumb and giving in to their every demand.<br />
<br />
No, no, no! Jennifer has had a taste of freedom and power, she won&#39;t let Jeff shove her back into that itty bitty role! She will not be contained! But if he reverts back, she will be expected to fall in line, or they will go back to a literal fight over the Chronivac and deep down, she does want to share her new life with Jeff, he immediately brought her in on it and so he deserves to not be forgotten in her up and coming reign.<br />
<br />
It took a lot of work, but she designed a quiz that the Chronivac will use to decide who Jeff is to become. She set up a number of boundaries for the programs end results and tailored the questions to a teen male. The program will ask a number of questions, and the goal is to find the perfect identity that Jeff will love so much he won&#39;t want to go back, with minimal personality changes. <br />
<br />
If she doesn&#39;t like the result she can force changes on him, but she doesn&#39;t want it to come to that. After seeing her become an adult he was supposed to join her so they could be a family together. After Shannon made out with him he was supposed to beg to become older so she would restrain herself and he could be with her, After he had sex with Shannon he was supposed to throw himself at her mercy but instead accused her of wrongdoing. Ugh, men are so dense...<br />
<br />
The Chronivac accepted the form and pops up a meter showing &quot;Processing 0%&quot;. Jeff blinks for the first time in 18 minutes taking in the screen. &quot;Ah good, that was easy, Ill be back to myself in no time!&quot; He got up and went downstairs, ready for breakfast. A few moments later the Chronivac scrolled through a long list of changes of which Jeff will only be 15% aware of and Jennifer will be completely aware of. Then the changes began and the computer locked until the changes complete, a 30 minute timer appeared and began counting down.</p>
