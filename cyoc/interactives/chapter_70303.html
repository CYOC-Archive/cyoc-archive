<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a start Connor snapped open his eyes and gazed about the room, feeling like something was off. The usual sights that had become familiar over the last eight days greeted him and rolling over onto his back, a strange sensation coming over, he shut his eyes, muttering, &quot;It must have been whatever I was dreaming,&quot; as he slowly started to drift back to sleep.<br />
<br />
Again, he snapped open his eyes again and muttering a couple words, he thought his voice sounded different. Rolling over, he gazed at the posters that now covered one wall, knowing that they hadn't been there the previous evening. After a moment, he sat up and slid out of bed.<br />
<br />
Walking across the room, studying the various images of cute Hollywood actors and a couple boy bands, Connor gazed around room, trying to decide what else was off. But then he spotted his reflection in the mirror and rushing towards the reflection, a moan of dismay escaped him as he gazed at his reflection, realising that it wasn't just his room that had changed, but him as well.<br />
<br />
Over the course of one evening, Connor noted, he apparently aged from eight to fifteen. The nightgown he had gone to sleep in had changed into a pair of light-pink cotton pants, complete with a hole in the back for his tail, and a light-pink open-front t-shirt. Examining the shirt further, choosing to ignore for the moment that he chest clearly stuck out, Connor noted that the shirt appeared to have had buttons at one time, but they had come off. Glancing back at the mirror, he noted his auburn hair had darkened by a shade or two and that his skin was now a shade lighter.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, preparing himself for any other changes, Connor pushed his shirt fully open, exposing his breasts and cupping the two mounds of flesh, he suddenly knew that he wore a B cup and probably wouldn't get any bigger. A glance back at his reflection, knowing that his max height was now five-foot three, Connor took a deep breath and then pushed down on waistline of his pants.<br />
<br />
As he stepped out of the pants, he shrugged off the shirt and standing nude before the mirror, he traced the subtle bumps that marked the four extra nipples that he knew would become more prominent in the days to come.<br />
<br />
Running his hand down his flat stomach, liking how it felt, he paused when he noted that he still had a penis and testicles, but that they appeared to be off somehow and for a moment, he couldn't figure out how. Than it came to him that they appeared to be off because both had a mottled look, almost like reptilian skin. Knowing was because of the pills he was taking, Connor sat down on the chair in front of his vanity without thinking about and leaning back, he spread his legs.<br />
<br />
Greeted immediately by the sight of his vulva, Connor sat forward and running a hand over his smooth legs, gazing at his ridiculous looking male genitals, he muttered, &quot;This is not happening. This cannot be happening,&quot; and standing, he added, &quot;A guy just does not go to sleep, wake up to being an eight year old girl and week later wake up as a fifteen year old girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking one final look in the mirror at his feminine appearance, marred only by the penis and testicles, which would have looked more appropriate on a new-born, Connor groaned and turned away.<br />
<br />
As he collected the shirt and pants he taken off moments ago, he decided that he really was trapped in some sort of nightmare and that he was being punished for something. Redressing himself, both hating and liking how soft the clothes felt against his skin, Connor hugged himself and after a moment, headed downstairs for breakfast.<br />
***<br />
<br />
As he sat down at the table and began fix himself a bowl of cereal his mother wandered in and sitting down, she commented, &quot;You know I don't like you coming to the breakfast table wearing that. Suppose I have guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
Knowing that mother never had guests this early, Connor pointed this out as Hadley sauntered in wearing a pair of boxers and a loose-fitting tank-top that clearly showed off her developing breasts. As the youngest girl poured herself some cereal, their mother replied, &quot;Don't be flippant and try to show some sense of decency, Caeleah. Even if it is before nine am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not wanting to start anything, especially since he was still reeling from the fact that he'd gone to bed an eight year old and woken up a fifteen year old, Connor acquiesced his mother's request and told her, &quot;I wear a tank-top underneath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wanting to point out how Hadley was dressed, Connor immediately turned his thoughts elsewhere and when he was finished with breakfast he headed for the kitchen where he rinsed out his bowl and took the four pills, which his memory stated he'd been doing since he'd been about eleven. Afterward he returned to his room and collecting a pair of bib-overall shorts, a pair of underwear, bra and t-shirt, Connor headed for the bathroom, deciding a hot shower would help clear his head.<br />
<br />
As he ran the water over his naked body and then started to wash himself, learning and remembering that washing his fifteen year old female body was completely different than when he'd been eight, Connor let his mind drift.<br />
<br />
He thought of how he'd first woken up to being a girl. Then, thinking about how he awoken up again to being an older girl, he thought about how he had a dog's tail and ears and how they were connected to an experimental drug he was taking because he was a male-to-female transsexual. He thought about his mother and Hadley and how both acted as if nothing out of the ordinary had taken place. His memories, when he focused on them, showed him events in his life, a lot from the perspective of a girl.<br />
<br />
As he finished up, shut off the water and reached for a towel, Connor realised that everything he remembered said that he not only wanted to be a girl, but that he also enjoyed being a girl. Confused about his, he started to dress, noting that once again his underwear and the bib-overall shorts where loose enough for him to tuck his tail not between his legs, which his memories said he'd stopped doing when his vulva really had started to develop, but down all one leg where is stopped a couple inches shy of were his shorts ended. Collecting his pyjamas, Connor headed back for his room where he continued to prepare himself for the day ahead.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;Should I just accept or should I continue resisting?&quot; Connor took one final look into the mirror in his room and seeing a very pretty young woman, he wondered if life wouldn't be so bad living as a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;But suppose I accept my outcome and I wake up to finding that I've become a male again. What then?&quot; Connor thought and shuddering, he couldn't tell if he'd done so because he could see that far ahead or because his memories stated that to become a male again would be a living hell.<br />
<br />
Running a hand over his body, deciding he did like how soft his clothes felt and how thin they made him look, Connor turned one way, then another, sat down and seeing nothing out of the ordinary, except for the dog ears, which he didn't know how to hide short of wearing a ribbon or hat, Connor once again thought how pretty he looked. Sighing, unsure if he should just accept his fate or continue to resist, Connor turned away from the mirror and muttered, &quot;My name is Caeleah. I am fifteen years old and will be sixteen this October.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure if it sounded right or not, Connor muttered, &quot;My name is Connor. I am fifteen years old and will be sixteen,&quot; but stopped as he found he couldn't remember when he'd been born as a male.<br />
<br />
Disturbed, he moved over to his bed and flopping face down he buried his face in the soft comforter. After a couple seconds, uncomfortable because of the way his breasts were pressed into the bed, Connor turned over onto his side and drawing his knees up to his chest, hugging himself in a fetal position, he asked himself, &quot;Be a girl? Or attempt to find out what I've done to be thrust into this nightmare and find a way back to being my normal fifteen year old male self?&quot;</p>
