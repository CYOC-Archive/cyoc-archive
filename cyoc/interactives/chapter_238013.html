<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author&#39;s note: This is a side story that I will leave open for anyone who wants to explore this route. This chapter will be long.) <br />
<br />
2 weeks earlier: <br />
<br />
Eric and Ella Evan were watching TV. The news was on, and it showed a bank robbery. The Evans could only watch as they saw their son and his team fighting the violet elite. &quot;...and for those just tuning in at 8:34 am this morning the violet Elite hit the bank down there. Reports from a released hostage helped police learn of how this happened.&quot; the chopper&#39;s footage then shifted to a woman with a black eye. The news then told them Cynthia Johnson was one of the tellers.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I was helping a woman cash a check when a group came in demanding everything. Mark our security guard tried to subdue them but the skunk guy... he changed him into a monkey. I hit the emergency alert before the wolf sent electricity at the glass. Their leader then grabbed me and the others and put us in the center of the room. I tried pleading with them but their leader...&quot; the scene suddenly switched revealing a fiery hole on the bank&#39;s side. Three mutants ran out of it. The footage then showed Gwyn dive bombing the leader as the wolf mutant dove into an open manhole. &quot;this just in the leader of the gang has been caught&quot; The couple was relieved to see that their son was not only okay but stopped the criminal.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;We saw the news. are you okay?&quot; Ella asked over the phone. &quot;yeah I&#39;m okay. purity was hard to take down but luckily I got her by surprise&quot; his voice didn&#39;t sound too happy. &quot;what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Ella asked. &quot;the rest of her gang got away.&quot; it sounded like there was more but she didn&#39;t press. &quot;well just know we&#39;re proud of you dear. Say how about you come home for Thanksgiving?&quot; she asked. She could hear him giggle a little &quot;I&#39;ll be there&quot; he said before hanging up. Eric then entered through the back door with Nancy on her leash. &quot;Everything good?&quot; Eric asked. &quot;yep and Gwyn said he&#39;ll be here for Thanksgiving.&quot; she replied.  <br />
<br />
She still remembered the shocking day she gave birth to an egg. They hadn&#39;t wanted to do an ultrasound unless they needed to. When Ella went into premature labor they feared the worst. However, three months later a dragon hatchling popped out of that shell and they never regretted that moment when they held him. Over the years he grew into a handsome young man. He was also chivalrous. When he was just a young dragon anthro he saved his best friend&#39;s younger sister. When he was fourteen they went on a vacation and he found an amber nugget. They held onto the money until he was legally old enough and bought him a house. Since it had four bedrooms he invited his closest friends to live in it while they went to college. Then the storm changed them. They figured since Gwyn was a myth he was unaffected but all his friends were. They were quite surprised when Isla told them about founding the M.P.A. but were supportive. Since then their son has become like a superhero.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ella!&quot; Eric yelled snapping her out of her fond memories. She looked up to see a multi-colored could appear over her. Eric tried to move her away from it when a lightning bolt hit them and Nancy. Reports of people getting hit by these bolts were different. Each one seemed pure magic causing even more extreme changes than the violet rain.  <br />
<br />
Eric slammed into his wife and disappeared in a flash. He was soon followed by Nancy. The energy soon vaporized all the clothes except her husband&#39;s dog tags which now hung on Ella&#39;s neck. Ella only had a moment to react to this before her changes happened. From her crotch, her husband&#39;s cock pushed out of pussy. It then sealed shut into a hairy sack and two large orbs descended into it.  <br />
<br />
If that wasn&#39;t strange enough her new cock split in two, and both then grew to double their original size leaving her with twin foot-long cocks. Inside her sack, two new testicles were added to the existing pair. Ella&#39;s hips rearranged as she began to grow. Her ass became pure muscle and her thighs swelled up and her stomach fat melted into a six-pack. Soon her calves swelled up and her feet grew. Her breasts reformed into dense pecs as her shoulders widened.   <br />
<br />
The changes raced down her arms giving her a bodybuilder build. Two bulges grew below her arms and soon an identical pair of limbs was made. Body hair then appeared everywhere. Thicker amounts appeared from her bush, and pits, between her pecs and chin. A bulge quickly formed from the right side as her shoulders widened to make room. Her once again features returned to a youthful complexion as they rearranged. Her lips thinned while her nose grew. Her eyebrows thickened while her hair shrank into her scalp. She now has a short slicked black hairstyle and beard around her chin. She breathed heavily as she closed her eyes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;what the heck&quot; a voice right next to her ear said. Opening her now amber eyes she saw another head in her reflection. Both her new face and the other head looked like her husband when he was in his late teens. &#39;eighteen&#39; both heads eyes widened as they realized they were hearing their thoughts. Ella tried to lift her upper right arm for her purse on the counter to get a better look. The problem was that she couldn&#39;t move it. She then felt it move but not by her. &quot;here&quot; the other head said.  <br />
<br />
She used her left hand to unzip and get out her mirror. In her reflection, she saw the same face that she did in the window but better. The right head did look a lot like the left but not exactly. It had a cowlick at the front of its hairline. The right head soon grimaced in pain. Ella soon felt a terrible migraine as information came into her mind.  <br />
<br />
All at once Eric&#39;s memories, feelings, and personality merged with her own. They then felt a name for both of them come into being, Elroric. The second head took to calling himself Eric and he took to calling himself Elroy. &quot;I need to call our... I mean my son&quot; Elroric said in unison. In perfect sync, they went over to the phone.  <br />
<br />
However, their changes weren&#39;t over yet. They were soon hit with a massive wave of pleasure as one of the foot-long cocks split again. The two outer ones now mirror each other at a wide v angle as two more testicles drop into his sack. This time however their changes became more beautiful. The three eighteen-inch dicks grew and began turning a deep red. A knot formed at their bases and their heads became more pointed. Across their balls, a familiar ash-brown fur spreads across them and continues across his skin.  <br />
<br />
His already beefed-up 6&#39;6 body soon began to grow some more. As his muscles became mountains of flesh, the brown fur covered them. Only the thicker parts of his body hair remained. His bush became black fur and looked like a forest now. His ankles raised as his nails sharpened. He could feel his pads brush against the tiled floor as they became too large for any of his shoes. From his ass, a long fluffy tail grew. His torso grew massively as 8 more abs angled slightly on either side of the original pairs grew. His pecs became larger than his breasts ever were and the hair between them became more black fur and covered his throats. The same was said for all of his armpits. His four hands gained pads and claws as a third bump grew on his shoulder. This time it was his left side. His shoulders widened again giving him a massive V-shaped to his body.  <br />
<br />
The two heads could feel their necks changing as their mouths pushed forward. The brown fur finished covering every inch of skin and their remaining black hair became thick fur the same color. His teeth became fangs as his ears moved to the top of his heads. Eric and Elroy brought the mirror to their faces to see the third head. Unlike them, this head didn&#39;t seem as intelligent. Its tongue was out and it had no beard. All three still had that slicked-back hairstyle though.  <br />
<br />
Elroy soon felt their upper left hand drop his mirror. he realized this third head must be Nancy and a thought from her entered their minds, &#39;mate&#39;. Both helplessly watched as Nancy brought his hand to their middle cock. &quot;hey that&#39;s mine...&quot; was all Elroy could mutter before he was lost in bliss. The other head&#39;s minds fogged up as they began to join.  <br />
<br />
Eric brought his right upper arm to their right cock and followed Nancy&#39;s lead. Elroy tried to fight but ended up doing the same. Nateroric soon cumed with all his cocks. Like before Nancy&#39;s mind, feelings, and personality merged with his being. This coupled with their orgasm made Eric and Elroy pass out.  <br />
<br />
Now Nate was in full control of their body and wanted to mate. Through the kitchen window, he smelled a bitch in heat and wanted to be the one who satisfied her. He rushed to the door and accidentally smashed through it. Of course, with his wide seven-foot body there was no way he was exiting normally. Despite the destroyed door, there wasn&#39;t so much of a scratch on Nateroric. Nate then ran to the fence and jumped it.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Gwyn sighed as they escorted the victims of the robbery. Narda had turned them all into horny beasts. Thankfully Wynn had helped their minds but it would take forever to get them back to even a humanoid shape. &quot;you okay dude?&quot; Cody came over. he was brought in to help the victims get used to their bodies. &quot;no we should&#39;ve run in sooner&quot; Gwyn answered. &quot;if we did that then Purity could&#39;ve hit the victims and escaped. We can&#39;t control how a situation plays out&quot; Alice put her hand on his shoulder.  <br />
<br />
Even in her human form, she was still faster and stronger than the regular human. Gwyn smiled at this before his radio went off &quot;Go for Gwyn&quot; he said. &quot;Gwyn we have an emergency&quot; he could hear the hesitation in Briar&#39;s simulated voice. &quot;what is it&quot; he didn&#39;t understand her history until she spoke again. &quot;we got a massive energy spike in the local suburbs. Looks like a lightning blast. Gwyn, there&#39;s no easy way to say this... it was at your parent&#39;s house&quot; The three looked scared and Gwyn most of all. &quot;you two stay i need to make sure they are alive&quot; Gwyn said as he launched into the sky. &quot;fat chance&quot; Alice went into a sprinting stance. &quot;hop on&quot; after Cody wrapped his arms around her she ran. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Gwyn put his key in the door. &quot;Mom, Dad, where are you guys?&quot; he said as he entered. His senses tell him the storm hit in the kitchen. He stopped in his tracks as his eyes widened. Where a door once stood a large hole existed. &quot;Gwyn?&quot; Cody said as he and Alice entered. &quot;Woah!&quot; was all he could say as they started at the scene.  <br />
<br />
Gwyn pulled out his phone again in hopes one of his parents had their cellphones on them. He couldn&#39;t get in touch with his dads and his mom&#39;s phone rang inside her opened purse. &quot;we&#39;ll find them&quot; Alice said comforting Gwyn in a hug. She then noticed the shattered mirror and picked it up. It was splattered with cum. &quot;this will be enough for a scent&quot; Alice said in disgust. She prayed that she didn&#39;t have to do this but a mutant&#39;s urine or cum has the strongest scents. She sniffed it before putting it in an evidence bag. &quot;got it&quot; she ignored the tenting in her pants and headed through the hole. She sniffed the air and pointed in a direction.   <br />
<br />
&quot;whatever happened it&#39;s canine in origin,&quot; she said as they went out the back gate. &quot;didn&#39;t you say your parents have a dog&quot; Cody said as they followed Alice. &quot;Yeah Nancy, Dad got her for my mom over a year ago&quot; he hoped Nancy had just gotten big and his parents chased after her. They soon came across another hole this time through a fence. &quot;briar any information about this address&quot; Cody said as Alice grabbed Gwyn&#39;s shoulder. &quot;we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in there&quot; Alice said. Gwyn was anxious as they waited.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, a mutant lives there, Miss Olivia Sales. She is a canine mutant with a humanoid appearance. She was recently cleared from the hospital, no contagions&quot; Briar finally responded. With that confirmation, they entered the yard. The front yard looked okay save for some crushed flowers near the path.  <br />
<br />
They went to the backyard and saw a knocked-over table and a chair in the pool. They followed the scent to the pool shed. Inside they heard the sounds of dogs mating mixed with human moans. Another hole broke the door allowing them easy access inside. Gwyn neatly had a heart attack at what he saw. A Cerberus man with bigger muscles than even Isla was getting his middle cock sucked off by whom he assumed to be Olivia Sales. He used his upper arms to hold her in place and his lower arms to jack his other two cocks off. Gwyn saw a chain wrapped around his trio of necks and on it, his father&#39;s dog tags bounced with each thrust. Alice snapped out of shock and gave orders to the two. &quot;Gwyn stay here and make sure he doesn&#39;t bolt. ill slap the cuffs on him and Cody, you will help Miss Sales.&quot; Alice was the second in command so they followed her plan.  <br />
<br />
Alice was able to get close to the Cerberus. She noticed only the left head seemed awake while the other two seemed unconscious. She put the cuffs on his upper arms before he realized they were in the shed. His shock allowed Olivia to break free. Without his &#39;mate&#39;, Nate saw Alice as a replacement and tried to grab her. Due to the enchanted cuffs, however, his invulnerability was compromised. All it took was one swift roundhouse kick to the left head and he fell like a sack of spuds. Alice then got a spare set of cuffs and put them on his lower arms too.  <br />
<br />
After Miss Sales threw up she explained how she tried relaxing by her pool to take her mind off her new heat problem. Then she heard a loud crash from the front yard and the Cerberus showed up. She jumped out of the way as he tried to skid to a stop. He then hit the table and chair before falling into the pool. She then tried to run into the shed but he made a huge hole and grabbed her. &quot;...and everything is kinda hazy after that,&quot; she said. Her face however was a mix of shame and lust. &quot;miss M.P.A. will come by and help with the damages&quot; Cody said.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Gwyn stared at the three-headed canine men sleeping before him. Alice comforted him as he pieced it together. The fur on the anthro was Nancy&#39;s coat. The dog tags were from his father when he served a tour in the country. He got injured halfway through his tour so he came home with three fewer fingers but alive. The fact that his mom&#39;s purse was at the house and there were three heads. Gwyn had figured out what happened to her.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
present day:<br />
<br />
After they arrived at the hospital Wynn awakened Elroy and Eric. Nancy&#39;s new memories and diverse mindset knocked them out. Now that they were awake they were horrified about what they&#39;d done, well two-thirds of them were. It was revealed that Nate hadn&#39;t gained much intelligence apart from how to move their body. He even spoke simple phrases like &#39;need mate&#39; or &#39;want walk&#39;. Nateroric explained he was neither Eric nor Ella. The  eighteen year old canine said that they had mixed into him. Wynn confirmed this and told Gwyn that it would be implausible to separate them mentally. Despite the three having the same memories and body they each acted differently. Eric would flex and work out.  <br />
<br />
After they were eventually released he had them go back to miss sales and apologize for their dog&#39;s actions. Let&#39;s say he was happy he had invulnerability as she kicked him below the belt. Elroy was the chef of the trio. Since he had control of both lower arms he also did their budgets and taxes. Nate meanwhile was the troublemaker. The reason Miss Sales kicked them was him saying &#39;mate again?&#39;. He constantly wanted to pull off their new clothes and jack off to find another canine pussy. Isla helped enroll them in a training meeting. A specialized doctor would help diagnose what they needed. It was revealed that Nate had an undeveloped mind and needed to learn. The other two heads agreed. They have been going to the class for the next two weeks now.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Nate, what did we talk about?&quot; Eric said as he worked on his new back door. &quot;No take of cloth unless all agree.&quot; His speech had improved, but it wasn&#39;t on par with his brothers. He had called them that, and the other two couldn&#39;t deny they felt that way too. &quot;here bro... I mean Eric&quot; Elroy said as he put the door in place. Since his shoulders were too wide Eric had made a custom door for them. &quot;thanks, bro... Elroy. That should do it&quot; Nateroric backed up to appreciate his hard work. &quot;play now?&quot; Nate said. The two sighed in agreement. Nate took off their black shorts and boxers.  <br />
<br />
Nate still liked jacking off nude and the others couldn&#39;t help but feel the same way. With all their blinds down they went to the bathroom and &#39;played&#39;. After they had calmed down and put their clothes back on they heard their doorbell go off. Nate almost sprinted before the others stopped him and walked normally.  <br />
<br />
When they arrived at their door he was surprised at who it was on the other side. Through the peephole, he saw Olivia&#39;s sales on the other side. Nate didn&#39;t care and used his arm to open the door. &quot;hi ma... miss&quot; Nate said. He could smell the heat coming from her pussy as she spoke. &quot;hi Nater... Natat...&quot; Olivia struggled to pronounce his full name. &quot;it&#39;s okay we know our combined name is hard to say. You can call me Eric&quot; Eric said lifting his arm to his right pectoral. &quot;my name is Nate&quot; Nate eagerly followed his brother. &quot;And I&#39;m Elroy&quot; Elroy said as he joined the lower hands.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s um... nice to meet you... again&quot; Olivia said. Just the cold wind blew against them. Due to his invulnerability and growing coat Nateroric wasn&#39;t too fazed. Olivia on the other hand shivered. &quot;Oh my, come on in,&quot; Elroy said as they backed away from the door. The middle head&#39;s maternal feelings got the better of him.  <br />
<br />
The smaller dog mutant did and sat on a chair. &quot;I wanted to come and say I&#39;m sorry for how I acted. I shouldn&#39;t have blamed you all for... Nate&#39;s actions&quot; she said. Nate&#39;s ears dropped slightly at this. &quot;no need to apologize. We understand&quot; Eric said. The Cerberus then sat on a custom chair from a local mutant. The tanuki had been gifted the power to resize anything to a degree. The shop became popular for mutants who had changed in size. Sadly since he was the first Cerberus anywhere in the world he couldn&#39;t find a shirt with three neck holes or one with a large neck hole for all his heads. &quot;if you don&#39;t mind me asking, why are you here though. we gave you our number, you could&#39;ve just called&quot; Elroy said. Olivia rubbed her arm as she looked at the ground. &quot;well it involves the first time we met&quot; She finally looked at Elroy and said...</p>
