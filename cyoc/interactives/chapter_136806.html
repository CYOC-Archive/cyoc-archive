<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The men cheer as they began drinking your special ale, but little did they know that you added a little extra ingredient straight from your body to it. Suddenly men start changing, growing scales, shrinking, even the bartender who decided to join in on the fun began shifting. This was too perfect for you as you sat back and watched with a grin as the occupants all changed into masculine kobold brothers, although not nearly as manly as you.<br />
<br />
Most were only around 3 feet tall, and didn’t have quite as an impressive physique as you, but you had to make due with what you had. So while everyone changed your scurried on back behind the counter and looted everything that you could carry on you, and by the time the bar was entirely transformed you were leaning up against a sack of gold that you would later deliver to your glorious master.<br />
<br />
After everything was done and over with all of the kobolds looked around confused and weary of their surroundings until you jumped up on a table and screeched causing all of them to turn towards you and see how superior you were to all of them. You then preached about your other brethren and your master to all of them, and told them that they would treat you as their champion, but ultimately serve your common master.<br />
<br />
Most of the kobolds cheered gleefully and called at to you and their master proclaiming their ownership and undying loyalty to you and your master, however two looked to you with questionable looks on their faces. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why should you lead us? Where is our master, and why are you the champion?&quot; One orange scaled Kobald hissed at you and all of the other kobolds looked to see how you would respond.<br />
<br />
You jumped off the table and stormed towards this kobold with fury in your eyes, and you saw his pride and will shrink as you looked down at him and grinned with pride as you watched him cower before you. You then grabbed onto the rebellious kobold&#39;s shoulders and slammed him up against a wall then you threw him across the bar and the kobolds around him moved away to make way for you.<br />
<br />
You walked up to the orange kobold again as he was getting up, now on his knees and he looked back at you wearily, and you dropped your trousers to reveal your happily throbbing reptilian cocks. &quot;P-Please no, I&#39;m sorry, have mercy please!&quot; The kobold cried<br />
<br />
&quot;Insubordination needs to be purified before it can serve master!&quot; You hissed,&quot;Luckily for you I know just how to do it you little runt.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kobold tried scurrying away, but you grabbed his tail and yanked him back by it and hissed,&quot;If you wish to live you&#39;ll do exactly what I say, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
The kobold nodded frantically in response and whimpered,&quot;A-Any...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; You snapped and the kobold whined with submission and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay right where you are on your hands and knees, and keep that tail of yours raised.&quot; You hissed and the kobold nodded and frantically got into position while you kept a firm grip on his tail.<br />
<br />
You released his tail and the small kobold kept it lifted for you, and you smiled then firmly gripped his ass with your talons and slowly spread apart his cheeks, and the bar of kobolds cheered for you. The orange kobold blushed in his humiliation as he looked around the room, the other rebellious kobold now looked intimidated by you, and afraid.<br />
<br />
You then leaned down beside the orange kobold&#39;s head and whispered,&quot;We are a family brother, but our family loves its brotherly love, especially me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then smacked the kobold&#39;s ass and he yipped as a clear smack echoed throughout the bar and he looked back with tears in his eyes and cried,&quot;Please stop! I&#39;ll do whatever you say!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then be a man and get purified willingly like the feeble slut you are!!!&quot; You shouted then you brought your waist back and thrusted forward as hard as you could into the kobold&#39;s tight ass with both of your cocks.<br />
<br />
The kobold screamed as loud as he could as you began thrusting into him rhythmically, and he moaned loudly as his two smaller cocks unsheathed before you and you smiled as your claws dug into his rear. <br />
<br />
The kobold&#39;s dicks unsheathed just as you thought they would, and you took hold of both in one of your claws and began jerking him off to hear his cries of pain and pleasure. You could feel the precum dripping from the kobold&#39;s cocks and yours as you continued humping the poor creature into submission.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your cute little ass is quite enjoyable, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m stretching it out really nice too. Now, do you know who you serve?&quot; You asked tightening your grip around his cocks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ynnnngh...&quot; The kobold whimpered feeling his dicks squeezed<br />
<br />
&quot;Who? Say it louder!&quot; You hissed then gripped even tighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yoaaaagh!&quot; The kobold howled<br />
<br />
&quot;Say it with pride! Vigor! You are a soldier! So start acting like one!!!&quot; You hissed then thrusted into the kobold’s tight ass once more, and the kobold screamed as loud as he could and emptied his load on the floor of the bar all the while screaming,&quot;Youuuuuuuu!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
You grinned with pride at this and saw the exhausted expression on the kobold&#39;s face as he looked back at you. &quot;That’s a good boy, but I&#39;m not satisfied yet!&quot; You hissed and then thrusted further into the kobold again and again causing him to moan loudly and orgasm again and again after his climax.<br />
<br />
The small spill of cum soon turned into a tiny puddle that touched your feet and surrounded your talons until you eventually climaxed and yelled as loud as you could like some sort of war cry, and your load sprayed into the kobold&#39;s ass and a tiny pudgy bulge formed in his stomach, and you pulled out to hear the kobold scream loudly and rub his sore ass obviously in pain because of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, it didn’t hurt that much, our master has a cock bigger than twice my own size easily.&quot; You exclaimed then all of the kobolds in the bar looked to you now all appalled by your display of dominance.<br />
<br />
You looked around the room and smiled to your new brethren and yelled,&quot;Tonight we celebrate! We shall loot every treasure and claim it all for master, and claim more brethren to serve him when dawn strikes! For now we drink, we loot this bar, and we celebrate however we wish, especially...&quot; You turn to the orange kobold and kiss him on the forehead and continue,&quot;...have more brotherly love with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
The entire bar erupted into cheers as the kobolds all started drinking from their mugs again, and many chose to start orgies with one another. You turned back towards the other kobold who initially questioned you, but now he walked up and knelt down to you and whimpered,&quot;Please d-don’t hurt me, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down at him and then to the orange kobold who continued rubbing his ass and smiled then said,&quot;Your willing allegiance is enough for you brother. But please, call me Draz, and I shall lead you into a perfect new life. You, our many brothers, especially that orange cutie I just fucked.&quot;<br />
<br />
The orange kobold whimpered and scurried back against the wall then whined,&quot;Not again, please...&quot;<br />
<br />
You chuckled then looked down at the kneeling kobold, who had bright teal scales, and offered him your claw. The teal kobold of course took it and you lifted him to his feet then turned to the orange kobold and said,&quot;I will not do it again little brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were certainly going to address the orange kobold by this from now and into the future, so you grinned and winked to the orange kobold as you brought the two together and said,&quot;You two have much in common, if you serve me loyally and worship master unconditionally, I would be happy to see both of you many times in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two kobolds lookedto each other unsure then you walked back and slapped a couple mugs of your special ale on the table next to them and laughed,&quot;Well? Aren’t you going to celebrate?! Have a drink and calm your nerves brothers, we all need to look out for each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
You grabbed a random mug from the table and took a drink yourself after you said this, and the two kobolds smiled and drank too happily then sat down together at the table. Later that night many of your brothers asked if they could serve your body by sucking and licking your cocks, and who were you to deny them of this pleasure? You even picked up a few cocks and began sucking them yourself as you were in a bar of drunk kobolds, and by the end of it you locked the doors to get into the bar and had fun with the rest of your family addition.<br />
<br />
The next day you woke up in the behind bar with many of your brothers snuggling up against your body, and the rest were scattered around either sleeping, working off a hangover or peering outside. <br />
<br />
You stood up and grasped your head as you too were experiencing one hell of a hangover from last night, and you carefully made your way towards the very few who were awake and observing the windows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, brother you’re awake at last, day has finally come and it is morning. Very few are roaming the streets, an...&quot; A purple scaled kobold shouted then you glared up at it and hissed,&quot;Quiet! Ugh, we shouldn’t be seen, so... just hide out here for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another kobold walked up to you and groaned,&quot;Ugh, I know but brother, what if people grow suspicious? This is a tavern, and if it doesn’t open people will wonder, and if it does we&#39;ll be found. What should we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused as you heard your brother say this and he was right, you had to think of a plan before something happens.</p>
