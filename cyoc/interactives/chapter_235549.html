<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once they were clean, they stepped out and dried off, wrapping towels around their waists.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what should we do next?&quot; Jeffie asked, leaning against the sink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure.&quot; Jeff said, running a hand through his hair. &quot;We could hang out, play video games, watch TV, or something. What do you want to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie shrugged. &quot;Whatever, I&#39;m easy.&quot; he said, grinning. &quot;I&#39;m still pretty new to this whole life thing, so you&#39;re going to have to show me the ropes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can do.&quot; Jeff said, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.&quot; Jeffie said, grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;In fact,&quot; Jeff continued, a wicked glint in his eyes, &quot;I have an idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Jeffie asked, curious. &quot;Well, don&#39;t keep me in suspense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would you like to go on a date with me?&quot; Jeff asked as he touched his copy&#39;s cheek.<br />
<br />
Jeffie laughed. &quot;A date? You and me?&quot; He raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jeff replied, shrugging. &quot;Why not? We&#39;re the same person, and we just had sex, so why not go out? We have, or at least I think we have the same interests.  It&#39;ll be fun.  Just the two of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like the sound of that.&quot; Jeffie said, smiling. &quot;What did you have in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about dinner and a movie?&quot; Jeff suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Jeffie said, nodding. &quot;Sure, I&#39;m down,&quot; He leaned in and kissed Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.&quot; Jeff said, a smile on his face. &quot;Come on, I&#39;ll let you wear some of my, or I guess, our, clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t forget the socks.&quot; Jeffie said, laughing.<br />
<br />
Jeff stuck his tongue out and rushed from the bathroom, his clone following close behind.<br />
<br />
The two boys walked into Jeff&#39;s bedroom, the scent of sex still hanging in the air. Jeff opened his closet and picked out a pair of jeans and a T-shirt for Jeffie, handing them to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Bro.&quot; Jeffie said, quickly dressing.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem.&quot; Jeff replied, sliding into his own clothes.<br />
<br />
The two boys made their way downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we going?&quot; Jeffie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a pizza place downtown I&#39;ve been wanting to try.&quot;  He slid his arm around Jeff and pulled him close.  &quot;Besides, you haven&#39;t had your first meal yet, and I want it to be amazing.  There is nothing, I mean nothing, better than pizza.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie grinned. &quot;Okay, let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
They made their way out of the house and down the street, walking side by side, arms wrapped around each other&#39;s waist and they soon arrived at the Palmiro&#39;s Pizza and Pasta, PPP for short, which specialized in fire-oven baked pizza and hand-pulled noodles.  A cute red-headed and freckled waitress guided them to their seats. &quot;Here are your menus.&quot; she said, handing the two identical teens the paper menus. &quot;Can I get you something to drink while you decide?&quot;  She smiled down at them, studying their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s good here?&quot; Jeffie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything.&quot; the waitress said, grinning. &quot;But I&#39;m partial to the double pepperoni with extra cheese. It&#39;s to die for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds great.  Jeff, what do you think?&quot; Jeffie said, his eyes twinkling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we&#39;ll have that, um that in a large, and a Mountain Dew.&quot; Jeff said, smiling up at the waitress.  &quot;Jeffie will like that drink too.&quot;<br />
<br />
The waitress grinned when she heard their names.  &quot;Jeff and Jeffie.  That&#39;s cute.&quot; She said, her cheeks turning red. &quot;We don&#39;t get many twins in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Jeff said, blushing.<br />
<br />
The waitress winked at the two boys and went off to put their order in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Twins, huh?&quot; Jeffie said, raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jeff said, smiling. &quot;I think we look a lot alike. Don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Jeffie laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, did you see her, she was so into us,&quot; Jeffie said.<br />
<br />
Jeff winked at his twin.  The two boys made small talk as they waited for their pizza, Jeffie asked Jeff about everything, eager to learn about his creator&#39;s life; school, friends, and plans for the future.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, the waitress returned, carrying a large, steaming pizza. &quot;Here you go, boys,&quot; she said, setting the pie down on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, that looks delicious.&quot; Jeffie said, his mouth watering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dig in,&quot; the waitress said, winking at them.<br />
<br />
Jeffie grabbed a slice and took a big bite, his eyes rolling back in his head. &quot;Holy crap, that is amazing,&quot; he moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, right?&quot; the waitress said, grinning. &quot;It&#39;s my favorite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm,&quot; Jeffie mumbled, his mouth full.<br />
<br />
Jeff and the waitress laughed.  Jeff enjoyed the sight of the clone&#39;s first meal, feeling the anticipation of taste and excitement.<br />
<br />
After finishing the pizza, the two boys talked more about their lives, their likes and dislikes, their hopes and dreams.  Although Jeffie was so new he spoke with Jeff like they&#39;d been together like real twins.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how&#39;s your first day been?&quot; Jeff asked, taking a sip of his soda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing.&quot; Jeffie replied, smiling. &quot;This pizza is awesome and I got to spend time with my favorite person, you. So, thank you, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, socky.&quot; Jeff replied, grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can&#39;t believe you call me that,&quot; Jeffie said, his mouth still half-full of pizza.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s a nickname.&quot; Jeff replied, chuckling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot; Jeffie said, sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just go with it.&quot; Jeff shrugged.  &quot;It&#39;s cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie laughed and nodded. &quot;Fine, just think of how you created me from a cum-encrusted old sock everytime you say it.&quot;  He grinned, &quot;Eventually you&#39;ll stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot; Jeff said, winking.<br />
<br />
After they finished the pizza Jeffie leaned in and whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, my stomach feels weird, all full and happy, like when you jizzed into me. Is that a bad thing?&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not.&quot; Jeff said, leaning closer to Jeffie. &quot;Now that you&#39;re a boy, you&#39;ll eat and enjoy your food like everyone else. Plus, the best orgasms are always the ones you feel in your stomach.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie shook his head, looking around the restaurant. He whispered, &quot;I still can&#39;t believe how great today has been. I mean, we met, we hung out, we showered, I got jacked off, we had sex, and I ate my first meal, pizza! You, my brother, have been amazing. Thanks, again. This really is the best first day of life a boy could ask for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff whispered back, &quot;No problem, Bro. Anytime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie leaned back into the alcove and smiled, starring Jeff strait into the eye.<br />
<br />
Jeff winked at his clone. &quot;Anyways, how are we going to finish this off?&quot; he said, &quot;It&#39;s not too late for a movie now. We could go for a walk if you prefer. Or I&#39;m sure we can find something at home, play video games maybe. It doesn&#39;t have to be over yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Jeffie said, reaching over and taking his hand.<br />
<br />
The two brothers stared into each other&#39;s eyes, both thinking about everything they could do before going back home.<br />
Jeffie&#39;s smile widened.<br />
<br />
Jeff gave a playful grin. &quot;Okay, what are you thinking about?&quot; he asked, wagging his eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, I think I remember seeing a park near here.&quot; Jeffie paused, his smile turning lascivious. &quot;I&#39;d like to lay down somewhere and makeout with my twin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph, how very sweet.&quot; Jeff replied, chuckling.<br />
<br />
The two paid for the pizza and when the waitress brought the customer&#39;s check it had a telephone number on it.  Jeffie glanced at his twin.  &quot;Told you,&quot; he said, winking<br />
<br />
 They made their way to the Park, the sun had set and twilight cast long shadows over the stream that passed through the middle.  No one else was out and Jeff and Jeffie walked through it hand in hand, their identical fingers intertwined.  Under a bridge Jeffie stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, over here.&quot; Jeffie said, pulling Jeff up under the bridge.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit romantic, aren&#39;t you Socky.&quot; Jeff teased. &quot;This where you take all your conquests to makeout? Not even 24 hours and you&#39;re already quite the...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie just laughed. &quot;Quit your shit, come on.&quot; he replied, dragging Jeff after him.<br />
<br />
On the concrete above the water Jeffie pushed Jeff up against the cold wall and pressed their lips together.  His tongue darted around Jeff&#39;s as Jeff&#39;s hands eagerly reached under Jeffie&#39;s shirt.<br />
<br />
Jeffie pushed away a moment later, his breathing heavy and a big, dopey grin plastered across his face. He looked from Jeff&#39;s crotch to the nearby bank. &quot;Jeff, lay on that bench over there and close your eyes. Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff did as he was told, getting his nearly-twin brother to lay down beside him on the bench. His legs wrapped around Jeffie and the clone&#39;s chest pressing hard on him. Their erect cocks pushing through the layers of clothes.  Their tongues rolling around one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax Bro.&quot; Jeffie whispered into Jeff&#39;s ears. &quot;And enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes closed and he his zipper being pulled down, then the sensation of gentle hands lifting his penis from the fold, the cold air biting his skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breathe deep and feel.&quot; Jeffie said as Jeff&#39;s soft, warm cock felt something wet run along it.  Jeff moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh,&quot; Jeffie whispered, his soft warm tongue tickling the head of Jeff&#39;s cock. &quot;You taste like you smell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff bit his lower lip and closed his eyes even tighter, trying not to cum in an instant as he raised his hand and placed it on his clone&#39;s head, scrunching his fingers closed through Jeffie&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Jeffie said, whispering, &quot;Just close your eyes and feel it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned louder as he felt Jeffie&#39;s wet, smooth mouth pop his glans in and sliding farther down his shaft, the sensations too much for the teenage boy. <br />
<br />
Jeffie&#39;s warm mouth enclosing around his head and his clone&#39;s hot, wet, tongue swirled around his dick as he pushed in as deep as possible and holding it, gargling Jeff&#39;s penis in the back of his throat.<br />
<br />
Jeff tried to focus on other things, hoping to delay his orgasm. &quot;Ugh,&quot; he cried out, as he felt the intensity and wetness increasing around his member.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, Jeffie, don&#39;t stop.  Ugh.  Keep&quot; Jeff arched his back, pressing his cock up, &quot;keep going.&quot;  Jeff felt the familiar tingling in his balls and he knew he wasn&#39;t going to be able to resist, despite how good Jeffie&#39;s warm mouth felt and how he wanted this to go on forever. He fought the urge and clenched his balls to try and give him just a few more seconds, those wonderful last moments before everything exploded.  Jeffie sucked, pulling in Jeff&#39;s foreskin before his tongue slid in and spun around the glans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suck. That&#39;s so, suck, so, so good.&quot; Jeff moaned.  He thrust up and pulled at his clone&#39;s hair. &quot;I, I&quot; he cried out. &quot;Aargh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cum sputtered from the tip of Jeff&#39;s cock and Jeffie pushed himself all the way down, feeling the pulse of Jeff&#39;s penis in his mouth as the sticky white ichor sprayed into his throat, squirting with each throb.<br />
<br />
Jeff was breathless and weak, panting from the best orgasm of his life. &quot;W-wow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See, Bro,&quot; Jeffie said, his body becoming fully visible as he sat upright. &quot;That&#39;s how good your cum is.&quot; He stuck out his tongue, swirling it in his mouth as his cheeks bulged.  He gulped, letting the fresh spunk ooze down his throat.  &quot;Best. Dessert. Ever.&quot; He said, grinning as a small trickle slid out of the side of his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, Socky.&quot; Jeff panted. &quot;How did you..? Your girlfriend teach you to swallow like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, not exactly.&quot; Jeffie replied, grinning at the sarcasm and wiping away the small glob, sucking it back into his mouth. He laid down beside his brother, his cheek on Jeff&#39;s chest and they both watched the moon come out, shining upon the river and surrounding grass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you learn to suck me off like that?&quot; Jeff asked. &quot;Or maybe that was a pre-programmed function I accidentally turned on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t like I did much.&quot; Jeffie said, coyly. &quot;Your cum-stuffed sock was just lubed with so many of your dried-up jizz loads.&quot; He paused, laying his cheek back down. &quot;The important thing, I think, is the smell and taste of your ejaculate, and it feels like I know them intimately.&quot; Jeffie sighed and glanced up at Jeff. &quot;One day, I&#39;d like to put my cock in your mouth too, Jeff.&quot; He giggled, his cheeks blushing. &quot;If it&#39;s anything like mine, then it&#39;ll taste fantastic. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there&#39;s nothing like sucking you dry. But it would also be a dream to have you deepthroat my cock and take it I did to you tonight, maybe, one day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff kissed his clone.  &quot;W-why not right now,&quot; he said, laying his hand on the bulge in Jeffie&#39;s pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Jeffie said, grinning. &quot;You mean it,&quot; He unzipped his jeans and slipped out like water escaping a dam.  He shook it around with his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Jeff laughed. &quot;I mean, if you can swallow my spunk like that, I should be able to do the same to you.&quot; Jeff ran his hand over his clone&#39;s chest, twirling Jeffie&#39;s shirt with a finger. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not as delicious as yours,&quot; Jeffie purred as he laid on his side, kissing Jeff again.<br />
<br />
Jeff ran his hands down his clone&#39;s body, reaching the waistband of his jeans. Jeffie lifted his hips to allow his brother access to the tight-fitting pants. He slowly worked them down the clone&#39;s muscular legs, exposing the beautiful waist beneath.  Jeffie&#39;s cock throbbed, a full seven inches standing a full mast growing from a tuft of pubic hair.  Jeff wasn&#39;t scared of being caught at all. All he cared about was pleasuring his creation.  Jeff kissed Jeffie&#39;s thigh, gently sucking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, a little higher. Come on, Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff continued kissing his clone&#39;s smooth legs, taking in the musk of manhood and inching ever closer to the throbbing member standing at attention. He gripped it by the base, just below the balls. &quot;Hmm, it&#39;s nice, Bro, really big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Identical too yours.&quot; Jeffie replied, the smile wide across his lips as Jeff&#39;s mouth sucked in one of his clones tight nuts, Jeffie threw his head back and moaned. &quot;So good!&quot; He whispered.<br />
<br />
Jeff switched to the other nut, loving the taste of his, or rather Jeffie&#39;s, balls. Then he planted soft kisses all over the swollen crown, licking and slurping dabs of precum like syrup from a bottle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Jeff.&quot; Jeffie breathed, his hand cupping his brother&#39;s chin and pushing him back. &quot;I want your face buried into my hair.  I want to cum so hard into your mouth right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff leaned in and stuck out his tongue, flicking it a little along the folded foreskin. The flesh on the tip was soft and velvety, while the underside was hard and muscular. He licked from base to tip, swirling his tongue around the bulbous head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Oh fuck yes!&quot; Jeffie gasped, throwing his arms to the side. &quot;Take it all! That&#39;s right, all the way down!&quot; Jeffie panted hard as his dick sunk deep down Jeff&#39;s throat, his newly minted sixteen year old body writhing and his eyes rolling up and his toes curling, every nerve exploding inside as Jeff held him close and sucked in the warmth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh.  Fuck your mouth,&quot; Jeffie yelled, reaching down to press his brother closer.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked up, meeting his clone&#39;s lustful, ecstacy-consumed gaze. &quot;Don&#39;t move,&quot; Jeffie whispered, thrusting his cock up and down in Jeff&#39;s mouth. &quot;Ahh, ugh,&quot; he panted, &quot;swallow me down, bro.  Swollow me down!&quot;  Jeffie exploded, a wave of spunk built inside and his body writhed. &quot;Jeff!&quot; Jeffie exclaimed, thrusting hard and fast. &quot;Ugh! So good. Uh. Ah. Ugh.&quot; Jeff&#39;s warm, wet mouth closed over the bulging head and pressed down as Jeffie&#39;s muscles contracted and squirted his spunk in, greasing the inside of Jeff&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh,&quot; Jeffie cried out, his legs shuddering and his back arching.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s tongue flicked under the his brother&#39;s glans as cum filled his mouth until Jeffie&#39;s thrusting slowed and finally stopped.<br />
<br />
Jeffie lay there, panting and finally took in a large intake of oxygen as if he&#39;d been holding his breath underwater.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Jeffie sighed, pulling his still rock-hard cock from Jeff&#39;s mouth and slapping the cum-slicked head against the twin&#39;s nose and cheeks before pulling him in for a deep, tongue-probing kiss, tasting himself on his brother&#39;s lips.<br />
<br />
Jeff, his cheeks full, opened his mouth and let a slow, steady trickle of warm, gooey spunk slip between their identical mouths. The two shared the boy cream, Jeff&#39;s throat pulsing as he tried to swallow while his tongue searched the clone&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
Jeffie then broke the kiss. He grabbed the edge of Jeff&#39;s lips, and licked them, lapping up the spunk that dribbled between the folds of pink flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;So good,&quot; Jeff whispered, wiping his mouth with the back of his sleeve.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should go before the cops come.&quot; Jeffie whispered, looking into his brother&#39;s eyes, &quot;I don&#39;t know how, but someone must have reported the loud grunts, moans, and slurping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Jeff nodded and stood.<br />
<br />
They kissed, then made sure to straighten each other&#39;s clothes before sneaking down the grassy embankment to the trail.  The salty aftertaste of sweet spunk still on their tongues.<br />
<br />
They kept along the riverwalk for several minutes before either spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Socky.&quot; Jeff whispered. &quot;Let&#39;s cross that little stream. It&#39;s shallow there. There&#39;s a nice secluded grassy spot there on the other side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie grinned ran across the water before Jeff said anything more, jumping from rock to rock and laughing all the way. Jeff grinned and chased after his clone, their footsteps splashing water into the air.<br />
<br />
Jeff ran up a little hill covered in grass and stood at the top, catching his breath. He looked out across the water. It wasn&#39;t very far from home.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was fun,&quot; Jeffie said, catching up.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled the clone closer and the boys embraced. Their heads together and the brothers leaned in, their identical soft lips mashing together as their hands ran over their matching bodies.  Jeff had never felt this close to anyone, ever. Not even his actual friends whom he&#39;d known his whole life.  In less than a day this clone had filled a lonely hole in his heart he didn&#39;t know was even there.<br />
<br />
&quot;This has been such a crazy day,&quot; Jeffie whispered, leaning back, staring into his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely.&quot; Jeff agreed, leaning his forehead against his twin, &quot;But a good day, the best day,&quot; Jeff added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Jeffie said, nodding, their faces only centimeters apart. He then bit his lower lip. &quot;Kiss me, brother,&quot; Jeffie pleaded, a begging tone to his voice. &quot;I&#39;ve never felt so alive before, and I know you haven&#39;t either,&quot; He hesitated. &quot;My whole purpose in life, is to be a companion and more. I want that for you, you know. And as far as I&#39;m concerned, I&#39;m alive for you because of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff breathed and went to reply when Jeffie closed the space, kissing him softly yet passionately.<br />
<br />
Jeff had so many feelings, his whole world was a complete maelstrom. He&#39;d created a living breathing clone, they&#39;d kissed, and made out, they had sex, and now, his clone was even giving him love and care. Even if he was a horny teenage clone, or a new living being, whatever he was, Jeff felt it was deeper than anything he could have ever experienced in his life, and he now realized why he made his clone in the first place.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s lips curled, kissing the clone back, a fire in his soul. They were the same person, and Jeffie his soulmate. No girl could ever replace the feeling he had with Jeffie and as corny, weird or Narcissistic as that seemed, even to himself, he knew that what he subconsciously wanted was someone who knew him in ways no others could.  That is why he created Jeffie.<br />
<br />
Jeff grabbed the clone&#39;s soft, wavy brown hair, mashing their faces together. Their lips slipped back and forth. Jeff felt the passion and love radiating from his soul. Jeffie, a person who wanted him to be happy, and who did not hate his idiosyncrasies, or want him to change. The fact that Jeffie was his own clone only confirmed for Jeff that created him for these reasons. The clone was his, to be his own best friend, and so much more. Jeffie was different from Jeff&#39;s actual best friends. Jeffie was an amalgamation of kindness, caring, and lust. And Jeff loved it. His life, and world, could not be better.<br />
<br />
The two lovers broke the kiss a moment later. Both smiling and blushing.  They cuddled there together for hours just watching the stars.</p>
