<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your time back home was pretty uneventful.<br />
Your mother nagged at you of course for being late for dinner but you shut her up pretty easily with your saphire. You ate your dinner on your own and went to your room directly afterwards.<br />
The rest of the evening was spent looking up info and taking notes. You went to bed pretty early so you woke up early as well and spent the rest of the time further refining your plan.<br />
When it was noon you decided it was time to implement your plan.<br />
You rang the bell and was brimming with excitement.<br />
Madison&#39;s mom opened the door.<br />
&quot;Why hello Daniel, what brings you here today&quot; she says you having made sure yesterday she wasn&#39;t suspicious.<br />
&quot;Just visiting&quot; you lie &quot;That isn&#39;t a problem is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course not, we&#39;re always glad to have you&quot;<br />
Grinning you walk through the door that she closes after you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Madison?&quot; you ask.<br />
&quot;Upstairs, she actually went to the bathroom today&quot; Alex says in a proud tone.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; you say hiding a sly grin.<br />
&quot;Yes really&quot; She says excited.<br />
&quot;Good for her&quot; you say as you hang up your jacket.<br />
&quot;Is the thing in the attic ready&quot; you ask in a serious tone.<br />
&quot;Oh, well the key things are there now&quot; she said in a slightly guilty tone &quot;However we weren&#39;t able to secure everything due to time and money restrains&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s unfortunate&quot; you say displeased &quot;But the most important things are still there correct?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, at least I think so&quot;<br />
&quot;Is it okay if I go to check it out?&quot; you ask.<br />
&quot;Of course not&quot; she says friendly.<br />
<br />
After that you walk up the stairs and view the attic.<br />
Despite what she had said you judged it good enough. Her parents must have worked extremely hard to get all of this done in just 8 hours.<br />
You then went downstairs again and gathered up Madison&#39;s parents and her sister and gave them the instructions. You had written them out on a sheet of paper beforehand so you were very specific.<br />
<br />
<br />
After that you went to Madison&#39;s room.<br />
You knocked on the door.<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; you hear.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me, Daniel&quot;<br />
&quot;Daniel?&quot; You hear her say with mixed emotions.<br />
A few seconds later the door opens.<br />
You see her appear with a shirt and a rather short skirt under which you easily saw her diaper.<br />
&quot;Mom, was all enthusiastic when I used the bathroom last evening&quot; she said with an awkward tone.<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it great that you can?&quot; you say as you walk into her room.<br />
&quot;Well, I always could&quot; she snaps back at you.<br />
&quot;Not yesterday you couldn&#39;t&quot; you retort.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess&quot; she said with an uncertain tone.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go to the attic, I trust you kept away from it&quot; you ask her.<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; she retorts in a snarky tone &quot;You commended it to me didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
you didn&#39;t reply to that and just led her to the attic.<br />
<br />
When the two of you stood down the stairs you see Madison starting to fidget and get nervous.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I promise this will be fun&quot; you say with a teasing tone.<br />
&quot;Yeah, but for me or for you?&quot; she retorts.<br />
&quot;For us both&quot;<br />
with that you led her up the stairs.<br />
&quot;Ready or not, here it is&quot; you say as you push the final stairs<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the world?!&quot; Madison screams.<br />
You snicker and follow.<br />
Madison stares at the attic which has been utterly transformed into what could only be described as a giant nursery.<br />
It had a large playmatt with a city on it and a full box full of toddler and children&#39;s toys. In the corner was bed with Winneh the Pooh sheets surrounded by a fence that served as an improvised crib.<br />
There was a fridge and also a picknick chair that served as a makeshift highchair.<br />
Madison stared agape at the items.<br />
&quot;Like them?&quot; you ask.<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; she screams &quot;you are not going to make a baby out of me&quot;<br />
She is about the lunge at you but you catch her. She&#39;s only about half your weight so despite her rage you push her down.<br />
&quot;Calm yourself&quot; you say.<br />
Despite not using the saphire it seemed to work as she calmed down somewhat.<br />
&quot;As I said I&#39;m only going to make it more fun for you and I&#39;m not going to force you into anything&quot;<br />
&quot;You lie!&quot; she said accusingly.<br />
&quot;No!&quot; you say angrily &quot;I&#39;ve done many things Madison but I&#39;ve never lied&quot;<br />
With you towering over her she shrinks back in fear.<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; she said with a sense of guilt.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay&quot; you say.<br />
&quot;But what is this supposed to be?&quot; she asks.<br />
&quot;Let me explain; as long as you are in here you will feel like a toddler&quot; you say &quot;simple&quot;<br />
&quot;But you said you weren&#39;t going to force me&quot; she protested.<br />
&quot;I meant it, you can leave and stop at any time. I just figured that you may want to have fun as a toddler every once in a while&quot; you say smiling.<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; she asks &quot;what do you mean?&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll understand soon enough.&quot; you say as you grabbed your notes and touched the sapphire<br />
~Whenever you are in the attic of your house you will have the emotions and interests of a 2 year old. You will keep all big girl memories and free will but you will be inclined to play with the baby and toddler toys here. When you want something you will feel an inclination to demand it like a toddler would however you can suppress this instinct and do it like a big girl if you really want to. You feel a natural urge to act like a gentle baby towards your parents and your older sister. You can still talk to them like you could otherwise though you feel better acting like a 2 year old. You love to have someone else feed you like a baby as well as that you get a giggle out of making a mess. When in here you feel a natural urge to use your diapers as you are supposed to. It feels relaxing to you and what you&#39;re supposed to do. You can suppress all these urges if you want to. This will only last for as long as you are in the attic and as soon as you leave those effects will disappear. However you will keep all the memories of what has happened up in the attic. You will feel greatly relaxed and extremely focused after a session and the longer you spent there the more that effect is and the longer it lasts~<br />
You read it aloud your notes, making sure you were pronouncing every word correctly.<br />
When you again looked at Madison you see her eyes glazed over as her brain is resetting to such a massive order.<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; You ask with pang of worry.<br />
&quot;What, oh um. Yes I&#39;m fine.&quot; she says. &quot;Just got a little dizzy&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, you did something to me!&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
Whatever the emotions were filtering in or she deduced that her dizziness was your mind control you didn&#39;t know.<br />
&quot;Yes, now you&#39;ll be a toddler whenever you are in the attic. You will do everything the way a toddler would&quot; you say grinning.<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; she screams.<br />
&quot;Calm down&quot; she say.<br />
&quot;NO! NO! this can&#39;t be happening!&quot; she screams holding her head as she forces the thoughts out trying to enter her mind.<br />
&quot;Please, calm down&quot; you plead.<br />
&quot;No! I&#39;m a big Girl, Big Girl, Big Girl-&quot; she rambles on.<br />
It seemed you had no other choice ~Calm down~<br />
instantly she calms herself down and her breathing slows.<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I just kind of lost it there&quot; she says apolitically.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, as I was trying to say you don&#39;t have to do anything with this if you don&#39;t want to&quot;<br />
&quot;what do you mean by that?&quot;<br />
&quot;You will have those toddler thoughts and emotions only in this nursery and nowhere else. You can experience the pleasures of toddlerhood whenever you desire and feel again how it is to be totally carefree and have fun&quot; you say.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; she says her eyes sparkling as the toddler emotions start to fill her head. &quot;I get to play with those?&quot; with your calming order still active her mind doesn&#39;t offer much resistance.<br />
blast, you couldn&#39;t talk to her when she was under the influence of the spell.<br />
&quot;come with me&quot; you say as you walked a few steps down the stairs.<br />
As soon as both feet leave the attic the effects disappear.<br />
&quot;Wait, what was that?&quot; she says confused.<br />
&quot;As I said you will feel like a toddler&quot; you say &quot;don&#39;t worry though, you will only feel like a toddler you won&#39;t think like one. I made sure you will remain in control of yourself&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, whenever you are in there your parents and sister will treat you like a toddler&quot;<br />
&quot;Why? Why did you do this?&quot; she asks.<br />
&quot;Just think of it as a gift to make up for having to wear diapers&quot; you say.<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t what I wanted&quot; she said demanding.<br />
&quot;But it will be something you desire, trust me&quot; you say sly.<br />
&quot;Wait, did you give me another order?&quot; she asks fearfully.<br />
&quot;No, I just made you have fun&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I won&#39;t be a fricking toddler for your amusement&quot; she said shaking her head violently.<br />
&quot;tsk, tsk, tsk, it isn&#39;t for my amusement but for yours.&quot; you correct her &quot;however if you don&#39;t want to do anything here than that&#39;s just fine.&quot;<br />
&quot;It is?&quot; she says unbelieving.<br />
&quot;Sure, I made this for you.&quot; you say as you walk further downstairs &quot;if you ever change your mind you could give it a try&quot;<br />
&quot;If there are any problems with the play sessions in the attic feel free to give me a call&quot; you say leisurely.</p>
