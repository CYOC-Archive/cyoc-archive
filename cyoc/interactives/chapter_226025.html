<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is my incredibly stupid idea for a writing exercise, and it refuses to stay in my head. <br/>
I’m not flinging dirt at any existing authors! This is a free site, please write in whatever way makes you happy and fulfilled. I’m not exactly great at this thing, either.   <br/>
<br/>
Think of it as a fond parody and tribute, no more and no less. <br/>
</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The giant statue Palmers reached for Buster, but the bulldog dodged. In a magical streak of light, he weaved around the swipes of their giant hands, before zooming into the sky. Ty eyed at the far-off dog, grimacing.<br />
<br />
Why? Right when he got to have the whole world as his playground, he&#39;d had this enemy by his side? Defying his will? His ability to change the world as he saw fit? <br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you?&quot;, Ty yelled, angrily. &quot;Some kind of super inter-dimensional <i>police dog?!?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
He quickly wished for Buster to be unable to fly, and lose his powers. Of course, none of it worked, and Buster flew higher. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh. No.&quot; Buster&#39;s humorless laugh boomed in Ty&#39;s head.  &quot;Ty, I&#39;m just someone who cares about his owners. But I&#39;ve taken a peek-&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>BOOM!</b><br />
<br />
With a quick wish, Ty caused a massive lightning bolt to strike at Buster (despite there not a single cloud around), and send him plummeting downwards. The strikes repeated over and over, sending the dog hit the nearby road hard. A dust cloud formed, with sprinkles of asphalt landing around, while a few passing cars skidded to a halt. <br />
<br />
 Ty smirked, as the Palmer statues stomped over the small new crater on the road; ready to lay hurt on the magic dog. <br />
Before the stone giants could try squashing it with their feet, though, Buster zoomed out, flying right at Ty at a bullet&#39;s speed. Fortunately for Ty and his superfast reflexes, he cleanly dodged it, before laying out flurry of rapid punches. The super-powered boy and dog zoomed into to air, creating a sonic boom that parted the clouds. They dodged, spun and dueled; landing attacks on one another. It was a sight that would be a marvel to anyone watching from the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;Superpowers, remember?&quot;, Ty taunted, as he furiously parried the magical lasers and hits from Buster. Buster did the same, dodging Ty&#39;s lightning strikes and conjured obstacles, like blades, chainguns, concrete blocks and buzzsaws.<br />
<br />
Ty made another wish, and instantly, an army of clones of himself appeared in the sky. All were controlled by him, with the same level of immortality, and they zipped around, attacking Buster and trying to surround him. To Ty&#39;s irritation, however, Buster warded them off, and escaped every one of their attempts to grab and hold them. He kept going after Ty. <br />
<br />
&quot;<i>You&#39;re not going to win!!</i>&quot;, yelled Ty. &quot;<i>We could fight for a million years, and I&#39;ll just keep wishing myself to keep fighting! <b>You hear me, you fucking bitch?!?</b></i>&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. <i>You&#39;re sure about that?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Ty could send a flurry of flying chainsaws at the dog, Buster let out a loud, distorted bark. The air around him shimmered, and that shimmer grew into a strange, flickering orb that instantly expanded out. Ty couldn&#39;t even react when it surrounded him, and the teen was blinded with light.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the -&quot;<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
&quot;-Fuck? AHH!&quot;<br />
Ty Suddenly Started Falling Down From the Sky, With Wind Roaring Past His Ears. His Clones Were Nowhere To Be Seen.<br />
Ty Tried Flying, But It Didn&#39;t Work. And His Superpowers Didn&#39;t Work Either. Behind Him, What Looked Like A Bright Dog-Shaped Comet Was Rocketing Right At Him.<br />
<br />
&#39;I WISH I&#39;M INVINCIBLE AND CAN FLY!&#39;, Ty Wished Quickly, Right Before Buster Struck Him At High Speed. Ty Was Knocked Aside, Spinning And Dazed, But Not Injuired. <br />
<br />
&#39;I WISH FOR ENERGY SHIELD!&#39;. Right On Time, Ty Blocked Another Massive Laser Attack From The Dog. Ty Wished The Rest Of His Superpowers Back, From His Endurance To His Ability To Fly. And Soon, Ty Stopped Falling, And He Levitating Himself Back In The Air, Ready to Strike. Although, No Less Alarmed. <br />
<br />
&quot;How The Hell Did You Do That???,&quot; Ty Demanded. Again, The Dog Tried to Strike At Ty&#39;s Shield, But Nothing Could Get Through. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dimension Shift,&quot; Said Buster, Growling. &quot;I Converted An Area Around Us As A Copy Of Another Dimension And Timeline. One Where You Haven&#39;t Wished SuperPowers Yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
It Did Feel Weird, Ty Noticed. Maybe It&#39;s The Concussions But Everything Felt So Loud With So Much Impact. So...Capital?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well It Didn&#39;t Work!&quot; Said Ty, With An Evil Grin. Buster Eyed Right At Him With His Glowing Eyes. <br />
&quot;No. I Was Not Fast Enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Buster Barked. Ty&#39;s Smile Dropped, And He Yelled As The World Shimmered And Went White-<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Now Ty the self-created God and spirit paladin supreme<br />
found himself waking to one other bizarre universe-pocket, abscent of power once again. <br />
<br />
So the teen boy Ty came to consciousness,and saw himself plummeting from the planets forces of gravity once again.Buster the sorcerer-dog was in closer vicinity with his fearsome laser and supernatural powers. But fortune abound! Ty wished himself a protected neutron energy shield oncemore, and so he was bodily untouched.<br />
alas, Ty did not wish for flight all too quickly, thus the boy was flung like a ball across the American skies.<br />
<br />
&quot;God fucking shit!&quot;, Ty bellowed as the teen mind conjured a flying wish once more, even as his canine opponent struck at thine&#39;s shield with fast pace. So boy wished, and upon the air above both boy and dog, a great shadow formed, as a fullsize undamaged duplication of the R.M.S. Titanic was birthed in the sky, and with it a squadron of German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters of the 1941 variety. <br />
<br />
the grand ship plummeted akin to a meteorite, forcing magic canine to fly out of harm&#39;s way. Enough time to allow for Ty to strike back with his own powers, with flurry of plasma lightning, magma and bladed objects, while the old Luftwaffe strafed and shot at Ty&#39;s most despicable target. <br />
<br />
now Buster the dog struggles to strike back, <br />
and with Ty on behind, he escapes to the ground, as the titanic crashes down on the distant neighborhood with a mighty crash. The shockwave roles over to the diner, whose patrons most oddly continue their meals unscathed. Most oddly, a cold fusion engine of a 22nd century spacecraft now settles upon the grass, though providing no effect to the current battle. <br />
<br />
So Buster takes cover amongst the trees as Ty approaches with the most malicious and bloodlust of smiles. With grandest step forward, not dissimilar to a galactic starship&#39;s hyper-jump in close quarters, Ty rushes at Buster for a final attack.<br />
<br />
But it was not to be, as Buster barked. <br />
<br />
0000000<br />
<br />
Ty all but tripped over his own feet, as the adolescent boy&#39;s face planted itself onto the soil. <br />
<br />
&quot;ARGH!!!&quot; he yelled in fury, while Buster the bulldog caught air in his lungs, regaining his energy. The malevolent god-child picked himself from the ground. It seems they were some ways from the burger diner where they had started.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are aware you can stop this conflict,&quot; said Buster, staring from afar with spectral eyes. &quot;Simply restore my family to what it was. No more, and no less.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<b>CURSE YOU, OH VILE DOG!!</b>&quot;, Ty screeched, with fists clenched in that of anger.  &quot;You do violations on mine person and my own enjoyment of my abilities? I WILL DEFY YOU! Thou shalt not lay the cruel weights of judging defeat upon my h...head?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty silenced himself in deepest confusion, wondering why his dialogue was thus so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...well so. I wish again for my immortalit-&quot;<br />
<br />
Another great laser-blast hit Ty, but most fortunately for the youth, the spell had taken work, and Ty was once more unscathed. He felt immense pain, however, and Buster rushed forth upon the God-teen, ready for another flurry of attacks. <br />
<br />
The spectacular battle commenced again on the ground, amidst a light forest with trees uprooted from the force of Ty and Buster&#39;s attacks. Once again in prime, powered form, Ty flung up a nearby oak tree with two hands, and propelled it at the overpowered dog like a giant javelin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here, blasted mindless hound! My bark for your bark!&quot;, Ty quipped, sneering as Buster quickly smashed the flying tree to splinters and twigs. A beam struck at Ty, and the arrogant youth recalled too late that he neglected wishing for a shield of energy. And so he was knocked back, with head striking another tree. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gaw!&quot;, Ty grunted, as the adolescent tried to recover. But up overhead, Buster hovered over the fallen boy. Several uprooted trees hovering by the dogs side.  surrounded by glowing, telekenetic energy. The teen boy braced for an entire forest to be projected at his own spot. <br />
<br />
The ground shook. Buster turned, and with alarm, he dropped the trees as a great hand swung for the dog. The Palmers, having been turned statue-like, stone-like and gigantic, had rejoined the fight, stomping all the way to this location. The grand wolf, once the teen girl Suzie, was first to attack, knocking Buster aside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, one&#39;s memory has failed me,&quot; said Ty to himself, most haughtily. &quot;But that brings both negatives and positives!&quot; <br />
The other transformed members of the Palmers followed suit, with the anthro-coyote father Frank diving at Buster, and landing with thunderous impact. Buster most narrowly escaped, but was then slapped down by the pawed hands of Katie; the little girl now a giant anthro-lioness. The rest of the vast furry animal giants crowded around Buster. <br />
<br />
&quot;Foolish canine. You think it is one&#39;s ability to strike down a god?&quot;, Ty asked, as he got up from the ground, panting tiredly and painfully. &quot;Sick creature, vile and fascist-like...thou are a foolish one indeed!&quot;<br />
<br />
But then, most unfortunately, Ty heard a loud and distorted bark, and the air and battleground broke into static-like distortion. Before Ty could escape, his vision blinded...<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s vision returned, as he found himself suddenly recovered. though he was once again absent of powers. <br />
&quot;ugh...what now?&quot;, he asked, as he came to his feet. &quot;hmm, talking normally...huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
the giant Palmer statues were gone. or at least, they weren&#39;t stone statues anymore. Instead, the Palmer family were now giant anthropomorphic animals complete with fur and flesh. most strikingly, all of them were buff males, with sheaths already unrolling to show off giant, erect cocks dripping with seed. they were also wearing ornate, metal crests around their necks similar to collars, decorated with medieval patterns and gold. <br />
<br />
the anthro-lion that had been Katie was now sitting on the ground, pleasuring his own huge, pointed feline cock. Katie now sported a male lion&#39;s main, and his balls were the size of a beachball each. &quot;ohh, so horny....&quot;, he moaned, before he then dipped his head in, and licked his member with his own tongue. <br />
<br />
&quot;hey dudes,&quot; said a giant jackal who was once 14-year-old Alex. he gestured to the vulpine dick on his crotch. &quot;anybody want this hot thing up their asses?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;only if I get my thing up your ass, Aexus,&quot; said a male, muscular tiger anthro, which Ty assumed was the mother Helen. <br />
<br />
&quot;whatever you want, my handsome Helios.&quot; the jackal presented himself, and his former mother took the invitation. soon, the 11-foot-tall male animal-men were piling together into a colossal orgy, putting penises into anuses, or suckling them with their hungry snouts. the ground shook from their thrusts, and the air filled with sounds of rutting and moaning. <br />
<br />
Ty stood by this massive spectacle, amused, with a hardness coming from under his own pants too. he figured this was probably not what that idiot dog Buster intended for his family-<br />
<br />
Oh shit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I WISH I WAS LIVING METAL!!!&quot; Ty shouted, right before Buster could impact Ty. once again, the boy was flung through the air, his skin now made of shiny titanium. he found himself hurling out of the forest and over a busy highway, as he instinctively covered his head. panicking, he tried wishing for flight again. <br />
<br />
<b>BLAM!</b><br />
<br />
he found hitting through a concrete and brick wall, and then hit some kind of large machine, before falling onto a carpeted floor. groaning, Ty lifted himself up. his body had just struck a Mortal Kombat arcade machine; one of several others around him. <br />
<br />
&quot;woah, a robot!!&quot;, exclaimed a little boy. he and several other boys and teens were looking in awe and confusion, as at the metal-skinned Ty got to his feet. he knew this place, it was an arcade inside a shopping mall around thirty minutes from his house, with all kinds of gaming machines. there were many young people hanging around, along with an annoyed but concerned adult attentant who was walking over from the counter.<br />
<br />
&#39;hmmm...bodyguards&#39;, thought Ty. deviously. he prepared a wish, imagining ever person in the arcade turning into his soldiers.<br />
<br />
until Ty heard a loud bark...<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Ty quickly got up and ran behind one of the arcade cabinets as he heard Buster descending with his flying magic. He went behind a coin-machine and started wishing up his usual powers again, while the little boy and his friends watched in confusion. “I wish for super flight and invincibility!” he whispered, “And I wish for- huh?” In front of him, the little boy and his friends were moaning as their bodies stretched taller, and their shirts were stretching as their chests grew out into perky D-cup boobs with tits stretching against the fabric of their clothes, and their shorts wrapping tightly around their new feminine hips. &quot;Oh, we feel so good!&quot;, uttered the boy,  as his hair grew long and lips became more puckered and kissable. around the arcade, all the young and teen boys were also transforming into hot grown-up women, who began either touching themselves or making out with each other with tits and DD breasts squeezing against one another. Ty saw Buster looking around in mild distress, and Ty quickly wished for super strength, before bulleting right at Buster. They knocked through a wall, and into a nearby department store, causing people shopping there to flee, Ty threw a punch, but Buster, once again, barked-<br />
<br />
- - -<br />
<br />
Ty groaned, as his de-powered fist hit against Buster&#39;s energy barrier. Again, he wished for his powers, right as Buster clutched Ty&#39;s shield-covered body with his telekenesis. Though the teen stopped hurting and knew he was invulnerable from Buster again, he struggled out of Buster&#39;s magical grasp. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you can turn people into stuff too?!?&quot;, Ty yelled, amidst the smashed clothing aisle of the department store &quot;Then why the fuck are you judging me for?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was an accident,&quot; said Buster, sternly, as he squeezed tightly on Ty&#39;s shielded form.  &quot;It&#39;s a side effect of my dimensional powers, which is why I use it as a last resort. I will fix everything when I&#39;m done...which is why I am NOT like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dog floated towards Ty, and the shielded teen winced as he felt Buster&#39;s grip tightening.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to undo what you have done, and leave innocent people out of your fantasies.&quot;, said the dog. &quot;Or else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Or else what?!?</i> We keep running around, with you never beating me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That may be so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gritting his teeth, Ty sent a supersonic punch through his own barrier, forcing Buster to release his telekenetic hold. Ty zoomed off, escaping quickly through the winding aisle of the department store, as he thought of a strategy to defeat this irritating animal. <br />
<br />
He heard a bark. And once again, the world shimmered...</p>
