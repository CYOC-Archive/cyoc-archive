<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The hunger was so great that he had to stop at a buffet on the way home.<br />
<br />
As he sat there shoveling in plate after plate with little to no rest more than one set of eyes watched in awe <br />
and disgust at the 600 pound man.<br />
<br />
A button would pop here and there exposing a flabby chest or a cavernous belly button.<br />
<br />
The manager came up to Trevor and asked him to leave that he has had enough. Trevor ignored him and kept <br />
eating. When the police were called and he was escorted out the door he felt a rumble in his belly. Having <br />
filled it with 20 pounds of food he shouldn't have been hungry but he was.<br />
<br />
Trevor was waddling home when he saw a well dressed Italian man standing next to a Lincoln.<br />
<br />
Hey boy. I saw you in there. I got a proposition for you.<br />
<br />
Not interested.<br />
<br />
It will be worth your while.<br />
<br />
Look I got a job at Transform You.<br />
<br />
Really. I know Brian but I have never seen you there.<br />
<br />
I'm a tech you probably don't see me much.<br />
<br />
There was a hansom man there I remember but he was lost several years ago and so skinny. You couldn't be him.<br />
<br />
It's a long story but I'm not interested.<br />
<br />
Look I am a own many resteraunts here in town including the one you just almost devoured. What would you say <br />
if I said you could eat for free.<br />
<br />
Not interested.<br />
<br />
Look I like to see a man eat and you can eat more than any man I have ever seen. It does my heart good to see <br />
you go at it with such abandon.<br />
<br />
I SAID NO!<br />
<br />
Noticing Trevor rubbing his ass on a post the man came up to Trevor and grabbing a massive globe of ass he <br />
said then how about I fill this end.<br />
<br />
Now Trevor had never had gay sex before but the changes the his boss had made were that he was gay and horny <br />
as hell. A hornyness to rival his hunger.<br />
<br />
Trevor just couldn't resist. OK maybe just a couple times. Trevor found himself saying. He climbed in the back <br />
of the Lincoln causing great stress on the struts. The man got in the other side and the driver, a big muscled <br />
man drove off.<br />
<br />
The drove for what seemed like an hour coming to a very nice mansion. The man paying attention to Trevor's <br />
distended belly. By the time they had arrived Trevor's was almost off and his pants were unbuttoned.<br />
<br />
The driver and man got out and had to help Trevor out of the car. He was wedged in.<br />
<br />
Come on fatboy. Leading Trevor upstairs. The muscle man steadied Trevor until they got to a nice suite. The <br />
man gave the driver a few orders and he left. <br />
<br />
Trevor's pants had dropped off of him as he stepped out of the car showing his tighty whities. And his shirt <br />
was removed as they led him upstairs.<br />
<br />
On our knees fatboy. <br />
<br />
Now Trevor didn't think this was normal but he did as asked.<br />
<br />
Now lean forward and get on all fours.<br />
<br />
As Trevor complied the man got undressed. Having never really looked at a man before he saw what looked like a <br />
massive piece of meat and was scared. It was 18 inches long and as thick as a 2 litre bottle.<br />
<br />
That thing can't go in me.<br />
<br />
Don't worry it will fit nicely.<br />
<br />
The muscle man came back pushing something low to the ground.<br />
<br />
Here I thought you might want something to eat. The muscle man pushed it in front of Trevor and he stuck his <br />
head in it like a pig trough.<br />
<br />
Grasping the fatboy by the love handles he pulled himself into Trevor and it did go in easily.<br />
<br />
5 or 6 times the man came inside of Trevor eventually tiring out. But Trevor kept eating as the muscle man <br />
kept filling the trough.<br />
<br />
Well into the night Trevor became full and crawled into bed with the man and his belly rested on top of the <br />
man.<br />
<br />
When morning arrived the trough was filled and Trevor couldn't help himself.<br />
<br />
I have to go out and do some work I will be back later.<br />
<br />
The man gave the muscle man some orders to keep the trough filled all day long. And even gave him permission <br />
to use the fatboy if he wanted.<br />
<br />
One of his stops was at the Transform You where he talked to Brian. They had a great idea for Trevor and when <br />
the man got home he told the fatboy to get into the car and they headed to Transform You.<br />
<br />
Look Trevor I talked to Brian and he is going to make you skinny again.<br />
<br />
Oh thank you.<br />
<br />
But I couldn't get him to make you not gay. He said you have some learning to do. Maybe we can get him to <br />
change you back fully.<br />
<br />
Trevor looked down but said ok.<br />
<br />
As they arrived at Transform You Brian was waiting and they put Trevor into a room where in minutes he was <br />
back to his former size.<br />
<br />
Now come on home I would like to see how well you can ride this.<br />
<br />
Trevor's sexual addition made him obedient to the man but as they got home there was still the trough in the <br />
bedroom. Bend over and stick your head in the trough the man said.<br />
<br />
As Trevor saw the food he became ravenous and stuffed himself with abandon as he had before.<br />
<br />
I thought you said you wanted me skinny.<br />
<br />
I did. And you are.<br />
<br />
But you are going to get as big as you were before.<br />
<br />
WHY!<br />
<br />
I LIKE FATBOYS AND I WANT TO GROW YOU THAT FAT. We took away your weight but not your hunger for both sex and <br />
food.<br />
<br />
In 4 years Trevor was back to well over 600 and they headed back to Transform You where Trevor was made skinny <br />
again and youthened a bit and the process started all over again.</p>
