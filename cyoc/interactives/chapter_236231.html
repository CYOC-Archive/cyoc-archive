<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they lay there, Sam continued scrolling on his phone, clearly trying to find something to watch. After a few moments, he looked over at Jesse with a mischievous smile. “Oh! I know what’ll cheer you up.” <br />
<br />
Jesse raised an eyebrow, curious but also slightly nervous. “What?”<br />
<br />
Sam opened up a folder on his phone, and a video thumbnail appeared—of them in their cheer uniforms, performing a routine on the football field. Jesse felt his stomach lurch as he recognized himself front and center, leading the group in a high-energy cheer.<br />
<br />
“Check this out.” Sam said with a grin. “This is from last month’s game against Westview. We totally crushed it.” He hit play, and the video started with the cheer team bouncing in place before launching into the routine.<br />
<br />
Jesse’s eyes widened as he watched himself, or rather, the version of him in this reality. He was flipping, tumbling, and hitting every move with perfect precision and confidence. The video was filled with cheers, laughter, and a high-pitched excitement from the crowd. His hair was pulled back in a neat ponytail, and his uniform sparkled under the stadium lights. <br />
<br />
“That’s… me?” Jesse muttered, more to himself than to Sam. It was still so surreal to see this alternate version of his life play out in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Of course that’s you!” Sam nudged him playfully. “Look at you killing it! You were the star of the show, as always. You’re, like, the best flyer on the team.”<br />
<br />
Jesse didn’t know what to say. He barely recognized this version of himself—the confidence, the energy, the way he moved with such ease and grace. It was hard to imagine that just yesterday he’d been focused on football, and now, here he was, the center of attention in a world where cheerleading was his domain.<br />
<br />
“You really don’t remember doing any of this?” Sam asked, a hint of concern in his voice as he glanced over at Jesse.<br />
<br />
Jesse shook his head slowly, eyes still glued to the screen. “It’s so weird. I mean… I’ve never done any of this before. At least, not in the way I remember.”<br />
<br />
Sam paused the video, his playful smile fading as he took Jesse’s words in. “Are you serious, Jess? Like, for real? You don’t remember all those hours of practice, the competitions? The team would be lost without you.”<br />
<br />
Jesse swallowed hard, the weight of it all crashing over him again. He wanted to say something, to explain how jarring it was to see himself like this, but the words wouldn’t come out. Instead, he just nodded slightly, his voice small. “Yeah, it’s just… a lot to process.”<br />
<br />
Sam, sensing the shift in Jesse’s mood, gave him a supportive smile. “Hey, it’s alright. I get it. It’s been a crazy day for you. But you’ll be fine, Jess. You always are. That’s why we all look up to you.” He played the video again, and they both watched in silence.<br />
<br />
Jesse’s mind spun as he watched himself smile, laugh, and high-five the other cheerleaders at the end of the routine. He didn’t know how he was supposed to live up to this version of himself tomorrow, or any other day for that matter. The thought of going to practice, of being this outgoing, confident person who led the cheer squad, felt impossible.<br />
<br />
Sam, clearly picking up on his anxiety, nudged him gently. “Don’t stress, alright? You’ve got this. And if you ever feel lost, I’m right here.”<br />
<br />
Jesse managed a small smile, grateful for Sam’s support, even if he didn’t feel entirely deserving of it. As the video ended, the room fell into a quiet lull, the hum of Sam’s phone the only sound between them.<br />
<br />
For a brief moment, everything felt strangely normal again—just two friends hanging out, watching videos, like nothing had changed. But Jesse knew, deep down, that everything had. And tomorrow, he would have to figure out how to navigate this strange new world that had become his life.<br />
<br />
As the silence between them grew more comfortable, Sam suddenly sat up. &quot;Hey, let’s take a selfie! We haven’t taken one in forever.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jesse blinked, caught off guard. &quot;Uh, sure, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Jesse could fully react, Sam scooted closer and threw an arm around him, leaning in. Jesse barely had time to force a smile before Sam snapped the photo. Sam quickly typed something on the screen and hit post, a mischievous grin spreading across his face.<br />
<br />
Jesse’s phone buzzed a moment later. He glanced at the screen and froze. There, on Snapchat, was the picture they’d just taken, with the caption: <i>Sleepover with bae</i><br />
<br />
His heart raced as he stared at the word “bae,” trying to process the implications. It felt strange and intimate, a term that Jesse had never associated with Sam before — or anyone, really. But now, in this new reality, it was apparently something normal.<br />
<br />
Jesse let out a nervous chuckle. &quot;Bae, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam just laughed and shrugged. &quot;What? We always call each other that, Jess. You’re my bestie.&quot; He winked, then nudged Jesse playfully. &quot;Besides, it’s true. I’m your favorite, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse forced another smile, his mind still spinning. He wasn’t used to this level of closeness, especially not with a guy friend. It was another reminder of how much had changed. &quot;Yeah… sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam leaned back against the pillows, seemingly oblivious to Jesse’s inner turmoil. &quot;We look cute in that pic though. Watch, we’ll probably get a bunch of replies by the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse glanced back at the photo. His expression looked more forced than he realized, but Sam’s grin was wide and genuine, like he didn’t have a care in the world. How could Sam seem so carefree, so comfortable in this strange reality?<br />
<br />
As Sam settled in, seemingly satisfied with the selfie, Jesse’s thoughts drifted back to the word &quot;bae.&quot; Did it mean more in this reality than just “best friend”? He wasn’t sure if he wanted to find out, but there was something strangely comforting about Sam’s unwavering friendship, even in a world that felt so foreign.<br />
<br />
As Sam put his phone away and turned off the bedside lamp, the room fell into darkness, with only the faint glow from Jesse’s phone illuminating the space. Jesse stared at the screen for a few moments, feeling a mixture of confusion and something he couldn’t quite name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight, bae.&quot; Sam mumbled sleepily, turning over.<br />
<br />
Jesse hesitated, then whispered back, &quot;Goodnight.&quot; He lay there for a long time, staring at the ceiling, wondering how he was going to navigate this new life — and whether things would ever feel normal again.<br />
<br />
As the room settled into silence, the only sound was the soft, rhythmic breathing of Sam beside him. Jesse lay still, his body tense, his mind racing. The unfamiliar sensation of having another boy sleeping next to him felt suffocating. He couldn’t help but focus on every little movement Sam made — the way he shifted under the covers, the occasional brush of his arm, the sound of his breathing. It was all too much.<br />
<br />
In his old life, Jesse had never shared a bed with another guy. The thought of it would’ve been weird, uncomfortable even. But now, in this bizarre version of reality, it seemed completely normal. Sam acted like it was nothing, like they’d done it a thousand times before. But to Jesse, it was disorienting, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t relax.<br />
<br />
He stared up at the ceiling, trying to steady his breathing, his mind jumping from one anxious thought to the next. <i>How am I going to deal with school tomorrow? What if everyone figures out I’m not… me? What if I can’t keep pretending to be this person I don’t even know?</i><br />
<br />
Jesse shifted, trying to get comfortable, but the sheets felt heavy, trapping him in his own confusion. His thoughts spiraled. Everything was wrong. His family, his friends, even his own body. He didn’t belong in this world, and the more he thought about it, the more suffocated he felt. He wanted to escape, to get out of this room, out of this bed, out of this life that wasn’t his.<br />
<br />
Sam stirred beside him, mumbling something in his sleep, and Jesse’s heart skipped a beat. He couldn’t shake the feeling of discomfort, lying so close to someone he was supposed to know but felt like a stranger. <br />
<br />
<i>I don’t even know who I am anymore,</i> he thought bitterly.<br />
<br />
He rolled over, facing the wall, his back to Sam. He squeezed his eyes shut, willing himself to fall asleep, but the unease gnawed at him, refusing to let go. His heart pounded in his chest, the tension in his body making it impossible to relax.<br />
<br />
<i>I can’t do this.</i> He wanted to cry, scream, anything to release the overwhelming anxiety building inside him. But he couldn’t. Not with Sam right there, not when he had to keep up the charade. So he stayed silent, trapped in his thoughts, waiting for sleep that felt like it would never come.<br />
<br />
The darkness of the room felt oppressive, and with every passing minute, the weight of the situation bore down harder on him. He wanted his old life back, his old friends, his old sense of self. But for now, he was stuck in a reality he didn’t understand, with a best friend he barely recognized, and the terrifying knowledge that tomorrow would bring more of the same.<br />
<br />
Eventually, exhaustion overtook him, and Jesse’s thoughts blurred into the haze of uneasy sleep. But even then, the discomfort lingered, like a shadow that wouldn’t let go.</p>
