<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">7 days have passed since Jack&#39;s virus started to spread. Kid population had suddenly decreased and it had even disappeared in some towns.<br />
<br />
Jason was looking through his window completely bored. When his parents heard rumors about a virus that turns kids into adults, they naturally didn&#39;t believe it. Even though several kids in their neighborhood had disappeared and unknown adults started to be seen around. All of them resembling the missing kids but being extra femenine or masculine.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until one day a strange video showing a kid turning into an adult became viral in social media when they believed in the virus and started to overprotect their son. Jason can&#39;t leave his bedroom all day except for eating and bathing. Jason loved to play in his backyard, so it was like a torture to only see it through his window.<br />
<br />
That night, while Jason and his parents where sleeping. He started to hear some music coming from his backyard. He woke up and looked through his window. It was his neighbor who was having a party. Jason was 9 years old and his neighbor was 17, but they used to be good to each other. Sometimes, they played video games together or watch movies.<br />
<br />
The music was getting louder and the party seemed super fun. Jason was tempted to sneak out of his home and go but he knew he&#39;d be disobeying his parents. Also, he didn&#39;t want to become an adult like the kid in that video. He thought about it for a minute but when he heard his neighbor laughing he decided to make a small visit.<br />
<br />
Jason was carefully trying to don&#39;t make any noise until he was outside his house. Then he started to run to the party. He jumped over the fence like he has done a million times before and started to wander around his neighbor&#39;s pool.<br />
<br />
There were many people around his neighbor age who just ignored that a kid was walking around them. Jason was so distracted by those guys that he didn&#39;t see a man in front of him and Jason collided with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Jason apologized while the man turned around. He was surprised of seeing that it was his neighbor, although he looked a little bit different than what Jason remembered. His neighbor used to be very skinny but now he looked very strong and because he was wearing just a swimsuit, Jason also noticed that he was quite hairy now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason?! What are you doing here?!&quot; His neighbor asked him with a very concerned look in his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was really bored in my house and I noticed you have a party. So I decided to make a quick visit.&quot; Jason replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;You shouldn&#39;t have come.&quot; The neighbor said. &quot;I&#39;m infected and my friends too. We are making a party because the virus made us manlier. We were 17, so it didn&#39;t affect us too much, but you..&quot; He didn&#39;t finish his sentence when he heard the doorbell. &quot;Who can it be?&quot; He said as he walked to the main door. &quot;Jason, you must leave!&quot;<br />
<br />
The neighbor opened his door and there it was Jason&#39;s father who seemed pretty annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, can you turn your music down? My family is trying to sleep.&quot; Jason&#39;s dad said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll do it immediately.&quot; The neighbor replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Jason&#39;s dad said as he shook hands with the guy ignoring that he looked manlier than before. Jason&#39;s dad left the place without knowing that he got infected. When the neighbor returned to the pool. He found a terrified Jason who was almost crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my dad, it is?&quot; Jason was very worried. &quot;Does he know that I&#39;m here?!&quot; He was shaking. &quot;I got infected. That means that I&#39;m going to become a grown-up like you? What am I going to do? My parents will go crazy!! I don&#39;t want to be an adult!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason, Jason. Calm down.&quot; The neighbor told him. &quot;I know you are scared. But you&#39;re not alone. We are going to help you to overcome this.&quot; He smiled and Jason tried to smile back. &quot;I know, come back here when you become a big boy. We will make a party for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason returned to his home. This time he was extra careful because his father was drinking some milk in the kitchen. He had just realized that his neighbor was infected and he regretted shaking hands with him. He wasn&#39;t sure he was infected but it was a possibility and therefore he was a risk for his son.<br />
<br />
Jason managed to arrive in his bedroom. He slowly closed the door and got on his bed. He covered himself with blankets and closed his eyes trying to sleep. However, suddenly, Jason&#39;s stomach began to make a funny sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; Jason groaned as his stomach started to ache. He started to feel sick but he refused to get out of bed. Light sweat began to form on his forehead and he could feel his heart pounding in his chest. Just then, Jason started to squirm and sweat all over his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh! I thought I would have more time!&quot; Jason said as he kept groaning, sweating and squirming. He could feel his body starting to change. His body has begun to stretch. He was growing into a lean young preteen. His pajamas felt tight and his socks were making his feet so sore now.<br />
<br />
He can feel his arms began to lengthen out of his shirt and half of his stomach was now exposed followed by his pants riding up his lengthening legs. His heart was racing as he felt a second growth spurt starting to happen.<br />
<br />
This time his shoulders began to widen and his back formed thick muscle. His chest started to get bigger and his stomach became more defined with a thick set of abs. His arms were the next things to grow massive muscles. Jason’s nipples began to harden as they were being pushed out as pecs began to form on his large chest.<br />
<br />
While this was all occurring on his torso, his lower half was going through some massive growth as well. Jason turned onto his stomach trying relieve the pain but it didn’t help. His legs were growing larger as they started to shred and burst his small pants until they were totally free. His socks began to show signs of strain as his feet began to push out from the fabric. It hurt Jason so bad as his feet were growing rapidly to match his massively growing body. His legs were now so long that his calves and feet came out of the bed.<br />
<br />
Just then Jason felt his socks burst open and shred revealing a pair of wide size 15 feet. Jason can feel them heavily hanging out of his bed. All that was left were his tight white undies trying to stay intact against Jason&#39;s growth spurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I don&#39;t wanna be an adult!&quot; Jason begged with a distinguishing manly voice as he kept groaning. Now, it was Jason&#39;s last bit of boyhood that began to grow. His dick was enlarging while balls inflated inside his already thight underwear.<br />
<br />
He can feel his growing package pushing against his small undies until they began to tear and rip as Jason&#39;s ass began to swell and mature from behind. He could feel his ass pumping with muscle and becoming so big that Jason could feel it making a pothole in his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuuh! I feel so weird.&quot; Jason said in his now deep voice as he wiggled his now fat toes. He suddenly jumped out of his bed and wobbled up to his feet as he tried to get used to his new self. He stumbled from the size of his large feet but slowly got the hang of walking in his new 6&#39;3 massive body. He walked over to the mirror in his room to see how bad the transformation made him.<br />
<br />
When Jason looked in the mirror he noticed that he looked like one of his neighbor&#39;s friends. He even was as hairy as them. He touched his face and felt his new beard.<br />
<br />
All that was left of Jason&#39;s clothes was a pair of torn and ripped undies that he didn&#39;t know why they were wet now. He was so embarrassed of looking inside Tthem and tried to ignore the strong urge to touch his junk.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know what to do when he heard his neighbor&#39;s music again. He remembered that there was a party over the fence and he was welcomed to join it. He thought that he can&#39;t go back to sleep after what happened to him. So, he tried to adjust his ridiculously small underwear and went back to the party.</p>
