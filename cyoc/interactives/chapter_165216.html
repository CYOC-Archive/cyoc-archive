<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He sat on the bed, wearing nothing but a robe. Staring down at his chest, trying to get used to what he was seeing, he was finding it difficult to wrap his mind around that he had tits. Reaching hesitantly up, he cupped the two C cup mounds and feeling the soft fabric of his robe rubbing against the soft flesh, brushing against his erect nipples, he gasped in pleasure and uttered an, &quot;Uh,&quot; before quickly dropping his hands back down and pressed his palms into the fabric of the comforter covering his bed.<br />
<br />
It was one of three strange things that had happened to him today. And though he had expected it would happen, he was unprepared and troubled by the latest transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better yet,&quot; he thought, &quot;I&#39;m bothered by all three oddities.&quot;<br />
<br />
He guessed it had started earlier this morning. When he had left for work his nipples had still been erect and sensitive to stimulation. And the soft fabric of the bra rubbing against them hadn&#39;t helped matters. When he got to work, and he had punched him, he was glad to be able to put from his mind as much as he could. Kept busy bouncing back and for between women&#39;s and men&#39;s wear, it wasn&#39;t until his lunch break, he&#39;d accidentally worked through his first break, that he was painfully reminded about what was happening as he headed towards the back of the store.<br />
<br />
The call of nature causing him to divert to the women&#39;s toilet, he sat down to do his business as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Troubled by how much he was getting used to going in the women&#39;s lavatory to do his business, and that he sat down to pee even though he still had a penis, Edgar was distracted from his thoughts when he looked over to grab some toilet paper to wipe himself, but stopped when something caught his attention from corner of his eye. Looking down he couldn&#39;t quite grasp what he saw, but he was sure there was something off about how he looked. Forgetting momentarily his need to wipe, he continued to stare downward, trying to figure out what looked different.<br />
<br />
And then he had it as he realised that, at some point, his chest had started to push outward.<br />
<br />
Flabbergasted by what he was barely seeing, he pulled the collar of his shirt forward, stared downward, let go, then grasped the hem of the garment and pulled it up. His torso exposed, he stared at the bra he had on and the two milky white breasts that had started to push the undergarment outward. Only a double A cup, he was still taken aback at what he was seeing as he gasped, &quot;Holy shit. I&#39;m growing tits,&quot; before clapping a hand over his mouth as he realised he had uttered it out loud.<br />
<br />
Glad the restroom was empty, Edgar continued to stare down at his newly formed breasts a moment longer before, with a fumbling hand, he reached up and gently pushed the cup down that covered the right one. Exposed, he found the petite round blob of flesh with the erect nipple sensitive as a cool breeze caressed it. Disturbed how it felt, he was tempted to touch it, to see how it felt when touched, but then hastily readjusted the cup over it as best as he could. Pulling back down his shirt, Edgar finished, stood, pulled up his pants and underwear, and after tucking in his work shirt he exited the stall. Heading for the sink, he began to wash his hands. Looking in the mirror as he did, he studied his reflection, taking note of how much he looked like a women with the way his hair was, the way the clothes he was wearing hugged his body, and the fact that his chest pushed outward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if it is only a little ways,&quot; he thought as he finished, exited the bathroom and headed for the break room for his lunch break.<br />
<br />
Certain his breasts would get bigger, he hoped they wouldn&#39;t get to some ridiculous proportion, wondered what size they would get, and considered maybe the bra he was wearing was an indicator. Trying to figure it out, the matter was driven from his mind when Dakotah, then Kira, turned up for their lunch breaks, sat down with him and began talking with him.<br />
<br />
After lunch he headed back out on the floor and found himself sent up front to work customer service with Dakotah. It was then the next strange thing happened and, at first, he wasn&#39;t aware that it was happening as the same dream-like state he had experienced previously slipped over him. Ringing up customers with Dakotah, he aware after some time that there was a real cute looking guy standing a couple steps away, appearing nervous about something as he continued to peer about, then back at the customer service counter.<br />
<br />
Troubled by this, Edgar waited until he had finished helping the current customer and there was a lull before getting Dakotah&#39;s attention. When he had it, he made a slight gesture and whispered, &quot;Doesn&#39;t he look suspicious? You think we should do something about him?&quot;<br />
<br />
A slight smile played across the woman&#39;s face and she quietly answered, &quot;I noticed him some time ago. He&#39;s checking you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taken aback by this, Edgar had a moment to wonder why a guy would bother checking him out before he remembered what he&#39;d done with the Amulet of Zulo. Suddenly feeling self-conscious about how he looked, he flushed and looked down. Seeing that his chest looked more pronounced, he shifted nervously and asked, &quot;What should I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Dakotah could say anything, the man approached and as he cleared his thought, and shifted in place, he said, &quot;Uh, hi,&quot; stopped, blurted out, &quot;I&#39;m Ted,&quot; stopped again and clearly feeling as nervous as Edgar felt, he smiled and said, &quot;What I mean to say is, uh, hi, I&#39;m Ted. Well, I, uh, have never done this before. Well, what I mean is, well, I tried once or twice, in high school, and well. You know. Um, what I mean to say, is, uh, your really pretty. And what I was wondering if, been trying to ask you for something, if, well, would you like to join me for coffee? Or dinner? Or something? Sometime?,” then hastily added, “I mean, that is, if you wouldn&#39;t, that&#39;s cool, and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling like he was blushing, finding how nervous the man was made him even more cute looking, Edgar could see that guy was about nineteen or twenty. Lost for words, liking that the man thought him pretty, the dream-like state getting heavier, he found, before he could stop himself, he blurted, &quot;I&#39;m Roni,&quot; and lapsing into a shy silence, he continued to stare at the guy, shifting in place, before Dakotah intervened with, &quot;What my tongue-tied friend is trying to say is that she would love to get dinner with you sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everything seemed to leap forward quite suddenly and before Edgar could grasp what had happened, he found himself agreeing to a date with Ted, who said, in his nervous way, &quot;I can pick you up after work,&quot; and as they ironed out the details, including where, a nice, casual place that served Italian, Edgar found himself slipping more and more into the dream-like state until he couldn&#39;t tell if he was awake or asleep.</p>
