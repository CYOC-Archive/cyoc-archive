<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You sigh. &quot;Alright, I guess I'll play along. It will give me something to do besides sitting around waiting for wishes. So, who wants to explain the... Oh, never mind.&quot; You had picked up a book and suddenly you knew everything in it. You picked up another and it was the same. With a bit of a grin you brush your fingers down a stack of books and feel the knowledge within glide into your mind. After a few minutes of collecting you decide on what you want to be. &quot;I have decided to play a Drow sorcerer that specializes in shape shifting. Would this do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of the young men roll their eyes but they agree, not wanting to antagonize you into corrupting their wish. They collect themselves for the transfer and you weave your hands in the air for show. The magic swirls about the room and slowly the small dorm room dissolves away into an open field. Alvin along with it. Everyone else panics at first but are both startled and relieved when they can feel his presence. Then the magic begins to work on them. Their clothes fall to ashes, revealing their naked bodies. This is more for your own enjoyment then theirs, even if only a few of them are pleasant to look at currently. You worked on their individual changes separately, so you could watch without missing anything.<br />
<br />
Rick was first as he grew a few inches. His body received an all over tan and muscles started sprouting everywhere. Fat melted off and most of his body hair went with it, leaving a hunk of a man with a body built for war. The last thing to change was his equipment. You having plans to shag everyone in the party at least once decided to give everyone generous endowments, racially speaking of course. Rick found himself with plump golf balls and a long thick snake of at least 6 inches soft. With a quick thought it grew out hard, an enticing 9 inches erect. Pleased with your work you reluctantly clothed him. A heavy suit of armor covered him from head to toe, mimicking the defined muscle underneath. A shining broadsword appeared on his side and a shield of oak and steel grew out of his back.<br />
<br />
The dark skinned man was next. His shirt changed was the opposite of Ricks, as he suddenly lost a whole yard of height. His skull stretched out backwards giving it a pulled look, as his ears took on the slightest of points. His thin frame shifted to one, while not thick with muscle, which was used more often than a general college geeks. Light, lithe muscles stretched over his skeleton and nearly hairless body. The two and a half foot man suddenly looked down to his groin, which from his point of view had filled out to the equivalent of Ricks if not large, when in actuality it was less than a third of the size. A good size to him, not so to a human. The Halfling then found himself in flowing robes, adorned by glowing holy symbols. He beamed at the rest of the party with a hobbits grin of mischief.<br />
<br />
Emo boy shuddered as he too lost some height, not as much as the Halfling, yet enough to be noticeable. Maybe six inches shorter he watched as his skeletal frame filled out with firm, even flesh. His skin not gaining any color, still rather pale, but not instead of pasty it seemed to glow. The ears on his head stretched out to elegant points. His dark hair flowed and became wavy, the locks seeming to be the dawn overtaking the night as they turned from black to golden blonde. His eyes became bright and almond shaped, his lips fuller and seemed to glisten as if by magic. He shrieked in a feminine voice as his manhood pulled into itself, becoming a petite vagina. Upon his chest his breast swelled, became smooth, and grew to the size of grapefruit. He couldn't help but feel them as silken veils curled around him. His, or rather her, entire outfit was made of seven different colored veils that covered only what needed to be, and left the rest to tantalize the viewer.<br />
<br />
It was Blondie’s turn next, who groaned as he grew several inches to be just under seven feet. Part of this was due to his feet shifting into digigrade feline paws. His already adequate muscles increased to a hard runner's build. He watched his fingernails become short but sharp claws. His eyes squinted as his face pushed into a more feline shape. Still human but with the slightest hint of a muscle. His ears migrated to a more northern position on his head and stretched into more triangular shapes. A shudder ran down his spine as it lengthened into a four foot naked tail. He looked over himself confused at his own nakedness but his gaze was drawn to his groin. He felt himself become erect, yet it kept growing. Becoming a proud ten inches of meat. Something of a sheath formed at its base, which would keep it safely tucked away while soft yet still allow it to move around like a human's when hard. The only other traits about it that looked feline were a slight point in the glans and small sensitive nubs below the head. You had heard once that cats had barbs cocks and had no desire to subjugate any here to that, but an interesting texture might be fun. Next his balls swelled out to the size of kiwis. Completing the look. Blondie now resembled a tall standing, naked cat person. He looked at you quizzically before you decided to end the joke and let his fur grow in. The hair on his head exploded in length, becoming nearly a foot long and a deep umber color. Sideburns stretched down his jaw giving him the look of a half mane. From there soft, short golden fur flowed down his body. Upon his sheath and balls it was softer still, almost a down, and at the tip of his tail a tuft of courser fur the same color as his hair. He smiled and ran his hand along the new appendage and light blue cloth wrapped around his new body. Appearing as nothing more than loose tattered pants and a sleeveless shirt secured with white gauze at the waist and ankles, he felt safer in it then he had in football gear. Upon his hands gloves formed with metal claws imbedded and more gauze wrapped around the part of his tail just below the tuft. His arousal showed through his pants proving nothing had formed underneath. This made him blush and his ears to flatten in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
You had chosen Dan to be last as a joke, and you were pleased to see his meat ram rod erect, gently curved upwards. The magic took him and his upper torso gained handsome definition. His thighs and calf muscles becoming firm while the bones in his lower legs shortened. His feet stretched out while his toes merged and formed smooth cloven hooves. His already shoulder length hair grew out to perhaps short a penny short of three feet of soft brown waves. He stroked it with awe as thick ram horns curled back from his temples, following the curve of his skull instead of spiraling. The young man’s ears stretched out into floppy goat ears, the tops lined with a short brown fur. From his ankles up to mid thigh his legs sprouted shaggy goat fur and above his now firm arse a cute goat tail grew. He grinned with a face that had a slightly wider nose and puffy upper lip, giving him an almost goatish look as his rod swelled from its modest six inches to a throbbing twelve that any satyr could be proud of. It also gained a sheath, though calling it a pseudo sheath would be better as the dick would never fully enter it. It was more to keep it from flopping around when running. Soft brown fur started on this fold of flesh and worked its way down to the balls, which cause Dan's eyes to bug out and make him shoot a little pre as they swelled to the size of lemons. He could feel the lust building within him as a pouch suspended from a shoulder strap appeared on his side. Strapped to it was a regal set of Pan Pipes that seemed to beg to be played, as well as a blue glass bottle where a thick liquid could just be seen. On his ears glimmering bands found their way as well as on his horns. On his wrists were simple stamped leather bracers. The new satyr looked himself over, looked at the others and laughed joyously.<br />
<br />
You chuckled as they looked themselves over, admiring each other's new forms. You raised your hands for their attention and began your own change. Yours would be simple, as there wasn't much to change. More than Ricks, but less than the dark skinned Halfling. Your muscle and frame shrunk to more Elvan proportions, and your skin tone going from a deep purple to a dark purple, nearly black. Your ears already pointed simply stretched a bit, and shoulder length straight white hair grew from your previously bald scalp. The biggest change came next as the smoke that had made up your lower body materialized into a pair of lithe legs. You now stood just under five feet, Drow being short even for elves, but you made up for it with your almost comically large cock and balls. A firm seven inches erect with balls to match, it mirrored your pent up lust as it almost drooled. You decide to keep with the genie theme and made an outfit like any proper djinn would wear. A tight fitting vest that revealed the nipples and pants that were more a skimpy thong with nigh invisible silk hanging down the legs to silver cuffs around the ankles made up the most of it. Identical bands appeared on your wrist. That was the extent of your outfit, as you didn't plan on keeping it on long.<br />
<br />
Everyone, including you, felt the next part of the spell take place, as the minds of the players were pushed aside by the mind of the characters. The Catfolk looked like he wasn't sure what was going on, the fighter looked questiongly at his party members, the elf cast a seductive gaze at you, and the Halfling seemed to be planning on how best to remove her veils and the satyr... Well the look of the satyr actually didn't change much. He still had a look of unbridled lust about him. In your head knowledge of how to bend reality around your every whim was replaced with how to weave the fabric of reality to your will. Spells of change filled your mind and ways to use them. Mostly erotic ways and you contemplated which of your party members to seduce first.</p>
