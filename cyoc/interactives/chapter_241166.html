<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A smart car proves its mettle and worth by being smart. That was what they were made for after all. When Jeff was transformed and had his brain set up to two processing powers, one on his phone-cum-brain and another being additional hardware the Chevrolet Malibu came pre-equipped with, Jeff was thinking at lightspeed.<br />
<br />
He surmised he needed to play along since this was a gift to his younger twin brother after all, seeing him happy made him much more content to chauffeur him along this week. Be his guardian angel so to say. However, some concerns surfaced in the multi-core processors lining his cognitive cortex.<br />
<br />
Concerns as he had essentially given up all control and guarantee that he could ever become human again, and second, gave up all autonomy to Ben. Jeff became aware that a Bluetooth Transfer had occurred between his phone and Ben&#39;s, as every application has its paper trail. Once suspicion set in, Jeff initiated a few changes in himself.<br />
<br />
1. The car key no longer forces him to shift to car form and drive to where Ben is. Jeff can accept the prompt mentally.<br />
<br />
2. Jeff can transform between forms at will, reverting and subsuming anything to make sure no complications occur, like a leftover condom.<br />
<br />
3. There is no sleep mode incurred by shutting off his engine. He had multiple cores capable of half-sleeping part of his systems while another part of him remained aware.<br />
<br />
4. Protective subroutines installed themselves as part of his make, firewalls being set up from viruses and Jeff ensured total control and awareness of his systems at all times.<br />
<br />
In that moment he had noted to Ben that he couldn&#39;t talk without the radio set to 0.0, and his mind split into multiple threads of afterthought about how stupid and dumb he had been to agree with Ben. Countless memories showed that Ben had a mean streak when he got what he wanted, though Jeff had always shrugged it off. <br />
<br />
That was fair, after all. Jeff was kinder than he thought, and Ben was meaner than he thought.<br />
<br />
When his blockchain memory was restored in that 2 minutes of time loss, he knew he had made the right decision. Bill the valet had accessed his systems and transferred over many of the things he kept secured. Of course, he let it happen in the first place to collect actual paper trails.<br />
<br />
And when they were talking of altering reality? <br />
<br />
Jeff had made pre-emptive changes of his own while keeping a copy of himself to play along and play dumb with Ben. Perks of having multi-core super-threaded processors am I right?<br />
<br />
5. Jeff (Main User 1) remains aware of any reality changes.<br />
6. Blockchain 2 keeps Jeff&#39;s memories as a backup bank. and it remains aware of retroactive changes.<br />
7. Decoy Jeff AI is to remain the only one to interact with Ben and anyone else.<br />
8. Chronivac integrated into the system cannot be removed and is a hidden program.<br />
<br />
The last change he subtly made sure it slips the mind of anyone aware of his Chronivac to forget about it.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Do you have like a search function for specific targets?&quot;</i> Jeff&#39;s smart audio recording devices overheard what Jane asked. It had been a mere night and Ben was already spilling the beans on the best gift he could give to him? What a stupid twin he had!<br />
<br />
<i>Calm down Jeff. She&#39;s been abused and simply wants a way out of her strict parents and gold-digger boyfriends.</i><br />
<br />
He waited with bated breath as they talked, going as far as to delete her parents in an accident instead of making them better people. Is she a psychopath?? And all those people that hurt her deleted out of existence? Does she not know the ripple effects?<br />
<br />
Jeff had searched them and saved their data to his massive databanks, ready to rebound them back to reality except for her parents. He needed to play his cards right after all.<br />
<br />
When the reality shift swept over his mind, he was so fucking grateful he set up countermeasures. The AI Jeff was completely overwritten, having been truly an AI programmed to be part of the design that Ben had heralded forward and having finding no connections to his parents.<br />
<br />
Jeff, however, was still here. He set the rebound back with specific alterations 24 hours from now. It was best to let her think she won. He fucking had to, there was no way he was going to lay down and accept being written out of life itself.<br />
<br />
By the time Ben and Jane were giddily hopping back to the Chevrolet Malibu, Jeff was done with his preparations. The car key &quot;woke&quot; him up to grogginess, well, one-half of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I need several things done tomorrow, babe,&quot; Jane told Ben with finality, shuffling into his seat with the joy of a 10-year-old. &quot;But we need to get the night celebrated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben entered the car and pressed the button to start the engines, the roaring quickly subdued by his design to soften it to a rumbling purr. Ben slid his hands onto her thighs. &quot;What are we doing tonight baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shot him a knowing smile, pure unadulterated happiness at being free. &quot;We fuck. Then we get married. I wanna go through all the nitty-gritty of it all personally as we go forwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben smirked and then tapped on the screen to call up his AI. &quot;Jeffy, get us to Thomas Mansions.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Yes sir.&quot;</i> The AI replied smoothly, immediately setting course to their honeymoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have some other plans. I have so much power at the tip of my hands now I can just rule the world if I want to.&quot; Ben grinned and pressed the gas, skidding the ground and zooming away. With the press of a button, he engaged auto-pilot at the current speed. <br />
<br />
Fast.<br />
<br />
Very fucking fast.<br />
<br />
Disregarding the lives of everyone else on the midnight roads, the Chevrolet roared through the highways and reached its destination within half an hour. The ebony gates of the mansion were automatically opened when she pressed the key kept in her satchel. As the metal gates creaked to the side, all three of them had set foot on their new estate.<br />
<br />
Jeff with his tires of course. He had made sure to keep them safe all the way here.<br />
<br />
The smooth marbled road underneath his tires was carved with grooves to retain friction, the ivory pillars holding the ebony fences lining up the courtyard as the typical rose gardens and white fountain in the middle sat before a huge red brick mansion lit up like a Christmas tree. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to our new home babe.&quot; Jane exited as she exhaled in her release, a pleasurable night coming in just a few moments. As the oaken wood doors to the mansion opened with an audible bang, maids and a rather muscular guard walked out to greet their mistress. They were with black and white maid uniforms fit for noble standards, prim and proper.<br />
<br />
Jeff whistled with how strong the guard was. He wore his uniform tight over his body, as if a certain someone wanted eye candy. The para-military gear he had on him suggested he was tasked with maintaining the other guards, if his badge was of any indicator.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress, you&#39;re back from your date, I assume?&quot; The shiny and bald caucasian man asked, looking over the car&#39;s roof to assess the other rich kid from behind his shades. &quot;May I know who he is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane looked back to Ben and beckoned him over. It was clear that the man intimidated him by the fact that he didn&#39;t walk forward earlier. &quot;He&#39;s my new boyfriend, Ben!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben had memories of his new life and his old after all, his new life might have dealt with these kinds of personnel but his old self clearly didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben Bezos, sir. Multibillionaire and genius in the smart cars and AI development.&quot; Ben introduced himself, his new memories slotting in any inconsistencies with the truth. &quot;I&#39;m going to marry her.&quot;<br />
<br />
He could see the eyebrow quirk. &quot;Huh, wouldn&#39;t be the first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was glad he had the foresight to delay the rebound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on in then, it&#39;s midnight.&quot; The guard said as Jane walked past him first, making sure to keep his eyes on the new guy. Safety was his priority after all. &quot;It would be bad manners not to let you stay for the night.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ben walked towards Jane, and as he passed by the guard he had a brilliant idea. Looking back at his car sitting in the driveway like that, he gave the car keys to the guard. &quot;Can you get the car parked in a garage or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
The guard didn&#39;t budge, not about to entertain a request not his own job. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get to it Draven. Wouldn&#39;t want my boyfriend&#39;s car to get broken in at night.&quot; Jane spoke up at the doors to the mansion, arms crossed and glaring.<br />
<br />
Draven stared at Ben, then the keys, and grabbed it with no fanfare. It wouldn&#39;t take long anyway, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t be possible with the security we have, but sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he sat in the car, he had to admit it was comfy. As he drove to the garage and waited for its doors to open, he wondered if the long night let him take a few minutes to nap in this comfy car.<br />
<br />
They were clearly going to fuck anyway.</p>
