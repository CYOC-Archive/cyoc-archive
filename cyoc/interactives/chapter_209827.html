<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I am no longer a fox, yet, I still am,&quot; she told herself as she explored the Chronivac programme and mulled over what exactly she now was and what she should do.<br />
<br />
After a some time, with no idea what to considered herself, she decided on a couple things to do. The first was that she didn&#39;t want to go back to what she was before. As if something had awakened in her with her new intelligence and sentience, she found the prospect of returning to being a dumb beast, to be stripped of what she saw as a gift, terrifying. She had no idea what others of her former kind would think of her, and after some thought on the matter, decided she didn&#39;t care. This bringing her to the notion of going to live what she now understood were called humans, she found herself doubting on whether they&#39;d accept her, try to experiment on her to see what made her different, or just kill her.<br />
<br />
This line of thought brought out old fears from when she&#39;d been a witless animal existing on the basic level. Frightened by what humans might do, she found herself also worried about the two that were still around. Sniffing the air, her ears swivelling as she tracked the one she knew was still in what she now understood was called a house, and after a moment, decided she needed to do something about them to afford her some privacy.<br />
<br />
With a glance at the laptop, she felt she had her answer to that problem. Pulling up the two other profiles active, she stared at them for a moment, trying to decide which one was in the house with her. Going by what she smelled, saw and read on the screen, she minimised the one marked &quot;Penny&quot; and set to work making sure the other wouldn&#39;t bother her by altering them, an idea coming her of what to do about them later as she thought to herself, &quot;This is but a temporary solution,&quot; before she clicked on the icon to accept all changes and glanced in the direction she knew the other was located.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, Lisa was unable to take her eyes off the image she saw reflected in the mirror. Tall, near eight feet, her appearance was now that of a muscular man. Flexing, making her pecs ripple, she shifted in place and listened as her hooves clopped against the tile floor. Turning to examine her tail, then to studied what she considered now her impressive package as it hung loosely from her prepuce, she flexed her muscles and thought, “Sexy. Look, great. Can have an filly I want, as they&#39;ll coming galloping to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unaware of how simplistic, animalistic her mind was becoming, she clenched her now impressive hands into fists and then relaxed them. Running her strong fingers up and down her arms, which were the same length as her legs, she thought about how easy, comfortable, it&#39;d be to drop to all fours. Shaking her head, which caused her mane to switch back and forth, she tried to tell herself she went about on two legs, but found it hard to believe, much as she found it difficult to accept she wore clothes. Starting to grow worried something was wrong with her most current change, but unable to figure out what, she posed a bit longer before she thought, &quot;Must use game to fix what’s off,” but found it hard to take her eyes off the reflection she saw, and felt would fetch her any filly or mare she wanted.<br />
<br />
When the tingle sensation first appeared, she didn&#39;t pay any attention. Too busy with her posturing, and trying to get herself to go back to the dining room, it didn&#39;t seem important until she noticed her ears. Finally noticing and watching as they grew longer and longer, Lisa thought, &quot;What the hell,&quot; before the weird sensation erupted all over her body and she was unable to stop herself as she dropped to all fours with an audible crack that turned her into a four legged being.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she tried to cry out, but the articulation was lost before it was finished and watching as she started to shrink, she began to twitch her nose, unable to stop herself from doing so, much the same way she hadn&#39;t been able to stop herself from posing like a randy stallion.<br />
<br />
Fur, white in colour, grew in patches all over her body and Lisa began to panic, not so much because of what was happening to her, but due to that she could actually feel her mind being reduced back to something simpler, animal like. Her transformation only taking mere minutes, having only the merest of discomfort, and her large horse equipment the last to change into that which was normal for a rabbit to have, the rodent she&#39;d become flattened itself tight to the floor as it smelled a predator nearby and started to look wildly about for a place to go to ground.<br />
<br />
Outside the bathroom door, the vixen sniffed the air. Understanding what was happening inside, she saw no reason to try and go in. Figuring she&#39;d deal with them later, she turned and returned to the dining room. Leaping up onto the table, she saved and closed both Penny and Lisa&#39;s profile and brought her&#39;s to the foreground. Studying it, still feeling too exposed where she was, the vixen thought about what she wanted to change, and what change she should do to herself. Believing the first thing she should do was find some place more secluded, she worked out she wanted to take the laptop with, but couldn&#39;t in her current state. Using her front paws that were also now fingers, she typed out the commands to give her the ability to walk on two legs with as much ease as she did so on four. Wanting to remain a quadruped, but seeing the importance of being bipedal, she double checked her instructions and tapped the icon to confirm.<br />
<br />
Warmth spread up and down her back, then up into her head and shoulders, as well as down into her hips and legs. Her body making a series of cracking sounds, she wasn&#39;t able to stop herself as she stretched, extending and shaking one leg after another. Finding it wasn&#39;t as discomforting as when her front paws had changed, or her brain had evolved, which she decided had been the worse, she waited until the sensation left before she jumped back down from the table.<br />
<br />
Carefully pulling herself up using the tipped over chair, she held the wood legs tight as she wavered in place and tried to keep herself from pitching over. When she was sure she&#39;d gotten her balance, finding her tail helped a lot, she took a couple tentative steps. Dropping back to all fours, she barked in frustration and annoyance, which was heard by the rabbit and caused him to leap into the tub in an effort to find some place to hide, and making herself get back up on two legs, she took a moment to acquaint herself to her bipedal stance. Finding it wasn&#39;t easy, yet understanding it would be the more she did it, the vixen worked her way back and forth across the room before she leapt back up onto the table. Looking at the computer, she furrowed her brow as she worked out how she was to get it down off the table and where it was she could take it for some privacy.<br />
<br />
Nimble in her movement, she jumped off the table, and after a bit of thought, she tried to right the chair. Finding it was too heavy, she glanced at the other one, climbed up on it, and reached for the computer as she stood on two legs. Working the computer closer, stopping every so often to take a breather, she flinched when she lost her grip on it and the machine dropped to the chair and then to the floor. Dropping down next to it, she inspected it, and seeing it was all right, she started to drag it through the house, searching for a quiet place to work. Finding eventually a part way open closet in the kitchen area, the vixen gave it some thought, opened the door and peered in. Deciding it would do, she pulled the laptop inside, partially closed the door and sitting down under a shelf, she went back to working with her profile.<br />
<br />
Various options became available to her as she explored the Chronivac. Deciding after clicking on a handful of things that what she wanted to do was increase her knowledge, she started pulling open options of what she should know. Stopping when found a slider that informed her that her current level of knowledge was somewhere between that of pre-schooler and that of sixth grader, she tapped her thumb on the key board as she sorted out what it was telling her. Readjusting the slider to that of a post-tertiary education, she returned to what she’d been doing before. Increasing her survival skills, she gave herself an intermediate level in architecture before she upped her math and reading skills to also a post tertiary education. Opening more boxes, pulling down more drop-down items, she went slow through the various lists, clicking on stuff she believed was important, things she guessed might be useful, and bit of knowledge she found interesting. Finishing as more of her plan fleshed itself out, she smiled as she clicked the command to accept and initiate the changes, and immediately squeezed her eyes shut as the pressure inside her head returned as a complete education, amongst other skills and bits of knowledge, was dumped into her mind, and she had her first understand that if she wasn&#39;t a fox, the closest thing she might be able to considered herself was a Kitsune.</p>
