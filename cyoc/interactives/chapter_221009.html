<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg and Kim stood there, holding each other tightly, trying to come to terms with their predicament. Kim&#39;s words echoed in Greg&#39;s mind—this could still be a special and memorable weekend. He took a deep breath and looked at Kim, determination filling his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Greg said, his voice filled with newfound resolve. &quot;We&#39;ll make the best of this. We won&#39;t let this ruin our anniversary weekend. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s some way we can swap back without Marvin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His magic cabinets are backstage,&quot; Kim said. &quot;Let&#39;s go take a closer look.&quot;<br />
<br />
They returned to the backstage area and started looking at Marvin&#39;s pink and blue cabinets.  Greg opened up the blue cabinet and started feeling for hidden doors or anything unusual.  Kim pulled the bottom of the pink cabinet away and looked under the top half to try to figure out where her legs went.  She was sure that Marvin couldn&#39;t have actually removed their legs from their bodies because she could still feel her legs the entire time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Find anything?&quot; asked Greg.  He wasn&#39;t having much luck, but hoped Kim might have discovered something useful.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  These seem like normal boxes with a metal support frame and office chair wheels on the bottom.&quot;  Kim was disappointed.  She had hoped for some kind of clue as to what had actually happened to them.  She felt if she understood how the trick was actually done, maybe they could reverse it.<br />
<br />
Greg&#39;s voice echoed Kim&#39;s disappointment.  &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t see any hidden panels or secret compartments.&quot;  He stood up and opened up the blue cabinet.  &quot;Try getting in.  I&#39;ll see if I can separate your legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim was reluctant to let Greg try.  &quot;Are you sure you know what you&#39;re doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; replied Greg.  He didn&#39;t even try to hide it.  &quot;If you feel any pain, let me know and I&#39;ll stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim thought for a moment and then exhaled.  &quot;Okay.&quot;  She climbed into the blue box and Greg closed the doors as he had seen Marvin do.<br />
<br />
Greg noticed there were small latches to keep the door securely shut and fastened the latches.  He looked up at Kim.  &quot;You okay in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s face was visible through the top of the cabinet.  &quot;Yeah.  I think next he put the blades in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg looked around and didn&#39;t see any blades.  He walked over to Marvin&#39;s prop table and found four square metal blades leaning up against the table leg.  &quot;Found them!&quot;  He returned with two and placed one on the floor by the cabinet.  After locating a slot in the center of the cabinet, he slowly slid the first blade into place.<br />
<br />
As Greg got the blade a couple inches in, Kim spoke up.  &quot;Stop!  I can feel that.  I didn&#39;t feel anything when he did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg pulled the blade out.  He looked closer at the slots in the center.  &quot;I&#39;m going to try again.&quot;  He tried putting the blade in the lower part of the center slot, but Kim felt the blade again.  &quot;Okay, maybe it&#39;s the other blade?&quot;  He swapped blades and tried again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, this isn&#39;t working,&quot; Kim confessed.  &quot;He must have done something before he put the blades in that made it so we wouldn&#39;t feel it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Giving up, Greg unlatched the cabinet and opened it to release Kim.  &quot;Damn.  I don&#39;t suppose it ever would have been that simple for us, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t beat yourself up,&quot; Kim said as she consoled Greg, her love for her husband shining through her eyes.  &quot;This isn&#39;t your fault.  Even if you had separated my legs, then what?  You can&#39;t get in the other box and separate your own legs and then swap them.  We&#39;re going to need someone else&#39;s help no matter what we do.  We either need to track down Marvin or we need to find someone else to help us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg sighed and nodded.  &quot;You&#39;re right.  You&#39;re right.  So, what do we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim thought for a second.  &quot;Let&#39;s head to the front desk.  They should have Marvin&#39;s contact info.  We can call him and get him to come back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great idea!&quot;  Greg took the blades and put them back where he found them before they left through the theater and headed toward the main lobby.<br />
<br />
They approached the front desk where the receptionist listened attentively as they explained their situation—the accidental body swap caused by Marvin&#39;s magic trick and their desperate desire to reverse it. She raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised by their story.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard of some strange things happening in this hotel, but this takes the cake,&quot; the receptionist said with a chuckle. &quot;Unfortunately, I cannot give out Marvin the Magnificent&#39;s contact information, but I&#39;d be happy to reach out to him on your behalf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg and Kim both nodded their heads.  &quot;Absolutely,&quot; added Greg.  &quot;Whatever it takes!&quot;<br />
<br />
She picked up the phone and made a call, speaking in hushed tones. After a brief conversation, she hung up and turned back to Greg and Kim. &quot;I called the number we have on file for Marvin and was able to talk to someone there who informed me that Marvin is scheduled to be out of town this weekend and won&#39;t be back until Monday. They were unable to share where he is going, but he apparently had to catch a flight and that was the reason for his sudden departure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg looked at Kim with a renewed glimmer of hope. &quot;So he&#39;s at the airport?  If we hurry, maybe we can catch him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim put her hand on Greg&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;He&#39;s got at least a 15 minute head start by now. Even if we knew exactly where he was at the airport, we probably still wouldn&#39;t catch him before he got past the security checkpoint and we can&#39;t go past there without a ticket.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we have to try,&quot; Greg insisted.  &quot;Are you suggesting we stay like this until he&#39;s back on Monday?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim shrugged.  &quot;I mean, is it really so bad?&quot;  She looked at the receptionist who was pretending to be busy, but clearly still listening in.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked up.  &quot;Huh?  You&#39;re asking me?&quot;  She looked at Kim for confirmation and noticed Greg was also looking at her.  &quot;Well, uh, I suppose you two have a unique opportunity to literally walk in each other&#39;s shoes for a weekend. Why not have a little fun...if you know what I mean?&quot;  She winked.<br />
<br />
Greg looked horrified, but Kim laughed a little.  &quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s make the best of it.  Okay, honey?&quot;<br />
<br />
Letting out a deep sigh, Greg agreed.  <i>&quot;Fine!&quot;</i>  He looked at the receptionist.  &quot;And you&#39;re sure there&#39;s no way to get Marvin back here and we couldn&#39;t possibly catch him at the airport?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, sir.  I&#39;m sorry, sir.&quot;  The receptionist poked at her keyboard.  &quot;However, I&#39;ll tell you what I&#39;ll do...  I&#39;m going to have a champagne and cheese platter sent up to your room.  On the house.  Consider it our apology for this temporary inconvenience and our gift to wish you a happy anniversary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim flashed a big smile.  &quot;Oh, thank you so much!  That&#39;s so nice!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that&#39;s great, thank you.&quot;  Greg&#39;s mood was already starting to improve.  He leaned in toward the receptionist.  &quot;Although, can you <i>please</i> promise me that you won&#39;t tell anyone about our, uh, &#39;situation&#39;? We&#39;d rather not attract unwanted attention like some kind of sideshow freaks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, absolutely, sir!&quot; she agreed.  &quot;It&#39;s just our secret.  And if there&#39;s anything else you need, just ask for Beth.  I&#39;ll be working afternoons and evenings all weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg smiled.  &quot;Thank you, Beth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Although,&quot; Beth added, &quot;if you don&#39;t want to attract attention, you may want to change out of the skirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim laughed as Greg looked down at his legs.  &quot;Oh, right.  Okay, we&#39;re going to go change.  Thanks!&quot;  Greg took Kim&#39;s hand and walked her to the elevator.<br />
<br />
Back in their room, they sat on the bed.  &quot;So,&quot; Kim said, breaking the silence.  &quot;I&#39;ll show you mine if you show me yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg laughed.  &quot;I suppose it&#39;s more like &#39;I&#39;ll show you yours if you show me mine&#39;?&quot;  He began unbuckling the straps on his shoes.<br />
<br />
Kim stood up and headed to the bathroom.  &quot;I never did get to pee when we were up here before.&quot;  Before she entered, she turned and looked at Greg.  &quot;Anything I should know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sliding his feet out of the shoes, he stood up and walked to Kim.  &quot;Why don&#39;t I come in and help.  I&#39;ve got decades of experience with that equipment and it&#39;s probably easier to show you than try to explain it.&quot;<br />
<br />
They walked into the bathroom and Kim pulled her pants and underwear down.  Her penis hung out.  Greg walked up behind her and peeked over her shoulder while guiding her right hand with his own.  He had her take hold of her penis and aim it down toward the toilet bowl.  &quot;So, basically, aim it and let the pee flow.&quot;  They waited and Kim managed to release her bladder just before it got even more awkward than it already was.  Once the flow stopped, Greg added, &quot;Okay, now jiggle it a little to get any drops off and you&#39;re done!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim reached down, flushed the toilet, and pulled her underwear up and then her pants.  &quot;That was fun!  But how do you keep it from splashing all over?&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg chuckled.  &quot;Actually, you can&#39;t.  Some toilets are super low and there&#39;s a lot of splashback on those.  Honestly, if I&#39;m at home in our own clean bathroom, I usually just sit and pee so it&#39;s not splashing up on the toilet, wall, and floor.  Lots of guys would never admit to sitting to pee though.  If you want to try that next time, I&#39;d be happy to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim smiled.  &quot;Thanks.  I think we can stop talking about pee now...unless you have to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg cocked his head to the side.  &quot;No, I think I&#39;m good for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
They walked out of the bathroom and Kim looked at her suitcase.  &quot;So what are we going to do for clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg looked back at Kim.  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wear my own shoes anymore and this new waist is too big for some of of the skirts and pants I brought.&quot;  Kim looked in her bag.  &quot;I don&#39;t think those panties will fit me either.&quot;  She pulled out a set of lingerie.  &quot;I was planning to surprise you with this.  I suppose I can still wear the top.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg complimented her choice.  &quot;Oh, that would have been nice.  Well, I suppose you&#39;re welcome to any of the pants, socks, and underwear that I brought.  I&#39;ve got those loafers and I also packed a pair of sneakers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks! You&#39;re welcome to anything in my bag too,&quot; Kim offered.<br />
<br />
Greg started taking clothes out of his suitcase.  &quot;No, that&#39;s okay.  My pants should fit and although my shoes might be a little big, I can still wear them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Kim asked.  &quot;Your butt is larger and your waist is smaller.  Your pants might not fit you anymore.&quot;  Kim removed her pants and handed them to Greg.  &quot;Here.  Try these on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg sat on the foot of the bed and put his legs into each pant leg.  With his feet through the bottom, he stood up and tried pulling the pants up.  After a little struggle, he managed to get them up over his butt and buttoned the top around his thinner waist.  However, as he tried to zip up the fly, he realized it was impossible.  His pants were already stretched out as far as they would go and it wasn&#39;t possible for him to zip it up.  He looked at Kim, defeated.  &quot;I&#39;ll admit it.  You were right.  These don&#39;t fit anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I didn&#39;t think that was going to work.  You&#39;re in luck though.  I did pack some nice pants and a pair of jeans.  I also have some nice shorts.  If you want a dress, I did bring two of my favorites.&quot;  Kim pulled two dresses out of the closet on hangers and held them up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m only you from the waist down.  I won&#39;t need to be wearing any dresses,&quot; Greg insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m only kidding.&quot;  Kim returned the dresses to the closet and sat on the bed.  She pulled her underwear down and looked at her penis.  &quot;So, uh, I figure while I have this...  I mean, would you mind if...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you asking to put that thing in me?&quot; Greg asked incredulously.  &quot;I might have your vagina for the moment, but I&#39;m not gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim rolled her eyes.  &quot;No, that&#39;s not what I was asking.  I was wondering if it might be okay for me to...  Can I try masturbating?&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg laughed.  &quot;Oh!  <i>OH!</i>  Yeah, by all means!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim took off all her clothes and laid back on the bed with her head on the pillow.  &quot;I don&#39;t mind if you watch.  I suppose it <i>is</i> yours.  Anything I should know?  Did you want to show me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; replied Greg with a smile, &quot;I think you&#39;ll be fine figuring this one out on your own.  In fact, I&#39;m kind of curious myself.  I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d mind if I tried out my new equipment too, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m surprised you waited this long!  Please, go to town,&quot; Kim insisted.<br />
<br />
Greg stripped down and got into bed next to Kim.  He leaned over and kissed her as he started reaching down his body and slowly inserted his fingers into his new vagina.  Meanwhile, Kim had her right hand grasped firmly around her new penis and began massaging it slowly back and forth and exploring the new sensations she was feeling.  They both moaned occasionally as new sexual sensations overcame their bodies and new feelings began to be explored.<br />
<br />
Kim eventually started varying the speed at which she moved her hand up and down on the somewhat familiar shaft.  It wasn&#39;t long until a clear fluid started dripping out of the tip of her penis which was immediately followed by somewhat involuntary muscle spasms that ejected a thick white fluid.  Kim&#39;s hand immediately stopped and her entire body relaxed.  She let out a satisfied sigh.<br />
<br />
Greg looked over.  &quot;Not bad, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim breathed deeply and slowly.  &quot;Wow, that was so different than what I&#39;m used to.  It&#39;s like my entire mind and body became focused on this one goal.  Then it happened and it&#39;s like a light switch was flipped and I immediately felt satisfied and tired.&quot;  She looked over at Greg.  &quot;How&#39;s it going over there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels incredible,&quot; Greg confessed.  &quot;But...  Well, I&#39;ve always been on the other end and this is so weird.  I&#39;m trying to recreate what I&#39;ve tried with you, but it&#39;s not quite there yet...if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim smiled.  &quot;Yeah, I think I know what you mean.&quot;  She looked down at herself.  &quot;Let me clean myself up and I&#39;ll be with you in a minute.&quot;  She took a few tissues from the bedside table and wiped up the fluid pooled up on her stomach.  After disposing of them in the bathroom and cleaning herself up a bit, she returned to Greg.  &quot;Here, I&#39;ll show you a trick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim inserted two fingers into her former vagina and located a nub on the front side of what was now Greg&#39;s vagina.  Greg gasped with surprise and Kim smiled.  &quot;That&#39;s your G-spot,&quot; Kim told Greg.  &quot;Try feeling around that area.  It&#39;s only a few inches back on the front side.&quot;  She let him re-insert his fingers and figure out what it felt like while she moved closer and started kissing him.<br />
<br />
Moments later, Greg had his left arm around Kim and pulled her closer while arching his back and moaning.  &quot;Oh my god!  <i>YES!</i>  This is...  <i>Incredible!</i>  Oh!&quot;  Greg soon relaxed with a big smile on his face.  He looked up at Kim.  &quot;Wow, you&#39;re right.  It is so different than what I&#39;m used to!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim had a devious smile on her face.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you glad we didn&#39;t get Marvin to change us back yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Well, I <i>do</i> want to be back to normal, but that was definitely worth experiencing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember that spot once we&#39;re back to normal,&quot; Kim suggested.  &quot;I&#39;ll really appreciate it.  Now that you&#39;ve experienced that from the other side, I bet it&#39;s going to make you so much better at sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was I not great?&quot; Greg asked with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no,&quot; Kim reassured him.  &quot;You&#39;re great, but with your new experience, I&#39;m thinking you&#39;ll be incredible!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess experience really is the best teacher.&quot;  Greg laid back on the pillow and looked at the ceiling.  &quot;Now what?  I&#39;m too wired to go to bed.  The night is young.  What should we do?&quot;</p>
