<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As much as you would like to keep going with the masturbation, you decide you should get a better feel for your situation. Maybe get back to the good feelings later. First you decide to sit up at the edge of your bed, deciding standing up would be a bad idea from the first accidental attempt. You look down at yourself to really take your body in detail.<br />
<br />
First off, you were huge. &quot;Sitting up&quot; was being generous, as you felt barely lifted off the floor. Your torso seemed have the overall toned-woman look that was generally attractive, there was all sorts details that made your body in-human with clearer look now that the excitement was all over.<br />
<br />
Your arms and legs were in-humanly long. Sure your hands and feet were disproportionately large along with the claw-like, black nails, but you figured these were the real attributes to your size. It was some weird mix of being gangly-yet-toned. The rest of you...<br />
<br />
Your breasts are massive! Each one was torso-sized, which also meant they stuck half-way out to the sides of your body, as well as they did forward. Confirming, they also squished deliciously against each other and passive pleasure was gained from slight movements in looking. Your grey nipples and areolae were proportionate, but you wondered their specific-size. Remembering your newfound limbs, you hefted up your boobs to literally and metaphorically get a feel for them. Even with your current hand size, you could barely barely prevent all of the tit-flesh from spilling over, even in-between your fingers. You did enjoy the pleasure from the touch, and you even felt the nails scratching, but even that was a nice feeling. They didn&#39;t feel particularly heavy somehow, maybe it was due to your newfound strength? An idea inspired from the previously jiggling caused you to let your boobs to go into a free fall. They did truly jiggle in a memorizing manner yet somehow didn&#39;t phase your balance at all. Reminded you of the various Japanese animations and video games where the boobs sometimes came with their own sound effects.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, there was other parts of you that jiggled, namely your thighs and butt. You switched to kneeling position and rested her torso on the bed, sticking her butt into the air, seeing the cheeks in full glory while looking behind her. Realizing your lower legs were of more normal proportions, if toned-yet-gangly was normal, everything turned into a hourglass dream past the knees. The thighs were as previously described, thick-as-tree trunks and showing no sign of weakness, but still did seem to have enough fat for a delicious jiggle. Your ass was a delicious dump-truck, and your attempts at twerk were well-rewarded with the motions. You would love see how much better it would look in the right clothing. Then you realized something...<br />
<br />
You have a great view of your ass, but you&#39;re looking behind you. You have a great view, because your neck is stretched and twisted, and somehow you didn&#39;t notice this. No discomfort or anything. You did have a shocked reaction to this sudden revelation, and suddenly felt your head rubber-band back into a more proper position. Remembering events from the dream, maybe you had much more unnatural things going on with your new body, but you still decided to take things slowly before going wild. <br />
<br />
You remembered some other special things about your appearance. Your very much explored pale skin and somehow almost-floor length black hair, but your face is something you can&#39;t look at without a mirror. Switch from a kneeling to a crouch, you methodically moved around your room to the convenient sliding-closet mirror to get a better look of yourself. <br />
<br />
The face was as you remembered it on the dream woman. A tiny, perky nose, a small mouth with full, plump black lips, an oval shaped face, and big, slanted, pitch black eyes. It somehow was a mix of a the aforementioned Japanese porceline dolls yet organic. Careful touches here and there confirmed feeling and pliability, but if the rest of your body was in-human if womanly, your face definitely made your skin crawl. You realized without conscious control of your face, it could stay perfectly still in a neutral position, but with conscious effort you could smile, grimace, and other expressions, although you couldn&#39;t do much for your eyes. Your black hair was extremely long with a silky sheen, and like your boobs, somehow didn&#39;t get in the way. <br />
<br />
You realized other than a squeal and moaning earlier, you didn&#39;t really know how your new voice sounded like. Trying a simple &quot;Hello&quot;, nothing came out other than a growl. Getting kind of panicky, you tried more words and all that came out was growls, moans, and other noises of a truly feral creature... or woman. You could do facial expressions for emotion, but for some reason even silently mouthed sounds were beyond you. Was there more to this form then its physical look and possible supernatural abilities? Other then the body, you felt like you, but not sure why you weren&#39;t able talk. <br />
<br />
Calming yourself down, you decide on what you should do next to avoid a panic attack. You looked at your vagina, remember some details from earlier but deciding you should find out more information about your form before having any fun, especially since you weren&#39;t sure what to think about the amount of hair on it.<br />
<br />
Deciding that the computer chair was useless, you move it out of the way into a kneeling position as you carefully wake up the monitors from their sleeping modes and worked the best you can with your longer fingers and claw-like nails. You took note of your night-sight as you didn&#39;t notice you even had it until the light of the monitors contrasted with the rest of the room to remind you.<br />
<br />
After some searching and referencing, you seemed closest to the &quot;8 Foot Tall Lady&quot; japanese legend. The only consistent traits you could get was her height and trademark sunhat. Other more common features was long black hair, skin color, and being a sort of ghost, demon, or evil spirit. Everything else about her was inconsistent from story to story, whether powers, background, or habits, but one thing is that she prayed on children. Otherwise there seemed to be plenty interpretations of pale-skinned, long black haired women in Japanese media, but you&#39;re not sure how much of it applied to your own form. <br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t feel particularly dead or otherworldly, nor had any feelings other than was seems reasonable for your situation right now. Heck you even took the time to look at the sexier pictures of the 8 Foot Tall Lady in detail so your sex-drive is still intact. Decided you spent enough time researching, you decided what to do next...</p>
