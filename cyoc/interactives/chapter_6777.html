<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim had never been out to Little Bull’s before. He’d always meant to but never managed it. In Tim Danes reality the place never even existed, the land was park. As they entered there was a something, a shiver ran down Tim’s back. He stopped and looked around him- there was a thin red wall of light he’s just walked through. His magical knowledge identified a ward when he saw one, he would have stopped and tried to analyse it but Kelvin pushed him forward. Tim felt ok so he guessed it was not a dangerous one. <br />
<br />
Little Bull’s was anything but, the restaurant was a massive circular room with private booths round the outside, and big tables quite far from each other round the middle. In the centre was the masterpiece; a huge oak tree growing right up out of the wooden floor. Its upper branches where in a massive atrium. There was a clear space round it with a slightly raised floor, a good dancing spot. Tim gaped as Richard confirmed the bookings with the Greeter. However a playful punch from Kelvin snapped him back to reality.<br />
“Never been before huh?” he stage whispered to Tim.<br />
“Huh….what?” Tim said. Richards’s wife Ruby was shaking her head at him<br />
“Anyone would think you’d never seen a tree before” she said. <br />
“I was admiring the upper leaf configuration” Tim stammered. <br />
“Yeah right, and I’m the Easter Bunny” Richard chortled. <br />
<br />
The Greeter waved over a waiter. Tim noticed that though none of them would win Mr. Olympia all the waiters were quite well built, and male. Richard turned to the Greeter<br />
“Is Mr. Greenton in tonight?” he said.<br />
“Yes sir. He’s in the kitchen supervising the ladies” <br />
“Tell him to get his butt out of there and stop fondling the chefs. His brother wants to see him” The Greeter eyes went wide as took in Richards large form ”I’m sorry sir, I did not recognise you. Last time I saw you, you were at least 50lbs less mass. I’ll tell him right away. Chi, see these people to the head table.” With that the Greeter shuttled off leaving a bemused waiter, who gestured with a good sized shirt covered arm<br />
“This way please” he said in a slight oriental accent. The party followed Chi through the restaurant to the largest table, it was placed prominently and the high elaborately carved wooden chairs marked it out as special. Several diners turned to watch as they sat down. Tim sat in the middle with Kelvin on one side and an empty seat for Tal on the other. Richard and Ruby sat opposite with their eldest Manoesk on Richards left and youngest Henry on their right. They ordered drinks and Chi disappeared to get them<br />
“50lbs less mass?” Kelvin said raising an eyebrow.<br />
“Some of them follow my career” Richard said with a slightly fanged grin. <br />
“Where is Bri?” Tim asked picturing the young college student in his head, big intelligent kid. Football and academic star. <br />
“On a visit Home” Richard answered “he wanted to speak to the Elders about the dissertation he’s writing on the tribe’s history”<br />
“How are things with you?” Tim asked Manoesk <br />
“Graduation went well though I’m still looking for something. As soon as some people see the ‘S’ in your social security number its ‘goodbye’ even if I am the best candidate” the young man had the deep voice to match his heavy, muscular build. As he spoke Tim could see the slightly jutting teeth, and realised just how similar he was to his father next to him, in a few years he’d be just Tim’s type.<br />
“I thought there were laws about that sort of thing?” Kelvin said. Manoesk went to answer but a booming voice cut across him<br />
“There are! But some employers choose to ignore them” Kelvin twisted round to see a huge man coming across the restaurant. Several people stared at him, which was not surprising. Kelvin could almost feel the Bear rising inside him with the need to protect Tim, as ridiculous as that was.<br />
<br />
The stranger was at least 10’ tall and about 5’ across the shoulder. About 500lbs of muscle he walked with a huge stride, the clomping sound of his hooves reverberating through the floor. His huge barrel shaped torso was complemented by arms the size of most men’s legs and legs the size of most men’s torsos. A tail swished around his legs which were straight, not backwards bent like an animals, but his head was inhuman, sitting on a thick neck was a huge Bulls head, he had wide brown bovine eyes and a long black muzzle, toped by thick 2’ long polished horns. Dressed in loose clothing that in no way hid his immense form the Minotaur stepped up to the table, Richard jumped up came round the table to give him a hug, allowing his own huge form to be drowned inside the bull mans immense arms. <br />
“Richard, fantastic to see you again” the Minotaur said in slightly quieter tones. “Ruby, boys” he nodded at the family.<br />
“So where is lazy arse?” Richard said <br />
“Out back cooking you guys something special, since he heard you were here. Can't have you picking off the normal menu when your family!” the bull man laughed a deep laugh that went right to Tim’s dick.<br />
“Can I introduce Tim and Kelvin” Richard said indicating the two men. Both stood and shook the stranger's hand.<br />
“Tim, Kelvin may I introduce, not so Little Bull”<br />
“Call me Bull” the huge man said and shook their hands. Richard returned to his seat and waved at Bull to sit too<br />
“Only for a while” he said “If I don’t keep an eye on Silver he’ll cook you the entire place” the Minotaur grinned at them, which was slightly odd, but Tim could not help but smile too, there was something infectious about Bull’s attitude.<br />
“You said your looking for work?” Bull asked Manoesk<br />
“Yeah. Do you need a network? I do special rates for friends” Bull shook his head<br />
“I got my computing covered, however there is a diner who comes in who is looking to re-build his. I’ll ask him to get in touch” Manoesk smiled a big grin at him<br />
“Cheers Uncle, that’d be cool” <br />
<br />
Bull stayed with them until the drinks came and then after watching the waiter like a Hawk stood up and walked him back towards the bar, murmuring in his ear. <br />
“Wow. That a personality” Tim said to Richard.<br />
“He’s a big softy for all he looks big” Richard said.<br />
“Makes a fantastic Apple Pie” Ruby chipped in. Tim chuckled.<br />
“Does he stay like that all the time?” Kelvin asked, he couldn’t see that form being practical everywhere, especially those thick fingers.<br />
“Only at work, home or on public engagements, otherwise he’s goes Human. Prefers his half form” Tim nodded, he understood that. <br />
<br />
They drank in silence for a minute or so, and then Kelvin nudged Tim. <br />
“Over by the door” he said quietly. Tim looked slightly round the Oak. Over by the door were Cosgrove and some of his team. The Greeter had called over a waiter and was pointed out a table to him.<br />
“Oh crap” Tim said. <br />
“Problem?” Richard said looking up from his wife’s eyes. <br />
“FBM guy who busted us earlier just came in” Kelvin said. Manoesk raised a curious eyebrow but said nothing.<br />
“They may be here to just eat” Richard said “ignore them for now” Tim looked nervously to where they waiter led the FBM pack, their table was a long way over the massive room from them though. He relaxed slightly. <br />
“Ok. Now where the heck is Tal?” he said.</p>
