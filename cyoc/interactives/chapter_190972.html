<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a normal day like any other. John was in class chatting with friends during break. &quot;So then I...&quot; They were talking about the latest fighting game that was all the rage. &quot;That sounds totally awesome!&quot; John replied to his friend Mark who was telling them of a secret stage. &quot;I know right?!&quot; &quot;I gotta try it when I get home!&quot; John&#39;s other friend Alex replied. &quot;So, anything cool happen to you?&quot; Mark asked John. &quot;Anything... Anything... Actually last night I... Oh.&quot; &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Mark asked. John had stopped and was clutching his stomach. &quot;Uh... Nothing. Looks like I need to use the B-room.&quot; &quot;Oh come on! Don&#39;t leave us hanging!&quot; Alex shouted. &quot;I won&#39;t!&quot; John replied as he got up. &quot;Miss Golden. Can I use the bathroom?&quot; &quot;Sure thing dear. Just remember break ends in five minutes.&quot; &quot;Got it!&quot; And of John went.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, John&#39;s sister Lucy was enjoying her own time with her best friend Samantha. &quot;And then...&quot; They were talking about their favorite toys. Lucy was a shy person, but had many of the same tastes as Samantha, so they hit it off. She was Lucy&#39;s only friend. &quot;I&#39;m jealous. Wish my parents could get me that.&quot; Lucy decried. &quot;Not letting you?&quot; &quot;Yeah. But John gets all those video games and they costs a lot. It isn&#39;t fair.&quot; &quot;Doesn&#39;t he get good grades though?&quot; &quot;Yeah, but...&quot; Unlike Lucy who was shy and got mediocre grades, John was an outgoing young boy with the best grades in class. &quot;Sometimes, I wish I could trade places with him.&quot; &quot;Ew! Who would want to be an icky boy anyway?!&quot; &quot;I know, but... Oh.&quot; &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; &quot;Think I need to go to the bathroom. Sorry.&quot; &quot;No problem. Let&#39;s talk later after school.&quot; Lucy said her temporary good byes and left. &quot;Mr. Richards, I need to use the bathroom.&quot; &quot;Hm... Oh sure. Just remember to be back in time.&quot; &quot;Yes sir...&quot; And with that Lucy left.<br />
<br />
Back to John, he left the classroom. &quot;Oh boy... Looks like I really need to go.&quot; John rushed to the 4th grade boy&#39;s bathroom. No one else was there at the moment. &quot;Looks like I&#39;ve got it all to myself.&quot; John motioned towards a stall and pulled his pants down. He opened the space between his underwear and whipped out his penis. He then immediately started going No. 1. &quot;Ah... Now that&#39;s the stuff...&quot; John continued to go. &quot;Man, I must have really needed to go!&quot; A good 20 seconds had passed and John was still peeing. He was looking forward at the stream of piss and thus was unable to see something truly strange happening. His wiener was shrinking into his underwear. Slowly but surely it was not only pushing in, but getting skinnier. To John it looked like he was finishing up. &quot;Finally! Wonder what I drank to...Huh?&quot; And that&#39;s when it happened. His dwindling pee-pee slipped from his hands. &quot;What&#39;s going on-ah!&quot; Before he could fully react, he could feel his underwear getting wet. &quot;Ah! Oh crud!&quot; John panicked and tried to stop going completely. &quot;What the... Where did my wee-wee go?!&quot; John pulled his underwear down and was greeted with a shocking sight. &quot;It&#39;s gone?!&quot; John looked down in horror. His penis and balls were gone. In its place was a small slit that dripped small amounts of pee onto his wet underwear.<br />
<br />
Back to Lucy, she rushed towards the nearest bathroom which was the unisex one near the cafeteria. Once inside she went to the toilet, pulled her pants and panties down and did her business. &quot;Ahh.... That was a close one. Imagine if I peed myself? Now that would be embarrassing.&quot; As she continued to think those unpleasant thoughts, she continued to pee. &quot;Wow, did I drink too much apple juice this morning?&quot; It was a good twenty second later and Lucy was still going. Eventually she could hear the pee stop hitting the toilet water. &quot;Finally... guess I should try to go No. 2 just in case.&quot; As Lucy did that, a strange thing was happening to her body. She was still peeing, but it was actually hitting near the top of the toilet. A mushroom shaped piece of flesh was growing out of Lucy&#39;s vagina taking out with it a thin stalk of flesh as well. Two flat shaped pieces of flesh were also growing out from underneath and they filled out into a ball shape. Lucy was growing a young boy&#39;s penis unknowingly. But soon it grew out too much and a stream of piss flew outside the toilet. Lucy noticed it immediately. &quot;What the?! Ah!&quot; Lucy pushed her new appendage back inside the toilet and stopped her peeing unable to stop from wetting her hands. &quot;What just hap-&quot; But before Lucy could finish her sentence, she felt something strange. Where nothing but a flat mound should have been, something bigger was there. She played around with it and slowly uncovered her privates. &quot;AHHHHHHHHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
John couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. He should have had something sticking out of his groin area, but now there was nothing but an open slit. John spread it apart. He peed a little again. It was definitely coming out of the hole in his groin. &quot;This can&#39;t be happening!&quot; Scared, John ran towards the toilet stalls and closed the door. Removing his shoes, he took of his pants and carefully removed his wet underwear so as not to get his pants wet. John sat back on the toilet seat. &quot;What&#39;s going on?! Where&#39;s my pee-pee go?!&quot; John&#39;s thoughts became a bundled mess as he tired to figure out what was happening. &quot;Agh... Oh.... My body!&quot; Suddenly John&#39;s whole body shook once more. His stomach ache came back with a vengeance. &quot;Ah...&quot; Tears formed in John&#39;s eyes as his body went through a miraculous transformation. John was looking down at his feet, when he saw his socks getting looser. &quot;What?!&quot; John took of his socks and was greeted with an eerie sight. His feet were shrinking ever so slightly. His toes followed suit becoming girly in form. &quot;My feet are changing?! No way!&quot; The changes continued as John felt his legs lift up and move off the floor. He wiggled his tinier feet in vain trying to reach the bottom. His legs lost what tiny hair he had growing out of them as they thinned and pushed back into his pelvis. His butt was shrinking as well and without warning the seat became to big for it as John fell in. &quot;Gah! Holy cow!&quot; John lifted himself up as his hands were next the shrink, following the same trajectory as his feet. John could feel himself sinking in as his arms shrank too. His shirt felt looser around his torso and his nipples felt a little more puffy then before. &quot;This is a dream! This has to be a dream, right?! Ah!&quot; The second sentence sounded much higher in pitch then before. Unable to keep holding on, John got up again and placed his bare feet on the ground. &quot;My voice!&quot; John grabbed his neck and could no longer feel his Adam&#39;s Apple. &quot;I sound like a girl! Wait... I sound like...&quot; Unable to see what it looked like John&#39;s face morphed. Hair jutted out from his skull and turned a light shade of blond. His blue eyes turned green. He let out one final shudder as his transformation was complete.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHHHHHHH!&quot; Unable to stifle a scream, Lucy looked in horror at her groin. What should have been nothing but a mound with an open hole, was a decent kid sized cock and balls. &quot;I have a pee-pee now?! But... But only boys should have... Ah!&quot; Before she could even comprehend the changes, her stomach burned as she went No. 2. &quot;Oh... Agh... Oof!&quot; While that happened, Lucy could feel her feet get tight in her shoes. Ignoring the pain, she tried to take them off. With some difficulty, she succeeded only to be taken by an even weirder sight. &quot;My feet?!&quot; In front of Lucy, her feet had grown, ripping her socks. Her toes stuck out as she wiggled them. &quot;These... these aren&#39;t my toes!&quot; They looked bigger, almost like that of a boys. As she continued to wiggle them, her feet touched the ground even though she hadn&#39;t moved them herself. &quot;No way!&quot; Lucy&#39;s legs were growing. Her butt was pushed closer to the end of the toilet seat as she finished pooping. Her butt also felt like it was covering more of the seat now too. &quot;This can&#39;t be happening to me!&quot; Lucy eyed her ever growing body. Her hands were the next to grow. She gazed at them as her fingers splayed and grew out, nails growing back in. Her arms grew out too. Lucy could see a small amount of hair growing out of her skin. She looked down again and saw that her bigger legs were also getting a little hairy. Her shirt started to get a little tighter as her torso grew. Her growing boobies were no more under her tightening shirt. &quot;This can&#39;t be... It just can&#39;t! Ah!&quot; As Lucy spoke the second sentence, her voice had changed, was a little deeper. &quot;Ah... Ah! My voice!&quot; Lucy felt her neck as a small bump formed. &quot;I sound like a boy... Wait! I sound like...!&quot; As Lucy finally realized what was going on, her face morphed. Her slightly long blond hair sunk into her skull turning a brownish color as her green eyes turned blue. Lucy shuddered once more time as her transformation was complete.<br />
<br />
John took out his phone and Lucy got up and moved towards the mirror. In front of John, his older sister Lucy&#39;s face stared back. In the mirror Lucy saw her baby brother. The one she said she wanted to be. &quot;Crud!!&quot; was all the two said as they realized they had swapped bodies</p>
