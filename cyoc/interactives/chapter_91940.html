<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam woke up and to a cramp in his stomach that made him aware that he had to poop. He was about to call out when he realized that Greg was still sleeping. He knew that if he woke him he would cry and Jane would be mad with him. He tried to climb over the side of the crib, but found that the rails were too high. While he was still trying to climb out of the crib he felt the mass being pushed into my diaper. He stood up awkwardly on the mattress bending his knees a little. He pushed out all the poo. It wasn&#39;t that solid so it was very easy. When he was done he sat down slowly and felt the mush spread around his butt. He hated the feeling of sitting in his own poo. It felt mushy and gross. He laid in the crib on my back. He pulled one of the small blankets over himself and closed his eyes. <br />
 He woke up for the second time to Michael crying. Jane must have heard him crying because she came into the room. She went over to Greg and michael and checked their pull-ups. They were dry. She then came over to Sam and pulled him to his feet and turning him around in the process. She looked down the back of his diaper and commented on the mess he made. He was laid down on the changing table. He looked up at the ceiling not wanting to witness what was about to happen. He herd the familiar *scritch* *scritch* of the tapes being unfastened. His ankles were grabbed and his butt was raised into the air. The clean part of the diaper was used to wipe some of the poo off his bum. He looked down to see his legs in the air and Jane grabbing some wet wipes. His bum was wiped clean of all the poo. The dirty wipes were placed in the dirty diaper and then thrown away. His legs were released and he laid there naked in front of Jane. Jane got him a new diaper from under the table and opened it up. She raised his butt off the table and placed it under him. She rubbed cream into my crotch and then put some powder on him. Finally the diaper was pulled snug up through his legs and taped at the front. Jane then went over to the dresser and pulled out a shirt that said &quot;Mommy&#39;s Boy&quot; and pulled it over his head. He was let down off the table and could see that the shirt only covered the top part of the diaper.<br />
<br />
When Greg and Michael were done being changed themselves, Jane put each of them back in their cribs and took her shirt off revealing a white nursing bra holding her large J cup breasts in them. She then took off her bra leaving her topless and picked up Sam. She breastfed him for a few minutes and then put him back in his crib. He was the only one she breastfed anymore. The other two had stopped a few months ago, but Sam wouldn&#39;t stop.<br />
<br />
They all went downstairs for some breakfast. Sam waddled a little bit with the thick diapers between his legs. Jessica could be heard in the living room watching the news. Greg, Michael and sam were put in highchairs. Each was given a bowl of cheerios with milk.<br />
<br />
After they had all finished eating Greg and Michael were each put on the potty. While Sam just stayed in his highchair. They were then taken up into their bedroom to play for a while whilst Jane and Jessica got changed. <br />
<br />
Jane had decided on going to the quarry to swim that day and so changed into her one piece bathing suit and put on a pair of jeans over the top. So she could feed Sam if he needed it.<br />
<br />
Jessica was dressed a little differently, instead of wearing a one piece she wore a bikini. It barely held her G cup breasts in but she didn&#39;t fancy stealing clothes off of her sister. She then put on a pair of shorts and a tank top so she could get changed easily when they got to the quarry. Finally she put on her glasses. She would have to take them off eventually yes. But she could see better with them on<br />
<br />
Jane then went and got Sam, Greg and Michael ready. She change Greg and Michael into pairs of swim trunks and changed Sam into a swim diaper. She then called Jessica to get in the car.<br />
<br />
 The lake was pretty big and was usually packed with kids. Jessica went to go and swim in the large lake where all of the older kids were. You had to be over 12 to even go in their and even though she was only 18 she could pass for 25 with her figure. Sam, Greg and Michael were taken out of the car, and over to the wading pool. Their were a few parents with younger children sitting on the edge of the pool as they watched their little ones splash around. Jane sat next to a lady on the edge of the pool. The lady had her baby sitting in the pool right in front of her. Sam noticed that the girl didn&#39;t have on any clothes, she was sitting in the pool butt naked. &quot;Forgot to buy the little one a swim diaper.&quot; said the lady when mommy sat down next to her. <br />
 &quot;Me too, these regular diapers will swell up like balloons if they try to go in them.&quot; said Jane in response. <br />
 Greg and Michael were stripped of their clothes and placed next to the other baby. Jane then started to take off Sam&#39;s T-Shirt, but he pulled away in protest, saying that he would not go naked. Jane laughed and said that he was foolish and had nothing to hide. She grabbed him tight as he tried to squirm away. His shirt was taken off and then the denim shorts were pulled off his feet. Lastly his diaper was ripped off him leaving me exposed to the whole world. He was placed in the pool. He sat down immediately because he thought at least under the water you couldn&#39;t see much.</p>
