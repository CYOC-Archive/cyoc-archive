<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex took a few more bites of stew before finally getting to his feet. He walked over to the door, placing his hand on the handle for a moment, trying to decide if he really did want to follow after Taki. He could have sworn the tanuki wanted him to. After a moment&#39;s more hesitation he opened the door and stepped through. It led to a tunnel, dark unlike the well lit den behind him, but with a glow up ahead. The floor and walls were smoothed and it was tall enough that Alex could stand as he walked the several feet to the end of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
At the end, it opened up into a cavern, much more natural than the burrow, but even more spacious. The sound of running water reached his ears first, but his eyes were drawn upwards. A crack opened at the top, allowing a jagged view of a starry sky and a bit of the moon hanging over head. A few lamps sat around the cavern providing illumination, much like the ones that lit Taki&#39;s home.<br />
<br />
Water gushed from a crack in the wall, spilling into a pool that took up one half of the cavern. Only then did Alex realize the cave was humid and warm, even naked at night he felt comfortable. Steam rose off the water and sitting mostly submerged in the water was the furry form of Taki. He was muttering to himself, normally it would have been too low for Alex to hear, but the cavern echoed slightly, not that he could make out the words, until he stepped closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid tanuki.&quot; Taki was whispering to himself as he soaked in the steamy water. &quot;Don&#39;t be getting any ideas. It never ends well with humans. Even with flings. Just get him to the town and then forget about him..&quot; Alex stopped with his hand on the wall, mossy green under his fingers. Surprisingly, those words seemed to hurt more than they should. Why should he expect Taki to have feelings? They really only spent a couple hours together, and even if the dream had been vivid, it was just that. Though just thinking of the dream made his cock twitch eagerly.<br />
<br />
Alex turned to go and accidentally kicked a rock across the cavern, the clacking echoing in the open space. &quot;Alex?&quot; His back stiffened and he turned to see Taki standing and facing him, his wet fur plastered to his body showing of his physicality now that is had lost its fluffiness. &quot;You.. heard that didn&#39;t you?&quot; Taki frowned, an expression that looked distinctly wrong on his cheery round face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I get it. I mean, we don&#39;t even really know each other. And sure you&#39;re uh..&quot; Alex swallowed, looking at Taki once again, his cock aimed like a compass pointer right at the tanuki. &quot;I&#39;ll just..&quot; Alex jerked his thumb over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.&quot; Taki said, holding out a paw. &quot;Come on, the waters nice, and you could probably do with a soak. We can talk at least.&quot; Alex hesitated, then crossed the smooth rock floor of the cave and stepped into the pool. It was pleasantly warm, not too hot, and smelled minerally, and was surprisingly clear. Taki sat back down on a rock ledge that worked as a bench under the water and Alex plopped down next to him, close enough he could feel fur against his skin. It did feel nice. Both the water and the fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.. humans are bad news, then?&quot; Alex said, trying to sound joking, but Taki&#39;s ears drooped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all. But some. Especially to us magic creatures. That&#39;s why I go into town as a human.&quot; Taki leaned back, soaking in the water as he looked up at the sky. &quot;Only my friend knows what I am, and even I think he sometimes just keeps it to himself for what I can supply him. Humans get a taste of magic and they get greedy.&quot; He lowered his head. &quot;I saw how you looked at those leaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex blushed, feeling a little ashamed. He had thought of using those leaves, getting the body he had always wanted. &quot;I, uh..&quot; Alex stumbled over his words. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I, this is hard to say, but I&#39;ve just never been happy with myself. You&#39;re right, I saw that and I got excited, but is that so bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Taki admitted. &quot;But then I ended up hurting you. Not directly, but my magic did. Humans and magic creatures don&#39;t mix, not well.&quot; Taki placed a paw on Alex&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Even if you are very cute. You should be happy with yourself, it&#39;s not a bad self to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex felts his cheeks heating up at the compliment, but he didn&#39;t know what to say, instead he leaned against the tanuki, resting his head on a furry shoulder. He wasn&#39;t shrugged off, instead an arm wrapped around him and pulled him in close.  They sat like that in silence for a few long minutes, just enjoying each other&#39;s presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Screw it.&quot; Taki finally said, placing a paw under Alex&#39;s chin. He leaned in and pressed his muzzle to Alex&#39;s lips. The kiss was odd at first, muzzle to mouth, but as the tanuki&#39;s tongue danced with his own, Alex found he rather enjoyed it. The paw slipped from under his chin, ran down his smooth chest and stomach, and cupped his balls. The tanuki started fondling Alex&#39;s magic swollen orbs, and seemed to know exactly what he was doing, as it was one of the most fantastic feelings he had experienced. The paw didn&#39;t even touch his cock, but he didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
He reached between Taki&#39;s legs, placing his hand on one of the tanuki&#39;s massive balls, he could only really hold one, and even that was a tenuous grip, like trying to hold a basketball one handed, but he tried rubbing it and massaging it like Taki was doing for him, and that seemed to do the trick, as the tanuki&#39;s kissing grew even more impassioned the more Alex teased those giant testicles.<br />
<br />
When the paw finally wrapped around his cock he didn&#39;t last long. That was more sensitive as well it seemed. A few solid jerks from the tanuki ad he was gasping for air, the most powerful orgasm he had ever felt in his life wracking his body, he collapsed against Taki&#39;s fur covered chest, drawing a chuckle from the tanuki. &quot;I guess the tanuki magic is still playing havoc with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex could only find his voice enough to letting out a soft whimper. It felt like it took hours for then sensation to pass, even if it was only seconds. He moves his own hand to Taki&#39;s swollen member, thick and hot in his palm, but Taki pried his hand off. &quot;No. I told you it&#39;s got magic in it and the last time you got a tiny dose you passed out. And I make a huge mess, that would not be a tiny dose.&quot; Alex nodded and pulled his hand back, making Taki gave him another quick kiss.<br />
<br />
They stayed like that a for a while longer, just cuddling in the warm water, though eventually Taki stood and climbed out of the water, shaking himself at least partially dry. Alex followed after a moment, the night air on his damp skin giving him instant goose flesh. The trip back to the burrow was quick, and once he stepped inside the warmth of the room seeped into him, helping him to dry. Taki instead plucked a small leaf from one of his plants and tapped it to his forehead, making his fur dry and fluffy in an instant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheater.&quot; Alex muttered. Taki just let out one of those barking laughs and handed him a towel from a cupboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can have the bed.&quot; Taki said with a smile, then nodded to a corner near the hearth. &quot;I&#39;ll make myself a little nest over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot; Alex stated as he took Taki&#39;s paw in his hands, pulling him over to the bed before flopping down. &quot;We share.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taki&#39;s expression twisted slightly, but he finally nodded. Before climbing into bed though he reached out to one of the lamps on the wall, tapping it with a clawed finger. All the lamps dimmed until the room was light by only the faintest glow. Of course, even the lamps were magic. Alex crawled into the nest of pillows and blankets, and soon Taki was laying next to him. For a long moment Alex worried that the tanuki was going to fall asleep like that, but finally he felt a pair of strong, furry arms wrapping around him, and a fluffy tail laying across him as well. He rested his head on Taki&#39;s chest and soon was drifting off to sleep.</p>
