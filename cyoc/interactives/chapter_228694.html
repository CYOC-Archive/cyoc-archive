<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roy was looking around, trying to decide what to suggest to his friends first. Even though he usually went with the flow, horror was kind of his thing and for once they might actually listen to his suggestions first. IT wasn&#39;t that his friends ignored him on purpose, Roy just had a hard time speaking up for himself and putting his foot down. Especially with John.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the hairy guy running across their path just made him a little uncomfortable, and not in the good horror way. He looked around in the other direction and caught the gaze of a man standing next to one of the kiosks.  Once their eyes met, Roy simply couldn&#39;t tear his gaze away. The man smiled and crooked a finger, and Roy found his feet carrying him forward against his will. Or was it with his will? He wasn&#39;t so sure. He wanted to meet this man more than anything in that moment.<br />
<br />
Behind him he heard Ryan asking John, &quot;Hey, were did Roy go?&quot; But he was soon lost in the small crowd, short enough to disappear in nearly any group of people. Even as people walked between him and the one he was walking to, it wasn&#39;t enough to break the seeming compulsion he had to keep moving forward. As he neared, he got a better look at the man. He was tall and well muscled, wearing tight jeans that showed off well sculpted legs and an even tighter shirt that hugged an obviously plump pair of pectorals and rounded shoulders. His skin was practically flawless and sunkissed. HIs hair was a reddish auburn that seemed like a fire even in the night, with a neatly sculpted beard along his perfectly square jaw.<br />
<br />
Roy had never really been interested in anyone before, until he saw this man. And now he knew, he finally understood what it was to want someone with every fiber of his being. &quot;Well, aren&#39;t you a cute one?&quot; The man asked in a smooth, deep baritone that sent shivers up Roy&#39;s spine. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man towered several inches over the short Roy, and he found himself looking up into eyes that were an unnatural shade of green that almost seemed to glow. &quot;Roy.&quot; He replied, his voice sounding weak and breathy even to his own ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roy..&quot; The man repeated, caressing the word with his tongue and lips. &quot;I like it, rhymes with toy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Toy.&quot; Roy repeated dumbly, making the man smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;ll be a fun project. I was hoping for a challenge, and you&#39;ll certainly do. I have a spot that needs filling, and you&#39;re going to fill it.&quot; The man said with a devilish smile. Roy looked down at the man&#39;s jeans, less at the ample bulge in the front and more at his rounded rear. &quot;Not that type of filling, but if you&#39;re good, I might let you have a taste. Come on.&quot; The man turned and started walking to one of the buildings, Roy could only follow, trailing after him like an obedient dog.<br />
<br />
They went to the theater, but instead of walking in the front they went to one of the side doors. The man opened it and ushered Roy through. He stepped into a backstage area. He could see the theater sage from the side, but he could only hear the crowd. They were whistling and cheering, and it was no wonder. A pair of the most interesting individuals Roy had ever seen were on the stage. Well, most interesting other than the man who had led him here.<br />
<br />
They both wore spangled vests and leggings. Well, the leggings were really more like chaps, with a codpiece, leaving their asses bare to view. One was tall and pale, but he didn&#39;t look sickly, in fact his body was almost as well muscled as Roy&#39;s guide. He just lacked color, even his hair was a deep glossy black. The other man didn&#39;t have much color to him either, though he was a stony gray. In fact, his skin looked like polished granite. Though man might not have been the right word. He was quite obviously male, heavily muscled and solidly build as a professional body builder, but his face had a certain animal cast to it, and a pair of obsidian black horns curled from his brow. A thick reptilian-like tail grew from above his rump which led to oddly jointed legs and splayed clawed feet, and his vest had slits in the back to allow for a pair of wings. It was an odd pairing, one practically human in appearance and the other quite obviously a monster.<br />
<br />
The two were doing an acrobatic dance to a jazzy musical number. A quite lewd dance, too. John would have loved it. &quot;That&#39;s Cas and Mal, you&#39;ll meet them later. Careful with Cas, he likes to have a taste of the new guys.&quot; Roy almost jumped at the deep voice, remembering the man who escorted him here, the dance actually enough to break the trance for a moment, though it seemed to put its own hypnotic spell on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taste?&quot; Roy asked dumbly, and his guide mimed biting and tapped his fingers to his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Through there.&quot; The man pointed to a door further behind the curtained stage, and Roy obediently headed towards it, the name &#39;Blaise&#39; was written on a plaque screwed to the door. Roy opened it to step into what looked like half dressing room, half bed room of someone who really liked black and red. The furniture was almost all black, from the vanity, to the couch, to the queen bed that took up the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
The man, who Roy now assumed was Blaise pointed to the middle of the room. &quot;Strip. I want to see what I have to work with.&quot; Roy obediently went to where Blaise pointed and began to pull his shirt off over his head. Though at that moment the door swung open and a large man stepped into the room. He wore a similar costume to the two men on stage, but this one was black leather with silver studs, and had a harness instead of a vest. Like all the men Roy had seen in this theater, he was thickly muscled, though not as much as the stone guy, and maybe a little less than Blaise, but he was also quite hairy, though the thick brown hair was in all the right places along his chest and rocky abs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boss!&quot; The guy said in a gravelly half-whisper. &quot;Great, you&#39;re back. Tank wandered off again and I can&#39;t find him, and.. oh.. did you find up a new guy?&quot; Suddenly the hirsute man&#39;s attention was on Roy, making him quite conscious of the fact he no longer had his shirt on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and I need to handle this, Jay. So use that nose of yours to track Tank down and tell Cas and Mal they&#39;ll need to do a back to back while you look. You can do a five minute intermission, too.&quot; Jay was nodding to the words, but his nose was also twitching as he regarded Roy. &quot;Now, Jay. I&#39;ll be busy for the next couple hours, but soon we&#39;ll have someone to help take off some of the pressure.&quot; The soft reprimand elicited a whimper from Jay, but he saluted Blaise and scrambled out of the room, closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Werewolves. Sexy and loyal, but sadly not usually that bright.&quot; Blaise explained to Roy, then motioned at him again. &quot;Strip.&quot; Roy unbuttoned his jeans and let them drop to the floor along with his boxers. Roy knew he might not be much to look at. Girls, and some boys, said he had a cute face, but it was boyish and young looking. But he was short, and rarely if ever worked out. In fact he was pretty much rail thin, something he hid with his baggy clothes. He wasn&#39;t well endowed either, and was quite aware of Blaise checking that out. Finally, he left his hair a shaggy mess because it hid the fact that even at 21 his hairline was starting to retreat.<br />
<br />
Blaise seemed to sense Roy&#39;s unease. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, when I&#39;m done with you no one will recognize you, not your two friends, not even your family. The question is, what to make of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make of me?&quot; The longer he was around Blaise, the less his head felt full of cotton, but he still longed to make this man happy with him with every fiber of his being. <br />
<br />
&quot;What type of monster for our little troupe. We have a vampire, a gargoyle, a pair of werewolves, a minotaur, and of course.. me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You?&quot; Roy asked. There was definitely something unnaturally compelling about Blaise, but he looked perfectly human.<br />
<br />
He looked down at himself and laughed. &quot;Silly me, I didn&#39;t want to make too much of a stir out there so I disguised myself. I forgot.&quot; Blise snapped his fingers and his clothes disappeared in a flash of fire, leaving him completely naked in front of Roy. Trimmed auburn hair covered his chest and abdominals and his cock was.. well, it was probably the biggest cock Roy had ever seen on anything remotely human. Not that he had seen many, but he knew John prided himself on how hung he was and Blaise was definitely bigger.<br />
<br />
Blaise stretched, as his skin went from tan to a shade of red, a pair of horns sprouting from his brow. His lower legs sprouted a thick coating of auburn hair as his feet twisted into hooves in a way that looked painful to Roy but Blaise actually seemed to enjoy, and a spade tipped tail shot from the base of his spine, lashing behind him. Roy knew he should be scared, but Blaise was even more hypnotically compelling like this. Roy wanted to kneel in front of him and service that cock, but only the command to stand where he was kept him from doing so. &quot;You&#39;re a demon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An incubus.&quot; Blaise said, both correcting and expounding. &quot;A demon of lust and sex. Explains a lot, doesn&#39;t it? I do the last shows of the night since they usually devolve into orgies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy raised his hand, and Blaise stepped forward, a smile on his devilishly handsome, bearded face. &quot;Go ahead. You may touch.&quot; ROy placed his hand on the demon&#39;s chest, feeling the hair under his palm. He gave the pec a squeeze, he expected it to be rock solid, but it was actually quite soft, until Blaise flexed for him. &quot;You&#39;ll get plenty of that in the future, even some of your own to play with. But we need to get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blaise stepped around behind Roy. &quot;Maybe a satyr, someone who can keep up with the orgies.&quot; Blaise mused. Roy expected a demon would smell like sulfur, but he smelled instead like a campfire. Earthy, smoky. &quot;Or a centaur, limits you in the dance numbers, and the last one I made Damien stole for his races, but some want to see them performing in other ways after those races.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could think of things we could do with three werewolves, too.&quot; Blaise pressed up against Roy&#39;s back. He reached around and grabbed Roy&#39;s now stiffened cock in his hand. He began to stroke it, slowly, but with each stroke it grew longer and thicker. Roy gasped softly. &quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll enjoy every moment of this. I work through lust and sex, so this will be a literally orgasmic experience.&quot; Blaise&#39;s other hand came from around Roy&#39;s other side to cup his balls, kneading those larger with teasing fingers. But before Roy could shoot his load, Blaise let go, leaving him with a cock that stuck out painfully, but a much more impressive seven inches, with a matching pair of balls handing between his thighs. &quot;There, that&#39;s a start, but it will need to be bigger eventually, once I know what I&#39;m doing with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blaise flopped on the couch, both lounging and showing off his impressive body for Roy, who he examined like an artist looking at a blank canvas. &quot;Or maybe you have an idea?&quot; Blaise said with a devilish grin. &quot;Something your heart lusts for.&quot;</p>
