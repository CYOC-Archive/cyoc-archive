<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff thought for a few moments, before saying, &quot;Is there any other body you can give me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we only have two bodies on file for your location,&quot; said Frank. &quot;I would give you another body, but there's a whole mess of quantum physics that makes it impossible for us to make targeted changes from a distance. I'd try to explain why, but it's all really technical. Even I don't understand some of the details of it, and I have a doctorate in particle physics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said Jeff, looking crestfallen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffy?&quot; said Jamie. &quot;Who are you talking to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a minute, Jamie,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our hands are a bit tied, you see,&quot; said Frank. &quot;We can only make changes in that location based on the information we received from your Chronivac. And, well, we only received information on two bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff realized what his options were. He looked at Jamie with her grown up body and shuddered at the thought of what he was about to ask Frank to do. &quot;So, only my body and my sister's?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'm afraid,&quot; said Frank.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to his confused looking sister. &quot;Jamie,&quot; he said gently. &quot;Could you leave me alone for a few minutes?&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed. &quot;Fine! But, I want to use your computer later. Can I use it later?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Jeff. &quot;You can use it later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled and kissed his forehead. &quot;Thanks, Jeffy,&quot; she said and walked away.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched her go, examining her body from behind as she left. He took a deep breath and sighed. He couldn't believe what he was about to say. &quot;Can you give me my sister's body too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; said Frank, looking a bit confused. &quot;Um, let me see if I understand you right. You want me to change your body to be the same as your sister's?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blushed and avoided looking the hologram of Frank in the eyes. &quot;I figure it would be better to have a grown up body than a kid's body. I don't think I could stand waiting for weeks with a little body like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Frank. &quot;You do realize that you will be female?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...for at least a month.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Very well then. At TransDem we're not in the habit of judging our customers' choices. We do cater to more...&quot; He searched for a diplomatic word. &quot;...exotic tastes, after all.&quot; Frank keyed in the changes as Jeff anxiously watched his hologram. It took Frank a minute to complete the coding since there were some serious reality alterations accompanying this type of change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Frank as he finished typing. &quot;Everything looks ready to go. Since you and your sister will be identical after this, I had to alter reality to make you two into twins. Making a big change like that happen from a long-distance Chronivac took a bit of creative coding, if I do say so myself.&quot; Frank paused, feeling proud of his work. He looked at anxious little Jeff. &quot;One last time, are you sure you want to do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at his feet. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank pressed a button and Jeff started to grow. Too many things were changing for him to take it all in at once. He felt himself growing taller and older. His hair was growing out on his head, tickling the back of his neck. His face seemed to be reshaping. He felt his genitals suck up into his body, reforming into a vagina. As his body entered puberty, his hips widened and his butt ballooned out, while his chest inflated with a pair of giant breasts. All the while his clothes were reforming themselves into a dress, identical to the one his sister had been wearing. Everything swelled and stretched and grew seemingly out of control until suddenly, it stopped.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt very disorientated. He shook his head to try to refocus his mind and felt his long hair whip around wildly. He looked around himself at his room. His walls were now painted pink and his room was decorated much like his sister's room had been. He took a deep breath and looked down at his body. His eyes were immediately drawn to the long line of cleavage on his chest. His breasts were huge! This had to be a mistake, he thought. Jamie's breasts couldn't have been this big. Without thinking, he reached up his hands to cup them. The sensation of his large breasts in his dainty female hands was incredible. Maybe the next few weeks would be alright after all, he thought. This could be fun. He heard a little moan escape his lips, which shocked him back to reality. He jerked his hands away from his chest.<br />
<br />
He had just heard his little 10-year-old sister moaning suggestively. Nothing could be more disgusting for him to hear while touching himself. So much for this being fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man,&quot; he said, hearing his sister talking again from his own mouth. He looked over at the semi-transparent Frank and blushed. Jeff had all but forgotten that he wasn't alone. &quot;Can we just pretend that that didn't happen?&quot; said Jeff, still weirded out by his girlish voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't see a thing,&quot; said Frank, playing dumb. &quot;Nothing at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Jeff. He looked behind himself to see his giant ass. No doubt about it. From the neck down, he was every bit as curvy and sexy looking as his sister. &quot;Unbelievable,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Frank, sounding impatient now. &quot;If you're satisfied with your customer support here, then I need to get going. I have a few reports to file and a lot of meetings to get to later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a bit uncertain over whether he wanted to stay this way or not, but he replied, &quot;I guess this is the best we can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; said Frank, who then added as an aside, &quot;Oh, by the way, your new name is Jenny or Jennifer. It was the closest thing to Jeff I could come up with as far as girls' names go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Jenny?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
She rolled the thought of being Jenny for a month around in her head. She would just have to make due with it. &quot;Alright, I guess I'm good for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, good luck, Jenny,&quot; said Frank as his hologram started to dissolve. &quot;We'll be in touch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank vanished, and Jenny wandered over to her bed to lie down and stare at the ceiling. She felt the weight of her breasts flatten a little against her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's going to be a long month,&quot; she said. She heard footsteps coming down the hallway. When she looked out her door, Jenny saw...</p>
