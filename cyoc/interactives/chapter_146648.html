<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After meeting with Jackie&#39;s parents the two teens asked that Gloria&#39;s friends meet them at Katie&#39;s house. The teens now sat and listened to what the couple had say, confused as to what they wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn Jackie that sucks,&quot;  Sasha said. &quot;How are Ann&#39;s parents going to meet yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heres the thing,&quot; Ann sighed. &quot;They won&#39;t.&quot; The girls now stared at Ann in confusion as the grown down Ann slowly stood. &quot;Look,&quot; she said. &quot;If either of our parents found out I&#39;m an adult theres no way it could go well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How come,&quot; Diane asked. &quot;I mean your parents already know about the ring Ann and they know your bisexual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they do,&quot; Ann countered. &quot;What they dont know is that I become a teen to...well date a bisexual teenage girl. It doesnt matter that when Jackie and me are our true ages we dont have a relationship. They&#39;ll only see the age difference. It would land Jackie in trouble and could land me in jail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think both your parents would freak out that much,&quot; Naomi asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jackie sighed. &quot;My folks would flip if they found out Ann was usually a adult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And my folks would not only kill me but Lisa and Kellie too,&quot; Ann added. &quot;Unfortunately for right now we still have to keep things secretive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you have in mind,&quot; Diane asked. Jackie and Ann looked nervously at one another before turning towards Gloria.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been talking with both of them,&quot; Gloria sighed. &quot;And well we came up with an idea. One of us is going to have to impersonate Ann&#39;s parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria&#39;s friends gaped at one another, before peppering Gloria, Ann and Jackie with questions. How would they do this? Was this the only way? And finally, what did they mean by parents?<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa slowly down,&quot; Gloria exclaimed. &quot;Look, I know this is alot to take in. Heres the thing though. Ann brought this up. Whoever is Ann&#39;s parents is going to have to look like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I&#39;m out then,&quot; Naomi huffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Naomi,&quot; Gloria smiled. &quot;But it&#39;s not just you. Sasha and Diane are out too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How come,&quot; Diane asked. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Sasha added. &quot;I mean we would be more than willing to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks guys,&quot; Ann smiled. &quot;But heres the problem. Both if you have black hair and well I&#39;m a blond. Not sure if you guys of had this in biology yet but, if either of you were my mom I would have dark hair. No, who ever is going to impersonate my mom is going to have to have light hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls now looked first at Gloria before turning towards Felicia. &quot;No way,&quot; Felicia whispered. &quot;Are you guys serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Felicia we are,&quot; Jackie said. &quot;Because you see that&#39;s what makes the most sense. After all, both you and Gloria have boyfriends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Felicia exclaimed. &quot;Are you saying what I think your saying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Felicia,&quot; Gloria sighed. &quot;Were telling Nate and Adam about the rings.&quot;<br />
<br />
The next day Gloria and her friends found themselves sitting down with the Haskin twins inside Katie&#39;s empty house. The girls had been apprehensive about telling the guys about this (even though their mom not only knew about the rings, but thoroughly enjoyed using them). Adam and Nate stared at the girls dumbfounded, still unable to wrap their minds around the fact the girls had magic, even after watching a demonstration.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s bullshit,&quot; Adam huffed. &quot;No offense babe. That kind of thing is a trick or something. You know, like with mirrors or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its true Adam,&quot; Felicia said. &quot;I mean you just saw what happened to Gloria&#39;s aunt. That wa as no trick.&quot; Adam now glanced over at the gothic teenage girl, still unable to comprehend she had been old enough to be his mom only moments before. Turning towards his girlfriend, he now gave her a critical look. &quot;Your actually 15 though right,&quot; he asked. &quot;I mean, you didnt change your age did you. Your not like my moms age or something right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicia glared angrily at her boyfriend before smacking him upside the head. &quot;Of course I&#39;m 15 you jackass,&quot; she yelled. Adam apologised quickly, rubbing the sore spot on the back of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why are you telling us this Glo,&quot; Nate asked as he looked at his girlfriend. &quot;My aunt needs our help,&quot; she stated. &quot;You see, Ann and Jackie well...date whenever she becomes a teen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam stifled a laugh as he now looked at Jackie. &quot;Way to go Jackie,&quot; he smirked. &quot;Never would of though you&#39;d date a milf.&quot; The group collectively groaned, Ann and Jackie blushing crimson as Felicia buried her head in her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam I love you,&quot; Felicia groaned. &quot;But seriously, you gotta shut up now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So you need either me or Adam to help,&quot; Nate said quickly trying to change the subject. &quot;Does that mean what I think it means?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Gloria said. &quot;We need either you or Adam to pretend to be Ann&#39;s dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam and Nate now looked at one another apprehensively. Before Nate could give an answer Adam lept to his feet. &quot;Yo I volunteer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Felicia exclaimed. &quot;Adam you cant be serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Felicia listen,&quot; Adam said. &quot;Look, I know you probably think Nate and Glo would be good but I think we would be perfect. I promise babe, I wont let you down. Besides I&#39;m really good at making a first impression with parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont know,&quot; Felicia said. &quot;I mean this is really important. We cant screw this up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I didnt screw up when I met your folks,&quot; he smirked. &quot;Your folks love me babe.&quot; Felicia paused as she critically looked her boyfriend over. Adam may not have been the most well mannered guy out there but he did know how to make a good impression with parents. &quot;Okay,&quot; Felicia sighed. &quot;But you better behave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe its me,&quot; he smirked.<br />
<br />
The plan now was simple. Ann, Felicia, and Ann would be having dinner at Jackie&#39;s house that evening. If everything went well then Ann and Jackie would hopefully not have to worry about another parents meeting for quite awhile. As Gloria now stood with Nate they anxiously looked at the teenage couple. &quot;You guys ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Felicia said. &quot;But let&#39;s get this over with.&quot; Turning towards her boyfriend she could see Adam give her a toothy smile as he squeezed her hand tightly. Gloria now made her wish making Adam and Felicia 30 years older.<br />
<br />
The changes to Adam and Felicia were astounding as they sped through their teens. Felicia curves filled out, her breasts becoming fuller while her hips expanded. By 20 the blond girl had a very pretty face with c cup breasts and gorgeous long blond hair.<br />
<br />
Adam&#39;s Changes were even more significant. The boy was quickly becoming a man. Adam&#39;s muscles thickened as his jaw began to square off. By the time he hit 20, Gloria&#39;s friends were astounded to see a very handsome college athlete in front of them.<br />
<br />
Adam and Felicia continued to mature as they sped through their 20s. Felicia&#39;s body and face matured while her hair became fuller. Felicia marveled at the woman she was becoming, gone was the timid, skinny teen replaced by a very shapely and confident looking woman. Glancing over at her boyfriend Felicia gasped at Adam&#39;s transformation.<br />
<br />
Adam was no longer a boy. The soft teenage face was now squared with a small amount of scruff on his face. Adam&#39;s muscles were thick, large and defined on his massive body. From the look of him, it appeared Adam would grow into a very large, athletic looking man. Adam noticed this as he flexed is larger biceps. &quot;Damn I look like a linebacker,&quot; he gasped, his voice now deeper and more mature.<br />
<br />
Felicia and Adam now watched as they passed into their 30s. Their faces continued to mature as the continued through adulthood. Felicia face, while still beautiful, no longer appeared so young. A woman with blond hair and a shapely figure marveled at her appearance, groaning as she noticed some small lines beginning to form around her eyes.<br />
<br />
Adam too was now a bit downtrodden. The athletic build of his 20s was slowly deteriorating as he raced through his 30s. As he approached his late 30s he could see his washboard abs now appeared flabby, a small amount of fat now covering his mid section.<br />
<br />
As the two now entered their 40s and began to complete their progression they stared at each other in wonder. Felicia now possessed some crows feet on her very beautiful and mature face while a few greys now appeared in her blond locks. Felicia&#39;s hair, while still healthy, did not seem to have the same glow as before.<br />
<br />
Adam now appeared to be leaving his athletic prime. While his muscle was still large it was losing its definition. Adam&#39;s face now appeared slightly weathered while his hair began to grey. As the progression completed the two 45 year olds gaped at one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Felicia asked tentatively. &quot;How do we look?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria smiled, nodding as she gazed at her friends. &quot;You two are definitely ready.&quot;</p>
