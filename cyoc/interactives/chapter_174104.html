<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave looks back at you sniffing around and licking your lips, acting like a cartoon character inside of your scene then looks down at the pizza. Two slices are missing now, with the second one half eaten in his hand. He studies it with his eyes and ponders for a while its shape and design, looking at the colors of the runny cheese and salted pepperoni. After a few moment&#39;s Dave looks back at you now rubbing your painted belly trying to tell him your hungry. Dave sighs again and gets up from his couch and goes to get his brushes.<br />
<br />
You hear him sigh almost frustrated and open your eyes to see him get off the couch. &quot;Hey where are you going?&quot; Your silently say to him. Dave doesn&#39;t answer you and is moving out of your vision as he walks past your canvas as you follow him with your eyes. You forget again for a moment your unable to leave the scene and bump into the edge of the canvas trying to follow him as he leaves your vision. You can hear Dave muttering to himself but his voice is too low for you to be audible. You start to call out his name but then remember he can&#39;t hear you so instead you decide to turn around and face yourself into your canvas so it completely envelops your vision so that you can see nothing but your back side and the empty painting that you are inside. <br />
<br />
You find the empty canvas you are stuck on more comforting than the real world. Being trapped inside this 2D plane has been blissful so far, with the canvas&#39;s fabric stimulating every part of your flattened body like an orgasmic afterglow you really find it difficult to want to make yourself leave your current state. As you think on it, even though you haven&#39;t eaten anything since before you left for work you don&#39;t actually feel hungry... like, at all. Come to think of it, you haven&#39;t been breathing either since you got sucked into the canvas. You then feel a large tip of someones finger tap on your butt a few times, stimulating you immediately and make you jump a bit before whirling around to see Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeepp! Don&#39;t touch me like that, that feels funny!&quot; You silently mouth to Dave as you instantly realize he&#39;s holding a paint brush in his hand. &quot;Err, what are you going to do with that, Dave?&quot; You ask puzzled and also slightly concerned.<br />
Dave then looks at the paint brush in his hand then back at you. &quot;It&#39;s my paint brush dude, and your a painting. You said you wanted me to paint you a pizza to eat, so move out of the way so I can paint a pizza into your scene for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh sweet! Do I get to pick what it&#39;s like?&quot; You excitedly say again forgetting Dave can&#39;t hear you and move over towards the edge of your scene.<br />
<br />
Dave shakes his head, &quot;Why do you keep forgetting I can&#39;t hear you? ... That has to be something caused by magic in the painting. Ok, now listen up, I&#39;ll agree to paint a pizza into your scene IF you promise to come out of the painting when your done eating. Okay?&quot;<br />
You pause briefly, before nodding your head rapidly. &quot;Ok, ok! I&#39;ll come out now, but I&#39;m goin&#39; back in here when were done. I kinda want to stay as a painting~&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave doesn&#39;t hear your words and doesn&#39;t pay attention to what your trying to say as he dabs his brush on his palette and begins to paint onto your scene. You feel a energetic wave almost ripple through you and your scene as something new is being added to your scene, the sudden inrush of exciting energy being put into your painting is stimulating your 2D body in such a strange and almost sexual way. Then Dave puts another brush stroke onto your scene and you feel the wave of energy course through it again, then again with another stroke, and again! Your face changes to one of amazement as you almost compulsively turn to look toward where the pulses are originating from and bend over to see paint being added to your scene. You watch carefully as you slowly move around the newly forming painted object as Dave paints in your pizza. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Dave&#39;s finished with the new addition to your scene. &quot;Well dude, that&#39;ll do it. You wanted me to paint a pizza into the canvas.&quot; You look back at Dave with a big smile then look at the painted pizza and as you move over to it, you close your eyes and sniff the air, letting you breathe in its &#39;scent&#39; deeply before you open your eyes and bend over to reach for the artisan food. &quot;When your done eating, hop out of there. You can tell me all about your experience being in 2D once your out of the scene and I can hear you again properly.&quot; Dave says to you as you grab a slice and pop it into your face. <br />
<br />
You shutter slightly with your whole body as a sudden huge rush of static energy hits your body from eating the painted slice of cheese. Your body was already locked into a post-orgasmic experience but for some reason eating in your scene is beyond invigorating and is kind of sexually stimulating your whole body as you eat the pizza. Strangely, it has no smell or taste to you at all but it is strangely satisfying to eat the thing inside of your painting. Your whole body feels like its vibrating slightly and almost like its electrically charged and as you finish eating, you suddenly feel a rush of relieve run throughout your body starting from your belly and radiating out of you from all directions. Now that your done with your meal, that feeling is fading quickly and Dave is still waiting for you to leave your 2D scene. While your still enjoying your experience in 2D, you do honestly need to leave this painting. At least you can tell him what it was like in there and go back in later.<br />
<br />
You start trying to move yourself towards the &#39;window&#39; in your vision but after walking towards it for some time it really doesn&#39;t seem to be getting any closer. &quot;Hey umm, Dave? I can&#39;t seem to get out of here, mind helping me?&quot;<br />
Dave calmly says &quot;Sure pal, hold on a second.&quot; as he reaches for you but both you and him are both hit with an instant sense of shock as when Dave touches you and you try to grab his hand, nothing seems to be happening! <br />
&quot;Oh... oh no... no, no, no, no no... This isn&#39;t happening right now... Come on, get out of the painting...&quot; Dave says has his voice quickly builds with a frustrating sense of worry.<br />
&quot;Dave, you said you could get me out of here... why isn&#39;t it working?!&quot; You say as you keep trying to grab his hand.<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!? It didn&#39;t do this the last time... What the fuck is wrong with the painting... Uhhhaaha, FUCK!&quot; Dave says now almost panicking.<br />
&quot;Dave... why am I not coming out of the painting?...&quot; You reply to Dave who is almost crying.<br />
Dave looks up at you, &quot;I- I don&#39;t know man... It&#39;s like there&#39;s a barrier in there preventing us from touching... Last time I reached in there to pull out something It at least felt like I was touching something but this time its like I&#39;m trying to grab something but it&#39;s like I&#39;m just touching a painting... Like you don&#39;t even feel like wet paint or anything, its like your... it&#39;s like your... just a 2D drawing... Dude... Your stuck in there... Like seriously... I don&#39;t think I can get you out of this canvas... It&#39;s like I&#39;m trying to grab at nothing!!&quot;<br />
<br />
As you and Dave keep trying to grab each other though the dimensional barrier nothing keeps happening. You can feel his hand touching your painting and your painted hand touching his but he literally can&#39;t grab you and you literally can&#39;t grab his. A level of fear begins to grip you but that worry begins to subside as you begin to feel something strange tingling inside of and all over your body and it seems to be affecting you and your painting...</p>
