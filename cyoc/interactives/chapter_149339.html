<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucas rushed out to his car, adjusting his seat to accommodate his shorter height. He didn&#39;t have long until the shops closed so he was going to have to make some quick decisions. Lighting up a cigarette for the first time since yesterday, he felt a tingle of pleasure wash over him. Smoking felt even better than normal. He hungrily smoked it down as he drove to the shopping center in record time, lighting up another after parking and getting out of the car.<br />
<br />
He stood by the entrance finishing the smoke, feeling a little awkward at being out in public with his new appearance, praying he didn&#39;t bump into anyone he knew. He got a few looks here and there, but mainly from guys. Lucas couldn&#39;t help but feel like they were checking him out. One guy in particular was smoking by the entrance too, and Lucas could have sworn from the corner of his eye that the guy was eyeing him up. Surprisingly, he kind of liked it, and even found himself thinking the guy was quite attractive.<br />
<br />
He finished his cigarette quickly and stamped it out, heading inside towards the closest clothing store. He swiftly grabbed a pair of big jogging bottoms from the men&#39;s section to hide his ass for tomorrow, then moved on to the women&#39;s section, instantly feeling out of his depth. The bras in particular were daunting. He grabbed a random A cup, and a preemptive B and C incase he grew out more. Then he moved onto underwear, randomly grabbing a selection hoping they&#39;d fit. He even found himself grabbing a couple of thongs, turned on at the thought of trying them on.<br />
For the rest, Lucas just grabbed what looked good and might fit. A couple pairs of jeans, a pair of hotpants, a selection of tops in various sizes and even a couple of dresses, then darted towards the changing room to try it all on. Surprisingly, his instinct had been spot on for most of the items. Almost too correct. The jeans and hot pants looked incredible on his new legs, the only downside being the bulge of his cock was slightly visible if you concentrated on it hard enough. The smallest cup bra fit fine, and he opted to leave it on. The tops all fit nicely too, including the dresses, although perhaps there was a little too much space in the chest for now, but he was hoping he&#39;d fill them out.<br />
<br />
The fashion show was really turning Lucas on, and he allowed his arousal to dictate the clothes he was leaving the store in. Denim hot pants and a white crop top it is. He headed to the tills to pay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have the tags for the clothes your wearing so I can scan them?&quot; The cashier asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap ye...shit&quot; Lucas&#39; voice surprised him. He sounded completely like a woman. He quickly composed himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do sorry, they&#39;re right here&quot; putting them down on the counter. His new voice was hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful, and is there anything else you&#39;d like today?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No that&#39;s everything thank you&quot; Lucas said. He paid over £100 but he felt like it was worth it. He went back out to his car and shoved the bags in his boot, then decided to go back into the center quickly to use the toilet before leaving.<br />
<br />
Without thinking about it, Lucas went into the men&#39;s loo, locking himself in a cubicle. Before he even knew what he was doing properly, his hand was on his cock, stroking with everything it had. The thought of wearing women&#39;s clothing and men checking him out was too much, he needed some release now. He tried to stifle his moans, but as he reached orgasm, he couldn&#39;t help it, letting out a muffled scream through the hand covering his mouth as he heard someone else enter the bathroom.<br />
<br />
He remained quiet for a few seconds but then there was a knock on his cubicle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is...err.. everything okay in there?&quot; Said the man from the other side of the door. It dawned on Lucas that he was in the men&#39;s toilet looking like a woman. He quickly pulled his shorts up, put down the toilet seat and flushed, opening his cubicle door. It was the guy smoking outside <br />
<br />
&quot;Yea... I&#39;m okay thanks...is this not the ladies toilet?&quot; Lucas tried to distract from the fact he was red in the face and slightly out of breath, albeit not very well.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...it&#39;s the men&#39;s...you didn&#39;t see the urinals? What were you doing in there anyway? A smirk crept across his face. Lucas knew this guy knew what he was doing in there, although he was probably expecting different genatalia. Lucas panicked. What if he told someone?<br />
<br />
Without thinking, he reached out and grabbed the guys crotch. When he didn&#39;t resist, Lucas started rubbing. The guy guided him backwards into the cubicle again, locking the door behind them. There wasn&#39;t a lot of room so Lucas was forced to sit on the toilet seat, still rubbing at the outside of the stranger&#39;s shorts. Then he found himself unzipping them and pulling out the strangers dick, stroking it like he would his own. Lucas couldn&#39;t take his eyes off it. He was stroking another man&#39;s dick. In a public toilet. And he was enjoying it.<br />
<br />
The stranger stepped closer so his cock was closer to Lucas&#39; face. He just wanted to lean forwards and taste it, so he did, sticking out his tongue and licking the tip, then sliding the end into his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm yea suck it you slut. What&#39;s your name anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas thought for a few seconds as he rolled his tongue around the end of the cock, then took his mouth away from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucy&quot; he said, before sliding his mouth back onto it, taking as much as he could.</p>
