<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fransisco sat there, unable to think of an answer. Finally he looked at the teacher and told her in what he hoped was a convincing feminine voice, &quot;No Ma'am. I was trying to figure out what X was.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teacher glared at him/her and then snapped, &quot;Well then get up there and show us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fransisco, now Joy, stood and walked toward the board. Gazing at the problem, she/he took it in and tried to remember anything she/he knew about algebraic expressions. Unfortunately Joy's life kept trying to interrupt and Fransisco could only stare at the problem. Feeling out of sorts, he/she finally raised the chalk and began to write.<br />
<br />
Hoping it was the correct answer Fransisco lay the chalk back down and turned toward the teacher, who told him/her, &quot;You may go sit back down, Ms. Rapture.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing, Fransisco walked back to his/her desk and sat down. In front of him was a notebook with the name Joy Rapture printed on the top. Picking up the pencil, he/she began to take notes. In a few minutes the bell rang and class was finished. Something, a memory, said that this was the free period and lunch would follow afterward.<br />
<br />
Collecting her/his stuff, Fransisco headed for the library, hoping to make sense of all this.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Meanwhile, Anna was beside herself trying to locate her Angelina Ballerina doll. Her mother was no help because all she could say was, &quot;Maybe you left it at the hospital. We'll call and ask them later.&quot;<br />
<br />
And her sister Amelia was no help either. Currently she was taking a shower and enjoying herself. &quot;Sure, she's a girl, but there's no reason to go over board about it,&quot; Anna thought as she started to research her room.<br />
<br />
At ten years old, and showing no sign of puberty, Anna wondered why it was so important to find the doll and whether or not she should stop playing with them. As these questions and thoughts raced through her head, she noticed the doll house. Looking at it, she couldn't help but think, &quot;Something looks off about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Down the hall, Anna could hear the bathroom door opening and then mother speaking with Amelia. Anna didn't really care about any of this as she squatted down to get a better look at the doll house. Just as she was reaching up to undo the latch that would allow the front part to swing open, a voice behind her said, &quot;Mom says you should get a nice dress on because we're going out to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Amelia left, Anna thought, &quot;Are all girl's that annoying when they start to mature? If so, may I never get my breast buds and my period.&quot; Knowing, but not caring, that Amelia still hadn't her first period, Anna turned back to the doll house and noticed that it didn't look off at all. That it looked just like any other toy was all it looked like. Shrugging, Anna stood and began to get dressed for dinner.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Mr. Mendes, who was thinking himself more and more as being Joy, wandered the library. It was your average high school library and as Joy wandered, she thought back on her life, not realizing that the memories she was remembering, where slowly replacing other memories.<br />
<br />
Her real name was Jon Lexington the Third and by state status, he was a run away kid; had been ever since he was twelve.<br />
<br />
It was the year his mother had married the dick of a Navel Officer, Horace Keller. The moment he started to beat on Jon, who was already overcome with grief about the loss of his birth father, the boy ran away from home.<br />
<br />
After that, it didn't take Jon long to figure out that Horace would only send the cops to get him. So Jon thought he needed a place to lay low. Turning in a bit of his allowance, he bought a bus ticket and traveled two states over and one state down. There, he began to wander the back streets, looking for a place to hide.<br />
<br />
It was by stroke of luck, or what he thought was luck, that he first found the school. Hoping the fence, he saw nobody there and thought that maybe it had been abandoned. No such luck there as he was right away caught by a grounds keeper, who demanded, &quot;What are you doing out here anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to come up with an answer, he was taken before the dean and when the she asked, &quot;Why were you wandering the grounds? Did you break in?&quot; Jon could only tell her in a small voice, &quot;No Ma'am I was admitted here. But they told me to wait because my suitcase was missing and there was some other problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dean looked at Jon evenly and finally said, &quot;Damn computers. Just had to go down when a new students get enrolled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jon was elated that his lie was believed, but it was all short lived when the dean pulled out some paper work and started to fill it out, all the while mumbling, &quot;We'll have to do this the old fashioned way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jon looked at the paper and saw across the top the words 'Miss. Eyers  Private School for girls'. Suddenly thinking he'd gotten himself in over his head, Jon was about to tell the truth when he realized that by tell them the truth, they would just hand him back over to his stepfather. Mind racing, he said the first name that came to mind when the dean asked for his name; Joy Rapture.<br />
<br />
When the dean asked for his parents name, he explained that he was an orphan and had none. The dean just sighed and muttered, &quot;More orphans. Great.&quot; and continued writing.<br />
<br />
After that, Jon was measured for a school uniform, was told he'd be starting Junior High classes in the fall, his classes now would be acting as placement tests and then he was shown to a girl's dorm. Everything, except two things, was easy for Jon to deal with after that.<br />
<br />
Being small for his age allowed him to pass himself as a girl and what he figured really helped was the &quot;Vitamins&quot; one girl was giving him secretly. Jon didn't know, or care, what they were. All he knew was that they made his body look and feel more feminine. The only side effect he could see was that they made him grow breasts; which at the age of sixteen, he had a B cup.<br />
<br />
His two problems came in the form of a nurse and a boyfriend his class mates set him up with when he was fourteen.<br />
<br />
The nurse, Nurse Brenda, was the head nurse and she made sure all the girls where feeling well. The only problem was that she gave physicals once a year. It took Jon a long and tiresome explanation on why he didn't want to get undressed in front of the Nurse Brenda. But in the end she was convinced and made Jon the deal that as long as he reported anything wrong, she would forgo his physical.<br />
<br />
Jon, who was starting to think of himself less and less as male, agreed and the two parted ways.<br />
<br />
The next majour problem can in the form of Frank. Seeing that Joy was never with anyone but her classmates, several girls secretly setup a date and the next time Joy had a free weekend, they introduced her to Frank. Joy, who by now had stopped thinking of herself as Jon, immediately thought Frank was cute and agreed to go out on a few dates with him.<br />
<br />
It all went well until on the fourth date, Frank wanted to step up and take their relationship to the next step. Joy didn't really want this, but at the same time she wanted to explore. It ended when she gave Frank a blow job and when she not only swallowed but also felt her own penis getting hard, that Joy was lost and Jon was back, temporary.<br />
<br />
Finishing, bothered that he liked doing that to another guy, Jon explained in a soft, feminine voice, &quot;I don't we should see each other for  a while,&quot; and had kissed Frank good night and shown herself out.<br />
<br />
That had been a little over a year ago and now wandering the library, Joy wondered if maybe she should give Frank another chance. Fransisco reasserted himself and thought, &quot;No. I need to find the book and get out of here. I can't be a guy attending a girl's school. My name is...My name...My...&quot;<br />
<br />
But suddenly Mr. Mendes couldn't think of his name. All he could think was Joy Rapture. Sitting down at a table, dropping her book bag next to her, Joy thought, &quot;For some reason, I need to find a book of transformation spells. But why?&quot;</p>
