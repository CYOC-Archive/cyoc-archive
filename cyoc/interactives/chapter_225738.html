<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">melody soon saw the sheet she pulled off of her change. the ordinary white cloth soon changed to a durable silk sheet. she got up from her bed as it made a groaning noise. the bed and frame expanded. it quickly went from a twin to a king.  <br />
<br />
the pillow soon duplicated into two deep red satin pillows. the bed frame soon shifted to mahogany. the four corners rising to just below the roof. wooden beams soon grew and connected them. The red cloth soon hung underneath with a gold pattern.  <br />
<br />
Finally, fine rope pulled the forming curtains to the posts. &quot;what the...&quot; It was like what she always imagined Prince Milo&#39;s bed would look like. she soon felt her clothes changing. shed slept in her outfit from yesterday. her pants soon became fine black cloth as durable as her new sheets.  <br />
<br />
melody&#39;s eyes began to sting. after blinking rapidly she opened them. this time the blue eyes had shifted to yellow with slit pupils. with her new eyesight she saw green magic waft off of him. &#39;is this the undead king&#39;s curse? trap me in a different world?&#39;. These thoughts came to Melody&#39;s head.  <br />
<br />
She knew from how the words echoed in her mind that this was Milo. she/he soon felt the ground beneath his feet shift. the carpet shrunk as the green mist hit it. for some reason, she smelt an odd mix of jasmine and volcanic rock. soon what remained of the carpet became 2 rugs on the floor.  <br />
<br />
the exposed wood quickly petrified into stone. lines soon broke up the stone bricks as more changes happened to Melody/Prince Milo. By now his pelvis was completely engulfed by the red scales. both melody and the voice in her head groaned her hips rearranged. her socks soon shifted to black as knee-high boots covered them.  <br />
<br />
a brown leather belt wrapped around their waist. the walls of the room began to shift to more stone bricks. a set of stands with candles on top appeared. Milo/Melody looked up just in time to see the roof turn to wooden beams. the rest of her room followed suit.  <br />
<br />
The only things that didn&#39;t change were any electronic devices. she turned around to her door. while her changes were slow her room had changed almost instantaneously. below she heard a thump causing her to fall on his rear. it was unexpected as they lived in a single-story house.  <br />
<br />
there was nothing below but a foundation, or at least there was. their body feeling unfamiliar and familiar at the same time as they got up. the scales went down their legs as they got up. Her previous height of 5&#39;4&quot; had increased to 5&#39;9&quot; and the rest of her body hadn&#39;t changed. she knew that Milo was 7&#39;2&quot;.  <br />
<br />
slowly she felt Milo&#39;s thoughts merge with hers. a sudden desire to see her family was now in her mind. if memory served her right. She made Prince Milo the heir to his kingdom after his parents were killed by the undead king. Milo also wanted to see if his band of Warriors were here.  <br />
<br />
that thud felt like Kemo when he tried to reach his full height. he hoped the girl&#39;s family... no his family was alright. their minds now once they approached the door. As he opened it he found a sight both familiar and foreign to him. he lived or now lives (&#39;man this is going to be confusing&#39; he thought) in the main place tower.  <br />
<br />
memories of this room once belonging to his parents came to him. As such a winding stairwell was before him. As he began to descend the staircase his shirt ripped in half. it soon resewed itself into his reddish-black cape. chest expanded to a lean male figure.  <br />
<br />
his bra soon grew as his breast shrunk slowly. by the time he&#39;d gotten to the bottom he now had his burgundy tunic on. it split into four pieces with yellow trimmings past where it was tucked beneath his belt. armored chest plate and shoulder pieces protected his most vital parts. this also gave him an armored collar on the sides of his neck.  <br />
<br />
he soon came to wear he heard Kemo. he wasn&#39;t sure what he was doing but it sounded familiar. opening the door he narrowly avoided a slimy projectile. pushing himself off where he dove he found himself in the kitchen. while appliances like the fridge and microwave were untouched the rest of the room had become what the Milo part of him remembered.  <br />
<br />
sitting on the floor was Kemo. he had seen Milo and was trying to cover himself up with an apron. however, it seemed the undead king&#39;s curse still held sway over his decency. soon green flames engulfed the garment. in less than ten seconds the apron was now a pile of ash on the ground.  <br />
<br />
however, Milo soon saw something that made his heart heavy. the dishes while more elegant were now broken on the floor. memories of Melody&#39;s mother Catherine doing dishes often made him realize something. if he became Milo then his mother might now be the dragon barbarian in front of him.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Catherine Mason was a mother of two. She had a wonderful husband who worked as an antique salesman. her daughter Melody had just come back from a friend&#39;s sleepover. it was clear she hadn&#39;t slept as she collapsed in her bed shortly after coming home this morning. thankfully it was the weekend so she decided to let her girl sleep in.  <br />
<br />
As she washed the dishes she smelled something. it smelled like her favorite cinnamon candle. &quot;Melody you better not be burning my candle without permission,&quot; she said before feeling lightheaded. She sat down on a chair not noticing it becoming more expensive. her right gloved hand was feeling oddly tight.  <br />
<br />
she looked in shock as claws began ripping out of it. behind the claws, her skin was soon covered in light blue scales. additionally, she noticed her pinky was missing. while she was staring at her hand her face began to change. her ears became blue and pointed.  <br />
<br />
her former earlobes moved right above her ear holes and became spikes of dragon skin. her nose began pushing out into her field of vision. As it did so a bulge bunched up against her pants. As soon as she noticed she put her changing hands to the growing muzzle. two white horns pierced through her brown hair.  <br />
<br />
a second smaller spike grew beneath her ear holes. more blue scale spikes ripped through her shoulders and elbows. a blue scaled tail with a spade tip burst from her rear. her foot ripped through her shoe revealing a dragon foot in place of her human one. She removed her hands to see what was causing pressure on her crotch.  <br />
<br />
Catherine looked down to see a large bulge tenting her pants. her clothes began ripping all over the place as her body increased. her bra became loose as his breasts became large pecs.  his cock then burst from the garment. it was strangely human for the moment.  <br />
<br />
muscles began filling out her feminine form as her height increased. the increased weight caused the now expensive chair to break causing him to fall on his now muscular ass. he would&#39;ve realized something was up with the now larger kitchen. however, the cock seemed to direct his full attention. three scaly spikes grew on his tail as his hair.  <br />
<br />
his brown hair began to shift to a deep blue as it became spiky. Kate couldn&#39;t help but eye his new manhood. at this point very little remained of his clothing. he decided to rip his pants to get a better view. As he did the scales kept covering his human skin.  <br />
<br />
light blue chutes ran down his front as his cock and new balls turned light blue as well. after seeing his growing meat rocket he tires off the rest of his pants. barely any human skin remained as his body continued to grow. he gripped his growing scrotum his hair continued to change. what hair that didn&#39;t change fell to the ground.  <br />
<br />
soon Kemo would have his signature Mohawk down his neck once again. As the last scraps of cloth and unchanged hair fell from his body so too was his old skin. his yellow eyes closed halfway in lust. he grabbed his cock as the tip became more pointed and dragon-like. smoke escaped his nostrils as his tongue slipped out of his closed maw.  <br />
<br />
two dragon wings grew from his back as he began masturbating. sadly these were more for show as his muscles and large body were too much for these. he soon cumed across the room. flames leaving his mouth as he climaxed. he eyed his erection and noted it was fifteen inches long and a foot wide.  <br />
<br />
while flaccid he knew it was still an impressive foot long and ten inches wide. he then tried to rise. he forgot he was now about a foot and a half higher than the ceiling at his full height. instead, he bashed his head against the ceiling. if he wasn&#39;t a dragon he would&#39;ve gotten a concussion.  <br />
<br />
instead, he fell back down causing some stacked dishes to fall to the stone floor. the fall also caused him to hit his gargantuan balls. they were quite sensitive as well as being just small enough for him to hold on in his hand. however, instead of pain, it caused him pleasure. he once again jacked off his dick.  <br />
<br />
even if he was human size his dick would still be the largest in the world. the undead king had cursed him with this. he also cursed him to never wear anything but a spiked collar and that was to attach his slave chain to in the mines. thankfully Milo had rescued him and the two planned to take the undead king down.  <br />
<br />
As he jacked off he smelled the scent of cooked meat as Catherine&#39;s clothes burned away. a black collar with iron spikes materialized around his neck. he couldn&#39;t help but masturbate as Milo came in. Thankfully the dragon prince&#39;s skills allowed him to avoid his cum. he at first looked relieved then horrified at his friend.  <br />
<br />
being both 18-years-old they&#39;d shared many adventures. however, Kemo was worried about his friend&#39;s current form. he had the arms and head of a 14-year-old girl. Thankfully that was slowly being fixed. he soon figured it was about his softening dick.  <br />
<br />
without thinking he grabbed an apron and tried to put it on. however green flames engulfed it like any article of clothing he had tried to wear. thankfully a naked dragon wasn&#39;t unheard of. however, he had been a beautiful woman who&#39;d cared about her looks. As such he still tried to look decent.  <br />
<br />
unbeknownst to him the hippo man watched from the window. it seemed his presence had added sexual aspects to the former girl&#39;s dreams. Kemo hunched over to grab a broom and dustpan. they looked like miniature models in his hands. he was a friend and former woman. <br />
<br />
if he can&#39;t be decent then he could act decent. he soon realized the cum dripping from the ceiling to the floor. &quot;sorry Milo. I fell and couldn&#39;t help it&quot; he apologized, though he didn&#39;t mention he&#39;d done it twice. &quot;um, Kemo?&quot; Milo asked clearly wary about something. the dragon barbarian looked at him with undivided attention.  <br />
<br />
he recognized this as his concerned voice despite its feminine tone. the red scales had now engulfed his hands once again. his fingers ended in points and black finger-less gloves covered them. a hilt carrying his dragon sword appeared under his cape. &quot;I don&#39;t know if this is true or if you remember,&quot; he said before having to stop.  <br />
<br />
his neck elongated somewhat as the red scales covered it. once his voice changed he was able to speak. &quot;sorry about that&quot; he said with the voice Kemo knew. his hair soon became its brownish red spiked Mohawk their kind had. &quot;do you remember someone named Catherine Mason or Melody Mason&quot; he said before his face pushed out.  <br />
<br />
his changes reaching the end. his nose sunk onto his muzzle as horns grew. unlike Kemo&#39;s horns which were shapely curved and vertical, his were more horizontal and slightly curved. his prince crown now between them making it look like a headband. his family&#39;s ruby broach is now attached to his cape.  <br />
<br />
however, the question he asked made Kemo think. while he did so Milo wondered about other things. if this happened to his other half&#39;s mother then what about his other friends? will his father join their new life or will he be unaffected? will he remember the old life or something new?  <br />
<br />
Will Kemo remember being Melody&#39;s mother or what happened to her if he was not her? will the undead king be in this reality too? That last one had him the most worried. he knew Melody had created the adventure as a fun game. however, he remembered the undead king as being a terrible scourge.  <br />
<br />
hopefully, since he wasn&#39;t in his dream then he hadn&#39;t come. however, his minions might. these thoughts had distracted him. he soon felt Kemo shaking him. &quot;huh?&quot; he asked the behemoth in front of him. Kemo shook his head and said &quot;I was answering your question. and the answer is...&quot;</p>
