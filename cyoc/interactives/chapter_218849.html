<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A knock on the door brought Adrian back down to reality. He was a little bit happy that he&#39;d changed himself back already. The rush was still hitting him. If he stayed that size, he probably wouldn&#39;t stop jacking off. Or maybe even making himself bigger. The thought permeated his mind. Adrian&#39;s finger hung over his profile.<br />
<br />
The knock on his door persisted. &quot;Coming!&quot; Adrian shouted. He opened his front door to see Henry. &quot;Hey--&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry pushed past him. &quot;You got any beer man?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to see you too,&quot; Adrian grumbles. Henry was already in his fridge looking for beer.<br />
<br />
Henry grumbles when he didn&#39;t find any. &quot;Dude why you gotta be straight edge. Don&#39;t you ever want to live a little?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I live fine,&quot; Adrian closed the fridge for Henry. &quot;Bad date again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;IT&#39;S NOT MY FAULT I&#39;M 5&#39;6&quot;!&quot; Henry dropped onto the couch. Adrian had heard it dozens of times before. Dating apps were the worst. And it was even worse when you lied. Henry had learned the best way to actually get dates was to up his height in his profile a little bit. When 5&#39;8&quot; and 5&#39;10&quot; weren&#39;t doing enough, he went full 6&#39;1&quot;. Instantly he was matching with dozens of women who were vapid and shallow. Of course since they cared about nothing other than his height, the moment they saw that he was as short as them, if not shorter, they would end the date right away.<br />
<br />
Adrian tried his best not to laugh. &quot;I think it makes you look cute,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Henry rolled around on the couch and put his head in a pillow. &quot;Don&#39;t remind me...&quot; he groans. He looks back up at Adrian. His eyes narrow a bit. &quot;Man I guess that straight edge shit isn&#39;t all bad... You&#39;re looking pumped!&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile erupted on Adrian&#39;s face. He always loved compliments from Henry. The short stack really was cute after all. His wide shoulders, thin waist fit perfectly in his little body. But it was also why he hated when Adrian called him cute. Not to mention that he wasn&#39;t gay like Adrian either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get the wrong idea!&quot; Henry quickly warned.<br />
<br />
Adrian rolled his eyes. &quot;I know. Your &#39;straight.&#39;&quot; He only added the quotes to piss Henry off more. Though an idea did start to hatch in his mind. There were so many options in the Chronivac, he wondered if he could try a few.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quotation marks don&#39;t make it any less true!&quot; Henry screamed into the pillow.<br />
<br />
Adrian ignored Henry&#39;s little rant. He went through the settings and found a place where he could type something in. &#39;Just for tonight, Henry doesn&#39;t think that having sex with a man would be disgusting. He feels perfectly fine objectifying another man.&#39; Adrian tried to keep it as neutral as possible. He didn&#39;t want to feel as though he forced Henry into it, only that there was actually an option. Before Adrian hit enter, he saw something about reality settings. He figured he&#39;d mess with those later.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about this?&quot; Adrian asked. &quot;You don&#39;t have sex with me tonight and I actually make you 6&#39;1&quot; like your dating app says.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you&#39;re just mocking me...&quot; Henry growls. Adrian shakes his head and accepts it as a challenge. He upped Henry&#39;s height to 6&#39;1&quot;. Instantly Henry felt it in his body. His bones started stretching and growing longer. He could feel his feet pushing over the edge of the couch. However, he still only weighs 140 pounds. &quot;Are you kidding me?!&quot; He doesn&#39;t even care about the weight. Just seeing his long stretched limbs is enough to get him worked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll even keep you proportional to your 5&#39;6&quot; you,&quot; Adrian brags. Then reverses change. Henry glares up at him. &quot;What do you say big guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t have to have sex with you? Sounds like a pretty standard night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian shrugged. &quot;Should be. Though I have been working out a lot lately.&quot; He peels off his sweaty shirt and tosses it on Henry.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s a pause between the two of us. &quot;H-hey!&quot; he shouted as he peels it off his face. Henry&#39;s eyes fell on Adrian&#39;s body. There&#39;s a moment of hesitation as he looked up and down his bodybuilder sized friend. A feeling he&#39;d never felt before between them hit him. &quot;Hey!&quot; he shouted again trying to keep his composure. &quot;I&#39;m not your damn closest!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Adrian ruffled Henry&#39;s hair before sitting down on his couch. He hands Henry a controller and turned on his Xbox. His eyes followed Adrian as he splays out on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you gotta be shirtless though?&quot; Henry asked.<br />
<br />
Adrian shruged. &quot;Why not? Never bothered you before.&quot; His attention is fully on the other man. He could almost feel as though he can see Henry&#39;s blood pressure rising. <br />
<br />
Henry&#39;s face struggled not to contort. So many emotions were wanting to erupt from him. Frustration and anger was the most obvious, but a third one he&#39;d never felt for Adrian was emerging. &quot;Fine. Whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian started the game. &quot;Winner gets to do something to loser.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude? What?&quot; Henry stammered. &quot;Are you serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure? I just want a reason to kiss you,&quot; Adrian said.<br />
<br />
Henry&#39;s player didn&#39;t move. &quot;WHAT!?&quot; Adrian gets the first kill. &quot;BRO!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro what?&quot; Adrian&#39;s already position himself for another kill, but when Henry&#39;s screen starts flashing red he tries to move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you gotta be so gay!&quot; Henry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You know I want to kiss you.&quot; With Adrian&#39;s verbal distraction, Henry loses another life. &quot;Besides, you could make me do something too. Something like make you 6&#39;1&quot;.&quot; <br />
<br />
For a second Henry&#39;s eyes lit up. He tries to put his game face on. But something about the chemistry between him and Adrian is different. He can&#39;t quite place it. His hand subconsciously massaged his crotch. He was far more focused on growing that this feeling. That&#39;s why he was turned on. Because of all the chicks he was about to get, not because of Adrian. At least that&#39;s what he told himself.<br />
<br />
The game continued and the two point lead that Adrian had only seemed to increase. Henry wasn&#39;t able to quite make it up. He could chase it down to a one point but then Adrian seemed to pop out of nowhere and kill him two more times. It didn&#39;t help that Henry&#39;s eyes kept drifting over to the muscular man on the couch. Seeing that huge body was so interesting all of a sudden. He couldn&#39;t believe that it would be wasted on someone who didn&#39;t like girls. All Adrian would have to do is be in a room, and women would flock to him.<br />
<br />
&#39;To be so lucky...&#39; Henry writhed subtly on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s game!&quot; Adrian shouts as the timer runs out. His character is on the screen with the point totals. &quot;Couldn&#39;t quite keep up could you?&quot; He taunts. His big body stands up and then moves over to Henry. He invades the little man&#39;s space, positioning him directly on top of Henry. &quot;Or did you really want a kiss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-n-no!&quot; Henry stammers out. His face is burning red at the intimacy between them. He wasn&#39;t about to admit to any gay thoughts. His hands were placed on Adrian&#39;s firm pecs. The urge to squeeze and grope the bloated muscles filled his desire. He just went stiff, trying to fight it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine...&quot; Adrian&#39;s about to stand up before feeling Henry grab him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be a sore winner,&quot; Henry blushes. &quot;I know you were going to change me if I won that game, so just do it. It&#39;s not like a kiss is sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian&#39;s smile broadened as he leaned back down and pressed his lips up against Henry&#39;s. The small man&#39;s beard tickled as it ran across his smooth face. Henry had done everything in his power to make himself look the most male so he&#39;d have some kind of edge against other men when they naturally had him on height. However, to Adrian&#39;s surprise, Henry was really getting into it. Adrian was just going to go for a kiss on the lips, but Henry&#39;s tongue with into his mouth.<br />
<br />
With that kind of invitation Adrian wasn&#39;t about to pass it up. The taste of Henry filled his mouth as their tongues intertwined. Adrian&#39;s hand kept going lower, running across the strong contours of his friend. Strange enough Henry was doing the same to him. Adrian lost himself in the moment and rounded Henry&#39;s ass. His fingers ran between Henry&#39;s buttchecks and pressed against the hole.<br />
<br />
Henry bucked. &quot;HEY!&quot; he blushed. &quot;I thought it was only a kiss!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... Sorry,&quot; Adrian was about to pull his finger back out.<br />
<br />
Henry grabbed his arm. &quot;I didn&#39;t say stop...&quot; he blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh-ho!&quot; Adrian bragged. His finger dug deeper into Henry&#39;s hole. A deep moan feel out of him as his little body squirmed. Adrian took his chance for another kiss. Henry wasn&#39;t doing as well as he had been. The distraction in his ass was more making it hard to concentrate.<br />
<br />
&quot;More...&quot; Henry whispered. He didn&#39;t even realize he&#39;d said it.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-more?&quot; Adrian didn&#39;t realize it&#39;d be going this fast. Not that he was complaining, it was just so sudden. He watched as Henry nodded. His little body gripped and groping Adrian&#39;s. He must have really been desperate for sex and now that he could have it, Henry was going to take it.<br />
<br />
Adrian flipped Henry over. He lined up his cock and pushed down into the hole, he&#39;d been making. Henry grunted. The little man&#39;s whole body flexed, squeezing whatever he could get his hands on. He let out a deep breath and Adrian continued. <br />
<br />
He laid more of his weight onto Henry&#39;s body and continued to thrust inside. Adrian kissed and nipped at Henry neck. Each thrust brought another moan out of the man. He couldn&#39;t help it. His little body flexed and begged for more. Adrian kept going. He could feel a surge rushing through him. Better with each thrust. He was so close, he could feel it. Then he did.<br />
<br />
Adrian&#39;s body went stiff as he unloaded into his friend&#39;s asshole. It felt even better than he thought it would. He rolled to the side and cradled Henry in his arms. His big arms easily wrapped around Henry&#39;s shorter frame.</p>
