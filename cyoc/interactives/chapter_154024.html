<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew started eating some of the chicken wings. &quot;Damn... This shit&#39;s really good today,&quot; he exclaims. The rest of the table just rolls their eyes as they continue eating their own food. Though he was so engulfed with his own food he didn&#39;t even notice. He finished the first chicken wing and went straight to the second. Already muscle was adding to his already developed frame. The thick but toned muscles covering his body grew just a bit more.<br />
<br />
At 220 he was already so big, so the 3 extra pounds of muscle added to his frame wasn&#39;t too noticeable. How quickly he was eating through those chicken wings it was almost like his body was pulsing. The quick tearing of the meat from the bone, then letting it drop down into his stomach. The growth was almost instantly added onto his frame. The 17 inch arms flexed and relaxed but with each time grew a fraction closer to the 20 inches he desired. His traps pushed his shirt higher. His chest pushed out further. But his abs stayed just as perfectly defined.<br />
<br />
Andrew rocked back and forth in his chair feeling the space between his legs grow a bit smaller. There seemed to be a little bit less room there. And the cheap plastic chair the school had bought was always squeezing his legs together making it squeeze against his privates. With the slight adjustment he moved onto the next dish. He looked over his fork wondering why it seemed so much smaller all of a sudden. As he held it in his hands he looked over the food transport device but couldn&#39;t help but feel like it was a bit unnecessary. He picked up the beef with his hand and slid it into his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You going wild on us?&quot; Kevin from across the table asked. He bit into his homemade PB & J. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a bit,&quot; Andrew smirked. He threw up a flex of his arm, letting the bigger bulge show off a little bit more. <br />
<br />
Kevin&#39;s mouth hung open for a second showing off the slightly chewed food. &quot;You... Are you getting bigger on us?&quot; he struggled to swallow but it eventually went down. &quot;Cause you... You look... Uhhh... You look bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think?&quot; Andrew&#39;s smile only broadened at the comment. Anytime someone said he looked bigger meant it was a good day. He could feel his dick flicker to life. Didn&#39;t matter who said it, it always felt good. But Kevin was indeed right as he mentioned it. The 220 pound bodybuilder had just gained 30 pounds of muscle from the chicken wings and then an additional 10 from the slice of beef. His stringed shirt was starting to ride up even higher from his widening chest and growing traps. The Adonis belt leading into his shorts only became more pronounced and shown.<br />
<br />
Hannah sitting next to Kevin interrupted. &quot;Yeah... You&#39;re getting really big...&quot; her eyes went wide as she traced the other man&#39;s frame. In that short time she&#39;d taken to finish the sentence he&#39;d gone and finished two more of the pieces of beef. His rounded shoulders grew wider, allowing a perfect spot in between them and his ever growing traps. His lats meanwhile were pushing a good half of foot on either side of him making the chair almost impossible to sit in. He had to lean his body forward as he was far to wide to fit in the lightly U shaped chair beneath him. Even his ass seemed to be having more trouble than usual as either side of him, the chair felt like it was jutting up into him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The new work outs must be working,&quot; he celebrated by finishing off the last piece of beef. His now 280 pound frame gained another 10 pounds. He felt so confined in his seat. The world seemed so small as he grabbed the pieces of ham and tore them up into his salad. They seemed so much smaller all of a sudden as he tore the meat apart and let the pieces mix in with the chicken, carrots, tomatoes, broccoli and cucumbers. He&#39;d always topped it off with light ranch, considering it to be his dessert. Being a bodybuilder he wasn&#39;t allowed to have too many fat calories and any other dressing would have been too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think... I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it,&quot; Kevin tried to figure out why Andrew looked so much bigger. His arms were fuller. The tight shirt he always wore was even tighter. It was always hard for him to fit in the school&#39;s chairs but this was ridiculous. &quot;I think you&#39;re getting bigger.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You already said that,&quot; Andrew laughed. His mind was too busy thinking about the salad. Even though he&#39;d already eaten so much he still felt so hungry. Thanks to all the vegetables, that usually filled him up without the same amount of fat as most of the meat. And of course the chicken breast barely had any fat on it either. The lunch lady always gave him a bit extra, because &#39;he was a growing boy.&#39; He looked down at the bowl, wondering why he got so little but ignored the thought. He started digging into the salad.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Hannah interrupted. &quot;Like right now! You&#39;re getting bigger!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha--what?&quot; he was a bit surprised by the firm way Hannah had said it. Seeing her wide eyes as she looked over his body made him look down. &quot;Holy!&quot; he pushed at the table but the table moved instead of him. Every second more and more weight was adding onto his frame. The varied amounts of meats and vegetables he&#39;d put into his salad was making him grow at an unbelievable rate. Every one of his bones stretched longer, but the definition in his frame stayed exactly the same. <br />
<br />
The shirt he was wearing stretched more and more against his growing pecs. It was the same with his flexible fabric shorts as they rode up higher from his knees but were pulling against his thighs. He looked down at the massive hulk hands and then realized his toes were sticking out of his shoes. He gave them a wiggle watching the thick digits push further and further out. His shoes couldn&#39;t contain the massive feet as the fabric around them burst out, leaving only their soles behind. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on,&quot; he looked around feeling the rest of his clothes strain more and more against his body. The same happened as they burst from him and fell around his feet. He looked around the cafeteria. Something similar was happening to several of the other students but nowhere near as pronounced. They filled out their shirts with just a little bit of extra muscle while he had grown so large he couldn&#39;t even wear any. <br />
<br />
John stared up at the giant he&#39;d accidentally created. &#39;Shit!&#39; he grabbed his phone and quickly started typing away. &#39;No one finds the growth odd. It&#39;s a once a year tradition to have growth meals and no one cares how much someone grows.&#39; He hadn&#39;t realized that because Andrew had taken so much food that he would grow into a 10 foot tall near half ton giant. Though he still had to figure something out about the clothing mishap. &#39;Andrew has a poser that he can wear.&#39; Instantly a bright blue poser appeared on the 18 year old. The &#39;small&#39; amount of fabric was still being stretched to it&#39;s limit. Andrew seemed perfectly satisfied with it as he sits back on the ground crossing his legs. Though not that he cared at all. With the amount of compliments Hanna and Kevin were giving to him about growing, that &#39;small&#39; amount of fabric wasn&#39;t going to hold for long.<br />
<br />
Obviously the cheap chairs wouldn&#39;t be able to hold his new body weight. He was still eye level with the other students and all of them acted like nothing strange had happened.</p>
