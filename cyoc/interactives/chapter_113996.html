<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You then continued waiting, practicing flying, playing with your tail, basically doing anything to pass the time. Along came another person crying for help, but this time it was a man, and for some reason he was immobilized the minute he entered your room. You immediately ran over to him, and saw that he had the bottom half of a fox, but his stomach was swollen immensely, and that area was stripped of armor.<br />
<br />
The man looked up at you,&quot;Damn it! If you&#39;re going to kill me just do it already.&quot; He said <br />
<br />
&quot;I assume that everyone is going to assume I&#39;m going to kill them now. But that isn&#39;t the case with me, I&#39;m just here to help you as much as I can. I&#39;m Ember, and uh what exactly happened to you?&quot; You said pointing at the man&#39;s swollen gut.<br />
<br />
The man sighed,&quot;I am cursed to have the lower half of an anthro vixen, and in addition to that......I&#39;m pregnant.&quot; He said embarrassed <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see if I can do anything?&quot; You said, placing the side of your head on his stomach.<br />
<br />
You noticed your hearing had increased, and you heard a heartbeat. &quot;Okay before I do anything did the pregnancy occur at the same time as the transformation, or did it happen after? I need to know just in case you may be cursed twice.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;After, the pregnancy happened a few minutes after.&quot; The man said <br />
<br />
You placed a claw on the man&#39;s stomach, but couldn&#39;t remove the curse; however you could make him human, but you saw a silver lining to this. &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say that I can&#39;t stop the pregnancy, or turn you male, because your offspring already have heartbeats, and I can&#39;t do anything about that. I can turn you human but that&#39;s about it, but I have a proposition for you that could work out in your favor.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;God what is it, please?&quot; The man said, and groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all calm down, you may be giving birth soon, and you don&#39;t want a child to get stuck part war through right?&quot; You said, and the man nodded. &quot;Anyways I could turn you completely female, and make you a complete anthropomorphic vixen. On top of that you could stay with me, and I have a friend who could possibly give you a home in the dungeon. Preferably close all things considered.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
The man paused for a second then groaned again,&quot;Fine, I can&#39;t really turn back from this so might as well embrace it.&quot; The man said <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, but first loose the armor, and all clothes. They will only get in the way of your transformation, and birthing.&quot; You said, and the man nodded, and you helped him remove every piece of clothing from his body, exposing his chest, and his womanhood, with no dick to be found.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get up, let&#39;s move to my cave it will be safer there for everyone.&quot; You said helping the half man up. The two of you slowly moved to your cave, and you sat him in your nest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright the transformation is completely painless, and shouldn&#39;t affect anything with your children.&quot; You said, and the man nodded, and you put your hand on his head.<br />
<br />
The man started growing orange fur, and the white fur from his stomach spread to his face. His arms, and torso became dainty and feminine, and you both watched as his hands became 4 digits, growing black fur, and became paws, with thumbs. Then his face pushed out into a muzzle, and his face became that of a vixen. Finally multiple sets of breasts grew down the man&#39;s, now woman&#39;s stomach giving her 8 breasts total. The breasts got small towards her stomach, and became swollen due to her pregnancy swelling up to a range of EE cup to CC cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transformation complete, you may stay as long as you like with your pups.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank....&quot;The new vixen started but screamed going into labor.<br />
<br />
You then took her hand, and put up a ward around it as protection.&quot;Go ahead I reinforced my hand just in case.&quot; You said, and the vixen looked at you, and you smiled back as she began pushing. <br />
<br />
The vixen was in labor, and gave birth for about the next hour to a litter of 8 fox pups, 5 female, and 3 male. The pups seemed attracted to their mother, and rushed towards her all hungry. You used your claws to take care of everything else, and used a to rejuvenate the vixen to full strength. &quot;It&#39;s official you&#39;re a mother now.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;This...this is...so precious, and odd.&quot; The vixen said <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll get used to your new body, I know I&#39;m still adjusting. You have it especially rough considering you have kids.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by still adjusting?&quot; The vixen said laying over for her pups to suck her teats.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll explain everything, also Anthro vixens only are supposed to have two breasts, but I added six to you so taking care of your children should be easier, feeding wise.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, it&#39;s just why are you helping me exactly?&quot; The vixen asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s what I do if someone is in need I help them, if they&#39;re cursed and need help give it. If they&#39;re nice and I like them assist them, if they are assholes who try to kill, and/or harass, or insult me, curse them, and make them plead.&quot; You said,&quot;But thankfully I haven&#39;t had to do that yet, and I only wish equal justice for myself, and them sort to speak. When I saw you, you were cursed and needed help, so as me being myself I offered you a helping claw, and you chose your path from there. The only thing I really wouldn&#39;t like is for people who get transformed by me blame me for their own faults, and as I said I wish equal justice, and if they&#39;re ones that I cursed then they get a curse that affects them more.&quot; You said, the realized you were getting a bit in depth,&quot;Sorry, did I bore you by rambling on like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, ugh,&quot; the vixen began as her children were happily feeding from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t say I know how that feels, but in a way I am patient.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, anyways I was about to say that&#39;s a fair method, and that some here just live for cursing random strangers, and killing them too. It&#39;s nice to see someone here who cares about justice, and not just chaos.&quot; The vixen said <br />
<br />
&quot;I just realized something, asside from your children you need to name yourself. You don&#39;t want to go by your old male human name right?&quot; You said <br />
<br />
The vixen paused, and then said,&quot;How about......Scarlet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually that&#39;s better then what I would have come up with. So yeah Scarlet is nice.&quot; You said,&quot;Now allow me to explain who exactly I am.&quot; You said</p>
