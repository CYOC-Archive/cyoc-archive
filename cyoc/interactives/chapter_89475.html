<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jamie went to the next closest door and paused for second. If I go into this room I&#39;ll turn into an animal again she thought. She looked back to Brad who was still frozen in stone &quot;No I have to be brave, Brad is depending on me&quot; With that Jamie entered the next room.<br />
<br />
The next room spread wide open like a field, Jamie could not see the ends of it. The floor was bright green grass the made up fields as far as the horizon, the ceiling appear to be a white/silver sky that extended far above Jamie&#39;s reach. &quot;Wow this is amazing&quot; Jamie looked around and saw near the entrance there was a table with a note/compass next to an odd backpack. Jamie read the note;<br />
<br />
350 lbs needed, head north.<br />
<br />
Jamie didn&#39;t know what to me of the &quot;350 lb&quot;  she understood head north fine. So taking the compass and backpack with her she began heading north.<br />
<br />
Jamie walked roughly 3 km before coming to an odd machine alone in the field, Jamie got closer to inspect it. On the top of it it was labeled &quot;weight station&quot; and had a big red button on it, Jamie pressed the button. The machine shot out automated arms and started filling the side bags of Jamie&#39;s backpack with weights, When it finished an auto mated voice said &quot;completed, current weight 50 lb&quot;. &quot;Well I guess that answers the 350 lb question&quot; Jamie said walking back into the field. The odd backpack was very uncomfortable and Jamie didn&#39;t look forward to taking it with her. A weird stretching sensation in her ears stopped Jamie in her track before she went any further. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah right on cue&quot; Jamie said reaching into the front pocket of her overalls for her trusty mirror, she flipped it open and took a quick look at herself. Everything appeared to be normal except for her ears which had grown into two tall points and extended several inches past the top of her head. Jamie brought her hand up to touch them and they twitched. &quot;What am I becoming?&quot; Jamie looked at her ears more &quot;a rabbit?&quot; Jamie continued walking, she knew she would find up soon enough.<br />
<br />
Another 3 km through the field Jamie reached the second weight station. With no hesitation Jamie pressed the button and the machine started to fill her backpack with another 50 lbs. Jamie noticed something off about her had when she it the button and took a quick look a it. Her finger nails had turned lack and were starting to consume her fingers. Jamie took out her make up mirror once gain and looked over her face. Her teeth had become more blockly and her nose was wide across her face. Also Jamie notice several grey hairs growing on her cheek. &quot;Heeeeehaw&quot; Jamie yelled as the weight machine finished loading her to 100 lbs. Jamie brought her hands up to her mouth in embarrassment. Jamie put them down &quot;I guess &#39;m becoming a heeeehaw donkey&quot;. Jamie pressed on.<br />
<br />
Jamie didn&#39;t get far until succumbing to the changes once again. Jamie was tired from the walking and all the weight so she decided to take a break. Jamie removed her shoes because her feet were tired and quickly learned that she no longer had feet, in the places a pair of two cloven hooves. A pulling from Jamie&#39;s behind caught her attention as she felt her tail returning. Jamie let out another heeeehaw as her overalls ripped open and tail grew from Jamie&#39;s behind again. This tail grew about a foot long and had a red tuff of hair on it matching Jamie&#39;s hair. &quot;Well it&#39;s nice to see you again Jamie joked&quot; Jamie experiment with her tail muscles and saw that she had more control over this one then the last two.<br />
<br />
Jamie continued to walk and the farther she went the more she changed. By the time she made it to the third station her body was completely covered in grey fur and her hands resembled hooves like her feet. Between the third and forth stations Jamie tumbled and fell over and discovered she couldn&#39;t get back up again. &quot;What&#39;s heeeehaw going on?&quot;  Jamie asked before it hit her, she had become quadriped. &quot;Well at least the backpack is getting easier to carry&quot; Jamie looked back and saw why the backpack looked so odd, it was really saddlebag designed for a donkey and not a human.<br />
<br />
Jamie got a few surprises when reaching the fifth a final station. First off she noticed two troughs full of food and water. Jamie&#39;s tail swayed with excitement as she helped herself, the second surprise was less pleasant. Once Jamie was finished she felt her face a neck stretch out to completion. She was now fully donkey, her red hair remained but now was a health mane down the back on her long next. Jamie looked back at her fully grown donkey body, she looked a little silly still wearing her overalls and shirt but it was to late to take them off now. &quot;Well I can&#39;t be too upset heeeehaw, I wouldn&#39;t of gotten this far with being a donkey&quot; Jamie hit the button at the last weight station and it gave her extra filling the pack to 350 lb. Jamie left and headed north to the exit.<br />
<br />
Jamie walked for another 5 km before reaching the field, once she got there she was greeted by the third key under a glass case next to pressure plate. Jamie nudged the bag off of her and onto the plate it recorded 300 lbs. &quot;No  that can&#39;t be heeeehaw&quot; Jamie was getting really tired of the brawling, she examine the scale and saw it could only go to 300 lb max. &quot;Oh no! What am I going to do? Heeeehaw, I don&#39;t want to stay a donkey forever! This is all that stupid keys fault&quot; She went up to it a kicked it with her hind legs shattering the glass. Jamie looked at what she did in shock then laughed &quot;Hahahahaheeeeeeehaw I guess I became as stubborn<br />
 as a mule too&quot; she said as she grab the last key with her mouth.<br />
<br />
A bright flash of light brought her back to the main room again and returned to normal. If anything Jamie was just happy not to brawl out everything she said. She put the third key into the base of the base of the Brad statue. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Brad I&#39;m over halfway down&quot; Jamie said as she headed to the next door.</p>
