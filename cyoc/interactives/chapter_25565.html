<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The press called it a &quot;new disease&quot; the doctors coined the term &quot;Instant Rapid Aging Syndrome&quot; which in less than a day was shortened to IRAS. It seemed to affect only girls below the age of 21, leading many to suspect that the cause was in the high school.<br />
<br />
They were right, but not in the way they thought.<br />
<br />
The doctors were reluctant to let anyone in to see them, but after a week with no new cases, they lifted the ban for friends and family only.<br />
<br />
In Amber's case, that meant little. Her mother was out of town for another two weeks, her father was listed as 'missing - whereabouts unknown', and her so-called 'friends' who clustered around the Most Popular Girl in School apparently had better thing to do than visit a decrepit old hag and diseased freak.<br />
<br />
A second week passed, and she got one visitor - a boy named Bobby. Whom she was pathetically grateful to see, even if she had no idea who he was.<br />
<br />
Bobby listened to her babbling, her weeping, and meditated on all the experimenting he had done with his magic ring in the past two weeks. He had discovered that he could control the aging effect to a fine degree - aging just as much as he wanted, and when he used the effect twice on the same target, they became younger instead of older, and he could control that, too. And he could speed up or slow down the rate of aging with a bit of concentration.<br />
<br />
Now his vengeance could really begin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what coused you to age,&quot; he said, with a big smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she asked, breathlessly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me. I did this to you girls. And I can undo it, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber looked at him in wide-eyed shock and blurted out, &quot;You're lying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby was prepared for this, and unleashed his power again. Since it was her second dose, she began getting younger. And he put his will behind it, and she got younger very quickly. And got very young.<br />
<br />
In a few seconds, the bed contained a brown-haired 8-year-old girl who was staring at herself in fascination.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can make you a baby,&quot; he said casually. &quot;Or a withered old hag. Or anything in between. I would have shared this power with you once, but you made it clear that you were too good for me, spreading your legs only for rich guys and college boys. Now you and the cheerleaders and the other girls dare not say 'boo' to me, because I'm the god who controls you all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber thought she had no tears left, but it seemed she did, because she started crying and couldn't stop.<br />
<br />
Bobby took some clothes out of his bag - he had planned for this. They were a ruffly little dress with white socks and Mary-janes. Perfect attire for a child.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get dressed,&quot; he commanded. &quot;We're leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
He had to slap her to stop her from crying, then she numbly got dressed up. They walked out of the hospital without anyone being the wiser. <br />
<br />
Getting into Bobby's car, he told Amber, &quot;We'll get the other girls later. I have to teach you that I'm your master first.&quot;<br />
<br />
They went to Amber's house, abandoned for the past two weeks. Amber got the spare key out and they went inside. Bobby took Amber up to her own bedroom - her personal place, the one place where she was always safe. Never again.<br />
<br />
Bobby knew he was becoming wicked, becoming evil. But he didn't care. He was powerful for the first time in his life, and it was good!<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you want me to change you back,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
Amber's face lit up like a shining star. For the first time since this hideous ordeal began, she had a hint of hope.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could do it,&quot; he said. &quot;With a wave of my hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; she begged, falling on her knees. &quot;I'll do anything for you, Bobby! Anything! Just change me back and I'll -&quot;<br />
<br />
He slapped her across the face. &quot;No deals, Amber. You're my bitch. I own you. I can destroy you just by thinking about it. You have nothing to offer me except yourself, while I have everything for you. I can make you young forever, Amber. Or I can make you a century-old hag dying alone in a hospital. Or I can make you a helpless baby - and keep you that way forever.&quot; (Actually, he could make her a baby but she would age normall - he just wanted to scare her.)<br />
<br />
Amber cried and gasped out, &quot;Wh-what do you want me to do, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'Sir' - I like that.&quot; He patted her on the head. &quot;Be a good girl and beg me to take you in the ass. The way you throw yourself at old rich guys to get jewels and fancy dinners.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber's eight-year-old body climbed into his lap, straddling his thighs, and her arms wrapped around his neck. &quot;P-please, sir,&quot; she whispered into his ear as her lips and tongue played on his neck, &quot;P-please fuck my ass. I'm a virgin there, sir.&quot; Her skinny hips moved back and forth. &quot;I-I need it real bad, sir. I need your cock in my ass, sir. I have some KY jelly in my nightstand. Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
He got up and carried her to her bed, then pulled out the jelly with one hand. Putting her on the bed, Amber obediently put her ankles up to her face and spread her thighs open, exposing her most intimate parts. Applying the jelly liberally to her rectum, Bobby eased himself into the girl's tight back passage. Amber's cries and thrashings made it more pleasurable.<br />
<br />
Amber cried as she was taken, moving her hips in a desperate effort to make him finish quickly. Bobby did finish, then kept his word and changed her back as he lay atop her.<br />
<br />
Amber's breasts swelled back to her C-cup size even as her growing body allowed his dick to escape her anus. In instants, she was her 18-year-old self. But she would never be the same.<br />
<br />
Bobby had used and degraded her - and before, she had done it to herself. It was like a light from heaven. She saw now that her old life was empty, a desperate effort by a shallow girl to get attention by playing the sophisticated woman, when all she was was a teenage whore who cried because she missed her mommy and never had a daddy. Even dating older men was an effort of find a new daddy.<br />
<br />
And now she had one. A powerful godlike man who could make her do anything. And who had done everything to get her - including breaking the laws of the universe. She saw now he just had to show her her rightful place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir?&quot; she asked. &quot;Are you going to keep me, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby smiled at her. He had read enough psychology to recognize Stockholm Syndrome. It was especially powerful becuase he had been a father figure to her. And he had used her so degradingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; he said, caressing her hair. &quot;You're my property. My special little treasure.&quot; He rolled off of her and pointed to his cock. &quot;Now get your sweet little mouth to work and clean me off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Amber bent over him and began sucking on his cock.</p>
