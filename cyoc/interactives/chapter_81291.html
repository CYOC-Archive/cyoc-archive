<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>I am in a morgue, looking at the constructs that I created, wondering if it were possible that they could have taken on a life beyond that 
which they were made for. Gently touching the face of the one I called Janet, feeling the equivalent of a mother’s love for the construct, I 
felt a couple tears slowly roll down my face as I silently wish that this creature could have been more than what it originally had been 
designed for.</p>
 <p>An image comes to my mind and I realize that what I was seeing was something deep within the construct and stepping back, horror 
spreading out across my face and the sadness I was feeling deepening, I understood that what I did to end this things life had been a 
good thing as it was dying anyway and would have ended up much like the first construct that I had created.</p>
 <p>Turning away, tears flowing faster, I whispered, “I’m sorry,” as I think about the two that had brought me to this moment in time.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>I woke up with tears streaming down my cheeks. I brought my knees up and laying my head on them I began to sob uncontrollably. I 
had loved Janet but I was too scared to tell her. And now I knew that Beth had loved her too only in a motherly way. And now I knew that 
Janet had been dying before the accident. How long had she been dying? How long ago was she even created? What if I had wished for 
Janet and her family to be alive? Would they have moved beyond being golems and become real? I felt someone sit on the cot and hug 
me. I was glad for the small comfort but it wasn't the same as when my mommy had comforted me. Thinking about that I look up into 
Beth's face to see tears coming down her cheeks too. After a moment I said, "I need to go home Beth."</p>
<p>"I know but you know that it will be dangerous," Beth said with a slight smile. "The nexus is one place where you are relatively safe 
from the Quondams and Isis and Inari. Already one has been removed from the prophecy though hopefully it's only temporary".</p>
<p>"But how do we know that the prophecy includes me?" I asked having my doubts.</p>
<p>"We don't know if you are or aren't included in the prophecy but that doesn't matter," Beth said with a little sigh. She paused for a 
moment before continuing with, "What matters is that Isis and Inari believe that you <b>are</b> part of the prophecy. Why else would they 
attempt to erase you completely from existence?"</p>
<p>"Well if I remember right they said they couldn't use me as the puppet they wanted," I said thinking back on the blurred memory. I still 
remembered some of the things before I became Ariel but they were like a dream and it was easy to forget that I had another life.</p>
<p>Beth nodded and said, "If you are part of the prophecy then of course they wouldn't be able to use you as a puppet. If they couldn't 
use you as a puppet then you might have thrown a monkey wrench into their plans. Which you managed to do when you were able to 
keep a part of yourself from being erased from creation."</p>
<p>"What are their plans?" I asked thinking that I should already know.</p>
<p>"Why to be masters over everything including the world you originally came from which they haven't been able to access yet 
thankfully," Beth said sounding relieved at the end.</p>
<p>"But they do have access to it because the Quondams are there," I said a bit confused. "How can there be Quondams there and Isis 
and Inari not have access to it?"</p>
<p>"That's a good question with a simple answer," Beth said almost laughing. The answer is that you weren't in the word slinger world but 
one close to it. Isis and Inari did draw some individuals from there and they think that it's the word slinger world since it's so close."</p>
<p>"They drew people from another world?" I asked tilting my head a little.</p>
<p>"Oh that's right," Beth said looking like she was about to hit herself, "you weren't there when they told James that. Well there were a lot 
of people that were drawn from the word slinger world into this one though Isis and Inari did not drawn any of them since they don't have 
access to that world yet. Before you ask we don't yet know who or what brought you here. Anyway Isis and Inari drew some people from a 
world they thought was the word slinger world."</p>
<p>"So how do I get back to that world?" I asked thinking that I would eventually have to go back there. I hated that thought since it would 
mean going back as a male and I didn't want that.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure how you would go back but a way may present itself in time," Beth said looking a little grim. "However since you were 
erased from existence you don't exist there anymore. If you go back there you won't have any history and you'll basically live on the fringe 
of society like a homeless person. Of course it will be your choice whether you go to the word slinger world or stay where you are now. I'm 
telling you this now since we have no idea when the opportunity to go to the word slinger world will present itself."</p>
<p>I really didn't have to think it over much to make my decision. "I'm going to stay," I told Beth smiling a bit. "I don't want to live like that 
and I don't really remember my life from that world. What I do remember is that I had a family but I don't remember anything about them. I 
don't remember their names or what they look like or how big my family was. I guess it wouldn't matter if I did since that life doesn't exist 
anymore."</p>
<p>Beth smiled and said, "I wish it were different but you're right about that. Now try to go back to sleep and we'll see if you can go back 
to your home in the morning."</p>
<p>I laid back down on the cot sure that I wouldn't be able to get back to sleep but the sandman quickly found me and I was in the land of 
nod before I could think about Janet again.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>"Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?" Beth asked me for the hundredth time.</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes and said, "I'm sure about that. Besides you said you were afraid someone might recognize you and call the police. 
Also I'm a shifter so I can take care of myself."</p>
<p>"Alright but I am worried about you anyway," Beth said sounding like Mommy. "Just be careful and make sure you remember the story 
about how you disappeared and are now back."</p>
<p>"I will," I said waving to Beth as I walked out of the tent. Stopping I pressed the gem in my necklace and watched the tent fade away. 
Once the tent was gone I started heading through the woods back to my house going over the story in my mind again. I had already told 
my mommy about the kind of invisible creatures so I would tell her the truth that they took me. The part that would be made up was that 
Beth had saved me from them and she told me to go home but to be careful if I saw anymore of them.</p>
<p>The trip through the woods was uneventful which was a good thing since I had to walk through it with my funeral clothes which I had 
been wearing when I was pulled into the nexus. As I walked I kind of focused on the feeling of the dress swishing about my legs. I had 
always liked that sensation so I would wear dresses and skirts almost all the time. Of course during the winter months it was warmer 
wearing pants. As I came out of the woods and started walking down the streets I could tell that people were staring at me. I knew that I 
looked odd and out of place with the way I was dressed but I couldn't quite help it. I suppose I could have exited the nexus at a point 
closer to home but something about that idea just felt off a little bit. I decided to not pay much attention to those people and worry about 
how I was going to get out of the house alone when I needed to. Mommy sure wasn't going to leave me alone for a long time. She must be 
worried sick if not grief stricken. I wondered what Mommy had told the police when I disappeared. Maybe she said that I had run away 
because I was so upset over Janet's death. That would be believable right? It's more believable than me being captured by invisible 
creatures. I'm not even sure if Mommy had believed me when I told her what I saw the other day. Suddenly I felt like someone was 
following me but when I quickly turned around there was no one there. I turned back around figuring that it might be Beth following me in 
the nexus. I smiled because she could come with me without coming with me. I didn't know how she would be able to get to me if I should 
get into trouble but I figured she had a plan.</p>
<p>When I turned the corner onto my street I was shocked to see that my house had burned down. I started running down the street 
wondering what had happened. I was thinking about asking Mrs. Pennyforth what happened but as I came closer to the house a police 
officer pulled up. As she got out I asked, "What happened to my house? Is my family alright?"</p>
<p>If I hadn't of been so distraught over the possibility of my family being hurt or worse I would of realized that the officer that the officer 
was being very cautious. "Stay where you are and put your hands above your head," she commanded and I saw her hand near her stun 
gun.</p>
<p>I decided that the best thing to do would be to do as she says. After all you don't argue with police if you're a law abiding citizen. That's 
what Mommy told me anyway. As soon as I complied I asked, "What's going on here?"</p>
<p>The officer didn't answer my question instead commanding, "Now put your hands on your head, turn around, and walk backwards to 
me." I did as ordered and as soon as I was near her she grabbed my left arm and quickly brought it down behind my back. I felt cold metal 
encircle my wrist and heard the clicks of the handcuffs. Then just as quickly she did the same with my right arm. As I was standing there 
shocked at what was happening she said, "Ariel Moon, you are under arrest for arson and attempted murder." As she patted me down she 
read me my Miranda Rights. When she asked if I understood I of course said that I did. She put me in the car and as I sat there I had to 
wonder what was going on here.</p></p>
