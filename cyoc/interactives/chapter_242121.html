<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You have always acknowledged that you find bearish and beefy men more appealing, but there was something about being a twunk that allured you. Perhaps it was due to your recent arousal in his body or the boosted self-esteem you gained despite being just as non-threatening and smooth-textured. Either way, you felt that you hadn’t received the whole experience just yet. Closing your eyes and recalling all those prior sensations in Evan’s body, you pray that this attempt would work.<br />
<br />
When you opened your eyes, you saw that...you were still in a bathroom. However, you quickly realized that it wasn&#39;t the one you were in before. It smelled..more fragrant, as if it had just been mopped. The wet floor beneath your feet instantly confirm your suspicions. You looked down at yourself to see that you were adorned in the same blue blazer you were in before, along with those noticeable pectorals protruding from your chest. Your body was slightly bent down towards a toilet as you saw your right hand holding a wad of toilet paper. Looking further down, you discovered that your lower half was partially undressed, your pants and underwear pulled down to your knees. You also noticed a significant wet spot in the blue boxer briefs below. You blushed as you realized that you probably went in Evan’s body just as he was cleaning up. To distract yourself from further embarrassment (and guilt), you decide to focus on your cock now that it was out in the open. Despite what you had previously assumed, it was actually pretty decent. Your member was cut, about 6 inches flaccid, and moderately thick. An average pair of balls hung below your dick; they swayed slightly as you bent forward to take a look at your pubic region. Unsurprisingly, you were completely smooth. It seemed that Evan shaved there regularly although you doubt he had much pubes to begin with given his lackluster amount of body hair. Dabbing the last bit of piss drops dripping from your penis, you threw the toilet paper in the toilet bowl when you were done. Your cock felt very eager, but you resisted the urge to play with it at the moment, remembering your past mistake. In an effort to divert your attention, you pulled up the boxer briefs, noticing that they were soaked quite a bit. Despite the unsavory nature, the cool, wet touch felt great against your nether regions. &quot;No, I can&#39;t get distracted now. Stay strong, Mark. Remember, you wanted to look at the aspects of a mature life,&quot; you thought as you quickly pulled up your pants. Unfortunately, they had a wet stain in the crotch area. However, it wasn’t very big; it seems that your underwear had absorbed most of the piss. Deciding to move on, you tucked your shirt in before buckling the belt around your waist.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the stall, you saw your new appearance for the first time in a mirror. Provided, it wasn&#39;t your first time seeing Evan, but you stood astounded nonetheless, knowing that this was now your appearance. Your blonde hair was brushed neatly, your attentive eyes presented a hazel flare, and your face retained a familiar but professional smooth texture. All in all, you looked rather grown up if you had to say so for yourself. Your current body was somewhat similar to your own body, but there were clear differences. The biggest one being that you actually had some muscle definition, especially on your pecs. You notice in the mirror that your pectorals press against your shirt, which makes you instantly want to grope them. You take a deep breath and try to control yourself. Despite inhabiting Evan’s body a second time, you still couldn&#39;t believe you had his form. You take a quick second to contort Evan’s expressions under your command, from a cheeky smile to a sad frown and even a silly face. It was unreal. This was the same smooth and soft texture that you had before, and yet you felt less ashamed and more comfortable about it.<br />
<br />
A male student entered the restroom, and judging by his looks, he was most likely a freshman. Realizing it wasn&#39;t someone you know, you quickly washed your hands. As you headed out, you thought you heard the boy whisper if you had an accident, realizing that he was probably referring to the wet stain in the front of your pants. As much as you wanted to deny it vocally, you didn’t. You knew that it would be more mature to just ignore it at the moment, and since you were trying to act more like an adult, that’s what you did.<br />
<br />
Looking around the empty hallway to understand your location, you then turned toward Evan’s classroom. When you entered, you breathed a sigh of relief that the room was vacant of any students, meaning you didn&#39;t have to deal with any issues or potential embarrassments at the moment. You close the door behind you and walk over to Evan’s desk where you notice a small stain lying in his chair. You had a good hunch of what it was and instantly grab some tissues out of the tissue box on the desk. Just as you’re about to start wiping it away, you heard the classroom door open, and you saw one of your previous teachers, Mrs. Jones, enter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan, how has your first month as a teacher been so far?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Jumping in surprise, you quickly turned around to block her view of the swivel chair and hide your crotch behind your desk before replying hastily, &quot;Yeah. It&#39;s going fine so far. The students are very diligent in their work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great to hear! Honestly, I&#39;m glad that you’re more comfortable now. You looked very nervous when you first joined the staff. In fact, I was actually surprised that you never asked a single person in the faculty for help during your first month.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, I see that Evan takes his job with a lot of pride,&quot; you thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it was hard at first, but I was certain that I could handle it myself,&quot; you responded with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great! I&#39;m sure you’ll do just fine with the parent-teacher conferences next week! I have to head back now to wrap up some grading for today. Talk to you later!&quot; Mrs. Jones said as she waved goodbye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, see you!&quot;<br />
<br />
You wait until she’s long gone before you let out a sigh of relief; you had just successfully carried out an entire conversation with Mrs. Jones. She was your English teacher your sophomore year, and while you heard that she was a kind old lady at heart, she tended to be quite strict in class. You remembered a lot of students, including yourself, having a lot of difficulty with her assignments. This was only made worse from the fact that she reprimanded anyone whenever they failed an assignment. Recalling all this, it was no surprise that you became really apprehensive when talking to her just now. However, just as the rumors had said, Mrs. Jones was a caring person at heart. It was safe to assume that Mrs. Jones often displayed most of her kindness towards other faculty members rather than her students. You suppose that this was one of the many perks of being an educator: getting to know your fellow teachers better and seeing their other sides.<br />
<br />
After wiping up the stain on the chair and throwing away the used tissues, you packed Evan’s stuff into his bag so that you can head back to his office. You figured that he was done for the day (After all, he spent most of the time in class grading). As you walk through the halls, you make sure to hold the messenger bag in front of your crotch so that it can hide the stain caused earlier from your accident. Returning to the teachers’ office, you greeted the few teachers working at their desks, making sure you kept Evan’s bag firmly in place. Finally reaching his desk, you search for any spare clothes around his belongings, as the wetness was getting somewhat distracting for you, especially when you sit down.</p>
