<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While you sat looking at your abnormal new foot under the illuminating street lamp, a cold chill washed over you making you jump at attention on your two different feet. You stood watching the darkness all around you trying to see if any of those monsters had checked back with you. You now had a foot that you could run with even though it didn&#39;t currently match your other one. Your body badly wanted to move just by how your heart was reacting feeling it want to pop out of your chest. Why would you even need to stay here, you look like a freak already and you of course didn&#39;t want to change anything else now would you? After seeing the one latex monster turn the poor man into another like-minded latex monster like him, you didn&#39;t want to end up in with that same aweful fate. However you couldn&#39;t get that puddle out of your mind. Just looking at your hand and foot, you should be more freaked out over this unnatural disfigurement, but you weren&#39;t at all. In fact just thinking of putting more of yourself in there made you more curious to what a full body transformation would be like. Was your mind now being complacent making you feel okay with all of this, like what you saw earlier? You didn&#39;t think differently, but this was not normal and even though you knew it wasn&#39;t normal why could you not stop thinking about the pink puddle before you. Your paws you admit were pretty damn cute too, perhaps you could spread that cuteness with the latex puddle. It seemed clear enough you couldn&#39;t shake the feeling of this thing, and you wanted to do more with it.<br />
<br />
You momentarily see a light reflect back in the distance seeing the surface of whatever it was to be smooth and shiny. It had to be 50 yards away, and you are not even certain of what it was. Studying the thing, you couldn&#39;t even make out if it was humanoid. Shortness of breath started to make you breathe quicker causing more noise to come from you. You put your hands over your mouth, or so you&#39;d call your paw and hand, to help release less noise. Your mouth dry and sweat started to collect down your neck even though the air was nice and cool. That didn&#39;t stop your face from feeling like it could explode at any time. This whole situation was entirely unreal, something straight out of a dream, no a nightmare. Of course all you wanted was to wake up from this and see yourself back to normal, be safe in your room knowing nothing could hurt you there. This felt more real than a dream to you now. You never even believed monsters to exist since you were 7. You didn&#39;t even believe that this would happen to you at any point in your life, but here you were possibly being watched by a monster. Feeling exposed especially right under a street lamp that spotlighted you to any creature that as lurking in the dark. You realized you needed to make a run for it when ever you could even if there was nothing watching you. Still frozen not having any way to get yourself to begin running, you mentally counted down from 10. When you reached 4, you realized that the shiny thing in the distance was actually not there giving you enough motivation to start moving.<br />
<br />
Looking back seeing if anything was chasing you while you ran was something you were more focused on than in front of you. You went forward for only two steps when everything began to turn 90 degrees counter clockwise. Things moved fast when this happened, but your body&#39;s reactions served a quicker response than when your mind could comprehend what even happened. Your two hands waved frantically in front of you hoping that one of them could catch yourself during the fall. Because of your foot paw being backwards and not being able to support your weight while sprinting, your whole body flung into the air with your head looking like it would be the first to make contact. Thankfully, your attempt to brace yourself was thanks to your human hand which, was the first of your body to touch the ground, was able to stop your head from hitting the concrete. What followed pursuit was more messy. Your forehead hit the pavement, albeit with less velocity, it didn&#39;t stop the ground from scratching and smashing against the rough sidewalk. The rest of your body landed all together right on top of your normal hand.<br />
<br />
You screech out in pain while you try to pick yourself off the ground. This proved hard when you felt an enormous amount of pain in your wrist. Bringing it up to your face you saw it looked pretty lopsided making you cry out again in pain. The monster wasn&#39;t even in your thoughts while this was happening, you even forgot what you were running from in the first place. It wouldn&#39;t take a genius to tell you that you had broken your wrist. To this point in life, you had never broken or factured any bone in your body. Something you seemed proud of, but in this moment you looked at your hand which caused you lots of pain when ever you moved it. Like you thought earlier, you didn&#39;t even plan on visiting your doctor at this hour, especially with this weird paw things. You don&#39;t even know the first thing to do in an emergency like this. You didn&#39;t have much strength to even to call an ambulance, which would prove difficult with your only way to call was with your other hand and it wasn&#39;t really a hand. With very few options and being dealt with some frustratingly large amount of pain, you needed to desperately diminish the pain fast. Your head turned naturally to the puddle again wondering if this was enough to help your wrist return normal in a matter of speaking. It was the puddle that seemed to beckon for you to return to it again. You wanted to stop playing mind games with yourself and go home to deal with whatever the consequences maybe later. On the other hand there was a more calming effect taking over you as you tried to process if this would actually help you out. Thinking about putting your other hand in the puddle made you want to do it with your other foot as well. Might as well complete the set right? You wondered if you were actually thinking rationally about doing it again once more. This couldn&#39;t what you wanted could it? Well you didn&#39;t need to change your whole body, just the parts that mattered right now. You began to see yourself hopefully coming back whenever you needed to and hopefully the puddle would still be there waiting for you to return. To which you simply got up and headed towards the puddle again. <br />
<br />
Your bare foot paw actually felt great on the cold concrete beneath you, so it would be interesting for your other foot to feel it as well. Not even caring about a monster to pop out, you did not care to check if that was the case. Perhaps they were watching you in the distance, watching actually coming to terms with the latex puddle. You sat down and began to take off your shoe and sock, then threw them in the puddle as well not really needing them after this was completed. You realized that your right side was not converted to latex yet which you could easily do both at once. You laid on the ground next to the puddle, seeing that you forgot your wrist was broken. It felt less painful for some reason, though at least you couldn&#39;t complain. The finger tips started to touch the smooth puddle until your entire hand descended wrist deep into the pink latex puddle. You did the same to your foot as you got situated so both parts were perfectly level. Being more submissive this time, the latex was even more slippery and liquidy. You ran your fingers through the liquid goo which felt oddly pleasing to touch. You closed your eyes and began to wonder diving into it having it restructure your body into some sentient latex animal creature. Your foot was also circling around now beginning to feel just like your other foot. You pulled them both out at once and laid on your back to see the ooze start to drip down revealing another hind paw for a hand and another fore paw for a foot. You wiggled your feet as they formed fists and flexing them and feeling the squeaky toes rub against each other. Your hands you began to rub creating more squeaky noises making them tickle a bit. You found your new hands to be more sensitive than your feet making you actually think they got flipped somehow. Even though it was completely weird the first time it had happened you now began to ask why this could be.<br />
<br />
Why were these parts in particular back wards, but not even just that, they were upside down to how your body is. The other guy that got turned, he didn&#39;t seem to have that happen. Why you? If you assumed others might be infected would they be the same as you? Was this latex thing actually evil? Better yet, what did this mean to the rest of your body? If you did the math, your legs would be arms and vice versa, your butt would be the head and vice versa. Wait, was this what you where becoming? Some kind of upside down rubber animal? You were fine though, not horrified, not shocked, not disgusted, just more curious than before. Realizing this made you feel a little hard just somehow picturing yourself underneath a tail, while your butt was the more important feature of you. There were so many questions that you wanted answers to, and you could not wait to discover them with this body-changing goop.</p>
