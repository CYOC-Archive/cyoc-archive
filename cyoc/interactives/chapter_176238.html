<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay decided to take Emma up on her offer. He’d cummed several times today, but even then, he was still feeling plenty horny enough. Was it this body, or were these situations just arousing him that much.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, we can fuck.” he answered.<br />
<br />
Emma smiled. She leaned over to his seat and tugged on his arm.<br />
<br />
“Of course we’d have to drive back first. There’s people here.” He gestured at the various passersby outside the car.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Of course. Not here.” Emma leaned back in her seat.<br />
<br />
Jay began driving back. Suddenly he realized there was something he wanted for the party.<br />
<br />
“How about we go to your place?” he asked Emma. “I want to borrow some makeup. Maybe you could help me put it on?”<br />
<br />
“I guess.” she sighed.<br />
<br />
They soon arrived at Emma’s. They each carried their respective shopping bags in. As they entered there was a little surprise. They heard someone around the corner, rummaging in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Maria’s here.” Emma whispered, referring to her roommate.<br />
<br />
Jay had met Maria a few times before, a dark haired girl, short and curvy. She was Emma’s best friend. Of the two friends, Maria was the more responsible one. Emma would probably attend half the classes she did if Maria wasn’t around to push her.<br />
<br />
“Emma, is that you?” Maria yelled out.<br />
<br />
“Yes!” she nervously yelled back.<br />
<br />
Maria turned the corner, spotting both Emma and Jay.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Haven’t seen you before! I’m Maria.”<br />
<br />
Emma hurriedly did an introduction. “ThishereismyfriendJaya!” She said while pointing at Jay. She then turned around to Jay and pointed at Maria. “ThishereismyroommateMaria!”<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you!” Maria smiled. “Jaya was it?”<br />
<br />
Jay was about to answer, but Emma quickly cut him off. “We’ll speak later Maria.” she grabbed Jay’s hand and led him to her room. She then closed the door securely shut. Emma sat down on her bed. She did a frustrated exhale.<br />
<br />
“Like, I thought Maria would be out all day.” Emma explained. “That’s what she told me this morning.”<br />
<br />
“Relax. It’s no big deal.” Jay comforted her. He sat down next to her and placed an arm around her shoulder. “This isn’t much different from when we went outside just now.<br />
<br />
“Maybe, but I didn’t know those people. I can’t lie to Maria.”<br />
<br />
“You had no trouble with Terry.”<br />
<br />
“Well! I don’t know know him. Maria is my bestie. It’s way different. I share everything with her. Not that I’d share this. This is our secret, but I don’t like lying to her face. Not at all!” Emma paused. She leant on Jay. “Also, now, we can’t really fuck.” she murmured. “Not with her around.<br />
<br />
“Why not?” he playfully pushed her down.<br />
<br />
“Stop! What if she hears mmmph-” She was interrupted by Jay’s lips. She immediately calmed down. <br />
<br />
They made out. Jay enjoyed how their bodies were pressing against each other, their boobs smooched together. He rubbed his body up and down. It felt good. Also a little uncomfortable. The bra was digging into his skin. He sat up and began fiddling with the clasp. Emma reached around his back and helped him. They got it off. That felt good.<br />
 <br />
They continued making out, though Jay remembered they didn’t have too much time. He was quick to undress, pulling his jeans and boxers down, throwing the athletic supporter aside. She also seemed ready. He entered and began thrusting. Soon, she screamed. He quickly reached his hand out and covered her mouth, muffling some of her noise, while also continuing thrusting.<br />
<br />
He came. Again he experienced one of those wondrous orgasms that came with this body, all of him shuddering.<br />
<br />
Now he had to hurry up and get ready for the party. First, He needed a shower.<br />
<br />
“I’ll go and borrow your shower.” he told Emma.<br />
<br />
“Okay.” she panted, her face flushed.<br />
<br />
Jay opened the bedroom door and checked if the coast was clear. Maria wasn’t there. He couldn’t hear her either. Had she left?<br />
<br />
Jay entered the bathroom and went into the shower. He enjoyed the water across his muscular body. He thought back to the sex. It felt good even if it was a little rushed. Though, if there was one place where it was slightly lacking was Emma’s initiative, not that she wasn’t eager to please or active, but she didn’t exactly lust over his new feminine features. Back when he went outside, plenty of eyes were drawn to him. It made him fantasize a little. How would they treat him during sex? Would they be able to keep their hands away from him? How about Terry? Again he was a little stiff. He was amazed at how quick he was recovering, not taking much note of what he’d just imagined.<br />
<br />
He exited the shower and grabbed a towel to dry himself off. He tied the towel around his torso. He made sure his masculine part was covered lest Maria return to to see a girl with a penis.<br />
<br />
He came back into Emma’s room. She was still laying on her bed. She laid completely still, staring up into the roof.<br />
<br />
“The shower is ready. You should hurry up. We’re a little short on time.” he told her.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah.” Emma stood up and left her room.<br />
<br />
Jay picked up his shopping bag and began to get dressed. He slipped the skirt on. It was short, showing plenty of his muscular thighs, but it was just long enough to hide his masculine part. For safety’s sake, he continued to use the athletic supporter. A boner might still cause a tent if not. He’d also bought a new bra, so that he didn’t have to borrow Emma’s. He put it on, struggling a little less with the clasp this time. It nicely pushed his breasts together, creating some cleavage he was very pleased with. Then there was the blouse. He pulled it on. He enjoyed its thin fabric, and also how much it showed off his chest. He posed in the mirror. He had already seen how he looked in the changing room, but he enjoyed seeing it again. He imagined how much attention he would attract and got a little excited.<br />
<br />
Emma was still showering. Jay had hoped she could help him with makeup. He looked at the time. 15 minutes left. Time might be running a little short.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the door opened and Maria returned holding grocery bags.<br />
<br />
“Hey again.” she chirped.<br />
<br />
“Hey.” he greeted back.<br />
<br />
“Do you want to stay for dinner?” Maria offered. “I was just about to start.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks for the offer, but we’re heading out to a party soon.”<br />
<br />
“Oh. I see. I notice you’ve dressed up. You look super cute.” Maria approved.<br />
<br />
“Thanks.”<br />
<br />
“Was there any particular reason you came by here?” she asked, seeming genuinely curious.<br />
<br />
“I’d hoped that Emma could help me with makeup.” Jay explained, basically telling the truth.. “I’m not good with makeup and hoped she could help me. It might not happen now, since we’re a little short on time.”<br />
<br />
“Let me help!” Maria lit up. “I’ll do it! I’m good! I promise!”<br />
<br />
“Sure.” he agreed, happy to hear he was getting his wish after all.<br />
<br />
“Come!” He followed the shorter girl into her room. “Sit here!” She led him to a vanity table. “So I assume you usually don’t wear that much makeup? Do you want more subtle makeup? I can go light if you want to! Also, I can go like full out!”<br />
<br />
“I want the full look.”<br />
<br />
“Okay!” Maria began her work, starting with applying foundation. “Your skin is so smooth” she complimented.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Emma was finishing her shower. She was still dwelling on all of this. She was a little less worried now. When she and Jay were one on one, she felt like he was still his usual self even if he looked a little different. But still, she couldn’t shake off how different his act was back then. Though he’d assured her it was just that, an act.<br />
<br />
Emma felt a little mentally drained. She wasn’t exactly in the partying mood. Though, she couldn’t let him go there alone. She had to stay by his side and make sure it all went alright.<br />
<br />
Absentmindedly Emma walked out wearing a towel. She sounds from Maria’s room. She looked inside. Maria and another girl were there. Wait, did Maria also have a guest? She did a double take. It was Jay. Emma continued to stare. Jay was made up. He looked pretty. A little too pretty for Emma’s taste.<br />
<br />
“Emma!” Jay noticed her. “Hurry up and get ready! It has already started.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, Okay.” Emma replied and hurried back to her room.<br />
<br />
“So…” Maria shuffled closely up to Jay. “You and Emma, are the two of you... close?”</p>
