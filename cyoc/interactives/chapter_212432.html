<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate can&#39;t make up his mind. He both wants and doesn&#39;t want to become a pirate. It feels good to just give in and be free, follow his new father and lead the men on the ship. But the more he does this, the more he&#39;ll change, and it&#39;s starting to get hard to remember his past.<br />
<br />
&#39;When&#39;d I go aboard again...&#39;<br />
<br />
His mind draws a blank, a hole forming in his memory. The harder he tries to remember, the more he forgets. Him being captured by these brigands, his muscle being stolen, his first day of forced work on the ship. All just a blur, the only spots clear being his jolly time spent with captain and crew.<br />
<br />
Still though, it feels wrong, and he&#39;s definetly not a pirate... right? Maybe just doing his daily duties will clear things. After all, if it does feel good doing piracy, then maybe he was a pirate all along...<br />
<br />
Nate leaves the room and makes his way up the ship. The hot sun and clear sky greeting him alongside the first mate who was waiting with arms crossed. Nate glad to see that the first mate still wears nothing under his vest, and is commando under his torn shorts. Just like Nate, and just like Nate&#39;s father. It feels right after all, showing your strong self off to the rest of the crew. Nate reaffirming that this is how he usually dresses, and crossing his arms to mimic the first mates expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s pops got us doin&#39; today?&quot; Nate asks, confident in any task his father sets. &quot;A raid. Merchant ship, easy target. Ye need me t&#39; go over the plan?&quot; The first mate starts to smirk, already knowing the answer. After all, both men have done this a dozen times. &quot;Keep yer plans to yerself. I&#39;ll be charging in!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two step away to get the ship ready for the attack. Nate ordering around the crew, to load up cannons and prepare the harpoons. The changing man keeping each individual crewmates strengths and weaknesses in mind as he barks out orders. Too busy with his commands to question his changing nature. Holes in his mind filling itself with a new past. How he came to the ship after stealing from his parents, and how the captain graciously made him into his son. How he has gone over this routine countless times. The crew not daring to question the captain&#39;s own blood, and Nate having seen a fair few of them transform into pirates over the years. But still, something is wrong, something doesn&#39;t fit. Some self doubt about his origins remaining deep inside, worry and fear that he ignores as the lookout calls from above.<br />
<br />
&quot;Target ahoy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nates mind focuses on the mission at hand. Moving with a sudden swiftness as he grabs a longsword and waits at the top of the deck. Watching and waiting until the ships are close, then ordering to fire. Harpoons piercing the other vessel, pulling it closer as the brigands leap from their boat and onto the other. Relentlessly descending upon the unprepared merchants. <br />
<br />
&#39;Capture, not kill.&#39; <br />
<br />
The order that is ingrained in every pirate of this crew reverberating in the back of their minds. Any man that gets a taste of what these blackguards have to offer will give into lust, and be a useful pirate in the near future. <br />
<br />
As Nate lands on the vessel, a guard rushes to him with blade drawn. But Nate is the taller and stronger man, deflecting the blow, and grabbing the attacker by the top of his head. Giving a toothy grin, before stuffing him under his underarm and turning to another opponent. Nate&#39;s muscles starting to strain and grow as his body remembers the many years of these raids. Physique catching up with the memory, biceps enlarging and pit hairs growing further out. The remaining strands of hair going from their original colour, to the captain&#39;s red. Completely changed now, as he goes from natural muscle to a man who has had a few months working out. The guard stuffed under them already lost to lust as his muffled moans are heard from under the armpit. Going from fighting to submitting to the dominant pirate that has clearly bested him. Digging his nose even deeper against Nate&#39;s pits, reveling in the stink and sweat, the smell of a man&#39;s BO and a life at the seas.<br />
<br />
While that guard enjoys himself, the other approaches to swing at Nate. But a dirty kick causes the man to stumble, face falling near Nate&#39;s crotch, and Nate using it as an opportunity to secure another new crewmate. Pulling his shorts forward to make space for the guards head. Everything going according to plan as the man&#39;s head presses against the pirates crotch. Nate releasing his grip on the shorts, fabric snapping back in place, and leaving the guard trapped between Nate&#39;s dick and pants. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s not a hard position to escape, just bring your head up and back away to reposition. But it&#39;s all too much. The musk of Nate&#39;s heavy cock that only grows as the raid continues. Creating a line of pre as it rises against the guard&#39;s cheek, his face tickled by countless red pubes as he turns his head to face the pirates dick. Lapping up as many drops of pre as he can have, while Nate basks at his bands clear victory. <br />
<br />
Every guard on deck has become nothing more than a cockhungry bastard. Nate&#39;s chest heaving in and out as he is actively pleasured by the two he bested. Pecs enlarging with each breath, hairs growing further and being converted as happened with his pits. Turned entirely red, matching the hirsute form of his father and spreading down to connect with his pubes. Torso matching his arms with that growing muscle. Finally strong enough to consider himself at least a quarter of the man his father is. The starting lines of a six pack emerging and legs tightening to cement his changes, and give him one brief moment to relax.<br />
<br />
Though every crewmate is busy having their way with a captive, and no one has gone below deck yet to secure any plunder. Nate&#39;s natural scowl growing further, resembling his brute of a father as the first mate approaches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, Nate. How bout ye head down there and I&#39;ll take these two off your hands. Savvy?&quot; Nate&#39;s scowl shifts to a confident smirk. &quot;Aye, ye think there&#39;ll be a better reward down there?&quot; The pirate nodding as he pulls the first man away from Nate&#39;s pits and stuffs him under his own. &quot;Aye, rooms are more comfortable for recruitment as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate laughs, tossing the other captive over as the first mate gives him a taste of his crotch. Nates dick still rock hard, and wanting release. The pirate stroking it a few times as he heads down into the ship proper. Stopping himself to save his load for whatever lucky bastard is down here.<br />
<br />
The inside of the ship is mostly empty. There&#39;s gold and silk which he&#39;ll be sure to load onboard for his father. But no people. The pirate going from room to room to see if anyone else remains. Mostly passing empty bedrooms, rather fancy with well cushioned beds and well made oak cupboard and dressers. The sailor growing frustrated as he goes from empty room, to empty room, to a cowering man hiding in the closet. It&#39;s contents dumped onto the floor, and Nate sneaking in with a mischievous smirk. One kiss is all it would take to set things in motion, and he was going to enjoy making this one into crew. <br />
<br />
With one arm he throws the closet opened, and with the other he holds the man&#39;s shirt. Keeping him still, using his new muscle to restrain the thin and wirey merchant. Just like with the room, he is well presented. Silk green shirt and pants, embedded with gems and silver. Blond hair long and straight, chin covered in stubble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t hurt me! I&#39;ll do anything!&quot; Nate laughs, raising an eyebrow. &quot;Anything? Aye. Give me a kiss and ye can go... If ye want.&quot; <br />
<br />
The merchant obeys the order, staying still as Nate descends and their lips lock. The pirate taking after his father, taking full control of the situation. The two hard after a few seconds, and Nate grinding his pole against the other mans own cock. Not letting their shorts get in the way of things as they rub against each other despite the fabric blocking them. Nate slowly frees the man. Looking him dead in the eye and shrugging.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had me kiss. Now ye can go.&quot; The pirate starting to walk away, but the merchant hurrying up to him. Hands wrapping around the pirates back as he begs. &quot;P-please! I need more! Please don&#39;t leave me!&quot; The pirate smirking in response. &quot;Then get yer ass on the bed and strip down.&quot;<br />
<br />
He obeys. Stripping at a record pace, and spreading out on the bed. Nate eyeing his newest conquest as he pulls down his pants, and takes off his vest. Tossing them into a pile, and giving one more stroke to his cock. What was he going to do with this man... Did he even want to do something? <br />
<br />
Now that the fight had ended, reality hit him hard. Something wasn&#39;t adding up. Was he really a pirate? Was this really his life? Was he really slowly becoming a muscular stud like his father. That hairy brute with his broad chest and stern looks. Ready to order Nate to get on his knees and suck his cock. Mmm, Nate can&#39;t help but love the days when his father barks those commands. The changing pirate turning his head to take a deep whiff of his pits. That hardy scent, more masculine than his current build. But that would change, more work and more sex would keep making him like his father. It&#39;s only been a few months after all.<br />
<br />
But wait... Has it been a few months? It&#39;s all a blur, and Nate isn&#39;t sure what he wants to do. His cock is hard and there&#39;s a needy merchant, which is enough to restore his confidence, and have Nate decide on just what to do with this man.</p>
