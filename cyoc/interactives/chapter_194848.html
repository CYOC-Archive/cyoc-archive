<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Victor left the cabin he was splitting with Chase and Jason after the long day of work, pulling his parka up nice and tight to chase off the cold. Along with the fading power and erratic transformations, it seemed like things had been getting even colder lately, which meant that most people tended to stay inside during the coldest parts of the evening. To that end, Victor knew exactly where he was going: the Spruce Sled, a bar that was just around the corner from the cabin he was staying in. Unlike a lot of the bars scattered around the resort, this <i>wasn’t</i> a place to sit and chat, it <i>wasn’t</i> a place for a date, and it <i>wasn’t</i> a place for a quick bite at the end of the day. It was a place to drink and unwind, which is why it had quickly become a favorite of Victor’s. With Jason off catching up with Tom and Lars and with Chase running off for a swim every night, Victor figured nobody would mind him going out to enjoy himself for a bit.<br />
<br />
	He soon made it to the bar and headed in, letting out a relieved sigh as the warmth from the big fireplace against the wall hit him. He immediately found a spot at the bar and ordered up a beer, then he glanced around at the different people that had come by for a drink that night. As a blue-collar bar without too many frills, it generally attracted people who worked for the resort, meaning it was full of elves, foxes, bears, and even a few reindeer that had flown in from Santa’s village. By now, Victor was getting used to all the magical creatures at the resort, even though he hadn’t really seen much evidence of ‘magic’ himself, except for seeing Tom and Lars ‘poof’ back and forth between their different forms a few times during these increasingly common power outages.<br />
<br />
	Despite that, Lars had really been pushing the different ‘transformation packages’ to all of them lately; Jason had jumped at the chance and had already tried at least three, but Victor always brushed it off, saying that he had better things to do.<br />
<br />
	When Victor’s drink finally arrived, he began to slowly drink and continue his people-watching while letting the aches of the day fade away. He had been hard at work welding a mounting for the satellites they’d been installing, and he needed to be sure they could handle strong winds and extreme temperatures without failing, so he’d been putting in a lot of effort to make his spot-welds flawless. As he drank, he spotted a small group of men at a table in the corner, speaking quietly amongst themselves and passing a bottle of vodka around the table. They were pretty tough-looking guys, tall and leanly muscled and all wearing identical red jackets and knit hats.<br />
<br />
	“Some kind of uniform… Must work for the resort, or they wouldn’t have matching outfits,” Victor mused to himself as he kept an eye on the group. As he continued to look at them, he noticed with surprise that their jackets were not the only things that matched; every single one of them had identical eyes, a bright, icy blue that almost seemed to glow in the dim light of the bar. All except for the one sitting at the head of the table, who Victor noticed had a mismatched pair, one blue and the other a coppery brown.<br />
<br />
	The men seemed to notice Victor staring at him and shot him a few amused glances of their own, whispering among each other. Finally, the odd-eyed man called over to Victor and waved the bottle of vodka in his direction. “Oi, you want to join us, <i>tovarish</i>? Come, drink!” he shouted with a thick Russian-accented voice, and soon all eyes in the entire bar were looking right at Victor to see how he would respond. He didn’t particularly appreciate the sudden attention, but it seemed like they wouldn’t leave him along until he humored them, so he slowly rose up from the bar and headed over to the table, where the group of men happily cleared a spot for him.<br />
<br />
 “So sorry, but I noticed you looking? Jealous of good drink, not that expensive brown water you were drinking, <i>da</i>?” the odd-eyed man said cheerfully as he held his bottle out for Victor to take. “For you, friend. More than enough to go around!”<br />
<br />
“Uhh… Sure, thanks a lot, man,” Victor replied, cautiously taking the bottle and taking a big swig of vodka. He knew right away this wasn’t the cheap shit that got mixed into overpriced cocktails, but it was real, top-of-the-shelf stuff. “Damn… This is great! Where do you get stuff this good around here, anyway?”<br />
<br />
“The barman here, he holds onto it for us, for me and my team. To enjoy after a tough job,” the other man replied. “Oh, how rude! My name is Sirius, but don’t let it fool you. Not a serious man at all! Hahaha!”<br />
<br />
The rest of the men at the table groaned, clearly sick of that joke, but it still got a little chuckle out of Victor. “I’m Victor, you can call me Vic if you want,” Victor said, passing the bottle back around. “So, Sirius… What do you guys do around here? You work for the resort, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yes and no. We get called here because of this… Power problem? An old friend who works here, calls my team in from Siberia. Say he needs people to help in case of problems. Rescue, delivery, these things, <i>da</i>?” Sirius said quite seriously. “We just get back, family of tourists go out onto tundra for hiking. They turn into foxes to stay warm, but then ‘poof’! Back to humans, and very cold!”<br />
<br />
“Damn… That’s horrible,” Victor said, shocked that things were getting so bad. He couldn’t imagine being trapped outside on a night like this, especially if there were kids along with them. “And you rescued them? I’m very impressed.”<br />
<br />
“Not impressive. Is my job,” Sirius said quietly, while the rest of his ‘team’ nodded along solemnly. “But, I thank you, Vic. You are a kind man, I can tell. And strong!”<br />
<br />
Sirius let out a boisterous laugh, raising the mood of everyone at the table. He leaned over and ran his hands across Victor’s muscled chest, genuinely impressed at the other man’s strength.<br />
<br />
“Yes, very strong! I am impressed! Even Tolya, my right-hand man, he is not so strong as this!” Sirius praised wildly. “Vic, you could help us a lot, I think! In emergencies, we need strong and kind men like this!”<br />
<br />
This offer came completely out of nowhere and threw Victor for a loop. He was supposed to be helping Tom and Lars, not running around dealing with lost kids and things like that! He did his best to explain the problem to Sirius, but he felt like he wasn’t exactly getting through to the other man, although he wasn’t sure if it was a language barrier or if he was just getting too drunk to understand.<br />
<br />
“Ah, I understand, you are worried you are not skilled enough. No problems. Under my eye, even a novice could be a hero, this I promise you!” Sirius continued, his voice slurring a bit as the bottle of vodka began to empty.<br />
<br />
“No, I mean that I can’t-“<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, the door to the bar burst open and a werewolf stomped inside, wearing a handsome vest and tie and nothing else. He glanced around at the bar, silently judging its lack of style and polish, then he strode over to the table where Sirius and Victor were sitting.<br />
<br />
“<i>Doktor</i>! Otso, my friend, you finally accept my invitation for a drink!” Sirius said cheerfully, offering the bottle that only had a few drops left to the werewolf.<br />
<br />
“No, I am not here to drink. I am here to ask you why you aren’t at your station,” the werewolf growled in annoyance. “We have an incident you need to deal with.”<br />
<br />
“Damn… Otso, you are serious? I thought we’d have a break after the last one, but…” Sirius began to say, clearly quite upset. A quiet growl began to form in his throat, an oddly inhuman noise that caught Victor by surprise. “<i>&#1069;&#1073;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100;</i>, this is no good. Misha and Lyova, they are still resting. Misha twists an ankle and Lyova cuts his paw. Are no good to come along…”<br />
<br />
“I understand that, but we need you out there <i>now</i>. The reindeer are out on a delivery, so it has to be your team,” Otso said, stress beginning to seep into his voice. “I’m very sorry to ask you this, but-“<br />
<br />
“Do not be sorry. We will do it,” Sirius replied, rising to his feet. “We move out! Move it!”<br />
<br />
The others at the table rose up alongside him, and even Victor found himself standing at attention due to the intense tone of Sirius’ voice. He knew he’d turned down Sirius’ request for help, but now that there was an actual emergency going on and especially knowing that some of Sirius’ team were injured…<br />
<br />
“Is there anything I can do to help?” Victor asked, catching up to Sirius and the others at the door to the bar. Otso and Sirius glanced at him, gears turning in their heads as they considered the offer for help.<br />
<br />
“Vic, my friend… I know I offer you, but this is…” Sirius said, his mismatched eyes glowing slightly. “…I understand. But if you want to help, then you must do what I say, no questions. Is this okay?”<br />
<br />
“Anything. Just tell me what I need to do.”<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Out on the street, the rest of Sirius’ team began to gather up near a large wooden sled, preparing some leather harnesses and making sure the sled was properly loaded up for the task they had been given. Victor could hear them chattering amongst themselves in Russian, but Sirius pulled him aside from the others.<br />
<br />
“If you want to join us tonight, you must be like us,” Sirius said quietly. “You are strong, but… I’m sorry, but you are merely human. No offense meant, but you must have our strength. Our stamina. Our fur. You understand what I am saying, <i>da</i>?”<br />
<br />
“F-fur? No, I actually don’t-“ Victor began to say, but then it hit him. If these people had been brought in by the Polar Resort, they must be some sort of magical creature, despite appearing to be human back at the bar. Victor glanced at the rest of the team, his eyes going wide as white and black fur burst out from beneath their skin, tails forcing their way out from beneath their jackets, and massive furry paws taking the place of their hands and feet. Their faces pushed out into long, pointed muzzles and a pair of sharp triangular ears soon stuck out from beneath their hats, revealing their true forms as a group of humanoid Siberian Huskies.<br />
<br />
“You understand? Our job is to pull the sled. To go out onto the snowy tundra and find people who are missing. If you wish to help us, you <i>cannot</i> be human. Is too dangerous,” Sirius explained. He went over to the sled and rifled around in one of the boxes, only to return a moment later with an red jacket and knit hat that matched his and the rest of the team’s. “If you are sure, wear this. Do not be afraid, we will help you through your first change.”<br />
<br />
Victor slowly reached out and took the clothes, feeling an incredible warmth from within them that he <i>knew</i> must be pure transformative magic. He thought hard for a moment, wondering if he was really up for this task. Wondering if he was willing to go through with transforming himself just to do the right thing and help. However, it didn’t take long for him to make his decision, and he quickly swapped out his own jacket for the one he had been given and pulled the hat over his head.<br />
<br />
“You are a good man, Vic. I not forget your kindness,” Sirius said with a giant smile on his face, then he pulled Victor into a tight hug that filled his entire body with an intense warm. “This will not take long, but the first time can be very… intense.”<br />
<br />
“I-Intense? How-“<br />
<br />
Victor was immediately cut off as a jolt shot through his entire body, starting at the end of his spine and radiating upward, blasting off waves of warm, vibrating pleasure though every nerve in his body. He pressed his face deeper into Sirius’ chest, panting and squeezing his eyes shut as he felt a long, furry tail slowly push its way out from his tailbone, waving proudly in the cold winter air. Though he couldn’t see it happening, he knew that the pleasurable itch spreading out from his new tail could only be his coat of fur coming in, and his tongue slipped out of his lips and lolled out happily as he felt the long, luxurious fur begin to cover every inch of his body.<br />
<br />
“S-Sirius… I-It’s so…”<br />
<br />
“I know, I know…” Sirius said calmly, gently running his fingers through Victor’s hair. He could already see the other man’s ears beginning to pull themselves into sharp points, granting Victor the improved hearing he would need to be helpful in the upcoming rescue. “First time is intense, needs to push out all your human essence <i>very</i> quick. Can be a bit of shock to system.”<br />
<br />
Victor could barely understand what Sirius was saying through all the pleasure, moaning and growling loudly as his hands and feet each seemed to inflate and thicken with muscle and fur, gaining a pair of dull black claws at the tip of each finger and toe. His large new paws let him stand easily atop the snow like a pair of snowshoes, giving him even more of an advantage out on the tundra. The changes continued up his entire body as more and more fur coated his body; muscles tightened and toned themselves, heightening his strength and stamina to levels that he never could have imagined, until the fur finally reached his neck and began to push up and begin to coat his face. By the time his entire face had been coated in dense white and black fur, he could feel his entire skull slowly reshaping itself, warping and pushing itself forward into a sharp muzzle like the rest of the team. <i>His</i> team, he found himself thinking. His ears twitched happily atop his head, enjoying the touch of Sirius’ fingers as they stroked and calmed him as he was guided through his changes.<br />
<br />
“Very close now, Vic. Only thing left is-“<br />
<br />
“<b>AWOOOOOOOO~</b>!” Victor howled, raising his muzzle to the sky and letting out a beastly shout as he felt his cock immediately stiffen, feeling more aroused than he ever had in his entire life. He let out a few little whines and growls as a thick, fuzzy sheath rose up to cover his newly red and pointed cock, and as soon as that final change had finished he blasted out a seemingly unending stream of hot cum down his own leg.<br />
<br />
“There we go, all done!” Sirius said cheerfully, by now having changed into his own true form of a massive Siberian Husky like the rest of his team. “Sorry about that… We prefer to take little more time to induct new member, but there is not time, <i>da</i>? Had to get all that human essence out <i>fast</i>! Ah, speaking of which...”<br />
<br />
Victor was in a complete daze from both the rapid transformation and from his sudden orgasm, but he felt Sirius tugging down his cum-stained pants and tossing them aside, then the other husky began to lap at Victor’s soaked fur and paying special attention to his sheath and still dripping cock, cleaning up every last drop of semen that had soaked in and leaving his fur all clean.<br />
<br />
“There we are, all ready to go! Once again, a thousand thanks, Vic! You truly are a kind man… When we get back, all drinks are on me!” Sirius said, wiping a bit of Victor’s cum from his lips and acting as though nothing had happened. He gave Victor a quick scratch behind the ears, then he turned back to the rest of the team and started shouting out orders in Russian. “<i>Oi, finish loading the sled, then get out new guy harnessed up in Misha’s position! Move it, we need to be leaving 5 minutes ago!</i>”</p>
