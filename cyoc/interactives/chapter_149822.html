<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">…Megan.<br />
<br />
The elegant chocolate coloured mare had been added to the stables a couple of days ago, alongside her boyfriend Alan. However, neither seemed too bothered about their loss of humanity, and if anything they revelled in their changes. They just seemed happy that they were still together.<br />
<br />
However, with all the activity over the last few days the couple had been somewhat neglected. Megan had entered her first heat, which was an intended part of the transformation process designed to ensure that new converts were too ‘distracted’ to think about escaping. <br />
<br />
In this regard the change had been a resounding success. Megan was just as sexually frustrated as Jenny, if not more so. She often pranced around with her tail raised, desperate to be back with her boyfriend. For Alan, the sight and smell of his lover was irresistible. His mind was almost always clouded with thoughts of mounting her like he had on the day of their transformation.<br />
<br />
Consequently Alan sported an almost constant erection, even whilst sleeping, as even his dreams were occupied by Megan the mare. For her part Megan was similarly overwhelmed with lust. Her equine pussy was continuously wet with anticipation whilst her vagina winked open and closed subconsciously, begging to be filled by her lover’s thick shaft.<br />
<br />
The two had tried to alleviate their problems to the best of their abilities. Using his long neck, Alan was able to reach over the wall dividing their stalls. Then by using his long, flexible tongue, he was able to lick and tease the outer lips of his lover’s moist pussy. The taste of the mare’s sweet  juices soon became addicting to the stallion, causing him to lap away at her like a thirsty dog. Meanwhile Megan welcomed the temporary dulling of the pain within her loins that her orgasms brought. But the pair knew that they needed more, and they were starting to get desperate!<br />
<br />
Fortunately for Megan help was at hand. She had heard the commotion of Abby and Jenny’s separation and she had inquisitively taken a look at what was going on. That was when she spotted Abby. She knew that Alan would get annoyed if she stared for too long. But try as she might, she just couldn’t look away. This newcomer looked so powerful and wild as he fought against the annoying humans restraining him. She unwittingly leaned her head over her stall in order to get a closer look. <br />
<br />
As expected Alan was getting increasingly annoyed. He grumbled deeply at Megan in order to remind her that he was still her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
But Megan seemed to take no notice. Instead she craned her neck to get a good look at Abby as he approached. She sniffed inquisitively, only to be captivated by the musky smell pouring off the mighty stallion. She tried to convince herself that Alan still looked and smelled much better, but these efforts were not very convincing.<br />
<br />
As well as Abby’s scent, Megan couldn’t ignore his impressive physique. She studied his rippling muscles and his long slender neck. But the main attraction was what hung beneath the male’s massive body. Megan’s eyes fixated on Abby’s enormous testicles for a few moments as they swayed in time with each of his heavy steps. But what really got her excited was the stallion’s enormous cock which was already outside its sheath and standing at attention, ready for action.<br />
<br />
Then a much louder guttural bellow echoed out from Alan as he warned both horses of who was in charge. The sound made Megan shudder. Her mare mentality loved how protectively he was acting. Now she was tempted to submit to his will and to reject this impostor stallion. She reminded herself that Alan was the true love of her life and that they shared a powerful bond.<br />
<br />
And yet the throbbing in her pussy began to corrupt her thoughts. Her instincts insisted that she was to be bred urgently, and here was a worthy suitor.<br />
<br />
She realised that she had little time to deliberate as her stall door swung open. Abby was soon ushered inside and the door was closed, although the attendants continued to restrain him in case the mating went wrong.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Alan watched in anger as this new stallion sought to claim his mare. He knew he couldn’t let that happen! He therefore continue to whinny, grumble and stomp his hooves in an effort to scare off the rival male and to convince Megan that he was the more dominant animal.<br />
<br />
However, Abby wasn’t prepared to give in without a fight. She answered Alan’s calls in an attempt to make him back off. He hoped that this show of strength would make Megan recognise his superiority and convince her to offer herself to him.<br />
<br />
Now Megan had a difficult decision. Should she betray her boyfriend and submit to this eager suitor? Or should she try to fight off the burning pain in her loins in the hopes that she would get to be with Alan soon?<br />
<br />
She could only pick one of the stallions, and so she decided to…</p>
