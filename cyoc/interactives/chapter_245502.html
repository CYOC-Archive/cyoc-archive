<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It is very difficult for taking a nice sleep, knowing you are a product of two boys experimentation. Especially, when the said two boys having merging together, forming new personality and new entire person. That&#39;s unbelieveable at first, right?<br />
<br />
That&#39;s what happened to Kenff at 3 AM. His dream is so random. He start hearing the boys voice, talking from within his body. Deep at his core. He wanted to dismissed it as their minds formed to made his brain and memories being feed to his dream. But that&#39;s not what happening in reality.<br />
<br />
Deep inside him, Jeff is starting to awake from his commatose state inside the cocoon he and Ken&#39;s was &#39;imprison&#39; on. &quot;Where am I?&quot; He look at his surroundings. His hands are being hold by two muscular arms, embracing from behind. But their hands is covered in so many thin roots. It&#39;s circling from their ankles, to their skull. He realized he can&#39;t moved, as something big is making a nest inside his ass. <br />
<br />
He gazing to his right shoulder. There&#39;s Ken, peacefuly resting his chin from behind his body. His embrace his warm, lovingly welcoming Jeff in his arms. Jeff starting to remember. Ken&#39;s already taken his virginity yesterday. Something he never imagined that his childhood best friend would took from him. <br />
<br />
Their fullt connected to each other now at this point. Aside the literal connection of Ken&#39;s junior still inside his hole, he now form new feelings towards his best friend turned lover. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ken. Wake up.&quot;, he shakes Ken&#39;s chin with his right shoulder. Still asleep, Ken seems not responding to gentle gesture Jeff made. &quot;Wake up you idiot. We are trapped in here.&quot; Nothing happens. Then suddenly, Jeff buck his hips and push backwards to Ken, making the cock nested inside of him hitting his prostate. &quot;Aaaah.&quot; Jeff moan. His hole gripping tightly at the cock, making Ken jolt awake with blissful feeling. &quot;Uhhhh, Jeff. You are so tight down there.&quot; First sentence come from his mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Idiot.&quot; Jeff rolling his eyes. &quot;But you like it when I roll my hips and cock nesting inside, don&#39;t you?&quot; Ken looked at Jeff, smug on his face. &quot;Shut up&quot;, Jeff face getting shades of red. &quot;Listen. Where are we? Are we in jail? Look at this many thin roots.&quot; Jeff points his sight to the nerves scatters infront of them.<br />
<br />
Ken start analyzing their confinements. He recognized the roots as nerves of a human body. It is covering them, like computer&#39;s CPU with their cables as sort of interaction with user.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is set of nerves of a human body. I think they connecting us to something.&quot;, explains Ken. &quot;Connecting us to who?&quot;, asks Jeff. They&#39;re soon realized that The Programs really did the job. They are merged together in reality yesterday, at Jeff&#39;s room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. We are becoming one, Jeff. Can you believe it? We are merged together. It worked!&quot;, Ken said proudly. Jeff hate to admit but he enjoy it all. But how do they look like in the outside world?<br />
<br />
They then get a view from the man that they had form. The man, sit upon the edge of the bed, facing the mirror, giving a first point of view of the physical body. <br />
<br />
Kenff on the other hand is affected by this interaction of the two boys inside of him. They both squirm a lot inside of him, making his arousal start to level up. &quot;Oh not again.&quot;, Kenff says in exasperation.<br />
<br />
He strip his undies, then let his flaccid cock make his emergence to his most enormous size. Because of testosteron produced by his balls, his cock now reaching the size of 25cm. And its ridicoulous huge girth. It twitching demanding to be taken care of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, our cocks really fused to make that monster giant, Jeff. How cool was that?&quot;, Ken says in joy. &quot;Yeah I can&#39;t believe our cock will be that HUGE. How he managed all that?&quot;, he says in disbelieve. &quot;But look at the bright side, Jeff. We are look so masculine together. We should do this more often.&quot;, Ken suggests.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? NO. I mean, can we wait atleast until my ass is healed for your cock aggression? It still want to adapt to your size.&quot;, Jeff pleas.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you needed then.&quot;, Ken affirms. Jeff know now his lover is without doubt, has high sex drives. He want to rammed his cock inside his hole more than just this occassion.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to 2:30 PM, The Programs alerted Kenff about The Unmerging. His time as a muscular men has come to an end. <br />
<br />
&quot;Attention. You have completed the 24 hours duration of The Merging. You&#39;ll be separated and returns as individuals. Prepare to Unmerged at 3 minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenff sighed. He just experiencing his moment as sexy rugby player time not a long ago. Now he must ceased to exist. He then go strip all of what he is wearing, to make a pass for the boys to be &quot;reborn&quot;. He lay down on the floor, making sure no any obstacle will be on his way. <br />
<br />
&quot;5, 4, 3, 2, 1...&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, slowly, his body started to glow. He closed his eyes as he bid farewell to the room he have been used for 24 hours. The boys is freed from the cocoon, and lifted up to the surface, thus undoing the Merging process before. <br />
<br />
At the floor, there&#39;s Ken, laying stiff while Jeff start reforming to their position when they&#39;re first merged. His head, his arms started to detach from Ken. Then goes his chest, his abs, his thighs and ankles now resurfaced. The last to reform are his ass and cock, with his hole still nesting his lover&#39;s huge cock <br />
<br />
They jolt awake. &quot;Aaargh Ken. Your cock still inside of me.&quot;, groaned Jeff. Ken jokingly rock his hips up to Jeff, seduce him to finish their sex, and the boy reciprocate the gesture. They fuck hard again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh Jeff. I&#39;m going to cum.&quot;, moaned Ken. &quot;Ahh go ahead. Let it out inside of me.&quot;, Jeff gives him permission. He then start to increase his pace. &quot;Jeff ahhh.. I&#39;m close.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaah Ken, Ken... KEN&quot; &quot;JEFF...&quot; They both cum together. Jeff load is pouring to his abs, and Ken inside his hole. They catching their breath, giggling. Then goes on to kiss one another. <br />
<br />
&quot;That is the best moments I&#39;ve just have my entire life. Thank you Jeff. I never forgetting this moment.&quot;, Ken muttered, gazing the ceiling. &quot;Yeah, me too.&quot;, Jeff adds.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, boyfriends then?&quot;, Ken asks. &quot;Boyfriends.&quot;, confirms Jeff. They then cuddle together on the floor pressing chest to chest. <br />
<br />
The Programs then shutdown, reserved it&#39;s energy to another presets that the new couple wants to test.</p>
