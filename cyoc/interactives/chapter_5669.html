<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Saul had stopped pleasuring herself shortly after Scott walked in, once his scent made its way past her nose.  She, too, found her old male name to not feel right.  Settling on Sarah, she lost interest in fingering herself, instead staring at the gorgeous male that was busy humping her friend.  As she watched him climax inside of her fellow vixen, she felt a pang of jealousy before realizing that he could be shared.<br />
<br />
Tina had fallen asleep, passed out from the pleasure, but Scott was still awake.  Sarah waited until Scott's knot had softened and shrank enough for him to pull out, since seducing him before that would just keep him stick that much longer.  As soon as he was out, Scott was having second thoughts, realizing he just screwed his boss.<br />
<br />
But before he could even stand up, he looked up to see Sarah in front of him on all fours and her rear facing him.  Her tail was raised and she lowered her front end a bit, showing off her dripping slit.  Looking over her shoulder at Scott, she smiled and winked at him, pushing her rear into his face to give him a noseful of her scent.<br />
<br />
Scott tried to be repulsed.  After all, he'd just had two orgasms recently.  However, his instincts would not be denied, especially when there was a vixen in heat mere inches from his face.  He closed his eyes, drinking in that scent once more, and without thinking he was already clamboring over Tina's prone body on all fours, not even bothering to get up.<br />
<br />
Sarah took a few paces forward so their union wouldn't disturb Tina.  She was worn out and needed her rest, after all.  Scott followed her as surely as he would if she had clamped a hand around his muzzle and draged him forward.<br />
<br />
When they were a few feet away, Sarah stopped.  Scott thrust his nose into her sex, licking and savoring the taste.  Sarah shuddered and wrapped her tail around Scott's head.  &quot;There's plenty of time for that later, I need you in me NOW!&quot; she said in a breathless whisper.<br />
<br />
Scott didn't need to be told twice.  He placed his paws on her rump, pulling her back as he moved forward, brushing her tail out of the way and wrapping his arms around her chest.  He caressed her breasts as he moved his hips to touch his fully erect penis to her slit.  Sarah gave a shiver of anticipation, moaning.<br />
<br />
Scott's mind was too clouded by instinct for him to bother taking this vixen slowly or gently.  Which worked out fine, because Sarah's instincts left her wanting nothing but to have this cock in her as deep as it could go, as soon as possible.  Scott drove into her, his knot jamming up against her flesh.<br />
<br />
Sarah gave a shriek of pleasure and started pushing back, trying to get even more, as Scott humped her at a blazing pace.  Scott slammed into her, forcing his knot inside as Sarah shoved as hard as she could.  Once inside, his knot expanded even more as he tied with her.  He ground his crotch into hers, trying to pull her back by her breasts even though his groin was already pressed into her flesh.<br />
<br />
Sarah's mouth hung open and her tongue lolled out, her eyes rolling back as she grunted and panted in wanton lust at the feel of the male inside her.  Scott was humping her furiously in short strokes as his knot pulled at her and slammed into her, over and over.  Sarah started hitting orgasm after orgasm, in her mind nothing more than an animal that lived for one purpose and one purpose only: to mate.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like an eternity, Scott's aching balls managed to provide another load of cum, churning as his dick shot it out into the vixen under him.  Scott moaned as release came for the third time in less than an hour.  He collapsed, exhausted yet still humping weakly, his cock trying to release more foxcum even though nothing more would come out.<br />
<br />
Sarah had never before felt anything that felt as good as the feeling of hot semen rushing to fill her depths, relieving her of an itch that had been bothering her ever since she changed, one that even her slender fingers couldn't reach.  She felt Scott's weight on her back as he could barely keep himself awake, let alone support himself.  She grinned as she tried to catch her breath.  She had done well in her conquest, and she knew she never wanted to give up this wonderful male.<br />
<br />
She felt an almost sisterly bond with the vixen who was so recently her boss, and knew that she couldn't deprive her of such pleasure.  The two could share this male, since he was able to please both of them.  At least for now, &quot;Saul&quot; no longer existed, have been burned away by the intense heat of her orgasms.  Instincts flooded her mind with thoughts of the future, bearing litters of kits for her mate.<br />
<br />
She lowered her body to the floor, with Scott having fallen asleep and still humping lightly in his dreams.  As exhaustion overtook her, she realized that she had become pregnant.  The thought didn't bother her at all, though.  In fact, she didn't think she could ever be happier than she was right now.</p>
