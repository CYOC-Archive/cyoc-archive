<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">  Justin was the average high school nerd, being a freshman. While he was not too thin, he was quite skinny and light, his friends at school consisted of family members who went to the same school as him and other people who had similar interests like Justin. <br />
<br />
Justin was a straight B student who would&#39;ve looked very handsome had he had more muscle on his bones with his brown hair and brown eyes.<br />
<br />
  Justin was taking a stroll in the park, hands in his jeans, looking at anything that caught his attention, it was around six pm the sun setting but Justin wasn&#39;t worried since his parents trusted him enough to be out late.<br />
<br />
  The air was cool and flowers gave off a nice aroma that calmed Justin lifting his sour mood.<br />
<br />
As of now Justin&#39;s crush Amy was currently dating another guy, far more muscular than Justin.<br />
<br />
  Amy was in Justin&#39;s computer class and was a kind smart girl, however that didn&#39;t really matter in high school when Amy was also one of the most beautiful girls in school.<br />
<br />
Despite her beauty Amy was a bit of a tomboy who perfected wearing shorts that went past her knees than the more slutty skirts high school girls seemed to wear more often.<br />
<br />
Justin had conversations with Amy but whenever he talked with her for too long, Amy&#39;s boyfriend would come out of nowhere and interrupt the conversation.<br />
<br />
Justin sighed and continued walking. Unknowingly as Justin walked deeper into the park forest, he slowly walked into another world entirely.<br />
<br />
  Justin didn&#39;t notice until he came upon a clearing. Despite it only being a late afternoon in summer the sky became black.<br />
<br />
Justin shivered randomly for no reason, and slightly timid he went into the middle of the clearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, this is getting kinda creepy now.&quot; Justin said to himself.<br />
<br />
In the middle of the clearing was a mask. Made seemingly of bone it was the mask of a black wolf like creature, dark blue markings were painted on the mask and and Justin reached down to pick it up, he immediately felt a burst of a strange power.<br />
<br />
Justin did his best to ignore it. Then a untraceable voice came out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have been chosen for a powerful gift, wear this mask and it will grant you its power. However few are able to wear it, if your will is weak the mask will consume you, if your will is strong the mask will give you all of its strength. If you do not wish to take the risk, leave the mask behind and you will be transported back to your home, your memory wiped of this encounter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin gasped and turned around looking for the person who spoke.<br />
<br />
After a moment of silence Justin considered the voice&#39;s words.<br />
<br />
Justin didn&#39;t believe in magic or other words but he was curious. Curious of the mask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if I die, just remember that Atleast I tried&quot; Justin said aloud. When he said that, the forest seemed to give respect. The wind died down and the very ground was still at those words.<br />
<br />
Slowly Justin wore the mask... and immediately transformed. While it only happened in a single moment, for Justin it was a lifetime. Justin didn&#39;t feel pain but felt like his body was being filled with power. He grew taller and muscles replaced his thin arms with the muscles of the wrestlers. His clothes ripped leaving him naked as he looked down and saw his entire body had suddenly become muscular. His feet started growing black fur spreading from his toes all the way up his body. The fur spread to his dick which suddenly bulged and grew to be three times as large , big enough to make anyone jealous. His human tip became red and canine and was already leaking slightly. Justin gave out a pleasures moan and watched as the fur spread through his body. His hands grew claws and pads and his saw as his face grew a furred muzzle like a wolf and he grew giant fangs. His eyes turned into a dark purple and he grew a furred tail that wagged with pleasure. As the transformation completed purple markings that reminded Justin of the Greek alphabet appeared on various points on his body. <br />
<br />
The change was complete. Justin&#39;s heart beated quickly as he examined his body, he was tall and muscled, a normal person would&#39;ve freaked out at this but Justin was far from scarred. <br />
<br />
&quot;This... This is amazing!&quot; Justin shouted, loving his new body, he looked around and saw how advanced his sense had become. He could see ants scuttling on the ground and could hear and smell the vibrations of a rabbit that while seemed close by something told Justin it was actually a mile away.  Justin looked at a tree that was about a quarter of a mile away and ran towards it. He got there in nearly five seconds. He was strong and fast but he didn&#39;t look like a steroid freak. Walking around the tree he grabbed its trunk and with barely a thought crushed it into wooden chips with his claws.<br />
<br />
Justin was giddy at the point. He went on all fours and gave a long deep howl that could be heard for miles telling the world of his existence. <br />
<br />
Justin instinctively held out his hand and suddenly like magic a floating purple flame appeared in his palm, while it was very hot it didn&#39;t bother Justin at all. as he threw it at a nearby tree and watched the purple orb of fire explode the tree into a thousand charred pieces spreading through the grass like wildfire. Justin walked through the purple flames and barely felt it as he ran back to the park forest.<br />
<br />
Justin ran for a very long time, going faster than a NAS car stopping by a river. Justin panted heavily his excitement fading and then realizing what would happen if he got home. He loved his new body, but he couldn&#39;t live a normal life as a powerful beast of nature.<br />
<br />
Justin took a deep breath and sat down by the river side. Looking at the half moon in its brightness. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a way to turn back human? Just temporarily?&quot; Justin said to himself. The wind gave him an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Snap your finger.&quot; it said.<br />
<br />
Justin looked around surprised but still even with his senses find the person who said it. <br />
<br />
Justin snapped his fingers and in a rush he returned into his naked human form. <br />
<br />
Justin gasped as he no longer felt his fur or tail and snapped his fingers another time. In a flash he was back in his wild form. <br />
<br />
Justin gave a sigh of relief and went back into his human form. <br />
<br />
His human form was also different as well. His brown hair had turned black and his arms and legs while still skinny were now quite muscled. <br />
<br />
His dick was also while smaller than in his wolf form was still massive and had a canine tip as well. His balls were quite hairy but he didn&#39;t mind that as he rubbed his dick slightly moaning at the pleasure he felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the life.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
He would have even more fun tomorrow, as he started to fap his new long dick heavily.</p>
