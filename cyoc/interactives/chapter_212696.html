<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I just wonder, are we voyeurs?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bite your tongue man! We&#39;re doing our job to make sure none of the guests eat each other, or grow rabbit ears out of their stomach.&quot; Zack said. <br />
<br />
&quot;All the same I&#39;m making a note to the higher ups that we should turn down the hormones in the commercial version of the transformation. Those two wolves are getting on more like rabbits than the rabbits. And the cows don&#39;t seem to be doing much thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why this is called the &#39;testing phase&#39;. It&#39;s iron out &#39;run time errors&#39;. The cows having all the brains of some teenager&#39;s harem girl fantasy for example. Why do you think all of these &#39;test versions&#39; of the guests are sterile? It&#39;s so we can clean out these bugs before they produce the first &#39;natural&#39; anthro who WON&#39;T have a human template to be transformed into if their DNA turns out to be a mess or there are &#39;complications&#39;. That&#39;s for the paying customers to deal with if they get it on.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of complications, I&#39;m worried about our little PR stunts, there aren&#39;t exactly any love hotels in there for privacy. Their parents will eat us alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Management might be crazy, but they&#39;re not stupid. First, it&#39;s a big park, once they get away from the transformation booths, there&#39;s plenty of empty space, and like Disney does with its animals, there&#39;s plenty of subtly design choices to get the groups to particular spots. And we have our &#39;senshi&#39; keeping an eye on them, along with their parents. Well, the fox girls&#39; parents are likely to let her roam free, but not the other two, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like too big a risk.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;First rule of PR, leaves NOTHING to &#39;risk&#39;. Those little darlings have a failsafe genetically modified into them. None of the guests know it, they release a subtle pheromone that suppresses sexual impulses in their presence. No one will feel the urge in their presence, or even be able to focus on the idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a relief. Off topic, I didn&#39;t expect alphas to form so quickly among the park huskies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alpha males only exist in confined spaces, in the wild packs are made of nuclear families, so it makes sense they&#39;re begin to instinctively form a hierarchy.&quot;  <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Bill wasn&#39;t the bull&#39;s real name, but he had a strong impression that this whole thing was gonna be &#39;what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas&#39; so it was better not to have anything that could betray who he was in the real world. <br />
<br />
The joke was, in his real life, he had a micro-penis. And worked a soulless 9-5 job accounting in an advertisement firm. He hated his job. But didn&#39;t have the ability to be anything else. It was a worthless job for a worthless person. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d signed up to have something truly exception in his life. If he turned into a pile of goo from the mad scientists misplacing a chromosome, so be it. <br />
<br />
Instead, he&#39;d come out a hulking minotaur, with a member better than anything he could imagine. He hoped he didn&#39;t bump into anything with it.<br />
<br />
He knew this was all a fantasy, a real life fiction, glorified role playing. Like the LARPing he&#39;d done in high school and collage. In two months he&#39;d go back to his boring empty life, like this had never happened. <br />
<br />
So Bill was going to enjoy this fantasy to the hilt! <br />
<br />
There were 20 of each species, and ten species total. 200 guests. He didn&#39;t know what the other 9 bulls and 7 cows were up to. Maybe they&#39;d challenge each other for dominance of the heard later or something? If the others were as sexual charged, it might cause trouble with there being an equal number of cows and bulls. <br />
<br />
That was how these &#39;social experiments&#39; typically went. Or they&#39;d just ignore each other and just enjoy the ride. <br />
<br />
The three cows he&#39;d met were so out of it that they didn&#39;t give a damn. Pleasuring themselves and feeding their faces. And they&#39;d looked at Bill with such deference and desire that it was slightly off putting, slightly. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d heard other people complaining about being men turned into women and women turned into men. But that just meant for Bill that this would remain even more anonymous. No way any of these cows would speak a word of any of this happening if they were men on the outside. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d herded the cows away from the entrance out of sight, and with nominally more privacy, and more grazing space for them all. Oh yeah, Bill was gonna be on a vegan diet for two months... well, no one said this was gonna be perfect. <br />
<br />
The cows had done everything but grab him and leap onto his shaft themselves. Feel like he was in a dream, Bill had complied. <br />
<br />
And just like that, he was no longer a virgin, well, &#39;Bill&#39; was no longer a virgin. Maybe they&#39;d mistake him for another woman turned into a hormone addled male, and he was fine with that, one more layer of anomyousness. The cows were practically living sex dolls and with brains to match. <br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, stand up and form a line.&quot;<br />
<br />
They looked at him dimly, but obeyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ste-Stephanie?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... I&#39;m Jugs!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me Moo-Moo.&quot; Said the last one dreamy. &quot;but you can call me anything you want!&quot; <br />
<br />
Bill was officially in a glorified LARP of a &#39;in other-world harem fantasy.&#39; And he&#39;d enjoy this fantasy as much as he could until the real world came knocking in two months. The way the disclaimer had included the message that it was impossible for any of them to get pregnant made it clear the park managers WANTED their guests to engage in vacation sex. After all, if this awakened kinks in any of the guests, they&#39;d be paying through the nose for another go. <br />
&#39;The first one is always free,&#39; Bill thought. &#39;Well, not like I was spending my savings on anything anyway.&#39;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
While she was unwittingly the one kit &#39;control group&#39;, &#39;Vicky&#39; was ... the kinda kids who either became a science fiction writer, or lived forever with her parents. &#39;Normal&#39; or &#39;Average&#39; was never anything Vickey&#39;s classmates would ever describe her ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;And so, it&#39;s our duty to discover what planet the aliens have taken us to and stop their invasion of Earth!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought we were kidnapped by fairies and put in Obereon&#39;s private zoo,&quot; &#39;Bucky&#39; the fawn said, he never sat down if he could help it. He&#39;d spent years doing nothing but sitting down, and he was going to use his legs as much as he could. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was yesterday,&quot; Vicky the fox girl waved. &quot;Everyone knows that your consciousness vanishes and returns every time you sleep. So we&#39;re obviously in a different universe than before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Kathy&#39; the bobcat cub raised a paw, &quot;But we dream every night, even if we don&#39;t remember it, then doesn&#39;t that mean our thinking doesn&#39;t actually stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vickey opened her mouth, shut it, then made a thinking pose. &quot;This requires more investigation.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna race to the big rock?&quot; Bucky asked, it wasn&#39;t hard to guess which rock. It was a landmark visible from almost anywhere in the park. A little something to keep guests from getting lost (though their sense of smell and hearing made that a lot harder in practice than you think). <br />
<br />
&quot;SURE!&quot; Kathy agreed, and the raced off without a second thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY WAIT FOR ME!&quot; Vickey called, racing on all four to catch up.</p>
