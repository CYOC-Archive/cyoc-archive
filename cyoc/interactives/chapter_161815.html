<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Issac wasn’t quite sure how long he had been walking, it felt like ages since he had seen anything else other than an endless black hallway. <br />
<br />
No matter how hard he tried, conflicting thoughts plagued his mind. A primal urge to dominate, and a selfless desire to maintain his paladin code, to be the emblem of virtue and purity he once strived to be.<br />
<br />
He tried to focus on the task at hand and focus on purging the corruption at it’s source... but he just couldn’t. The dilemma in his mind was no one to be ignored.<br />
<br />
The paladin turned hybrid amalgamation wandered the passageways of the Crypt, always searching, never finding, until finally, he came across a... portal...?<br />
<br />
He hadn’t even known he had walked in to it until suddenly, his body felt wet and light... as if he was floating...<br />
<br />
A calming sensation spread throughout his body, the burdens on his shoulder felt infinitely lighter and the aches in his body seemed to disappear.<br />
<br />
He wanted to rest, and to stay within this uplifting water. To never leave it, and as he floated in a blue abyss he was very much going to, until he opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
It truly was an ocean of crystal blue water he was in, he was quite deep underwater, the surface with it’s ethereal waves of sunlight far away him.<br />
<br />
He didn’t feel like he was drowning, every sense of urgency he had was diluted into nothingness.<br />
<br />
Yet... something felt wrong. The surface above, like a mirror leading into another world, him seemed to call him, but not a gentle call, but a call of urgency.<br />
<br />
Why? He was at peace here, every annoyance, frustration, feeling of negativity was gone whilst he was here. This was the most peaceful he has ever been in his life, why would he want to go?<br />
<br />
Then he glanced down at his body on a whim, and saw it fading... second by second, another piece of his form began to deteriorate peacefully into nothingness.<br />
<br />
The water was erasing him, and with that realization, the force of every burden he ever had returned to him in full force. He almost choked as suddenly the need for air returned as well, and within moments Issac found himself swimming as fast as he could towards the surface which seemed so distantly far.<br />
<br />
<br />
As he struggled to swim, the water’s eroding effect seemed to increased, now instead of mere fragments disappearing one by one, every second he spent in these deceptive waters seemed to take more and more of him.<br />
<br />
By the time he escaped, he wasn’t even sure if there would be anything else left of him.<br />
<br />
His legs had been eroded down into nubs, his fur was evaporating into nothingness, and his very sense of self felt like it was disappearing all together.<br />
<br />
Issac had no idea how long he had been swimming, the surface was still so far away despite his swimming. <br />
<br />
He could do nothing else but swim... but his body felt so heavy... he’d never make it.<br />
<br />
He’d have to lose some weight.<br />
<br />
Not caring of his possessions, Issac discarded everything he had. The tome, his sword, the remains of his armor, and the ring, all material possessions he had were left behind. With each thing he abandoned, he seemed to surge upward, his body feeling lighter and faster even as he continued to be eaten away by the water around him.<br />
<br />
He was so close, he could almost see the surface’s edge.<br />
<br />
He was nearing his limits, very soon he could feel that he was about to open his maw in vain and let the eroding water fill his insides, yet at the last second, he breached the surface of the water.<br />
<br />
He took in several ragged deep gasps for air and began to thrash around wildly like a crazed dog as he was unable to open his wet eyes.<br />
<br />
He splashed around crazily until finally, he felt ground nearby, with pure desperation, he grasped onto the soft earth and pulled himself out of the water onto the soft green grass on the ponds edge.<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, as he exited the water’s surface, his body almost instantly seemed to dry, the water cling onto him evaporating as he made it onto dry land.<br />
<br />
After several minutes of rugged breathing and a general gathering of his bearings, did Issac look around.<br />
<br />
He seemed to be in a sort of small oasis, a green island in an ocean of sand. But wasn’t he just submerged in a seemingly endless sea of water though? The body of water from which he emerged was a small pool, enough for the surrounding trees that shaded him to prosper from, yet still just a pond. <br />
<br />
He didn’t dare try to investigate the pool further, much less dip his head below to see if he could see anything.<br />
<br />
Looking down at his own body, he saw that he had indeed taken a rough hit. His limbs were practically eroded into stumps, as if his arms and legs had just melted away into nothing. His fur and plant matter seemed to have been damaged as well. He was practically bald, only having exposed plant flesh and sap underneath. <br />
<br />
Even his cock had taken quite the blows, although it was still an impressive size, especially for a human, the poor thing was a wreckage of it’s former self, which gave Issac mixed feelings. <br />
<br />
As a paladin, a smaller dick would mean a smaller chance of temptation... yet... as a man and an alpha.... seeing it reduced to almost half it’s thickness was an insult to injury.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, he wouldn’t have to deal with being limbless for long, as he already saw his body begin repairs, the vines making it up twisting and churning as they began the process of healing.<br />
<br />
Issac wasn’t quite sure what to make of his regeneration ability, but he couldn’t deny it’s usefulness.<br />
<br />
For the moment, it seemed that Issac would be stuck sitting under the shade, this definitely wasn’t the Crypt anymore, he was in completely new lands...<br />
<br />
He’d need rest, then once he was ready, he’d start trying to understand what was happening.</p>
