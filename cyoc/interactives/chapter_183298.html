<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a land, there is a silent, living castle. It use to be well visited until it fell under a terrible, perverted curse that turned all of its inhabitants into various &quot;object&quot; by compelling each and every one of them to step into a curious wonder called the black shower. Any thing, be it living or not, that was placed underneath the black shower, would be quickly coated in a film of rubber that would then make their entire form mailable. The curse would then take effect on those unfortunate to fall victim to the black shower, and shape them into objects that either held a sense of irony with the individual, or suited their particular body shape. The worst part would then be the unending drive to be used. For some, this was trivial, but others found this part of the curse to be hell, as no one would really ever use them outside of the maybe once or twice a year that they needed to be.<br />
<br />
Take the head maid for example. She was always a little bit on the slutty side when it came to her work. She got a kick out of teasing the other workers, and especially the master. For him, she wouldn&#39;t hesitate to pleasure him if requested to, sometimes offering herself to be of service to him instead when a dry spell occurred in their fun. So when she was cleaning the castle when she tripped and partially fell into the black shower&#39;s range, which quickly covered both of her arms in the black goop. The curse activated and shaped her left arm into a feather duster. Her right arm however, hollowed out, and her hand molded into a perfect replica of her own pussy, turning her entire right arm, from the elbow down into a device that only served one purpose. To pleasure men with. These days, she is often seen either cleaning or using her new pussy on one of the many men who either can&#39;t do it themselves due to the curse, or to whomever she can find to use her. But with just about the entirety of the castle either women, or fully objectified men, finding a new source of release when her usual users were all spent was always a struggle. She even had stopped wearing clothes all together, as they were just a pain to get on and off without the use of her arms for things like ribbons and buttons. She did wear her high heels quite often though, as those were easier to put on and take off.<br />
<br />
Today, the castle is once again visited by a wandering outsider. This unfortunately happens from time to time. And if the lone wandering maid is not around to stop him or her from touching the black shower, then unfortunately, there is little she can do, but give them a tour and show them around their new home. So when Belle, a lovely, yet curious young woman happened upon the castle, she couldn&#39;t help but snoop around a bit. <br />
<br />
As she was unaware of the curse, or the nature of the Black Shower, when she happened upon it, she walked right through it, slipping and falling down. Only her face remained uncovered after she managed to escape from the black shower. This is when the lone maid finally entered the room after hearing the noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Putain de merde!&quot; She shouted upon seeing the nearly fully coated girl on the ground. She walked over to her and knelt down, being careful not to get too close and risk splashing anymore of the black goop onto herself. &quot;Well, this is unfortunate. But at least you can still see and hear, so I will have someone to talk with now. But unfortunately, that is all we will be doing I am afraid. Well, depending on what you end up as that is. Looks like it is already starting too. Just stay calm, or don&#39;t nothing can save you from this now. Go mad if you want. But I would prefer it if you kept your sanity so that we could converse from time to time. By the way, you can call me Fifi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Belle, and what is going on here? What is up with your arms?&quot; Belle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will know soon enough. But the short of it is that the castle has a curse on it, and you are now the latest victim. Hey, it is starting, you may as well watch it happen, as you may never see it happen again. Of all things considered, it is at least kind of cool to watch. Here, now that you are dry, let me help you move your head so you can see better.&quot; Said Fifi as she used her right arm to lift up Belle&#39;s head. <br />
<br />
Belle and Fifi watched as Belle&#39;s legs shrank back into her body. Her ass absorbed back into her as her pussy stretched out, until it became her entire underside. Then it widened into a large circle. Her pussy soon followed as her entire torso hollowed out and began widening into a bell shape, with her pussy lips becoming the bell&#39;s lips and mouth. Her waist became the bell&#39;s waist and her clitoris detached from the side and fell down towards the middle, suspended by a strand of the rubber, becoming the clapper. <br />
<br />
Her breasts also were undergoing a similar change, as her areolas became her new holes, leaving her nipples poking out of them on a thin rod of the rubber material as both of her entire breasts hollowed out. Her nipples then retracted slightly, and fell limp, as the rubber holding them out gained a joint near its base and the rest hardened, turning into the clapper for her boob bells.<br />
<br />
Her arms became merged above her head, as they became loops to suspend her by. Finally, her hair lengthened extensively, and styled itself to appear similar to a thick rope, now reaching well over 100 feet in length. Her body then hardened, the rubber turning metallic much like how Fifi&#39;s left hand&#39;s rubber turned into actual, pitch black feathers. Belle, had become the castle&#39;s brand new bell. The curse lifted her up and sent her high into the air above the shower, where she was hung from a beam in the vacant bell tower. Form there she could see for miles in about a 150 degree range, which included the front gate of the castle that she had just minutes ago entered through. She could even see the smoke rising from her village&#39;s numerous chimneys off in the distance.<br />
<br />
While she was taking in the sight, she felt a tug on the back of her head and began to tip backwards. Then the tension was released and she swung forwards, until her clit and nipples smacked the opposite ends of their bells, ringing out a loud yet beautiful sound. Again and again as she continued to swing back and fourth, the sound of her clit hitting her pussy lips rang out as her breast bells chimed in occasionally too. And while it was definingly loud, Belle wasn&#39;t effected by it, and to her alone it was not loud at all. She could still hear the chuckling of Fifi below her as she swung from her hair rope around the room, while being careful to avoid the shower at all times. It had been a long time since she was able to preform this stunt, and even longer to learn how to do it. <br />
<br />
Swinging around on a rope without using your hands was a challenge in and of itself, yet she was one of the few who learned how to do it properly. She was always a big hit at parties whenever she pulled this stunt. So this was a nice bit of fun for her. After she had her fun, she began climbing up the many many stairs up to the bell tower where she finally was able to look face to face with Belle the bell again. &quot;So, how does it feel to be a large bell, Miss. Belle?&quot;</p>
