<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charles was an average man with a beautiful wife, a 16-year-old daughter, a 10-year-old son, and a 5-year-old daughter.<br />
<br />
He was busy eating his lunch, when he saw one of the female coworkers pass his vision.<br />
<br />
It was Linda, she was decently attractive, but as he looked at her, something seemed off.<br />
<br />
Did she always have that many freckles? Were her breasts a bit bigger? And was it Charles&#39;s imagination, or did she seem to dance a bit as she walked by?<br />
<br />
She caught him looking at her, but she smiled seductively, blew him a kiss, and walked away playfully swinging her hips which, if Charles didn&#39;t know any better, seemed to have gotten slightly wider!<br />
<br />
He slapped himself in the face. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with me?!&quot; he scolded himself &quot;I&#39;m a married man, and she&#39;s a married woman! Why was she acting like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles looked back down at his lunch, but where a steak had been seconds ago, in it&#39;s place was a salad! Was someone pranking him? He finished it anyway, and it tasted better than he thought it would!<br />
<br />
Charles continued the rest of his work the the best be could, but he kept feeling warm, and having small headaches.<br />
<br />
Finally, he clocked out for the day, and was on his way to his car, but when he got outside, there was Linda standing right next to his car - waiting for him!<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; he asked when he got there. &quot;I just wanted to personally complement you on how cute you&#39;re looking today,&quot; she said smiling &quot;with those freckles and abs - have you been working out?&quot; she brushed some of her hair away, revealing pointy ears! &quot;Linda, your ears!&quot; he told her &quot;What about them?&quot; she asked, smiling flirtatiously &quot;They&#39;re pointy,&quot; he replied &quot;and cute.&quot; he covered his mouth at that. &quot;Thanks!&quot; she told him, &quot;Your ears are cute and pointy too! Hee-hee!&quot; he felt his ears, and they were pointy! &quot;I have to go.&quot; he replied nervously &quot;My wife is expecting me to be home for dinner.&quot; &quot;Then let me know when you&#39;re done - so that I can give you desert - in bed! Hee-hee!&quot; she giggled flirtatiously. Without another word, Charles got in his car, and drove home as fast as he could!<br />
<br />
When he got home, he was greeted by his 10-year-old son Rick, and his 5-year-old daughter Lily. They also had freckles and pointy ears, and they were so happy yo see him!<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got great news, dad!&quot; Rick told his dad happily &quot;I got my first kiss from a girl today, and I liked it!&quot; &quot;And I don&#39;t think boys are gross anymore, daddy!&quot; Lily told her father with a big smile &quot;I met a really cute one today, and I kissed him!&quot; Now Charles was even more worried - this was so unlike them to act this way about the opposite gender at their ages!<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey,&quot; his wife Emma called sweetly &quot;dinner&#39;s ready!&quot;<br />
<br />
They all sat down to eat dinner, which was just vegetables, and Emma also had freckles and pointy ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Lindsey?&quot; Charles asked about his 16-year-old daughter. &quot;She won&#39;t be joining us tonight, dear.&quot; Emma replied, as she ate her food &quot;She sent me a text saying she&#39;ll be staying at her boyfriend&#39;s overnight.&quot; &quot;Why did you let her do that?!&quot; Charles asked Emma &quot;You never let her do that before!&quot; &quot;Well maybe I thought I needed to loosen up a bit.&quot; Emma replied, smiling. Her fingernails then turned black, and so did his, along with his kids&#39;!<br />
<br />
As soon as they were done eating, Emma got up, and told the kids that she and Charles were going up to bed to be alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to make us a new brother or sister?&quot; Rick asked happily. &quot;Can we watch?&quot; Lily asked smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;No dears,&quot; Emma told them &quot;but you can have these.&quot; she gave them each their own set of panpipes, they thanked her, and started playing on them while dancing around the room.<br />
<br />
Finally, Charles and Emma were alone. &quot;Emma,&quot; Charles told her &quot;Things have been weird all day! First Linda flirted with me, then she WANTED me!&quot; &quot;Oh?&quot; Emma asked, completely unphased, then smiled. &quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; &quot;You&#39;re not mad?&quot; Charles asked, confused &quot;No,&quot; she replied, smiling &quot;In fact, I don&#39;t blame her - what woman WOULDN&#39;T want you to herself? Don&#39;t worry about her - I&#39;ll let her have a turn after I&#39;M done with you! Hee-hee!&quot; Charles couldn&#39;t believe his ears - not only was she okay with Linda&#39;s advances toward her husband, but she was willing to share him with her too! &quot;Now would you be a dear and help me out of these jeans?&quot; she asked flirtatiously &quot;They&#39;re feeling warm all of a sudden.&quot; So they stood up, and as he reached to help her out, she helped him out of his pants too, and they found that both of their bodies from the waist down were covered in thick hair! They both lost their balance, fell on the bed, and watched as their legs became reveres-jointed, ending in cloven hooves! They felt they both now had short, stubby tails, and as they faced eachother, they saw that their pupils were rectangle-shaped, they had black goat noses, split upper lips, goat ears, and goat horns!<br />
<br />
Charles was now a satyr, and Emma was now a satyress!<br />
<br />
&quot;Liiiiike to heeeelp meeee taaake the reeeeest of my cloooothes off?&quot; she bleated flirtatiously &quot;Come on Charleyyyyyy! Youuuu knoooooow youuuu waaaaant toooo! Youuu knooow youuu waaaant meeee, so taaaake meeee - I&#39;m yours!&quot;<br />
<br />
This was happening all over the world - men turning into satyrs, women turning into satyresses, and their passions for eachother sky-rocketing! Humanity was becoming one big herd, and loving it!</p>
