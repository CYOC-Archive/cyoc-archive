With the Chronivac Machine all but forgotten...<br />
<br />
Jake slowly rose up off the floor without even having to flap the sleek bat-like black wings protruding from his back.  He spread open the five-foot wing span and checked out their appearance, hovering about a foot above the assorted dirty thongs and stained jockstraps scattered across the floor of his now murky cave-like bedroom lair.<br />
<br />
Jake tested each wing, tilting the left wing slightly downward and flexing strong muscles to move a few feet to the left, then reversing each wing&#39;s angle and muscles to glide back to the right.  At the same time, Jake manipulated the muscles of his four-foot long barbed tail, swinging it upward and down to control his body&#39;s pitch and height.  With subtle twists and turns of his legs and the knee-high black leather boots on his feet, Jake controlled both his airborne speed and stopping distance.<br />
<br />
As dark and slick as the black hair pressed flat against his head, a shiny black pelt of short velvety hairs lined the leathery interior of Jake&#39;s bat-like wings.  Moistened with thick oils and abundant perspiration, the silky black hairs somehow improved his upward lift and maneuverability.  Both wings also helped to cool Jake&#39;s core body temperature from his now normal 185 degrees to something far less noticeable by the humans that he&#39;d been sent to secretly spy on.<br />
<br />
To humans, Jake looked like a cute but very athletic 10-year-old normal human boy.  He closely resembled the movie actor Chase Ellison in his early acting role as Neil McCormick, a sexually abused boy with dyed black hair in the obscure movie, Mysterious Skin.  Except Jake also had curved black ram-like horns, blazing red eyes, a barbed tail, and sleek black bat wings, each completely invisible to the humans who saw him unless he willed them to see his true Incubus demon form.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Jake had permanently altered his own reality on the Chronivac&#39;s settings, unchecking all of its built-in automatic safety features.  The device complied, fully adjusting his memories and existence into a real Incubus demon, replacing his prior human life and altering Jake&#39;s human soul with that of a hell-spawned demon&#39;s soul.<br />
<br />
And although Jake appeared to be a 10-year-old human boy, he was now actually a 10-centuries old demon.  An Incubus.<br />
<br />
With a thought, Jake extended the two lethal weapons his bat-like wings were equipped with, sliding their sharp four-inch long hooked black talons out from hidden wing joints where they could quickly retract when not in use.  Sharper than a diamond and flexible as fine silk whenever he wished it, they could tear through any known metal and crush stone without much effort.  Yet, with just a thought from Jake&#39;s mind, each talon could become soft as a ball of cotton, or ticklish as a peacock&#39;s feather.<br />
<br />
As an Incubus, Jake preferred using his wings to fly through the air even though his demonic kind didn&#39;t need them for the simple act of flight.<br />
<br />
But they were useful for several other things, too.  In addition to cooling his body&#39;s temperature, his bat shaped wings created flexible, inescapable restraints to hold onto and imprison a struggling captive, or caress a mesmerized lover&#39;s tender flesh.  His wings were even stronger than his powerful arms and four-foot long barbed tail.  They were also used to mark his prey, transferring his own boyishly strong scents into their skin and hair as a warning to other demons from the Nether Regions of Ancient Hell and the current Hell&#39;s Ether, that this human was already enslaved and owned by him.<br />
<br />
And Jake knew as he circled and swooped down at them from the night sky, the sight and sound of his fluttering bat wings would terrify his human prey, making them believe he was a boy-size vampire bat creature thirsty for warm human blood.<br />
<br />
But Jake didn&#39;t crave a human&#39;s blood like a vampire.  He needed something much more important from human males to survive.  Something much deeper and harder to siphon out of their fragile lifeforms than the warm red sustenance a vampire&#39;s painful bite and noisy blood-sucking feast extracted.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s kind craved male human souls; a small, ethereal wisp of living energy to merge and fuse into his own blackened soul.  Sometimes, Jake would replace what he drained with just a faint trace of the dark tainted essence flowing within himself to convert and transform his chosen prey into submissive slaves.<br />
<br />
But when Jake desired them for something far more satisfying than just using them for his sexually demonic pleasures, he&#39;d replace a little bit more of his black soul and permanently change them into a human Incubus called an Initiate Incubus.<br />
<br />
An Initiate Incubus had very weak limited powers.  Once Jake gained his full powers, he&#39;d be able to supply the newly made Initiate Incubus with the barbed tail and bat wings of another Hellspawn demon beast.  Then they&#39;d gain its powers without the danger of luring a dangerous demon into a Chamber of Hell Pod where an Initiate was often tricked into swapping their human soul with the demon&#39;s.  If their souls were exchanged, they&#39;d be called back to the Hell Pits, completely feral and grossly mutated, forever enslaved in Hell with the demon possessing their corrupted human soul.<br />
<br />
Because he was still a young student of the Nether, a child demon of 10, Jake needed some of their human fluids inside his own body, as well as implanting his own fluids inside them in order to completely control and dominate them.<br />
<br />
And Jake craved their living human essence inside himself, his Incubus lusts demanding he feast on their sexually aroused stimulated hormones and fluids as his only food and life source.<br />
<br />
Jake glanced down past the tiny grooves and faint ridges beginning to reveal some muscle on his hairless chest and boyish abdomen.  He was already drooling from the feel of the small bulge tenting his favorite black leather thong, and he reached down to adjust his rapidly swelling wrinkly tube of uncut skin to give it a little more growing room.  Jake was fully erect within seconds, pushing a pleasantly stiff boner against the lining of his thong&#39;s tight leather pouch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta go get me a human&#39;s soul,&quot; Jake giggled, pinching the tiny stiffened nipples on his chest.  He excitedly rubbed his heated hands across his sweaty abdomen.  &quot;Then the Nether will reward me with all of my Incubus powers and I&#39;ll become way more strong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silently dropping down onto the floor and tucking his wings back behind his shoulders with a leathery rustling sound, Jake stepped toward the window and willed it to slide open with a thought.  He crawled through the opening, perched himself on the wood sash, and slowly raised his small flared nose to inhale the inviting darkness of dusk&#39;s rapid approach.<br />
<br />
There were several humans nearby.  One of them instantly increased his ravenous Incubus lusts, and Jake leaped from the third-story window, swiftly unfurling both wings as his bedroom lair&#39;s window slid shut.<br />
<br />
Jake silently soared upward into the darkening night sky.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s demon senses quickly zeroed in on his chosen target&#39;s location.<br />
<br />
The child Incubus Demon Jacob Mark Williams selected to feast on the human soul of...</p>
