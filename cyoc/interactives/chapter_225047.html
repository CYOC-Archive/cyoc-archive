<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madame Illusia didn&#39;t like Monica&#39;s tone. &quot;Mam. I don&#39;t like your tone. No one calls Madame Illusia a bitch and gets away with it. You need to be punished.&quot;  And with that, Monica tried to hit Madame Illusia, but simply froze in mid-strike.  &quot;Now that I have you on pause, so to speak, I can show you who the real bitch is, Monica!&quot;, replied Madame Illusia with a sneer.  &quot;What the hell!  I can&#39;t mrooove!  Bark bark bark bark.&quot;, said Monica before whimpering like a dog.  &quot;You know, Monica, bitches like you don&#39;t wear clothes, in fact, they don&#39;t know what clothes are at all or how to put them on.  Instead, they wear a collar with a tag with their owner&#39;s name and address on it.  Many of them get a microchip implanted in them so that they can be tracked and returned to their owner if they get lost and picked up by the municipal pound.  Some also wear a muzzle or a harness with leash.  For you, Monica, I think you&#39;d be fitting in the entire package!&quot;, explained Madame Illusia.  And so, the crowd watched as Monica&#39;s clothes faded away right along with her knowledge of how to dress herself and the names of the different types of clothes to wear.  In the place of her clothes, she felt a muzzle form around her head as necklace turned into a purple dog collar with a tag stating her name as well as Madame Illusia&#39;s name and address on it.  She felt a momentary stinging sensation while a microchip was implanted in her neck so that she could be found easily if she ran off.  Across her chest, she watched as a purple harness appeared and snapped into place along her back where she couldn&#39;t reach it to unsnap it.  However, Monica didn&#39;t know what she was wearing, what it was for, or how to get it off.  Madame Illusia then walked up to Monica and snapped a leash on her harness near her back.  &quot;You know, Monica, for a bitch, I find it funny that at least you know one trick.  Most bitches can&#39;t walk because their legs can&#39;t support the weight.&quot;  Monica then felt her knees give out and fell to the floor.  She also discovered that she could move again and began to get on her hands and knees to crawl.  She didn&#39;t get far though because she was tethered to the leash in Madame&#39;s hand.  &quot;You know, Monica, bitches are used for breeding and are ready to mate with whoever is presented to them.&quot; said Madame Illusia.  Monica started to smell things.  She could smell every man as well as every dog at the carnival.  She became aroused at thinking about all the dick she could stuff in her mouth as well as her pussy as her pussy drooled down her leg and onto the floor of the stage.  She could care less if the dick belonged to a human or a dog.  She wanted both really bad!  &quot;Monica, bitches like you are stupid!  They don&#39;t understand math or science, or literature.  They have no clue what numbers and letters are.  They don&#39;t know how to speak any language and can only bark, howl, or wine.  But, that won&#39;t matter to you as you go about your life smelling asses, looking for dog or man cock to bury in your mouth or pussy and eating cold beef stew and drinking tepid water from large bowls with only your mouth as your utensil.&quot;, continued Madame.  At that point, mental changes started to happen in Monica&#39;s mind as she was stripped of all education, her ability to understand human language.  She didn&#39;t care about expensive things anymore.  She didn&#39;t even know what expensive meant.  She only wanted to be a good girl for Madame Illusia and feel a nice warm hard cock in her mouth and pussy and be filled with delicious cum.  While a stage hand brought up a collie on stage and led him behind Monica, Madame Illusia asked if there was a a man with a large cock who wanted a free blow job.  A rough and tall redneck walked up on stage and stood in front of Monica, unzipped his fly and pulled out his monstrous man meat.  It smelled like heaven to Monica as she started to lick the tip of his erect ten inch penis.  Meanwhile, behind Monica the collie started to sniff her butt and then proceeded to put its front paws on Monica&#39;s back.  In her mind, Monica was filled with lust and anticipation.   And so, when the dog plunged his beautiful engorged penis into her hungry pussy, Monica gasped before plunging the man&#39;s cock deep inside her mouth and working his shaft with her tongue as she bobbed up and down.  after a bit of time, both the dog and the man orgasmed at the same time spewing their cum into Monica.  The salty taste of cum in her mouth as she swallowed and the thought that she may have puppies soon caused her to have a massive orgasm of her own causing her to quake with pleasure.  The man pulled out of her mouth, zipped up her pants, and gave her a light pat on her head, however, the dog&#39;s penis was locked in her pussy so tight that it made her feel delightfully full.  When the dog finally pulled out, a stage hand simply took the leashes of both the collie and Monica and walked them off stage and out of the tent to Monica&#39;s new home at Madame&#39;s private kennel.  As she entered the kennel, she again became aroused and was ready for another round with a different dog.  Damon, though, never noticed a thing.  he was too engrossed in his toys to care about what was happening on stage.  He never felt when Madame erased his entire memory with Monica making it so that it seemed like he&#39;d never met her.  He didn&#39;t seem to mind.</p>
