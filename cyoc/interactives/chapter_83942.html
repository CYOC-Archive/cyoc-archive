<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric opened his mouth and Kyle swung, his fist connecting with the side of Eric&#39;s head.  Eric dropped back onto the floor, out cold as Kyle stood up and shook out the pain in his hand.  Lucky, it didn&#39;t feel like he broke anything on Eric&#39;s thick skull.  He sat on the edge of Eric&#39;s bed, watching the clock on the nightstand slowly tick away the minute.  Maybe it was cheating, maybe it wouldn&#39;t work, but Kyle wanted to make sure Eric got the full experience.  Once the minute was up, he grabbed a half drunk glass of water off the nightstand and splashed it in Eric&#39;s face.  He woke up sputtering.  &quot;Dare!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo... Too late.  Sorry.&quot;  Eric glared at Kyle and jumped to his feet, but he was still woozy and stumbled back down to the carpet, landing on his ass.<br />
<br />
Eric settled for spitting at his former friend.  &quot;Cheater.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After what you did. Fuck yeah.&quot;  Kyle leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees.  &quot;See, I thought since we were friends so long, you&#39;d accept me for who I was.  Guess that&#39;s beyond your bigoted ass.  You took away everything I liked, but you know what?  I&#39;m going to be a lot nicer to you.&quot;  Eric suddenly looked hopeful, but Kyle just laughed.  &quot;Oh, I&#39;m still going to fuck around with you, don&#39;t get me wrong.  I&#39;m just not going to take away everything that you are.  Just some of it, and as far as I&#39;m concerned, the worse parts.&quot;  Kyle smiled at Eric, but it didn&#39;t have much warmth to it, it looked positively evil.  &quot;So what&#39;d you think?  Since I&#39;m gay I was going to start trying to get into bed with you?  You&#39;re not my type.. Well, you&#39;re close, but not quite.&quot;  Kyle was hoping in the back of his mind the transform would take.  Eric had said dare, and who knows if the curse would take being knocked out as a reason for the answer being late.  &quot;So, for your transformation, you&#39;re going to become my type.  Well, the eighteen year old version anyway.  You&#39;ll have to wait a few years to really get to the type of man I really like.  You&#39;ll still look mostly like you, just with some.. additions.  Everyone but who&#39;s in this room is going to think this is the normal you, nothing out of the ordinary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen had been eavesdropping the whole time through Kyle&#39;s eyes and ears.  And she was furious, &quot;He did this to you and he gets to be your personal wetdream and I end up your cock?  Fucking bastard...&quot;  Kyle laughed at the outburst in his head, just settling in to give himself and Jen a good show.<br />
<br />
Eric looked stunned, gaping like a fish out of water.  &quot;I.. I..&quot;  Eric fell back as a mix of pain and pleasure washed over him, his back arching off the carpet as a small moan escaped his mouth.  His muscles were twitching under his skin, slowly expanding.  Eric was already in really good shape, toned and cut, but it didn&#39;t seem to be enough for Kyle&#39;s tastes.  His flat pecs pushed out into rounder mounds of dense muscle.  His abdomen tightened as the muscles there were hit by the transformation, the definition of his six pack cutting deeper, perhaps the faint appearance of an eight pack forming.  The muscle growth spread out towards Eric&#39;s arms and legs, veins popping out along his flexed muscles.<br />
<br />
Kyle stood up off the edge of the bed, and walked to stand over the transforming Eric, already pleased by the changes if the obscene tent in his borrowed exercise shorts was any indication.  Inside his mind, Jen was practically quivering, ever brush of fabric against her cock body was almost too much to handle.  Kyle knelt down next to Eric,  &quot;Let me help you with that.&quot;  He undid the fly on Eric&#39;s jeans, peeling them down his thickened legs, exposing the teens entire nude, transforming body.  Eric was trying to protest the undressing, but with the change wracking his body, all attempts were futile at best.  His six inch cock was standing fully erect, so stiff it pointed straight up at the ceiling, a tricks of pre running down the shaft and dripping into his pubes.  As Kyle and Jen watched, Eric&#39;s cock looked to be getting bigger.  It grew slowly longer and thicker, the hints of a foreskin growing back appearing under the plump red head of the swelling cock.  Kyle liked everything about his guys big.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s clean-cut black hair started to grow a little shaggy, a little less neatly trimmed and combed.  His thin dark eyebrows thickened.  The faint stubble along his jaw thickened, his sparse teenage beard growth filling in a little more.  The stubble grew in along his checks, and a bit down his neck.  A scruffy goatee grew in on his chin, making him look a little older than his eighteen years.  Around his now nine inch cock, his trimmed pubes began to spread, taking up more over his crotch area, darkening his balls and the lower part of his shaft.  The faint treasure trail between his cock and navel thickened, dark hair spreading along his lower stomach, and up past his belly button, reaching for the bit of hair between his pecs.<br />
<br />
The dark hair on his arms and legs got a bit more dense, a dusty coat of black hair growing up his thighs and over his muscular bubble butt.  Eric was writhing on the ground by know, enough strength returning to his arms that he was able to reach down and wrap his hands around his massive cock.  He pumped it with both hands, each stroke seeming to squeeze more and more length and girth out of the already impressive organ.  Jen couldn&#39;t help thinking what a size queen Kyle was.  First his own massive cock, now the one growing right in front of them.  Hairs began growing in around Eric&#39;s firm nipples, the patch of hair in the center of his chest spreading out towards the new growth.  It spread quickly until the entire lower half of his pecs were covered in a light coat of dark hair.  Quite a bit for someone Eric&#39;s age, and likely to grow even more over the coming years, a practical muscle bear in the making.  Eric arched his back, his eleven inch monster spraying gob after gob of thick white cum across his new hairy torso.<br />
<br />
Eric felt the rush of the change leave him and stumbled to his feet as Kyle slowly backed off.  He was still shorter than Kyle by a few inches, but he was heavier, more muscular.  Eric&#39;s lean body had been replaced by something stockier.  His features were still his, just with a shaggier, less groomed air.  &quot;You fuck!&quot;  Eric started to progress on Kyle, his hands balling into fists.<br />
<br />
Kyle didn&#39;t look all that intimidated.  &quot;Forgot about the dare?&quot;  Eric continued to advance on Kyle, who said in a rush, &quot;I dare you to become my loving, loyal and completely gay boyfriend, until I choose to release you.&quot;  Eric kept advancing, looking like a thunderhead.  Though the moment Kyle was with in his reach, instead of punching him, he pulled the other young man into a tight embrace, heedless of the drying cum along his body, pushing his mouth roughly against one open slightly in shock.  Kyle slowly gave into the kiss, at least until Eric broke it to push Kyle down on the bed.<br />
<br />
Eric knelt down before Kyle, roughly pulling down the elastic banded shorts, revealing his foot long monster cock, the head already glistening from his arousal.  Kyle shivered, echoed by Jen as Eric slowly lowered his mouth onto the thick shaft.  He bobbed up and down, able to take half the cocks length down his throat.  Kyle lay back on the bed, moaning in ecstasy.  He felt Eric&#39;s hands on his balls, slowly caressing them, stroking them as he continues to tend to the shaft with his tongue, almost tenderly.  Kyle had to shove Jen down into the depths of his mind, her own feelings of pleasure threatening to overwhelm his thoughts.  He finally had what he wanted, he wanted to enjoy it alone.  Eric sucked the shaft like an expert, the formerly straight male performing like he&#39;d been doing blow jobs for years.<br />
<br />
Kyle felt the twisting pleasure of orgasm running through his body, his cock unloading a small river of cum into Eric&#39;s eagerly waiting mouth, who managed to swallow most of it eagerly.  He pulled his mouth off the dribbling cock, sliding his muscular body up Kyle&#39;s and met his lips, sharing a salty, musky kiss with him, sharing the flavor of Kyle&#39;s cum with him.  When the kiss finally broke, Kyle looked at Eric, still a little surprised to see his altered friend before him.  &quot;So.. not mad anymore?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric shook his head, &quot;After what I did to you, this is more than I deserve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle breathed a sigh of relief, his dare having seemed to work perfectly.  For a moment he let his mind wander, thinking of what else he could do with this hunk who was now hopelessly in love with him.</p>
