<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate found Ben hanging out just outside the front entrance to the school. Nate walked over and greeted Ben, who looked up from his cellphone. Ben smiled at Nate. <br />
<br />
&quot;All ready to go?&quot; asked Ben. Nate nodded in response. &quot;Good, my car is over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate followed Ben in the direction he was walking. &quot;You have a car? I wish I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, it&#39;s my Mom&#39;s old car. They gave it to me because the trade in value was shit but it still ran good.&quot; Ben led Nate to the car, a late 90&#39;s sedan. It was still in good shape though so he could see why they decided to just keep it. &quot;Get in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate got into the car and fastened his seatbelt. Ben got in on the drivers side and fastened his as well before starting the car. The radio clicked on immediately, playing the local top 40&#39;s radio station. With that, they were off. The drive to Ben&#39;s house was uneventful. Nate couldn&#39;t help but feel nervous. Ben seemed like a nice enough of a guy but he had no idea what he was walking into here by going to Ben&#39;s house. He knew about his two moms and that they were werecats, but he had never been in a werecreature&#39;s house before. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder what it was like. He also started to notice they were taking the same way home he did from school. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you live near me?&quot; asked Nate. <br />
<br />
&quot;As a matter of fact I do. Just a half a mile or so down the road from you,&quot; replied Ben.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; replied Nate. Nate watched as they drove past his house and continued on to Ben&#39;s. In a few moments, they were parked in front of the house. Much like Nate&#39;s it was set back among the trees with a large hill running behind the houses. <br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you could find a perch up on that hill there and be able to watch your neighbors all day or all night and they&#39;d never know you were there,&quot; said Nate. <br />
<br />
Ben let out a laugh. Nate had no idea. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go inside.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nate was surprised walking into the Twist residence that their house was decorated much like any other early 21st century suburban home would be. Tasteful yet functional decorations, with more of Pottery Barn than IKEA theme to it, thankfully, which fit with the country home aesthetic they clearly developed. He really liked it. Ben set down his backpack on the dining room table and called out to his Moms with no response. <br />
<br />
He turned to Nate, &quot;I guess we&#39;re alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so.&quot; Nate was really beginning to feel nervous now. What was he supposed to say in a situation like this? He decided to just follow Ben&#39;s lead. Ben walked into the family room and looked around trying to decide how he wanted to do things. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you take a seat there and we&#39;ll go ahead and get started,&quot; said Ben. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Nate took the seat he was directed to. He watched as Ben pulled off his t-shirt revealing a rather muscular chest underneath. Nate couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit excited by this. Nate had often been questioning his sexuality and Ben&#39;s heaving, muscular chest seemed to all but confirm it. As Ben slowly undid his jeans and slid them off, Nate quietly picked up a throw pillow and placed it over his lap. <br />
<br />
Ben closed his eyes and took a deep breath as the transformation started. Nate watched with rapt fascination as Ben&#39;s fingernails slowly grew out into claws as chestnut brown hair began to grow in. Every muscle in his body seemed to be shaking and spasming as they slowly reformed. He watched as Ben&#39;s feet stretched and reformed into digitigrade paws.  His eyes traveled up, past his genital area as his penis had now grown into a furred sheath up past his chest as it was barreling out to Ben&#39;s face. He gave Nate a toothy smile, showing off the sharp fangs that had grown in. My god, he&#39;s actually enjoying this, thought Nate. Nate was shocked by the sight. It was one thing to see it in a cheesy movie, but to see such a dramatic transformation in person was something else entirely. He watched in awe as Ben&#39;s face slowly pushed out into a lupine snout and his ears grew to points as they shifted to the top of his head. As the transformation finished, Ben walked over and got down on one knee so Nate could check him out more closely. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my.&quot; Nate reached out and gave Ben a friendly scratch behind the ear. Ben leaned forward and began to nuzzle Nate. He gave him small, soft licks on the base of his neck which were about enough to make him come right there. Picking up the scent, Ben backed away and looked right at him with his now amber eyes. Nate stared right back and whispered, &quot;Are you smiling Ben?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello boys,&quot; an older female voice interrupted them both. They both looked up to see Samantha standing in the doorway. They both had a look of absolute panic on their faces. <br />
<br />
&quot;We were just...we were just...&quot; stammered Nate, looking at Samantha. <br />
<br />
&quot;She knows what we were doing,&quot; replied Ben, in a deeper, more gutteral voice.<br />
<br />
Nate looked back at Ben, &quot;You can talk?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I can talk. Why wouldn&#39;t I be able to talk?&quot; asked Ben as if that were the most ridiculous question he&#39;d ever been asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, it&#39;s a good thing you stopped by Nate, you and I need to have a talk about what you&#39;ve decided.&quot; Samantha took a seat next to Nate on the couch. &quot;Isn&#39;t he such a gorgeous wolf. Stand up Ben and show Nate you back side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben stood up again and turned around, revealing some lovely patches of black and gray fur on his back, leading down to a nice fluffy tail that curved outward slightly at the bottom. Nate couldn&#39;t help but smile at the sight of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he is quite gorgeous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what you&#39;ll look like after your first change. That is, if you still want to do it,&quot; replied Samantha. <br />
<br />
Nate nodded enthusiastically, &quot;Oh yes, that I most certainly do.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, I will make all the arrangements for your transformation ceremony at city hall tomorrow night.&quot; Samantha got up and began walking back out of the room. She stopped and turned back. &quot;Now, you two boys behave.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two boys looked at each other and just laughed. Nate reached over and ran his fingers through Ben&#39;s thick, soft fur coat and tried to imagine what his would look like.</p>
