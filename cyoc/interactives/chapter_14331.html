<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben woke up on the floor of his bedroom at 7 AM as a single slit of sunlight shot through his curtains and onto his face. Groaning tiredly, Ben rolled over and suddenly realised how cold he was. It was no surprise, he thought; he was only wearing his red boxer shorts. Ben collapsed into his bed and pulled the covers over his body and fell back asleep.<br />
<br />
An hour later, Ben snapped awake again to the slamming of the front door.<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Ben exclaimed, hurriedly clambering out of bed and becoming tangled in the sheets. Ben looked at his wrist watch, but it wasn't on his arm where he could have sworn he had left it. It must have slipped off during the night, Ben considered. He looked at his bedside clock where the red display was flashing 8:00 AM. <br />
&quot;Bloody hell; late again...&quot; Ben muttered as he slid his arms into his white school shirt. Before buttoning it up, Ben was already tugging his grey school pants up his legs. Not even bothering to put on socks, Ben jammed his feet into his black shoes and snatched his school bag up from the ground, along with his blazer and tie hanging on the door knob to his room. Something nagged at the back of his mind, as if he had forgotten something.<br />
&quot;Must've been lunch then, but I don't have time for that,&quot; Ben guessed aloud, and he didn't give the feeling a second thought.<br />
Within seconds Ben was running down the street towards school, his shirt flailing open in the wind.<br />
<br />
Ben arrived at school at 8:10, hearing the final bell ringing throughout the school yard to indicate that classes had just begun. Ben walked quickly through the school corridors, not wanting to attract attention to himself by running. He noticed that his shirt was still open, and quickly buttoned it up and did up his tie. Taking a deep breath, he opened his class room door and slid into the noisy room. Mr Shaw, Ben's teacher was shouting loudly over the din. Ben swiftly moved to the seat next to Luke towards the middle of the class and sat down, placing his blazer over the chair.<br />
&quot;BEN!&quot; Mr Shaw shouted. Ben winced; he'd been caught late. He slowly turned around to face Mr Shaw who didn't sound happy.  <br />
&quot;Is Ben here?!&quot; Mr Shaw called again. Ben breathed a sigh of relief. <br />
&quot;Right here, sir!&quot; Ben called.<br />
&quot;Oh, there you are...&quot; Mr Shaw muttered, marking the book in front of him. There were some snickers from the students who had noticed Ben walking in just now, but no one told Mr Shaw. Most of the students were afraid of what Mr Shaw'd do to someone if they were in trouble, even if it wasn't them who was in trouble. He was in his late twenties with short dark brown hair and whilst was nice when he was in a good mood, he could be completely ferocious at the drop of a hat, often smashing his black-board ruler across his desk if he felt the class was being too noisy. Sure enough, within a minute, it seemed that the class noise had gotten to him, and he slowly drew the ruler out from the board, gazing deftly around the room before stoutly whacking the ruler several times across his desk. Everyone fell silent in an excited fear. Mr Shaw glared around the room and closed the book on his table.<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; Mr Shaw announced quietly, starting up the lesson.<br />
<br />
An hour and a half later, Maths with Mr Shaw had finished. The class filed out of the room, a dull chattering echoing around them. <br />
&quot;Hey Ben, what do we have next?&quot; Luke asked.<br />
&quot;Uh...PE, I think,&quot; Ben answered. Suddenly, Ben remembered the nagging feeling he had had that morning.<br />
&quot;SHIT!&quot; Ben swore loudly.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Luke asked, pulling a bag of chips from his blazer pocket and opening them carefully.<br />
&quot;I forgot my sport's gear,&quot; Ben moaned. <br />
&quot;Ha ha!&quot; Luke laughed. &quot;You're in deep shit. Mc Lellan said at the end of last week's class he'd be handing out detentions this week to anyone without their stuff.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know...&quot; Ben said. Just his luck; he'd brought it every other week this year, but the one day he didn't bring his gear was coincidently the same day Mr Mc Lellan, the PE teacher, promised detentions for those who had forgotten the correct sport clothing.<br />
&quot;Shit...&quot; Ben muttered angrily at his own forgetfulness. Ben tried to create some plan in his head to get around him getting a detention...maybe he could just skip class? No, he thought dismissively, Mr Mc Lellan would be marking their names off the list and would be sure to notice his absence. As Ben mulled over more ideas, each as poor as the last, they drew closer and closer toward the school gym, and in no time at all, the bell rang to signal the next class had just started.<br />
<br />
Ben sat down in the crowded changing room, guys everywhere taking off their school clothes and changing into their blue shorts, white t-shirts and runners. Ben gazed desperately around the room, looking for some form of savior to help him out. Then, without knowing why, Ben stood up and began sifting slowly through the crowded change room to the opposite wall. He stopped in front of a sport's bag from a student who was probably already in class, because no one was standing near it besides Ben. He wasn't sure why, but something in the bag had dragged him over there. Ben glanced around the room, but no one was paying any attention to him. He sat down on the bench next to the bag, and with a shaking hand, Ben slowly opened the zipper. A sweet and mysterious smell burst into his nostrils. Ben looked at the mostly half naked students who were huddled in a circle, laughing at jokes. He leant over the bag and looked at its contents, and began withdrawing pieces of the school uniform and dropping them carelessly onto the change room floor. Pants...socks...tie...blazer...Ben was picking up the pace now, he felt close to whatever he was searching for. Then, his fingers touched something soft and smooth, and Ben's heart began to race.<br />
<br />
As if disarming a bomb, Ben slowly pulled out the object from the bag and placed it in his lap carefully. It was a school Speedo; its rust colored material shimmering in the soft light. Ben looked up, and was surprised to see that the change room had already emptied in the last few minutes. Ben raised the Speedo and inhaled a deep breath, coughing a little at the musk surrounding it. Ben was considering taking off his clothes and putting it on, when suddenly the door burst open. It was Mr Mc Lellan.<br />
“Anyone still in here?” he asked loudly. Ben stuffed the Speedo back into the bag and stood up.<br />
“Sir…?” Ben asked cautiously.<br />
“Ben, where’s your gear?”<br />
“Sorry, sir. I kind of forgot it today, but I promise it won’t happen again,” Ben replied.<br />
“I trust it won’t. Sorry Ben, but I have to give you a detention. That’s the rules,” Mr Mc Lellan apologized, and shortly afterward left the room. Sighing, Ben went to Mr Mc Lellan’s office and sat down in one of the chairs, awaiting the teacher to arrive. He could hear the thumps of basketballs on the courts behind the gym mixed with excited laughter. To hide his overwhelming shame, Ben distracted himself by looking around the room. A few dodge balls littered the floor…a few medical posters were hung up at odd angles across the walls. Ben stretched over Mc Lellan’s desk and read off the magazine titles that were strewn across it. Golfing Today…Athlete’s World…Weight Lifting…<br />
Ben paused at the last one and slid it over. On the cover was a muscular man and woman, posing in bikinis and flexing. Ben felt his penis react to the picture, making him feel slightly more aroused. The office door flew open, forcing Ben to tear his eyes away from the bulging muscles. <br />
<br />
“Ben, what’s been happening with you lately? You seem so distant and you’re gradually dropping in class effort…” Mr Mc Lellan explained. Ben’s eyes slid back down onto the magazine, and gradually, even further down until his eyes lay fixated on his own erection, pushing forcibly against his zipper.<br />
“…what’s been going on at home, Ben?”<br />
“Er…I’ve just been going through some…” Ben felt the strain of his penis separating his zipper, “…changes,” Ben gulped.<br />
“Yeah, I know all about puberty. I work at an all boy’s school, don’t I?” Mc Lellan laughed.<br />
Ben pretended to laugh too, but was distracted by the further strain of his chest against his white school shirt. He could see muscular skin protruding from the gaps in between buttons.<br />
“…the throbbing hormones…the sudden development of an uncontrollable sexual desire…”<br />
At these words, Ben began to feel faint. A drip of sweat formed on his forehead and his crotch began to feel warm.<br />
“…body and hair growth…changing into a man…” <br />
A button suddenly sprang off Ben’s shirt and flew right toward Mr Mc Lellan’s face. He whacked it away instinctively before it hit and stood up in surprise.<br />
“Is this some kind of joke, Ben? Your shirt is far too small…”<br />
But Ben had as little idea of what was going on as Mr Mc Lellan. <br />
“Ben, oh my God; you’re choking!” Mr Mc Lellan shouted, rushing next to Ben’s side and easing down his tie. As if feeling the tension, Mc Lellan stood over Ben’s body and tore apart the shirt for Ben, releasing a large, muscular chest.<br />
“Shit…” Mc Lellan muttered, eyeing Ben’s abs. “This must be some kind of growth spurt…”<br />
Ben, moaning loudly, slid his belt out of his school pants. Barely affronted, Mr Mc Lellan picked up a hand towel from his desk and wiped Ben’s forehead for him. Then, he moved over to the phone and began searching for a phone number on a pad next to it.<br />
<br />
“Sir…?” Ben asked, as he realized that his pants were too tight.<br />
“Just a second,” came the reply. Ben’s pants split apart, but Mr Mc Lellan was hurriedly dialing a number. Ben looked across at Mr Mc Lellan and had the sudden urge to kiss him. Gripping at the sides of his chair, Ben lifted himself up and stumbled across the room. Halfway across, Ben’s tattered pants fell to his ankles and slid off. <br />
“Ben, I’m just calling…oh my!” Mr Mc Lellan exclaimed as Ben stood directly behind him. Where had been a muscular teenager not 2 minutes ago now stood a perfectly built 20-something year old in nothing but a small pair of red boxer shorts. <br />
“B-ben? This is amazing…” Mr Mc Lellan stuttered. Ben didn’t reply, and smiled ominously instead.<br />
“C’mon, we had better get those boxer shorts off of you. If we leave them on, they could cut off your circulation to your body, and we don’t want that to happen,” Mr Mc Lellan explained.<br />
Ben made no motion to take them off.<br />
“Um…do you – can’t you do it?”<br />
Ben shook his head.<br />
“Here, let me help,” Mr Mc Lellan offered. He slowly slid to his knees and lowered the waist of the boxer shorts. Surprisingly, they weren’t cutting into Ben’s thighs at all.<br />
“This is odd,” he murmured. “It’s almost as if your underwear has altered to accommodate your body, Ben.”<br />
“Really?” came the deep reply of Ben.<br />
“Yes, in fact, they look like the very fibers of material are changing too. See?” Mr Mc Lellan rubbed the boxer shorts material between two fingers.<br />
“They feel like…like…like spandex. Sort of like a Speedo, actually…” Mr Mc Lellan looked up at Ben to see his reaction to all of this, but he made no movement.<br />
“Ben?” Mr Mc Lellan made to stand up, but Ben suddenly threw his hands onto Mr Mc Lellan’s shoulders.<br />
“Wha-what are you doing?” Mr Mc Lellan asked.<br />
Ben kept one hand balanced on Mc Lellan’s left shoulder, and used his right hand to lower his Speedo/shorts. Mr Mc Lellan gasped slightly, of fear, disgust and in some sick way, awe. The sight of Ben’s large erection froze Mr Mc Lellan on the spot. Ben moved his left hand so the palm was cradling the back of Mc Lellan’s paralysed head, running his fingers through the soft hair. Then, without any warning, Ben thrust his penis forward into Mr Mc Lellan’s mouth and came instantaneously. Using both hands, Ben forced Mc Lellan’s mouth to remain around his cock. Mr Mc Lellan moaned and choked for a full minute before Ben eventually let go. Mc Lellan drooped forward further and rolled into Ben’s hairless legs. Satisfied, Ben adjusted his newly forged red Speedo so it sat properly around his erection. Mc Lellan still had a drop of cum stuck to the edge of his lips, Ben had noticed. He knelt down and let his tongue clean it away, before entering it into Mc Lellan’s mouth. As if gaining consciousness once more, Mc Lellan began to put up a fight, struggling uselessly as Ben slowly wrapped his arms and legs around Mc Lellan’s own, pinning him down. Between half moans, Mr Mc Lellan felt Ben’s muscular body loosen its hold. To his horror though, Mr Mc Lellan discovered he no longer wanted to escape. Grinning, Mr Mc Lellan cupped Ben’s ass through the tight Speedos. Ben slid Mc Lellan’s pants down a little to squeeze his own ass through his briefs, and made his own discovery; Mr Mc Lellan was also wearing a red Speedo.</p>
