<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave set his boxed possessions on his new desk and fished out the slip of paper.  Under &#39;I&#39;ll get a promotion today&#39; he wrote &#39;I have a Rolex wristwatch.&#39;<br />
He glanced around the room and at his wrist, but when nothing happened he snorted and began unpacking and settling into his office.  A few minutes later Jodie ushered in some guys from IT who&#39;d come to set up his new computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey, is this yours?&quot;  The tech guy running cables under his desk backed out holding a shiny Rolex watch which he handed to Dave.<br />
<br />
He turned it over, on the back it was inscribed  &#39;DLB May 2012&#39; which was when he&#39;d received his MBA.  He felt dizzy as he suddenly remembered receiving it was a surprise gift from his parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha yes, I dropped it when I was moving stuff in and didn&#39;t want to get dusty fishing it out.&quot;  Dave lied clumsily.  He strapped in on, noting his wrist showed clear tan lines where he typically wore it.  The tech guy had already dived back under the desk and the other was unpacking a ridiculously large flatscreen monitor.  <br />
<br />
Dave picked up the pen and scrap of paper from the desk as he made room for the computer set-up.  Still marveling at his new memories he moved out of the way and watched the guys work before having a sudden thought.  He turned the paper over and wrote &#39;the employees installing my computer are both beautiful, busty young women.&#39;  He blinked and glanced over as the one backed out from under the desk, her shapely ass wiggling from side to side.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m done down here Bri, how are you doing?&quot;  She brushed some dust off the knees of her tan slacks and tugged at the hem of her top.  She had dusky skin, short brunette hair, warm brown eyes, and was wearing a lacy camisole filling the deep v-neck of her blouse.  She also had and a series of tiny earrings in her right ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can start on the docking station Angie.&quot;  Bri said as she flipped her long blond ponytail over one shoulder.  She had classic Scandanavian looks: fair complexion with a dusting of freckles, blue eyes and a fine bone structure.  She was wearing a thin sweater top tight enough that Dave thought he could draw a structural map of the bra holding up her very large breasts.  Not that Angie was lacking in that department either; without the camisole her cleavage alone would be enough to be written up for a dress code violation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Dave said, trying to be casual, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you two around the building before?&quot;<br />
<br />
The women looked at each other for a moment before Bri turned to speak to him.  &quot;No sir, we only handle manager-level IT issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, call me &#39;Dave&#39;, I just got promoted today and hearing &#39;sir&#39; makes me think Joe Ross is standing behind me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well congratulations &#39;Dave&#39;, we&#39;ll get this set up and then get you settled into your office.&quot;  Both were focused on their work, backs tense and jaws clenched.<br />
<br />
Dave frowned.  He couldn&#39;t very well ask them about their personal lives, but he was curious how widespread the changes caused by the pen were.  Did they have HR files, college transcripts, childhood friends  who remembered them as women?  Or had the pen just changed the bodies and memories of the two guys who had entered the room, and no one else would know who they were?  <br />
<br />
Dave thought for a moment, then wrote &#39;who are happy to report directly to me&#39; under the previous sentence.  He looked over at the women, expecting them to have loosened up a bit, and maybe to know a bit more about them, but they still seemed very tense.  Aside from the nicknames they&#39;d called eachother he still had no clue who they were.  He heard his boss&#39;s voice a few seconds before the door to his office opened.<br />
<br />
&quot;--get that straightened out with HR.  Dave! Settling in I see.&quot;  Joe Ross said as he strode into the room.  He&#39;d started losing his hearing a few years back as well as his hair, and Dave winced at his near-shouting.  He came over stood beside Dave watching the two women work.  &quot;I want you to know that I&#39;m going to take some serious flack from the other department heads, but I made my case to JC and he agreed with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe continued as if Dave hadn&#39;t spoken.  &quot;And if you get any pressure or grumbling from anyone you tell me ASAP so I can put a stop to it.&quot;  He turned and looked Dave in the eye.  &quot;We need to come through these negotiations with flying colors and grab every advantage we can because our analyst is convinced Calymian Polytechnic Institute is about to take off and be a household name.  Ladies, if I could have your attention for a moment?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Mr Ross.&quot; Angie stepped up beside Bri, both standing facing Joe and Dave with their backs straight and their shoulders pulled back. Dave realized he was staring at their prominent breasts and blushed, turning slightly to look out the window.  In doing so he missed the look the two women shared before focusing on Joe.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I was just informing Mr Branson, the negotiations with Calymian Polytechnic are of vital importance to the firm, and for that reason you have both been reassigned to advise Dave here on the technological aspects of the contract he&#39;ll be hammering out.&quot;  Dave turned to stare at Joe, who was smiling at the two young women&#39;s obvious looks of shock.  &quot;You&#39;ll be reporting directly to him until such time as your skills are needed elsewhere, and will be promoted to Resource Analysts I and II for the duration of this assignment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir,&quot; Bri asked hesitantly, &quot;Does that mean we are relieved of our additional assigned duties as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah hem,&quot; Joe coughed and glanced at Dave, his cheeks reddening slightly.  &quot;In as much as you now report to a single superior, he would be the only one authorized to give you additional duties as assigned, or I could since he reports directly to me.&quot; Dave glanced at the women in bewilderment as both snapped back into the &#39;tits-out&#39; posture they&#39;d adopted when Joe called them over.  &quot;I would of course expect you to attend to Mr Branson in the same manor as you have other managers in the past.&quot;  Bri&#39;s blush showed clearly against her pale skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mr. Ross!&quot;  Angie echoed Bri but seemed to be fighting to keep a smile contained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, have facilities set you up some work stations in here, unless you&#39;d prefer they have cubicals nearby?&quot;  Joe caught Dave off guard with the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, ah, in here would be fine, though it&#39;s not that big an office.&quot;  Dave managed to stammer out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I expect you&#39;ll be working very closely together for the next few months in any case.&quot; Joe said. &quot;Thank you ladies, back to work.  And Dave, stop by my office before you leave today, okay?  We&#39;ll go over some orientation matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes Mr Ross, of course!&quot;  Dave breathed a sigh of relief and slumped against the wall after Joe left.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Dave, you haven&#39;t received your manager orientation yet?&quot; Angie was leaning over his desk adjusting cords.  When she glanced up to look at him Dave could see straight down her top.<br />
<br />
He blinked and fought to keep his eyes on hers. &quot;Ah, nope, I just got promoted out of the blue half an hour ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Angie smiled broadly and braced her elbows on the table, arcing her back slightly. &quot;I guess we&#39;ve all gotten lucky today.&quot;  She didn&#39;t seem to be in any hurry to straighten up, and tipped her head to the side as she smiled at her new boss.<br />
<br />
Bri sat a box on the desk with a thud, startling both of them.  She frowned at Angie, then glanced at Dave and the blush returned to her cheeks.  &quot;How much do you know about the &#39;perks&#39; of management at Fortens, Bryant, Johnson, and Grier Associates?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Dave thought for a moment the started counting on his fingers.  &quot;Ah, I have a secretary, and a parking space, and I think there might be some bathrooms on the 6th floor only managers can use?&quot;  Dave tried to think of anything else he might have heard of, then shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you poor dear!  Angie straightened up and smiled at Bri. &quot;We&#39;ll have to straighten him out, won&#39;t we Bri?  <br />
<br />
Dave held his breath as the statuesque blond beauty tensed, then turned and strode swiftly over to face him, her breasts bouncing as she came.  She must be wearing heels, Dave thought, though he couldn&#39;t bring himself to look away from her chest. When she stopped less than a foot in front of him the woman&#39;s ample breasts dominated his attention.  Dave swallowed and felt sweat standing out on his forehead as he realized from the close inspection she was allowing him that her bra was specially constructed to leave her nipples bare to press against the thin material of her sweater.  Those two note-worthies were beginning to poke out as they tightened from their bouncing.  She leaned forward, her breasts pressing softly against Dave&#39;s chest as she leaned to whisper in his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Until five minutes ago, Angela and I were two of the perks managers got to enjoy.&quot;  She gently licked his ear lobe before continuing. &quot;Any manager could give us &#39;Additional Assigned Duties&#39; to perform.&quot;  She put her arms around Dave nibbled on his ear as she pressed her body against his. &quot;Hand jobs, strip teases, oral sex, lap dances, special clothing and costumes worn after hours at managers&#39; homes, strap-on vibrators and butt plugs to wear at work.  I&#39;ve lost track of the number of things I&#39;ve been assigned to masturbate with, how many times men have ordered me to stand still as they groped or undressed me.  The only saving grace was that since I wasn&#39;t assigned to directly report to any of them, none of them were allowed to have vaginal or anal sex with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bridget?  What are you telling him?&quot; Angie tugged on Bri&#39;s shoulder, pulling her away from Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;The dirty truth about who are, and how the managers in this company use us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how that situation could be remotely legal,&quot; Dave began, &quot;But I am not going to take advantage of you in that way.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The two beauties shared another look while Dave tried to think of what to write to fix things, and wondered if maybe the pen used more than just the words he&#39;d written when it changed reality.  He&#39;d certainly had fleeting thoughts of the two expressing their happiness at reporting to him by, well, pleasuring him in various ways, but to discover the nature of the history he&#39;d jotted into existence sickened him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be too hasty,&quot; Angie said, &quot;if you don&#39;t use us during the negotiations Ross is sure to send us back into the pool, and maybe demote you as well.&quot;  She smiled at Dave.  &quot;I am willing to do just about anything to stay out of the general pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Dave said, &quot;but...&quot;</p>
