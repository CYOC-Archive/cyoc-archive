<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>just wanna reiterate that I&#39;m aiming for character/theme consistency, so my contributions are not going to be super-sexual and will fit with the style I&#39;ve established previously. Branching options I create are intended to mesh with that. Enjoy! :)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was later that Wednesday afternoon that Brianna brought up the following weekend over text. During the week, they had been messaging back and forth daily, and the frequent contact with her had improved his mood considerably, making the boredom of school and irritation of family life much more bearable. She reaffirmed her invitation to him -- her parents were going to be out, taking her brother to some little league sports thing on Saturday, and she had opted to stay home -- and how much she was looking forward to hanging out again. Conspicuously absent was any mention of his transformation reverting, and Jeff didn&#39;t fail to notice this omission, small though it was. It caused him to pause where he was sitting, on his bed in his room, phone in hand, and gaze down thoughtfully at his groin.<br />
<br />
There it lay, the bump of the crotch-breast inside his pants. The size of the bulge made him appear like a particularly well-endowed young man, but he was now so used to walking with it, and dressing to minimise the outline of it, that it was barely an issue for him at all. Basically, Jeff had become used to dealing with the problems, and it was now a totally natural part of his life. Even something as mundane as getting up to pee in the middle of the previous night -- he had stumbled to the toilet half-awake, slipped the nipple out of his fly, then squeezed the breast-flesh through his boxers, groaning in mild relief as he emptied himself into the bowl. Still dozy, he had wiped the nub clean, tucked it away, flushed, then stumbled back to bed.<br />
<br />
Just like it had always been a part of him.<br />
<br />
It was turning into second nature, and Jeff acknowledged that he was very adept at acting normal when he clearly wasn&#39;t. Now, he had chosen to prolong this experience for her, because he knew he could deal with it, and well, he wanted Brianna to stay excited about seeing him -- and it sure seemed like she was into his transformation.<br />
<br />
How would she react when she saw that he hadn&#39;t changed back?<br />
<br />
Wednesday blurred into Thursday, then Friday, and finally Saturday morning. Jeff was eager to meet up with her again, and despite feeling a bit weird about delaying his return to normalcy -- the lingering desire to reacquire his penis and be a &#39;full boy&#39; was still very strong -- he was oddly giddy about what he was doing. It was like he was giving her a surprise gift, and he wanted to see Brianna&#39;s reaction, and hopefully, her appreciation of his extended temporary choice. He was apprehensive too, his nerves and uncertainty at their undefined relationship playing tricks on his mind, making him doubt himself.<br />
<br />
As it turned out, it was pure paranoia. The moment Brianna opened the door, she pulled him inside by the hand, like all the previous times. Unlike the previous times, she immediately hugged him. It wasn&#39;t merely a hug between friends, but more -- her arms went close around his neck, her chest pressed tightly against his, and she held it for longer before letting go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I missed you!&quot; She shrugged, smiling bashfully, eyes averting. &quot;My friends are cool but there&#39;s only so much talk about extra-curriculars, cheerleading gossip, and makeup comparisons that I can deal with before I want to scream. You&#39;re my saviour right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah.&quot; Jeff grinned, his relief strong, and he began to relax. &quot;Class was dead boring for me as well. I couldn&#39;t wait for the weekend. I&#39;ve been look forward to this too, and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; She interrupted him, having glimpsed his lower body enough to notice, and she immediately called it out. &quot;Do- ... do you still have it?! I thought, um, that you&#39;d ... gotten rid of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; He swallowed nervously. &quot;I wanted to change back, but I know you like it, and well, I figured it can&#39;t hurt if I stay like this for a little bit lo- ... mmmmph!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianna&#39;s lips were on his, cutting him off decisively as she pulled him into an amorous kiss, quick but steamy, her tongue swiping his before they separated, and she let go of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are AMAZING.&quot; She whispered it ardently, her hand rubbing his neck and around his ear. &quot;That&#39;s one of the sweetest, most thoughtful things ever!&quot; Brianna was studying his face up close, clearly touched, and then she let him go, her eyes darting away, an idea coming to her. &quot;Um, I was going to set up some console games for us in the basement, but ... now ... I&#39;ve got something better in mind. Go upstairs and grab us a couple of towels -- you know where to find them, right? -- and meet me out in the yard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Towels? Jeff didn&#39;t have a chance to ask anything more before she was away, disappearing energetically through the house out into the Ferguson&#39;s back section. He did as he was asked, tramping upstairs to find the requested items from the bathroom cupboards, before retracing his route back down and outside too. The sound of splashing was all the clue he needed, and he entered the pool enclosure to a wonderful sight. It was a warm day, and Brianna had already shucked her clothes and was in the water, the surface distortion not enough to disguise the fact that she was completely naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The neighbours can&#39;t see in here, so don&#39;t worry about privacy. Put those down,&quot; she giggled, indicating the towels, &quot;and strip for me! I want to get my money&#39;s worth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I- .. um, okay!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heart racing, Jeff dropped the towels and began to remove his layers. Socks, shirt and sweater, pants, and lastly the bra cup. The breast wobbled lightly as he pulled the straps down his legs and stepped out of it, straightening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold that pose for a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianna gazed up from her spot in the water, taking the image of him in. He stood, vulnerable and exposed, the air breezing over his hairless groin, as she studied him. Despite how cool she was about everything, there was a lingering self-consciousness that made him want to hide his freakish crotch, but he fought the urge to cover himself with his hands, managing to keep a casual upright posture. Brianna was examining him, and after sweeping him head to foot, her attention persisted on his crotch for a lot longer, trance-like as if she was memorising it, before she snapped out of it.<br />
<br />
With a flirtatious wink, she motioned him in, and Jeff eagerly lowered himself over the edge and into the water. As the cool wetness slid up his thighs, it touched the plump under-side of his crotch and Jeff paused, a reflex from when he was a regular boy. It wasn&#39;t unlike entering cold water with his male genitals, but the sensitive feminine flesh was giving him different sensations and he shivered momentarily, a wave of goosebumps sweeping across his breast, before he braved it and dropped all the way in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, cutie.&quot; She was taking his hand again, as she seemed to love doing, and pulled him out into the middle, away from the sides, before letting go. Diving under, she resurfaced a few feet away, her hair splayed out behind her, and her breasts cresting water. Jeff wanted to stare at them, how delightfully round and buoyant they seemed, with hard little nipples and the perfect amount of subtle anatomical jiggle, but he knew he shouldn&#39;t. About to turn away, he was surprised by a skimming spray of wet hitting his face, Brianna having scooped up a liquid handful to deliberately bomb him with.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re such a gentleman!&quot; She was laughing, her teasing as harmless and friendly as always. &quot;I can tell you wanna see them, and if anyone&#39;s got the right, it&#39;s my boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-Boyfriend?!?&quot; Jeff spluttered, accidentally inhaling water in his surprise and he began to cough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, d&#39;you think I go skinnydipping and shower with every guy I&#39;m acquainted with?&quot; She snorted, waiting patiently for his lungs to clear. &quot;Do you think I text others as much as I do you, and ask them over this often? If it&#39;s not already crystal clear, it&#39;s only you I&#39;m interested in, and ... I know it&#39;s mutual.&quot; Brianna shrugged, and looked away, mildly embarrassed. &quot;So yeah, it&#39;s only fair that my boyfriend,&quot; she made sure to emphasise the word, &quot;gets a chance to see my boobs, since I got a good long look at his -- and how fine it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she pushed them up, together, above the water, and Jeff was treated to the lovely vision of them squeezed together in their glorious soft pairing, liquid coursing off the sides, before she was away, giggling, and diving under again, toward the deeper end.<br />
<br />
Wow!<br />
<br />
Happily flustered, Jeff laughed to himself, and took off after her. He was her boyfriend!? Her boyfriend! All his doubt felt like it had been paid off with that one statement, and once he caught up with her, he felt carefree. It didn&#39;t take long to become used to the way the water flowed around his naked crotch, and the constant fluttering and rippling from the pool&#39;s currents was like somebody very gently wiggling his nether regions. It made the swimming as enjoyable as the company, and before long, the two of them were horsing around, playing and talking and laughing, and Jeff couldn&#39;t have been more glad about his choices. For the next twenty minutes they enjoyed the water and the privacy of the Ferguson&#39;s pool enclosure.<br />
<br />
At last, tiring a little, Jeff moved over to the side of the pool, Brianna once again diving to touch the bottom. Leaning by the edge, he rested his arms on the flat and caught his breath. He was in a fantastic mood, and he couldn&#39;t stop smiling. Maybe once they were-<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s thoughts were interrupted by the quickening movement of water near his lower half, as his body became more flush with the pool&#39;s side while he relaxed. Glancing down, he saw he was right over the intakes for the pool filtration system, a cluster of small suctioning ducts. He could feel the water pulling rapidly inward as his midriff and legs got closer.<br />
<br />
Oh, that&#39;s all it was! He was about to move away when, with a sudden jolt of movement, his groin was caught by the filter&#39;s traction, and he felt his crotch yanked forward, pulling tighter against the pool&#39;s side.<br />
<br />
Wait, what was-<br />
<br />
It all happened so quickly the he couldn&#39;t even articulate thoughts. Instantly, with a powerful gripping slurp, his nipple and areola were sucked into a duct, the rest of the breast jamming against it, almost blocking it. Water was streaming rapidly past and around the small gap left by the breast. It was high pressure, and the intense sucking sensation was pulling at him like a hungry mouth, causing the nub to instantly harden. The vibration of the filter&#39;s machinery was passing directly into the spongy flesh, the force of it like the smooth rumble of an engine. Except, because of the near blockage, it wasn&#39;t perfectly even and it came in oscillating pulses, hitting him on a rhythm, like a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
The feeling ramped up from nice, to pleasant, to really good, to fantastic, and finally to divine sexual enchantment, over the space of about five seconds. The rushing water, the concentrated suction on his overstimulated nipple, and the throbbing quaking waves of mechanical pressure, were a repeating surge of masturbatory pleasure. It went outward through his lower body in pulses that matched the rhythm, and he could feel the muscles in his thighs and butt and abdomen quivering in time to it.<br />
<br />
Almost drooling, Jeff&#39;s eye&#39;s rolled back, and he was lost in the euphoria of this accidental magical sucking, when Brianna broke up through the water next to him. He wanted to pull away, his face burning with hot guilty humiliation and vibrant pleasure both, but his arms and legs were weakened, his horny instincts telling him to stay still and &#39;let it milk you!&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, if you&#39;re tired, we can-&quot; Brianna only made it a half dozen words before her eyes went wide at his glazed reddened expression, and her gaze flicked down to where his crotch was suctioned to the filter ducts. Her realisation that he was caught was instant, as was her subsequent recognition of how he was caught, and just how much he was enjoying it. &quot;Oh. The filter snagged you? And by your- ... oh. OH.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff tried to speak, but his words just turned into a slurred-out moan. She giggled, and slid closer next to him. &quot;Felt like amusing yourself, huh? Well,&quot; her voice dropped lower, and she reached a hand from the water to guide his head closer to hers, &quot;let&#39;s make this a two-player game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her kiss was more prolonged than the two previous times. Brianna&#39;s lips and tongue were soft and wet and magnetic, and it was like his mouth, and the feeling of her boobs pressed against his arm were injecting a happy buzz of warm lightning that shot down his body with each brush and slide of flesh, to meet the insanely good pulsing vibrations radiating across his lower half. They made out for no more than about twenty seconds, and Jeff felt the perfect storm of titillation strike on a drumbeat that was so pitch-perfect that he knew he would orgasm in less than ten seconds. A chain reaction was happening in the breast, and it was swelling VERY quickly, almost too fast, and it took all the strength Jeff had to push himself away from the pool side, breaking the kiss with her in the same moment.<br />
<br />
The nipple popped free from the duct, the breast bobbing in the open water, and Jeff gasped, his lower body tensing, barely able to hold back. &quot;I&#39;m s-sorry!&quot; He apologised. &quot;That was- ... it felt SO good, and I didn&#39;t want to ... to make a mess in your pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; She wasn&#39;t upset at being cut off, and was even smirking a little, clearly playing with him. &quot;You&#39;re one of the most considerate boys I&#39;ve met, and I was wondering at what point you&#39;d stop me.&quot; In a typical Brianna move, she came closer, took his arm, and began to lead him back down the pool to the shallow end so they could exit the water, and he willingly followed her. &quot;Because you&#39;re so good to me, it makes me want to be the same for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff made to get out, but Brianna stopped him. &quot;Hold up.&quot; She reached over, stretching, and managed to just reach one of the towels where it lay on the ground, and dragged it closer, right to the pool side. &quot;Here,&quot; she patted the padded seat she had created, &quot;park your butt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Climbing up, he turned and sat on the towel, his legs still dangling in the water. Brianna took his knees and pushed them wide, firmly &#39;manspreading&#39; him. There still wasn&#39;t enough room for the breast, and it sat heavily against both thighs and the towel, plumper and denser due to his arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you REALLY liked that, didn&#39;t you?&quot; She whispered, staring at how engorged he was, before stifling another brief giggle. &quot;You look kinda ... big.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blushed. &quot;It was, um, an accident, b-but ... it&#39;s so sensitive! The strain was building fast!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and that was partly my fault,&quot; she smiled, moving in between his legs, &quot;so let me release the pressure for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she laid her arms over his thighs, around his waist, and her chest came up against his groin. Her breasts came to rest on his, one on either side, and his lightly parted her cleavage with a slick frictionless sensation that caused them both to moan softly at the same time. Brianna pushed forward a little, and the soft tissue was gliding up, rubbing across his thighs and lightly squeezing him, before she shimmied side to side for a second. The sleek fatty slipping motion as they swished horizontally across his lap from hip to hip -- her hardened nipples brushing his skin, while his brushed hers -- was some kind of wet dream come to life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh!&quot; She gasped. &quot;Jeff! That&#39;s- ... that&#39;s so nice!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pressing tighter against him, Brianna began to rub her breasts across him in circles, up and down, left and right. Squishy, wet, warm, smooth skin, back and forth, and he stared at her like a dumbstruck hormonal virgin, and she back at him with a sensual satisfaction, meeting his gaze. Breasts! Glossy, bouncing and sliding, sandwiched together, hers caressing his like silk, his enlarging against hers like an inflating balloon, the nipple stiff, but heated and fatter. On the next push of her shoulders, the light compression of her flesh on either side of his, and his nub brushing around her collarbone, was enough to set him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-Brianna!&quot; He stuttered as way of a warning, and even engaged in her own enjoyment, she reacted to him. Crushing them closer, all three boobs mashing together, squashed into a valley of packed breast-flesh, he released. It sprayed out, blasting point-blank against her skin, and splashing back onto him too, and Jeff groaned at the sensation, his favourite thing in the world -- being milked. On and on it went, a smooth ecstasy of relief, squirting across his lap and her chest, the milk pooling in the creases and running down the curves as it drenched them both. Still making eye contact, Brianna was breathlessly watching him, rapturous in her own way as she held them closely together, her gaze silently telling him she wanted to see him make a real mess, give her the full show. He was obliging, his vocals dimming to grunts as the flow slowed down, and came to a stop. With a final sigh, Jeff broke eye contact with his girlfriend, and glanced down to the exhausted nipple, where the last droplets of his milk were dribbling from the satiated tip.</p>
