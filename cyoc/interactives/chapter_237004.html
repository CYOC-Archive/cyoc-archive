<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After leaving the show, the two boys, walking together, headed towards their respective homes. <br />
Matt was beaming with happiness, enjoying every moment of the sensation of wearing briefs, relishing the thought that from that night onwards he would never wet the bed again. <br />
Daniel was also happy with his new underwear, but he was also worried that someone he knew would see him with his wet pants.  He also felt a little uncomfortable feeling his pants wet and cold on his thighs, but was comforted by the feeling of the soaked GoodNites between his legs. <br />
&quot;Wow, man! If you only knew how happy I am!&quot; Matt said happily. &quot;This is exactly what I&#39;ve always wanted! You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to wake up at night and find your bed wet!&quot; Matt paused briefly, realizing his words, and added: &quot;No, wait, now you do! Hahaha! I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s really happened!&quot; the boy continued. &quot;What about you? How are you feeling? I&#39;m sorry that you had to wear my wet GoodNites, but I was really too excited and... I didn&#39;t realize I had wet myself.&quot; Matt said apologetically. Matt spoke quickly. Daniel knew it was his friend&#39;s habit when he was happy, and excited about something.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; Daniel replied &quot;Anyway, then I peed on myself too, in front of everyone...&quot;<br />
The two teenagers continued walking, in silence, each with their own thoughts. As they walked, however, other things began to change in the two boys. <br />
Matt, without even realizing the change began to feel more confident, as if his body was getting used to the new normal underwear, and was forgetting that just a few minutes before, he was the one who had wet his bed, and had worn GoodNites. The boy was now focused on the fact that from that night onwards, he would always wear his briefs dry, and he would be able to sleep, and walk, and play without having to fear wetting himself. Furthermore Matt now finding himself more comfortable walking with his legs more closed, rather than slightly open due to the thickness of his old padded underwear. His walk became more relaxed, and the lack of absorbent padding between his legs no longer felt strange, but rather cool, fresh, and pleasant. He also found himself looking with superiority at his friend Daniel, whose trousers showed a wet stain at the groin and along the legs and even the outline of the wet GoodNites underneath, and he felt an instinctive, and perhaps a little immature, pride for the difference that their underwear now caused.<br />
Also Daniel was experiencing a series of changes. In the beginning, the wetness between his legs had been unpleasant and had made him uncomfortable, but after a while he had got used to the sensation. He had to admit that his GoodNites, wet as they were, were warm and soft and pleasant to wear, and he could not understand why his friend Matt had not appreciated their wonderful sensation. He had also noticed that, while the briefs were comfortable and felt nice and familiar, they were not as pleasant as the GoodNites, and that his walk had changed, and that his legs were now further apart, as if to make room for the GoodNites. Daniel had never noticed the difference before, since he had always worn his briefs, but now, feeling the softness and the thickness of his GoodNites, he did not want to exchange it for a dry pair of briefs. Then he looked at his friend Matt, who was wearing his dry briefs. He saw that the crotch of Matt&#39;s pants was swollen, much the same as his own, but the difference was that Matt&#39;s was caused by the swelling of a healthy, well-formed cock, while his was the result of the bulky shape of the soaked GoodNites. In any case, the difference was clear and visible for all, and it was obvious which was the one of the two boys had the more &quot;mature&quot; undergarment.<br />
&quot;How do you feel, Dan?&quot; Matt asked his friend, looking at his diapered bottom, that swaying slightly from side to side with each step, and make his trousers wetter. &quot;You seem a little ... strange. Is there anything wrong?&quot; He continued.<br />
&quot;Well, I feel good, and ... no, everything&#39;s fine.&quot; Daniel lied, blushing. There was a long pause, then Daniel asked: &quot;Matt, how do you feel, in your new briefs?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a fantastic feeling!&quot; Matt exclaimed, and, after a short hesitation, continued: &quot;I feel like... like I&#39;ve always worn them, and like I never want to take them off again. It feels like ... like it&#39;s normal.&quot; Matt paused and looked at his friend&#39;s bulging, wet pants. &quot;How are you doing? How do you feel wearing your GoodNites? Isn&#39;t it wet, and uncomfortable?&quot; Matt asked. <br />
&quot;No, no,&quot; Daniel replied. &quot;They&#39;re actually a little... pleasant. It&#39;s a sensation I&#39;ve never had before, and now, the more I walk with them, the more I get used to it, and I feel a little strange. It&#39;s as if I&#39;ve been wearing GoodNites all my life, and as if I had never worn briefs.&quot; Daniel said. <br />
&quot;Yeah, I know the feeling,&quot; Matt replied. &quot;I know exactly what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; He concluded, with a smile. <br />
&quot;Hey, look, we&#39;re here, we arrived at our houses.&quot; He said, as they stopped in front of the two identical houses. &quot;Thanks for the exchange, Daniel, it was a good idea.&quot; He concluded, extending a hand. &quot;Goodbye, see you tomorrow!&quot;<br />
&quot;Goodbye, see you tomorrow,&quot; Daniel replied.</p>
