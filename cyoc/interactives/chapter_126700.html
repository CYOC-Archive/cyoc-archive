<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">May was a 16 year old girl who recently moved into the city. She had pretty good grades and had managed to get a scholarship to a live in high school that would take her in for her remaining years. She&#39;d go back home for certain holidays like Christmas, but she found that  she didn&#39;t have a big workload and had a lot of spare time. Looking at the average time it took her to do homework she figured she had enough time to take a part time job on the weekends so the girl started to look around. One shop she found was a restaurant that had good yelp reviews saying that they really took in the suggestions of the customers in their special suggestion box. There was a help wanted sign so she went inside to where Drew the owner was at a podium writing on something. <br />
The middle aged man said &quot;Ah, Welcome to my humble little shop. How may I help you?&quot; <br />
May asked &quot;I was wondering if you were still hiring and may be interested in hiring me.&quot; she looked into her purse and said &quot;I have a resume on me!&quot; then held out a one-sided sheet of paper. <br />
Drew took a look and said &quot;We were looking for a waiter or waitress... You going to that school?!? don&#39;t you need the time for the work?&quot; <br />
May shook her head and said &quot;I&#39;ve never needed time during the weekends to do my work and study.&quot; <br />
Drew said &quot;Well we do need people to work during the weekend evenings if that&#39;s fine. You must have a good head on your shoulders so memorizing menu items shouldn&#39;t be too hard... Do you have a food handling licence?&quot; <br />
May shook her head again and asked &quot;Are they hard to get?&quot; <br />
Drew got a small folder out of his podium and said &quot;No, it takes one or two hours at most. You watch a video and take a test, most of it is common sense... tomorrow is Saturday and since you wanted to work part time if you can just gather a few things... The food handling licence, social security number, address.&quot;<br />
May said &quot;Actually the social security number and my address is on my resume.&quot; <br />
Drew took another look and said &quot;Well they are... I&#39;d be careful about having your social security number on your resume for future use... Oh yeah finally would you call yourself a small, medium, or large?&quot; <br />
May said &quot;Medium please.&quot;<br />
Drew said &quot;Then I can get you in for an introduction shift tomorrow at... would you mind doing the evening shift to closing at 10? There&#39;s something we do at closing that you should know about.&quot;<br />
May said &quot;Sure... I don&#39;t live that far away so it shouldn&#39;t be too big of a problem.&quot; <br />
Drew nodded and said &quot;So yeah just come tomorrow with a food handlers licence. We&#39;ve got a small changing room in the back and remember to read the stuff in the folder I gave you.&quot; May nodded and thanked him for the job and left. <br />
<br />
an hour or so latter May had breezed through the food handlers licence test and now had  a print out that she laminated to look nice. Then looking in the folder she found a paper copy of the menu which she put to the side and a message. The owner was named Drew, the restaurant was small and not doing that well until the owner got a magic suggestion box. Now the restaurant is doing amazingly with a menu changing almost daily and the food only ever getting better and better. May thought to herself &quot;Well... A magic suggestion box... what&#39;s magic about it? Does it filter the suggestions somehow? Guess i&#39;ll probably figure it out.&quot; Then after doing a bit of schoolwork went to sleep and get ready for the next day. <br />
<br />
little bit of studying and finishing up some work and she had found herself with time to spare as she got ready for her 5 hour shift starting at 5:00 p.m. Although she arrived 10 minutes early.  Walking in with the folder Drew saw may and said &quot;Ah welcome May. You&#39;re a little early but that&#39;s great. We can show you around when we prepare for the dinner opening.&quot; <br />
May asked &quot;What do you mean dinner opening?&quot; <br />
Drew said &quot;Well when we get someone new we post that we&#39;ll close for about an hour while we give the new person a little tour and show them around to some of  our employees.&quot;<br />
May said &quot;That should drive away some customers though right?&quot; <br />
Drew shook his head and said &quot;Actually it makes the customers happy... somehow. Ah great you&#39;ve got your food handlers licence in that folder right?&quot; May shook her head and handed it to Drew who looked in and said &quot;yep that&#39;s a food handlers licence. I&#39;ll put this away in some of our files...&quot; then stuffed it in the podium. Drew then showed May to the back where she saw some people sitting around a table playing some card game. <br />
Drew said &quot;Well crew this is our new employee May. She&#39;ll be working part-time so I hope you&#39;ll help her out.&quot; <br />
A man with a white apron on  who was balding and a bit pudgy said &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Mark and I head the kitchen these days. Hope you have good handwriting, need to be able to read orders and special orders you know?&quot; <br />
Then another guy in a white apron with black hair in a plain white hat said &quot;Well I&#39;m Josh. I work in the kitchen with Mark there and Drew if it ever gets too busy... um... Hope everything is good during the brief interactions we have during the delivery of orders I guess...&quot; May noted that Josh was having a hard time looking her in the eye, must be a nervous man.<br />
A gorgeous woman in a black dress with a white apron said &quot;Yo, i&#39;m Stacy. I guess i&#39;ll probably be helping you out the most when things inevitably get hectic. Just take things slow and steady today.&quot;<br />
Then finally another lady in a similar uniform said with a french accent &quot;How do you do. I&#39;m Mary. Hope we don&#39;t get our names mixed up... Um... Let&#39;s just try to do good work today then?&quot; <br />
Drew said &quot;That&#39;s everyone here today. So let&#39;s go and get you in uniform.&quot; then handed her a package with a uniform that reminded her of the ones that the women wore. <br />
Stacy said &quot;Remember to go into the women&#39;s changing room. You don&#39;t want to go into the men&#39;s room!&quot; May nodded and then got changed.  <br />
The prodigy had memorized most of the menu and figured out how to greet and give suggestions properly, but that didn&#39;t help a ton when they opened and almost immediately a bunch of people were coming in. May tried to help as many people as she could but when she took a look she ended up helping anywhere between a half and a third of the people Mary and Stacy were. She could also tell she was slow with some people being a little impatient with their beverages and refills. Then there was bringing the food to the tables. She hadn&#39;t given it much thought but certain platters were simply heavy considering how much broth was in certain soups. Just looking at the trays she could tell she often spilled a little. During her break that she had with Stacy she could feel her arms shaking. <br />
Stacy said &quot;Yeah... We get busy. Don&#39;t worry though. With our customers you&#39;ll definitely be getting better by tomorrow. In the mean time feel free to take it slow, i&#39;m pretty sure Drew and the others don&#39;t expect you to be amazing right off the bat. Just don&#39;t be exceptionally slow.&quot; <br />
Her words were comforting but May figured she didn&#39;t want to be too slow when carrying nearly boiling heavy soups. <br />
<br />
After what seemed like forever they closed and thanked the last couple of people who were leaving at 9:30. They then quickly cleaned everywhere and then went to the back where a fairly large meal was prepared in the back. Drew there said &quot;Well May this is our crew meal. We&#39;ve asked most of our employees and since no one gets hungry in this shift everyone felt a late dinner was good.&quot; She took a seat with the others and it was a kind of nice meal. She was the only teen there so she kind of felt like the kid at the table but she was given a decent amount of respect. Then the meal was done and Drew took the plates away with a quick wash latter Drew came back with the suggestion box filled to the brim. <br />
<br />
Drew asked &quot;So May want to take out the first suggestion?&quot; <br />
May confused said &quot;Is this the special thing? I thought you meant the dinner was special.&quot; <br />
Drew said &quot;go ahead and take one.&quot;<br />
May took a slip of paper out of the box and a bit of a glare appeared on her face. Mary chuckled and said &quot;Well come on. Read it out loud.&quot;<br />
May said &quot;New girl&#39;s breasts should be at least an E-cup.&quot; She sighed and said &quot;Are most of them jokes?&quot; The guys started chuckling.<br />
Stacy said &quot;Dear... The person who wrote that wasn&#39;t joking. I&#39;d look down if I were you.&quot; <br />
May looked to her chest which was feeling a little warm and then noted that they were growing along with the uniform. When they stopped they were much bigger than her B-cups and May&#39;s face was a bit red as she asked &quot;What, huh, why?&quot;<br />
Drew said &quot;That&#39;s our magic suggestion box. When people suggest we something it kind of happens. Course the box filters out certain things. No real mind control or manipulation, nothing that would harm any one of us, no just turning someone into a dog. If you don&#39;t want to deal with this you can quit. People who quit revert to who they would be if they hadn&#39;t worked here, but it can be rewarding as most people want the best for the restaurant really.&quot;<br />
May still looking at her new tits said &quot;I guess this isn&#39;t so bad... I&#39;ll stay for now but if there&#39;s any suggestion I can&#39;t handle i&#39;m quitting!&quot;<br />
Cheers came all around and Drew said &quot;That&#39;s basically what everyone here goes by. So let&#39;s go around the table and look at these suggestions...&quot;</p>
