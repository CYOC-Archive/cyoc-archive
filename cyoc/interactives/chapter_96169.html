<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Grimaldi checked the time on his watch as his students began their warm-ups for gym class.  He sighed and called over one of the football boys.  &quot;Zane!  Get over here; I want to talk to you for a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cocky running back joined him by the bleachers.  &quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Grimaldi frowned and crossed his large, hairy arms over his ample gut.  &quot;When&#39;s Roddy supposed to be out here?  I saw him go in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zane rolled his eyes and shrugged.  &quot;I dunno, man.  Whenever he wants.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gym teacher jerked his thumb toward the door to the boys&#39; locker room.  &quot;Could you go check on him, please?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zane sighed and shrugged.  &quot;Sure, whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Roderick almost jumped for joy when he saw Zane reenter the locker room.  Almost, because it was still impossible for him to move.<br />
<br />
Zane looked around the locker room curiously.  &quot;Roddy?  You in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Roderick thought as loudly as he could at Zane.  &quot;Over here!  I&#39;m in the ground right in front of you!  Look down you fucking moron!&quot;<br />
<br />
Roderick&#39;s thoughts were inaudible to Zane, who merely shrugged and left, leaving Roderick alone once again.  A long string of expletives flew through Roderick&#39;s mind.  If he ever got out of this predicament, Zane would have hell to pay.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zane left the locker room and shrugged at Mr. Grimaldi.  &quot;No one in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gym teacher frowned and stepped past Zane to check the locker room himself.  Just as Zane had said, the locker room was empty.  Just to be sure, Grimaldi checked in all the nooks and crannies somebody could hide, including around corners, the showers, and event he supply closet.  There was nobody around.  Grimaldi knew he couldn&#39;t keep his students waiting and unsupervised much longer, so he began to make his way out of the locker room.  He would just have to make a report to the office about Roderick&#39;s unexcused absence.  A glint of gold caught his eye, and he halted in his tracks.<br />
<br />
Grimaldi reached down and retrieved the pair of gold-banded underwear.  He turned them around in his hands, feeling the soft fabric and admiring the odd elastic band.  He stroked his black mustache thoughtfully.  Without quite knowing why, he brought the fabric up to his nose and sniffed.  They felt fresh and clean, as though they&#39;d never been worn.  They did not look as if they belonged abandoned on the floor of the locker room.  Grimaldi made his way back to the gym, stopping by his office to drop off the weird underwear.  He would turn them in to lost and found when he got the chance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rodrick lay there, on the gym teacher&#39;s desk.  Well, at least somebody had found him this time.  Still, he was no closer to turning back to normal.  How did this stuff even happen, anyway?  What had he ever done to deserve something like this happening to him?  This had to be a dream.  There was no other explanation.  Any minute now he would wake up.  Speaking of minutes, Rodrick now had a good view of Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s desk clock.  He watched as the minutes ticked by, becoming more and more anxious with each turn of the second hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Two more periods passed before Grimaldi had a free period to himself.  He had reported Rodrick&#39;s mysterious absence.  This wasn&#39;t the first time he had pulled this stunt, so nobody was worried.  Grimaldi returned to his office to catch up on some paperwork.  There, he saw the gold-banded underwear again, just where he had left them.  Strange, he had forgotten about them until now.  He slipped them into an empty drawer of his desk and began working on his paperwork.  Or he tried, at least.  His thoughts kept drifting back to the pair of underwear, and its soft fabric.  He wondered how it would feel if he were to...<br />
<br />
He quickly shook the thoughts away.  No.  He was a man in his late-thirties.  It would be inappropriate for him to wear what was potentially a student&#39;s underwear.  What if somebody caught him?  The things he would be accused of!  Still, he couldn&#39;t stop thinking about that underwear.  He tried to focus on his paperwork, but he just couldn&#39;t!<br />
<br />
Finally, he gave in.  He would be quick.  He&#39;d wear them for a bit, and then take them straight off again.  Then he could focus on his job.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rodrick sat alone in the dark.  After his initial panic, he&#39;d taken the time to focus on things to help him calm down.  He decided to focus on the people he hated most.  There was that one smart kid in his biology class who made him look dumb, there was that kid from earlier that he had broken his glasses, Zane for leaving him alone like that, and, of course, Emily Piper.  God, he hated her.  But he also wanted her.  He wanted her so bad.  But she wouldn&#39;t let him have her.  He would show her.  He would show them all!<br />
<br />
Rodrick&#39;s brooding was interrupted by a squeak of metal and a bright light.  The drawer he had been unceremoniously tossed in had been opened, and he was scooped out by Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s large, hairy hand.  The light didn&#39;t last long, as Rodrick found himself quickly stuffed into a duffel back, among other sports equipment.  Why couldn&#39;t he have been a football?  At least then he could still go to games.  And footballs were cool, a lot cooler than underwear at least.  Although, footballs did get kicked and thrown around a lot.  But, he could turn of his sense of feeling, so that might not even be a problem.<br />
<br />
Rodrick&#39;s musings were cut short as he was once again pulled from darkness.  Now he could see he was in a bathroom.  It was probably the teacher&#39;s bathroom, by the looks of it.  He was being held by a nervous looking Mr. Grimaldi.  Rodrick was put to the side as the gym teacher removed his pants.  A feeling of dread filled Rodrick.  Was he doing what he thought he was doing?  Mr. Grimaldi proceeded to also remove his underwear.  He was!  God dammit!<br />
<br />
Rodrick cried out in terror as Mr. Grimaldi grabbed him and inserting his legs, one at a time.  Of course, Rodrick&#39;s cries were completely inaudible.  As he was pulled up over Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s wide thighs, he felt himself stretch and expand, his gold elastic compensating for his fat teacher&#39;s wider girth.  He felt Mr. Grimaldi&#39;s stomach hang over his waistband.  Rodrick quickly deactivated all his senses, avoiding the sensation of contact with his teacher&#39;s genitals.  <br />
<br />
He was alone with his thoughts in his self-imposed darkness.  He waited for several minutes, before cautiously reactivating his sense of hearing.  He heard muffled voices and the squeak of shoes on the gym floor.  He reactivated his sight.  It was dark, but it wasn&#39;t total darkness.  He could see filtered light around him, as if trough a cloth.  He realized he was still being worn by Mr. Grimaldi, and was seeing light through his teacher&#39;s pants.  He was sure to keep his senses of touch, taste, and smell deactivated.  He couldn&#39;t wait to get out of this as soon as possible.</p>
