<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think you'd make a great Minotaur!&quot;  The elf grinned and reached up to touch the silver nose ring hanging between the teen's nostrils.  There was a momentary flash of blue-white between the ring and the elf's fingertip, like a supercharged static discharge.<br />
<br />
Steve jerked his head back, and grabbed at his nose.  &quot;Fuck!  That hurt, asshole!&quot;  He rubbed it gingerly, then frowned and felt his nostrils.  The other boys could see what he could only feel. Steve's nostrils were flaring out, the center getting wider.  The nose ring grew with it, becoming a heavy loop of gold that hung over lips that were getting thicker and darker. He saw their expressions of astonishment and moved over to the mirror that hung on the back of Aaron's closet door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shit!&quot;  He stared at his reflection, already almost unrecognizable.  His mouth and nose were pushing out into a muzzle, and his eyes were shifting position under heavier brows.  Nubs on the sides of his forehead stretched out into off-white horns even as his skull deflated and thickened.  Unable to tear his eyes away from the transformation, Steve watched his head become that of a bull.  The change did not stop there - shaggy black fur spread down his neck and under the Steelers t-shirt he was wearing.  The fabric bulged, first from the fur, then from the swelling of muscles and bone in Steve's arms and shoulders. <br />
<br />
Steve grunted and backed away from the mirror to stare down at himself.  None of the other boys moved, as fascinated by his change as they had been by their own.   The elf grinned and reached out to touch the waistband of Steve's jeans, which crumbled away as if suddenly eaten by acid.  Steve's shout of indignation came out as a bellow, which stopped when he saw his less-than impressive human penis and testicles suddenly swell and darken.  The transformation accelerated tremendously, fur shooting down his legs as toes fused into cloven hooves.  He was getting taller and heavier, chest barrelling out and muscles thickening.  <br />
<br />
When the process finally seemed to finish up, Aaron's brother was a massive, black-furred bull-man, more than 7 feet tall and probably close to 400 pounds.  He was massivly hung, with a thick sheathed cock and testicles like oranges hanging low between his animal thighs.  Steve stared at himself, then back at the mirror, blinking in confusion.  Then, as realization set in, his eyes widened and he gave a bellow of fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don't freak out now.&quot;  The elf walked over and stood directly in front of Steve, looking up at the towering monster.  He reached out and hefted Steve's huge ballsack in his hand.  &quot;Don't these feel nice?&quot;<br />
<br />
Although it was obvious Steve was terrified, be didn't pull away.  Cory was the first one to speak.  &quot;Uh, is he OK?  I mean, he really didn't want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The elf motioned for the new satyr to join him.  &quot;He's fine.  It just takes a little time to adjust.  Give me a hand here.&quot;  He pointed to the ballsack.  <br />
<br />
Cory flushed, but then grinned and helped support the heavy black sack.  &quot;Man, you must have ten pound balls!&quot;  Then he looked puzzled.  &quot;This feels sorta wierd.  It's like I can feel inside his head.&quot;<br />
<br />
The elf nodded.  &quot;Yeah, 'cause you are a satyr.  You have magic of your own now.  Feel all that worry and fear and stuff?  You can make it go away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;  Cory realized he actually could sense those emotions, along with thoughts and memories swirling inside Steve's brain.  &quot;Wow!  This is cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
The satyr chuckled.  &quot;Yeah, it sure is.  Make him all better.  You can fix him, make him perfect.  Just go with your feelings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cory hesitated, excited by the weird sense of power building within him, but seeing the fear in Steve's animal eyes. But, if he was going to help...  he looked into those huge, terrified orbs and felt the connection get stronger.  There was confusion and fear from things that did not belong, strangeness, a mind that could not accept its own body.  The brain itself was too small for everything crowded into it.  And then Corey knew what to do.  He knew what belonged in that brain, that body.  His thoughts flowed into Steve, canceling the fear and confusion, removing all the clutter, helping him adjust.  The animal eyes softened, then dulled as Steve relaxed.  And then it was done.  Corey stepped back and grinned up at the Minotaur, who stood calmly with drool sliding out of his mouth, apparently chewing cud.  He felt amazing, charged with electricity, and his mind was sharp and clear.  &quot;Wow!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron and Ben moved closer to stare at Steve, who returned their gazes with mild curiosity.  Aaron frowned.  &quot;Steve?&quot;  The Minotaur did not react to his name.  &quot;What did you do to him?&quot;<br />
<br />
The elf answered &quot;Made him a perfect Minotaur.  He's a fully-grown monster with the size and strength of a bull, able to use simple weapons and his own horns as a guard, soldier, or whatever else your satyr freind wants him to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why does he look so..  stupid?&quot;  Ben shifted closer, peering at the Minotaur's blank expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because he also has the intelligence of a bull.  I doubt he even remembers being human, much less his name.&quot;  The elf nodded to Cory, who stared back open-mouthed.  &quot;The satyr stripped away all the human clutter.  Plus a bunch of soul energy and intelligence, which probably feels pretty good to him right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cory looked at his freinds, then at the elf.  &quot;Yeah!  Oh, man!  I fell like I had a dozen Cokes!  I feel..&quot;  he shook his head and frowned.  &quot;Fuck, I feel really weird.&quot;</p>
