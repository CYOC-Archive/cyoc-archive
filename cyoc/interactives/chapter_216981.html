<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Security always knew about that little secret spot that was tucked away just behind the library. However, with any attempt to monitor or put cameras up to actually guard against deviancy in that specific area, there was always some kind of vandalism or blocking that made their cameras obsolete. Instead, they had to work with more speculative evidence.<br />
<br />
With it being so late, there was barely anyone roaming the campus, there was no reason for anyone to be spending time in between the cameras that monitored the front or back of the library. It would take about 30 seconds for a person to disappear on the one camera only to then reappear on the other. Two men appeared on one of the cameras. The security guard watching them counted the thirty seconds it would normally take and when he didn&#39;t see them appear on the next set of cameras, he radioed Alan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two next to the library,&quot; the static from Alan&#39;s radio said.<br />
<br />
&quot;On it...&quot; Alan radioed back. He was over in the parking garage, and it would take a couple of minutes to get to the library. He started off in that direction with a bit of haste in his step. No reason to really run, but fast enough that people knew he had someplace to be. When he approached the library, he saw two men coming out of the dark corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sup?&quot; the bigger one said. He was cradling another man in his arms as he walked by.<br />
<br />
It took Alan a moment to really take it in. Somehow this man felt overwhelmingly massive. Even though, the guy must have been 6&#39;4&quot; maybe 6&#39;5&quot; and 260-270 pounds of solid muscular beef, Alan couldn&#39;t help but feel like his neck was straining a bit further back or seeing the presence of an actual giant. &quot;Wa-wait a second,&quot; he stammered out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I being detained?&quot; the big man asked. The growl in his voice had a hint of a threat to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no,&quot; Alan said, not wanting confrontation. Even though Alan wasn&#39;t exactly small he knew he didn&#39;t want to cause a fight he didn&#39;t have to. His 5&#39;11&quot; height with a softer 190ish pounds could hold his own against most of the college students, even scare most of the ones in the art department and humanities, but compared to this wall of muscle, he was nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then,&quot; the giant said and continued on his way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is-is he alright?&quot; Alan forced out. The man cradled in the bigger man&#39;s arms looked to be completely knocked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Too much to drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until he couldn&#39;t see the man until Alan felt okay again. &quot;Fuck...&quot; he breathed out. He hadn&#39;t realized he was holding his breath until the two were gone. <br />
<br />
The static from Alan&#39;s radio brought him back down to earth. &quot;You see anything Alan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See anything?&quot; Alan looked around wondering what he was supposed to see. Did he really want to find some college kid&#39;s alcohol vomit. Even if it was a Wednesday, that didn&#39;t completely curtail partying. And no one had complained about noise yet so it must have been fairly low key. &quot;Give me a minute,&quot; Alan radioed as he went back into dark corner.<br />
<br />
Alan turned on his flashlight and swung it around. Nothing was too out of the ordinary. The school had taken up all the outdoor tables and benches to deter students from staying back here. Even the retaining wall had been lowered to a height that would be uncomfortable to sit on. He made his way over to it to see his flashlight cast a shadow off something other than a fern or bush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What&#39;s this?&quot; Alan stepped into the light colored mulch and leaned over to find a colored egg. He reached down and picked it up. The moment the egg touched his hand he lost control of his body. &#39;WHAT THE--!&#39; he screamed inside his head. Was this egg laced with drugs? But that didn&#39;t make any sense. He could still feel his body moving it just wasn&#39;t under his control. His fingers were surprisingly quick and nimble as they undid his belt and dropped his blue pants around his feet. The boxer briefs he wore fell just as quickly.<br />
<br />
&#39;NOW WAIT A MINUTE!&#39; he continued to protest as his body refused to listen to him. The egg pushed between his soft cheeks against his sensitive asshole. His mouth fell open. A deep pleasure rocketing through him as the oblong shaped object pushed harder against his tight hole. Never in his life had he experienced something so amazing as more and more of the egg slide inside of him. <br />
<br />
His free hand held him up as it scraped against the brick wall. He whimpered and whined at the feeling but the twisting and turning of his body as he continued to force it in told a completely different story. The egg pushed past every defense he had and plopped inside of him. Alan jumped in surprise as it went all the way in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; Alan grabbed his head feeling a bit light headed. He didn&#39;t know what was going on and used the wall to help keep him standing upright. It was like every muscle in his body was relaxing at the exact same time. He let out a few grunts at the uncomfortable feeling of his body. But with each flex muscle was adding onto his body.<br />
<br />
The softer form he&#39;d always leaned into was starting to tighten up. Alan&#39;s bloated belly was the first thing to go. The skin pulled tight against his stomach as six firm bumps formed where one large one had been. Deep crevices formed between the new muscles. Dark shadows separated each of the newly formed abs. His flabby pecs were next to change as the soft muscles firmed up into hard mounds that pressed hard against the shirt he was wearing. His nipples perked up and could be easily seen through the fabric as the two massive muscles were separated by a striated gorge between them. <br />
<br />
Alan&#39;s more pear shaped torso shifted to an inverted triangle as his shoulders widened. The bland mess of muscle on either side of him molded into perfectly sculpted spheres that tested the limits of his sleeves. So much so, that the sleeves rose above his developing biceps. The ill-defined muscle quickly tightened up showing off the deep divot between his triceps and biceps. A thick vein ran through the front of his arm as blood rushed through his body filling the growing muscle with oxygen enriched blood. The same was true of his forearms as lattice of veins emerged from his skin and pumped the muscle up even more. His thick hands clawed at the bricks holding him up. Each finger swelling larger as more strength added into his grasp.<br />
<br />
Even though his belly had disappeared, his pants could still be easily held up by the massive trunk of an ass on his backside. What had always been a pretty stellar feature that naturally came with a little extra weight, quickly transformed into something so perfectly sculpted that even through the dark blue pants he was required to wear, it&#39;d be easy to see. Alan felt like his near 200 pound body had become weightless, but it was his legs that had become so strong that he felt practically weightless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah!&quot; Alan cheered excitedly. He raised his legs up and down simulating a run. Each time the thick quads flexed showing off his impressive size, but also his flexibility. However, a tingling ran through his body as black and brown hair started to sprout on his arms and chest. It continued down his arms and legs. He absentmindedly scratched at it as it grew so thick that it would be better described as fur rather than hair. The brown fur appeared in patches, somehow almost accentuating his muscles. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile another weird sensation came out of his backbone as it almost felt like it was being pulled. Little by little it was extending further down and creating a new appendage. The same black and brown fur quickly overtook the long tail finished growing. &quot;I feel so good!&quot; it started wagging excitedly as Alan tested out some of the aspects of his body. He couldn&#39;t believe how much energy he had stored up inside him. He pulled the pants back up around his waist and thanks to the loss of a belly, they rested just underneath his tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what the little rabbit is up to...&quot; Alan muttered to himself, then quickly gave up on the idea as he thought about the lion carrying him. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll just go check on Paul...&quot; The smile returned as Alan started jogging towards the security station.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
&quot;Awww... Fuck yeah...&quot; Steven groaned as he felt another surge of pleasure run through him. His muscles continued to pulse and grow. It was the same with the golden hair covering his body. The trimmed beard and perfectly coifed hair had grown unbelievably wild around his face and then there was that strange feeling running down his back side. As soon as he placed Jack down on his bed, he went to go look at the long ropey tail running down his backside. A large brown tuft of hair grew at the end of it.<br />
<br />
Steven felt blood rush to his cock. He was horny again. Just looking at the sleeping Jack, he wanted to fuck the little rabbit&#39;s hole so badly. But Jack was too tuckered out. It&#39;d have to wait. At least for a little while. For now, Steven would have to satisfy himself. Before going to the bathroom to do so, he makes sure to grab the colored eggs and put most of them into a bag. Then added a few more of his own that he ate for breakfast, just in case Jack had been counting. Though, looking at his soft breathing, and the way his hand rested on his cock, it was hard to think he was thinking about much at all. <br />
<br />
After Steven finished and cleaned himself up, he crawled into bed with Jack. &quot;Goodnight,&quot; he kissed the other man on the forehead and wrapped his muscular arms around Jack.</p>
