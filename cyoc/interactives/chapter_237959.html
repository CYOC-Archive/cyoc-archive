<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kim&#39;s left nipple-mouth sighed and smiled as her upper pair of arms lowered the pair of binoculars from her eyes - having monitored Jennifer and Kayla, and their entire freaky family, intermittently over the course of many years, she had witnessed and recorded numerous important events, some hilarious, some tragic, some visceral, some tough.  Thankfully, many were pretty heartwarming - Kayla and Jennifer finishing college, getting married and landing their jobs, buying and moving into their first home.  The births of their five children, workplace promotions, the kids&#39; track and field games and birthday parties, movie nights.  Even the simple events brough warmth into her heart.  Pancake breakfasts.  Doing laundry.  Comforting hugs.  <br />
Jen&#39;s accidental sneeze-cumming.  Kayla accidentally leaking milk all over the place.  Lily&#39;s adventures with her cock-tongue.  Juniper and Rosemary simply existing.  Iris eating . . .<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s right nipple mouth grunted and moaned as one of the penises she was stimulating and two of the vaginas she was simulating almost simultaneously reached orgasmic climax.  Vagina spasming, testicles clenching, and back and long tail arching, she blew a long, hot load of spunk down another orifice that hadn&#39;t yet finished as vaginal fluids squirted messily over her lower right arm&#39;s hand, hips, the front of her tail, and the ground.<br />
And yes, Kim enjoyed (and believed she was probably addicted to) the bizarre sexual antics and the practically entirely sexual existence of the loving couple and their children.<br />
Kyle/Kayla&#39;s original curse, Jen&#39;s &quot;gift&quot; curse, the passionate make-out and love-making, the mind-blowing locker-room shower sex, Thomas/Tanya and Alex getting roped in, and all the, rather consistent, exceedingly erotic events that had taken place over the next decade and a half provided a constant stream of &quot;mental simulation&quot; that made an initially tortuous and unbearable job more than comfortable.  She was currently masturbating to a showertime self-love session that Juniper and Rosemary were engaging in.  By lying on their horse half&#39;s back and arching their back just right, the two twins were able to &quot;make out&quot; with each other.  It was undeniably overstimulating due to the fact that they both shared sensations of their shared body, and with this in mind, and the fact that a living, hypersensitive girl-penis was making out with a girl with a sopping-wet horse vagina-face, in heat, the two should have reached mind-breaking orgasm almost instantaneously.  But they hadn&#39;t just yet tonight, after weeks of practice, stretching out the heavenly pleasure for as long as &quot;humanly&quot; possible while pleasuring their breasts as well.  And Kim was loving it.<br />
<br />
Being &quot;on-watch&quot; allowed Kim to always successfully chase that &quot;feel-good&quot; sensation, in her mind, heart, and groin.<br />
<br />
However, again, it could not be said that Kim was simply here for sexual entertainment.  She had been assigned by her Master to follow this wholesome romantic and familial experience since its inception, and over the course of some 17 years, it was undeniable that she had grown a sense of fond attachment, familial and sexual to the &quot;Smiths.&quot;  As mentally, physically, and sexually fucked up as they were, she would not hesitate to kill to protect them from any threats - she didn&#39;t need her Master or any other assistants to tell her to do so if need be.<br />
In a way, she considered herself some sort of perverted &quot;godmother&quot; - blushing immediately at the thought.  At least her sexual appetite served a good purpose now.<br />
<br />
Finishing up her self-pleasure session, Kim sighed and laid on her back.  After looking up at the stars for a moment, she stretched, uncoiling her lower half as she &quot;stood up,&quot; resting her arms on the balcony of the house across the street from the Smiths.  Her Master had granted her the standard magical equipment that made her invisible, intangible, and completely silent for covert, close-range monitoring and surveillance, but not even Kim was perverted enough to pleasure herself inside the subjects&#39; household.  Mel and Lee, the two newcomers she had been asked to supervise for two weeks, probably were, and were no doubt, at this very moment, inside Tanya&#39;s and Alex&#39;s house doing god-knows what sexual tomfoolery.<br />
<br />
Kim was just one of the many Assistants of their Master, personally assigned to monitor one of the innumerable &quot;projects&quot; their Master engaged in to provide updates on the lives and sexual activities of the &quot;subjects.&quot;  Their Master could certainly do the monitoring and updates herself - but she was often either too horny, lazy, bored, forgetful, or inebriated (and interestingly, sometimes depressed) to perform this task, and instead assigned this job to her many Assistants, who would give her updates in the form of reports, images, and videos on how her many victims worldwide were faring over time.  Assistants typically had around 50 to 200 &quot;projects&quot; that they monitored at any given time.  Kim&#39;s favorite case was the &quot;Transform or Dare Curse,&quot; one so large that it was often shared by anywhere from 50 to 200 of her coworkers - spread across location in the town and by dimension.  And of all the dimensions, time branches, and &quot;subjects&quot; she monitored pertaining to the &quot;town curse,&quot; the &quot;Smith family,&quot; and Tanya and Alex, had to be her favorite.  Kim would normally be watching the busty, anus-mouthed beauty and her phallic bodymate sexually eat dinner at this time, but the newcomers, Mel and Lee, were temporarily doing so for a few weeks to gain some experience.  In all likelihood, they were probably adding some of their own juices to Tanya&#39;s spaghetti she was recording herself eat tonight.<br />
<br />
All Assistants, Kim for example, had wonderfully strange and &quot;freaky&quot; sexual mutations that fit whatever mood, kink, sexual interest, or level of arousal or sadism their Master was feeling at the time of their transformations, or &quot;punishment,&quot; as she called it.  They had, after all, wronged their Master in some way or another, unintentionally or maliciously - when they were still fully humans.  <br />
Most often, the severity and nature of the &quot;punishment&quot; pertained to the nature of the &quot;crimes&quot; the Assistants had committed . . .</p>
