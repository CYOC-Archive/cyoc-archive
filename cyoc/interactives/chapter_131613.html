<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She got exited at the thoughts running through her head. When her brother knocked on the bathroom door, “Hey Chris, I heard you shout, or something. Did you want something,” he said to her, “No, I didn’t even call!! Get out you creep!!”<br />
“Jesus, calm down Chris, I’m just asking,”<br />
Then he walked away, closing the bedroom door behind him. Christine hated him, she knew he was a pervert, he’d always want to come out with her friends just to stare at their asses, she could tell he was just trying to catch a look at her naked. No, she didn’t jump to conclusions, he’d been trying to catch a glimpse at her naked for months, as soon as he hit puberty, he’d been all over her, trying to see just a bit of her naked, she wouldn’t let it happen.<br />
<br />
She hated the name Christine, well she didn’t hate ‘Christine’, but she hated ‘Chris’ as an abbreviation of it, it sounded too much like she was a guy, and she looked like a guy, with her curveless body, so when her family would call her Chris, anyone who heard would assume her pronouns were him and he. Then she has the sudden realisation, what if she didn’t look like a guy, what if she was sexy, people would know that she was a girl.<br />
<br />
She poked the Amulet on (since it turns off every 5 minutes if not being used) and though about how to become taller, she pressed the red spot but the realised, ‘how am I gonna become taller if it only makes one part of my body bigger,’ she stood there and thought for a bit, and then saw the room get smaller, she was getting bigger, and in doing so, taller. Why is this happening, then she realised her hand had been on the red spot the whole time, she took her finger off and it stopped. She realised that holding it down would make the effect affect her whole body.<br />
<br />
So now she was 5ft11, and her hoodie was revealing just the bottom of her belly button, so she pressed the blue spot and poked her belly, it slimmed down, like she had been on a diet her whole life, then she pressed the blue spot again with both her index fingers, and then poked th left side of her waist, it pushed in and made a curve kind of shape, she did the same on the other side. She couldn’t see the full effect due to her hoodie covering most of her body, she tried to take it off but her head was too big because her hoodie was made for her original 5ft2 height and size, so she though how she could take it off, she could make her head smaller, but that would look weird. So instead of taking off her hoodie, she could move it out the way.<br />
<br />
She pressed the red spot and then put her hand underneath the now tight purple hoodie, she poked her breast and then it pushed out, making a lump appear under her hoodie, due to the hoodie pressing against her torso, hugging every little bump, it appeared like a ballon being filled with air, it was as big as an orange, but that wasn’t the size Christine wanted, it didn’t even feel real to her, she wanted the full experience of having big boobs, so she pressed the blue spot and put it back to its original size. <br />
<br />
She then with both index fingers, pressed the yellow spot, and then poked both her breasts, her chest rose up through the hoodie, they felt like two lumps of putty on her chest, she let go of them after feeling her B cup chest, and then did the same thing, but she wanted to feel the expansion, so pressed her fingers deep into her flesh and kept holding them afterwards, not even letting go, her breasts rose and made a dome shape in the hoodie, but instead of just growing a cup size, they kept growing. Christine was confused, but didn’t let go, it felt like, well they were getting bigger, and meatier, she let go when they were F cups, the size of her head (before she grew bigger). They were huge, and as desired, they left her now very slim belly in view. She saw that the underside of her breasts were showing underneath the now very tight hoodie, it felt as though it were going to break, tear down the middle.<br />
<br />
This was her favourite hoodie, she had had it for 3 years (yes, she hadn’t grown for 3 years), so she decided she wouldn’t sacrifice it for her looks, she pressed the blue spot and touched the top of her head, this made her entire head shrink, to the size of her breasts, she slid the hoodie off leaving just a black long sleeve t-shirt.<br />
<br />
She grew her back to its original size, and then realised how big her boobs were, withough being pushed back by her once very tight hoodie, and now just held by her thin black t-shirt. Ask she looked down at her bust, she tipped forward and landed nearly face-first onto he tiled floor, luckily her breasts cushioned her landing so she didn’t hurt herself. She got back up and nearly fell back down, so she tried holding them in her hands, which sort of worked, but it wouldn’t help if she had to keep holding them all the time, she looked down at her hands, and saw the green spot, so she let go and tried to keep her balance, and slowly pushed the green spot and then poked her back. She felt her back get stronger, she tried moving, and her breasts weren’t as much trouble as before.<br />
<br />
She tried looking at her back and saw her butt, it was still pretty small, so she pressed the red spot with both fingers and poked her hips with one, it grew just past her shoulders, she thought that she would have to press each side, so she used the remaining one on it anyways, but didn’t let go. It grew to just nearly twice the size of her shoulder.<br />
<br />
She then pressed the yellow spot with both index fingers and grabbed her butt with both hands. It began to swell out, it reached past her head and then the size of her head, then the size of two watermelons, in width and length, then she let go, and did the same to her thighs, they plumped out the the size of her waist, which was pretty small.<br />
<br />
Christine now had huge boobs, a giant butt, a slim body, a face that looked the same. Then she realised she hadn’t changed her face, so she made her nose smaller, her cheeks thinner, her face have more of a point to it, bigger eyes, a smaller head, and finally, she made her lips bigger, not as big as before though, they were now the size of her index finger, not too big, but bigger.<br />
<br />
She though about what her family would think of it, and realised she didn’t want her family to see her like this, not out of embarrassment, but she felt they didn’t deserve to see her like this. She then realised that she was hotter than her Mom, she thinks, if she isn’t hot then she has messed up, due to the fact she was straight, she assumed boys liked this kind of thing. Then thinking about her family, she realised the only bit of muscle she added was on her back, so she pressed the Amulet’s green spot of the Amulet and held down, from what she gathered, if you down on a spot, it’s effects should affect the entire body, and she was right, she looked down to see her stomach gain abs, she poked it with her other hand, and saw her arm had gained some muscle, she let go so that she didn’t have too much muscle on her, but she wanted some muscle on her.<br />
<br />
She looked at herself in the mirror, she was a ‘Busty Skinny but Muscular Girl with a Hot Face and lots of Junk in the Trunk,’ she would say she’s the sexiest girl that she’s ever seen.<br />
<br />
Her boobs were huge, bigger than some peoples’ heads, her butt was like a bean bag, she could sit on the floor and be more comfortable than if she were sitting on a chair, she was so thin but also had good muscles that didn’t really stick out but were defiantly there, her lips could outdo most girls, her hips were nearly twice the size of her shoulders, her face was cute, and she was very tall for a girl.<br />
<br />
She smiles at herself in the mirror and sees the Amulet dangling from her neck, she doesn’t want anyone seeing it so looks for a place to hide it but can’t find anywhere. Suddenly she realises she can hide it in her cleavage, so she takes it off her neck and pushes it down into her breasts.<br />
<br />
She opens the bathroom door and looks round the corner to see if her brother is there, he wasn’t, she then opens the bedroom door and sees that he isn’t in the main area of the hotel room, and hears her brother in the other bedroom, she doesn’t even want to know, she walks out the front door and is standing right outside her hotel room door.<br />
<br />
‘Now what to do,’ she thinks to herself..</p>
