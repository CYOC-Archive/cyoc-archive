<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She awoke to hearing Dustin's mom screaming at him and them Ty's former foster mother turned her wrath upon her.<br />
Calling her every name in the book from hussy to bitch, Jane chased Ty out of the house with a broom. Standing naked in front of the house, Ty wondered what to do. Just as she was thinking to turn herself back to a male a noise from behind distracted her.<br />
Turning, a sinking sensation flooded her as a cop car pulled up.<br />
Stepping out, the woman cop whistled and muttered, &quot;Better take care of this before it becomes a sticky situation.<br />
Assuming a business like manner the cop walked over to Ty and asked, &quot;What's your name sweetheart?&quot;<br />
Lying with ease, Ty said &quot;Megan&quot; having always liked that name.<br />
&quot;Well Megan,&quot; The cop responded, &quot;I think we should get you home.&quot;<br />
&quot;What am I going to do,&quot; Ty, now Megan, thought.<br />
&quot;I don't have a home,&quot; She said. &quot;I live on the streets. I met a nice boy named Dustin, only when I came home with him for dinner I fell asleep in his bed. I had a blanket to cover myself, but I forgot it in the house and I don't really want to go get it if I have to face Dustin's mom again.&quot;<br />
The female officer nodded and said, &quot;I'll take care of it. But first...&quot;<br />
Walking back to her cruiser, she produced a blanket from the back and wrapped it around Megan. After that, she turned and started up the front walk to Ty's old home. As the cop was wringing the bell, Megan, with some difficulty, willed the first blanket into existence.<br />
She listened as the cop talked to Jane and then heard silence.<br />
Turning she saw the cop standing at an open door and then Jane reappeared and threw a rather ratty and old looking blanket out the door before bidding the cop good day and closing the door.<br />
Walking toward Megan, the cop replied, &quot;I'm going to take you somewhere were you can get a change of clothes and have a decent place to sleep.&quot;<br />
Before she could say anything Megan was ushered into the back of the cruiser and rushed to a local Juvenile hall.<br />
As she stepped into the hall, Megan thought, &quot;As soon as I am alone, I'll change back and slip away.&quot;<br />
But there never came a time for her to 'slip away'. First she was measured for clothes, then asked a bunch a question, some rather personal, she didn't know how to answer and then she was ushered into a doctors office where a female nurse started to poke and prod her.<br />
And then the embarrassment of having her legs in a set of stirrups and a female doctor coming to poke around her vagina with a plastic piece. Afterwords, she was ushered off to supper and then a bedroom.<br />
In the bedroom was another girl who introduced herself as Kimberly and when Megan asked if there was anyway to get some alone time, Kimberly said that a new arrivals are put on a watch so they don't something stupid like suicide of running away.<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; huffed Megan.<br />
Megan was taken off of watch after a month and as soon as she was able to she found the most private place, the girls bathroom and tried to will herself back to being Ty.<br />
Straining, she began to see spots before her eyes and then after a couple of seconds, she stopped. Letting the spots clear, she tried again; only this time with the spots came a wave of nausea.<br />
Turning quickly, she began to have dry heaves in the toilet when she heard the door open.<br />
&quot;Megan, are you in here?&quot; She heard Kimberly ask in a hesitant manner.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Megan gasped as the dry heaves subsided.<br />
&quot;The doctor, she would like to see you,&quot; Kimberly said casually.<br />
&quot;Okay, I'll be there in a minute.&quot; Megan replied.<br />
Hearing the door close, she sat for a minute and wondered what was going on, more specifically on why her powers no longer worked.<br />
Stepping out of the bathroom, she decided to try something. Looking at a mean and sexist boy name Dirk, she thought on how good it would be to have him learn about the farer sex. <br />
Thinking it through, she clouded everyones mind first so they wouldn't notice and then began to try and change Dirk.<br />
It happened instantaneously. Dirk doubled over and the changes worked faster then Megan thought that it would. Dirks muscular frame shrunk to that of a delicate and lithe teenage girl. The noticeable bulge in his tight shorts flattened and disappeared completely.<br />
Thinking that Dirk's chest should push out soon, she watched in amazement as dirk instead began to shrink.<br />
Dirk shrank until he resembled a six year old girl. Freaking out Megan tried to get the change to stop, but she only succeeded in making it worse as Dirk still remained a six year old, but a lovely bushy red tail sprouted out of his back side.<br />
In fact, as the the ears formed, Dirk now look more like a six year old female in a over-sized shirt, with a pair of mens shorts and underwear puddled around her feet, but with a bushy fail tail and a pair of ears to match. It was then that the transformation stopped and everyones mind became unclouded.<br />
As Megan left the room, she could hear shouts of confusion from people noticing Dirk's new form and shouts from a girl demanding to know what had happened to her. &quot;Well, my powers still work, just not on me.&quot; She reasoned.<br />
Stepping into the doctors office, she was instructed to have a seat. Sitting down, the nurse excused herself and left in a hurry.<br />
Noticing a file with her name on it, she opened it and started to scan it only to stop when she came to the part the OBGYN had sent back.<br />
In bold black letter it read: Pregnancy confirmed. Not human though. Further test needed. Unborn child appears to be vulpine in species.<br />
It was then that she heard the door open and the Doctor say, &quot;We need to have a talk.&quot;</p>
