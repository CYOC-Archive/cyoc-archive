<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the wizard left the cabin to take an urgent phone call, Michael and Sofya proceeded to scream at Freddy through their muffled scarves. <br />
<br />
“Freddy!” they yelled. “Wake up!”<br />
<br />
At first, Fido didn’t move a muscle. He was out cold. However, after a minute or so, he began to stir on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael thought to himself. “Wake up. We need you. Please Freddy. Please help us. You’re our only hope.”<br />
<br />
Finally, in what seemed like a miraculous feat, Fido managed to stir himself awake. <br />
<br />
“Freddy!” Michael and Sofya yelled excitedly, the sound muffled by their scarves. <br />
<br />
“Man” Freddy thought to himself, as Fido slowly shook his head. “Those tranquilizer darts are powerful enough to take out a live elephant. It’s amazing that I woke up so fast. Or did I?”<br />
<br />
Fido proceeded to look up at a tied up Michael and Sofya, who seemed grateful that he had awakened from his induced slumber. <br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael yelled in a muffled tone. “You have to untie us. Quick, before he comes back.”<br />
<br />
Taking stock of the situation, Fido noticed that there was a muzzle attached to his snout.<br />
<br />
“Uh oh” Freddy thought to himself. “How am I supposed to get this thing off?”<br />
<br />
After pausing for a second, Fido began to furiously shake his head. After a number of attempts, the muzzle miraculously unsnapped and fell off of his mouth to the floor below. Fido let out an excited bark in response.<br />
<br />
“Shhhh!” Michael hushed, the sound muffled by his scarf. “Quiet, Freddy. You don’t want to get Sofya’s father’s attention.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry” Freddy thought to himself, as he proceeded to look down at his furry body.<br />
<br />
Tightly bound rope secured his paws and legs together. Struggling to free himself for a moment, Fido stopped to look up at Sofya and tried to communicate with her with telepathically. <br />
<br />
“Sofya” Freddy called to her in his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Sofya looked at him, confusedly, as she stared Fido.<br />
<br />
“Freddy?” she asked in her thoughts. “Are you trying to talk to me in my thoughts again?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Sofya. Listen. I need you to think about the ropes and try to change them into something that will easily fall off.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know if I can do it.”<br />
<br />
“You have to try, Sofya.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure if I even know how.”<br />
<br />
“Well, you have to at least try, for all of our sakes.”<br />
<br />
Sofya paused, before she gave an anxiously awaiting Fido her answer.<br />
<br />
“I’ll try.”<br />
<br />
Sofya closed her eyes, as she began to imagine the ropes as spaghetti or another slippery material.<br />
<br />
“It’s not working” she called to Freddy in her thoughts, as she opened her eyes worriedly.<br />
<br />
“Then just try to loosen them enough so I can bite through them” he replied in his thoughts. <br />
<br />
After Sofya closed her eyes again for a moment, Freddy could feel the tightly bound rope begin to slightly sag. Seeing this as a sign, Fido began to gnaw at the ropes with his sharp teeth. After a minute of chewing, they fell of of him and he was freed of his bondage. <br />
<br />
“You did it Freddy!” Michael exclaimed through his scarf. “You bit through the rope!”<br />
<br />
Fido stood up and ran over to Michael. He jumped up on his chair and bit off the scarf that tied his mouth shut. <br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael said, relieved that he could finally speak again. “You came to rescue us.”<br />
<br />
Fido barked, as he hopped back down and up to Sofya to remove the scarf from around her mouth.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” she replied lovingly. “My hero.”<br />
<br />
Fido growled at her, as he went over to Michael to begin loosening his ropes. <br />
<br />
“Guess not” Sofya said.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael called to him nervously.<br />
<br />
Fido looked up at him, as he paused his gnawing to hear what Michael had to say.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” he continued. “Don’t start with me. Sofya may have some magic that could come in handy if the wizard comes back. Undo her ties first.”<br />
<br />
Fido whined, as he looked up at Michael nervously.<br />
<br />
“It’s for the best, Freddy. Trust me on this.”<br />
<br />
Fido shook his head no, as Sofya looked at Michael with concern strewn on her face. <br />
<br />
“It is, Freddy. Sofya may be the only one powerful enough to help us in defeating the wizard, as he is her father.”<br />
<br />
Fido shook his head again, as he tried to bite at Michael’s ropes again.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael insisted again.<br />
<br />
Fido whined, as he stopped chewing for a second.<br />
<br />
“Trust me on this. Please.”<br />
<br />
A tear rolled down Michael’s face, as Fido began to cry as well.<br />
<br />
“Besides, this is all my fault anyways. If it wasn’t for me insisting on going to the magic shop last week and making you take that stupid ring, we never would have ended up in this predicament in the first place.”<br />
<br />
“Oh Michael” Freddy thought, as Fido whimpered at Michael loudly. “Don’t say that.”<br />
<br />
“If anyone deserves to be freed, it’s Sofya. If you can get me out, great. If not, well….”<br />
<br />
Michael paused, while Fido hesitated to move. Sofya looked at Michael sympathetically. <br />
<br />
“Wow” she quietly thought to herself. “After all I’ve done to try to break up their relationship, he still insists that I’m rescued first. You know, he’s not such a bad guy after all.”<br />
<br />
After Michael motioned over to Sofya with his head, Fido reluctantly relented. He hopped down to make his way over to her chair to work on chewing off her ropes. After what seemed like ages, but was only a matter of seconds, Fido managed to undo Sofya’s ties and she stood up excitedly.<br />
<br />
“I’m free!” Sofya exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Barking happily, Fido quickly made his way over to Michael to begin working on undoing his ties. He seemed to be making progress and was close to letting his boyfriend, his lover, free. <br />
<br />
“Almost” Freddy thought to himself, as Fido continued to gnaw at the tight rope that bound Michael’s hands together. <br />
<br />
Before he could rescue his boyfriend, however….</p>
