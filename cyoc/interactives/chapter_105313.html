<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunday evening, after dinner, John knocked at Brady house&#39;s door. He tried to find an excuse to delay that bath, but he perfectly knew that, not coming to visit Mary, could induce her to suspect on his real intentions. So he had knocked hoping in God&#39;s help, or something similiar.<br />
There the door was opened by Mary, that in that moment was cleaning the floor. She smiled and said “finally you came! How do you feel? Let&#39;s go for a small walk” thinking they were going to do that bath in the river. She went out with him and, while walking, she placed one hand on her womb and had a pained expression. John smiled at her and said “I&#39;m fine, thank you. What&#39;s about you? I didn&#39;t see you this morning in Church, but there were your relatives... so I thought you were having some problems: it&#39;s strange not to see you there on Sunday”.<br />
She blushed for embarrassment and whispered “Oh this is so embarrassing to confess... I&#39;ve never had this before and I&#39;m so confused...” John thought he have understood what was the problem, but preferred to wait she said it. “Ehm... this sound strange but... How can I say? I... I am in my time of the month... oh I didn&#39;t know this was so terrible!”. Yes, as many born-male of that century, she knew almost nothing about menstruations. John giggled having found the solution to his problem. He tried to make show a sorry expression to be more convincing “oh... what a pity! I was hoping we can do that bath this night!” Mary seemed not to understand and said “but we are going to do it, John... aren&#39;t we?”. John shook his head “absolutly not, lady. Don&#39;t you remember? The wich said us that having the bath during your period almost surely will kill you”. Mary went pale not wanting to believe him “John, I don&#39;t remember the witch said this... Tell me you are joking... this is not funny”. Again, hiding a giggle, John shook his head and put a hand on his heart “I swear it! You didn&#39;t ever had period before, but I can assure you that forget things in that time is a common problem” he was lying obviously, but Mary didn&#39;t know nothing about this, being her firs (and she hoped last) time, so she had to trust him. The worst thing was when John said “it will last a week”. She went pale again and screamed “what?!? But next week is full moon!! We have to wait two weeks so... this isn&#39;t fair!” She was really worried but she couldn&#39;t help.<br />
That was going to be the worst week of her life.<br />
On Tuesday, John and Gabrielle had a walk through fields. When was dinner time, John was invited to their house. Mary look at him and Gabrielle hoping she would be soon at his place. During the evening Gabrielle and John said the family they had an important announcement: they&#39;ve decide to get marry the next week, the pastor had agreed on the date! “We&#39;ll have dinner together in my farm, then” John said. Mary was shocked! She burst into tears. “Oh Mary! You sweat! Are you moved for your sister?” Gabrielle said caressing her hand... Mary was furious but she knew she had to say “oh yes... I&#39;m so... happy” and continued crying. Then she stood up, having problems to stop her cry “excuse me” and go up stairs to her bedroom. After a while John said he wanted to talk to her and reach her room, entering without knocking. She was still crying on her bed “how could you make this?! That was supposed to be the best day in my life and you have stolen it!” she muttered. John smiled and said “calm down lady... I thought that since we have to stay like this for all the next week just for your period I could be rewarded by having sex as a male before changing again into a girl”. Mary didn&#39;t answer more, knowing she couldn&#39;t do nothing but wait. Then John, while leaving the room, pointed her skirt and said giggling “it seems you&#39;ve forget you&#39;re in your time of the month”. Mary looked at her skirt messed with menstrual blood and, still crying, she locked the door and took off her dress to change the cotton she was using to tampon her flow. But while she saw her naked reflection  in the mirror, she said herself “if he is going to have sex with my body, well I think I could do this with hers” and said this, she touched her breasts, having a bit of pleasure. Then, not knowing exactly how to do it in the right manner, she put a finger into her vagina and tried masturbating for a while. But seing blood falling down, she horrified for her gestured and stopped. She rapid cleaned her finger and dressed up in a nightdress. She had not been able to reach orgasm and thought that probably women have no kind of sex pleasure. She went to bed and prayed God to forgive her sin.</p>
