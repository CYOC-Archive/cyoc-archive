<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff got home from school the next day and worked on his math homework. He asked his little sister to watch tv and not make any extra noise. Once done with math he realized he needed to write a story in the style of the author he was reading in English class. He told his sister where he would be, (because lord knows she will initiate a manhunt in 25 minutes if he doesn&#39;t tell her.) and went to his bedroom computer to access his word processor program.<br />
<br />
Upon jiggling his mouse the Chronivac program popped up, reminding him what he was doing yesterday. A message box appeared indicating that he should be 20-33% through the loading phase but is at >1%. Jeff cringed acknowledging the confirmation. He was offered to remove the DILF package or continue. Clicking Continue, the machine offered to help him habituate to using the vape regularly, which Jeff knew he needed, and once opting for yes, the machine offered to use the Chronivac to bring him forward in his transformation, either by completing it and sending him to the maintenance phase, or by progressing his changes to where he would be if he had been using the device appropriately. Jeff selected no, his whole reason in selecting this was to gradually move into a new and better life without needing to set everything up manually. <br />
<br />
Upon declining the instant transformations he was offered a more rapid progression to help him catch up, at which point he would progress normally... Jeff liked that idea and once he clicked yes another option appeared. &#39;Always progress: If you intend to see this through, this option stops your body from lowering saturation progress until the maintenance phase is reached. The Chronivac will halt regressing over extended periods you cannot maintain access like sleeping and airplane rides won&#39;t decrease your progress.&#39; Jeff selected yes.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled the vape out of his pocket. He had taken it to school but was running behind and didn&#39;t use it while getting dressed, forgot about at the bus stop, and while coming home, so he hadn&#39;t used it since mid yesterday. He puffed on it, listening to the strange hiss it makes as whatever chemicals are in there get aerosolized, and exhaled.<br />
<br />
His excitement for it seemed to dull as it felt familiar and his interest in it waned as it no longer felt new. He began working on his writing assignment but every time he needed to think for more than 5 seconds he found himself taking a hit. By the time he was halfway through the paper the bar was at 7%, &quot;Wow, almost half a day of progress in an hour and a half!&quot; Jeff stood up and stretched, heading to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
He looked at himself in the mirror scrutinizing his height, weight, muscles, facial hair growth, body hair, but couldn&#39;t be sure about any &quot;changes.&quot; Frustrated he ripped on the vape he didn&#39;t realize he brought with. Almost 10% and no changes! Absurd!<br />
<br />
He took another rip and exhaled slowly through his nose, figuring that would be another way for it to get into his blood stream considering nosebleeds. He calmed down and took a piss pulling his underwear down and putting the elastic band under his balls pushing them away from his body, letting them cool. It felt good letting them get some air, he never did this before, why was he...? Jeff realized his balls were nearly twice their normal size, making them hang lower, and making this maneuver possible in the first place.<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned in excitement, squeezing his bladder before his growing erection stopped the possibility of getting to empty. &quot;Fuck yeah.&quot; he whispered taking another hit while stroking. The orgasm was intense and he could feel his prostate pulsate as he got off, expelling four times his normal volume. Which still wasn&#39;t much due to his masturbation frequency being a horny 16 year old.<br />
<br />
He took another hit and washed his hands, unaware he got the order of operations wrong. He was drying his hands and glanced a final time in the mirror, he had the thought that a tattoo from his back to his mid upper arm would look sick. Something that could be hidden for an interview but yell &#39;Fuck you!&#39; to some stuffy corporation after he was hired. Jeff shook his head and smirked, where did that thought come from?<br />
<br />
Jeff got back to his project and continued working completing it by dinner time. After dinner he was feeling on edge and retreated to the comfort of his room finishing his homework before watching some videos on the computer to close out the night. By midnight he was surprised his parents hadn&#39;t yelled at him to get to bed and saw he had reached 38%.<br />
<br />
Upon awakening before even rolling out of bed Jeff grabbed the vape and took a couple hits. He threw on old clothes grabbing fresh clothes and headed to the bathroom setting them down for later. He pissed, and pulled out his phone to see that 5:30 was still too early to use the electric shaver or shower. He went downstairs and started a pot of coffee brewing, he poured himself the first cup while it was still brewing, and went outside pulling out his phone as he lit up a cigarette. He was halfway through his second one before he was awake enough to realize he was smoking, that he needed to shave, and that he was drinking coffee at 5:50am.<br />
<br />
The ashtray on the table was filled with butts but most were from his father. &#39;Wait, he never... No, he quit when I was born.&#39; Jeff realized reality was shifting more than he anticipated. The existence where Mike never smoked was fading away, as was the one where he quit when Jeff was born. The surreality of it faded and Jeff remembered he always equated smoking with being an adult. Dad got to do it at 18 and I&#39;m doing it at 18 too! &#39;Wait, I&#39;m 18 now?&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s original attitude and reaction towards what was becoming his new life faded, replaced by the attitude that would make these choices. He shook his head and took his last gulp of coffee, followed by another couple drags before stamping his butt out in his dad&#39;s ashtray. He looked at his phone, 5:59. The light to his parents bedroom was about to turn on.<br />
<br />
He snuck back into the house pouring another cup of coffee as his parents alarm when off. He&#39;s an adult but wants to avoid the conflict of them finding out he smokes because they can still make it a problem. He took his coffee cup with him to the bathroom, keeping it away from the sink as he maintained his stubble, then jumped into the shower. He knew he was taller, stronger, and by his estimate looked better, but his 16 year old self fell like 2 years ago away, and this felt normal.<br />
<br />
He downed the coffee and headed to his room where he dumped his old clothes into the hamper and took another hit or two. 6:15. He grabbed his empty coffee cup from the bathroom and knocked on his sisters door yelling that the bathroom is free as he went down to find his mom making breakfast. She smiled and thanked him for making a pot of coffee as he poured himself another cup, she handed him a plate heaping full of eggs and cheese and started a new batch for Mike who would be walking in any minute. <br />
<br />
Jeff tried to think of what his day held, but memories of several after school jobs and friend groups flooded his mind. He greeted his dad as Mike walked in just as Jeff was finishing breakfast and putting his dishes in the dishwasher. Jeff said goodbye as he slipped on his shoes and went to the driveway. Jeff looked at his beater of a car, it looked decent but was old and bound to have problems soon. He couldn&#39;t wait to finish the motorcycle driver training he was getting and buy a cheap bike he&#39;d been saving for so he wouldn&#39;t be desperate if his wheels were broken. <br />
<br />
&#39;Were backup plans to ensure complete independence always so important to him?&#39; Jeff didn&#39;t think so but wasn&#39;t so sure. He pulled out his vape and took a hit as he walked to his car. He threw his backpack into the passenger seat and as he was walking around to the driver side, his back and right arm itched, black began crawling over his shoulder and despite his initial alarm he soon realized it was just the tattoo he always dreamed of. Chuckling to himself and pleased with the outcome he continued but a flickering on the driveway grabbed his attention. As he stared a motorcycle materialized and his clothes shifted to be an armor jacket, leg protection and a helmet materialized on him. He realized that he had been hitting the vape all morning and he&#39;s forcing reality to warp around him!<br />
<br />
(Despite being &quot;taller and stronger&quot; it could mean he went from 16 to 18 or he went from average to hulking. I was intentionally vague on what it meant so others can take this any direction they want to. I also left him young enough to still have a significant change of heart and his teenage rebelliousness and desperation for independence could be a phase or backlash against unaccepted feelings. Regardless, he is now primed to transform and over the next 1.5 - 2.5 days his routine, relationships, and body will completely change. But how?)</p>
