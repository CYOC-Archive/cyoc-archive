<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Watching Selena descend into toddlerhood seemed to distract Renee from her own regression. The young girl taking up more and more of her time.<br />
<br />
Renee watched as Selena became even smaller at the age of 5, the girl seeming to forget more and more of her adult life. Renee, now 20, was hard pressed to keep up with the energetic kindergarten child during outside rec. Selena had bounded into the rec yard, removing her shoes and socks as she raced through the small grass covered area. At first bemused by the girls behavior, Renee became concerned as she approached the barbwire fence. <br />
<br />
On the day Selena became 4, Renee was shocked how much smaller the girl had become. Selena was now waist high to the 19 year old. For fun Renee had placed Selena in one of her shirts, the two giggling like school children as they realized the shirt completely covered Selena, resting just above her ankles.<br />
<br />
Once more Renee spent her day caring for the preschooler, frowning as she noticed Leticia and Tracy seemed uninterested in Selenas plight. The two 19 year olds spent the day lounging in the rec yard, tanning their firm teenage bodies. &quot;Not that those tans will mean much in a week,&quot; Renee grumbled as she thought of how the two of them would be back in grade school next week. <br />
<br />
Renee though did not think of her predicament, she too would be a child in another week. Instead she focused on keeping the 4 year old Selena happy. What worried her though was the mental decline Selena was experiencing.<br />
<br />
The four year old talked with a lisp now, her face continuing to round as she edged closer to two. The girl was also beginning to have trouble reading, asking Renee to sound out simpler words as the day wore on. As the two settled in for the night Selena seemed to completely lose the ability to read, forcing Renee to translate whatever Selena asked. Not that Renee minded reading to the girl.<br />
<br />
Renee was alarmed though by Selenas decent from four to three. It started simply enough, Selena would have a look of alarm on her face as she raced to the bathroom. Renee at first chalked it up to the girl having a tiny bladder. That changed mid day when Selena had her first accident. <br />
<br />
Selena had been happily coloring when her eyes suddenly bulged. The girls lip began to tremble as a rather large wet spot appeared on her pants. &quot;I sorry,&quot; she whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its okay Selena,&quot; a now 18 year old Renee soothed. &quot;Accidents happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Renee knew better though. Selena had regressed to the point of losing her toilet training. For the foreseeable future, she would be in diapers at Lolita. Explaining that to Selena though would prove to be a challenge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not baby,&quot; Selena grumbled, folding her arms as she scowled up at Renee. &quot;I know your a big girl Selena,&quot; Renee said calmly. &quot;But these aren&#39;t diapers. They&#39;re big girl pants. If you want to stay here you have to wear them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selena bit her lip apprehensively, she didn&#39;t want to be away from Renee. Nodding she now allowed Renee to slide the training pants onto Selena.<br />
<br />
Renee would now find herself not only watching Selena but changing her diaper. Groaning in frustration she decided to just have Selena walk around in a tshirt and training pants. &quot;How can a kid that small pee this much,&quot; she thought. Despite Selena&#39;s initial misgivings she seemed to take to the training pants very quickly. It alarmed Renee slightly as the little girl appeared to completely forget about not only toilet training but a good portion of her adult life.<br />
<br />
On the morning Selena became 2, a now 17 year old Renee stretched as she glanced down at the tiny girl by her side. Selena was tiny now, a toddler with dark brown hair, a round face, and a small body with baby fat. The girl had placed her thumb in her mouth as she now sucked contentedly on it. She also appeared to have wet herself during the night, Renee noticing the heavy, and slightly larger night time diaper she had placed the girl in before bed.<br />
<br />
Sighing Renee moved mechanically, removing the girls diaper as she began cleaning Selena. It amazed her that the girl didn&#39;t even flinch, still sleeping soundly as Renee fitted a smaller diaper on the girl. &quot;Wake up sleepy head,&quot; Renee whispered.<br />
<br />
Selena blinked, pulling her thumb from her mouth as she blinked her large brown eyes. Turning to Renee she held her chubby arms. &quot;Up,&quot; she asked in her adorable toddler voice. Renee smiled warmly, hoisting the tiny girl up. It amazed her how light Selena was now as the girl placed her in a bear hug.<br />
<br />
As the two made there way into the dayroom Renee could already see Leticia and Tracy eating. The now 17 year olds talking in an animated fashion like high schoolers in study hall. Renee paid them no mind, sitting down as she now helped Selena eat her meal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Renee its time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Renee turned to see several officers and a doctor enter the dayroom. Every instinct told her to fight but what would that do. She would still lose Selena, scare the girl, possibly hurt Selena in the process of trying to protect her. Selena couldn&#39;t stay here, it was time for her to go. Fighting back tears she now smiled down at the girl in her lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Selena,&quot; she said softly. &quot;The doctor wants to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ray nay come,&quot; Selena asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its a special doctor just for you baby girl,&quot; she smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll be waiting right here when you get back. It will just take a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selena seemed to believe Renee as the 17 year old handed the tiny 2 year old to the doctor. &quot;Bye nay,&quot; Selena waved. &quot;I be back sun.&quot; <br />
<br />
Renee smiled putting on a brave face as the guards escorted Selena out. She didn&#39;t want to upset the girl or breakdown in front of the C.O.s. As soon as Selena was out of the block, Renee put her head down, sobbing like she had lost her own daughter.</p>
