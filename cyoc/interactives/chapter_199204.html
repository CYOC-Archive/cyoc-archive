<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The werehyena pack were assembled together in their hyena forms that night in the forest on the von Karnstein grounds. Selena had called a meeting to introduce the two newest members of the pack, Harper Browning and Ellie Rubenstein. Some of them already knew Ellie, but Harper was new enough that introductions were a necessity. Tatiana also tagged along; this seemed like as good a time as any to come out as a vampire to her friend Ellie.<br />
<br />
Selena stepped through the treeline, the two new pack members following close behind her. The young alpha willed hir change to begin, though the other two opted to remain human for the moment so as to familiarize their new packmates with their human forms. Harper gazed around in wonder. All seven of these magnificent creatures were like something out of her wildest furry fantasies or the pages of her sketchbook. They were tall and gorgeously muscled, their roughly human shapes topped with hyena heads and covered with thick fur. Best of all, a gargantuan cock dangled between each packmate&#39;s thighs, crying out to be stroked, fondled, and licked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here we are,&quot; said Selena. &quot;Girls, could you please introduce yourselves to your new pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harper went first. &quot;Hi guys, I&#39;m Harper Browning. I&#39;m new, not just to the pack, but to Stokerville in general. I come from Colorado originally, and I&#39;ve been active in the furry fandom since I was about thirteen. Two of my favorite art subjects are hyenas and herms, and now I actually am one! Loving it so far, guys. I can&#39;t wait to meet all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellie spoke next. &quot;Hey everyone, it&#39;s Ellie Rubenstein. If you&#39;ve seen me around before, you probably notice I look a little different.&quot; She sadly patted her flat tummy and its rocky abs. &quot;An unfortunate side effect of the transformation. Yeah, I mostly joined the pack to stick with Harper. I honestly didn&#39;t expect to completely change my body away from the one she fell in love with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harper stroked Ellie&#39;s abs soothingly. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Ellie. Fat or fit, you&#39;ll always be the love of my life. It&#39;s never been about what you look like or how soft your belly is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellie sniffled and smiled sadly. &quot;Yeah, thanks. Doesn&#39;t make me miss the ol&#39; gut cushion any less, though. Seriously, how am I supposed to jiggle this?!&quot; she slapped futilely at her nonexistent gut. It remained taut, tight, and firm. &quot;Sorry, am I derailing this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; said Selena. &quot;That&#39;s the point of a pack. To band together and help each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And, like, make zillions of cute heinous cubs!&quot; Ashlee chimed in.<br />
<br />
Zoey elbowed her mate in the left underboob. &quot;Pssst, I think we&#39;re actually called hyenas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s, like, totes what I said,&quot; Ashlee whispered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got a plan to get my flab back,&quot; said Ellie. &quot;You&#39;ll have to chip in, I&#39;m afraid. It apparently costs money. Aside from that, I&#39;m lesbian as hell, I&#39;m dating Harper, I love lasagna, there&#39;s something I find soothing about the rain, I don&#39;t care for hip-hop, I love classic rock, hugs are the best, I hate the taste of herbs, I&#39;m kind of a furry myself (nothing like as much as Harper, though), and pandas are my favorite animal... though I guess I&#39;d better learn to love hyenas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now how about you two show the pack your werehyena forms?&quot; Selena suggested.<br />
<br />
Harper nodded and excitedly willed her shift to begin, morphing into a tall werehyena covered in pale brown fur with darker spots. Wiry muscle pulsed beneath hir lean body, and hir dick reached halfway down to hir knees. &quot;Well, here I am. Damn, my voice sounds deep in this form! It kind of sounds like I&#39;m voiced by Jennifer Hale now. Cool, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellie shifted next. Hir hyena form was coverd in dark golden fur, and it bulged with solid muscle. Trying to overlook hir uncuddly physique, Ellie payed attention to hir dick for the first time. Shi smiled; something about it just felt... right. Had shi been an enby all this time and just never reflected on gender? Did cock love just come with the transformation? It didn&#39;t matter; all that mattered was hir beautiful dick. It wasn&#39;t as long as Harper&#39;s but it was much thicker, everything Ellie could want in a dick. Shi reached down and fondled it, gasping as it grew hard in hir clawed fingers.<br />
<br />
Selena laughed. &quot;Plenty of time to play with your cock later, newbie! First, how about the pack introduce themselves to you and Harper one at a time? You first, Beck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beck strode up to the newbies and shifted into human form. Harper wondered what it was about humanity that made Beck look nakeder than they had as a werehyena. The lack of fur, perhaps?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, girls!&quot; Beck greeted, slapping both of the new recruits on their furry backs, as hard as it was to reach their backs in their human form. &quot;Name&#39;s Beck. Beck Hamilton. I&#39;m on the high school soccer team, and I&#39;m a proud non-binary! Good to finally have a dick, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ellie smiled. &quot;It is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beck gave Ellie a loving tug on the tail. &quot;Too bad about your belly, kid. Hope your plan works, whatever it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s a hint,&quot; said Ellie. &quot;It involves a certain Japanese contact sport.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Karate can make you fat?!&quot; gasped Ashlee.<br />
<br />
After Beck shifted back and rejoined the main crowd, Brianna took hir place and shifted into a normal (if buff) black girl with a poofy afro. &quot;Hi, girls. I&#39;m Brianna Dixon, Beck&#39;s mate. In the human world, you may know me as a straight-A student and budding animal rights activist, a cause my new life has only made me even more passionate about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s awesome,&quot; said Harper. &quot;Someone needs to save nature. Why not us, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianna nodded, shifted back into a werehyena, and returned to the crowd, waving. Taylor took hir place and shifted into a tanned human with dark blonde hair with a truly AMPLE carpet to match the drapes. &quot;Hi Harper, Ellie. I&#39;m Taylor Wagner, but you can call me Sister Nightswan. That was my craft name in my old Wiccan coven. A vampire found me taking part in an Ostara ritual not far from here with two of my friends. She decided that I was destined to become a werehyena, and my friends were destined to be a witch and a vampire. I&#39;m actually the pack&#39;s shaman now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool!&quot; Harper chirped. &quot;So, what does a pack&#39;s shaman do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You guess is good as mine,&quot; Taylor answered, rolling her eyes. &quot;Selena and I really need to find a teacher to get us caught up in werehyena culture.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No fear,&quot; called Selena. &quot;I wrote to one!&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor resumed hir hyena form and let Stella take hir place. Stella dispelled hir hyena form, returning to the (now noticeably more ripped) body of the bitch queen of Stokerville High that Ellie had always dreaded. &quot;Hi. Nice to meet you, Harper. I&#39;m Stella Bentley. I come from a rich family, but please don&#39;t envy me. It&#39;s stifling as fuck and I&#39;m planning to ditch them to live with the pack full time as soon as they&#39;ve claimed some territory and built a settlement there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella turned to Ellie. &quot;I really do owe you a massive apology, Ellie. I never should&#39;ve talked about your weight the way I did; I was a bitch. Shame you had to lose that tummy of yours. I know a thing or two about being denied the body you know in your heart was meant to be yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellie raised an eyebrow. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got a secret,&quot; said Stella. &quot;I&#39;m non-binary, both male and female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Ellie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; said Stella. &quot;My parents would hate the idea. They&#39;re so damn transphobic it&#39;s not even funny. I&#39;ve spent my whole life pretending to be their picture of a perfect Bentley daughter, but that&#39;s not me. See this long, golden hair? Well, I&#39;d love nothing more than to cut it short and dye it purple! But what I really wanted was a penis. My ideal body image was rocking massive boobs and a meaty trouser snake. I would&#39;ve gotten a packer, but Mom would&#39;ve flipped her shit. Dad would&#39;ve just gone into his &#39;does-not-compute&#39; mode. Good thing I found Selena and her pack. This is honestly the fucking happiest I&#39;ve ever been!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Congrats!&quot; said Harper. &quot;What are your pronouns?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In my werehyena form, shi/hir,&quot; answered Stella. &quot;In my human form... it&#39;s complicated. I&#39;m not out to many people, so you have to use she/her in public. In private, I&#39;m still trying stuff out. Maybe I&#39;ll be shi/hir around the clock. For now &#39;she&#39; and &#39;they&#39; are both good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you!&quot; said Ellie. &quot;Kinda reminds me of when I finally decided I didn&#39;t care what people thought of my weight and just let myself get big and beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you gonna get your belly back?&quot; asked Stella. &quot;You implied it had something to do with sumo wrestling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Ashlee. &quot;THAT Japanese contact sport.&quot; She giggled. &quot;Stupid me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgana said there&#39;s this kappa in Japan who runs a sumo school in Kyoto that admits herms, and he makes a magical chankonabe that can resist even a werebeast&#39;s metabolism. I&#39;m going to enter a sort of exchange student program that Morgana&#39;s setting up. So if you bump into any yokai at school, that&#39;s why. Only thing is, I&#39;ll need quite a bit of money to pay for it all. Neither Morgana nor the kappa work for free.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella smiled. &quot;Consider it done. Mom and Dad let me do what I fucking want with their money. Believe me, they won&#39;t ask any questions about what I spent it on. They&#39;ll just assume it was for a third car or my spring wardrobe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d do that for her?&quot; asked Harper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything to get Ellie the body she&#39;s most comfortable with,&quot; said Stella. &quot;Now I should probably let Ashlee and Zoey have the floor. They live for attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella shifted back into hir hyena form and let Ashlee and Zoey come barging in. They quickly shifted to their human form and began chattering. &quot;Hiiiiiiyeeeeeeeeee, gal pals! I&#39;m Zoey Guthrie (AKA zanyzoey69 from Instagram, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok), and this is my gorrrrrrgeous mate Ashlee Kline! You&#39;ve probably seen me all over the internet, so you know I&#39;m totally bubbly, fun, fashion-forward, a little naughty, and a bit ditzy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m, like, totes the ditziest, though!&quot; laughed Ashlee. &quot;So, Zoey and I are, like, Stella&#39;s best friends and we&#39;ve, y&#39;know, always followed her around and done what she asked, so it&#39;s kinda like we were always in a pack, even before Selena made us heinous Hermiones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hyena hermaphrodites!&quot; Stella yelled.<br />
<br />
Ashlee giggled. &quot;See how smart Stella is? She was totally our human alpha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet she&#39;ll be Selena&#39;s beta,&quot; said Zoey. &quot;Well, super-duper awesome to meet you two. You&#39;ll both subscribe to all my accounts, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harper and Ellie helplessly nodded as Ashlee and Zoey happily bounced away, their hyena forms returning. Tatiana then approached Harper and Ellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tatiana?!&quot; Ellie gasped. &quot;From Biology?! My lab partner?! What the hell are you doing here?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The normal news is I&#39;m not a werehyena,&quot; said Tatiana. &quot;The weird news is I&#39;m a vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For real?!&quot; Ellie thought about it a bit. &quot;That would explain your pallor and your hatred of sunny days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wanted the truth out there,&quot; said Tatiana. &quot;The von Karnstein family is actually an ancient vampire clan from Austria. We own this whole forest you&#39;re standing in. Vampires are usually pretty loaded. If Stella needs any help footing your bill, the von Karnsteins can always pitch in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Selena, &quot;now you two finally know your entire pack. Think of us as your family, because we are!&quot;</p>
