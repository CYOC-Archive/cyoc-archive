<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Little red riding wolf looked at her parents with her violet eyes at Fran's expressed <br />
annoyance. &quot;It's not going to be instantaneous Fran, they have to make sure not to leave <br />
any loose ends.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see alpha female.&quot; Fran nodded. While nothing in the transformation had specifically <br />
stated that she and Darla were to be together: the idea of being separated from her twin <br />
struck Fran with the morbidness as losing an arm. While they would be close by in two <br />
different cars, it still made Fran feel uncomfortable and the sooner it was over with the <br />
better for her.  One look at Darla told Fran she felt exactly the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;Loose ends!&quot; The twins echoed at each other in a realization. They looked at the Big Bad <br />
Wolf and asked, &quot;Master! Is there anything here that could encourage an investigation <br />
besides an empty house?&quot;  The idea of their Master being suddenly caught up in a police <br />
investigation was unthinkable! <br />
<br />
Jensen started slight at the twin's exclamation but thought it over,  &quot;Well... there was the <br />
tore off kitchen and bathroom doors...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll clean them up at once!&quot; The twin said quickly and without hesitation and Fran made <br />
a made dash for the kitchen and Fran the bathroom finding both in a very short search <br />
and began to clean up the debris with their bare hands, their thick callous protecting them <br />
from the sharp glass, throwing the broken wood and glass and hingers into a nearby <br />
garbage can, then dumped the pieces into the outside one moving like a ninja to deliver <br />
the load. <br />
<br />
&quot;When do they pick up the trash alpha female?&quot; Darla asked having returned from her <br />
stealth drop off of the remains of the kitchen and bathroom doors while Fran found some <br />
push pints and a couple blankets to hand them over the doorways as any family would <br />
have done if a particular set of doorways needing replacing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow morning.&quot; Kaylee asked, grateful for the convenient coincidence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; The twins said together. 'With the alpha female's parents making formal <br />
arrangements, it would be a while before anyone comes to the house and the evidence <br />
will be gone by then.'  The twins then began chatting among each other about any other <br />
telltale signs they noticed that would lead to the police investigating the family <br />
abandoning their house and everything in it. <br />
<br />
Fran leapt in front of Kaylee's father while Darla did the same with Kaylee's mother, &quot;Be <br />
sure to take with you any tax paperwork you have in the house and anything else that <br />
could lead to identity theft, if you were moving in a hurry you still wouldn't have <br />
abandoned those.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee's father silently hoping that they could have left some traces behind muttered, &quot;Oh <br />
shit.&quot; And as part of the Dare he had no choice but to do precisely as the big blond she <br />
wolf had said his wife doing the same. <br />
<br />
Kaylee's mother looked again and again at the she wolf that claimed to be their child, as <br />
she walked past Kaylee she managed to say, &quot;Kyle, don't let the curse win, you have to <br />
fight it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name's Kaylee now mom.&quot; The red wolf said putting her arms behind her head and <br />
walking backwards with her mother for a short bit, &quot;And there's nothing to fight. I LIKE <br />
being this way! This version of me is a major league upgrade!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Since the food was just going to spoil anyway, Kaylee opened the fridge and ate up some <br />
left over chicken, crunching the bones as if they were candy canes, she almost wished <br />
Master Jensen had left some of the raw steak for her, but that was what Master had wanted <br />
and thus it was perfectly fine. She tossed a few drum sticks to the twins who ate them up <br />
like they were ice cream bars with edible popsicle sticks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you alpha female.&quot; They replied taking a few sprays to clean up the smell of theirs <br />
and the Master's musk to keep the police report of the 'wilder and dangerous' from being <br />
dug up even it had been formally reported as nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen thought, his new philosophy of 'just take what I want' was turning out a lot more <br />
complex then he had thought. While the power of the game apparently made it so people <br />
accepted his existence and wouldn't call the police for public nudity or the zoo for a wild <br />
animal being on the loose, the police attempting to arrest Kaylee suggested he wouldn't be <br />
able to just march into a burger joint, down fifty hamburgers and leave without paying.  So <br />
much for that lifestyle.  While he wasn't sure yet what the pack could do with itself in the <br />
long term, Jensen knew it was best to get their power base established first and then begin <br />
to consider what to do with their future. One thing Jensen did like the idea of course was <br />
increasing the size of the pack. Either through of course fathering cubs or using the game <br />
to create new pack-mates.  Larger numbers would meant more to hide of course, but it <br />
also meant they could hide more effectively with their combined efforts. Jensen almost <br />
giggled at the cliche. <br />
<br />
Jensen wondered if he could ask some of his highschool friends for a sleep over, and use <br />
the game to transform them. However that would lead to parents asking a lot of questions <br />
and there was no question where police would start looking first. Jensen sighed, he didn't <br />
like having to leave his friends out of this, but until the pack was secure he was going to <br />
have to do precisely that. <br />
<br />
Kaylee had gone to her bedroom, looking at the things she'd leave behind in exchange for <br />
her glorious new future as alpha female and mother to the big bad wolf pack.  The posters <br />
of anime girls and robot models were shrugged off. She did however use a duffle bag and <br />
take her Gameboy and game cards. It wasn't like she'd ever be getting any use out of her <br />
favorite shirts anymore.  She also had her mother toss in a few things of value of her own, <br />
but was sure to do so in a way that made it clear it was just a family taking some things of <br />
value rather than a burglar (after all, burglars didn't close and re-lock the family cabinet). <br />
<br />
After putting the duffle bag by the door she came up behind Darla and Fran and put her <br />
arms on their shoulders, &quot;Hey girls!&quot; She greeted, &quot;Since we can't enjoy the Master while <br />
waiting for my parents to get their act together, how about we play some Wii.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wee?&quot; The twice echoed back at her. <br />
<br />
Kaylee groaned at their ignorance, &quot;Come on I'll show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Powering up the video game system, Kaylee introduced the twins to the game Smash <br />
Brothers, of course they would all chose the character named 'Wolf.' Kaylee trounced the <br />
two newbies without even trying, making sure to take the Wii's memory card with her <br />
when they ultimately left. <br />
<br />
Jensen noticed this with some surprise and delight, this proved their hands were still <br />
functional and practical and not just slice and dice machines. <br />
<br />
After a few more rounds of having their butts handed to them by Kaylee the twins put <br />
down their controllers. Kaylee ordered them to play some more but Jensen belayed that <br />
order and had them get back to work to which all three she-wolves said together, &quot;Yes <br />
Master Jensen.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen was decidedly enjoying the whole 'Master' thing, it reminded him of how Martha <br />
refused to call Jennifer 'Mistress' or 'Madam' and only refer to her as 'Miss,' well, Martha's <br />
tune would change son enough.  <br />
<br />
Seeing their alpha female pack a few choice items made the twins thinks of their personal <br />
things they had to leave at home. <br />
<br />
Fran knew her Chihuahua would be in perfectly good hands with Julie so that was no <br />
problem, not that it really mattered. Neither of them could really go back to their home or <br />
their apartment now without likely drawing attention and that wouldn't be very good for <br />
the Master's designs at all.  Fran fantasized about using the game on her wife and two <br />
daughters to bring them into the pack, she was sure she could figure out a way to do so, <br />
but her family vanishing might cause too much attention again and that was simply not <br />
good. Fran was disappointed, but not crushingly so,  oh she loved her family, and would <br />
love them even more as pack mates, but she loved her Master most of all and he came first <br />
before anything else. <br />
<br />
Fran and Darla then looked at each other as they realized some time bombs they had <br />
foolishly left behind. &quot;Master!&quot; They said together earnestly! <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jensen asked surprised by their tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;We could have trouble.&quot; The twin echoed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I left my motorcycle at the police station.&quot; Darla said. <br />
<br />
Fran continued, &quot;And I told the chief that I was quitting for family issues, but I told my <br />
family I had to leave for a special assignment in Iraq.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen groaned, was the complications brought on by Kaylee's impulsive recruiting oft he <br />
twins ever going to end? <br />
<br />
Fran said, &quot;The motorcycle might have trouble since we quite the police force and Darla <br />
would have little reason to leave it behind. And she'd be hard pressed to claim it as hers <br />
now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla continued, &quot;And if Fran's wife calls the police station and finds the inconsistency, she <br />
might dig deeper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen looked at Kaylee and growled lowly again. Kaylee didn't try to smile, only trying to <br />
look as small as possible before her Master. <br />
<br />
Jensen rubbed his temples and thought, how to fix their particular problem. <br />
<br />
Fran said, &quot;The good news is that my family 'knows' I'm 'leaving tomorrow Master. She'll <br />
likely stay up all night waiting for me and fall asleep and wake up the next morning. She <br />
won't make the call until then, and by then we should have my car disposed of right? <br />
There isn't an APB out for it so we can move about freely with it. And the military and FBI <br />
wouldn't give Julie any answers weather my story was true or false. So she'll have nothing <br />
but dead ends to follow. And I told her I was happy that they didn't want her or the kids to <br />
come along so the chief might be able to interpret that as the 'family business' if we're <br />
lucky Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen sighed, he was going to have to rely on Fran and Darla's police knowledge to make <br />
sure the car was never found in enough pieces to figure out how it belonged to, and like <br />
Fran said, people weren't on the look out for it and there was more than one Ford Bronco <br />
on the streets after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;And the motor cycle?&quot; Jensen asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;They'll of course call my apartment and maybe my cell phone when I don't come back for <br />
it.&quot; Darla said, &quot;But they'll never be looking for me at your estate master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen sighed. He just hoped his twins were right. <br />
<br />
&quot;There is one more thing.&quot; The twins echoed.<br />
<br />
Jensen groaned. <br />
<br />
&quot;The person who made the original call to the police that there loud and wild animals in <br />
the house.&quot; They spoke as one. &quot;His name was Mitch Hurteng. he lives right next door <br />
Master.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jensen asked, &quot;So he never saw us?&quot;<br />
<br />
The twins shook their heads, &quot;No. He only said he -heard-something-, he had no idea <br />
what.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen thought, until Kaylee's and his own parents were transformed, Fran was the only <br />
one of them who had the power of the game. And Jensen didn't know what complications <br />
could pop up and had hoped to keep Fran's turn in reserve in case things went to hooey <br />
fast.<br />
<br />
Jensen took out the phone book, there was the chance that Hurteng (who was regarded a <br />
little on the stuff and rigid side anyway by his neighbors) had caller ID, but if he did, <br />
hopefully Hurteng wouldn't realize it wasn't from the police. Though he need not have <br />
worried, Kaylee's family was very private about her phone number and had their number <br />
restricted. <br />
<br />
Jensen found Mitch Hurteng's number and handed the one to Fran who dialed up his <br />
number. She spoke in a calm, collected, professional voice using proper police verbal <br />
protocol when speaking to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Mitch Hurteng's voice answered, the rest of the wolfens doing their best to stay <br />
quiet, and the Dare kept Kaylee's parents from screaming out 'Help!' <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, this is the police, we'd like to follow you up on a report you made earlier today...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mitch had claimed he had not heard anything new, but did ask what the police had found <br />
out having seen their squad card drive to and from the house. Fran calmly informed him <br />
that he had heard two newly bought exotic dogs and the owners had been informed of the <br />
disturbance their pets had caused and would take proper steps in the future.   Kaylee all in <br />
all was very glad that her parents and Mr. Hurteng had that tall hedge fence between their <br />
two houses. <br />
<br />
Giving Hurteng a number to call if he heard or learned of anything else, (which was really <br />
Fran's phone number, though both twins knew they'd have to cancel their cellphone <br />
subscriptions in the next couple of days to slice off another means they could be tracked <br />
by), Fran bid him fair well and hung up.  <br />
<br />
Darla clapped, &quot;You were fantastic sister!&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran smiled back, &quot;I was fantastic wasn't I sister?&quot;  The twins hugged each other their <br />
movements like two sides of a mirror. <br />
<br />
&quot;You were able to help keep the pack secret without having to waste your turn at the <br />
game!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sister! We were able to hold onto my turn, as master said it's a singular use unless <br />
the curse is used on us again, so we must avoid using it when we don't have to.&quot;  Hearing <br />
this, for the first time ever, Jensen was actually -glade- Kaylee had recruited the twins. <br />
<br />
 They turned towards Jensen, &quot;Isn't that right master?&quot; They asked happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen marched over to Kaylee and began to gently stroke her fur, letting her know that all <br />
was forgiven. Kaylee drank in the feeling of her master and lord's paws upon her body, the <br />
flow of his pads against her fur a sweet sensation unto itself. <br />
<br />
Now Jensen just hoped any other neighbors near Kyle's house didn't bring them bad luck, <br />
wait... <br />
<br />
'How did I know where Kyle's house was?' Jensen wondered. High school senior Jennifer <br />
Smith hadn't had a clue who freshman Kyle Perkins was, only that he had said that Jennifer <br />
and her friends had pranked him last week: he hadn't been anything special when it <br />
happened, just another guy with no looks, no grace who existed only to be toyed with and <br />
taunted by girls of Jennifer's stock. <br />
<br />
'Well, the Big Bad Wolf always knows where their victim lives, the three little pigs, Red <br />
Riding Hood's grandmother... I just hope this doesn't mean a random lumberjack is going <br />
to show up and vivisect me or I'm going to get cooked alive after I try to break into <br />
someone's brick house by coming in through the chimney.' Jensen actually shuddered at <br />
the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay Master Jensen?&quot; Kaylee asked concerned when he had stopped petting her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just a little worried that now that the Big Bad Wolf that I'm gonna end up on the <br />
business end of a woodcutter's axe.&quot; Jensen confessed to his mate. <br />
<br />
Kaylee put her arms around his and leaned a little closer to him, &quot;Don't worry Master, my <br />
Transform was that you only became the next fictional character you read, not that you'd <br />
be forced to act out what happens to them at the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Thank you Kaylee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee smiled with her muzzle saying, &quot;I live only for you Master.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We're done.&quot; Said Kaylee's parents in unison. <br />
<br />
&quot;Drive the cars into the garbage so we don't have to go outside to be seen.&quot; Jensen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Kaylee said looking as sheepish as a wolf could rubbing the back on her head, <br />
&quot;Our garbage is kinda full of junk spanning back three generations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen sighed, 'Of course.' Jensen gave the couple the instructions for bringing themselves <br />
and the wolves to the estate, who nodded robotically thought Kaylee's father said in a low <br />
voice (as so only the wolves could hear it and so as not to get anyone else's attention at <br />
all), &quot;Bastard, you killed my son.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He killed me first.&quot; Jensen said darkly. <br />
<br />
Kaylee's mother made a silent prayer as they marched to the cars, Fran telling them how <br />
the keys were in the pile of ripped genes in the back seat. <br />
<br />
Fran and Darla looked at each other and had a close hug, memorizing the feel of each <br />
other. True it was just for a little while, but they also hoped nothing went wrong that could <br />
keep their twin away from them. <br />
<br />
Kaylee and Jensen also hugged. &quot;Now remember Kaylee, Fran still has the game. We ended <br />
up not having to waste it on the man next door, but DON'T do anything reckless! Only use <br />
the game along the way if we're in a situation we'll have to fight our way out of or will be <br />
exposed otherwise. THINK before you act.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master Jensen.&quot; Kaylee bowed. <br />
<br />
With that, the wolfens piled into the waiting cars, Darla and Jensen in Fran's Bronco piled <br />
in with Kaylee's father, who said nothing but kept his eyes on the road. <br />
<br />
Kaylee and Fran climbed into the Buick where Kaylee's mother awaited, &quot;Well mom! Let's <br />
get going&quot; Kaylee said excited.  Kaylee laid down since she was too tall for the car roof like <br />
the others using the seat belt as best she could (as with the rest of the wolfen), she didn't <br />
want the car stopped for them not using their seat belts.  She also remembered at the lady <br />
minute to use the little wolf lady's room. <br />
<br />
The two cars drove out of the driveway, Kaylee remembering to lock the front door at the <br />
very last minute, she gave the house she'd likely never see again one last look as the <br />
family and pack drove away, she had grown up in that house, as had her parents and <br />
grandparents. However, her master's family home would be much more practical for the <br />
pack to live in as it's size increased and she would never ask her master to short change <br />
his plans for her connivence. <br />
<br />
As the two cars drove across town, people at stop lights did give the wolfens looks, but <br />
no more than you'd give the bald man with tattoos on his head in the car next to you. <br />
Though some looks did linger in appearance at the she wolf's tail covered butts, no one <br />
was really overwhelmingly alarmed or freaked out as you would seeing a nudist riding <br />
along. <br />
<br />
Jensen gave Kaylee's father precise instructions to Jennifer's home, with the Buick <br />
following dutifully behind. Kaylee prattled on to her mother, wondering if her mom would <br />
become wolf cub prodigy like Jensen's parent would be soon enough or made into a fellow <br />
she-wolf to add to the master's females. Kaylee told her mother how she was okay really <br />
with either since both had perks. Her mother gripped the steering wheel ever so tightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Fran said to the woman, &quot;It'll all be for the best you'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman didn't respond to the blond blue eyed she-wolf beast riding along with her. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're likely thinking of some way to cause trouble once you've fulfilled your Dare by <br />
changed the masters parents,  but I was a cop until this morning, so I know about <br />
suspects looking for any opportunity they can spot to get away so sorry, my sister and I <br />
will be watching you very carefully. And be right there when the Dare is done.&quot; Said both <br />
twins to their respective driver a few seconds apart. <br />
<br />
Both twins glanced at each other through the windshield and back windows of the cars <br />
like any sisters would. Jensen would be glade when the ride was over, this car was just way <br />
too small for his taste. <br />
<br />
It seemed that bad luck was taking an afternoon break as they two cars drove through the <br />
town without running into any meaningful trouble besides the tradition short traffic clog. <br />
While it was like an execution march, the couple was beginning to hope for an end to the <br />
trip too  as the lingering smell of the wolves slowly filled this nostrils. <br />
<br />
Too long and too short a time later, the cars parked perfectly out of view and not having <br />
been trailed or followed, the wolfens literally climbed out, as the parents reluctantly did <br />
the same the Dare not allowing them to simply stay inside the vehicles nor did The Dare <br />
permit them to run away. <br />
<br />
Darla and Fran instantly shared a short hug as did Jensen and Kaylee. Jensen then hugged <br />
the twins who instantly and eagerly returned his embrace. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome home ladies.&quot; Jensen said with a grin. <br />
<br />
All three lady wolfens loved the look of their new home and the massive spaces of plant <br />
life behind it.</p>
