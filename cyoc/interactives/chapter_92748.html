<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your father had been a human. The man himself was fairly average for someone who was nearby elves. He was researching possible uses for magic for species who could not use magic and had been doing good, but he was by no means famous or at all interested in raising a kid. He was just smitten by the elf and after the night wrote about his experience with elf pheromones. He left soon afterwards to show his findings, but your mother didn&#39;t really mind the father not being present and having no recollection of the night of passion she didn&#39;t even know your father was human. What clued her in was when you were developing quickly for an elf and was birthed as a happy elf girl. During your baby and toddler hood you were very active and giggled and cried a lot for an elf. When you turned 10 and were developed enough to walk long distances by yourself your mom brought you to the village where most of the elves had flocked to you to see one of the first new elves to have been born in a century. A little confused you asked your mother why everyone was so friendly.<br />
Sara said &quot;It is because we are an old race, we do not have children very often so everyone gets excited when one of our own is born. I feel truly lucky that you were my child.&quot; Sara held out the door to a inn/restaurant and you went in and saw a bunch of people talking and eating and a few were playing some instruments.<br />
looking around you didn&#39;t notice a human man beckoning towards your mother who then yelled &quot;Oy sara! come over here and let me treat you and your little girl to some food!&quot;<br />
Wondering who the silly man was you asked your mother &quot;Who is that man.&quot;<br />
Sara sighed and started walking towards him a little then said &quot;That man&#39;s name is Frederic Booksmith, He wants to study magic for his species since they cannot use magic themselves. He has been coming here for a long time and we&#39;re generally on good terms. He has no will to do harm to us since he fell in love with this forest since he was a child. Come, it&#39;ll be good to get to know one of another species.&quot; <br />
Sara pulled a chair out for you and you climbed in happy as Frederic ordered you guys some food. <br />
Frederic asked &quot;So little miss, mind if I asked your name?&quot;<br />
You responded cheerfully &quot;Young one!&quot;<br />
Frederic gave a curious look to your mother as she said &quot;We are not in the habit of naming our young, our names merely come to us when we learn our magic. It&#39;s a whisper the world tells us, Mine being Sara a lesser form of the world Serra.&quot;<br />
Frederic sighed and said &quot;Well I need something to call you little one, How about I call you Sar then? A little Sara.&quot; <br />
A bit annoyed your mother said &quot;That is an insult to our kind...&quot;<br />
not really minding you said &quot;I dont mind if he calls me Sar, it just helps him communicate doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
A bit exacerbated as the food came in Sara said &quot;You&#39;ve got empathy at least, fine be called what you wish... Speaking of young didn&#39;t you have a child recently?&quot; <br />
Frederic laughed and said &quot;Come on you know my kid was born 7 years ago and he&#39;s more developed than Sar here.&quot; <br />
They continued chatting as you ate some of the sausages that Frederic had been giving you. After a bit of bickering and conversations between Frederic and your mother the two of you had bought some supplies at town and headed back home. <br />
<br />
three years latter you had started developing a lot faster and soon when your mother wasn&#39;t looking you often was climbing out and around the trees with your body that had been about as developed as a 9 year old. During one of these expeditions nearly ended badly as your mother had found your jumping around the tree tops again and ordered for you to come down, but you were just about to jump and was surprised to see her. This ended up in you losing your footing and falling from what basically was a redwood. Concerned your mother started preparing a spell to save you, but something inside you just awoke and you spread your arms and you descended slower. When you reached the floor you closed your eyes as it felt like something was drawing you to sleep. A voice whispered into your ears &quot;You are not just your mother&#39;s young, you are your father&#39;s young as well and he knows you by your name.&quot; When you woke up your mother asked you a bunch of questions, but one of the things you  felt like talking about was what your name was apparently. Your mother was not sure who was your father, but assumed it wasn&#39;t anyone in town or they would&#39;ve said something. At the very least you learned a bit about your special magic being special transformation magic. What you had performed turned your arms into wings which slowed your decent. It took you awhile but you learned a few other tricks like turning your arms and legs into those of a doe to run quicker or making your eyes that of a hawk. In secret because you suspected that your father may have been human you developed a way to make your body more similar to a human body. When you used that spell you felt a bit different since your chest had started poking out a little along with changes to your private regions and a height increase. You also felt a little off with your ears not being so pointy. <br />
<br />
At sixteen your elf body just started puberty as a 12 year old and after having shown promise with your magic for your age and having annoyed your mother enough she had asked people in town and Frederic had agreed to let you live in with him and his family for a little time. You were excited for a few reasons. For one you thought it would make it easier to find your father and second you were always interested in how big cities like the one Frederic lived in were like. Having so many people in one place sounded amazing to you since your town only held at most a few hundred people at a time, and most of the population lived far apart from one another. When the time came Frederic opened the door to his car to let you in, and getting in you looking at the car in interest. When the car started the engine roared to life in your ears and as he started driving things got really bumpy making you cling to whatever you could.<br />
Frederic chuckled a little and said &quot;Sar relax, the road&#39;s just a little bumpy. We&#39;ll be in the city fairly quickly I&#39;ll even show you the place where I work.&quot; It was still a long ride for you as it took awhile for you to get used to all the vibrations. It took a day and when you finally arrived to the city the sun was just starting to shine and the two of you had just got to the frederic&#39;s apartment/house. You found that...</p>
