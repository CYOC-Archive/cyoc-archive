<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie gazed around her room double checking to make sure she hadn’t forgotten anything. Katie and Kellie were heading back to college today after another fun summer with their friends. Kellie giggled as she thought of everything that had occurred.<br />
<br />
Lisa and Jason had finally tied the knot. The wedding had been beautiful as Kellie, Katie and Kumiko had been part of the wedding party. Kellie even thought the bridesmaids dresses they had worn had beeen beautiful. Following the wedding Jason and Lisa had gone on their honeymoon to Bermuda for two weeks, it was during this time that Katie and Kellie finally had shown Gloria the ring of Age. Gloria had been stunned at first but eventually accepted the reality that the girls possessed magic.<br />
<br />
Gloria joining the ranks of the informed wasn’t the only magical thing that happened. The girls finally met the creator of the ring Merlin. The elderly wizard had been expecting the girls arrival and had been viewing their adventures with interest. The wizard was so happy to finally have met them that he rewarded the girls with new items of their own. Now each of them had magical items making the ring seem obsolete by comparison.<br />
<br />
As Kellie now fingered the magical necklace around her neck she heard a sound coming from her window. Turning she smiled as Katie hauled herself in through her window. “Seriously,” Kellie giggled. “Aren’t you a little old to be doing that still.”<br />
<br />
Katie fell onto the floor huffing and puffing as she looked up at her girlfriend. “Ugh,” she whined. “You know it wasn’t that hard getting in here when I was a kid.” Kellie giggled as she looked down at her girlfriend. “Well you weren’t sporting a pair of c sized funbags back then Kat.”<br />
<br />
Katie smirked as she hefted her breasts up, much to her girlfriends enjoyment. “So you ready to go,” Katie said. “Ashley and Claudia should be here soon and you know how impatient they both are.”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded as she closed the last of her suitcases. “Yeah all set,” she said. “I should go see the folks though first. You know how emotional they get whenever I leave for college.” Katie smirked as she thought of how Lee and Maggie always got teary whenever Kellie left for school. It didn’t matter that they would be back for Thanksgiving or that after college the girls would be moving into Katie’s childhood home.<br />
<br />
One of the many surprises Katie had learned, aside from the fact she and her friends were magical conduits, was that Katie’s mom had willed her the house she lived in. After graduating from high school Lisa presented Katie her moms last will and testament. Katie’s mother left her the home, meaning she could do with it as she pleased. That had been one of the best summers of her life. Katie and her friends had so much fun with the ring and had ended it but attending the marriage of Cole and Kumiko. One year later the girls were overjoyed when Kumiko and Cole welcomed their first born child, a boy they named Tom in honor of his grandfather.<br />
<br />
As Katie and Kellie now made their way downstairs they could see Lee and Maggie at the bottom of the stairs. The two were teary as usual as their only daughter made her way downstairs. “Oh sweetly,” Maggie sighed. “Have a good year. Make sure you call us at least once a week.” Kellie smirked as she hugged her mom. “Make sure my little girl studies hard,” Lee said to Katie wiping an eye. “If she smiled going to go to law school she’s going to need high grades.” Katie smiled as she hugged them both. She was at this point part of the family.<br />
<br />
As the two exited Kellies home they could see Claudia and Ashley pull up in Claudia’s SUV. Claudia smiled from the drivers seat as Ashley jumped out the back, as always sporting a T-shirt emblazoned with her sorority on it. Katie couldn’t help but smile looking at these two. <br />
<br />
Claudia and Mika were still an item, however while Claudia ended up going to state with her, Kellie and Ashley, Mika had gotten a scholarship to the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. The opportunity was too good to pass up meaning that the two now went to separate schools. Despite the distance they made their relationship work, often chatting late into the evening and seeing each other during breaks. Ashley and Jennifer were also a surprise. Despite not being on the best of terms when high school began the girls were now very close. Katie found it fascinating that the two frenemies were now trusted as much as Mika, Claudia, Sammy and Mary Elise.<br />
<br />
While Ashley followed the girls to state, Jennifer surprised everyone by following Shiro to Dartmouth. No one expected Jennifer to be able to pull it off yet she had accomplished it. The girls threw her a party after her acceptance (which hadn’t led to some fun with the ring). Now she attended the school along with Mary Elise and Sebastian.<br />
<br />
As for Samantha and Mike the two lovers ended up going to USC together. Despite Sammy still being a clutz she was considered one of the best volleyball players in the country. Mike also attended there as well and was being scouted by professional baseball teams for his pitching. The couple though never let their success go to their heads though, remaining humble and incredibly likable. Lisa especially loved talking with Samantha as the two compared notes on the sport.<br />
<br />
“Hey girls you ready,” Ashley called as she hugged them both. Katie and Kellie nodded. “Yeah ready to go just have one thing left to do.” They said looking over at Jason’s and Lisa’s home. “Okay,” Ashley said. “Just make it quick though. I need to get back to school as quick as I can. They have me helping out with rush week this year, not trying to screw that up.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie told them they wouldn’t be long as they now walked across the street and entered the Turners home. “Are you sure about this,” Kellie asked as she looked at Katie. “I mean it’s a lot of responsibility plus I mean you’ve had the ring for so long.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded looking at her girlfriend. “Theirs no one else I could think of,” She’s shrugged. “Besides you heard what Merlin said with the new magic items we have we won’t need the ring anymore. Besides Gloria is like the kid sister we always wanted, we both trust her.”<br />
<br />
“True,” Kellie answered. “Although I still think I’m her favorite.”<br />
<br />
As Katie Andy Kellie went upstairs they walked towards Gloria’s room. Peaking inside the girls could see the 14 year old girl lazily staring out her window lost in thought. “Hey kiddo,” Katie said. Turning the girl smiled rushing to give Katie and Kellie a hug. “Katie, Kellie,” she gushed brushing her long blond hair out of her eyes. “Are you hear to say goodbye? Was hoping to see you two before you left.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie smiled as they looked at the beautiful girl in front of them. “Yeah our ride is here,” Kellie said. “But wanted to see you before we left. Wanted to know if you were excited about starting high school in a couple of weeks.”<br />
<br />
Gloria shrugged sadly as she turned towards the window again. “I guess,” She mumbled. “I mean I have to take a physical with Dr. Harris before hand but...I don’t know...I’m nervous. What if no one likes me?”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie now hugged the girl tightly in an attempt to comfort her. “Your going to do great,” they said softly. “You already know Mary’s sister Megan and Lisa will be hear to help you too. Heck you could even talk with Dr. Harris. Claudia’s sister has always given good advise, plus we trust her.”<br />
<br />
Gloria shrugged sadly looking at her older sister and her girlfriend. “Yeah true,” She’s mumbled. “But there’s no way I can live up to what you two did. I mean you two were prom king and queen.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie smiled as they remembered the shock of the class naming the two of them prom king and queen. Everyone was so excited about the event that even Ashley and Clauida applauded, even though they were secretly ticked they didn’t win. “Yeah that was a shocker,” Katie smirked. Kellie nodded before answering. “I’ll say I’m pretty sure Ash and Claud are still mad they lost.”<br />
<br />
The three girl she now giggled before looking at each other. “Well Gloria I know high school can be scary bit your going to do great,” Kellie said. “You’ve got three great friends in Jackie, Felicia and Diane and we’re  only a phone call away if you need to talk. But there’s something else we want to give you. Something that helped us through tour high school.”<br />
<br />
Gloria looked confused as Katie now took the ring off her finger and placed it in Glorias hands. “You already know what this is,” She’s said sweetly. “You’ve seen how powerful it is but if you use It for good, good things happen. We couldn’t think of a better person to give it too.”<br />
<br />
Gloria looked shocked as she stared at the ring in her hand. “Thank you,” She’s whispered as she hugged Katie and Kellie. <br />
<br />
“Welcome Gloria,” Kellie said warmly hugging the young girl tightly. “Just remember the three rules, don’t use it on friends without permission, don’t use it own your parents well too much and if things get to crazy you can always put everything back to normal.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded solemnly as she looked at the two girls. “Oh and don’t worry about it affecting us,” Katie added holding her pendant up. “These necklaces will allow us to help you if things get to crazy.”<br />
<br />
The three girls walked downstairs now where Ashley and Claudia now waited in the car. “Hurry up you two,” Ashley called. “I told the girls I would set up the house and I still have to help you three move into your apartment off campus.”<br />
<br />
Katie and kellie now has hugged the girl they considered their little sister goodbye as they hopped into the car. Gloria smiled widely as she waved her sisters off to college, fingering the magic ring and wondering what the future held</p>
