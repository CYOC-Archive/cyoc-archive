<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diego rolled over in his bed, thankful that with football out of the way, he didn&#39;t have to get up at the crack of dawn to do drills any more. The veritable fireplug of a high school senior sat up and felt the sheer immensity of his form, and a gentle smirk formed on its own on his face. Yeah, without football, there was one thing he could focus on -- his insane muscles.<br />
<br />
The contagion had mostly run its course in the hulking young man, now almost 260 pounds of freaky mass on a short 5&#39;4&quot; frame. He looked at himself in the mirror and grinned, a fire lighting in his belly as he saw the beast of a boy staring back at him, 18 years old and already a monster in every way. He rolled his shoulders and stared at himself, loving how he couldn&#39;t even make out the ends of his delts in the mirror. He tensed his chest, the stubbled mounds of tanned flesh pulsing with mass -- he&#39;d tried to shave them, really wanting that definition to pop, but only ended up being able to shave the sides of his chest, his freaky musculature preventing him from getting everything. Not like it mattered, within a week most of the hair was back.<br />
<br />
And he could see why. Glancing down, he saw that the view of his blown out abs, 8 slabs of meat that you could lose a pencil in between, was blocked by the main perpetrator of all his hormonal woes. His muscles weren&#39;t the only thing that looked like a fireplug. The monstrous teen tilted his head back, his neck colliding with traps that almost touched his ears, as he swung one huge, meat-filled arm in front to grasp at a wine-bottle thick shaft that grew out of his crotch all the way to mash its apple-sized head into the cliff of the bottom of his pecs. The hulking young stud brought his free arm up, the veins on his bicep dancing as he struggled to bring it up due to all that meat getting in the way. His giant cockhead gushed a waterfall of cream into the canyon between his pectorals from the sight of all that muscle. His balls jostled as he widened his stance so he could really swing his hips into his hand, the twin orbs bloated with so much semen, producing so much testosterone a drug kit would light itself on fire in his mere vicinity.<br />
<br />
He leaned over and licked his bicep, his tongue dragging over the heavy muscle. He would have been too big to reach over, but with how freakishly developed he was, his bis were just so huge he barely had to move over to do it. He began to thrust into his hips, really getting into it until he heard footsteps outside his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mijo, you have that doctor&#39;s appointment,&quot; his mother called to him, knocking on his door. He was glad that she wouldn&#39;t enter his room, after he had started really beefing up, she could barely stand to look at him. He knew she worried about him, she&#39;d sometimes wail as she prayed over her bed at night for her little boy to be alright. Diego didn&#39;t know what she was getting so worked up about. He loved that he was this big. And really, he thought he could use a little more... actually, make that a LOT more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, mom,&quot; he grunted back. He let go of his pendulous cock, breathing heavily as he felt the sheer weight of his package dangling from his pelvis sway. Putting clothes on was an ordeal, enough of one to distract him from his prodigious endowment for it to at least soften into a semi-chub. His 3XL shirt strained over his upper body, yet hung halfway down to his thighs due to being made for a man at least a foot taller than he was. It served to at least hide that insane bulge of his, because his tortured shorts would never be able to hide his massive cock and balls.<br />
<br />
At the doctor&#39;s office, he could feel the eyes on him, the unease in the receptionist&#39;s eyes was palpable. As he was shown to a room, he was told that the specialist, an andrologist, would be with him shortly. Well, shortly couldn&#39;t come fast enough. Ten minutes turned to fifteen, and then almost 20; and Diego was getting a little bored. And more than a little horny.<br />
<br />
See, being endowed with genitalia that could spurt a single ribbon of pre-seed three times of what a normal man could in an entire -night- of orgiastic sex, had its downsides. Sort of, if you considered being so porned up that you had to jerk off at least 10 times a day, else it would come out on its own anyways. And with his mom interrupting his little session earlier. Well, he REALLY needed release now. So, with the doctor taking so long, he decided he could make it a quick one.<br />
<br />
Diego loved the way his mounds of muscle collided with each other as he stroked one out, feeling the slabs of beef bouncing with each thrust of his hips. Wet schlorps of pre-seed dribbled out of his cockhead, splattering into the underside of his pectorals and cooling down as it streamed down his cobblestone abs, under his balls and finally drooling down the doctor&#39;s bench and pooling onto the cold floor below. He loved the way his balls filled out the basket of his shorts... and he would love if they were snugger in there, if his giant&#39;s cock was just a little thicker in his hands, if his muscles were even more impossibly thick.<br />
<br />
He roared in triumph as he came, sending a heavy stream of seed... right into the face of the doctor that was coming into the room...<br />
<br />
---<br />
Diego apologized profusely to Dr. Andrews. The older man was a giant in his own respect, 6&#39;4&quot;, a full foot taller than Diego, and while not thin, age had taken what strength he had. Perhaps in his own day, he was like Diego, strong and tightly muscled, but never one of the &#39;big&#39; guys, other than heightwise. As the teen titan helped clean up the older man, he could swear he saw a blush creep up on his weathered face as the young stud wiped off a stray strand of cum on his salt-and-pepper stubble. As they proceeded through the check up, Diego chuckled internally to himself when he&#39;d subtly flex his huge body and the seasoned doctor would hold his breath for just a second having never seen quite a specimen of overwhelming masculinity like Diego was. The doctor&#39;s hands would linger on the hairy mounds of meat and Diego would shake him out of his stupor with a big flex. Dr. Andrew&#39;s hands would recoil, but they&#39;d return to feel Diego&#39;s mass soon enough.<br />
<br />
Even better was the reaction he got from the doctor when he answered his questions. Truthfully, too.<br />
&#39;Are you sexual active?&#39; &#39;Not with anyone, no one fits.&#39;<br />
&#39;How many ti-&#39; &#39;Ten, at least.&#39;<br />
<br />
Diego told him how it all started for him; how he used to be so much smaller, but this year, he just blew up during football. The doctor was a little concerned, concerned enough to take notes when he wasn&#39;t too busy ogling the young, shortstacked behemoth in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you say your other teammates have experienced something similar?&quot; Dr. Andrews asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Similar? No one even comes close to similar to this freaky mass, doc,&quot; Diego chuckled, bringing up an arm for the doctor to see, causing the older man to shoot his clipboard down to hide the obvious. &quot;But yeah, we all just sort of got bigger this year,&quot; he adds with a shrug.<br />
<br />
The doctor nodded and concluded that it could possibly be some sort of pathogen. &quot;I&#39;d ask for a sample... but I think you&#39;ve already given me enough to work with,&quot; Dr. Andrews said, looking around at the cum-soaked mess his office had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could give you a fresh sample,&quot; Diego offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, no!&quot; Dr. Andrews laughed nervously. He obviously wanted to see that, but Diego obliged.<br />
<br />
The young stud was given instructions to not exacerbate his situation: keep exercise to a minimum, eat less in hopes of not triggering more growth, and to avoid sexual or intimate contact with other people to mitigate the chances of anything spreading just in case it was contagious.<br />
<br />
As Dr. Andrews watched the young stud walk out of his office, he tugged at the collar of his lab coat, not realizing just how contagious the growth really was...<br />
<br />
---<br />
Did Diego consider the doc&#39;s warning? Perhaps. For a good 5 minutes. But the call of the gym was too strong. He couldn&#39;t just ignore his muscles like that! And over the next month he worked out tireless, ate enough to feed several families all in an effort to grow. And grow he did. Sure, he was still a short 5&#39;4&quot;, but he had managed to put on another inch on all his measurements. Emphasis on all of them. And while an impressive feat, Diego was kind of disappointed that he wasn&#39;t blowing up with mass like he used to. His perception of size had become completely distorted, not realizing that an extra 15 pounds of mass on his frame took him up to almost 275 pounds of freaked up mass. But, if there was one warning the hulking teen heeded, was that he didn&#39;t have sex with any one. He heard that one of his teammates banged his girlfriend, and now she&#39;s benching his deadlift for reps. And Diego could not have that.<br />
<br />
No way was he going to let anyone comes close to his freaky size development. And one more person getting big was one too many, any one of them might be the one that would make him look puny!<br />
<br />
Of course, the recent growth didn&#39;t go unnoticed by his mother and she rescheduled him to see the doctor again. Rolling his eyes, he knew he&#39;d never hear the end of it until he went.<br />
<br />
And so here he was, back in the doctor&#39;s office. Only this time, he could feel the floor shake a little as the doctor neared the closed door of the office...</p>
