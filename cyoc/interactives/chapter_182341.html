<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">touching the sweaty shirt you wear as It aroused you, you shortly unbutton your pants to feel around your new pussy. Realizing on what you were doing as you snapped back to your senses, while groping your sleek fur breast that you quickly buttoned your pants back up for you then were leave the changing room. As you left though, the skunk man that lead you here to the costume shop wasn’t there anymore for You then had to think to yourself of all the things you can do now. one thing came to mind however that after giving the costume shop a fair once over, confirming the skunk man was gone and nowhere near to be found is when you decided to grab out your phone and immediately try to call the one person of your life. your girlfriend!<br />
<br />
Desperately giving her a call that you stopped yourself by immediately hanging it up for she doesn&#39;t know what happened to you as she doesn&#39;t know about you sneaking into the zoo. If you called her now to hear another female’s voice on the line that she&#39;ll assume you&#39;re checking on her and dump you for it. With a quick pace as you rushed over to the parking lot, to where you parked earlier with your car while hurrying out of the zoo that you were faster than usual for it was thanks to the transformation.<br />
<br />
Entering through your car door that you were fumbling around in your pockets for your car keys as it took awhile to find, but you soon found it. Starting the car up, you drove away from the zoo and road up towards your girlfriend’s place. Once there, making little noise as possible that you tiptoe up to her door for you felt bad by sneaking to her up like this. Still though, where else will you go?<br />
<br />
Shooting her a quick text by telling her that it was urgent and to have her open up her door, it takes her awhile as she fumbles a little bit by what you chould hear. Soon after a few minutes, you hear a click from the door as you see your sleepy-eyed girlfriend in front of you while wearing a pink night gown robe. You waited impatiently there for her to respond as it took her a minute to actually say anything, but what came next was shocking to say the least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, excuse me miss. Sorry if it&#39;s out, but May I help you with anything...&quot; as expected to see her reaction for she doesn&#39;t recognize you, but it did hurt by knowing this that you were sure of one thing. This was going to be a strange night to remember, not to mention awkward.<br />
<br />
Thinking of an excuse to your  predicament, you desided to give to her straight. &quot;Look, babe... I know that this may sound weird to you, but it&#39;s me! I know you probably won&#39;t believe what a word I say, but I went to the zoo and got transformed into this weird girl like jaguar thing you see before you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Starting at you like you were a crazy woman, yet squinting that she was obviously not in the mood to deal with you like this. She was to tired while having trouble processing all of this here that was happening, so she did what most people would do when they&#39;re feeling distressed and invite them in as she starts to walk away while calling you to come inside. Not sure if she was being kind to you at this time of hour, or she felt petty by your story as you walked in the door for you then closed it behind you while locking the door that whithout her even saying where it was is when you then went over to the closest for a blanket to use.<br />
<br />
She was getting weirded out by this as she about to tell you where the item was, yet to tired about it still that this is what she had to say next. &quot;I don&#39;t know how you know as to where the blanket was before I said anything, but you&#39;re not sleeping in bed with me for that&#39;s my boyfriend’s sleeps. Still, whoever you are that you can have the couch for tonight. We&#39;ll talk about this more in the morning when I&#39;m more awake. Besides, you&#39;re a stinky kitty. Good night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Saying her good night to you as she still didn&#39;t recognized you, she went off to bed. With that, you take a quick whiff of yourself and realize one thing for she was right about you being called a stinky kitty, even for a jungle cat you are. There’s no way you can wash this stuff off in the washer now, not without waking her up again.<br />
<br />
So, for the first time since your transformation that you peel off your shirt and jeans as it left you in just your bra and panties. Defeated by your unwelcoming timing as you felt like someone was watching you that you looked over your shoulder, but just shrug it off while grabbing the blanket from the downstairs closet. Unaware that someone was, but out the window that you lay the blanket out across the couch and got into a comfortable position as you slowly drifting off to sleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning as you wake up by slowly opening your eyes, but you were somehow greeted by an extra bit of weight that laid on top of you. Looking to see that you realized it was your girlfriend who was laying on top of you as her head rested and nuzzled over your breasts, her arms wrapped tightly around your waist, she even had the nerve to wrapped a leg around yours. Still wear bra and panties as you both laid there on the couch that should you wake her up and try again, or simply just like her sleep?</p>
