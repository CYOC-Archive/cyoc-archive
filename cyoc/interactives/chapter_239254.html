<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dwayne thought he knew his wife rather well. He and Katherine have been married for over 20 years. Admittedly, their romance hasn&#39;t been as passionate as it had been. While the spark wasn&#39;t gone, it was more like a low warmth. A lot of it Dwayne attributed to the circumstances of Katherine&#39;s pregnancy with Matt. The couple had been planning on multiple children, but Matt had been a difficult pregnancy. Katherine hadn&#39;t been as physically prepared for motherhood as she thought and Matt had ended up being a C-section. The painful experience, the tortuous months before it, and the doctors noting that Katherine had been significantly weakened by the ordeal had put off them trying to have any more kids. Dwayne even had a vasectomy to insure he didn&#39;t accidentally get Katherine pregnant again.<br />
<br />
Dwayne had been out of town on business when he got the message from Katherine. She told him to meet her at the most luxurious hotels in their part of Alaska. Dwayne wondered what Katherine was planning, but she only told him it was a very expensive Christmas present. This wasn&#39;t like her to be teasing like this, especially with something that could be expensive. He was also concerned about how expensive it was when he was told to go up to the luxury suite.<br />
<br />
Part of Dwayne hoped for something romantic and he certainly saw plenty of it. From the seductive winter music playing to the champagne chilling in an ice tub with wineglasses ready. What he didn&#39;t expect was the anthro she-wolf lying on the bed. She was incredibly beautiful and sexy, having the body of a busy amazon. Which she was displaying fully by posing seductively on the bed with only a few ribbons strategically and suggestively placed to keep her modesty. And yet, Dwayne somehow knew she was Katherine, partly because of her dark brown hair having blonde highlights, something he had only seen when Katherine was younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kat... what...?&quot; he asked, thoroughly bamboozled at the setup.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all part of Animalia&#39;s edicts.&quot; said Katherine, seductively, as she discarded her ribbon coverings and went over to him. &quot;So, just sit back... relax... and enjoy the Christmas spirit.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Uh...” Dwayne started before Katherine pushed his head to her breast. As soon as the nipple touched his face, a drop of milk leaked out of it, running down until it reached his lips. Instinctively, he licked his lips, surprised at the creamy flavor. He soon wanted more and put his lips to her nipple. Judging by the way milk was flowing into his mouth and how Katherine was moaning, Dwayne was doing a good job. He wasn&#39;t sure why his wife was a wolf or why he was suckling from her, but a growing fire within was pushing aside all concerns.<br />
<br />
Katherine waited until Dwayne&#39;s ears started to change, pushing up through his hair and becoming pointed, before she pulled him away. “We&#39;ll need to get you undressed now,” she said with a seductive purr, bending down to get his shoes off. As soon as she got them and the socks off, she could see his feet were already started to change into wolf paws.<br />
<br />
“Katherine, I&#39;ve never seen you like this,” said Dwayne as his body hair started thickening, his nose starting to turn dark and moist.<br />
<br />
“I know it&#39;s a big change, but so is this,” said Katherine, pulling down his pants and underwear. His penis was already very erect from her seduction so far. Katherine stroke the shaft, careful not to use her new claws. Then she gently took it into her mouth, mindful of her sharp teeth. Now it was Dwayne&#39;s turn to moan while Katherine sucked. He gripped the back of her head, his nails getting sharper as they lengthened into claws. Katherine could taste the change as his pre started to leak, she could smell his musk changing. But most of all, she could feel his cock getting larger in her mouth, filling up more of her canine muzzle. She moved her hands to his ass, noticing how furry it was getting and she could feel his tail forming.<br />
<br />
Eventually Dwayne&#39;s dick grew to the point where Katherine was starting to gag on it so she pulled back. Looking up at her husband, she saw he was mostly wolf now. Dark gray fur was covering most of his body, light fur on his front side. His face had pushed out into a muzzle and giving her a wolfish grin. However, while Dwayne&#39;s shirt was looking more filled out, it wasn&#39;t as much as she was expecting and his human hair was still a little thin. But then, she had given Dwayne only one dose so far. &quot;I think we&#39;re ready for the main event,&quot; said Katherine, crawling onto the bed and waving her tail behind her.<br />
<br />
Dwayne was eager to respond to her offer. He took off his shift before crawling up on the bed behind her. She was already so wet it wasn&#39;t hard to enter her. Dwayne&#39;s dick was bigger, but now it had a more tapered shape. Katherine moaned with pleasure as she felt her husband&#39;s wolfhood inside her. As soon as he was far enough inside, she moved her hips back to force more in. Dwayne responded by thrusting back at her. The two of them soon entered a rhythm of push and pull. Katherine was feeling more pressure behind her as Dwayne&#39;s grip on her hips grew stronger. There was a soft groan from the mattress and spring box as Dwayne started getting more massive. Katherine moaned and yipped as she mounted like a bitch in heat.<br />
<br />
She gave a bigger yip as she was suddenly flipped over, the feeling of sliding across the growing wolfhood was electrifying. She was left looking up at a much bigger wolf man. The second dose had clearly kicked in as Dwayne was not only taller but very muscular. She could also see thicker head on his head than he had before. Dwayne leaned down and kissed his wife. Their kissing was a bit awkward as neither of them were used to having muzzles. But what mattered more was that his thrusting was getting more intense. Katherine was aware of something fleshy knocking at the entrance of her love tunnel. She recalled that canines have a knot at the base of their penises to lock with their mates. But she wasn&#39;t quite ready to be stuck on Dwayne quite yet. So she wrapped her stronger legs around his hips not to pull him in deeper, but to make sure he didn&#39;t plunge in too deep. Fortunately, they were both nearing their peaks anyways. The two wolves howled as they climaxed. While Katherine allowed Dwayne to pump his seed into her, she held him back to keep from knotting in her.<br />
<br />
The two of them panted happily, though they far from tired. Dwayne couldn&#39;t remember being so full of energy. And as much as he&#39;d like to mate all night long, there was one thing he needed to know about. &quot;Ok...now that&#39;s over...you mind telling me...why we&#39;re werewolves?&quot; asked Dwayne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not werewolves...Animalians...&quot; panted Katherine, &quot;And you can...thank our son...for that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s quite a...Christmas present...&quot; panted Dwayne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly,&quot; said Katherine, her breathing normalizing, &quot;It&#39;s a bit of a long story.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dwayne looked back at the ice tub and suggested, &quot;So why don&#39;t we discuss this over that champagne? I assume we can still drink it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I checked, we can,&quot; said Katherine, pulling herself off her mate&#39;s wolfhood, &quot;It should be cold enough by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dwayne nodded before following his mate over to the ice tub. Already he was starting to think of her in wolf terms. But that was one of many things he was going to have to get adjusted to.</p>
