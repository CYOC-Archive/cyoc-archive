<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of the car journey was relatively uneventful. George&#39;s mom had gone on a long-winded story about something that had happened at work, which luckily meant you didn&#39;t have to talk. Every now and then, you&#39;d catch a glimpse of yourself in the rear view mirror. Your face was looking more mature, with a sharper jawline, thinner lips, and slightly more defined contours. The sort of changes that you would definitely notice but would have to point out to anyone else. Meanwhile the small smattering of stubble that could have been mistaken for dirt was steadily increasing in coverage, spreading across your jawline and up to your cheeks. It was unnerving seeing these changes occur so quickly. When you used the socks, it was expected and even desired, but this felt more of a violation.<br />
<br />
 As George&#39;s mom pulled onto the curb outside your house, you were pleased to note that your own car was missing from the driveway which meant your parents were still shopping. However, there was still the issue of your brother still being at home. Your dad didn&#39;t mention him when dropping you off at the sports club, but they also didn&#39;t like to leave him home alone for extended periods of time. Nevertheless, you grab your bag and get out of the car with Colby. You stretch you body after being cramped in that tiny space and feel your shirt ride up your stomach. You had begun to bulk up, your abs were slightly visible under your skin. The thin line of hair that existed below your bellybutton had expanded and thickened, now stretching upwards where you could feel it had conjoined with the equally thickened patch of hair in the centre of your chest. You yank your shirt down, blushing from embarrassment since it didn&#39;t completely cover your hairier stomach. You hide the gap with your bag and turn back to the car. George hadn&#39;t gotten out of the car and you could hear him arguing with his mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going anywhere mister. You&#39;re still in trouble for getting home well past curfew last night&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;But moooom, it was only by half an hour!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The time you arrived past curfew doesn&#39;t matter, you were still late. And you didn&#39;t even phone us! You had us so worried!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you it ran out of battery, otherwise I would have done&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have used one of your friends&#39; phones. And pay phones still exist. There&#39;s no excuse. Now say goodbye to your friends and we&#39;ll get going&quot;<br />
<br />
George huffed angrily and grumbled a goodbye, quietly adding &quot;keep me in the loop!&quot; before closing his car door. His mom started the engine and drove off. While you were disappointed that he couldn&#39;t be with you to help, you appreciated and admired his mom&#39;s parenting skills and that she didn&#39;t back down on her rules. He disobeyed her, he has to pay the price. You rub your forehead in annoyance, you knew those were the sort of thoughts your dad would have on the situation. You needed those socks fast. <br />
<br />
You and Colby walk up to the front porch but before you could knock, you remember your current predicament. &quot;I can&#39;t go into my house looking like this, I&#39;m sure Tim will notice that I don&#39;t look the same&quot;.<br />
<br />
Colby nodded and asked &quot;So what do we do? Same as last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not exactly. I want you to knock and ask if you could get something from my room like a DVD or a video game. Since you don&#39;t go to soccer practice, you have an alibi as to why I&#39;m not there&quot;.<br />
<br />
You leave Colby on the front porch and find a particularly overgrown bush to hide in so you could keep an eye on the situation. Once you felt safely hidden away, you stuck a hand through the leaves and gave Colby a thumbs up. He knocks on the door and waits for a moment. You could see a figure approach the door through the frosted windows but they looked much too big to be your brother. As the door opened, you gasp in surprise as your dad stands within the doorframe. He was supposed to be out shopping with your mom! Where was Tim? Colby looked just as surprised as his whole body tensed up. You hear him stammer &quot;Oh h-hello sir. I&#39;m Colby, one o-of your son&#39;s friends. He asked me t-to get something for him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh did he now? Why couldn&#39;t he come and get it himself?&quot; your dad asks, his deep voice rumbling through your eardrums.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he&#39;s playing soccer right? He was going to come to my house afterwards so we could play a video game he bought but he forgot to bring it to practice with him. I&#39;m not on the soccer team so I said that I would get it for him&quot;.<br />
<br />
You could see your dad&#39;s face scrunch up in his trademark &quot;stern parent&quot; look and give Colby a good up-down stare before grunting in approval and standing aside. &quot;Alright, but be quick. The game&#39;s on and I don&#39;t want to miss anything&quot;. Colby&#39;s body relaxed at the approval and he ran into the house before your dad closed the door behind him. <br />
<br />
You begin questioning what had happened. You dad would never pass up a trip to the mall, he was more of a shopaholic than your mom was. Maybe he got worried about leaving Tim home alone and your mom went alone but if anything, it would have been the other way around. While you ponder the possibilities, your phone starts blaring its signature ringtone. You fumble with the device, still struggling with its interface, and manage to answer a call from Colby. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you say you put the socks again?&quot;. His voice sounded very nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Inside a shoebox that I put on the bottom shelf of my wardrobe. It should be the only one in there&quot;.<br />
<br />
Colby made an anxious groaning noise and replied &quot;They&#39;re not in here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?&quot; You cry. How could the socks have gone missing? You only put them in that box a few hours ago, there&#39;s no chance they could have disappeared in that time! Unless... &quot;What&#39;s in the box?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s some spare change, some old drawings, uhm, some magazines I probably shouldn&#39;t talk about...&quot;<br />
<br />
You cringe at his list but ask &quot;There aren&#39;t any shoes inside are there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, no shoes or socks. Just paper&quot;<br />
<br />
You sigh in relief. &quot;OK I think I know what&#39;s happened. Can you find my dad again?&quot;<br />
<br />
You clamour out of the bush and sneak up closer to the house. You find the window that looked into the living room and spot your dad slouched on the sofa in his usual spot, watching a football match on the TV. He laid with his back to the window, but you kept low to the ground in case he turned around. You could just about see his feet resting on the opposite side of the sofa, a pair of loafers adorned them. You notice Colby standing outside the doorway and you give him a little wave. He flinches when he sees you, probably not expecting you so close to the house, but nods and walks into the room. You dad hears him enter and you can hear his gravelly voice say in the background of your phone &quot;You get what you came for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby replied &quot;I couldn&#39;t find it in his room. But I&#39;m on the phone to him now and he says it might be in here somewhere&quot;. Then he speaks directly to you &quot;Where is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
You point at your dad through the window &quot;Take a good look at his feet. What do you see?&quot;. <br />
<br />
You watch Colby circle around to get a look, only to see the colour drain from his face. He starts stammering &quot;He&#39;s... He&#39;s... Got them on!&quot;. Your suspicions were correct, the man laying on the sofa wasn&#39;t your dad after all but someone pretending to be him while wearing the socks! And not just anyone but your own brother!<br />
<br />
The hefty man immediately sat up, his demeanour looking more cowardly than earlier, and asked &quot;Who&#39;s got what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re wearing the socks!&quot; Colby responded. <br />
<br />
Tim yelped and leapt up on the sofa, sitting on his feet and saying defensively &quot;I-I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about! Now I think it&#39;s about time you left young man!&quot;.<br />
<br />
You take this as your cue. You grab your house keys from your pocket and rush over to the front door, sticking it in the key hole and opening the door. You storm through to the living room to confront your brother. He turns around with an unusual look of childish shock on his middle-aged face. &quot;What? Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You could see your reflection in the mirror on the wall opposite you. You had grown even taller, your shirt no longer covering your exceedingly furry stomach and your pants had split several times around your meaty legs. A thick patch of dark hair stuck out from the collar of your shirt, stretched thin across your massive upper body, and moulded to the shape of your heavy pecs. A dense stubble several shades darker than your hair coated your entire lower face, probably several days worth of growth if it hadn&#39;t sprouted within the past hour. It stretched down your neck and connected to the fur that stuck out of your shirt. Your jaw had squared out considerably while your brow had gotten heavier. You looked like you were ready to graduate college, let alone high school. No wonder Colby looked surprised when he saw you through the window! You cross your substantially hairy arms, ignoring how tight your shirt felt around your muscular arms and your thicker chest. A satisfying smile crept across your stubble-coated face. &quot;I&#39;m your brother, and I need those socks right now!&quot;.</p>
