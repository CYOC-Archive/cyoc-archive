<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I tried opening my mouth to speak, but no words came out. I had completely forgotten about the workout session I had planned. The worst part was that even if I wanted to say no, I didn&#39;t have any choice. Any excuse would look weird, and I probably already looked weird enough.<br />
<br />
So I went with it. I didn&#39;t question why Ryan slipped off his clothes and left them outside my door and I didn&#39;t question why the previously stern police officer wouldn&#39;t stop smiling as he moved his weights into my room. I just quietly helped him and stood awkwardly in my room and he smiled at me expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you want to start with?&quot; he asked. As if on instinct, I looked at his cock, which stood at attention for me. If I was being honest, I didn&#39;t get enough cum from Jacob and Chase and that itch in my throat remained. Not to mention, I hadn&#39;t even cum yet, so my cock stood hard and ready. I so badly wanted to jump on him, but I knew better. Fucking a police officer wasn&#39;t going to help me in the long run.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, how about some basic curls?&quot; I suggested, my eyes still on his cock. He turned, breaking my line of sight and snapping me out of my stare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good. How much do you normally start with?&quot; he responded. I wordlessly pickles my usually 50lbs and nodded at him. He picked up two 60&#39;s and began going through the motions.<br />
<br />
It should have been easy working through the sets, but clearly the break was having its toll. I barely managed to get through one set before realizing that I needed to go down some pounds for the next one. I knew I wasn&#39;t supposed to do that, but I wouldn&#39;t have been able to go through three more sets like that.<br />
<br />
I was relieved when Ryan also went down a notch, looking confused as he did so. I knew I wasn&#39;t as strong as him, but I didn&#39;t want him to think I was weak.<br />
<br />
Another set passed and I realized that even my current 40lb dumbbells might&#39;ve been too much. Ryan seemed to be struggling, too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, seems like we might be a little tired today, huh?&quot; he chuckled nervously. I nodded in agreement before switching to his 30lb set. He didn&#39;t even have a lighter set. If I couldn&#39;t do this, we&#39;d be in trouble.<br />
<br />
Luckily, I barely managed to pull through. I set the weights down, panting in relief. Something was wrong. I shouldn&#39;t have gotten this weak just because of a couple of day&#39;s break.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we should try something else? Abs?&quot; he suggested. I had no choice but to agree, though I was puzzled by my sudden weakness.<br />
<br />
I grabbed my weights and got into a resting crunch position. Ryan got to my feet and held them in place. Nervously, I began lifting myself. Luckily, it felt like I was able to handle about the same as usual with my abs. Everything would&#39;ve felt somewhat normal if it weren&#39;t for the fact that Ryan kept staring at my legs. As if on instinct, every time I caught him staring, my knees would spread apart, so he kept getting a nice view of my cock. It was more of a struggle keeping my legs closed than it was lifting my weights. Although, it didn&#39;t look like he was complaining, since every time I did open them, it looked like Ryan was gravitating towards my cock, which somehow remained hard throughout all this.<br />
<br />
By the time I was done with my set, I felt lightheaded. Not from the workout, but because of everything that had been going on today. Everything was just so weird, and I had no one to talk to about it. It felt like I had no control over myself, and... I kinda liked it.<br />
<br />
Ryan seemed to notice my fatigue and mistook it for weakness. I panicked, worried that he would think I was some weak little fag, and immediately began my next set. I wanted to impress him for some reason, and I cleared the next two sets without issue. I would&#39;ve been happy about being back to normal, but something still felt off.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay buddy? Or are you just in the zone now?&quot; Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
Wait, that was it! I didn&#39;t feel anything! Usually, when I worked out, I felt a light buzz. It was like I could feel myself getting stronger and the weakness leaving my body. Now, however, I didn&#39;t feel that at all. In fact, this all felt kinda boring.<br />
<br />
I went through another set, but this time I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about how boring this all seemed. By the time I finished, I couldn&#39;t wait to give my weights to Ryan and switch positions. This all just seemed so pointless.<br />
<br />
Ryan began working through his sets and I knelt to hold him in place. For some reason, however, I couldn&#39;t keep his legs together either, and I could feel myself unconsciously moving towards his long, juicy cock. It was clearly very distracting for the both of us, and while Ryan was able to finish his set, he didn&#39;t seem too satisfied either. He got up and looked at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what? Why don&#39;t we just focus on legs for now?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
I wanted to agree, but I immediately thought of something more interesting. I had never thought of it before, but now I was drawn to the idea. &quot;H-how about glutes?&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
He looked astonished and slightly flustered by my answer. &quot;Uhhh, o-okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
We stood, and I looked at Ryan, unsure of what to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be honest, I&#39;ve never done this before. All I ever cared about were my arms and abs really,&quot; I admitted. Ryan seemed to understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, I&#39;ll go first. You stand in front of me so you can see my form,&quot; he explained.<br />
<br />
I nodded and got into position. He took the dumbbells into his arms and looked at me to make sure I was ready. We were way closer than we should&#39;ve been, but for some reason, I couldn&#39;t bring myself to step away. Wordlessly, Ryan began performing squats. Each time, he got this close to my cock, enough that he could stick his tongue out and lick it before pulling up. I couldn&#39;t look away as the police officer did his reps. I could feel my breathing increase slightly each time he came close and I desperately wanted him to do more.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, before I knew it, he was done with his first set. &quot;Alright, now you try,&quot; he suggested.<br />
<br />
Nervously, I grasped the dumbbells and got into the resting position he had been in. Slowly, he came up behind me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I&#39;m gonna stand behind you to make sure you&#39;re keeping your form,&quot; he explained. He proceeded to stand way too close to me, but something about it made me not want to protest. Instead, I began to squat. As I began to do so, I ended up feeling Ryan&#39;s cock press against my ass, causing me to jump back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa there, that was too fast. What&#39;s wrong?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-your cock,&quot; I stated, as if that explained everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with it? Do you need it?&quot; he replied worriedly. Did he really not see the issue? &quot;Oh, I get it. Yeah, you should be going far past that. In fact, you should be getting to the point where it&#39;s almost at your neck. That&#39;s a good indicator that you&#39;re getting the full range of motion. Good thinking!&quot;<br />
<br />
He really saw no issue with his cock all over me? Then again, what he said did kinda make sense. It would help me have better form, right? Plus, if he saw no issue with it, it would look weird if I did.<br />
<br />
I had to pretend like there were no issues even if I thought there was one. I took a breath to calm myself. I didn&#39;t notice before, but the room smelled like a lot of cocks and cum. It was funny, but I don&#39;t think I properly tried to smell anything ever since Chase tried to fuck me. Yeah, of course this would be fine. It was actually a great idea. Go me!<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; I replied with a giggle. This would be a great way to help me work out. I quickly resumed my resting position and, without hesitation, began squatting. As I did so, I could feel Ryan&#39;s cock run along my ass and up my spine. Fuck, that felt good. Everytime I went down, I made sure to breath out all the air in me, and by the time I got back up, my nose was filled with the sweet aroma that graced my room. After a few amazing reps, I could tell Ryan felt just as great based on his light moans. He was definitely trying to stifle them, but he was failing.<br />
<br />
I was slightly disappointed when I finished my set. I turned to face him and found that I had to look up slightly to get a good look at him. Our breathing was ragged as we looked into each other&#39;s eyes. I hadn&#39;t noticed before, but it seemed like his brown eyes had lightened a bit. Now, they had a similar color to his hair. He looked pretty cute. I felt a stirring in my groin, and I knew what I wanted once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Should I go for another set? I reaaaally enjoyed the last one,&quot; I noted, giggling a little. &quot;Orrr...&quot;<br />
<br />
I honestly didn&#39;t know what I was suggesting, but it didn&#39;t matter. Before anything could progress further, Taylor bursted into our room. His hair was a complete mess, and he seemed different. For one, he had no body hair, and he seemed slightly shorter than before. Oh, not to mention, all he had on was a tiny pair of black briefs. Even then, I could tell he had a raging hard-on. He looked hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should probably go,&quot; Ryan stated, much to my dismay. He picked up two dumbbells and walked to the door. Before leaving he looked at Taylor one last time. &quot;I&#39;ll pick up the other ones tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he rushed out the door. Taylor then looked at me. &quot;I think something&#39;s wrong here,&quot; he began.<br />
<br />
I feel like I could remember thinking that not too long ago, but every time I tried to recall, I unconsciously breathed in that sweet smell of cock and cum... What was I talking about?<br />
<br />
I looked down and saw that my cock was still hard. That&#39;s right! I hadn&#39;t even cum yet! Obviously, that&#39;s what was so wrong.<br />
<br />
I looked back at Taylor. &quot;Yeah, I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, I pounced on him.</p>
