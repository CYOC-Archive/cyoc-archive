<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sofia can you answer the door,&quot; Claudia called from the kitchen. The elderly woman was putting the finishing touches on her spaghetti dinner, she had been looking forward to this event for the last couple of weeks and wanted everything to be perfect. &quot;Okay mom,&quot; the excited seven year old bellowed. Claudia listened as Sofia now tore through the house in a frantic attempt to answer the door. Despite what sounded like something breaking and Sofia running into a wall Claudia smiled. While Sofia was indeed a handful she was a delight to have in the house especially with Mikas magic training taking up a good part of her time. <br />
<br />
Sofia rubbed her head as she finally reached the door. The young girl had accidentally slipped and run head first into a table by the door. Quickly checking her head to make sure she wasn&#39;t bleeding she discovered a small lump. &quot;That&#39;s what I get for running in socks,&quot; she thought as she rubbed the tender spot on her head. &quot;You ok Sofia,&quot; Claudia called. &quot;I&#39;m okay mom just bumped my head.&quot; Sofia could hear Claudia sigh from her spot in the kitchen. &quot;Well please be careful and answer the door.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia now scrambled to her feet and flung open the door. &quot;Hi,&quot; she yelled with a goofy smile. Standing in front of her was Katie and Mary Elise along with their mother Kellie. &quot;Hello Sofia,&quot; Kellie said sweetly. &quot;Is Claudia inside?&quot; Sofia nodded energetically. &quot;Yeah she just finishing dinner,&quot; she said breathlessly. &quot;She cooking spaghetti tonight. You know I really like spaghetti but I don&#39;t think she made it just for me. She says she wants it to last a couple of days so she doesn&#39;t have to cook. Actually I think that&#39;s a pretty good idea since she&#39;s going to be babysitting a house full of kids but.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kellie laughed as she placed a hand on the young girls shoulder. &quot;Ok Sofia that&#39;s enough,&quot; she giggled. &quot;Why don&#39;t you show Katie and Mary Elise in while I speak with Claudia.&quot; Sofia nodded as she took both girls hands. &quot;Cmon,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;ll show you where you&#39;ll be sleeping.&quot; Mary Elise and Katie gave a befuddled look over there shoulders as Sofia led them into the house. Kellie couldn&#39;t help but smile as she made her way into the kitchen. &quot;Thanks again for having the kids over,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;The girls have been looking forward to this Christmas ended. Are you sure you can handle them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia looked up from her cooking and smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it Kellie,&quot; she said. &quot;Having the girls around makes me feel young.&quot; Kellie smiled before speaking sincerely. &quot;I understand Claudia but still a group of preteen girls and your not exactly a young woman anymore. I don&#39;t know how you do it.&quot; Claudia laughed and shook her head. &quot;Your beginning to sound like my children,&quot; she said. &quot;Trust me I can handle this. The girls are never a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled but still gave Claudia a concerned look. Before she could say anything else the door bell rang. Sofia announced she would answer it. The sound of thunderous footsteps and a thump into the wall preceded the door opening. Claudia smiled as she listened to Sofia jabber away before Samantha and her mom Julia walked in. &quot;Julia good to see you,&quot; Kellie said enthusiastically. Julia smiled as she told Samantha to put her bags away. &quot;Good to see you too Kellie, Claudia.&quot; Claudia looked at the two moms with a smile. &quot;You ow you two should take advantage of a free night,&quot; she said. &quot;Hit the twin, enjoy yourselfs.&quot; Kellie and Julia smiled before answering. &quot;Funny you should mention that we were thinking the same thing.&quot; Julia said. Claudia smiled as the two women called for their daughters. Mary Elise, Katie, and Samantha entered the kitchen with bewildered looks on their faces. The three adults could already see Sofia was proving to be a bit too much for the preteen girls. &quot;Mary, Katie I want you to listen to Mrs. Russell ok?&quot; Kellie asked as she looked down at her daughters. Mary Elise and Katie nodded. That goes double for you Samantha,&quot; Julia said firmly. Samantha gave a grumpy look before nodding.<br />
<br />
Claudia now made an effort to hustle Julia and Kellie out of the house. &quot;Don&#39;t worry they&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;You two enjoy yourselves tonight.&quot; Kellie and Julia nodded before saying goodbye. Claudia watched as Julia and Kellie drove off and another car pulled in. Smiling, Claudia waved as Karen and Tricia exited their car. &quot;Good to see you ladies,&quot; Claudia called. &quot;And perfect timing the others just had their moms drop them off.&quot; Tricia and Karen smiled as they walked towards the front door. &quot;Well that&#39;s good to hear,&quot; Karen said. &quot;Guess that means we can get started.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can we get inside first,&quot; Tricia said as she rubbed her arms. &quot;This cold is brutal on an old gal such as myself.&quot; Claudia smiled as she escorted the two women in. Taking the women&#39;s coats Claudia headed back into the kitchen to check on dinner. &quot;Spaghetti is almost ready,&quot; she said. &quot;Can you two do me a favor and set the table.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia and Karen nodded as they grabbed plates and silverware out of the drawers. &quot;So what are we doing tonight,&quot; Karen asked casually. &quot;Sleepover,&quot; Claudia said with a grin. &quot;So,&quot; Tricia asked tentatively. &quot;Guessing that means we have to get changed.&quot; Claudia nodded. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me your still worried about reliving your youth for a night,&quot; she said. &quot;We already agreed on this. Besides it will only be for one night then tomorrow will be more adult oriented fun.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tricia is just nervous about what&#39;s going to happen with Samantha and myself,&quot; Karen stated as she pushed her glasses up. &quot;I already told her she has nothing to worry about. Besides maybe I can make some progress with the girl if we&#39;re the same age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not just that,&quot; Tricia said. &quot;The ring always makes me nervous ever since Halloween. I always worry about it now.&quot; Claudia smiled as she looked at the two elderly women. &quot;Well fortunately for you your in luck,&quot; she grinned. &quot;Mika can you here for moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika entered the kitchen now carrying three glasses. &quot;Here you go Claudia,&quot; she said. &quot;Merlin showed me how to make it so it shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Besides I needed some potion practice anyway.&quot; Claudia thanked the young girl as she took the three bottles from her. Passing them to Tricia and Karen she took hers in her hand. &quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about the ring tonight Tricia,&quot; she said. &quot;Like Mika said she made this. It&#39;s a youth potion so we get younger as we drink it. As an added bonus it works over time so the results won&#39;t be immediate. The more we drink the younger we get, by the time we finish we&#39;ll be able to fit right in with the girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen and Tricia took a look at the concoction and give it a quick sniff. The aroma was pleasant like fruit. Deciding to take a quick sip the two women felt a familiar tingle. Glancing in a side mirror the two women noticed some of the grey in their hair start to vanish and their wrinkles decrease. When the tingles stopped the two women looked around sixty. &quot;I think this will make it more interesting,&quot; Karen said with a smile. Claudia smiled as she took a sip as well becoming sixty as well. &quot;I thought you two might like it,&quot; she said. &quot;This way we control how fast we become younger. Now let&#39;s eat, we&#39;ve got a fun night ahead of us.&quot;</p>
