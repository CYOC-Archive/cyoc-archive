<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now please don't be fooled into thinking that Lee a grown man would so simply accept the loss of his humanity. He was more than willing to help in science if he was paid and then not having to donate more than one day out of his life. He as many who came before him were willing enough but the ideals of Pleasure Island is devious and cloaked in evil.<br />
<br />
Lee laid there on the exam table unable to move much but knowing he'd been dooped into giving up far more than a day in his life to science. The sight and feelings he was having were to say the least those of a man feeling fear and an animal getting the instinctive urges to run.<br />
<br />
Blood preasure was elevated and this worried the head doctor as he and his nurses worked about Lee. <br />
<br />
Questions came to mind now, but with his already reformed head and mouth the ability to make more than bestial sounds made him stay silent. The nurses did though comment on Lee's silence making the wrong assumption he was willing to become an animal.<br />
<br />
Lee, in very harsh fact was not so willing even though he was having strange lusty thoughts form all the female scents abounding in the room. Sweat of his body and the perspriation of the nurses working feverously about was giving Lee his first of many to come sensual suggestions.<br />
<br />
Rocking his hips side to side the suggestive thought of bestial desire and passion was making him quite erect. He as any human effected by the morals of human society would have been slightly embarressed by such, but not Lee. He was mentally past such considerations as with the drastic change of his head the brain had taken on some characteristics of the bovine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there Lee you desire for sex is duly notated! We will be accounting to this with an upcoming surgery which I suspect will heighten the desire even more.&quot; announced the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Hearing this the words took their place in Lee's mixed up trail of thoughts. He continued to try and hump the air till a squirt or two ozzed out his penis' end.<br />
<br />
Soon Lee was alone except for a televison monitor and his twisted feelings and passion.<br />
<br />
A flicker of the screen as the program began. It was a view of the conferance room where the doctor and his head nurse sat informing the managerial staff of Lee's contined progress.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have here with this subject the best prospect of success! Lee' that's his name, was willing to enter the one day testing but after hearing the monitary offer of $100. per day for two years the thought of such reward made the choice even more simple. He being more mature will undoubtedly retain more memories and then be able to with our retention serum transmit those learned patterns to the calves. He is our best possible chance for success!&quot; announced the Doctor with pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;James Addler, I need to ask a legal standing here as to what might come opur way from next of kin? I mean you can't just tell the authorities that people just up and vanish time after time. Your subject's relatives may come looking for him and then what? We have had this problem quite often within the Pleasure Island Park System. I mention this because Jeb Flycatcher and his cohort Whifflepaffer have made so many donkeys out of boys and now girls that my desk is plastered with queries. Now we must make something up, a story line which will make your subject Lee a hero while keeping him under wraps for your scientific experiments.&quot; <br />
<br />
The din of comments rolled around the room as back on the exam table an interested Lee laid there tied down, helpless to do anything but listen.  <br />
<br />
More conversation continued until a very plump man stood up and made a point not asked as yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Myron Pennyford, Your physical changes have started on the subject, I wonder if his full physical body need be trasitioned to bovine? If he was made sexually able to mate with the cattle and in time returned to his normal self would it not be cheaper in the long run? Why change him to a bull in total form if all that is needed be his sperm?&quot; asked Myron.<br />
<br />
Again others spoke but not in turn as the rumbling of dissatisfaction rolled around the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop!&quot; said the doctor in a loud and profound manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lee is being preparred for a two year testing as a procreator of inspired cattle. The result of our testing if successful will generate a total new breed of beef cattle. The calves and as they mature will retain the added instinct afforded by their sire father giving them a basic form of intelligence. This special intelligence will give them knowledge of what to eat and which plants would cause indigestion or even death. <br />
<br />
Now once the calves mature over a two year period these new breed of cattle can be shown into the market. As Lee would by this time have been a Charolais bull in form and daily manners his continued ability to impregnant cows giving more of this new breed makes him prime to be placed in long term testing as a leased sire to other farms, ranches, and feed lots.<br />
<br />
I see him as a very valuable item to which if all works out to my pattern of thought Lee should remain a bull permenantly!&quot; explained the Doctor as his nurse nodded her head in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;My God Man, what of the two year contract?&quot; yelled James Addler.<br />
<br />
&quot;What of it? Lee won't be of any position standing on all fours and mounted over a horny cow to suggest he'd sue! His aires will think he accepted a job in South America and we will keep up the cardss and letters till one day a notice will be sent of his accidental death. Then he is totally ours and even the $100. per day fees won't need be paid to a bull. Its easy and perfect, we are winners all around and even Lee is a winner!&quot; says the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile a mixed up Lee is watching the men who will decide his future. He has many questions but try as he might the best he can muster is a, &quot;Muraha!&quot; as a bovine sort of bellow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor, Pennyford here, I wish to ask a question about the subjects physical body. I know the process is a common one which the Park Association has found to be profitable. Yet it puzzles me as to your subject's male gender parts, they obviously don't, or aren't of the pattern a bovine is born with? I mean those made as donkeys are generally fitted with such organs in the same locations. Your new project here will be needing a sheath out his belly not his groin to look proper when put to service as a bovine sire&quot; asked Pennyford.<br />
<br />
The nurse got up and positioned an easle and a large pad of paper.<br />
<br />
Getting slowly up the Doctor flips a page showing the two patterns of urine flow and locations of testicles on both human and bovine. He begins and points to the two as if this is nothing but the everyday thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see Mister Pennyford has a good question which in the past we'd left to the serum changing the DNA and then expecting the subject to become totally bovine. In fact it works well in all body parts, bones, and muscles, with this function as the ringer. Instead I will tomorrow perform a surgery on Lee moving the urination tract to the postion just below his navel. The testicles will be enhanced with hormones to grace him a ball sac worthy of his soon to be bullish self. The reformation serum will instill the needed growth making his penis transition to bovine in shape, color, texture, and the length for making him a sound sire of cattle.&quot; explained the Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gentlemen, it is then agreed that we allow the good doctor to continue onward with his most rewarding experiment. I give to you James the task of making a respectable cover story and keeping it going for the next eighteen months. Once we have Lee set in his daily task of sire he can be notated as dead to his relatives and burried in grave somewhere about South America.&quot; announced the General as he persided over the meeting.<br />
<br />
A happy group of satisfied men walk out the conference room on two feet each. All this time a strange creature laid strapped to a steel exam table in the Doctor's lab. He is so angered at what he's heard that white foam is bubbling out past deep red colored lips. Feeling even more betrayed by all there but seeing his body changing minute by minute he is unable to do anything about his situation.<br />
<br />
The nurse and doctor talking together about the experiment walk into the lab together. The angered enraged sight of Lee foaming at the mouth tells all as he has heard too much for his own good.<br />
<br />
Seeing his problem the Doctor motions for a seringe and while distracting Lee's argered attention the nurse plunges the needle into a slightly hairier thigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, you will calm down and listen to what I have to say! One must imagine that to put you through all this is costing us quite a sum of money. Also once the reformation process has grown you from a manly form of 200 plus pounds, your ultimate form will be close to a ton. we can grow a body into a larger form, but making it receed back and become human again is quite out of the question both from a physical health matter and from a monitary one, you see? I believe that once you have atained total bovine form the thought less even the desire to retun to human life will be quite out of the question. You, in time and with my supervision will become a Charolais bull worthy of high sire fees and a life of tender care.&quot; says the Doctor as Lee drifts off into slumber and sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is perfect for this, Doctor!&quot; says the nurse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm?&quot; says the doctor as he looks at Lee now sound asleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;If we can do him so well then a second bull would be twice the profit!&quot; mumbles the Doctor.<br />
<br />
The nurse giggles!<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked the Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sir, I know you and your hatered for people who take your work for granted. Those who know of your special ability and make, or try to make you look foolish in the face of others. I see your thoughts, I know what you think!&quot; says the nurse.<br />
<br />
Putting his hands on hips the Doctor gives his favorite nurse the evil eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, you want to be a Charolais cow!&quot; says the Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! You know I don't, but you would like to see that idiot James Addler on the exam table mumbling his fate as he changes to a Charolais bull too!&quot; said the nurse.<br />
<br />
The Doctor smiles and reaching over pats the nurse on her pretty face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah you do know me all too well, don't you my dear!&quot; says the Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lee is now out cold I suggest we prepare for surgery and fix his plumbing!&quot; suggested the Doc.<br />
<br />
Ready soon to begin the nurse is smiling at the Doctor. &quot;I suspect that by the time you allow Lee to awaken he will be ready and able to walk the earth on all fours!&quot; says the nurse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe!&quot; replies the Doctor as he picks up the scalpel.</p>
