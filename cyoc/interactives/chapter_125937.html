Note # 2: This chapter is a  rewritten and updated combination of the chapters &quot;Nat&#39;s new Teacher&quot; and &quot;Alice the Scientist Witch&quot; written by The 1 (me). One of the main reasons for this rewrite is because the chapter, &quot;Nat&#39;s new Teacher&quot;, had a continuity error that contradicted with the chapter, &quot;Patchwork&quot; by ChronoSeth. I later written the chapter, &quot;&quot;The Basement&quot; to fix the continuity error, but I ended up making the plot hole a lot more noticeable.  So in order to allow other writers such as ChronoSeth for example to add on to this story segment, I rewrote two chapters to act as a starting point. I took my time to write a chapter this time. Some content was changed, some was removed and some was expanded upon. The plot hole regarding Isaac&#39;s Halo of Purity and Souls has been fixed (I hope).  I hope this revision allows other writers to add on to this without the worry of plot holes.  So with none further ado, here&#39;s my revision of this part of the story. Please enjoy.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Isaac woke up with a jolt.<br />
<br />
He was sweating hard. That dream felt so real.<br />
<br />
But just to make sure... &#39;Ilivir? Dark Isaac?&#39; Isaac mentally spoke.<br />
<br />
...no response. <br />
<br />
Isaac let out a sigh of relief. Maybe it really was a dream... <br />
<br />
&#39;NOPE!&#39; Dark Isaac shouted in Isaac&#39;s head. Giving him a headache in the process.<br />
<br />
&#39;Good morning Isaac.&#39; Ilivir greeted.<br />
<br />
So he really is hearing voices in his head... Having two other people share his halo is going to take some getting used to...<br />
<br />
Isaac thought back to the visions he saw. A couple of them showed that old witch who offered to take his cock away. But why did she need his cock? Then a thought struck him. He recalled that lab filled with disembodied cocks. Did they trespassed on that witch&#39;s mansion? But why would she live here on the cloud plane! The last he saw of her, she was on the material plane. Does she has the ability to transport to other worlds? That would explain all the stuff from the material plane that he saw in the mansion. The best he can do for now is speculate. <br />
<br />
As Isaac looked around the front porch, he saw that it stopped raining and it is now morning. Mary was putting away the nap sacks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Mary.&quot; Isaac greeted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Isaac. Help me pack up. I don&#39;t want to be around when the owner of this mansion returns.&quot; Mary seems a lot more relaxed this morning. Sleeping really helped.<br />
<br />
Once Isaac finished packing up, he noticed that his oracle hand mirror was missing!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary! Were is the hand mirror!&quot; Isaac shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nat borrowed it while you were asleep. She&#39;s out practicing her magic as we speak.&quot; Mary was busy packing up her bag but she spared enough effort to point the general direction she went.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot; Was all Isaac said when he ran into the forest looking for Nat.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
As Isaac ran in the general direction Mary pointed, he heard familiar voices in his head. &#39;Well would you look at that! That girl had the balls to steal your mirror! You better punish her!&#39; Dark Isaac encouraged.<br />
<br />
&#39;That girl&#39;s magic is no match for my high paladin magic! I will show her what it means to steal from a paladin! Just let me take control of your body.&#39; Ilivir quipped.<br />
<br />
&#39;I have no intentions of punishing her. I would be curios enough to take the mirror if I were in her shoes. So no Ilivir. I&#39;m not going to release control of this body so you can punish her. I need to talk to Nat.&#39; Isaac mentally responded.<br />
<br />
&#39;Not if I have a word with her first! Move over Isaac! Time for me to take over!&#39; and with that, Dark Isaac started pushing his will against Isaac&#39;s will.<br />
<br />
As Isaac struggled for control over his body, Ilivir decided to take control as well. &#39;Stand back you feind! Isaac promised me a body first!&#39;<br />
<br />
As the two spirits tried to overpower Isaac, the red gem on Isaac&#39;s Metal Halo glowed a crimson color. &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Isaac shouted.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac and Ilivir was suddenly mentally pushed back by Isaac&#39;s spirit. It&#39;s almost as if the halo powered Isaac&#39;s soul for a breif moment.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac was seething with anger. &#39;Silly paladin! I can use the halo&#39;s power too!&#39;<br />
<br />
And so the red gem glowed a brilliant red light as the two Isaacs had a mental battle inside the Halo. The Halo was providing power to both Isaac and Dark Isaac. However, it became obvious that the Halo was providing Isaac with more power. Dark Isaac was eventually defeated.<br />
<br />
&#39;I give up for now, but I will find a way to take your body one day.&#39; Dark Isaac said. He made no move to attack after that. <br />
<br />
Ilivir trusted Isaac enough to find him a human body so he two stopped attacking too.<br />
<br />
Isaac has no intention of losing control of his body yet. So he kept running through the forest. But Dark Isaac wasn&#39;t done yet.<br />
<br />
&#39;I may not have the power to overtake you yet, but I can at least plant seeds of doubt in your soul.&#39; Dark Isaac seems to lose all animosity. As if he is in thought. &#39;In all honestly, I only know as must as you do. But that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t figure things out on my own. Let me ask you this. Who does the black and red soul belong to? The possessed armor?  And, If all the souls you captured are stored in your body, then why am I in your Halo? Am I&#39;m really a part of Azaviel or is it that a small sliver of every soul you absorb becomes a part of your soul to form me? Or am I just a part of your soul? I wasn&#39;t shown on the soul mirror so maybe I&#39;m not a  separate soul from you.  Maybe I&#39;m really just a part of your soul after all.  Maybe I&#39;m really just a split personality created by your dark side. I don&#39;t remember or understand my own origin. I was just assuming I was born from Azaviel or the corruption. Who am I? Speaking of which, how did Ilivir&#39;s soul ended up in the red gem on your Halo? As far as you and I can remember, Azaviel never touched the halo so how did Ilivir&#39;s soul get in there? Do you have the ability to let souls into the red gem in your halo? It seems the red gem carries you and Ilivir&#39;s souls. The red gem seems to be the control panel of your body. Are you sure the ring of purity is working as intended?  Crawnav of Snowpoint Mountain Village implied that the ring is incomplete. Why didn&#39;t he finished it? Was it dangerous? He also implied that the Deity of Purity is also in the ring of purity. Is it still in the Halo of Purity? Is it in your red gem? If that&#39;s the case, then why hasn&#39;t the Deity of Purity revealed itself to you? You&#39;re both sharing the same vessel. How is the Halo of Purity is intended to work anyways? It seems to be working in unintended ways. It&#39;s as if it&#39;s upgrading itself. Almost like it&#39;s got a mind of it&#39;s own. Does it have a dark side too? Every thing has good and bad. So it&#39;s possible that the Halo has a dark side. And what about the mirror that showed you your souls? Are you sure it was showing you souls? A lot of the things you and I know are assumed, not confirmed.&#39;<br />
<br />
Once Dark Isaac finished his tidal wave of questions, Isaac had time to process them. Dark Isaac had a really good point. A lot of good points. Isaac can&#39;t believe he hadn&#39;t thought of any of them before. But he&#39;s not sure if he can answer all those questions yet. He needs time to think about them. <br />
<br />
&#39;Do you have any intention of answering those questions?&#39; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;I am a part of you. If you don&#39;t know the answers to these questions then why should I know them myself? These questions has been plaguing me all day... So I thought I should have them plague you too, brother!&#39; Dark Isaac said cheerily.<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t call me brother. &#39; Isaac responded. <br />
<br />
&#39;We are two sides of the same coin!&#39; Dark Isaac responded.<br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe we should think of a different name for you. Dark Isaac doesn&#39;t seem fitting for you anymore.&#39; Isaac observed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then call me brother! Or keep calling me Dark Isaac. Don&#39;t get me wrong. I still feel every bit of lust you have. Every temptation and dark thought. Each and every urge you have to fuck. I may not understand what I am, but I still feel every bit of your dark side.&quot; Dark Isaac retorted.<br />
<br />
Ilivir was quick to argue with Dark Isaac.<br />
<br />
&#39;You are a disgrace to the paladin name! Die demon!&#39; The two started a fighting in Isaac&#39;s halo.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh please! Don&#39;t you see the irony of what you just said! You&#39;re too cowardly to be a paladin!  Being a paladin is not good enough for me. I rather be a dark knight!&quot; Dark Isaac retorted.<br />
<br />
With Dark Isaac and Ilivir temporary busy, Isaac decided to ignore the mental fight to the best of his ability and focus on finding Nat. He had other maters to worry about so he chose to just ignore Dark Isaac and Ilivir for now.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Eventually, he saw Nat crying next to a tree. When he came closer, he saw that she was holding the oracle hand mirror. <br />
<br />
As Isaac stepped closer, Nat saw him coming. &quot;You! You didn&#39;t tell me this thing could show me what could happen!&quot; She accused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I didn&#39;t know of it&#39;s power until I found out while I was asleep!&quot; Isaac defended.<br />
<br />
Nat looked skeptical but then she looked defeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to know if I would be able to save the town if you didn&#39;t came... And the hand mirror showed just that.&quot; Nat turned to Isaac with tears in her eyes. &quot;If you didn&#39;t came... Me and my entire town would be completely destroyed! Erased from the map! No one survived! I... was electrocuted to death...&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac was shocked by what Nat saw, but he also wasn&#39;t surprised. He remembered the vision were he, Mary and Ilivir went straight into the mountains. Nat was nowhere to be seen in that vision.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s done is done. No mater what path we take, not everybody is going to be saved. The best we can do is cherish what we do have. It&#39;s a good thing I came. Otherwise, you and Mary wouldn&#39;t be able to evacuate the survivors.&quot; Isaac reassured Nat. <br />
<br />
Come to think about it, if Isaac hadn&#39;t fought Azaviel, then Ilivir wouldn&#39;t have regained his humanity. Sure, he doesn&#39;t have a body anymore but at least he doesn&#39;t have to obey Isaac&#39;s commands anymore. Ilivir was free and Isaac was happy for that.<br />
<br />
Out of pure emotion, Nat passionately hugged Isaac. &quot;Thank you for bringing Marry with you! You saved my life!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two shared the embrace for only a few more moments.<br />
<br />
As the two let go, Nat regained her composer. &quot;Isaac? Can you keep a secret?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Isaac asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I also took something from the mansion. A pen.&quot; Nat admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;A pen? Where is it?&quot; Isaac asked. That pen could be a magical item.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s in my pocket.&quot; Nat pulled out a normal looking ink pen. Except that it&#39;s obviously from the material plane. It also had the name Excalibur engraved on the side. But Isaac decided not to comment on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Keep it safe.&quot; Isaac said.<br />
<br />
Nat nodded and put it back in her pocket. She then preceded to give back Isaac&#39;s hand mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry for taking it without asking.&quot; Nat apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Isaac couldn&#39;t help but smile. Nat is starting to feel like a little sister to him. Maybe it&#39;s because she looks like a little kid? Or maybe despite her being possibly older then Isaac, she still acts like a little girl. That&#39;s not necessary a bad thing. He loved playing with the orphanage kids back home and Isaac can&#39;t help but view Nat as one.<br />
<br />
&#39;When are you going to make her your spawn?&#39; Dark Isaac taunted. <br />
<br />
Isaac chose to ignore him.<br />
<br />
While Isaac was distracted, Nat resumed practicing her magic. Nat decided to shoot some fire balls at some trees in order to vent some emotion.<br />
<br />
The trees evaporated upon impact.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s impressive. Not the most creative use of magic I seen though.&quot; Isaac observed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever do you mean?&quot; Nat inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean Nathan the human sorcerer could do more then just shoot fireballs at trees. He would explore different methods of using his magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For example.&quot; Isaac touched a tree and started chanting. In a few moments, the cloud tree started steaming. until it burst into flames. &quot;See what I did there? I summoned the fireball inside the tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat&#39;s eyes were wide open with awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me show you another trick.&quot; Isaac held out a ball of magical light. &quot;This is standard paladin magic.&quot; Isaac explained.<br />
<br />
Nat was about to burst with excitement. But then she had a thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Isaac? Can I ask you something?&quot; Nat asked shyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. What is it?&quot; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you train me to be a Paladin and teach me all the magic you know? With Nathan gone, I&#39;ll need another teacher to substitute for him. You&#39;re the second best person to be my teacher. Can you also train me in using a sword too? I understand I can&#39;t rely on my magic for everything.&quot; Nat explained.<br />
<br />
Isaac couldn&#39;t be any more happy. &quot;I&#39;ll be glad to.&quot; Isaac accepted. <br />
<br />
Nat jumped for joy. &quot;Yipee!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;I hate kids.&#39; Ilivir commented.<br />
<br />
Isaac doesn&#39;t agree at all. He loves kids. And making Nat happy fills a warm place in his heart.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s the last of it!&#39; Mary thought. She just finished packing.<br />
<br />
She better get going before she gets caught by the owner of the mansion.<br />
<br />
But before she could step off the front porch, she heard the floor boards creek from behind her as someone walked out of the front door of the mansion.<br />
<br />
She turned around to see a old lady. What&#39;s strange about her is that she doesn&#39;t seem to be made of clouds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you trespassers or visitors?&quot; The strange old lady asked. She must be the owner of the mansion.<br />
<br />
Mary decided to be honest. &quot;We are Trespassers. Me and two others were passing through last night. It was raining so we decided to camp out on your front porch because it has a roof to shelter us from the rain. You weren&#39;t home and we didn&#39;t want to intrude on your mansion.&quot;  Mary explained.<br />
<br />
The old lady nodded in understanding. &quot;That&#39;s reasonable. You were respectful so I have no reason to punish you. Your two friends however... they have stolen from me. My apologies but they need to be punished.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, the old lady vanished into thin air (supposedly teleporting) and all the doors and windows on the outside of the mansion magically shut and sealed themselves.<br />
<br />
Mary didn&#39;t like the sound of her friends being punished so she ran into the forest, determined to save her friends.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Isaac and Nat were teleported to the living room of the mansion. One moment, they were in the forest and the next moment they were in the living room of the mansion. They were both frozen in place, unable to move a muscle except for their mouths, nose and eyes.<br />
<br />
Standing in front of them was the same witch Isaac met awhile ago. The same one he met back on the material plane and in his visions.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Your the one who trespassed in my home while I was off world.&quot; The old crone sneered. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s you! Why are you in the cloud plane! Do you live here- ?!&quot; Before Isaac could continue his questions, his mouth suddenly shut by itself without his control.<br />
<br />
The witch looked up at Isaac&#39;s face and immediately recognized him. &quot;You&#39;re more versatile then I thought plant man! My, you&#39;re way beyond returning to your human self... I&#39;m not even sure I should call you human anymore. I don&#39;t think you belong to any specific race. You are a combination of so many different creatures. The best word to describe you now is chimera.&quot; The witch stated. <br />
<br />
She then noticed Isaac&#39;s metal cock pouch. It feels like she can see right through the metal and straight to his cock.  &quot;My. That&#39;s a impressive cock you have there. It&#39;s completely unique. I haven&#39;t seen a piece of work like that before. Congratulations on successfully sealing a lust demon into your cock. That&#39;s a impressive feat for someone like you. It&#39;s a shame that I don&#39;t have your cock for my experiments, but I need your free will to take it...&quot; The witch let out a *tsk, tsk*.<br />
<br />
Nat looked bewildered. It this old lady a magic user too? It definitely seems like she is using magic on them. And what did she means by Isaac&#39;s cock? That&#39;s gross!<br />
<br />
Nat feels ashamed because she&#39;s way past her maturity point and her sexual organs hasn&#39;t appeared yet. Yet,  she started to feel disgust for sexual endeavors during what was supposed to be her maturity period.<br />
<br />
The witch then looked over to Nat&#39;s direction. &quot;My, my. Aren&#39;t you a  interesting specimen. I haven&#39;t seen a cloud person capable of magic in years. Who taught you?&quot; The witch requested.<br />
<br />
Nat started speaking against her will. &quot;I was taught magic by a human sorcerer who goes by the name, Nathan.&quot; The witch nodded in approval.<br />
<br />
Nat was alarmed that the witched forced her to speak! <br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I met him before. He was very naive to want the learn the secrets of the crypt.  The last I saw him, he foolishly walked through a portal. Judging by the portal&#39;s stability, he probably arrived to this plane a little more then 6 months ago. Oh well.&quot; The witch stated.<br />
<br />
Isaac was angry by the witch&#39;s disregard for Nathan&#39;s safety but was interested in what she knew of Nathan.<br />
<br />
She then noticed Isaac holding the oracle hand mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. So you&#39;re the one who took my oracle mirror.&quot; In a brief second, the oracle hand mirror teleported from Isaac&#39;s hand to the witch&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret. I have left some powerful detection magic in this mansion. So in case intruders like you comes barging into my mansion while I&#39;m off world, I will immediately know if anything were stolen.<br />
<br />
She held up the oracle hand mirror. &quot;This mirror isn&#39;t just a means to see the multiverse. It&#39;s capable of giving it&#39;s user the potential to rule over worlds. There&#39;s already enough psycho maniacs out there who are already misusing the power of oracle ore.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Admittedly, this mirror is just a spare. I already have a few back ups of my own. But I can&#39;t risk you irresponsibly using it&#39;s power to cause despair for others.&quot; She then turned to address Nat. &quot;And I already know you have one my pens in your pocket. But don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t take it. Some of the magical objects in this mansion only works for certain people. The fact that you grabbed it at all means it has chosen you to be it&#39;s wielder. I can&#39;t take it back even if I want to.&quot; She turned to face both of them. &quot;Both of you seemed attracted to this hand mirror. That&#39;s means you are both capable of using it&#39;s power. But I can&#39;t simply give it to you without testing you first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Testing us?&#39; The duo thought.<br />
<br />
The witched place the hand mirror on a table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think of this as a test to see if you are worthy of this mirror&#39;s power and as a punishment for stealing from me. I will teleport you both to the bottom most floor of my basement. It&#39;s filled with traps and curses that prevents anyone from breaking through the walls or digging out. The only way out, is to climb up the many floors and stairs of my basement back up to this mansion. If you do make it back up here, you are free to take this hand mirror and leave this mansion. By the time you make it out of my basement, I should be in a different world, so don&#39;t even try stealing from me again. Just take your mirror and leave. But be aware. The basement is were I store things both living and nonliving from many different worlds. They may have the potential to transform you in body and mind. Avoiding or adapting to them on your way up here is part of the test. Each floor has a specific challenge for you two to face. And don&#39;t expect your female friend to save you. As we speak, she is searching for you two in the forest. Even if she does realize you are in here, I have completely sealed this mansion from the outside. As soon as  you make it up here, the front door should unseal itself. It will be up to you to take the oracle mirror or not. If you think you are not worthy, you can just leave it here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The witch took a moment to take a breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;That should be all. It&#39;s very possible for you to die or decide to live in my basement. Many other creatures live in my basement, so I&#39;m fine with you living in there. But I do hope you pass my test and leave my mansion.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that said, the witch casts a spell and Nat and Isaac were immediately teleported to the bottom most floor of her basement.<br />
<br />
The witch was once again alone. <br />
<br />
She let out a sigh. &quot;I do hope those two are capable of defeating those who have been corrupted.That is if they aren&#39;t corrupted themselves.&quot; <br />
<br />
The witch thought about the former plant man. He had a floating metal ring that reminds her a lot of the ring of purity. Oh how does she misses  Crawnav of Snowpoint Mountain Village. She hopes that young man is worthy of Crawnav&#39;s unfinished gifts.<br />

<br />
