<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We finish eating our pizza at the restaurant and embark on our journey around the park.  We start towards the family rides first that way we can have fun as a family before we have to split up because some of us can&#39;t ride the roller coasters and other big rides.  We see the reason why Amelia was begging me to come here, the White Water River Rafting Race Course.  She came with her friends one time and has never stopped talking about it since.  We enter the line and wait about 30 minutes to get on.  &quot;I am so ready for this.  I can&#39;t wait to win,&quot; Amelia says.  &quot;We know! Trust me,&quot; David retorts.  &quot;You are just like him you know that, party-pooper.&quot; Mom puts and end to the bamter real quick by saying, &quot;I you both don&#39;t shut your pipes right this second, then we will send you both in the ferris wheel while we enjoy ourselves for a nice relaxing 2 hours.&quot;  That shuts Amelia up real quick while David thinks about testing his luck as he has never been on one before.<br />
When our fun on the rafting course and other family rides ends around 3 p.m., we split up so Cassi, David, and Dad can go on the roller-coasters.  Amelia tells mom, &quot; Hey, mom! You can go with them you know.  Our little missy here is more responsible than she ever has been, and I am more than capable of keeping an eye out for her.  I hate roller-coasters anyway and I am sure I can find some fun things for us to do at the carnival rides section.  I have my phone too, so I will call you if there is any trouble.  Right Melody?&quot;  She is giving me the death stare trying to use the force to manipulate me into complying with her demand.  Mom turns and ask me if that is ok.  &quot;I guess so.  I mean we could really use the bonding time.  Who knows, maybe she will become my new favorite sister?&quot; I give a cheeky smile and a wink to Cassi while she just scoffs and says, &quot;As if.  There is no way that that monster can possibly be redeemable!&quot;  &quot;And that is our cue to leave.  Have fun girls and call us if you need anything.  Oh! Here is some money Amelia.  Make sure that you take her to the bathroom at some point.&quot;  &quot;Yes, mother.  Now go!  I want to get to know my little sister better.&quot;  And with that I am stuck with the one person on Earth that hates me the most.<br />
&quot;I am so glad you chose to listen to me.  I am so going to love being in charge of you.  Now lets go to the kiddie park.&quot;  &quot;Hey, you said we were going to the carnival rides!&quot; <br />
&quot;You would be correct, but mother would have never let me take you if I called them that now would she? Now come on!&quot;  She picks me up and plants me on her shoulders. &quot; I could get used to this,&quot; I reply. &quot; Why are you actually being nice to me? What is your game here? I thought you hated me and that I was a party pooper.&quot;  &quot;Well, I figured if I start young with you, then you might just be bearable.  Besides it makes Cassi mad and that makes me very very happy.&quot; We both chuckle as we arrive at the kiddie park.  &quot;Lets do the merry-go-round first.  I am sure you would just love to ride around on the pretty unicorn wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;  My cheeks flash cherry red from embarrassment.  I don&#39;t know if she was trying to joke with me or was being serious, but either way I was embarrassed.  Moreso because I actually did want to ride on the unicorn.  We wait in the line for 45 minutes.  &quot;Ugh! This is taking forever! Amelia? When is it going to be our turn? I wanna ride the unicorn!&quot;  &quot;Wow! I was just joking earlier, but who knew? Anyway babe, we have about 10 more minutes.  I&#39;m sorry it is taking so long.  I know how much you want to ride the unicorn.  I promise it will be worth it.&quot;<br />
We finally get to ride the merry-go-round and I have the most fun I have had in a long time.  &quot;Again, again!&quot;  &quot;Sorry Mel, but the line is too long.  Why don&#39;t we go wait in line for bumper cars? I bet you would love that.&quot;  We head over to bumper cars and wait about 10 more minutes to enter the arena.  I had to ride with Amelia since I was too small to ride by myself, but she is a crazy driver, so I had more fun with her than I would by myself.  By the time we ended our turn on bumper cars it is almost 5 o&#39;clock.  All this bumping and spinning is starting to make my tummy rumble.  Amelia leads me over to the spider ride and we have to wait for another 20 minutes.  We have lots of fun on that too! &quot;That was so much fun Amelia. You are the bestest ever!&quot;  &quot;Why thank you my little lady, you aren&#39;t too bad yourself.  Whats with your sudden attitude change baby?&quot;  I retort, &quot;I could ask you the same question missy.&quot; &quot;Touche, Touche.&quot;<br />
&quot;How about this? We go ride the tilta world, then we go and find the family.  I am sure that they are about finished with their rides prettt soon. We have time to fit in one last ride, so let&#39;s make it count!&quot; She grabs my hand and we walk to the long line that is the tilta world. We are waiting for a good 30 minutes as we make our way to the front of the line.  My tummy is rumbling hard right now and I am starting to cramp up.  &quot;Amelia? My tummy hurts,&quot; I say while pulling at her sleeve.  &quot;Ok little munchkin.  After this ride we can meet up with our family and mommy can get you something for your tummy ok?&quot;  I cautiously nod my head yes and the gate opens up for us to enter the tilta world.  Me and Amelia climb in together and get locked into the cart.  &quot;Are you ready, munchkin? I am going to spin us as fast as we can.&quot;  The ride starts up and we slowly start going around.  Amelia starts spinning our wheel while my stomach starts its own sort of spinning.  As we start picking up speed, I slam into the wall and the unthinkable happens.  I just pooped my pants. I start to tear up as I come to realize what just happened.  I try to get Amelia&#39;s attention, but she is having too much fun andbthe pressure is too much for my little arms to reach against to signal her.  By the time the ride ends, the poop is smeared all over my bottom.  The only saving grace I have is that I was wearing a pull up.  The gate opens up, but I fail to notice as I am currently bawling my precious little eyes out.  Amelia finally notices me and asks what is wrong, but I am incoherent.  She picks me up and carries me out the exit and to a bench.  As she reaches the bench and tries to figure out why I&#39;m crying, she finally puts the pieces together.  &quot;Oh crap, I am really going to get it now&quot;  She pulls me into a big hug to try to console me.  &quot;Hey, it&#39;s ok. This is not your fault. It is all mine.  Mommy won&#39;t be mad at you she will yell at me.  I should have taken you to the potty, but I forgot.  We were having so much fun that it slipped my mind. I&#39;m so sorry baby.&quot;  With that she pulls out her phone and dials her final phone number for at least a month.  &quot;Hey mommy!&quot;</p>
