<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I’m home!” Eve called out, expecting to hear her brother call back to her, but nothing. As she closed to the front door, locking it, she looked up at the clock on the wall, “right, he has work tonight…” she realised, “looks like I’m making dinner tonight,”<br />
<br />
Eve’s older brother Peter was a pretty nice guy. He was 25 years old, a whopping 7 years older than her. It was a long story, but their mom and dad had a rocky relationship. He left her a few years after Peter was born, and when 6, he came back into their moms life. They started dating again, he said he’d changed, but once he accidentally got her pregnant again, he left before she was even 3 months pregnant. He was a total dick and Peter had made it his life goal to never end up like him. But at the very least he got a sister.<br />
Eve and Peter had an amazing relationship, never fighting or pissing each other off. Peter always taught Eve wrongs and rights especially when she became a teenager. Their mom always had to work late to make money, so as soon as he was able to, Peter got a job. Then after he graduated, he got another job, making a fair bit of money to let his mom slow down and not keep burning herself out (which she did a lot). <br />
He really was Eve’s idol figure, and she wanted to do everything that he would be proud of.<br />
Although, this party wasn’t best idea.<br />
<br />
She didn’t really know most of the people going. Sure, they were all from school and she knew their names and faces, but she really doubted that they knew hers. She knew Astrid simply from being friends for so long, her sister Phoenix because she’s her sister… obviously. And of course, she knew Stella.<br />
Stella was the host of the party, and she was not the nicest person to Eve… or anyone. She was rich, spoilt, and downright mean to everyone, even her ‘friends’. She had it all, and wasn’t the type of person Eve ever wanted to become!<br />
But Astrid had effectively convinced her to go to the party, and she was expecting her to be there. She couldn’t back out now!.. or at least it felt that way.<br />
<br />
— — —<br />
<br />
Eve cleaned up her dishes after finishing the dinner she’d prepared herself. She stretched, looking around the kitchen for anything else she may have forgotten to do.<br />
Nothing.<br />
She yawned, realising she had a pretty boring evening ahead of her. Her mom was working, her brother was working… she had nothing to do.<br />
<br />
She grabbed her bag and made her way upstairs, thinking of ways to pass the time. She looked at her bag, and saw it once again. The bikini!<br />
<br />
Suddenly excited, Eve ran up the stairs and into her room. She grabbed the bikini from her bag and looked at it’s immense beauty. The gold shimmered under her cheap bedroom lights as if it were a warm sun at the beach. It really was something to be astounded by,<br />
“I gotta try it on!” She said to herself, taking hers dress off as quickly as she could.<br />
<br />
Now in just her bra, she unhooked it and looked herself in the mirror. Even at 18 years old she struggled to get an ounce of cleavage to show, she was just so flat and boring… especially compared to literally every other girl she knew. Not to mention she now had a little bit of a bloated stomach from her dinner, which wasn’t helping her self-image.<br />
She shook it off, taking the bikini and placing it over her chest. The material was the most pleasant silk she’d ever felt. A perfect temperature, not making her feel any sense of discomfort whatsoever. As she fiddled around the back to the clasp or string, she realised that it was already tied… odd, she didn’t remember tying it up. <br />
But before she could ponder on it anymore, she caught herself in the mirror.<br />
She looked stunning!<br />
Something about the bikini top just brought out something in her, made her look dazzling to the eyes! Even she was astonished by it despite her ‘lacklustre’ body. She just stood there, staring at herself, entranced by it.<br />
She looked down, seeing she was still in her underwear. She slid it off and placed the bottom on and returned to look at herself in the mirror. She was amazed! It was gorgeous!<br />
As she turned herself around, looking at her butt for the first time in forever. She posed for herself, giggling to herself as she did.<br />
When she turned herself back around to take in her whole self, she noticed something…<br />
<br />
“I-Is that…” she said, almost in shock, “c-cleavage..?” She asked, staring more intensely at her chest. It looked like it, a very clear line, albeit faint, was there. She cupped her breasts, feeling them. It must’ve been the bikini but they definitely felt bigger. Before she could really take it in any further, she heard the clear sound of the door opening downstairs.<br />
She quickly grabbed a t-shirt and shorts from her closet and threw them on over the bikini. She made her way calmly downstairs to greet her brother.<br />
<br />
“Hey sis,” he said, holding two bags of random junk,<br />
“What’s all that?” Eve asked,<br />
“Oh it’s nothing,” he said, “work doesn’t have any room to store it until Monday, so I offered to keep it here until we can,”<br />
“You’re so damn nice, you know that?” Eve said, chuckling as she took the bags out of his hands. It was very heavy,<br />
“I try my best,” Peter said sarcastically, “just leave ‘em in the living room, I’ll sort them out later,” he said. Eve did as he asked and brought them over to the corner of the living room, right where he’d usually leave stuff before they put it in the garage or attic.<br />
<br />
“So how was your day?” Peter asked before Eve had the chance to ask him,<br />
“Pretty boring,” she started, “but I found something to wear tomorrow!” She said excitedly,<br />
“Ooh, you gonna show me?” He asked,<br />
“Yeah… just don’t be weird about it!” She said firmly, suddenly lifting up her shirt to reveal the bikini,<br />
“Whoah!” Peter said, quickly looking away, “I didn’t realise you had it on,” he said, starting to laugh at himself. He looked back, and suddenly looked amazed, “wow…” he said, “that is… stunning…” he said, almost unable to take his eyes off of it,<br />
“I said don’t be weird!” Eve said, wrapping her arms around herself,<br />
“N-no it’s not you I’m saying is stunning, weirdo,” he clarified, “that top looks so beautiful,”<br />
“R-really?” She asked,<br />
“Of course!” He said, then his expression changed, “you don’t get something like that for cheap… how much was it?” He asked pretty seriously,<br />
“Oh!” Eve said, “you’re not gonna believe it, but the girl in the shop gave it to me for free! As long as I return it…”<br />
“When?” He asked,<br />
“…in a couple days,” she said, realising he looked a little puzzled,<br />
“How can you give something like that up… for free?”<br />
“I guess because I’m borrowing it,” she said,<br />
“I suppose,” he said, “but still, you’re gonna make all the other girls look like peasants while you’re wearing that!”<br />
Eve couldn’t hide her smile, she grabbed Peter and hugged him. He hugged her back, “thanks big bro!” She said. He chuckled,<br />
“At this rate, you might have to call me little bro,” he said, looking at her,<br />
“W-what..?”<br />
“Well we’re almost the same height,” he said,<br />
“No we’re not,” Eve said, stepping back from him. Looking at him again… something seemed off. He was only a little bit taller that her.<br />
She was a short girl, unassuming and petite, he wasn’t much taller, pretty short for a guy, but there was definitely a difference between them. But now, it was like you could mistake them for the same height.<br />
<br />
Spooked, Eve grabbed her shirt and said, “I’m gonna be a minute,”<br />
“Everything alright?” Peter asked, “d-did I say something, I didn’t mean to…”<br />
“No… no you didn’t,” Eve lied, “just give me a minute!” She said, rushing back up the stairs. She called back down, “I swear, you didn’t do anything wrong… it’s just… I feel a bit weird!”<br />
“O-okay…” Peter replied, sounding somewhat concerned.<br />
<br />
Upstairs, Eve slipped her shorts off and looked herself straight in the mirror… something was off.<br />
To start, she definitely had breasts. It was a significant difference, there was a very clear line of cleavage between her breasts. They weren’t massive or anything, but they were definitely bigger.<br />
Her hips looked slightly wider, her legs a little thicker and defined, her waist was smaller, her semi-bloated belly had completely disappeared. She got closer to the mirror she could see her belly was even a little toned, like she’d been working out! Her face looked different, her jawline looked different, her eyes looked different! She looked at her lips and they looked different.<br />
She couldn’t believe what she was looking at. She looked at herself, she was taller! Peter was right!<br />
<br />
She grabbed the bikini, trying to find the string that held it together, but she couldn’t. She started panicking and grabbed the bikini and just pulled it!<br />
And it released. No strain, nothing, it just untied itself. As the top came off, the bottom fell right down as well. She looked at them, puzzled, then back in the mirror…<br />
<br />
It was her. The underwhelming body she was so used to…<br />
Was she going crazy? She couldn’t figure it out. She didn’t want to figure it out. Whatever it was about that bikini was messing with her head regardless, and she wanted nothing to do with it.<br />
Placed the bikini back into her bag, stepped away from it, and decided she was going to go downstairs to drink some water.<br />
She put the shirt and shorts back on and made her way back downstairs to take her mind away from everything.<br />
<br />
— — —<br />
<br />
After about four hours of relaxing with her brother, Eve had almost completely forgotten about everything that had happened. She explained to him that the bikini started ‘feeling weird’ and she wanted to take it off. He understood and didn’t ask any further, knowing the limits of his sister as she knew his.<br />
They watched TV for a few hours, watched a movie for a few more, and eventually tired themselves out.<br />
Eve decided she’d had enough and was going to go to bed.<br />
Right as she was about to head up the stairs, she was caught by her mother who had just walked through the door,<br />
“Sorry I’m late again, you know work… it’s a nightmare,”<br />
“Oh hey mom!” Eve said, approaching her for a hug,<br />
“Hey hun,” she greeted her, “is your brother home?”<br />
“Yeah, he’s in the living room,”<br />
“Hey!” Peter yelled,<br />
“I’m just about to go to bed,”<br />
“Oh okay sweetie, sleep well,” she said,<br />
“Thanks mom, try to sleep tonight as well,” Eve said, knowing her mother has a habit of not sleeping very well. She finally made her way back upstairs and into her room.<br />
<br />
As she was changing into a pair of pyjamas, she caught her eye on the bikini once again. A slight shiver down her spine struck her suddenly,<br />
“What’s your problem, huh?” She said to it, to herself. Nothing responded, she didn’t expect it to respond… but for some reason she felt… guilt. Like she’d disrespected it in some way. She made her way towards it and picked it up, “I-I didn’t… mean that,” she said to it, to herself. She looked herself in the mirror, holding the bikini. She held it up to her chest, looking at it over her pyjamas.<br />
Although she didn’t really want to wear it, especially while she slept… she felt like she needed to. Like it was the fair thing to do. To respect the article after she’d been ‘so rude’ to it.<br />
Unsure of herself, but too tired to really think about it, she undressed herself and put the bikini set back on. She looked at herself, “Plain old Eve,” she said, “I don’t even feel like I’m worthy enough to wear this damn thing,” she finished. She grabbed her pyjamas and put them on over the set and folded herself right into bed. <br />
<br />
As she quickly began to doze off, she felt something… like a warmth. Like someone was embracing her. She felt an amazing comfort once again, and she dozed off to sleep peacefully…</p>
