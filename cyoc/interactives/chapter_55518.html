<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gillie looked over the scene before her. All of the officers that had volunteered to storm the manor, along with four others that Penny had freed from the gallery, were beaten, broken, and likely unable to move for quite awhile. The bulk of the pack appeared to be in much the same condition.<br />
<br />
&quot;And all of this started because two kids played with this game, even if reality has changed,&quot; Gillie silently sighed to herself, &quot;at least they all apparently learned their lesson and I'll get Frank and Daryl... no... Fran and Darla back eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
The whole thing was giving her the sensation of a headache. Reality was altering too much... Frank and Daryl had never existed, they had always been Fran and Darla and likely married to Jensen, probably with Julie as well after Fran had called Julie her sister. Her other officers had always been Leomen with the exception of Gary being female, and the Hardys had always been Leomen as well, and had apparently joined the force sometime in the past in this new reality. And then Elise or Fox... or perhaps both, when he remembered Jacob's use of the words &quot;Prime Mate&quot; had been married to Gary... explaining why he looked like someone ripped his heart out and chewed on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go outside for a bit,&quot; Gillie sighed toward Fran, who was already checking the work of one of the gathered helpers, &quot;Sort some things out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay,&quot; Fran said without turning, &quot;Glendale is normally pretty quiet, and with this Serenity woman working to kill the game, I'd think things will only get quieter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's if some nut with a turn doesn't decide to use it,&quot; Gillie sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would tend to think that after Kurse's actions, most of those with turns would be too scared to use them,&quot; Fran responded, &quot;People commonly use it to gain some sense of power over another... to suddenly learn that they never had control over it would be frightening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure it would,&quot; Gillie answered, &quot;but it doesn't hurt to be cautious.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Gillie slowly left the medical wing she slowly began to move through the hallways of the manor. Largely intending to go outside or find these cubs that Gary had mentioned. Figure out how reality made Gary the husband of Fox or Elise or both.<br />

<br />
Glendale 1688<br />
<br />
&quot;The end is coming,&quot; Olga said inside what was the fairies home in Glendale, &quot;darkness and hatred... evil and despair... only a faint hint of hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Olga, just lay there and relax,&quot; Titania said weakly placing her hands on the shoulders of the other Fae, &quot;You're not making any sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Olga since her transformation had behaved very strangely. Most of the Fae felt indebted to the witches for reuniting them with their lovers and families. Olga was terrified of them, as if she saw the witches for what they were and not for whatever &quot;masks&quot; they showed the world. Titania and her lover, Pucca, had long taken it upon themselves to look after Olga, or at least make sure that someone kept her safe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fairy friends!&quot; a voice called out through their home from outside it, &quot;are you home?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was Joella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ophelia? Can you get that? I'm busy with Olga!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Titania,&quot; a third Fae's voice.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Outside, Joella sat patiently on a large branch near the opening into the three that the fairy's lived in. It was in the backyard of home the witches resided in, as part of their choice of residence to repay their debt. After a few moments, a lone Fae came to the entrance hole to the the tree's interior, which the fairies had hollowed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Joella,&quot; Ophelia said politely to the girl, &quot;I take it you wish to play?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Ophelia, is everything okay?&quot; Joella asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;About as everything is,&quot; Ophelia answered, &quot;Do you wish to play?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a favor to ask of you and the Fae folk,&quot; Joella spoke politely, &quot;I was hoping you would grant me this favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ophelia fluttered up onto Joella's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is that?&quot; Ophelia wondered, &quot;Normally your foster family members call for us or one of us goes to help them with some project of theirs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No this has nothing to do with Goldwyn, Gita, Griselle,&quot; Joella answered, using the witches' original names. She had never heard the witches use the names they preferred around her... possibly out of fear that the girl would run away from a woman who's name meant &quot;abomination&quot;, or one that meant &quot;place of the skull&quot; and was named for the site where Christ was Crucified, or one named for a city so sinful that God had had it completely and utterly destroyed, &quot;it is more of a personal favor, you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is this family I met, they don't have much, but the children wished to be fairies, a fairy princess and fairy prince,&quot; Joella told Ophelia, &quot;I was hoping you and the other fairies could transform them... if they truly wish it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want us to make humans like us?&quot; Ophelia asked, &quot;why not...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you're nice to everybody,&quot; Joella cut her off, &quot;and I don't want to force it on them. I want them to know full well what will happen if they truly wish to be fairies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Ophelia commented, &quot;I'll get a few of the others and be right out. Do you need any help getting down?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be fine?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, she went right to the fairies?&quot; Lawrence interrupted, &quot;I thought you said she'd talk to them first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She talked to them before letting the fairies transform them,&quot; Marie explained, &quot;Most of the fairies were recruited first to give Joella that the fairies were real. If she didn't, Joella might have been passed off as having the sickness and tossed out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The fairies went along as proof?&quot; Betty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Marie nodded.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
About half an hour later, Joella knocked a lower class door on the east side of Glendale. A rather dirty and tired looking man answered it. Joella could here the sounds of the two children playing elsewhere in the home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something I can do for you miss...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joella, and it's something I might be able to do for you and your family I could come in and talk in a room with an open window before your family,&quot; Joella spoke.<br />
<br />
The man gave her a puzzled look and then sighed, &quot;I don't think there's anything that can be done. The madness is going everywhere. I don't know what's causing it, but I do know that it's hurt my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I think I really can help,&quot; Joella urged innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might as well, I am somewhat desperate,&quot; the man sighed heavily.<br />
<br />
He then led Joella into his home to a living room where his wife was fixing a pair of tattered clothes and the two children were playing checkers. He then opened a window while Joella cleared her throat to get the attention of the others in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello everyone,&quot; Joella spoke, &quot;My name is Joella. I must first apologize to your children for listening in on their conversation about the Fae and the fairy race, but I couldn't help but overhear... but maybe that is not entirely bad as it did offer a way to help, if you'll take it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fairies are nothing but a fantasy,&quot; the mother spoke up, &quot;Likely only brought up because of the epidemic claiming so many.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, fairies are real, and I assure you that they are not behind the epidemic,&quot; Joella insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you know that?&quot; the father questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I've met them,&quot; Joella answered, &quot;they are sweat and kind and would never cause the epidemic that has made me cry myself to sleep sometimes at seeing friends come down with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've been the girl trying to help those who have it,&quot; the mother spoke, beginning to recognize Joella's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Joella sniffled, &quot;but I've had no luck...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you know fairies?&quot; the girl asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and I've brought some to show you,&quot; Joella then gestured to the window.<br />
<br />
They all looked and gasped at what they saw. Standing there were four female and very much naked fairies. Very small in size with butterfly-like wings, insect antennae, and no clothes. The mother and father were too flabbergasted to cover the eyes of their children.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are Ophelia, Desdemona, Portia, and Hermia,&quot; Joella introduced the four fairies, &quot;they can transform you into fairies, if you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do it! Do it!&quot; the children immediately chorused, to the shock of their parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;A moment, please,&quot; Joella spoke, &quot;there are some things you should know before any decision is made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; the mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will take over from here, Joella,&quot; Ophelia spoke as she fluttered into the room, &quot;first of all, our society is entirely female. We have no male fairies...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then where do baby fairies come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of us have ever had babies... and to be honest, I feel like I will be around for a VERY long time,&quot; Ophelia spoke, &quot;If we had babies like the races of man, we'd overpopulate the globe and end up accidentally starving everyone. We don't want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you're all female...&quot; the father began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ophelia nodded, &quot;as a result, our sexuality is what you humans would call sinful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sexuality?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whom we prefer to spend our evenings with,&quot; Ophelia answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you do magic?&quot; a boy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is how we would transform you if you accept the offer,&quot; Ophelia nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do it!&quot; the girl urged.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not finished explaining,&quot; Ophelia answered, &quot;as you can see by our appearance, that if you accept you will shrink down in size and will not wear clothing... and once we cast the magics to make you like us, you can not go back to being human, you will be a fairy for the rest of your lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
The daughter seemed all for it, the son seemed somewhat more reluctant, but also seemed loyal to his sister. If she went, he would likely go too.<br />
<br />
&quot;How has the epidemic affected you?&quot; the father asked, he seemed highly reluctant, but Ophelia and the fairies could see a protective fire in him that rivaled Titania and Pucca's protectiveness of Olga.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our kind has not been touched by the epidemic,&quot; Ophelia responded, &quot;Olga is a little strange at times, but two of our fairy friends, Pucca and Titania think that was the result of an accident that occurred with her fairy powers when they first manifested with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you thinking, Harold...?&quot; the mother gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beatrice, the epidemic is striking children in particular,&quot; the father, Harold, answered, &quot;I'm not to keen on living in sin, but I don't want to see my children come down with this epidemic either. I'm inclined to let them go if only to save them from the epidemic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about their aunts, uncles...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They barely even write since we came here,&quot; Harold replied, &quot;I don't think they care... and we both know we can't protect them from this epidemic... and I think God might have forsaken us for our sins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What sins? You've been just as pious as the preachers,&quot; Beatrice answered.<br />
<br />
Harold only sighed, &quot;Even still, do you want to see our children sick with this epidemic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I can't leave them alone,&quot; Beatrice answered.<br />
<br />
Harold only sighed again, &quot;Why can't you create male fairies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because none have ever existed,&quot; Ophelia answered, &quot;it is why we brought this to you first. We didn't want to force anything on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold only sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't leave our children, Harold,&quot; Beatrice spoke, &quot;if this is the only way to save them from the Epidemic, then I will go with them. Make sure they have someone who can raise them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold only sighed again, &quot;and why are you all naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We feel free this way,&quot; Ophelia shrugged, &quot;besides, the Lupmen and Leomen do not wear cloths, but you do not question their nudity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They'd cook in the summer,&quot; Beatrice explained, &quot;I met one of the Omegas once while she ran one of the few errands they have outside their manor. Their fur is thick and insulating. It has to be murder for them in the summer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our magic keeps us warm,&quot; Ophelia nodded, &quot;we practically swim in it. And our people do not mind nudity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that,&quot; Harold grumble, noticing that none of the four Fae were making any attempt to cover themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must have your decision,&quot; Ophelia said weakly, &quot;Do you wish our help or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; the girl cheered while the boy slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I give my consent,&quot; Beatrice spoke, as long as you take my husband and I as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beatrice!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because I'm not leaving our children does not mean I'm leaving you either,&quot; Beatrice answered, &quot;I want you with me as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to be female,&quot; Harold answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps they could shrink you down then,&quot; Beatrice commented, &quot;you and our our son could be fairy sized humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be possible, though among our people, you would have to conform to our standards,&quot; Ophelia spoke, &quot;Nudity, and likely an increased sex drive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold only sighed, &quot;If only to save my children from the Epidemic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Ophelia nodded, &quot;we'll start with you and your son. Please stand in the center of the room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Desdemona, Portia, and Hermia soon fluttered from the window ledge to hover beside Ophelia while Harold went to stand beside his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;This shouldn't hurt,&quot; Desdemona spoke, &quot;but if it does, we're sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold and his son watched as the four fairies began circling over them while holding hands. As they did so, little golden particles of light seemed to gather  in the center of their circle. Beatrice also noted that their antennae were glowing.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, the particles of light where dropped onto Harold and his son. The two almost immediately began to feel a strange tingling sensation go through their bodies. At first they didn't know what it was, but after a few moments they began to realize it as their clothing suddenly began to feel bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're shrinking...&quot; Harold spoke slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Ophelia said from above them, &quot;you said fairy sized human. We are presently at our normal size. Clothing made for humans is way too big for us... not that we'd wear it if did fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their shrinking continued rapidly until there seemed to be nothing but a pile of mens and boy's clothing on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harold! Jasper!&quot; Beatrice had dropped to the floor, afraid something had gone wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm here,&quot; a softer voice said, mostly a result of the reduced size, &quot;these clothes are a lot heavier now.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a few moments, Beatrice saw a man, only millimeter or two taller then the fairies climb out of Harold's clothing. Jasper was still the same age as he was before, and proportionately the same height he was in comparison to his father, though Beatrice was certain that the actual measurement would be different. Harold did his best to try and cover his &quot;parts&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is a handsome man,&quot; Portia observed, &quot;maybe we could try to find some way to make male fairies...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ophelia shook her head and turned to Beatrice, now holding her shrunken husband son.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd best set them aside and prepare for your turn, ma'am,&quot; Ophelia spoke, &quot;for you and your daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beatrice slowly nodded at set them on an end table nearby. She then went to stand by her daughter as the four fairies began circling again. Harold only watched as the fairies repeated the same motions they had done with him and his son. Once done, he slowly watched as as his wife and daughter seemed to shrink into their clothing, though before they vanished into their clothing, he did see two insect-like antennae spring up from the heads.<br />
<br />
Shortly after a new female fairy fluttered out of Beatrice's clothing and then rapidly flew to Harold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beat...truuuuuu...&quot; Harold was unable to saw more as the fairy began kissing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Jasper asked curiously as his mother had never been that open about showing her affection for his father before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom is just showing dad that she loves him,&quot; came his sisters voice.<br />
<br />
Jasper then turned to see his sister fluttering in the air on pair of yellow butterfly-like wings. Unlike the four fairies that had come with Joella and their mother, his sister looked like she was still a child, while the other fairies looked to be in their twenties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ruthy?&quot; Jasper asked.<br />
<br />
Ruth nodded, &quot;It's still me... except now I AM a fairy princess!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And while you and your father remain with us, you are honorary members of the Fae folk, even if not truly in form,&quot; Ophelia spoke politely, &quot;Desdemona, help Beatrice carry her husband to her new home with us. I will help Ruth carry her brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about us?&quot; Portia and Hermia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can talk with me,&quot; Joella offered from the doorway.<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Maddex had to admit that while he didn't think turning people into fairies was the answer, at least Joella and the fairies were upfront about it, rather then sneaking in the dark and forcing it on people, the way the witches had, and commonly driving people insane in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;So for the parents it was a sacrifice to save them from these &quot;wandering demons&quot; the witches were spreading?&quot; Maddex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and as far as I know, the fairies treated Harold and Jasper as they did any other fairy,&quot; Marie nodded, &quot;lots of love and affection. Though, with the introduction of a male into their society, if Harold and his wife were still genetically compatible, I'm sure there are male fairies now as it is the male that ultimately determines what the gender of his offspring will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; Lilly and Cassandra got curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother will tell you when you're older,&quot; Maddex said to them quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwww.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it, that it was the introduction of Beatrice, Harold and their children into the fairy's society that finally prompted them to leave,&quot; Lawrence commented, &quot;I mean, they weren't created by the witches, so they wouldn't feel &quot;indebted&quot; to them for reuniting their family, and one could even say that the witches's machinations in Glendale were the very reason they accepted Joella's offer in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie nodded, &quot;Harold and Beatrice didn't learn everything about the witches other then that they had helped &quot;reunite the fairy families&quot; and even assumed that the witches were actually trying to stop the epidemic of madness attacking Glendale when they learned that the fairies were helping the witches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would not that have meant they would feel indebted to help them cure the plague that the witches had, in fact, unleashed?&quot; Alice wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;All of the fairies could sense the witches powers,&quot; Marie told her, &quot;by comparison the fairies were no where near that strong. Griselle with Solome had transformed Pucca, Titania, and Olga on her own. It took four fairies to accomplish the same feet with Harold and his son and then with Beatrice and her daughter. Harold reasoned that the fairies, even together didn't have the strength to stop the madness assaulting Glendale, and that that task was better left to the witches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not knowing that the whole thing was the witches' fault to begin with,&quot; Maddex grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Marie sighed, &quot;but with their debt paid to them, even Titania and Pucca saw no reason to really remain, and agreed with Harold's idea to seek their prosperity elsewhere. Unlike the witches, who saw freedom as an absence of rules... the fairies knew that freedom was in the choices one makes. The witches set about removing those choices to enforce what they saw as freedom, the fairies did not... which I guess would be another tragic portion to the story. Joella and fairies ended up being more what the witches thought themselves to be then the witches did...&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You're leaving?&quot; Gomorrah growled at Titania and Pucca as the two fairies explained what their people were doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Titania admitted, &quot;you helped us reunite our families, and for that we are grateful, but the debt that we owed you and your sisters for that has been paid in full. As you seek your freedom here, it is now time for our people to truly seek our freedom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't leave, I forbid it!&quot; Gomorrah yelled, casting lightning at the two fey.<br />
<br />
Titania and Pucca easily dodged the attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're sorry Griselle,&quot; Pucca spoke, &quot;but it is what we have to do. You have your sisters, your Godfather, your &quot;new&quot; Joella. We wish that things remain friendly, but our future isn't here. We must go. We're sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Pucca and Titania flew out the open window, leaving Gomorrah alone, seething in anger. From the use of a name she no longer wanted to hear, but mostly from the fact that they weren't following her forever. Wasn't that what friends did? Always stayed together, forever?<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;But of course, not every friend stays there forever,&quot; Marie sighed, &quot;Katherine and Marie would stick together because of their mutual connection to the Church, even after the battle against the witches was done. But the real world doesn't make that sort of exception for everyone all the time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie then sighed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And by that time, the witches only lived in a fantasy world, oblivious to what they were truly doing,&quot; Marie then finished, &quot;and that would ultimately prove to be what lead Marie Cruz to them. As people left Glendale, they took the horror stories of the epidemic with them. Marie and her comrades would hear these stories and from the &quot;refugees&quot; would learn Glendale's location.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said before that the people of Glendale didn't call them in,&quot; Betty pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;And indeed they didn't,&quot; Marie answered, &quot;they were already headed to Glendale by that point. Talking with the people fleeing the witches and their chaos merely helped them get there quicker then might have otherwise... and the people they talked to would actually urge them to avoid the town at all costs... but that's still a little bit in the future. There is still Katherine's family reunion and Marie's internal debate over whether she should reveal her &quot;past life&quot; to Draco.&quot;</p>
