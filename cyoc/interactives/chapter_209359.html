<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kim was terrified, she didn&#39;t want to fall victim to the outbreak happening at school and become a mutant.  She remained hidden in the file cabinet and when she realized that the noises had died down, she decided it was a perfect chance for her to escape. She came out of the cabinet and ran out of the library.  There were still a few mutants in the hallway, but she still found herself lucky as they were either distracted, relieving themselves in their lust or tired after several orgasms.  She took advantage of this to sneak between them unnoticed, being careful not to slip into the puddles of cum that were here and there.<br />
<br />
Within minutes she had managed to safely leave the school building and headed straight for the parking lot.  There she found Shelby, a girl who studied at the school, who was hiding among the cars. Kim offered a ride to help the girl escape too, and Shelby quickly accepted. With that the two arrived and got in her car, which they used to go to the librarian&#39;s apartment.<br />
<br />
Feeling safe, Kim called the authorities to report what had happened at the school, only to be informed that they already knew and had a team on the way. After that happened, Shelby out of nowhere grabbed her and laid her on the floor, sitting on top of her and immobilizing her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing Shelby?&quot; Kim asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Miss Brooks, but I misled you.  It&#39;s too late for me, I&#39;ve already been infected and I&#39;ve already mutated.  I thought that since after changing, my appearance is pretty much the same as before, I would just need to resist the urges that it would be okay, but I can&#39;t hold back anymore.&quot; Shelby said as she ripped open the librarian&#39;s pants and panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, this cannot be true.&quot; Kim said<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it&#39;s true.  I&#39;m sorry, I really didn&#39;t want this, that&#39;s why I was hiding in the parking lot.  When you showed up there I thought about infecting you right away, but I resisted, but I couldn&#39;t deny it when you offered to take me out of there.  Now I can&#39;t anymore, I have to do this.&quot; Shelby said, grabbing her own head and forcing it up.  The student&#39;s head completely separated from her body, revealing that her neck was a foot long cock that had been stuck in a pussy that she had between her shoulders the entire time.<br />
<br />
Kim protested, but Shelby still stuck her dickneck in her pussy and fucked her until she came, all the while asking the librarian for forgiveness.<br />
<br />
When her orgasm ended, Shelby took her dickneck from Kim&#39;s pussy and sat on the couch putting her head in her lap. She apologized once more and said that having to fuck herself all the time to keep her body whole made her unable to resist.<br />
<br />
Kim tried to better understand what the student meant, but her mutation started to happen. She totally freaked out when her hair fell out and passed out. Shelby was the only one who witnessed the entire transformation of the librarian, who was very unlucky with her transformation. <br />
<br />
Kim lost her arms and legs, which were absorbed by her body.  what was left of her torso and head took on a cylindrical shape and elongated into a huge 10-foot cock as thick as a tree trunk. This cock later split into three of the same as what was left of her hip developed into a gigantic ballsack occupied by 7 testicles each the size of a car. Due to her size, the apartment became too small, forcing Shelby to run outside where she saw one of the walls of the 2nd floor apartment give way and Kim fall out of the building. She noticed that only one of the librarian testicles was still growing and when it stopped it was already the size of the last testicle alone was already the size of Kim&#39;s entire apartment.<br />
<br />
At this point, it looked like the transformation was complete, as Shelby didn&#39;t see anything else changing.  The student called 911 to rescue a newly transformed mutant, informing them that she was too big and one of those unable to move on their own. <br />
<br />
After ending the call Shelby got close to Kim for better sailing, and discovered a huge vagina in the ballsack directly behind the biggest testicle. After touching the ballsack there was movement and shortly afterward a scream could be heard coming from inside.<br />
<br />
Shelby, realizing where the scream was coming from, put her head inside the giant pussy, but it was very dark and when she went back to get her cell phone again her head escaped and she had to grab it quickly before hitting you on the floor. She put her head back in place and entered the giant pussy fully.  Activating the cell&#39;s flashlight she saw that she was inside the giant testicle and, connected directly to a wall at the very back, was Kim&#39;s entire original top half.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe it, I actually turned into a mutant.  I was hoping it had all been a nightmare.  What have I become?&quot;  Kim said<br />
<br />
&quot;Basically you are a set of giant cocks and balls, we are inside one of your balls and your pussy is the entrance.&quot; Shelby said and at that moment her left arm came loose and fell to the ground, with her falling right after as both of her legs came off. &quot;This is a problem, I have to find a way for my arms and legs to stay in place even when my dicks aren&#39;t hard.&quot; she said, took her drooping arm and started stroking a canine cock that was where her shoulder would connect, making it hard but stopping before coming, so did the canine cocks that were at the ends of her legs. Having regained her erections she removed her skirt, revealing a total of three pussies, and placed the canine cocks in her legs in the left and the right pussies, thus reattaching her legs in their places.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooohhhh, it&#39;s so sensitive.  I can feel you moving and... oohhhh.... It feels too good.&quot; Kim said<br />
<br />
&quot;Please wait a while.  And if there&#39;s anyone out there.  Let me finish assembling and I&#39;ll try to scare away the curious.&quot; Shelby said, having removed her shirt to ease access to the pussy she had on her shoulder and reattached her left arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s too late... It&#39;s coming... I&#39;m going to cummmmm.... Aaahhhh.... I&#39;m cumming.&quot; Kim said and the walls began to move restlessly, along with a heavy noise coming from outside.<br />
<br />
Shelby ran and came out of Kim&#39;s pussy, turning around and seeing the huge ropes of cum coming out of her cocks and falling hard to the floor, exploding and spreading in all directions. She watched until the end of her orgasm the street turned white, and then she ran back into Kim&#39;s ball and said &quot;You made a hell of a mess out there with all your cum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What a shame.  Despite all my fear of becoming a mutant I wish I could have seen it, but trapped inside I can&#39;t even do that.  But changing the subject, did you see if I hit anyone with my cum?&quot; Kim said</p>
