<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two unknown lovebirds in the other room on the second floor were Andrew and Sabrina. While Ronnie was turning Jake into daddy/coach Jake, the more heterosexual pair spent the night together, only to wake up early, when the first rays of light hit their room. Careful not to wake anyone up, they scurried down the stairs and were met with the mess done by the gargantuan coach and his student.<br />
<br />
“Yuck…” Andy whispered, only to receive a side eye from his girlfriend. Why out of two of them he is the one being disgusted? It&#39;s not that Sabri loved the sight of two cum-crusted muscle bears either, but it wasn&#39;t too surprising, knowing their virile coach. Jake was still spread out on the floor, snoring like a diesel generator.<br />
<br />
The duo tried to tip-toe to the kitchen, but an unfortunate floorboard squeaked far too loudly and unfortunately Brody woke up.<br />
<br />
“Ugh…”<br />
<br />
“Good morning, baby bear.” Sabrina cooed.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, can&#39;t see shit…” Brody tried to open his eyes, but his face was coated in a dense layer of viscous white goo. He used both hands to clean it up, smearing it down and onto the already far too wet and dirty jacket. Blinking a couple of times his vision cleared and he turned towards the pair.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, good morning. How&#39;s the night?”<br />
<br />
“Definitely not as interesting as yours.” Andy chuckled.<br />
<br />
Brody stood up from the couch. The jacket was wet, but didn&#39;t cling tight enough to his skin, so he unbuttoned it and with a little effort took it off, now being completely nude. It&#39;s not like there wasn&#39;t a massive naked gorilla on the floor already.<br />
<br />
“Damn, dude…” Andy retaliated in a flirtatious, but joking manner.<br />
<br />
“Like what ya see?” Brody responded in the same unserious manner. The borders of flirting and banter were pretty diluted from now on. He hit the most muscular, flexing his entire body for the two guests.<br />
<br />
“Andy, you should really hit the gym. Imagine going to a school full of jocks and looking like this.” Brody said in a lightheaded manner, but the condescending notes were obvious.<br />
<br />
“Ehh… I mean, Rina loves me for who I am already.” Andy tried to defend himself.<br />
<br />
In the meantime Sabrina, who had already left the scene, responded with a pretty obvious “Khe-khem!”<br />
<br />
“Come on, man! Don&#39;t ya wanna look like me? Just ask coach right here. He&#39;ll make you like me in no time!”<br />
<br />
An approving whistle from Sabrina was heard from the kitchen. It&#39;s not that she wanted Andy to turn into a complete meathead just like coach or Brody, but he sure would look better with some meat on his bones.<br />
<br />
“Listen, you can have this coach&#39;s lucky jacket. It&#39;s like a… proof that I… accept you into jocks!” Brody gave him his warmest smile and handed the wet jacket. “Anyway, I&#39;ll go wash myself off all that spunk.”<br />
<br />
Brody rushed to the bathroom. His every step accompanied by a loud thud. A testament to just how heavy he was now. Entering the shower cabin used to be so easy. Before. Now his shoulders were too wide to get in like a normal person. Accepting the new norm, he got in, closed the doors and turned on the water. Feeling clean water on his skin was refreshing, after being coated with sweat and sperm. He lathered himself up, only to be met with an unfamiliar feeling. There was something attached to his skin… That was… hair? Yep, it definitely was hair. Brody now possessed a marvelous carpet of fur all over his front, legs and even a beard! He wasn&#39;t just big now, he was hairy as fuck. And he loved it!<br />
<br />
Brody quickly realised that he wasn&#39;t just washing up. He was worshipping himself. He was flexing, groping his bulk everywhere, squeezing his soft fat and sturdy muscle. The feeling of his body brushing against itself with every move was better than any prelude in sex, so his cock went full hard again all by itself, but Brody wasn&#39;t interested in jerking off again. He wanted to finish washing up, just to witness himself in all his new glory.<br />
<br />
Brody cleaned the last of the foam off his voluptuous form and once again squeezed through the doors, standing in front of the full height mirror. For most people the mirror is more than enough to fit them from head to toe, but for the new Brody… Well, he mostly fits. From a rough guess he must be at least 6’8” or somewhere like this.<br />
<br />
First impression, Brody looked just like he expected. He looked like a younger, shrunken down and not as exaggerated copy of his already pretty young and giant coach. They didn&#39;t look like father and son, of course, but definitely like the coach and his best performing student. Their skin tones and hair colours are far too different after all.<br />
<br />
Brody brought his arms up and flexed them, rising a pair of mountain peaks of beef. What&#39;s that? Two veins thick like hoses, snaking over his biceps, through his shoulders and disappearing into his pecs. Flexing his arms also revealed a pair of hairballs in his armpits, that looked more like some overgrown hamsters. They were so dense and fluffy… Brody instantly imagined some dork burying his face deep into one of those bushes, sniffing that jock B.O., licking that furry armpit.<br />
<br />
Brody’s face looked as young and boyish as before, maybe a little rounder and fatter, but overall still relatable to his age, except for his obvious patchy beard. He didn’t get coach’s bushy moustache, instead having a light dusting of fuzz on his cheeks and around mouth. His facial hair was more akin to a neckbeard, concentrating under his chin and on his whiskers into long fuzzy patches.<br />
<br />
Brody continued his self-examination, glancing down from his face. His neck was wider than his head at base, melded together with two traps on each side. His shoulders were the size of small pumpkins. Finding shoulder guards that fit will now be an issue for sure. His flexed arms were bigger than a normal dude&#39;s head. His forearms were thicker than a normal dude&#39;s thighs. His hands were so big, Brody could fit a dozen apples in just one palm. Yeah, getting hit by a fist this big will surely result in a concussion. Oh, and his forearms and knuckles were so hairy! Another gift from the coach. Even his triceps and shoulders had a dusting of fuzz on them.<br />
<br />
On the topic of hairy, God, his front was hairy. Brody broke from his flexing stance and started sliding both his hands through the thick curls of fur on his melon pecs and gut. Fuck, that feels amazing. Who needs a cat or a dog, when his chest alone has more fluff on it. Brody just couldn&#39;t stop himself from groping and squeezing his fat muscle tits and his stocky belly, then pinching his fat nipples. Surprisingly, once all of coach&#39;s cum was digested, his musclegut subsided noticeably. No, of course, it was still there, a heavy and solid half of a globe attached to his midsection, but without so much cum inside, his pecs did in fact jut out about an inch further than the gut, his nipples red and engorged, pointing down due to his pecs’ immense weight.<br />
<br />
Yet, despite being this much hairy in the front, turning around revealed that Brody&#39;s back was mostly smooth. Mostly, as only a furry trail sprouted down from the back of his head and disappeared into his ass crack. He flexed again, just to see each muscle on his back curve and bulge out. Brody was so wide, that when simply walking down a corridor at school other kids will have to be extra careful, ducking or going sideways, just to not collide with the thick arm or the cannonball shoulder.<br />
<br />
Brody&#39;s ass was a beautiful bubble-butt, soft and squishy. His legs are thick like trunks, although noticeably fatter than the rest of his body and lacking in definition. But who needs chiseled legs when you have an upper body like this? Those legs are very girthy and hairy anyway.<br />
<br />
Finally, the desert. Brody turned around again. It was already fully erect with a bulging head and so many veins. And it curves up just like coach&#39;s. Where&#39;s the measuring tape? No, obviously his size is undeniable, but Brody wanted to know exactly. Let&#39;s see… 14 and a half inches long! Yep, he&#39;s definitely the #2 Biggest Dick in school. After coach Jake, of course. Man, how long is coach Jake then? He must be at least twice as long, right? Fucking hell, dude! Two feet long cock? That&#39;s ridiculous!<br />
<br />
Lastly, Brody&#39;s ballsack was hairy, hanging at the midpoint of his thighs, housing a pair of at least oranges inside. He rocked front and back, his nuts swinging like a wrecking ball. <br />
<br />
Despite his dick standing at full mast, Brody just wasn&#39;t in the mood for jerking off. He just hung the bath towel onto it, like a coat hanger and called it a day, leaving the bathroom.<br />
<br />
On his way out, Brody first went to the living room, where he met coach Jake scrubbing the dried cum off the couch.<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s up, kid? Ya know how hard it&#39;s to clean up dried cum?”<br />
<br />
“You tell me, ha-ha.”<br />
<br />
Coach Jake turned his head to Brody, gazing him up and down. Ronnie wanted Jake to become a daddy, but right now he was brimming with dad energy.<br />
<br />
“Come on, kid. Put on some pants.”<br />
<br />
“You aren&#39;t any better, coach.” Brody replied, watching the two feet long sausage peeking far out of coach’s very tight shorts. Some guys with pretty big dicks have a banana-shaped outline when they wear tight pants, this man will never not have a giant cock-shaped outline no matter how big his pants are. There’re just no pants that are too big for these mammoth legs.<br />
<br />
“Whatever, kid. Where&#39;s my jacket?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, fuck! Sorry, coach. I gave it to Andy. Wanted to, ya know, shape him up for the team. I&#39;ll go ask him to give it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t. Andy&#39;s a good boy. But we&#39;ll make him better.” Coach Jake winked at Brody. His powerlifting team is shaping up just right.<br />
<br />
While Brody and coach were chatting, Ronnie finally descended from heaven to earth, down the stairs, walking right up to Brody.<br />
<br />
“Morning, Ronnie. I feel I am too old for you, but Brody here should be your daddy just fine.”<br />
<br />
“I sure will!” Brody boomed and grabbed Ronnie by his waist, squeezing him tight against his massive body. Ronnie reacted accordingly and placed his head onto Brody’s pillow-like pec shelf.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Andy and Sabrina are…</p>
