<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The swirling, churning sensation surrounding her eventually came to a halt. Jennifer’s legs felt a little uneasy for a moment, but when she regained her balance she was able to take in her surroundings. Her surroundings seemed normal enough, all of her regular furniture and posters and things were still the same. The room she and her belongings were in however seemed… different. It was as if the room itself were twice as big, but not the things inside?<br />
<br />
It wasn’t just the room itself that had changed, but the posters were all different too. Where there should have been her favorite boy bands and pop idols, the posters suddenly depicted… the people in the pictures were… Jennifer felt her lungs weigh heavily in her chest, falling over backwards as her eyes were glued to the images like she was witnessing a nasty car crash.<br />
<br />
Everyone in her posters were outrageously fat! Impossibly fat! Too fat for a person to functionally be called a person. Each figure had to at least weigh a ton… and the sheer size of their bodies… rolling, flabby stomachs that had to be as big as a car… butts as wide as a house… faces that looked like they had three chins at least… and yet… Somehow, some impossible how, none of them seemed to be struggling to move. None of them seemed to have trouble striking the sexy poses that they used to do when they were skinny. Nothing that big should be able to do things like this. It was almost cartoonish!<br />
<br />
Almost in a panic, Jennifer patted herself down. Her own body was completely untouched and unchanged. She was still as lithe and skinny as she always was. She couldn’t have weighed much more than a hundred pounds. Relief rushed out past her lips as she stood back up, but still trembling with disbelief about her changed posters.<br />
<br />
“So is this,” Jennifer asked herself, “Is this what that Kyle kid meant when he said I would feel out of place? Does that mean… am I the only skinny person on Earth right now?” Somehow that realization made the poor cheerleader feel so frail, like a little china doll surrounded by elephants.<br />
<br />
“There’s… there’s gotta be some catch here, right?” she feverishly pondered as she staggered towards her closet. The door was so tall, and it was about as wide as a minivan. Jenny had to reach above her head to grab the doorknob and swing the door open. Her clothes at least were still normal sized, but they all looked distinctly custom tailored, as if specifically catered to her figure. Dwelling on that detail would probably stress her out more so she decided to stop overthinking it and just get dressed. Luckily she found her spare cheer uniforms and quickly got the missing pieces on. She steeled herself for what she might encounter on the other side of her double sized bedroom door as she prepared to leave her room.<br />
<br />
Just as she might have guessed, the hallway seemed twice as big as usual, consistent with how big everything else around her has gotten. Of course that wasn’t the only thing that caught Jenny’s attention, as the powerful smell of gone-off eggs assailed her nostrils. A stench so strong she could almost taste it! She reflexively clasped her hands over her nose and mouth, trying hard not to gag on the air in the hall. She could hear the sound of a giant version of her house’s front door opening in the distance. If memory served, that sound would mean that her mother Carol had gotten back from her early morning jog before work. A cold sweat drenched her face as she realized she would be forced to confront her mother like this… that her mother would be as fat as the people in her posters.<br />
<br />
“Rip the bandaid off, rip the bandaid off,” Jenny ordered herself as she forced her legs to carry her into the living room. She could barely bring herself to look at her own mother, but she decided that delaying the inevitable would do her no good. She went to the living room to find her mother pawing at her face with a bath towel. God, the woman had to be at least ten feet tall now, and possibly ten feet wide by that measure. Carol Smith had suddenly become a practical sphere of lard somehow stuffed into a baby blue tracksuit. A tracksuit that did very little in the ways of covering up her completely exposed flabby stomach that pooled on the floor beneath her. Her arms were swaddled in a pair of cellulite dappled mattresses that wobbled furiously with every movement she made. She pulled a drenched sweat band away from her forehead as she let it land with a splatter on the hardwood floors, and chugged an entire gallon of water in what seemed like an instant. Unbidden, she belted out a huge burp and dropped the empty plastic jug to the ground.<br />
<br />
“Jennifer?” the ham planet she suddenly had for a woman noticed her, “What are you still doing here, sweetie? Are you running late for school today?”<br />
<br />
“I- uh… uhh…,” Jennifer scrambled, “Y-yep! That’s me! Running weight-I mean late… for class this morning. Had a hard time finding my unifat-FORM! My uniform. Had to get my spares out from the closet. Did you uh… did you have a good jog?”<br />
<br />
“Are you doing alright, honey ham?” Carol asked, “You seem a bit out of sorts this morning. Maybe you didn’t get enough sleep last night? Ooh, I know just the thing that might help! I’m gonna make breakfast for you.”<br />
<br />
“Ohhhh no,” Jenny went pale, “that’s alright. I uh… I was up late last night uhh… studying! Yeah, and-“<br />
<br />
“Oh all the more reason you should eat something!” Carol insisted as she waddled down to the kitchen at an amazing speed for someone of her girth, “After all, it might be because you’re always so malnourished compared to everyone else! I mean look at you, you poor thing, barely six feet tall and only just over a hundred pounds? You realize how much you worry your mother being that small?! If you weighed like seven hundred, or hell even six hundred if we’re pushing it, I might be fine with it, but this! You’re going to get squashed like an ant one day if you insist on being so malnourished.”<br />
<br />
“Mal… malnourished?” Jennifer seemed ready to faint.<br />
<br />
“But don’t you worry about that,” he mother continued, “I’ll be able to bring you back up to at least half a ton before you graduate, you wait and see. You’re not going anywhere until you’re stuffed like a turkey, you got that?”<br />
<br />
“L-like a… like a turkey?” Jennifer weakly slurred.<br />
<br />
“And then some,” Carol nodded as she turned on the stovetop burner, “How do triple chocolate pancakes with bacon and eggs sound?” Before her daughter could answer, Carol’s massive behind exploded with a room shaking fart, noticeably tinting the room green and filling the room with a horrendous eggy stench. Jenny could smell it through her fingers, and the air felt thick in her mouth.<br />
<br />
“Ugh! No eggs, please!” Jenny cried, tears in her eyes from the stench, “Not after that!”<br />
<br />
“And that’s another thing,” Carol carried on, “You don’t fart as much as anyone else! It makes me worried about your digestive health, dear! Seriously, who isn’t letting one rip every other minute?! Just sit tight and I’ll get you fed, don’t you worry! Did you want anything instead of eggs?”<br />
<br />
“How about a salad?” Jennifer hazarded to ask.<br />
<br />
“I think I could whip up a gallon or two of salad,” Carol hummed. Jenny guessed that she wouldn’t be able to negotiate her way out of an over abundance of food and simply said that sounded good. She had a feeling that she was not going to get out of this with her waistline intact.</p>
