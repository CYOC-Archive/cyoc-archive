<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">THEN (the story so far)- Trying to forget the complications and worries of modern living that you decide to take a walk. After you walk for a while now that you decide to go down a street you&#39;ve never been down before. Surprisingly enough as you find what seems to be an old park surrounded by a tall stone wall that you pass by the moss-covered stones for you soon wonder how you could have never known about this park before.<br />
<br />
You know the park had to have been there for a long while because the trees look to be fairly well-grown that It seemed like a nice shady place full of trees, perfect for the children in your neighborhood to play in. still though, you don&#39;t hear any sounds of people coming from the park that You walk in front of the ordinate steel gates and slip inside. Once inside, you find yourself on a shady path with sunlight gently falling from the boughs of the trees to form roundish little shapes that blanket the ground like autumn leaves.<br />
<br />
The sound of wind chimes can be heard in the distance, the sound cascading through the park like the light through the trees. You continue to walk along the main path for a while and come to what seems to be a divergence of paths that You ponder on it, but for a moment as you choose a path to follow. Calliope music calls faintly on the breeze as you walk along the path marked with brightly coloured posters proclaiming &quot;CARNAVALE&quot; with an arrow pointing down the path.<br />
<br />
The music grows louder, yet you emerge from a thicket in front of some ratty old wagons and tents as The wagons were once brightly coloured that they were now faded for their paint was peeling. The tent is an odd shade of grey, with many odd patches from various garments and patterns. The calliope plays unattended for The whole carnival seems deserted, except for a few cage animals that you decided to do dome exploring as the first stop to check out was The first booth<br />
<br />
you noticed a string of unused tickets dangles out the window, each is labelled &quot;one ticket&quot;. you help yourself to a few dozen as you then proceed through the rickety old turnstile that The first tent has a display of cotton candy and brightly coloured sign proclaiming &quot;1 Ticket&quot;, yet the next booth equally unattended has hot pretzels for it still smelled fresh as the Popcorn was the booth next to it. You consider eating on what they had, but you decided to check out the rides first for You didn&#39;t want to get yourself sick after words.<br />
<br />
looking out at the various games, rides and shows marked on the map at the entrance to the Midway that The rides are: The Changing Room, The Haunted House, The Lovers Luge, Grimmer Fairy Tales, Wolf Hunt, Pig In A Poke, House Of Mirrors, The Petting Zoo, Topsy-Turvy, and The Merry-Go-Round while The Shows were: The Amazing Ape Man, Safari Sam and His Trained Cats, Victor The Man With The Cast Iron Stomach, The Bearded Women, The Magnificent Merlin, The Lilliputians, The Flea Circus, Trixie&#39;s Trained Dogs, Bruno the Dancing Bear, Snake Charmer, Svengali the Hypnotist, and Madame Fortuna as The games seemed to be: You Bet Your Life, Ring Toss, Test Your Strength, Milk Can Fill Contest, Pony Up (Miniature Horse Racing), Wheel of Chance, and Greased Pig Chase. Craving for entertainment and intrigued that You decided to go by the names, you head after the sign marked &quot;Shows&quot;.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of walking around is when you finally find yourself with a number of other people on a dirt path as it was surrounded by colorful large tents that The tents all have large, colorful signs with the names you saw before on the map written on them. you also notice that below each of the signs on the tents has a smaller sign saying &quot;Audience Volunteers Wanted&quot; or other things to that effect. Now this definitely sounds like fun for You always liked interactive shows, even if you didn&#39;t volunteer that it&#39;ll be fun seeing someone else go up.<br />
<br />
hearing the Noise from the other patrons talking and the barkers shouting out for those patrons to step right up to their show, along with the occasional animal sound from the tents like ponies, dogs, and such that it fills your ears. you decided to step into the tent while expecting to see the Snake Charmer playing a flute to some random snakes, but you end up somewhat shocked while also surprised to see no one was inside. No audience member, not even a member of the staff as You end up scratching the top of your head in confusion.<br />
<br />
wondering why would no one be in here for There wasn&#39;t even a single person, let alone snakes inside the tent that all there was in here were empty wooden basket. as This ended up annoying you that you started to turn away and exit the tent, but something was stopping you when you heard something. &quot;That sound... That wonderful sound... It&#39;s so sweet... So hypnotizing...&quot;<br />
<br />
as You turn back to the inside of the tent that when you look back, you could now see someone playing a flute while being shone by one of the circus lights for the snakes were popping out to hear its tone. you were just in this tent a moment ago as You were sure they weren&#39;t there before, but now seeing the bins full of cobras, boas, and a few over kinds of snakes that they seem to be dancing to the sound of the flute while the snake charmer was just sitting there for the charmer too was in a rhythm of the dance. it was like they were in a trance that you felt like dancing with them too as you stayed a bit longer to hear whatever tune he was playing with his flute for it was so soothing, so wonderful, so majestic.<br />
<br />
It was like nothing you&#39;ve ever experienced of hearing before that You had to listen to more of the charmer&#39;s music for it was getting good, even better than what you were used on listening to as You start to noticed the other snakes in each of their bins enjoying the music too for the experience was getting better and better each note tune he played on his flute. while you continue to enjoy listening the sound the charmer was playing that you fail notice what&#39;s happening to your lower half of your body as it was stretching a bit, your pants and underwear slipped off and hit the ground for Your toes begin to move in. your toes were soon the same length of small stumps with narrow points at the ends that They were seeping out of your shoes, but this somehow didn&#39;t seem to phase you in the slightest for You seem to have more dexterity with them as you seem to have replaced your feet for two pairs of flexible tails.<br />
<br />
it wasn&#39;t long for it was shortly after when your legs and tipped feet began to merge into one long tail while being covered in scales, but You were too busy listening to the charmer&#39;s music that you couldn&#39;t care less about yourself anymore right now as your lower half of your body was changing and becoming more snake-like. wait, snake-like? didn&#39;t you come in here with two legs?<br />
<br />
shaking you head a bit to clear and straiten your thoughts that for a moment, you stop listening to his music. it was then that you then turn to see something. what was it?<br />
<br />
NOW (back to the story at hand)- The inside of the tent in which where you are stand seemed bigger than when you first stepped in that You had been intrigued by “The Snake Charmer” sign out front, but to find the tent Manonly unoccupied. Now, the tune from snake charmer&#39;s flute you were just listening to was majestic while also hypnotizing as your mind feels blissed out and hazy. you were almost in deep enough to hear some more, but as you turn that you notice there was a few bins while finding them to be stacked and empty.<br />
<br />
although you haven’t been to the gym recently that you were pretty good at sports as a kid, even soccer. you stumbled a bit as you stub your big tail on the dirt floor for you weren&#39;t used to slithering with your lower body half that The twinge of pain shoots through your scaley self, while it suddenly brings you down from your hypnotic trance. why do you feel so clumsy, let alone with no pants on?<br />
<br />
Looking down at yourself  for a moment that you register for the first time as you&#39;re not only half naked, but your entire lower half of your body was transformed. You gasp as you flex your newly long reptilian tail that it had slipped out of your shoes while listening to the tune of the flute while you were examining the empty woven basket bins, even your briefs. Wincing that you try to move it back into alignment with your serpent like tail, but succeed in only curling your tail into a grasping ball as it was like a fist while thinking something was very wrong here.<br />
<br />
the sweat were breaking out on your body as you began to feel it tingling that the sensation begins to travel underneath your serpent tail from the pins and needles while trying to take a step towards the door for you even yell for help, but find out you’ve lost all sense of your balance and fell to the ground with a big thud. you were Suddenly scared as you were confused for you then grasp the metal bar of the ladder that was kneeling on the empty bins and started to climb up to get your new sense of balance while realizing you’re sweating profusely all over, even your clamy palm hands. The tingling feeling that started in your lower body begins to work it’s way upward, spreading all the way up to your hips for you shortly feel your manhood and rear begin to tickle as the changes keep coming.<br />
<br />
“Fuck!” you said as you now feel a bit constricted that your whole lower body was strangely heating up. Pitching forward as You urgently try to get yourself back up with the help of the ladder, fear clamps your heart that you soon realize something was happening internally too for you quickly hear your stomach gurgling at you for something to eat while wondering what they had in here for food.<br />
<br />
once up that you quickly decided one thing to do with yourself in a time of need right now, you were thinking of sticking your lower reptilian half into one of the empty woven bins they had here. strangely as you were careful about it that the more of your tail went in, the more comfortable it felt while the snake charmer was soon playing a different tune with its flute. You always admired guys with musical instruments they all had, but this was almost to much for even for you to handle that this was the most musical guy you ever know.<br />
<br />
you catch yourself from falling in to deep in the woven wooden bin you were sinking in as you didn&#39;t want to fall on the ground, with yourself in the basket. slowly though, You fall backward into a sitting position that your bare ass was now on your serpent like tail for it was bent and touching each other. soon the flute of the snake charmer slowed down the tune as the other snakes were sipping back into their wooden baskets, while gently closing each of the bin that you were somehow still dancing to the charmer&#39;s flute tune.<br />
<br />
little by little as A new tingle begins in your crotch, you somehow know that your cock was transforming for Your balls began were ache too while getting a strange feeling of your cock reshaping. you couldn&#39;t tell yet exactly what was happening down there as Your cock head was feeling warm all of a suddenly that it felt like it were enveloped in an entirely new skin, involuntarily getting hard while your cock stiffens. you become aware that all of your struggles have been pointless as you feel your body changing against your will for you’re powerless to stop it, thinking Maybe the best thing to do was to enjoy what’s happening here while this new perspective overtakes your mind.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck, not there!” you said while feeling the changes of your manhood as You feel a twinge deep inside you at the level of your hips that So far your changes have been external, except the bones of the lower half of your body for the scales were thinner toward your crotch. slowly Grabbing your belly with one hand as your hips were swaying, you gently begin to move your hand downwards and towards your groin area that you soon come across to a small split hole which goes vertically while also feeling around for your balls beneath your still scaley half of your body for you soon got increasingly turned on and excited when the touch to what was once your inner thighs spread with a tingling feeling.<br />
<br />
it started to feel uncomfortable when you realized that your balls were nowhere near to be found at all, but somehow were still there as your hard cock was continuing to stir for it felt like you meaty stick was splitting in two while finding out why when it shortly squirmed its way out of your groin area and from under your newly scaley hide. what came out surprised you for your cock wasn&#39;t just tapering while losing the mushroom head shape itself, but there were now two of them as they&#39;re now also the palest part of you now is when you reached down to feel your inexplicably hard cocks that you quickly wrapped your pinky and ring fingers around the right cock for the middle and the index fingers were wrapped around the left cock underneath when the thumb itself was wrapped around both of them on top. stroking them as if you were groping at your crotch while feeling like you were out of town with them, you were soon hit for the first time by the stink which suddenly wafts up from your entire body when you smelled like a men’s locker room that was never cleaned and it was doubling to a long-haul truck stop!<br />
<br />
&#39;ah man! I look pretty good. Hey, maybe . . . No! I can’t get distracted now! How am I going to get out of here? more importantly, What will people think when they see me looking like this with a snake&#39;s tail? a Freak??&quot; you think as Your eyes wander back toward the snake charmer, playing the flute.<br />
<br />
wait a minute, the flute! Maybe there’s a clue about it to change you back. Maybe . . . . if One music note tune sets off the changes, then maybe there&#39;s another tune that will reverse this? well, It’s worth a try as the flute soon after stopped playing.</p>
