<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robert sat on the couch wondering what to do next, when it hit him.  It seemed so obvious he couldn't believe that he hadn't realized it earlier.  If the wish he made had transformed him into a pure-blood then it would have to find a source for the information and seeing how thinking about ideas that came to his mind didn't work (He had already put the 'pup' idea on the list before his dad called him that),  he decided it had to be the list.<br />
  He went to the table where he had left it to begin with and erased one of the characteristics that he would be able to tell if it went away but nothing happened.  He decided that he should try adding something to it but what.  <br />
  He thought about when he and the others were in their wolf forms.  They would need a way to communicate and scent, posture, and what sounds they would be able to would probably take some getting used to and besides if they used sounds, it would alert other animals to the fact that they were there.  He decided to put down that when in their wolf forms they could communicate short distance by telepathic messages &amp; keep the howling &amp; other noises for when they were a little farther off.  He made sure to make it so that the telepathic messages had to be sent out by the one saying it just to keep the privacy of the mind intact.<br />
  He wouldn't know if it worked until later but for now he had other things he wanted to try.  Since he was a pure-blood, he should be able to transform at will &amp; he decided that he should probably try it out in the backyard with all the wooded land.<br />
  He pressed redial on the house phone so that he could get back with the last person he had called about the wish, Margaret.  He told her to meet him at the tall oak tree in the middle of the wildlife park.  It was already late so no one would be there except them and it would be perfect timing.<br />
  He got out of the house, took off his clothes and started to focus, he didn't just want to transform into a wolf he wanted it to be gradual, and to control what part transformed when.<br />
  He started with the tail, he felt a sharp pulling as it grew to full length almost instantaneously.  He wanted to see if he could control it so he tested it.  It wagged just as he wanted it to and he continued with the transformation.<br />
  He refocused his attention as he could feel his ears grow pointed and fangs replaced his canines.  His nails sharpened into long, thick claws which could probably cut through a deer's hide with ease, even more so than regular wolf claws would.  His ears continued to reshape moving to the top of his head as they triangulated and curved out in the back.  His nose started to push out with an oddly comforting push against his skin matched by the sensation of stretching bones and muscles as the faint sight of a muzzle came into view.<br />
  The fur had swept across his body so evenly throughout the transformation that he hadn't even noticed until he looked down to see his feet lengthen and his body rise up onto the balls of his feet.  The feel of walking on his toes rather than his heels was odd at first but he realized that it was actually no harder than balancing on his heel.<br />
  After a minute he dropped to all fours on his own accord in order to not be caught off guard when it actually forced him to the ground.  His chest barrelled out as his neck and torso became longer.  He could feel that the movement of his arms were now hindered and while his hands which for now still had thumbs could grab something if he needed it, he would definitely not be able to move them as far as he used to.<br />
  The final changes occured as his fingers became stubby and his thumb almost disappeared entirely into his wrist.  His former forearm which had earlier gained an extra joint flexxed as he got used to moving it.<br />
  He stood there for a moment just to get a good view of himself wihth his head and realized by the surroundings in comparison to his body that he was bigger than the average grey wolf, which he now looked like.<br />
  He took off in a sprint to get to the park.  He was running much faster than he ever had as a human and probably faster than an average wolf could as well.  The ground felt good under his feet (paws) as he almost lost himself in the sensation of running through the woods.</p>
