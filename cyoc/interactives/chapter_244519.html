<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">7 hours passed & Adam checked on the ball python snake. He saw the snake trying to get his attention. Adam walked over & pulled out the snake & placed it on his bed. The ball python stretched out on the bed  & the snake opened its mouth going into a sort of trance as the popping & other noises started as it began to transform. Four knots formed on the snake&#39;s body & soon began growing longer & bigger. The snake was also growing in size. Adam watched as the growing knots began forming into arms & legs. Soon what could be toes & fingers were forming too. The snake&#39;s head started changing filling out some & the snout crunching slowly back shrinking. Soon the tail began shrinking too. The snake&#39;s snout crunched back into a face Adam knew; Lance&#39;s face. The ball python snake Lance finished shifting taking on a mostly human shape. He still had a tail; mostly an almost foot long. He had no ears only earholes. His nose was still nostrils only on his very slight snout. He had 3 fingers & a thumb all the same length. 4 equal sized toes. A slit on his groin. No body hair or nails. His skin was still scales but flesh colored but with no bellybutton or nipples. And his pupils were slitted but his eyes were blue again. Lance spoke panting ajusting himself revealing small shape teeth &quot;I...think...I ....need to...test...&quot; Adam remarked that he wasn&#39;t fully human yet. Lance fell over passing out. 5 hours later...<br />
Adam was in the kitchen about to make something when Lance entered the room still naked & still as he was before he passed out. &quot;Still like that hun?&quot; Adam commented. Lance getting angry yelled &quot;I can&#39;t change fully to human! This is as far as I can get!&quot; Adam went to say something but Lance groaned in pain with a pop as his skin flashed python pattern for a few seconds but went back to flesh colors. &quot;Lance what is happening?&quot; Adam asked worried. Lance braced himself on the kitchen counter with his hands as another pop & now a crunch occurred causing him pain. <br />
POP and his tail grew some. &quot;I told you...&quot; CRUNCH. &quot;...I... never...ah...&quot; CRUNCH and his face pushed out some. &quot;Lance what is happening to you?&quot; Adam asked more worried now as another POP occurred. Lance flipped around as another CRUNCH occurred & causing him to push back against the counter & his skin went python pattern but didn&#39;t revert back this time. &quot;Went...too. far...&quot; Lance groaned in pain with POPPING as as his toes shrank away & stumbled forward & landed on the floor on his hands & knees. Lance groaned again in pain with a POP as his toes completely vanished as his feet deformed some. CRUNCH and POP as his chest filled out some & he said in much pain &quot;... Struggling...to...hold this...&quot; CRUNCH as his legs shrank some. &quot;...for.m...and los...ing..&quot; POP as his fingers & thumbs started to shrink. &quot;...Going...back...ah...&quot; POP as his legs shrank even more. &quot;Back to a full python snake?&quot; Adam asked finally getting it as Lance nodded with another CRUNCH as his face pushed out some. Adam got down on his knees before Lance & told touching the side of his head &quot;Down try to hold this form anymore. Just let yourself change.&quot; Lance stopped resisting & let it happen. Lance went into a trance & his went totally reptilian & he began hanging his mouth open slightly & he continued transforming. Again Adam watched as Lance transformed into a ball python. And again the snake had to rest so he put the python into his cage to rest. <br />
2 months passed...<br />
The ball python snake slithered into the bedroom & up onto the bed where Adam was playing a video game. The python curled up & then reared up. Python began panting as popping & crunching began as it began growing in size & began growing arms & hands & shoulders & it&#39;s snout started shrinking. Soon it was over leaving a ball python naga- like creature. &quot;You getting better it seems Lance.&quot; Adam commented. Lance nodded &quot;Sure am.&quot; Thought Lance still couldn&#39;t shift fully to human yet he could get close; thought exhausting. Or just as has now shift a bit. Adam went to hand Lance a controller when Lance over to him & over top of him. He looked Adam in the eyes & Adam questioned &quot;Again?&quot; Lance nodded. Adam undid his pants. Lance then pulled them off & his underwear leaving Adam naked. Lance &quot;You know you love it.&quot; Then arms & hands began shrinking away to nothing as his shoulders collapsed & his face fully pushed back out to full. Adam again let the ball python fully into his mind calling the snake within him. Adam felt his inner snake coming forth again & he began transforming as his eyes went totally reptilian & his privates sucked into a newly formed slit & then start changing inside him & he started shrinking as well as the python. <br />
Lance had weeks ago figured out another power of his python snake fruit. He discovered some people had snakes in them & he could pull them out transforming them into that snake. Allthough after 9 hours they would revert back to what they were before. <br />
Turns out Adam&#39;s inner snake just happened to be a ball python too; a female one. A female python. <br />
Now Adam was fully transformed yet again into a female ball python. She looked at Lance the male ball python. She loved being a female python. And she was Lance&#39;s mate in this form.<br />
The End. Maybe.</p>
