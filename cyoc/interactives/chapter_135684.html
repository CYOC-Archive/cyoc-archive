<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taylor went back towards her bedroom where she found her husband fast asleep. His smell which she found rather confronting earlier today was now very comforting as she slit next to him under the sheets. The thought of helping herself to Jason&#39;s pride and joy entered her head for a second but was quickly lost as sleep took her over. As Taylor fell fast asleep she became dreaming of her new found hobby of &#39;helping&#39; other people achieve the same freedom she recently shared with her daughter.<br />
<br />
As Jason woke up he found his wife still sleeping next to him, somehow she smelled amazing to him and his equine genitals stood to full action. Still under the impression that he had managed to withhold the truth about his condition from his wife Jason headed to the shower to get some relieve. Jason was impatient to get back to work on the farm that day, or rather said he was impatient to get back to his horse. He made his way to the shower with his head in the clouds daydreaming about the wonders that awaited him, and he entered the cabinet turning on the water.<br />
<br />
When Taylor woke up she saw that her husband had already left bed and was welcomed by the trickling sound of water falling in the shower. With dazed eyes Taylor stretched her arms and yawned inhaling the air she noticed that the room had a really distinctive smells hanging in it &quot;Wow it really reeks in here, I better open a window&quot; she sided smiling  happily. Hearing some low grunting coming from the bathroom it was obvious that someone was having a good time. Her black lips moistened ad the thought of Jason pressuring himself but she knew that this was not the time to get distracted. Taylor made some coffee and sat down ad the dining table as she thought about how she could best share her new gift with the world. Taylor was not dumb and came up with a few necessary conditions for her plan to work. She needed to spread her fluids to others and she could not be caught doing it less she got in trouble. Taylor finally decided upon a plan of action and gathered a small bottle and some injection needles from her medicine cabinet. After that was done she decided to check upon her daughter.<br />
<br />
Sydney woke up on the ground of the barn floor her back ached from the uncomfortable position she had been in and her clothes where dirty and smelling. She was barely awake when she bearded the door of the barn open and saw headed her mother calling for her. &quot;Sydney are you still in there? Do you know how late it is? You need to get ready for school&quot;. Looking up ad the old clock hanging in the barn Sydney saw that her mother was right, the school bus would arrive very soon and she still needed the shower, get clothed, grab her bag and eat. Even tough she was ashamed her mother had found her in the barn like that  Sydney was overcome with a newfound sense of urgency and quickly passed her mother who stood ad the barn door sipping her coffee. &quot;huh, thanks mom.&quot; was all she managed to say with a dumb look on her face as she slipped past her mother trying conceal the state of her clothes to her mother cheeks burning red.<br />
<br />
Jason had barely unlocked the door of the bathroom when his daughter practically pushed him out of the room leaving him with only a towel to cover himself, she had passed him so quickly that he barely registered the smell she was emitting. Normally Jason would have called out his daughters rude behavior but was now only counting his blessings that she had not noticed anything weird about him. His penis had retracted into his sheath and was neatly covered by the towel and he smelled far less of horse as he had just showered. Jason went and got his clothes on his shirt fit just as good as always but he had some trouble putting on his pants needing to pull them up quite significantly in order to get the over his sheath making a pretty obvious bulge, he wondered how he would manage if he really did become a full stallion.<br />
<br />
Taylor reenters their house and saw Jason ad the dinner table eating breakfast. She walked up to him and slightly brushed her hand against his bulge when she kissed him causing a slight twitch in Jason&#39;s crouch. Being caught of guard by his wife&#39;s assertiveness Jason&#39;s ass puckered in reflex, he returned the kiss.  <br />
&quot;Had a good sleep honey?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes actually and I believe today will be very interesting&quot;<br />
Jason laughter slightly ad that choice of words. &quot;Yea I&#39;m also looking forward to it&quot;.<br />
The pair had just stared small talk when a noise filled the air &quot;honk honk&quot;. Sydney&#39;s bus had arrived.<br />
<br />
Sydney was just done getting dressed having put on a nice looting skirt which hid a excellent job of hiding her large cameltoe as her panty was sucked in by her large vagina. When she heard  the familiar sound of the bus Sydney practically flew grabbing her bag as she passed her mother and father. &quot;byay mom, byay dad I&#39;m of to school&quot;. As Sydney entered the school bus she got a slightly annoyed look by the driver &quot;next time your late I&#39;m leaving without you&quot;. &quot;Soiree-ah&quot; catching herself braying slightly she quickly left the driver and left to her seat. She felt the eyes of the other students on her hearing them whisper about her teeth. Had she always had such a upper bite? Sydney run her tongue across the front teeth and they did feel a bit larger. But that had to be the power of suggestion right? She thought as she said down next to her best friend and the buss started driving.<br />
<br />
Back ad the house Jason was also just leaving for &#39;work&#39;. He kissed his wife one more time and left the house. Taylor was finally alone, she grabbed the stuff she prepared and her car keys. Taylor entered her car and started the engines. Her black lips getting a message from the trilling of the chair making her pants and chair slight wet and her ass puckered up. She was going to have a great day indeed.</p>
