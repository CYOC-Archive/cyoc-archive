<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter stared back at his reflection. He had put on a pig nose and ear, not a tail! The little pink curl wiggled back and forth and- Wait, did his slacks have a tail hole in them? <br />
<br />
“What the actual hell,” Peter stared at his reflection. His grip on his cocktail glass was starting to slip.<br />
<br />
Tiny quickly plucked the drink from his hand. He juggled the two glasses and awkwardly pointed up the staircase, “Let’s not make a scene. Come on.”<br />
<br />
Peter reflexively followed after Tiny. The entire time his fingers were exploring the tail behind him. This- This was impossible! People didn’t just grow tails!<br />
<br />
Tiny tried a couple doors before finding one that was unlocked, “This one’s free, hurry up Peter.”<br />
<br />
The upstairs room was what Peter had been expecting earlier. It was a classy mansion guest bedroom that had clearly been set up with one purpose in mind. There was a bed, a dresser, a small sofa with a coffee table, and very few decorations that could be knocked over or stained. Piled up on the dresser were a few extra sets of linens.<br />
<br />
Tiny moved to set their drinks down on the dresser. He stopped, looking at the hard wood. Without thinking too hard about it, he quickly pulled out a pair of paper coasters from his back pocket and set the drinks down.<br />
<br />
“Okay, so-“ Tiny turned around, only to find the room empty.<br />
<br />
A squeal came from the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Tiny poked his head in the bathroom and watched Peter lean over the sink.<br />
<br />
Peter was staring into the mirror. The reflection staring back at him made absolutely no sense. He kept poking and prodding his cheeks with his fingers, watching as the flat pig nose on his face twitch and contort in response. There was absolutely no trace of the elastic string anywhere. He finally reached up and tweaked the nose. It… wouldn’t come off! It had substance to it! Even felt damp on the end! The nose moved along with the rest of his shocked facial expressions.<br />
<br />
“Oink! I’m a pig!” he let out another squeal. They both got to watch as his flappy ears perked up expressively. He moved his hands up, giving them both an experimental tug. Oink! They were firmly attached to his head. There was naturally no trace of a headband to be found.<br />
<br />
“I tried to tell you,” Tiny stood in the doorway, “This masquerade’s special.”<br />
<br />
“Special my ass! This is unbelievable!” People don’t just-“ Peter turned to his companion and stopped talking.<br />
<br />
Tiny’s head was completely that of a wolf. The brown fur on his mask had crept all over his face and was starting to replace his darker brown hair. He had a wet black nose, a muzzle full of pointy teeth, and a long panting tongue. His ears twitched softly, swiveling to focus on Peter.<br />
<br />
“People do here. Somehow,” he gave a toothy grin, “Do you want to stop freaking out and come watch?”<br />
<br />
“Watch…?” Peter blinked, looking up into Tiny’s piecing yellow canine eyes.<br />
<br />
“This isn’t stopping at my neck,” Tiny pulled his shirt collar down to show Peter that the fur had already started creeping down to his chest, “I’m turning into a wolf man. Do you want to watch?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh… Sure?” Peter nodded bashfully.<br />
<br />
“Come on then,” Tiny leaned down and gentle took Peter’s hand again. He sat Peter down on the foot of the bed and handed him his drink back, “Just relax, okay?”<br />
<br />
Peter nodded took a sip from his gin and tonic. The glass bumped up against one of the two small tusks that were starting to push out of his bottom lip.<br />
<br />
“So… did you come here with someone?” Tiny rubbed his head, getting a feel for where the fur head spread to. “Most of the time we give people a cryptic warning about really getting into character or something.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I umm… I’m my friend’s plus one,” Peter reached up to feel his lips.<br />
<br />
“Woof, we really need to stop doing that,” Tiny chuckled. He started to unbutton his shirt, but then stopped, “Do you mind?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh, go for it,” Peter nodded.<br />
<br />
It dawned on him why Tiny might have first approached him. The two were wearing pretty similar outfits. Peter was wearing a polo shirt on and khakis, while Tiny was wearing a polo shirt and some nice jeans. They definitely stood out compared to the people who came dressed to the nines tonight.<br />
<br />
Tiny grabbed on to the back of his shirt and started to pull it over his head. Polo shirts weren’t really made with wolf ears or a muzzle in mind, so it wasn’t exactly the smoothest operation. The wolf man started to let out a frustrated growl when the shirt got caught on the chin of his muzzle.<br />
<br />
Peter sat up straight. That was a real growl. He adjusted his pants a bit, watching Tiny fully remove his shirt.<br />
<br />
“Ruff, that’s better,” Tiny barked, tossing the garment casually onto the floor. His fur had already crept down over his shoulders. Now what he knew to look for, Peter could see the claws on Tiny’s fingers getting bigger.<br />
<br />
Tiny was fit, but by no means a body builder. He had the gut that one would expect from someone who worked around an ample supply of alcohol. His chest and stomach were surprisingly hairy, but it was hard to tell of that was just the early stages of fur.<br />
<br />
“Oink, so… Do you do this a lot?” The sound of Peter’s voice surprised him. He had a habit of snorting whenever he inhaled.<br />
<br />
“I started last Halloween. It’s easier to bring in new people around this time of year,” Tiny ran his hands down his chest, watching the fur spread, “We do these quarterly, so this is my fifth time with a tail.”<br />
<br />
“So we- Oink! We change back?” Peter’s eyes lit up.<br />
<br />
“Arf! Oh, of course! Sorry, I should have lead with that!” Tiny gave a very unusual canine laugh, “We all turn back at the end of the night.”<br />
<br />
“Oh good…!” Peter anxiously rubbed his ear, “I thought I was going to be stuck like a pig forever.”<br />
<br />
“You make a good pig,” Tiny licked his chops, “But no, you’re just stuck in character for the rest of the night.”<br />
<br />
“Character?” Peter echoed. “Oh! Ha, sorry, I was getting a bit into it. I’m Peter.”<br />
<br />
Tiny flexed his shoulders, shaking his arms out as the fur crept over his hands. He smirked, watching Peter’s expression grow increasingly bewildered.<br />
<br />
“Wait, err, I mean- I’m Peter?” He blinked, scratching the back of his head, “Sorry, I meant to say…”<br />
<br />
“You’re Peter. At least for tonight,” Tiny reaches down and playfully tapped Peter’s snout.<br />
<br />
“Oink!” Peter went cross-eyed. His face started to go increasingly flush, “Seriously, I uh, I can’t remember my name.”<br />
<br />
“Just roll with it Pigsty,” Tiny wagged. The wolf wiggled his paws, starting to unbutton his pants.<br />
<br />
Peter rubbed one of his floppy ears anxiously. He genuinely couldn’t remember any name for himself other than Peter Pigsty…! What was going on!? What was-<br />
<br />
What was Tiny doing?<br />
<br />
Oh man, the wolf was still undressing. His new paws looked a little clumsy, but he managed to get his belt undone and his pants unbuttoned. Peter felt his tail wag behind him as he watched the impromptu strip tease.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow, you’re going to keep going?” Peter snorted. He shifted in his seat, adjusting his pants again.<br />
<br />
“I get a kick out of this too,” Tiny started to push his blue jeans down, “It’s not every night you get to turn into a wolf. I’m just glad you’re enjoying this as much as I am.”<br />
<br />
“Oink! What makes you think- Sorry, I didn’t mean to stare…!” Peter looked down at the bed sheets self consciously. Then he awkwardly licked his jowls to feel his new tusks with his tongue.<br />
<br />
“Arf? It’s okay!” Tiny grinned and tapped his wet black nose, “I’m just saying… You haven’t noticed how much better your sense of smell is?”<br />
<br />
“Oink?” Peter sat up, giving the room a deep sniff.<br />
<br />
He was immediately hit with the scent of his own excitement. (And maybe some of the cheese crumbs from earlier.) Moments later, Peter picked up on the scent of a horny wolf. The smell of musk and excitement filled the air. The door did a good job of blocking off the rest of the smells from the party, but Peter could vaguely pick up on the scent of alcohol and frivolity.<br />
<br />
“Oink! This is incredible…!” Peter sniffed the air a few more times with his blunt nose. A thought bubbled up to the top of his mind, “How has no one ever done an exposé on this party before?”<br />
<br />
“Stop thinking like a journo for a second and just enjoy yourself piggy. These changes don’t last long,” Tiny wagged. He leaned forward, tapping something in Peter’s shirt pocket with a grin.<br />
<br />
Peter felt the rattle of a few pens. Oink? He didn’t even have a shirt pocket, did he…?<br />
<br />
He down reached into his pocket and pulled out a pair of pens and a small leather notebook embossed with the Chronicle’s logo on it.<br />
<br />
“Holy hell, are you seeing this?” Peter waved the book in the air.<br />
<br />
“Arf?” Tiny barked curiously. He was a little distracted, doing his best to kick off his shoes and socks. Peter could already see claws starting to form on the tip of his toes. The wolf man leaned in, “You said Peter Pigsty was a newspaper reporter. No surprise you carry around a notebook.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah but- I’m not <i>actually</i> a journalist! I-“ Peter started again.<br />
<br />
“You are for tonight,” Tiny laughed, “You’re even thinking like one. Trust me, I’m sure I’ve got keys to my bar in my pockets.”<br />
<br />
He reached into his pockets with a scruffy paw and fished out a keychain with a beer-cap keychain. Judging from the toothy grin on his muzzle, this was apparently a new key for Tiny. Oink! Man, something about that smile made Peter’s porcine race every time he saw it. Tiny had this exciting mix of charm and wildness about him. He shoved the keys back in his pocket and slowly started to squirm out of his pants.<br />
<br />
This was… actually really hot. Tiny had looped his thumbs over the waistband and was clearly putting some effort into teasing Peter. His legs were shifting right before their eyes. They went from hairy, to furry, to sporting a full fur coat in a matter of moments.<br />
<br />
It was a little hard for Peter to just enjoy the show. His mind was reeling. “This is absurd! Pig guys and wolf men exist! How has no one tried gathering proof of magic!?” he snorted.<br />
<br />
It’e not like he could just scribble down some notes about someone’s wolf mask transforming them! He’d need hard proof! He needed- Oink! Right! Duh! Everyone carried cameras with them these days! Pigsty reached into his pocket and fished out his phone.<br />
<br />
He was a bit too flustered to notice the hoof caps on the tips of his fingers. The facial recognition on his phone didn’t complain as he pulled up his camera feature.<br />
<br />
“Oink! I need to document this!” he snorted.<br />
<br />
Standing there in his viewfinder was a human in a tented pair of boxers. A hairy one for sure, but lacking any particularly canine features. No wolf head. No wolf tail. Just a smile on his face and a barely obscured erection behind his underwear.<br />
<br />
Peter felt his cock get hard as his finger slipped and pressed the shutter button.<br />
<br />
“Proof might be a little harder to gather than you thought,” Tiny grinned, gently nudging his boxers down, “You better delete that picture later.”<br />
<br />
The wolf shot him a playful wink. Peter had expected a perked cock between his legs, but instead Tiny had a scruffy wolf sheath. The tip of a glistening red tapered wolf cock was poking up out of the top.<br />
<br />
Peter grinned, taking another picture. The human in the frame had a startled look on his face and a perked boner.<br />
<br />
“If you’re going to do a strip tease for me, you better be prepared for the consequences,” he teased.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Tiny lunged for the camera.<br />
<br />
Peter scooted back further onto the bed, “I’ll delete it, I’ll delete it.”<br />
<br />
“You better,” Tiny play-growled, “Can’t have that getting back to my staff.”<br />
<br />
Peter flopped onto a pillow. His pants visibly tightened when Tiny started to growl. It was clear that Tiny wasn’t actually trying to get the phone from Peter. His figure framed the bed, and the half a foot the pig had slid back wouldn’t have made an ounce of difference.<br />
<br />
The two looked at each other. The scent of excitement in the room was starting to become overwhelming.<br />
<br />
“So… you’re not freaking out anymore?” Tiny paused, standing there naked at the foot of the bed.<br />
<br />
Peter nodded, rubbing his nose self consciously, “Uh huh. I think I’m good.”<br />
<br />
“Would you like to go back to the party?” Tiny glanced at the door. He wagged his tail eagerly and looked down at Peter, “Or we could umm… You know.”</p>
