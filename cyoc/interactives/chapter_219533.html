<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back at her new home; Rachael felt worn down from the day’s excursions. While it wasn’t time for the evening meal and the sun for hell was still up in the sky; Rachael was just emotionally exhausted. Noticing the bags and boxes from the shopping trip, Rachael forces herself to open them up just to put the garments away. Garments being a generous word; for in hell, clothing is akin to jewellery to humans. With the realm always being hot, what little clothing worn is usually light thin and very loose. For Rachael, the support cups held together by thin bands of fabric would be something that one expects from a lingerie or sex store on earth. The garment design to support her breasts from the bottom; they ensure that her blue areolas and nipples are visible and on full display.<br />
<br />
Selecting the one that was made from a fabric that has a slight shimmer; Rachael perks up when putting it on.<br />
“It fits perfectly,” Rachael smiling as she examines herself in the mirror. Lightly chuckling as the Tattoo she got earlier decided to mimic her pose. The gorgon tattoo smashing her fun bags together as it tries to strut like a runway model all up and down Rachael’s arm. Turning around to see another bag from the same store, she opens it and scowls.<br />
“I don’t remember getting this,” Rachael looking disgusted as she pull the translucent fabric out.<br />
It was similar to the peach skirt the Maisy wanted her to try. Rachael complaining that it was too tight and it hid her very intimate bits.<br />
<br />
Rachael was about to toss it when Maisy, entered the dressing room with a couple glasses of wine.<br />
“Are you going to model for me,” Maisy smiling at her lover.<br />
“Not with this,” Rachael shaking the garment; “Thing. Ugh,” Rachael wanting to toss it.<br />
“You need more than just a support cup and jewelry when dealing with issues of court,” Maisy sipping her wine; “It’s a necessary evil.”<br />
“I thought demons were supposed to be confident with their bodies,” Rachael turning back to the mirror to admire her blue scales on her new alabaster white skin. Her long whip like tail thrashing in delighted approval.<br />
“And we are,” Maisy standing next to Rachael; her purple skin transitioning in to the furry hind legs of a deer. Her tail twitching as she cupped her breasts and lightly played with her nipples. “But some decorum must be maintained when in court;” Maisy taking the skirt and helping Rachael putting it on, “Think of it as a work uniform.”<br />
<br />
Maisy steps back as Rachael sighs. Looking at herself again now with the short skirt. It still just barely covered her entrance, but what soften her opinion of the garment was the same shimmer it had with her support cup. Turning and moving about; both garments changed color while still maintaining that ethereal sparkle.<br />
“I suppose I can suffer wearing this while on the job,” Rachael conceding defeat before unclasping the concealed fasteners allowing both articles to fall to the floor; “But the second the job is done they come off.”<br />
Maisy lightly chuckles as a now totally naked Rachael takes the wine that was waiting for her and downs it in one gulp. Feeling a stirring in her loins; Maisy was thinking of taking Rachael for another girl on girl romp in their bed, when a loud ear piercing scream brought her out of her daydream.<br />
“What in the hell,” Rachael trying to find the source of the sound; “what the fuck was that?”<br />
“The door bell,” Maisy putting down her wine; “we have a visitor.”<br />
<br />
*************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Following Maisy as they head out of their private chambers and proceed to the receiving area; both make it as far as their living room when a human servant approaches the two. <br />
“We have a Jeeves,” Rachael eyeing the snooty looking butler holding a letter in his hands.<br />
“Message for you mistress,” The man answering stiffly; “it came from a court courier.”<br />
Maisy takes it without acknowledging the butler as he quickly slinks away. Rachael sees Maisy&#39;s eyes widen as she quickly reads.<br />
“Beelzebub was assassinated,” Maisy chortling; “It says Cruciata Carronfly is the assassin. All members of the court are ordered to attend a special trial tomorrow morning by order of my father Lucifer Morningstar and Negral head of the secret police.”<br />
Rachael grabs the note only to see it was written in a language she could not understand; looking at Maisy as she heads to the nearby couch and flops down on it. “It’s in demon script,” Maisy answering Rachael’s question before she could ask; “All official court documents and communications are in that language.”<br />
Rachael looks at it again and then notices the letters and symbols change to that of English. “It’s now in English,” Rachael looking up; “I can now read it! How is that possible?”<br />
“You’re a demon,” Maisy sighing; “all demons understand our script. You’ll also find in time,” Maisy getting up; “That you’ll soon be able to understand every human language. But that is for another day,” Maisy getting up; “Let us go back to the dressing room. I want to see you model the rest of those clothes of yours,” Maisy forcing a smile as she ponders some lingering feelings she may have for Cruciata.<br />
<br />
Getting back to the dressing room, Maisy and Rachael noticed Shadow lying on a nearby chair licking himself.<br />
“Oh Shadow,” Rachael approaching the hell cat; “I completely forgot about you.”<br />
“The rest of our stuff should also be here as well,” Maisy giving the black cat some skritches behind his ear; “we can go through it all later to decide what stays and what gets incinerated.” Maisy pouring herself another glass of wine and sitting in a chair next to shadow; “right now let’s see your best runway strut as you model your new clothes.”<br />
<br />
**********************************************************************************<br />
<br />
A few hours later just as it was becoming supper time; Rachael and Maisy leave the dressing room, at the same time, the butler can be seen approaching them.<br />
“Dinner time mistress,” again the butler being stiff as he promptly leaves the two demons.<br />
“What is his deal,” Rachael looking at Maisy; “what did he do to wind up in hell?”<br />
“He killed a six year old girl in a preventable car accident,” Maisy answering as they head to the dining room; “both he and his employer were drunk from some benefit event in Liverpool England. Only he wasn’t supposed to be drinking while on the job. From what I gathered,” Maisy continuing; “he had a drinking problem and was hiding it well from his employer.”<br />
“And honest to goodness English butler,” Rachael laughing; “Guess his demons caught up with him.” Rachael snorting at the pun; “So how long is his sentence here?”<br />
“Five Thousand Years,” Maisy answering; “as it was ruled an accident and only he and the girl died, he got off lucky. But part of his punishment,” Maisy looking at Rachael with a menacing smile; “is he gets a hundred years added to his sentence for every drop of liquor he drinks while in hell.”<br />
<br />
Rachael chuckles at that last caveat as the two arrive at their private dining room to eat. Seeing at this is hell; a place of torment and punishment; it made sense to punish and alcoholic or a drug addict with the very items that brought them down her to begin with.<br />
“As I stated earlier,” Maisy examining the roast meat dinner on her plate; “Wrath, murder and attacks on children are dealt with harshly.”<br />
“But the rest are viewed as harmless vices,” Rachael remembering the scene she witness with the human who was actively spreading the HIV virus, thus giving those individuals an inevitable death sentence.<br />
“Yes, but when those harmless vices inadvertently take someone else’s life; Maisy cutting into the roast and taking a bite; “All bets are off.”<br />
“What about suicide,” Rachael also tucking into the roast with; “is there special treatment given, like you father does with the dictators and mass murderers?”<br />
“You know the bible makes mention of a lake of fire here in hell,” Maisy sipping her wine; “while that part is true, that part that isn’t, is all dammed souls suffering in a lake of fire. That is reserved for those who purposely kill themselves.”<br />
“An irredeemable act,” Rachael commenting; “i guess even in hell, all life is a precious gift.”<br />
“And to throw it away,” Maisy nodding; “is an affront that even my Father, Lucifer finds offensive.”<br />
“I have one more question,” Rachael looking at Maisy; “does Hell get Netflix? Because I&#39;m in the mood for some on demand tv.”</p>
