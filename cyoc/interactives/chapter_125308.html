<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The dinner proved quite good and the conversation did ultimately turn away from the suspicions over Tom&#39;s work as a reporter, which came much to Tom&#39;s relief. It was something that he&#39;d been nervous on, as he knew that had he continued in the way he&#39;d been investigating Lionel Ulysses&#39; arrest and the tail that he was seen to have that he might have ended up revealing were society in a way that wouldn&#39;t have made it easy by any means to do well, at least in the short term. That sort of thing was bound to be something that he figured that every were would have concerns on, as it would represent fears that they had. Given some of the ways movies and folklore tended to portray weres, Tom figured it was a reasonable fear to have.<br />
<br />
But he managed to get through the first meeting with Alice&#39;s parents without major trouble or ending up becoming embroiled in a political debate, which felt glad for. He loved Alice and wanted very much to have her parent&#39;s approval before he married her, as he didn&#39;t want there to be any disapproval or hard feelings that might force Alice to have to choose between him and her family. It would break her heart to have to make that choice, and that that didn&#39;t have to happen, Tom was greatly pleased.<br />
<br />
Instead, they continued on with polite small talk that ranged from movies to books and other things that Tom might have interest. Some of it also referenced questions on events of Tom&#39;s past outside of his work in the press. This included Tom admitting that he&#39;d actually been married before, but that also included the added admission that the marriage didn&#39;t end well and that Tom felt a much stronger bond to Alice than he had to his previous wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s likely the presence of the bond to Alice,&quot; Lucy said with a smile, &quot;for us werefoxes... it&#39;s an assurance that we know we&#39;ve found the one we&#39;re supposed to be with for life. And that bond will drive your instincts to look for ways to make Alice happy and will drive hers to make you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then we&#39;ll be happy together,&quot; Alice smiled to Tom before leaning up to kiss his cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s a great sensation,&quot; Tom smiled to Alice, &quot;but... do you know why it&#39;s limited to only werefoxes? I mean... scientifically speaking, most canids show strong bonds between males and females. While the death of one may lead to the other seeking a new mate, while both are alive, they&#39;re pretty dedicated to each other. It&#39;s not like felines where the male plays no real role in the rearing of offspring... Not even male lions really do that much with regard to raising children.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy and Harold Stevens traded glances and both ultimately shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s something that&#39;s just special to werefoxes, I suppose,&quot; Lucy spoke, &quot;Just about every were group has something that marks them as unique among weres. For werefoxes, it&#39;s our strong and unbreakable bonds once they form... and our instinctive knowledge on how to sexually please our partners. For werecats, it&#39;s that they&#39;re all female and at least bisexual if not homosexual... and the for werewildcats it&#39;s that they&#39;re all male and at least bisexual. Every were species has something that makes them special.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Tom commented. A lot of that left him very curious about things, as he was new to were society and hadn&#39;t grown up with it the way Alice and her parents had. In time he did hope to learn more.<br />
<br />
Both Lucy and Harold soon nodded. Meanwhile, Alice checked to her watch and noted the time. It wasn&#39;t super late, but it was late enough that they would need to return to Seattle and their own apartment. Tom had his work at the paper and he would be returning to his regular investigative reporting and she had her work with her costume shop. Now, she&#39;d actually just gone through the busiest part of her year as people got ready for Halloween, and unlike bigger chains like &quot;Party City&quot; which changed their stock to be able to serve to every sort of party for any season, but that didn&#39;t mean she was without work to do. She&#39;d have to keep track of her stock and make sure the shop was clean and remain alert in case someone did come in. Sometimes there were people who costume parties outside of Halloween and there were a surprisingly large amount of parents who through birthday parties for children in which they bought a costume to let them &quot;pretend&quot; to be their child&#39;s favorite TV character. In a good year, Alice did great just before Halloween to cover her for the entire year and what she made during the rest of the year was her &quot;profit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would seem you&#39;ve found quite an intelligent young man, Alice, dear,&quot; Lucy then smiled to Alice, &quot;you&#39;re certain he&#39;s done well by you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So far,&quot; Alice assured her mother, &quot;the bond is there and is strong. Tom has made me the happiest woman on Earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Than I wish you both the best of luck,&quot; Lucy smiled, &quot;in whatever you do. Don&#39;t forget to visit us from time to time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom and Alice both nodded. By this time, Alice stood up from the couch in the living room where they&#39;d sitting. She then looked down to Tom before she spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will... but for the moment, it&#39;s time that we got going as we&#39;ll both have work tomorrow,&quot; Alice spoke, leading to Tom soon nodding in recognition on the fact that tomorrow was Monday and the way his work would resume. This included the big reveal which would require some time and effort to get things cleared and ready for it. His ultimate plan was that while he would essentially expose weres, he wouldn&#39;t expose Moon Lake as a were sanctuary. That way if something bad came at him or Alice, Alice could be sent to safety and he&#39;d give his life for her safety. But that would all take time and he did wish to go through some coordination with Moon Lake so that they understood the position that they faced.<br />
<br />
Alice moved first and hugged her mother and then her father before moving back to head toward the door. Tom followed and shook hands with both Lucy and then Harold. As he shook hands with Alice&#39;s father, he managed a weak smile before speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to speak with your City Council and government before moving things forward,&quot; Tom spoke, &quot;show where the plusses are and the value in doing so. And so that everyone understands the reasons and the opportunities for it... Prevent anyone from feeling betrayed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It may take a little while to get such a special meeting arranged,&quot; Harold Stevens answered, &quot;but I have Alice&#39;s cellphone number, I&#39;m sure we can keep in touch on when that would be. I would expect by the end of the coming week though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold soon looked between his future in-laws with a bit of nervousness. Eventually Lucy raised one finger and then walked out through a door that lead to their kitchen. She returned shortly after with a small slip of paper and a pencil. She handed it to Tom and he eventually rested the paper on his leg and carefully wrote out his own cellphone number.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my number,&quot; Tom said to Harold, &quot;That should give you some chance of contacting me directly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could help,&quot; Harold nodded though did give a firm look to Tom, &quot;Though be warned... Moon Lake has thrived as a were sanctuary for years and while the Normals in Moon Lake are aware of us and are pretty much habituated to us, that doesn&#39;t mean that the people of Moon Lake, be they Were or Normal are going to respond well to Moon Lake&#39;s secrets being exposed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If things work out right... it&#39;d only be the existence of weres,&quot; Tom answered, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have any reference to any sort of sanctuary, thus if there is a negative reaction... Moon Lake won&#39;t be touched. If there is a more positive reaction, it&#39;d open up the doors for taking things to the next logical step. And Alice won&#39;t be in the shot... It&#39;d only be me. That way if anything bad happens... it won&#39;t be directly on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see that you&#39;re thinking of her,&quot; Harold spoke, &quot;but even still... old fears run deep. And Moon Lake may not take to even just the revelation that weres exist well... You&#39;ll really need a GOOD reason for this reveal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom nodded. He felt he had a good reason for it and was more than prepared for that personally. Everything advanced and things WOULD have to change. They couldn&#39;t just rely on secrecy forever, even if there were legitimate fears. Because a bad revelation that related to some sort of crime or accidental discovery would be more likely to bring down the worst. A reveal where weres were in control could show the good they could do and were.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll also need to keep in mind that while Moon Lake is a were sanctuary... it isn&#39;t the ONLY place weres live,&quot; Harold finished, &quot;we know that weres live outside Moon Lake... some are even Moon Lake natives who&#39;ve gone out for adventure or some other excitement This could well mean that there are weres living in countries that may not have the same opportunities that those in America have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be all the more reason to do it when we have control over it,&quot; Tom answered, &quot;but that&#39;s something I&#39;ll save for this meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... again, it may take a little while to get that arranged,&quot; Harold spoke, &quot;right now I&#39;d say the best shot will be this Friday... It&#39;ll all depend on how the proposition for such a meeting goes. I&#39;ll let you know on what is decided and when it can be scheduled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom nodded, &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again they shook hands. As they did so, Harold gripped Tom&#39;s firmly and then pulled him into a hug that caught Tom by surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember to put Alice first,&quot; Harold spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Tom answered, &quot;My hope is that this all comes out well... and the world may know how wonderful she is.&quot;</p>
