<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lillian noticed that the boys, also naked, as fit with their new forms, both had fierce erections as they watched, but she had to stop things here.  Once Lillian was naked, Erika moved in for a kiss, but found a hand blocking her mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.  You&#39;re sexy, but I have a boyfriend.  I&#39;ll at least have to ask his permission.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erika backed off, but from the look in her eye, Lillian knew she might try again later.  Lillian watched her alignment rise by 5 points.<br />
<br />
Soon they met with the rab-bat man, and added him to their party.  He was a DPS Fighter but with an ability called Blood Bath that let him restore HP when he killed an opponent.  He led them along a dirt path to the mad scientist&#39;s castle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here it is.&quot; he said as they approached the dark and foreboding structure.  &quot;Beware of the madman&#39;s creations.  I am far from the worst thing his twisted mind has produced.&quot;  Butt chittered nervously from his perch on Lillian&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
They stepped over the threshold into the courtyard, and the first monster appeared and hissed as it bared its fangs.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Lv. 4 Mutant Viper<br />
HP: 15/15<br />
MP: 0/0<br />
Element: Poison, Fire<br />
Information: Attempting to create a hydra, the mad scientist&#39;s early attempts lead to these multi-headed snakes.  Weak defense, but beware their particularly virulent poison, which burns up the veins as it travels through the body.<br />
:::<br />
<br />
A fire element?  It would resist her fireball then.  That meant it was time to try out the new spell she&#39;d picked up before meeting with her party today: Water Stream.  It had cost her most of her savings, but she knew that being a one-trick-pony in the wild was an easy way to get killed.<br />
<br />
Venom dripped from the Viper&#39;s fangs and onto the ground, where it sizzled as if boiling.<br />
<br />
Before it could leap at Miles she fired her spell. A high pressure burst of water shot forth. It did damage, but the damn thing was at useless old level 1, and unlike her fireball it didn&#39;t get a boost from her Hell Affinity.  Before she could fire again it struck at Miles, who normally would have blocked with his shield but could not do so as a were-bear.  He&#39;d essentially traded his defense rating for HP, which turned out to be a poor choice if they were up against poison.  Luckily, Erika leaped in and impaled the snake on her spear.<br />
<br />
Then there was a rustling all around them, and *seven* vipers appeared.  This might be trouble.  But then the rab-bat man roared and charged!  He didn&#39;t hesitate as he took a bite on the arm, dispatching the viper with a mighty blow from his paw.  Lillian watched as his Blood Bath ability healed the damage, his body actually absorbing the snake&#39;s blood through his skin.  That sure was a useful ability.<br />
<br />
At Miles&#39;s orders they charged the opening he had made, dispatching another snake with a water stream and a blow from Venrie&#39;s mace.  That let them turn around and present a united front to the rest of the snakes, but it seemed to be unnecessary; The rab-bat man was mowing through them with ease.  He was clearly an excellent berserker.<br />
<br />
After the battle though, they had to cure his poison with a potion.  &quot;Try to be more careful,&quot; said Miles, &quot;We don&#39;t have a lot of potions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will try, but I cannot always control myself.&quot; said the rab-bat man as he chewed on viper-skin.<br />
<br />
They fought their way through a menagerie of horrors, from hybrids and mutants to zombies and cyborgs with human brains that begged or their own destruction.  There were things Lillian couldn&#39;t even describe.  Many of the things were screaming in constant pain even before they showed up.  The worst was probably the Dead Threads.  They were some sort of really long worm with needle-like heads that would stitch together parts of other creatures by using their bodies like thread.  Then they&#39;d reanimate the hodgepodge Frankenstein monsters, forcing the party to fight many battles twice.  It was only fortunate that they were weak to fire.<br />
<br />
Eventually Lillian noticed a debuff had appeared in everyone&#39;s information window:<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Horror:  The mental fatigue of the constant twisted screams and of facing horrible abominations has begun to wear on you.  -1 to Will and Reflex saves.  Will grow worse over time.<br />
:::<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to hurry.&quot;  she said.  &quot;We can&#39;t keep this up forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others nodded.  &quot;We&#39;re getting close though.&quot; said Miles.<br />
<br />
&quot;By Ellnesis, Onwards!&quot;  shouted Erika, activating her once a day party buff.  It more than made up for Horror, but it would only last an hour.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the Rab-bat man screamed at the top of his lungs.  &quot;DO YOU HEAR US, LEONARDO?  WE&#39;RE COMING FOR YOU.  REVENGE WILL BE MINE.&quot;<br />
<br />
Welp, there went any element of surprise.  They wondered if this guy was worth it or not.<br />
<br />
At last they came upon a great door.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is it,&quot; said the rab-bat man, &quot;His inner sanctum, his laboratory where he makes all of his monsters.  He is likely inside.  Prepare yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the doors opened and two hulking minotaur creatures emerged.  They were missing bits of flesh, allowing bone and muscle and even brain to be seen.  Undead, probably...but the bones looked to be made of metal?  Well, if these were his final guards, they looked tough, but not too tough. They could do this!<br />
<br />
Then the beasts erupted in flame, and electricity began to arc between their horns. Oh.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Lv. 10 Mutant Cyborg Helltaur<br />
HP: 400/400<br />
MP: 200/200<br />
Element: Fire, Darkness, Blood, Lightning<br />
<br />
Information: -<br />
:::<br />
<br />
But before Lillian could read it, a cackling voice emerged from behind them.   &quot;Behold my masterpiece!  My genius has done the impossible: I&#39;ve mixed FOUR elements in one.  You die here, Merek.  It was the mad scientist.  He looked every bit the part, from the frizzled white hair to the slight hump in his crooked back to the crazed look in his eyes that never seemed to quite focus on anything before darting to something else.  He even wore a white lab coat, which struck Lillian as odd for the medieval setting of this game.<br />
<br />
The rab-bat man, Merek, charged with a blinding speed.  He flew right between the Helltaurs and into the scientist&#39;s chamber.  &quot;You&#39;re mine, Leonardo!&quot; He screamed as he shut the doors behind him.  The Helltaurs banged on the great doors, but they were reinforced with magic and steel, and didn&#39;t budge.<br />
<br />
Roaring in anger, they turned on the party.  Lovely.<br />
<br />
First they launched an AoE electricity attack, lightning arcing forth from between their horns.  It was too fast and too wide, undodgeable, and they all took damage.  Venrie went to work healing as Lillian and Butt started cranking out Water Streams, which, thank god, had leveled up by now.  Then they charged with blood lust roars.  Erika dodged and slashed, but she seemed to be doing little damage. Miles in his were-bear form seemed capable of tanking and trading blows, but barely, and his skin was singed by their fiery touch.  Worse yet, their blood element powers were allowing them to increase their attack strength whenever they did damage.<br />
<br />
They couldn&#39;t last at this rate.  They had to pull out all the stops.  Venrie used his once a day super spell:  Arkenos&#39;s Wrath.  It paralyzed one of them...for 30 seconds.  But at the fight dragged on it became clear that even that wouldn&#39;t save them.  By the time the 20 seconds had passed the other Helltaur showed no signs of falling.  It seemed to have some sort of regeneration that was slowly restoring it&#39;s HP.  Once its twin got back into the fight, it would be impossible.  Miles tried to order a retreat but the beast was too fast.<br />
<br />
Lillian knew she had no choice.  She had to use Succubus Transformation.  Even Charm wasn&#39;t an option since the beasts would no doubt rape her to death. The safe useage cooldown still hadn&#39;t passed though.  She didn&#39;t know what kind of side effects she might have to deal with, and didn&#39;t know how her party would react to her true nature, but at this point it was that or die.  She only hoped that even that could save them.<br />
<br />
She was preparing to trigger it, when suddenly the beast stopped! A deep, painful moan bubbled up from the depths of its belly, and then it exploded!  Blood and guts covered the party, and then the other one exploded as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fucking hell?&quot;  shouted Erika as she wiped gore from her face.  The whole party had a Mental Fatigue debuff now.  Venrie was keeping their bodies in shape, but their minds were reaching the limit.<br />
<br />
Then they looked to the doorway.  It was open, and a strange man stood there.   &quot;At last I am free,&quot; he said, &quot;At last I am me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Merek?  Is that you?&quot;  asked Miles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is me.&quot; he said.  He held something in his hands.  He raised it aloft.  It was some sort of small glistening black pyramid with a spherical red jewel in its base.  &quot;The Eye of Allmund.  Isn&#39;t it beautiful?  He was using it to control the helltaurs, and I used it to destroy them, and to restore myself.  Who knew the crazy old man had THIS.&quot;  The body of the scientist was on the ground behind Merek.  It looked like he&#39;d been strangled while having an eye eaten out.  Blood covered Merek&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Butt began to chitter and sqwuak loudly.  He obviously didn&#39;t like the Eye.  It gave Lillian a bad feeling too, but the others all stared in wonder at it&#39;s beauty.  It did indeed seem to glisten more than any jewelry <br />
she&#39;d ever seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, exactly?&quot;  asked Venrie.<br />
<br />
&quot;An artifact created by the ancient Demon King Allmund, centuries ago.  Allmund craved knowledge as a path to power, so he tore out his own eye and worked magic upon it, turning it into a device that could see through dimensions, through time, and more.&quot;  He looked up at them, but he never quite looked at any one of them, his eyes instead darting around like...like the scientist.  &quot;And now it&#39;s mine!&quot; he said.  &quot;Get out. All of you.  If I see you again I&#39;ll kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I don&#39;t think so!&quot; said Miles.  &quot;What about our reward? Why do you get the magic artifact and we get nothing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I say so, fool.  This is your last warning.  Leave or I unleash the full power of the Eye upon you.&quot;  He held the Eye up to his own eye now, as if he could peer through it at them.  When he did, he started laughing.  &quot;A game?  It&#39;s all just a game? HahahaHAHAHAHA!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Merek, this isn&#39;t you.&quot; said Lillian.  &quot;The Eye must be controlling you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t me?&quot;  cackled Merek as he looked at her through the Eye.  &quot;Well I guess you WOULD be an expert on not being you, wouldn&#39;t you, Alex?  Though you&#39;ve become quite the monster now, haven&#39;t you?  Yes...I think I&#39;ll show them all your true colors.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of the party looked at her.  &quot;What&#39;s he talking about Lillian?&quot; asked Erika, but before she could respond, she was wracked with pain. As she doubled over the transfiguration potion effects were dispelled, removing the illusory succubus appearance, but as she realized that this pain was familiar, she knew she&#39;d look like a succubus again soon.  It was the same pain in her soul, mixed with rage and hatred and lust, that her succubus transformation came with.  She tried to resist, but there was no stopping it, and soon wings and horns sprouted as her eyes turned red and her figure became curvier, more seductive.  <br />
<br />
:::<br />
Warning: Unsafe Succubus Transformation Activated.  Alignment erosion will occur at double pace.  High risk of losing self to lust.  Prolonged useage may destroy human soul and cause full transformation to a true succubus.<br />
:::<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooooo!&quot;  she cried.  Butt chirped in confusion and concern for his mistress&#39;s pain.<br />
Miles charged, but when Merek looked at him through the Eye he reverted from the were-bear form, leaving him just a naked shield user without a shield.  Merek raised a hand and blasted him with a powerful ball of dark energy.  Miles slammed into a wall and went limp.  The others raised their weapons, wary to approach now.<br />
<br />
Lillian was panting on the ground.  The lust...the lust was too much.  It took all she had not to charm Venrie and suck out his soul as he fucked her.  Her pussy ached to be filled, and her repressed human side was barely strong enough for her to care about Venrie&#39;s life. But she could hear her human side, quietly screaming in pain and fear.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?  Still human enough to resist, eh?&quot;  said Merek.  &quot;Let&#39;s fix that shall we?&quot;  He looked at her again through the Eye.  As Erika prepared to attack him his raised a finger and waggled it at her.  &quot;un-uh.  You&#39;ve got bigger problems to worry about now.&quot;  He pointed behind her.<br />
<br />
Lillian was on her feet.  Her horns were longer, her wings bigger, and her body all the more seductive. She licked her lips as she looked at the others.  She&#39;d eat all of them, even Merek.  He&#39;d been a fool to awaken her like this.  Even the Eye wouldn&#39;t protect him, though she&#39;d save him for last.  First she had to deal with Erika, though.  She couldn&#39;t Charm Erika.<br />
<br />
She looked at her new stats.  Apparently the Eye had forced her into Succubus Transformation lv 2.  That transformation put Charm, Aurra Sense, and Soul Drain temporarily at level 3.  Illusion and Water Stream reached level 5, and Fireball reached level 6.  This apparently granted her new upgraded versions of those skills.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Mega Fireball lv 1:  A bigger, stronger fireball that cost more MP.  When the basic fireball receives XP, so does Mega Fireball.<br />
<br />
Battle Illusion lv 1:  May now cast illusions mid-battle.  Uses the skill level of the bases Illusion spell to determine effectiveness<br />
<br />
Super Waterstream lv 1: A bigger, stronger Water Stream that cost more MP.  When the basic Water Stream receives XP, so does Mega Water Stream.<br />
:::<br />
<br />
She&#39;d also gained another skill:<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Succubus Claws lv 1:  While in Succubus Transformation lv 2, you gain +5 to strength in unarmed melee damage.<br />
:::<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Lillian?  What&#39;s happening to you?&quot;  asked Erika.<br />
<br />
Lillian grinned an evil grin, and raised her newly clawed hands.  The claws were a glistening purple.  She cast two spells at once.  A giant fireball hurtled towards Erika, at the same time as two illusory fireballs.  Erika couldn&#39;t dodge them all, and didn&#39;t know that 2 of them were fake.  The Paladin tried a defensive spell, and the fireball crashed into a magical barrier...and broke through.  She didn&#39;t take the full force of it, but Erika was still knocked to the ground, crying out in pain from her burns.  Venrie rushed to heal her, but suddenly ropes of dark energy bound his arms to his body.  A binding spell from Merek.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies only in this fight, Venrie.&quot; said Merek.  &quot;I&#39;m sure miss Lillian will have time for you afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
She would indeed.  The idea of leaving him uncharmed and riding him while he was bound suddenly sounded appealing.  It wasn&#39;t going to be much of a fight against Erika, though.  Lillian was too powerful now.  Erika struggled to her feet.<br />
<br />
  Butt only looked on in confusion.  He thought these people were mistress&#39;s friends?  Why was she attacking them now?  He didn&#39;t know what to do.<br />
<br />
But then they heard a great, horrible groaning.  They looked around for the source.  It was coming from the remnants of the two Helltaurs.  They all looked closer, and even Merek paled at what was transpiring before their eyes.  A Dead Thread had dragged Leonardo&#39;s head over to the two corpses, and was knitting them together!  <br />
<br />
In panic, everyone attacked.  Mega Fireball and holy light and dark energy all crashed onto the corpses, in hopes of destroying them before they could reanimate.  <br />
<br />
It was too late.  The creature rose to it&#39;s feet.  It had a crooked centaur-like build, with 4 legs and 4 arms, but the worst part was the three heads.  The old mad scientist&#39;s head cackled with glee as the two ox heads grunted.  &quot;Yes!  now I AM perfection.  Oh I truly underestimated the genius of my Dead Threads.  Now I am an immortal!  Now you all die!&quot;</p>
