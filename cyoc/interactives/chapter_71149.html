<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly the morning wore on and as it did, Sandy tried to force himself to think of the young woman he was chatting with as lesser beings and not equals. But as he attempted more and more to force himself to think like this, he quickly discovered himself unable to do so as the more he found himself being drawn into their conversations.<br />
<br />
Unaware that he had stopped thinking of himself by his male name, his mind on how he'd love to teach these girls something, he was caught off guard when Pamela stood and announced, &quot;Well. I've got to get to classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Realising that he had other places to be, but unable to recall where, Sandy also stood and replied, &quot;And I've got a few errands to run,&quot; as the others present also stood and commented they to had classes to get to, that it had been fun and thanked Sandy for coming.<br />
<br />
As the sorority girls left, Pamela lingered for a moment and when all but a couple young women remained, she grasped Sandy and gently hugged him. Sandy, who returned the hug without giving it a second thought, feeling it was something natural to do, listened as Pamela told him, &quot;If you ever change your mind about college, and apply for here, you've got a good shot at being chosen for Chi Theta Upsilon,&quot; and releasing Sandy, she turned, and left the room, calling out to a couple young woman already heading up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Watching as young woman left, Sandy found himself torn between a flood of emotions. After a moment, he thought, &quot;She's just a lesser being, meant to controlled by the stronger sex,&quot; and heading out of the room and towards the front door, he paused.<br />
<br />
As he stood in front of the door out, Sandy suddenly thought about how he'd just been hugged by a young woman he would have gladly liked to teach a thing or two to. Than he thought about how normal it had felt to be hugged by Pamela, &quot;Almost as if it was something I would actually do and am comfortable with,&quot; he muttered, realising how close, secure, intimate and a whole host of other emotions he had felt at Pamela's touch. Confused at what he was feeling, Sandy idly crossed his arms over his<br />
<br />
Suddenly aware of something, Sandy realised that something about the way the tank top was rubbing against his skin felt strange. And than he realised that he'd felt the same thing when Pamela had hugged him. Uncrossing his arms, Sandy quickly looked about to make sure he was alone. Seeing nobody, he quickly dipped his hand down the front of the tank top and gently cupped the right artificial breast that had been applied the previous evening. Immediately he snatched his hand away and for a moment, he just stared at it, sure that what he was feeling was in his hand, not under his shirt.<br />
<br />
But as the tank top shifted and brushed against what he was sure was a pair of artificial breasts, he gasped out. Putting his hand back down the front, Sandy once again cupped the right breast and after a moment, shifted his hand and slowly began making a gentle rubbing motion against the nipple with his forefinger and thumb.<br />
<br />
As he suddenly felt an explosion of feelings, unsure how it was he was feeling them, Sandy shifted her hand and cupping the right breasts, she slowly began to massage them, alternating between using her hand and her fingers. Suddenly realising what he was doing, Sandy gasped out and stopped as he understood that part of what he was feeling was arousal. Glancing about, feeling suddenly ridiculous, Sandy wrenched open the door, glanced about and began hurriedly walking away. As he did this, Sandy thought that one of the things he'd felt was a sort of tingly sensation, almost like being on a roller coaster that suddenly dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is the matter with me?&quot; he asked himself and deciding that he needed to find Tanya and get back to his actual like and put all of this behind him, Sandy glanced about, choose a direction and started to walk, sure he was going in the right direction.<br />
----<br />
<br />
Hours later Sandy reached into his purse, unaware that at some point it had just appeared in his hand, and taking out the keys for his apartment, he let himself in. Dropping his purse and keys on a table next to the door, Sandy sighed in disappointment at how he'd not been able to find Tanya or were she lived. Flopping down on the couch, he drew his legs up and settled them into position. Staring off into space, he asked himself, &quot;What the hell is happening to me,&quot; as his mind drifted to how soft the his tank top felt, brushing gently against his nipples and breasts.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;I am not a girl. Girls are the lesser half of the species. I am of the dominant half. The male half,&quot; and standing, Sandy glanced down at what he was wearing and thought, &quot;I shouldn't even be wearing this stuff or have gone out into public dressed like a worthless girl,&quot; and deciding he wanted to get changed, he headed for his bedroom.<br />
<br />
When he reached the room, he gasped at how feminine everything looked and muttering, &quot;I'll prove that I am not a girl,&quot; he hastily kicked off his sandals and began to remove the capris, boxers and tank top.<br />
<br />
Naked, he flopped down on the bed, liking how soft the light purple sheets felt against his body. Shaking his head, telling himself, &quot;Think like the man you are,&quot; Sandy forced himself to start thinking about naked woman, forced into submission. As he did so, he reached down and began to play with his tiny penis, desperately trying to stimulate it to become hard.<br />
<br />
Unable to get himself sexually excited Sandy stopped after about twenty minutes and for a moment just lay on the bed, thinking. After a moment he decided that what he really needed was to clear his head and standing, he walked to the window and reaching through the curtains opened it. Liking the breeze playing against his body, Sandy just stood there for a moment, enjoying what he was feeling. Turning away from the window after a couple seconds, Sandy walked across the room and picking up a scented candle, he lit the wick and returned it to where he'd found it.<br />
<br />
The smell of the candle, combining with the soft breeze, relaxed Sandy and lying back down on the bed, he turned onto his side and stared off into space. Shifting back to laying on his back, he gazed up at the ceiling, letting his mind wander as he enjoyed the scent of the candle, the cool breeze and the soft sheets. Running a hand over his skin, Sandy allowed a soft moan to escape past his lips and bringing his legs so that the heels of his feet were pressed against his rump and his feet pressed firmly into the bed, Sandy traced a hand down passed his useless male genitals and between his legs. There, he began to run a finger idly across the flesh between his legs, the amorous sensation he was feeling growing.<br />
<br />
Gasping out, &quot;NO!&quot; realising what he was doing, Sandy leapt up off the bed and stared wildly about.<br />
<br />
As he gazed about the room, breathing heavily, still trying to come to terms that he had almost started masturbating like a girl would, Sandy hugged himself. Crossing the room to blow out the candle, he continued to gaze about the room. After a moment, he whined out, &quot;I am not a girl. Girls are so much lesser,&quot; and when he still didn't feel any better, he whimpered out, &quot;I don't deserve this. I'm a man,&quot; and exiting the room, he decided that what he needed was a shower to clear his head.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, Sandy closed the door and for some reason knowing that there was a full-body mirror on the wall just next to the door, he turned and gazed into the reflective surface.<br />
<br />
Peering back him, Sandy saw a girl with a B cup size breasts, the appropriate curves in all the right spaces and turning to look at himself from the side and than the back, he noted that the only thing that marred the image was his tiny penis and testicles, which had turned a bright pinkish-white colour. Backing up until his back hit the wall, Sandy slid to the floor and stared into the mirror, noting that even the way he sat on the floor made him look like a girl. After a moment, unsettled with how he looked and how much he changed, Sandy closed his eyes and thought about how unfair it was that he was being punished to be the lesser half of the human species. Opening his eyes, Sandy just sat there and after a moment, reached over and started to run the tub.<br />
<br />
When the water was at a warm enough temperature, Sandy pulled on the stopper and let the tub fill. As it filled, Sandy stood and retrieved some bathing oils from the bathroom cabinet and dropping a tiny bit into the tub he breathed deeply the scent of the sweet smell that was now coming from the tub. Twisting on the knob, cutting off the flow of water, Sandy climbed into the tub and sitting down, laid back, dunked a washcloth in the scented water and than placed it over his eyes as he reclined his head back onto a soft cushion placed at the edge of the tub.<br />
<br />
As the warmth and sweet smells washed over him, Sandy let his mind wander, forcing himself not to think of the horrible transformation his body was undergoing. After a bit, he smiled and completely relaxed, he remembered that he was going to go back to the carnival to see if he could find answers.<br />
<br />
“Curse my sudden girly ways,” Sandy thought as he drifted, unaware that he was loosing himself once again to what he thought of as girly ways.<br />
<br />
Blaming Pamela and her friends for tricking him into having breakfast and than seducing him into conversation, Sandy resolved that after his bath he’d return to the carnival and look for answers. Sighing, figuring it all made sense and that the carnival would for sure offer answers, he breathed deeper the scents and drifted further.</p>
