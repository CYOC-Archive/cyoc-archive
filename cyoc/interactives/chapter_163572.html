<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was nothing as pitch blackness as far as the eye could see for you. Your senses felt dull, as though they&#39;d stopped working entirely. How long were you floating here, suspended in the darkness of this void? Minutes? Hours? Days?<br />
<br />
Slowly... slowly you could feel sensation return to your body as vision returned to your eyes. Everything felt vague and fuzzy as you regained a semblance of self. A cloying, hypnotic white noise permeated the air, dancing around your awakening mind. Everything began to come in clearer as your senses returned to their full function, and you could finally get a grasp on where you are.<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t recognize where in the park you were, but you could at least recognize some things about it. This place seemed vaguely Medieval European, but in a fairy tale sort of sense. You seemed to be standing on a stage of some kind, and you noticed a gaggle of people staring up at you. You heard something that grabbed your attention almost immediately, coming from your right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Behold, our newest Whimsy World knight, the brave Sir Hammer!&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd clapped an cheered. You could feel a great sense of elation and excitement as you couldn&#39;t help but bow and smile warmly. You didn&#39;t know why, but you just felt this sense that you needed to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir Hammer,&quot; the voice addressed you, prompting you to instinctively turn to your right to face the speaker. The creature before you was a bipedal lion mascot dressed like a king. Everything about him was regal, majestic, and well put together, from his silken mane to his flowing robes to his graceful tail. A feeling of deja vu, but stronger hit you as you recognized this lion as King Leon, the kindly ruler of Fantasy Kingdom. You&#39;ve never met this mascot before, so how could you have recognized him so... instantly? You felt humbled in his presence, compelled to kneel before his majesty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rise, Sir Hammer,&quot; King Leon commanded with a chuckle, and rise you did, for who is a knight to disobey the king? The king then presented you with a chest, saying, &quot;I now present unto you a mighty tool befitting your title. Wield it with pride, honor, and dignity.&quot; Opening the chest you found a large mallet bearing the Fantasy Kingdom coat of arms. Gripping the handle, you lifted it high into the air, perhaps a bit dramatically as if you were performing for the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, my king,&quot; you hear yourself say, kneeling before the lion once more. You&#39;re more so saying these words unconsciously, automatically, instinctively, but you couldn&#39;t help but feel like this was your duty. &quot;I promise to wield this hammer in the name of justice, and to fight to protect our kingdom.&quot; You felt like you meant those words, although you halfway realized that you weren&#39;t in total control over them.<br />
<br />
Also, why was everyone calling you Sir Hammer? That wasn&#39;t your name, was it? No, of course not, your name was Sir Hammer. What? No, that can&#39;t be right. You were never this Sir Hammer before. You distinctly remember your name being... being...<br />
<br />
Your body seemed to be halfway moving on its own as it followed the king off of the stage. It was strange, you couldn&#39;t remember your name. All you could remember was Sir Hammer. Hammer if you weren&#39;t formal, and Hamm for short. You did remember that a while ago you had come to this theme park with your family because you&#39;d won a contest you suspected your brother entered you in...<br />
<br />
YOUR FAMILY! They had to be worried sick! Even if you couldn&#39;t remember your name, you certainly remembered what your parents and siblings looked like. Were they still in the park? You had to go find them!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr Knight! Can I get a picture with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a great sense of duty filled you. A guest wanted a picture with you, and as a proud mascot of Whimsy World it was your sworn duty to make every park guest feel welcomed, entertained, and delighted. So of course you just had to get your picture taken with an adorable little seven year old. You posed for the camera, as though you had done this a million times, smiling with purpose and unabashed happiness. After several pictures, a high five, and a quick autograph, the guests left happy, and elated satisfaction filled your body.<br />
<br />
You carried on with your original goal, to find your family, but along the way you got sidetracked by lots of other guests wanting pictures. You were all to happy to oblige to all of these requests, the need to make someone&#39;s day here that much more special overtaking you. It felt really good to make the children smile, and you somehow knew exactly how to act. It dawned on you early on that you&#39;d become a mascot of this park, and apparently you were a knight, presumably of the shining armor persuasion.<br />
<br />
From the pictures people took of you, you got a sense of your appearance. You were a human type mascot, with a big spherical head that was twice as big as a basketball. Your eyes were two white ovals with blue dot pupils, and you had no visible nose although you could still smell things. On your head you wore a shiny bluish silver helmet with a plume of blue feathers on top. You also had on a similarly colored breastplate with spaulders, loose white pants with a blue belt, and boots made of the same metal as your helmet and breastplate. Your biceps were super skinny, but your forearms and hands were quite thicker, quite like Popeye arms. Your legs were as thick as your forearms all the way down, ending at short and wide feet. Under your helmet was messy jet black hair.<br />
<br />
As you continued through the park, you finally caught a glimpse of your family. There was your mother, your father, and your younger siblings... but wait a minute, you were there with them. A clone perhaps? You were replaced with a clone? You ran straight up to your family, skidding to a halt as your ten year old brother ran excitedly up to you. You knew it was because you were a mascot and he wanted a picture and an autograph, but part of you hoped that he recognized his brother. You played you part beautifully, happy to delight the kids.<br />
<br />
Your parents had the clone of you pose with you too. You instinctively gave the alleged 18 year old a look of understanding, and he seemed to interpret it as you saying &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, I&#39;ve seen it all before.&quot; and the two of you posed for the camera.<br />
<br />
Eventually, your family and the clone left, but the clone did linger a bit to stare at you for a bit. He seemed... suspicious of you? No, that wasn&#39;t the right word for it. Did he recognize you as himself? He turned to rejoin your family, and you turned to walk the park some more, and delight more people along the way.<br />
<br />
Soon the sun was setting and all of the guests were leaving. Any minute now the park would be empty.<br />
<br />
A nearby loudspeaker crackled to life. &quot;CLOSING TIME. ALL GUESTS LEAVE THE PREMISES. WE HOPE YOU HAD A MAGICAL DAY!&quot; You felt the need to help guide people out of the park, and to keep an eye open for dreaded vandals and hooligans. Soon however, the park was emptied of its guests, and a new announcement came over the loudspeakers. &quot;Time to rest for the night,&quot; it said, &quot;Another magical day awaits you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
You found yourself walking instinctively towards the backstage area of the park. Somehow your feet just knew where to take you.</p>
