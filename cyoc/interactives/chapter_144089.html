<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a while of thinking you had the idea to explore the ship for a while until the Lizard has gotten rested up.<br />
<br />
Exiting the Lizards room you walk through the Grey corridors and explored the ship. surprisingly the ship seemed to have quite the diverse lot of rooms. A laboratory, three changing rooms with the third having an airlock, engineering bay (not that it looked very engineery with all the odd machines around.), port and starboard cargo bays that were quite empty except for some large futuristic crates that were secured to the floor. A top observatory and another airlock, a navigation room with a holographic map of the galaxy, a medical room, three more bedrooms (likely for guest sex.), teleporter room (your never using it again unless its fixed.), the entrance zone where the ramp is with an airlock. <br />
<br />
and last but certainly the most interesting. An armory. Wanting to see how the lizards weaponry was, you approached the metal sliding door and placed your claw on the scanner. surprisingly the scanner accepted you and opened the door for you. you guessed you might have the lizards handprint on you gauntlet. upon entering the armory a sensor detected you and closed the door for you allowing you to gaze upon whatever was inside.<br />
<br />
There was a multitude of weaponry inside small lockers. small guns similar to 1960&#39;s representation of sci-fi laser pistols. larger guns the size of bazooka&#39;s but clearly not bazooka&#39;s. you noted that all the weapons didn&#39;t look to have Bullet magazine slots which probably meant they were energy based weapons. looking at the wide selection of weapons in front of you. You couldn&#39;t choose. there was simply too much to choose from and you had the urge to test one of them.<br />
<br />
after picking up around 6 weapons you put them back as you changed your mind. stressed at your mind struggling to choose a weapon, you sat down on a bench in the back of the room and gazed at the ceiling in thought. &#39;&#39;e-. eeeh.&#39;&#39; A mechanical voice rang from around you which startled you as you  shot up and began scanning around for the source of the mechanical voice. &#39;&#39;where are you and who are you?&#39;&#39; you said as the mechanical voice seemed startled at my reaction.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;p-ppp-... *ahem* s-sorry for startling you miss dragon. didn&#39;t mean to scare you.&#39;&#39; the mechanical voice stuttered. Realising the voice came from a speaker in the ceiling, you calmed down slightly, but your muscles were still tense. &#39;&#39;Uuuh. ok. who are you then?&#39;&#39; you decided to ask gently as to not scare whoever this was. &#39;&#39;I-I&#39;m this ships AI. i noticed you were the human that Lizz brought onboard. and i gotta say. You raped her quite gently even if it caused her to orgasm 567 times in just 10 minutes.&#39;&#39; the AI chuckled. &#39;&#39;so you were watching? why didnt you say something.&#39;&#39; you asked the AI who suddenly got silent as the ship almost Jerked to a halt causing you to almost fall over. <br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;No time to answer, sorry miss dragon. *pause* Miss dragon, seeing as how i have recorded you saying. &#39;im a part of your crew now.&#39; to miss Lizz. Can you protect the ship from invaders on your self as Lizz is unable to be of any combat use.&#39;&#39; the AI asked you suddenly as you were looking around in slight panic. after processing what the AI just said you realized. &#39;&#39;we&#39;re under attack by who?&#39;&#39; you ask Looking at the weapon racks for a weapon. &#39;&#39;Pirates. they&#39;ll be arriving at the airlock in 9 minutes. after that they&#39;ll take aproximately 12 minutes to force open both Airlock doors.&#39;&#39; she spouts back in a passive aggressive tone.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Seeing as you&#39;ve been turned into a dragon 58 minutes ago, i shall inform you of important information about your species.&#39;&#39; the AI said calmly as you inspected some of the weapons, paying attention to the AI, you nod. &#39;&#39;Ok, so. the Dragon species is heavily engrained around sex and combat, with the victor taking the defeated as mate and sex slave. Since all Dragons are mainly futanari with some males, the males are wiewed as undefeatable to all but other males. <br />
<br />
But with combat being a pretty large thing about dragons, their scales are more than able to take many laser bolts in short periods of time. Dragon claws and talons are also able to cut steel, and Dragons are usually able to lift 35 times their own weight, which is usually around 1,2 tons.&#39;&#39; the AI continued. you went wide eyed at the mention of the average Dragon weight. 1,2 tons? thats heavy! also no wonder you feel so powerful. An average Dragon can lift can lift up to 42 tons! then you got a question. &#39;&#39;Am I the average for a Dragon?&#39;&#39; you asked the AI who paused a little. &#39;&#39;Yes. wait no actually. according to my calculations you shuld be the near the peak of Dragons. basically meaning you can take a plasma round straight on and survive. although you will most likely be knocked out by the blast. Oh, and you can lift 45,7 times your own weight.&#39;&#39; the AI answered.<br />
<br />
45,7 times your own weight? you were staring dumbfounded at the floor at the mere thought of what the AI just said. &#39;&#39;*Ahem* I will now continue... Besides having an unquenchable lust for sex whenever they get even the slightest bit aroused. And having Unparallelled organic strength together with scales that even a handheld railgun has trouble piercing. Dragons have a strategic military mind whenever they and their kin are threatened. All Dragons have a basic understanding of weapons. a favourite weapon of Dragons is the MK455 Gauss rifle. even a weak Dragon is able to expertly handle it. thats all the necessary information i had. <br />
<br />
Oh, and. Dragons are also known for being the single mass producer of exoskeleton power-armour which can withstand a single Plasma bolt before shortcircuiting. Not to mention they also have inbuilt personal shield generators which absorb laser bolts and add their energy to the suits power storage. And that was all.&#39;&#39; the AI finished. you made sure to run over all that information in your head and memorize the parts that you think would be useful. &#39;&#39;do we have a... MK4 something something gauss rifle or whatever?&#39;&#39; you ask the AI.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Indeed we have a MK455. we also have a Dragon power-armour here. But the MK455 is in the 5th locker to the left of you. we can worry about the armour after you&#39;ve got your weapon.&#39;&#39; the AI answers and i complied to that direction. &#39;&#39;5th locker to my left&#39;&#39; you mumbled to yourself. Bingo! just as the AI said. in the locker there was a powerful looking weapon with a logo you recognised as &#39;Drako Tech&#39;. Inspecting the MK455 in your claws, you aimed down its adjustible scope. You then picked up one of the Energy packs in the lower compartment of the locker and charged the rifle. &#39;&#39;the rifle takes energy from your suits energy storage just so you know.&#39;&#39; the AI Reminded you.<br />
<br />
taking aim at the back wall you ask the AI. &#39;&#39;is it ok if i shoot the wall?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Yes the ship&#39;s time distorter also acts like a shield both externally and internally. so just, fire away! just dont take too long as the pirates are at the airlock and are trying to hack. I will be counterhacking so dont expect me to say anything until they&#39;ve essentially beat me.&#39;&#39; The AI answered and with no further preparation you pull the trigger and. CRACKSHHH went the gauss rifle as a high energy laz-bolt collided with the time distorter shield. You pull the trigger one more time and felt the recoil tickle your shoulder lightly. <br />
<br />
Considering the recoil you felt you decided to rest the MK455 stock on the metal bench and pulled the trigger once more and you&#39;re shocked to see that the recoil created a dent in the bench from the force of the recoil. Deciding you shouldn&#39;t wreck everything, you practice some movements where you are supposedly in melee range of a pirate. You do some awfully fast movements where you strike at a pirate within arms reach of you. You also do some quick combat rolls around the armory, using your tail and wings to roll smoothly and quickly.<br />
<br />
Feeling paranoia kick in, you decide it&#39;ll be best if you wore power-armour just in case the majority of the pirates had plasma weapons.</p>
