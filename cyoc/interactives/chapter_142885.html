<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maggie was fairly pleased with how ASM had been progressing and the agency that had built up around it. A lot of its success came from the obvious sex appeal that many Animalians had, in that she&#39;d noticed that even single dosed Animalians had a bit &quot;more&quot; than what was noted for Humans the same age, and in some cases even those older than them. The occasional visits with Animalia Ambassadoria that related things that ASM was doing made that pretty obvious, especially after they had expanded to have essentially equal numbers of Human and Animalian members to fit a format that would at least try present Animalia&#39;s news and present reports on the various issues that Animalia faced and how Human/Animalian relations worked.<br />
<br />
At first it had largely been left to a comparison between Sophie and Jessica, with Jessica as a single dosed Rabbit Animalian and Sophie as a human. In the course of her Freshman and Sophomore years, Maggie noted Jessica grow slightly taller and the beginnings of her curves really starting to come in. Sophie grew up two over the same two years, but it wasn&#39;t as fast and it wasn&#39;t as much. Things didn&#39;t even out between them again until Sophie became a Pterodactylus Dinotopian at the start of the previous summer, but now as they both approached their seventeenth birthdays or passed them, Maggie wasn&#39;t sure on when Sophie or Jessica were born, she could see them both maturing even more into the forms they&#39;d likely have. Though the best comparison for Maggie to use was between Jessica and Judy, and for the moment, Jessica was still shorter and less voluptuous than Judy, but it wasn&#39;t by that much and Maggie figured that by the this time next year, when Sophie and Jessica would be closer to their eighteenth birthdays the differences between Judy and Jessica would be near nothing. At the same time, both showed the same sorts of Animalian physical advantages over Animalia Ambassadoria&#39;s new Human members as well.<br />
<br />
But that was all just Maggie&#39;s own mind wandering. Particularly as she had her own work to do, especially with her own school and the agency that worked with it. She couldn&#39;t spend all her time thinking on some of the people that had helped publicize the Animalian School of Modelling, because like many things, ASM had started to expand in ways that even Maggie hadn&#39;t seen coming when she started. The venture to Egypt had been one of them...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Many of the shoots that were done at New Zerzura were fairly tame, especially by Animalian standards. Most of the contracts and shots that the ASM students had been in weren&#39;t pornographic in nature or anything that was outright sexual, but there had been a fair number of swimsuit and lingerie shots that were done from time to time. It wasn&#39;t explicit, but it would come off as a bit much given Egypt&#39;s rules. This was actually something that Maggie felt would be helpful for her students as it would mean that there would be many things that would develop in time and could let her bring some of the tips she&#39;d given to Bunni Clair regarding some posing in a business suit in case they were ever offered shots that wouldn&#39;t involve swimsuits or underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still not fully sure on how this will all work,&quot; Zoe said slowly as they looked up at some of the monuments and ruins that were part of the old city that had been uncovered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll work fine,&quot; Maggie answered, &quot;remember that modelling is not solely about attracting a mate... or doing something that would serve to attract potential suitors. In fact most high line fashion designs aren&#39;t something that would be judged to be sexual and those shoots are among the best paying because there are so many changes in fashion that occur.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Zoe slowly nodded as she stood near one of the old columns in a soft white sundress. The collar might be a bit higher than what most Animalians preferred, but it did look good on Zoe. The skirt part of the dress came down to her knees with one of the specialized flaps/folds that allowed the Lioness Animalian&#39;s tail move freely without lifting the bottom of the dress. Maggie then came forward and moved forward and moved one of Zoe&#39;s arms so that it reached to one of the display signs that explained the specific ancient building that they were near.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now with this shot, you&#39;ll want to look to the sign as though you&#39;re studying it intently and with great interest, and that you&#39;re enjoying the visit,&quot; Maggie instructed, &quot;and to remain somewhat casual. As a shot like this isn&#39;t to be flirtatious but to provide something that New Zerzura could use to promote the site&#39;s history and so on. You understand, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoe slowly nodded, &quot;I think I still like the shot out in the desert better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maggie slowly nodded. Their previous shot had been allowed with exclusive permission from the Egyptian government for a set of shots away from New Zerzura and the Nile River. The spot was isolated and had no direct line of sight with any structures in the area. It had been a bit of a trek to get there, but it had been accepted as it was the site that would allow them some of the swimsuit shots that many of Maggie&#39;s students had liked. Of course, for Zoe, Maggie figured some of this was in attracting a mate, given that there were some Lion Animalian prides south in Maelewano. It made sense, and it was a favorable scene for that sort of thing while they had the time at that site. And for many, that sort of thing would have some degree of appeal. Though that didn&#39;t necessarily apply for everyone, and Maggie soon heard it from both Venus and Xochitl.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would have been better if we could have found the one part of the desert that wasn&#39;t filled with sand dunes,&quot; Venus commented, &quot;the suntan lotion was fine...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the sand was rough... coarse... and it got everywhere,&quot; Xochitl added.<br />
<br />
That earned a few giggles from some of the others as they caught onto the reference. Even Xochitl laughed a little bit, seemingly in relief as if she was waiting for a laugh. Maggie felt some relief at that, but figured that her two new students probably had some degree of sensitivity that the rough sand and dirt of the site they were allowed to use for that shoot given that their breeds of cat and dog were naturally hairless, and thus didn&#39;t have the layer of protection that a soft layer of fur could provide. This meant that anything blown at them was a bit irritating as it would be blown against their skin, and from what Maggie figured, both Venus and Xochitl had largely been indoor pets before they were uplifted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though you both did well with that shoot,&quot; Maggie said with a small smile, &quot;and if you want them published... that&#39;s up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both thankfully nodded, though Maggie didn&#39;t think that either would actually have those photos published and would go into their own private file. Xochitl because of her apparent interest in one of the Guards of Anubis at New Zerzura, a Jackal Animalian named Abbas. Venus had some concerns with those sorts of things because of an emotional attachment that she seemed to have with the son of her former owner, which even Maggie noticed at off hand moments, but neither of those things were necessarily bad things. In fact to some extent, Maggie also figured that some of that Venus and Xochitl were quite good things. They could be signs of love and respect, which always went a long way.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the end, I&#39;d think everyone looked quite well,&quot; Maggie spoke as she reviewed some of the shots.<br />
<br />
There was the scene of Zoe studying one of the signs posted in the ancient city area of the ruins of old Zerzura that was explaining the columns that were behind the sign.  There was another that had Venus and Zoe together in front of a large lioness statue that was in a seated position and carved eyes gazing outward. The guides had that the statue was of one of the earlier depictions of the Egyptian goddess Bastet before Egyptian mythology changed the goddess&#39;s appearance from Lioness to that of a Domestic House Cat. There was also a shot of Xochitl in a button up short sleeved shirt and knee high shorts standing with one of the guards and looking very much like a stereotypical archeologist holding up a map before one of the Guards of Anubis, who had been more than happy to pretend to give Xochitl directions. They weren&#39;t the most sensual or sexual pictures, but they did look good, and Maggie thought that a few of them could be sold to Egypt for their use to try and advertise the New Zerzura sites.<br />
<br />
There was also one of Sylvia with some of New Zerzura&#39;s snake Animalians, was taken more like an individual on vacation and touring the region. Maggie would make sure that Sylvia would get it before her spring semester started, knowing that their break couldn&#39;t last too much longer and that those that went to WSA were back in class by now.</p>
