<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, back at Jeff&#39;s house, the former donkey that Jeff had swapped with, suddenly found himself sitting down, but being straight up. One moment he was enjoying his daily meal on a farm as the donkey he was born as, and the next moment he was looking through a human named Jeff&#39;s eyes. <br />
<br />
The clarity with which he could see was impeccable! He had never seen soany bright colors, and I&#39;m such sharp clarity before! Though, he couldn&#39;t hear very well, and there were no interestimg scents to pursue. <br />
<br />
He then looked down at his front &quot;legs&quot; and &quot;hooves!&quot; They were all wrong! What were these wierd little appendages where his nice sturdy hooves used to be!?<br />
<br />
&quot;Fingers.&quot; The word &quot;fingers&quot; popped into his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fingers?&quot; He thought. <br />
<br />
He started wiggling them around. Flexing them. It started to feel....GOOD! Smiling, (something also oddly different he found he could now do), he decided to purposely grip something with his new-found &quot;fingers.&quot; <br />
<br />
The donkey-turned Jeff began to discover the usefulness of these &quot;fingers&quot; that he now suddenly possessed. Even as the original Jeff was discovering that being stuck with hooves and stuck on four legs in a clumsy 700 lb body, was useless. <br />
<br />
The new Jeff began to explore his new, lithe, clean-feeling, refreshing, young, male human body; while the old Jeff was exploring the body he had exchanged for as a dirty old male donkey&#39;s body that was far too large and overweight to ever fit inside a car or ride a rollercoaster ever again. <br />
<br />
The new Jeff immediately found his hairless little teenage male body to be very comfortable. He noticed right away, that the itchiness (which he was used to before), no longer existed! He suddenly felt free and liberated. Like he could just jump up and move in ways he never could before. It&#39;s amazing just how oppressive being stuck with a heavy, furry, dirty old hide can be. Even more so, how severely limited and restrictive a set of four hooves can be. <br />
<br />
The new Jeff also began to discover he knew completely new things. For whatever reason, old Jeff&#39;s life, memories, and skills began to pop into existence in his new human mind one-by-one. He still retained the simple memories of just being a donkey. Looking back at his old life now seems like a nightmare vanished. <br />
<br />
He got up and sighed in satisfaction at his new body. His new life. His new existence. Then the memory and knowledge of that chronivac came to him. The the donkey transformation fetish started coming to him as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! No way! No way am I going to be tempted to use this thing to swap back!&quot; He thought to himself. So he sat down at the computer, and started tweaking some adjustments.<br />
<br />
For one thing, he deleted his donkey tf fetish. He replaced it to be attracted to girls. Human girls.  He adjusted some of his looks as well. Gave himself thick dark hair and blue eyes. Made his puny little human dick slightly larger and more sensitive.  He gave himself a nice boyish medium build. <br />
<br />
He looked in a mirror at himself. There. That oughta do it! He was a CUTE boy! Looking younger than his age. An innocent nice look about him, like a blue-eyed Kevin Arnold in the first couple seasons of The Wonder Years. <br />
<br />
Once he was finished with himself, he thought about the boy he had swapped bodies with. Jeff! That&#39;s right! He was still stuck as a donkey. &quot;As....ME!&quot; he said out loud to himself, because he could. <br />
<br />
Sitting back down at the computer, he noticed the old Jeff still retained his human thoughts and memories. Why did the new Jeff gain memories of being Jeff in the swap, but the old Jeff didn&#39;t for being a donkey?<br />
<br />
Perhaps because it is vital for him to be able to function as a human im a human world without disrupting the world around him too much. While it is easy to change small details, like eye color, it isn&#39;t so easy to change an entire personal history to suit a person who now has the low IQ of a donkey. School records would have to be changed. Entire memories of classmates, teachers, friends, and families would need to change. Events that took place in the past, such as attending friends&#39; birthday parties, would have to change. After all, a human with the IQ of a donkey wouldn&#39;t be going to a normal school. They would be in a special-ed class instead, with entirely different classmates and teachers. So the chronivac needed to make the Jeff identity stick with it&#39;s body and brain, in order to save on power.<br />
<br />
Whereas, a human becoming a donkey, it isnt so disruptive to the world if a donkey suddenly has the intelligence and memories of being a human. They wouldn&#39;t be allowed to speak. Without hands and arms, the hooves would make it virtually impossible to write. Jeff could try writing in the dirt and muck in order to try to draw attention to what happened. But it would be labor-intensive and frustrating with his heavy blocks of hooves. His eyesight would be too poor to be effective at writing messages in the farm grounds. Even if he did manage to write something, it wouldn&#39;t mean a human farmer, his owner, would notice it. Jeff could go days in his field, without ever seeing jus owner. In the meantime, another animal could trample it, or the weather could whipe it out. <br />
<br />
The only problem a human-minded donkey could make in the world, is being abnormally stubborn and panic-driven at being stuck forever as a simple farm animal. Frustrated at his inability to do anything that a human body could. For that, the chronivac gave several strong instincts to kick in:<br />
<br />
1) The need to eat. Jeff would have the overwhelming desire to graze. To even overeat, in order to keep up with his overweight donkey body.<br />
<br />
2) Fear. Jeff would be overcome with fear at the crackling electric fencing. So much so, that escaping from his field would be impossible. Jeff would find himself being unable to ever will his donkey body to go closer than 10 feet from the electric fence strung around the perimeter of his field. <br />
<br />
3) Pleasing his owner. Jeff&#39;s mind may protest all it wants, but his body would automatically do as it&#39;s owner wanted with his simple commands that even donkeys could understand. His owner doesn&#39;t pay too much attention to the donkeys on the farm anyway. Donkeys are there just to be companion animals to the REAL stars of the farm: horses and cows. Once in a while, donkeys on the farm would be expected to breed. <br />
<br />
4) Sexual desires.  Jeff would be forced to experience and conduct his sexual desires. The former donkey was a broken-in homosexual &quot;bottom&quot; to male horses and other donkeys. More often than not, the former donkey would find himself having to finish himself off by himself. Jeff would be stuck now to live out this life. <br />
<br />
Anyway, the new Jeff looked over the parameters, and was satisfied. He COULD free the old Jeff and swap back. But no way was New Jeff going back to that gross body. He could also &quot;free&quot; old Jeff by whipping out all of his human memories and knowledge. But Old Jeff actually WANTED this experience. Who was he to change that?<br />
<br />
New Jeff thought about it the following day. He wanted nothing to do with that old life of his ever again. He decided to leave Old Jeff in peace, and deleted his profile and all of his own memories of it altogether. <br />
<br />
With his profile gone, even if New Jeff still remembered Old Jeff, there would be no way for him to ever locate him or identify him in any way. He could guess and target any old donkey in the world, but the chances of it being Old Jeff is infinitesimally small. <br />
<br />
Upon deletion the following day, the chronivac sent a message to Old Jeff in a sort of telepathic manner.....</p>
