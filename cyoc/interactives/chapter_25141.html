<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lights swirl all around you. You blink your eyes as your vision clears. Your initial thoughts concern your location and current form.<br />
<br />
You feel strange. There's a weight on your chest and your attire seems to have changed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you hear an explosion and the floor under you lurches, knocking you onto your ... tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother fucker!&quot; The curse escapes your mouth. The voice is female!<br />
<br />
You look down to see that you're wearing a light blue tee shirt and shorts. Your feet are white fur covered and clawed. You're wearing a belt with an obvious place to store a weapon on both its right and left side.<br />
<br />
Judging from the coloration of the tail between your legs, you're a skunk, a female one at that.<br />
<br />
You're in a room with dark grey windows and a cold black floor. The decor is the antithesis of your new body; cold and sterile compared to a form that's warm and sensual.<br />
<br />
You stand up and look to your left. Several large windows look out into an impressive view of a planet that if it isn't Earth, it's simular.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oy, turned into a female skunk and now I'm in space aboard ... where the hell am I anyway?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
You hear what sounds like weapons fire followed by the smashing of metal. A door before you opens and a humanoid male tiger stands there. He's clad in similar attire to you. He has what appears to be a wound on his right shoulder. In his right hand is a pistol like weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma’am, am I glad to see that you're all right. Come on, we have to get out of here!&quot; he says. His voice commands both trust and respect.<br />
<br />
You don't know who he is or where you are but you have a feeling that whatever ship you're aboard isn't going to be there for much longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're wounded!&quot; You explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's superficial. Are you all right? We weren’t aware that they'd captured anyone else,&quot; the tiger says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine ... I think I'm fine. Where am I?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
The deck again lurches. Explosions send both you and the tiger to the ground. The corridor fills with smoke and you can feel the heat from flames nearby. The computer drones something in a language you cannot understand.<br />
<br />
The tiger hits something on his right ear and grabs a hold of you. You feel a tingle as everything around you goes white and your body seems to disappear. When everything comes back into focus, you're in a forest with the tiger. You hear the chirping of birds all around you. The air is warm and the scents of the woods are strong.<br />
<br />
Standing up, the Tiger offers you his right hand. You take it and he pulls you up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you all right?&quot; he asks.<br />
<br />
You look down at your body. You don't seem to be injured, although your clothes are now filthy. You're still a female skunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ... think so,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You inquired as to your location. Are you sure they didn't harm you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are they? What's going on? I'm ... not even supposed to be a female skunk! This is going to sound strange but I don't belong here!&quot; you blurt out.<br />
<br />
The tiger looks around, as though attempting to asertain your location.<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you that we will find a way back to civilzation. It is important that we keep our emotions controlled. Panicing will only worsen our situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that's not what I mean. I was in this chamber and I pressed a button and then I was a female skunk aboard that ship or whatever it was. I know my story sounds crazy,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps but ... unless you're attempting to deceive me for some reason, I doubt you have anything to gain by lying,&quot; The tiger says.<br />
<br />
You nod and turn around in an attempt to see just where he has teleported you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was happening up there?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
You jump when the tiger places his right hand on your right shoulder. Turning around, you see that he looks apologetic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Looking at him, you see that despite his reassurances, his wound appears worse then he said. Your situation doesn’t seem as important. He rescued you from wherever that was, now it's your turn to help him. You can hear running water nearby. You take his hand, noticing that his grip is strong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, we have to do something about your shoulder,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Leading him to the water, you find that it's a stream. You ask him to sit down and to take off his shirt. You're not sure how you'll react to this in your current form. Given your current species and gender, you're not sure how he'll react either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma’am, I don't think that's appropriate,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you married?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's not that. You're a stranger, it would be inappropriate to disrobe in your presence,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to clean your wound and stop the bleeding,&quot; you say before grinning. &quot;Don't worry, I used to be a guy remember? I won't try anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tiger nods and removes his shirt. His chest has white fur on it and is well muscled. Even you have to admit that he's handsome. You take his shirt and turn to walk towards the stream. Acting on an impulse, you hold the shirt up to your blunt muzzle and take in its scent. The odour on it is musky and excites you.<br />
<br />
You shake your head and dip his shirt into the stream, soaking it. Lifting it out, you turn around and walk back to him. While it’s crude, you’re able to clean the blood from his wound with it.<br />
<br />
“If I had another shirt, I could make a makeshift bandage with…”<br />
<br />
Looking down, you realise that your shirt could serve that purpose. You remove it, exposing your white furred chest. The tiger looks at you before looking down. You see your breasts for the first time. They’re both firm and attractive looking. However, exploring your new body is not your immediate concern.<br />
<br />
“It’s all right, you can look if you want. Maybe we can help each other out,” you say.<br />
<br />
You approach him and tie your shirt around his wounded shoulder. You touch his chin and gradually lift his head up.<br />
<br />
“I may not know where I am or how to be a female skunk but since this is apparently my body now, I think that if I say it’s okay for you to look then it’s all right,” you say.<br />
<br />
He looks at you; his eyes are innocent, as though he’s not quite sure what to do in this situation. Since you aren’t either, it seems that you can relate to him on this level.<br />
<br />
“May I?” he asks.<br />
<br />
Something inside of you wants him to touch you in ways you know would be pleasurable. You nod your head.<br />
<br />
He reaches up and touches the left side of your face with his right hand before running his hand though your long white hair (which is in a ponytail).<br />
<br />
“Thank you for rescuing me back there,” you say.<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome,” he says.<br />
<br />
You consider your next move as he lets go on you and sits there looking at you.</p>
