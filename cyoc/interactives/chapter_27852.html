<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If T was a human being, a mere human, then Tammia's brain washing would <br />
have absorbed him easily. The arrogant prince of the nine-tailed foxes should <br />
have known better, combining souls always created dangerous amounts of <br />
power in the new entity, making them nearly impossible to control, like his <br />
new queen. <br />
<br />
But T wasn't human, not in the least, he was an angel, which made him more <br />
frightening than most living things on this planet! Of course he was being <br />
submerged in an ocean with heavy chains covering his mind as the the mirror <br />
awareness of Tammia created a giant coat of ice over the surface. <br />
<br />
A human being wouldn't have stood a chance. But the Angel whose name <br />
starts with T wasn't human. He superiors hated it when he did this next part, <br />
they felt falling back on this sort of thing was seen as grandstanding in this <br />
day and age. But it was this back-up plan, or be trapped in this magical <br />
overhaul body as his spirit died a slow horrible death. T spread his wings. <br />
<br />
Karther was also struggling. What was happening? His queen was supposed <br />
to be his, he wasn't supposed to be her toy. He had even entertained the <br />
thought that perhaps, they could even be equals! After all, he had made her to <br />
be such. But Tammia, both of her, was laying layer after layer of emotional <br />
modifications on him. He was the prince of kitesume. He was older than most <br />
countries. But he had made his queen -too- well it seemed. He would have <br />
normally cackled at the irony if he wasn't feeling more and more docile by the <br />
moment. Still, he was a master magic user, and this place was kept in place <br />
by his will! He used his power to create a slight rise in the floor ahead, which <br />
made him trip, the quick bonk on the head and the healthy dose of pain <br />
snapping him back to reality for the moment. What had gone wrong? No <br />
matter, he'd figure it out soon enough and repair whatever run time error was <br />
in his queen's brainwashing. <br />
<br />
The Tammias turned around and smiled at their prince. &quot;Now now dear, none <br />
of that.&quot; They said at exactly the same time with exactly the same tone and <br />
expression. They might as well have been mirror images. &quot;We can't have you <br />
getting hurt before you can enjoy us.&quot; <br />
<br />
Karther felt a -double dose- of the emotion control assault this time. All the <br />
times he had screwed with innocent people's brain, using them, playing with <br />
them as if they were toys rather than sentient beings, he had never <br />
experienced it for himself. And thus, he had no real defenses against it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now maybe we should go deal with those vixens who can't make right in the <br />
head anymore, maybe they'll made good sand sculptures.&quot; They said together <br />
exactly the same, thou one of the Tammia's eyes twitched. <br />
<br />
As Karther suddenly wondered just what he was upset about and just -why- <br />
he wouldn't want to do what he queen wanted, and why he'd be hesitant <br />
about enjoy her anyway, one of the Tammia's suddenly grabbed her head in <br />
confusion. <br />
Two shapes of light seemed to grow from her back momentarily, then things <br />
seemed to explode, everything within a dozen feet sphere was returned to it's <br />
original state of shapeless sand, and all where throw back causing a cave in <br />
from the palace's sudden lack of support in that area, part of the ceiling of the <br />
first floor and some of the walls collapsed. <br />
<br />
A while later Tammia got up, and was confused that she could no longer feel <br />
her second body. But looking among the rubble she saw her lovely prince <br />
was perfectly all right. That was good. They were meant to be together after <br />
all. <br />
<br />
Shaking his head, T looked down at himself as the dust settled on the other <br />
side of several tons of sand stone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh just great.&quot; 'He' said, not only was his body still not human, it was still not <br />
male. This wasn't so much dismay as it was annoyance, he had gotten used <br />
to that body and it had taken years to hone it. She hoped she'd be able to <br />
revert her body back to it's previous form, it would be annoying to have to <br />
work all the kinks out of a new form all over again. At least this form wasn't just <br />
the fleshy love doll it had been a moment ago. While still decidedly female, <br />
the chest wasn't stupidly huge, and she was at least muscular. She also now <br />
only had one tail. She didn't mind the lack of clothing at all, after all, that was a <br />
human tradition she observed out of manners and nothing more.<br />
<br />
She felt something on her back, reached her fur covered hand behind her and <br />
moaned in frustration. Her wings were now permanently a part of this body <br />
rather than something she could call out and return at will. This was going to <br />
make things more 'interesting.' <br />
<br />
Looking at the rubble, she sensed Karther and Tammia on the other side. She <br />
was so tempted to leave Karther to his fate, he had decidedly earned it. But <br />
Tammia was still a victim, no matter how dangerous she was now. <br />
<br />
Summoning up a spiked mace (and praying no DC comics fanboy ever saw <br />
her wielding one), 'T' got ready to begin to smash through the sand stone to <br />
get at the new queen of the nine tailed foxes. <br />
<br />
'Where am I? What's going oh?'<br />
<br />
T felt her head look around on it's own as she heard those words. Okay. <br />
Check, now things had gotten Chinese curse 'may you live in interesting <br />
times' interesting. <br />
She knew that voice, the only voice it could belong to.<br />
<br />
'Hello Janice.' She though and as expected, her mouth spoke thou the voice <br />
was still that of the angel fox, the tone and inflection wasn't hers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Where are you? Who are you? And where did this mace come from?&quot; T <br />
let her body examine the weapon before she herself gave it a practice swing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whao.&quot; T's mouth said. &quot;My arm moved on it's own?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; T said verbally now. &quot;I moved my arm.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; T's voice, or rather, Janice said. <br />
<br />
T signed. &quot;What do you remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember I'm not supposed to be a fox, OR female, OR a slave to this crazy <br />
fox guy. And I remember my best friend being turned into an even freakier <br />
version of how she already was. Then...I remember... feeling.. faint... without <br />
limits... but smaller... or rather.. that I could -see- how small I really was in <br />
comparison to everything else. Then... like I was a cup of water that got <br />
poured into an already partially full pitcher... then it's all even more messed <br />
up.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see. I would guess when I dared use my real form for a split second in a <br />
material universe, my power mixed with the fox magic. Oh and all those TV <br />
Shows were dead on the money about that. You -don't- mix magics unless <br />
you want big trouble. Basically this body tried to be two things at once, it <br />
couldn't be of course, so it went for a middle ground. Your soul got pulled out <br />
of the mix and ended up in this pitcher.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... if this is your body, where's mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It . . . . no longer exists... it was assimilated into Tammie's when Karther <br />
decided to add another layer of magic brainwashing to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; 'T' felt the pain of her voice scream through the sensitive fox ears.  <br />
He let Janice throw a tantrum for a few seconds as she smashed the floor a <br />
couple times with the mace before reasserting control. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry. I know it's not the same, but after I complete my mission and punish <br />
Karther for abusing the wording of his vow -and- repair the damage he's done <br />
to so many innocent people. I'll let you have this body, I won't need it after my <br />
mission's done.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Mission? What are you anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An angel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;BS. I don't believe in god.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;TOO BAD! Just tell yourself it's just a near death experience you're having, or <br />
maybe you're having a drug trip, you won't have to compromise your beliefs <br />
then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have beliefs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To have no beliefs, in of itself, IS a belief.&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice had no retort to that. &quot;So what's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which one? Sorry, I end up with a new one nearly every time I go on an <br />
errand it seems. Since I'm currently in a female body, I think I'll follow suit with <br />
you, just call me Tabra.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Tabra... are you going to go save my friend now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WE are. Weather I like it or not, you and I are a package deal right now.  <br />
Which means you're going to have to learn quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is too weird! Being in a girl body that used to be mine was bad enough, <br />
being in another girl's body that used to be a guy's is too much! I want out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would kill you. I won't do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kill?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That IS what you call it when you forcibly separate someone's spirit from their <br />
body. Besides, two heads are better than one. Now please, relax, I have some <br />
things I want to teach you, and doing it the clumsy verbal way would waste <br />
time we don't have.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just give you some quick lessons on how to use this body's abilities. The one <br />
advantage this gives us for now is that one mind can observe and analyze <br />
while the other acts. But for either role, you need to, forgive me, smarten up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you mean 'for now?'&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra sighed. &quot;You can't have two souls in the same body. It doesn't work like <br />
that. You weren't in Tammia's long enough for it to take effect. But the longer <br />
you and I are in one body, the more you and I will parallel each other until our <br />
spirits become one. You cease to exist, I cease to exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's horrible!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not happy about the idea either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You gave the impression you could leave this body, could you do that for <br />
me?&quot; Janice tried to sound 'girl next door' though she hadn't been born female <br />
and Tabra was currently female as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd rather slowly fuse with you than let yourself get killed. Which is EXACTLY <br />
what will happen if you try to rescue your friend on your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Killed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think personality death IS?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Karther has centuries of experience with fighting and magic... I just have <br />
experience that you don't that no amount of teaching can transfer to you.   On <br />
the other hand, you know Tammie better than I do. And part of her is still that <br />
fox queen. In a way... I need you, and you need me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.. Okay.. for Tammie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra open her mind and let a flood of information wash into Janice's... sword <br />
fights from before the tower of babel fell. Having shed tears at Hiroshima AND <br />
Pearl Harbor. Dismembering an undead five ways from Sunday after it <br />
promised to rape someone dear. <br />
<br />
The fox angel gasped for breath fall to her knees as one of her souls <br />
shuddered from the sudden influx of information. <br />
<br />
&quot;Give it time. You'll digest it all soon enough.&quot; Tabra said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Janice said haltingly. <br />
<br />
The fox angel stood up and looked at herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;... if I can make things the way Karther can change things... can I create some <br />
clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We really more summon things from sub-reality storage and alter their atomic <br />
structure slightly than 'create' them out of thin air.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any clothes in that magic closet of yours then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll never understand why you humans continued to wear clothes for modesty <br />
after the first sin was finally forgiven.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going around naked! And I'm not letting that prick get any more views <br />
of my body!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our body.&quot; Tabra reminded her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm not letting -us- move from this spot until I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't need to act like a child about it. Just feel out what you need, picture <br />
it in your mind's eye.&quot; <br />
<br />
Light appeared around the fox angel... it bent and molded to her body. When <br />
the light died down, Tabra looked down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw. Not a dress?&quot; She grinned. She was in a pair of blue genes and a white <br />
blank shirt with button up holes for her tail and wings. She couldn't figure out <br />
how to make shoes and socks for feet like those. <br />
<br />
Then she frowned. &quot;Just cause I'm in a female body doesn't mean I've given <br />
up hope on getting my original gender back! And my original name!!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Normally I'd say names are just road signs... but honestly, I CAN imagine... <br />
and actually FEEL what it's like to lose something that important to you.&quot; Tabra <br />
said. The fox angel looked at the rubble and gripped the mace with both <br />
hands. &quot;Now let's get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not just use some high explosives?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll bring the entire place down on top of us even more than we have, and <br />
not all of Karther's slaves are magically built like tanks. We're just lucky this <br />
area was empty except for the lot of us when I opened up my wings. Which <br />
means we need to do this the old fashioned way. Outside the palace walls we <br />
should be able to teleport without fear of being trapped in solid walls. . . Now <br />
make a wish, and say a prayer that Karther and Tammia are so distracted by <br />
each other and us that they don't try to harm Vicki or the other slaves I de-<br />
brainwashed.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Eight of the nine fox girls, all of whom had been men original so Karther could <br />
get around his promise of not kidnapping girls, all looked to Vicki for some <br />
kind of decision for what to do next. <br />
This was, of course, just force of habit, she had been kidnapped and <br />
brainwashed first. Thus she was seen as 'chief concubine.'<br />
Vicki wasn't even her real name. She gripped the unremovable cross around <br />
her neck. Victor! She remembered! Her original name was Victor! She felt a <br />
wave of memories that Karther had buried under a desert of sand begin to <br />
come back. She had been a cop, a policeman, she protected and served <br />
others because she -chose to- not because she was -made- to! She let go of <br />
the cross bitterly. But what was the POINT of remembering if she couldn't BE <br />
Victor anymore? She couldn't even live in normal society like this! <br />
But... if her brainwashing could be undone, then perhaps the rest of the <br />
violations to her body could be too! And even then... she was STIL a cop... <br />
and she had a duty!  <br />
<br />
&quot;Vicki.&quot; Barbara asked, &quot;Do you think we can get out of here?&quot; <br />
<br />
Vicki smiled at her. &quot;We -have- to.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the other nine fox girls was shivering, though they were still in the <br />
battle armor that Karther had put them in before leaving his dummy behind. At <br />
least they weren't in their harem outfits they had happily wore while serving <br />
their 'lovely master.'  <br />
<br />
&quot;This is like an anime I watched once. It was a comedy about an alien <br />
princess who got turned into an eight year old. Her cat girl maid, to prevent <br />
any girls from stealing the princess' 'fiancee.' Transformed any poor girl who <br />
happened to look at or WAS looked at by him into a cat girl maid and the ray <br />
gun she was using also instantly brainwashed them into being loyal maids to <br />
the royal family who answered to their 'Chief Maid' without question. The <br />
anime concluded without so much as one of them being de-brainwashed. <br />
None of the characters even DISCUSSED how it was wrong to transform and <br />
brainwash innocent girls! They weren't important enough... and we aren't <br />
either.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Keiko.&quot; Vicki said. &quot;That's NOT going to happen to us! We're not going to get <br />
re-brain washed, and we are -not- stuck like this forever! We've been given a <br />
chance to try and live our lives again... I'm not going to let it go.&quot; <br />
<br />
Starting with Baraba, the other seven foxes nodded their heads. <br />
<br />
Another fox girl however looked out at the desert and out at the moon. &quot;I'm <br />
worried, mom, dad, bro, sis, Alice. They must all be worried sick about me by <br />
now! That's assuming of course that bastard didn't erase us from existence <br />
when he stole our lives!&quot; She turned around at the others. &quot;But even if I'm now <br />
'nobody' I'm going to pay that bastard back in full! Even if I'm doomed to be <br />
Luna for the rest of my life, I'm going to make sure he gets his for killing who I <br />
was before!&quot; <br />
<br />
Vicki sweet dropped. &quot;Whatever gets you up in the morning.&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna picked up the spear she had been using when Karther had turned his <br />
sex toys into weapons. &quot;Come on. Let's go. If magic really exists, then those <br />
who use it I don't think will be able to keep quite about it anymore if -we- show <br />
up at a major city. Then they might be forced to actually DO something about <br />
Karther. And maybe help those two girls who escaped before us and the rest <br />
of the lot here who likely weren't born foxes either.&quot; She was about to march <br />
out the door spear in hand when she stopped and looked at Vicki. &quot;Heh heh... <br />
if that all fits with you Vicki.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicki smiled and nodded. &quot;I couldn't have said it better myself.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
In the culinary section of the palace, Alexsander put a paw to her forehead as <br />
she felt a sensation pass through her. She almost dropped the cutting knife <br />
she was holding. <br />
&quot;Something has happened to my prince.&quot;  She whispered solemnly.</p>
