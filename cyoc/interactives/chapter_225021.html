<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Why not this young one?” A goddess watched a scrawny college kid type away at his laptop, scrolling through internet forms. <br />
<br />
“You expect him to usher forward the new species and create the new world we desire?” another god scoffed at the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you, Konvald, this young man is a perfect vessel. He appears to be a repressed soul, hiding his true nature due to embarrassment. By selecting him as our first subject, we can help him embrace his latent power.&quot; the goddess explained, defending her suggestion.<br />
<br />
“I am still skeptical, Agdis,” mused a third god, Eitel &quot;What if this mortal proves inadequate in advancing our agenda?&quot;<br />
<br />
“If he fails, it would signify our failure as well,” Agdis responds, “By guiding this mortal, we can nurture him into a formidable being, one capable of catalyzing the changes we seek for Earth.”<br />
<br />
“Fair enough, Let it be,” Eitel admitted, “but you shall be the one that speaks to him first.”<br />
<br />
“It would be my honor to do so, let us commence with his transformation.” Agdis declared as she worked her magic on the unsuspecting human below…<br />
—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
David typed away at his laptop. He had an essay to do, but the 20-year-old kept getting distracted by the forums and furry artwork he had up on the other tabs. David viewed the whole furry thing as his pastime, an escape from the crushing realities of college and the real world. David wanted to be more open about his hobbies as one of his personal goals, but he had a problem. His friends and family, to put it mildly, hated furries and saw them as sex-crazed degenerates, leaving him with the feeling that he needed to keep this part of his life hidden from both family and friends.<br />
<br />
He wouldn&#39;t be able to do that much longer though.<br />
<br />
He saw a light flash, but instead of it coming from the computer screen David was facing, it came from above, casting a glow on the lanky young man. David began to feel his muscles aching, feeling warm, and even feel a bit nauseous as well. His dirty blonde hair took on a platinum-white color, as did the not-quite-developed body hair on him. He’d always thought of himself as a late bloomer puberty-wise, but to be suddenly growing thick white hair wasn’t what he’d expected. These hairs would eventually thicken more into fur, with two layers beginning to cover his body. David jumped as he took off his now-itchy and tight clothing, but this shock was quickly replaced with a sense of euphoria.<br />
<br />
“You wanted this, did you?”  David heard a disembodied female voice, belonging to Agdis, calling to him,<br />
<br />
“I do,” David whispered without thinking, his voice beginning to sound different as his face shifted, his nose and jawline pushing outwards, forming a canine muzzle. David’s nose became wet and black, his sense of smell becoming more powerful than it ever was. Meanwhile, his teeth sharpened and shifted, as more sharp teeth grew to line his expanded jawline. He felt his ears perk up, taking on a pointed shape and moving upwards, increasing his hearing ability. His eyes became like sapphire orbs, contrasting with his new white fur.<br />
<br />
The aching in his muscles began to subside as they grew underneath what was once an undefined, slim body, giving David a lithe and powerful build, fitting for a being with godlike powers, which came from the glowing icy blue runes along his arms and chest, that had been etched along his fur coat.<br />
<br />
Much like his muscles were, David’s arousal had begun to swell. His cock grew, doubling in size, and began to take on a pointed shape, becoming more red, with a ball shape forming at its base to tie himself to a mate. The changing man’s mind began to drift to thoughts of tying himself to a mate. He could care less if this mate were a female or even another male, he was bi after all. He began jacking himself off to please his burning desires, as he stroked his changing dick, his hands developed a leathery padding while his nails turned into claws, the same could be said for his feet, which changed further to develop into a digitigrade stance, the changes continued as a white, thick, fluffy tail emerged from the base of his spine, feeling a gentle tug as it emerged from under him.<br />
<br />
 All the while, his carnal desires became stronger, ultimately sending him over the edge as cum splattered across his table. He growled with a smirk taking a look around at his new furry body, as his mind began to alter, He still remembered his human life and everything up to the transformation that had just happened, but the name “David” no longer sounded right to the former human, “Dormod” sounded more fitting to the white wolf. The sense of awkwardness having to hide himself faded with his human name, as a powerful, magical, anthropomorphic Arctic Wolf emerged in its place. <br />
<br />
Dormod immediately began to think up ways to how he could spread this gift that he was given, to form a pack, make new allies, and perhaps a mate...   </p>
