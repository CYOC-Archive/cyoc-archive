<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel was looking forward to the pot roast cooking in the oven as he held Alexis’s hand for their evening walk. “So no magical changes,” Daniel teased?<br />
<br />
“Not so far, but it’s probably for the best. I was rather preoccupied and not thinking all that clearly this morning. Huge lactating breasts is not something I, or any woman, would desire. Besides the size and weight inconvenience, they would need to be milked. No one would want that.”<br />
<br />
“I would, and I’d happily do the milking,” Daniel leered.<br />
<br />
“Yes you would have, but I don’t think you would have been as keen on it as you expect.”<br />
<br />
Daniel felt his cock hardening at the thought of suckling milk out of huge leaking breasts on Alexis.<br />
<br />
Alexis chuckled quietly seeing Daniel trying to subtly adjust himself. ‘Why are men so turned on by breasts, maybe it’s an unconscious reversion to babyhood? How ironic would that have been,” she smiled.<br />
<br />
Halfway into their walk, Daniel did a double&#8209;take and realized with surprise that Alexis was bouncing and jiggling a lot more boobage now than when they had started out.<br />
<br />
“I wondered when you would notice,” Alexis giggled.<br />
<br />
“But how? Are they real,” Daniel said reaching to cup one of Alexis’s suddenly large breasts, only to have his hand slapped away.<br />
<br />
“What is wrong with you, you can’t do that in public! Yes they’re real, apparently the magic is actually kicking in. We’d better get home.”<br />
<br />
“No argument from me,” Daniel said smiling. “I think they’re getting bigger! How big are they going to get?”<br />
<br />
“You asked for big boobs. I specified an E&#8209;Cup before they begin to swell with milk. I don’t know how large they’ll be fully engorged, that was as large as I was willing to go. Don’t worry, I didn’t stint on your fantasy. As my breasts expand to be ridiculously large and inconvenient for me, they will be even larger for you.”<br />
<br />
“What? That doesn’t make any sense,” Daniel said prying his eyes away from Alexis’s growing cleavage to look her in the eyes.<br />
<br />
Alexis laughed when she saw understanding dawn on Daniel when his mouth dropped open and he realized he was not looking down on her anymore as they now stood eye to eye. “See sweetie, much bigger to you now,” she smirked as she embraced Daniel tightly and kissed him for the very first time without having to crane her neck upward and tiptoe.<br />
<br />
“But …,” was all Daniel could manage.<br />
<br />
“Relax, everything is temporary. We can both change back to normal later. In the mean time, this will be fun,” Alexis said tugging Daniel’s hand to get him moving again.<br />
<br />
When they got back home Alexis gently pushed Daniel. “Go wash up while I check on the pot roast.” As she removed the pot roast from the oven and began setting the table, Alexis felt her breasts growing larger and tighter. “Uh oh!”<br />
<br />
“What the hell did you do,” Daniel demanded running into the kitchen before freezing in shock when he saw that he now stood no taller than Alexis’s belly. Instead of compassionate concern, Alexis grinned gleefully down at him.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god, you are so cute,” Alexis giggled squatting down and pulling Daniel’s face into her now seemingly enormous cleavage before releasing him lest she smother him in breast. “Oh, I want to see,” she declared standing up.<br />
<br />
Before Daniel could respond, he realized he didn’t even reach Alexis’s belly now as she reached down and stripped off all his clothes, leaving him naked with a raging erection in front of a gigantic woman. To add to his indignity, she effortlessly scooped him up and plopped him onto her lap like a small child, grabbed his cock with her thumb and index finger and began jerking him off. It was relentless and magical, the likes of which he’d never experienced.<br />
<br />
‘Oh my god, this is so much fun,’ Alexis thought as she overpowered Daniel and forcibly subjected him to a hand job, ‘or finger job,’ she giggled. She ignored his flailing efforts to speed up and maintained her torturous slow pace as his little hands balled into ineffectual diminutive fists and his faced scrunched up and turned red, culminating in a series of tiny little spurts that must have been ejaculate but it was so little it was difficult to be sure.<br />
<br />
Daniel panted into the giant face of Alexis, but even as he recovered from the hand job his eyes were drawn to Alexis’s breasts. He saw them expand larger and tighter yet again, they were enormous now, it was a sight to behold. When he looked back at Alexis’s face she was even bigger and she simply smiled at him.<br />
<br />
“Well it looks like I get pot roast but you will have to settle for second hand pot roast,” Alexis laughed.<br />
<br />
“What do mean second hand …,” Daniel started to say but stopped when he realized he was only making incoherent noises.<br />
<br />
“I’m guessing you were trying to ask what’s going on. Let me show you.”<br />
<br />
Daniel felt himself whisked upward and only now realized that Alexis was holding him in the crook of one arm as she carried him to the bathroom full length mirror. There in the mirror was a giant Alexis holding a naked little baby. When he tried to turn, the baby in the mirror kicked and flailed. When he tried to talk, he heard nonsensical babbling noises. He felt himself juggled around then held full length before the mirror. “Why did you make me a baby,” he tried to say but again heard nothing but babble. Frustrated at his in ability to communicate, he finally spotted what Alexis wanted to show him and yelled in outrage, but all he heard was a baby crying.<br />
<br />
“You said you wanted me to have big lactating breasts. Not only are they big, but from your perspective they’re gargantuan, so you’re welcome. You also said you would provide the milking I’d need but it’s not just a one and done need. You have to be able to milk me until I can change back, which admittedly I hadn’t fully thought through at the time, so baby. You have no teeth, thank god, so you don’t get first round pot roast, you get it after I process it for you. Last but not least, I had years of baby sitting practice as a teen and every damn one of the boys seemed to delight in peeing on me when I changed their diapers. You will not be doing that little missy!”<br />
<br />
“Now I’m going to have my pot roast dinner, after which I’ll give you your second hand dinner.”<br />
<br />
In a whirl wind of movement, Daniel was diapered, trussed up in a tiny dressing gown, and plopped into a bassinet type thing and propped up on the table to watch Alexis eat pot roast. He tried struggling but it was useless. Instead of escaping, he wore himself out and drifted off to sleep. He wasn’t sure what he’d been dreaming but he was awakened by gentle patting and someone repeatedly calling his name.<br />
<br />
“No sleeping Daniel, these things are painful. It’s time to uphold your end of the deal,” Alexis said lifting Daniel to her bared breast and guiding his mouth onto her very large swollen nipple.<br />
<br />
Daniel briefly thought about refusing, especially since Alexis’s nipple was so large it felt like he was sucking cock, but he was starving.<br />
<br />
Alexis smiled contentedly as Daniel nursed. When her left breast was sufficiently drained, she had to wake Daniel up and plug him in to her still taught right breast. It took a little extra encouragement but he sleepily completed his task and she laid him in the bassinet that seemed to have been created as part of Daniel’s necessary clothing change.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow she’d start on trying to figure out if invoking changes with orgasm worked with her vibrator or whether she needed a partner to give her an orgasm. Hopefully it didn’t require a partner wearing the other ring or Daniel was going to be screwed; not literally of course, at least not until he went through puberty and the boob fairy visited. She knew it was wrong, but the thought made her laugh.</p>
