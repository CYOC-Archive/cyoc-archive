<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a few agonizing moments Chad’s whole world was reduced to the smell and feel of leather as the trenchcoat held him in its tight embrace. He tried to break free, squirming around to get that...that thing to lose grip on him. However all that Chad got from trying to fight the trenchcoat was the damn thing tightening its grip on him even more, wrapping itself tightly around him. <br />
For the most part this just caused him unbearable pain as the garment cramped around his joints forcing them into unnatural and uncomfortable positions. Yet at the same time his cock was also wrapped up tightly by the trenchcoat’s leather flaps, the pressure causing his junk to harden up. To Chad’s surprise the trenchcoat started to move its leader across his shaft in ripping motions. Pleasure mixed into the pain as Chad realising that the coat was jacking him off! <br />
Against his will Chad’s muffled screams turned into muffled moans. He found himself relaxing in the trenchcoat’s leather grip and as he did so the coats somewhat loosened its grip and started to shift about over Chad’s body and face, caressing him with its soft leather hide rather than constricting him. Chad had no clue what was going on, he was still packed up tightly under a layer of impenetrable leather and he was aware that this should distress him. But with the coat pleasuring him like that Chad simply found himself unable to muster up the anger and fear needed to fight the garment so he allowed himself to slip completely under the coat’s influence, relaxing and just enjoying the ride. <br />
He hardly noticed that around him the coats started to transform, the leather becoming almost liquid as the coat melted, losing its shape and definition, closing up all its openings seamlessly. Chad’s arms sank through the melting sleeves into the main body of the coat as the garment completely lost its shape and became little more than a tight leather film surrounding him. As this film tightened more and more around him the combination of sexual pleasure and the consumption of the limited air available to him in his prison finally caused Chad to climax and then pass out, the smell and caress of liquid leather finally giving way to sweet oblivion. Chad did not even have time to be scared. <br />
And so Chad lay there, a featureless, shiny black leather mummy, seamless and completely smooth. At first only vaguely human shaped the mummy slowly gained more definition as the leather seemed to shrink together around Chad’s body, the glossy, black material stretching taut over his well defined muscles. His pecs and abs started to stick out against the leather film, the arms gained definition again, as did the legs and other parts of the body as the leather became a second skin in all but the head, which remained a featureless bubble. <br />
Slowly the leather started to change colour, fading from pitch black to a pale flesh tone, almost like skin. At the same time the bubble around Chad’s head started to change shape, becoming a human face and head with features almost like Chad’s but a bit older, the way Chad might look in his late twenties. Slowly hair started to sprout on the naked skull. Where Chad;s hair was golden and messy, this being’s hair was pitch black and had the appearance of being heavily oiled or pomaded, a effect that came from the hair actually being fine strings of leather.<br />
Now what lay on the floor appeared to be a naked young man, just a little bit bigger and bulkier, and more mature looking than Chad was. But the changes were not yet; without warning the body started to perspire heavily, not normal sweat but droplets of pitch black leather. These droplets expanded and melded with one another covering the beings’ well defined abs, chest, arms, legs, hand, any part under his throat. This new leather film changed shape and became a tight, one-piece leather bodysuit, with something like decorative piping covering nonexistent seams.  The suit incorporated a pair of gloves and thick soled boots but there appeared to be no way for the suit to be put off and indeed the being never again would, it being part of its body.<br />
Then the beings sleeping face sprung to life. A smile spread over its lips and, with a swift movement it, or rather he, heaved himself up from the floor. He smirked and raised his eyebrows as he examined his new body, flexing his tightly gloved hands and rubbing his arms and chest. Yes, this was one sweet body, he was lucky to have caught it. As he rubbed his chest he remembered that under the black leather, under his skin, there was still the form of Chad, now tightly sealed inside of him, all safely wrapped up. His host, his human, his to keep and enjoy. He smiled as he wrapped his arms around his body, almost in an attempt to hug the young man sealed inside him. The boy had no idea yet what great gift he had given the being. <br />
The being raised his eyebrows as he felt a faint stirring and squirming under his skin...Chad was waking up! <br />
The first thing Chad noticed when he came to his senses was that he was suddenly standing, what was up with that? Hadn’t he passed out on the floor? The second thing was that he was still, up to his neck, covered in skin tight leather, while his head was surrounded by something like a hollow leather bubble with just enough room to move his head about slightly and just enough air, heavy with the scent of the leather encasing him, for comfortable breathing.<br />
Finally the last thing Chad noticed was that he was unable to move any part of his body below the neck, he could slightly squirm within his leather confines, but not move, it was as if he was frozen in place. <br />
More annoyed than scared Chad knit his brows, trying against and again to his arms and legs with little success save for slightly more squirming. However Chad did become scarred when he not only started to hear laughter echo through the hollow around his head, but actually felt the rippling of the laughter in his own stomach.<br />
“Good morning Chad,” a deep, manly voice echoed through the hollow as the leather moved slightly. To Chad’s alarm he felt his right arm moving and caressing his chest, “Welcome to the first day of the rest of our life.” <br />
For a split second Chad was too mesmerized to react, but he was still a very assertive young man and he was slowly getting over this shit. Gritting his teeth Chad addressed the voice.<br />
“What are you talking about? And who are you anyway? And where am I?”<br />
There was another rippling laughter and this time Chad almost could feel a sense of slight amusement all around him. <br />
  “Who I am?” the voice asked, “My kind has no names, so the correct question, my dear human, is what I am.” Chad felt himself starting to walk, since the bubble of black leather around his head was still the only thing he could he this sensation of blind walk was quite alarming. He felt like a puppet on a string, moved about by some unseen force.<br />
“I am a being from outside of what you consider reality, a demon if you so will.” Chad’s hands started to caress his chest again, “but don’t worry you will have time to learn all about what I am, or rather what we are. As to where you are, Chad...” there was another sensation of laughter, “...why you are inside me, my human, in fact you are part of me.” The caresses grew stronger, almost sensual, “part of me, forever bonded as one.” <br />
This sent cold showers over Chad’s back, so the trenchcoat had been alive! And now he was trapped inside of it! He once again tried to break out of his prison, but once again all he managed to do was squirm about uselessly. <br />
The demon wrapped Chad’s arms around his body effectively hugging him. “Oh Chad...it feels so good when you squirm.” <br />
Chad gritted his teeth, what was that demon thinking? He would not allow that...that thing to keep him locked up like this forever “Let me out you weirdo!”<br />
The demon laughed again as it continued to walk their body around, finally letting them fall into what felt like a sofa, reclining in it and clasping their hands leisurely behind their head. <br />
“Sorry, not gonna happen, Chad,” he told the human inside him, “you see, I need you in here. You are my human host and I need you to keep my humanoid form.<br />
“But don’t worry Chad being part of a demon is not the worst of fates. Inside of me you will be safe from almost any form of harm, my body will feed and clean and pleasure you. Not only that, but the hormones and nutrients I will pump into you will make sure that you will enjoy a lifespan three times as long as that of other humans.”<br />
The demon caressed their chest and arms again, sensually rubbing their muscles, against his will Chad felt their cock harden.<br />
“And what a life it will be,” the demon said wistfully, “sealed safe inside me, forever, sealed form all danger and from the world. People will look upon me, talk to me, touch me and even be fucked by me and never know that you are inside of me. And likewise you will never know of them, for you see my body will block out all outside stimuli from you expect those that originate from me. From now on, human, I am your entire universe.” <br />
Slowly their hand wandered down into their crotch, the demon starting to stroke their shared cock.<br />
“We are one now, you and I, you are part of me, Chad. I suggest to you that you accept your fate, just relax and enjoy the ride from now on,” there was laughter again, “it’s not like you ahve any other choice anyway...” <br />
Chad wanted to protest, but the pleasure from the demon working their cock, tightly sealed inside its leather prison, was too much. Slowly Chad felt his mind grow cloudy. Yes...maybe he should give in...</p>
