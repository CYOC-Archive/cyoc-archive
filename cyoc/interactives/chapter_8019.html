<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Theta Outpost Division was quiet. Of course that was to be, expected Theta Division was on the other side of the quarantine zone. Like other bases around the area, it had been built just in case of this very disaster. When the dump had occurred and the outbreak began the base was evacuated don to a skeleton crew so that their numbers could bolster the bases closer to the infection to better contain and capture infections. What was left was to maintain the perimeter and capture anything that wandered their way.<br />
	Jonah Lynn was in the Theta division he was the techie of their group who ran the computers and communication systems. So far Theta division had been lucky the infected creatures had for the past few hours stayed near the source of the infection and had not moved out they hadn’t gone anywhere endear Theta division which on the map was far out of the way of the infected zone hadn't been swamped with work. Not that they hadn’t run into some a while ago Duke and Tom had brought in two morphs, a fox and a coyote they had trapped, but so far thankfully there had been few others even remotely sighted. It was a good think because besides Jonah there were only six other staff members at the base. Technically, right now, though he was the only one at the base the rest were out in small parties of two patrolling and looking out for more breaches that were possible. It was a lot of ground to cover but fortunately, enough a natural edifices created walls that it would be very difficult, and very noticeable to try to get out of this area. Theta base was directly in a valley surround by cliffs and a large river. A valley that had been studied by the top tacticians money could buy. The base was locate dint he perfect spot to catch any one using a direct path out of the valley and the teams need only check certain key spots regularly to maintain their wall. In a sense, the Theta base was one of the easiest Perimeters to maintain because of this. <br />
	In Jonah’s opinion, it was also the most boring. The past hour had been filled with listening to static as a radio silence had commenced at the order of central command, AKA the Board of Directors. Only Primary systems and those in the red zone of infection were to communicate openly the rest could only send out communication under heavy threat and would only receive communication if the Division Directors deemed it necessary. Barring that nothing was supposed to be heard the Corporation was worried about the media or a leak in the system. Jonah thought this was over kill and more then a little dangerous as some people, especially the uniformed tended not to like asking for help and in the threat of something like this is was hard to judge when one needed help.<br />
Well he was not paid the big bucks so who cared what he thought. <br />
Jonah stretched in his chair. This was going nowhere fast. No communication nothing happening to the computers and no information. He might as well check on the ‘guests’ and feed Sergeant. Sergeant was his Russian blue cat. He had raised Sergeant forma kitten and loved his kitty very dearly as his best friend. The people stationed at the base all knew about Sergeant, despite it being against the rules, they had kept quiet, and he had become the unofficial mascot of Theta Division and an unofficial member of the team. In fact, sergeant had the run of the tiny base because he was such a clean and well-behaved cat. Jonah smiled he had trained Sergeant well. Getting up from his chair he left the small communications office and went walked down the hall towards the bunker room where everyone slept. When the call had gone out to go to Condition Red Jonah had left his cat with everyone else and had not fed him. By now he would have one angry kitty because of that it had been hours and dinner had come and gone for Sergeant. Well he would feed the cat, go check on the tiny one cell prison they had for the mutated freaks, and then bring his cat into the communication and computer room for some quality cuddle time. <br />
Unknown to Jonah mere moments after he had left the computer virus that had been released by Mac Blocker hit his systems. Or would have if Jonah in fear of his won boredom and breaking the silence hadn’t disconnected all the computers from the main network and created a smaller one for the base. He had accidentally saved quiet a repository of data on the virus by accident. Only one computer had been hit. <br />
	Jonah walked down to the bunker humming to himself. Maybe eh would also grab his boom box and listen to some tunes nothing was going to happen out here and tomorrow he may be called into a more active area to help with this disaster. However, it seemed so far away this late at night and at this distance, he did not worry too much. He should have worried though. <br />
Unknown to Jonah there had been a small bio leak thanks to a much panicked fox morph. Peter Jones had ostensibly cleaned it up but the virus itself was a very durable and tenacious beast and it was not so easily removed from the floor. Sergeant earlier that day had cut his paw walking about it was a very small cut he dint even have a limp. Jonah did not even know about it but he virus did. It had entered Sergeant over to hours ago and had been coursing through his body ever since. <br />
Sergeant had been for an infected animal moderately well behaved mainly entertaining himself by eating Jonah’s cookie stash with some jerky and water and then curling up his anthropomorphic body to relax and lounge on the bed as no cat had ever lounged before. Of course, he had heard Jonah coming closer to the bunker by now his sensitive ears perking up. He smiled he did love that human who had been so kind to him. How could he ever return the favor? Sergeant felt a stirring in his crotch and smiled he had been horny lately and he knew Jonah was as well perhaps some mutual fun would be nice.<br />
Of course, Sergeant had no idea this would spread the virus and transmute his human friend. He quietly groomed himself of some stray cookie crumbs and made ready for his friend’s arrival.<br />
Jonah had no idea of any of this of course as he walked towards the bunker door. He hard an odd noise from the room where they were keeping the mutations it dint sound like a break out but Jonah wondered if eh should check on it. On the other hand Sergeant had been waiting long enough and really those two animals couldn’t get out very easily and if they did it would trigger alarms.</p>
