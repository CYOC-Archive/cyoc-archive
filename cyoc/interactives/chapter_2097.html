<span class="sprite sprite-adult adult-x-v" title="Sex beyond any of the above + violence"></span></div>
<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul got out his dick and played with it while he tried to decide what to do next.  It was aggravating.  He wanted the sex, but he was uncomfortable with how this was all happening -- she shrinking, having sex with another guy, now all these obsessive thoughts.  As Paul stroked himself, he looked down at his boner.  Feeling frustrated and increasingly confused, he realized: HE didn't want this plant, but his dick did!
<br />

<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; he said, &quot;You want it, you can have it.&quot;  He folded the foil in a V shape, to create a little spout and then crushed the plant with all the force that his manliness could muster.  Clear drops dripped from the spout, and he steered them onto his throbbing rod.  One went down the hole, and the others spread around his head and shaft.  Paul crumpled the foil up the rest of the way, tossing it into the trash.  He sat back on his bed and said, &quot;So THERE!&quot;.
<br />

<br />
At first, nothing happened, and Paul and his dick stared at each other.  Finally, it looked like his dick was starting to list to one side and wobble as it went soft.  As Paul let out a relieved sigh, he started to feel heat building up in his penis.  At first, it was just warmness, but then it started to get uncomfortably hot.  Instead of getting softer, it was getting harder -- a LOT harder.
<br />

<br />
But it was also getting shorter!  Paul gaped as his eight-inch-plus pole, the one he had had since he was 16, started to retreat into the bushy hairs of his pubes.  He reached for something to wipe himself off with, but it was too late.  The drops had been absorbed into his skin.  His head began to swim as he pulled on his dick, shortening and thinning in his grasp.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Uhhh, come on&quot; he said as his treasured penis shrank to a merely average six inches.  He felt his balls tightening up too.  Were they shrinking too?  They were such beauties.  Paul knew that he'd been blessed with especially large genitals, his pride &amp; joy really, and now in a fit of anger he seemed poised to lose it all.  He had to get this stuff off -- now!
<br />

<br />
He stood up and lurched towards the bathroom as his dick shrank further, now only a little bit longer than his fist.  He felt his hand starting to get moist as he took another step, and a shiver ran from his balls to his brains as his small prick started to shoot.
<br />

<br />
This wasn't like any orgasm Paul had ever had before.  His whole body shook with each shot of his tiny rod.  He stumbled towards the bathroom, knowing that he needed to wash off, but each step was a battle.  As his cannon shrank with each shot, every one was more forceful, more intense, and more pleasurable than the last.
<br />

<br />
Somehow he reached his sink, his boner still sending up wave after wave of jizz.  Putting his hands on the counter, he released that his whole body had shrunk, not just his dick.  But his dick was so much smaller that he hadn't noticed anything else.  His nipples were coming down to the edge of the sink, so he turned away and lurched into the shower curtain.
<br />

<br />
He pulled the knobs and collapsed to the floor of the tub, feeling the cold water only dimly as his orgasm blotted everything out.  Racked by contraction after contraction, he lost consciousness.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
He woke up with the cold blast of water from the shower still pounding his body.  He didn't know how long he had layed there, and since he hadn't turned on the warm water, the temperature was no gauge.  The first thing he did was kick the water off, with stiff and cold muscles.  Standing up, he pulled out a towel and tried to clear his head.  What happened?
<br />

<br />
He didn't have to look far.  As he brought the towel down from his head, he saw a trail of wet spots leading out into the room, and he remembered his incredible trip into the bathroom.  He realized that it could have been the best experience of his life if he hadn't freaked out.
<br />

<br />
Stepping over to the mirror, he sized himself up, literally.  He looked OK.  His height seemed to be no worse for the wear.  He went out into the bedroom, afraid to confront his dick.  He could feel his balls moving comfortably, just like they always did, so they were probably fine.  As he sat on his bed, he felt his dick.  It seemed small, but it was also pulled up tight from the cold water.  He layed on his back and played with himself, trying to get it to stiffen up, but he was just too spent.
<br />

<br />
Sitting back up, he took the towel into the bathroom.  On his way back to his bed, he spotted the foil glinting in the trash can.  He waivered.  The last thing he wanted was more of that damn plant in his life.  But he really had to know what was going on.  Gingerly, he went over to the wastebasket and sniffed.  Nothing.  He held it close in front of his face and took a deep breath, trying to smell that magical aroma one more time.
<br />

<br />
His dick told him he'd been successful even before his nose had, as he felt it throbbing back to life.  Setting the trash down, he moved over to the bed to see the size of things.  Fully hard now, he stroked his dick softly.  It was definitely smaller.  Quite a bit smaller.  Average, from the looks of it, and getting softer.
<br />

<br />
Beaten, he turned out the light and went to sleep.</p>
