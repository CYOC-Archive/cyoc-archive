<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the drag queen and the twink were panicking and trying to find the two college boys, Zac and Terry were enjoying the buzz and the thrills after their little drink. None the wiser about the changes beginning to hit their bodies before long. It took a bit of liquid courage, after all, to get some men to loosen up and just enjoy the music and the intensity of the situation. And both Zac and Terry had just had some pretty high concentration alcohol, so they were in a state where they were primed to go up there and do things they wouldn&#39;t dare to do otherwise. Let alone the magical effects of their drink, which had a further effect upon their impulse control.<br />
<br />
For Zac, who had always been the wild one out of the pair, this manifested most strongly and obviously. He was on the dance floor, no longer even caring who he ended up dancing alongside, or up against, or grinding his groin against. He figured that this was supposed to be his big day of experimentation. Of showing that he wasn&#39;t afraid to try new things - even when those new things were experiences. Zac was shaking his head back and forth, letting his hair fly in his face and then back, a big grin on his face as he felt someone starting to grind their hips against his ass, while he was himself pressing up against what he figured felt like someone at least feminine. Maybe it was a woman, maybe it was a winsome twink, but at the moment, Zac didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
This was the moment of experimentation, and the drinks were certainly giving him the bravado to abandon his misgivings and any trepidation about embracing what that really meant. He wasn&#39;t sure if he could handle actual sex - like, with an actual man, but for right now, dancing and enjoying the presence of the Cafe&#39;s regulars was really doing it for him. Zac could feel a surging sense of excitement. Every moment he spent on the floor, he felt stronger, more vibrant, more energetic...!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Terry was mingling with people on the dance floor more openly, more enthusiastically. To tell the truth, Terry had always had a bit of a problem with masculine expectations. He was supposed to be one thing, but also something else, but also keep to one standard or another...it was exhausting and he had never really lived up to the kind of man his dad had expected of him. But now, as he felt people talking about what a hot daddy he looked like, Terry felt validated. Sure, he wasn&#39;t exactly into guys, but hearing people liking him. Actually appreciating him. Talking him up instead of tearing him down...it felt amazing.<br />
<br />
Sure, Terry was feeling a little itchy here and there. His jawline, his chest, his stomach, his legs...fuck, but this was a little bit of a situation. But he could forget about that for right now, much like he was pushing aside the problems he had in favor of a moment&#39;s lack of control thanks to the club&#39;s drinks. He had no idea what in all went into that shit, but he was for sure going to be coming back here for another serving in the future. Especially if he had a date. He didn&#39;t want to come off like some kind of cringy shy wallflower when a date wanted to go out and do something...<br />
<br />
Of course, it was more than just their trepidations and their wariness being torn down. Even as the two of them, separated by an ocean of men, danced the night away in the slowly filling quarters of the night club, a transformation was working its way through their bodies. The cold liquid courage of the Mariposa-laced drinks filling their veins with a potent shift. Yet an imperfect, incomplete one - because even as their bodies shifted, their minds stayed the same.<br />
<br />
Zac was growing bigger even as he danced and grinded against various people. But that was hardly all. His skin was starting to tan, to grow more and more sun-kissed. Every moment it seemed another muscle group gained the attention of the drink that so changed him. His pecs pushed out into an imposing shelf already, even as they were hardly done. His abs began to sculpt underneath his shirt, which in turn started to press out a little more. Beginning to grow into an early impression of a stage bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
His arms puffed out with muscles, his biceps swelling into a shape akin to something like a thick baseball, even his forearms begun to swim with veins, his hands likewise growing a bit larger with the influence of so much more testosterone, though hardly all of it was natural. His triceps swelled so strongly that stretch marks begun to show along the fringes. A thick cord of muscle swelling up along the tricep, giving the impression of a solid horseshoe. His shoulders in turn, as he humped the ass of a transwoman who eagerly relished the attention, grew larger and thicker at every spot.<br />
<br />
The front delt, then the rear delt, then the lateral deltoid. Thickening and strengthening, pushing out the material of his shirt. Beginning to tear at his sleeves. His lats in turn began to swell, the creaking of his shirt barely even registering to the changing college boy. A few rips in the fabric along the underarm and further down hinted at just how wide he might end up being that night. As he danced, he shook his leg once to ease out what he thought was some odd tension...<br />
<br />
That being his legs beginning to grow. The quads and thighs bulging with muscle, testing the limits of his jeans as he frolicked amidst the numerous diverse forms upon the dance floor. Even his feet swelled a bit and pressed against his shoes.<br />
<br />
And Zac&#39;s nipples began to swell, such that when one of the women on the dance floor brushed her hand against his chest in that heat of frivolous abandon, Zac bit his lip and almost felt his eyes roll back from the sheer pleasure. He knew for sure that his next hook-up was gonna need to incorporate a bit of nipple play if that was any indicator. And of course, enmeshed so in the dance, Zac couldn&#39;t have seen his hair beginning to re-style. Turning to frosted tips and slightly styled back.<br />
<br />
Speaking of sheer pleasure, Zac&#39;s cock began to swell within his pants. Forming a decidedly masculine bulge in the front of his pants, his manhood growing more sensitive as his bush was trimmed away. Across his body, any trace of body hair was almost completely lasered off. Leaving him cleanshaven and sensitive. Yet even as he did so, his balls slightly shrank - a tell tale sign that the new Zac had a couple habits, namely, Testosterone, Dianabol and Trenbolone. His ass in turn grew tighter, more toned, a bubble butt forming and pressing against the rear of his jeans. Giving him quite a good impression to any of the men dancing there.<br />
<br />
Let alone the anus contained there, which despite the absence of mental changes as to make Zac more queer, was formed as if it was well used to pleasure and being handled. Suffice to say, if Zac was touched back there, he was in for quite a pleasant surprise.<br />
<br />
At the same exact time...<br />
<br />
Terry&#39;s form was shifting in a different direction. Hair thickened on his chin, jawline, and upper lip, growing in and becoming denser. Not quite a full beard yet, but it was looking increasingly like Terry simply didn&#39;t shave that day, and thus had a substantial amount of thick stubble. But the stage was set there.<br />
<br />
As far as his body however... his chest, shoulders and lats bulged at once, growing much the same as his friend. Terry, as addled as he was, hardly even noticed except to figure that he probably needed some new clothes. Not even as his seam popped on his shirt, and showed a bit more of his shoulder than usual. But as his chest filled out, and pressed against the v-neck of his t-shirt, straining the fabric at that part of the shirt, one might be able to see thicker and thicker hairs beginning to grow at the upper chest.<br />
<br />
It was a similar story across Terry&#39;s midsection and even his back and legs. He was growing ever more hirsute, looking more like a mature manly man and less like a college boy. Even his arms, as they thickened with raw, hefty muscle, grew a good bit of hair across them. Nothing compared to what was to come, but giving a good impression of where he was going. <br />
<br />
In contrast to the rippling, powerful abs on his friend, Terry&#39;s midsection bloated and grew wider and larger. Growing into a large belly that strained at his shirt, a few more tears beginning to be visible across his top. Then a bit of his new belly hung over his midsection, making Terry grumble that he might need to cut back on the chips as he scratched his groin briefly. Not noticing as he did so, his cock turned thicker but slightly smaller, his balls enlargening and filling out his underwear. Giving him quite a bulge as well.<br />
<br />
Terry&#39;s legs thickened and grew, matching his ass as it too fattened, thickening up. There wasn&#39;t all that much tone in the body being made for Terry, but the sheer size was pretty incredible. By now though, Terry was groaning - wondering if his clothes shrank in the wash. He wondered if he and Zac could just...find someone to help them experiment or whatever. Anyone they figured would be best. And then they could just go home.<br />
<br />
Sure this was fun, but Terry didn&#39;t want to ruin his clothes.<br />
<br />
And ironically, as Terry danced, the addition of his body and facial hair meant that Billy didn&#39;t even recognize him despite getting a really good description by Ginger. He wiggled and moved through the crowds, letting interested parties and former lovers know that he was on business from the bar tonight - and thus, he was incapable of reciprocating anything right now at least. Billy for his part felt <i>terrible</i> about this. He might have shown a blithe front at some points, but once his boss had filled him in a little more about what Mariposa could do, he was just grateful he hadn&#39;t mixed in the mental changes drink. <br />
<br />
<i>Geez, Spain sounded like a fucking mess. And going by what she told me, those two could get up to any number of problems just with the physical changes.</i> Billy looked down, clenching a fist, <i>And I put them in that mess. This is worse than that time I got into it with Beau. Really should&#39;ve listened to Miss Spyce on that one. Red flags for days with that guy...</i><br />
<br />
And Billy looked dead on at Terry, not even recognizing him, &quot;Man, we got some pretty hot folks here tonight. Haah, fuck, fuck, no...no, focus Billy, focus...&quot; Turning away from Terry, he said, &quot;You gotta find Terry and uh, and Zac.&quot;</p>
