<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">'It's strange,' Kaylee thought, 'When my parents were still human I told Master I calmly <br />
accepted whatever fate happened for them... but I really was scared for both Master and <br />
my parents when the fight broken out. Though it really isn't right to call Kevin and Marcy <br />
my parents anymore. We are all part of the pack that serves Master, the Big Bad Wolf.'<br />
<br />
Given Bart had described the basement as the 'dark and stinky place' the she-wolves and <br />
their sense of smell were still stuck eyeballing for it's location carrying around the giant <br />
rug. Not that the rug was really heavy for them at all, but it was an odd shape. <br />
<br />
With Little Red Riding Wolf leading, in spite of her internal monolog managed to lead the <br />
she wolves in the discovery of the basement door, it wasn't locked, but Kaylee was <br />
tempted to rip off the hinges all the say. It was an annoyance for the seven foot talk she-<br />
wolves to squeeze through the door carrying the huge rug. <br />
<br />
While their night vision took care of the 'dark' park of the basement, the 'stinky' aspect <br />
was different all together. The she-wolves started at the smell. Their noses didn't just <br />
detect the scents a human being would, but could practically smell the entire -history- of <br />
the basement, every broken pipe, everything and anything that had even slightly gone to <br />
mold. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whao.&quot; The twins chorused. <br />
<br />
&quot;My sentiments exactly.&quot; Kaylee said. <br />
<br />
The smell of ashes and wood chips made finding the secondary furnace a breeze. Much <br />
like the smell of iodine and anti-botics had made Darla finding the first aid kit a breeze <br />
set aside from the gas furnace. <br />
<br />
&quot;If there's a leak at least sister we'll know it instantly.&quot; Fran said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right sister.&quot; Darla nodded. <br />
<br />
Fran went over the wood furnace (having used one before when her family had gone to <br />
that cabin in the dead of winter that one year), and began set up the heat.<br />
<br />
Kaylee thought, &quot;You know with our fur we aren't going to be getting much use out of <br />
these things, as mammals we produce our own body heat.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran and Darla nodded, &quot;Yes Alpha female.&quot; They said in tandem. It gave Kaylee a warm <br />
fuzzy feeling when they did that, it reminded her of just how powerful the Transform was. <br />
<br />
Darla and Kaylee unrolled the bloody and peed on rug that had been once upon a time <br />
quite a price tag. It might have been more logical to simply scrub and wash it, but such an <br />
act for the Smiths was hardly out of character.<br />
<br />
Soon a fire was going in the stove much to Fran's satisfaction, and the heat slowly radiated <br />
out to the she-wolves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's get this done as fast as possible,&quot; Kaylee said, &quot;I hate leaving the master alone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He's not alone.&quot; Darla pointed out. <br />
<br />
&quot;He has the cubs with him.&quot; Fran finished. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I mean!&quot; There was also the matter of the bandaged leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha female.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee finally remembered what Jensen had sent his mate along for and began to with her <br />
claws and strength tear the rug into bite size pieces for the furnace. With amazing <br />
efficiently the twins began to hand off and feed the rug to the waiting furnace, the smell <br />
of their master's blood and the marking of Marcy and Kevin coming out in the flames. <br />
<br />
Fast they worked, and diligently they worked too, after all, the master given them this task, <br />
and thus it was their reason for living at the moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are still thinking about Julie aren't you sister.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Only a little.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whose Julie?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My/Fran's wife.&quot; The twins answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am only thinking of her a little. She is nice but the master is nicer. And I love my <br />
daughters but I love the pack more Alpha Female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you still have the game right?&quot; Kaylee asked, &quot;Maybe you can Transform or Dare her <br />
and your daughters into nice new ladies for the master to mate with.&quot;<br />
<br />
The idea of her daughters being age progressed into women and making love to the <br />
master didn't feel wrong to Fran in the least. &quot;I'm sorry Alpha Female, but it's simply too <br />
risky. My wife right now has nothing but a bunch of dead ends to search. And my family <br />
vanishing might cause more questions than answers. I can risk master or his pack like <br />
that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; Kaylee wanted to say something more, and thus would have easily said more and <br />
then some, but remember what the master had been saying about her impulsiveness and <br />
thought that running out into town and transforming Fran's family right now WOULD get <br />
to much attention. The pack was less than a day old. If they moved too fast they'd trip and <br />
fall on their face. <br />
<br />
Sooner than later, the rug was nothing but ashes and little bit going up the chimney. <br />
<br />
Kaylee looked around the basement, like any basement it had a very impressive collection <br />
of junk that was screaming to be sold off on E-Bay and would otherwise never see the <br />
light of day again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Next order of business after we've had time to settle down is organize and sell this junk! <br />
It's just taking up room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Alpha female.&quot; The twins echoed. <br />
<br />
Kaylee imagined how large master's pack could grow, and as self proclaimed alpha female, <br />
she also imagined herself the one whose duty it would be to figure out and consider <br />
people who would make useful pack members. Of course, using the game on a person to <br />
person bases was going to get clunky fast. 'Maybe we can figure out a way to use the <br />
Transform and Dare to trigger a big bad wolf transformation automatically when certain <br />
conditions are met? Of course we'd need to transform someone who'd contain the trigger.' <br />
Kaylee could be clever when she wanted to be, she could just be a bit oblivious at times. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's get back to Master Jensen, he knows this place better than any of us, and we'll need <br />
him to figuring out the ins and outs of our new home.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right Alpha female.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And I'd rather think it's best that he doesn't have to worry about having all the cubs to <br />
himself.&quot; Fran said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Or him all to the cubs.&quot; Darla added, the twins giggled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about that, the master will handle them more or less or a little bit, but all the <br />
same we shouldn't dally when there is much to be done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran lead the way, not without the rug to carry and knowing where they were going, the <br />
she-wolves moved incredibly fast, nearly knocking the basement door off it's hinges as <br />
they went. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen had asked Bart straight up what needed to be done to make sure the wolf pack <br />
could live on the estate without getting attention. <br />
<br />
Of course, Jensen only had a high school education on economics, and as Jennifer had <br />
slept through half of them (who hadn't?). Bart's collage education and beyond on the <br />
subject really went over Jensen's head. <br />
<br />
When Bart saw that the master was looking at him with somewhat glazed eyes,  he started <br />
over and began in more simpler terms.<br />
<br />
 Jenny meanwhile, began dividing profiles of the on site into the 'Transform or Dare' pile <br />
and the 'Let Go' pile. She'd have divided it further into transform or dare piles, but there <br />
was that very annoying bit of 'free will' to deal with of anyone asked the game. <br />
<br />
Jenny also found a bit to write a very detailed and formal and precise e-mail to Jenny's <br />
high-school that Jennifer would be dropping out and taking on a private tutor. Kevin <br />
accessing his e-mail account on-line did the same thing for Kyle. <br />
<br />
Marcy meanwhile felt a little out of place as everyone had a job to do right now except her. <br />
So instead she sat next to Jesen and listened as he listened about Bart's explanation. <br />
<br />
&quot;So if the people I ask chose Dare, we can use them to run off site holdings, if they chose <br />
transform, we can use them to either add to the pack or serve the pack alternately.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alternately?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does the Transform just change people into wolfs or animal people?&quot; Bart asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it seems to have almost no limit on what it can change people into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In that case I have several ideas, but the REAL problem is finding people no one would <br />
miss or those whose up and leaving would never be investigated.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen nodded following so far. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll run up a list but until the voice synthesizers arrive we'll have to do business by e-mail <br />
and Bartholomew Smith and Jennifer Senior will have terrible colds.&quot;</p>
