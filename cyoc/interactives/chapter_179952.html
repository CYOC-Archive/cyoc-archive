<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Milla had become more ingratiated with the owners of the Katz Klub since she started working there. It wasn&#39;t just that Milla was helping them update their disco for more modern dancers and expanding it for more room. Ella and Simone seemed to really take a liking to Milla, in more ways than one. They certainly liked her suggestions for improving their disco, they liked the music she was bringing in, and they seemed to enjoy her company. But Milla&#39;s more sensitive jaguar nose has been picking up scents of arousal from both of them when they talked. It could have easily been to each other, they were a very prominent lesbian couple. But Milla had been smelling arousal when she was talking with them one-on-one.<br />
<br />
Not that Milla wasn&#39;t uninterested herself. She considered herself bi, or at least she called herself bi that she may as well be. It was a little hard to say for sure. It wasn&#39;t that Milla hadn&#39;t been out on dates before. But these dates typically didn&#39;t involve the person she was with so much as the numerous selfies, posts, and other media updates that accompanied them. Looking back, Milla admitted she really was self-centered. In older times, she might have been the kind of person who spent all their time in front of a mirror. But now she was spending her time with actual people. In fact, Ella and Simone had invited Milla back to their place for some &#39;fun&#39;. Milla had a pretty good idea what that &#39;fun&#39; would be.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Milla was dressed casually as she went to the door of Ella and Simone&#39;s penthouse. If she was correct, she might not be wearing her clothes for much longer. Simone all but confirmed this when she answered the door. The panthress was only wearing a leopard-print bikini set. At least that&#39;s what it looked like at first glance. Closer inspection revealed that they were a bra and panties. Milla reacted accordingly, &quot;I thought panthers were supposed to be stealthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing wrong with showing off,&quot; said Simone coquettishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simone, quit lingering in the doorway and let her in,&quot; called Ella&#39;s voice. Simone stepped aside and let Milla in. It turned out Ella wasn&#39;t much more dressed. She was also wearing leopard-print underwear, but at least she had a dressing gown over them. Of course, said gown wasn&#39;t tied up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you think this is a little gauche?&quot; asked Milla.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but you know how hard it is to find jaguar-print underwear?&quot; asked Ella, &quot;I mean, I bet Miss Vivian could get some for us, but that stuff isn&#39;t woven overnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean blatantly asking me to come over for a threesome,&quot; said Milla.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not against that, are you?&quot; asked Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily, but I think we could have gotten to know each other first,&quot; said Milla.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s part of the reason why we called over,&quot; said Ella, &quot;We do want to get to know you better. Like what your life was before converting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Milla shrugged and said, &quot;Not much to say, really. I was so engrossed with making an online presence that I was neglecting my real life. Thankfully, I had enough real-life friends who saw I needed an intervention. I needed...something to get me off the addiction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t really need a conversion to fix,&quot; said Simone conversationally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably, but they thought it would keep my mind off of social media. And I have to say it works. I&#39;ve been paying more attention to what&#39;s around me for just being there rather than how I could post it online,&quot; said Milla, &quot;And I really owe to you two for helping draw me out and really live life for itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a long pause before Simone asked, &quot;But you&#39;re still open to a threesome, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, absolutely,&quot; said Milla, &quot;I just wanted to say that first. I have no compunction about being in a threesome at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how about we make add a plus two?&quot; asked Ella before snapping her fingers, something that requires a bit of practice for padded paw hands.<br />
<br />
At that, Frank and Tom came out of another room. Unsurprisingly, they were also wearing leopard-print underwear. &quot;Whoa, didn&#39;t think you girls were that open,&quot; said Milla.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do love each other, but we know we&#39;re bi now,&quot; said Simone, &quot;We just have our callcats for some special occasions. And potential fathering material.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like I should have brought my own,&quot; said Milla.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;ll be time for that later,&quot; said Simone before placing a kiss on Milla&#39;s lips. Milla soon found herself melting into the kiss. But not so much that she didn&#39;t turn to kiss Ella when she joined in. The three of them were starting to fondle each other as they worked on removing Milla&#39;s clothes. Milla hadn&#39;t felt this good since she had converted...<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Milla herself wasn&#39;t all that certain if becoming an Animalian would help with her problem. But she wasn&#39;t about to pass up on the opportunity. It didn&#39;t take a lot of thinking to decide what she wanted to be. It came down to either leopards or jaguars. And considering there was already plenty of leopard Animalians and Milla was of Hispanic heritage, she soon went with jaguar.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, just how big am I going to get?&quot; asked Milla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;ve come to expect a certain standard when it comes to Animalians,&quot; said Judy, &quot;The jaguar isn&#39;t as big a cat as a tiger, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be lacking muscle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I meant more like this,&quot; said Milla, holding her hands out in front of her modestly-sized breasts.<br />
<br />
Judy rolled her eyes a bit and said, &quot;You&#39;re not going to be disappointed.&quot; After applying the shot, she told Milla the customary &#39;Welcome to Animalia&#39; before leaving her alone.<br />
<br />
Milla watched with excitement as her transformation began. Her skin tickled as more hair was pushed out before thickening into fur. As her fur spread, she gained the characteristic rosettes of a jaguar. They were larger and more spread out than a leopard, one of a few ways of telling the difference between the two. Milla grunted as she felt a sudden surge in her core, followed by her muscles bulking up. Jaguars may not be as big as lions and tigers, but they were bigger than every other cat. As such, Milla did become a bit taller, if only because her legs were longer because of digitigrade paws.<br />
<br />
More feline traits were becoming more prominent. Her fingers and toes now had large, retractable claws. Her lower spine bunched up before growing out a tail. It wasn&#39;t as long as the other big cats, considering jaguars have the shortest among them, but it was at least long enough to encircle her waist. The most painful part was the cracking her jaw made as it changed. Her head was rounder and wider than a leopard, which made sense considering how a jaguar&#39;s jaw is one of the most powerful among cats, again only ranking under lions and tigers.<br />
<br />
Milla got more excited as she became too large for her clothes, which wasn&#39;t just because of the muscles. Her shirt was ripping apart against her breasts, which had swollen well into D-cups by now. Speeding up the process, Milla applied her new claws to her shirt, tearing apart the bra underneath easily. Jaguars couldn&#39;t really purr, but she made something close to that sound as she fondled her new breasts. A hand slipped down under her pants, which were also ripping, to relieve some growing tension. Milla grinned as she started getting herself off. There was a lot to be gained by being a jaguar.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Of course, that experience was only half as good as her first frolic with the lions and panthers. Milla moaned as Frank plowed into her. She had her choice between him and Tom, but how often can a girl say she got fucked by a lion? Well, more often than there used to be. And while Frank was attending to her, Milla was licking out Ella&#39;s pussy. Milla learned how to use her feline tongue very fast. Of course, she had to also be gentle so her raspy tongue wouldn&#39;t hurt Ella. Meanwhile, Simone and Tom were going at it at one time. Milla would probably be joining them once she and the lions finished up. This was certainly something Milla could see herself doing more often. She&#39;ll have to find her own jaguar so things can be more even.</p>
