<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With what seemed like a herculean effort, Jeff lifted his head up and away from his own cock. Horrified and ashamed at what he&#39;d started to do, he stared at his forepaws and was only able to think, &quot;Shit. I&#39;ve even started licking myself like dog would,&quot; as he lowered his leg.<br />
<br />
His cock still hard, need still demanding, he wasn&#39;t sure how to deal with it. Knowing he’d have eventually, that it didn’t seem like ignoring it this time would be a solution, he was unsure how he felt about the idea that he might give in and start to lick himself again. Grasping his shirt so it was pinched betwixt his paws, which he noted were still transforming as the pads formed, he tried not to think about his dick as he struggled a minute to get the garment back on. Clumsy, lacking the dexterity he was used to, it took him several tries before he managed to do a weird combination of him wiggling into the shirt as he managing to get on over his head. Turning his attention to his pants and jeans, Jeff already saw the chances of him getting them back on was hopeless.<br />
<br />
Frustrated he&#39;d have to go about nude from the waist down, he tried to get them on anyway, but in the end kicked them away. Without anyway to grip them, pull them up, he found that no matter how much he wriggled, he was unable to get them on. Standing, his balance shifting because of how his feet now rested, he almost fell a couple times as he took a couple tottering steps. Feeling like should drop to all fours, he resisted the urge to do so as he exited the living room. Striving to get used to going about on feet that didn&#39;t fully rest on the ground, he wandered aimlessly, ignoring his parent&#39;s bedroom and his sister&#39;s bedroom, both of which something within in kept him from entering.  Heading instead for the room on the other side of the his mom and dad&#39;s room, what had been converted into a laundry and sewing room, he curled up on the dog bed and blankets that he had discovered shortly after he found his bedroom was no longer his room.<br />
<br />
On one hand, he understood he had wanted to use the Chronivac to do exactly what was happening to him. He&#39;d thought it&#39;d be great to become a house pet for a bit, then use the programme to change himself back using timer. But, on the other hand, he kenned that what had happened, how his first major change meant losing the use of his hands and having his feet morph, hadn&#39;t been what he&#39;d expected. Not sure what the first change would have been, Jeff felt that if he&#39;d been able to decide, he&#39;d made sure the loss of the use of his hands would&#39;ve been last. Thinking over everything that had happened, he didn&#39;t even consider losing his ability to speak his first change, as it seemed natural to him that he shan&#39;t have the capability of human speech. Turning over, his still erect shaft brushing against the soft blankets he now slept curled up under, Jeff grunted at the feel of the soft material against the exposed skin of his penis, and his thoughts still on how it was he was to manage to turn himself back, as he didn&#39;t want to live the rest of his life as a dog, he didn&#39;t pay no mind to what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Rhythmic in his actions, he spread his legs a bit as he started to thrust back and forth. Arousal growing, he uttered a series of noises to announce how great what he was doing felt. Oblivious to how he&#39;d gone from licking himself like a dog to humping his bedding the way a randy canine would, Jeff opened his mouth. Tongue lolling out, he started to pant and as the pads on his paws became more pronounced and his tongue flattened to become less a human one and more a dog&#39;s muscular organ. Movements came faster, harder, until with a series of very doggy articulations, Jeff felt himself climax. Knowing if he still was able to he&#39;d be groaning in pleasure, he waited until the sensation like he was blowing his load passed before he pushed himself away. Staring at the blankets he&#39;d just used to satisfy himself, glad for the first time since it had happened that he was shooting blanks, he was unable at first to wrap his mind around what he&#39;d done before he thought, &quot;Holy, shit. I just humped my bedding like a dog would,&quot; and still panting, missing that it wasn&#39;t his paws that had finished transforming, Jeff leaned down and sniffed at the area a moment before he burrowed under the bedding and squirmed about.<br />
<br />
Unaware that the way he was now behaving was like a dog who was nesting, he stared out at the laundry after he&#39;d gotten comfortable. Letting his mind wander, he decided that on the plus side he at least still had a way to deal with his hard-ons whenever he was turned on and needed to address it. Thinking over his situation, he saw it as a downside, as he didn&#39;t know how much he&#39;d change, nor how fast or slow, but was certain the end result would be him, down on all fours, his humanity stripped away until he was reduced to the mindset of a canine. Trying not to dwell on it, Jeff thought, &quot;I have to find a copy of the Chronivac and do something about my transformation before it goes too far,&quot; but found himself facing a dead-end, as he didn&#39;t know how he was to do that.</p>
