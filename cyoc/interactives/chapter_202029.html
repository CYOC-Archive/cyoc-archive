<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leilani eagerly volunteered herself, however she was stop short when she heard the voice of their supervising teacher Gabriel say &quot;Now, Now. I hear that Alyssa has brought in something interesting and large. Now normally this wouldn&#39;t be much of an issue however Alyssa forgot to inform me about this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You girls know I have been lax and given you, your space to grow and learn in the Gardening club, however bringing something of this size within school grounds without consulting your supervising teacher is problematic.&quot; &quot;Alyssa as the club president it&#39;s your duty to keep me inform of everything going on in the Gardening club and to write and submit reports to me relating to your club activities, you have failed to do either in this case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a teacher of this school and the only one that seems to have any like for Gardening, I would have expected that you girls would at least keep me in the loop and remember I was the only teacher who helped and was willing to supervise this club.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alyssa looked down in a bit of shame as in her excitement she had forgotten to inform Gabriel about her large &quot;gift&quot; to the club. The girls knew their supervising teacher was a good guy, but the fact that none of the female teacher&#39;s would supervise the club was very saddening when they first tried to form it. Because of this Gabriel helped them but kept a distance since as a male teacher in charge of a small all female club, he could get into trouble very easily. The girls knew he wasn&#39;t like that but for everyone&#39;s sake he stayed away letting them do what they wanted for the most part in return he relied on Alyssa to submit reports to him, so he could do his job as supervisor.<br />
<br />
With Alyssa breaching this trust and not informing him it was no wonder why he came by to see what everyone was gossiping about outside their green house. <br />
<br />
Alyssa began to apologize. &quot;Teach, I&#39;m so sorry I was just so excited to show my clubmates the Alarune flower I got to help us understand plants better, so we can become better gardeners.&quot; This was only partly true, the other truth was as she said earlier was to help attract more people to their club.<br />
<br />
Gabriel pondered their words when Leilani pleaded &quot;Please Teach let us keep it, it&#39;s very important for our club and futures.&quot; <br />
<br />
With a sigh Gabriel said &quot;Fine, but Alyssa I expect you to file a lot of paper work as well, as tell me what is it in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh&quot; all for girls said. &quot;Wait you don&#39;t know what this is?&quot; asked Zinnia. <br />
<br />
The scrunched up face of Gabriel as he tired to figure out what kind of exotic flower Alyssa brought in could be, told the girls everything they needed to know.<br />
<br />
Gabriel then said &quot;Alyssa if this is some flower from the Amazons (Amazon rainforest) or some other tropical place, you girls best bet it will be very hard to take of. I will most likely need to come by frequently if you plan on taking care of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cass was about to speak and tell Gabriel exactly what it was when her mouth got covered by Zinnia and Leilani who knew full well that if he found out what it was, they wouldn&#39;t be able to keep it.<br />
<br />
Alyssa mind came up with a wonderful idea. Since Gabriel would be coming over more often to check on the flower, it would be hard to keep it a secret so then what better way to get him to see their point of view and convince him to allow them to keep the flower then to have him be the one to use it first.<br />
<br />
Alyssa putting on her most convincing and commanding voice she could muster said &quot;Hey teach let me show you what kind of flower it&#39;s.&quot; <br />
<br />
Leilani looked at Alyssa horrified, but saw Alyssa gave her a thumbs up behind Gabriel&#39;s back. Leilani could only hope Alyssa was going to do right by their club.<br />
<br />
Alyssa and Gabriel approached the flower. Alyssa then began to make up a lie that the flower was from India and that in the region it was from people would crawl in to gather the nectar. Gabriel seemed to be buying it, so Alyssa continued by suggesting he goes in to collect the nectar. At that Gabriel seemed a bit unsure but, Zinnia gave her encouragement, hoping she understood Alyssa&#39;s goal correctly. Leilani on the other hand look disappointed that she wouldn&#39;t use the Alarune flower first. Cass stopped struggling and just stood were she was with her arms crossed, looking upset.<br />
<br />
The four girls then saw Gabriel take off his top, the girls closed their eyes but peeked a little only to realize he had an undershirt on, that had sweat stains under the arm pits. The girls realized this was how Gabriel&#39;s top shirt didn&#39;t get dirty during class despite how hot it can be in the class room at times. They then saw him pry open the leaves around the nectar core as Alyssa instructed him. Gabriel then went into the flower and the leaves closed behind him.<br />
<br />
Gabriel held his breath as he submerged into the nectar. He felt his clothes begin to dissolve in the nectar and he began to panic, he opened his mouth in shock and a large amount of nectar entered. As the nectar entered his mouth he felt a deep sense of calm and a large taste of sweetness over take him. He began to breath normally and realized he didn&#39;t need to hold his breath. Gabriel sank deeper into the nectar. By the time he reached the bottom his clothes were gone. <br />
<br />
Gabriel then felt his frame begin to change becoming curvier and curvier, his skin became nice and smooth. His skin turn green, his male genitalia disappeared being replace with female ones, he knew he was becoming a she. She accepted this, her body felt better then it has ever. Her skin began to absorb the nectar core faster and faster. Her flat chest changed as large perky tear drop breasts popped out filled with the nectar that changed him to her. Her hips swelled becoming child bearing, her ass swelled as well. Soon all her maleness was gone, her body was incredibly female, no one would ever think she was once a man.<br />
<br />
Her thighs thicken and her cunt plumbed up, she felt as petals began to grow around her new virgin pussy and under her breast, acting as bras and panties. She then felt her lower half begin to connect to the flower and the difference between her and it disappeared. Now the flower and her body were one and the same she was an Alarune now. Her hair changed color becoming a orange, her petals changed to be the same. She then blossomed out. She came out up till the top of her hip keeping her fresh pussy hidden. <br />
<br />
The four girls saw, were once the male teacher Gabriel went in out came a MILFY Alarune, her wide childbearing hips just barely poking out, her large teardrop E-cup breasts being held up by orange petals that came from under them, leaking out the nectar that changed her. The newly born Alarune said in a husky womanly voice, as she moved one hand down her toned middle bringing their attention to her curvy lower half then her other hand moving to caress her breast bringing their attention back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm this feels so gooooood. No wonder you girls wanted to hid this from me, but I guess now I can watch over you girls better.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed that was my idea teach.&quot; Alyssa replied as she began feeling hot and bothered. She couldn&#39;t tell if that was because of the pheromones coming from Gabriel or if she genuinely fond Gabriel&#39;s new form hot and sexy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what should we do now?&quot; asked Cass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well how about taking care of me since I am a plant now&quot; said Gabriel. She then said in a sultry tone &quot;You can help by taking the pressure off my breasts, they are very full with nectar.&quot;</p>
