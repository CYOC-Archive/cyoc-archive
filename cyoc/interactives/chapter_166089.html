<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All six men now dogs bounded over to their food bowls. The kitchen was a cacophony of slurping and grunting as the dogs chowed down. They retained their personalities, but there was also enough of the Labrador instincts riding with them that the men could take a backseat and let the dog drive if they chose to. Judging by the tails wagging erratically in the air, most were content to sit back and let the dog enjoy a meal.<br />
<br />
Max was enjoying a particularly scrumptious mouthful of rice and veggies when he felt a snout under his tail and a dexterous tongue on his balls. He swallowed and turned to see the smaller of the two yellow labs, Luke, tail wagging in the air as he snuffled and licked at Max’s backside. He murred a bit as his pointed tip extended from his sheath.<br />
<br />
“Woof pup, not that I’m complainin’, but you oughta finish supper before you go fer dessert” <br />
<br />
Luke gave a chuckle, “I know Papa, but I went for some water and you smelled so good as I was walking by I couldn’t pass you up” and he gave Max another lick.<br />
<br />
“You best be plannin’ to finish what yer startin’ there pup” Max half moaned, half growled.<br />
<br />
The yellow lab winked, “You know I am” and trotted over to his bowl to finish his dinner.<br />
<br />
“Woof” Max agreed.<br />
--<br />
Adam and Alex were the first to finish their dinners.<br />
<br />
“We should go play outside while it’s still light out!” Adam declared.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, good idea!” Alex replied. They both bolted for the doggy door leading to the half-acre of lawn behind the cabin that abutted up against the thick coniferous forest.<br />
<br />
“I’m coming too!” Brian exclaimed, having inhaled the last of his dinner. Brad stopped off to lap up a good amount of water before heading for the doggy door as well.<br />
<br />
Max sauntered by Luke, “Meet us outside when yer finished pup?” Luke merely looked up and nodded, eager to finish his meal so he could join in the revelry.<br />
<br />
Max pushed through the flap on the door and stepped onto the back porch of his cabin. It seemed that Alex and Adam had fully given in to their canine instincts. Adam was play bowed in front of Alex, both forelegs on the ground in front of him, haunches in the air. Alex held steady, anticipating Adam’s next move. Both dogs panted in their excitement. Suddenly, Alex turned and bolted in the opposite direction, Adam following close on his heels. Off to the side, Max heard Brad and Brian’s conversation.<br />
<br />
“Okay, deal. Whoever sucks himself off first is alpha for the night.” Brad said. Both men sat with hind legs spread, plump fuzzy and furry balls on display. Max was tempted to walk over and give both a good whiff, but decided he didn’t want either pup to have an unfair advantage.<br />
<br />
“Hope you’re ready to be my bitch handsome” Brian said, licking Brad’s muzzle. “Because I’m looking forward to burying my bone in you all night” Brad groaned at the pun. Both men had started to slide out of their sheaths.<br />
<br />
“But hey, what about Luke?” Brad asked.<br />
<br />
“We’ll share him like we always do” Brian responded.<br />
<br />
Max chuckled at that. He had been listening to the conversation between the two handsome labs and didn’t register the flapping of the dog door. He did however register the extra weight on his back and the forepaws wrapped around his waist.<br />
<br />
“Hey Papa. I came to finish what I started” Luke said mischievously, inching forward on his hind paws.<br />
<br />
“That so pup?” Max said with a chuckle. He couldn’t see Luke’s fully erect doghood from this angle, but he certainly felt the tip of it poking around his tailhole.<br />
<br />
“Yes sir” Luke said, thrusting a bit with his hips and entering Max. Max let out a low murr. “I even licked myself real good to make sure I was nice and lubed for you” He was walking himself forward sliding inch after inch into Max. He stopped fully hilted inside, but not yet knotting the chocolate lab beneath him. He held like that, forepaws wrapped around the barrel chest of the brown furred lab, snout snuffling around in the fur on the back of Max’s neck.<br />
<br />
Luke gyrated into Max as Max pushed back into the yellow lab on his back. “Woooooooof Luke. Fer a guy that’s usually on tha bottom end of things, you sure know how use yer bone to make an old dog feel good”. He heard two groans and turned to glance at Brian and Brad. Not out of earshot, both dogs apparently didn’t appreciate the pun. Both dogs also had their full length in their muzzles, knots exposed.<br />
<br />
“Uhhhn... ohh,. Oh God Papa” Luke moaned as Max squeezed and milked him. “Oh Max, your hole is magic. I don’t think I’ll last much longer” Luke panted, thrusting into Max. “You wanna have my puppies Papa?”<br />
<br />
“Woof! You betcha Luke!” Max exclaimed “Do it. Knot me!”<br />
<br />
“Yes sir” Luke said. He withdrew a bit. Max steadied himself, planting his front paws, relaxing his hole, and bracing for the tennis ball sized piece of flesh that was about to be shoved inside of him. Luke thrust forward just as Max pushed back, Luke’s knot met little resistance and, with a pop, he was tied to Max.<br />
<br />
“Ohhhhhhh Gods...” both man groaned.<br />
<br />
“Uhmmmph, Uhnn, awooooo!” they heard slurping and a muffled howl, they turned to see the black lab pulling off his cock just in time to shoot his last bit of jizz on his muzzle. “Haha!” Brian exclaimed. “I win!”<br />
<br />
“Ugggggh.” Brad groaned. “Fine” he said, leaning over to lick the muzzle of his boyfriend. “But finish me off as a consolation?”<br />
<br />
“Is that how you ask your alpha?” Brian quizzed.<br />
<br />
Brad rolled his eyes and huffed. “Sir, will you please suck the cum out of me?”<br />
<br />
Brian laughed. “Better. Now on your back, bitch. You’re going to have a front and center view of my fuzzy nuts while I’m giving my doting bitch pleasure”. Brad sighed, but lowered himself to laying down before rolling onto his back, his bright red erection swaying back and forth. True to his word, Brian straddled his hind legs over his boyfriend as he took the dripping cock in his muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Uhhn, Oh Max, I’m not gonna last.” Luke moaned. With his knot fully in Max, his thrusts had changed from slow and passionate to short rapid fire strokes. His yellow furred balls nestled against Max’s plump brown ones. <br />
<br />
“Ohhh do it pup. Fill me up” Max panted, eyes closed, enjoying the feeling of Luke’s weight on his back and Luke’s cock rubbing his prostate.<br />
<br />
“Uh... ohh... uhn.... errr... Oh god. Oh, yeesss. Oh. Oh. Oh. I’m. Oh. I’m gonna.... fuck! AWOOOOOOOOO!!” Luke let loose a howl of pure joy as his seed flooded into his mentor/lover.<br />
<br />
“Ohhh good boy Luke. Good boy. Don’t you even worry about sliding off ah me till that knot goes down. I can support ya. You just stay right there” Max cooed.<br />
<br />
“Yes sir” Luke sighed. Max craned his neck and muzzle back, meeting Lukes for sloppy dog kisses.<br />
<br />
“And when you finally slip outta me, you best be ready coz I’m gonna return the favor and fill that pretty yellow butt up with mah puppy juice.” Max said. Luke closed his eyes sighed in content, wrapping his forelegs around the big brown dog and cuddling up to him.<br />
<br />
“Oh Brian, I mean sir, yes! Yes, oh god sir! I’m close! Oh God sir, I’m gonna... I’m gonna.... awoooooooooo!” Brian drank down the spunk that shot out of his boyfriend, not missing a drop. Brad’s forelegs curled in on themselves, completely submissive to Brian, panting in the afterglow.<br />
<br />
“You’ve got tasty spunk bitch, whether it’s as a man or as a dog” Brian complemented his beta.<br />
<br />
“All of that bitch and beta stuff is giving me an idea” Max whispered to Luke, careful to make sure Brad and Brian didn’t overhear.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?” Luke asked, shifting his weight but still tied to Max.<br />
<br />
“Watch this” Max whispered, concentrating on Brad.<br />
<br />
“Ohhhhh, oh God what’s happening...” Brad moaned, his eyes shooting open.<br />
<br />
“What?” Brian asked, still standing above him.<br />
<br />
“Ohhhh my.. my whole crotch, it’s... it’s tingling!” Brad cried, craning his neck back to brace himself against the sensations. Brian glanced down at his boyfriend’s furry balls and sheath. Brian saw Brad’s canine cock start to reveal itself again, only this time it was because his sheath was shrinking. <br />
<br />
“Dude, your sheath is gone” Brian said. <br />
<br />
“Uhnnnn....” Brad moaned. The sensations he was feeling were definitely new. He had been a dog plenty of times, but this was a first. First his testicles shrank back into his body, quickly followed by his penis as it withdrew inside him. He rolled and moaned as his testicles sucked up inside of his body, vaginal lips opened right under his tailhole, and his penis finished shrinking into a clitoris. Brad rolled off his back and sprung to all fours, mouth open in astonishment as he looked down between his front legs to see nothing hanging between his hind legs. He turned his attention back to Max and Luke just as Luke dismounted Max. “Max! What the hell! I’m a girl!” Brad yelled.<br />
<br />
“Calm down son, you’re a bitch now” Max smirked. <br />
<br />
“I don’t want to be a bitch! I want my cock and my balls and my sheath back!” Brad whined.<br />
<br />
“Oh quit yer belly achin’. Yer still gonna get to do all the doggy things the rest of us are doin’ and you’ll have your cock n’ balls back when yer standin’ on two legs” Max replied.<br />
<br />
“Uh, not all of them. How am I supposed to fuck you guys with this thing?” Brad retorted.<br />
<br />
“Look son, don’t knock that thing til ya try it. Vaginal orgasms are somethin’ else!”  Max said.<br />
<br />
“Whoa whoa whoa” Brian interrupted. “Who exactly is supposed to give him these orgasms? I know he&#39;s still my handsome boyfriend on the inside, buuuut... ”<br />
<br />
“That’s the second surprise” Max said with a smirk. Brian and Brad both tilted their heads in confusion. It took a moment, but Brian caught a whiff of something very enticing. Brad’s eyes opened wide in shock due to the new sensation coming from deep inside his body.<br />
Brian’s cock slipped free from his sheath, “Dude. You smell amazing” And he stuck his snout up under Brad’s tail.<br />
<br />
“You didn’t...” Brad trailed off. <br />
<br />
“Sure did pup” Max said, inhaling deeply. The scent coming from Brad was getting stronger and drifting further. Max and Luke were both getting aroused because of it. “Yer in heat! Don’t worry though, yer sterile, so ya won’t be carryin’ any of our puppies. Made that mistake with a boyfriend of mine a few years back. Figured I would surprise him with somethin’ kinky, so I put on a German Shephard bitch and set a spell to activate and turn him into my Shephard stud when he walked in the door. I waited on the bed while he dropped to all fours and mah heat overtook him. He mounted me good, too. I remember how horny being in heat made me, probably what yer feelin’ right about now Brad. Like an emptiness deep inside. Anyway, we fucked all night long. I don&#39;t think his cock ever left mah cunt, just stayed hard all night while he filled me. When mornin’ came his spell wore off and he was back on two legs. I tried changin’ myself back but I couldn’t. I had been so eager to surprise him I’d forgot to make myself sterile. Well, I was on four paws for damn neart 5 months! Just about two and a half months ta birth his puppies, then another eight weeks so they was weened and could go to their forever homes.”<br />
By this point Brad’s heat had drifted out to the lawn, and Adam and Alex had both stopped wrestling as the aroma hit their noses. “I have to say Brad” Max said. “You smell delicious”<br />
<br />
“He’s right babe” Brian said. Brad had him completely erect. Brian licked his boyfriend&#39;s new vaginal lips.<br />
“Ohhhhhh God Brian, I’ve never been this horny. I’ve never felt like I needed you in me like this. I’m still pretty miffed about this Papa, and I had wanted to get some laps in on four legs around the cabin and do some sniffing in the woods; but all I can think about is getting fucked. You promise the orgasms are as good as you say they are Papa?” Brad asked.<br />
<br />
“Trust me son, they are” Max replied. <br />
<br />
Adam and Alex had joined the group on the porch, enticed by the smell coming from Brad’s vagina.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” Alex exclaimed. “Brad’s a bitch!” <br />
<br />
Adam laughed. “What’s it like being a lady, dude?”<br />
<br />
“Considering how horny I am, and the things I’m imagining you all doing to me, I doubt I classify as a ‘lady’” Brad laughed. “Let’s go upstairs so you homos can make a woman out of me”. And with that, Brad headed for the doggy door, Brian following close behind.  Adam and Alex shrugged at each other and followed suit. Luke turned to join them when Max stopped him.<br />
<br />
“Just because there’s a new bitch on the block, don’t think I won’t be stuffin’ this cock up under yer tail boy” Max said with a gleam in his eye.<br />
<br />
Luke turned and walked back to Max, giving him a lick on the snout, “I’m counting on it Papa.”<br />
--<br />
8:30AM. Five of the six men had hands and feet instead of paws. Brad had been so excited to get his cock and balls back that as soon as Brian was standing again he bent him over and fucked him. Adam and Alex were in the kitchen prepping breakfast for everyone, and Luke and Max were out on the patio. Once Luke was standing, he and Max headed out to the yard. Luke tossed a Frisbee, and Max was more than happy to let the lab take control and take off in a mad dash to catch it. They carried on like this until it looked like Max was tiring, when they retired to the porch. Luke sat on the step and the big brown dog laid his head on Luke’s lap. Luke stroked the dogs neck and back, occasionally rubbing his belly, and scritching behind his ears. It was as Luke stroked the dog that fur receded into skin, paws grew out to hands and feet, joints reversed, and Luke was left running his fingers through the chest hair of his 6’3 naked mentor and lover.<br />
<br />
Luke bent down to kiss Max on the forehead, “Hey Papa.”</p>
