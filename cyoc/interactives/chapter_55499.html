<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"The curse isn't real dumb-ass," Jen said with as much malice as she could. "You 
call here again and I'll get you for harassment." She tried to slam the phone down but 
she found to her horror that she couldn't pull it away from her ear. <I>"What's going 
on?"</I> she thought. <I>"There's no way the curse is real. But then why can't I put 
the phone down?"</I></p>
<p>"I bet you're probably wondering why you can't slam the phone down like I'm sure 
you want to," Kyle said with a little laugh. "The answer is simple. The curse is real and 
once asked you can't stop listening. I could keep you here all day and you wouldn't be 
able to move. Of course the same goes for me so I won't prolong this. Since you didn't 
answer within a minute you get both. Now you humiliated me by pantsing me last 
week so now you and your friends are going to be humiliated. I know pantsing you 
won't be humiliating for you. Well it wouldn't be humiliating for you as you are now but 
I can fix that."</p>
<p><I>"Oh my God!"</I> Jen thought with horror. <I>"He's going to make me into an 
ugly girl who only wears pants so he can pants me."</I> Taking a shaky breath she 
said, "I'm sorry Kyle. I didn't mean to humiliate you."</p>
<p>"It's too late to apologize," Kyle said and Jen could hear the sneer in his voice. "I 
know that you meant to humiliate me. Now for your transform as soon as I'm done 
talking you will transform into a four year old girl. You will still have all of your 
memories and you'll still be able to speak as clearly as you do now. You'll still be in the 
same grade and go to the same school and no one will think that it's strange. Also you 
will have to wear diapers since you can't control your bladder or bowels and you can't 
change yourself. You'll only be able to wear dresses which just scream little girl. While 
you can still eat regular food although in smaller portions your body will crave to be 
breast fed at least once a day and that will occur at lunch time where everyone can 
see you. You'll have to ask a girl to breast feed you and the girl you ask will 
automatically start producing breast milk for you. Finally nothing can change you for 
the rest of your immortal life. That's right you will always be like that never dying. Your 
body will become whole after being damaged no matter what happens." Kyle laughed 
like he just pulled off the best joke ever.</p>
<p>Jen was horrified at what Kyle had her transforming into. She was proud of her 
body and to be four again would be humiliating enough but he had to add wearing a 
diaper and not being able to change herself when she used it and having to breast 
feed everyday in the lunch room. She had to get Kyle back for this so she asked, 
"Transform or dare?"</p>
<p>"Oh you forgot that you get both for not answering within a minute," Kyle said then 
laughed. "You don't have the power yet and I'm going to make sure that you don't turn 
it on me. For your dare you will ask the question to that security guard who ran me off 
last night. You will make sure that he gets both by any means necessary. You will 
dare him to pass it on to one of your friends who also pantsed me and they will pass 
it on to another until all that pantsed me are transformed. Each of your friends who 
pantsed me will receive the same transformation I just gave you. The security guard 
will have a slightly different transform. It will be the same as what I gave you with the 
addition that he's your sister and is in the same grade as you and of course goes to 
the same school. Well that's it. I'll see you at school." With that Kyle laughed and hung 
up the phone.</p>
<p>Jen's hand shook as she finally put down the phone. She looked at her body and 
thought, <I>"It's starting. I don't want to be a little girl though. My body is shrinking. No 
scratch that I'm getting younger."</I> She cupped her breasts as they started to shrink 
and eventually disappear. Her butt flattened like her chest had and her hips narrowed. 
Her waist filled out eliminating the curves she was so proud of. Her fingernails 
shortened until they were as long as a boy's fingernails. Her skirt had fallen off already 
and her bra was hanging off one shoulder. Her bra didn't hang there for long as it 
shrank and turned into a pink top. Her skirt lifted up off the floor and joined itself to the 
top her bra had become taking on the same pink color. She was now wearing a dress 
with nothing on underneath but that was remedied as a diaper just appeared on her. 
Her one sock shrank to fit her foot and leg and another one appeared on her other 
foot. Pink shoes that lit up when she walked appeared on her feet. <I>"This can't be 
happening,"</I> she thought. <I>"I have to be dreaming. That's it I'm dreaming and I'll 
wake up from this nightmare anytime now. Until I wake up though I might as well go 
along with it. So which security guard was working last night?"</I></p></p>
