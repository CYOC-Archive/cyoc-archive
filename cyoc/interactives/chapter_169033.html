<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr Jenkins started to panic as he braced himself for his imminent change. He had hoped in the heat of the moment that turning into a cow might mislead whoever was hunting for him. Besides, there was already one cow in the building, so it would be impossible to tell who was who. <br />
<br />
Having seen the timetable, he knew that a truck full of dairy cows was being shipped out within the next hour. If he could slip on board then he at least had a fighting chance of reverting back after a week. It was risky, but now he had committed.<br />
<br />
Jenkins settled onto his hands and knees, hoping that this would make the process faster and more comfortable. It turned out that he was half right. The changes seemed to be encouraged by the doctor’s posture and mental chanting for it to hurry up. However, the pain of the process was just as bad as it had been when Mr Carter had injected him. He reflected on the farm manager’s demise, knowing that he would soon share the same fate.<br />
<br />
Like Carter, Jenkins felt his body bulking up as his belly and rear-end steadily expanded. Other changes included the growth of a ropey tail and the development of split keratin hooves in place of his hands and feet.<br />
<br />
However, the doctor knew that things needed to speed up. He shut his eyes and mentally told himself “I want to be a cow. I want to be a cow” over and over. He felt utterly humiliated saying these words, but he was thankful when he sensed the process accelerating.<br />
<br />
A minute later Jenkins was now mostly bovine. Most of his body below the head had grown to fit his final form. His large body was supported by four sturdy legs, while his neck had lengthened in readiness for the changes to reach his head. He had also been covered in a tough hide covered with a familiar black and white splotchy pattern.<br />
<br />
Now Jenkins knew that the final, and most degrading changes, were just around the corner. Jenkins now altered his chant, knowing the Zoo’s security personnel were not far away. “I’m a horny female cow in heat. I want to be fucked by a big strong bull.” Again, Jenkins felt ashamed to repeat such a debauched chant. But he kept going: it was working. <br />
<br />
As hoped, the changes started to alter the doctor’s gender whilst simultaneously affecting his face. He felt four pink nubs push out from his lower abdomen, whilst his old human nipples vanished from sight. Jenkins looked beneath himself as he continued to chant. He was strangely pleased to see the growth of four large teats, all of which quickly started to fill with milk. <br />
<br />
The process seemed to be four or five times faster than it had been for Mr Carter. Before long Jenkins was left with a milk-filled udder swaying heavily beneath him; just like Carter’s.<br />
<br />
But Jenkins was given no reprieve as the changes quickly concentrated on his genitals. As expected, his balls emptied themselves of human semen in a pleasureless watery discharge. Then his manhood withdrew between his legs and towards the base of his tail.<br />
<br />
Once in position, Jenkins’ ball sack reformed into the soft sensitive flesh of a cow’s vaginal mound. The sensitive pink skin puffed out before a slit formed down the middle; forming a distinctive slit between a pair of tight pussy lips. Following this, Jenkins felt his cock withdraw as a new channel tunnelled inside him. Soon he had a brand new bovine clitoris and birth canal, leaving him with a fully-functional cow cunt.<br />
<br />
With that, the last of the changes finished off. Jenkins tested his new voice with a quiet moo, which he deemed to be indistinguishable from a real cow’s. And after a few more tweaks here and there the changes finally finished. Jenkins was now a common dairy cow.<br />
<br />
Jenkins stood still to recover his thoughts, still panting from the ordeal of his transformation. He took a few tentative paces as he tried to get used to his new body. It soon became clear that his enormous udder was going to cause him the most problems. Whenever he took a step the sagging fleshy sack swung beneath him, usually catching one of his hind legs as the milk uncomfortably sloshed around inside.     <br />
<br />
The other thing Jenkins was anticipating was the intense bovine heat that would surely strike him. He knew he had to resist being mated for a week, after which he would turn back. He couldn’t sense anything yet, although he knew that it would only be a matter of time. He noted that with Carter’s change the heat seemed to take hold immediately, although Jenkins suspected that the presence of the bull had something to do with it.<br />
<br />
As if to highlight his point, a loud bellow suddenly echoed around the barn. Jenkins suspected that Carter would soon be receiving his third load of bull semen. <br />
<br />
This thought made Jenkins pause. He shook his head as he decided that it was best not to think about bulls. He had to keep his composure.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Jenkins was suitably distracted when the barn door suddenly burst open. Soon, armed security forces were pouring into the building. <br />
<br />
Jenkins smiled to himself, Phase 1 was complete. Now it was time to think about Phase 2: sneaking onto that truck.</p>
