<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the group disbursed following Kat&#39;s swallowing of Liv, Sean took Mitch&#39;s hand and took him off to the side. <br />
<br />
&#39;You seem like the odd one out. Kyra came here to chase her lifelong crush, Liv came here fleeing some sort of personal trauma (if Kat&#39;s words are to be believed). You don&#39;t seem to fit, why are you risking everything to help us break a federal quarantine and spread a mystery gender bending plague?&#39;<br />
<br />
Mitch was squirming in discomfort. He tried looking away, realized how obvious this made it, and forced himself to look at Sean. His eyes wandered down her naked form before he caught himself. Blushing in embarrassment he forced himself to look into Sean&#39;s amethyst eyes.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ok, let&#39;s get this out of the way. Yes, I&#39;m naked. No I don&#39;t mind you looking. I don&#39;t mind if you want to do more than look, I&#39;m a nymphomaniac and an unrepentant slut. Before we fuck and you turn into my new sister, I want to understand why you&#39;re doing this.&#39;<br />
<br />
As she was talking, Sean lead Mitch into one of the unoccupied bedrooms and sat down on the mattress. <br />
<br />
Sean&#39;s forwardness broke the ice. <br />
<br />
&#39;Does it really matter? From what Erin said, you went from being a shy, kinda timid guy into this fearless amazon girl. I&#39;m this short girly guy on the outside and a mess on the inside from a lifetime of awkwardness and bullying. I&#39;ve felt stuck between genders when I just want to be a normal guy. I get mistaken for a girl or trans all the time.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sean took this all in, and thought of how the steroids had altered Erin and Anna&#39;s transformations.<br />
<br />
&#39;Is it a hormone imbalance? I know this might be uncomfortable to discuss, especially with a naked girl who wants to fuck you, but this might matter.&#39; <br />
<br />
Mitch seemed worried at this last part. &#39;Kinda, my hormones are normal but my body doesn&#39;t respond normally to testosterone, it&#39;s called androgen insensitivity. If I had a more severe case, I&#39;d have developed fully as a girl. I wonder if that would have been easier for me. Why?&#39;<br />
<br />
Sean explained Erin and Anna&#39;s changes.<br />
<br />
&#39;So there is no way of being sure how this will affect you.&#39;<br />
<br />
Mitch thought about it. &#39;Lets do this. You are creating a new world without fixed definitions of normal. And you all seem happy with your changes. I think whatever this does, I&#39;m going to be made to like it. I don&#39;t think whatever drives this infection would let me regret it.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sean leaned in and started taking off Mitch&#39;s shirt. He seemed flustered, unsure of what to do. As Sean tugged off the boy&#39;s pants, she asked. &#39;Are you a virgin? It&#39;s ok if you are. Makes this extra special, I get to make a man of you before I make a woman out of you.&#39; she joked.<br />
<br />
Mitch blushed as his underwear came off too. His erection was as petite as the rest of him, not quite four inches.<br />
<br />
&#39;um, yeah. I know I&#39;m really small down there too. I&#39;ve always been too embarrassed to follow through on the rare occasion I had a chance with a girl.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sean laid down on the bed, legs wide. She reached down and playfully spread her labia with two fingers.<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s ok cutie, all us muscle girls have nice tight pussies. There&#39;s no such thing as too small for me.&#39;<br />
<br />
Mitch crawled forward, and Sean&#39;s helping hand guided his cock home. A slight sigh escaped from Mitch&#39;s lips.<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t worry about technique hun, just go wild. I always seem to cum when they do anyway. Stop thinking and fuck me hard.&#39;<br />
<br />
This was the encouragement Mitch needed, and he ramped up into fast jackhammer thrusts. His small endowment meant shorter strokes, and the base of his cock rapidly hitting home on Sean&#39;s pleasure button as he hilted himself inside her. Sean moaned as this was turning out to be much better for her than expected.<br />
<br />
The first hint that Mitch&#39;s changes had begun was a tickle of the tips of his hair as it grew out. Opening his eyes, he saw a curtain of royal purple locks handing down his face.<br />
<br />
His body felt softer, a new bounce in his chest and ass with each thrust. He could feel his waist cinching and his hips flaring.<br />
<br />
Sean felt an increasing pressure inside her sex. Mitch&#39;s strokes were going deeper, his girth was opening her further.<br />
<br />
Sean looked up and saw Mitch&#39;s eyes go from icy blue to a light pink. His face was reshaping as well, going from it&#39;s former androgynous beauty to a womanly perfection worthy of a top model.<br />
<br />
Mitch felt his chest pushing further out, becoming a sizable pair of breasts. A heat and wetness spoke of something else happening down below, focused behind his enlarging scrotum.<br />
<br />
Mitch moaned as he climaxed, but the voice was changed as well. This was a woman&#39;s voice, high and pure.<br />
<br />
They sagged together, spent. After a minute or two, Mitch&#39;s fingers wandered down to that warm sensitive spot at the taint. Fingers found a new opening and slid into well lubed wetness. Mitch&#39;s eyes went wide and Sean noticed this last new addition.<br />
<br />
 &#39;Oh wow, we soo need you in the middle of a threesome with Jess and I. How do you feel?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Good. I feel right. Let&#39;s go down and show the others the new me.&#39;<br />
<br />
The sound of the door opening draw everyone&#39;s attention. Erin and Kyra had emerged a few minutes prior, and were seated together in the recliner. Kyra&#39;s soft voluptuous form lounging in her buff lover&#39;s lap.<br />
<br />
Sean walked down the step first, but all eyes were behind her.<br />
<br />
A naked girl with midback length deep purple hair followed her. Pink eyes and a half smile highlighted an elegant gorgeous face. Perfectly symmetrical with not a blemish to be seen, she had a perfectly shaped small nose, large eyes which hinted at mischief. High cheekbones and a slightly v shaped jaw completed the look of classic beauty.<br />
<br />
Her shoulders were narrow and overall she had a very slender build. Perky natural breasts graced her chest, a very full C cup but looked even more impressive given her compact torso. Small maidenly nipples crowned her bust, just a shade darker than her lightly tanned skin.<br />
<br />
Her midriff lacked the hard abs of the muscle girls, but had a hint of definition and firmness. Also lacking was the extra wide hips and big bouncy butt. Her hips had a nice flare to them, and her butt was high, firm, and heart shaped. Her long toned legs were on display as she gracefully descended the steps. She was somewhat tall, having gained six inches in her legs.  Tucked between her thighs was a generously proportioned cock and balls, though smaller than the monsterous endowments the fembois packed.<br />
<br />
&#39;Damn Mitch, you-!&#39; Erin and Kyra exclaimed in unison.<br />
<br />
Mitch cut them off. &#39;I think I&#39;d like to go by Mia now. I didn&#39;t look like much of a Mitch before, and I definitely don&#39;t feel like one now.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sean caught Anna&#39;s eye. &#39;Add androgen insensitivity to the list of things that changes the outcome of the infection.&#39;<br />
<br />
Anna nodded, &#39;Good to now, and now we have a drop dead gorgeous dickgirl in our group.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sean interrupted, &#39;Herm, lucky girl has the best of both worlds.&#39;<br />
<br />
Mia blushed. &#39;I always felt that I was stuck between genders before. Now I truly am, but I am glad for it. I feel right and complete.&#39; She brushed her hair back and looked down her body. &#39;I think I&#39;m now who I was meant to be all along.&#39;</p>
