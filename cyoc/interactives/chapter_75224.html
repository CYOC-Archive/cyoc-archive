<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were content to lay there with her; you didn't really want to think much about this crazy place, nor your <br />
job, let alone the succubus, the imp, the cuco, or any of the other things that might lay around any corner <br />
waiting for you to let your guard down. Right now all you wanted was to snuggle against this beautiful woman <br />
who you'd had incredible sex with the night before. Of course, you knew that there were still things you <br />
needed to know, along with the other things that you WANTED to know..but where could you really begin?<br />
<br />
&quot;So...uhh..this is gonna sound like a weird question, and I totally don't want it to come off half as rude as <br />
it sounds like it could be..&quot; you started, trailing off and getting a bemused look from Jenny. <br />
&quot;But..uhh..what's the proper thing to call you? Like..is 'bitch' an appropriate term?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny smirked at you and laughed softly. &quot;I prefer to be called Jenny. Calling me a bitch isn't the way to get <br />
on my good side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I mean though, right?&quot; You asked, happy that it apparently hadn't been THAT offensive.<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded. &quot;In most situations, 'bitch' could refer to any fertile lycan female, particularly one going <br />
through her heat cycle at the time. However, it's not exactly proper. Within the lycan community itself, <br />
'bitch' refers only to a female who's been turned through a bite.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smirked slightly in response. &quot;So you're not a bitch, then. Please tell me that the proper term for a <br />
lycan girl who was born that way is 'sweetheart', or something like that.&quot; Despite the stress of the day, you <br />
were starting to get into a better mood from being near Jenny, even though you probably wouldn't have <br />
recognized it for what it was at the time.<br />
<br />
Jenny laughed and kissed the tip of your nose, smiling broadly. &quot;No, goofball. The proper name for me would be <br />
a princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
You had to stifle a laugh. &quot;Wow, that's actually rather precious sounding,&quot; you replied, stroking her cheek. <br />
&quot;My little lycan princess; I like the sound of that.&quot; The words fell out of your mouth and hung in the air for <br />
a second before you blushed bright red. &quot;I mean..umm..you know..just..umm..the phrase..not...not that you're <br />
mine..or will be..or..fuck..&quot; You buried your face in the pillow, completely embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you want me to be?&quot; Jenny asked. &quot;I mean..we already established that you and I are into each <br />
other..but..would you want me to be yours, even knowing what you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
You took your head out of the pillow. &quot;Yeah, I want to give it a shot, if things work out that way. I mean..I <br />
know all this is moving fast, and I know that there's probably like rules against it and everything but..&quot;<br />
Jenny shushed you with a quick kiss on the lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You overthink things, Steve. I..want to be yours, and for you to be mine too..but there's things that <br />
complicate matters. Primarily things on my end..like way more than your end, I'd imagine,&quot; she said. &quot;Tell me <br />
how you feel later tonight, and..well, we'll see how things go from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded. You weren't stupid; you knew she was alluding to the wolf side. You felt safe last night, but only <br />
more encounters would really tell the story of how safe you were with her, or how safe you actually felt in <br />
the long term. You decided to drop that specific subject, though you kept her snuggled against you, still <br />
quite infatuated with having her against you even in a non-sexual context.<br />
<br />
&quot;So..you live here full time, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded. &quot;Virtually my whole life. Lycan girls develop quickly; I've been doing solo videos since I was <br />
fifteen, and girl-on-girl videos since I was seventeen.&quot; She could read the shock on your face. &quot;It's not like <br />
that..lycan society says that a girl can start breeding at fourteen. My boobs were already almost as big as <br />
they are now, and..well, growing up in a place like this, I was already aware of what went on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah..still, you probably lost your innocence a little early,&quot; you said, sounding a little regretful. <br />
Truthfully you felt bad for her. Jenny clearly had experienced a bit of a dysfunctional childhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a place like this, innocence is NOT your ally,&quot; she said flatly. &quot;Don't get me wrong; nothing bad <br />
happened. In fact, a lot of people here were very protective of me. I was never touched or raped or anything <br />
like that, and I never was in danger of it. But I was always informed about the different things that went on, <br />
and about who I'd be best keeping a wide distance away from and such.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you've never lived out in the regular world, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her head. &quot;Nope. I've visited a few times, but you have to understand..that's not MY world. I wasn't <br />
raised in it. The way all of you do things at times confuses me. It confuses the animal in me,and sometimes my <br />
instincts say that I should react in ways that aren't acceptable. Thanks to the internet, I can order anything <br />
I want, so I don't have to ever leave here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't that a little lonely though?&quot; You again found yourself feeling a little bad for her. &quot;I mean..there's <br />
this whole world of things to see and experience, and you're just down here, watching it all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her voice softened, and she stared down at the mattress. &quot;When I was younger, I was obsessed with getting out <br />
and going places..but everyone told me how dangerous it was for supernaturals. I just never had anyone who'd <br />
really take me out places and spend the time letting me explore.&quot; She sounded a little sad at this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe sometime you and I could go somewhere up there,&quot; you said offhandedly. Jenny looked up at you with a <br />
beaming smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like that,&quot; she said. &quot;I'd like that a lot.&quot; She nuzzled against your chest, making those happy noises <br />
she'd made a few times before as she wrapped her arms tightly around your shoulders.<br />
<br />
The intercom buzzed again, once more ruining your happiness with its jarring noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny, is Mr. Anderson with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny sighed. &quot;Yes, he's here. You know he's here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Then you can take him to Studio C with you. You're running late for your wardrobe appointment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! Sorry!&quot; Jenny said, looking at the clock in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope that our new photographer won't affect your punctuality regularly, Jenny.&quot; Ms. Adair sounded quietly <br />
furious, her icy demeanor dripping through in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;No ma'am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Wardrobe is expecting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny grabbed your hand and walked you down the maze of corridors until you found one marked &quot;Studio C&quot;.</p>
