<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Javan fell slightly, supporting himself weakly on the side of the wet cell wall. Why was it wet? He thought.<br />
<br />
The heat was getting worst by the second. Initially it was a bit toasty, like he was warming himself by a fire. But now it was red hot, like he was being dangled over the fire. He wiped his face which was now covered in sweat, Javan was surprised by how much sweat he was producing at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;You feel that heat?&quot; the figure said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What....what have you done to me!&quot; Javan cried out weakly. He could feel himself getting weaker, his voice sounded only like a whisper even though he meant to shout.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is starting...&quot; the figure said. Javan could hear his footsteps pace away, getting quieter. The only sound the young adult could hear was the slow ventilation of air from a nearby ventilation duct.<br />
<br />
Javan felt an incredible waft of pain strike him immediately. He fell knees first onto the ground, crying out in agony. It was immediate, like something large had hit him, but the pain didn&#39;t come from anything around him, it was coming from inside his body. Javan could feel his heartbeat in his ears as he pressed his hands onto the wet ground. They were seemingly under alot more pain than the rest of his body, and Javan could see why. The hands were violently shaking, he could see the outlines of his bones extending pressing against his weak skin. He yelped as the middle finger and index finger started to fuse from the base. He was left with four fingers, and a dark pigment starting to form from the palm of his hand, this colour seemed to grow though stretching across his hand. Furthermore the pigment seemed to cause the changes, as his hands underwent a significant burst in growth as it was covered in this darker skin. He could feel his nerve endings going nuts, the pain never numbed it was continuous. <br />
<br />
The pain died away on his hands. He looked at them, outstretched and gasped. Now Javan knew his mythical creatures, so he knew what this was. Whatever nightmare he was being put through, it was going to reach one outcome. He was being transformed into a minotaur.<br />
<br />
As if by instruction his feet cracked, he fell to the ground this time landing on his back. Javan reached to his bare feet with his changed hands. They were undergoing similar changes, his toes fusing together and hardening, he felt the bones dislocate and configure into a more straight appearance, like an extension of his legs. The hardening become unbearable as his toes seemingly disappeared into two hooves. <br />
<br />
The pain again died away again. Javan picked himself up, or at least attempted to. Since he immediately fell back down not being able to make proper contact to the ground with his new hooves. He attempted again and succeeded, using the wall for support. Javan groaned loudly, placing his thick fingers against his skull, the sweat was still there. He looked down at his body and saw his previously pretty meak body was looking better in shape. Not by much but enough to notice. His feet looked unreal to him, they looked identical to how Minotaur&#39;s looked online. <br />
<br />
Before he could ponder his new form any further he felt a pain hit his back. This time he didn&#39;t fall over, he stood there crying out in agony as his back cracked. Unlike his feet or hands though, he felt a new sensation. Energy filled the back of his body like he had never experienced before. The sensation was like a balloon being pumped with air, or an intense pressure pushing against the body. Anyhow Javan groaned as his back stretched, growing in size. Furthermore the energy filled the rest of his chest.<br />
<br />
His meek body started to inflate. His flat lower chest grew out to form a small six pack. His chest pumped outwards to form two small but distinguishable pecs. Javan pushed himself against the wall feeling in awe as his body increased with mass. The pain was still there but it had seemingly been washed away by the surprise he felt. His arms start to inflate, the triceps and biceps becoming more eye-catching. The changes and pain stopped again. Javan let go off the wall, he felt stronger than he did before like a few years back when he did continuous exercise, except this time the adrenaline didn&#39;t stop.<br />
<br />
Javan scoffed as he flexed his arm, the sight was less than he expected of a minotaur. Although he wasn&#39;t sure the transformation was done yet. He prepared himself for the next set of changes, seeing if flexing himself would lessen the pain.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t as a sharp sensation hit his head. Javan cradled it with his two minotaur hands. He could feel the flesh and bones contorting, his face was under a undescriable amount of suffering as it seemed to move around, pushing out like he had never felt before. His features became more defined as his head increased in size. Javan felt his nose flare up, extending himself further from his face. He saw something small fall before his eye. Before he could see what it was, two sharp pains hit his forehead. Javan let go of his face, realising what fell: In his hands was a crumpled mesh of hairs. In fact as the pain became more intense, more of his hair seemingly plucked itself out until he was left stark bald. The pain erupted into two pillars which protruded perpendicular from each other in his head resulting in two well defined horns. Javan felt his mouth erupt in agony as his tooth pushed forward, sharpening with new ones growing behind. He coughed up blood and gagged loudly. His voice was still the same.<br />
<br />
Before he knew it, his face was identical to that of a minotaur. All be it a little less defined. Javan felt his new horns. It was a wierd textile, like sharp rock, but jagged across the surface. This whole ordeal had shown Javan that this whole endeavor to get a job at  this science facility was not worth it. He could feel the monster growing inside of him. He wasn&#39;t sure if he should accept these changes or not yet.<br />
<br />
Soon enough his body erupted in pain again, this time in the worst possible region. He felt a sharp stab to his dick which had been dangling during this entire journey. Javan had hoped it wouldn&#39;t have come to this. Javan fell to the ground unable to handle the pain like last time. He cried out loudly, feeling his groin stretch and elongate. While also violently shaking. It was bigger than he had ever seen one. Stretching out to near 20 inches. He groaned loudly unable to contain the pleasure he felt as his growth continued around the sex organs. He saw white liquid spurt out the top of his digit, and drip down the entire length of it. As this was happening his musculator was becoming even more well defined and larger. His six pack had grown to an eight pack. His chest had exploded outwards, pushing itself out breaking any set limits before. His arms and legs accompanied these changes, filling with more rippling muscles. Javan felt his energy increase, chemicals pumping around his body making him feel amazing.<br />
<br />
He groaned loudly hearing that in this process his voice had gotten much deeper. His skin had also gotten darker having a similar texture to that of his hands. The pigment described before had also made its way across his body setting force changes to come.<br />
<br />
Javan lay there stupefied by his body builder like body. He groaned loudly stroking his now 25 inch cock. Whatever he had said before about not wanting this, he took it all back now. This experience had turned into something he knew he wanted. The energy and muscles that filled his body sent him into an almost frenzy. He threw himself up off the ground and roared at the top of his lungs, his mass rippling as he did this. Javan hadn&#39;t noticed but he almost twice as big as he was before. This added to his beast like feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is incredible&quot; Javan growled loudly. Flexing his well defined bicep. He groaned loudly as the arm stretched out even further than before. He was surprised the changes were not finished. Unlike before the pain didn&#39;t send him into a weeping mess, he could now withstand it and allow it to fuel his demonic desires. It was as if he enjoyed the pain. The changes continued through, his body growing to around 9ft tall.<br />
<br />
As far as he tell the transformation was finished. Javan groaned loudly looking down at his god-like body in awe. It was everything he wanted it to be. However now that he had it, the minotaur knew he couldn&#39;t lose it. When the doctor eventually comes back, Javan would be ready for him. Even if he couldn&#39;t escape....he wouldn&#39;t give up this gift easily.</p>
