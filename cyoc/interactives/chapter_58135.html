<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The place was packed and on the way to the bar, Emily found herself briefly separated from Cara by a line of people cutting across her path.  Her lips instinctively curled into a slight snarl at the inconvenience. By the time she caught up to Cara, her friend already had two shot glasses, one of which she quickly handed to Emily.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready? 1-2-3!&quot; Cara shouted over the noise of people and music and with that both girls quickly downed their drinks.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Emily asked, wincing at the burn, not being able to place the exotic aftertaste in her mouth, yet detecting something somehow familiar to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;No clue.  I asked for tequila, but the bartender said we'd like these better.  She said it would put hair on my chest!&quot;  Cara giggled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice.&quot; was all Emily could come up with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I'm getting another, how about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I think I'll just stick with a beer for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Emily turned back to the bar to order the drinks, Cara took a moment to take in the decor.  This really was an amazing bar.  How was it she had never heard of it before?  Werewolf or not, this was right up her alley.  It even had the pretzels and nuts in dog bowls on the tables and bar she noted with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Cara soon re-materialized from the crush of eager customers at the bar with two of the shots in one hand and a beer bottle for Emily.  Cara quickly downed both shots in succession and immediately pulled Emily by the hand towards the dance floor, blatantly sniffing every person they passed.  Once there, she began dancing wildly, thrashing her hair about to the beat of the music.  Its long length whipping anyone who dared get within range.  Emily joined in, and although she obviously wasn't nearly as buzzed as Cara, she was still having a great time and had never felt so free.  Both girls were smiling and laughing uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
Just then Emily's ears picked up on a random male voice from somewhere in the club drunkenly blurting something that sounded like &quot;Dude, check out those two crazy chicks on the dance floor.  They are smokin'!&quot; and then another saying &quot;I don't know man, I'm not really into hairy chicks.  Did you see the brunette one's legs? Someone needs to buy her a razor!&quot; Another voice she had a harder time making out but she distinctly heard &quot;...the lesbian bar is down the street dude!&quot;<br />
<br />
Morons, Emily thought to herself, for the first time cursing her newly acute hearing.  She then had a moment of clarity and fearfully looked down at the legs of her roommate who was too wrapped up in the music to have heard the same conversation.  Uh, oh.  It seemed her friend's shaving had not held up for long as they were now already covered in dark stubble again. Suddenly Cara raised her arms to begin clapping over her head and Emily noticed that her friend's legs weren't the only place sprouting noticeable hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I'm going to go get another beer, you want anything?&quot;  Emily asked as she nervously gulped down the last of her bottle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, get me two more of those special shots!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, don't go anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily was slightly worried to leave her increasingly drunken and irreverent friend alone, but figured she'd only be a couple minutes.  As she approached the bar, she got the attention of the same female bartender Cara had ordered from and asked for two of the &quot;special&quot; shots and another beer.  The bartender smiled broadly and said &quot;sure thing, pup.&quot;  When the young woman returned with the drinks, that's when Emily picked up on a familiar scent and noticed the flower in the bartender's wild blonde hair.  It was the same type of blossom she bought today and was in her drawer.  The same flower that had done this to her and her roommate.  She had a moment of realization and sniffed the shots.  Just as she thought, there was a faint amount in the shots as well.<br />
<br />
As she turned to look for Cara, a remixed version of &quot;Werewolves of London&quot; began playing.  She had a moment of panic as Cara was not anywhere near where she last saw her.  But that panic was quickly replaced by embarrassment when she saw Cara on the other side of the club, dancing wildly on top of a table much to the displeasure of the people seated there.  By the time Emily made her way through the sea of dancers, Cara was full-on howling along with the chorus.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaa-wooooooooooooo!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaa-woo...&quot;  Cara's second howl was cutoff abruptly by Emily grabbing her by the hairy hand and pulling her down off the table just as two stern looking, no-nonsense bouncers were making their way over.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Geez Cara, you need to cool it a bit.  I don't want us to get kicked out of here!&quot; she scolded in a hushed whisper.  And then humbly to the two bouncers, &quot;Hehe...I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  She's just really wasted.  I mean REALLY.  It won't happen again, promise.&quot;  They gave Cara a glance, but seemed satisfied with Emily's apology and backed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, Em.  I don't know what's come over me!&quot; Cara apologized a bit woozily and was confused a bit by the raspiness of her voice.  She cupped her hands along sides of her head to try to regain her composure and quickly withdrew them after they met the alien feeling of points her ears tapered to.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then both girls were interrupted by a familiar voice from behind them.  &quot;Well I guess they'll just let anyone in here nowadays!&quot;</p>
