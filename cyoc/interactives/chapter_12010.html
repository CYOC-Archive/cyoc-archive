<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben stood in front of his computer holding up his boxers. He looked down at his chest, which a few minutes ago, had been covered in manly brown chest hair, and was now pale and smooth. He could see, and with one hand feel, the beginnings of his developing pec muscles, but there wasn't much there yet. His arms were thin and gangly, even though they were still very short in comparison to his 34 year old arms, and when he lifted them up, his armpits were hairless. Ben's eyes traveled down to his stomach. He didn't even have any hair leading down to his crotch. He knew that he had a trail before he had chest hair, how much of a change could 22 years really be. He was almost positive that he wasn't such a... a... kid at 12. His stomach was flat and taunt around his little belly. If he flexed real hard, he could see the small ab muscles jump. On either side of his abs he could see his pelvic bone sticking out. He must really be thin now. Ben guessed his weight to be around 100 or 110 lbs. He turned around to examine his back. Ben could see almost every rib as he turned around. The nice &quot;v&quot; shape he had earned in the gym, was substituted by an &quot;l&quot;. His shoulders and back had lost most of their muscle and his ass had deflated considerably, his shoulder blades jutted out from his back. His waist did get a little smaller than the rest of him, but not enough to call it a &quot;v&quot;. <br />
He refused to let go of his boxers, instead he lifted them up a little now that they ended at his knees. His thighs were thin and hairless, and very white. He began to study his knees, shins and calves next. His knees looked too big for his body, They were very bony and seemed to stick out, His shins and calves, well, he really couldn't say that he had any calves. If he had been his adult self, he would have thought that he had toothpicks for legs. He finally realized that his legs barely had any hair on them at all as well. His feet looked strange though, and a quick glace at his hands confirmed what he was thinking. He had gone back to the middle of his major growth spurt. He could probably wear size 10 1/2 shoes, even though he was 5'2. He had been really clumsy in Jr. High. He remembered his health teacher saying that before a boy has his growth spurt, his hands and feet grow and the reason why boys seem so clumsy after the growth, is that there minds are trying to get used to their new, longer limbs. Ben chuckled to himself. He was going back wards, he'd be clumsy alright, but it was going to be because he had to get used to his new shorter limbs. <br />
Ben walked over to the mirror, boxers still in hand, and began to examine his face. He could find some peach fuzz on his cheeks, but not much. He had regained a good number of freckles but he didn't have any pimples yet. He smiled inwardly at that, his clear skin, but clear skin could also mean that he hasn't started... he decided not to finish that thought. <br />
His hair had gone back from his dark brown to a very dirty blond. He smiled at his own reflection and saw his prominent front buck teeth. He had the face of some goofy kid. Ben sucked in a deep breath, and decided to face the music. He let go of his silk boxers and they silently glided to the floor. He stood in front of the mirror, eyes shut, not wanting to see the reality of what his new age meant. He slowly opened one eye, then the other, and looked down. His tiny pink little boy dick was resting at two inches soft, above his sack, which didn't seem to be holding his balls yet. He glanced at his cock a second time, something was very different. He had foreskin! He had seen some guys in high school who still had their foreskin and had been insanely jealous of them. The computer must have done this automatically. All of the details of his crotch were very evident because he had grown absolutely no hair . He wasn't a man anymore, he was a boy. <br />
Ben looked back to the computer. What could he do now? He could invite some of his Jr. High buddies over... no, that's something the 12 year old me would have done, he thought to himself. He felt like he had two minds trying to tell him what to do. He knew he was really 34, but he wanted to do things a 12 year old would want. He began to think if he could jack off in this body. He could try and make himself older, but... Naked, skinny, 12 year old Ben sat down at the computer and...</p>
