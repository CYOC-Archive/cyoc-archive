<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He decided to swap his mother and his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
He had a girlfriend named Zoe, a 21 years old girl who had a toned figure and long wavy blonde hair and blue eyes. She had c-cup breasts and very shapely butt and a pair of legs. She and him had known each others since high school days and share the same passion in performing arts. They had been dating for 2 years and were still confused on whether they wanted to get engaged. His mother, Sally, is a 42 years old full-time working woman living her family life by being a lawyer. She was not bad for a woman in early 40&#39;s as she kept her slim figure and a face that belonged to someone in late 20&#39;s. She looked really cute for her age. Though, she had shown a sign of age by having a little bit of fat in some of her body parts. Her hair is still perfect as she owned her tidy brown hair with bangs that was cut professionally. Her clear brown eyes were always too good to look at. She had d-cup breast despite looking a bit saggy. In fact, a lot of his male friends called his mom &quot;hot&quot;. <br />
<br />
Zoe and Calvin were like one of those best couples people would see in movies. They were perfect. They were smart, good-looking, fashionable, and both had good bodies. Even in his high school prom, the pair won &quot;The Best Couple&quot;. They went to cinema and watched movies together. Sometimes, they had a trip to somewhere far from his hometown and had a holiday together. They hugged, kissed and made a love. They were really a happy couple. Everyone was jealous of his relationship. Even in the performing arts class, their chemistry together made their play and acting worked so perfectly and then made their classmates clapping.  So far, he had not really had any hardship with her, but lately he faced a quite confrontation with Zoe due to unwanted occasion between him and one of his female classmate. Few months ago, Zoe was sick and could not attend the preparation for a show in an event at one of the elementary school. The show was called Romeo and Juliet and both were told to not kiss as the show was supposed to be family-friendly. During the third act, Calvin&#39;s female classmate kissed him in front of sitting families who brought their kids. They did not realize the picture was taken and their picture became a headline in his hometown. Obviously, Zoe enraged and interrogated Calvin, but she gave him one more chance. Since that, their relationship had never been the same. <br />
<br />
Calvin&#39;s taste were towards the older woman. He thought they were more mature and knew what they want. They were also easier in terms of making conversation and more appreciative in terms of relationships. He always dreamed about him and his mother having relationship together. He had a little bit of crush towards his mother. He looked at her and couldn&#39;t help but felt for his mother. He still saw a glimpse of sadness in her eyes even though his dad died few years ago. He really cared about mother, but at the same time he wanted to make her happy again. Calvin really loved his mother as not only she was very kind and caring, she was also kind of outgoing. She went out as her way of throwing out her stress. In their spare time, they acted like couples together like shopping, watching a movie, and hanging out in a cafe together. His mother looked so young that oftentimes they were mistaken by people for being a couple even though they were a pair of mother and son. He was a guy who really wanted to make his mother smiling and enjoying life again.<br />
<br />
Calvin had a really considerable time thinking about the swap. He thought about the consequences of his swap and was a little bit skeptical about the remote. Would all people that he, his mother, and girlfriend knew be aware of the swap? Would the remote had that kind of ability? Would he still remember his mother and girlfriend former selves? He took a deep breath and thought a proper time to do the swap. Several minutes later, he knew what he would do. His mother always came home around the dinner time which was around 6 or 7 PM. He decided to invite Zoe to his house and eat together with his mother. <br />
<br />
As Zoe knocked the door, Calvin put his smile welcoming his girl. &quot;Hi, Zoe,&quot; he greeted. &quot;Hi, Calvin. It&#39;s been a while since the last time we had a dinner in your house,&quot; she smiled. &quot;What was going on?&quot; she asked. &quot;Nothing,&quot; he nervously replied. &quot;My little heart inside me suggested a dinner with my mom and my lovely girlfriend,&quot;  he smirked while speaking in rather low voice. Zoe laughed and kissed him on his cheek. As Zoe entered the dinner, Sally approached Zoe. &quot;Hi, Sally,&quot; Zoe said hi to Calvin&#39;s mother. &quot;Hello there, Zoe. You look so beautiful,&quot; she hugged Zoe in the process. &quot;Calvin planned this dinner. It is rare coming from him, but he really meant it,&quot; she continued. Calvin only smiled on the background knowing they were oblivious of his plan. &quot;Are you guys good together?&quot; Sally asked Zoe about their relationship. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Sally. Everything is fine for us both,&quot; she clearly hid something which meant she still had a bit of anger towards Calvin. &quot;He is a very good boy and knowing that he takes care of you makes me even happier that you are together,&quot; she touched Zoe&#39;s left hand and grinned. <br />
<br />
Inside Calvin&#39;s head kept saying, &quot;Do it now!&quot;, &quot;Now or never, Cal!&quot;, &quot;This is your chance or you will regret it!&quot;, etc. He quickly grabbed his remote and chose a button to be pressed. What button would he press?</p>
