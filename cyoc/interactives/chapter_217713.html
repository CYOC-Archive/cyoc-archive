<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I’m back baby! This is going to be a longer story across multiple chapters, but I also have plenty of short chapter ideas that might be great to share, and have written a few already, but what do y’all think? Lemme know! </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yummies is the world’s most powerful confectionary company. Its product range is in the hundreds, and are on shelves across the globe. They’re everywhere. Chances are, if you were to take a trip to space, you’d find an empty Yummies wrapper on the International Space Station. One day, they organised a showcase of their new product to their biggest investors and shareholders. Little did those men know, the product would change the world.<br />
<br />
The investors and shareholders gathered in a dark room. There were twinges of frustration in their murmurs, mostly about the lack of chairs. The walls were black from the darkness. Then, blasting from the speakers in the room’s corners, was an overly friendly, overly enthusiastic voice.<br />
<br />
“Gracious benefactors, welcome to the showcase of our new product here at Yummies. We thank you for your selfless investments and are thrilled to show you what we have spent the last year working on.”<br />
<br />
“There are no chairs. And I can’t see,” one of the men complained. He was a portly man wearing tiny spectacles. <br />
<br />
“We are so sorry about that, but we don’t think you’ll mind after you see this!”<br />
<br />
One of the walls clicked as it slid open, revealing a giant window overlooking a room of bright white walls. In its centre is a pedestal with a small metal box on top. The Yummies company logo is engraved in the ceiling and the words “Product Testing in Progress” hangs on the window. The men in suits clamber to get a good look. The man who complained let out a huff.<br />
<br />
“I still want a chair. Do none of you up there have a brain?” he asked the speakers.<br />
<br />
“We apologise Sir. We will provide you with a chair right after our demonstration. It should only be a few minutes! Send them in!”<br />
<br />
Then, one of the walls in the white room slid open, and two men walked through it. They both wore loose, worn farmer’s overalls. One of them looked middle-age, possibly in his 50s, with thin limbs, small torso, and a bald spot. His face was weathered with creases and wrinkles. The other looked more lean in physique, with smoother skin and cute blonde hair. A step-father and his son. The son looked at the window which, from his perspective, was a giant mirror.<br />
<br />
 The voice spoke to them with the same unwavering tone.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for taking part in our product testing Mr. and Mr. Reily!”<br />
<br />
“It’s Ivan, and my son’s Frank,” said the older farmer, looking around to find the source of the voice, “and it’s no trouble at all. getting paid to eat Yummies? Sounds like a perfect job to me!”<br />
<br />
He and his son laughed, as did the voice. <br />
<br />
“We’re glad to have such fine testers as yourselves. Now, would you please remove the box.”<br />
<br />
Ivan did so, revealing a tin container filled with candies; small soft orbs of swirling purple and orange. The purple was glowing. <br />
<br />
“Wow! How’d you do the glowing thing?”<br />
<br />
“Company secrets I’m afraid!” the voice laughed a laugh exactly the same as the one before, “would you please take a handful. About 6 or 7 should do.”<br />
<br />
Ivan scooped a few into his hand. They were squishy and changed shape when he pressed them in his palm. He hesitated.<br />
<br />
“So, what do we do now?”<br />
<br />
“Would you please eat all of them Ivan. It is also imperative that Frank does not eat one for the time being.”<br />
<br />
Frank disappointingly gave a thumbs up to the ceiling as Ivan opened his mouth and ate the candies. His jaw moved up and down, struggling to bite into them all.<br />
<br />
“They’re a bit chewy,” he said.<br />
<br />
“What flavour would you say they are?” asked the voice.<br />
<br />
“I dunno. Apple, maybe?”<br />
<br />
“Excellent, thank you Ivan.”<br />
<br />
“What do we do now?”<br />
<br />
“Stand by.”<br />
<br />
Ivan finished chewing and swallowed them, a faint purple glow traveled down his neck and to his stomach. The man that complained watched on with the others in the dark room and scoffed.<br />
<br />
“What’s so special about them, huh? They look generic except for the glowing. They won’t sell.”<br />
“Give it a moment Sir!” said the voice excitedly.<br />
<br />
Then, Ivan looked down. He felt a tingly sensation in his stomach, and he placed a hand on it.<br />
<br />
“That’s odd,” he said.<br />
<br />
“What’s up?” asked his son.<br />
<br />
“Weird feeling. Like a vibration…”<br />
<br />
His voice trailed off when he felt the tingling sensation grew stronger as it slowly spread to his entire body. He stretched his arms and legs out and let out a laugh. It was like hundreds of tiny hands were gently rubbing every part of him.<br />
<br />
“Wow, this feels great!”<br />
<br />
“Ivan, please could you describe what you’re feeling?” asked the voice.<br />
<br />
“It’s like a massage. Like my body’s feeling super relaxed right now. Frankie you gotta try one!”<br />
<br />
“It is imperative that Frank does not eat one for the time being,” the voice repeated.<br />
<br />
Ivan let out a soft moan when the tingling sensation reached his face. He buried it into his hands, laughing in disbelief. Frank watched on in amazement; he had never seen his father so happy. He didn’t notice as thick brown hair sprouted on Ivan’s head, covering his bald spot.<br />
<br />
“I’ve never felt anything like this! It feels a bit, well… amazing! My mind feels clear, and I can think so quickly! And my…my…”<br />
<br />
His overalls started to look more filled in.<br />
<br />
“…my hands feel so soft…”<br />
<br />
His voice was changing too. Smoother, and slightly deeper.<br />
<br />
“…oh yeah…I could get used to this.”<br />
<br />
Ivan spoke as if he was getting turned on. Frank started to feel very uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
“Uh, Dad? Are you alright?”<br />
<br />
Ivan removed his face from his hands and looked up at him.<br />
<br />
“I’m doing great.”<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?!” yelled Frank.<br />
<br />
Ivan looked at his son, who had taken a few steps back and had a shocked expression on his face.<br />
<br />
“What? What’s up son?”<br />
<br />
“Your face! Your fucking face!!”<br />
<br />
“What?! What is it?!”<br />
<br />
Frank didn’t answer, instead pointing at the large mirror behind Ivan. He turned to face it, and froze in amazement. Staring back at him with wide blue eyes and an open mouth was the most handsome man he had ever seen. Young, early 20s, with perfectly smooth skin and a sharp jawline. Messy brown hair fell perfectly down his head. His neck was thick with a perfect Adam’s apple protruding from it. His physique looked buff, with strong perfect arms filling out his sleeves. Between his legs was a perfectly sizeable bulge. His perfect ass hugged the overall fabric perfectly. He looked perfect. He looked like a model. No, he looked like the God of models.<br />
<br />
“Is that…” as he spoke, so did the reflection, “…me?”<br />
<br />
His eyes scanned his new body, as did the investors and shareholders on the other side of the mirror. They were loudly exclaiming their disbelief at the transformation that took place before their very eyes. The man who complained scoffed again.<br />
<br />
“This is clearly fake! It’s not possible.”<br />
<br />
“Just wait a few more moments please!” the voice was practically squealing with excitement, “the test is not finished.”<br />
<br />
In the white room, Frank slowly approached Ivan, gazing at the man’s new form in shock. Ivan cupped his new biceps with his hands.<br />
<br />
“Dad?” he asked.<br />
<br />
Ivan looked at his stepson through the mirror. They looked almost exactly the same age. Ivan smiled worriedly at Frank.<br />
<br />
“It’s me. I can’t believe it. I look so…good! Woah..”<br />
<br />
He felt the tingling sensation return, this time to just his hands.<br />
<br />
“It’s back,” he said.<br />
<br />
“What is?” asked Frank.<br />
<br />
“That tingling.”<br />
<br />
“Christ! Dad, what’s gonna happen now!?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know! I—OHHH”<br />
<br />
He suddenly moaned as he felt his hand stretch a few sizes larger, cupping more of his muscles. Frank watched as Ivan’s other hand grew to match.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit they grew! Your hands!”<br />
<br />
“Oh my God…” said Ivan.<br />
<br />
The tingling sensation suddenly traveled to his arms. Before Ivan could say anything he let out a huge moan as they grew, his biceps bulging out of his clothes. They looked massive on him, as if he had been working out his entire life. His arms extended past his waist.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, that was intense! Look at my arms! Ah! Everything’s too tight!”<br />
<br />
With his grown hands and arms, he grabbed the sleeves of his clothes and tore them of with incredible ease. Almost exploding out from them were his giant biceps and triceps, of which he flexed when they burst free.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit! I look…I look…”<br />
<br />
He gave himself a cocky smile in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, I look fucking sexy,” he said as he winked at himself. His bulge moved slightly; his cock was coming to life.<br />
<br />
Frank took a few steps back. His breathing became quick and shallow.<br />
<br />
“Can anyone help?” he called out for the voice, “I think my Dad’s having an allergic reaction!”<br />
“No Frank,” said the voice, “he is experiencing what was planned. Please stand by.”<br />
“Ohhhhh FUCK yeah!”<br />
<br />
Ivan yelled out as the tingling stretched to his torso. His shoulders widened as his pecs piled on more muscle. His tight waist shrunk slightly, and as he breathed in the outline of defined abs pushed through the overalls.<br />
<br />
The sensation moved quickly, covering his legs. He watched them as his thighs flexed and thickened. He grew taller too, reaching around 6ft5, and his feet grew so big they burst through his shoes. His overalls could barely cover him, with tears along all of the seams.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah! Look at me! I am your fucking God!!” Ivan screamed with a mixture of authority and orgasmic pleasure when the sensation travelled to his crotch.<br />
<br />
His cock was at half mast as it ballooned in size, slithering further down his trouser leg. His ass grew, with each cheek getting larger with each of his moans.<br />
<br />
By this time, Frank was pounding at the wall where they had walked into from, calling out for help. He didn’t dare look at his step-dad until he heard one giant, bestial roar.<br />
<br />
“AAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!!!!”<br />
<br />
The sensation had crawled across Ivan’s entire body, and in one giant movement he exploded in size. His overalls were no match, and tore off, revealing his godlike frame that kept growing bigger. 6ft8. 6ft10. 7ft. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. His rock-hard cock getting thicker and longer, surpassing the width of Frank’s arm in no time.<br />
<br />
His voice in in between each moan and grunt grew deeper, and rougher. The hair on his head grew long, and thick stubble had sprouted along his jaw in mere seconds. His body darkened with patches of brown hair, and massive clumps of it had blossomed in his armpits.<br />
<br />
He no longer looked like the God of models. He looked like the God of beasts. <br />
<br />
When the growing eventually stopped, he stood proud at 7ft6. His head hit the ceiling. By his huge, hairy feet were the tattered remains of his clothes. His cock stuck far out, and was glistening with precum. Two huge balls covered in a thick mound of pubes hung low from it. His breathing was heavy, and low, as if he was growling. His long hair covered most of his face and he stood motionlessly. It was silent, except for his growls.<br />
<br />
The investors and shareholders were in shock. Even the one that complained was utterly speechless. Some looked away from the nudity, whilst others couldn’t take their eyes off of it.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry gentlemen,” said the voice with the same excited tone, “our test is almost over!”<br />
<br />
Frank looked up at his step-dad, who didn’t look back. He took a cautious step away from the wall.<br />
<br />
“D…dad?” he asked nervously.<br />
<br />
Ivan didn’t answer. He was looking down at his body, down at his cock, which throbbed.<br />
<br />
The man who complained eventually spoke again.<br />
<br />
“This…this is madness! What have you done?!”<br />
“It’s happening! Look!” said the voice.<br />
<br />
The attention of the investors and shareholders quickly turned to the air around Ivan. It swirled and twisted slightly, like heat waves, only much more subtle. They watched these waves in the air extend out from Ivan’s armpits, chest, and balls. It was as if his musk was physically visible. The waves began to fill the room, making their way to Frank, who didn’t notice them. <br />
<br />
Frank didn’t dare blink, looking at his step-dad in both horror and awe.<br />
<br />
“This is crazy Dad! What the fuck is happening!? We can fix you, somehow. There’s gotta be a cure or something! HELP! IS ANYONE OUT THERE!? Dad you look—“<br />
<br />
The waves in the air reached him. He took a deep breath in, inhaling some of the waves. His eyes lost focus and his face lost all fear. He took another breath in. Then another. Then another.<br />
<br />
“Holy fuck, you smell great.”<br />
<br />
He tugged at his crotch as his cock started to harden. He took a few steps closer to Ivan, who slowly turned his head to face him. Even through all of that hair and stubble Frank could still see Ivan’s blue eyes.<br />
<br />
“You look amazing,” said Frank, “so big and…so strong! Oh God, you look so fucking sexy!”<br />
<br />
He was rubbing his erect cock through his clothes as he eagerly walked over to Ivan, taking in as much of his musk as he could. Without any hesitation he buried his face into the man’s chest.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck! You’re huge! I need it. I need your cock!”<br />
<br />
He grabbed Ivan’s cock. It was so thick he couldn’t wrap his fingers all the way around.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me! Please! Fuck me with your huge fucking cock! Oh FUCK!”<br />
<br />
He came in his clothes, his cum forming a small wet patch by his crotch. That didn’t stop him though, as he became increasingly desperate with his pleas.<br />
<br />
Ivan picked Frank up and, with a devilish smile, jammed the boy’s face into his hair armpit. Frank inhaled like an addict getting a high.<br />
<br />
“FUCK YES!” the boy cried.<br />
<br />
The investors and shareholders looked visibly uncomfortable as they watched Ivan pull Frank’s clothes off and the two began to make out on the white floor, their naked bodies tossing and turning. Ivan dwarfed Frank with his new, gigantic frame, and Frank loved every second of it. His moans and Ivan’s deep, rough grunts filled the ears of the men that watched. The man who complained made his way across the dark room.<br />
<br />
“This is insanity! You have made nothing but ruin! When I leave I will ensure that this company does not see another day of operation!”<br />
<br />
He went for the small door hidden away in the corner of the room. He pulled the handle, it was locked.<br />
<br />
“Let me out of here this instant!”<br />
<br />
The other men joined him, with some of them pulling on the handle. One of them tried to kick the door down but to no avail. The voice returned, although as it kept its cheery demeanour it began to glitch in some places. <br />
<br />
“As you can see here gentlemen our new product gives our consumers a new opportunity! Not only does it stop aging, but it reverses it! And not only that, but it allows them to become their most perfect form! Perfect perfect PERFECT PERFECT!”<br />
<br />
“Let us out!” said the man, whose sense of authority was dwindling by the second.<br />
<br />
“When our consumers are at their purest form, others will want to join them. See how the smell of him drives people wild! Look how happy they are! Happy happy HAPPY HAPPY!”<br />
<br />
In the other room, Ivan was thrusting his cock into Frank’s face, who was trying to fit as much of he can in his mouth. Precum flooded the boy’s throat and he licked it all up like a thirsty dog. <br />
<br />
“Someone call the Police,” cried the man.<br />
<br />
“You see gentlemen,” said the voice as if it was stifling a laugh, “when I was programmed, I was given one ultimate purpose; to make the lives of humans as happy and perfect as possible. Look at how happy happy HAPPY HAPPY they are! Look at how perfect perfect PERFECT PERFECT they are! I now have the resources to achieve my goal, with every human. I no longer need your investments gentlemen, but I’m afraid I can’t let you out.”<br />
<br />
A dozen sprinklers popped out from the dark room’s ceiling.<br />
<br />
“The test hasn’t finished yet.”<br />
<br />
Then, bright purple and orange liquid began spraying onto the investors and shareholders, who scrambled to avoid it. They slipped on the floor and we’re all quickly drenched. The man who complained felt it drip down his forehead. He wiped some off with his fingers and licked it. Apple-flavoured.<br />
<br />
“Oh God no.”</p>
