<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul was alone in the house in her mother’s body, once more reading about the medallion on her computer when the doorbell rang. She had left the door open so it was obvious someone was home. She heard a familiar voice call ‘Are you home Paul? I have your winnings’ It was Dave.<br />
<br />
Quickly she stood up wanting to not be caught in Paul’s room. She raced down the hallway to intercept Dave. ‘Paul are you there?’ he asked a second time. Fortunately he had not entered the house. <br />
<br />
‘Hi Dave. What brings you here?’ <br />
<br />
‘Hi Mrs Jenkinson. Is Paul home? He won a bet we made. I wanted to deliver his prize’ Dave brandished the new NBA game<br />
<br />
‘Actually no’ Paul had to think up an excuse. ‘He’s actually taken Madeline back to her own house on the train. He won’t be back until late’ Paul was satisfied that answer would explain why neither Paul nor Madeline were around.<br />
<br />
‘Bugger. I was really looking forward to trying it out’<br />
<br />
Paul looked at the game in Paul’s hands. She was looking forward to trying it out as well. ‘Come in and have a drink. Did you ride over here?’<br />
<br />
‘Yeah. Thanks. I am a bit thirsty’ Paul opened the screen door and let Dave in. She led the way to the kitchen. <br />
<br />
Dave followed Paul’s MILF of a mother to the kitchen. He had always found Mrs Jenkinson attractive. She seemed to be one of those women who got better looking with age. He admired the way her bottom swayed as she walked ahead of him. Then as she poured him a cool drink he couldn’t help but admire her chest. She had a lovely body. He averted his eyes as she handed him the glass. ‘Thanks Mrs Jenkinson’<br />
<br />
‘So is that the new NBA 2K game?’<br />
<br />
‘Yeah’ said Dave. He was surprised that Paul’s Mum recognised the game. ‘It’s just been released. The game store only got their first deliveries today’<br />
<br />
‘And that’s the game Paul won off you in a bet?’<br />
<br />
‘Ah Yeah….’ Dave wasn’t sure how much Mrs Jenkinson knew about that bet.<br />
<br />
‘Well it’s actually for me in that case. I helped him win that bet with a little advice. My price for that was his winnings’<br />
<br />
‘You knew about our bet?’<br />
<br />
‘Sure did. Getting to 1st base. Correct?’ <br />
<br />
Dave turned red. ‘Yeah… We didn’t mean any disrespect….. We respect women a lot…..’<br />
<br />
‘Hey I’m not worried. I just want my winnings’ She led out her hand. Dave passed the game to her. The woman took the game and checked the cover. Her face developed a smile. She turned back to Dave. ‘So how about we try it out?’<br />
....<br />
Dave couldn’t believe what was happening. Mrs Jenkinson proved to be a very capable player on Xbox. She was actually challenging Dave at the new game. They were sitting on Paul’s lounge exactly where he had often played XBox before but instead of his mate sitting beside him it was his mate’s hot MILF of a mother. <br />
<br />
Evidently Mrs Jenkinson often played Xbox with Dave. No wonder Paul was a pretty good player. He had never mentioned that he practiced with his Mom. It was obvious that Paul had taught her though. She made all the same mistakes as Paul. That allowed Dave to keep his nose in front. He eventually won but only just.<br />
<br />
Dave suggested it was time to go home but Mrs Jenkinson instead asked him to stay and suggested they shoot some hoops. Puzzled by her attitude he agreed. His parents would not be expecting him home yet. <br />
<br />
Mrs Jenkinson wasn’t very good at basketball but she was fun to play with. Dave loved the way her breasts bounced as she tried to dodge around him. Her shooting wasn’t all that good either. Invariably she didn’t throw the ball hard enough and her shots landed short. Dave won their mini match 21 to 10. <br />
<br />
After another refreshing drink Mrs Jenkinson glanced at the clock and suggested to Dave ‘It’s probably time you went’ <br />
<br />
…..<br />
<br />
Paul made sure Dave was gone before Mandy returned. She probably cut it a bit fine actually. Paul had forgotten the time, while enjoying a game of basketball against Dave. Her arms felt so weak. By the end of the game she was struggling to throw the basketball hard enough to reach the rim. She had never realised before the differences in musculature between males and females. Mandy was actually fit with all the ballet she did but her arms were not very strong.<br />
<br />
When they returned to the kitchen, she saw the time and hurried Dave out. Her Mum would be on her way back home. Dave could not discover that there were two Mrs Jenkinson’s. <br />
<br />
Luckily Mandy had stopped at the shops on the way home. She had promised Paul Thai tonight.. Her changing Paul into herself last night had really caused a problem. Now Paul was stuck as a woman for the next 6 days. She felt terribly guilty. She bought wine and chocolates. Her favourites. She figured that as Paul now had her body and tastebuds it might cheer her up. She even bought Paul a bunch of flowers. She would have liked to have received flowers had she been put in Paul’s situation.<br />
<br />
By the time Mandy got home Dave was long gone.</p>
