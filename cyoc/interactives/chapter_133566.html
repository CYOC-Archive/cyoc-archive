<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oscar was a very successful man living a very successful life. He made thousand every day thanks to a high paying CEO job at a large oil refinery. On his way up his driveway in his illustrious car, it ran over something in a bump. Hurriedly, he ran out to make sure that he hadn’t hurt someone. <br />
<br />
To his surprise, it looked like a genie lamp of old. He rubbed it eagerly and an immense man built with solid muscle with a wispy amount of smoke leading back into the lamp imerged. <br />
<br />
“Hello master,” the Genie said bowing. “I am Gene, you have 24 hours to make whatever wishes you want.”<br />
<br />
“Not just three?” Oscar said excitedly. “Not too shabby.”<br />
<br />
Gene nodded his head and bowed ceremoniously.<br />
<br />
“I wish that I was the president of my company,” Oscar said. <br />
<br />
Gene was feeling unhelpful today and decided to twist his wording in an awkward way. He reversed time quickly inserting words as he did. <br />
<br />
“I wish that I was to fuck the president of my company tonight,” Oscar said just as confidently. <br />
<br />
Gene snapped his fingers. Nothing happened immediately. It was still a ways off. <br />
<br />
“Well,” Oscar said clapping his hands. “I best prepare for his arrival. He should be here in about an hour.”<br />
<br />
“Why not make a wish?” Gene inquired. <br />
<br />
“Excellent point,” Oscar agreed. “I wish that that I was ready for Mr. Odite and cleaned up.”<br />
<br />
Gene cracked his fingers. What a poorly worded wish, perfect for adding a few adjectives. He reversed time, fine tuning what Oscar “actually” said. <br />
<br />
“I wish that I was permanently naked, ready for Mr. Odite, muscular, and cleaned up,” Oscar said. <br />
<br />
“As YOU wish,” Gene said slyly emphasizing the you. He snapped his fingers and Oscar tore away from his semi casual work clothes as all of his muscles expanded outwards. Any dust or scratches disappeared from his skin, imperfections and acne now gone. His unshaven face as well as his body hair retracted into his body. His feet tore through his shoes. <br />
<br />
The naked muscle man walked in as Gene floated behind him to see his large house spick and spam. I small table had been set up and wine was even poured into glasses. <br />
<br />
The door rang and Oscar eagerly answered it. It wasn’t his boss, Mr. Odite, it was a delivery girl. She took one look at the naked man and shrieked from shock turning away. She dropped the package and ran. <br />
<br />
“Oh no,” Oscar said. He ran up two flights of stairs and into his closet only to find it empty. <br />
<br />
“Genie,” he said as Gene entered the room. “I wish for a shirt and a pair of pants.”<br />
<br />
Lists lists lists. The most easy thing to tamper with. Gene molded the phrases with ease and Oscar said, “I wish for a shirt, four more arms, and a pair of pants.”<br />
<br />
The arms shot out from the muscular Oscar’s torso, two on each side. He flexed all of them in lustful unison. A t shirt and some pants dropped down on his head. He threw them off him an quickly tried to put the shirt over himself. Like a phantom of sorts, the shirt fell right through him and onto the ground beneath his feet. He slipped his legs through the pair of pants only to let go and have them suffer the same fate. <br />
<br />
“Ugh,” Oscar said annoyed rubbing his head with two hands and scratching various other extremities of the body with the other. <br />
<br />
“Genie,” Oscar said. “I wish that Mr. Odite wouldn’t be disgusted by me in this state.”<br />
<br />
With a swoosh it became, “I wish that Mr. Odite wouldn’t be disgusted by me or of himself in this state.”<br />
<br />
Gene snapped his fingers and by chance, Mr. Odite showed up shortly after, calling through the house for Gene<br />
<br />
“Don’t fret Oscar,” Gene said. “No one can see or perceive anything you say to me or I say to you.”<br />
<br />
Oscar called out to Mr. Odite to come upstairs. Mr. Idiots entered the room and looked indentical to Oscar. It was as if Gene had cloned Oscar. He was naked and muscular and even had all six arms. <br />
<br />
“Please,” Mr. Odite said. “Call me James.”<br />
<br />
James through himself at Oscar and the two vigorously began fucking each other. Gene stood next to them, patiently waiting for an order. <br />
<br />
“Ge...Genie,” Oscar said gasping. “I...I wish for there to be another James here.”<br />
<br />
Gene reversed time and Oscar said instead, “I wish for there to be another James every second here to fuck.”<br />
<br />
Gene snapped his fingers and in walked another identical James. And another, and another, and another. Soon, they were all piling up on top of each other. Each having six arm muscle sex with each other slamming their dicks into various other identical beings. <br />
<br />
Gene had to move away as the pile had become rather large after a minute. After about an hour, the large mound of fucking men had seeped into Oscar’s bathroom and out into the hallway. <br />
<br />
Gene materialized a book and began to read out on Oscar’s lawn. After two hours, he turned around to hear a window break as things became to unbelievably crowded for the thousands of people crammed to the brim inside. An extremely loud moaning noise permeated the house. <br />
<br />
“Genie”<br />
<br />
Gene perked his highly sensitive gearing up. <br />
<br />
“Genie,” Oscar was saying form somewhere in the house. “I’m done. I wish for them to go.”<br />
<br />
Genie thought a moment and then twisted time, instead having him say, “I wish for them to go double their efforts.”<br />
<br />
The moaning increased in volume and speed. More windows began breaking as more and more men began to appear and fuck. Night had fallen and many neighbors were out of their mind worried. They had called various police forces and even a fire truck came. One of the men had gone and tore himself free of the enlarging mass and ran towards Gene. One of the men went to follow but was cut short by another jabbing his penis into him. <br />
<br />
“Genie,” Oscar said panting from exhaustion. “I...l wish for everyone here to just go.”<br />
<br />
Genie sighed, but would not give in. “I wish for everyone here to just go fuck me hard.”<br />
<br />
The nervous police officers dropped their weapons. The fire men hopped off their truck and began stripping their clothes off, same with the police officers. The house lurched as the increasing number of James surged out of the house in the direction of Oscar. The genie flew up as a man pile of six armed men and buff police officers and firemen tackled each other to get their hands onto Oscar. More and more James materialized from the house pushing heir way to the center. <br />
<br />
“Genie,” Oscar said as Gene picked it up with ease. “I wish for them to stop.”<br />
<br />
“I wish for them to stop and try harder.”<br />
<br />
The men all tried much mischief harder to reach Oscar literally throwing each other into the air to reach him. <br />
<br />
“Genie, I can’t breathe under here, they weigh too much. I wish I could hold them all up.”<br />
<br />
“I wish I could fuck and hold them all up simultaneously.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly all the me were pushed aside. Oscar now stood at least double his height. His arms shot out at various men and grabbed them with huge fist all the way around their torso. He began growing more dicks and more arms at a rapid pace in order to grab and ice all of the men there. Even as more James appeared (two every second) he still grew another arm that shot out to grab the incoming James and another penis to stretch out and jab into that very same James. Soon, one could barely see any other part of Oscar’s body, and he began to grow arms on his arms and dicks on his dicks. There was an extremely ear piercing loud moan and cum was raining down from every part of the conglomerate. <br />
<br />
Gene yawned and went back to reading his book, this time in one of Oscar’s neighbor’s lawns as the show continued. Gene sat there, awaiting Oscar’s next wish.</p>
