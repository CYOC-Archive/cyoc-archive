<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julia and Sabrina decided to go out for breakfast at Denny&#39;s, a place where Julia had always caught the early bird special prior to her hospitalization because, well...she was old, and elderly is as elderly does. But now, in this new day and age, the famous chain restaurant at 8:00 A.M in the morning wasn&#39;t filled with crusty retirees and the sense of impending death. It was filled with youth, vitality, and hope. Julia walked by a couple that she saw regularly at Denny&#39;s during her regular visits. She had never talked to the man or woman, but had eavesdropped on their conversations enough times to feel that she knew them somewhat. They were a typical, sweet old grandparents, much like herself. Now, after the Great Change, they were a pair of star-crossed teenage looking girls staring longingly into one another&#39;s eyes and gripping each others hands. Julia smiled at them as she walked by with her new booty call/friend Sabrina Carter.<br />
<br />
Julia and Sabrina sat down for breakfast. Sabrina ordered pancakes with strawberry maple syrup and some breakfast sausages, and Julia, deciding to break ritual, ordered the exact same thing. The waitress, Amanda, was good friends with the elderly Ms. Armitage and was not sure what to think now that she looked like she could be one of Amanda&#39;s sorority sisters. Nevertheless, she was happy the woman was doing well and took her and her friend&#39;s order. <br />
<br />
Sabrina was dressed in a white off the should top and had her hair styled in a braided ponytail. She grinned at Julia and wondered where life was going to take her next.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Dumbass White Bitch almost had a heart attack when she saw her Queen dressed in full dominatrix gear, strips of black leather barely covering up Kira&#39;s extremities, her cleavage smooshed together to make the petite woman seem a lot bustier than was possible on such a tiny frame. She even had a cute little black cap on. <br />
<br />
A chair and a bundle of rope were present. Oddly, a straight razor was sitting on Kira&#39;s already made bed. DWB was getting nervous, and being nervous made her more excited, which made her more horny. She was starting to sweat even though she wasn&#39;t fat anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit&quot; said Kira with a typically commanding but monotone voice, and DWB sat in the chair. Kira began to monologue:<br />
<br />
&quot;Reservoir Dogs is probably my favorite movie, and anybody who knows anything knows about that movie knows about when Michael Madsen cuts off that cops ear off. Now, Dumbass White Bitch, I don&#39;t want to do that to you, because while I may be a bitch, I&#39;m not a psycho, and you don&#39;t want me to do that to you. Do you know why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um..um, because you&#39;d go to jail for a really long time?&quot; DWB hiccuped. She crossed and then uncrossed her left leg, and kept fidgeting the entire time. This chair was getting uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, exactly. Brownie points for the white slave. Have a cookie, slave!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kira tossed a chocolate chip mini cookie at DWB, and DWB caught it in her mouth like a dog. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl!&quot; clapped Kira. &quot;What I&#39;m going to do today is take you to their furthest reaches of submission your ass has ever been.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kira bent down and stared at DWB straight in the eye and began massaging her left breast. &quot;If you&#39;re good, you get a paddling. If you&#39;re bad, you get a paddling.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kira took the rope and began to tie the white girl up really good, using the best knots she knew. She put the razor just barely within her subs reach on the floor. If DWB could grab it with her feet or knock her chair over and get it with her hands, she could cut herself free!<br />
<br />
&quot;The first thing I want you to do&quot; said Kira, &quot;is try and escape from this in less than a half hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Millie told Juliana her belief that she might have been trans this whole time and not even realized it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt it&quot; said Juliana. &quot;If you really were, you would have realized it a LOT sooner, believe me. I have a cousin who is...was a trans woman, and she knew when she was five that she was meant to be a girl. She&#39;s coming to the wedding too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re probably right&quot; said Millie. &quot;But this just feels so RIGHT now, you know? It&#39;s like, it&#39;s only been a few days, and I can&#39;t even imagine what being a man is like anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I feel that too. I think that it&#39;s just the aftereffects of whatever did this, because it CAN&#39;T be natural. Whoever did this wanted men to be gone, and whoever did this probably added, &quot;Hey, and make the new women comfortable in their bodies too&quot;, because otherwise we&#39;d just see a bunch of women signing up for therapy to become trans-men. I&#39;m beginning to sound like a conspiracy nut&quot; giggled Juliana, &quot;but some witch that made a magic spell that affected the whole world the only thing that makes sense so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s also, look at the old me. I was a man teaching little kids. Now I&#39;m a woman teaching little kids. Somehow that just feels more appropriate, you know? But I know that sounds terrible, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s because you were insecure about being a male Kindergarten teacher?&quot; said Juliana, taking the words right out of Millie&#39;s mouth. Millie formed a small grin and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I mean, I was constantly worrying that moms or someone would think that I was some pervert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can relate&quot; said her Latin lover. &quot;I&#39;m assistant principle, remember? Christ, some people think that no man that&#39;s isn&#39;t their father should be anywhere near a kid, and sometimes not even fathers either. It&#39;s a really unhealthy belief to have. I mean, I get it, there are predators everywhere, and most of them are men, but one of the reasons I went into education in the first place was just to prove that I could be a good male role model for kids, you know? That I was someone they could talk to and trust.&quot;<br />
<br />
Millie laughed. &quot;Guess you don&#39;t have to worry about that anymore&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, I guess not&quot; laughed Juliana. &quot;Still, that really sucks that people had to go through that kind of insecurity before the Great Change fixed everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, babe&quot; said Millie, kissing Juliana on the lips, their breasts smooshing together. Juliana said through a tongue filled embrace &quot;I love you more, cutie&quot;.<br />
<br />
**<br />
Once Regina understood the implications of what was going on, her jaw slowly began to drop.<br />
<br />
&quot;This&quot; she said slowly, &quot;THIS is what caused the Great Change? Two women and a magic ring?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently&quot; said Aziz, trying to assuage her new friend&#39;s slow burning anger. Regina moved to confiscate the ring from the white woman&#39;s finger before James blocked her from moving.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t&quot; said James quietly, scared. &quot;One of the things that are against the rules is altering the past. It just causes too much trouble. This timeline is finished, let it go. I doubt we could get the ring off her finger anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the very first thing you do with wishing artifacts is to wish that they can&#39;t harm the owner or leave their possession. It&#39;s just common sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I mean why is time travel against the rules? You said there is a multiverse. Unless the multiverse operates under more magical gobbledygook rules that don&#39;t make any sense, one of the simplest ways of describing how a multiverse would operate is that more or less every possible outcome exists within its own universe. If I can take that ring from her, and I wish for things to return to the way they were, it wouldn&#39;t affect the universe in which it did happen, but create a new one. Are you following me so far?&quot;<br />
<br />
James sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You raise an interesting point, but I&#39;ve seen things like this before, and they lead to escalation, a time war. What becomes reality and what isn&#39;t is perpetually up in the air.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, a big timey wimey ball, I take it?&quot; joked Aziz, referencing Doctor Who.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose&quot; said James.<br />
<br />
Regina asked &quot;Am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure&quot; admitted the man sheepishly. &quot;I&#39;ve...I&#39;ve never actually thought gone through with it. I&#39;ve only seen reports of sorcerers and sorceresses of old and the things that they did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina asked &quot;Have you ever considered those were just lies to keep people from exploring the depths of reality? Magic can do anything apparently. If the universe can be altered so thoroughly as it did to turn me into this so casually, than there&#39;s no limits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets try it then. Like good scientists, lets jump into the unknown and see where it takes us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about us?&quot; asked Aziz. &quot;I like being a queer woman for now, as do you. If we wish away the Great Change, we will return to our previous bodies and lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry&quot; said Regina, putting a comforting hand on Aziz&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I know just the right wish to make.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina suddenly became visible, appearing in front of Jean and Greta. James and Aziz had also appeared behind the two half-naked lovebirds, holding them down on the floor. Aziz had wondered if she could have just pinned them down with magic, but she hadn&#39;t gotten that far into her book yet. Regina saw the scared look of Greta, hair normally pinned up all wild and free from the intercourse with Jean, as the strange but beautiful young Chinese woman delicately picked the ring from her finger and put in on her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish&quot; said Regina, &quot;that with the exception of Aziz and I, the Great Change never happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ring glowed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the hallway was empty. James and Aziz walked to a window and saw men walking down the street, driving in traffic, little boys coming home from school.<br />
<br />
&quot;It worked!&quot; said Aziz.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we have to see if this is the real universe we originally came from or a parallel universe&quot; said Regina. &quot;C&#39;mon, lets go and travel the multiverse some more&quot; as she climbed aboard the machine.</p>
