<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cindy couldn&#39;t believe what she had heard. She had wondered how Jeff&#39;s cock was able to transform her, but she never imagined that a machine had given him that power.  She didn&#39;t understand exactly how he had used it, or how it worked. But she had heard one important thing about the machine - actually the only thing she really cared about the machine -  it had the capability to reverse the changes that had happened to her.<br />
<br />
As Cindy had fled the locker room, her body continued to change as she ran.  She quickly grew larger, tearing through her small cheerleader outfit.  Luckily, most of her body was covered in bright yellow fur by then.  She was afraid that as she ran by the classrooms, which were rapidly emptying as the students were leaving their classrooms and making their way to the next class, someone might have recognized her face.  But when she passed a window, she saw that she had a long blonde muzzle with a white snout that would not be recognized with anyone.  <br />
<br />
She was almost to the parking lot, where she had ridiculously hoped to get into her car and drive away (a feat impossible due to her massive size), when she saw Les.  Les saw her, too, and after a brief shocked pause, she smiled and gave chase, screaming her name like a fool as they ran.  Les was about to catch up to her, but as her legs continued to grow, Cindy was able to easily outpace her and lose her in the school hallways.  <br />
<br />
She had quickly doubled back to the locker room, thinking - logically -  that it would be the last place they would come to look for her.  She also wanted to get some more answers from the freak with the magic dick;  hopefully he knew of a way to reverse what he done to her.  When she entered the locker room, she saw him still passed out on the floor.  She looked at his dick, now flaccid and partially retracted into his sheath, and began to feel that strange desire again.  A desire to be penetrated by that massive cock. She fought these urges, and was about to shake him awake when the door started to open.  She ran behind the next row of lockers, hidden from view and eavesdropped on Jeff and Elizabeth&#39;s conversation.<br />
<br />
Their conversation was actually sweet, and  Cindy was a little touched by the love they had for each other.  Cindy began to see Jeff in a different light.  He wasn&#39;t the freak she had originally imagined, a sexual pervert.  He was actually a pretty nice guy; maybe even boyfriend material.  But regardless of how she felt towards Jeff, what mattered the most to her was getting back to normal.<br />
<br />
Now that Jeff and Liz were gone, Cindy emerged from her hiding spot, and walked over to the mirror to examine herself.  She was an anthro-horse, of course, just like Les and Brit, but she was much taller, well over 8 feet she gauged as her head brushed the ceiling of the locker room.  Thankfully, she lacked Leslie&#39;s massive muscles (in her opinion, whey made her look like a man)  and she still had her figure, with an hourglass waist, a flat toned stomach, and a large but firm heart-shaped ass. Her breasts however had ballooned to cartoonish dimensions.  She doubted that she would be able to contain them in anything less than a JJ cup bra.  Her fur was nice, though.  It was a bright light blonde color, similar to her hair, with white splotches on the tip of her snout, her hands, wrists, ankles and feet.  <br />
<br />
Although she looked good for an anthro-horse girl, she had no desire to remain this way, and she decided that her best option was to follow Jeff to his house and use the program.  It apparently had a password lock, but she had heard the password - Family. <br />
<br />
 How sweet, she thought.<br />
<br />
Getting to Jeff&#39;s house was going to be a problem.  She saw Jeff and Elizabeth enter his large van, but she realized that her car was now much too small for her to fit in.  She decided to walk.  It might take a while, but she would get there.  Surprisingly, she found that with her new body, she could actually run pretty fast, maybe even faster than anyone on the track team.  She made it to Jeff&#39;s house much quicker than she expected.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Liz were already there, and she could see a light flashing from the window of Elizabeth&#39;s room at the end of the hall on the second floor.  Cindy had to stand on their air conditioner, which groaned in protest under her weight, so she could just barely peak into the window.  She saw the brother and sister talking animatedly, but she couldn&#39;t hear what they were saying.  Jeff was sitting at the computer typing, while Elizabeth stood over him talking and occasionally pointing to the screen, apparently guiding him in his choices.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jeff stood up and dropped his pants and underwear, revealing his large sheath.  She watched in amazement as it slowly shrank and receded, turning into a small human 3 inch cock.   <br />
<br />
Maybe he&#39;s not such great boyfriend material after all, she thought a little sadly. She realized that she was really going to miss that cock.  That had been the best fuck of her life, even if it was very strange.  It was tight, and seemed to hit just the right spots to get her wet.  She shook her head, clearing the lust from her head.  <br />
<br />
When she looked up, Jeff and Liz were gone.  She jumped off the air conditioner, noting that she had left two large, deep indentations where she had stood on the unit.  She wondered if it might not work anymore.  She stayed hidden behind the house, and peaked around the corner, watching Jeff and Liz leave in their van again.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t know where they were going but she really didn&#39;t care.  The house was now empty and unguarded.  It was her chance to use the machine.</p>
