<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morning at the Lawson house came early, as it almost always did. Much of it had been the fact that Evan Lawson&#39;s military career, particularly during peacetime or home deployments had played to a heavily regulated schedule. You got up early, were on duty for much of, if not most of the day, and came home in the early evening. That schedule often limited what could be done as a family, often because Maggie Lawson had also sought out work to help pay bills and carry on. This was something that often came about when Evan had been on combat missions that required his SEAL team and the potential drop in direct income when that happened. And while that potential confusion had often set up situations where Spencer Lawson was left alone during the day, she still had to get up early... even on non-school days.<br />
<br />
Evan&#39;s retirement and the family&#39;s return to Moon Lake didn&#39;t change that. Spencer was soon reminded of that when she felt a firm hand shaking her foot through the blankets. She blinked for a few moments and looked at her bedside clock and saw that it was seven fifty AM on a Sunday. She then gave a grunt and groan before looking over her shoulder to find that it was her father shaking her foot. For the moment she just buried her face in her pillow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ungh! It&#39;s a Sunday!&quot; Spencer protested, though her voice was a bit muffled by cotton of her pillowcase and the material that her pillow was made of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sunday,&quot; Evan answered, &quot;and we let you sleep in a bit. But there is still things to do... like homework.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spencer gave another groan before she threw off the blankets and began to groggily get up. She wasn&#39;t necessarily sleepy, as weres seemed to need less sleep than normal humans did, and in many ways she was fairly used to the schedule that her parents held her to. That didn&#39;t however mean that she didn&#39;t like sleeping, particularly on days when she didn&#39;t have be up early.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother is making French Toast,&quot; Evan spoke from the doorway to her bedroom, &quot;it should make for an excellent start and will let us be able to have some time as a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... family,&quot; Spencer said slowly with a sigh as she watched her father head out and allowing her to get dressed in peace.<br />
<br />
The Lawsons didn&#39;t have a bad family life and Spencer knew her parents loved her. The &quot;worst&quot; that was there was largely limited to her father&#39;s past duties with the Navy SEALs and her mother&#39;s work as a nurse, shortening the time available for the family to be there as a family unit, but there had generally been enough interaction that Spencer wasn&#39;t too worried on that. The biggest thing that had hit her since they&#39;d moved to Moon Lake was largely the interaction with Moon Lake&#39;s weres, which was something that she didn&#39;t have that much experience with outside her own family. Of course, Spencer being a hybrid were was something of a surprise to those she&#39;d met at school, but people seemed to be adapting.<br />
<br />
The thing that had Spencer the most perplexed was some specific friends she&#39;d made in past week or so. One was a Morgan Barr, a young werewolf who was about her age and he seemed nice enough. Though he&#39;d also struck Morgan as somewhat isolated because of his parents&#39; opposition to weres being vaccinated, which then kept Morgan from being able to make friends as Moon Lake&#39;s school district had to require vaccinations so that they were in line with public school health requirements. Spencer was happy to help him let things develop from there in some ways with him, though if it was unknown if that would ever develop into something more than a platonic relationship that happened to be a &quot;friends with benefits&quot; situation as well. But Morgan wasn&#39;t the only thing, there was also Eric Anderson, a young weremer that she&#39;d met.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t the bulkiest of weres, but there was just something about him that Spencer couldn&#39;t help but be attracted to. At the same time he had a girlfriend that he was also very close to that was a fellow weremer. It was something different, as Spencer had never had much chance to meet weres aside from her parents and the weremer aspect of the meeting actually intrigued Spencer and she rather liked the girlfriend too. That had drawn up some real desires in Spencer that she didn&#39;t expect. She could accept that Eric and Julie would likely marry when they grew up, for from what her mother had told her, weremers tended to know who their &quot;one true love&quot; was pretty firmly, but while they were not married, Spencer didn&#39;t see a problem with the desire for some fun with the both of them. However, Spencer had not yet found a way to convey her desires in a way that wouldn&#39;t come off as pushy, as trying to split the two weremers up wasn&#39;t among her list of goals. That was really the thing that frustrated her the most.<br />
<br />
Spencer eventually made her way down and found her mother setting down plates of French toast down on a modest table with the assorted sides placed near the center of the table. There was maple syrup, margarine, blueberries, cool whip,  and some other toppings that went along with French Toast. Maggie wasn&#39;t in her nurse&#39;s uniform, which meant that if she had to work that day, it would be later in the day. Spencer could also hear something crackling coming out of the kitchen, and she thought she could smell bacon cooking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, dear,&quot; Maggie spoke as she noticed Spencer slide her chair out, &quot;Sleep well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Spencer said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t troubled any more by any &quot;heat&quot; issues, were you?&quot; Maggie asked her daughter, remembering that had been an issue put Spencer into a sort of overdrive that neither Maggie nor Evan had been ready for, particularly as both of them had grown up in Moon Lake as weres themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, mom,&quot; Spencer answered, hoping her mother didn&#39;t get into any details on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; Maggie answered as she looked up to see Evan come in with a pan of sizzling bacon in one hand and a spatula in the other, &quot;and how goes the efforts making friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Generally pretty good,&quot; Spencer answered as she leaned back to let her father lay down a few strips of bacon on her plate and hoping they didn&#39;t get too interested in details as she was fairly confident she could find a way to working things through with her situation with Morgan as well as with Eric and Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Evan smiled to his daughter he moved along to lay down some bacon slices to both his plate and to Maggie&#39;s, &quot;though right now it may be best to be careful with what you get into...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to get into drugs, dad,&quot; Spencer answered, &quot;and the people I&#39;ve made friends with aren&#39;t into that either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan gave his daughter a small smile and sighed, &quot;that&#39;s good to hear... but not quite what I was referring to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was this that whole reveal thing?&quot; Maggie wondered as she looked over to her husband as he walked behind Spencer who sat down and began eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if they get a great plan quickly and get it out there... this thing is still going to be problematic for many in Moon Lake,&quot; Evan nodded, &quot;particularly those that would prefer to stick with &quot;tradition&quot; over other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spencer looked up and followed her father with her eyes as he took the now empty pan back to the kitchen and then returned to the breakfast table. He&#39;d gotten job as an instructor with Tachibana Enterprise&#39;s Security Division. In theory that part of the company provided security for the main company&#39;s assets, but from Spencer had also heard that the training center also did a fair amount of training for just about any body-guard or local private security agency as well. Her father likely got the job because of his experience in the military, and all of that gave him some advantage with regard to knowing things about security threats and the like.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may not have been paying attention... but why all this fuss?&quot; Spencer asked, &quot;wouldn&#39;t the guy who proposed it think it better to stay out of sight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From the reporting... I think his reasoning is that the secret isn&#39;t likely to last for much longer anyway,&quot; Evan said slowly, &quot;thus better to get it out before things come out in a bad way and present a bad narrative.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be a good,&quot; Maggie said slowly, &quot;assuming the response is positive...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And until we can know... or at least have some hint of that... that will mean there will be the potential for fights and arguments over this,&quot; Evan commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure that will go over well at the hospital...&quot; Maggie gave a sigh as Evan sat down.<br />
<br />
Spencer, for the moment sat and listened. She didn&#39;t have any plans to pick a fight, but the conversation was moving in a direction where she was more likely to go along with her father&#39;s advice. She also privately felt relieved that the conversation wasn&#39;t focusing on her own private frustrations at the moment.</p>
