<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monica woke up drenched in her own urine, but was feeling refreshed and lot better.  As she rose up to a sitting position, she noticed that the seat of her diaper felt super neat.  It as slippery and squishy again.  She wiggled and giggled squishing her mess all around her bottom and some of her poop leaked out of her diaper and onto the vinyl mattress.  The music and lights had stopped leaving her in the dim crib and all she could hear was the faint crinkling of her diaper and vinyl mattress.  The teacher heard Monica stir and knew she was awake.  She had gone over to the crib, unlocked the latches, pulled down the door, and stored it away underneath the mattress near the bottom of the floor.  She then held Monica&#39;s hand and gently guided her out of the crib and guided her over to the changing table.  The mattress of the crib was so low that Monica really didn&#39;t need much assistance getting out of the crib.  When Monica waddled up to the changing table she had to wait a small bit of time because the teacher noticed that Monica&#39;s shortalls clearly had poo smeared on them.  And so, the teacher had to open up the cabinet, pull out all of the supplies, and place down a disposable bed pad on the mattress of the changing table.  Because this changing only had night-time diapers, the ones with all ten drips colored in, the teacher had no choice but to put Monica in one.  Meanwhile back at Monica&#39;s house, all of her diapers had puffed up considerably and and now had ten black drips printed on them while her panties thickened into cloth training pants with a waterproof layer.  On the package of diapers in her closet, the wording changed so that it read, &quot;Maximum day or night protection for heavy loss of bladder and bowel control&quot;.  The teacher helped Monica up the changing table, strapped her in, and began the process of changing Monica&#39;s diaper.  This time, monkey wasn&#39;t around, but Monica had long since forgotten about him.  In no time, the teacher had Monica in a fresh new, much thicker, diaper.  Unfortunately there were no fresh clothes available meaning that Monica was wearing her special helmet, a long green bib with a crumb catcher to cover her exposed breasts and her socks and shoes.  The teacher didn&#39;t pay Monica&#39;s breasts any mind.  After all, Monica was a seven year old kid who hadn&#39;t developed them yet.  Because Monica slept so late and because the day was closing, there was no other activity to do except eat supper, board the bus, and go home.  The teacher wheeled up Monica&#39;s stroller/wheelchair and helped Monica in and securing the straps over her.  Monica placed her feet into the cups of her new foot board and allowed the teacher to strap her shoes in.  Monica could no longer raise her feet, but that was okay because she could still wiggle her knees.  At least until the teacher snapped Monica&#39;s new knee abductor in place separating her knees and giving the teacher a wide view of the very conspicuous wetness indicators running through Monica&#39;s crotch.  Monica could still wiggle her knees a little and bash them against the soft vinyl covered padding of her abductor.  The teacher then snapped Monica&#39;s stroller/wheelchair tray into place completely locking Monica safely in.  Monica leaned back in her chair, but hit something that was padded behind her.  It was a good thing that Monica&#39;s brand new curved wing headrest was thickly padded and covered in vinyl.  No one would want Monica to get a head injury when she decided to bang her head against her headrest.  However, Monica discovered that it felt good to bang her helmet covered head against the headrest and so she did it repeatedly while banging her knees into the knee abductor.  The teacher didn&#39;t care as she knew that Monica was safe.  She wheeled Monica out of the room being sure to press her palm against the palm reader to buzz herself through locked steel door into the main class room.  She then wheeled Monica to a random spot in the center of the classroom.  The teacher momentarily left, but returned with a single jar of stage 3 baby food labeled, &quot;Spaghetti in Tomato Sauce.&quot;  If one looked closely at the jar, one would have noticed that the spaghetti was really very thin noodles that were only two millimeters long at best.  Because they had been cooked in the jar, the noodles were extremely soft and would disintegrate with the lightest touch.  The teacher popped open the lid to the jar and spooned the contents out on Monica&#39;s tray.  The teacher then placed Monica&#39;s double handled white and clear sippy cup on the tray.  This time, however, the spout was made of clear silicone and was screwed into place with a white ring similar to how one could screw the nipple of a bottle closed for a baby&#39;s feeding.  Once again, Monica tried to pincer grasp her food, but failed miserably.  All she could do was pat and rub her hand into the sticky goo and bring her hands to her face to try to lick the goo while rubbing it all over her face, hair, bib, and helmet.  She ate all of her spaghetti the best she could because this meal was her most favorite and nummiest of all the meals she had today.  It was even blander than lunch, but she could still taste tomato and beef.  When finished, she grabbed the handle of her sippy cup and titled it almost up-side-down and put the silicone spout into her mouth and started to suck.  Yup, still tasted the same!  The silicone spout was able to hold back from dribbling formula when Monica tipped it over.  She emptied the formula in no time and dropped the sippy cup onto the ground below.  The teacher noticing this, picked up the sippy cup, removed Monica&#39;s tray and bib and disappeared for a moment.  While the teacher was gone, Monica started to bang her head against the headrest again for fun.  When the teacher returned with Monica&#39;s clean tray and a fresh bib, she noticed Monica banging her head, but didn&#39;t say a word.  Instead she pulled out a diaper wipe and cleaned Monica.  It was tricky because Monica banged her head during the entire process, but the teacher managed well enough to get her clean.  The teacher placed a new bib on her.  This time a mint green bib made of silicone with a molded in crumb catcher.  With the day closed, she wheeled Monica over to another metal door, scanned herself into the hall and made her way to the exit.  She then scanned herself out of the building, the doors opening automatically, and wheeled Monica over to the busses so that she could be lifted on.  Once she was lifted on, she was placed right beside the female bus worker, but not beside a window, and was had her stroller/wheelchair strapped to the bus&#39; floor.  All the way home she&#39;d had a grand time banging her head against her headrest and banging her knees against the abductor between her legs.  Once she was home, her stroller/wheelchair was unstrapped from the bus, wheeled to the lift, elevated down off the bus on the lift, and then wheeled into her ground floor bedroom which had changed considerably while she was gone.  The female worker said her goodbyes in a sing-song fashion and left Monica in her wheelchair to contend with a headache.  When Monica gained her adult senses, her mind was reeling.  She&#39;d shat in her sleep and then woke up to wiggle around in her shitty diaper and made a mess of that strange bed she was in.  She&#39;d realized that had it not been for her bib, she would have exposed her breasts to everyone.  The formula she drank was disgusting and the food she ate got progressively worse.  She realized that she must have looked stupid when she was banging her head and even stupider during music time when she squatted down and up over and over again to &quot;dance&quot;.  But through it all she had fun?  It was too much for her.  She removed her tray and abductor from her wheelchair and unstrapped herself and her feet using the buckles.  She looked around the room and noticed a few changes, but was too depressed to care.  She needed to speak with Madame Illusia again.  She knew what she had to do.  She knew that Madame Illusia wouldn&#39;t let her out of her punishment, but maybe Madame Illusia could turn her into an actual retarded seven year old who was slowly regressing.  She didn&#39;t want to get dressed, She wanted Madame to see what she looked like.  She picked up her keys, walked out of the house, got in her car, and drove to the carnival.  She&#39;d entered Madame&#39;s tent, the crowd laughing and jeering at her diapered state.  She approached the stage.  She waved at Madame Illusia and watched as some random person was being turned into a rat who scurried away.  Madame Illusia waved Monica up on stage and asked,&quot; What brings you back, Monica?&quot;  Monica replied, &quot;I&#39;m sorry about yelling at you about Damon&#39;s going to Pre-K.  I imagine that you wouldn&#39;t want to change me back to normal.  So, if you can&#39;t will you please just make me become that stupid seven-year-old girl who lives at the school who is trying to regress me even further?&quot;  &quot;You&#39;re right, Monica, I don&#39;t want to change you back, but I will grant you mercy.  You will go home tonight and enjoy your final night in your home with Damon.  Leave your clothes on just as they are and fall asleep in your plastic Disney Princess twin bed.  Don&#39;t worry about tripping over the princess themed mesh bed rails on your bed.  The bed is practically on the floor, just crawl in at the foot at the bed where there are no safety rails.  Get under the comfy covers and drift off to sleep.  Your diaper will leak tonight, but don&#39;t worry, the full fitted vinyl mattress cover will protect your mattress.  You will be woken up by the bus driver&#39;s assistant.  You won&#39;t have time to change clothes, so just go over to your special chair and let the assistant strap you in.  You&#39;ll get a chance to say your final goodbyes to Damon before you&#39;re wheeled out to the bus.  As soon as you see that bus, Monica, you&#39;ll forget that Damon ever existed.  You&#39;ll get one more headache, but once that&#39;s done, you will well and truly become that retarded seven-year-old  in mind and body.  Depart now, Monica.  Have a good life, and be safe.  Madame Illusia waved her hand to dismiss Monica, but in reality she magicked in that dormitory that the school was building.  It was not fully stocked, staffed, and operational.  Monica left the tent and returned home.  Exhausted, she gave a hug to Damon before going to bed.  She opened the door to her room and noticed it was dark save for a princess themed night light.  She was sad, that she was going to forget that Damon existed, but it was for the best.  She needed her happiness.  She walked over to the bed, kneeled down to the floor and crawled into bed.  Sure enough there was a crinkle sound not only from her diaper, but also the bed.  She Got under the princess covers, which were indeed comfy and went to sleep.  It was awkward at first because she was wearing her helmet, a silicone bib, and her socks and shoes.  She woke up to someone patting her her shoulder.  She heard a feminine voice, &quot;Wake up, honey, time for school.  You do want to go to school today, don&#39;t you?  Bleary eyed, she did what she was supposed to do.  She got up out of her wet bed, the vinyl and her diaper crinkling and walked over to sit down in her special chair spreading urine all over it.  The assistant strapped her in before securing her feet into the feet cups of her foot board.  They then secured her abductor and tray in place.  She smelled strongly of armpit odor and stale urine, but the bus assistant didn&#39;t say anything.  She sadly looked up to Damon, touched his hand and said, &quot;I love you!&quot;  He simply replied, &quot;I love you too, my special girl.  I&#39;ll see you when you get home after class.&quot;  He clearly didn&#39;t understand what she meant.  She wanted to tell him the truth, but she couldn&#39;t because she was being turned around and wheeled out of her room.  She cried a little, but it didn&#39;t last long.  As she was being wheeled over the threshold of her front door, she saw the bus.  The worst, most agonizing migraine she ever had took over.  It was so bad, she couldn&#39;t think straight.  When it cleared, she was so excited to see the bus again, she wiggled her knees into the abductor.  She just knew that she was going to have another awesome day at her new special school.</p>
