+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next morning began calmly and even quietly, though not without its questions. Particularly for Melissa, as while she had made up her mind to be her family&#39;s were, she wasn&#39;t quite sure on which were to be. And her dream didn&#39;t necessarily prove things either. For one, her supposed werecow form would have an udder between her legs, which according to the book she&#39;d gotten from Megumi female werecows didn&#39;t have. Their breasts were bigger than other weres and their nipples might be longer and more teat like than other weres, but they were a werecow&#39;s udders and that female werecows didn&#39;t have an additional set of mammary glands to the two on their chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably just my imagination getting the better of me,&quot; Melissa thought to herself as she went through breakfast, &quot;after all... this is a big decision and will affect me for the rest of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of the things she&#39;d dreamed about did seriously weigh heavily on her mind, though. The book Megumi gave her DID make mention that inter-species couples were easily tolerated in Moon Lake, though it did make mention that more often than not, were couples tended to be the same were species. Though, Melissa had assumed that related to the issues of hybridization in their offspring that was there. Regardless that weighed heavily on her mind, particularly as she was bonding quite well with Trevor who had been polite and helpful to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I probably should talk to him about this...&quot; Melissa thought to herself after breakfast and as her father drove her to school.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Melissa&#39;s classes went well, and she did see Trevor again, which made her smile, though during her classes things remained busy enough that she was never able to talk with him about her decision to be her family&#39;s were and what he thought about it. That left her only with the option with the study hall period.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we go to the library and talk about something?&quot; Melissa asked to him as they left their second period class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Trevor gave a shrug, though noticing her concern, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Melissa managed a small smile, &quot;Just some questions on things on my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do they relate to the mandatory were law?&quot; Trevor asked. Melissa&#39;s mouth hung open with surprise at his guess and he moved to explain, &quot;It&#39;s nothing to be ashamed or surprised over. Unless you&#39;re someone who&#39;s really into weres and being one, it&#39;s a decision that does take some time. I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions you have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Melissa answered.<br />
<br />
The two walked along and ultimately ran into the others as they made it to the library doors. Megumi and Alice trading knowing smiles as they looked to Trevor and Melissa, but didn&#39;t say anything. They all sat down in a quiet section of the library and waited for Melissa to speak. She wanted to blush with embarrassment when it looked her classmate Alice, Megumi, Jason, Rob, and Trevor all seemed to suspecting what she was concerned over.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what did you think of the book, did it help?&quot; Megumi asked when Melissa didn&#39;t speak right away.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way... it DOES have more information than the pamphlet that we got from the city,&quot; Melissa commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure the Harper/Jenkins wedding and all the stuff that City Hall is wrestling with is probably distracting them,&quot; Alice commented, &quot;don&#39;t they actually give out copies of the back to new residents? Not just some little pamphlet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They normally do have something a bit more substantial than a pamphlet,&quot; Rob commented, &quot;but even that is probably a bit out of date... You know, all the hand drawings or prints of weres in eighteen hundreds to early nineteen hundreds clothes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Jason chuckled, &quot;like the ARTWORK is the problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, guys,&quot; Trevor commented, trying to be a calming presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad it helped you,&quot; Megumi said to Melissa, &quot;do you have any ideas... or...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her voice trailed off at the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Melissa admitted, &quot;I mean... after meeting with you guys and being friends... I&#39;m fine with being the family were, but I&#39;m still a bit concerned on what were to be and that lead to a bit of a weird dream last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A weird dream?&quot; Jason asked, glancing to Trevor, who shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I was in front of a mirror talking to my reflection,&quot; Melissa explained, &quot;and my reflection showed me what I&#39;d look like as a were, though something looked odd.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa watched as the others traded glances.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t grow a third leg, did you?&quot; Alice teased after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... not a third leg,&quot; Melissa answered and looked to Trevor with a bit of a blush, &quot;I kinda asked what I&#39;d look like as a werecow...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, she likes you!&quot; Megumi clapped happily  and patted Trevor on the back.<br />
<br />
Melissa&#39;s cheeks turned bright red as she blushed, &quot;but I didn&#39;t look like what the book showed a female werecow looking like...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You turned into a bull?&quot; Trevor wondered, himself a bit embarrassed by Megumi&#39;s insinuation that he and Melissa were an item, which for the moment they weren&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... more like I had an actual udder between my legs like a mundane cow did,&quot; Melissa looked down at the desktop, &quot;even though the book said that werecows don&#39;t have udders... unless... unless you&#39;re calling their breasts &quot;udders...&quot;  Man this is embarrassing... Does that mean anything? Would I be some kind of mutant were? Malformed and ugly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... you&#39;d be beautiful,&quot; Trevor spoke trying to sound less &quot;interested&quot; in her than he truly was, &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of a female werecow having an udder outside of her two breasts... My mom doesn&#39;t have an udder separate from her breasts. Your breasts would surely grow if you became a werecow, but you wouldn&#39;t grow an udder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But did that dream mean anything?&quot; Melissa asked, noticing Trevor&#39;s red cheeks as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t think so,&quot; Trevor commented, &quot;the mind can play odd tricks at times... and werecattle aren&#39;t exactly the most common were species out there. Why the interest? Are you wanting to be a werecow?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor mentally kicked himself as that sounded far more hopeful than he wanted it to be. He knew some other werecows in the herd he belonged to that were his age and there were a couple female werehorses that had some interest in him. But in a strange way, ever since he&#39;d met Melissa in the hallway the day before, there just seemed to be something about her that made her a friend and potentially more than that.<br />
<br />
&quot;More that I was simply curious,&quot; Melissa said weakly, &quot;as I said... I&#39;m not really that close to making a decision...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... if you like, I can take you out to my family farm,&quot; Trevor said, &quot;after school. You can meet my mom and she can show you what a transformed female werecow looks like and that what you saw in your dream doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;d have an udder or would be malformed in anyway...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;d know...?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... she did take some psychology courses while in college... though not enough to be an actual therapist,&quot; Trevor commented, &quot;she did just enough to have basic idea and allow her to dabble in a bit of everything while she was in school. If you want to see a therapist... you&#39;d need to see Frances Twist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twist...&quot; Melissa said slowly, &quot;Samantha Twist&#39;s sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wife,&quot; Megumi corrected, &quot;they&#39;re both married werecats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s one I know I don&#39;t want to join,&quot; Melissa spoke, &quot;I have nothing against lesbians or anything like that... but the book said that I&#39;d become at least bisexual if I became a werecat...&quot; She paused to blush again and hoped the others didn&#39;t notice her glancing to Trevor. Trevor, thankfully didn&#39;t, though he also seemed to be staring down Megumi and Alice to keep them from giggling. &quot;And I&#39;d prefer to keep my interests focused on men...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing wrong with that,&quot; Rob commented, &quot;we men are quite handsome.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice and Megumi shook their heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you say you haven&#39;t made a decision, yet,&quot; Megumi commented, &quot;did you look at yourself in other were forms?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... including werefoxes, werewolves, weretigers, and weremers and others... mostly out of curiosity and imagining what I&#39;d look like,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;which didn&#39;t look too bad... but has only reinforced not having a decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well foxes are beautiful... wonderful in bed and dedicated to their mates,&quot; Megumi commented, &quot;and I could hook you up with a dog-fox who&#39;d be more than willing to transform you if you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll wait till I&#39;ve made an actual decision on what were to be,&quot; Melissa told her, &quot;but thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megumi nodded and then smirked to Alice, &quot;In the meantime, we can start planning yours and Trevor&#39;s wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice giggled while Trevor gave a groan and Melissa couldn&#39;t help but blush.</p>
