<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Please don&#39;t leave me like this.&quot; Heather pleaded. &quot;I&#39;ll do anything you want. Just, please, let me get dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything?&quot; Mel said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes. Anything.&quot; Heather didn&#39;t like the look in Mel&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; Mel gestured towards the changing table. &quot;Get dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather moved as quickly as she dared to the changing table and pulled open one of the drawers. As she looked into the drawer her mind blanked. It was just like the last time. She turned to Mel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.&quot; Mel said, grinning. &quot;Get dressed. Or do you prefer to stay like that all day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I can&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t... Get dressed. Not on my own. It must be part of the scenario. I think you have to help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel rolled her eyes. She gently pushed Heather aside and reached into the drawer she had opened. Out of it she pulled a bright pink onesie with ruffles on the butt. She eyed it for a moment, then turned to Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm.&quot; She said. &quot;Arms up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather obeyed without thinking. Mel pulled the onesie down over her head and snapped shut over her diaper. She turned back to the dresser and pulled open another drawer. This time she pulled out a pair of pink booties which she held out for Heather to slide her feet into before tying them on tight with the provided ribbons. Then she grabbed a pair of hair ties and pulled Heather&#39;s hair into pigtails before standing back to admire her work.<br />
<br />
&quot;There.&quot; She said. &quot;Cute as a button. I could just eat you up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather shivered at the look on Mel&#39;s face as she said that. Some of her fear must have shown on her face because Mel suddenly looked serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Mel asked. &quot;You look terrified.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... It&#39;s your face...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my face?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just now, it reminded me of the other you. The one from the other scenarios I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The sex maniac that masturbated you until you passed out and then got herself stuck on a sex machine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel looked thoughtful for a moment. Heather held her breath, wondering how her friend would react.<br />
<br />
&quot;She sounds like a lot of fun.&quot; Mel said, grinning wider than ever.<br />
<br />
Heather looked horrified. The FAQ had said that the Big Tots diapers couldn&#39;t make anyone do anything against their will. It looked like Mel was more than willing. Heather decided to end this now, before things got out of hand again. She reached for her wrist and grasped her totem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ah, ah!&quot; Mel said. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you. If you had read any of the information on the tandem play function you would know that the scenario can only be ended by both parties at once. Attempting to do it on your own will cause the scenario to bleed into reality until the other participant ends the scenario as well. Wouldn&#39;t it be just awful if everyone saw you dressed like that? Because you won&#39;t be able to change without my help. And I think I might just stay here and explore for a few days. Really see what this reality is all about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re bluffing!&quot; Heather said, panicking. &quot;There&#39;s no way it would work like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The website said it was a known bug they working on. Now, since I know you wouldn&#39;t want to be caught dead in that outfit in the real world I suggest you stay right here and play with me for a while, okay? We&#39;ll have all sorts of fun, I promise. And when we&#39;re done playing I&#39;ll even let you pick the next scenario. Does that sound good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You promise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cross my heart.&quot; Mel said sincerely, making an &#39;X&#39; shape across her chest with one finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Heather said. &quot;But you better not go back on your word, or I&#39;ll tell your mom about the time you shoplifted those earrings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never break a promise. Now let&#39;s get you changed so we can go have some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- Changed? But I just got-&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather&#39;s eyes widened in horror as Mel stepped forward and grabbed her diaper. She could feel it squish and noticed how warm it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;You turned incontinence back on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s part of the scenario.&quot; Mel said coolly. &quot;Besides, you&#39;re supposed to be just a big baby here and babies don&#39;t know when they wet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I hate that part!&quot; Heather whined. &quot;That&#39;s why I turned it off. I don&#39;t like losing control!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel picked her up as if she weighed nothing and deposited her on the changing table. Heather struggled a bit, but gave up when she realized that she hadn&#39;t turned off the weird strength feature and neither had Mel. In this world she was effectively as weak as a baby when going against anyone in authority.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to have to get used to it.&quot; Mel said, pushing her down onto her back and unsnapping her onesie. &quot;Besides, you&#39;re even cuter when you&#39;re all helpless like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather tried to cover her eyes, but her arms were no longer obeying her. She would be completely helpless until Mel had finished changing her. She was completely at her best friend&#39;s mercy. Mel untaped her diaper and let it fall open. She surveyed her helpless and exposed friend shivering on the table in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other me. You said she licked you clean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, No!&quot; Heather whispered hoarsely. &quot;Not again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel bent over until her face was less than an inch above Heather&#39;s clit and breathed out. Heather whined as she felt her hot breath. She closed her eyes tight and hoped that it would be over quickly this time. She gasped when she felt a cold baby wipe instead. Her eyes flew open and she glared at Mel.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Mel laughed. &quot;Did you actually want me to do it? Maybe next time. Though, I wonder...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel looked down at the toybox. Heather cursed herself for telling Mel what it had contained during her first scenario with the diapers. She prayed that it just contained regular baby toys this time, but she knew she would never be that lucky. Mel bent over out of Heather&#39;s sight and rummaged around for a bit. When she came back up she kept her hands low so that Heather would be unable to see what was in them. She fiddled with whatever it was she had retrieved for a moment, then grabbed Heather&#39;s ankles and hauled them into the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Mel, please! Don&#39;t!&quot; Heather cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hush.&quot; Mel said. &quot;You&#39;ll enjoy this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather felt something hard and cold press between her ass cheeks. She tried to clench to keep whatever it was out, but Mel had coated it in lube and it slid right past her meager defense. She felt it press against her asshole and whined again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax.&quot; Mel commanded. &quot;Or this will hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather tried to relax. She focused on her breathing and let herself go as loose as possible, but whatever Mel was pushing into her was much larger than she anticipated. Finally, when she thought she couldn&#39;t take it anymore and her asshole was going to tear, the toy was in and her pucker was clenching around it&#39;s narrow base.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl.&quot; Mel cooed. Now for your reward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel lowered Heather&#39;s legs back to the padded table top and then pushed her knees apart. Heather was too focused on the cold metal lump that was warming in her ass to care. She expected Mel to finish changing her now and was caught by surprise when she felt something pressing between her labia this time. She looked down to see Mel holding a rather large dildo. Mel grinned back and pushed the toy deeper. Heather gasped as she felt it slip into her cunt. As she slid the toy deeper, Mel bent over Heather until her mouth was right next to her friend&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know.&quot; she said, barely above a whisper. &quot;I&#39;ve been wanting to do this to you for a long time. You telling me about what the other me did to you convinced me to try. I admit, the diapers were a bit of a surprise, but for some reason they just make this even hotter. Knowing that you&#39;re under my control, completely dependent on me... I have never been so turned on in my life!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather tried to speak, but Mel pulled back a bit and kissed her full on the lips. As she did, she began pumping the the dildo in and out of the helpless girl. Heather began moaning. Mel increased her pace. Each thrust caused Heather to moan again which Mel muffled with her own mouth, slipping her tongue through Heather&#39;s parted lips. She increased her pace again. Heather&#39;s moans became squeals. Mel felt her friend begin to convulse beneath her and broke their kiss to gulp some much needed air.<br />
<br />
Heather just lay there, gasping. What this Mel, the real Mel, lacked in skill, she definitely made up for in enthusiasm. It didn&#39;t help that Heather was still very sensitive after her adventures over the past couple of days. She was just starting to catch her breath when she felt the dildo move again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; she said weakly.<br />
<br />
The dildo was pulled free. Heather sighed in relief, then let out a small cry as she felt something new being pushed into her. This toy was a bit smaller, but it was covered in short, blunt spines that dragged against her abused flesh as Mel inserted it. Once it was a deep as it could possibly go, Mel pulled the front of Heather&#39;s new diaper up and taped it into place.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go.&quot; Mel trilled as she fastened Heather&#39;s onesie back up. &quot;Now you&#39;re all ready for your big debut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My... What...?&quot; Heather gasped.<br />
<br />
Mel didn&#39;t answer. She just scooped Heather up and carried her out of the room and down the stairs. Heather struggled for a brief moment, then surrendered herself to the inevitable. She wondered what kind of world Au Pair-adise would create. Since Mel had picked it she feared the worst. As they reached the bottom of the stairs and turned the corner into the living room she heard a pair of gasps and looked up to see her mom and sister sitting on the sofa and staring at her with mouths agape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Presenting,&quot; Mel announced, &quot;Baby Heather!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s what the two of you were up to in there.&quot; Mandy breathed as she stood and approached the two teens. &quot;You had me worried that something was wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather squirmed under her mom&#39;s gaze as Mandy looked her up and down with a critical eye. She flinched as Mandy reached out and rubbed her diaper. Hillary was suddenly there as well, gaping openly at her older sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Mandy said reproachfully, &quot;You could have just told me that you wanted to be Little.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-&quot; Heather began, but Mel cut her off.<br />
<br />
&quot;We wanted it to be a surprise.&quot; Mel said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It certainly is.&quot; Mandy replied. &quot;Heather has never even given so much as a hint that she wanted to be Little. I don&#39;t think I ever saw any of the usual signs when she was growing up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes they&#39;re hard to see, and not every Little wants to be acknowledged as one. I only noticed because I just got my Au Pair license and have been trained to see them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you are the expert. I still wish you had told me though. I could have gotten everything prepared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need. I&#39;ve got everything covered. You can go upstairs and look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I certainly will. I do trust you to do things correctly, but as her mother I have an obligation to make sure my new Little&#39;s needs are being properly met.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather looked from Mel to her mother and back again. She couldn&#39;t follow any of this. Was this part of the scenario? Just what had Mel picked? She glanced over at Hillary. Her sister had retreated back to the couch and was sitting with her knees pulled up to her chin. She was staring directly at Heather, but not meeting her eyes. Her expression was blank, but it was also strained, as if she was desperately trying to mask her true emotions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will she be making her public debut today as well?&quot; Mandy asked.<br />
<br />
The question drew Heather&#39;s attention back. Public debut?<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Mel replied. &quot;Can&#39;t do these things halfway after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have a stroller for her? I don&#39;t think that carrying her the whole day is a good idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I brought one. I hid it in the hall closet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure enough, Mandy pulled open the closet door and there was a stroller inside. Sized for an adult. It was different from the stroller in the other scenario. That one had a deep seat that you could somewhat hide in. This one was one of those lightweight folding ones with a very open seat. Mel carefully strapped Heather into it and wheeled it towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a diaper bag?&quot; Mandy asked.<br />
<br />
Mel scooped up a bag from the corner behind the door and plopped it into the stroller&#39;s bottom basket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup! Don&#39;t worry Mrs. L. I have everything under control.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that she opened the door and pushed Heather out into the sunlight.</p>
