<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle got off the bus and walked into the building, his cock bobbing up and down, side to side as he walked through the halls, people glanced then when he caught them looking they quickly looked away. He got the distinct feeling that these looks were out of pity, rather than envy, and as he entered the classroom, he found that his desk in the back had been modified to have a wider seat, to accommodate for his wider sitting stance. He sat down and pulled out his books from his bag. Kyle somewhat managed to pay attention, the gnawing hunger a dull drumming in the back of his mind. <br />
<br />
He spent his day mildly distracted, hour after hour he felt the cock lurch forward, getting larger, by lunch the weight, already heavy was much more noticeable. By finale period his massive manhood now  kept it&#39;s tip in his field of view, even though it slouched down in front of him. On the bus he felt his cock lurch in his arms reaching 37 inches, it&#39;s head now even with his collar bone, he had overestimated it&#39;s size this morning, having shoved it toward himself in a daze, but now, he could kiss the tip and not even lean, his balls had seemingly stopped expanding, finishing off at the size of a basketball for each testicle. Getting off the bus was just as challenging as getting on, the width of his balls brushing against seats on both sides of the aisle.<br />
<br />
He got off the bus and went into his house. His mom was there, she greeted him much differently, asking him if he was okay, if he had any trouble with anyone at school, if he was able to make his way from class to class without too much effort. He was somewhat annoyed, but realized that the cock he now sported was much, much larger than anything seen before, and it was definitely considered a disability by now. He answered her questions, and she kindly reminded him that he could always do remote learning, that the option was always open for him. The idea crossed his mind once or twice during the day, his cock was still growing, and if he was right, it would be nearly four feet long by tomorrow morning when he was done.<br />
<br />
Kyle went to the shower, this time his cock&#39;s weight much more apparent, he felt his legs getting tired from moving around with it, but soldiered on, determined to live some sort of normal life, after cleaning himself he started on his cock, and saw it lurch in his hands, now 38 inches. He cussed under his breath, swearing he&#39;d get revenge on Jen, then remembering that he couldn&#39;t use the curse on anyone in the cheer squad again, he&#39;d figure this out eventually. He spent the evening distracted, it passed in a haze, he barely noticed the hourly growths of his manhood, and he finally, tiredly lay down in bed.<br />
<br />
That night was another fitful night of sleep, being interrupted by random and constant arousal by the growth spurts of his cock. Kyle woke up around a quarter to six, he felt the immense size of his cock, and his arms wrapped around it, he didn&#39;t open his eyes, the sun was rising, and he knew it was almost six, the final spurt would happened any minute and he could finally try and relax. The spurt made his cock harden, going rock hard he groaned, damn his luck, of course it would go this hard at the end. After an hour he finally opened his eyes, then his eyes went wide and he gasped, there filling his vision, only and inch from his face, was a wall of cock flesh, he tilted his head up and found that, at full mast, his cock head was a full foot above his head. <br />
<br />
“Fuck.” He gasped, he threw off the sheets and in the act lay on his back, a mistake he realized shortly afterwards as the cock bumped against not only his face, but the headboard of his bed, “How fucking big is this thing?” He pushed his cock up with both hands and stared at it, from his view, his cock was now the full height of another person riding him cowgirl style. He bolted out of bed, another mistake as his massive cock slammed into the dresser next to his be, and his massive balls pulled him to the floor. <br />
<br />
“Shit!” He yelped, as he collapsed on the colossal cock. He managed to get up a few minutes later, after getting over the pain of slamming his dick against the dresser, he stood up and felt the titanic weight of his cock, looking down at it, it&#39;s rock hard state touched the head of his cock against the floor, feeling the carpet against it sent a shiver up his spine. Kyle waddled over to the mirror on the back of his door and stared, amazed at the size of his manhood, he quickly grabbed a tape measure and got to work.<br />
<br />
“Fifty two inches.” He whimpered as he measured it&#39;s length, “And two feet thick.... Damn.” Kyle kept staring, it throbbed with excitement, wanting attention. “I&#39;m sorry buddy,” he touched his cock, “We can&#39;t cum until midnight.” He lifted his cock up, leaning it against himself, it&#39;s tip nearly touching the ceiling, he looked down at his balls and gulped. Two massive testicles sat in his sack, each one nearly sixteen inches wide, the size of a small beach ball, but unlike normal balls, these made his sack much more taught, they reminded him of breast implants, so firm, yet seeming so fake. He also became aware of the musk that he was putting off, the pubic hair of his colossal package like a jungle.<br />
<br />
“Well, I&#39;m stuck with you now, let&#39;s take care of this.” Kyle muttered, and proceeded to let down his cock gently, shuffling around as to not crack into any furniture, grabbing a pair of boxers, which featured a massive gap in the front, and a button to keep them on. He made his way down the hall to the bathroom dragging his cock backwards, shivering with a little excitement as it was caressed by the carpet, and finally entering the bathroom, he started a new ritual to his morning. He would come to find out that even though his package was massive, it only gave off the normal amount of hormones that his original size would have, and since he was, unknown to him, finished growing, he would always be 5&#39;4” with his now 4&#39; 4” cock. He started by finding a way to piss, placing his cock into the shower, he let loose and found that he wouldn&#39;t have any problems urinating with this gargantuan beast, after taking care of that, he lifted his cock against him, and grabbed his trimmer, setting to work.<br />
<br />
Kyle didn&#39;t like pubic hair, it made nasty odors and chaffed too much, so he spent the next hour trimming the jungle of pubic hair his cock now had, making it as smooth as possible, filing the small trash can with clippings that reminded him of a hair cut. “There, better?” He caressed the balls, and got another hard on. “Damn it Kyle, don&#39;t do that, you can&#39;t solve that problem until tonight.” Kyle proceeded to take a shower, cleaning himself, and his cock thoroughly, feeling better he dried himself off, and went back to his bedroom. When he entered he found the room had changed while he was gone, it upset him a little, but he found that all of his stuff was still here, his computer chair had been modified, made of much stronger material, and under his desk was what appeared to be a massive onahole, mounted on a metal bracket, and connected to what only could be described as a vacuum pump with a four gallon tank. Kyle was surprised, not by the machine, but by the tank, it was branded with a local fertilizer company. <br />
<br />
“Well that makes sense, where else would my cum go.” He muttered, he then noticed that the computer had also changed, it went from a cheap office desktop, to a top of the line gaming machine. “Nice, I wonder....” Then it hit him. “We&#39;re selling my cum.... I&#39;m milking myself and selling my cum. I&#39;m being milked like a stallion.” The revelation hit him with slight disgust, but incredible arousal. Memories flooded in, his cock was always large, it continued to expand as time went on, the doctors at first were concerned by it&#39;s alarming rate of growth, but finding that somehow his body compensated for it&#39;s size said there was nothing they could do, it wasn&#39;t like there was a penis reduction surgery that could fix something this massive. So Kyle did remote learning, he was still friends with his friends from school, and with his seed being so high in production, his mother, a single parent after his father had vanished one day, decided to see if she could sell it, the medical bills for Kyle exams were killing them. She had tried to get the sperm bank to agree to buying, but the production was so high he would have flooded them, but she did manage to get a local bio disposal company, Smith Farming Supplies, to agree to pay for the highly potent and nutrient rich cum. Smith would take his cum, and use it in a fertilizer formula, making the richest fertilizer on the market.<br />
<br />
The irony of this revelation wasn&#39;t lost on Kyle, Smith Farming Supplies was owned by Jen&#39;s dad, so in a way, her family was still paying for the curse she put on him. Kyle put on the rest of his clothes, his cock finally calming down, softening and lifting it&#39;s heft off the floor, he found that soft, his cock was somewhere between 39 and 40 inches, which made it somewhat manageable, but still alarmingly heavy. Kyle decided that later, he would start doing some exercises to work his legs and lower back, the tension on his muscles was amazing, if not painful.<br />
<br />
Kyle made his way out to the living room, the house had changed a lot more than he expected, the furniture was finer, and the electronics a lot nicer. He went to the kitchen and read the note on the fridge. <br />
<br />
“Kyle, went out to lunch and shopping with Aunt Kelly, be back this afternoon, make sure not to make a mess in the house, you know what I mean ;). Love Mom.”<br />
<br />
“Huh... Well it&#39;s not like I can cum until tonight anyway.” He crumple the note and got something to eat.</p>
