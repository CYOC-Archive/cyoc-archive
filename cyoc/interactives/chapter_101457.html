“Spencer would you PLEASE hold still.” Maggie Lawson said as she tried to get her daughter to let the hospital technician x-ray her arm. It was difficult enough since she had to stay in her were form, and most of her body was hanging off the examining table. But the fact that Spencer kept squirming didn’t make it any easier. <br />
<br />
The hospital was the last place she wanted to be. She was annoyed she couldn’t finish what she started with Jeremy, and that Eric had foolishly run after her. She’d never felt so guilty about anything in her life. <br />
<br />
“Spencer this will only take a second, but you have to STAY STILL.” Maggie said again. Both she and the attending doctor had a general idea of the damage done to Spencer’s arm. They guessed Jeremy had snapped both Spencer’s radius and ulna. But the severity of the fractures had yet to be determined, and would remain a mystery until Spencer stopped her impatient moving. <br />
<br />
Evan tried to hold her down, but that was hard to do given that he changed back to his normal form, and he couldn’t hold her without accidentally touching her broken arm. <br />
<br />
“Spencer Riley Lawson if you don’t stop fidgeting I’m just going to let your arm get infected and fall off.” Maggie finally snapped. <br />
<br />
That did the trick, and Spencer laid back against the table. Her tail still flicked annoyed on the edge of the table. Her mother sighed, and took a step back so the technicians could do their job. <br />
<br />
Outside the x-ray room, Elle, Evan and Jonathan were sitting and waiting for any news. Evan was a nervous wreck, worrying about Spencer, and about that Anderson boy. He wasn’t sure why the kid did what he did, but Evan had to commend him on his bravery. <br />
<br />
“Where did that police officer go?” Evan asked, noticing that the weredog who escorted the others to the hospital had left.<br />
<br />
“He’s gone down to the desk to warn the staff about the feds.” Jonathan said grimly. <br />
<br />
That was another headache in the making. Evan didn’t want to, but if it came to it, he was ready to throw those damn agents out a window if they insisted on seeing Spencer. As it was, they were already furious they couldn’t see Jeremy. <br />
<br />
The hospital lied and said he was still in surgery, and he wouldn’t be allowed to have visitors until tomorrow. It was all to buy some time so the Moon Lake police and Martin Stovall could come up with a plausible explanation for both Jeremy and Spencer’s injuries. <br />
<br />
After what seemed like an eternity, Maggie and her colleague (and former high school classmate), Garrett Henderson finally emerged from the room, Evan was on his feet and asking questions as soon as he hear the door open.<br />
<br />
“Calm down Evan,” Maggie said. <br />
<br />
“”How’s Spencer?” Elle asked, while Evan is getting himself back under control. <br />
<br />
“The good news, since she’s a were some of the injuries have already healed themselves. The bad news, they won’t be able to do much about the broken bones. Not unless there’s some kind of miracle.” Garrett said. Rather than try to explain, he motioned for the others to follow him. They went into the room next door, where Garrett put up the x-rays they just took. <br />
<br />
“As you can see, Bower did a number of her arm. The first bite he broke the skin, and barely pierced the compact bone. He didn’t bite down fast, he slowly applied pressure, which caused the ulna to crack and then splinter. And eventually, once Bower had bitten through that, he cracked the radius.” Garrett said, pointing to the x-ray with a pen. <br />
<br />
Being a Navy SEAL, Evan had seen much worse. But knowing this was his daughter’s body they were talking about, it made him twice as sick feeling. The only thing that kept him from searching the hospital and finishing what Spencer started was the fact that the place was brimming with police and US Marshals. <br />
<br />
“What are you going to do?” Jonathan asked. <br />
<br />
“Uh, well treatment is going to be kinda tricky. The simple fracture of her radius will be easy to treat.  The ulnar fracture is what concerns me the most, since it’s the most fragile. Shifting poses the risk of further damage, and if the cracks spread there could be more permanent damage. The best thing to do would be to apply stabilizers, in this case a metal plate, and allow the bone to heal.” Garrett explained. <br />
<br />
“I’m not really following you Doc. What’s the problem?” Evan asked. His wife was the medical expert, not him. He was the shoot first ask questions later kinda guy. Not the one who stitched up the people after the shooting. <br />
<br />
“Spencer either has to change back, and run the risk of furthering the fractures, or stay in her were form for the duration of treatment.” Maggie said. <br />
<br />
“You’re kidding right? How the hell will that work? She’ll be stuck here for, what, months?!” Evan exclaimed. Spencer hated it when he put her on house arrest for a day. Being trapped in the hospital for weeks on end, that would drive her beyond insane. <br />
<br />
“It’s up to Spencer. And I can treat her at home, if it comes to that.” Maggie said. <br />
<br />
“Have you told her yet?” Elle asked. <br />
<br />
“I suspect she can hear us now.” Garrett said, pointing to the wall behind Evan, Elle and Jonathan. There was a confirming knock from the other side, letting them know Spencer did in fact hear their conversation. <br />
<br />
“I’ll give her a day to think it over. But after that I’ll need to operate, or the injury may get worse.” Garrett said before bowing out. <br />
<br />
They move Spencer into a more comfortable room. Careful to avoid any places on of the feds may be lurking. Though they probably wouldn’t believe their eyes if they saw the almost eight foot tall were walking around in a hospital gown. <br />
<br />
“How are you…”<br />
<br />
“Would you please stop asking me how I’m feeling, because I’m feeling pretty lousy right now.” Spencer said, cutting her mother off. Her arm was in a sling, there was still dried blood in her fur, and she had quite the migraine. <br />
<br />
“Sorry. Do you need anything?” Maggie asked. <br />
<br />
“A time-machine?”<br />
<br />
“How about something more realistic?” Evan said, <br />
<br />
“Can’t take a joke? Come on, just trying to lighten the mood. Pardon me if I CRACK a bad one.” Spencer said with her signature grin. Evan sighed, his daughter’s comedic timing never ceasing to amaze him. <br />
<br />
Beside him, Maggie’s cell phone started to ring and she excused herself into the hall to take the call. As she left Spencer and Evan started one of their back and forths about Spencer’s dry sense of humor. <br />
<br />
“At least things are getting back to normal,” she thought before she answered the phone. <br />
<br />
“Hello?”<br />
<br />
“Maggie? It’s Samantha, I hope I haven’t caught you at a bad time. How is everyone? I got the CliffNotes version from one of the officers at the station.”<br />
<br />
“Beaten up, but alive thank god.” Maggie said, almost laughing. Her emotions were finally catching up to her. The second she stepped foot into the hospital, she’d gone into full “doctor” mode. She half ran to the emergency room, and nearly shoved the nurses out of the way so she could examine Spencer herself. <br />
<br />
“Good to hear. How’s Spencer?”<br />
<br />
“She’s got a pretty serious fracture. Jeremy broke her right forearm, actually shattered would be a better description.”<br />
<br />
“Oh god.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not really as bad as it sounds.The only problem is that she’s still transformed, and if she changes back she’ll probably break her arm even more.”<br />
<br />
“So she’s stuck in her were form? For how long?” Samantha asked. She knew the others were listening to her conversation. There was a loud sucking noise when they heard the noise, as well as a chorus of “What’s wrong, what happened?” from Eric Anderson (who couldn’t hear as well as the rest of them could). <br />
<br />
“Depends. Garrett, you remember him he went to school with us, he’s the doctor treating her. He explained some of the options in more detail to me. And though Spencer COULD change back and be treated then, the risks outweigh the benefits.” Maggie said. <br />
<br />
“Would it be too much to ask if some of us could come over to see her?” Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
“Us?”<br />
<br />
“We’re eating dinner with the Andersons. And I think Eric in particular would like to come over.” Samantha said, glancing at Eric. He nodded his head, and muttered a thank you. <br />
<br />
“You’re more than welcome to. But be careful, there’s a horde of police and feds outside in the parking lot.”<br />
<br />
“Why?”<br />
<br />
“They want to see Jeremy, and the hospital staff won’t let them.” Maggie said. Samantha didn’t need to ask any further questions on that subject. She fully understood what was going on. <br />
<br />
“Is there an alternate access point?” she asked instead. <br />
<br />
“An emergency exit that runs up the back of the building, but… oh! Just text me when you get here. I’ll let you in.” Maggie said quickly, realizing what Samantha was suggesting. <br />
<br />
“Alright. We’ll be over in thirty minutes.” Samantha and Maggie said their goodbyes before resuming their previous tasks. Maggie went back into Spencer’s room, and found her, Evan, Elle and Jonathan all laughing around Spencer’s bed. In spite of everything that had happened today, Maggie was glad to see everyone carrying on like normal.</p>
