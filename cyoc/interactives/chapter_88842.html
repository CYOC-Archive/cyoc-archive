<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We should remove all his body hair!&quot; chimed in one of the students.<br />
<br />
&quot;An excellent suggestion. Body hair has long been thought of as a symbol of masculinity and maturity.&quot;<br />
<br />
And at that, the cop&#39;s body hair began to dissolve into nothing, leaving his body completely hairless. His chest, his arms, his legs, were all bare and smooth now. He desperately clung his hands to his crotch, hoping somehow that so long as he kept them covered, the spell wouldn&#39;t affect his pubic hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now now, we mustn&#39;t keep obscure the view from my students.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! You can&#39;t make me do this! This is indecent exposure!&quot; And because he was still under the effects of the truth spell, he added quietly, &quot;And...I&#39;m embarrassed to have them see my penis&quot; But despite his protests, his hands slowly moved behind his back, and stayed there, as if they were held by invisible handcuffs. He looked down, and to his horror, all his pubic hair was gone, leaving his hairless cock and balls exposed to the classroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel being so hairless?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...don&#39;t like it. I know other guys don&#39;t have much body hair, but mine made me feel more manly than them. And...my crotch makes me feel like a little boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent. And how does it feel knowing that all these students are getting a full glimpse of your manhood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like it, but at least my penis is pretty large so I don&#39;t feel judged.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is quite sizable. How big is it erect?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eight inches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s quite impressive. How about we give the class a demonstration of your erect penis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Don&#39;t! If anybody walks in here I&#39;ll look like some kind of pervert!&quot; But despite the cop&#39;s protests, he felt the familiar rush of blood to his cock as it sprang to life for all to see. His face turned a whole new shade of red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad, is it class?&quot; They nodded and murmured in agreement. &quot;But the point of this demonstration is to put this man in his place, not be impressed. So let us shrink his manhood once more, this time, literally.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cop looked down at his erect penis, and to his horror, it began to shrink rapidly. It wasn&#39;t just going flaccid either, he was maintaining an erection the entire time. And to make matters worse, his testicles were shrinking in direct proportion.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Six inches. &quot;No please no!&quot; Four inches. His eyes grew wide with panic. &quot;Make it stop, please make it stop!&quot; Two inches. Tears were coming down his cheeks. &quot;Ple-ease!&quot; He begged as his penis settled on being one inch, fully erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see, class, well-endowed men tend to tie their masculinity and value by the length of their penis. And taking that away can quickly demoralize their self-worth. Tell the class how you feel about having a one inch penis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels awful. I can never undress at a gym locker room ever again. The guys will mock me. Women will laugh at me. I don&#39;t even know how to masturbate with this tiny thing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent! Now, how can we bring further humiliation to this muggle, class?&quot;<br />
<br />
The students pondered for a moment, examining the broken down cop, and wondering what else could be done. Soon, a young man in the back rose his hand and called out, &quot;Take away his muscles!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good choice!&quot; And at that, the cops muscle tone deflated until he was thin and scrawny.<br />
<br />
Another student rose her hand, &quot;And make him go bald!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent!&quot; the professor beamed proudly at his students as the man&#39;s head of dark, curly hair vanished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make him fat!&quot; called one student.<br />
&quot;No, make him old next!&quot; said another.<br />
&quot;Cover him in warts! cried out yet another.<br />
<br />
The man cringed, preparing himself for the worst. This had to be a nightmare. It had to be. There was no way all of this could be happening to him. All he could do was close his eyes and wish for this to end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now students, these are all excellent suggestions. However, there is more to this lesson than I&#39;ve initially let on. Now, look at this muggle and tell me what he resembles to you. His hairlessness, his scrawny muscles, his tiny cock, and broken ego...what creature does he most resemble to you now?&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, the students pondered greatly. The muggle did, in fact look familiar. Many of them felt like they had the answer just at the tip of their tongues. But something was just a little bit off at the same time. And then, one cried out from the back, &quot;He looks like a big elf!&quot;<br />
<br />
The class went into an instant uproar while the professor simply smirked. &quot;That is correct. Today, you are all learning on how an elf is made. You must break their spirits and then you can shackle them into servitude. Now that his spirit is properly broken, we can wipe away his memory of being a muggle, while leaving his humiliation in tact.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what! No! You can&#39;t! I have a life! I have a name! I&#39;m ! I&#39;m...I&#39;m...I...&quot; A look of confusion came across his face, as the man looked completely lost now.<br />
<br />
The professor continued on with his lecture, &quot;The final step is to physically reduce his size, this is done after the memories are wiped, as the pure humiliation will twist and deform his dimensions into that of a common elf.&quot;<br />
<br />
The students gasped, and watched with wonder as the muggle shrank down in size, while at the same time, his ears and nose grew long and pointed. His arms were disproportionate to his legs, leaving him with large hands that almost touched the floor. His skin became wrinkled, like an old man&#39;s. But most notably, his eyes stayed the same size, leaving them wide and pitiful.<br />
<br />
The five other men looked down in horror at the wrinkly, pathetic, and hideous elf standing in front of them while the class simply cheered. The professor pulled a pillowcase out from his desk, and tossed it in front of the former man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now get to work, elf!&quot;</p>
