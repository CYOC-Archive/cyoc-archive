<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Do you promise you won’t be weirded out?” Ryan asked sheepishly.<br />
<br />
“Why?” asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
“Promise.” <br />
<br />
“Fine.” Jeremy rolled his eyes. “What did you come up with?”<br />
<br />
Ryan was sweating. He’d never been so open about his fantasies with Jeremy before. Now that they were twins, he felt more open to sharing this part of himself with Jeremy. But what would he think? <br />
<br />
“I... I want to become your shoe,” Ryan stammered. “It’s something I think would be really cool.”<br />
<br />
And fucking hot, he thought, but he kept that part to himself.<br />
<br />
“Ok.” Jeremy surprised Ryan. “This is weird, but I imagine we’re going to be doing some pretty weird stuff.”<br />
<br />
“Can I ask a favor?” Ryan asked. “I want you to be wearing me as I change.”<br />
<br />
“How?” Jeremy asked.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, but I want to try to see if I can control how it happens.” Ryan replied. “You know, to see if I can do it.”<br />
<br />
“Uh-huh.” Jeremy nodded his head, a patronizing but slightly interested look on his face. He grinned. “That’s all it’s for?”<br />
<br />
“Mostly.” Ryan sheepishly replied.<br />
<br />
Jeremy ran his hand through his hair. “Well, let’s try this out then.” <br />
<br />
The two boys walked downstairs to the back hall, where they found Jeremy’s workout shoes. Ryan selected one.<br />
<br />
“Those ones?” Jeremy asked, surprised and turned on. “My sweaty workout runners? You wouldn’t like to become a Converse or something?” <br />
<br />
Ryan held the shoe in his hand. It smelled like Jeremy’s sweat. He glanced back upwards at Jeremy, a devislish look on his face. <br />
<br />
“This one.”<br />
<br />
The boys went back upstairs. They undressed, Ryan staring at Jeremy’s feet as he took his socks off.<br />
<br />
“You ready?” Jeremy asked, naked and sitting on his bed, his left foot outstretched.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Ryan said. He picked up the shoe and concentrated, feeling the familiar tingle in his hand. The tingle became a warmth, spreading throughout his entire body. His muscles felt electric.<br />
<br />
“Here we go.” Ryan said. He had started to sweat, but it was different than his own smell. It was Jeremy’s.<br />
<br />
In a state of sexual euphoria, Ryan bent down on his hands and knees, then crouched as low to the ground as he can. He was crouching too well. His torso was slightly stretching on either side, his arms and legs compressing slightly to allow for his growing mid-section. His pectorals and chest made contact with the floor, making him look incredibly flexible. His penis, rock hard, made contact with the floor next. When it touched the ground, it sent a shockwave of pleasure throughout Ryan. His jaw touched the ground next, and as it did his penis began to slowly shrink inwards. His balls pulled into his crotch, leaving a small bump where his testicles and shaft once had been. Ryan groaned as his neck began to morph, pulling his head closer to his shoulders. As this happened, his fingers and toes began to run together, merging and reducing into his feet and hands, which along with his arms and legs were beginning to merge with his midsection.<br />
<br />
Ryan was grinning. He would soon be nothing but Jeremy’s left running shoe, encasing his sexy foot. Jeremy’s sweat would soak into Ryan, and he would be his property. <br />
<br />
“I see how this is happening.” Jeremy said, staring at Ryan’s changing body, with his rear outstretched slightly towards Jeremy’s foot. “I’m afraid you’ve just outed yourself, Ryan.” He said with a smirk. Ryan would have replied, but his vocal chords had already melted into his insides, which were in the process of changing into synthetic material.<br />
<br />
Ryan’s ass was now stretched higher than the rest of his body. His butt cheeks slowly started to stretch away from each other, dividing and becoming more pronounced as the top of the shoe. Jeremy placed his big toe on Ryan’s asshole, which was still human in appearance. He ran his toe across Ryan’s hole, sending shockwaves through Ryan. All of a sudden, the smell of Jeremy’s sweat emanating from Ryan became much more pungeant. Jeremy inhaled deeply. He started to push his foot forward. First his big toe went in, then his second, then his third, fourth, fifth. Ryan’s asshole stretched and flexed, accommodating it’s intruders happily. This was the best fucking Ryan had ever had. Jeremy pushed deeper, hitting Ryan’s spot, sending the pleasure of climax throughout Ryan’s increasingly changing body. His chest, now sunk completely to the ground, began to harden as treads formed themselves out of his abdominal muscles and pecs. His arms and legs had disappeared. His head was now attached directly to his shoulders, and now Ryan could feel his cheeks stretching outwards on either side. His face was elongating to match his shoulders. Jeremy&#39;s foot, emanating the delicious smell and salty taste of his sweat, pushed even deeper, as Ryan’s body morphed to accommodate. Deeper and deeper it went, sending more and more pleasure and triggering more and more changes in Ryan. His eyes were closed in euphoria, and he didn’t even notice that he was shrinking.<br />
<br />
Jeremy’s foot was now deep into the changing mass that was Ryan, and the edges of Ryan’s former asshole, now located at Jeremy’s ankles, began to take on a grey color, morphing from a fleshy mass into synthetic cotton. The cotton began to slowly make its way down towards the front of the Ryan shoe, and Ryan’s tread-covered chest and his jaw were now hardening into rubber. He was hollowing out now, as more and more space was needed to accommodate Jeremy’s massive, sexy foot.<br />
<br />
Deeper and deeper Jeremy’s foot went, and Ryan could feel the sweaty stinky delicious toes getting closer and closer to what was now looking less like his head and more like the front of the shoe. To his surprise, Ryan found that he could taste Jeremy’s foot like his entire body was his mouth. The salty taste was like heaven to him. He hoped Jeremy didn’t put on socks when he used him. Jeremy was starting to jerk off, the thought of wearing Ryan as a shoe to hot for him to resist.<br />
<br />
Ryan’s body was sliding more and more up Jeremy’s foot as it got deeper, now almost at the end. Ryan’s now tiny nose shrunk into the top of the rubber sole, and Ryan’s mouth gasped one last time, revealing the sweaty foot inside, before it too sealed itself up. Jeremy flexed his foot inside Ryan’s body, causing another shockwave of pleasure, this one triggering small holes to appear in the cotton of the upper portion of the shoe. It was almost done, just one more change...<br />
<br />
Now, Jeremy looked down, seeing the almost perfect double of his grey left runner on his foot. It clung to him like no shoe ever had before, slowly moving in and out like breathing, rubbing and massaging his feet. Jeremy groaned as he jerked off, and as he watched, Ryan’s penis reappeared from between the top of the shoe and the top part of his foot. The penis was initially exactly like Ryan’s human one. It was hard, and Jeremy reached down to touch it. He gently massaged it, pulling gently as the skin as he masturbated it. Suddenly, the penis stretched from side to side and thickened, changing shape as it became the tounge of the shoe.<br />
<br />
It was done. Ryan had become a perfect duplicate of Jeremy’s left running shoe. Jeremy was about to come. He jerked his penis faster and harder. He could still feel the shoe stretching and massaging slightly, and he knew Ryan was enjoying this even more than he was... as hard as that was to imagine. The last thought Jeremy had before he threw his back backwards in pleasure and came on the bed, was that when Ryan decided to change back, he had to try becoming his shoe. As he laid on the bed, he realized he could still smell his masculine scent coming from the shoe. It was an intoxicating musk, and it got Jeremy hot and bothered all over again. <br />
<br />
“I better go for a run,” he said out loud, so he could be sure Ryan heard it, if he could still hear. The shoe gave a warm tug, and the tounge began to rub itself on the top of his foot. It seems Ryan had heard him, somehow.</p>
