<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing at the bow of the &#39;Absolute&#39;, Vect looked down at the wall of clouds below him. The early glow of sunrise painted the clouds with an array of reds and oranges that was nearing the ship as it descended.  As the hull began to sink into the clouds, Duinir spoke up with Faral and Edran in tow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering where you were when I didn&#39;t find you in your room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t sleep, came up here to think,&quot; Vect didn&#39;t break his stare forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excited to see your father and brother again,&quot; Duinir asked, purposefully avoiding the word &#39;family&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;More anxious that excited. I haven&#39;t seen father or Taegan for six years.&quot; The ship had submerged completely into the cloud cover by this point, looking more like a thick fog.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sure they will be eager to see you again,&quot; Faral tried to reassure Vect.<br />
<br />
&quot;To see me? Or to use me? I have not forgotten what you said, Duinir. You have yet to tell me who it is I am meant to wed,&quot; Vect glanced at the aging elf, his voice full of vitriol.<br />
<br />
Duinir recoiled slightly at the young elf&#39;s tone, but he couldn&#39;t blame the boy for his frustration. &quot;Lord Correllion did not tell me who your future bride was, only that we needed to bring you home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vect sighed. &quot;I can&#39;t just abandon my friends, we made a promise to each other to become adventurers. I had thought that when father sent me away he had relieved me of my duty, and so I began to plan my own life.&quot; Vect turned to face the trio. &quot;But now I&#39;m expected to abandon all of that on a whim.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before anyone could respond, the clouds began to thin and the city below the ship came into view. Vect looked over the railing and his confusion overcame his frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we? This isn&#39;t Ferunis,&quot; Vect&#39;s eyes surveyed the land below them. <br />
<br />
Instead of the vast fields of crops and the busy port by the Shimmer Sea, Vect saw a sprawling city located at the base of a trio of mountains. Running through the center of the city was a wide river full of ships going about their business. As they continued their descent another skyship sailed past them away from the city, it&#39;s size dwarfing the &#39;Absolute&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot has changed since you left Vect. This is Alari Edhiln, Forge Crown as the humans call it,&quot; Edran explained proudly. &quot;This is where many of the greatest works ever created by elven hands. And not those...tools the dwarves hammer out. We actually make art.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vect ignored Edran&#39;s pontificating and continued to stare at the ground below. &quot;Why are we here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is High Lord Corellion&#39;s seat of power since his elevation to his current station.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? When,&quot; Vect whirled around in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;The previous high lord, Tallion, tried to lead a rebellion and usurp the emperor. Your father led the attack that ended the uprising before it got out of hand and as reward for his loyalty, he was given Tallion&#39;s former holdings and titles. This was three years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to interrupt my good sirs,&quot; the captain spoke up suddenly, &quot;but we are about to make dock and you should all prepare yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you captain, and thank you for your service.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure,&quot; the captain gave a bow and left to finalize their arrival. <br />
<br />
&quot;All your questions will be answered at the palace down there,&quot; he pointed down to the elevated fortress near the center of the city on the western side of the river.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Faral led Vect on a short tour through some of the city while Duinir and Edran decided to go ahead to the palace and submit a report on the incident at the human capital, Lastan. The city was laid out in an orderly grid pattern, as though it&#39;s size and development was planned perfectly from the first day a cornerstone was placed. Homes were kept separate from shops, unlike in Lastan where the two were intermingled. The only locations that deviated from the orderly streets were the areas along the river, the select few elevated skyship docks, and the location Faral had led Vect by on her tour.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and to left is our primary forge,&quot; Faral explained as they passed an expansive looking structure that had smoke billowing out of the multiple chimneys. From the open doors Vect heard the sounds of clanging hammers and chuffing of forge billows. It reminded him of Ebron&#39;s humble forge back at Frost Watch (formally known as BTC). All the nearby shops and homes kept well away from the large workshop, causing the roads to be several times wider than anywhere else Vect had seen in the city. <br />
<br />
&#39;Perhaps I&#39;ll pay them a visit and examine their techniques. It would be interesting to see how they differ in their methods,&#39; Vect contemplated.<br />
<br />
&quot;The master smith is Myrinn Elestor should you have any commissions that you desire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think he would let me work some if I asked,&quot; Vect asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
Faral hesitated before answering. &quot;I don&#39;t think he would mind, but... perhaps the people shouldn&#39;t see one of their lord&#39;s sons working like a commoner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I suppose I&#39;ll just make sure no one sees me,&quot; Vect grinned smugly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vect, I&#39;m serious,&quot; Faral stepped in front of him, &quot;the situation is still tense here, there may very well be loyalists to Tallion lurking in the city. And there are plenty of people that would look for any chance to, at the very least, discredit your father. I cannot stop you from doing as you wish, but so long as you&#39;re here please try to follow some courtly procedure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vect began to protest before he considered her position. &#39;This isn&#39;t the academy, I&#39;m back to the old schedule and mannerisms from before,&#39; he reminded himself. &quot;I understand.&quot; Faral seemed to relax, almost like she was expecting to have to argue with him on the subject. &quot;But... perhaps we could schedule an... inspection of the workshop. To make certain they are fulfilling their duties to the best of their abilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise not to pick up any tools?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even a wayward nail on the ground,&quot; Vect offered his hand.<br />
<br />
Faral smiled and shook her head before shaking Vect&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see if I can work out a deal for you to meet with Master Elestor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Faral. If I am not allowed to work, hopefully I can ask him to repair my weapon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s probably not going to like the idea of working on a dwarven made sword.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t tell him if you don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
The pair arrived at the palace grounds about an hour later, the guards opening the outer gate with a respectful bow as they passed. The palace was situated atop a hill that overlooked the city, Vect suspected it wasn&#39;t a natural formation and wondered if it was made by magic or raw labor. In addition to it&#39;s elevated position the palace was surrounded by high walls that added to the steep hillsides for defense. Arrow slits, oil spouts, cannon mounts; the fortifications had every defense Vect had heard of. What struck Vect as odd was that the guards seemed very alert; maintaining security was understandable, but this was different. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on Faral? There are guards on the walls every few feet and is that a mage preparing spells over there,&quot; Vect pointed to the robed figure pouring over a book in the shadow of the ramparts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure, maybe it has to do with those people over there,&quot; Faral indicated the two fully clothed figures that seemed to be in a heated argument. The pair were covered head to foot in grey cloaks with a section of fabric pulled up to cover their faces, leaving a very small gap for their eyes to see through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we&#39;ll get some answers inside-.&quot;<br />
<br />
 The area outside the actual palace was a well kept garden with multiple fruit bearing trees lining the pathways. Vect noticed the branches of one tree shaking slightly. Moving a little closer, Vect heard the sound of wood breaking followed by a yelp of surprise as someone began to fall out of the tree. Out of reflex Vect reached out to catch the distressed individual. The grey robed figure landed in his arms and nearly knocked him over. <br />
<br />
The grey robed figure stared at the bewildered elf holding it for a moment before it finally spoke in a voice that was clearly unfamiliar with the high elf language. &quot;Thank you for catching me. I&#39;m not familiar with these things,&quot; the figure spoke in a pleasant female voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean trees?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that might be the right word. Can you put me down,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Vect complied and gently placed her on the ground. Standing next to the figure Vect discovered that the grey robed stranger only stood about chest high to him, forcing the stranger to look up to him as she spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;What were you doing up there,&quot; Vect asked, and got his answer as an apple fell from the tree next to him. He picked it up and offered it to the stranger with a raised eyebrow. &quot;Was this what you wanted?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...I was told they taste best fresh from the...tree,&quot; she explained and took the fruit.<br />
<br />
Vect smiled and shook his head. &quot;Yes, I guess they do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Before they could continue their conversation the other two robed figures ran over and pushed their way between Vect and the woman, speaking in a language Vect couldn&#39;t understand, but hearing it made him strangely uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
Stepping away from the stranger and letting the newcomers fret over her, Vect followed behind Faral. Before he entered the palace proper, Vect glanced over his shoulder towards the trio and saw the woman looking back at him.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Faral left Vect in the hands of a servant as she left to prepare her own report of the incident. The servant led Vect through the halls to his personal room on the fourth floor. The bedroom alone was larger than the cabin he shared with seven other people at Frost Watch, with a bed that could hold four people comfortably.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the gods is this my room?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it not to your liking my lord,&quot; the servant asked, mistaking his shock for outrage.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no. This is great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am glad it is to your liking lord Vectivus. Your traveling supplies were brought up ahead of you. No one unpacked for you out of respect for your privacy. Shall I remain for further help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No thank you,&quot; Vect began to reach into his coin purse to give a tip for the servant&#39;s help.<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t be necessary my lord,&quot; the servant tried to refuse the offered coins respectfully.<br />
<br />
Realizing the social faux pas he just did, high elves didn&#39;t tip servers and saw it as an attempt to buy their loyalty, Vect withdrew the coins. &quot;My apologies, I...it&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve been in a setting like this. Rest assured I wasn&#39;t trying to buy your services off, it&#39;s just tradition in the human lands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t mind my asking, but why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s to show appreciation for services rendered. When can I see my father,&quot; Vect asked, eager to change the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father is currently holding court and will be busy for a few more hours unfortunately. However, you are scheduled to join him for dinner after court. I will be sent for you at that time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. Any suggestions on my attire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The closet over there has a wide variety of clothing options. All should be close to your size my lord.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, that&#39;ll be all miss...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kanya, my lord.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Miss Kanya.&quot;<br />
<br />
The serving lady left with a curt bow. Vect opened the double door to the closet and was assaulted by a multitude of colors. All variety of hues and styles filled the closet and nearly overwhelmed Vect with the variety of choices. Vect proceeded to try a few of the clothes and was very unsettled at just how well they fit him.<br />
<br />
&#39;Do I really want to know how they know my measurements?&#39; Vect shivered at the thought, but shook the thoughts away and selected his clothes for the night. He decided to pass the time by practicing inside his dreamscape. Soon enough there came a knock on his door letting him know it was time for dinner.</p>
