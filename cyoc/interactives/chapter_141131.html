<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I cautiously approached the man, unsure of what to do. I wanted -- no, I NEEDED him to tell me what I was supposed to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;On your knees, boy,&quot; he stated. I obeyed.<br />
<br />
The man unbuckled his jeans and fished out his cock. I looked up at him, desperately wanting permission.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on then. Suck,&quot; he ordered. I dove for the tasty meat and began impaling my mouth on it. My head moved on instinct, sucking and bobbing and licking and kissing. Like I had done this a thousand times before.<br />
<br />
The man patted my head. &quot;Good boy. But, you know you don&#39;t need to ask for permission. In fact, you should be seducing men all the time. If someone stops you, give them a couple days, they&#39;ll come around. After all, you need cock in you. If not in your mouth, then in that sweet boypussy of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
I moaned as I felt an itch appear in the back of my throat and deep in my ass. I didn&#39;t know what to do about my ass, but I began forcing his cock deeper down my throat to fuck the itch there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; the man stated again, sending shivers of pleasure down my spine. &quot;Alright boy, here it comes.&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt his cock twitch around my tongue. Fuck yes! Finally! I was gonna get cum! I was gonna get--<br />
<br />
I jolted awake as my eyes shot open. Fuck, that dream shouldn&#39;t have felt so hot. Though the more I thought of it, the less I could remember about what had happened. Eventually, all I could remember was a weird tingle on my lips.<br />
<br />
I looked around at the room and at my current state. I groaned as I felt the dried cum on my chest. I felt oddly disappointed by it. Not because I had cum on my chest, but... What was it?<br />
<br />
Regardless, I needed a shower. I slipped out from under my covers and looked over at Taylor. The redhead clearly kept going after I went to sleep. In fact, he had probably only recently gone to sleep judging by the wet cum on his sheets. I noticed the liquid pool where his body rested. Fuck, that&#39;s why I was disappointed. I didn&#39;t get any cum yet!<br />
<br />
I quickly scooped a nice dollop of cum onto my two fingers and happily licked. Mmm, that&#39;s the stuff. I quickly swiped two more tastes before grabbing my towel. Sure, Taylor might be disappointed when he wakes up considering how much cum I stole, but that slut would have to learn to share. Cum tasted too good.<br />
<br />
Seeing his current state, I shuddered remembering what had happened last night. Being without Lisa was clearly starting to take its toll. We&#39;d almost been complete fags! I&#39;m just glad we stopped when we did. Sure, it made a lot of cum, but he could&#39;ve just jacked off in my mouth or something. I didn&#39;t need to help and be so gay.<br />
<br />
Thinking about last night&#39;s events, I had an amazing realization. Looking down, I nearly cheered seeing my softened dick. My hard-on had finally subsided! I let out a giggle in relief. I was so glad everything was back to normal.<br />
<br />
I began looking through my clothes, trying to figure out what to wear. Everything seemed so... plain? I didn&#39;t know how to feel about it.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I settled on my tightest pair of jeans and a yellow tanktop. I thought about underwear, but it seemed so excessive. Instead, I quietly slipped out of my room and headed for the showers.<br />
<br />
It was only by the time I got there that I realized I had walked the whole way without putting on clothes first. Oops! I giggled. Luckily, no one was around. It seemed that everyone finally got tired and fell asleep. I thought about checking every stall for cum, but decided against it. I had standards. Instead, I found a little bit by the mirrors and greedily licked it up. It would have to do.<br />
<br />
Setting my clothes and towel aside, I took my bar of soap and turned on the hot water. Feeling the warmth envelope me felt great. It almost made me forget about the past couple of days.<br />
<br />
I looked down, hoping to say goodbye to the cum I couldn&#39;t eat, but to my horror, that wasn&#39;t the only thing leaving my body. Terrified, I watched as piles of hair flooded the drain, threatening to clog it before somehow dissolving away. This couldn&#39;t be happening! I was still in college, I had so many years left! I couldn&#39;t be going bald, I couldn&#39;t be--<br />
<br />
Confused, I felt around my head, noticing the locks of hair remained, though far more wet than when I entered the shower. Where had all that hair come from?<br />
<br />
I felt my face, only to find that the stubble I should&#39;ve grown overnight was no where to be found. In fact, my face was smooth as butter. I lowered my hands, only to realize that my chest felt the similar. I looked down, watching as the hair on my legs was the last to go, leaving me with no body hair whatsoever. I felt more naked than usual, but I also couldn&#39;t tell if I liked it or not. Lisa would probably like it. She never was a fan of too much hair, even if I prided myself on it. It was a sign of my manhood. I was sure Taylor would like the change, though. Although, I didn&#39;t know why I wanted to impress him.<br />
<br />
I used my soap to feel around my body. I had to admit, the smoothness did feel nice. The soap glided across my abs with ease and even caused me to elicit a small moan from the good feeling. Slowly, I lowered my hands.<br />
<br />
My soft cock felt almost alien without the bush of hair around it. As much as I wanted to say it felt bad, it really felt great. Plus, I knew it would look longer now, though, I didn&#39;t really care about the length of my rod too much right now.<br />
<br />
I wanted to play with myself longer, but it appeared that my cock did not want to respond to my touch. I was slightly worried by it, but I chalked it up to my extended session yesterday. Instead, I reached around to my backside. My ass felt smoother than I had ever thought possible, and it felt great. Taylor would love this. Oh, and probably Lisa, too.<br />
<br />
A curious thought popped into my head. It was like I was recalling something but couldn&#39;t figure out where I remembered it from. All I knew was that there was some itch in my ass and I wanted to scratch it. Luckily, my bar of soap had been perfectly worn down for the job. Without thinking, I slipped a finger in my ass. Shocks of pleasure coursed through my body. Fuck, that felt good! I quickly began adding more fingers in, pumping as I did so. It felt so tight! I wanted more. More!<br />
<br />
I had teased myself enough. I pulled my fingers out of my ass and grabbed the soap. I steadied myself against one wall of the shower and spread my legs. I couldn&#39;t tell which would kill me first: my anticipation or my lust. I began pushing the soap in, my mouth curving into an &quot;O&quot; as it did so. Fuck! I needed this! I didn&#39;t even know it, but my ass had felt so empty before this. This felt amazing!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck! Fuck yeah! My ass feels amazing! Fuck!&quot; I yelled, unable to control myself. Was it bigger, too? It definitely felt like my cheeks had gotten sexier.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure it fucking does!&quot; someone yelled out before moaning. Apparently, I wasn&#39;t as discrete about this as I thought I was. Oh well, I thought with a giggle.<br />
<br />
I looked down to watch my soap give me new levels of pleasure and noticed that my cock was hard as a rock. I threw my head back in pleasure. It made sense that getting my ass stuffed would make me crazy. I was a bottom, after all.<br />
<br />
That thought sent me over the edge. I blew my load, sending massive spurts all over the shower stall. Some managed to hit my face and I quickly licked up what I could. As soon as my orgasm subsided, I dove for whatever cum I could find. As the sweet nectar slid down my throat, more waves of pleasure shuddered through me. Each wave shifted the desire in my ass upwards, until it settled in the back of my throat. I was on my hands and knees when I realized it.<br />
<br />
Fuck. I needed to suck a cock.</p>
