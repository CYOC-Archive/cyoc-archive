<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Um Alex...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He lied to me and I fell for it!&quot; Chris answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These earrings made me like guys!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex raised her right eyebrow. &quot;Come on, be serious!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm serious, I ... I...like guys now! Oh God, how could I have been so stupid? I should never have trusted that guy!&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean, if you look at those guys over there,&quot; Alex said pointing to a group of young men. &quot;You get excited?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris nodded her head as tears started to form. &quot;This isn't fair! I'm a guy! I like girls, not guys! We were supposed to be more then just friends, now we can't be anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex hugged Chris. &quot;We can still be friends. I can show you that being a girl isn't so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, it's crazy. I find guys attractive now! I want to date them! This isn't right. I'm not supposed to be this way! What am I going to tell my parents and my friends? Please Alex, you have to help change me back! I can't be this way, I don't know how to be this way!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris, calm down, we'll figure things out. I promise you that being a girl isn't so bad. Look, why don't we go to my place and try to figure out what to do?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not hot for guys. I'm going to fight this. I don't care what these earrings are making my body think, I'm not hot for guys!&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
Chris nodded at Alex and they started to walk out of the mall. There had to be a way to fix this. Chris figured that she had to be able to find someone to talk to or to make a deal with somebody that could help her! She was not going to give into this!<br />
<br />
When they were in the car, Chris looked around to make sure no one could see them and touched Alex's right cheek. &quot;I need to resist this Alex. Please kiss me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiss you? I dunno Chris. If you're a girl now then woulden't that be wrong? Is it what you really want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to fight this! Please, I know it's hard for you. My body is screaming at me not to do it but I can't give in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded. &quot;All right Chris, I'll do this for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris nodded back. &quot;Just think of my male self when you do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex closed her eyes and Chris leaned in before closing her own eyes. The two pressed their lips together. Chris knew that she should have enjoyed this moment. Unfortunately, her mind kept fighting her, telling her that she should be doing this with guys! Finally, she had to pull away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I just can't enjoy it anymore,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me either,&quot; Alex replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still think you're beautiful Alex but I just don't feel ... that about you any more. I'm sorry,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not your fault,&quot; Alex said.<br />
<br />
Chris looked into the mirror on the visor and a thought crossed her mind. She reached for the earrings and took both of them off, placing both of the dashboard. &quot;These made me like boys! I'm not going to wear them!&quot; Chris waited for her orientation to go back to what for her was normal but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, whatever magic the old man had infused the rings with had other ideas. Both of them started to glow bright white.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Chris ... what's happening?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I er I dunno!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both rings suddenly vanished and reappeared on Chris' ears. Before the lass could react, everything around the duo faded until they were surrounded with white light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris, what's going on?&quot; Alex yelled. Her voice was distorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris watched Alex and saw her clothes begin to glow. With her mouth open, Chris could only be a witness as Alex's clothes changed. First, Alex's shirt shrunk, exposing an increasing amount of her lower torso. The sleeves vanished and the shirt top of the shirt seemed to melt away into nothing, leaving Alex wearing only her bra. Said bra started to take on a different texture and color until it became a revealing pink bikini top. <br />
<br />
If Chris was still his old self, he'd be drolling by now. That only served to increase her madness.<br />
<br />
Alex's pants underwent a similar shift. They melted off of Alex's body and while in a liquid state, morphed into a beach blanket before solidifying into one. Chris now watched Alex's panties glow and shift into a pink bikini bottom.<br />
<br />
Instead of feeling attracted to her friend, Chris felt a sense that Alex looked great with perhaps a hint of jealousy. Alex's shoes were the last the change. her socks vanished completely and her shoes became pink sandals.<br />
<br />
Now it was Chris' clothes turn. Her own shirt shrunk away, revealing more skin by the second. Chris' clothes underwent changes much as Alex's had until she was clad in a blue bikini.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to admit, Chris, not bad,&quot; Alex said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the world came back into focus. The blanks beneath Chris and Alex hit solid ground. an unseen force gently lowered both young women onto their backs on the blankets. Whispers that seemed to come out of nowhere surrounded them and grew louder. Music started playing and the sounds of sea gulls and water appeared. The white under them began to form into the light brown sand as the White above them formed into the blue sky and the white around them into people, stands and everything else one would associate with the beach.<br />
<br />
Before Chris knew it, she and Alex were laying in the middle of a warm beach. Chris could feel the hot sun on her chest, hear the people around around her and smell the water and sand.<br />
<br />
No one seemed to react to their sudden appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we now?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, besides the obvious, I don't know,&quot; Alex answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, so I'm now a girl that likes guys and I'm at the beach dressed in a way that I Just know the guys would love,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris, look, I know this is messed up but you might as well enjoy it. I mean, I doubt there's anything we can do about this,&quot; Alex said. Chris watched her friend look around until she found a bag beside them. Alex reached into and pulled out a bottle of what Chris assumed was sunscreen.<br />
<br />
Before Alex could say anything, a beach ball landed between the two of them, spraying both of their legs with warm sand. A guy walked up to them shortly after. He was wearing black swim trunks, had short brown hair, a washboard stomach with well defined muscles and to top it off, he was tall and had a confident expression. In short, from Chris' point of view at least, this young man, was everything a guy would want to be in this situation. Moreso, he was everything Chris wanted in a guy.<br />
<br />
Chris giggled at the guy and smiled. &quot;Hello,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
She chided herself inside for doing what these new sensations inside of her wanted her to do. Unfortunately, it had felt right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; the guy said. He seemed a little nervous. Chris knew that in his position, she would be as well. &quot;I know this sounds lame, but would either of you like me to rub some of that lotion into your backs?&quot;</p>
