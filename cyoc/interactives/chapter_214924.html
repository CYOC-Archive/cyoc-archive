<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On one side, the track bordered against an old growth forest. One of the last pristine stretches of wilderness in the state, it was fiercely protected by both the local government and the college. Countless flora, fauna, and biology majors counted on it for their survival. There was a pack of coyotes near the fence, hidden in the shadow of the woods.<br />
<br />
The red wave flashed overhead. An intense pressure exploded through Jacob&#39;s body, and he blacked out.<br />
<br />
When he came to, he found himself bolting towards the forest. On all fours. Wind coursed through his fur as his heart raced. His multiple breasts swung heavily underneath of him. Wait, his what?!<br />
<br />
Jacob suddenly lost all coordination. He tripped forward in a pile of limbs and fur. Regaining his composure, he looked down at his body. He was stunned by what he saw. His torso was still mostly human in shape. It was covered with a light coat of brown, tan, and white fur. Lining his torso were eight human breasts, the largest of which were approximately J cups, dwindling down to A cups as they went farther down. He followed the trail of titties down his body until he got to his crotch, where a sheath protruded from between his legs. When he was a human, he was pretty average, but having now combined with who knows how many coyotes, it was definitely a sight to behold. His furred testicles settled behind them, each about the size of an apple. He guessed that he had merged with multiple male and female coyotes, but he didn&#39;t feel anything else between his legs, just his new sheath. Perhaps his hips seemed a little wider, and his waist a little smaller, though he wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
Then he saw his legs. They were the same size as his old human legs, but entirely canine. His tail swished between them. The human parts of his brain were screaming, but it felt entirely natural to him. His ear began to itch.<br />
<br />
He tried to reach up to scratch it, only to find that his arms did not work like that anymore. He wanted to scream as he looked at them. His arms had turned into the forelegs and paws of a coyote. He didn&#39;t even have his thumbs anymore! His dew claw seemed to twitch a little whenever he tried to close his hand into a fist, but all he managed to do was flex his remaining fingers. <br />
<br />
A barrage of scents assaulted his brain as he began to hyperventalate. He wanted to cry as his eyes turned inwards, settling on his nose. He saw tan fur and the edge of his black canid nose. <i>A muzzle. Great,</i> he thought. <i>How am I supposed to survive like this?!</i><br />
<br />
He shook his head violently, hoping that it was just a dream. That he&#39;d wake up and be back to being human. A competing thought passed through just after, barely noticeable, wishing for the opposite. To be back to being a normal coyote. His ears flapping against his head as he shook it brought him back into reality. He felt his hair flop too, slightly more fur-like. His hair! However, he also felt the breeze flow through the fur on his coyote snout. He sighed, realizing what this meant.<br />
<br />
He opened his mouth, letting his tongue loll out as he reached a paw in. He felt his new, canid teeth, and the soft leathery pads on the bottom of his new paws. His claw nicked his cheek and he let out a yelp. Not a human yelp, but a distinctly canid one.<br />
<br />
He pulled his now damp paw from his mouth as his ears pitched around, turning towards screams coming from the field. As he turned his head, he began to see the sources of some of the new scents he&#39;d noticed. In a pile in the far corner were the cheerleaders. They had merged while practicing the pyramid, had fallen during the merge, and struggled to even move. Stress and fear eminated strongly from them. He saw the couple in the bleachers, now giving each other deep tongue kisses with the heads of the old woman&#39;s dogs. Their tails wagged. It looked like the old woman was unaffected, at least from this distance, though she&#39;d been teleported nearby the couple. He wondered if they were now her pets.<br />
<br />
His instincts were screaming at him to get back to the woods, to safety. To his pack. But his curiosity was also piqued. He pushed himself onto all fours, his breasts hanging unsupported underneath his torso. He decided to get a closer look at...</p>
