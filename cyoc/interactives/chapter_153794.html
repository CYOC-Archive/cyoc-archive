<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After only half an hour, the truck arrived on a large farm and the unloading began. Kimi and the other cows were lead into a large building. Two farmhands were waiting for the new livestock. They examined every cow and led some through the left and some through the right gate of the building. Kimi was curious about that.<br />
When she came in line, the one farmhand said &quot;Very nice, is she off to the fattening pen, or right away to the slaughterhouse?&quot;<br />
Kimi&#39;s excitement reaches its climax as the other man answered &quot;She&#39;s intended for slaughter this Thursday&quot;.<br />
Kimi felt like someone had just hit her with a bolt gun. She was aware that beef cattle are sent to the slaughterhouse one day. But her plan was to be human again before that would be happen whit her. Her cow transformation will last a full week so her poor plan won&#39;t work. Her mind was blank. What was she supposed to do now?<br />
<br />
She had done this before. Last year she transformed into a turkey and was bought by a family who fatten her up. Two weeks before Thanksgiving the transformation pill wore off. Fortunately the fattening up didn&#39;t affect her human body. If someone had watched her, he would have wondered why an attractive woman with long blonde hair was sitting naked in the turkey coop. She stole a pair of jeans and a sweater from the washing line and sneaked away. She knew that this adventure was a playing with fire. But it was the most exciting adventure, she&#39;s ever had. After a week she wanted to meet the family whose Thanksgiving feast she would have become. She wanted to explain the situation and to refund the costs of the family. She rang at their house and an elderly overweight man opened her the door. While she was telling her story she noticed a growing lust in the eyes of that man. As soon as she was done with her story, he told her that she was lucky because they had actually wanted to slaughter their turkey two weeks ago. He just hadn&#39;t found the time. She thought she heard regret in his voice. Even though she should have been upset she felt this thrill and excitement again. With bad luck she would have been a frozen turkey in his freezer. But she have had luck and she stood there as an attractive woman in his kitchen, the place where her adventure could have been ended.<br />
&quot;That means you are still my property as I bought you 5 weeks ago, right? And you are wearing the clothes of my wife, aren&#39;t you&quot; he said with a thoughtful tone.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s one of the reasons why I&#39;m here&quot; Kimi answered and started undressing the tight jeans. The thought that she was for 4 weeks the property of this man in front of her filled her with great sexual desire toward him. She wore the stolen clothes only to underline her story. She didn&#39;t have in mind to change her clothes in front of a strange man. But the whole situation had made her horny and she wanted to be fucked by that man. She knew he was married but obviously his wife wasn&#39;t at home and she didn&#39;t care about anything at that moment. And she also knew it wouldn&#39;t be hard for her to seduce him.<br />
&quot;So you are planning to return to our coop? Are you sure about that. If you are a turkey, I will treat you as one. But you are lucky, we have already a new turkey so we could keep you until next year.&quot; he said confused by the naked women in front of him.<br />
&quot;No, I didn&#39;t have that in mind. I don&#39;t want to become anyone&#39;s dinner. But I enjoyed the time in your coop and I could imagine to come back for a few weeks. I just wanted to give back the stolen clothes and maybe I can repay for the prize you have paid for me in a different way?&quot; she said with a seducing smile.<br />
He didn&#39;t take long to ask and they had wild sex on his dinner table . She had one of the best sex, she&#39;s ever had. When she climaxed the image of a roasted turkey flashed through her mind. Kimi wondered what would happen if she took another pill and change again into a turkey for 4 weeks. She wondered, how he would treat her now. She knew, that she has taken a path where danger and excitement lie close together. But in the end she knew that her dark fantasies never should come true in reality. She put on the clothes she had brought with her and left the house. As she saw the empty turkey coop, she knew she had chosen the right decision. But she also knew that she would repeat such an adventure.<br />
<br />
And finally her dark desire led her into serious trouble.<br />
&quot;But there&#39;s no meat on her. Shouldn&#39;t we fatten her up at first?&quot; the first farm hand respond to his coworker. Kimi found new hope in his words.<br />
&quot;Because that&#39;s a transformee. We have to get rid of her before she turns back and we have spent lots of money for nothing.&quot; the second worker said.<br />
&quot;Are you sure, that she&#39;s a former woman, how do you know? If you are right we can&#39;t do that!&quot; the first man said in surprise.<br />
&quot;Do you see the blue pattern around her right hind leg? That&#39;s a human tattoo. It&#39;s not our business if someone has decided to become a beef cattle. We are here to make profit!&quot; the second man responded coldly and led Kimi through the right pen.<br />
<br />
Kimi knew from the transformation community that the meat industry make a short process with humans sneaked into their facilities to discourage imitators. So rule number one is not to behave like a human if you stay as a farm animal. Kimi has totally forgotten about her new tattoo.  She never thought the tattoo she got during her summer holiday would ever bring her into serious troubles.<br />
And now there she is. A woman who voluntary changed into a beef cattle rounded up with cattle which are meant for the slaughterhouse in two days. She knew this could happen, but she can&#39;t believe it&#39;s really gonna happen. In her fantasy she would change back in front of a surprised farm hand and she would have wild sex with the guy who would have taken care for her during her time on his farm.<br />
<br />
She has only a few options now. She could accept her fate or she could try to run away. And maybe there is the possibility that the kind farm hand would rescue her.</p>
