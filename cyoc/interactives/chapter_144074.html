<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter will be retconning in the idea that Regina had been having much difficulty in making friends with the rest of the group. Nothing to the contrary of that has been said in previous chapters, but this probably should have been established earlier.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That morning&#39;s breakfast was donuts. Fresh, warm, fluffy donuts. Several before unseen fold-out tables were brought into the auditorium, just for the glazed donuts alone. The glazed donuts stacked over two feet high, a stack that was also five-feet wide. The girls immediately ran for the glazed, and by the time the pile was dug down to the bottom, it was observed that the donuts at the bottom had been compressed (to almost 1/3rd their width) by the sheer weight of the pile.<br />
<br />
The glazed were but the tip of the iceberg, however. To the left of the glazed was a small table dedicated entirely to chocolate frosted donuts. To the right was another table of Boston cream-filled donuts, followed by a table of jelly donuts. Further along rested a not insignificantly-sized pile of chocolate long johns. A respectable tray of blueberry cake donuts laid past that one, followed still by a tray of apple fritters.<br />
<br />
At the very end rested a table boasting a small tray of scrambled eggs and spinach, next to a pitcher of water. This was, naturally, the &quot;weak foods table,&quot; but unlike yesterday, only one person found herself standing at it this morning.<br />
<br />
Paula Bishop--distraught when her group turned outright hysterical over the introduction of the point system just earlier--sniffled and snooted as she used a pair of tongs to put a quantity of eggs and spinach onto her plate. Once she was done, she just stood there at the table a while. She was waiting. Waiting for her &quot;weak food&quot; friends to show up at the table next to her. However, they never came. In fact, she saw them right across from the long john table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regina, what the hell?&quot; Paula exclaimed, storming over to her friend. She wanted to be more aggressive and indignant about it than she was, but she knew what the response was going to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Regina said, noticing Paula&#39;s plate, then looking down at her own starchy, sugary entree. &quot;Sorry Paula, I&#39;m just... the points, and... look, I&#39;m just gonna try eating the unhealthy food for a while, okay? I&#39;m not even eating that much.&quot; She said, pointing out that her plate had only two donuts (she was planning on going for a third, but changed her mind in light of Paula&#39;s upsettedness.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.&quot; Paula huffed. She turned around and stomped off.<br />
<br />
The &quot;healthy kids club,&quot; all but one of them failing to live up to their title at the moment, nonetheless met up at the same table as last time. Paula, too, joined after some hesitation (the alternative being to sit all by herself.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmmm.&quot; Nami hummed, munching down on a glazed donut. &quot;MMMMMMGGNNN!&quot; She moaned, as she finished it off much faster than she would have expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;God...is it happening?&quot; Another one of the girls said. &quot;Are we gonna become slobs after all?&quot; She leaned in and took a bite out of a jelly donut. She began to cry, and scarfed it all down in a few bites.<br />
<br />
Regina had already finished her glazed, and was halfway down her long john. She was <i>trying</i> to contain her excitement, but she had never tasted anything so wonderful before. Despite her immense temptation, she and Nami took advantage of their lifetime of conditioning under starvation, and avoided going for any more donuts. They finished off their glasses of milk, and considered themselves finished with breakfast. The other girls at the table (sans Paula,) however, caved and went back to the tables--all returning with plates heavier than the first time.<br />
<br />
All-told, the chocolate frosted donuts were the favorite of the community. The table had been completely emptied within 7 minutes of breakfast-time beginning. Most girls didn&#39;t even get an opportunity to go get more on their second trip. A few of them whined and complained about that. One girl screamed and threw a fit that she didn&#39;t get enough chocolate frosted donuts. She grabbed a jelly donut and threw it on the floor, then stomped on it. She stormed away to her Community Director, crying (and with a sock covered in jelly.)<br />
<br />
The Boston cream-filled were not as popular, but even more ravenously consumed by the few who enjoyed them. Several girls were eating them so fast, the cream was oozing out the other side and falling on their dresses. The cream was getting all over their hands. One girl sat down with an entire plate of Boston cream-filled, and ended with chocolate smeared left-and-right on her face; cream all over her chin and dripping down to her neck. She downed an entire pint of milk right after that, and let out an enormous burp. The others at her table giggled at her, and then continued to munch away at their own donuts.<br />
<br />
The jelly donuts were an even stranger case. There were two specific kids who just wouldn&#39;t stop eating them. They weren&#39;t eating them particularly fast, they just sat next to each other, munching down on them <i>constantly</i> without stopping. Their Community Director had to pat them on the shoulders, to get their attention that it was time to leave the auditorium.<br />
<br />
Regina, Nami and the others stood up and grabbed their trays.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually...&quot; Regina said, looking down at her tray. &quot;We might lose points for putting our stuff away. Maybe we shouldn&#39;t.&quot; The rest of the group followed her lead in putting their tray back down on the table, except for Paula.<br />
<br />
The majority of girls, including many who were stuffed to the brim already, swarmed the tables to collect more donuts for later as snacks. There was a desperate rush to get any glazed that remained. One girl skillfully stretched out her dress, and used it as a pouch to store more than a few dozen for herself. She quickly scuttled away; unwittingly flashing her panties and her belly button as she held her dress up.<br />
<br />
While Regina and the others watched this carnage ensue, Nami turned over to Paula to ask her about Robyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, she&#39;s doing well. Really well, in fact.&quot; Paula sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I thought you guys were having issues.&quot; Nami asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, issues. Definitely. And they only got worse this morning.&quot; Paula answered. &quot;She got 125 points from yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;125??&quot; Regina exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. She watched TV constantly. But then she also got extra points for &#39;bullying&#39;.&quot; Paula said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, literally just... bullying? You get points for that too?&quot; Regina asked, amazed by the galling immorality of the system.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...&quot; Nami said, putting a finger to her chin. &quot;Does that mean we could get points just by pushing each other around?&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina stared at her a moment.<br />
&quot;...it&#39;s worth a try!&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Nami giggled. &quot;Should I start?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Regina nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay okay... okay...&quot; Nami awkwardly leaned in, raised her hands, and then gave Regina a directed and aggressive shove. &quot;Uhh... take that, nerd!&quot; She gently exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whu? You tryin&#39; a start somethin?&quot; Regina said in a terrible New England accent, giving Nami a firm shove back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, gimme your lunch money, punk!&quot; Nami slowly grasped Regina by the collar of her dress. &quot;Um, you&#39;re lame and gay and everyone hates you.&quot; She added, reaching over a palm to her cheek and very gently slapping her.<br />
<br />
&quot;OHH, AUUHH.&quot; Regina waved her arms in the air and pretended to fall to her knees.<br />
<br />
Nami and Regina paused for a moment, then looked around at the walls and ceilings where the cameras might be.<br />
<br />
Paula just stared at them.<br />
&quot;Ughh. You guys are dorks.&quot; She rolled her eyes and walked away.<br />
<br />
The auditorium had cleared up by now. Nami and Regina followed their group down into the hallway and back into their facility.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you feel the need to follow me into the bathroom?&quot; Dora asked Regina, as she let out a quick rush of urine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you didn&#39;t wipe well enough last time.&quot; Regina answered, leaning against the stall door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m only peeing this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still want to know how much toilet paper you use.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I use plenty!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how can I know that for sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, well, the security cameras. Actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The system doesn&#39;t track TP square count, as far as I know!&quot; Regina shook her head. &quot;Look, can I just come in there and see for myself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Dora pressed her legs together and blushed. &quot;I-I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dora, I think you should let me in.&quot; Regina said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-okay...&quot; Dora leaned in and unlocked the stall. Regina came in, locked it behind her and watched carefully as Dora conducted her after-pee wipe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. That&#39;s good. Can you give it just a little more toilet paper?&quot; Regina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;...sure...&quot; Dora blushed harder and did as she requested.<br />
<br />
Toilet flushed, hands washed and out of the bathroom, Dora looked over at Regina with curiosity.<br />
&quot;Why are you paying me so much attention?&quot; Dora asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, because I care about you and want to see you treated well.&quot; Regina answered frankly.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why&#39;s that? I don&#39;t get why I&#39;m special to you. We just happened to strike up a conversation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just it, though. You and Nami are the only two in this facility who will talk to me. Every other girl either loses interest and tries to worm away in a few minutes, or looks at me with active contempt. I don&#39;t know if you noticed, but I&#39;m not very popular here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Well... I dunno...&quot; Dora shrugged, looking over and noticing that one of the TVs were free. &quot;...you wanna play a game with me? There&#39;s this one I&#39;d love to do with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Regina was taken aback for a moment. She was so terrible at games (all of them were, but she unusually so,) she didn&#39;t expect an invitation like that. &quot;Sure!&quot; She answered.<br />
<br />
Now, while the TV hadn&#39;t been taken, the couch in front of it had. Someone--woozy from donut consumption--had passed out right on it. Dora and Regina had to sit on the floor in front of the couch in order to play.<br />
<br />
The game was another JRPG with co-op. It didn&#39;t have a Feedee/Feeder system (like the one mentioned previously,) but all the human characters were incredibly round females regardless. It featured light action elements, forcing both of them to confront their incredibly poor gaming skills. They had to grind through several levels before they could clear the starting forest&#39;s mini boss. When they finally got to the town, Regina wanted to waddle around the streets and talk to every single NPC. Dora got bored of this after a while, and decided to stand up and take a break while Regina continued scouring the village.<br />
<br />
This was when Dora noticed just how messy the facility had gotten. Dozens and dozens of wrappers were on the floor; crumbs scattered around the carpet. In the kitchen, someone had spilled apple juice and just let it stay there and get sticky. In fact, someone had gotten their sock stuck in it, and just let it slip off and stay there. Nevertheless, Dora was feeling the desire for a snack. She saw some microwavable chicken nuggets in the freezer. She popped a few dozen of those in and gave them 3.5 minutes to heat up (she was well-versed in microwaves and other appliances, from her experience in the trash processing plant.)<br />
<br />
While the nuggets were in the microwave, Dora decided to head back to the lounge area and sit back down next to Regina.<br />
&quot;Okay, where are you now?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m in this glassblower&#39;s shop. She says she&#39;ll make me a crystal orb if I cure her daughter&#39;s illness.&quot; Regina answered, eyes glued to the screen. &quot;But I keep giving her kid stuff to eat, and none of it works. I gave her all of my bread, almost half of my candies and even one of my jasmine potions! I wasted it all just trying to heal this stupid girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
A few minutes of exploring the glassblower&#39;s shop later, and Dora heard the &quot;beep&quot; from the microwave go off. She started to get up, but found herself suddenly tired.<br />
&quot;Hey... Regina...&quot; She asked meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Regina asked, not breaking eye contact with the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you go get the nuggets in the microwave for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Sure.&quot; She stood right up and went for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And could you get some sauce, too?&quot; Dora asked, relieved to not have to get up for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, what kind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ketchup and mustard, please!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aha, I&#39;ve actually had ketchup and mustard before!&quot; Regina crowed.<br />
<br />
Regina assembled the snack as instructed, and delivered the plate unto the coffee table that she and Dora had been sitting in front of. They returned to the game together, nibbling away at their nuggets. As they played, Dora and Regina kept getting grease from the nuggets onto their controllers. The buttons became shiny, and the crevices and niches around the buttons and analog sticks accumulated tiny nugget crumbs. Dora&#39;s controller even got a few drops of mustard on it. Busy with the game, she tried to quickly wipe it off with her dress. She only got some of the mustard out; the rest stayed on the controller.</p>
