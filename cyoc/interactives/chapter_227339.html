<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a few more minutes Luke panted pressing his head against the floor of the changing room as the Great Dane continued releasing his puppy batter deep into his bowels. <br />
<br />
&#39;I have a fucking dog&#39;s tail! How did the kid manage to do this to me? How am I gonna get out of this?&#39; Luke pondered frantically to himself, but his thoughts were interrupted by the kid starting to step away.  He feared the knot would tear his abused ass, and he started to move backward. However the kid was quicker, and gave a tug causing Luke&#39;s eyes to cross and teeth clench in panicked expectation. The pain was there, but with a flood of relief Luke felt the knot pop out, quickly followed by 8 inches of throbbing Dane cock. Luke collapsed on the floor quivering as dog cum came pouring out of his ass.<br />
<br />
The kid for his part sat down and began licking his member clean.  Seeing his opportunity Luke carefully began moving to get up and get his clothes and try to get out of here.  However, his movement caught the kids attention who stopped cleaning himself and looked over at him.  Luke pulled his legs below himself and was starting to push himself to his knees when he heard the clicking of the kid’s claws as he padded up behind him.  Luke tries to get up, but is toppled forward when the large dog thrusts his nose into Luke’s crack and begins lapping at his abused hole.<br />
<br />
“Fuck kid, stop it!” Luke protests and tries to crawl away, but the Dane follows behind sniffing and lapping at his backside. “If you think you’re gonna ram that thing in me again, you have another thing coming.”  Even as Luke says that, he remembers feeling that massive tool stretching him wide and driving him to a mind-shattering climax, he stops trying to crawl away.  “Please kid, don’t do this to me. I have a family.” Luke pants even as his own member grows rigid below him and starts touching against the skin on his belly. <br />
<br />
The large dog seemed to ignore his pleas at first.  It continued to work his slightly rough tongue into Luke’s hole, lapping out the juices of their encounter.  Luke was just beginning to push backward into the tongue to get more of that delectable muscle deeper in him when the kid stopped his attention and turned his back to Luke and thrust his tail in the air in an obvious invitation for Luke to investigate.<br />
<br />
Luke looked at the kid&#39;s puckered hole as it wiggled and flexed as his tail wagged excitedly. Seeing that the dog might be giving an opening, and he might finally be able to escape the insistent dog, he began to move to stand up, feeling his heart pounding and starting to breathe easier.  However, he paused as he began to note the smell in the room. It had smelled of sweat and sex, but a new spicy smell caught his attention.  He would have ignored it, but the smell took on an identity in his head.  Large male adult dog, virile/excited/inviting.  <br />
<br />
He had crawled forward two steps before he shook his head trying to clear his mind. “All I gotta do is get up and leave.”  He muttered to himself, but even as he said it, the smell grew stronger. <br />
<br />
He closed his eyes trying to gather his will.  When he reopened them he gasped seeing that he had unwillingly crawled forward another step, and he was now just a few feet away from the gorgeous backend of the noble Dane before him.  The subtle whorls of the fur around the pucker and anal glands down to the pendulous orbs that hung in his black sac entranced him.  He felt his heart rate increase, and a rush of excitement to his core. <br />
<br />
While some distant voice in his head begged him to just get up and leave, Luke leaned forward and inhaled deeply.  Strong aromas washed into his nose and crashed into his brain.  He felt his ears pop like he was on an airplane, and the itch of a cough grew as he felt his nasal cavity expand, pulling in more air and causing snot to drain from his sinuses down the back of his throat.  Luke hardly noticed this though.  His mind was overwhelmed with a cacophony of smell and information.  The primary smell was acrid and almost spicy, but there were markers and characteristics in it that told him that he now “knew” the beast before him, while in the dark recess of his mind he retched at the objectively noxious smell.  <br />
<br />
However that revulsion was overpowered by his curiosity at all the information he was learning about the male before him.   He could smell what the dog recently ate, its health, its current mental disposition. It was like a tapestry of references that coalesced in an identity. <br />
<br />
Luke closed his eyes and shook his head and exhaled.  He didn’t even notice that as he breathed out through his nose it grew a little larger and the end of it started to develop a cracked texture.  He tried to pause and get a grip on his situation, but now that that kid&#39;s smell was starting to fade in his mind, he felt a growing desire to partake again.  <br />
<br />
Bemused he opens his eyes and crawls forward a step and pushes his nose against the canine rear, and draws in a halting breath.  The smell was so much stronger now.  Both more rank and disturbing to some part of his mind, but also more alluring, telling clearly the sexual need pulsing within the giant beast. The smell was so strong now he could almost taste it.  In fact, he realized as he huffed at the puckered hole, he could taste it.  It was earthy and musty, and gibbering part of his mind was disgusted by the taste, but to a growing part of him it tasted intriguing. An intrusive thought wondered if he should lick the kids behind.  After all dogs do that, right?<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!” Luke exclaimed loudly, realizing what he was thinking.  The massive dog before him jumped a bit from the outburst, but quickly wagged its tail brushing across Luke’s face. The fur of the tail caressed across his nose as it grew darker and the texture deepened. It also brought with it a fresh assault of smell dripping with arousal. Luke’s cock throbbed almost painfully as it grew redder with the inflow of blood to the organ.<br />
<br />
“Please kid, if you’re in there, make it stop.  I’m sorry I tried to take your costume.  I don’t want to...” Luke pleaded as he leaned forward again into the dog’s rear, “lick you… there.” His words became increasingly muffled as his body betrayed his mind and he tentatively touched his tongue to the quivering pucker. The musky, acrid, taste filled his mouth and his mind.  The flavor was so strong and rank it made him want to retch, but the taste was arousing.  His heart started thumping in his chest, and his cock started to feel painfully hard.  At the base of his member the skin started to attach to his belly.  He felt a wet warmth on his abdomen as his member started spurting out precum. <br />
He felt like there was something else in possession of his body as he began to repeatedly lap at the dog’s rear.  As his tongue ran across the furry end it began to encounter more resistance as his tongue gained more texture.  That resistance in turn seemed to also cause his tongue to grow longer and flatter. With each lap his tongue bathed more of the Dane’s rear.  With each lap the nuances of the taste deepened and changed.  With a bit of surprise, Luke realized that he no longer was revolted, instead he began to look forward to the tastes he would find. Soon his ever darkening, widening, nose was pressed firmly against the kids rear as his long tongue snaked into the canine anal cavity. <br />
<br />
As he tasted and smelled the dog&#39;s bouquet he realized that he could also detect hints of the boy buried deep within the massive dog costume.  As he pondered this, a mental picture emerged in his mind of the kid similar to what had happened when he first smelled the dog: young/excited/nervous/horny.  That horniness laced every smell and taste.  The kid was begging for attention as much as the dog was.  This additional element of arousal caused Luke’s dick to throb with need as the skin stitched itself up to the top of his foreskin giving him a hairless sheath. <br />
<br />
Eventually Luke had slathered the Dane’s rear to a point that it started to lose some of its tantalizing scents/tastes.  The only thing that remained constant was the smell of horniness.  Luke gains enough control to pause for a moment.</p>
