<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I just wish you&#39;d grow up!&quot; He angrily whined. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until he finished the wish that he realized what he had done. He felt another rumble through his body, although it was much fainter, and reality seemed to change again. Bill looked back at where Kimberly was sitting and grew fearful when his sister was nowhere to be seen. He panicked for another second until he heard laughter from the front seat.<br />
<br />
He looked back towards his mother and his jaw almost dropped. There, in the passenger&#39;s seat, was an older woman who looked just like his mother. She had similar long brown hair to his mother&#39;s although it was tied up in a bun. Her face looked different too but they were clearly close enough to be sisters. She was wearing a black cardigan with a darker pair of capri pants. <br />
<br />
Bill&#39;s brain finally caught up as he realized what happened. He had changed Kimberly into a woman his mother&#39;s age! He no longer felt angry, but rather felt awful at what he had done. He may not have always gotten along with his sister, but that didn&#39;t mean he wanted to steal close to 30 years of her life.<br />
<br />
He tried to get angry again but it was still no use. He wondered if his new body had any affect on how angry he could get, or if the childlike brain was too happy to be angry. He sighed as he leaned back in his new purple booster seat. He kept trying to make eye contact with Kimberly in the front but she was too  busy talking with their mom.<br />
<br />
Bill wondered if, since she wasn&#39;t holding the stone, she could even remember the change. Before Bill could wonder any longer, he suddenly felt the minivan grind to a halt. He barely held onto the stone, and before long the side door swung open to reveal the older Kimberly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again for coming with me to drop Becky off Kim.&quot; He heard his mother say. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem sis. You know I love hanging out with you Mary. And this cutie of course!&quot; Kimberly laughed as she squeezed Bill&#39;s cheeks.<br />
<br />
Bill figured his theory was true, as he would have figure Kimberly would have went for the stone by now. He couldn&#39;t believe he had accidentally made his sister an aunt. He guessed it was kind of revenge for what she did to him, but it was crazy nonetheless. Bill hopped down from the van with a bit a difficulty thanks to his new short legs, and then was forced to hold &#39;Kim&#39;s&#39; hand as they crossed the street.<br />
<br />
As they walked towards his old school, he suddenly felt the stone get pulled from his hand. Shocked, he turned to see Kimberly shaking her head and laughing a bit.<br />
&quot;Nice try little lady, you thought I forgot didn&#39;t you?&quot; She asked happily.<br />
<br />
Bill was stunned for words but luckily Kim continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not mad or anything. In a way, your wish kind of worked. I feel more mature than ever. My old life kind of feels like a dream too. Like, I see Mary more as my twin sister than I do my mother.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... if you&#39;re not mad, then why&#39;d you take the stone?&quot; He asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, I still think you need to learn a bit of a lesson. Besides, it&#39;s not like either of us are angry enough to make a proper wish.&quot; She continued. &quot;Even if we were, being that angry comes at a cost of logic. We&#39;re gonna need to come up with a better way of changing you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two finally approached the front of the building, Bill looked at her confused. <br />
&quot;Wait, what about you? Do you not want to change back? What about your childhood. And, why can&#39;t I just hold the stone if you don&#39;t even want to change back?&quot; Bill asked even more confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already had my childhood 40 years ago, so I&#39;m good for right now. As for the stone, it&#39;s safer with an adult than it is with a 2nd grader don&#39;t you agree?&quot; She rhetorically asked before letting go of Bill&#39;s hand and turning to walk away. &quot;Good luck with the 2nd grade &#39;Becky&#39;, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have some fun lessons, play tag at recess, or maybe even meet a boy or two.&quot; Kim teased before finally walking away.<br />
<br />
Bill just stood there dumfounded as he watched his former sister walk away. He couldn&#39;t believe that was even her. Kimberly always had terrible logic and was always rash, so Bill just couldn&#39;t believe this is how she&#39;d turn out. Bill snapped out of the shock and suddenly realized what was happening as he groaned. He had to go through a day in the 2nd grade again, as a freaking girl. Bill was determined to make it through the day as he forced himself to hold his head high as he walked in.<br />
<br />
Kim watched snickering as her and her &#39;sister&#39; drove off.<br />
&quot;Was Becky upset with going to school?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she was surprisingly, mature about it all.&quot; Kim secretly joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay that&#39;s good.&quot; Mary sighed. &quot;It&#39;s just, Becky is an only child so she can be a little, difficult sometimes.&quot; Mary explained.<br />
<br />
This was news to Kim&#39;s ears. She remembered her new past but a lot of the present was still a bit foggy to her. She smirked as she thought of the obvious answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, why don&#39;t you and Kyle... you know?&quot; Kim joked.<br />
<br />
Mary blushed as she dropped the subject and continued to drive. Kim just laughed as she played with the stone in her hand. </p>
