<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen woke the next morning rested, but not entirely refreshed. A good night&#39;s sleep had cleared her head enough to make room for her body&#39;s complaints. Her clever use of the curse to enhance her ability to enjoy the doggy life hadn&#39;t extended to some of yesterday&#39;s activities. Her jaw and tongue ached from all the extra work they had put in and her pussy felt tender and sensitive from the hours she had spent with the machine. She tried to get a look at her crotch to assess the damage and found that her thighs had become glued together by the fake cum that still coated them. She carefully peeled them apart and found that her lower lips were swollen and had turned a deep pink color, almost red. Yesterday&#39;s arousal dried on them like a glaze.<br />
<br />
She pulled herself carefully to her pads and took a look around. The lights had just come back on and many of the girls were waking. She heard several cut-off complaints and a good deal of rattling as the kennel doors were tested once more. Across the way, Jen saw Mina having the same problem with her own leftovers, but she seemed used to it and just popped her legs apart. A mutter and subsequent yelp behind her heralded the awakening of Emily.<br />
<br />
Jen turned and watched her sister try to stand upright. Emily struggled against the pads, trying to stretch her confined limbs. After a few swears and yelps of pain she gave up and stood on all fours. She saw Jen watching her and let out a passable growl and then winced as she expected the collar to shock her. She seemed a little surprised when it didn&#39;t. She growled louder and longer, but the collar remained inactive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Battery must&#39;ve die- FUCK!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily pawed at the collar as it shocked her again. Jen had the feeling that Betty had made it to shock you if you talked, but that any sound a dog would make wouldn&#39;t trigger it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning girls!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked out through the bars and saw Betty striding through the doors ahead of a column of trainers pushing the breakfast carts. Some of the women looked down the aisle of naked girls and blushed as they pushed their carts further down the room to the actual dogs. Jen had never seen so many trainers at once. She recognized only a few of their faces. Amelia must have hired more to cover the new program. Each one stopped in front of a kennel and took two bowls from the carts which they placed in front of the girls, removing muzzles as needed. Jen noted that none of the girls were turning their nose up at breakfast. The ones who had failed to eat last night had their reluctance tempered by hunger. Betty fed Jen, Emily, and Mina herself, removing Emily&#39;s muzzle and Mina&#39;s gag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eat up girls.&quot; She said. &quot;We have a big day ahead of us today.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jen and Emily ate, Jen&#39;s breakfast containing the fake cum again, Betty strode of down the line and began introducing the girls and their trainers. She gave the trainers little tips about the temperament of some of their charges and advice on how to best handle some of their quirks. Jen eavesdropped a bit and learned to her surprise that not all of the other girls were there entirely against their will. At least one or two of them had even begged their parents to send them! Jen marveled at how one little curse could cause so much change. If only Kyle could see what he had done.<br />
<br />
When all the girls had eaten they were leashed up, two to a trainer, and led out for their morning exercise in the play yard. Betty took Jen and Emily in one hand and Mina in the other. Emily tried to stay as far from Mina as possible, but this put her close to Jen which she also seemed to despise. Jen couldn&#39;t blame her sister for trying to avoid Mina. The redhead stank of both dog and sex. It was not an appealing combination. Mina sensed that there was someone else being lead along side her and tried to nuzzle Emily. Betty pulled her to the side and Jen graciously let Emily cross to the outside, away from the clearly horny Mina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about Mina.&quot; Betty said as they walked down the hall. &quot;After you left she became the center of attention and it went straight to her head. We tried to discipline her, but after a while that just seemed to spur her on more. She&#39;s a true masochist, through and through. I doubt we could even make her leave at this point. Amelia says she has a few ideas for her, but I&#39;ve all but given up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty lead them out into the yard and unleashed Jen and Emily, but tied Mina&#39;s leash to a ring set into the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I leave you to keep an eye on your sister, Jen?&quot; She asked. &quot;I need to help some of the other trainers with their charges. For some of them this is the first time handling a girl and I need to make sure they do it right. I&#39;ll give you permission to speak for now so you can help Emily out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded. Betty ruffled her hair and dashed off to help a trainer whose girls had managed to work together to tangle her in their leashes. Jen turned to Emily, but her sister had taken the chance to try and run for it again. The yard was surrounded on most sides by the building itself, and the open sides were covered by a tall fence. Emily had seen this and decided that the only realistic way out was back through the door. She had reared up to reach the knob, but the pads on her hands made it impossible to grip. Even if she could Jen knew it would be locked. The staff all wore wristbands with radio tags in them. The door would only unlock if one of them tried to open it. She let Emily make a few more futile attempts, then cleared her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t work.&quot; Jen said and paused.<br />
<br />
She was surprised by the clearness of her voice. She hadn&#39;t noticed it the day before. She&#39;d barely spoken much over the past week. She expected her voice to be hoarse like last time, but it was perfectly clear. Then she remembered the curse again. No matter how long you act like a dog you will be able to go back to acting like a human with no negative effects. That was part of the &quot;curse&quot; she had made Kyle give her. It made sense that it would keep her voice clear no matter how long she went without speaking.<br />
<br />
Emily gave up on the door. She turned towards Jen with murder in her eyes. Jen didn&#39;t flinch. She just did something that Emily couldn&#39;t do in her current state, and stood up. Emily struggled to match her, but the pads prevented it. She remained on all fours and glared up at her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily.&quot; Jen said calmly. &quot;If you want to get out of here then there is only one way: Graduation. The doors are all securely locked. The fences are all high and difficult to climb even without the pads. I&#39;m willing to bet that the collar and pads all have some kind of tracking device in them as well. I wouldn&#39;t put it past Betty to not think of that. Your only option is to stay and see this through. Now, you could do this the easy way, or the hard way. The hard way is painful and you will be thoroughly miserable by the time it&#39;s over. The easy way is following my lead and will be quick and maybe even fun. They won&#39;t do you any favors just because you&#39;re my sister. The choice is yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
She gazed impassively down at Emily. Emily glared right back up, but the some of the anger had given way to fear. Jen knelt down in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please just behave.&quot; She whispered. &quot;I&#39;ve been watching you since you got home from camp. You&#39;re... interested in this, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily growled and her expression hardened again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t give me that!&quot; Jen admonished. &quot;I saw the look on your face when you walked me and Rex yesterday. You want to try this too. Well, this is your chance. Put up with this for a month, and if you don&#39;t like it you can quit at the end and never look back. But you still have to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily looked down, defeated. Jen reached out and gave her head a light rub. Her sister didn&#39;t try to push her off or pull away, but she didn&#39;t show any signs of enjoying it either. It was a start. Jen could feel her shaking. Then she noticed that Emily had her thighs pressed tightly together.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Jen asked, worried. She really, *really* hoped that Emily wasn&#39;t getting turned on by this. That was just too much weirdness to handle in an already strange situation.<br />
<br />
Emily whined and looked at the door. Then she turned and scanned the yard before nodding pointedly in one direction. Jen turned and saw one of the regular dogs squatting to pee. She put two and two together, and decided one was the preferable answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to pee?&quot; She asked cautiously.<br />
<br />
Emily nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily looked at her quizzically, then in horror as she realized what Jen meant. Jen realized that she herself needed to go and she didn&#39;t want to sit around waiting for Emily to come to terms with her own conundrum. She trotted over to the trees, where most of the dogs did their business, and squatted. Emily watched in fascinated disgust as her sister pissed right into the grass in front of everyone in the yard. A few of the new trainers turned to stare, but most of them were used to this and just pointed Jen out to their trainees as an example of what was expected of them. Jen returned to Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;See.&quot; She said. &quot;It&#39;s easy. Just go over there, squat, and pee. It&#39;s what we&#39;re supposed to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sudden commotion off to one side drew their attention. One of the younger girls was crying. Jen briefly wondered why, then she saw the wet lines running down the girl&#39;s legs and into her kneepads. Betty was already on the scene, soothing the poor girl and unlocking her pads. One of the trainers ran over to the door and disappeared inside for a moment before returning with new pads. Betty wiped the poor girl down and helped her into the new set. Once they were locked into place she stood up and addressed the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is why you need to squat properly when urinating.&quot; She said. &quot;Don&#39;t hold it in until you cannot hold it any longer. That&#39;s a good way to not only ruin your pads, but also to get a UTI. You all saw Jen just now. Use her as an example.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of the girls, and some of the trainers, looked sheepish and embarrassed. Then one of the girls crawled forward. She was a blonde girl of about sixteen and wasn&#39;t wearing a muzzle. She moved to a spot a few feet from where Jen had gone and squatted down. The whole crowd held their breath as the girl seemed to struggle for a moment with some internal conflict. Then she started peeing. There were a few muttered comments from the watchers, all cut short with various noises of pain. When the girl had finished she looked up at Betty and smiled awkwardly. Betty beamed back and began clapping. The trainers all joined in and one or two of the girls gave a couple of quite claps before remembering themselves. The girl returned to her trainer, who gave her a treat.<br />
<br />
&quot;See.&quot; Jen said, turning back to Emily. &quot;Like I said. It&#39;s what we&#39;re supposed to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily still didn&#39;t look fully convinced. Jen could see that her sister was thinking hard, weighing her options. It was a look familiar to Jen. It usually preceded one of Emily&#39;s poorly-planned escapades that almost universally got her into trouble. Jen had a hunch what she was planning, but before she could give her a warning Betty spoke up and beat her to the punch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since I know some of you think you&#39;re quite clever,&quot; Betty called out, &quot;I should warn you that it&#39;s not that difficult for us to tell if you piss yourself on purpose and try to cry for sympathy to avoid doing things the right way. I was a Physician&#39;s Assistant at a psychiatric hospital before I got my veterinary degree and came to work here. I have seen it all and will not be fooled by crocodile tears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily deflated a bit. Jen could see a bit more of the rebel in her drain away. She decided to make one last push.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just go with it, Em.&quot; She pleaded. &quot;It&#39;s the easy way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of the other girls were peeing too now. A couple of them right up in front of the trees, but a few of them had crept off to the side, hoping to not be seen. One girl Jen&#39;s age was already being disciplined while her pads were swapped with clean ones. They could hear her grunts of pain as her collar did its job at her trainer&#39;s direction. Emily gave in. She crept over to the edge of the trees, away from the others, and squatted. A minute or two of silent concentration, A short burst of liquid, then she was done. She crawled back to Jen in shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl.&quot; Jen said sincerely.<br />
<br />
Emily glowered.<br />
<br />
The rest of the morning exercise time was spent coaxing the remaining girls to do their business, breaking up a few fights, and trying to get them to relax and play. Jen lead the charge and grabbed a knotted length of rope in her teeth. She tossed it around for a bit before being joined by the blonde. The tag on the girl&#39;s collar said &quot;Missie.&quot; Jen almost laughed. It was such a dog name. Missie observed Jen for a moment, then pounced forward and grabbed the frayed end of the rope toy with her own mouth. Jen got the message immediately and started pulling. The other girl growled with glee and pulled back.<br />
<br />
The two struggled happily with each other for a few minutes before Missie let go. She worked her jaw a couple of times, then jumped back in. She didn&#39;t last as long the second time before she lost her grip. Jen had played this game with the real dogs last time she was at Chesterton. Her jaw muscles were more used to it. Missie was still new. It would be some time before she built up enough strength to really compete.<br />
<br />
A couple of the other girls joined in as well. Jen assumed that these were among the ones who had wanted to be here. When the real dogs were brought out to join in Jen showed the girls how to really play. Games of tug-of-war and chase broke out spontaneously. A couple of trainers even started throwing balls. None of the girls could possibly keep up with a real dog, so though they readily chased, they rarely ever returned with the prize.<br />
<br />
All too soon playtime was over. Amelia came out and called all the trainers and girls for class. Jen went over to join Mina in the corner near the door. Betty had taken her leash off and was using a remote to direct the redhead through various different exercises. Since Mina wasn&#39;t making any pained noises, Jen assumed that the remote was connected to her headphones. Emily, who hadn&#39;t joined in with Jen and the others in playing, was watching in fascination. Amelia also came over while the trainers got there girls together and leashed up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Betty, I&#39;ll be taking Jen today. I feel that she needs a bit of time to ease into the special training and I would also like to use her as an aid in class today. I&#39;m thinking that since she&#39;s so well behaved we could just have her do special training every other day and assisting in class otherwise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; Betty said in annoyance. &quot;It&#39;s going to mess up my data having her off and on like that. Continuous daily sessions would be best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Amelia said, &quot;But Jen is just too useful to waste. I have a few other prospects for special training coming in this afternoon. They should be more than enough for you to get the data you desire. Just think of Jen as more of a control for your little experiment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Betty sighed. &quot;But these &#39;prospects&#39; of yours better be good. Jen is one in a million. She won&#39;t be easy to replace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia leashed up Jen and Emily and lead them ahead of the column of other students and their trainers to the classroom. The class was different from what Jen had experienced. For one thing, there were no real dogs present. Amelia explained that to start out they would be training on their own and would join the regular training class in a week or two when she felt they were ready.<br />
<br />
The trainers lined the girls up in rows just like the real dogs had been. Jen finally managed to get a head count now that they weren&#39;t all in a crowd trying to hide behind each other. 26, not counting herself and Emily. About a dozen of them didn&#39;t seem at all happy to be there. Most of those wore muzzles. Nine looked resigned, like they knew that there was no choice but to go along and get it all over with. Only one of this group had a muzzle on, and she looked like she regretted it. The other five were trying to look like they didn&#39;t care, but Jen could see their excitement bleeding through. Missie was the exception in this group. She sat right up front with a look of pure joy on her face.<br />
<br />
Amelia went through an introductory lecture with them. Something that had been completely unnecessary with Jen&#39;s previous class. She laid out the course curriculum and what her expectations of them were. She then had Jen run through a demonstration of all the things she had learned before using verbal commands, hand signs, and clicker. Then she turned to the class and asked if anyone would like to come up and try a few basic commands themselves. Missie&#39;s gloved hand shot up, then immediately dropped again as she grunted in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;My apologies, but that was a trick question.&quot; Amelia said coolly while Missie collected herself. &quot;From here on out there will be no human behaviors from any of you unless you have been given direct permission. For the next month we expect you to act just like the dogs we normally train here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Missie had a hurt look on her face and tears in her eyes as she sat at attention again. Amelia ruffled her blonde hair affectionately before stepping back to the front of the class. She turned to face them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Missie, come.&quot; She said with authority.<br />
<br />
Missie hesitantly crawled forward until she was directly in front of Amelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Missie sat as best she could with her legs bent back to either side and her hands planted in front for balance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beg.&quot;<br />
<br />
Missie lifted both hands and waved them up and down in front of her. Just like a begging dog. A few sniggers were abruptly cut short in the audience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Missie put her hand in Amelia&#39;s and let it be moved up and down a few times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Missie hesitated for a moment, trying to figure out what the vague, one-word command meant. Then she hunkered down on her belly. This seemed to satisfy Amelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roll over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Missie happily rolled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Missie returned to her seated position in front of Amelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl.&quot; Amelia said, and gave her a treat. She turned to the class again. &quot;I expect all of you to be able to follow simple commands like these by this time next week.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of the class was spent goading the girls into obeying the basic commands. Jen was lead around several times to demonstrate for some of the more reluctant students. By lunch time they had all either given in and at least halfheartedly attempted to follow along, or they were crying from the pain of the repeated shocks they had been given. There were still a few holdouts among the tougher girls who had been enrolled as punishment for delinquent behavior, but even they were couldn&#39;t hide the cracks in their determination.<br />
<br />
Lunch was rather quiet. Jen got a bowl of fake cum instead of the lunch feed that Emily got. Amber delivered it personally.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it&#39;s not as good this way.&quot; The chef explained. &quot;But Betty wants you to keep a regular diet, even on days your not attending the special class. Besides, I have so many variants that I want you to try and this is the best opportunity to get feedback. Today I tried adding just a dash of MSG. I have a feeling it might make it taste closer to the other way.&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t, but it was still tasty. Jen gulped it down while Emily watched in disgust. Amber watched her intently, crouched down just outside the bars. Jen noticed that she had dark circles under her eyes and her hair looked unwashed. She looked as if she&#39;d just pulled an all-nighter. When both girls had finished she took the bowls, and Jen&#39;s critique, and left with the lunch cart as the trainers returned to take them out to the yard again.</p>
