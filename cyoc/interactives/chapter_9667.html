<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian and Peter happened to be working the same shift on the same day at the grocery store. Peter was outside having fun, doing the job while using his power to help him out. He was always happy and upbeat, and he was never feeling tired. Brian, on the other hand, was having a bad day. <br />
<br />
Brian dropped several bags of groceries from a cart, causing a customer to be very unhappy with him. He couldn’t find the mop anywhere, he got tired running around the parking lot to get the carts, and he stocked some of the canned foods in the wrong aisle and had to move them all to another place. On top of that, he got two bad grades in school and he saw his friend while he was talking to a girl, making Brian feel sad and lonely, since his best friend didn’t have time to talk to him.<br />
<br />
Peter decided to walk home with Brian after work. He noticed that his friend was feeling really down and depressed, and he wanted to see if he could cheer him up. Peter was able to read Brian’s mind and he saw that his friend had a long, bad day. He had compassion for Brian, and so he offered to walk home with him.<br />
<br />
When they arrived at Brian’s house, Brian got him and his guest something to drink while Peter turned on the TV and sat down in his recliner chair. Brian was still sad, and he showed it by the expression on his face.<br />
<br />
“Peter, you know what?” Brian asked him.<br />
<br />
“What’s that, amigo?” the athletic teen replied, while pressing the buttons on the remote.<br />
<br />
“I would just love to shrink to nothing by you! It would make me feel so much better!” Brian said then. Peter stared at him for a moment. At first, he thought Brian couldn’t be serious.<br />
<br />
“Peter…” Brian whispered.<br />
<br />
“Hey…” Peter replied, as he was watching TV.<br />
<br />
“Peter, I know you can do this to me…”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about?” Peter wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Everybody at school and at work knows about ‘Peter’s power’ so don’t act like you don’t know… Please, help me…” Brian pleaded. Peter turned around and realized that Brian really meant what he was saying. Brian then stood up and walked right in front of Peter.<br />
<br />
“I want to know what it feels like to grow to nothing before you… I think that’s so hot…” Peter just looked up.<br />
<br />
“Come on Brian… Are you serious? You want me to shrink you to nothing?” Peter replied.<br />
<br />
‘Please, Peter. I’ve had a lousy day, and this would just make me feel so much better!” Brian replied, looking at Peter with a sad look on his face. He was almost begging Peter to shrink him. Then Peter stood up. Peter was just 3 inches taller than Brian, who stood exactly 6 feet tall.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Brian. You asked for it…” Peter said, with a deep sigh. He stared at Brian for a moment, allowing his power to take full control of his friend’s mind and his body. Then a sudden jolt went through Brian’s body, like he had received an electric shock. Immediately he began to lose height, for it seemed like the room, the furniture, and Peter were suddenly growing rapidly.<br />
<br />
Brian smiled as he looked up to Peter, who now appeared to be even taller than before. But Peter wasn’t growing, Brian was shrinking. Brian was now 5’8” and losing height fast. His pants were getting loose and his shirt was now a whole size too big. His underwear was not as tight anymore, and his shoes did not fit so tight anymore either.<br />
<br />
Then Brian passed 5’3”, he looked up at Peter, who now towered a foot taller than him. He smiled as he became aroused, his endowment enjoying the sinking feeling that came along with the size reduction, which his entire body was experiencing. Brian laughed, as everything around him continued to grow.<br />
<br />
As Brian dwindled down to 4’7” he remembered the last time he was this tall, which was when he was about 11 years old or so. He continued to look up at Peter with a smile. Peter just appeared to be growing taller and taller, as the shrinking continued. His shirt seemed to be getting bigger while his slacks were getting all wrinkled up around his shrinking legs.<br />
<br />
When Brian reached 4’2” he had now become so small, that his underwear and pants had fallen from his waist as if they were many sizes too big for the teen who now resembled a little kid. But Peter didn’t see anything, because Brian’s sweater was hanging over his shorter body and it was almost reaching the floor.<br />
<br />
When Brian dwindled further down to 3 feet, his body was just covered by his oversized sweater. But his shoulders were getting smaller and smaller, and soon the hole in the sweater would be wider than the width of his shoulders! Brian loved the feeling of shrinking, as he looked straight ahead and found himself staring at Peter’s legs. He looked up and realized that he was now half as tall as Peter.<br />
<br />
At 2 feet, Brian was now so small, that he was staring at Peter’s knees. He had completely outgrown the sweater, which had now dropped down on the floor, because the small boy’s shoulders weren’t wide enough to hold it up any longer. He was standing in a pile of clothing that was too large for him, although it had fit him just a few minutes earlier. Brian looked down and realized how small he had become. His arms, hands, and legs were approaching the size of that of a baby, as he was dwindling below the 2 foot mark.<br />
<br />
Within seconds, Brian was now a tiny, 1-foot-tall human being. He was the size of an action figure, and looked up at Peter. Peter would have been a 36-foot giant by now, but he wasn’t. Peter was now over 5 feet taller than Brian, who made him seem like a giant to him. Brian was now staring at Peter’s ankles, as the room kept on growing. Brian stared out the giant before him, and noticed that the legs kept on growing. He was now looking at a pair of giant socks, which were tucked into these humungeous basketball shoes. The shoes kept on growing at a rapid pace.<br />
<br />
The smaller Brian became, the faster he seemed to shrink. He was about 6 inches tall, and staring at the top of Peter’s giant basketball shoes. When he looked up, it seemed like Peter’s body stood there like a skyscraper. He was staring at some human building, which appeared to be growing rapidly. <br />
<br />
The height of 6 inches came down to 3 inches, and the whole world just seemed like a titanic place. The carpet under his feet felt thick and long, as all he could see before him were the giant laces on Peter’s basketball shoes. He quickly crawled through a hole under the pile of clothing so he could see the new environment around him. It was fantastic, he felt as if he was on a different planet!<br />
<br />
Brian’s height was cut in half again, and now he stood about 1.5 inches tall. He was tiny and naked. He was no taller than a match, and he found himself staring at a huge mass of rubber, which was the tip of Peter’s giant shoes. Brian gasped as he tilted his head upwards. Peter’s body seemed to be going on without end. He seemed endlessly tall, and Brian couldn’t even see Peter’s face anymore. Peter looked down and became teary-eyed, as he witnessed his classmate and coworker while he slowly disappeared from this human existance. Why did Brian make him do this? Peter felt sad, in a way. He decided right away that he would grow him back.<br />
<br />
Peter could not even tell that Brian was waving at him, as if he was waving goodbye. Peter felt as if he was losing a friend. He had the power to make the shrinking permanent, and then Brian’s existance would be wiped off the face of the earth. But did Brian really want him to do that?<br />
<br />
Brian stood now 0.7 inches tall. To Peter, Brian was now like miniature figure. Peter was almost too scared to move, out of fear that he would step on his friend. Tears rolled from Peter’s eyes, as Brian slowly disappeared from his sight. Brian was now 0.3 inches… then 0.2 inches… then 0.1 inches… and then, all that was left of bRian, was now gone.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Peter felt overcome with guilt. What if anyone came looking for Brian? What if they asked about Brian at school? Peter looked down and saw a pile of clothing on the carpet. But Brian was now reduced to a speck of dust, and he was still shrinking. Peter stepped back and sat back down on the recliner, wondering what to do next. Would he be held responsible for killing Brian? Then he remembered that Brian had asked him to do this. Peter closed his eyes. His eyes were no good to him in this situation. Brian was too small to be seen. But Peter could still make mental contact with him.<br />
<br />
“Brian… how are you doing? How are you feeling?” Peter wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Oh man, this is great!” Brian cheered. Peter picked up on Brian through his psychic powers. He smiled, for he was relieved to know that his buddy was still alive.<br />
<br />
“Are you ready to grow back to six feet?” Peter asked him next.<br />
<br />
“Oh no! Give me a few minutes as I explore this world… I’m walking around the jungle, which is the carpet. What a magnificent view!” Brian replied.<br />
<br />
“If I don’t grow you back, then I’m coming after you and I’ll shrink myself down to your size! I’ll give you five minutes!” Peter ordered.<br />
<br />
Five minutes went by. Peter began to feel scared. He was alone in this house, knowing that his friend was crawling around somewhere, about the size of a speck of dust. He got nervous, and decided that it was time for Brian to grow back.<br />
<br />
“Alright Brian, I’m going to make you grow…” he said out loud. <br />
<br />
“Please! Just an inch, Peter!” Brian responded. Peter was dead tired and felt like he was dozing off. He then made Brian grow to just an inch in height, before he fell asleep while sitting in Brian’s comfortable recliner chair. Hours went by. Peter suddenly woke up with a jolt! Where was Brian? He tilted his head and looked down. And then there it was, the one-inch tall naked human being, sound asleep on Peter’s giant chest. The little Brian managed to climb on the chair and to crawl over Peter’s body, until he fell asleep. Peter tried to remain as still as possible and couldn’t help but smile, when he saw the tiny man sleeping on top of his chest. Brian was still alive.</p>
