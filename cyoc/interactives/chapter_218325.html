<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What to wish for next…  That’s a good question.”  Radley said, stroking his chin, as his genie floated over his head.<br />
<br />
Tini was internally tapping her foot, drumming her fingers on the table, and otherwise feeling impatient.  Sure, she could wait multiple millennia to make her mischievous moves, but that didn’t mean she liked waiting.  The brief bursts of carnal chaos and depraved desire never seemed to last long enough to make up all the sitting around in between.  When Radley had rubbed her lamp, she’d thought she’d struck gold this cycle; human boys, in their teenage years, were supposed to be the species’ poster child for thinking with their dicks when they thought at all.<br />
<br />
And here he was, not only taking his time thinking over his next wish.  He didn’t even seem to be ogling the results of his last wish that much.<br />
<br />
Had loosening the entire country’s stance on nudity been too much too soon?  It was always a difficult balancing act.  Her wish’s twists were primarily for her own amusement, yes, but she needed her masters and mistresses to enjoy the results as well.  Or at least not find them so objectionable that they’d throw out the bottle and force her to wait for a new owner.<br />
<br />
She’d learned that the hard way, after granting a wish for supreme wealth by giving that master’s mother the title of “world’s most successful prostitute.”<br />
<br />
Sure, she could just change people, or whole worlds, on her own. But letting someone else take the lead added some much-needed variety to her life.  And let her indulge her submission kink by calling creatures infinitely weaker than her “master” or “mistress.”  So naturally, she wanted her time with each master to be as long and wish-filled as possible.<br />
<br />
She was debating whether giving her (doubtlessly overthinking) Master suggestions would speed up his next wish, or make him too paranoid to wish again, when he finally spoke up.<br />
<br />
“I think I’ll use the next wish on James.”<br />
<br />
“That sounds like a great idea!”  Haley said.  “James’s always gotten the worst of the bullying.  He deserves to have something nice happen to him, for once.”<br />
<br />
“I’m down, Master,” Tini chimed in.  “So, what’ll your wish for this James be?  Protection from bullying?  A luckier love life?  A makeover like yours?”<br />
<br />
“Something like that,” Radley said, pausing one more time, probably to think over his wording, if Tini had to guess.  “I wish that James Hart would become his ideal self.”<br />
<br />
“And that you’d get to see the change happen, right?”  Tini floated up alongside him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that’d be great.”  Radley nodded.<br />
<br />
“As you wish, Master!”  Tini snapped her fingers, teleporting all three of them out of the house.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
James put down the pen as he finished the last of his homework.  The short, skinny young man, turned his focus to his computer, where he started browsing furry art sites.  But he wasn’t paying attention to the dozens of dragons, dogs, cats, or foxes.  No, what interested him were the more robotic creatures.<br />
<br />
He supposed it made him seem a bit stereotypical, given the traits people bullied him over, (how he often took things literally, had trouble picking up other’s emotions, or showing emotions the same ways other did, among other things,) but he didn’t care.  He liked robots, humanoid robots with animal features particularly, and he wasn’t going to let being seen as a stereotype get in the way of his enjoyment.  <br />
<br />
He envied the precision and tirelessness of machines, the way they could go for hours doing tasks humans would find impossible, without getting hungry, or sweaty, how they could be upgraded or, for more modular types, rebuilt to handle new challenges, and how they wouldn’t have to wrestle with foolish, irrational instincts.  Plus, he liked the aesthetic.<br />
<br />
As he continued browsing, he heard a knock at his door.<br />
<br />
“Come in,” James said, minimizing the window and glancing over his shoulder.  He raised an eyebrow when rather than his parents or brother, he saw Radley, and a fox girl standing in the doorway. He was about to raise his voice to ask where she came from, and what she was, when another thought dropped into his mind.<br />
<br />
<I>The fox girl’s existence is perfectly normal, and not worth questioning.  People occasionally spontaneously transforming is a rare but natural occurrence, and not worth thinking about. </I><br />
<br />
So, realizing that fox girls were perfectly normal, and not worth questioning, he took the conversation a different direction.<br />
<br />
“Uh, hello…”  He mumbled, his eyes focused on the fox girl.  “Radley, if you’re gonna drop by, I’d like to know ahead of time.   Lets me prepare.  Also, who is she?”  <br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Radley said, “I didn’t think I’d get here this quickly.  And this is Haley Beckler.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Well, you got a real lucky change.  Looks almost like your fursona, ‘cept for the extra breasts.”<br />
<br />
“Yep!”  Haley said, smiling.  “And guess what, you’re next!”<br />
<br />
“Sounds like my que,” came another voice.  James startled when a short blue-skinned girl with horns appeared in front of him in a puff of blue smoke.  “Yeah, you’re definitely in need of an upgrade, and I’ve got just the thing!”<br />
<br />
“R-Radley, who- ah- what is- this?”<br />
<br />
James was forced into standing upright, his body feeling rigid and stiff.  Hair all over his body began to vanish, as his skin became smooth plastic, splitting off into segmented panels.  Underneath the skin, he felt a chill in his back.  Starting with his spine, each bone in his body shifted to cold metal, the material surprisingly light for how sturdy it was.  <br />
<br />
“She’s Tini, an imp genie I’d found earlier today.”<br />
<br />
“What’s she doing to me?”  James stammered.  There were too many new people here and even if spontaneous transformation was perfectly normal, he had trouble handling sudden changes of any kind in his life, much less his body.<br />
<br />
“Just granting my Master’s wish for you to become your ideal self…”  She said with a dismissive hand wave.  “With a little bonus from me.”<br />
<br />
It spread out over his rib cage, and he felt as if a jolt of electricity had shot through his body.  Beneath his plastic skin, the blood in his veins and arteries were shifting to copper wiring, the veins themselves wrapped in plastic.  His breathing halted, and he panicked, feeling as if his lungs were collapsing, then twisting.  But a second later he felt as if he had no need to breath at all, his lungs having completely become a pair of cooling fans.  His rapidly beating heart continued to vibrate, revving like an engine as it became a bulky, metal motor.  He staggered, feeling incredibly heavy as all the major organs in his torso were quickly changed into mechanical counterparts.<br />
<br />
James took a moment to metaphorically catch his breath, the literal meaning of the phrase no longer relevant to him.  <br />
<br />
“Radley,” James said, his voice sounding increasingly artificial. “I…  Uh, I appreciate that on finding a genie, you would use a wish for me…”  He wanted to go on, but the sudden expanding of his jaws into a wide, vaguely lizard-like snout interrupted him.  With an internal sigh, he accepted it would probably be better not to make a fuss at a friend trying to do something nice just because he did it unannounced.  Plus, it did seem like the genie was genuinely turning him into some kind of robot, there were no signs of any malicious tricks so far.   He turned and looked at his mirror.<br />
<br />
Surprise or not, he did like what he was seeing.<br />
<br />
His throat sealed up, the back of his mouth becoming a speaker, while four little little plastic triangles grew at the ends of his new snout to give the impression of teeth.  His ears and hair completely receded, though his new audio recording modules ensured he could still hear.  His feet arched up in an imitation of a digitigrade stance, toes elongating to look like lizard claws, while his legs became covered in the same plastic that had covered his torso and much of his head, and his arms followed not long after.<br />
<br />
Feeling a pressure in his spine, James had a good guess as to what was coming next.  He removed his pants with some reluctance (nudity might not have been a big taboo, but he still felt more comfortable with clothes, and watched a hole in his lower back opened up and a thick, segmented mechanical tail extended from it.  He giddily swung it around, enjoying the sensations of the new limb.<br />
<br />
His eyes began to shrink, and turn glassy, becoming a pair of tiny, but incredibly sharp cameras located just above his snout.  Where his eyes had once been, a small black screen appeared, looking like a visor.  Two points on the screen lit up green, resembling blinking eyes, purely for emoting and aesthetic purposes.  Meanwhile, a layer of green paint was applied over much of the plain white plastic that formed his outer shell, though a few lines of white were left on his sides, arms, and legs, to accent the green.<br />
<br />
As James felt his brain shifting into an elaborate series of processors, he began to realize each of his body’s new functions: Wi-Fi access, (with incredibly potent antivirus software,) holographic displays, surprisingly high strength, solar-charging batteries more effective than anything on the market, flawless memory, and mathematical abilities that would put even his former straight-A skills in the subject to shame.  Not only that, his thinking felt clear and uninhibited., but he still felt very much like himself.  All that on top of not needing to feel hungry, or tired, or experience the distracting urges of…<br />
<br />
He looked down, and noticed one part still hadn’t changed yet.<br />
<br />
Tini grinned and leisurely stretched in mid air.  “And now, for the sexy twist.”  <br />
<br />
She snapped her fingers, and James let out a loud, synthesized moan, shuddering as his penis began to swell, the skin turning to a strange, translucent, flexible material as green liquid began to pump into it, reaching ten inches before becoming solid.  The desire to touch, or use his new tool in some way was growing just as much.  He involuntarily found himself making panting noises, and dropping his jaw to mimic how a living creature would feel experiencing such pleasure would.<br />
<br />
“Man, look at this guy!”  She doubled over in laughter.  “His ass can’t handle all the pleasure he’s getting.”<br />
<br />
James took a second to register she wasn’t speaking literally, but he’d been dealing with that long enough that he’d learned ways to make that confusion less obvious to others.<br />
<br />
“Ye-yeah, it can’t.”  James said, straightening up and getting back in control of himself.  “Thankfully, the rest of me can handle it fine.”<br />
<br />
Tini snorted, and floated over to him “Ha!  And he’s funny, too.  I can see why Radley’d be friends with you!”  She put an arm around his neck, which he delicately grabbed, and moved away.<br />
<br />
“Please don’t touch me without asking,” he mumbled.<br />
<br />
“Sorry about that!”  Radley said.  “Tini’s better about giving you what you actually wish for than most genies you hear about in stories, but she tends to make pervy twists, instead.”<br />
<br />
“I… see.”  James nodded.  Knowing Radley wasn’t to blame for his embarrassment, (at least, not directly,) was comforting to him.  And, thinking of other things he&#39;d seen online, James considered he’d still probably dodged a bullet. &quot;I... thank you, Tini, for not making me a mindless buxom &#39;love-bot&#39;.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah because that is SOOOO original. Okay. I don&#39;t object to the classics. Like at all. But ask any video game designer, even if it&#39;s something you love, if you do the exact same thing over and over, you eventually wanna scream. Variety is the spice of life.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Uh, thank you for using a wish to get me this cool robot body!  I really do like it!”<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome,” said Radley.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s a really great look for you,” said Haley.<br />
<br />
“You really didn’t have to.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I do get unlimited wishes from her,” Radley said.  “So it’s not like I’m wasting them.”<br />
<br />
“U-unlimited wishes?”  James’s “eyes” changed to a pair of exclamation marks.  “Even with the sexualized twists, that sounds incredible!  What have you done with them so far?  What do you plan to do?”<br />
<br />
“I’m still deciding on the second one,” Radley said, his eyes drifting towards James’ crotch with a look James recognized as discomfort.  “As for the first, I gave myself a body upgrade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so? Did you give yourself superpowers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, not yet, I just made myself handsome. I didn&#39;t look this way before.&quot;<br />
<br />
James found that a bit jarring to learn Radley&#39;s wish had already retconned reality. &quot;What did you look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Total wimp. As for my other wishes, I wished for Haley to be her fursona.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you caused the spontaneous transformations to change her in her favor, that&#39;s very nice of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s one of the good guys, of course it was nice of him.&quot; Haley said calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;But isn&#39;t being the good guy dependent on one&#39;s actions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If they weren&#39;t good, then he wouldn&#39;t be Radley.&quot;<br />
<br />
James&#39; visor blinked a few times.  &quot;Uh, okay?&quot;  He looked back at Radley, who was still awkwardly attempting to avert his eyes.  &quot;I, uh...  I should probably look into getting some new pants modified to fit the tail...  Plus some er... extra space in the front.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, don&#39;t want to show off the new bod?&quot;  Tini asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not particularly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tini said, &quot;Come on, you&#39;ve got something great and new, don&#39;t you wanna show it off? It&#39;s not like anyone is gonna judge you for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not about me, if Radley is uncomfortable, I want to try to oblige him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why bother? Nudity&#39;s not a big taboo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it isn&#39;t, but since Radley wished this new body for me. I should let him be comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Radley was evidentially tired of going in circles. &quot;Tini, I wish that you&#39;d create clothes for James that he&#39;d be comfortable with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish Master.&quot; Tini said. In a flash of magic, James was wearing a speedo. James had heard that scantly clothes was usually seen as more sexual than nudism.  If Radley’s face was anything to go by, he seemed to agree. He looked at Tini. She shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lewd twist to any wish remember? You wished for clothes he&#39;d be comfortable with.  He doesn&#39;t suffer from the elements, he just wanted to carter to you not wanting to look at his robo-staff. So problems solved.&quot;<br />
<br />
James said, &quot;Will this do for now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For now.&quot; Radley surrendered. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you planning to wish for next? You said you have infinite wishes. You could change the world. The sexualization clause isn&#39;t that bad if you account for it. If you make your wish in a way that INCLUDES sexualization to begin with, then the wish will already be sexualized.... Hm. Unless that&#39;ll just make the wish become MORE sexualized.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, half the fun is watching my masters figure out this stuff out.&quot; Tini said, lazily reclining on thin air again. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... haven&#39;t really thought about it. Tini said she&#39;s watched countless masters create lewd utopias and dystopias, and then moves onto a new universe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tini turned over on her belly. &quot;And believe it or not. It&#39;s the dystopias that are more boring. Buncha miserable jerks being awful to each other. If I wanted to watch that I&#39;d be in a front row seat in Hell. You can only watch Hitler and Pol Pot stab each other to death so many times.”<br />
<br />
Haley raised her hand. &quot;Can I make a suggestion? Lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t eat.&quot; James said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can go out with us, for the social experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I supposed it would be something to get your minds off the subject and come back to it with a fresh perspective.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lunch works for me,&quot; Radley said.</p>
