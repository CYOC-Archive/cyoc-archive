<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The lunch venue was an out of the way diner on the way home, and by the time they got there, Jeff&#39;s delirium from Brianna&#39;s cinema-teasing had begun to ease off. Unfortunately, once they were inside and at a table, he felt another urge building. He&#39;d only had a couple of sips of Brianna&#39;s soda during the movie, but that was on top of breakfast several hours ago. Excusing himself, he told her to order something for both of them -- she knew him well enough now to choose something he&#39;d probably like -- and took off to the diner&#39;s restroom.<br />
<br />
Once inside the door, he paused a second, taking a breath and getting his bearings. Brianna&#39;s covert fondling had bordered on outright masturbation and her boldness had surprised him. It was also uncomfortably exciting, and he glanced downwards to visually confirm it. Sure enough, the crotch-breast&#39;s bump was a little larger, and Jeff could feel his pants were slightly tighter from the arousal&#39;s swelling. Yet that was countered by the gentle pressure of needing to pee, and although he had discovered over the last couple of weeks that its function worked almost exactly the same as his old penis -- his body wouldn&#39;t let him do both acts at once -- Jeff knew he had to take care of his bladder first.<br />
<br />
There was a small problem.<br />
<br />
The bathroom stalls were in use, the doors shut, both of them occupied.<br />
<br />
Fuck!<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t hang around to wait, and he needed to go.<br />
<br />
There was only one solution.<br />
<br />
Jeff walked quickly to the last of three individual urinals, to take the one nearest the corner. He&#39;d just have to be quick, he told himself. His heart hammering, nerves flaring, he stood as close as was practical, lowered his fly, and tugged the bra-cup down. It jiggled momentarily from being freed, and he wrapped his hands around the base, trying to stay calm and relax his groin.<br />
<br />
Quickly and quietly, he told himself, repeating it in his mind. Quickly and quietly, and nobody will see me.<br />
<br />
The relief was both physical and psychological as the jet of pee burst from him, and Jeff began to drain himself as rapidly as his body would allow. Hands squeezing, milking, eyes darting to the restroom&#39;s entry every other second, he felt the liquid leaving. Half done, two thirds, three quarters--<br />
<br />
The stall door behind him opened, the toilet flushing, and the occupant walked by to the sink. Swallowing, his anxiety exploding, he stared straight ahead and down, locked onto the freakishly-placed mass, urine pouring out from the impossible not-meant-to-be-there female nipple. No reason to look at me, nothing to see. Just a regular guy with a regular male penis, peeing like a man, in the men&#39;s restroom. Like a prayer, he repeated the words in his head, fixed on the flow as it finally subsided and turned to a dribble, and simultaneously, the sound of the patron turning off the sink tap, then heading to the door, stopping only for a second to dry hand his hands before leaving.<br />
<br />
Wiping himself down, Jeff stuffed the breast back into his pants and hauled the bra into place, before blitzing through cleaning his own hands and exiting the room. His legs felt weak as he returned back through the diner, fairly quiet for the time of day, and slumped into the booth&#39;s seat opposite Brianna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; She greeted him, then her expression changed. &quot;Something happen? You look kinda pale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, the stalls were full, so I had to use the urinal.&quot; He sighed, finally able to properly relax. &quot;I, uh- ... I thought this guy was gonna notice when he went to wash his hands. It was ... scary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww.&quot; She frowned and bit her lip. &quot;He didn&#39;t though, right? I don&#39;t want to have to kick some douchebag&#39;s ass for giving you shit for being the way you are.&quot; Her concern lightened, and the frown turned up into her trademark coy smile. &quot;The only one allowed to tease you is me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; he snickered, relieved but still kinda highly strung. &quot;I&#39;ve noticed.&quot; Jeff pointed to the menu. &quot;Um, what did you order us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before she could say anything, a waitress appeared next to their table, unloading two freshly made bbq-bacon burgers, with fries and shakes, onto it. With a smile and the wish of a pleasant meal, she was gone and Brianna gestured theatrically to it. &quot;This! The server said they had two nearly ready to go &#39;cause somebody else cancelled an order. So, voila! Instant meal, no wait time! Their loss, our gain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perfect! With no fanfare, they both began to dig in. The fries were fresh, golden and crunchy, and the meat grilled just right -- Jeff wasn&#39;t about to complain about somebody else&#39;s change of heart when it was so convenient and delicious. Brianna was hungrier than him, wolfing hers down surprisingly fast, while he took his time, enjoying the flavour and the bacony goodness. She was more than halfway done with her fries when he finally finished his burger, but then Jeff noticed she was leaning back in her seat, gazing at him with a serene look.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s u-&quot;<br />
<br />
His question was cut off by the shock sensation of something pressing into his groin under the table. Brianna&#39;s sock-clad foot slid up the side of his crotch protrusion, against the left thigh, before brushing across the front to the other side, and then back to the centre. She began to knead him, breast-flesh compressing, the flat of her sole gliding over the material. The friction between her foot and his groin was in triplicate -- sock, pants, bra -- and the layers of fabric rubbing over each other and around his skin had a kind of stacking effect, a reinforcing tactile insanity that he wasn&#39;t prepared for. Jeff was reminded again how sensitive he was down there, how soft and feminine his nether regions were, but ... also how addictive the attention was.<br />
<br />
The anticipation of each motion was matched only by the shameful enjoyment that picked up right where the cinema&#39;s fondling had left off. He could feel the gentle sloshing of liquid as his breast smushed and squished against her foot, then a blip of electricity as a toe pressed against the nipple, denting it inward, before releasing to let it pop out again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bri-Bri, I- ... I, um, h- ... y-you-&quot; He tried to speak but his attempt trailed off into grunts, her foot running in circles around him, before she slid it back to grip the nipple again between two toes, pulling it upward. Jeff huffed, unable to form words, and the crotch of his pants pushed outward in swollen defiance of everything prior, tightening even more. He could feel droplets of milk leaking out, even as he spread his legs automatically, completely against his better judgement, but that only encouraged her. Given more surface area, Brianna&#39;s footjob roamed further around the bloating sides, top and bottom, leaving no piece of fatty tissue untouched. Heel, arch, toes; she used all of it, the angle and pressure constantly changing.<br />
<br />
At the same time, above the table, Brianna was the very image of a girl having a late lunch with her boyfriend, and she smiled innocently at his reddened expression, before delicately putting the straw in her mouth and taking a long pull on her shake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there, how was your meal?&quot; The waitress rematerialised like a ghost sent to torment Jeff with the worst possible timing. &quot;Anything else I can get you? Drink refill? Another side?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thankfully Brianna deliberately took the waitress&#39; attention to save him from answering, though her ministrations underneath the table didn&#39;t stop for a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it was great! I haven&#39;t eaten here in forever. Maybe we can get something sweet to go? Can you recommend anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely!&quot; She began to go down the dessert section of the menu, giving her memorised spiel on each item, while Brianna covertly winked at Jeff and pretended to pay attention. For the next minute he sat, mortified, as his pants tightened further and further, her foot endlessly rubbing and pressing, doing laps, before the waitress finished. Brianna feigned thinking about it and then politely declined, thanking the waitress, who nodded and smiled, scooped up their used plates and utensils, and vanished away again. Finally, mercifully, she got up to pay the bill at the counter, winking once more as she went by. His miserable wonderful embarrassment subsided, but before he could bring himself back to coherent thoughts, she was next to him again, pulling him up out of his seat by a hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, carry my jacket.&quot; She grinned knowingly, clearly enjoying every second of what was happening, and shoved it into his free hand, directly in front of his crotch. Like the proverbial &#39;erection disguise&#39;, he held it there, and as she led him outside, he was mentally catapulted back to his park trip, several weeks ago. Except, this time it was a ridiculous over-abundance of milk instead, and without the too-small bra holding everything in, each step was the opposite type of torture. Jeff&#39;s torment couldn&#39;t be seen beneath the jacket, and he didn&#39;t want to chance a glimpse to find out, but he could feel just how horrifically distended it was. It felt like his groin was wedged into his clothing, and that if he moved the wrong way, a seam would rip and his pants would split open.<br />
<br />
If it had been his penis, in the current situation, his addled mind imagined it would be a foot long and thick enough to belong to a horse.<br />
<br />
Jeff spent most of their journey back concentrating on the surroundings, trying to keep his breathing even and his face from looking like a tomato. Unfortunately, each motion of his legs caused contact between the taut fabric and his flesh, and by the time they reached his house he was barely holding it together, somehow managing not to quite literally cream his pants. The moment they were inside, Brianna looked around, the house quiet, and her eyes lit up when she realised nobody else was home. No hesitation, they were up the stairs and making a beeline for his room, and upon entering, Jeff waddled awkwardly to the bed and plopped down on it, letting out a shuddering sigh.<br />
<br />
Giggling, she shut the door and came across to sit next to him. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Jeffy, but I was having too much fun. You&#39;re not upset or anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no,&quot; He blushed, and exhaled slowly, &quot;but I do feel like ... I&#39;m about to burst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;You were doing faces like when the pool filter tried to eat you.&quot; Another flurry of giggles. &quot;Did I make you all backed up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; The apology was teasing, but also genuine, and Brianna leaned it and gave him a gentle kiss. They lingered together only a moment, with her seeming to instinctively know that kissing alone might be enough to set him off. &quot;I&#39;ll make it better, but first, I wanna see the damage. Lie back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff complied, turning to recline on the bed, swinging his lower body up slowly and gingerly, like he was trying to avoid sudden movements to prevent setting off an explosion. She followed him up, nudging his legs just far enough apart that she could kneel down the bed from him, between them. Then, she took the jacket from where he had kept it studiously glued to his abdomen the entire time, and tossed it onto the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy FUCK!&quot; Brianna&#39;s exclamation was amazed and impressed. The material around his crotch was straining so much, that even the waistband had a little air between it and his body. It seemed like a bowling ball was buried inside, and she reached for his fly. &quot;About to burst is no exaggeration. Let&#39;s get your pants off. I&#39;ll be really careful with you. Promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Undoing the top button, she began easing the fly down, which needed no encouragement, the outward pressure causing it to slowly unzip on its own once the top of it came free. At the same time, he gripped around his hips, lifting his butt, and pulled down. The bra was caught up with the pants, and it came along for the ride, but the silky scraping of the material across his super sensitive crotch made him grunt in agitation.<br />
<br />
They both froze.<br />
<br />
Too soon for an accident.<br />
<br />
Jeff let the feeling recede, giving it a dozen seconds before they continued, and then they crested Everest. He let out another grunt as the nipple popped free and then, with the material able to come away on the downard slope, no longer pressing on the underside, she pulled and his pants peeled off. They came the rest of the way harmlessly and she dropped them with the discarded jacket on the floor, before turning back to take in the sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; She whispered. &quot;It&#39;s too good for porn. It belongs, like, in an arthouse erotica film, or something! Seriously.&quot; Their eyes met. &quot;Look, I&#39;m no expert on any of that, but I&#39;m not kidding. It&#39;s big, and ... it&#39;s beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brianna was right on both counts, and Jeff admitted to himself it was true, gazing down at his female body part. Today it had broken all previous records, and even with his thighs spread as comfortably as possible, it still took up a LOT of space between his legs. Yet, there was a new feeling present and he immediately identified the unexpected emotion as pride.<br />
<br />
Pride!<br />
<br />
He was proud of everything about it -- the size, the shape, the texture, the softness, the erotic vibes it so readily gave off, the perfect way it attached to his body, how it felt so natural he could swear it was meant to belong to him. Even so full and liquid-taut, with the nipple itself longer and fatter than ever before, the pride was winning out over the freakish shame, for perhaps the first time ever. It was a strange revelation that was interrupted by her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was gonna take care of you like we&#39;ve done before, but ... I&#39;ve had another idea.&quot; She leaned forward, placing her hands on the outer side of either thigh. &quot;I think you&#39;ll love this.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a dip of the head, she was right in front of his swollen groin, and then ... wet, smooth, warm, as her tongue slid up the front. She avoided the nipple, going around it, and began to cover the entire surface of his breast with saliva. Each lick was slow and sticky and gloriously slick, and Jeff began to un-selfconsciously moan. The sides and lower parts followed, and feeling her cheeks brushing both thigh and breast-flesh while her tongue squirmed into the crevice between them was ticklishly erotic. He could only watch and groan, the liquid inside slopping audibly as she switched sides again, her face nuzzling and mashing against it.<br />
<br />
Her hands stayed resting on his thighs, fingertips running up and down the outer sides of his legs, and then in a series of kisses back to the untouched cherry on top, Brianna paused a moment, to make proper eye contact, before those perfect soft lips engulfed the nub.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnnnngh!&quot; Jeff moaned.<br />
<br />
She began to suck, and it was everything he imagined a blowjob would be, except better. More concentrated, more intense, more sensitive, an entire cock&#39;s worth of oral perfection crammed into a little hardened bundle of nerves. Her tongue flicked back and forth over the tip, and the sheets scrunched beneath his grip in time with each pass. Her lips were brushing the areola too, caressing it over and over, even as she continued the suction. It was hot lightning, and he couldn&#39;t get enough of the wet pulling sensation of being suckled, how swollen and desperate he felt, how her soft slurping was like music to him, but most of all, how badly he wanted to let go and feed her everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nnn-gggghh-uh!&quot; He groaned again, eyes still locked with hers.<br />
<br />
Brianna began to suck harder, quicker, her mouth alternating between running circles around the tip and wetly tugging on the whole plump end. He was staring, breath heavy, the organ trembling, jiggling and wobbling, from the endlessly tensed muscles in his legs, butt, and stomach. The male desire to fuck, thrust his hips and non-existent penis, was strong, but what he was experiencing was stronger. A feminine need to be nursed on, to let it go, was eclipsing that desire, and as it did so, he gave in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brianna!&quot; He gasped, and his milk began to flow, jetting forcefully into her waiting mouth. Her lips formed a seal, and she was drinking. Moaning louder, panting, he couldn&#39;t take his eyes away, the orgasm smooth and sweet and prolonged, like the thick flow he was releasing. Her throat was moving, and he could see her swallowing even through his stupor. Her hands slid across into his hairless crotch, and latched onto the base, squeezing it. A surge of increased pleasure shot through him, and he grunted again as more gushed and streamed from the renewed pressure. Still sucking hungrily, Brianna was literally massaging it out of him, and he could only make primal sounds of absolute joy as he breastfed her, watching her drink from his slowly shrinking mammary.<br />
<br />
Finally, a minute later, she pulled away, the nipple slipping out with a nearly inaudible slick pop, and delicately wiped her lips with a hand. Before she could move, Jeff sat up and croaked out a needy question, addicted to the experience, and so close to begging that it was embarrassing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bri-Bri, c-could you- ... please, j-just for a little ... longer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;kay,&quot; she replied, a grin appearing, voice husky, face flushed, and leaned in, lips wrapping around his nipple once more.<br />
<br />
With that, Jeff sighed in total contentment, and lay back on his bed, his hands coming to rest lightly on her head, fingers threading through her hair, as she began to gently suckle on him again.</p>
