<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Saturday morning had begun and Joel lay sprawled across his bed, the morning sun beaming through the window onto his face and shaggy blonde hair. Shying from the light he turned away before slightly opened his eyes, adjusting to the bright world outside. It was so tempting to close his eyes again, “Just 10 more minutes...” his mind begged tenaciously.<br />
<br />
Finally, Joel mustered the willpower to start the day. Getting up, he slowly trudged to the bathroom for a shower. Fending off the urge to return to his comfortable bed. As he trudges towards the bathroom he feels something strange about his body, but his inattentive mind gave it little thought having just escaped the clutches of sleep.<br />
<br />
After a seemingly long journey to the bathroom, he begins removing his dirty clothing from the previous day. As he does so, he stares into the mirror wondering how he should spend his weekend. It wasn&#39;t until Joel removed his last piece of clothing that he noticed something. As he slid his underwear off, a new weight became apparent.<br />
<br />
Looking down, Joel&#39;s face changed to one of shock to discover his human equipment gone. In its place is a light brown furred sheath, the fur increased in length and changing to white towards the opening. His eyes trailed further down to discover the source of the increased weight hanging from his body. A leathery brown-grey coloured sack drooped from beneath him; the shape of their contents far from human.<br />
<br />
Joel panicked in shock, now more awake than ever. His mind desperately searched for answers. Memories of the previous night suddenly flooding back. <br />
<br />
“Box! Vial!” his mind screamed. Joel rushes as fast as he can to the dining room, then bringing the box back to the bathroom; his cumbersome new sack making the action awkward as he ran. Opening the box, he found the note and vial again.<br />
<br />
Re-reading the note and looking at the Cervine vile now confirming his suspicion. After calming down he decided to think the situation over before meddling with the vials for a solution. But his mind soon wondered. Deciding to view his changes in more detail, his curiosity had once again got the better of him.<br />
<br />
It had been cumbersome to move with his larger sack, but while he knew it had changed he had only caught a glance earlier. “I have to see!” his mind shouted, yearning to know. Spreading his legs to better see any changes, Joel nervously lowered his gaze to examine his new family jewels. The sight making his eyes visibly widen.<br />
<br />
His leathery brown-grey sack swung gently; far larger elongated testicles prominently denoting his maleness contained within. After a moment he noticed something else, “Why does it look farther away?” he wondered. Turning around and looking into the mirror, he saw why. His sack had moved farther back and now hung under his anus. Cupping his sack drew a gasp as he felt their size and weight; the two heavy testicles much too large for him to grasp together. Joel stood upright again, his pendulous sack resting on the back of his legs.<br />
<br />
The new weight was still alien to him, “This will take a while to get used to...” he thought; mind derailing towards the end. Joel ran his hands through the fur covering his groin noticing how soft it felt. He wondered what had happened to his equipment, now hidden inside the sheath.<br />
<br />
Joel tentatively moved his fingers past the white-fur that lined his sheath opening, feeling the warm and moist inside. As his nimble fingers manipulate the fleshy opening, a strong musk permeated from the sheath causing Joel to remove his fingers. Unwittingly, he had raised his hands attempting to cover his nose; the musk far more pungent now. Joel&#39;s crotch stirred as the musk became overpowering; part of his brain finding pride in its potency - something that deeply disturbed Joel.<br />
<br />
Wide-eyed, he felt blood rush to his lower-regions as a heightened but familiar sensation began. His sheath swelled, bulging significantly as his new appendage expanded. Joel stared down at the opening, the white ring of fur marking the entrance; apprehensive of what may emerge. The rush and expanding of his lower-regions further causing his sheath to swell. Another rush; the bulge bloating again, now moving upwards. Gaze locked on the opening, Joel&#39;s breathing increased as the fleshy opening to his sheath parted, the pointed tip of his new cervine cock emerging. <br />
<br />
A tentative hand moved down to touch it, shocking Joel as he realised the hand is his. Shivers of sensation rolled from the contact, drawing a moan and over an inch of the sensitive appendage to spire outwards. Inch by inch it continued to emerge from within him; the girth increasing as more escaped. Continuing until his maleness stood erect and fully-extended from his crotch, reaching over 10 inches; its thick base hugged by the white fur at his sheath opening. His fully erect cervine cock stood proudly from his sheath, curved in shape as it went from thick base to pointed tip.<br />
<br />
Lust and desire having clouded Joel&#39;s mind, he wrapped his fingers around the girth feeling the warm slick texture. Musk continued to penetrate his nose with an intense scent of maleness. Natural lubrication helped Joel&#39;s hand slide down the appendage; the act triggering a brief convulsion of his body. He was in heaven. Fingers parted as his hand descended the spire of flesh, no longer able to wrap around the thick appendage; waves of pleasured rolling through his body. <br />
<br />
He moves his hand upwards, the sheer length making the act seemingly last an eternity. Joel could no longer contain himself as he added his other hand, pumping his cervine cock with renewed delight; moaning almost constantly. The sensation soon bringing him to his knees, and then the ground as new heights were reached. Each pump bringing intense pleasure; the burning desire for release growing.<br />
<br />
Wave after intense wave of burning pleasure rolled through his body, pumping his virile cervine cock furiously. His desire for release almost at its peak. Pre-cum leaked from the tip allowing his hands to pleasure his considerable male length with renewed vigour. On instinct, Joel began powerfully thrusting into every pump. <br />
<br />
Suddenly the intensity of sensations that rolled through his body reached their peak. His large sack pulling upwards as the contents rushed forth. Joel&#39;s mouth draped open in a loud moan. Seed erupted from the tip of his cervine cock in an explosion of organism release. Rope after rope of potent seed sprayed forth, coating Joel&#39;s face and chest; a torrent of pleasure and delight coursed through his body. Seconds become an eternity as his virile seed continuing to erupt in the height of climax; intense pleasure and satisfaction radiating throughout his body. <br />
<br />
After several moments Joel&#39;s climactic release began to die down; the height of pleasure from which he fell almost making him black out. Too tired to move and needing rest he remained lying on the ground; stewing in the aftermath.<br />
<br />
<br />
What could happen next...</p>
