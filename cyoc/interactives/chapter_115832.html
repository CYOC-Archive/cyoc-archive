<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> For the rest of the working day thoughts about the “Merging Ring” and its supposed powers were never far from Trent’s mind. Whenever he stood next to one of his co-workers, whenever he accidently brushed against someone, whenever he rode an elevator with somebody else present. When Mr. Derby patted his shoulder for a job well done. All these situations inflamed his fantasy of fusing with those people of claiming them, of shoving them into his body and gaining all they were. <br />
Soon these fantasies started to make Trent horny. He wasn’t exactly sure what about this idea, to merge another man into himself, was so alluring in a sexual way, he assumed that the power and dominance aspect about it made it hot. <br />
<br />
He knew that this whole thing was nonsense, rings weren’t magic. Magic didn’t exist. But the farther the day advanced the more Trent became obsessed with the fantasy of merging. And the more he wanted to try if it worked after all. He started to come up with plans on how to do it. It needed to be a way that wouldn’t make him look like a total fool if it didn’t work. He could hug someone, he supposed, but there couldn’t be any witnesses in case it did work, so he needed to see someone alone, which was easier said than done in a busy office, even Mr. Derby would be busy for the rest of the day. <br />
<br />
In the end Trent decided that it couldn’t be one of his co-workers, not until he understood how the merging process worked exactly. It had to be someone from his private life, somebody he could get alone time with and who wouldn’t object to close physical contact, like a hug. <br />
<br />
Looking through his lists of contacts on his phone Trent soon found the right candidate; Shawn, one of his oldest and closest friends. Trent smiled, Shawn was perfect! He was handsome, more muscular than Trent and they were nearly as close as brothers, so why not make that bond even closer? He was also still at university and currently had summer vacation, so he would not need to be anywhere important for the time being and would be able to spend a bit of time inside of Trent.  <br />
He called Shawn. <br />
<br />
“What’s up, Trent?” <br />
<br />
Trent bit his lip, he could feel his dick harden, he needed to keep his voice steady “Hey, Shawn,” he greeted back “listen my car is broken, could you pick me up from work with your bike?”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, dude.” <br />
<br />
“Cool, we can hang out afterwards, grab something to eat, play video games…” he needed to get Shawn alone after all. <br />
“Sounds fun, see you when your shift is over!” <br />
<br />
Trent’s mouth twitched into a smile as he thanked Shawn and hung up. He looked at the shiny, silver ring on his finger, soon this ring would cause another man to melt into his body. He could net believe it, soon he’d merge with Shawn. <br />
<br />
The last few hours of work seemed like forever, the urge to try to fuse with somebody grew harder and harder to resist, it was almost as if the ring was trying to tempt Trent into using it. On his way out he nearly jumped both the janitor and the security guard in order to merge with them. <br />
<br />
Thankfully Shawn was already waiting for him outside the office. Seeing him Trent could already feel his dick harden again. Just as Trent had hoped Shawn was decked out in his full motorcycle leathers, the tight fabric hugging his muscular frame, his dark hair was messy from his helmet, his chin covered in manly stubble. Merely seeing this Shawn, his best friend, standing there, leaning against his bike and knowing that soon all of this man would be part of him was almost overwhelming. <br />
<br />
Shawn gave Trent a smile “Hey buddy!” He gave his friend a fist bump, before putting his gloves back on and chucking a spare helmet to Trent. “Just hop on,” he said as he straddled his bike. <br />
<br />
“Thanks again for doing this,” Trent said getting onto the bike behind Shawn. <br />
<br />
“No worries, it’s no big deal.” <br />
<br />
That was when Trent realized how oblivious Shawn was to what was about to happen. Shawn had no clue that he would become part of him. In a way this made it even better and Trent looked forward to seeing his friend’s reaction once the process started. <br />
<br />
“Now hold on tight…” Shawn instructed. <br />
<br />
Trent nodded wrapping his arms around Shawn’s abdomen, and the ride began. <br />
<br />
Squeezed up against Shawn, the smell of his leathers in his nose, the strength of his muscles straining against his grip Trent wished he could fuse right then, right there, but he did not want to imagine the possible consequences of merging while riding a motorcycle. It was too dangerous. <br />
<br />
On their way to Trent’s apartment Shawn stopped at a burger joint. As they ordered he paid for Shawn’s meal, after all it was the last one his friend would eat for some time. <br />
<br />
For a while Trent was just mesmerized by watching Shawn eat, knowing that soon, soon, the person sitting there wouldn’t be there any longer. Soon Shawn would be unable to take any action by himself, unable to make any decision, unable to think a single thought. And he was blissfully unaware of it all. <br />
<br />
Glancing down at the shiny, silver ring on his finger Trent got another urge, not to just fuse Shawn into him, but to tell his friend about what was about to happen, just to see his reaction. <br />
<br />
Finally, Trent couldn’t fight it any longer. <br />
“Say Shawn, how’d you like to become part of me?” he bit his lip “Or rather to become one with me?”<br />
<br />
Shawn put his coke down, he looked confused “What?” <br />
<br />
Trent cursed in his mind. Why had he just said that? Of course Shawn would be confused by such a statement. <br />
“Uh it’s just this weird dream I had last night,” Trent tried to save the situation, he showed the ring to Shawn “I had this magic ring that allowed me to, well, kind of merge other people into me…”<br />
<br />
“Merge?”<br />
<br />
“You know, fusing, mixing. I could draw other people into my body and gained their characteristics.”     <br />
<br />
Shawn chuckled “Sounds weird…” <br />
<br />
“Eh, it was kinda cool. Each person I fused with gave me a different appearance, a perfect blend between them and me. Some of them made me look quite hot and I can’t help but think that if the dream was real, and I really had a magic ring that would allow me to merge people into me, you and me combined would make one hot motherfucker….”<br />
<br />
“That may be,” Shawn agreed, chomping on his fries “still wouldn’t want to ‘fuse’ with you…” <br />
<br />
That almost hurt Trent, like a grave insult “Aw come on, why don’t you want to be mixed into me?” <br />
“Because I’m a guy, not cake mix? Why would any sane person be ‘mixed into’ someone else?”<br />
<br />
 That hurt even more. It was one thing to decline an offer, another to ridicule an idea, especially an idea that Trent wanted so desperately to achieve. <br />
<br />
Feeling frustration building up Trent turned his attention back to the “Merging Ring”, watching it reflect the diner’s lights. He was mad at Shawn, mad that the other man didn’t want to merge with him, mad that he had dismissed the very idea of human fusion. And in this frustration he blurted out something else. <br />
<br />
“Well I suppose if I really had the power to merge others into me, I wouldn’t need your consent. I could just do it.” Trent immediately bit his tongue. <br />
<br />
Shawn looked at him like he was some sort of alien, “This conversation is getting weird…” he said “how about I just take you home?” <br />
<br />
Dammit… “Sure, Shawn, still wanna hang out?” <br />
<br />
“Maybe not today, dude…” <br />
<br />
Dammit! Trent had just blown his opportunity to merge with Shawn. How could he have been so stupid? What had he expected? That Shawn liked the idea of being sucked into his body? That he’d beg him to do it? <br />
Soon he was back behind Shawn on the bike, clinging to his friend’s body as they rode down the street. Aching more than ever to fuse with him. <br />
<br />
Finally, the ring once again drove Trent over the edge. He had to fuse with Shawn! And he had to do it right now! No matter the consequences! Still not wanting to end up dead on the sidewalk he knocked against Shawn’s stomach, their sign for him to stop, which he did in a nearby side street. <br />
<br />
 “What is it…?” Shawn asked, flipping up his visor and looking back at Trent. <br />
<br />
Trent left his arms firmly planted around Shawn’s body, he quickly glanced up and down the street. Thankfully it was deserted. <br />
“Listen Shawn,” Trent began, using one hand to relieve himself of the motorcycle helmet “about the merging stuff…”<br />
<br />
Shawn put his helmet off and sighed “Just drop it, I know dreams are weird I’m not mad at you.” <br />
<br />
Trent gave Shawn a smirk “I don’t care if you are or not,” he told his friend “and I don’t care whether you want to fuse with me or not. I have decided I want to merge you into me, I have the power to do so, and that’s what I’m gonna do…” Remembering the instructions the Sri Lankan partner had given him Trent squeezed even tighter against Shawn and sent a mental command into the ring. <br />
<br />
“You’re seriously getting creepy right now…” Shawn told Trent, “Let go of me!” he hissed and gripped Trent’s arms, trying to separate them from his torso. <br />
<br />
Trent felt the power of the ring activating, the cool metal gowing warm, hot even….spreading a pleasant, warm feeling through his whole body. <br />
“Can’t let go…” Trent managed to say and started to moan, this was awesome…”Won’t let go…ever again…” <br />
<br />
It was clear by now that Shawn was using all his strength to free himself out of Trent’s grip, and usually he was quite a bit stronger than Trent. Today however, as much as Shawn tore on his friend’s arms, he couldn’t separate them from his torso. “Let go!” he bellowed “I don’t wanna hurt you!” <br />
<br />
Trent couldn’t care less about what Shawn was yelling about. He was too absorbed into that amazing, warm, pleasurable feeling that had taken hold of his whole body…and the awesome sensation of feeling of his friend’s muscular frame as he grinded against him in a vain attempt to get away. <br />
<br />
Then the next part of the process started as Trent could feel his body losing cohesion. Not completely, he did not melt into a puddle or evaporate, but he could feel his flesh growing…sluggish…heavy. He felt like turning into barely solid slime or molasses. <br />
<br />
Nothing could have prepared him for the sensation of first feeling Shawn gripping THROUGH his arm. With a wet *plop* Shawn’s large, leather gloved hand was sucked into the arm he had been tearing at. A sharp, white-hot pang of pleasure flared through Trent’s body, hardening his dick against Shawn’s ass. Soon enough Shawn dragged his hand free from Trent’s mass, but for one, brief moment Trent had gotten a taste of what it would be like to have Shawn inside of him. <br />
Next Trent’s arms started melting into Shawn’s torso, mixing their masses as Shawn’s body started to get the same semi-solid consistency as Trent’s. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” Shawn sounded confused, enraged and terrified at the same time “You’re…you’re melting into me…” <br />
<br />
“Nuhu…” was all Trent could answer “you’re melting into me, Shawn…” he started dry humping the other man, there were wet, squishy sounds as this action started mixing their bodies together, more and more with each hump and bump.<br />
<br />
“Stop!” yelled Shawn “You can’t do this! Stop! You can’t do this! I’m your friend! You can’t just consume me!” <br />
<br />
Trent chuckled. Couldn’t he? Shouldn’t he? Was it wrong to claim Shawn, a man who was his oldest, closest friend and clearly had no desire to join with him? Maybe it was…but stopping it was out of the question. It felt too good…the melting and mingling of their masses, the sensation of Shawn…. flowing…into him. He couldn’t stop, not as they were so close to complete unity. <br />
<br />
Shawn fought for every inch of his body, but it became clear to both of them that this was a battle Shawn would lose as Trent started to feel Shawn’s mass as his own. Taking control of what remained of Shawn’s body he not only stopped his friend from struggling, but used Shawn’s hands to press their heads together. <br />
<br />
For a moment The world became dark and warm as both men now completely lost cohesion turning into a mass of vaguely humanoid muck. Inside this muck Shawn now experienced complete absorption of his mind into Trent. All his memories, skills, talents, traits…all that had made him Shawn was ripped from him and added to Trent until his very self, his very soul dissolved into the other man. His last thought as Shawn was a bit of black homour; figuring that in the end he was cake mix after all. <br />
<br />
Trent felt his body re-solidifying, but it was not the same body as before his merger with Shawn. No, as he regained his humanity Trent could feel his body being heavier, meatier, more muscular. Instinctively he flexed his new, bulbous arms and he could feel his new dick, larger by several inches. Next he felt the sensation of tight leather around his whole body, every inch below the neck covered in it. It was wrapped around his large, meaty hands, encased his new, large feet in a pair of heavy boots and held an almost painful grip on his crotch. It felt amazing. <br />
<br />
What was even more amazing, however, was the sensation and awareness that he was now alone on the bike…alone in the street… A giddy feeling spread through his body. He needed to confirm it… He got off the bike and looked at his reflection in a nearby store window. His jaw dropped. <br />
<br />
Staring back at him was not his old self, but a 6’5’’ muscle hunk with thick dirty blonde hair and a matching beard. He was dressed into what looked like a classic, three-piece business suit….made completely out of shiny, black leather…even the tie and dress shirt underneath and with matching gloves and boots. He had done it…he had merged Shawn into himself…his best friend…now part of him… <br />
<br />
“Woohoo!” he exclaimed pumping his leather gloved fists in the air, “I’ve absorbed Shawn! I’ve really done it! My best friend is now part of me!” <br />
<br />
He then slapped his own chest “Well, how do you like that buddy? Still repulsed by the idea of being mixed into me?” he laughed out loud “Of course not! You’re me now!  And I’m loving this!”<br />
<br />
Trent walked back to Shawn’s…no HIS… motorcycle. As he straddled it, the mental aspect of his merger with Shawn became clear to him for the first time; he had never learned to drive a bike, yet now sitting here he not only knew by heart how to drive this thing, but it felt…familiar…natural… he realized he could recall the many times Shawn had driven his bike and how much enjoyment his friend had gotten out of it. All this, the knowledge, the emotions, the memories…it was now part of him. He rested his gloved hands on the handles as he explored other parts that Shawn had supplied to him. Memories of his life…sensations…knowledge…opinions… believes…all now part of him. All that had made Shawn a person was now part of him.  <br />
<br />
He recalled Shawn as he had been waiting for him outside the office, a leather clad hunk, leaning against his beloved motorbike, and also a complete person, his best friend, with his own life, his own hopes, dreams and fears. That man didn’t exist anymore. Nobody could now look at Shawn or interact with him. Shawn had ceased to be as an individual, and all that remained was an improved version of Trent. It was a mindfuck. And it was amazing… <br />
Trent looked down at the silver ring, now prominently visible against the black leather of his glove. This silly little thing had allowed him to claim another man, another person as his. He really needed to thank that Sri Lankan partner properly next time. <br />
<br />
With that, the new and improved Trent, revved up his bike, kicked away the stand and drove off.</p>
