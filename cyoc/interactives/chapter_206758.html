<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Van set down the clippers again, running his hand over the shorter hair on his chest. Like his tormentor had said he could trim, just not shave. He frowned at his reflection, scrubbing at the short bear don his face. All this new hair itched, but hopefully he would get used to it. He headed back out into his bedroom and grabbed his discarded shirt off the bed, pulling it back on. Even the fabric against his fuzzier chest felt weird.<br />
<br />
A knock on his apartment door brought him up short for a moment. He headed there and peered through the peephole, only to be met with the distorted but familiar face of his friend Paul.  He opened the door, Paul lifting his hand in a wave as he did so. &quot;Hey man, what, uh.. brings you by?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul arched a brow, stepping past Van into the apartment. &quot;Well, I hadn&#39;t heard from you since we dumped your blacked out ass here Friday night. Thought I&#39;d check on you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oooo.. he&#39;s cute.&quot; Abaltis voice was soft in Van&#39;s ear, making him turn his head to the side where the fairy sat on his shoulder, only six inches tall and nude, with the addition of a pair of gossamer insectile wings on his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Van hissed at the fairy, making Paul turn to look at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I won&#39;t worry about you in the future.&quot; Paul replied, holding up his hands. Even Van had to admit Paul was good looking. He had been friends with him and Greg since their first year of high school. At the time Paul had been short and a little nerdy. A growth spurt sophomore year put him on the radar of the football coach. He bulked, up, grew taller, with his tanned skin and thick black hair he was probably the most classically good looking of the three friends. He was also a bit on the hairy side, but so was Van now. He was also the well behaved one of the trio, usually spending his time keeping the other two out of trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;He can&#39;t see me, pet. Or hear me.&quot; Albatis said, reaching up to flick Van&#39;s earlobe. &quot;Hmm.. he&#39;s an interesting one. Lots of desires, all of them bottled up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, yeah, sorry. Thanks for that. It&#39;s just been a weird weekend.&quot; Van said, lifting a hand to brush Abaltis from his shoulder, the fairy flew off and landed on top of his kitchen counter, staring at Van with his arms over his chest, though he kept looking to Paul, his smile growing bigger each time he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird? How so?&quot; Paul asked, making himself at home on Van&#39;s couch. After a dozen years of friendship, that&#39;s how things worked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You, uh, don&#39;t notice anything different?&quot; Van asked, curiously. Paul just looked Van up and down and shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not going to notice the changes, pet. No one will unless I want them, too. Can&#39;t go around advertising fairy magic.&quot; Abaltis had taken to the air again, landing on the back of the couch and staring up at Paul&#39;s stubbled jaw, with his rugged, squared features.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, sorry. Still getting over the break up.&quot; Van said lamely, it even sounded like a piss poor excuse as he moved to take a chair in his living room, keeping an eye on the damned fairy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the third one this year, man. You should be used to them by now. Mind if I?&quot; Paul asked, jerking his thumb towards the bathroom, Van just shaking his head.<br />
<br />
However, once Paul left the room Abaltis came to flutter in front of Van&#39;s face. &quot;Wanna play a game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With you? Fuck no.&quot; Van said, trying to wave off the fairy like a bug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, don&#39;t be like that.&quot; Abaltis chimed up teasingly as he alighted on the coffee table. &quot;It&#39;ll be fun, and you&#39;ll get something out of it.&quot; Van&#39; glared, but didn&#39;t interrupt, which seemed to encourage him on to his offer. &quot;If you can get your mouth on your friend&#39;s cock by sundown, or you get his on yours, I&#39;ll let you change one thing about yourself, or undo something I did. You fail, I get to make another change.&quot; He pulled out a cigar, from where Van couldn&#39;t tell, as the little fucker wasn&#39;t wearing any clothes, but he puffed away, arms crossing over his chest as he grinned up at Van.<br />
<br />
&quot;Won&#39;t work. He&#39;s straight. So am I if you forgot.&quot; Van rested his chin in his hand. &quot;Unless you fucked with that, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Abaltis said, shaking his head. &quot;I mean, I could turn you gay, but this is more fun. I don&#39;t want to do that until you give in to me. As for your friend there? Also, no. He&#39;s completely gay, he&#39;s just in the closet. We can read desires, and he likes men.&quot; He blew out a ring of smoke and smirked. &quot;Think about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van looked over to the bathroom door. Sure Paul had had girlfriends, but none of them lasted more than a few weeks, and they were few and far between. Not like Van who seemed to have a new girlfriend every few months, or the married Greg. &quot;Fuck off. I&#39;m not taking anymore of your damned deals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, scared? You&#39;re going to give into me eventually. And really, what are you losing, so we move my picks up by one day. You on the other hand, I won&#39;t even alter what you pick later on. Like your cock, it&#39;s yours.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I get a change and you leave me alone for a week and we got a deal.&quot; Van retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re learning.&quot; Abaltis chuckled. &quot;Deal.&quot; The door to the bathroom opened and the fairy vanished in a small blue puff of smoke. As Paul walked out, Van started mentally kicking himself. Just being in the presence of that damned fairy he lost what little wits he had. It was like he wanted to show him up.<br />
<br />
Van sighed, and scrubbed his face with his hand. He had to do this now. Paul put a hand on his shoulder as he sat back down on the couch. &quot;Everything alright, man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah..&quot; Van replied, his voice cracking and his mouth suddenly dry. How was he going to do this. He got up off his chair and moved over to the couch, sitting down next to Paul. &#39;Think.&#39; He chided himself. &#39;You&#39;ve gotten plenty of one night stands with women, charmed their pants off. It&#39;s just the same.&#39; Except it was Paul, who was his friend, and a guy. &quot;You&#39;ve always been a good friend to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul instantly looked skeptical. &quot;I&#39;m not loaning you any more money, not after it took you two years to repay me the last time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van winced. He had forgotten about that. &quot;No, I mean, you look out for me, make sure I get home safe, check on me. You&#39;re a good guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, thanks.&quot; Though his voice sounded unsure Paul looked, well, pleased. &quot;I mean, you&#39;re my friend, too. Sure you&#39;re a pain in my ass, but I like having you around.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was Van&#39;s opening. &quot;I, um, like having you around, too.&quot; He gulped, and put his hand on Paul&#39;s which made the other man&#39;s eyes go a bit wide. &quot;Paul. I know. And I feel the same way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The same?&quot; Paul started questioningly, but Van didn&#39;t let him finish instead bracing himself and going in for a kiss. Paul seized up at the contact, but didn&#39;t pull away. After a moment, his lips parted and he leaned into the kiss. It was Van&#39;s turn to be surprised with how eager Paul suddenly was, one of his hands going down to grope at Van&#39;s prodigious package, which to Van&#39;s surprise responded by starting to harden. Van in turn began to unbutton Paul&#39;s shirt, exposing his muscular, black furred chest as their lips continued to dance.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the Paul&#39;s hand left Van&#39;s crotch and moved to his chest, pushing him away and breaking the kiss. &quot;No, this isn&#39;t right..&quot; Paul started, staring at Van with a mix of lust and fear. &quot;I&#39;m not.. we&#39;re not..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you.. we are.&quot; Van said, trying to lure Paul back in, putting his hands on his friend&#39;s muscular shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Paul said more firmly, and stood up. &quot;Just, no.&quot; He quickly stalked to the front door, barely giving Van a chance to stand up and take a few steps to follow before he was out in the stairwell, taking them two at a time as he rushed to get out of there. Van almost gave chase, but something held him back. Shame, that he would use his friend like that. Guilt suddenly weighed him down and he closed his apartment door and leaned back against it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo.. so close. Almost had him opening that closet door. Maybe if you were more his type..&quot; Abaltis mocked, having reappeared on the kitchen counter looking right at Van. &quot;I mean, you&#39;re about halfway there, still missing a few key details.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up.&quot; Van shot back. &quot;I think I just fucked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, maybe not as bad as you think.&quot; The fairy replied. &quot;Either way, I&#39;ll be taking my payment. I&#39;ll do you a favor though, make you a tad more appealing to your friend Paul there. Then maybe he&#39;ll forgive you easier.&quot; One snap of the fairy&#39;s fingers and Van was suddenly leaning against the door naked. &quot;Sorry, need to adjust your wardrobe for this one, again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van moved to lunge for the fairy, to grab him, and instead over balanced and fell to the ground. He panted as ever muscle in his body felt like it was suddenly on fire. It was the chest growth, again, only stronger. Van had always been lean his whole life, he didn&#39;t put on fat, but he didn&#39;t really put on muscle either. That was changing. His arms right in his line of sight were already thickening. He could see definition coming though on his upper arms as his fore arms corded with new muscle. He sat back on his heels, his chest puffing out a bit more from the small pecs he had into a more obvious pair, grooves forming in his flat stomach below the trimmed brown hair. He had to change the way his was sitting as his thighs and calves thickened with new muscle.<br />
<br />
As the heat died away he ran his hands over himself, shuddering. &quot;Fuck me.&quot; He wasn&#39;t as jacked as Paul or Abaltis with their heavy, dense builds. He was still lean, but now had some very obvious definition, probably having stacked on a good twenty pounds of muscle in mere moments. <br />
<br />
&quot;I would if you&#39;d let me.&quot; Abaltis said, now standing in front of Van at full size, still naked, though the wings were gone. &quot;Mmm.. that&#39;s one of my favorites. Maybe I&#39;ll jack you up some more later, make you a real meat head. But for now, a little will do.&quot; Van felt a pair of hands under his arms pulling him to his feet. He looked down into the shorter fairy&#39;s face, who was grinning around his cigar. &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow, pet.&quot; And with a tweak to the nipple that mad Van moan softly, he disappeared.<br />
<br />
Van took a moment to recover his head, and went to get his phone, having to adjust to a slightly altered center of gravity. He quickly sent a text to Paul asking to talk. He spent the next half hour sitting in his living room naked, waiting in vain for a reply</p>
