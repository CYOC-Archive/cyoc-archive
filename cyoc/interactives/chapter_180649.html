<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kendall swore he never had this happen to him. On top of his shirt feeling like it was shrunk in the wash today, and even his pants giving off that very same sensation, Allison had once again told him he really needed that shave - and then she just stared at him for a while the rest of class. It was honestly rather odd. Kendall then found himself called to the front and had a very...odd discussion with Professor Clark. The guy was looking to be in incredible shape, not like Kendall had much going on with him in that regard, but the guy seemed to think something was wrong.<br />
<br />
Kendall despite his misgivings now had felt nothing but excellent during class - even with Allison&#39;s complaints regarding his hygiene in mind. He had found himself studying with a renewed sense of energy, and even had to stretch a few times when he registered that his energy levels were getting to be rather unruly. Maybe he was more of a kinesthetic learner than he thought he was. Usually it was just a quiet place and some books - now Kendall figured he might need to do some physical activity alongside his more scholarly pursuits.<br />
<br />
But as of right now, Kendall was worried. He never had a moment like this - and he KNEW this school really well! Yet for some reason he found himself drifting off. Losing his track of where he was supposed to go. He knew where his arithmetic class was supposed to be. Yet when he set out to GO there it seemed that it was so far off from his estimation that he was left contemplating if there was some brain malfunction going on right now. He remembered the teacher asking him that question.<br />
<br />
He remembered answering that there was nothing particularly idiosyncratic today.<br />
<br />
Kendall scratched the back of his head as he realized he got lost so bad he ended up in the men&#39;s locker room. The bathroom in particular was where he ended up next - deciding maybe he just needed to wash his face a bit. Clear things up with himself. When Kendall saw his reflection was he was absolutely taken aback. He was no jock by far, but his body had grown into a lean and muscular build that now strained his shirt and pants. He could see his pecs - he had PECS! - pushing against his shirt, which was usually a good fit.<br />
<br />
Gingerly, and with the possibility of unwanted guests in mind, Kendall removed his shirt. And he was astonished yet again. His midsection despite his drinking the prior night was tight and toned, six strong abdominal muscles visible at the slightest tensing of his stomach. Kendall also saw a rather strong and vibrant amount of body hair leading up from his groin all the way to his chest, curling around his nipples and slightly hiding his pectorals. His pectorals were being hidden like this.<br />
<br />
It would not do.<br />
<br />
Something seemed to possess Kendall at that moment and he decided he was done dealing with this. &quot;Prepare to meet your doom...body hair!&quot; Kendall grumbled and then retrieved his razor---his dad&#39;s razor from his backpack. He barely gave the time of day and his tardiness a second thought as he started shaving himself up then and there, with a curiously practiced performance that he hardly recognized.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even nick himself once as he cleaned up his chest and face, observing a slightly more angular, handsome featured face emerge from behind the body hair that had grown in so thick on him. His pecs and abs almost looked slightly more defined still once he was done with them. And yet Kendall was hardly done. Before he could recognize what he was doing with himself, he stripped down to his underwear and started working on even his legs and the hair around his groin.<br />
<br />
Bit by bit he trimmed his hair down - wondering why he felt such a sense of urgency in this when Allison never complained about his body hair there. She only ever preferred his chest and face to be clean. As if on habit, Kendall also trimmed the hair on his arms and even any that showed on his knuckles. He stood there a completely shaved bastion of nerd masculinity - still evidently the academic, but more in shape than he&#39;d been before. He ran a hand through the hair on his head and grinned at himself. Something felt kind of odd about this, and when he dressed himself again after putting away his razor he swore something seemed weird.<br />
<br />
Well, more weird than feeling compelled to shave his whole body.<br />
<br />
When he went back to the mirror, he found that it honestly looked more like he&#39;d waxed himself than shaved. He shrugged his shoulders. Well, if Allison liked it he saw no reason to be upset. Kendall fully redressed, not even noticing that his skin slightly tanned.<br />
<br />
Kendall went ahead and managed to find his way to his calculus class, and apologized profusely as he entered. The teacher, an older woman, allowed him to stay without a message to the office, but warned him against such tardiness happening again. Yet it seemed she was stricter with other guys before. Hm. Maybe she was just registering how hot Kendall was looking lately. A grin settled in on his face as he took out his books.<br />
<br />
It paid being attractive, it seemed.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Allison didn&#39;t know WHAT was going on. Kendall seemed to look disquietingly older, and it seemed as she looked at him his facial hair almost seemed to look thicker between when he went to talk to Mr. Clark, and when he came back. And Mr. Clark! To use a certain term, she was fairly certain before today that her history teacher never had girls sighing and enjoying the look of him like that - he&#39;d certainly never been called a &quot;DILF&quot; before. He was like, 60, wasn&#39;t he? Yeah, he was. But he hardly looked it now.<br />
<br />
And what was more, even though she barely found it odd, something really seemed up with Wes and Bryan - and to a degree it seemed Wes himself knew it and seemed to have a brief heated discussion with Bryan over it. Seeing as Kendall didn&#39;t even seem to recognize anything was wrong, and Lisa had to excuse herself to go to the nurse&#39;s office, Allison decided to go ahead and talk to Wes first and then see if they could open a discussion with their professor later on.<br />
<br />
Allison found Wes refilling a water bottle on the way to second period, which the two of them had together. She noted he still seemed affected by whatever happened in class between him and Bryan. Once he was done she approached him, &quot;Hola, Wes, I was hoping to---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ing---English, please.&quot; Wes responded in a rather terse way at first, before breathing, &quot;Allison, tell me. Please.&quot; He looked at her, gripping the side of his shorts tightly, &quot;You&#39;re one of the smartest girls in the class, let alone in the whole school. You&#39;d notice. Tell me, do I, Bryan, and Kendall, fuck, even the teach...do you think we&#39;re different?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Different?&quot; Allison found herself admitting this all made a surprising amount of sense, &quot;How do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like we&#39;re not how we were before.&quot; Wes gulped and looked around, &quot;Would you believe I was not always Hispanic?&quot; It seemed he was absolutely trying while talking with her not to speak in his accent - which for some reason with everything in mind seemed like just his usual thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Really? Wes, what do you mean by that?&quot; Allison asked. As far as she remembered, Wes was always the hunky Hispanic. He played football there, and---wait. &quot;You&#39;ve always been a big jock, one of the biggest...right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. No I was not.&quot; Wes gulped, gritting his teeth briefly, and then showed Allison a document on his smartphone. She read it and gasped, realizing to a degree what Wes was saying here. &quot;I used to be a stocky blond Caucasian guy. Now the only blond hair left on me is dyed. And I&#39;m not about to let that fade away. I-I honestly think, if I let the blond hair on my head fade back I might---it&#39;s silly. I know. But it&#39;s the last of OG Wes.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was honestly insane that this conversation was happening. It was like an episode of some sci fi anthology show. But the more Wes said, the more honestly made sense with what Allison experienced. Did...did this mean Kendall might be transforming somehow? &quot;...I just don&#39;t know what to even say, Wes. Whatever&#39;s happening, is there a way to---to stop it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As far as I know?&quot; Wes shook his head, &quot;Maybe we can somehow hold on to who we were before. Sometimes, I feel it...kind of start to fade. But I always push back. That I am who I&#39;ve always been. And I am not gonna let this erase my selfhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison nodded somewhat somberly, and said, &quot;If...you ever need anything, I&#39;ll be there. Let me know if anyone else ends up changing, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wes nodded and then went ahead and joined her on the way to class. He nodded and said, &quot;Si. Trabajaremos en esto juntos.&quot; He spoke more naturally in Spanish, more easily. Allison wondered if this might be some effect of the change. Making the new more easily accessible and readily utilized than the old.<br />
<br />
Allison wondered how many people in the school were gonna be undergoing this...and she decided to keep an eye out going into her public speaking class with Wes for anyone who seemed a bit more built or different than usual.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Alex knew he should be to a degree alarmed by all the things that happened in his first period class. But as he looked in the window and saw himself looking almost ten years younger he surmised than he should, with these muscles on such ready display, he just couldn&#39;t be entirely displeased. If it ended here, he would be happy. But what happened, he thought, if it didn&#39;t. He was going to need to wait for his office hours today and hopefully get in touch with Kendall or maybe Allison then. Not for the...less than decent reasons though.<br />
<br />
Every time he thought of them, his thoughts drifted toward the more gutter driven side of his brain. He thought about letting Allison into his office, and then letting her feel his powerful muscles and fuck her hard against the wall. He thought about Kendall, talking with him about these idiosyncracies and things that were wrong...and then having Kendall get facefucked as he sucked Alex&#39;s cock deep into his---oh dear.<br />
<br />
Alex palmed his erect manhood against his leg. He gulped as he registered the height of sensation that he had not experienced in so long.<br />
<br />
Biting his lip a little and thinking unsexy thoughts, Alex waited for himself to calm down and then decided to head out to the teacher&#39;s lounge. He needed to get out, to not stew in his thoughts like this.<br />
<br />
As he headed out, thankfully his next class was next period, he heard some of the senior students chatting about him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, have you seen Professor Clark lately? Now there&#39;s a man who takes care of his body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I&#39;d be checking out a 60 year old. Still, pretty hot dad type.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think he shaves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? His chest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he&#39;d look even better that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re gay for a man who could be your grandad!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex hurried along, gripping his fist tight and hoping he would not have any awkward experiences. Any display that proved so unfortunate would probably prove ruinous to his reputation as a teacher. As he entered the teacher&#39;s lounge, rather than look for a quick snack, Alex found himself gravitating more toward the protein drinks and bars in the vending machines along the wall. He&#39;d usually been good with a quick, less than healthy snack when he came here.<br />
<br />
But now he was finding that his attention was probably better spent on something...healthier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Alex, looking good lately.&quot; Oh! Someone else was here! Alex turned around, hoping he wasn&#39;t sporting wood, and saw that it was William Suarez. Ah, William. About 37, William was muscular already though somewhat more stocky around the midsection - he worked out hard, but dieted horribly. His black hair was styled to hide his receding hairline, and he was known to prefer contacts to glasses to avoid a &quot;nerdy&quot; vibe. It was known generally that William never grew out of his college aged playboy days - though thankfully he was the decent enough sort to keep his affections limited to other teachers, and never in a fashion too unprofessional. Thus, the female teachers here were left regarding him as the equivalent of a cheat meal.<br />
<br />
He was always easy to get, sex wise, even though most likely he was not very good in the long term.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s just some increased gym time, William.&quot; Alex said, buying a muscle drink and some bars for his snack. &quot;You know, I&#39;ve been thinking...of getting back on the dating scene.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, really? Just a few months ago you said you were absolutely not gonna---&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex interjected, &quot;Things change. I&#39;m not gonna be stuck living a morose life. My wife wouldn&#39;t have wanted me to just shut down. So...do you know any dating apps I could use?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you are talking to the right man for that job, Alex!&quot; Suarez was up on his feet in no time, and Alex handed him his smartphone somewhat gingerly, hoping he&#39;d get it back without any viruses or any odd programs installed on it. As Suarez clicked through some screens on the app store, he seemed to grin a little, and then handed it back.<br />
<br />
Alex tilted his head as he saw William signed him up for &quot;MatchUp&quot;, a pretty flirty looking app that had a number of attractive people walking together on the intro screen. If only... Alex looked at William and was rather surprised when his phone showed a questionnaire. William spoke up, &quot;Well, here you go. Just fill out the questionnaire to your best, and we&#39;ll see what happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex noted that even though the app was definitely for straight hook-ups, the questionnaire was very inclusive. And then he got to a question that made him twitch a little with the memory of the time at the gym; HAVE YOU EVER HAD A SEXUAL EXPERIENCE WITH ANOTHER MAN? Alex contemplated what he should do with the app from here.<br />
<br />
William contributed his typical way, &quot;Well? You ever experimented in college, big guy?&quot; A few laughs and Alex pondered.</p>
