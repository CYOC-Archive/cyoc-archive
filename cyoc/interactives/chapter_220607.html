<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Mmmm, I suppose I’ll start with remodeling the plate.” Zach said.<br />
<br />
The rotund satyr spoke in a slow, deliberate manner, drawing out each word as if savoring its taste. His tone was suggestive and alluring that sent shivers down Nick’s spine. Zach extended one pudgy finger and tapped the breastplate with the tip of the hooflet which had replaced his fingernail. It made a light, hollow plinking sound as the satyr contemplated his next move.<br />
<br />
“So, uh, what improvements are you thinking of?” Nick asked nervously, his voice echoing within his empty helm.<br />
<br />
Zach laughed, a deep, throaty chuckle that made Nick’s heart skip a beat.<br />
<br />
“Nick, the magic in you is palpable. Right now, you’re like a clay block waiting to be molded.” Zach explained with an excited smile. “The real question is, what *can’t* I do? Ah, the possibilities.”<br />
<br />
Zach lavender-hued irises glittered as he considered his options. He clopped away softly on his delicate hooves and glanced over the various books on his shelf, then down onto his miniatures, as though searching for something.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” Nick asked.<br />
<br />
“Looking for some inspiration.” Zach replied, picking up the lewd satyr miniature he had been painting idly. “I’m an artist at heart, you know. Please don’t rush me.”<br />
<br />
Nick nodded, his armor creaking.<br />
<br />
“Take your time.” Nick replied.<br />
<br />
“Of course, I-” Zach stopped, staring off into space, his eyes widening. “Wait!”<br />
<br />
Zach’s eyes seemed to shine as though struck with sudden realization and he pulled a notebook out of a drawer in his desk, jotting something down, sketching. <br />
<br />
“Yes, yes, like this. And here-No!” He erased part of the sketch and started over, relaxing, his shoulders slumping. “Like this instead? Yes. Perfection!”<br />
<br />
Nick leaned in, creaking hollowly, but he couldn’t see over the satyr’s rounded shoulders.<br />
<br />
“What are you-?” Nick started to ask, but Zach shushed him.<br />
<br />
“Not right now! I’ve been struck by my muse.” Zach waved his hand. <br />
<br />
Nick stood silently and waited until Zach finished and turned to look at him, the cute satyr’s eyes shining in excitement.<br />
<br />
“Baah~! Let’s get started!” Zach walked over to Nick and placed his hands on Nick’s armor.<br />
<br />
“Uh…” Nick said hollowly, “Are you sure?”<br />
<br />
“Sure?” Zach looked at him, confused. “Of course I’m sure. I’m the frat’s Smith-Enchanter.”<br />
<br />
“The whodawhatnow?”<br />
<br />
Zach snorted ruefully, wriggling his nose in a way that was incredibly cute and animalistic and off-putting.<br />
<br />
“Baah~, of course, I’m not as powerful as the great Merlin or whoever it is that’s selling the magic costume you’re wearing, but I’ve had practice on similar costumes.”<br />
<br />
“Really?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Manny, my former roommate.” Zach grinned, his tufty tail waggling excitedly behind him. “I had completely forgotten about all the experimenting I’d done with him until after I became a satyr. There’s some kind of reality-bending obscuring magic on the costumes.”<br />
<br />
“Manny…Manny…” Nick racked his mind but didn’t recognize the name.<br />
<br />
“Baah~, you wouldn’t remember him anymore.” Zach winked. “That’s magic for you! Anyways, he chose a mannequin costume last month and after a while his parts got mixed up and I was using him as a body size reference when I was sizing some LARP armor my friend commissioned.”<br />
 <br />
A coil of cold dread entwined around Nick’s innards. “You…you aren’t going to hurt me, are you?”<br />
<br />
“Hurt you?” Zach stared at Nick in complete shock. “Baah~! Of course, not, you’re my friend! I didn’t know Manny at all! There’s a big difference.”<br />
<br />
“But you’re a satyr!”<br />
<br />
“And?” Zach arched a brow and stomped his hoof. “What’s that supposed to mean?”<br />
<br />
“Well, you’re all horny and don’t take anything seriously…”<br />
<br />
“We take our hobbies very seriously.” Zach said solemnly. “Music, art, romance…for me, it’s crafting and enchantment. I can take this costume off whenever I wish. I have others in my closet. A minotaur, a akitsune, a human-they’re all my design. I, of course, took notes from seeing Merlin’s costumes and applied his techniques during their creation, but I’m self-taught.”<br />
<br />
“Alright then, I guess.” Nick tried to smile, but realized with his helmet on, Zach wouldn’t know. “Go ahead.”<br />
<br />
“Baah~!” Zach bleated happily and got out measuring tape.<br />
<br />
Nick felt the tubby satyr take his measurements, assess the drawing, and then gently slide his fingers across the thin metal of Nick’s breastplate.<br />
<br />
Multicolored sparks shot from the contact. Nick gasped, the touch electric, infusing his form in bliss. The feeling was akin to a soft, pulsing orgasm rolling through his entire body. It was like being edged with every tap of Zach’s hooflets on his metal surface.<br />
<br />
“So, y-you chose to be a satyr?” Nick managed to gasp through the incredibly delightful waves rolling through him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it keeps things from getting awkward with the bros.” Zach smiled, running his finger over Nick’s helm, making the knight moan. “I really enjoy screwing with Manny, though, so he thinks the minotaur is the ‘Smith-Enchanter’. Can you believe he thinks I lost his body parts? They’re magical! There’s no way I’d mistake them for something else.”<br />
<br />
“Mmm…” Nick groaned as Zach’s fingers splayed across his breastplate.<br />
<br />
The metal groaned along with him as the breastplate slowly broadened, the chest area thickening and deepening. Nick juddered as he watched Zach sculpt perfect slabs of meaty pecs onto his previously shapeless breastplate. <br />
<br />
“Why do you…UNF! Choose to be a Minotaur…AH!” Around Manny?” Nick gasped in between choked cries of pleasure.<br />
<br />
“To put the fear of god in him.” Zach smirked.<br />
<br />
With a pinch, the cubby satyr added nipples to the breastplate, the jolt almost sending Nick clattering to the floor from the exquisitely painful pleasure his touch elicited.<br />
<br />
Zach smiled as he heard Nick’s plaintive moans of ecstasy and moved his fingers downward.<br />
<br />
Nick felt the air whoosh from his helmet as the rounded dome of his featureless metal abdomen sucked itself in. Zach pressed and prodded an, sculpting his torso as the ridges of powerful abdominal muscles rose from the metal. They rippled down to his codpiece, the lines etched with the precision of a master sculptor, the contours perfect.<br />
<br />
“But…isn’t…that…cruel?” Nick panted, his mind fogging with bliss as the waves of nigh-orgasmic bliss and occasional jolt of pleasure rolled through him.<br />
<br />
“Baah~, I’m not cruel! Just naughty.” Zach grinned mischievously. “My goal is actually to turn him back into a human-but using my own enchantments, not Merlin’s. You could call it my Senior Project.”<br />
<br />
Then, with a sly smile, the satyr’s chubby hand began to grope Nick’s codpiece.<br />
<br />
Nick creaked as he went rigid. A bolt of pleasure lanced through him at Zach’s touch. If the satyr’s touch had been edging him, this had taken him all the way over and tumbling down the cliff. He desperately wanted to touch himself, to cum, to relieve the agonizingly *good* feeling as Zach stroked and shaped the formerly shapeless metal pouch.<br />
<br />
The knight was on his tippy toes, groaning loudly by the time the satyr moved on to his legs.<br />
<br />
This time, the feelings were strange and odd. The groans were no longer coming from his helmet, but from the metal as the satyr expertly twisted and pulled the greaves of his armor into strange positions. The metal protested as it was widened and distorted. Several times, when the satyr jerked at his leg, wrenching it backwards, he almost fell. But the satyr always seemed to notice when the knight’s balance was off and quickly corrected it.<br />
<br />
Then Zach was working on his sabatons. Strangely, all Zach felt was squeezing and pinching, the stroking of fingers as his plated boots were remolded before being set back down with tinny clops. <br />
<br />
“Almost done, Nick.” Zach said, standing up and wiping his hands off on his furry pelt. “Just need to make a few adjustments to your helm. This might feel a little weird.”<br />
<br />
Nick nodded. His helm didn’t seem to fit properly on his armor anymore and if Zach could make it fit better, he wouldn’t mind. Zach hands reached up and began to tug and pull at the sides of his helmet.<br />
<br />
Instantly, Nick felt woozy. The thrums of magic was rattling around in his hollow head. It was dizzying, and only more so as Zach gently pulled the metal, curving it into points. The fingers slip and slid over the contour of the visor, sparks flying in a pleasantly tingly cascade. <br />
<br />
His helm widened and broadened, perfectly fitting into the collar of his larger breastplate.<br />
<br />
Finally, the creaks and groans of his armor settled and the room went quiet. Oddly enough, Nick suddenly felt hot, like sweat was slicking his skin. He shouldn’t feel anything at all in the suit but hollow, like the spirit he was meant to represent. Zach smiled up at Nick, his eyes glittering mysteriously. Then he reached up and removed the helm.<br />
<br />
Nick expected to feel nothing, but instead felt cool relief from the hot, stuffy old armor.<br />
<br />
Zach helped him take the rest of the armor off and placed it on his bed. Nick frowned as he looked at the armor. The shape of the legs were completely off, animalistic and alien. He stepped forward to inspect it closer and heard a *clop*.<br />
<br />
He nearly fell over, his sense of balance suddenly off. He cartwheeled his arms, his entire frame feeling large and ungainly. More *clops* echoed in the room and he strove to find his balance, then Zach was there, carefully holding him in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s alright, I’ve got you.” Zach said, before gently turning Nick to face the mirror. “So what do you think of my improvements?&quot; <br />
<br />
Nick&#39;s hooves made a heavy clop on the carpeted floor as he shifted his gaze towards the mirror. His eyes widened in awe and disbelief as he took in the sight before him. The reflection that stared back was not one the jock was familiar with, but one of unbridled masculinity.<br />
<br />
The first thing he saw were his eyes, which had shifted from a dull brown to a piercing blue-gray. The lines of his face were thick and heavy, his brows beetled and his nose wider. There was an air of confidence and self assuredness in his strong features and the thick goatee curling from his face.<br />
<br />
His frame was stout and heavy, each movement filling him with a new found sense of strength and power. His chest was wide and thick as a barrel, his pecs broad, meaty pillows adorned with soft, curly hair. He could practically feel the testosterone burning through his veins as his thick hands instinctively traced the curves of his hefty muscles. Nick marveled at their sheer mass and solidity, reveling in the exhilarating sensations of his own raw might.<br />
<br />
Thick, lustrous golden-brown fur enveloped his lower half. He ran his hands through the lightly curled mass, feeling the stoat muscles of his thighs even through the hair. A big cock and furry balls dangled heavily between his legs, flopping like a windsock with every shift of his cloven hooves.<br />
<br />
His rear was wide and rounded, sturdy and mostly utilitarian. A tufted tail curled up between his thick meaty cheeks, flitting invitingly. There was an odd sense of emptiness in his hole now, one he really only noticed with the twitch of his tailbone. A masculine musk rose from his body, spicy and smelling of autumn leaves and pungent lust.<br />
<br />
Nick stared in awe at his stoat, burly form, running a hand over the short horns that curved from his brow and through his short, shaggy hair. His pointed ears twitched in tandem with his thoughts. Behind him, he could see Zach grinning in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“I…I love it.” Nick said, and was shocked at the deep timbre of his own voice. He brought up a thick hand and ran it over his scruffy throat.<br />
<br />
His hard, hooved fingertips brushed against the contours of his strong, muscular neck. The very sound of his deep, resonant voice, like rolling thunder, reverberated through the air. It sounded like the perfect symphony of strength and desire.<br />
<br />
In that moment, as Nick took in the masterpiece that he had become, he felt an overwhelming surge of desire ripple through his body. He looked at Zach, really looked at him. His inviting smirk, the twinkle in his lavender eyes, the curves of his inviting hips.<br />
<br />
Nick’s thick, floppy cock pounded to attention, jutting from his crotch proudly. <br />
<br />
Zach looked down at Nick’s rigid cock and smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Zach fingers curled around Nick&#39;s, throbbing pole. <br />
<br />
Zach’s touch was electric, making Nick jitter, hooves clattering softly on the rub. The ruff of hair on the back of his neck lifted. Nick panted delightedly as he realized his dick was so thick that Zach couldn’t fully wrap his fingers around his beercan-thick cock. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want to do next, Nick Thickwood?&quot; Zach finished, curling his lips into a seductive pout.<br />
<br />
Something about that last name sounded…off to Nick, but the thought left his mind. He wanted the cute chubby satyr whose touch was setting off explosions of pleasure in his mind. To throw him onto the bed and ravish him.<br />
<br />
Without a word, his expression a thunderous mix of lust and desperation, Nick seized the plump nerdy satyr and pulled him tightly to him. <br />
<br />
His hands trailed over the curves of Zach’s hips, squeezed the satyrs bouncy buttocks. Their lips met and both satyrs let out desperate bleats of desire, making their way over to the bed. Nick practically threw the smaller satyr onto it.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, Baaah~t I wanted to play with Manny this evening!” Zach whined playfully as Nick flipped him over.<br />
<br />
Nick panted hard, staring at the curvy satyr’s fuzzy rump. Zach’s tail lifted, exposing his winking hole, each flit of the tufty appendage wafting a delightful musk into Nick’s more sensitive nose. Nick’s nostrils flared as he took in the scent of a needy satyr, his cock rock hard. <br />
<br />
While the sexy nerd said one thing, Zach’s body language said something completely different.<br />
<br />
“I…I want you to play with me.” Nick panted, his mind a lust-addled mess.<br />
<br />
“Mmm…why don’t you give me a taste?” Zach whispered.<br />
<br />
Nick stared at the winking hole and found himself leaning forward, tongue lapping eagerly at the musky muscled ring of puckered flesh.<br />
<br />
Zach cooed in delight and squirmed, his innards spasming pleasingly around Nick’s tongue. He dove in, slathering the chubby satyr’s depths with his probing tongue. Taking big handfuls of Zach’s well-padded and fluffy buttcheeks, he spread them apart and dug in. The musky buttfur rubbed against his own scruffy cheeks.<br />
<br />
The nerdy satyr bleated in delight as his lover ate him out, his little hooves kicking the air before curling around Nick’s thickly muscled waist.<br />
<br />
Deeper and deeper, Nick pressed forward, enjoying the heavy barnyard scent and savory taste of his lover’s innards. All the while, he could hear the muffled sounds of Zach’s lusty moans. With one last curl of his tongue, ensuring the other satyr’s hole was properly lubed, Nick withdrew, the musky scent of Zach’s hole still clinging to his face.<br />
<br />
Without warning, and with a heave that made the muscles of his thickly corded arms flex, Nick easily flipped the smaller, more curvaceous satyr over and raised Zach’s hooves over his shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Baah~! Plow me hard, babe!” Zach said, trailing his hooflets through Nick’s thick patch of chest fur. <br />
<br />
Nick lined himself up with Zach twitching pucker, then paused. <br />
<br />
He was huge! His cock thick and veiny. ‘Beercan-thick’ wasn’t just an figure of speech when describing the size of his dick. It almost as long as his forearm, and he felt a moment of trepidation, not wanting to hurt the nerdy young satyr below him.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay,” Zach smiled encouragingly, rubbing his finger over Nick’s cock. Nick swore he saw the glans inflate even thicker. “I can handle you~”<br />
<br />
Nick couldn’t hold back anymore and as soon as Zach nudged him, he found himself thrusting forward.<br />
<br />
His cock plunged past the ring, stretching it almost inhumanly. Zach let a out a moaning bleat as his pucker went taut, Nick’s cock just large enough to fill him properly. The sensation of Nick’s cock plunging into Zach’s velvety, inviting depths almost had him cumming like a firehose right there.<br />
<br />
Nick stomped a heavy hoof and let out a bleat as his dick was engulfed in his lover’s moist, warm hole.<br />
<br />
The burly satyr moaned senselessly, lost in the feeling of Zach’s clenching depths. It sucked at his cock hungrily, the muscles rippling and tugging him deeper. He bucked in a lust-fueled haze, letting out a deep *Baaah~!* as Zach’s bountiful cheeks clapped.<br />
<br />
Zach cooed and moaned beneath him. The nerdy satyr’s stubby fingers traced the lines of his muscles and Nick swore his frame was growing thicker and larger. When he was gasping for breath, a whispered word and a gentle stroke across his abs and chest and he had regained his wind, the fatigue washed away.<br />
<br />
The more he buck and thrust, the hornier he became. Zach pulled himself up against Nick’s broad chest, his hands roaming over the muscles in his back. Nick rutted him harder, bouncing him on his mighty rod.<br />
<br />
He was close, he could feel it.<br />
<br />
“You’re so big, so hot,” Zach sighed, his breath in Nick’s ear. “But you’re missing something.”<br />
<br />
“W-what?” Nick huffed, his cock being sucked by Zach’s needy hole.<br />
<br />
He was so close, he’d been edging for the last hour. The air was filled with a delightful scent of satyr love-making, the pungent rank musk of a barnyard. Strangely, though, it was like Zach had been the one riding him, guiding him with a clench or a gentle grope.<br />
<br />
“To be filled,” Zach smirked, and his hand curved around Nick’s rounded butt, his finger deftly plunging deep inside the burly satyr’s tailhole.<br />
<br />
Nick’s eyes went wide, his tail lifting in shock as the finger easily parted his own ring. <br />
<br />
Zach winked and his finger crooked. It prodded something in his bowels and he swore he felt sparks fly as the nerdy satyr’s hooved digit pressed that strangely sensitive button hard. White hot bliss exploded in his mind, all the hairs on his body standing on end.<br />
<br />
“Bah-Baah~!” Nick bleated as an almost agonizing bolt of pleasure shot through him.<br />
<br />
“There we go,” Zach cooed, his finger stroking Nick’s prostate hard, each prod eliciting another flash of bliss that had Nick’s nipples erect and his hooves stamping the floor. “Cum.”<br />
<br />
Nick gasped and bleated, trying desperately to hold back the orgasm that threatened to overwhelm him. <br />
<br />
“It’s okay,” Zach smiled and curled his finger, pressing harder. “Cum for me.”<br />
<br />
Another electric jolt shot through Nick, his entire body tingling. When the burly satyr looked down, struggling to see past his massive pecs, he swore his treasure trail was thicker and more rugged. His teeth clenched as he continued thrusting, not wanting the pleasure to end.<br />
<br />
“Such a greedy satyr.” Zach grinned, slapping Nick’s rear, causing it to wobble heavily. His knuckle flexed hard against the enlarged organ inside him. “Cum in me.”<br />
<br />
Nick couldn’t…he was gonna…gonna…<br />
<br />
“Cum,” Zach’s hooflet playfully brushed his puffier, tender prostate.<br />
<br />
With a roaring bleat and a stamp of hooves, Nick thrust deeper and came hard. His back muscles were rigid, unable to even buck as his cock unloaded cum in thick, creamy streamers deep inside Zach’s bowels.<br />
<br />
Zach pressed against Nick’s prostate even harder.<br />
<br />
The stream of cum built into a torrent and Nick found himself suddenly bucking automatically, the waves of pleasure rolling through him, blocking all conscious thought. Cum slopped and squelched out of Zach’s well-used hole as Nick’s fat dick churned his seed deep.<br />
<br />
“Good…that’s good…” Zach said, his own cock spasming and twitching, shooting cum across his chest and face that he eagerly licked up. “Cum all that human out, Thickwood.”<br />
<br />
Thickwood’s thoughts slowly came back to him as he found himself balls deep in the cutest little satyr he’d ever seen. Baah~! What a catch ! He felt his massive body sweating and his chest rising and falling heavily and realized he must have gotten black out drunk again.<br />
<br />
“You okay in there, Thickwood?” Zach smiled lovingly up at the ruggedly handsome satyr.<br />
<br />
“S-Smith-Enchanter?” Thickwood answered, unsure of what he was seeing.<br />
<br />
He’d always wanted the nerdy little satyr but had never had the courage to ask such a powerful spellcaster out. <br />
<br />
“Just call me Zach.” Zach smiled as he stroked Thickwood’s beard.<br />
<br />
“Baah~! Hey Zach!” Thickwood bleated happily, his voice deep and resonant. Even the tufty little tail that barely cleared his large, round buttcheeks was waggling. “You’re really hot!”<br />
<br />
“Mmmm, I’m glad you like me. I think you’re pretty hot too.” Zach smirked, twirly Thickwood’s goatee between his hoofletted fingers. “Let’s shower. I want to have some fun with Manny before bed.”<br />
<br />
“Together?” Thickwood asked.<br />
<br />
“Of course.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, you and me? Are you sure?” Thickwood said, barely able to comprehend such an honor.<br />
<br />
Satyrs were polygamous by their very nature, that was what the orgy chambers below were for. But to be invited into a satyr’s private chambers and sleep with them, musk-up their bed, was…it was like going steady, in human terms. A real relationship and a commitment, not something most satyrs were even into.<br />
<br />
And with the Smith-Enchanter himself!<br />
<br />
Nick could hardly believe his luck to land such a perfect boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Zach smiled slyly. “You’re basically made for me, Thickwood. You’re my perfect boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
With a happy bleat, Thickwood followed Zach into his shower and they groomed eachother. Then, after standing in the full-body hair dryer for a few minutes, they went downstairs together to have some fun with Manny.</p>
