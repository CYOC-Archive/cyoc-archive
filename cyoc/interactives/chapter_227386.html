<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roxy stared in awe as the sausage patties on her plate and Jimmy J.R.’s sat on pancakes of a similar diameter. Watching the anthro Cougar cub drizzle syrup on the odd combination and then tearing into small mock sandwiches. Looking at her plate she tore into her tiny towers without the sticky sweet concoction slathered on it.<br />
“Don’t forget to have some fruit,” Jimmy S.R putting down a plate for both Oliver and Paul; watching the twin fury wolf cubs smash their breakfast in wild abandon more than eating it. “I’m afraid what will happen if I give them some bananas,” Jimmy S.R. taking a step or two back;  turning around to see Brittany enter the kitchen, laughing as her brothers start to pick at the smashed up mess.<br />
“You two need to have those plates cleaned by the time dad shows up,” Brittany looking at her brother’s displaying a confused look; “or their will be no pudding for later.”<br />
“Pooding,” the two lit up in unison and start licking their plates clean; Brittany turns around and chuckles at the stunned anthro stag-deer as she walked out of the kitchen.<br />
“Anyone want some seconds,” Jimmy shaking his head as both his son and Roxy are looking at him hungrily. <br />
<br />
Stepping out of the kitchen, Brittany smirks as she walks towards the living room. Seeing her son and daughter eating their breakfast along with Sora and Adam; she watches as her mate gets up from the couch and smiles as he heads into the kitchen.<br />
“Is anything wrong,” Alison speaking; sipping on a cup of decaffeinated tea; she heard the commotion from the kitchen and was concerned something was up.<br />
“Nothing that a bribe of future pudding wouldn’t solve,” Brittany sitting next to her anthro cougar fury friend; “but that is dad’s problem for later. I can’t believe you are pregnant,” Brittany changing the subject; remembering the carnal events of last night and Alison showing them a pregnancy test that turned up positive.<br />
“I can’t believe you don’t have an urge to bear more offspring,” Alison putting down her tea; Dusk and Dawn are old enough, surely they can help out after Jake does what he needs to do.” Alison adds with a wry wink.<br />
“Maybe later,” Brittany staring at her twins as they finish their plate of pancake and sausage; “I’m still awaiting for my credentials to become a full time teacher. I want to have a more stable career before I consider going back into heat,” Brittany winking; keeping her voice low so to cubs don’t hear.<br />
<br />
“We got seconds for those that want more,” Jake returning from the kitchen with a plate of more sausage patties and pancakes; “but you need to have some fruit as well.”<br />
“Here is the fruit basket,” Jimmy S.R following his twin brother; he sporting a twelve point rack while Jake kept his antlers trimmed down to a modest four points. Jimmy heads towards Alison and Brittany who both take a pear each; heading towards the cubs who have already loaded their plates with more pancakes. He feels a small paw on his hip as he turns to look down to see a tawny brown fur male anthro cougar cub fury getting his attention.<br />
“Apple,” the young cub looking at the deer fury longingly.<br />
“Well you’re in luck,” Jimmy S.R handing the young cub a small red McIntosh apple to the cub; he watches as the cub tears into the fruit in such a way that he nearly one bites the fruit. Everyone paused to watch Alison’s baby brother inhale the fruit in an almost unnatural fashion. Looking stunned as Adam places the stem and a small sliver of the core back on his plate.<br />
“All done,” Adam bounding up and presenting his empty plate to Alison.<br />
“I can see,” Aliso looking dumbfounded at her brother’s way of eating an apple; “did dad show you how to eat an apple properly?”<br />
“Yes,” Adam looking sheepish before grinning and explaining; “but mom’s way is much more fun.”<br />
“Figures,” Alison unable to contain herself as she explodes into laughter; taking a few minutes to calm herself down as Jimmy S.R. quickly escorts Adam to the kitchen to help him dispose of his breakfast remains.<br />
<br />
“Are those pregnancy hormones or was that just a fit of the giggles,” Brittany looking at her friend as she calms down from her laughter.<br />
“The thought of mom,” Alison chuckling; “hosing down and apple the way Adam just did. Makes me wonder what dirty stuff she and dad are getting up to.”<br />
“It’s the same dirty things we do with our mates,” Brittany grins wickedly while biting into her pear; “only they have the benefit of more experience.”<br />
Alison could not help but burst out into another fit of giggles at Brittany’s response.<br />
<br />
“Aunt Alison laugh is scary,” Dusk pausing in between bites of his sausage and pancake patties; like his sister, they have been smothered in way too much syrup, turning the pancakes into sweet mushy goo.<br />
Dawn doesn’t answer as she just quietly eats; the anthro doe cub was keeping an eye out for the perfect opportunity to strike. Spotting her quarry as it walked and trotted about the house; Dawn make a promise to her cousin Jimmy J.R. That promise was Dicken’s can’t hide forever. Watching the cat walking up to every fury as they headed towards the kitchen before approaching; Dawn watching as the cat sauntered towards her before being scooped up by her Aunt and taken upstairs.<br />
“Dam,” she muttered as Aunt Alison walks back down and takes a seat by the dining room table; looking at Dusk, Dawn scowls as her twin brother prefers to eat his breakfast than conspire.<br />
<br />
“Well I’m done,” Dusk getting up after finishing the peach he chose for his fruit; “can I go outside mom?”<br />
“I suppose,” Brittany not finding any issue with her son wanting fresh air; “just stay in the backyard for the time being.”<br />
Dawn watches as her charcoal grey furred wolf fur brother dashes to the kitchen leaving her alone with a female grizzly bear cub by the name of Sora. Sora never said a single word to her or her brother when she sat down with them; chatting with Adam who was more than eager to answer happily as he stuffed his maw. Dawn saw the looks of disgust heading her way for Sora; she now doubt got her cousin’s side of the story as to why she tried to hurt Dickens. For Dawn it was a simple matter of being bored when they came over one day for a visit.<br />
<br />
Dawn noticed Jimmy J.R. spending more time with a small cat then with her or Dusk at the time. Not sure what to make of it, Dawn would later learn that it was jealousy that fueled her desire to get Jimmy to pay attention to her. Exploring the house and discovering an odd looking device in the washroom; Dawn’s developing brain had no idea she had in her hoof hands an old disposable shaving razor her uncle once used when he was human. Taking the object with her and heading into Jimmy J.R’s room to see the cougar cub napping with his cat; Dusk gets the cat to trust her by gently stroking the animal just as Dusk enters the room. Silently staring at her twin brother she gives him a curt nod as she takes the razor and uses it to strip fur off of the cat while Dusk holds down his cousin.<br />
<br />
Dawn didn’t expect the cat to start yowling and screaming; waking up Jimmy and in turn for him to struggle and cry out for his mother. Seeing Alison burst into the room and seeing her son being held down while she held onto a cat struggling to break free infuriated the anthro cougar; Dawn never saw her aunt move so fast as she wrenched Dusk away from her sin while grabbing her at the same time. Watching Dickens bolt and flee the room to hide while she see her aunt’s wrist’s glow a bright green; causing her and Dusk’s fur to turn pink as they were dragged downstairs to their shocked mother.<br />
<br />
“I need a chance to enact revenge,” Dawn thinking to herself as her thoughts trail back to the present; her plate empty and the banana she picked for fruit eaten, she silently gets up to the kitchen to hand her plate to her uncle before heading back to the living room to watch more television.<br />
“You need help putting on the cartoons,” Brittany watching her daughter struggling to make sense of the remote.<br />
“Cartoons,” Alison watching her friend getting up to help her daughter; “can be reached with the pre-selects I have programed into favorites.” Alison watching as Brittany has an ahha moment as she finds the filter and hands the remote back to Dawn. “With most programs bordering on the lines of softcore porn in the eyes of humans,” Alison speaking as Brittany returns to her seat; “I thought it was best to keep that from Jimmy J.R’s eyes. At least until he is older,” Alison observing Dawn selecting an old Hanna Barbera cartoon of a blue hound dog.<br />
“Of course it’s soft corn porn,” Brittany rolling her eyes; no fury is going to cover up with clothing. The fabric irritates our fur and makes us want to rip it off,” Brittany demurring; remembering the time she started infecting the high school with the furry virus six years prior. Watching as the student body started ripping their clothes off as fur, feathers and scales started sprouting during acts of carnal lust.<br />
“Not that,” Alison smirking; “I’m referring to plots and story lines. “It’s why everything but cub friendly programs have been password protected. While I’ll have no objects to my cub watching an educational show describing gender differences between male and female,” Alison looking at Brittany; “I don’t want him watching a program that displays use of a fury’s genitals in a way that a prepubescent cub wouldn’t fully understand.&quot;<br />
“He walked in on you and your mate rutting,” Brittany smiling at her cougar fury friend; “didn’t he?”<br />
“Are you implying that Dusk and Dawn didn’t walk in on you and Jake,” Alison retorting with a sly grin of herself; watching Brittany’s face contort and her ears collapse and hearing a subtle whine gave the cougar fury the confirmation that such an incident did happen. “Thought so,” Alison responding with a smirk as she starts nibbling on her pear; &quot;its also why we have a sound proof bubble around our room. So he doesn&#39;t hear our moans,&quot; Alison adding.</p>
