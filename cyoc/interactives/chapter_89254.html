<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Di headed out into the night.  She drove her blue beetle aimlessly.  She wasn&#39;t sure where to go; she just wanted to be away from her family for now.  If she stayed with them, she would be tempted to change them, but she wanted their transformations to be slow, and eat at their minds, especially for Mark.<br />
<br />
But where could she go on a Monday night?  All of the good clubs, events, and shows were open on the weekend.  She tried to think where a young college girl would go on a Monday night, and the answer came to her immediately.  Of course!  Students would frequently go to coffee shops on weeknights to study, do homework, and just hand out with close friends in a mellow, calm atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Di headed to the one that her female memory told her she&#39;d been to on many occasions before.  It was a nice shop, kind of on the large side.  It was called &quot;Zoey&#39;s Grounds,&quot; and it had a specific sign out front which read: &quot;Only those who are polite and respectful are welcome here.&quot;  Di remembered actually seeing them throw out some loud assholes one time.  So most people liked the place; it was a somewhere you could count on.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Di parked her car in the parking lot at Zoey&#39;s Grounds, grabbed her backpack, and headed inside.  She stood in line and ordered her favorite drink, a peppermint mocha, and shortly afterward picked up the finished drink.  She looked around for a place to sit, and spotted Margie, who was waving at her.  Di waved back and headed over to Margie.<br />
<br />
&quot;What brings you here?&quot; asked Margie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just thought I&#39;d come do some homework.  You?&quot; Di replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same,&quot; said Margie.<br />
<br />
Di asked politely &quot;How are your dads?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they&#39;re doing great,&quot; Margie replied.  &quot;They were making quite a bit of noise back at the house.  That&#39;s why I came here, so I could concentrate.  It&#39;s really nice how they love each other so much, though.  I&#39;m glad that they are so happy together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Di agreed.  &quot;It might be a little unusual, but what&#39;s most important is that they are comfortable with who they are and happy with their life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right,&quot; said Margie.  &quot;Have they ever told you how they got together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, they haven&#39;t,&quot; said Di.<br />
<br />
Margie looked a little down.  &quot;They haven&#39;t told me either.  I was hoping you might have known.  You&#39;re a little older than me, so I thought maybe you knew my dad before he got together with Rover.  I don&#39;t really know much about it.  I know I was born to a normal mother that my dad knew before, but I guess it was really early on that he discovered he was gay.  I don&#39;t know how he met Rover, but they did tell me once that it was my dad&#39;s idea to act like a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Margie continued.  &quot;I guess it was some fantasy of his, and Rover thought it was a great idea too.  It sure worked out, considering how happy they are.  They&#39;ve been trying to raise me to be dog-like too.  For a while as a kid I hated them for it, but now all I can see is how happy they are.  I want that happiness for myself, and I know they want that for me too, because they love me, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; said Di.  She realized her wish had left a few unfilled holes in the life of Margie&#39;s family.  Di pondered, then thought of some elaborately fun changes to make that would help Margie a bit.<br />
<br />
Di began &quot;Everyone in the coffee shop, except for me, will enter suspended animation until I complete my commands.&quot;  Margie suddenly froze, perfectly still.  Di looked around.  Everyone else had frozen in place as well.<br />
<br />
Di stood up and began walking around the shop.  She counted the number of people, and reached 38, including herself and Margie, as well as employees.  She commanded &quot;Randomly chosen people in this shop, not including me or Margie, will become anthropomorphic animals of the following conformations: 4 will become dogs, 3 cats, 3 foxes, 2 bears, 2 snakes, 2 hawks, 3 cows, 2 horses, 1 elephant, 1 hippopotamus, 1 giraffe, 1 crocodile, 1 swan, 1 tiger, and 1 chicken.  The other 10, including me and Margie, will remain unchanged.  For those who change, your clothing will change to your new size, but will change to become skimpier and will leave your private parts exposed.  This change will happen now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Di looked around the room.  Many people had changed.  There were exactly the numbers of each anthropomorph that she had commanded.  <br />
<br />
She began commanding again.  &quot;Furniture will change size to accommodate the occupant.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Some of the chairs, which had been crushed under the weight of the larger morphs, reformed and became big and sturdy.<br />
<br />
Di continued on &quot;There is now a special elixir that exists that can be added to coffee.  When consumed, it transforms the one who drinks it into an anthropomorphic animal.  The animal they become depends on the variety of the elixir and can be chosen specifically.  How long the effect lasts depends on the number of shots of the elixir.  1 shot lasts for 1 day, 2 shots, lasts for 1 week, and 3 shots lasts for 1 month.  All coffee shops that serve this elixir are like this one in that they only allow polite and respectful people.  The elixir only works when mixed with coffee or espresso, and is well controlled.  It costs no more than a normal cup of an espresso drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Di added more &quot;People regularly come to designated coffee shops to drink this and become anthropomorphic animals.  Some people undergo this transformation only every now and then, just for fun, while others have decided to live their lives as an anthropomorphic animal.  Scientists have been working on making a permanent form of this elixir, but it is a difficult process and no one has done it yet.  People who live as permanent anthropomorphs (by regularly drinking the elixir) are a minority, making up less than 5% of the population, and likewise only about 5% of the population sexually prefer them exclusively.  However, up to 40% of people have tried it on a temporary basis.<br />
<br />
There was more.  &quot;Other people come to these shops because they enjoy the company of anthropomorphic animals, and some people sexually prefer anthropomorphic animals or are open to sexual relationships with them.  These people visit these coffee shops to seek romance.  Anthropomorphic animals generally have a high amount of sexual desire and libido, though they are able to control themselves as necessary.  Society has accepted their existence and they have normal human rights, as well as other societal and cultural accommodations, such as shops, restaurants, and medical treatment available for them.  Anthropomorphs usually wear mostly normal clothing, but they almost always leave some combination of their breasts, genitals, or ass exposed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Di related all the changes to Margie&#39;s family.  &quot;Margie&#39;s dad John came to a shop like this after his wife divorced him early and ran out on her family.  John met Rover, who had already decided to live permanently as an anthropomorphic dog, and the two fell in love.  It was John&#39;s idea to live as a dog, while Rover lived as a human.  This aspect of their relationship is still very unique, but the family found happiness this way, so that&#39;s why they stuck with it.  Margie is here hoping to find a female dog-morph, her preferred mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Di concluded &quot;These changes will take effect now, and everybody in the shop will resume activity as normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
The coffee shop came alive.  Di looked around, admiring her handiwork.  An elephant-man sat at a table with a dog-man.  Their penises were erect as they spoke quietly; they were apparently on a date.  A snake-girl, cat-girl, and hawk-girl were hanging out at another table, apparently just a small group of friends.  Di suddenly realized she had made a tiny mistake: where a man and a woman had been sitting before there was now 2 cow-women.  Also, where there was a guy and girl couple sitting together, there was now a bear-girl and a chicken-girl.  Di had wished that random targets would be affected, but had specified a few female-exclusive morphs: a chicken and a few cows.  Di had inadvertently targeted men with the randomness of the wish.<br />
<br />
Di looked at the menu and realized that choice of sex was part of the elixir, but changing sex carried an extra cost.  Di decided to change this aspect of the wish, because she wanted to keep sex-changing a rare and special thing.  &quot;Choice of sex is not part of the anthropomorphic elixir.  Very rarely, when someone drinks an elixir for a specific morph, their sex gets changed as part of the transformation.  This is rare and usually only occurs with specific morphs.  Most people who have this happen to them avoid that morph in the future, or avoid using the anthropomorphic elixir entirely.  Sometimes, people who have this happen will embrace and enjoy it, even sometimes choosing to live that way permanently.&quot;<br />
<br />
The chicken-girl was talking with the bear-girl &quot;I can&#39;t believe this happened!  I wanted to be a rooster!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; the bear-girl replied, &quot;I&#39;m sure we can still have a lot of fun tonight!  You look pretty hot!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked the chicken-girl.  &quot;Well okay, let&#39;s give it a go.  Maybe I&#39;ll like it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally,&quot; the bear-girl reassured.  &quot;Tonight I&#39;ll have you clucking with joy, and you&#39;ll never want to go back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Di looked around some more, observing other interactions.  There was a card game going at one table.  Two horse-men, a bear-man, a bull-man, and a crocodile-man were part of it.  The bear-man spoke to a group at a nearby bench, consisting of a cat-man, a dog-man, and a fox-man.  &quot;Okay, your bets are in.  Whichever one of you has correctly guessed which of us wins the game will get to have not just one, but all of us in the back room tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
At a booth, a snake-man was speaking with a human couple, a boy and a girl.  &quot;We just wanted to experiment a little, help spice up our sex life,&quot; the boy was saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... my specialty is using both of my cocksss to bang two assssesss at oncssse.  Yoursss will do nicsssly,&quot; the snake-man responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds great!&quot; the girl said.  &quot;That&#39;ll be terrific fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
At another table, a huge hippo-girl was being hit on by a swan-man and a giraffe girl.  By the way things looked the three of them might end up all dating each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Hello?!  Earth to Di?!&quot; Margie was yelling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry!&quot; Di apologized.  &quot;I just spaced out there for a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t spaced out!&quot; said Margie.  &quot;C&#39;mon Di, I know... you&#39;re thinking of trying for some fun tonight!  I had my eye on the barista; she is so cute!&quot;<br />
<br />
Di looked at the barista.  She was a border collie dog-girl.  Obviously Margie was looking for a dog-girl.  Di spoke to Margie &quot;You should try asking her out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know if I can get up the nerve!&quot; said Margie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well with that attitude you&#39;ll never get a girl,&quot; said Di.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you show me how it&#39;s done, Di?  You&#39;re good at this stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Di couldn&#39;t back out now, and she admitted to herself that she was curious.  She made a silent wish to herself &quot;I wish that I am very charming and very good at convincing girls to go out with me or have sex with me.&quot;  Just a little insurance.  Di scanned the room again, then made her decision.<br />
<br />
Di walked over to the cow-women couple.  One was consoling the other.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, honey.  I&#39;ve been enjoying cow-morph for a while now and I thought you might like to try a bull... I didn&#39;t know this would happen.  But hey, it&#39;s not that bad... I have a lot of fun as a cow-woman!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you like big cocks, honey,&quot; the former man said.  &quot;You won&#39;t want to go out with me now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; she replied, &quot;but maybe we can each find our own fun?  I&#39;ve got my eye on that cute hound-hunk over there.  Do you see anybody you like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then Di arrived.  &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said.  &quot;But I couldn&#39;t help but overhear your dilemma.  I&#39;ve been wanting to try sleeping with a cow-girl for some time, and I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ve never had lesbian sex before...&quot; she said to the former man.  &quot;I promise you it&#39;s divine!&quot;<br />
<br />
The former man looked at his wife.  &quot;Go ahead, dear, and have fun!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
The new cow-girl smiled and said &quot;Well we&#39;ll both have a new experience then... let&#39;s go have some fun!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Di and the cow-girl walked toward one of the back rooms.  Di caught Margie&#39;s eye as she went, and winked.  &quot;I wish that the dog-girl Margie asks out will say yes,&quot; she said to herself.  Then she went and had a ton of fun with her first anthropomorphic lover!</p>
