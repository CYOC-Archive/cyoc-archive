<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maxwell makes known to Pryce of Rock and tells him to get things underway. He then turns back to Rock himself, <br />
&quot;Alright... Time fer ya to come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man moves out of the way and Rock finally enters the back room. Needless to say, his high enthusiasm <br />
immediately falls to horror as he crosses upon his friend C.J. strapped on top of a table and fully stripped <br />
of clothing, and a guy collapsed on the floor; both seemingly unconscious. Though perhaps what truly get's his <br />
emotions astir is the one strapped, right next to his friend; his coming son, Monty.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck is this!? Monty? C.J.?&quot; he asks profusely as he rushes toward them. &quot;Jesus Christ, what did you guys <br />
do to them!? Fortunately, he discovers they're still alive; however, this doesn't stop his quelling rage, <br />
especially concerning Vermont. Although the guy has been a huge ass, it truly pains Rock to see him in such a <br />
state. The longer he watches the helpless Monty, the more his anger boils. It pulsated to the point that if he <br />
were to find a scratch on him, bodies would fly.<br />
<br />
Pryce grew agitated upon seeing Rock's reaction. &quot;Calm your nerves, young man. They're simply unconscious. <br />
Vermont is awaiting a modification to his memories as you're friend is in preparation to become part of our <br />
subculture. In fact, he even requested it himself,&quot; lies Pryce.<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? No way! That's a fuckin' lie! He'd never agree to something like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must not know your colleague very well. He specifically vowed to become a bear as it was the best course <br />
of action in order to get close to [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE].&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean!? Has he finally been found?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly; we were informed of his location by a guest who just left. You must've seen one of my employees <br />
carry a young man out not too long ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock recalls the guy who was being carried out; however, he was unable to get a clear face of him at the time. <br />
It also occurred to him what C.J's question meant when he met up with him outside. Perhaps he was considering <br />
turning into a bear after all. &quot;But-but what would becoming a bear have to do with getting close with [INSERT <br />
YOUR NAME HERE]? Why would he even consider such a thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your friend... Has he not disclosed his sexual preference to you at all? You'll be interested to know that he <br />
is deeply in love with this [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE] you speak of. Yes; he is very much a homosexual like the <br />
rest of us in this room. He deemed that if he were to become a &quot;county dweller&quot; such as yourself, he would be <br />
better able to connect with the transformed [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE] and perhaps truly capture his heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't be serious...! C.J.'s really gay...?&quot; Rock had suspected this for the longest, especially from the <br />
glares he would give [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE] at times, but it was never proven. He remembers asking him if <br />
this was the case, but C.J. would always dodge the question. Now that he thinks about it, his stout conviction <br />
of searching for [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE] does seem to imply his homosexuality. Despite that, something seems <br />
off about this stern looking man's testimony. &quot;Wait a minute. Back up for a sec. Who exactly was this &quot;guest&quot; <br />
that told you of [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE] anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cletus Stanley. Perhaps you know of him; he is around your prior age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cletus!&quot; Of course! C.J. had suspicions of him from the get go. He's the most country of them all at school. <br />
If anyone would be connected with [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE], it probably would be him. However, this brings up <br />
ANOTHER question. &quot;Why was Cletus down here in the first place? If he wanted to disclose the location of <br />
[INSERT YOUR NAME HERE], wouldn't it have been a better to stay upstairs rather than bring him down in this <br />
&quot;secret lair&quot;?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pryce finally goes quiet. &quot;...What are you trying to get at with this amateurish display of an interrogation? <br />
Cletus already has wind of the operation we are running.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So? That still doesn't explain why you guys bothered to bring him down here. What's more is that he had to be <br />
carried out. He was probably even unconscious himself, leading me to believe that something happened or was <br />
about to happen to him too.&quot;<br />
<br />
The stern man is rather taken aback by Rock's deduction skills. &quot;If you must know, Cletus made a request for <br />
more Ursamusoxide but we had to promptly refuse due in part to his carelessness which produced your <br />
situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock scratches his head, &quot;Ursam-what...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ursamusoxide,&quot; speaks up Maxwell, &quot;Arctos mixes in that stuff to their products and it's what caused yer <br />
transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Needless to say, Cletus became antagonist after the refusal and we were forced to subdue him. My <br />
subordinate, which you see on the floor, got involved and was put unconscious merely by mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man's testimony is quite solid. Rock can easily imagine hot-head Cletus getting physical when he becomes <br />
angry. It's also reasonable that it would take at least 2 people to restrain him because of his bulk. He <br />
growls lowly to himself as it was all pretty hard to sink in. He then turns to Lester. &quot;What's your opinion, <br />
boy? Did all of this really happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lester wanted to disclose the truth to get back at Pryce; however, because he has Tony hostage, he infers it <br />
would be best to endorse the lie as he doesn't want to see anyone getting hurt over this. He takes a deep <br />
breath and utters, &quot;Yep, Pryce here be tellin' the truth... Yer buddy C.J. really wants to become one of <br />
us...&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite what they're telling him, Rock remains jaded on the manner. Though, perhaps the stern man (Pryce) is <br />
right. Maybe he really doesn't know C.J. as much as he thought. As a non-witness to the events that took <br />
place, his rational is left to acknowledge their story as fact. Rock takes a deep breath before casting a <br />
disheartening glare upon his unconscious friend. &quot;So you really want to become a redneck like me, huh...? Wow <br />
dude; all this for [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]'s sake. You must really love him.&quot; He soon grows silent and slowly <br />
looms his presence over Monty. &quot;And you, boy; Vermont...&quot; For some explicit reason, he's even more concerned <br />
about him than his old friend. Unaware to Rock, but a growing affinity toward Monty is giving rise. &quot;Are you <br />
guys sure Monty is fine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; replies Pryce. &quot;He's in great hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite the assertion, Rock couldn't bare doing nothing as Monty lies in front of him like this. Knowing not <br />
what to do, he simply raises his son's hand and soothingly reassures to him that, &quot;Everything's going to be <br />
alright, tough guy. It'll all be over soon.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lester ponders and questions Rock's awfully compassionate behavior, but says nothing on the matter.<br />
 <br />
Rock gives his son a final shoulder rub and turns his attention to Pryce, &quot;Mmkay; so how's this going to work? <br />
I'm guessing you guys are going to transform some bum off the street and make a &quot;new&quot; C.J. right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pryce glares at Maxwell, &quot;So you told him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yep. My fault Allen,&quot; apologizes the old man as he nervously twirls his beard with his finger. &quot;Ah figger <br />
it wouldn't hurt. In fact, Rock here took it rather well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually about that, ya'll,&quot; chimes in Lester. &quot;I reckon I have a better person who'd filled the role as C.J. <br />
C'mere, pa.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Maxwell discusses things over with his son, Pryce introduces himself to Rock and informs him how the <br />
&quot;switching&quot; process is done. &quot;In order for a subject to take this boy's form, we must first procure a large <br />
amount of his blood from certain pressure points. Next, we administer Ursamusoxide to both subjects and during <br />
the initial processes; we inject the appropriate blood of whom they'll be changing into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it's like some sort of body swap, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps, though their transformation is deduced by how much blood one receives during the initial stages. For <br />
instance; if I were to give - let's say, Graham - a mere amount of your old blood, he may only acquire several <br />
genetic traits and features of yours; all based on chance. However, if I were to administer a vast amount of <br />
your old blood - and only your blood - into Graham at key points across his body, all of his prior traits and <br />
features will become akin to yours, including body structure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...,&quot; mumbles Rock as he attempts to absorb the information. &quot;What'll happen if someone didn't get any <br />
blood at all during the initial phases?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... After a certain period of time, a subject's body will relapse and fall into a continued degenerate state. <br />
Paralysis, bone deterioration, and even brain damage are all possible side-effects. If left to continue, the <br />
subject will eventually perish - quite painfully at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; It's a relief he wasn't left like he was earlier when he snapped against his friends in the bar. &quot;Last <br />
question, if someone used that Ursa-watcha-ma-call-it stuff and already transformed, can they retake it and <br />
transform again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Ursamusoxide only takes effect once and future consumption will have no effect. Once it is taken, a <br />
subject will have around 14 hours or so to administer as much blood as they can to transform. Once this period <br />
ends, Ursamusoxide will pass, further injection of blood will have no effect, and they will be forever fixed <br />
as they are - only changing via natural means.&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon finishing the discussion, Maxwell intervenes and pulls Pryce off to the side leaving a confused Rock <br />
wondering what's going on. &quot;Hey Lest', what's with the secrecy?&quot; he asks, &quot;You know someone who'd want to <br />
transform into C.J.?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, It's uhhh someone me an' my pa been havin' troubles wit' fer awhile now. A recently confirmed pedo,&quot; he <br />
tells him. &quot;It'd be best for us not ta cater to fools like that 'round this joint.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock is a little sickened that the transformation into his friend is being deemed as some sort of punishment. <br />
&quot;I'm not tryin' to defend the guy or anything, but I thought you said all fetishes are okay here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was just a simplified overview. We have limits, ya know. We can't very well support somethin' out right <br />
disgustin' like pedo's, rape, or worse - serial homicides. It'll only tarnish our image.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; agrees Rock.<br />
<br />
Lester pauses for a bit as he wonder if his uncle notices his new-found tendency. &quot;Heheh; I see ya picked up a <br />
habit of fiddling wit' yer beard whenever sumthin's in yer mind, unck. Rightly so; that shore is one hell of a <br />
mane ya got.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; It's then Rock realizes how huge his beard has grown. It's now quite bristly and stretches to the base <br />
of his neck. &quot;Oh wow, didn't notice at all,&quot; he replies as he continues fondling it as if it was second <br />
nature. With each stroke brings a small sense of amusement to the man. At this rate, he wonders how long it'll <br />
become once he fully transforms. He sort of likes the wild look at that. Perhaps he'll never cut it all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon after, Pryce acknowledges the change in plans and Maxwell turns to Rock and Lester. &quot;I'll be back wit' <br />
our &quot;lab rat&quot;, ya'll. Gonna give 'im a real good ass kickin' first though...&quot; he churns as he heads for the <br />
door. Upon opening it, the old man is met with a still disgusted Adrian. <br />
<br />
Maxwell gives him a heads up before leaving, but Adrian doesn't stall and immediately comes forth to Pryce. <br />
&quot;Cletus is in his truck now..,&quot; he sternly voiced; of which, is still not in his usual up-beat lispy tone. <br />
&quot;Alright, I done what I had to do, now hurry and -&quot;<br />
<br />
Pryce interrupts Adrian by calmly placing his fingers over the furious man's mouth and shakes his head. He <br />
then leans forward close to Adrian's ear and whispers, &quot;Your role isn't finished. Do not speak of the incident <br />
nor our plan lest suffer the consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, Tony's husband could do nothing but clench his teeth and growl irately.<br />
<br />
Pryce then calmly sits down at a nearby seat and motions for Rock to come near. He then professionally clasps <br />
his hands before beaming fiercely at Rock. &quot;Now then, your transformation into a rightful member of the <br />
Maxwells and also into the subordinate manager of the Triple Crown will now commence. Isaiah, or as you are <br />
called now, Rock; I will not remind you of the sacrifices that you will or may have already faced. Are you <br />
fully prepared to undertake such a new existence; to be wholly reborn as a member of our subculture; as a <br />
homosexual, aging man born and raised in the southern countryside miles away from urban society; as a father, <br />
brother, and an uncle? Rock; do you wish to become a bear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock looks back at Lester and the two exchange smiles and thumbs up. He then returns his attention to Pryce <br />
before coming to his final decision. &quot;HELL YEAH! I'm so psyched for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
In spite of Pryce's usual cold and stern persona, he couldn't help but to break forth a compassionate smile <br />
upon seeing Rock's bursting enthusiasm. The sudden smile is enough for Lester to gag in disgust at the rare <br />
sight. Though, what lasted as a breath of fresh air; Pryce swiftly shifts back to his usual demeanor as he <br />
calls for Adrian. &quot;Adrian! Commence the next step of his transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian, who is at his husband's side, stays quiet and leers vengefully at Pryce before making his way toward <br />
Rock. &quot;Alright you. Keep still,&quot; he demands as he removes his gloves. He then opens his suit and pulls out a <br />
flamboyantly covered pink CD from an inside pocket. Images of flowers, rabbits, and even poses of Rainbow Dash <br />
from the &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic&quot; cartoon series engrossed the front side of the disc in its <br />
entirety.<br />
<br />
Rock's face prunes as he holds back his laughter and raises an eyebrow, &quot;What the-? Ahahah, is that the <br />
complete 1st season of My Little Pony or something?&quot; he chuckles. His laughter immediately comes to an end as <br />
Adrian sends forth a terrifying glare his way. The man's eyes beam a spine-chilling cherry blossom pink <br />
leaving Rock to clutch his chest in dread, as if something pierced its way through his very heart and soul. <br />
Lester himself had to turn away as he to fell victim to such a display of malevolence; even at his position.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you not to move, boy. I'm in no mood for disobedience,&quot; threatens Adrian. His hand's - as well as the <br />
disk - glistens in a ghostly shroud of pink. &quot;Now, DON'T. MOVE.&quot; Adrian's eyes burst forth into a dazzling <br />
array of pink, and then he fiercely shoves his open palm against Rock's forehead. An aura of pink encircles <br />
Rock's skull and he becomes completely immobilized; as if he was frozen in time. Pryce and Lester observe <br />
vigilantly as a stream of wiry pink energy slithers outward from Rock's head. Then, it rapidly travels through <br />
the air and engross the disc in Adrian's hand. This bizarre show of events continues for about half a minute <br />
until finally the aura subsides. Adrian pulls back and wipes the sweat from his forehead while Rock regains <br />
control. &quot;Whew. It's been a while since I've done that,&quot; he says; his voice gradually returning to normal.<br />
<br />
Rock stares in complete disbelief; his heart pounding heavily. &quot;What...what did you just do to me...!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't done a thing to you yet. All I did was take a copy of your personality and wrote it to this re-<br />
writable disc.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my power; &quot;Carnation Characterize&quot;. I'm able to give people who are under the effects of Ursamusoxide <br />
new personality traits or change current ones to how I see fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock grows silent and scratches his head. &quot;...Um... I don't understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian shakes his head. &quot;[*sigh]. You're born to be a Maxwell alright; big, handsome, and a bit clueless. <br />
Here, it's better if I show you.&quot; He leads Rock to a nearby computer, pulls up a swivel seat, and sits. &quot;Now <br />
watch.&quot; Adrian then inserts the still glowing disc into the DVD drive. &quot;When I insert my CD into a computer <br />
while it has someone's personality written on it, a program which was created from my ability begins to run <br />
from off the disk.&quot; A splash screen of the bear flag with a bear claw and Arctos's logo appear in sequence <br />
before the program itself finally pops up. Adrian then cracks his knuckles before taking hold of the mouse. <br />
&quot;Alright, now from here; I'm going to click this, and a huge HUGE list of all of your personality traits, <br />
memories, likes, and dislikes begin to load onto an easy to navigate database; oh, and also this cute 3D <br />
picture of you appears on the right-hand side here.&quot; Adrian playfully zooms in on Rock's crotch, and with a <br />
touch of the mouse, toggles continuously between a flaccid, semi-erect, and fully erect manhood; much to <br />
Rock's embarrassment. &quot;Mmm... my my; uncut and almost 9 inches fully erect,&quot; he comments as he lightly punts <br />
Rock's crotch area. &quot;Your one lucky dog; bears will come in droves to have a ride on your merry-go-round.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh, thanks...&quot; Rock thought this day couldn't get any weirder. First, it's a popular homo hangout in the <br />
middle of no where; then came a substance that transforms people; and now a magic/program that can alter <br />
people's personalities. Nothing is impossible with Arctos it seems. Despite it all, he wonders what else these <br />
guy may have up there sleeve. &quot;How would you actually go about giving me these changes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All I would have to do is save the adjustments on the disk, abstract the data with my power, and then use my <br />
power to apply the changes to your brain. It's nothing too hard. Though, in order for me to do that, you'll <br />
have to be asleep. Once your Ursamusoxide passes, I won't be able get at your personality anymore. It's just <br />
how it is.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rock inadvertently begins stroking his beard once again. &quot;That explains why you can't just use your power to <br />
alter Monty's personality...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, Vermont. Speaking of him; although I'm not able to change the way he acts anymore, we ARE able to at <br />
least change his memories. That's where um... &quot;he&quot; comes in,&quot; he churns as he points at Pryce.<br />
<br />
The stern man steps forth. &quot;I possess a similar power called &quot;Azure Alter&quot; that can alter people's memories <br />
and force them unconscious if I so will it. Vermont, your friend, and the man you see before you on the floor, <br />
Anthony, are currently under the effects of my power. Once your physical changes are complete, I will adjust <br />
Vermont's recollection as necessary. Upon his next awakening, he will fully view you as his biological <br />
father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock examines his future son and crosses his arms. &quot;You know, I have this gut feeling that my personality is <br />
going to be tampered with ALOT...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; responds Pryce. &quot;In addition to your position in the Maxwell family, you must come to wholly <br />
consider yourself as his biological father and he your legitimate son. This specific altercation is of utmost <br />
importance. There must not exist any fault of these relationships within your psyche.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock is dissimilar of the idea of having his personality changed extensively. Not only does it sound robotic, <br />
but it deviates from truly calling a personality one's own. A transformation of that magnitude would <br />
practically &quot;erase&quot; him. He wouldn't be him anymore, and judging from Lester's word's earlier, he wouldn't <br />
want to have that for his nephew. &quot;Can't we just tweak my current personality around?&quot; he asks as he takes a <br />
quick glance at Lester. &quot;There's alot about me that makes me - well - ME and I'd like to keep those traits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian speaks up. &quot;Sorry. The plan is to use a personality I've been fashioning specifically for you while you <br />
were at the compound. What you can do though is - with your help - change around the planned personality some <br />
based on your current one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;However, do not assume this means we'll conserve any of your current memories,&quot; adds Pryce. &quot;You must fully -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah... I get it already you, chill.&quot; Rock is relieved knowing that he'll be able to keep at least some <br />
of who he is; but still, it goes against what Lester believes. He tries to ask him what he feels about it, but <br />
instead his nephew's reply is a mere grunt as he focuses on a Manga. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright big guy,&quot; exclaims Adrian. &quot;Pull up a chair and let's see what we can compromise.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Rock does just that, and afterwards the two of them begin to scroll through his personality, declare <br />
suggestions, and make some changes. As time pasts, he begins squirming unevenly within his seat. After several <br />
minutes of this, he could no longer bear it and turns to Lester. &quot;Hey; where can a bear go take a piss around <br />
here?&quot;<br />
<br />
His nephew says nothing and just points at a door across the way. <br />
<br />
Rock gives his thanks and immediately aims for the bathroom. Once inside, he slides to the toilet, hastily <br />
unravels his shlong, and let's himself go. During his business, he heedlessly snorts and grunts as a squeak of <br />
gas escapes him. He then digs in the back of his boxers with his free hand to alleviate an inch from upon one <br />
of his furry ass cheeks. Once almost finished, he wiggles his penis to exhaust any leftover urine, and returns <br />
it to the safe confines of his boxers and sweat pants. With that out of the way, he turns to the sink to clean <br />
himself; however before turning on the faucet, he takes another good look at himself in the mirror. Not much <br />
has changed since he left the compound, though he does note some differences. His now thick mustache <br />
completely hides the top of his lip and came to connect to his vibrantly brown shaded beard. The hair on his <br />
forearms and the back of his brawny hands seem to be more defined as well. He also notes a small increase of <br />
dark freckle-like spots across his face, chest, back and arms. Rock wholly disregards further hand-washing, <br />
gets into a thinking pose, and strokes his mighty beard. The feeling of his fingers grazing among his coarse <br />
mane sends a chill of arousal down his spine. He then takes his other hand and begins caressing his luscious <br />
pelt.&quot;Talk about woof,&quot; he mumbles with a smug expression on his face. He then starts squeezing his own nipple <br />
as he continues to fondle his beard. Upon noticing his growing bulge, a masculine grunt filled with bliss <br />
escapes him before ushering out a growl. <br />
<br />
In the midst of such arousal booms a series of fierce banging from behind him. &quot;C'mon already, unck!!,&quot; shouts <br />
Lester. &quot;Ya ain't tha the only one who gotta go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock snaps back to reality, quickly rinses his hands, and smears them clean against his sweat pants. Upon <br />
opening the door, Lester trucks through him. &quot;Outta my way&quot;, he says. Just as Rock makes his way out, Lester <br />
grabs hold of his hand and quietly tells him to shut the door. Once together in private, Lester turns to face <br />
his uncle. &quot;Um... unck, Listen... your personality, I... I already knew they were going to change it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock crosses his arms and groans. He wasn't surprised at all. &quot;You did, eh? Geez, here we go again... Why do<br />
always have to hide things from me? I thought we were buds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'Course we're bud's, unck. I jus' - I just didn't want ya ta freak, is all! Ya may not believe it, but I... I <br />
came to care fer ya a great deal. I don't want nuthin' stoppin' ya from 'comin' part of my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lester...&quot; Not only are his nephew's words shrouded in distress, but his expression is wrought with worry. <br />
Rock opts to not further indulge the issue. Instead, he felt the need to comfort him. &quot;I understand,&quot; he <br />
consoles while rubbing the back of his nephew's shoulder. As before, he could sense his admiration of Lester <br />
diverging into a strong degree of family kinship. For both his and Lester's sake, he wouldn't have it any <br />
other way than to become this boy's uncle. Though this revelation begs the question, &quot;How am I going to keep <br />
being me - like you want - if my personality and memories is going to be changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... about that; truth be told, I ain't got the slightest clue. Though, I reckon if'n ya stay true to <br />
yerself to the very end, somethin' might sprung up. Ya never know. Heck, ya may even be able to fight off them <br />
changes. I don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...&quot; Rock ponders as he strokes his own beard, but comes up with nothing himself. &quot;Well whatever happens, <br />
you can bet that big Rock here will take good care of ya. I'll make sure I become the glue that bonds us <br />
Maxwells.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unck...&quot; Lester pauses before happily nodding and smiling. &quot;Yeah! You do that. Thanks old man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock laughs heartily as he ruffles his nephew's hair. &quot;Ghaha! I'm an old man to ya already, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh shucks stop it. Hehe!,&quot; Lester playfully shoves his uncle's hand from off his head. &quot;My fault; it just <br />
slipped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, don't worry 'bout it, boy!&quot; he says as he pulls him close. Never before has he felt such compassion <br />
toward anyone. Despite Lester being his nephew, he questions whether this is how a fatherly bond feels like. <br />
Indeed, Rock is ready to give it his all to care for his nephew: to protect him; to nurture him. What's more <br />
is that this compassion feels so natural to him. The same could be said of his feelings towards Graham. <br />
Calling each other &quot;bros&quot; felt quite genuine. Then there's Monty, his son. He hasn't spent any time with him <br />
at all, but he somehow came to realize a special bond between each other; a domineering but compassionate <br />
connection. Even at this very moment, he's greatly concerned of his well-being. His heart aches knowing his <br />
boy is in such a condition. How can these emotions be possible? His personality couldn't have changed yet, nor <br />
does it seem that Ursamusoxide stuff been influencing him. He just naturally came to this outlook, and so fast <br />
at that. As he lovingly looks at his nephew wrapped around his arm, he comes to a sound theory. &quot;Lester, some <br />
how I think... I think I really WAS supposed to be your uncle, boy. Don't get me wrong now; I'm not sayin' it <br />
'cause I'm transforming. It's just that I got this strange feelin' at the back of my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lester smiles tranquilly. &quot;I'd believe it,&quot; he adds. &quot;No offense to ya n' all, but it be weird how fast I came <br />
ta see ya as part of the family. Heck, at first I couldn't picture ya as my unck at all. And shucks - let's <br />
not forgit tha way ya coped wit' Vermont. You were rightly treatin' that lug as if'n he were yer kid. I don't <br />
get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me neither, but I guess it doesn't matter. I'm with my true family now and that's what's important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Darn tootin', unck!&quot; Lester dives in and gives him a warm hug. &quot;Y'know, I be thinkin' yer old life musta been <br />
some sort of slip-up or sumthin',&quot; he claims. &quot;Yer a Maxwell through and through; I see that now. Ya musta <br />
always been, but never realized it. Don'tcha agree?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock fondly wraps his arms around his nephew's waist as he smirks and tenderly looks down at his eyes. &quot;Of <br />
course. I wonder why I wasn't born in my right time amongst my real family. If only things went the way they <br />
should've, things would've went differently for us. I could've been there right alongside my bro helping are <br />
kin whenever they needed us most; when you needed me, boy... I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't 'pologize, unck. It ain't yer fault. Like you jus' said, none that matters now. We're gun' finally set <br />
this reality straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right!&quot; Rock opens the door, but before he steps out he thanks his nephew for the talk. &quot;You really mean the <br />
world to me, Lester. Thanks for everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nutin to it,&quot; he replies before finally turning to the toilet and unzipping his fly. Once Rock exits and <br />
creeks the door close, Lester's plump member spouts forth. Then as his urine began to rain on to the water, he <br />
begins pondering to himself in his head. &quot;Since our middle school days, I always had felt sumthin' between us; <br />
a connection, sort-a-say. But I'll be - to think it was this though. Tonight must be more than jus' a <br />
coincidence I bet; it has ta be fate.&quot; He tries as much as he can to hold back his tears. &quot;I'm so happy things <br />
turned out this way. Know what, I reckon I'll go ahead an' get that uppity ol' fool (Pryce) to change mah <br />
memories too.&quot; Lester then notices his full erection. &quot;Well lookie here... Gosh o' mighty, unck; yer killin' <br />
me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Back within the room, Rock returns to his seat next to Adrian; however, just before sitting he lets out a <br />
hoarse sneeze. &quot;ACHOO! [snort] Urrg...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay big guy?&quot; asks Adrian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, someone must be talkin' 'bout me, I guess. ACHOO! Uggh... man...&quot;<br />
<br />
After Rock wipes his nose clean, the two of them recommence adjustments of his new personality. Upon Rock's <br />
request, Adrian copies his current likes and dislikes to his new one, and then inserts a new trait: &quot;Family <br />
Man&quot;; which consists of a liking to each of his &quot;real&quot; family members (as Rock puts it), and a disliking of <br />
&quot;bitterness and neglect&quot; among his family. Adrian make sure to fine tune that trait so Rock would be very <br />
protective and would always put his family first before himself, much to Rock's satisfaction. Afterwards, they <br />
continue tweaking his likes and dislikes based on what his memories will have to be, or &quot;What they've <br />
should've been in the first place&quot; according to Rock. The stout Maxwell then takes notice of a strong <br />
preference to red meat listed on the personality and his stomach begins to growl. The mere thought of a well-<br />
done T-bone steak or a slither of fine cut Roast Beef makes his mouth water. Come to think of it, he hasn't <br />
had a full-course meal for quite sometime now.<br />
<br />
Lester, whom has long returned from his potty break (and masturbation session over a certain someone), over <br />
hears his uncle's cry of food and immediately offers to get him a plate, &quot;Ya hankerin' fer sum grub, unck?&quot; he <br />
asks as he pockets his manga. &quot;I'm pretty famished here mahself. I reckon we still got some stuff left from a <br />
git together not too long ago. I'll go fetch us a plate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do, boy. I'm nearabout ta die of starvation here.&quot; Rock gives his hairy gut a scratch as Lester <br />
proceeds to leave. However, before his nephew makes his exit, Rock reminds him to, &quot;Gimme a cold can of beer <br />
from the fridge while you're at it. I don't care what ya get s'long as Im able ta put some alcohol in my <br />
belly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shure! Anythin' fer you, old man!&quot; Lester then gleefully heads upstairs with a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you, Adrian right?&quot; Rock asks as he turns to him. &quot;Mind supplyin' this poor old bear wit' sum tobacco? <br />
If'n ya got any that is.&quot; Once again, Rock tries his best to imitate a true southern accent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Old bear, hmm?&quot; chuckles Adrian. &quot;My, I see you're really getting into the role.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; replies Pryce as he approaches with a box of 3 thick Cuban cigars; robusto-sized with a ring gauge <br />
of 50 at that. &quot;With your current frame of mind, the transformation will go smoothly as planned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This ain't no act to me anymore, ya'll...,&quot; he remarks with great confidence as he pulls out one of the <br />
cigars. &quot;I'm reclaimin' the life that should've been rightly mine from the get go.&quot; The &quot;old man&quot; attempts to <br />
use a zippo lighter (given by Pryce), but fails several times. After he vents, Pryce lights it for him <br />
instead. Rock then puffs and exhales the cigar soothingly and doesn't hesitate to fill his system with <br />
tobacco. Unsurprisingly, a surge of relaxation pulses within every fiber of his being. Not only did he enter a <br />
mild state of bliss, but he felt at harmony with the very fat cigar in his mouth. The stench of his second-<br />
hand smoke surrounding him smelled so good and felt so appropriate. In turn, he begins to reminisce of that <br />
pleasure-filled dream he had about his son earlier. Rock fully believes that the Ursamusoxide was showing him <br />
his real self at the time. That little event had to been a vision of his actual life; that is, if he had born <br />
in his right time. Wearing nothing but a kinky leather get-up and chains, flaunting his body piercings, <br />
smokin' a fat cigar as his sweaty boy gives him the dirty; to hell with that black kid Isaiah, that manly old <br />
fart was him all the way. He knows for a fact that's his true life. Rock sets his cigar in a nearby ashtray as <br />
he churns in his seat - longing for the existence that was justifiably his. &quot;God dammit; I can't this take it <br />
anymore! Hurry up wit' mah transformation!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your preparations are ready,&quot; claims Pryce as he firmly lays a hand on his shoulder. &quot;However, I have a small <br />
endeavor for you. Come.&quot; Rock follows the stern man and arrives at his former friend's side.<br />
<br />
Pryce then fixates on a pair of latex gloves and passes a pair of gloves to Rock. &quot;What're these for?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please slide them on, Rock - if you would.&quot; As Rock does, Pryce draws forward a tray with a steel plate full <br />
of empty syringes on one side, and a plate containing 2 large syringes on the other. One is filled with blood <br />
and the other is filled with a distinctive green fluid. Pryce then takes hold of an empty syringe and holds it <br />
out to Rock. &quot;I've decided to bestow you the honor of administering the Ursamusoxide to your former comrade.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock eyes broaden beyond belief. &quot;Hold the f up, guy!,&quot; he shouts; instantly breaking his fake southern accent <br />
once again. &quot;I'm NOT going to be the one responsible for this! Why can't you do it!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no need cause protest. Remember, this is how your comrade wants it. As his past colleague, do you not <br />
want to aid him in his request; or is it that you feel content with letting a stranger, such as I, fulfill the <br />
deed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock shifts his eyes nervously and doesn't return an answer. Annoyed, Pryce shuts his eyes and groans. He then <br />
moves forward, though Rock backs away with a frightened look on his face. &quot;Please, don't make me do this...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; yells Lester as he returns with two plates covered in aluminum foil and 2 cans of Heineken beer. &quot;If'n <br />
mah unck don't want ta do it, than don't force 'im to!&quot; <br />
<br />
As Rock is happy to see his nephew is back, Pryce glares angrily at the boy before retracting his arm. <br />
&quot;...Very well. I'll commence the procedure.&quot;<br />
<br />
In spite of the fortunate turn of events, a growing heartache begins to take form from within Rock. He was <br />
instantly reminded of the pain he endured back at the bar; though, it was substantially less excruciating. Not <br />
soon before it begun, something in his head begins to churn as well causing the scenery around him - or more <br />
precisely, his vision - to warp. The closer the syringe was to C.J; the more severe the ache and the more his <br />
heart pounded.<br />
 <br />
Right away, Lester could see his uncle's distress. He sets the items on the table and rushes to his aid. &quot;Hey, <br />
ya alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of his beating heart clouded his hearing; becoming more and more deafening as the needle closed the <br />
gap between it and his friend. As soon as the syringe grazed C.J's skin, Rock could no longer bear it and <br />
shouts, &quot;WAIT!&quot; Everyone, including Pryce, staggers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is something the matter?&quot; asks Pryce as he surveys the heavy breathing man before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll... I'll do it...&quot; he mumbles, much to Lester's surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What happened, unck? Why the sudden change o' heart?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock begins covering his hands with the latex gloves. &quot;It's the chaw... The pain from earlier came back. <br />
It's... it's telling me that I have to do this.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ah yes; the &quot;pain&quot;,&quot; speaks up Pryce. &quot;You may not have realize, but this &quot;pain&quot; you talk of is merely a <br />
byproduct of your own inner conflict. Whenever &quot;you&quot; - your physical self - is at odds with your &quot;heart&quot; - <br />
what you truly aspire -, tension within yourself builds; more commonly known as a form of stress. As you <br />
should be aware, stress is something we as human beings frequently suffer. Ursamusoxide, during the initial <br />
phases at times, takes this tension and substantially increase the after effects of it; hence your &quot;pain&quot;. <br />
Recall your rabid addiction? That was in result of you not adhering to what your heart truly wants. You were <br />
forcing yourself not to do something, perhaps in that case chew tobacco, when you really wanted to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lester's eyes widen as this is the first he's heard of this. &quot;Seriously? Then how come he weren't all in pain <br />
when he was whining 'bout becomin' gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian chimes in, &quot;Either because he and his heart truly didn't want to be gay, or because that particular <br />
effect of Ursamusoxide was subsided at the time. It's an after-effect that randomly comes and goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lester scratches his head. &quot;Ah see. So my unck here be wantin' ta transform his friend, but is forcin' himself <br />
not to, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Precisely,&quot; says Pryce as he once again reaches the syringe out to Rock. &quot;Will you now adhere to your hearts <br />
desires, Rock?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock pauses before taking hold of the syringe.&quot;Yeah...&quot; Upon turning and facing downward at his C.J., he <br />
begins questioning his own moral character. From the moment he realized what he was to become; he pondered the <br />
idea of his friends becoming bears alongside him. The idea escalated into a hidden desire when C.J. presented <br />
that odd question to him on the surface. In truth, he became rather glad upon hearing about C.J.'s decision to <br />
become part of the subculture. Not only that, but he had to admit that his bro's idea to help him on his <br />
journey to incorporate others into our kind sounds rather appealing. However, the morality of such temptations <br />
caused his inner feelings to be at odds. On the surface, it's not morally right; but he knows it's what his <br />
heart truly wills for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; calls Lester. &quot;I know ya gots a lot on ya, but try 'n git yer mind outta that there gutter. Ya ain't <br />
the bad guy here, unck,&quot; he says as he glares at Pryce. &quot;Just go wit' the flow and follow that big ol' heart <br />
of yers.&quot;<br />
<br />
That adorable lug truly means alot to him. He always knows the right words that'll cheer him up. Honestly, if <br />
it wasn't for Lester's support, he most definitely wouldn't have come this far. It's at this point where a <br />
strong resolve to stay much more true to his heart blooms forth; his expression now showing his determination.  <br />
&quot;Thanks, boy,&quot; he replies compassionately. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; praises Pryce. &quot;That's the conviction I expect of a man of your caliber. Now, heed my instructions <br />
carefully. Apply the syringe at this point on his neck and extinguish his blood, SLOWLY.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock follows Pryce's directions and continues forth with the procedure with great caution - drawing blood from <br />
different arteries along his friend's body. Eventually, several syringes full of C.J.'s blood lined the tray <br />
behind him. Now it's the moment of truth as Pryce hands him the Ursamusoxide filled syringe (the green one). <br />
Rock takes a deep breath and gives a moment of silence before finally instilling his friend with the <br />
concoction. Once finished, he steps back and removes his gloves. A rather strong weight has now lifted from <br />
his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent,&quot; approves Pryce; giving the man a firm pat on his wide back as a reward. &quot;We'll proceed with his <br />
induction once I finish gathering decent blood samples from various bears. Do not worry. You're friend is in <br />
good hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock merely smirks and nods in response. Everyone was right - he felt more at ease once he carried out what <br />
his heart had wanted. He surveys his Arctos colleagues and realized he had come to be just like them; a gay <br />
bear willingly transforming others into gay bears - but without the crazy powers of course. Coincidentally, he <br />
felt a connection with his teammates and the procedure. It felt good, and it felt right. After some pampering <br />
from his nephew, Rock is notified by Pryce that, &quot;The time has come,&quot; and follows him. Pryce shows the man up <br />
a small podium and asks him to remove the rest of his garments. <br />
<br />
As Rock does he takes notice of his very bristly thighs and legs. His feet too are in no short supply of body <br />
hair with them having a sparse but noticeable trail of hair along his dorsums, and little tufts of hair on top <br />
of his toes. He's proud he turned out to be one hairy son-of-a-gun - just like he was meant to be.<br />
<br />
Pryce carefully examines Rock at each of his areas and notes how refine his transformation is proceeding. Even <br />
he is astounded of the strong aptitude between Rock and the Ursamusoxide. He is a very interesting specimen <br />
indeed. If he hadn't had accidentally stumbled across Ursamusoxide as early he did, Arctos would've surely <br />
taken note of him later on in life. &quot;Hmm, you say your existence should have been that of a Maxwell from the <br />
beginning, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep! I have no doubt that's the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting... Tell me, what makes you come to this conclusion?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock doesnt hold back and tells him everything: his dream; how fast he came to view Lester, Graham, and Monty; <br />
how quickly he got used to being homosexual; his bursting adoration of all things hairy, including himself; <br />
even the thrill he gets drinking alcohol, smoking his big cigar, and helping transforming others into bears.<br />
<br />
Once all is said, Pryce thinks to himself calmly. After several seconds, he speaks up, &quot;This is a first. <br />
Perhaps the phenomena you're experiencing is as you say. A recovering of a lost existence... I see there is <br />
still very much we don't know about the Ursamusoxide. Rock; your experience tonight is certainly one of a <br />
kind. Arctos would surely benefit from such information.&quot; Pryce bows. &quot;On behalf of the company, I thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock blushes. &quot;Wh-Why are you bowing to me for? It's me who should be thanking you guys. None of this would've <br />
happen if it wasn't for that wonderful Ursamus stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; smiles Pryce. &quot;When all is said and done, perhaps you would be eager to accompany me to Arctos. We <br />
are in need of capable bears that are willing to bestow our &quot;passion&quot; to the masses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't even try, you!&quot; protests Lester; inadvertently spewing out small droplets of barbecue from his mouth as <br />
he eats, &quot;My unck is stayin' right heer wit' us! Ain't that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gahahaha! You heard the boy, Pryce. It's a nice offer, but I have a family I gotta watch over. 'Sides, I <br />
really want to help my bro out in his career. Don't worry; I'll help spread our &quot;love&quot; through him, hmhm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that is your wish, very well. I'll contact Arctos and notify them of your request for membership in due <br />
time. For right now, please spread your arms and legs out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock does just that, and Pryce follows up by grabbing hold of the final syringe: the large blood-filled one. <br />
&quot;In this lies the blood of not only Graham but Vermont as well. In addition, we've augmented this to include <br />
the D.N.A of Graham's deceased parents. If everything goes accordingly, you're genetic, muscular, circulatory, <br />
and bone structure will alter; aging you, and bequeathing you the body that should've been.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All that's good n' all, but I'm still hungry!&quot; whines Rock as he watches his nephew eats. <br />
<br />
&quot;You will be able to quell your hunger once I am finished. However after your meal, I must promptly lay you <br />
unconscious on top of this open bed. Eventually, you will commence bone modification and the resulting pain <br />
will be unbearable. I'm certain your transformation within the gym was quite excruciating as well, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... It felt like my whole body was on fire. I passed out from it. Oh, and what about my skin peelin' <br />
off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That only occurs when transforming between races of vastly differing skin pigments; i.e. white male to a <br />
black male, or vice-versa.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock let's out a relieving breath of air. &quot;Cool beans. Anything else, I need to know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at this time,&quot; replies Pryce as he nicks the syringe's needle and approaches Rock. &quot;Are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep! Put it in me!&quot;</p>
