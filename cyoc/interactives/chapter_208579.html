<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finn felt such an array of emotions from the previous day that he wasn&#39;t able to sleep very well. Everything just felt so much like a dream all of a sudden. When he woke up, he went to his phone. The Chronivac was still there. He let out a deep breath. Followed quickly by a squeal. His fox tail wagged exceedingly fast as he thought about the power he had in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breakfast!&quot; Dave called through the house. <br />
<br />
Finn hopped out of bed and headed downstairs. When he&#39;d changed his dad into being a football player for a few years, he didn&#39;t quite realize the other changes that would come along with it. His income must have rose dramatically because the house they were living in had doubled. It was another thing that made sleeping a bit hard as he wasn&#39;t used to his room being so large or having so much stuff in it.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen his dad was dumping out two scrambled eggs for Finn and then making himself a much larger batch for himself. Sweat covered his coarse fur as he swayed back and forth humming as he cooked. Finn could smell it from the other room. But it didn&#39;t really bother him. He knew his father liked working out in the morning. Even more, he liked doing in nothing more than some skimpy little shorts that clung tightly to his large ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Morning bud,&quot; Dave said as Finn walked in. He gave a bit of a wave with the spatula. His little ram&#39;s tail wagged happily as he went back to cooking.<br />
<br />
Finn took his seat at the island in the kitchen and started eating his breakfast. It was hard to keep his eyes off the wide back of his father. The man had always been fairly broad, but now it actually looked like there was muscle under all that fat. Not to mention him being quite a bit taller made those broad shoulders and thick arms all the more powerful looking. Each one seemed to flex with even the slightest bit of movement, showing off just how strong they were. Even if he wasn&#39;t defined or cut like Jeff or Mike, Dave was clearly someone you didn&#39;t want to mess with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got something on your mind bud?&quot; Dave asked as he turned around, dishing out his own breakfast. He was just as impressive from the front as the back. His firm belly and thick pecs made him all the more attractive. Just because Dave wouldn&#39;t be on the cover of some fitness magazine, didn&#39;t mean that he wouldn&#39;t have been in the fantasy of numerous people who looked at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no,&quot; Finn choked a bit as he felt his father sit down next to him. The man&#39;s arm looked to be at least twice as thick as his. <br />
<br />
Dave eyed his son suspiciously. &quot;Alright,&quot; he ignored the feeling and went back to his breakfast. &quot;So whatcha doing today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Web design at 9:00 and then probably meet up with Jeff after that,&quot; Finn said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? You&#39;re finally making a move?&quot; Dave gave him a nudge.<br />
<br />
The orange juice in Finn&#39;s mouth went right back into his cup. &quot;Uhh... No?&quot; he coughed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure... Sure...&quot; Dave rolled his eyes. &quot;He&#39;s a good guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Finn nodded. He finished the rest of his breakfast as quickly as he could. Not wanting to answer any more questions, he grabbed his bookbag. &quot;Bye dad,&quot; he said giving the big ram a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;See ya later,&quot; his dad said.<br />
<br />
Finn rushed out to his car. He still felt embarrassed. Even if it felt like his dad knew that he was gay, he didn&#39;t want his dad to know that he was gay. It was such a weird emotion running through him. All these feelings for men had manifested and he just didn&#39;t know how to tell anyone about them so he ignored them. But now with Jeff being so forward, he didn&#39;t feel like he could hide them anymore. Finn agonized over it all the way to his college. When he pulled up into the garage he took a deep breath. &quot;Just ignore it...&quot; he told himself and then headed to his class.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
The web design classroom had 26 computers set up in rows to the back of the classroom. Finn found himself being the third student there with the teacher looking over the computer up in front of the classroom. The 30 something year old man was still getting used to teaching, but had a pretty good grasp on how to keep the class at least a little bit interested while also going through the book. Though, he did look like a pretty nerdy guy. Despite being nearly 6&#39; tall he had almost nothing tough looking about him at all. His body wasn&#39;t lean, it was thin. Barely an ounce of muscle on him at all. Even worse, he was starting to gain a bit of a belly. The shirts he&#39;d clearly been wearing for the last decade were starting to ride up on him a bit more than they had, and his pants didn&#39;t seem to fit quite right either.<br />
<br />
Finn took his seat in the second row and pulled out his phone. Minutes ticked by as he thought about what he wanted to do. He knew the device worked, but still wanted to play around with it a bit. He pulled up the other student&#39;s bios to check on them, but a bit of guilt ran through him as he didn&#39;t know just how much their lives would change. But when Mr. Thomson stood up in front of the class, Finn felt like he knew his target. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning class,&quot; Mr. Thompson pulled down the projection screen. He spun around and Finn went to work. &#39;Mr. Thompson is a massively muscular well endowed virile bull man who wears shirts that are a bit too tight for him. He doesn&#39;t realize how tight they are until he gets to class and they rip off his body.&#39; Then hit enter.<br />
<br />
Just like last time, Finn was amazed to already see the changes. It was barely even a few seconds, and he could already see dense muscle starting to build onto his professor. His arms were already starting to fill out the navy blue polo he was wearing. Thick shoulders widened his framed. As he went through the slides, his body stretched to the ceiling. Every bit of his body started to grow longer.<br />
<br />
Mr. Thompson pulled at his collar as his neck widened. Finn couldn&#39;t help but notice his fingers were starting to merge together. The tip turned black and looked harder than a normal nail. Soon he only had two fingers and a thumb with a thick black hoof on each appendage. His hands only widened and grew as they looked like they were able to lift heavier and heavier things. Deep callouses formed on the bottom of his hands from at least a decade of heavy lifting.<br />
<br />
Coarse brown fur was rapidly starting to fill in on his skin running up and down his powerful looking arms. Mr. Thompson was really starting to look like a bodybuilder as his massive arms filled his sleeves and the buttons on his polo were starting to stretch under the weight of his growing pecs. But his waist didn&#39;t change much at all. If anything a belt appeared around his waist as it stayed so trim, but with how thick his quads were becoming, it was obvious that he couldn&#39;t find the proper pants for them.<br />
<br />
Or maybe it was what was between them as a massive bulge looked to be straining the sipper as much as much as the buttons on his shirt. With his quads touching, his balls and dick had to be pushed forward slightly to not get crushed. And with how Mr. Thompson was wobbling while he walked. That might have been as his shoes disappeared and the bones in his feet were changing. Dark callouses appeared at the bottom of his foot and then continued upward, only making his foot more hoof shaped.<br />
<br />
Mr. Thompson kept teaching as though nothing was happening. Only pausing slightly as though he had a bit of a sneeze coming on. His nose shifted and stretched as the nostrils grew unbelievably large, then started to emerge from his face into more of a long snout. It was the same with his mouth as his jaw extended out as well. He gave a strange blow through it and Finn could see two blunt sets of teeth filling his mouth completely. Mr. Thompson shook his head as the urge to sneeze dissipated, but in doing so two massive white horns erupted from his skull.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; Mr. Thompson uttered for a second grabbing at his head. The distraction was enough that he didn&#39;t notice the long ropey tail emerge from his back side or the small little tuft of hair at the end. &quot;Sorry bout that class. Got a bit of a headache. One second.&quot; He shook his head again and then flexed his body not realizing just how tight that polo had gotten. A loud rip filled the classroom and no one but Finn reacted. He let out a heavy breath through his nose as Mr. Thompson grabbed the shirt and tore it completely off him. &quot;Damn it...&quot; he cursed. &quot;Not again... Anyways,&quot; then went back to the lesson.<br />
<br />
Finn&#39;s eyes remained glued to his wide defined back and the hefty amount of beef on his front. It was the first time he&#39;d spent all class staying awake, but that didn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t paying any more attention to what was being taught.</p>
