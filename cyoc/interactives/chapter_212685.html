<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I think you should become an animal,” Bruce says, “THAT most certainly would convince me of this so called “power” of this program.”<br />
<br />
David nods, he pulls out his phone and opens an App, “to transform someone or something, you need to scan the “target”, which you wish to transform, first. Since I already scanned myself, all I need to do is open the animal package and choose the desired animal, so: what type of animal should I become,” he asks, “just so you know, I don&#39;t want to ruin my clothes, which would mean... .”<br />
<br />
Bruce nods, “I understand,” he says, he then thinks for a while, “since we are both “Horse people”, you should become a Horse.”<br />
<br />
David nods, “okay, what type of breed,” he asks as he opens the “Horse Package” which lists off all the known Horse species.<br />
<br />
Bruce thinks for a while, “well, since we are in America, how about an American breed?”<br />
<br />
David nods and opens the correct file, “any type of breed in mind?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Bruce says, “I have always found those horses they use in western movies magnificent.”<br />
<br />
David nods, “the American Quarter Horse,” he says, “good choice, okay... what color should my coat be?”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm... I kinda like black,” Bruce says.<br />
<br />
David nods and selects the color, “okay, that&#39;s set, before I confirm the change, let me set it so I am still able to speak like a human, that way we can talk until I return to normal.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good,” Bruce says, “how long will it take for you to transform into a horse and back?”<br />
<br />
“It can be instant, or I can set the time of the transformation to take an hour. The duration I can set to, let&#39;s say also an hour?”<br />
<br />
Bruce nods, “agreed,” he says.<br />
<br />
David smiles, “okay, just a few more edits, I really do not want to have the transformation being painful.”<br />
<br />
Bruce watches as David types away on his phone, after a few minutes, David seems to be ready, “all set, David?”<br />
<br />
“All set,” David replies, he then confirms the transformation, “okay, I better strip... pardon me in advance,” he adds.<br />
<br />
Bruce shrugs, “I since I know that you are becoming an animal, I HOPE, I&#39;m fine with seeing a other guy naked.”<br />
<br />
David chuckles and starts to strip, he then feels a tingling run through his body, causing him to shiver, “I guess I&#39;ll never get used to that,” he says, already topless and moving to undo his pants.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah,” David says, “when you transform into something, a pins and needles sensation runs through your body. This signals you that the transformation is starting, and you only have a few seconds to get to an area suitable of what you are becoming. Like a garage, if you transform into a car, a stable, if you transform into a farm animal, and so on.”<br />
<br />
Bruce looks at the now naked man in front of him, “I don&#39;t see any changes yet,” he says.<br />
<br />
David chuckles, “patience,” he says, “I can feel my skin starting to itch, this should mean that my fur should start to grow,” sure enough, Bruce notices David&#39;s body slowly turning black as hairs sprout from every inch of the man&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
“Holy...,” Bruce exclaims, he watches with wide eyes as David&#39;s hair turns from gray to black, styling itself into an mohawk style, lengthening and soon resembles a mane, the man starts to groan as his muscles and bones pop, growing and rearranging themselves. His face starts to push out into a muzzle, his ears become pointy and migrate to the top of his head. David&#39;s tummy bloats, his arms and legs slim, his hands and feet turn black and hard, his toes and fingers fusing together, soon resembling hooves. David looses his balance and falls forward, he lets out a groan when he lands on his front legs, his body then starts to grow, his huge muscles slowly looking more and more natural as they move into their rightful positions. Bruce then notices a long black tail growing from the transforming man&#39;s butt. David&#39;s cock erects and the skin fuses with the skin of his tummy, becoming a big sheath, the head of David&#39;s cock lengthens and thickens, soon resembling a horse cock, which retracts into the sheath.<br />
<br />
After an hour, there is nothing left of “David the human”, and a big American Quater Horse Stallion has taken his place, the horse&#39;s head bowed as it pants, “man... that was tense,” the horse suddenly says, his voice sounding richer and deeper. David looks up and then down at Bruce, a grin on his face when he sees the other man with open mouth and wide eyes, “well, convinced,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Bruce is so shocked that he can&#39;t speak for a while, “holly mother of horses,” he then finally breaths, “it actually worked?!”<br />
<br />
David the Stallion laughs, “I told you so,” he says, “so, how do I look?”<br />
<br />
“You... you look amazing,” Bruce says, walking around the “Horse” taking in every angle, “a real trooper.”<br />
<br />
“Now you are just being flattery,” David says, swishing his tail, he then chuckles, “this is the first time transforming myself into an animal, and a Horse at that.”<br />
<br />
Bruce walks back in front of the talking horse, “how do you feel,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“I feel fine,” David says, “it&#39;s just a little weird. Even though I am a 50 year old man, this body has so much energy, I feel as if I were 30 if not 40 years younger. Being a horse really is amazing, give me a minute, I got to get some of this energy out of my system,” with that the “Stallion” lets out a neigh and start to gallop around the clearing.<br />
<br />
Bruce watches in amazement, “holly crap,” he says, “you are one fast Horse!”<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, David slows down and walks back to Bruce, “that felt good,” he says, sounding satisfied.<br />
<br />
“Man, this is so weird, talking to a Horse,” Bruce says.<br />
<br />
David chuckles, “well, I figured it&#39;ll be easier to discuss stuff until I transform back.”<br />
<br />
Bruce nods, “so, you have me convinced,” he says, “so, this App... it really could return Sahara to her prime age of six or seven years and make her fertile again?”<br />
<br />
David nods his huge head, “more than likely,” he says, “if it can transform me into this stud, it can do so much more!”<br />
<br />
“Man,” Bruce says, scratching his head, “if that program gets into the wrong hands, it could create so much chaos and damage!”<br />
<br />
David nods, frowning, “well... we can&#39;t stop that, I guess with every new development there will always be risks we will have to live with.”<br />
<br />
Bruce nods, “welp, me and you will only use the App for good, right,” he asks with a smile.<br />
<br />
David nods, smiling back, “so, are you going to download the App?”<br />
<br />
“I sure will,” Bruce says, “let me do that right now,” the man takes out his phone and soon finds the App, he downloads it and installs it. After the installation, Bruce decides to scan himself, “you never know,” he says, David and he grin, “I mean... IF I am unable to find the perfect Stallion to breed with Sahara...,” he trails off, grinning up at his new found friend, blushing a little.<br />
<br />
“Hehe... tired of being a dad to a human?”<br />
<br />
Bruce shrugs, “not really,” he says, “but I am a person who loves to experience new things, and with this App I can do what ever I desire!”<br />
<br />
David nods, he then becomes serious, “just remember: with great power comes great responsibility,” he says, “just don&#39;t let the power get to you, if you know what I mean.”<br />
<br />
Bruce nods and raises a hand, “I swear on my life,” he says.<br />
<br />
This seems to be good enough for David, who smiles, “so, I guess you should head back to your son,” he says, “are you going to tell him about your plan?”<br />
<br />
Bruce shrugs, “I might... I might not... not sure yet,” he says, “a part of me would want to let him know, the other part however would want to surprise him.”<br />
<br />
“What if he does not want Sahara to be bred,” David asks.<br />
<br />
Bruce grins, “nothing that this magic App can&#39;t fix,” he says.<br />
<br />
David swishes his tail, “that... would be wrong,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Oh... come on, David,” Bruce says, “it&#39;ll just be a little bit of manipulation, nothing serious, besides we really do need the extra money.”<br />
<br />
“I understand,” David says, “but you should consider messing with your son&#39;s mind as the VERY last choice.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah,” Bruce says, “don&#39;t worry. Hey, let&#39;s stay in contact, we could meet up from time to time and have some fun, what do you say?”<br />
<br />
David nods his head, “sounds good,” he says, they share phone numbers, David then says, “I have one request: I would like to see myself.”<br />
<br />
Bruce nods, “sure, hang on,” he says, he opens his camera and turns it so David is able to see himself.<br />
<br />
“Damn, you weren&#39;t kidding,” David says, “hehe... I guess I really have turned out great.”<br />
<br />
The two say their farewells and Bruce heads back to meet up with Dean, while David stays in the clearing until he transforms back.<br />
<br />
“Dad,” Dean calls when he sees his dad returning, “where have you been?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I met a guy and we took a walk and discussed, some stuff,” Bruce says.<br />
<br />
“What,” Dean asks, sounding worried, “I hope nothing about wanting to sell Sahara!”<br />
<br />
“What? No,” Bruce says, “we simply discussed horses and which are the most amazing breeds, which breeds make the better competition horses... stuff like that.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Dean says, he relaxes and smiles, “I was worried. Sorry... I am just so hyped of winning.”<br />
<br />
Bruce smiles, “all thanks to Sahara and your training,” he says, patting his son&#39;s head, “what do you say we take Sahara back to the farm and then head out for a meal as a celebration?”<br />
<br />
“HELL YEAH,” Dean shouts, so after loading the “Mare” into the trailer, they all head back to the farm.</p>
