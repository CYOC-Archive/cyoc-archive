<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A woman screamed. It took John several seconds to realise the noise was coming from himself or should that be herself? He looked at his hands - well they were not his hands. They were a female hands but they were the only hands he currently had. With those hands he felt his chest. It was soft and certainly not the chest he had yesterday. He was wearing a brassiere!<br />
<br />
He stood up and realised he or was that she, had shoes with heels on them. Then with dread reached down and felt his crotch through the skirt he was wearing. It was empty! There was nothing between his legs! &quot;Oh Doc! What have you done?&quot; A woman&#39;s voice came out of his mouth. He recognised it. It was the doctors voice. It all came back to him. He put two and two together and realised what must have happened. The doctor had somehow put his brain into her body!<br />
<br />
He looked across at his own body. Still handcuffed to the chair. It was sleeping or was that unconscious? Was the doctor now in his body? Why would she do that? Irrespective he/she walked across and shook the apparent janitor. His old head just lolled. What ever the doc had injected his body with had knocked him out.<br />
<br />
There was a noise behind him. He turned to see the monster apparently looking at him/her. He flinched. It was no longer in its cage! He picked up the nearest thing he could find - the chair he had awoken on. He used it like an old fashioned lion tamer and herded the animal back into it&#39;s cage. He quickly shut the door and flipped the latch. The creature made some incomprehensible noises. Clearly it was not happy.<br />
<br />
Relieved that at least for the moment he was safe. He went to the desk drawer where he had observed the doctor had put the keys to the handcuffs she had put on him yesterday. He found them and went across and released his old hands and legs. &quot;Wake up Doc!&quot; he said in his womanly voice. &quot;You need to fix this&quot; Unfortunately all undoing the handcuffs achieved was to allow his old unconscious body to slip off the chair and sprawl onto the floor of the lab. He found that in this weak female body he did not have the strength to lift his old body back up. However he/she was strong enough to rearrange his old limbs so that at least the body looked more comfortable. Even a splash of water could not wake the sleeping body.<br />
<br />
He had the awareness to go and ensure the door to the lab was locked. He didn&#39;t want anyone coming in here and finding him as he currently was. To his relief he found the door was already securely shut. He glanced back at the creature in the cage. It sounded angry and was grappling with the lock on the cage door. Thinking quickly John used the handcuffs like a padlock and secured the cage door.<br />
<br />
Now what to do? All he could think of was that he needed to wait for the doctor who he assumed was in his old body to wake. He was also curious about his current situation. Was he really a female? All the evidence he could see was that somehow he and the doctor had swapped bodies. That made him a 40&#39;ish female. Was there a mirror somewhere? He wanted to look at his reflection. There would be a mirror in the toilets just down the corridor but at the moment he didn&#39;t want to risk being seen by anybody else. From the clock on the wall he saw it was 8.45. The corridors of the institute would be teeming with people by now. <br />
<br />
He saw the doctors handbag on a cupboard behind her desk. With his knowledge of woman (which wasn&#39;t a lot) he guessed she might have a mirror in the bag. He could remember his mother certainly did. She would use it when touching up her makeup.<br />
<br />
The doctor had gotten him into this mess so damned if he was going to respect her privacy. He went across to the handbag, emptied its contents onto to the doctors already messy desk and looked for a mirror. Sure enough she had a small mirror in a make-up thingo that opened like a clam shell. Eagerly John had a look at his face. <br />
<br />
He was the doctor! He was 100% the crazy doctor who had created the monster. It was her eyes looking back at him. He could see nothing of his former self in that reflection. He glanced to his old body apparently sleeping on the floor.<br />
<br />
The creature was still making aggressive noises. He tried to remember from where the doctor had found the syringe she had knocked him out with. Yes! There was the empty syringe in the special disposal unit. But what had she injected him with? It was from that fridge in the corner! He trotted across and opened the fridge only to be confused from seeing multiple types of potions inside. <br />
<br />
It was only then that he recalled the doctor had said she would leave instructions on her iPad. There it was on the desk covered in the contents from the handbag. He pushed aside the mess and snatched up the tablet. He knew how to start these!<br />
<br />
But he needed a password! What was it again? No she had written it down! Where was that scrap of paper? It had been on top of the iPad but he had just scattered all the junk. He picked up and scrutinised every bit of paper on the desk. It was at least a minute before he found it. &#39;Doctorpeggy&#39;. That was quite clear and now he recalled that was the password she had mentioned. But the iPad was looking for a numeric password! What the hell?<br />
<br />
He sat down on the doctors chair in despair. He glance at his old body lying on the floor, then at the noisy creature in the cage. At least it was no longer rattling the cage. It seemed to be more interested in playing with it&#39;s genitals. It was masturbating! It was licking its pink penis! Disgusting!<br />
<br />
He sat there for what seemed like hours but was probably only 10 minutes. He was tempted to undress and check out the body he was wearing. But he had always respected women and considered that to do so would be an unacceptable invasion of her privacy. He contented himself with cupping his breasts and feeling his hard nipples through her satin shirt and apparently lacy bra underneath.<br />
<br />
He was disturbed by the doctors desk telephone ringing.</p>
