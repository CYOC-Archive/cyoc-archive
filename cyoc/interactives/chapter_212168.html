<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wandered the field over the next couple of hours eating and chewing. After his adventure through the woods and that creek, his body was hungry and demanded food. As he grazed, he had noticed the fence was without electricity. But try as he might, he was unable to get himself away from this instinctual duty to maintaining his body&#39;s weight. And so, he was forced to continue eating this field&#39;s grass. <br />
<br />
Head dipping low. Mouth opening. Teeth grabbing blades of grass. Tearing the grass with the noise ringing in his big ears. Head coming partially up, but never all the way. Big sloppy tongue rolling the slimy saliva-covered green plant around his mouth. Big ugly teeth chewing. The entire time, the body he was stuck with in his vision as a constant reminder of what he was.<br />
<br />
Hooves and legs as he had to dip his face towards his food. Only way he could ever eat. There would never be any sort of civilized gripping of food to bring to his face. He had to bring his face to his food. A constant wound to his pride. <br />
<br />
His broad, gray-carpetted flanks and the occasional view of his tail anytime his head raised slightly for chewing. A constant reminder of his size and physical inability to ever stand on two legs again. <br />
<br />
Chewing. Chewing. Chewing. Swallowing. Head dipping. Sight of his front legs and hooves. Grass tearing. Tongue slopping. More chewing. Sight of his broad gray-colored furry flanks. <br />
<br />
No way to tell time. To Jeff, this may as well lasted an eternity. He&#39;d occasionally &quot;haaww&quot; in a sigh. Wanting to cry. But being forced to dip his head yet again towards the earth. <br />
<br />
After eating to it&#39;s heart&#39;s content, Jeff nodded off to sleep standing up. All four legs automatically locking into place. His ears tall and broad, instinctually moving and twitching atop his head. He was in a strange and unfamiliar place, so this is how he sleeps. Again, by instinct. <br />
<br />
Who knows how long Jeff was asleep like this. 6 hours, maybe? To Jeff, he was completely disoriented when he began to arouse. It was dark. Why was it dark!? How long was he asleep!? He tried stretching. He couldn&#39;t lift his arms! Wait a second! He was already on his feet!<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaawww!&quot; He said out loud. &quot;Oh no....&quot; He thought, as his continuing nightmare began to sink in. His brain able to &quot;feel&quot; the general shape and position of the body it possessed. Slowly blinking his eyes, he lifted his head and looked around. Terrible night vision. He was pretty much completely blind! Just a dark shadow shape his rump made, and some unfocused little dark orange light that he couldn&#39;t make out over there somewhere yonder to his right.<br />
<br />
He was so incredibly disoriented, to the point where it felt like he was on a merry-go-round. He wasn&#39;t a donkey. But he was. Wasn&#39;t he? He sure &quot;felt&quot; like one.  Where was he? Perhaps he was dead and this is what death was like?<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww,&quot; he said again. Words unable to escape his brain. He tried looking at himself, but even that was pointless. His eyesight was atrocious. But the aromas we&#39;re what was rousing him from his confused wakening state. That, and the gushing noise of even the slightest breeze through the field of grass he could smell he was in. Those two senses were what was beginning to ground him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhaawww!&quot; He said again, still not quite fully realizing he was, in fact, a donkey. A donkey stuck in a dark field in the countryside of England on the other side of the Atlantic. <br />
<br />
He felt a force suddenly grip him, as his head dipped low on its own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaawww!&quot; He exclaimed, just before he practically buried his big fat black nose into a bunch of grass! Took a bite of grass that overwhelmed his human thoughts:<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Not this! Not grass again! I can&#39;t eat another bite-!&quot; But he did. He had to. He was forced to resume grazing once again.<br />
<br />
He chewed on the same slimy substance he had been chewing on for hours on end during the day. And so, with head still low to the earth, big fat tall ears perked up atop his head like a couple of large satellite dishes, Jeff&#39;s body went to town on the grass. He&#39;d be puking if he were human and in full control of his own body. This was all he had been eating for the past......for the past.....3 days? 4 now?<br />
<br />
Uh. Oh. Jeff was beginning to lose track of how long he had been a donkey! For he WAS a donkey! Nothing but a fucking donkey! He was sick and tired of this damned body! But there was nothing he could possibly do about it. It was what he now was. Nothing but a stupid old donkey! Couldn&#39;t speak. Couldnt read. Couldnt write. Couldn&#39;t play video games. Not ever. Couldnt even eat in a civilized manner! Even MONKEYS had fingers. Hell, even RODENTS could use their tiny little &quot;hands&quot; to eat with. But not Jeff the hunan-minded donkey. He had nothing with which to ever be able to grip anything, except with his clumsy large mouth. <br />
<br />
This kind of aroused him, though. He WAS a donkey, and had been so for the last several days at least. It sucked how trapped he had been. But it livened up his sexual fetish. All his life consisted these past few days, was eating and being fucked twice by a fellow male donkey.....<br />
<br />
A &quot;FELLOW&quot; male donkey! Another wound to his pride. He was on the same level as a farm beast. Lower, even, as he was the bottom of a homosexual relation with a &quot;fellow donkey&quot;! He&#39;d allowed himself to be dominated sexually by a much-lower-ranking species! One incapable of complex thoughts!<br />
<br />
Another thing was, Jeff knew how many sexual encounters he&#39;s had. But no longer knew how long he had been stuck as this damned donkey! Like being unable to speak, donkeys had no use for time-keeping beyond what their own biological clocks told them what to do. Like grazing and fucking. As a donkey, Jeff would have no use for &quot;time.&quot; No use for dates. Days of the week. Holidays. All of those things he would have no use for beyond his own human curiosity. What day WAS it? How long had he been stuck on all fours? Those would be questions that would forever remain a mystery for his human thoughts. Hell, even his knowledge of what year it was would fade from his memory. Nobody would think to come out and tell some donkey what time or date it was. And even if he ever spotted a clock, he had lost the ability to read. Even numbers he would no longer recognize. He was completely illiterate! Those abilities purged from his brain, as donkeys have no need for such things, just as they have no need for speaking. Or for fingers. Or for standing upright.<br />
<br />
Jeff would still somehow retain the ability to think like a human. And in actual words in his mind. That was part of his driving force for his fetish. To still completely retain himself mentally, but just stuck with the body of a simple donkey who had no way of communicating with the human world. <br />
<br />
Throughout the dark period of blindness, he was slowly becoming more and more aroused. His gigantic donkey dick once again beginning to demand attention. Being forced to experience the full-blown natural life of a donkey; grazing, pissing, shitting, fucking, and fear as a prey animal near the bottom of the food chain. The force that forced him to obey the natural instincts of a donkey that took away his human will and control over the very body it inhabited for long periods of time. That &quot;force&quot; gave him the full-blown experience of what donkeys do. Of how they live. Jeff had no escape from this situation. Not ever. He knew it. It&#39;s what&#39;s driving him crazy now as he tries to grab his dick, to no avail, once he was finally finished grazing as light was beginning to peak in the broad dark skies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhaawww!&quot; he mournfully brayed, as the light was quickly beginning to increase for the new day dawning. A new day to live as a fucking donkey. A new day as humans went about their business. Including his far-away family he&#39;d never see again. Who would have no idea he was even missing. <br />
<br />
The mournful noise that harshly leaves his throat in place of words, captures the moment of building frustration for Jeff. All his frustrations going directly to one location:<br />
<br />
His humongous smelly black dick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww!&quot; He says again. Once again, trying for words that will never come. <br />
<br />
Wanting to stretch his hands and fingers, an experience denied to him for the better part of a week. With new iron horse shoes attached to his blocky hooves, the unnatural weight of them an even stronger constant reminder he had no hands or fingers that he could ever stretch. But he had the itching feeling that he NEEDED to stretch them! <br />
<br />
He slammed his hard front right hoof on the ground with a wordless &quot;heeee hhhaawww!&quot; <br />
<br />
The words &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a donkey!&quot;floating around in his mind as a mantra.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a donkey!<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a donkey!<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a donkeeeeeee-&quot; &quot;heeeeeeeeee hhhhhaaaaaawww!!!!&quot;<br />
Scraping the earth with his fingerless, handless right hoof. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, god!&quot; he thought, as his sexual desires were really building up. Contributing even more to his current helpless frustrations. He looked around at the shadowy lumpy shape of his body extending far back behind his field of vision. He looked at his hooves. Back and forth, driving home his reality. He was trapped! If only he could just....stand up! He tried bucking himself up on his hind legs, just for the force of gravity to pull his front legs right back to the ground where they belong! <br />
<br />
He bucked up again, feeling his huge dick hardening in growing and growing frustration. He felt his giant sagging balls wobbling around, and even beginning to tingle! Balls filling with thick milkshake-like donkey jizz! The thought of the DNA his body contained fueled him even more!<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a donkey! Oh god! I&#39;m a god damn donkeeeeyyyyy!!!&quot; Heeeeee hhhaawww hhheee hhhaawww heeeeee hhhhaaawww!!!<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t take it! This growing sexual feeling was beyond more intense than anything he&#39;s ever felt before! Well. Not quite. He had reached this point twice before. But those experiences faded from his memory as he became utterly stuck in the current moment! <br />
<br />
He was stuck! He couldn&#39;t even buck up and down anymore! His entire body had become completely rigid on all fours, as he began to &quot;scream&quot;. &quot;Heeeeeeeeee hhhaaaaaawww hhheeeee hhhaawww heeeeee hhhhaaawww!!!&quot; His mind an explosion of completely pent-up pure sexual frustration! His dick as long and as straight and hard as a steel flag pole! It had grown so long, it was touching the bottom of his neck! <br />
<br />
With the dawn lightng the skies, he did manage to spot his equipment. It was HUUUUUGE! A big black vein straining out of the side of the thing! It was horrifying to behold! Especially knowing that was HIS equipment! An enormous black monster inputting every square inch of the thick black leathery skin-covered steel-like tube with an intense itchy, tingling sensation directly to his brain! The monstrous feeling was emanatimg throughout his entire body. Pounding into his brain! He couldn&#39;t even TOUCH it! Donkeys like him are disallowed to touch themselves! <br />
<br />
With his entire body; all of his muscles completely tensed up, gritting his teeth, he poured every ounce of his wishes to no longer being a donkey, while relishing in the fact that he was STUCK as a donkey! All of his needs to have fingers and toes again, to be able to stand upright and speak, was poured into his limbless male tube that was taut as a flag pole. It began to hop up and down seemingly of it&#39;s own accord. Slapping against his white-furred belly. <br />
<br />
His mind all-ablaze with a lifelike exploding fireworks of colors. He had completely forgotten that he was a donkey! This was the most intensely realistic daydream as his human self, pretending he was stuck as a donkey! He was in his bedroom, pretending he had no hands, and humping the floor to his imagination of his terror at being stuck as a donkey! Forever!<br />
<br />
His entire being poured directly into his equipment. And finally....FINALLY!!!! With his entire body twitching, particularly his hind legs, he felt a torrent of hot liquid slowly, almost painfully, work it&#39;s way up through that endless black tube of his. It began to squeeze out of his black odd-shaped cock tip. Slow as mallassas. Jeff was going nuts in his mind. It was ALLLMOST there! Just....a....bit....moooooOOOOOAAAARRRRR!!!! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWW!!!!!<br />
<br />
With a tremendous pump, a nuclear bomb seemed to explode all over his entire being! With a mighty spurt, a large load of hot sticky donkey cum fired out of it&#39;s black prison like a cannon shot! A second nuclear explosion immediately followed the first! Then a third! Then a fourth! Then a fifth! It wouldn&#39;t stop coming! Jeff was starting to get scared. This was by far the greatest masturbation session of all time! Perhaps a little TOO great! When the hell was he going to finish!?<br />
<br />
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleventh pumps!!!! It was going on far too long, and Jeff was terrified, not knowing wtf was wrong with him!<br />
<br />
But finally, it began to subside! Another 10 to 12 pumps or so, each one weaker than the last. Jeff&#39;s mind was left reeling from his dick that was still tingling and twitching. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww!&quot; he said, as he was about to pull himself up from his bedroom floor to look at the &quot;damage,&quot; then heading to the bathroom to clean himself up. But. Something was wrong....something was....off....<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww,&quot; Jeff brayed again, as he opened his eyes. Suddenly, his &quot;human body&quot; that he was &quot;feeling&quot; in that intense daydream, had faded as he came back to reality. &quot;Feeling&quot; his donkey body&#39;s shape, size, and oppressive restrictiveness instead!  <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhaawww!!&quot; He cried out as he saw the horrifying sight of the gray-furred, hoof-limbed donkey&#39;s body instead of his human one! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhaawww!!&quot; He cried out again, as he saw the field filled with the growing morning light. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeee hhhhhaaaaaawww!!!&quot; He cried yet again, as he realized there was no bathroom, no washing up for him. No post-masturbation satisfaction of having spare time to sit and relax at his computer or in front of a TV! <br />
<br />
His daydream that he was himself as a human masturbating on his bedroom floor, at the thought of being a donkey was so vividly real in his mind. And that masturbation session was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!! It was indescribable, the mixture of the most amazing post-ejaculation high, and the horror of discovering that he was still a donkey for yet another day, and would have to go about the rest of this day as a donkey. With nothing to look forward to. And with nothing to do. Nothing to keep his mind occupied. No reading. No games. Not even a simple conversation could he hold. Just a plain old donkey who&#39;s days are filled with nothing but eating, farting, pissing, shitting, sleeping, and the occasional sexual encounters. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhaawww!&quot; Jeff sobbed, at the insurmountable &quot;prison&quot; sentence he is stuck with that stretches out towards eternity.</p>
