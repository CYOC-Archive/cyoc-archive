<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam smiled as he entered his office at Southern High School. A claw traced over the name on the door.<br />
<br />
SAM MARSHALL<br />
GUIDANCE COUNCILLOR<br />
CDC LIAISON<br />
<br />
Life had worked out rather well since contracting Gay Pride three months earlier. The only one who knew Sam had infected himself was Lars, and Sam&#39;s dedicated and loving boyfriend wasn&#39;t going to tell a soul. Southern High and the CDC had greatly appreciated Sam exposing Martin as the source of the infection (Even though he had escaped), and worked together to create a new job for Sam. <br />
<br />
Though Sam and Lars had to be on their best behavior during school hours, they were otherwise inseparable - though Rob did still join them regularly for a threesome. The plan was for Lars to attend community college locally and move in with Sam right after graduation. Turning into a giant gay lionman was the best thing that could have happened to Samantha.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Mia took a deep breath and waited for Dr. Oddwin to leave, counting the seconds. He had at most 45 seconds left before the incinerator door alarm sounded. Thunk! the security door to the room slammed shut. Mia quick opened the incinerator, grabbed two vials from the tray, and closed the door properly before the alarm sounded. A second more and they were attached to a clip hidden inside his huge fluffy mane. No one would suspect anything, and his towering height allowed him to block the incinerator security camera with his head.<br />
<br />
This was the culmination of two months of planning. <br />
<br />
He had tried to start a new life, he really had. All the fears about adjusting to his size, new species, and new sexual orientation turned out to be overblown. The Pride was a idealistic open social group, supporting each other emotionally and sexually. Spending Saturday nights in the thick of an orgy, pounding tight ass after tight ass. Mia&#39;s sex life was the best it had ever been (and it had been pretty great as an attractive young blonde woman).<br />
<br />
It was the clothes that got him, the lack of fashion. Mia had always loved to follow trends, wear the hottest new designer, and the shoes... oh the shoes! Her expensive tastes were what led her to CDC Response in the first place; it was the only way a biology major could earn well into six figures as a recent graduate. The hazard pay had fueled her extravagant lifestyle, but in the end the hazards had gotten her. <br />
<br />
Now Mia had a pathological aversion to wearing anything, and it had broken him. He needed to change back, to be a girl. The challenge is that the addition of lion genetics from Gay Pride left him immune to almost all transformative diseases. The few that could work were extremely rare and extremely dangerous. The CDC rated strains on a one to seven hazard scale, and all of his options were sevens - and only found at a few ultra secure research labs.<br />
<br />
So Mia leveraged the goodwill from their work at Southern High into a lab assistant position at the CDC&#39;s primary research lab. He lied and claimed the big air filled isolation suits didn&#39;t bother him since they were so puffy. In reality is was daily torture, but a means to an end. After two months of swapping labels, swapping vials, and systematically working his two chosen strains into a position to swipe them from the incinerator tray which was supposed to be all non-viable low risk strains.<br />
<br />
Just as hard was trying to act normal for the rest of the day with the stolen goods hidden literally under his nose. Finally, his shift ended and he was able to retreat to his apartment.<br />
<br />
Mia thought about having dinner or celebrating his successful heist. No, do this now, before he loses his nerve. Even through all the self interest and greed, he knew he was almost certainly unleashing something terrible and disruptive.<br />
<br />
The first vial was labelled &#39;Rapunzel&#39; a relatively benign hair growth strain. The contents were really &#39;Chrysalis&#39;, one of the highest contagion risks identified and more interesting mix of pros and cons. It always worked in conjunction with another strain. Within minutes of infection, the victim would literally burst out of their skin, transformed underneath into that person&#39;s idealized body - within the constraints of the secondary strain. They would also be restored to the reproductive peak of around age 20. The downside is that those regressed more than a few years suffered amnesia; the more years shed, the more memories lost.<br />
<br />
The second vial was labelled &#39;Tenta-tongue&#39;, an entertaining  infection that drastically increased the length and dexterity of their tongue.  What was really inside was Herm-F, the female based hermaphrodite strain. Mia had come to like having a cock and was going to keep it and have the best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
He picked up the two little vials in his meaty paw. Carefully he poured them together in a shotglass.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m sorry Sam, I couldn&#39;t keep my promise.&#39;<br />
<br />
He tossed it back. <br />
<br />
Not sure how this was going to go, and given his current massive size and strength, the risk of trashing the place seemed real. Coffee table was put aside and a blue tarp went down on the floor.<br />
<br />
Mia was starting to feel strange, his skin felt numb. Grabbing his face and muzzle, everything felt squishy, like a water balloon. The room spun, and he fell to the floor. Holding up a paw, for a moment Mia could swear he saw the impression of slender finger tips pushing outward from inside his big leathery paw pads.<br />
<br />
Numbness and vertigo ramped up, drowning out other sensation. The room faded to black.<br />
<br />
Silence.<br />
Darkness.<br />
Claustrophobia.<br />
PANIC.<br />
<br />
Mia was trapped, scrambling frantically for freedom. Something tore, and Mia was able to flop out onto the floor. A coughing fit set in, pushing an alarming amount of fluid out from choked lungs.<br />
<br />
The bright lights were painful, and the numbness was gone. If anything, Mia felt super sensitive. Bare wet skin getting goose bumps in the cool air. She could feel it, the softness of her body, the roundness of her curves. Full soft breasts dancing with the rapid rise and fall of her chest. Sexy girly Mia was back. A slender hand drifted down to her crotch and found a flaccid cock and full sack. Mmmmmm, not quite all girly, she smiled. Her finger traced a little further back and found her slit right behind her nuts. Yes, best of both worlds indeed.<br />
<br />
A  female voice interrupted. &quot;Oh fuck me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia turned her head and jerked in surprise. Next to her on the floor was a very attractive naked girl. Spiky white blonde pixie cut hair, expressive ice blue eyes, sharp features, and full red lips. Her body was just as perfect. Natural but perky D cups, trim waist, leading to flaring hips. Noticing a respectable sized male package between her thighs, Mia&#39;s eyes snapped up to that pretty face. She now recognized it as a younger idealized version of her previous female self.<br />
<br />
&#39;You&#39;re me&#39; She said in wonder. Her doppelganger was similarly stunned.<br />
<br />
Her copy found her voice again. &quot;I&#39;m Mia. um, are you?&#39;<br />
<br />
This Mia responded &#39;Yeah, I&#39;m also Mia, I think I have pretty much all of my memories. It must have some how made two of us.&#39;<br />
<br />
The other Mia laughed. &#39;Wow, of all the things that could have gone wrong with this, I never thought ending up with a clone of myself would be it.&#39; She paused and licked her lips. &#39;Or did something go terribly right?&#39;<br />
<br />
Mia knew this woman was literally herself , but she still felt extremely attracted to her. Herm-F was known to induce pansexuality. This was new, Mia had been strictly hetero as a woman, and completely gay as a lionman; she had never been into girls before. Feeling the way her new body was responding, this was going to be a very welcome change.<br />
<br />
Mia slid closer to her twin. Fingers brushed through her short platinum blonde hair. Restraint vanished and the identical girls energetically locked lips.</p>
