<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the pair of them went off to next period something was bother Bryan. He couldn&#39;t put his finger on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe that actually worked!&quot; Wes put his heavily muscled arm around Bryan&#39;s shoulder. &quot;You were right though, them thinking there&#39;s something between us really did get me laid, bro. We&#39;re going to be rolling in it soon. We&#39;re going to get laid so much!&quot; Wes was going on like an excited puppy, and then he leaned in and kissed Bryan on the cheek. &quot;You&#39;re a genius.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan felt sick. He didn&#39;t want to be rolling in pussy he wanted.. fuck. What did he want? Finally he put a word to what he was feeling, it was the same feeling he had when Ross seemed to pull away. Jealousy. This is how it had been with Ross, first he got a little action, then he was too busy being popular to have time for scrawny Bryan with the greasy hair. He wasn&#39;t going to let Wes go that easy.<br />
<br />
His thoughts drifted to his own encounter with Ross and Diego. If only it could be like that. Those two were close as could be but obviously could fool around with other people. Well, he didn&#39;t know exactly how it worked between those two, but it did. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Wes suddenly said, and Bryan looked over at his friend. Despite being built like a brick wall now, there was still some of that puppy-dog feel to him still.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna skip.&quot; Bryan said, turning away from heading back to the building. He extricated himself from Wes&#39; arm and started heading to the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll come with.&quot; Wes said, suddenly eager.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Bryan said, maybe with a bit more heat than he intended. And there it was, the kicked puppy look. How could a guy that looked like he could bend steel bars then crush beer cans on his head for fun look so much like a sad dog? &quot;No.. I&#39;m just going to go home and lay down. It&#39;s been a weird couple of days.&quot; That seemed to mollify Wes. God the way his still blondish hair contrasted with that tanner skin of his made him look like some beach god, especially when he grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but text if you need anything.&quot; Wes shoved his hands in his pockets and turned back to the school. Bryan hopped in his car and drove off, but not home.<br />
<br />
It took him a while of walking the perimeter at his destination to find what he was looking for. Most of the fairgrounds was fenced off, and there was no getting in the traditional way, the place was closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, and even then the place didn&#39;t open until the late afternoon on weekdays. Still Bryan found a spot on the fencing where he could haul himself over. He ran and grabbed the top of the fence, his new arm muscles bulging and he got to the top, then hopped over, landing with a solid thud on the hard packed dirt on the other side.<br />
<br />
He looked at the fence behind him and grinned, flexing an arm and giving his bicep a kiss. &quot;Yeah, can&#39;t stop this.&quot; Though he didn&#39;t linger long, instead making his way through the park to the one spot he had in mind. The place was creepy abandoned. Even in the light of day. Not like it was in disrepair or something was off. Just the odd disconnect of being in a place that should be active and full of people, but instead it was empty and.. drab.<br />
<br />
Bryan finally made it to the wishing machine, and like before it was just sitting there, the figure in it slumped over. He pushed a few buttons but nothing happened. He dug in his pockets and found one of the game tokens he&#39;d purchased at the fair the other night and slid it in, pushing the button again. &quot;C&#39;mon you stupid thing.&quot; Then he took a moment to look around. &quot;The power.&quot; All the rides were off, nothing moved, even the lights overhead were off. &quot;No shit they&#39;d turn off the power when closed. God, I&#39;m a dumbass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan slumped to the ground, his back up against the wishing machine. It had seemed like a good plan. Bryan&#39;s plans always backfired.<br />
<br />
&quot;STATE YOUR WISH, YOUNG MAN.&quot; Bryan hopped to his feet. The machine was on! Maybe it had some internal battery or something. He looked around but didn&#39;t see any obvious answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish me and Wes were more like Ross and Diego.&quot; He blurted out. He hadn&#39;t really thought of the wording of his wish, or what the consequences might be. Even dealing with this machine once before and still feeling the effects he went with the first words his mind managed to put together.<br />
<br />
The wizard in the machine was silent for a moment, then emitted a little musical chime just like last time. &quot;YOUR WISH WILL BE GRANTED, SOONER OR LATER.&quot; Then the wizard slumped over and the machine went quiet once more, whatever power it had drained for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone here?&quot; A voice called from deeper in the fair grounds. Bryan gulped and bolted for it. No way he was going to get in trouble for skipping school and trespassing. He made it back to the lower bit of fencing and hauled himself over again. He ambled back to his car, pulling out his phone to check the time. There was still some school left in the day if he wanted to try to sneak back in, or maybe he could just hang out and wait for Wes. Going home was always an option, too.</p>
