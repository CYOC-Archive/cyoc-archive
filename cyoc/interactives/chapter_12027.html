<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After letting his eyes adjust to the darkness, Ryan could make out the faintest of details.  The outline of the hall was more or less visible to him and he could see a closed door to his right.  He grabbed the handle and pushed the door inward.  It creaked eerily and Ryan brushed passed some cobwebs as he entered the room.  He could feel, more than see, that it was a small room and what little light there was illuminated groups of objects scattered on the floor and walls.  He spied what he thought was a candelabra to his right and suddenly remembered the lighter in his pocket.  With a flick and a click, a tiny tongue of flame lit up the immediate area.  He bent close to the candelabra and lit its three candles in turn.  They provided a surprising amount of illumination and revealed the entire room.<br />
<br />
It looked like a playroom.  The objects Ryan had dimly viewed were revealed to be stacks of toys of every kind: building blocks, legos, board games, dolls and action figures...a mixture of old and new.  But there were also bookshelves filled to capacity, a glass cabinet whose shelves were filled with figurines.  So maybe more of a storage room than a playroom, he thought.  The center of the room was dominated by a large carpet in a black and white pattern.  The left side had a small white box encompassed by a large black box.  The other half was a reverse of that pattern.  Beyond it against the back wall was an ornate full-length mirror.  There was a fine, undisturbed layer of dust coating everything he could see.  No one had disturbed this room in a long time.  Curious to investigate it further, he stepped forward and heard a crunch.  He stepped back and looked down to see what he thought was a white bug that he'd stepped on.  Bending down and looking closer, he could see that they were tiny bones.  Biology wasn't his strong suit, but it looked to him like it might have been a mouse, but it must have been the world's smallest mouse.  He figured even new-born mice wouldn't be that tiny.  Then again, who knew?   Let the high school geeks figure it out.  He'd stick to sports.  Standing back up, he stepped into the room and caught his reflection in the mirror.  He was hot and he knew it.  There was hardly an extra ounce of fat on his 6'2&quot; frame and he was seriously considering tryout out for modelling.  It would be great cash and he knew he was cut out for it.  He struck his most dazzling smile and felt sorry for anyone who wasn't him.<br />
<br />
But his smile waned a little when a nagging feeling that he'd only been aware of for the past few seconds started pushing itself passed his vanity and into the forefront of his mind.  His pecs weren't all that visible under his shirt.  It was skin tight and showed off his upper-body, but now it wasn't hugging his body.  And the candelabra was getting heavier.  He looked at it.  It actually seemed a little bigger in his hand.  He lifted his foot to take a step forward and then put it back down in rising shock.  He looked down and raised the foot straight up, shaking it from side to side.  His sneaker waggled loosely on his foot.   It was a few sizes too big.  But that was impossible.  Even wearing them barefoot like he was now, they hugged his size 11 feet perfectly.  He placed the candelabra on the floor and sat down, removing his right sneaker and placing its bottom against the sole of his foot.  His foot looked perfectly normal to him: strong arch ending in long toes, but it was obvious that it was way too small for his shoe.  Lining up his heel with the back of the sneaker, he could see that his toes fell at least three inches short of the shoe's tip.  Then the pit of his stomach went cold as he looked closer.  He could see the tips of his toes moving visibly against the bottom of the sneaker.  His foot was getting smaller right before his eyes.  And then he knew the truth: it wasn't just his foot.  His whole body was shrinking.  He dropped the shoe and leapt to his feet.  As soon as he stood upright, his board shorts and boxers dropped to his ankles.  His tank top hung loosely from one shoulder.  The other strap had fallen to his side, revealing his left pec and its erect nipple.  Ryan was terrified and fascinated at the same time.  The whole room was growing around him.  Everything looked to be almost twice its normal size.  The fibers of the carpet seemed to move underneath his one bare foot, drawing his attention to it.  He could see now that he was standing on the left side of the carpet, almost directly on the small white box.  The shrinking seemed to start when he'd stepped there.  Desperate to stop the process, he took a step backward and immediately got tangled up in the clothing still pooled around his ankles.  As his butt hit the carpet, his left foot slipped out of the overlarge sneaker and his tank top slipped down to his waist.  He stood up again and made for the edge of the carpet, leaving his clothes behind.  He leapt over his shorts, his muscled legs carrying him easily over them, and sprinted.  Too many steps later, he was back on the dusty wood floor and stopped.  He waited for a moment, and breathed a sigh of relief.  He'd stopped shrinking.  But it was only temporary relief as he took in the enormity of his situation.  Comparing himself to the normal-sized objects around him, he guaged his height.  He was still buff and beautiful.  And he was also...</p>
