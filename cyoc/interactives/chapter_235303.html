<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning’s rays warmed Kelly’s face as she awoke to a new day. The air felt thick in her lungs and it smelt of sex, no, it reeked of cum with a healthy raw milk aroma. Yet for the first time since yesterday she felt satisfied, at peace, and a bit tired. Absolutely not horny, not one bit despite the sight of the flooded sex ruined barn. Yawning she stood up on her four legs and trotted in place to get the blood flowing in her aching limbs. <br />
<br />
“Moo!”<br />
<br />
Kelly glanced in the direction of Jessica the giant human cow smiling with twitching ears. Oh no, the sight of her giant boobs and sinfully sexy body mixed with her loveable innocent face made the blood in Kelly’s body heat up and travel rapidly to the beating of her two hearts. Kelly’s horse dong wasn’t there for morning wood but now it engorged to its full length like a dark flagpole waiting and pulsing for the go signal. Her horse balls also tighten and churned ready, ready for Kelly to go wild once again. This wasn’t good, Kelly couldn’t lose herself to her carnal desires again. She needed to find help for her sister Veronica, Jessica, Drew, and herself. Plus she needed to see if her parents were okay after the fusion wave and start managing the family&#39;s farm work after two days of chaos. She couldn&#39;t fuck all day with so heavy a responsibility to her family and herself.<br />
<br />
The centauress college girl tried her best to ignore the tightness and pulsing between her back legs as she patted Jessica’s ears and went to find unruined feed for the human cow. She found it easy to carry the bag of feed once she located it, new strength as the result of her fusion with George her stallion, enhancing her human half’s already muscular tone from fit to bringer bodybuilder. With Jessica eating, Kelly had her own impromptu breakfast of milk straight from the teats, despite yesterday’s engoring, Kelly couldn’t get enough of the human cow’s fresh fatty milk. With breakfast and Jessica’s morning milking done, Kelly left the gate and barn doors open so that Jessica could free roam, before leaving herself to find her mother and father.<br />
<br />
Kelly couldn’t bear to see Veronica after what she did to her yesterday so she avoided the side of the house where her tree sister slept soaking in the day’s rays. The house was super cramped with her new centauress size but she managed to search the house without breaking too many things. Empty, if her mother and father weren’t here then they must be in town or the fields. She worried if they had some unfortunate fusion like Veronica, an inanimate unmoving form, she rushed out the house leaving the broken vases, lamps, floorboard for later clean up.<br />
<br />
Galloping at full speed, Kelly ran through the golden fields of grain and corn. The wind and freedom of running made her forget her worries and lust for a brief moment before she reached the end of the property. Behind the family farm was a tree covered hill that led into the wild mountains. Seeing a truck parked at the bottom of the hill, caused her to flash back to a time long ago when her father told her that it was where her parents would sneak for fun, their lover’s retreat. Back then Kelly had thought it was frolicking running wild children’s fun but now her sex tainted mind realized that her parents probably sneaked out there for secret sex since no one could see up and through the trees on the hill.<br />
<br />
She apprehensively made her way up the green covered hill and peaked around the trees. She had been a good girl before college and her fusion so she never went out to explore the wilderness behind the farm property. She eventually found a clearing in the grove after following suspicious wet smacking noises. There she gasped as her mind struggled to comprehend what she saw.  <br />
<br />
It was her mother sprawling on her back on a blanket on the ground, covered in a strange white slime. Her eyes were rolled up and she was drooling as her whole body shook intermittently. Her milfy curves were on full display, the sign of a fusion as clothes were most likely destroyed during the process. Her big boobs, which her daughters inherited, jiggled and her huge hips writhed. Her legs kicked at the bulbous tree that was between her legs.<br />
<br />
No wait! That was no tree! The living mass of flesh pulsed and throbbed as a huge wet smacking sound splattered nearby. Kelly  spotted a mixed pile of clothes near an actual tree. Dear apple pie, her parents were fornicating, so that meant….  Well it was the size of her father.<br />
<br />
Kelly gagged at the thought of her parents having the sex at the time of the fusion wave, before her horsecock grew erect at the thought, betraying her once again.<br />
<br />
Back to the matter at hand, yes indeed, her father was her mother’s cock and balls, human sized. It was like his whole mass was transformed into a giant cock with giant balls. Kelly’s father was huge and now her mother’s new literal thick meat tower wasn’t different. In its monolithic erection it reached a good height 6 or 7 feet high. Each firm churning ball was 3 feet in diameter and they jostled in her mother’s bean bag chair like ballsack. <br />
<br />
The quivering sex tower was of course cumming and shooting a geyser of cum into the air, explaining the noise and now the musky sex stench. She must have gone a bit nose blind from her own barn banging because the cum scent was strong near the source. She looked down the other side of the hill and gaped at the white stream path leading to a good sized lake of cum. Her mother must have been cumming all night till now unable to move due to the weight and size and pleasure of her once husband. Kelly hoped that her mother wasn’t brain dead from cumming for hours with a sensitive meat volcano bigger than her.<br />
<br />
Kelly felt the horny feeling from her erect horsecock clouding her mind. No not now…. She steeled herself and ran down the hill to get a wheelbarrow, rope, or something to drag her mother to the pick up truck at the base of the hill. She needed to get her fused parents out of the elements and back to safety on the farm.<br />
<br />
Once she had the rope and wheelbarrow, Kelly jerry rigged a crane pulley system by using the tree branches of the grove. She tied the rope around and under her once human father and hoisted with her new found horse centaur strength. Tying the rope to another tree allowed the cum spewing allowed her to move the wheelbarrow under the mass of flesh. Once her mother’s balls were in she lowered the rest of the goo shooting shaft down. A whole lot of cock length still stuck out of the front of the barrel, still shooting cumshots in intervals. It shot a lot of hot steaming cum due to her manhandling. Either way she carried her mother’s nude body in one arm and held the wheelbarrow as she slowly made her way down hill. <br />
<br />
Transferring her mother and giant cock with giant balls to the back of the pickup truck, Kelly tied the rope to the front of the car and put it in neutral. She was too big to fit in the cabin of the vehicle much less drive, so she would pull like a workhorse. Under the warm sun, Kelly pulled and tried not to think about the cum trail her mother was leaving behind as she jizzed thick strings out the back of the truck bed.<br />
<br />
Pulling her parents home gave her time to ruminate. She didn’t know what the future would hold now. She wanted to return to college, but she was a huge centaur, not made for human classrooms and dorms. She wondered about her friends, were they fused too? She was the only mobile person on her family farm so her family obligations and responsibilities told her she had to stay and help out. Kelly wondered if the government would help or if it could even help with her and her family problems. Maybe it would be easier to fall back into her lustful haze and not think at all….</p>
