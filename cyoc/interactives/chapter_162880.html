<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marg sighed, as then decided to go downstairs to her kitchen and check on the Medallion and its melting progress. <br />
She noticed her odd manner of taking long stride steps, as how she walked, her gait manner had changed. As Marg came to the doorway of her bedroom and the upstairs hall, she stopped and looked back at the dark puddle of fluid stain on the bed.<br />
<br />
A half thought for putting on a robe she quickly discounted the idea, as preferred to remain naked and furry to the air. She stepped into the hallway and with long strides she walked to the head of the stairway. As she stood there for a long minute, the smell of a hot iron pan was wafting from the kitchen to drifting up the stairway.<br />
<br />
Marg rushed down the stairs and as ran then through the living room, the dining room and entered the kitchen to see white smoke hanging in the air above her stove. As she looked into the iron pan and expected to see a melted pool of silver and gold metal; what she did see was the Medallion, but it had grown bigger.<br />
<br />
“What, what, how is this possible,” a stupefied Margery said aloud?<br />
<br />
“Heat, yes by adding great heat to the Medallion you have enhanced its power to almost double of what it could do yesterday. As better or worse, it gained a sense of self preservation and a determination; although you tried to destroy it, the curse holds no favor or consideration for the likes of you!<br />
<br />
You are the Master at present, the Mistress Master, but the curse did take your husband and changed his species and as well, his gender. As had the curse did make a pact with you son, promising him that he should never lose his identity to become an ignorant animal, though he a horse; the same general consideration shall adhere to you. <br />
<br />
Out of my attained manners and respect for my Masters, I feel a need to warn you that the curse is planning for you to become wholly as a pony mare, even as soon as by sundown today. As you have had this warning there is still time for you to remedy your possible beastly fate.<br />
<br />
As of most who having had their life path touched by the Medallion curse, what matters most is the finality clause, which worked against Jared and Robert, but could leave for you another path to regain of what you were, a human woman. <br />
<br />
Robert, your husband was directly transitioned of body to becoming as he is now and must remain, she a pony mare. <br />
His transition became as permanent because it was he that put on his body the horse blanket; but you then with the Velcro strap did make that blanket as a complete item of clothing.<br />
<br />
Most of those who through the centuries either did button, zip, tie as bind to enclose their body with an item depicted by the human to being as clothing, usually was something worn by another human, and from not changing their change of species, they could return to being their self after twenty-four hours.<br />
<br />
Changing the species of a human to that of an animal requires the Devil host of the curse, and/or the Demon creator of the curse, for either to authorize such a master changing. As of such special authorizations made, the Demons never, and the Devils rarely allow the said cursed person to transition back to their being human.<br />
<br />
Jared saw his future as a doomed prospect, and from his becoming an animal he realized with a certainty of becoming as another of the damned. He had a slim chance while still changing to ask, as wish, and offer to make a deal with a devil. Therefore, before he would have lost his ability to speak as do humans, he made a wish to proposition the devil host.  Your son thought quickly to ask the curse host, and boldly asked as to finalize a deal.<br />
<br />
Jared reminded the Devil of your family heritage with religious teachings, of Grandparents and relatives who served the church. He knew the curse would destroy his ever attaining of a heavenly eternal resting place, and used his heritage to gain a bargaining.<br />
<br />
Your son wished to own the ability to be himself when and while he would be the stallion named Jasper. As he continued his wish by suggesting that his equine genitals become then infectious to mares and all humans.<br />
<br />
I was listening and so too the Devil host, as it directed of me to ask Jared to clarify of what the word of infectious actually meant to your son?<br />
<br />
Jared replied, as specified how he wished to have highly infectious semen. He added as how when he would mate, have vaginal insertion to then spew inside a mare; he being a stallion could impregnate any mare, virile or sterile.<br />
<br />
He also wanted his semen as fully infectious if inserted vaginally or orally into a human female. As this caught then the Devil host’s evil imagination, and it agreed, but asked of Jared if he wished for anything more.<br />
<br />
As Jared bowed his head as if not to show his sense of glee from enticing a devil, he added to his wish list that if a male human were to orally ingest any of his, Jared’s equine semen, that from the touch to any human skin would begin for that person, their slow transition to become for Jasper as another mare for his herd.<br />
<br />
Jared offered a reminder to the Devil host to the curse of many times when his father, Robert, your husband, had discovered trespassers. Jasper was regionally renowned for having a long and beastly tapered male member. As had several teenage girls lost their virginity to the bloated, distal end of his cock, an equal number of boyfriends came to watch or participate, as had oral copulation with Jasper.<br />
<br />
The Devil host was pleased, and agreed with how Jared requested his lifestyle and future would possess of such powerful abilities. The Devil remarked, reminding of Jared to consider of how damned he would become in the eyes in Heaven, and equally damning for his religious future; as the infecting ability placed him in league with the devils!<br />
<br />
Even from my years of experience, of those who became as an animal physically, some would as wish to retain a meager link to being human by retaining their human intelligence. Jared did as well request this similar thought; and although informed that of most who become as an animal form, they tend to go insane after their third year of being an animal. The ignorance to an animal is a blessing, especially when considering the many lengthy times when an owner would leave his property as parked in place, waiting on him to decide when to use his mount next!<br />
<br />
Time tends to drive the thoughtful mentality to go insane from wasting their lifetime when they would rather be grazing or frolicking with the opposite gender. Jared said he would accept what his becoming all as is a horse and when mating, allow the past knowledge of Jasper to rule. <br />
<br />
The Devil host reacted with an odd manner of enthusiasm, as he did agreeing surprise Jared, inspiring your son to wish for more, but doing so with a respectful manner directed to the Host to the curse. As Jared asked so politely of the Devil host, and requested, wished, for to own the ability to at will on the Friday evening and through the full weekend, until come the next Monday morning, he could transition; as transforming from horse to being his human self. <br />
<br />
Jared expected the Devil to deny that portion of the wish. As Jared did not wait for an answer from the deciding Devil, but your’ smart son offered the devil a proviso, and suggested he would need retain when as a human the equine genitals, his semen being equine and as highly infectious still!<br />
<br />
Your son became the horse, he learned through Jasper to relish of stallion lifestyle and the delights. As with all that so said, would you please turn off the stove burner and allow the Medallion to cool?<br />
<br />
Ask now of me anything special you wish as be for you your truer self, because when I am passed on to another person, what you are, most likely is what you shall remain!&quot;</p>
