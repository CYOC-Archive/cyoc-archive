<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The gents were fortunately empty when Dan entered, walking in a funny crouch to disguise the wardrobe malfunction caused by the dick he’d taken first from trainer Adam, then from new cinema buddy Allie. Immediately he straightened up and looked down at the front of his shorts. It looked like he would need to wear briefs or a jockstrap from now on because it looked like there was no way he could hide his monster in these short shorts. The semi erect dick was peeping out obscenely from the bottom of his shorts, dragging his right trouserleg up. It was circumcised – which might be an interesting new experience for Dan – and while it didn’t look quite as thick as Phil’s member, it looked longer. It felt heavier too, the balls seemed even bigger than Phil’s, housed in a low hanging ball sack.<br />
<br />
The new cock grew harder and harder with each passing moment. It felt so heavy, fully erect it didn’t get above 90 degrees from his body – his pelvic muscles weren’t strong enough to hold it at the same perky angle as the dicklet borrowed from tim. He couldn’t resist trying it out then and there. <br />
<br />
Dan entered a cubicle, pulled his new cock out and began lightly stroking the thick, veiny shaft, savouring the softness of the skin, the heaviness of his new piece. He traced the contours of his new exposed cock head, gasping at its sensitivity. He clutched his new hairy ball sack, feeling its heft and amused by the clash between its golden pubes and the dark Hispanic hair on the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
Finally, he couldn’t take the teasing any more. He gripped the shaft, smiled at how his little hand couldn&#39;t circle his new cock, and began to pump away, gently at first then faster and faster, overwhelmed by the sensations, so different from those he enjoyed with either Tim’s dick or Phil’s monster. He was impressed by how unique his experience was with each cock he’d tried so far. He didn’t think genital swaps would ever get old. Thinking about how much Adam had lost with the theft of his junk was a real turn on but it took some time for Dan to go over the edge – maybe a more mature 30-year-old cock took longer to bring to orgasm. Eventually he did though. With an involuntarily loud cry of ecstasy, he came suddenly – he sprayed the wall behind the toilet with a thick goopy coating, unable to control himself or even direct his ejaculation.<br />
<br />
Happy and excited by the intensity of the orgasm, Dan did his best to clean up, then headed out to the gym determined to share his bounty with Adam to give him a taste of what he used to give his female conquests.<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
Dan finished his workout thinking about making a move on Adam. He knew in this reality, Adam was still a ladies man, only they ate him out as well as vice versa. Did that mean he would be as repulsed by cock as he was before? More, how would Adam respond to having a young 20-something snatch? Dan was aware of how different an older cock could be. Would it be the same for a pussy?<br />
<br />
Dan needed to think of a solution.<br />
<br />
Dan spotted Adams conquest from earlier heading to the changing room, passing Adam busy with a client. Adam winked and grinned at her seductively and she blushed crimson in response. She then passed Dan as he sat up on the weight bench he was using, his – formerly Adam’s monster flopped out of the leg of his shorts. Embarrassed, Dan started stuffing it back inside his clothes, then noticed the girl staring hungrily at his crotch. They made eye contact and she gazed his eyes with evident desire.<br />
<br />
Inspired, Dan made his swap, making sure Adam was aware. The girl suddenly turned away, no longer interested in Dan or his massive cock.<br />
<br />
That done, dan waited until Adam headed for the changing room and followed him.<br />
<br />
Seeing Adam head into a lockable shower cubicle at the far end of the room, towel wrapped around his waist, Dan went to his own locker, got his towel out, stripped naked, then went to the huge open communal shower in full view of where Adam had left his stuff, enjoying the sensation of his new monster bouncing wildly, slapping against his thighs.<br />
<br />
He stayed under the shower, slowly lathering his body until he heard the far cubicle quieten down, the door open, the slap of flip-flops across the floor.<br />
<br />
When he was sure Adam was back at his clothes, Dan turned around, ensuring his pendulous weighty junk was on full display. Satisfied that Adam had him in his field of vision, Dan shut the shower off, picked up his shower gel and walked back to his bench naked to pick up his towel. His junk slapped his thigh with a delicious thwack with every movement of his body. He noticed Adam watching him, following his journey to his bench.<br />
<br />
Drying himself off, muscles and assets on full confident display, Dan broke the silence. “ive seen you before, haven’t I? You&#39;re on instagram, you have that personal trainer app?”<br />
<br />
Adam blushed, actually blushed, like a coy girl, seemed at a loss as to what to say.<br />
<br />
Smiling seductively, Dan pressed on “ yeah, you’re good. The workouts are great. And you look even better in person.”<br />
<br />
All Adam could say was thanks.<br />
<br />
“So, tell me. The one place you’re not packing is where it counts, below the belt. How did you get so many girls?”<br />
<br />
Blushing bright crimson now, Adam defended himself. “Its not what you’ve got that matters. It’s how you use it. Girls like that I have a pussy. Means I know better than other men how to please them.”<br />
<br />
“Mmm, I suppose you’re right,” Dan conceded. “and do they return the favour?”<br />
<br />
Adam thought about it. “Some do. Most get a little uncomfortable at the idea of eating me out.”<br />
<br />
Dan smirked. “Guess at the end of the day they want some one who is all man.” He swung his python to emphasize his point – Adam watching it as if hypnotized.<br />
<br />
“I am all man,” Adam said voice weaker than he intended.<br />
<br />
“But what about you? Surely you are tired of always being the one eating others out? Surely you must want the chance to be treated the same? You must want someone who is all man too?”<br />
<br />
Adam was openly staring at Dan’s new junk now, which was starting to harden at the attention. Adams mouth hung open hungry for a taste.<br />
<br />
“You do, don’t you? I bet you’re wet at the thought. A monster like mine buried in your cute little snatch.”<br />
<br />
Adams knees clenched under his towel, as he tried to control his arousal. The movement must have loosened the bathsheet he had wrapped around his hips because it slipped from his waist, revealing his womanhood in all its glory. His well defined six pack and v-line led the eye not to his former monster, but across a smooth plane of pale untanned waxed skin to Adams new invitingly pink pussy lips peeping out from between his muscled manly thighs. Dan thought he could see a slight gleam on Adams inner thigh where his pussy juices had dripped. God, he must really be doing a number on Adam.<br />
<br />
Dan looked pointedly at Adams new sex . Adam blushed furiously, tried to cover his crotch up. Dan smiled with faux sympathy, approached adam, with his hand out.<br />
<br />
“phone,” Dan said. Without hesitation, Adam passed it to him. Dan put in his number, then added a calendar invite complete with his address and room number.<br />
<br />
Handing it back, he said “meet me there at 11 tonight.”<br />
<br />
With that, he finished dressing then headed out the door, fully aware of Adams eyes on him.</p>
