<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was a little off with the birth dates, since it would have been another 2 weeks before her actual birth. She had been a cow for that long, and she was getting mighty used to being one. <br />
<br />
&quot;Push!&quot; Mark said, seeing the head of the calf. Jade pushed, her swelling pussy stretching far wider than she hoped for. The calf&#39;s head slipped right through, as Mark quickly removed the embryonic tissue surrounding it. &quot;GAAAAH!!!&quot; Jade yelled, as the pain intensified, the rest of the calf&#39;s body slowly pushing out of her gushing vaginal opening. A thick layer of mucus started to spray alongside the calf. <br />
<br />
Next, it&#39;s front legs appeared, followed by the rest of it&#39;s trunk. Jade was moaning and mooing loudly, as she continued to push. &quot;Almost there, hon.&quot; Mark said, holding her hoof. &#39;NGGGGGHHH!!!&quot; Jade pushed as hard as she could, forcing the baby calf and the rest of it&#39;s body out. It softly landed onto the grass as the mucus covering it dripped off onto the grass. <br />
<br />
Jade bellowed out in pain, but was extremely glad that that was over, adjusting her legs so that they won&#39;t be as splayed apart for room.  Mark rushed over to the calf, quickly taking of the membrane off of it and checking it&#39;s gender. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a girl!&quot; Mark exclaimed. Jade was too overwhelmed and tired to react, so she continued mooing. Mark gently carried and moved the little calf over to Jade&#39;s face, where she noticed her, finally. The calf was covered with blood and mucus, but to Jade, the calf was all that really mattered in that moment. Violent contractions all worth it for this puny thing. It put a weak smile to her face, ignoring all the pain that was succumbed to her. <br />
<br />
Mark came with a wheelbarrow filled with hay and some empty cloth. He shuffled the hay all over the calf to keep her warm. Oddly enough, Jade still felt something inside her womb that she couldn&#39;t explain. It was like something smaller was still left in there. Her cervix had not fully closed yet. She didn&#39;t have time to ask questions yet, as she was still in great pain, and only minutes after she birthed the calf.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t really care about anything at that moment, all except the calf. She didn&#39;t know if it was instinctual or something else, but she could not take her eyes off of the calf. The way it shook it&#39;s little head was adorable. It&#39;s fur, though, was soaking wet. It also looked pretty cold, seeing as the womb is much less cold than the outside world. She did not pay any attention to her surroundings, until the second batch of contractions hit.<br />
<br />
Soon, the violent clenching of her stomach continued, and the thing inside her stomach started to move down her womb, and enter her cervix. The pain was intense, but not as painful as the calf. No, this one was smaller. Much smaller. It continued to slide down her aching vagina, seemingly with ease. &quot;M, m-MARK! THERE&#39;s, m-MOORE!&quot; she yelled, moaning as she prepares to push again. Mark heard her, and immediately went back to inspect her.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hold on, push!&quot; he said. And so Jade pushed, not knowing what this&#39;ll lead up to. Mark thought this was her afterbirth, but it usually isn&#39;t this alarming. the cow&#39;d just push it out when it comes. <br />
<br />
Anyway, her sore pussy once again opened, this time not as wide. I lifted my tail up, as the thing I presumed was the head began to exit her pussy. Jade moaned, this one more pleasure than pain, as the head came popping loose. She looked back to see Mark&#39;s jaw dropped. She wanted to say something, but all she could say at the moment was either a moo or a yelp. <br />
<br />
Soon, the rest of it&#39;s body slid out of her easily, and she finally could rest. She saw a peach-ish blur being carried by Mark. It turned out to be a normal human child. Jade felt much lighter, seeing that both of them had exited the building that was Jade&#39;s womb. It was sunset, and in the afternoon, and Jade was too exhausted to stand up, so for that night, she slept outside in her personal pen. <br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
The calf and the newborn were eventually named Rosie and Tommy (The calf being Rosie and the newborn being Tommy). <br />
<br />
Every morning after her birth, Rosie had been greedily feeding off of Jade&#39;s milk. She never had any experience in breast feeding, and Rosie&#39;s sucking motion was much different to Mark&#39;s. Though, it was still cute to see her hungrily swallow her teats and milk. She was reckless and messy when it came to her being fed. <br />
<br />
Tommy was the complete opposite, however. Whenever Mark came in with him to feed, he was gentle with his sucking motion, getting as much milk as he could in his mouth, and swallowing it instantly. Jade didn&#39;t like when they nursed at the same time because she always gets a little rowdy when that happens, so they try to move the feeding schedule as much as they could. <br />
<br />
Little time was spent on milking, since both of them were thorough with their meals. If Rosie had already eaten only hours before, she would only have half of what she&#39;d normally have. Mark would have to come in and manually milk her, in which Jade was relieved of the lingering pressure. <br />
<br />
After about 4 months, Rosie was completely weaned, and was placed in a separate pen in which calves would go when they were ready to eat solid materials. Jade was a little sad to let her go at first, but then realized she could visit her whenever she needed to go outside of the barn. In fact, she technically is free to walk anywhere. <br />
<br />
Mark was thinking about selling the farm, seeing that they&#39;ve racked up enough money to move, thanks to Jade&#39;s previous milkings. Tommy proffered to drink out of a bottle than directly from Jade&#39;s udder, so Mark returned to milking her once more. Jade really enjoyed life as a dairy cow, relaxing all day, being relieved from your sensitive udder, and overall no work being given. <br />
<br />
So, this is basically the end of Jade and Mark&#39;s journey so far, but all take a huge turn when....</p>
