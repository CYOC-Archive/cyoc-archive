<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jasper returned to the Muscat household to find that she had missed Sir Richard calling in. She was relieved as it meant she didn’t have to go for another stroll with him but at the same time she was miffed that she would not have the chance to ask about the change of outfit. What was going on? She remembered distinctly the original note from Richard had instructed her to wear the gold dress. She had already had Molly repair some minor tears in that dress and it was cleaned and just waiting to be worn. Now the Countess was instructing her to wear this white dress? Why?’ <br />
<br />
In the end she confided in Patricia who suggested Damon could seek out Sir Richard at the barracks and pass a note to him. Jaspar wrote a note and sent Damon to seek out Sir Richard and return with an answer. Meanwhile she had some hungry babies to feed.<br />
<br />
Damon returned to say that Sir Richard was not to be found. Evidently, he had departed with troops to meet the new Duke and his entourage.<br />
<br />
A note finally arrived after dark. A carriage would arrive to pick up Lady Jasmine at 11 the next morning. She was to wear the white dress and Lady Brook was to accompany her. The note was signed by the Countess.<br />
<br />
So next morning Jasper found herself once more bundled into the more than slightly over the top white dress the Countess had gifted her. Patricia, Molly, Penelope and Chelsea fussed around doing “Jasmine’s” hair and make-up and making sure that not a thread of her outfit was out of place. At least Jasper was able to continue feeding the babies as this was done. She hoped that she had pumped enough of her breastmilk to feed the other babies until she returned. She feared she might be gone all day herself and worried that Brook alone may not take enough of her milk to allow her to be comfortable.<br />
<br />
At 11.00 the Countess’s Carriage arrived, it was her larger, more ornate carriage. <br />
<br />
Jasper was surprised to find the Countess herself in the carriage. The Countess apparently approved of Jaspar’s appearance. ‘You look suitably attired Lady Jasmine’ One of the Countess’s attendants took Lady Brook.<br />
<br />
They travelled to the gates to the Keep. The gates were manned with twice as many troops as usual, all in full ceremonial uniform. Jasper had not been inside the Keep itself since she had been emasculated. She was curious to see how it had been renovated.<br />
<br />
She was helped out of the carriage by one of the Countess’s footmen then followed the Countess inside. Jaspar was not even questioned. The Countess’s two female attendants also entered, one pushing Lady Brook in her carriage. The footmen remained.<br />
<br />
The Countess led her entourage to what had been the private quarters of the late Duke. There they entered a room and Jaspar found two other young ladies she did not know, also clad in fancy gowns. <br />
<br />
The Countess made introductions. ‘Lady Jasmine of Featherstone, meet Lady Felicity of Highfields and Lady Joanna St Croux’ The young women curtsied to Jaspar, she returned the gesture. ‘You are to wait here. I will return when all the arrangements are finalised. The Countess bustled out with one of her attendants. Only the attendant looking after Lady Brook remained.<br />
<br />
‘Do you ladies know what is going on?’ Jaspar asked the two young women. They looked to be in their late teens. <br />
<br />
‘I know not. My betrothed had a carriage sent for me. I have not seen him for two days’ said the red-headed girl who had been introduced as Lady Joanna.<br />
<br />
Lady Felicity, a brunette said ‘I have heard there is to be a wedding. My betrothed is a guard to the new Duke. It is rumoured he will wed on his day of indenture’ <br />
<br />
Jaspar continued &#39;I am also betrothed to a Captain in the army. I have not had word from him even though I requested such in a note last afternoon&#39;<br />
<br />
The brunette spoke &#39;I am curious. Were you ladies instructed to wear white or is it but a coincidence that we are all in white gowns?’<br />
<br />
‘The Countess requested I wear white. She gave no further information’ said the red-head.<br />
<br />
‘I was the same..’ Jasper’s reply was interrupted by the sound of many trumpets. It was a sound Jasper knew well as it heralded the arrival of royalty. Although, this time Jasper knew it to be heralding the arrival of a usurper. The other two ladies moved across to an open window. ‘Maybe we will catch a glimpse of the new Duke? I am so curious to find out who he is’<br />
<br />
‘Why I thought it was common knowledge’ said Lady Felicity. ‘Mine Isaac is Captain under the command of Lord Beckhom. Lord Beckom is to be made Duke’<br />
<br />
‘There they are. That is my beau Sir Conrad on the black horse’<br />
<br />
‘The man beside him on the roan is mine Isaac’ exclaimed Lady Felicity ‘Is he not handsome? And the man behind him is our new Duke&#39;<br />
<br />
Curiosity got the better of Jaspar, she moved over to the window and looked down. There she saw 4 horses trotting into the keep. They were leading a line of 3 carriages. Jaspar couldn’t help herself. ‘That is my Sir Richard on the grey’ She also observed Marcus Beckhom riding beside Richard.<br />
<br />
‘Sir Richard? That is Sir Richard Townshend. So you the woman who has captured his heart. Your Sir Richard and my Sir Conrad are firm friends. I have met Sir Richard on many occasions’<br />
<br />
‘The Sir Richard Townshend? I have never seen him in the flesh! He is rumoured to be the best horseman and best swordsman in the kingdom. On the grey you say!’ Lady Felicity had pushed to the front and was gazing at Richard. ‘Oh my! He is just as handsome as the rumours suggest! You will be the envy of all the girls in the Kingdom Lady Jasmine’<br />
<br />
Jaspar felt herself blushing. She had to admit that prancing on his grey stallion, Richard made a fine site.<br />
<br />
‘Is it true that he was the Crown Prince’s closest friend and gave court life away only because of loyalty to his father?’ This question was directed to Jaspar.<br />
<br />
‘So I have heard’ Jaspar did not want to elaborate.<br />
<br />
‘I’ve also heard that he intervened to save the old Duke’s daughters. I’ve heard they were partially stripped of their clothes and only Sir Richards intervention saved them from being ravished when our soldiers took this very keep, perhaps it was in this very room. Rumour has it that he disarmed and arrested 7 men by himself’<br />
<br />
‘I’ve heard on good authority it was 10 men’ added Lady Joanna ‘They had already had their way with the maids’<br />
<br />
‘Ahum!’<br />
<br />
They turned to see the Countess had re-entered the room. &#39;Your Excellency’ Lady Felicity gave a curtsey<br />
<br />
‘Hush Lady Felicity, Lady Joanna. You must remember “Our” soldiers do not rape and pillage. Only Royalist soldiers do such things. The scoundrels Sir Richard arrested were Royalist soldiers who turned on their masters. They wore Royalist uniforms when they were hung’<br />
<br />
‘Yes Your Excellency’ <br />
<br />
‘So Ladies, I’m guessing you are curious to discover why you are are all wearing white?’</p>
