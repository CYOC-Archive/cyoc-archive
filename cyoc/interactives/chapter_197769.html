<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">THEN, THE AMUSEMENT SO FAR-(this sounds better with the song &quot;don&#39;t you cry no more&quot; for the back story here.) stand looking into the park, it is full of males enjoying themselves as the Carnival music plays that the scene before you is one of vibrancy and color. Straight ahead of you there are three main buildings as A queue of boys and young men wait to ride the roller coaster that There is a fun house slightly back and looks a little disheveled. No one is around it that Red neon flashes to your right from a strip joint called &#39;Pleasure&#39;. This is gonna be fun that Seeing the door, you of course just have to enter it.<br />
<br />
Inside you see a long dark tunnel that Looking around to see if anyone can see you, you enter the tunnel and close the door behind you as you Creep down the tunnel and pass several wide doorways on both sides, but the growling noises warn you not to enter. You shouldn&#39;t be down here as it is that You hear the sound of dripping water from an open doorway and peer in to see a large, mirky pool. further along, you see what looks like heavy mechanical devices, including some sort of lifting gear as you Then you see light from around the corner that Peering round it, you find a large curtained doorway which leads outside to who knows where.<br />
<br />
you soon see a crowded arena that In the middle of the ring is a man wrestling with a 7 foot tall, and very muscular anthromorthic alligator. it looked like he was losing, but the gator soon has the guy pinned down in such a bodylock. Sure enough, he can&#39;t even move a finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, too bad You&#39;ve lost. we all know what that means, right?!&quot; says a pretty girl that enters the ring who is clearly the master of ceremonies as the crowd soon was crying out a &#39;HEE-HAW!!&#39; sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!!&quot; cries the man as he was still pinned under the gator when Suddenly his ears grow into donkey&#39;s ears that The gator gets off him while he continues to change. dropping down to all fours that The crowd laugh as he quickly becomes a real donkey and gallops out of the arena towards the curtain where you are hiding.<br />
<br />
the donkey gallops past while braying, not noticing you and disappears down the corridor as You press yourself against the side of the tunnel and peer out onto the arena again. the girl asked if there was another challenger while taking center stage that you feel a large hand grab you by the shoulder as a huge gorilla shortly after drags you out onto the arena. the gorilla said he found one in a loud voice while also saying you were snooping around backstage as he was staring down at you and that You turn to see him and gulp hard, yet saying you experienced something backstage is when the girl soon decided to have you take center stage with one of their champions for the crowd quickly cheer their approval.<br />
<br />
You look around in terror and see that the gator and gorilla have been joined by other large animals as there was A kangaroo, a hippo, an eagle, a snake, a bear, an octopus even a T-rex that you quickly decided to be in a fight challenge of a four on on round match off against the crocodile, the kangaroo, a bear, and most impotently, the T.Rex. making this match as you even raised the stakes on who of them beats that by wining all the four round match offs is where you win the prize while it becomes lesser if you were to lose even one match, yet if you should to lose all the matches with the rule of default is where the ring mistress decides what you&#39;ll receive. while wishing for better wrestlers like the mighty lion, a tough honey badger, a proud tiger, and a wolf to name off a few that the audience of the crowd up roared and cheered on the match up you claimed as she approved of it and the crowd goes wild.<br />
<br />
it wasn&#39;t long after when the snake-man ushers you over and leads you off stage to the back area, where you were left in a locker-room that tells you to get change into what appears to be a wrestling singlet and closes the door. The singlet smelled like it&#39;s been used before with the musk of sweat and other scents clinging to the fabric that you wondered when it was last washed, still you didn&#39;t want to become a donkey or worse as you you did just as he told you while thinking about the match you just made. it was a tight fit, but slightly concerned about how little it covers your package while it preserves your modesty well enough as you didn&#39;t know any good wrestling moves is where you see a laptop that you soon Open it up to find some files on each of the wrestlers your facing.<br />
<br />
finding footage and stats on each fighter for the ring as you watched a few matches on their style is where you come up with strategy to counter each of their movements on how to win while deciding to spend the rest of the time warming up that it was some time later when the girl came into the locker-room with the snake-man, say it was time for your first match and wished you luck with a smile and leads you back out into the arena to face off one of the four fighters. you see your first of the four challengers waiting for you that Once you get into the ring is where you can see in all his glory was an anthro wrestling bear.<br />
<br />
entering the ring and being forced toward him to get a better look for he was lat least seven-feet tall and covered in black fur while his ursine head watches you approach in the ring, waiting as you felt him giving you a glare that he&#39;s wearing only a singlet like yours. seeing his large bulge as to yet see his powerfully muscled limbs, even under the fur coating them that ring mistress announced your arrival while reminding the crowd the match off you made when the audience of the crowd up roared and cheered on the match up you once claimed for they went wild for it.<br />
<br />
being pushed in from the snake-man later as the MC soon declares the match to start that when the bell rang once is when you only had a split second to react when your opponent rushes towards you with an amazing agility speed while he was belied by his size, yet you were smaller than what he was where the only skill you had to stop him were to roll away from the bear a couple of times for it was the you think you can avoid the rush and dodging his attacks. doing so that it wasn&#39;t long for your foe to realize this and decided to climb up on one of the four poles as he then body slam onto the mat and shacks the ring, which made him into a dazed while you then quickly Stand up when you think he was fast, but not smart. quickly, you pin him down that with three slam count outs from the referee is when you won your first match round off when the song &#39;your the best around&#39; by Joe esposito as the bell rang three times while the MC announced the winner in surprise, which was you when the bear-man soon rose up and out of his daze.<br />
<br />
after the MC speak again, saying it&#39;s time to see what our bear-man&#39;s punishment will be was then two huge, furry arms wrap around you as you expected him to change into a donkey, but nothing was happening that he then looks down on you with a sad look and lifts you up while The bear then carries you offstage and a hurry. To add insult to injury as the bear still has you in a hold is where He hefts you down a side hallway to what appears to be his dressing room and closes the door behind him that You try to squirm out from under him, but to no avail when he was soon rubbing his groin on the backside of the couch. you can tell he was getting hard while figuring You were not going anywhere as the bear continues to grind, but what came next surprised you that you didn&#39;t see it coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;punish me. you&#39;ve won, what&#39;s my punishment going to be? what i&#39;m doing now would of been you if I were to win for my prize, but I didn&#39;t. please, tell me. what is my punishment as i&#39;ll do anything, and i mean anything that i&#39;ll even let you keep me for a wrestling league start up back home. please, anything is better with you around then staying here and humping the couch, or those pour wrestlers that were turn into donkeys.&quot; You hear the beast speak while his muzzle quickly grabs the couch head area as in an intense state he was in that tears were falling out of him now.<br />
<br />
thinking on what his punishment will be as he was crying in torment, yet pleasure that he wanted to stop and do you. you wanted to possibly keep him that you were hesitant for a second before answering him on his punishment to be as you then thought of an idea to solve both of your problems. he slowed down to hear you speak that you soon told him his punishment to be. as he soon stops and hears you out, with fear in his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;your punishment is to have make me into a better fighter that once finish, you&#39;ll be my first wrestling league fighter starter up back at my place for i&#39;m going to keep you. do I make myself clear for you punishment?&quot; you said as his fear soon vanished and lowered his head in shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;if that is what my failer leads to be, then so be it.&quot; he said sadly, but you soon curated him to saying boss, sir, or master to you. understanding what you mean that he soon acknowledge your meaning and said sir to you as you both soon started your training for your next match.<br />
<br />
with one match won that it was an hour and a half till you were buff and ready for you next match. soon the mistress came in with the snake-man, with a bag in hand as she knew what his punishment was that she told him pack up for he was fired when she glares at you madly. saying that she now lost one bear fighter because of you, but made an extra match she made to replace the one she lost as you realized she now has another bear-man to replace the one she just lost to you.<br />
<br />
though she sighed and snapped her fingers that soon the bear-man with his pack bag in hand and vanish, fading from sight as he was shortly at your place while being your first ever wrestling league fighter starter up. shortly after, another bear-man simply moves right on in as this one was a grizzly type that they shortly after lead you out of the room.<br />
<br />
Leading you back to the ring and see your second fighter of the four challengers, waiting for you that once again is where you get into the ring as you can see in all of his glory this time around, the wrestler you&#39;ll be facing was now an anthro crocodile. once in the ring that he seamed to be about 220 pounds in weight and is 7&#39;0&quot; tall that he looked almost like any other alligator. you both prepare to fight that with one win and some training with the bear-man, you were ready like no one&#39;s business.<br />
<br />
&quot;and here&#39;s your challenger, folks. for those who are just now coming here today with us is where he&#39;ll be fighting our four boys in a four on one round match off that he has won against our very own bear-man and gave his punishment as he&#39;s still on a one on one in each match as their are three more rounds to go. if he should lose, even by default is where the ring mistress here will see what he&#39;ll receive of a lesser prize, but if he win it all is where the the prize is all his. with that in mind, let the match. . . begin.&quot; the MC said that the audience of the crowd up roared and quickly cheered on the match up you once claimed as the crowd was going wild while you were looking back at the corner the croc-man was in, quickly saw fear on his face for it was the same fear the bear-man showed just before leaving to be at your home. you knew that he too needed help, but how were you going to pull this off without fooling anybody?<br />
<br />
it wasn&#39;t long for the MC to start up the second match of the four rounds that the bell rang once again for the two of you got into the mood and focus on each other while he gets down on all fours and runs after you and head butts you in the legs, but this time your ready as it was thanks to the bear-man&#39;s training and almost knocks you over. Catching yourself as you quickly regained balance is when he then rears back to do it again on you, but in one swift move that you kick him in the head and jump over him as you got down on all fours yourself for you then ran at him like he did with you as you soon hit him in the side when you quickly grab him and almost got him out of the ring by force. However, he kicks you away and nearly slashes at your eye as you quickly jumped back that he tried to knock you over once more to pin you down for it didn&#39;t work out this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;you&#39;re good, better even. he must of trained you before he left. can&#39;t wait to see what else makes you tick.&quot; he said as you told him hat it&#39;s not over till the last move is played as you got some tricks up your sleeve that you were saving up for. shortly after, you used his own tail against him somehow and grab one arm behind him while twisting it for you were soon able to use your feet to kick him down to his knees and fling him down with his head touching the mat floor. he tries his best to break free from you as he can, but to of no use when he made one last attempt to stand up for you were already coming after him like a bee in its hive that you knock him back down while pinning him in the process when he kept on struggling with you.<br />
<br />
It however came of to no avail for it was with your new strength as they are able to keep him down for with a few seconds after that is when it wasn&#39;t long until he finally gives up by tapping out. knowing you won your second match off as the bell rang three times that if you didn&#39;t know any better is when you thought they wanted you to lose the first two matches, but the croc-man soon rose up as the MC started to speak up again. like before, he said that it&#39;s time to see what the croc-man&#39;s punishment will be as it was then two huge, scale-like arms wrap around you and lifts you up to carry you offstage while he looks down on you with a sad look on his face.<br />
<br />
Quickly as before, He hefts you down a side hallway to what appears to be his dressing room and closes the door behind him. unlike before though as he then release you is when he was soon kneeling down before, like a knight in armor to you that you can tell he was really strong for there was something deep down inside him to maybe a nice loyal man while also expecting him to say to punish him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I didn&#39;t know that I could be beaten so easily, you are a natural wrestler. still, a match is a match as I lost.&quot; he began to say as he then took a deep breath and sighed it out that he already knew you were trained by the bear-man for the match. &quot;please, tell me, what is my punishment going to be? you&#39;ve won, i&#39;ll do anything you want me to. please, anything is better with you around then staying here and making those pour asses out of the fighters that lose in our ring. i&#39;ll even let you keep me for a wrestling league start up back home, like you did for my friend.&quot; You hear the beast speak as was soon intense state that tears were falling out of him now, pleaing for help for you barely heard him when he quietly whispered.<br />
<br />
you wanted to possibly keep him, but this time you didn&#39;t hesitant a second before answering him on his punishment to be. walking up to him as you stopped to put a hand on his (and I mean his) left shoulder that you soon told him his punishment to be when he settle down to hear you speak. With fear in his face that he knew he asked for it. &quot;ok gator-man, listen up. your punishment is to have the same punishment I gave to the bear-man as you&#39;ll train me into a better fighter that once your done and finish with me, you&#39;ll be my second wrestling league fighter starter up back at my place for i&#39;m going to keep you. there may be a third or fourth member that once there, you&#39;ll start building a large structure house for both you to live in, and a place for training and matches. do I make myself clear for you punishment?&quot; you said as his fear soon vanished and lowered his head in shame, just as the bear-man did.<br />
<br />
with two matches won now that you had a 50/50 chance of wining the greatest wrestling league match off challenge as you were getting more buff up then before as you were soon ready for you next match for soon the snake-man and the mistress came in with a bag in hand for she knew what his punishment was while telling him to pack up. she told him that he was fired as she then glares madly at you once more while saying she now lost yet another fighter because of you, yet somehow squeezed in an extra match she made to replace the one she&#39;s now losing to replace the one she just lost to you for you realized she now has an anthro black crocodile man. just like before that with a snap of her fingers as she sighed, the gator-man with his pack bag of belongings in hand had vanished. fading from sight as he was shortly at your place while being your wrestling league fighter starter up that feeling the two beast-man were going to be ok back home is where the croc-man simply moves right on in to take the place of the old one for it was shortly after they lead you out of the room when she told you to feel lucky on winning half the the match so far.<br />
<br />
&quot;you should feel lucky, now that you&#39;ve won about half of the challenge you made. still, you won&#39;t be turned into a donkey as I said that I can still simply make you into something more fitting for you. With This said that you only have two more matches left to go. So sooner or later, your luck&#39;s gonna run out.&quot; she said angerly as she had to go through something for what you had done for botn now the gator-man that you somehow let him free from this place, but at the same time that she seemed more happy about your winnings for it wasn&#39;t long till they both were leading you back to the ring, to were your next fighter of the four challengers was waiting for you in the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;here&#39;s your challenger, folks. for those who are just now coming here today with us is where he&#39;ll be fighting our four boys in a four on one round match off that he has won against two of our very own beast-man and gave his punishment as he&#39;s still on a one on one in each match for there are still two more rounds to go. if he should lose, even by default is where the ring mistress here will see what he&#39;ll receive of a lesser prize for if he should win it all that the grand prize is all his. with that in mind, fighters. . . at the ready in your corners.&quot; the MC said that the audience of the crowd was going wild for the match up you once claimed as the crowd roared and quickly cheered on. Once again as you get into the ring, you ready yourself for your match that you can see in all of his glory for he was already ready and waiting for you in the ring. still thinking about his tail then who you were up against might be something to worry about in the match. looking back at the corner that how were you going to pull this off without fooling anybody? it was some time later for the MC to start up the third match of the four rounds. as you both prepare to fight that he thanked you for both the bear-man and the gator-man for he showed a hand out while taking it for a shake for he then wished you luck while wishing him luck as well, but you needed it the most and hoping to see the out come of this match in one piece.<br />
<br />
seeing no fear out of him, you knew he wasn&#39;t like the two you fought before as you sent the two boys at your home for there punishment that the MC soon started up again while you wondered why he stalled this time around. &quot;is everyone ready?&quot; the MC said that the crowed cheered, but the the MC teased the audience as he left a hand closer to his ear. saying the one line as the MC did this made a louder cheer from the crowed that the MC was stun at how loud some could be. &quot;well that&#39;s more like it. still, let the match. . . begin.&quot; the MC said as the bell shortly rang for the match to start that your wrestling against one of the beast-man for you were facing off with the mighty anthro Tyrannosaurs Rex, T.rex for short.<br />
<br />
he was intimidating, he was 7&#39;8 tall with a rather large bulge in his very pale red singlet as it was practically pink while having a well muscled body to boot. It had a little different design, since it had little sleeves for it looked like they were from a T-Shirt when they were actually not attached to the rest of the outfit as it was similar on his ankles while the spandex belt could be said the same on his waist. Thank god for your two wrestlers you now have as they had you take training lessons for this very fight that you didn&#39;t know how this match will turn out for you were intimidated, but you steel yourself for it was some time later to have the MC on having the third match of the four rounds to begin while you both prepare to fight for it was shortly after when the bell rang for the match to start. You also see a few random items within reach of the ring, which were to spice up this round of the match that this went on for over Fifteen minutes later for you were still fighting in the ring as you thought fast enough to let your feet slide out from under you for you then ended up on the Rex&#39;s other side of the floor though while you quickly then get back to your feet. <br />
<br />
you make a jab a his shoulder, succeeding as you backpedal out of range with a quick observation. sliding beneath is when you tore off his outfit, more then you did before as you could now see 3 of his 8 pack for they were a rather impressive peck that when he Then sprinted at you is where he tried to claw at your abdomen. before he could however, you respond by punching him in the face as to stopping him that it was Seconds after you found out his scales did not make good effort like before for you were dodging a few good jabs when you shortly grabbed a hold of his top part of the singlet. it tore like before for this time however was where you were expecting it while it tears that you pull him in closer to you for a really good punch to throw at him for with this out of the way, the top half of his gear now hung to his knees for he was Getting angry now as he simply then rips off both of the remains of the front and back while trowing them out to the side of the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;gah, he got him ticked!?&quot; the girl of the match said while being shocked that by doing this as you could now see his muscled top half in all its glory for it was quite a bit with those large pecks, with all those muscle. it was like fighting the gator man from before, but only tougher as a burst of rage came charging at me again that after he charged at me, he pushed me down right near the edge of the ring when he then grabbed a hammer. back yourself in a corner while looking for something to use is when you randomly grab something to to hit this rex wrestler with in the face that what you shortly grabbed to hit him with was a.... wait, a fish!?<br />
<br />
you were both surprised by this as you knock the hammer out of his hands that he fell face first into the ropes, which he shortly became tangled up in for his his Face towards the audience while his back to you, upside down you may add that Getting a devious idea is where you then climb up the ropes a little for you then grabbed a set of what were now the T.rex&#39;s shorts and jump back while you pull down for he was now receiving a wedgie of his life time. his eyes squinted shut in pain for when you landed back in the ring is when you hear a klink and glancing down to see a pair of hand cuffs that you soon got another idea.<br />
<br />
there he was, Blast From The Past as he was tangled upside down and nearly flashing his asshole to the audience that he was blushing while Feeling the humiliation with his eyes closed for he now felt ashamed in this fight. since his legs were being kept forcefully spread by the ropes while trying to use his arms to cover his ass was nearly impossible for they weren&#39;t caught up in the rope as he did thought of his tail, but the tail wasn&#39;t long enough to do so for covering his crotch won&#39;t do him much good ether that it looked more likely he was making out and jerking off when he then felt you pulling on the belt. Getting angry by this now was when he lashes out at you with his tail, but it just put him in your trap for his tail was caught up in the belt that covering himself with it was a no go while quickly using the cuffs to loop through the belt on his wrists and trap them just by the use of his own tail as The belt was obviously made of a very strong, and stretchy material when the Rex realized he was lo longer in control of this match and squirmed to get free of the ropes for you Seeking to add on to his humiliation.<br />
<br />
soon after that BFTP gets untangled and manages to fall back into the ring for he manages to get onto his knees as he couldn&#39;t get his balance enough to stand up for his ass was just sticking up in the air while you later found something else to use on him and you walk over to the T.rex wrestler with it while he was squirming, Eyes watering in pain. Once you were close enough for him to hear is when you whispered something to him. &quot;just relax and enjoy, or this will hurt you a whole lot worse than what it is.&quot; he whimpered quite a bit, but he nodded his head to what you were saying to him. since you feel so little resistance is when you decided he deserves a reward and reached your hand to stroke his cock, both inside his shorts and out for he was Now feeling more pleasure than pain while having lost the will to fight back that he starts to moan loudly as you then later jump on to his back while driving his legs out from under him. one of his hands instinctively then swings at you as it comes dangerously close to slicing you, but before he did that you grab it for you felt Angry at what he tried to do is when you then grab the fish from earlier and start to spank him furiously with it for you did this a few dozen times for he seems to be actually, enjoy this to simply given up and just let you do what ever you wanted with him.<br />
<br />
Deciding it was long enough that you step away from BFTP and pin him down for three seconds, winning the match as the bell rang three times while signaling that you won your third match off is when a few doctors come out and took Blast From The Past backstage. soon after, the MC announced the winner of the match while in surprise once more. &quot;and here&#39;s your winner, the challenger!&quot; like before before though with both croc-man and the bear-man, it was time to see what the punishment BFTP will be as the girl approached you for she then leads you offstage and down a side hallway to what appears to be the rex&#39;s dressing room that quickly as before, you entered while she closed it behind you.<br />
<br />
seeing him on the bed as the doctors were making sure he was aright that one called her in the room. over hearing them talk about him as the others left that they said he won&#39;t be fighting for quite some time now for you were soon heading over to give him his punishment while deciding on what it will be. you can tell he was really strong, but deep down inside him was a nice man while also expecting him to be a bit kinky that when the doctor was done talking to her and left the room is when you soon told him what was going to happen to him on his punishment.<br />
<br />
You-&quot;I see your well, but I heard that you&#39;re out of the ring for a while. true I&#39;ve won the fight and everything, but that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re safe from getting your punishment for losing the match form me, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
BFTP-&quot;it&#39;s bad enough that you tore off most of my outfit, humiliated in the ring, and now you want to punish me even more then what I went through today.!&quot; he said angerly at you, almost ready to use his t.rex jaws to rip you a good one. before he did though that the girl also wanted to hear what his punishment would be while giving you a mean old glare at you for taking two of her wrestlers as she was lucky to find their replacements in time.<br />
<br />
You-&quot;thanks ma&#39;am. now then, as for you punishment is where from here on out that once you&#39;re better is when it will begin. you&#39;ll be retiring for at least tree to five years now that you&#39;ll also be training newer wrestlers when they come as they&#39;ll also be turned into different types of anthros here, besides me. by that time, you&#39;ll be back on your feet and ready to be with the others in no time at all. dose this seem far miss?&quot; you said that her expression went from being angry to surprise, but nodded for she agreed to his punishment.<br />
<br />
BFTP-&quot;well, if it&#39;s ok with her that I can&#39;t argue about it I guess.&quot; he said calmly. know that his wrestling time in the ring will be put off for now as he felt sad about it. the two of you soon left his room while closing the door behind, for him to get some rest with some r and r time. shortly after, she asked if you were interested on a little deal the girl was offering as you still have a match with the kangaroo wrestler ahead. true you won three of your four matches that even if you lose now, you&#39;ll get second place prize as you wonder what the first place prize would be.thinking about it now that she was soon gone as she went backstage. Thinking about it now for the deal she offered did intrigued you that yoou thought of listening to what kind of deal she had for you, but you still have a match coming up soon with the kangaroo. So, no deal with her at the time as you go get ready for your final round and prepare yourself by heading over to the training gym, unaware that the kangaroo was already there and pumping up with training also. As you approached to see the wrestling roo training aggressively by the punching bag that you could tell he was made at something while overhearing why from the distance of the Shadows. &quot;I can&#39;t believe this! After all that we been through together, you both end up losing to this... this nobody!?!? The three of us all promised that we would all stay here as her anthro wrestlers, till it was time for us to leave the island together. I know that if he should lose this match up, he&#39;ll be turned into an anthro wrestler, one of us. Still, this is my last match that it&#39;ll be all or nothing for me at this point. I&#39;ll be able to finally leave this island freely, but I don&#39;t want to end up being sold somewhere to box while being completely change into my new feral form. If only I could find someone that&#39;s willing to help, but who?&quot; He sais as he was now almost into tears while finding out his fate of being someone&#39;s pet boxing roo, should he lose that is.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the shadows and into the training room that he shortly after rubbed it off and quickly went off to train as you Find an empty spot next to him for you soon started to train with him. That&#39;s when you made your move as to what you&#39;re about to say while thinking about what you heard earlier from him. &quot;Don&#39;t talk, just keep trying with me.&quot; You said as he didn&#39;t even make eye contact with you when the girl from before sees you training with the anthromorphic kangaroo and shortly left, without saying a word. Now it was clear what you are going to say to him as this maybe your only chance to tell him what&#39;s on you&#39;re mind, and thought about making the stack higher for his last match here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, I don&#39;t blame you for hating me on taking your two friends out of here without you, but they were good wrestlers as one of them mentioned me to start my very own wrestling league start up back home. They even wanted it out of me, so I told them that they could by joining my team. If you&#39;d want to, i could have you be put into it with your friends as you&#39;d be my third member of my team. ...I also over heard that this is your last fight here as your fate might end up someone&#39;s pet boxing kangaroo, should you lose this match.&quot; You said while not making eye contact and focusing on your training as the roo-man did the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you know why I can&#39;t afford to lose this fight. I&#39;m no one&#39;s pet! However, you also know why I want to join your wrestling league start up team back home. My friends are there as they&#39;ll start without me there.&quot; he said while pumping up some iron that it made yours to shame as you were working out with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, technically they can&#39;t start without me there as I&#39;m somehow there wrestling league leader. If you did want to join that one, you&#39;ll not going to be turned into your feral form as you&#39;ll be as you look like now. Two, you&#39;ll be treated well and some pet, unless you want to. So even if you somehow get sold to me, you&#39;ll basically be antro with your other friends there as i&#39;ll be like your new father to you.&quot; You mentioned while lifting more weights then him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if you lose? You&#39;ll be turned into an anthro wrestler, and be forced to be stuck here for who knows how long she wants you for. Again that should you lose this as things are now, Are you sure you&#39;re ok with what will happen to you?&quot; He asked while sounding concerned on your safety now that you simply showed him this by giving a military like nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haw-Hee-Haw!!&quot; That&#39;s when you both heard the man who turned donky as you turn your gaze to him, even he was looking at this ass of a mule.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like he&#39;s still in there, even if he&#39;s now just a donkey to the human eyes. Still, a donkey no less.&quot; he said as you couldn&#39;t believe that he was understanding him, like he hasn&#39;t even been turned into an animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, What are you going to do to him?&quot; You asked as he swiftly got off of his training and up over to the donkey. You didn&#39;t get a response from him till he was next to him as he then whispered something into his ear for it was, &quot;wish me luck in my last fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean, what are you going to do with him?&quot; You asked, tillting your head a bit to this on what&#39;s going on here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not what I&#39;m going to do with him, is what you who&#39;s going to do with him. You see, the deal was for his lose in the ring was that who ever he sees first who&#39;s human after he fully charged into (caugh to clarify something) an ass is where this person will change his fate forever. Since he now sees you, you now have to change his fate for the better, or for the worst. The choice is yours, what do you want his punishment now to be?&quot; He said that you soon had a thought of some use to him and told him what his punishment shall be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there is one thing that I&#39;ve thought of, but it&#39;s entirely up to him. Do you accept this punishment that I&#39;m about to receive for you, down from the bottom of your soul?&quot; You said this donkey that with a few nods, he was ready to accept his fate to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, here gose. For your punishment that you&#39;ll forget you were ever human to begin with, for now as you&#39;ll only remember what I&#39;m about to tell you. Not only you like to crossdress in a girly fashion getup, but you&#39;re also one of my anthro wrestlers. my third wrestling league start up fighters back at my home who loves a practical joke now a days. (If you see the tv show M.A.S.H. mobile Army Surgical Hospital, then think of the two amy surgents as one is hawkeye pierce.) Hmmmm. You know, that donkey dosen&#39;t fit you, when a stripped hyena will. Your family will know what happened to you as you like your new life style that your former memories of them will caseually returns back to you each day, but not from pleasure island here. Even though you&#39;re now my third that my other two wrestlers will train you to be a better fighter. ...when I snap my fingures together, you&#39;ll vanish from sight and reapear at my home where you&#39;ll see the gator - man at work and the bear - man helping him. I also want you to help them out as your things will pop up shortly after you arive.&quot; You told him as he was braying at you like crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;(You can&#39;t be serious!? You can&#39;t do this to me! Change me back right now! Haw-Haw-Hee-Haw!? Hee-haw-Haw-Hee-Haw-Hee! Haw-Hee-Haw-Hee-Haw!&quot; Even though you didn&#39;t understand what he was saying that the kangaroo wrestler had to help translate for you, unaware he was already changing into his useful form of a anthro stripped hyena wrestler for With a quick snap of your fingers is when he was soon gone as he was reapeared at your house. He saw two beast men of a bear and a gator working on a building of sorts as he could remember why though. All he remembers right now though was that he was your third wrestling league start up with them as he soon enough, helped them build.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I&#39;m better off fighting with you, then against you. You still got my back if I loose, right?&quot; He said that before you had a chance to answer his question is when the snake man entered as he was slithering around looking for you both, saying to get our butts in gear while head on back to the ring within 5 minutes for he was panting out of breath and then slithered off once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, time to get moving. You coming?&quot; You said to him that the wrestler before you was ready as he&#39;ll ever be shape in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y, yah. Sorry about earlier.&quot;he said, hoping to get this match done and over with as you reached up to his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;don&#39;t worry about it man. and as for your question, I got your back. hope you got the same thing for mine, when it comes.&quot; You said that with a quick nod, you both shock each other&#39;s hands as you left the gym to enter the ring for the greatest fight of your life.<br />
<br />
NOW-(the song don&#39;t you cry no more ends here as it time for the actual story to begin... NOW.) as you were both walking up to the ring from the training gym for the greatest fight of your life with this kangaroo-man that the MC mistress was already in the ring, ready to announce the final fight of the greatest wrestling league match off challenge. though you wished to to fight off against something cooler like a mighty lion, a tough honey badger, a proud tiger, even a cool wolf as this was to name a few off, but you did get a few starters that you now have a bear-man, an alligator-man, and even a stripped hyena-man while hoping to save this wrestling kangaroo for your team off. This is where the fate of fighting warriors lay it out on the line as the announcement began.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here&#39;s our challenger, folks. For those of you who are just now coming here today with us is where he&#39;ll be fighting our fourl boys in a four on one round match off that he has won against three of our very own beast-man and gave his punishment as he&#39;s still on a one on one in each match for there are still one more rounds to go. if he should lose, even by default is where the ring mistress here will see what he&#39;ll receive of a lesser prize for if he should win it all that the grand prize is all his. with that in mind, our challenger has drawn Red Jack. This fighter has knocked out over three hundred wrestlers that sadly, this is his last match with us today. this could be the moment as to who will win this match up. Will it be Red Jack, or will it be our challenger? To this... let the final round of the greatest wrestling league match off challenge... begin. Fighters. . . at the ready in your corners.&quot; The MC said that the audience of the crowd was going wild for the match up you once claimed as the crowd soon roared and quickly cheered on, more then usual for some were even crying out for on being the underdog challenger.<br />
<br />
Hoping up to your corner now that looking back to his corner, how are you going to pull this off without fooling anybody? As you both prepare to fight while hoping to see the out come of this match in one piece that seeing no fear out of him, you knew he wasn&#39;t like the three you fought before for you sent the two of his boys packing at your home for there punishment. There were no words to say, when your faces said it all as you each had abit of fear kept hidden when everything was on the line that the MC soon started up the match. With everythingat stack, both you and the kangaroo wrestler just can&#39;t afford to lose this match for one shall stand and one shall fall.<br />
<br />
Within moments, the bell shortly rang for the match to start as your wrestling against one of the four beast-man left. First there was the bear-man, then the alligator-man, followed by a T.Rex-man, and now you&#39;re up against Red Jack, the kangaroo-man. Though you wished to be in the ring with a mighty lion, a tough honey badger, a proud tiger, even a nice wolf that this fighter was at least 7 foot tall while wearing boxing gloves and blazing red and yellow shorts as his chest was wrapped up around in a white bondage cloth for  concealment. To tell the truth, you weren&#39;t really willing to fight the kangaroo that as soon you started to stand up though is where the kangaroo took a swing at your head. Luckily for you that it missed as you got in about 3 solid blows on the kangaroo wrestler, before getting jabbed into the gut with a good one.<br />
<br />
He moved so fast that you&#39;re not entirely sure what he hit you with, but it was definitely something for it really hurts...a lot. You stumble backwards to get your barrings, but his shifts to the right strikes you again in the face that by the time you get your hands up to block your head, he hits you with a body blow as he climb up on the ring corner&#39;s top end to jump while his tail gave him the advantages of his balance landing. Definitely feeling groggy now as it occurred to you that if you&#39;re going to fight, now would be a good time for a comeback for you better do it now. You turn to give him a really strong right uppercut to his chin, landing a massive blow that you&#39;ve seen almost all of the Rock movies to know how this match will end up as for you were almost out of strange to fight anymore.<br />
<br />
By the time he&#39;s peppering you with his right and left fury attacks of his fists that just before even one manages to land you a fatal hit for the win, the lights flickered green, red, blue, white, yellow, even purple as the giant screen tv shows different anthro wrestlers for this also surprise the MC. On it were the white dragon looking wrestler as he doesn&#39;t have wings (looks a little like shinning saber from in the land of leadale that sure enough, that&#39;s his name to), a mighty black lion with a gorgeous beautiful red mane for it was well said with his red tufted tail, a muscular and beat up looking brown wolf (he looks more like a drawing of wolfali&#39;s your next!) And finally a blue shark for which they call him riptide for it was because of all those drawings of him in furaffinity and deviantart. The song was going off for them at the time was &quot;no more words (wwe edit)&quot; by endeverafter that while he was distracted by what&#39;s going on, you took this opportunity to sneak up behind him and grabbing to a bear hug lock as you then flipped him over for a back arch to have his shoulders touching the mate. Surprised by this move as he was struggling that flinging his tail around while kicking in the air didn&#39;t help him escape from your grasp that the  referee started to slam the hand onto the floor, for the count out.<br />
<br />
&quot;One, Two, Three!&quot; And with that, you won your match against all adds on the kangaroo... no, The greatest wrestling league match off challenge you&#39;ve ever made. Just then,  the music changed to &quot;win in the end by mark safan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And here&#39;s our winner as to our new greatest wrestling league match off challenge of all time, the challenger!&quot; The MC said that the audience of the crowd was going wild upon your winning streak for you then noticed something about him as the MC got closer to him with the collar for him to be sold as a feral boxing pet, he was actually a she this whole time. Making your way over to her first while making good on your promise that the MC was stun to not only see what you were doing, but also to what you were saying to her for she was more than past upset about this by now to the point of her getting boiling mad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember our promise? Don&#39;t worry, I got your back.&quot; You said for you then told the audience about what her punishment shall be, But the MC tried to intervene while saying to the audience upon her faver to what the punishment of the kangaroo wrestler had planned on going in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, now then. as for your punishment.&quot; You had time to say, before the MC interrupted on to your speech.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now hold your training wheels there challenger. First of all, you don&#39;t make the punishment for the roo&#39;s fight here, I do. Secondly, there are rules here that needs to be followed by.&quot; The MC said, sounding confident on her speach. That is, until you mentioned the bet you made while in the gym with the kangaroo wrestler that the MC was stun paled by this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well actually, you&#39;re right about following the rules. if you count bets before the match however, then you would be the one not following the rules. Now would that be fun?&quot; You said that the MC turned to the snake-man as he acknowledged everything he heard while the two were training in the gym was true. This forced the MC to stand down from this as you began to punish the kangaroo wrestler from where you left off, now infront of the audience to see and mostly hear all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, back to what we were saying about your punishment shall be. First off as it&#39;s true this is your last fight here, before being sold off to be someone&#39;spet boxing kangaroo that is also in a feral form. however, I&#39;ve decided to claim you as one of my own wrestling league fighter starter Ups. (This is where you tug her closer for only her ears can hear that this was you Whispering into her ear.) And I know that you&#39;re a tomboy female kangaroo, so this is what I&#39;m going to do with you for desiving me. Your further punishment shall be to remain at a female kangaroo wrestler fighter as you&#39;ll be my first ever wrestling league fighter starter up diva while secretly battling as you are, with a small bonus of a boxing kangaroo joey hiding in your pouch of yours. You&#39;re not sure how or where it came from, but your motherly  Instinct of keeping it and raising this young joey as if it were your own child. True you were once male when you got here, but you&#39;re leaving here you are now. You also remember your human memories before coming to the island, but you can&#39;t help as you want to be mounted by a kangaroo stud as this embarrasses you while blushing red for this. Truth be told, you actually enjoy this as the boys back home will find out about your secret of being a female kangaroo wrestler sooner or later that when they did, they&#39;ll probably want to have a go with you on having S...E...X. anyway, back to this young joey of yours. It won&#39;t age as it will mostly stay small enough to fit into your pouch as it be in there with you when you go out boxing, but comes out most of the rest that the boys back home will take really good care of the young as if each of them were it&#39;s very own uncles. While out of the pouch and in the ring of ether boxing, or wrestling that everything around you wll immediately turn you on as you feel like in heat all the time for the only wayto cool you down is to do one of the following. One, you must have sex in the morning, noon, and night. two, you pleasure yourself while being milked. Three, you go to the training gym area and train yourself, till you can&#39;t no more. and finally, you  restrain yourself by being tied up into certain bondage items like a muzzle, straitjacket, anything to keep this bad girl style in place. You also have a strange fetish for that lion for you think of him as your boyfriend crush. (You then slowly remove yourself from her as you the announcement on her.) You&#39;ll also tell me about the four wrestlers that were just seen on the screen there, before you leave back home with your supplies for when you arrive there. That is all for your punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re enjoying this, aren&#39;t you? Fine. The white one as he&#39;s a dragon is called shinning saber, the blue shark one is called riptide, the beat up brown wolf boy there is known what we call him fang when he&#39;s actually lupine, and the black lion was given the name nightfire by our Mc here. However, they were each banished from the ring here as they&#39;re looking for employment who works in the ring as you are now. If you like to know why they were banished, is because the MC here said that they were getting to popular for the crowd. So, she fired them as they call themselves of the group &quot;The Out Lawers&quot;. True they can still wrestle and stuff, but if you want them to be on your wrestling league fighter starter up back at home that you gatta put each of them to work on A job of some sorts. If you like to know as to just where they are now from that screen appearance, they should be back stage right now. that&#39;s all I can tell as far as they go.&quot; She said that with a flick of your fingers, she was gone as she was now back at your place. Once ther is when she felt something squirming inside her pouch as she shortly found out when a head popped out to find she now had a babby joey living in her pouch, her joey for she was going to be the best mom for her little one.<br />
<br />
Leaving off of the ring arena as you were now Walking around the backstage to meet up with them that you felt confident on meeting up with them for the first time. One of the other wrestlers from the MC&#39;s staff wanted to speak with you as you wonder who this anthro wrestler was, let alonewhat he wanted to talk to you about. However, the first one you decided on talking to was...<br />
<br />
(Well, this is it. the end of the greatest wrestling league match off challenge is here. However, it may start up again as you now decided to meet up with the new wrestlers. Do you talk with one of them, two at a time, three of them for a group meeting, or all four of them at once? You also wondered if the MC had anything to do with this for if not, what will she do now? Again, thank you and happy reading to this point of the tale.)</p>
