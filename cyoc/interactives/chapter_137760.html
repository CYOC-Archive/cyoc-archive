<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mr Todd considers who he wants to change next, he sees the two barefoot skateboarders, now covered in dense hair, come to a halt down the street. Their whoops subsided, and Mr Todd could tell that something more was happening.<br />
<br />
“Dave is this trippy or what?” Chris rubbed the black hair that now covered his arms. “I feel high as a kite right now, my whole body’s tingling!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” nodded Chris as he stood and flipped his skateboard up with his elongated toes. “Look man, our feet look more than half the length of our boards!”<br />
<br />
“We’re tripping right? You put something extra in those blunts dude? Haha right bro? Ha!” Chris was getting the giggles, finding it more difficult to concentrate than usual.<br />
<br />
“Nope, not me, haha! I didn’t touch it. This is real man!” Dave reached out and rugged on the thicket of hair on Chris’s chest, the way a guy might tweak another’s nipple. Except Chris’s skin was hardly visible at all under the hair.<br />
<br />
Chris looked momentarily worried as Dave told him it wasn’t drugs kicking in, but then his mouth twitched into a grin. “Dude I can’t think straight! What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
Mr Todd leaned forward. He wasn’t controlling the power over the two skateboarders. Whatever was happening was developing on its own.<br />
<br />
Both guys seemed to be getting the giggles. They were laughing as they looked at each other and the dramatic changes that had taken place so far. Chris was wearing nothing but his shorts, and all the skin save his face and the palms of his hands had been obscured by hair. Dave was not quite as fully furred, and was lighter brown and still had the remnants of his shirt hanging from his shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Dude, is that you? You’re starting to reek like BO!” Chris’s laughs were interrupted for a moment as he wrinkled his nose. Dave raised his hairy arms instinctively, revealing even denser fur blooming from his armpits. “Fuck dude yeah you’re right. Haha, but who cares? It’s not like we blend in anyway!”<br />
<br />
Chris suddenly fealt sweat break out over his entire body, like his pores all opened simultaneously. Within a few seconds his entire body felt greasier, and he caught a whiff of his own significant BO. So did Dave.<br />
<br />
“Aw dude now you smell too.” Dave covered his nose laughing, but then realized he was smelling more than his buddy’s BO. He took his hands away and sniffed again. Somehow, his mind translated the stench of his friend into new signals. He could tell Chris was healthy, that he had eaten eggs and sausage for breakfast that morning before they had smoked together and ridden out on their boards, and that he was starting to get horny.<br />
<br />
Dave watched as his quizzical expression slowly became mirrored in Chris’s face. Their olfactory senses were exploding, flooding their minds with animal knowledge.<br />
<br />
“Dude... it’s like you smell good, haha” Dave laughed at himself. Then Chris pointed at Dave’s face. “Dave your nose!”<br />
<br />
Dave felt a wave of new smells hit him from the street around him, the grass and the neighbors trash cans and the flowers and some dog shit all the way up the block. He felt the bridge of his nose tingling, and when he reached up found that it had flattened out, pushing back into his face. He had always had an aquiline noss, but that was rapidly disappearing. The base of his nose bulged, nostrils flaring and then widening permanently. He felt this all happen under his fingers, and when he took his hand away Chris gasped at his altered face. “Dude you look like-“<br />
<br />
Chris cut himself off as he reached up to touch his own nose. Now Dave watched as Chris’s face shifted too, his nose flattening and broadening. Dave laughed at Chris’s confused expression, grinning at his friend. He was finding it hard to keep from laughing at everything happening to them. He tried to control himself, but realized it was becoming harder to close his lips over his teeth. He felt his jaw, rubbing the beard that had grown in on his face earlier when the hair had spear over his entire body. His teeth began to ache, and almost felt like they were expanding in his mouth.”<br />
<br />
“Duthe, I theel thunny” Dave tried to speak but found his younger hitting his teeth in a new way, making it difficult to enunciate. Chris pointed. “Dave you’re teeth look huge! What the thuck?” Just as he said it, his own teeth seemed to become more prominent, and he raised his hand to his face again, this time holding it over his mouth. <br />
<br />
Dave stepped closer and grabbed Chris’s hairy arm, pulling it down so he could watch the changes happening. He could feel his own teeth shifting in his head, but couldn’t tell what was happening more specifically. As he watched, Chris grinned at him, revealing large canines and broad front teeth. As he watched, their gleaming whiteness began to dull to ivory. He could feel his own teeth roughening.<br />
<br />
“Thuthe, whath... whathe...” Chris tried to speak but found it incredibly hard to form words with his new dental structure. He could see Dave’s face had squired a far more ape like appearance, jutting upper jaw and receding lower, and a nose that seemed to be flattening even more now. Dave looked back at his friend whose changes were just a few seconds slower than his own. They weren’t just hairy, big-footed humans anymore. They were truly transforming into a new creature. Chris’s toes twitched and Dave found he could smell the aroma of his friend’s feet, sweat from what stank like days of living outdoors without cleaning, and a musk rising from Chris’s shorts.<br />
<br />
Mr Todd looked on as these changes happened, wondering what would happen next to these rapidly degenerating boys.</p>
