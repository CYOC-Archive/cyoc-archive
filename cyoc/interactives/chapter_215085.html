<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to my other friend, Krentol, for writing this chapter</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finn looked down at his crystal ball, watching the new riding lizard as its body laid rigidly on a pile of straw in its newfound cage.  Adam had written the lizard to be “well trained” and Finn had honestly been curious how that would play out.  Having watching Adam’s first few minutes as a lizard, Finn was certainly impressed.<br />
<br />
For one, Adam seemed to lack the intelligence to resist the lizard’s instincts – all Finn had to do was give it the “in heat” status effect and Adam had immediately presented himself to the other lizards, literally begging to be fucked by each and every one of them.<br />
<br />
Then a simple command from Adam’s new owner was all it took to not only dispel that status effect, but to cause his body to immediately and completely obey what he was told.  Though as much as Adam’s body was obedient, Finn could see that Adam was looking at the other lizards with a look of worry in his eye.  Adam was still in there alright, Finn realized, but with his new backstory and stat line, his body was running on autopilot and he didn’t have the brains to do anything about it.<br />
<br />
“Heh” Finn thought to himself.  He was still thinking of that lizard as Adam, but that wasn’t what it was anymore.  Adam had gotten exactly what he’d wanted, exactly what he’d written on his character sheet. Which meant that not only wasn’t “he” Adam anymore, he also wasn’t a he either.  She was a generic riding lizard, sitting in a cage, waiting for her new owners to decide what to do with her.<br />
<br />
Which raised a question – Finn hadn’t exactly thought of how to get the lizard into the party’s possession.  Maybe he should just drop that barn in front of the party and have them buy it?  Or maybe he should let it live out a bit more of that lizard’s life, just to make sure that it was nice and obedient by the time the party came across it.  Finn did try to warn Adam how long those things could live, after all.<br />
<br />
As Finn thought about how to handle the riding lizard’s fate, he was briefly distracted by a knocking from upstairs.  <br />
<br />
“Christ,” he thought, “everyone’s already here, don’t tell me someone told Jim about this.”<br />
<br />
But as Finn stood to go upstairs, he was confronted with a sudden problem, the basement door.  Finn hadn’t noticed it before, but when he’d changed himself into a dragon, the basement seemed to have changed with him.  It was a bit bigger, and the ceiling was a lot higher than it had been – something the Chronivac had no doubt done to help accommodate his new, draconic size.  But one thing that hadn’t changed was the stairs leading out of the basement, or the basement door.<br />
<br />
Looking at the door, Finn figured he could still fit through it if he was walking on all fours and held his wings up against his body.  But it wasn’t something that would be comfortable for the dragon to do and while Finn the fox might not have minded a bit of discomfort, Finn the dragon wouldn’t tolerate it.  <br />
<br />
Which, Finn realized, meant something else – however the Chronivac had changed reality, it must have made it so that he didn’t leave this basement very much.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see if I can fix that,” Finn thought as he opened up the Chronivac, “I wonder if this thing can change objects as well as people.”<br />
<br />
Finn cycled through the various menus in his phone, before finding an option entitled ‘search’.  He typed “Finn’s house” into it and, sure enough, a stat page for his house came up.  A few taps later, and he’d managed to change it from a normal house, to “Finn’s lair”.  He checked the reality change option, made sure his own awareness was checked, then hit go.<br />
<br />
At first nothing seemed to happen, but when Finn glanced up towards the basement door, he saw the rickety wooden stairs leading up to it had changed into a solid hunk of rock with dragon sized stepped carved into it.  As for the door itself, it was still more or less the same, but looked to be about the same size as Finn – something he could easily walk through either upright or on all fours, with plenty of room to spare for his wings.<br />
<br />
Finn started to think back to the knocking from upstairs, when he felt his stomach begin to rumble.  Of course, it was almost dinner time.  Mike and Dave had probably ordered pizza, and the knock was from the delivery guy.  With his stomach rumbling, Finn plodded up the stone steps and walked out into what had previously been his family room, fully expecting to see a muscular tiger and plump ram eating pizza.<br />
<br />
But the first sign that something was off came as Finn opened the door, and couldn’t help but notice the plethora of smells that assaulted his much more sensitive nose.  The first of which was, of course, the smell of pizza.  That he expected.  What he didn’t expect was the other smell – kobolds.<br />
<br />
There wasn’t any scent of a tiger or a ram.  Instead, Finn could smell three distinct kobolds.  Two male, one female, all healthy and about 70 years old – which, the scent told him, was of young for a kobold but well into breeding age.  In fact, the pleasant musky smell attached to each of their scents told Finn that they were all aroused and ready for sex, should he wish to use them for that.<br />
<br />
Finn couldn’t help but think about just how much information his draconic nose told him about his surroundings.  He could smell how energetic the kobolds were, how long it had been since they’d had sex – and with who.  Their scent told them that the two males had spent the day cleaning, while the female had just baked a pizza from scratch.  It didn’t seem like there was anything he couldn’t tell about them from smell alone.  Except, of course, what they looked like.<br />
<br />
Glancing around the former family room, Finn saw that it had transformed from what would be found in a typical suburban home into a much larger room, with a cavernous ceiling supported by marble columns and stone walls.  Even the furniture in the room had been transformed from the dull, human sized tables and chairs to an ornate, dragon sized sitting cushion, next to which sat a much smaller table and chairs.  Clearly, one was meant for Finn, while the other was for the kobolds.<br />
<br />
Speaking of, there was a small green kobold – no higher than Finn’s kneecaps, holding a tray of pizza that was comically oversized for it, while two similarly small red kobolds were furiously fluffing his sitting cushion.<br />
<br />
“Master Finn!” the green kobold shouted in a raspy voice, “Callum come from kitchen outside.  Make pepperzoni pizza for Master!”<br />
<br />
Before Finn had a chance to respond, one of the red scaled kobolds exclaimed, “is Master favorite yes?  Kobolds fluff Master cushion so he be comfortable when eat pizza!”<br />
<br />
Finn paused to take in the situation.  Obviously, when he had told the Chronivac to change his house into his lair, it had changed everything in the house as well.  That included Mike and Dave, who had been changed into two of these kobolds…<br />
<br />
“Mike?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes Master!” one of the red scaled kobolds shouted, “how can Mike serve?”<br />
<br />
“Dave?” Finn said as he looked to the other red scaled kobold.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the kobold exclaimed, “Yes Master! Tell Dave what needs to do and Dave do it!” <br />
<br />
Which left the green, female kobold.<br />
<br />
“Callum?” Finn asked, looking at her.<br />
<br />
“Yes Master!  Master want pizza?  Is fresh!” she said excitedly as she set it down on the table.<br />
<br />
“No,” Finn said with a bit of frustration in his voice, “I don’t want pizza.  I want to know who you are.”<br />
<br />
“Master?” the green kobold asked inquisitively, “I is Callum.”<br />
<br />
“I mean, who were you before you were a kobold?”<br />
<br />
“Has always been kobold?” Callum said in growing confusion.<br />
<br />
Finn sighed, the reality change had obviously nuked the memories of whoever this was.  Finn opened up the Chronivac and scanned the green kobold.  Unfortunately, the Chronovac didn’t tell Finn anything about Callum that his nose already hadn’t.  But after reading through her basic information, Finn saw the box for awareness was unchecked.  <br />
<br />
Finn pondered the ramifications of checking that box.  Had Callum been a neighbor?  Or perhaps a friend whose name had changed along with her backstory?  Would checking that box bring her old memories back, and how would she react to that?  Well, worst case, he could always uncheck the box again.<br />
<br />
Finn tapped a claw on the screen to check the box, then tapped again to confirm the change.  Nothing seemed to happen, but when Finn looked up the effect was obvious.  The green kobold that had been standing in the middle of the room was still there, but the look of utter joy that had previously graced her face at the idea of Finn eating her pizza had been replaced with a look of abject terror.<br />
<br />
“What is…” the kobold managed to choke as it looked over its body, “what is happen to Callum?”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==<br />
<br />
Callum woke up in the wrong body, staring at the massive red dragon that was looming just a few feet away from him.<br />
<br />
Callum had started today like he did every day – he got out of bed, took a shower, then drove to work to his job as a human pizza delivery driver.  His day had been uneventful, other than the delivery he had to the house where the anthro ram and tiger lived.  Anthros were unusual, so they stood out on their own, but this house was a regular customer and a good tipper.<br />
<br />
He’d walked up to the front door and knocked.  When the front door opened, he made some brief small talk with the tiger while he handed over the pizza, only to notice the tiger’s fur falling out as the skin underneath rapidly hardened into crimson scales.  But the strangest part about it was the shrinking – it was obvious that the now reptilian looking tiger was rapidly losing height, but for some reason Callum noticed that they were still looking at each other eye to eye.  <br />
<br />
Callum barely had time to realize that meant that he was shrinking along with the tiger, when he was distracted by a popping sensation that came from just above his butt, followed by an intense feeling of pressure as his body began to push out into the back of pants.  Callum looked behind himself, just in time to see his clothes vanish and a thick tail, covered in green scales, push out of his backside.  <br />
<br />
“Is that a lizard tail?” Callum had thought to himself, and then…<br />
<br />
He’d suddenly snapped back to awareness in an unfamiliar room, with an even less familiar dragon standing over him.  The change in surroundings was confusing enough.  Even more so were the new sensations coming from his body.<br />
<br />
He could feel the weight of that thick tail from before hanging off the back of him.  Even more, he could feel the tail itself, which was especially evident given that it seemed to sway back and forth slightly all on its own.<br />
<br />
Then there was the green protrusion occupying the bottom quarter of his vision.  He didn’t need to reach a hand up to know what it was – he could feel the air rushing in through small nostrils that were positioned far more forward than they used to be.  And rather than the thick, blunt tongue he’s used to have, he now found himself controlling a long, sinewy tongue that was probing along the room of a very extended mouth.<br />
<br />
Even still, it was so hard to believe that the green thing extending out of his face actually belonged to him that Callum still raised a hand just to confirm.  And as that hand ran along the length of his head’s new appendage, he instantly confirmed two things: <br />
<br />
The first was what he felt running along palms - that he now had a long, lizard-like muzzle.  And the other was that he could feel running along the top of the scales of his new muzzle – the small, blunt claws that his fingers now ended in.<br />
<br />
Callum quickly looked over his body, though as with his muzzle, all of the new touch information bombarding his brain told him everything he needed to know long before his eyes did.  He was some sort of diminutive lizard creature.  He had thin, wiry limbs, small claws on his hands and feet, a thick tail, and a long muzzle.<br />
<br />
His heart raced as he stood before the dragon.  Sure, this wasn’t the first time he’d seen a dragon – they were in so many movies and television shows that everyone had seen them hundreds of times before.  But seeing them in on a screen was different than seeing one in real life.  They were extremely rare and even more secretive.  Callum had heard rumors that they had magic, but he’d never thought…<br />
<br />
Had he done something to alienate this dragon?  Had it used its magic on him, to turn him into this?  Or worse yet, was it the tiger who had offended the dragon, and he was just collateral damage?  <br />
<br />
Callum stared up at the dragon.  When he had come to, the dragon had been intently staring at something on its phone, but now it was staring directly at him.  Callum didn’t know what to do, he didn’t know what to say.  He just sat there, staring like an idiot, before he felt his mouth open all on its own.<br />
<br />
“What is…” he stammered, “what is happen to Callum?”<br />
<br />
Despite the broken English, he had nonetheless managed to convey the one thought going through his head – complete and utter confusion at the situation that now confronted him.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
“Your name is Callum?” the dragon said as it cocked an eye.<br />
<br />
A wave of what could only be described as obedience washed over Callum.  The dragon had addressed him.  Even more than that, it had talked to him, asked him a question even.  The fear in his heart remained, but it shifted.  Instead of the fear of the unknown, Callum felt himself fearing master’s wrath if he gave an unsatisfactory response.  And there was more still – deep down inside he felt a strange desire welling up.  He wanted to serve this dragon.<br />
<br />
It was so strange, to be terrified of the being in front of him but also… Callum wasn’t sure exactly what this feeling was.  Love perhaps?  No, not quite, it was more like an overwhelming sense of dedication.  Something in his mind was telling him that this dragon was the most important being in the world, that its every need must be catered to immediately.  <br />
<br />
Callum didn’t feel as though he should answer the dragon’s question because of his fear of what the dragon would do to him if he gave a bad answer.  No, he felt compelled to answer the dragon as though doing so was some sort of overwhelming moral imperative.  Like giving food to a starving orphan, doing whatever this dragon wanted felt like the right thing to do, like it would make Callum a good person in the eyes of the dragon.  Like the dragon would reward Callum in the afterlife for his loyal service.<br />
<br />
In the afterlife?  Callum didn’t have time to ponder on the meaning of that before he heard himself say, “Yes master, name is Callum.”<br />
<br />
“Tell me Callum,” the dragon began, “who were you before you turned into that?”<br />
<br />
Callum’s mind was trying to figure out how to respond to the dragon, but his body was already working ahead of him.<br />
<br />
“Callum was deliver pizzas to masters house.  Callum lived at-“<br />
<br />
“I don’t need your life story,” the dragon interrupted as it tapped a clawed toe on the marble floor.<br />
<br />
The dragon leaned its head down to Callum, who couldn’t help but notice that its head was almost the same size as his entire body.  Its nostrils flared open and it took a few deep sniffs near his belly.<br />
<br />
“Callum isn’t a girls name, is it?” the dragon asked.<br />
<br />
“No master, Callum is…” <br />
<br />
No, Callum realized, whatever he may have been, Callum wasn’t a human anymore, so ‘is’ wasn’t the appropriate word.<br />
<br />
“Sorry master,” he continued, “Callum was human male.”<br />
<br />
“Curious,” the dragon said in a drawn out voice, before pressing its head into Callum’s crotch and taking another sniff.<br />
<br />
“I wonder why it made you a female?”  the dragon asked itself.  It backed away from Callum and glanced over at the two red kobolds, then a flash of realization came across its face, “oh don’t tell me that it turned us into one big…”<br />
<br />
The dragon trailed off, but Callum found his mind more engaged than ever.  Had the dragon just said he was a female?<br />
<br />
Callum cautiously lowered a hand to his crotch.  He kept telling himself that lizards had internal genitalia, but as a clawed finger entered his vent, Callum couldn’t help but notice that he could feel two distinct holes going up into his body.<br />
<br />
Then there was a small jolt of pleasure as his claw passed over an internal dimple, and his mind was invaded with images of a thick, scaley cock emerging from the vent between the dragon’s legs.  Callum could see himself dropping to his knees and lifting his tail.  He could feel the dragon grab onto his stomach, lift him up, then position her right in front of that delicious cock before…<br />
<br />
“Ugh, are all of you kobolds that horny?”  the dragon’s voice caused Callum to snap back to reality.  Her finger was still wedged inside of her, soaked in her own fluids.  <br />
<br />
And it wasn’t just her finger, she could feel muscles softly grinding against a dampness that extended deep into her belly.  Those were muscles that existed for two purposes – to milk every last bit of cum out of the dragon’s cock, and to push the resulting eggs out of her body.  They were muscles that a man didn’t have, muscles that didn’t exist when she’d woken up this morning.  But they were muscles that existed now, and they were hers; as was everything else about this new body that Callum found herself trapped in.<br />
<br />
Callum looked up at the dragon, only to be greeted with a look of utter disgust.  And Callum couldn’t blame him.  The dragon was the most important being in existence, and standing in front of it, fingering herself, was Callum, the tiny, insignificant kobold.  It was as shameful for Callum as it should have been insulting to the dragon.<br />
<br />
The dragon sighed, “look, Callum, I’m going to level with you.  I have no idea who you were and I don’t care.  You just happened to walk into this house when I decided to turn it into my lair and it looks like the world kind of decided to make you a part of it.”<br />
<br />
The dragon pointed at the two red kobolds standing a few feet away, “one of those used to be my dad, but it looks like they might both be now.  Its not hard to put two and two together as to why it made you a female kobold, but I wasn’t a huge fan of my old mom and I’m not looking for a new one.”<br />
<br />
“Callum is…” Callum started to say, but the implications of what the dragon had just told her were just too much to comprehend.<br />
<br />
“Sorry bud but I need to find somewhere else for you to go.” <br />
<br />
The brief paused that followed was the most terrifying of Callum’s life, what if the dragon decided to…<br />
<br />
But the dragon didn’t give Callum time to finish the thought, “I’m running a DnD game right now, I have an entire universe I’ve made for my players.  I’m going to put you in there, though I’m afraid I don’t have room for anyone else, so I tell you what…”<br />
<br />
The dragon began tapping at his phone.  “Here, I gave you a backstory that says you’re the child of a powerful noble.  I don’t really have time to do anything more in depth, but the simulation should fill in the blanks for you.”<br />
<br />
Callum couldn’t believe what the dragon was saying.  A DnD game?  His backstory was that he was a powerful noble?  None of it made any sense.  But it didn’t have to make sense, as the effect was immediate.  <br />
<br />
The flesh of Callum’s tail began thinning out, as dense brown fur floofed out of his scales.  Tall, rigid ears grew out of the side of his head, before migrating to the top of it.  He felt something growing out of his vent as a new cock took shape and pushed out.  Then, finally, he began shrinking down as his body became more and more clumsy.<br />
<br />
As the newborn anthro wolf cub shrank down towards the floor, a small basket formed underneath him.  The stone walls of the dragon’s lair began to blur into the wallpapered walls of a fancy, medieval home.<br />
<br />
Soon, Callum found himself in a totally foreign environment.  He couldn’t see much from the inside of his basket, and his body was so clumsy and weak that he couldn’t move himself around to get a better view.  <br />
<br />
Callum could only stare at the wooden ceiling above as a gravely voiced asked, “it’s a boy?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Mayor Rodrigo!” came a female sounding reply.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a large, dark furred wolf head appeared above Callum’s basket, and a big smile came over its face.<br />
<br />
“Good,” the wolf said excitedly, “its always a pleasure to have your firstborn be a suitable heir.”</p>
