<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lance and Lila Knight. A happily married couple for the past nine months; they are soon to be expecting their first cub. With Lila roughly three months pregnant; neither parent to be knows the gender of their first born, but that doesn’t matter for the moment. Lila Knight, a were tigress was happily purring in the loving embrace as her were-panther mate was enveloping her in. Holding true to the promise made yesterday; Lance was acting as a blanket for his wife, as she went to bed completely naked. Enjoying the soft black fur of her mate; Lila could not shift into her fursona for the health and safety of the fetus. Yet if she was furry like her mate, you would have seen an orange and black furred were-tigress sleeping next to a black furred were-panther.<br />
<br />
Slowly stirring awake; not because the sun has risen or the fact that they are sleeping in, Lila had to get up because she needed to pee. Disentangling from her husband’s embrace; Lila makes a mad dash to the nearby washroom. Unconcerned that she is naked; Lila and Lance are the only people in the house. Lance wakes up shortly after to hear his wife relieving herself.<br />
“Come back to bed,” Lance answering groggily; “I want to snuggle some more.”<br />
“Check the time Lance,” Lila flushing the toilet and walking back to the room; “Rick will be over in an hour to help and you need to get the beer we picked up last night and put it into the fridge.”<br />
“But I’m enjoying checking you out instead,” Lance grinning; staring at his wife’s naked body and enjoying her curves immensely.<br />
“Suit yourself,” Lila quickly getting dressed; “but you need to defur and get dressed soon. Your brother is also coming over as well remember?”<br />
<br />
Lance sighs as he remembers the dinner conversation he had with Benton last night. His brother agreeing to come over and help with putting together the crib that was delivered yesterday was a surprise for everyone at the table. Getting out of bed; Lance quickly puts on a pair of pants and little else as he defurs. His chiseled six pack abs and toned chest on display as he runs out of the house to collect the case of domestic beer; he rushes back in to see Lila already in the kitchen making breakfast.<br />
<br />

<br />
Benton in typical fashion was the first to get up in the morning; immensely enjoying last night’s bedroom activity with Amanda, Benton was feeling well rested despite the half dozen issues plaguing him. Currently in his study; Benton was in the process of nipping one issue in the bud when his wife entered. A black furred were-panther like him, Amanda was holding two cups of coffee; as she placed his mug on the desk he could tell it was decafe by the smell alone.<br />
“You know I don’t like decafe Amanda,” Benton looking back at his computer finishing an email and hitting send; “so why give me a cup of the vile liquid?”<br />
“Because you’ve been drinking too much of the regular coffee of late,” Amanda pointing out; “plus you promised to tell me what you and Lance discussed about before dinner last night.”<br />
“Two things,” Benton drinking the bitter brew; “Samantha Twist announced her plan to run for mayor yesterday. It was a pre-emptive move to stifle whatever planned announcement,” Benton continuing; “that Arnold Steward Stevenson is planning at the Labor Day picnic this Monday.”<br />
“And the second thing,” Amanda not understanding what Benton is going on about.”<br />
“Lance helped me figure out who was fucking the build schedule for the new elementary school,” Benton grinning viciously; as he shows Amanda the stock photos of Jack Ashford and Kendra Smythe and the recent photos of Jack Crawford and Kenya Adaeze-Crawford. “The first photos were taken from a society ball you hosted early last year Amanda,” Benton growling; “Jack Ashford is a name that has been coming up recently in regards to the delays being faced in the new school’s construction.”<br />
<br />
“Well your taking this well,” Amanda pursing her lips as she knew of her husband&#39;s hatred of the man she is seeing on the computer; “shouldn’t you be flying off the handle?”<br />
“Why should I have to do that,” Benton grinning like a Cheshire cat; “when the emails I just unleashed will make Jack Crawford do that for me. In a few hours,” Benton getting up; “Jack Crawford and his alias Ashford will be locked out of any future scheming to delay the completion of the school. Plus,” Benton chuckling; “I sent a memo to all board members that Knight Industries will be supporting Samantha Twist’s bid for election.”<br />
“And how will that piss off Jack Crawford,” Amanda asking.<br />
“Easy,” Benton cackling; “Jack’s wife Kenya, will be announcing her plan to run for mayor at the Labor Day picnic, Lance told me that yesterday. He and few other council members overheard Arnold talking to the were-donkey rep about acting as a campaign manager since he is barred from office.”<br />
“Still not getting it husband,” Amanda looking at Benton.<br />
“Kendra Smythe is not only an alias of Kenya,” Benton looking at Amanda; “but it’s also the name Kenya used while working as an escort agent. Jack Crawford married a prostitute,” Benton looking positively giddy; “I can&#39;t wait to see the color drain from that were panther&#39;s face when Ella Alyn confronts the two during the press conference regarding Kenya&#39;s past. Lance plans to use that moment to help add oomph to the damming expose his paper plans to run on Tuesday.”<br />
<br />
It takes a second for Amanda to process what Benton just told her before her eyes light up in complete surprise. Watching Benton leave his study his tail twitching as he happily whistles a ditty whenever he was scheming to crush someone. <br />
“Well at least you’ll be in a good mood when you help your brother today,” Amanda looking on bewildered; “now to talk to those three upstairs after they wake up.”<br />
<br />

<br />
Waking up curled up between two furry bodies; Eric Anderson a white furred were-panther with vivid green eyes; purrs as he lifts his head to see Spencer and Frieda resting their heads on his chest. After last night’s rutting that lasted until the wee hours; Eric was feeling proud. Watching Spencer and Frieda servicing each other before each jumping on his feline rod; Eric quickly fell asleep shortly after, tired but content.<br />
<br />
Now awake, Eric knew as soon as he moved; Spencer and Frieda would also soon wake up. Not wanting to ruin a happy moment as he watches his mates sleep peacefully; Eric tries to move his arms in an effort to hug the two happy girls. His efforts only cause the two to moan and stir.<br />
“And here I thought I could hug you two awake,” Eric chuckling.<br />
“You still can,” Frieda stirring; “Wake up hugs are never a bad thing.”<br />
<br />
Purring as he gives his mates a loving squeeze; eliciting purrs from the both of them before they both open their eyes and slowly sit up.<br />
“Looks like we used Eric as a pillow again,” Spencer yawing; stretching as rubs the sleep from her eyes.<br />
“You don’t see me complaining,” Eric grinning; getting up and quickly climbing out of bed. “Looks like Ralph had a snack,” Eric looking at the terrarium to see the rat snake inside with a noticeable bulge in his belly.<br />
“Well I did drop a mouse in there,” Frieda placing her paws on the hardwood floor; “before we had our fun. I’ll give him another one in a few days,” looking at the sealed buck containing the mice the three caught last night; “these rodents are looking on the small side.”<br />
“Do rat snakes eat eggs,” Spencer asking; “think we could feed it a chicken egg or two?”<br />
“They’d eat a hatchling,” Eric watching the snake sleeping; if they get to a bird’s nest unattended by the parents.”<br />
“I’m not going to experiment,” Frieda speaking; “when this little critter has no issues in eating the rodents we catch for it.”<br />
<br />
After using the bathroom each; Eric, Spencer and Frieda head downstairs for some breakfast. Heading into the kitchen, none bat an eye to see Ethel absent; with Saturday being her’s and her husband’s day off, Frieda was not surprised to see her father trying once again in making breakfast. But what surprised Frieda and her friends was Amanda helping.<br />
“Care for some French Toast for breakfast;” Benton cracking some eggs in a large bowl and mixing them vigorously.<br />
“It’s the only toast your father can make,” Amanda looking at her daughter; “without burning it.”<br />
“As long as it’s not extra crunchy like last time,” Frieda chuckling; watching Benton shake his head as he knows, Frieda was referring to the eggs shells getting mixed into the batter.<br />
<br />
Amanda looking at the three young weres before her; her daughter Frieda an grey furred were-panthress with russet red highlights. Eric Anderson, a white furred were-panther with a small patch of brown fur on his head; and Spencer Lawson, a black furred werewolf/panther/feline hybrid.<br />
“While Benton makes a mess preparing breakfast,” Amanda speaking; “I would like to discuss something that came up yesterday after dinner. A matter that your father Frieda,” Amanda watching Benton soak bread into the egg batter; “was only just informed of.”<br />
“We’re not in any trouble are we,” Frieda looking at her mother.<br />
“No,” Amanda answering; “what I want to discuss is the fact that you three had a were-wedding* and possibly don’t even realize it.”<br />
<br />
<br />
* A were-wedding is when a couple expresses their love with a token gift, a few words or both; similar to a marriage proposal. The blessed moment culminating in a wild passionate, expression of love; they are considered married in the eyes of nature, but still have yet to formally tie the knot as far as the rest of the world is concerned.</p>
