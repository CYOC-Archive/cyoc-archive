<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of course, Ty and Ki were tempted to discover what their fathers would look like following a wish that the original father would have two heads. By the time the boys--or rather boy, if whoever&#39;s reading this counts bodies instead of heads--reached the door of their father&#39;s study, they began to wonder if anything else might have been changed due to their wish. First, they leaned against the door to get an idea of what the room would be like. Ty placed his head against the door to listen through the wood, while Ki bent his neck to look through the keyhole. Obviously, neither brother was able to get a basic understanding of the room they waited beyond the door, so they decided to just go in and see for themselves.<br />
<br />
Ky reached his right--and only--hand for the doorknob, and slowly began to turn it. Once they heard the latch click, Ky pushed slowly pushed the door open by the handle, while Ty used his left--and only--arm to push the door open against the wood. As the door slowly opened, Ty and Ki poked their heads in to see what their four eyes could see. The study seemed the same as Ty had known it before he started his wishing: a large desk with a swivel chair, a grand fireplace, two large bookcases, a sofa and three chairs, an easy chair with a matching footstool, a tall clock, an ornate mirror, a chandelier, a Persian rug, thick red curtains, some tables, a small TV set, a desk lamp, and a telephone. Everything seemed to be the same, but the two noticed some unusual things immediately.<br />
<br />
The seat furniture, for example, was noticeably wider, wide enough for the chairs to be viewed as benches by someone who had no conjoined twin. The mirror was also wider, as if a group of people could look in the mirror simultaneously instead of one or two. There was a change in the desk and the objects on it: not only was the desk wider--as if two people could sit in the wider swivel chair behind it at once--there were two of each item on the desk. On the desk were two lamps, two TV sets, two computers, two phones, two staplers, two tape dispensers, two paperweights, two pencil holders, two pencil sharpeners, two coffees, and two donuts. Two coffees and donuts might seem unusual for one person to have alone, but Ty and Ki both still remembered the wish they had recently made and its applications: two heads, and therefore two snacks and two drinks.<br />
<br />
Then the boys noticed something else: Mark was not in the study. However, it did not take long for either to notice and remember the lavatory at the far side of the room near the windows. They figured that Mark must be inside it, along with his new conjoined twin. Not knowing how long the two dads would be in there, Ty and Ki decided to sit and wait for them to come out. The boys began to walk over to one of the chairs, and sat down in the one facing towards the now wider lavatory door; it was a comfortable chair, since both the chair&#39;s seat and back--along with Ty and Ki&#39;s body--were twice as wide as a normal, one-headed person&#39;s body would be. As the boys waited to see their dads, they studied the rooms and themselves a bit more. For example, there were two of everything on the desk, but they were arranged so that only one of each object on either side of the desk; this was obviously so that each head and conjoined twin who sat there would be able to function with their own supplies if the other twin&#39;s supplies were already in use. Also, the boys figured that the wider seats were in case other conjoined twins--such as the other members of the family, who have conjoined twins--came in and took a seat. As for studying themselves, they noticed that their legs were wider as well, as if each of their legs was two regular human legs inside the same pants leg; the same could be said for the boys&#39; feet, socks, and shoes.<br />
<br />
The sound of a turning doorknob broke Ty and Ki&#39;s concentration. As they lifted their eyes--and heads--the two watched as the lavatory door opened. Suddenly, a large body began to come into the room, with two normal arms and two wide legs walked into the room. On top of the wide shoulders were a pair of heads, exactly identical, reading the newspaper in the body&#39;s hands. Ty knew that one head had to be that of his original one-headed father Mark, but he was trying to figure out who the other head was. Ty and Ki were still new to the conjoined twin experience, but fortunately it did not take them long to recognize the fathers that were walking to the desk without noticing their sons. The head on the body&#39;s left-hand side was Mark, and the head on the body&#39;s right-hand side was Clark--Mark&#39;s conjoined twin.<br />
<br />
Ty and Ki sat quietly in their wide chair, waiting to see how long it would take for their dads to notice them. Believe it or not, neither Mark nor Clark had any idea that one of their two two-headed boys was present in the room. The two men simply sat their single, two-cheeked butt down in the wide swivel chair, and got back to the work they were doing. As Mark glued his eyes to his TV, Clark got some papers out and began to write one them with one of his pens. Both hands were helping with the writing, with Clark&#39;s hand holding the pen and Mark&#39;s holding the paper--Mark was watching his TV, but he and Clark were extremely skilled at such multitasking (multitasking that Ty and Ki hoped to master soon enough).<br />
<br />
After a while, Clark stopped writing and looked off towards the wall to think. While he was doing so, Clark noticed the open door to the hall, followed by Ty and Ki sitting on one of the chairs. Clark suddenly realized that the boys must have come in a few minutes ago, and immediately alerted Mark of their presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, boys!&quot; Mark said. As Mark smiled at their presence, Ty was a bit surprised to see Mark happy to see him for once. Then Ty remembered how June was glad to see him: she had never been happy to see Ty before he made his wish, so the same thing must going on with Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...dads,&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re glad you two are here,&quot; Clark said. &quot;There&#39;s something we wanted to talk to you about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; asked Ki.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you two know,&quot; Mark said, &quot;it&#39;s hard to find clothes for people like us, those with more than one head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty and Ki didn&#39;t know what Mark was talking about at first, but their memories soon told them. In every memory, someone in the family was trying to fit multiple heads into a large shirt with only one neck hole. The two boys then remembered that when they wished for Dustin and June to have conjoined siblings, they were wearing the same clothes before and after the wishes; the only fashion change was that their shirts had gotten large enough to hold two people at once, and that the single neck hole on each had only been stretched so each head and neck was coming through that hole. In fact, both Ty and Ki just realized that their body and that of their dads each had the same kind of shirt: large enough for two people at once, and a neck hole stretched between two heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so?&quot; Ty answered as though he and Ki had known that for years.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you also know how most people always notice and look at everyone in this house as if we are freaks,&quot; said Clark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; answered a curious and confused Ki. Clearly, the wishes had changed everyone in town into believing that everyone in the family was a conjoined twin; of course, the wish only made the family conjoined twins, and not anyone else in town.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Mark frowned, &quot;some of them have been asking that none of us be conjoined to anyone anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; asked a surprised Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t mean that they want us be...?&quot; asked Ki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Clark said, &quot;and that&#39;s why we wanted to talk to you two about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was hard enough on us to say this to your brothers, but now that you&#39;re both fifteen, we have to say this to you,&quot; Mark said, &quot;and we don&#39;t you two to make it difficult for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Ki asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two were born into a family that is special in the most unique and amazing way,&quot; Clark said, &quot;and we believe that our neighbors and townspeople are simply jealous of us for this reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But just because they feel upset about us doesn&#39;t mean that you two should be.&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No matter what anyone does or says, you do not need to feel bad about being two-headed or conjoined.&quot; Clark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two are special and great the way you are, and don&#39;t let anybody tell you otherwise.&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; answered both Ty and Ki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.&quot; said Clark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for understanding.&quot; Mark smiled.<br />
<br />
As Clark and Mark went back to their work, Ty and Ki just stayed seated in their wide chair, thinking about what their dads had just told them: &quot;a family that is special&quot;, &quot; don&#39;t be upset about being conjoined&quot;, and &quot;you two are special and great the way you are&quot;. Indeed, all of these were true: their family was special, they did not have to be upset, and they were special--since they were conjoined twins and had a unique power.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lunch is ready!&quot; called June.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, boys,&quot; Mark said. With that, he and Clark lifted their body and began walking towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s have some dinner with our special family.&quot; Clark said.<br />
<br />
As Ty and Ky got up from their chair, they kept thinking about their power and their conjoined family. It was interesting to think that every member of the family was a conjoined twin. As they walked towards the stairs, they stopped when they say the front door open. It was Dustin and Justin with their dyed hair. When they saw Mark and Clark, the boys were a bit surprised--perhaps the memory-altering hadn&#39;t happened to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you&#39;re home, boys,&quot; greeted Clark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lunch is ready.&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
As the dads left for the dining room, Dustin and Justin looked up to see Ty and Ki coming down the stairs. They were also surprised to see Ty with two heads as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you give yourself and Dad conjoined twins?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I wished that everyone in the family would have a conjoined twin,&quot; answered Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... so Mom has two heads, too?&quot; asked Justin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, her parents separated them at birth,&quot; Ki explained, &quot;and Ty wished that it had never happened, and now she has six arms, six breasts, and three heads.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, the extra heads I could live with,&quot; Dustin said, &quot;but I&#39;d at least like the rest of her body to be like anyone else&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, too.&quot; Justin agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; said Ty and Ki. &quot;Just a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty and Ki then made a new wish: that June had been born with conjoined siblings, but that there only extra heads and nothing else extra. Once the wish was made, they--along with Dustin and Justin--peeked into the dining room. Sure enough, June and her siblings were still conjoined, but the four extra breasts and the four extra arms had disappeared. All that the body had was two legs, two arms, two breasts, and three heads. Mark and Clark were sitting down nearby, but clearly they and the three sisters noticed the change: their memories had been altered to believe that the three sisters had always been like this.<br />
<br />
While Dustin and Justin were relieved that their mother now only had extra heads, they along with Ty and Ki took notice of the changes to the room and the furniture. They had clearly been changed when Ty made his first wish for conjoined family members, but none of the four boys had seen the changes to this room yet. The table was noticeably longer, as though twice as many people could sit there. Every chair was no taller than it had been, but they had been widened just like the study furniture--each seat was wide enough for two people, or at least a body that was as wide as two people. There was one chair at the end that was slightly wider, as though it could take three people--or a body as wide as three people--which was clearly meant for June, May, and April. There were also multiple place settings at each seat, clearly for each head. Mark and Clark, for example, had two laid out before them, and there were three for June and her sisters. The boys were equally intrigued at how they would be eating: two plates for Ty and Ky&#39;s two heads, and two plates for Dustin and Justin&#39;s two heads.<br />
<br />
Indeed, the boys were interested in learning more about their new lives. It was only two hours ago that each family member had only one head: now each of them had gotten conjoined siblings. Ty and Ky were glad, as were Dustin and Justin, that they would be able to know this experience firsthand. The four--or two--boys were excited by what they could do with two heads on one body each, and more importantly, what they would discover about their family and friends now.</p>
