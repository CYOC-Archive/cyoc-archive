<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay think Tim.&quot; He muttered to himself. &quot;Put it together. There has to be a reason this happened today. So, what&#39;s different about today than yesterday.... oh shit.&quot; He thought, suddenly realizing the one item that seemed to coincide with the role swaps. &quot;The watch!&quot; He realized.<br />
<br />
He clenched his fist, and had an audible sigh of relief. During the confusion he didn&#39;t even realize he had been holding onto it, and luckily kept doing so. He quickly wrapped it around his wrist and looked it over. It seemed like a normal watch, but the large button on the side was definitely what he pressed exactly before he swapped roles with Rex.<br />
<br />
He glanced up again and saw Jennifer happily crawling down the street. Her ass giggled as she walked, and only stopped to start sniffing a fire hydrant. Tim blushed, getting secondhand embarrassment for her. Not just for her, but for himself wearing freaking women&#39;s yoga pants.<br />
&quot;Geez, thank God you think you&#39;re Rex... I would NEVER here the end of this.&quot; He mumbled under his breath.<br />
<br />
Jennifer finished sniffing, Lifted her leg, and started to pee on the hydrant. Despite being obviously still female, the pee somehow traveled and behaved as if a male dog was doing the deed. She then began to walk and Tim found himself being lurched forward alongside her.<br />
&quot;Damn, usually I can hold Rex back a bit, and I can definitely out bench Jennifer.&quot; He thought. &quot;I wonder if this thing changes some of that stuff?&quot; He wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Dammit focus Tim!&quot; He angrily thought, slapping his forehead. &quot;Your wife has the role of a freaking dog and you&#39;re thinking about how much you can lift!&quot; <br />
<br />
As he walked along, he began to stop paying attention to his surroundings. He stared deeply at the watch. It was currently set to 12 o&#39;clock, which is what he had turned it to before. Given this, he hoped everything would be fine if he used it. Still, doing so worried him. If Jennifer hadn&#39;t accidentally used the watch, he could have easily been the one to be trapped in the life of a dog after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while I&#39;m here dressed as a woman walking my naked wife, a freaking DOG is taking the most important interview of my life!&quot; He remembered angrily, glaring at the watch.<br />
<br />
Of course he wanted to fix his wife, but frankly, as long as he had the watch he could turn them back right? Jennifer wouldn&#39;t remember this, but he would. <br />
&quot;Sorry Jen, but I promise I&#39;ll fix you the second the interview is done. I&#39;m not gonna have Rex mess this up for us.&quot; He whispered while he patted Jennifer&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Jennifer seemed not to care as she continued to strut down the sidewalk. Tim convinced himself this was right, as he couldn&#39;t stop thinking about a dog in a suit trying to speak with his boss. He couldn&#39;t let it happen, so he closed his eyes, held down the watches side button, and felt his clothing slightly shift.<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes and to his relief it had seemed to work. Tim was definitely in his bosses office. The relief, however, did not last. His heart sank, as sitting in front of him was his own dog Rex. Rex was sitting up straight as a person would, and wore the same suit that he had been wearing earlier, only now it was fitted perfectly for a dog.<br />
<br />
Tim looked down to see his new outfit. He was wearing something at least a bit less humiliating than his wife&#39;s outfit. It was clearly a feminine pantsuit, but was deep black. He felt the clasp of a bra around his nipples, and the awkward strain of panties around his dick, but otherwise it would at least make him seem normal from a distance.<br />
<br />
Up close however Tim could feel his brown hair was cascading in conditioned waves down his shoulders, he could taste the bright red lipstick, and now realized that he was unfortunately wearing a pair of high heels that were comically big to fit his large masculine feet. He stifled a groan, realizing that in freaking out about his boss he accidentally swapped life roles with his boss.<br />
&quot;Great, that means Irene now thinks she&#39;s Jennifer while the real Jennifer get&#39;s treated like a dog.&quot; He thought with a sneer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, excuse me? Mrs. Rameryiez? Is everything alright?&quot; A strange voice arose from in front of him. <br />
<br />
Tim focused back to earth, realizing that he just heard his dog... speak, literally speak. It sounded like someone doing a bad scooby doo impression except without any kind of lisp. Tim&#39;s eyes shot wide, realizing that their situation could be a blessing in disguise. TIM was Irene Rameryiez now, at least as far as anyone else was concerned.<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s quite alright... Mr. Johnson.&quot; Tim replied with a warm smile. &quot;Anyway, where were we now?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My position m&#39;am.&quot; Rex replied, clearly nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit, I thought I was prepared, but if Rex really thinks he&#39;s me then I seem pretty nervous about this. No WAY Irene would give me the job.... but I&#39;m Irene right now.&quot; Tim thought with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what Johnson, I like you! How would you feel about a promotion?&quot; Tim asked with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-are you serious? Just like that?&quot; Rex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;ve been watching you for a while. You deserve one... Tim.&quot; Tim said, trying not to snicker. This watch was turning into a real godsend after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much Mrs. Rameryiez.&quot; Rex happily thanked Tim, which almost caused Tim to burst out laughing since his tail began to wag.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-my pleasure.&quot; Tim responded, stifling a laugh.<br />
<br />
Tim waved goodbye as Rex walked out of the room, his tail wagging incredibly. Tim wondered why he did so, but figured since dogs couldn&#39;t exactly smile the same way as people, that Rex was allowed to keep his tail the way it was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now what?&quot; He mumbled, glancing at the watch before he placed it on Irene&#39;s... or rather, his desk.<br />
<br />
Tim spun the comfy chair around and started looking through the photos Irene kept behind her on a small desk. There was one where Tim was dressed in a goofy white gown, kissing a strong looking Hispanic man in a suit. He sneered slightly, but also chuckled at the idea of such a wedding. Irene herself was half hispanic, so Tim wondered how funny it would look if his white looking ass interacted with Irene&#39;s family.<br />
<br />
Another photo was one in which Tim was wearing a tight red dress, holding a baby girl in a pink outfit with curly dark hair. Tim didn&#39;t want to even think of how that baby was born in this reality. Next to Tim and the baby was Irene&#39;s husband Raoul. <br />
&quot;Wait, how do I know his name?&quot; Tim suddenly thought. &quot;Oh my god do I have her memories?&quot; He wondered.<br />
<br />
Tim tried his best to think of any memories that were not his own, but nothing unique came up. He could only think of his own past, yet, he knew Irene&#39;s husband&#39;s name? He looked over at the computer sitting on the side of Irene&#39;s desk and had an idea. He quickly turned it on and was confronted with the password screen. Despite never even touching her computer before, Tim instantly knew the password was &quot;Isabellamiflo&quot; named after Irene&#39;s daughter Isabella... which Tim now also knew about.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s it... I DON&#39;T have her memories, but I do automatically know everything that I need to know in order to pass as her.&quot; He thought. Soon his eyes reproached the computer screen, his curiosity bubbling over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s my computer after all.&quot; He mumbled. &quot;I am Irene... so this isn&#39;t an invasion of privacy, just me doing what I do.&quot; Tim justified poorly as his intrigue spiked upon entering the main screen.<br />
<br />
He spent the next few minutes browsing around. Most of the information was standard policy stuff, like sick day info, scheduled meetings, organization and stuff like that. Everything else, to Tim&#39;s disappointment, was just family photos and other personal stuff. He leaned back on the chair and sighed, starting to feel guilty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim you asshole. What&#39;d you think you&#39;d find? Some company conspiracy or some dirty details on some of those annoying chumps in human resources?&quot; He sighed. &quot;I should change back.&quot; He muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Rameryiez?&quot; A squeaky voice arose as the door to Irene&#39;s office opened.<br />
<br />
Tim looked up to see Mrs. Rameryiez&#39;s assistant Nancy Wu. Nancy was only 22, and was just an assistant to Irene in the sense that she would schedule things, bring her coffee, and talk to people for her when she didn&#39;t feel like it. Most of the office didn&#39;t talk to her casually much, however thanks to the age difference. Still she was  generally well liked and was a sweet kid.<br />
<br />
She had short, black hair that went straight to her ears, wore big glasses, and always wore a cute blouse skirt combo that really helped show off her ass. Tim tried not to look, but he was only human after all. She walked up to the desk and gave a weak smile.<br />
&quot;Sorry to interrupt Ma&#39;m but I needed your signature on some things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Uh, sure... sure Nancy.&quot; Tim responded, realizing that he may as well do some work for Irene after what he pulled.<br />
<br />
While he signed stuff, surprisingly doing Irene&#39;s signature perfectly, he noticed that Nancy had become uncomfortable. As Tim got to the last few pages, he realized why she probably felt that way. Irene usually called Nancy &quot;Ms. Wu&quot; and made it a point to work her hard. From what Tim heard through the grape vine, it was because Irene sees a bit of herself in Nancy, and wants to toughen her up for the world. Nancy was kind of a sweet, bleeding heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Ms. Wu?&quot; Tim asked, trying to do his best Mrs. Rameryiez. Luckily he had practiced a lot while drunk at company parties.<br />
<br />
&quot;U-uh, yes Ma&#39;m?&quot; She asked meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;re you doing right now?&quot; He asked sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m taking these down to Brian, then I have to do some paperwork...&quot; She began to explain.<br />
<br />
As she rattled off a long list of rather boring activities, Tim hatched an idea. He had been wondering how exactly all the non-Irene like things he had done in her role would be taken once he left her life role. Would Rameryiez flip and fire Tim or would she think that she had done that herself? Whatever the case, it seemed like a good a time as ever to test it out, and also give Tim the opportunity of messing with some annoying coworkers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, forget all that!&quot; Tim interrupted her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; She asked worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a new special assignment for you.&quot; Tim began. &quot;I need you to go around the office and talk to people. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you serious?&quot; Nancy asked confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, I need eyes and ears out there. I can&#39;t well know if my team is efficient if I&#39;m cooped up in here. Besides I think you need a little break... but uh don&#39;t push it!&quot; He added, making sure he still sounded like Irene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Ma&#39;m.&quot; Nancy replied, confused but a little excited.<br />
<br />
Nancy began to shuffle out, not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth. As Tim sat down, just before Nancy was about to leave the office, he wrapped the watch back around his wrist. He concentrated on Nancy and himself, hit the side button, and once more found himself instantly standing once more, his hand not he doorknob.<br />
<br />
He turned back and smiled. Sitting in Irene&#39;s big chair was little Nancy Wu. Her short black hair was now wavy, voluptuous, and past her shoulders. Her makeup was more defined, making her look a little older, and Irene&#39;s pantsuit altered to fit Nancy&#39;s tiny frame and large butt. She looked up and gave Tim a raised eyebrow.<br />
&quot;Yes Ms. Wu?&quot; Nancy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I just wanted to make sure you really wanted me to do that and this isn&#39;t a test or something.&quot; Tim made up on the fly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you. Talk to people, I want to make sure this business is a well oiled machine. Of course, if you want to do your normal tasks...&quot; She began.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No that&#39;s fine.&quot; Tim smiled before walking out of the office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that explains that.&quot; He thought. &quot;Anything I do in other people&#39;s lives, they&#39;ll think they did it and rationalize it anyway they can... which means my new job is in the bag!&quot; He thought happily. After a moment of joy he composed himself and began to walk. &quot;Phew, thank god Nancy wears flats. I was NOT looking forward to walking much in heels.&quot; He thought.<br />
<br />
Tim made his way down the hall, quickly noting the cosmetic differences. For one thing, he now wore glasses. After taking it off, he soon confirmed that he was now blind as a bat for anything that was too far away. He put them back on and shrugged, guessing he&#39;d have to deal with it for the moment. <br />
<br />
He liked the change in shoe wear and the shorter hair, but he could do without the skirt. Every slight breeze made him feel a little cold. &quot;No wonder the women seem to always complain about that at work. I guess I&#39;ll have some apologies to give later.&quot; He thought while he fixed his skirt. He also felt an additional item in the panties and against his dick. Tim quickly guessed it was a maxi pad, and he REALLY hoped that Nancy being on her period wouldn&#39;t affect him.<br />
&quot;Okay, first sign of THAT and I&#39;m switching to literally anyone else.&quot; He thought.<br />
<br />
He turned the corner and saw the various doors to the different sections of their floor. His job in Nancy&#39;s role was to technically go to his main area with all the cubicles and talk around, though to be fair he didn&#39;t really hate anyone in there. There were some obnoxious new recruits, but beyond that the only thing in there he&#39;d want to do is fix Rex, along with the rest of his family while he was at it.<br />
<br />
A bit further was the mail room. That room was filled with fat slobs and annoying secretaries, all of which could use some new perspectives on life. Further still was human resources, which was the largest alternate branch and filled with the most potential subjects. Even still, he could go to a different floor and maybe have fun with the completion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Either way, this&#39;ll be my first test on other people swapping without me involved... so I&#39;ll need to be careful.&quot; He thought.</p>
