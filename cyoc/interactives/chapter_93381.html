<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny walked into school and skirted the main hallways. She didn&#39;t want to be seen by her friends. They would worry were she was, but that was alright. The more immediate problem for Jenny was getting to first class without her boyfriend seeing her. They had first class in the same hallway. Jen went the long way and hid behind one of the linebackers walking down the hall. She slipped into her first period English class safely. Thankfully, her seat was at the back.<br />
<br />
Sitting down and getting out what she needed for class, Jenny noticed her newfound testes resting on the seat, between her thighs. She was thankful to have such a fine ass that she wasn&#39;t sitting on her balls. Jen kept her mind on her tongue, though. It seemed to want to flop out just like a dog&#39;s... which it probably was.<br />
<br />
She sat and faked her way through class, seething and thinking of how to get back at that perv Kyle.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
As first class was getting ready to end, Jen made her plan of escape. When the bell rang, she executed it. Walking smartly to the door, she was the first out. Jen immediately bolted for the corner of the hallway! Thankfully, she was only one classroom away and that teacher didn&#39;t stand outside as students left, today. Calming down around the corner, Jenny walked on towards her second class. Being a popular high school girl that the rules obviously did not apply to, Jen snuck a peek at her cell phone - plenty of messages wondering where she was this morning. But Jenny thought it was best not to answer them... what would she say?!<br />
<br />
In second period&#39;s class, she sat towards the middle of the room. Sitting down, she couldn&#39;t help but feel like she was forgetting something...<br />
<br />
Behind her, in the hallway, she heard the skitter of dog&#39;s nails on the floor. Oh, No! Eric the legally blind kid and his service dog Fido were in this class!<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, Fido.&quot; Eric said, unsure why his four-legged friend was acting up, &quot;What is wrong with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny gripped the desk in terror. Maybe if she didn&#39;t look, she wouldn&#39;t technically trip the curse. But Fido was raring to go. The male golden retriever got Eric to his desk, but instead of curling up near the desk went up to Jen and started pulling on her skirt with his teeth. His tail was wagging crazily. Jenny thought she might cry.<br />
<br />
Looking to her left and averting her eyes from the dog as her own manhood began to grow in anticipation, Jen pleaded with the girl next to her, Marcie. &quot;Can&#39;t you see what is happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcie huffed and made eye contact. &quot;Jenny, don&#39;t make this weirder than it has to be. Just fuck the dog and get back here; we have group work today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s jaw dropped, tongue spilling out. Marcie squinted a grimace of disgust and turned back to the teacher writing on the board. Fido got onto the ground and started pawing at Jenny&#39;s shoes, trying to get her to come get plowed.<br />
<br />
Finding nothing else to do, Jennifer let go of the desk and walked to the hallway. Her penis was hard and tenting her panties as she did so.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Once out there, her body took over. She turned around and knelt down, catching and hugging Fido as he bolted out the door. Her penis twitched as they made contact. Jen got down on her hands and knees, reaching up to find his slowly engorging dick. With revulsion in her mind, she pulled it close and lapped at it with her new tongue, tasting the off flavor and skin. Fido pranced his front feet, ready to do more, but Jen still had her cock hanging between her legs.<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s body leaned up and back, her hands stripping off her panties and skirt to her ankles as she got onto her back. Her tail wept side to side between her legs as Fido greedily lapped at her cock, making Jen gasp in physical pleasure! Jenny could feel her hardness shrinking - shrinking down to a clit again. Fido continued lapping at the spot, inflaming Jen&#39;s erotic urges. Her balls, only recently acquired, sucked back into her body. She lied there and tweaked a nipple, joining the ministrations as her womanhood returned and juices immediately flowed. Fido satisfied, he jumped forward and tried to spear Jenny with his dog cock. Jenny had to comply, using both her arms to lift her hips into the air. Her mind was furious that this was happening, but as she grabbed Fido and guided him in, the sensations almost made her fall to the floor. Fido humped harder than he ever had in his life - at least since being neutered.<br />
<br />
The two of them kept at it for a minute, Jen glancing up and seeing people walking by like nothing was happening. She felt the knot pop into her vaginal canal and hot liquid spew in, causing her to orgasm loudly. As she convulsed, she dropped her hips and Fido&#39;s knot - not big enough, popped out again. He licked Jenny&#39;s face a few times and went back in.<br />
<br />
Jenny rolled over to her side, furious at her complicit body. She reached down and pulled her clothes up over her body as best she could. Lying on the floor, she felt dirty and sore.<br />
<br />
Deciding to get up and hurry to the bathroom, Jen barely covered herself, leaving her tail and tongue to the public eye. She itched all over - which scared her quite a lot.</p>
