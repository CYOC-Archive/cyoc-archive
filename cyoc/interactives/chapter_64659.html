<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">**NOTE: This is a story by erotic_wordsmith from Metabods (). It's such a great start, but <br />
doesn't have a sequel so I'm hoping the folks here can continue this tale**<br />
<br />
The best part of what Seth did was that the guys he &quot;possessed&quot; were always fully aware of what Seth was making them do. Most of them raged <br />
and howled and seethed inside, but a few even enjoyed his jaded adventures.<br />
<br />
It made no difference in the end, except to add spice to the game.<br />
<br />
Ever since he was a little boy, Seth knew he was different. Generations in his family were gypsies, occultists, and initiates. His mother had been <br />
clairvoyant, his uncle telekinetic. Every person he grew up with had some unusual psychic talent or skill.<br />
<br />
Seth's was astral travel, the ability to project his spirit out of his body. In a more gentle man, this ability could've made Seth a wanderer and a <br />
dreamer and a psychic adventurer. Since he was a toddler, though, a spirit of bitterness and alienation hung over his hopes like a dark cloud. <br />
Lonely, lost, and gay from the time he came into the world, Seth turned to his psychic talents as an escape.<br />
<br />
It wasn't until he was 18 that he actually put himself into another's body, though.<br />
<br />
It had been an accident, really. Craziness. His 19 year-old cousin Ben had been drunk off his ass, and in a fit that night. Some people are quiet <br />
drunks, others can talk up a room, Cousin Ben had been a truly vicious drunk, and he liked to wrestle, and to hurt.<br />
<br />
When Ben came at him that night, Seth threw his spirit out of his body to avoid getting beat up… and the momentum somehow carried him <br />
right into his cousin Ben.<br />
<br />
Literally.<br />
<br />
Seth remembered staggering to the floor, suddenly wildly intoxicated. He felt bigger, taller, heavier. His hands – which were huge – hit the <br />
wooden floor with a meaty smack. Sweat soaked the dirty wifebeater that clung to his chiseled, hairy pecs. He felt like he was encased in a <br />
clumsy mountain of flesh – muscled, hairy, wet, reeking. In a moment of shock, he saw his own real body lying on the floor in front of him, and <br />
he realized he had somehow /become/ Ben!<br />
<br />
Fighting a momentary urge to throw up, or to pass out from the alcohol, Seth pulled himself from the floor, and tried to sort out his thoughts. <br />
Somewhere in his head, Ben was still there, shocked and weirded out by the whole experience. But Ben felt somehow faded, as if Seth's mind <br />
was the one in control. Seth felt as though he had all the access to Ben's memories, personality, and abilities, but it was /Seth/ who was in <br />
control.<br />
<br />
Seth careened against the walls of the back hallway the switch had happened in, and pulled himself into the downstairs bathroom, where he <br />
flicked on the light, and stared at his new face in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Ben's sweaty, stubbly face stared back at him, in awe and a little horror. Then, with a surge of dark joy, Seth-who-was-now-Ben smiled. Even <br />
drunk and sweaty and dirty, Ben was a hot guy. Hell, he'd played varsity baseball and basketball in high school, and had a college scholarship <br />
until he got busted for marijuana last year. Now a local truck mechanic, Ben was still the picture of a young, cocky, blue collar jock from a <br />
small town. Hard, flat pecs, rippled six pack, broad shoulders. Midnight black hair buzzed in a military cut. Dark brown eyes– self-assured. <br />
Seth ran his hands down his body, pushing through scrubby black hair on his chest and tummy, and sliding under his black mesh shorts and <br />
tightie whities, to grab his new cock.<br />
<br />
A thrill of sexual energy surged into him, and he felt his new hairy new member swell and expand. He eagerly dropped his shorts and <br />
underwear, and stared down at his new equipment.<br />
<br />
Poking out from a nest of hair, a huge, uncut hot dog rose towards the ceiling… fuck, Ben was huge! Hard to say how long, but definitely <br />
inches bigger than Seth's own little pecker. How strange that Ben never got cut, either…. Seth rolled his fingers over his new foreskin, wet with <br />
precum, and shuddered in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Somewhere inside his head, the real Ben protested and growled, fighting. Seth shut him out, and slowly jacked himself, his back leaning into <br />
the towel rack, his bare feet on the cold linoleum floor. The smell of a cheap air freshener plugged into the wall contrasted with the vodka on <br />
his own breath. Seth couldn't help that Ben had handed him his body drunk and tired!<br />
<br />
Seth jacked his hands violently over his now swollen cock, not even bothering to soap up or slow down. Suddenly, he burst, gritting his teeth <br />
and practically yelling out loud…<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit…&quot;<br />
<br />
Cum spurted from Ben's gorgeous cock, spitting onto the sink, the mirror, and the vanity. The whole side bathroom was sprayed sticky, and <br />
Seth slid to the floor, pleasantly spent. It was then that Seth felt himself pull out of Ben, and move back towards his own body.<br />
<br />
But as he made that transition back, Seth already had plans for his cousin Ben for tomorrow night….<br />
<br />
To say nothing of all those beautiful boys on his high school football and hockey team…<br />
<br />
A hundred different flavors over a hundred nights, and they'd be damned if they could do anything about it. And the real fun was only just <br />
beginning!</p>
