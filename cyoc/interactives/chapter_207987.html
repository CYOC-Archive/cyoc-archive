<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jasmine stared at the strange machine that was in her dining she knew somehow how it worked and what it does even though she had no memory of ordering such a machine. Seeing as how it holds stats of every living being Jasmine thought this would be excellent opportunity to check on her baby and her own health for although she has been to plenty of doctors this machine would give a definition answer to all the most likely and probabilities. Luckily her profile was already up the screen for a quick review<br />
Name: Jasmine Owens<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Age: 26<br />
Ethnicity: Nigerian <br />
Height: 5’ 9”<br />
Weight: 167 lbs<br />
Occupation: Veterinarian currently on maturity leave<br />
Relations: Tyrone Owens (husband), Zuri Sani (mother), Abeo Sani (grandfather), <br />
Health: good (status), currently pregnant with a ********* (baby status)<br />
IQ: 113<br />
Jasmine was quick to censor her baby’s gender as she wanted to keep it a surprise amazingly she got just before she could see a letter. She was first a bit disturbed that this machine knew so much about her but considering what this Chronivac was she really shouldn’t be. She then selected her Baby’s status with gender still censored finding all the statistics to be satisfactory with no major health concerns and a due date that was to her approval. With that done Jasmine decided to check her own health to make she could deliver her baby going to her own status. What she found was highly upsetting all her systems were perfect being in excellent health all except for one thing her fertility was extraordinary low that her current child was a miracle in of itself and the probability of another was practically impossible. She and Tyrone had always wanted children and they thought this first child would be the first of many but now knowing this would probably be her only child although she tremendously loves this child she felt dread for she knew she had more love to give than she could give to one child. Jasmine felt great sadness as she knew the reason why had to wait for so long but she soon realized she could actually change that. She soon found her fertility factor which was exponentially low and then increased it to a level slightly above average. Now that was done she also did a few slight changes to ensure her children had a stable future, a pay increase for her husband, a few extra rooms for her house and plenty of maturity leave at her veterinary hospital. With that she was ready for whatever the future may hold as for the Chronivac she placed in the attic for safe keeping she didn’t really need it for anything else but it would prudent to keep safe for now. Now all there was left to do was wait.<br />
<br />
Weeks laters<br />
“AAAAAHHH!!!” Jasmine screamed in pain, she was currently sitting in a hospital bed in a medical gown legs spread, she currently in labor giving birth to her baby. “Your doing so good Jasmine, now push” the doctor said attending the business end of the birth helping the baby along, a nurse standing next to help ready to assist. “I know baby it hurts but I’m right here just hold my hand” Tyrone was right beside his wife wearing a set of scrubs over his suit having come straight from the court house when he learned his wife’s water broke. “Dear God, please, let my baby be alright, Jesus please look after him” Jasmine cried as practically broke her husband’s fingers with one hand their wedding rings touching while with the other she prayed using her grandmother’s cross, finally giving the last push to grant her baby life into the world. As soon she made the last push relief finally came over Jasmine as released her vice like grip on her husband and the cross but was then overcome with joy when she heard a new wondrous sound “Waahh Waahh!”. “Congratulations Mrs. Owens its a healthy baby boy” the doctor then laid a small strange creature on Jasmine’s chest. At that moment her entire world changed this small child laying on her chest now meant more to her than any other person with the only exception being the man standing next to her “Welcome to the world Joseph” Jasmine replied as he explored his new environment and as she tended to her sweet little baby he’d managed to grasp her finger which to other may have been a small reflex but to Jasmine it was a show of love as that was all he could do. Tyrone also absorb all the love that was flowing from becoming a new father but he also worried his wife went through a rough delivery although they were both fine and healthy he never wanted to see his Jasmine  in that much pain ever again so he asked “Are you sure you want more, I’d be totally fine with just one child  after seeing what you have go through”. Tyrone was almost shocked to see the biggest smile on her face when her head turn, tears of joy streaming from her beautiful brown eyes she soon replied with “You must joking that pain is nothing in comparison to what I am feeling right and I can’t wait to make Joseph a big brother” she then leaned in and gave her husband a deep passionate kiss to help show show how grateful she before returning to her baby “You hear that your going to be a big brother but right your all momma’s”<br />
<br />
10 years later<br />
“Joseph time to come down stairs your father and your siblings are all waiting on you and you better be wearing the jacket I got you” Jasmine said sternly. She soon returned to her other children who were patiently waiting for their brother so she decided to do some last minute checks. Morgan her 8 year old daughter was fidgeting in her dress causing a few cresses in the skirt which she easily smooth out while also helping her be more comfortable in it. Jessica her 7 year old was playing with her hair which Jasmine had done all nice but was soon corrected by her mother. Michael her second son and youngest at 5 years old was sleeping in a chair nearby whereupon Jasmine slowly woke him as not to scare him. At that time Joseph finally came down in his Sunday best finally “Joseph I see you have decided to join us, now come on your father is waiting for us in the car” Jasmine replied. As Owens family went to Church the Chronivac that was hidden away in the attic collecting dust until the Owens return home where someone finds it.</p>
