<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Huff growled at several more teens on the way to his car. The students screamed and ran off. He chuckled, tail wagging happily. The huge asshole-err, anthrowolf-got in his car and pulled out his phone. He browsed the app store and downloaded the Chronivac app.<br />
<br />
He tapped his claws against the steering wheel while he waited for the download to finish. It beeped and he pulled up his stats again and smirked. No other subjects in range. It was time to change that. He drove out of the parking lot and down the road. A few blocks down the hill, he turned left at the intersection and spotted Jeff walking hurriedly home. The wolf grinned and licked his chops. First victim sighted. He went to turn the kid into a deer or something and paused.<br />
<br />
No. He knew what might be fun. Grinning toothily, he made a few adjustments to Jeff’s stats and hit enter.<br />
<br />
On the sidewalk outside, Jeff was walking along, completely oblivious to the car rolling up silently behind him. He shivered, feeling a strange tingle course through his body. It felt like his entire body had fallen asleep, though the pins-and-needles feeling went away a few moments later. Jeff slowed his pace, wondering what that had been, but shrugged it off.<br />
<br />
His clothes began to unravel as he resumed walking. First his shirt, the threads disappearing into the wind, then his pants, socks, shoes, and underwear. Soon Jeff was walking along, shivering in the cool fall air. It wasn’t until a particularly cold breeze that he looked down and saw that he was naked.<br />
<br />
Jeff panicked, looking around to see if anyone saw the nude teen. There was a car a few yards back, but it was parked, and it didn’t seem to be occupied. Jeff ran into an alley and took cover behind a dumpster. His skin began to itch and he scratched his chest, too distracted by his nudity and how he was ever going to get out of the alley. <br />
<br />
Wait, he still had his phone! He’d stuffed it in his backpack when Mr. Huff had given it back. Jeff shrugged off the pack and went to unzip it and froze. His hands looked…different. As he watched, they twisted and shifted painlessly. Black pads welled up like painless blisters on his fingertips and palm. His fingernails darkening and extending into black claws. With a crunch and a pop, his hands grew wider and fingers grew longer. The itch intensified and Jeff stared as messy gray-black patterned fur covered his appendage. <br />
<br />
The thick fur spread up arms which swelled pleasantly with muscle. Not large, but enough to make the formerly nerdy Jeff athletic. He stumbled and caught himself on the edge of the dumpster, claws scraping the green paint as his heels lifted off the ground, placing all his weight on the balls of his feet. Thick fur covered them as well, claws jutting from his toes. His feet swelled wider with soft, painless crunches, and Jeff found his sense of balance again.<br />
<br />
By now, it was clear to Jeff that he was being changed into an anthro. Was Mr. Huff behind this? If so, why turn him into a wolf?<br />
<br />
While the teen pondered, the thick fur covered his body from his limbs up. Muscles bulged and swelled-again, not massively so, but just enough to be athletic. A sound at the end of the alley made Jeff’s head jerk up. His ears perked up….and up…and up, all the way to the top of his head, stretching out into points. Thick, gray black fur covered them as they twisted in a triangular shape. Jeff saw Mr. Huff standing at the entrance, muzzle curled into a smirk, and his eyes widened, turning a shining, fierce yellow color.<br />
<br />
His ears flattened back against his head and Jeff growled. He blinked and coughed, wondering how he’d managed the sound, and felt his vocal cords writhe into a new configuration. His heart began to pump more strongly as his muscles swelled, defined pecs and abs lifting just enough out of his fur to make them visible. <br />
<br />
Mr. Huff started walking down the alley towards Jeff. He wanted to run, but a sudden pulling at the base of his spine brought him to a halt. Jeff glanced back just in time to watch a small nub poking from just above his bubbly ass. With a series of pleasurable pops that nearly brought Jeff to his knees, it extended. His erect cock slapped against his belly and stuck there, the skin merging, forming a sheathe. Jeff’s pink cock reddened and lengthened, becoming distinctly canine. <br />
<br />
Fur fluffed his tail as it reached its full length, wagging happily in spite of Jeff’s fears. His nose flattened, turning black and moist. Scents wafted in, the stink of the garbage in the dumpster, the damp smell of the alley, his own arousal…and Mr. Huff’s oddly familiar scent. His face popped and crunched painlessly as his nose and mouth lengthened into a proper snout. Jeff’s tongue flattened and he found himself panting, gums aching as his teeth fell out and were replaced with powerful, sharp teeth.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff reached Jeff as soon as the transformation ended.<br />
<br />
“Looking good, Jeffy-boy.” The large wolf growled.<br />
<br />
Jeff realized he was still sporting a boner and tried to cover himself. <br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t worry about public indecency. Anthros like us don’t need to wear clothes.” Mr. Huff placed a furry arm around Jeff’s back. “Come on, son. Let’s get you home.”<br />
<br />
“Y-you’re giving me a r-ride?” Jeff whined, tail tucking itself between his legs.<br />
<br />
“Not if you keep stuttering and stammering like a fucking retard, I won’t.” Mr. Huff smiled.<br />
<br />
Jeff swallowed and nodded, letting the older wolf guide him to his car. It was, of course, the one he’d seen parked behind him earlier. How long had Mr. Huff been following him? Mr. Huff opened the passenger side door and gestured for Jeff to enter. The young wolf sat down, placing his backpack in the backseat. Mr. Huff got in and they drove off. <br />
<br />
Jeff frowned as Mr. Huff took a turn down a street he didn’t recognize.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Huff, we missed the turn.” Jeff said.<br />
<br />
“Hmm? No, son, we’re going the right way.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, if you say so…” Jeff tried not to let the panic he was feeling make his voice quaver.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff pulled into a single-story home in a nice subdivision next to a forest. He turned off the car and got out. Jeff followed him, confused. When the older wolf entered the house, Jeff stood awkwardly next to the car. He inwardly cursed himself for ever getting in the car. Now he had to walk even further home! His mom was totally going to kill him.<br />
<br />
“Well, what are you standing outside, son? Come on in.” Mr. Huff grinned.<br />
<br />
“Is..my mom coming over?” Jeff cautiously entered the house.<br />
<br />
It smelled of musk. Mr. Huff’s was most prominent, but there was another…very familiar scent in here as well. Jeff’s.<br />
<br />
Jeff wandered into the house, scraping his pawpads on a mat next to the door, as though it were routine. He really had to piss and found himself wandering automatically into the bathroom down the hall. He made sure to lift the seat. Dad got angry if he pissed on the seat and especially if he didn’t clean it up.<br />
<br />
He paused mid-stream, leg lifted over the bowl. Dad? Why did he think of Mr. Huff as his dad? Sure, he’d jerked off to the guy, wishing he could be his daddy. To give him the punishments he deserved when he was naughty….Jeff shook the thought away. He’d sidetracked his own train of thought. Dad always said he was scatter-brained.<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked. There it was again! He shook his head and washed his paws before heading to his bedroom. Football posters hung on the wall. A weightlifting bench-one of those bowmaster things-was in the corner. His old computer was on, porn still playing on it. <br />
<br />
He dropped his backpack off on his bed and walked back into the kitchen. Dad would want him to start on dinner. He’d taught him how to make a mean steak. His father rocked in his armchair, watching a movie. The older wolf watched Jeff go through their daily routines-routines he’d set up-and grinned.<br />
<br />
“Good pup.” Mr. Huff said.<br />
<br />
“What’d you say, dad?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff’s grin widened.<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked, realizing what he’d just said. He looked around the room. Pictures on the mantel above the TV had him as a young pup in his father’s arms. There was a photo of them going hunting and fishing and hiking…he and his dad were really active. It filled Jeff with pride. His cock slipped out of it’s sheathe as he realized he was taking after the older wolf.<br />
<br />
“If you’re going to jerk off, do it in your room, Jeffy-boy.” Mr. Huff grinned. “And after dinner. And homework.”<br />
<br />
“Right, sorry Dad.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t ever apologize, son.” Mr. Huff growled. “Rule number one.”<br />
<br />
“I…” A feeling of unease washed over him. “Something’s wrong…”<br />
<br />
“You don’t say, Jeffy-boy.” Mr. Huff’s tongue lolled out in pleasure as he smelled his son’s distress. “Whatever could you mean?”<br />
<br />
“I…I’m not your son..” Jeff spoke softly, eyes distant.<br />
<br />
He found a spot on the couch next to his Dad. But Mr. Huff wasn’t his Dad, right? There were memories there, of him being a weak human. The wolf side of him hated his life. Who’d want to be some nerdy loser? Yet another part of him was screaming for him to wake up. Jeff blinked and stared in horror at Mr. Huff, tail tucking itself between his legs.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?” Mr. Huff smirked.<br />
<br />
“This is all wrong.” Jeff said more firmly.<br />
<br />
“What’s all wrong, son?” Mr. Huff feigned confusion and holding up his cellphone. “I only changed your last name. Jeff Huff.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not your son! Turn me back!” Jeff demanded, paw swiping for the cellphone.<br />
<br />
“Ah ah ah, no touching! Can’t you do it yourself, Jeffy-boy?” Mr. Huff taunted, keeping the phone just out of Jeff’s reach. “Just use your own phone to change back.”<br />
<br />
“I…” Jeff looked away from the wolf’s yellow-eyed stare.<br />
<br />
“You <I>like</I> this, don’t you?” Mr. Huff grinned toothily, tail wagging faster.<br />
<br />
“No!” Jeff crossed his furry arms.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I think you do. Why’d you want to give me a tail?” Mr. Huff asked. “I was mean to you, a total bully. You could do anything to me, turn me into a woman, or a child, but giving me a tail?”<br />
<br />
“I just…” Jeff licked his lips and looked away.<br />
<br />
“You thought I’d look <I>hotter</I> with a tail, didn’t you?” Mr. Huff grinned. “Got a crush on daddy types, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Just shut up!” Jeff shouted and slid lower into the couch cushions.<br />
<br />
“That’s not how you talk to your old man.” Mr. Huff feigned indignation and pulled up Jeff’s profile again. “Time for some punishment!”<br />
<br />
“Dad-err, Mr. Huff, stop!” Jeff said. “I-I’m sorry!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry? No son of mine would ever be <I>sorry</I>! That’s pussy talk.” Mr. Huff growled and hit enter. “There!”<br />
<br />
Axel Huff blinked and looked himself over. Still a young, athletic wolf, handsome and well-hung like his father. What had his Dad changed about him? Something was off…about everything. All his memories had subtly changed. He knew it was something big, but Axel just couldn’t place what.<br />
<br />
“Feeling any different, Axel?” Mr. Huff leered.<br />
<br />
“No.” Axel scrunched his brows. “Am I…smaller?”<br />
<br />
“No, son. I’d never make you smaller.” Mr. Huff grinned. “You don’t notice, so why does it matter?”<br />
<br />
Axel sat in his seat, confused. Damian saw the worry in his son’s eyes and chuckled to himself. Being mean was one thing, but breaking someone, making them like you, that was true cruelty. Axel would be a son he could be proud of when Damian was done with him. A total badass.</p>
