<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They went to the Chinese man to ask for help, he admitted a mistake in that he had underdone the dose. What had happened is it brought Heather near full term but not to birth. He had factored in that she was a teenager. She would have to age up and give birth naturally. <br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to swallow another vial of your shit?!?&quot; she moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only way H.&quot; Ben concluded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine give it to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Chinese man took her into the back room and gave her the potion. She swallowed it&#39;s bitter taste and hit the ground clutching her belly in tears as her body felt like it had been soaked in gasoline and set one fire. Her body started to grow and mature. Her ass became fuller, her breasts (already big from the pregnancy) expanded as her chest did, her top split down the side from her increasing size. From less than five feet she was soon five feet five as her legs grew longer and more importantly stronger. <br />
<br />
Her face became more developed until it became that of a woman. Her shoulder length became a curly mop that went down the length of her back. She looked at her nude pregnant body in the mirror, a collection of bumps, her buttocks, her breasts and her belly. Ben walked in...she grabbed a blanket.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about knocking asshole?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing I&#39;ve seen before. I got you some clothes, a green maternity dress, bra, panties and sneakers. I had to guess at the sizes.&quot;<br />
<br />
To her surprise they fit. She had her breasts sitting loose in the fabric, too many bras had gone bust on her, but the dress was like a green Bavarian maid&#39;s outfit, instead green. With loose, baggy arms, legs and chest she admired her adult form in the mirror. Combined with the ballet flats she looked like a redheaded mother to be.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Heather we need to move.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I like being a woman Ben, especially with the baby, but a timeskip of 15 years is going to be a lot to explain to my parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will break once you give birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
He explained that he was her younger brother taking her to the hospital, she had complained of pains. <br />
<br />
Ben gave her the final vial of something green that would make the baby come. She drank it and suddenly the whole mass of her belly went down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck!&quot; she groaned.<br />
<br />
They rushed her into the hospital as she felt pain as the pressure pushed through her pelvis and hips. She was cursing foul but it was working. She felt like her belly had a bowling ball in it as she was wheeled into the maternity ward. Her stomach was as taunt as the skin on a drum as she was asked if she wanted a c-section or a natural birth. Natural she said as waves of pain took her over body. <br />
<br />
Her water broke as warm liquid trickled from between her legs and onto the padding on the bed her legs spread wide she was completely nude as they cut off her dress and pulled the plastic curtain around her. <br />
<br />
&quot;PUSH!&quot; she yelled. <br />
<br />
She felt one continuous contraction as she started to give birth, she felt like she was going to be ripped apart but she suddenly felt relief as her load was brought into the world. Her baby was born, a girl. They offered it to her but she refused. Heather collapsed and slept for 24 hours. When she woke up she was sore and they were asking her questions but she knew she would have to get away from here. The baby was real enough for now but the illusion needed a host. <br />
<br />
When a pregnant woman, Ben carried that enchantment, when he turned and got her pregnant she carried it, now the baby was the end result of Sofia&#39;s illusion. It couldn&#39;t survive, it would die or simply vanish and so would she, back to her teenage form. <br />
<br />
She discharged herself from the hospital and spent the next few days in her female body, was this what she was going to look like in ten to fifteen years? She spent most of her time nude. Looking at her adult body, was this a glimpse into the future or just more Chinese magic?<br />
<br />
She had about five days, on her third day she visited Sofia. Sofia didn&#39;t realize who she was done up as a twenty five year old redhead, the puffiness of pregnancy having left her she visited her main rival to be Ben&#39;s bitch of choice. Sofia was still a bitch even after all that Ben had done for/to her. Sofia normally could stand up to Heather but she had given birth to twins and Heather was angry at Sofia. She smothered her with a pillow. <br />
<br />
Leaving behind hairs that could be DNA&#39;d but by then she would be a teenager again, good luck explaining that time jump to a jury.<br />
<br />
Finally her and Ben&#39;s baby girl was being bottle fed when it started to disappear in the nurse&#39;s hands to her horror it became like a hologram, visible but see through and then it vanished to nothing.<br />
<br />
Heather felt it as well like a crackling snap of her bones as she started to turn back. She felt like a house creaking in a hurricane about to collapse. With pinches, more like pricks of a needle, her breasts deflated and and plump ass deflated into that of a teenager. She looked at Ben; &quot;Enjoying the show?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I asked the Chinese man for something just for you, when I made the request you had killed one rapist. Now you have murdered Sofia, I know because I felt her die, so you must be punished.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck have you done? I had your fucking baby!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what stopped me from killing you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! How far back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Toddler, baby maybe?&quot;<br />
<br />
The room started to twist as Heather landed on all fours panting as her breasts jiggled less and less until her chest flattened to nothing. Her hands started to shrink as did the rest of her body. Soon she was sitting in the corner crying for her mommy. Ben left another loose end tied up. He wouldn&#39;t make the age reversal permanent but a sentence of 6 months should make her reform.</p>
