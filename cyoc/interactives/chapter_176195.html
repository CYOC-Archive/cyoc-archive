<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake began to say, &quot;Transform,&quot; when he sneezed halfway through. He had managed to get most of the word out, so it counted, right? He eyed the phone warily and heard a slight chuckle from the other line. It sent a chill down his spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, too bad, now you get both,&quot; Kyle jeered. &quot;For your transformation, you&#39;ll become the parasite to society that you are. You&#39;ll keep your good looks like that pretty face and those nice arms and abs, but from the waist down, you&#39;re going to become a monstrous centipede-like parastie, similar to that zombie shooter game. I can&#39;t remember the name of it, but it doesn&#39;t matter. Your lower body will be long and flexible and have six buggy legs that end in sharp claws, and the tip of your tail will have a stinger or ovipositor that you use to infect others. When you infect someone, you&#39;ll lay your eggs in their ass and if the eggs are unfertilized, the other person will transform into a parasite like you. If the eggs are fertilized, they&#39;ll stay in the person until they&#39;re the size of a watermelon and then get crapped out before hatching into full-grown parasites like you. They&#39;ll come to you and treat you as their mother and you&#39;ll care for them and love them and you&#39;ll even find them sexy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake almost laughed, the whole thing sounded so absurd. He wanted to tell Kyle to shut the fuck up and leave him alone, but when he tried to move his mouth he found he was frozen to the spot. No, was this thing actually real? Was he about to become some sort of monster?!<br />
<br />
&quot;For your dare,&quot; Kyle continued, &quot;you&#39;re going to become gay. You&#39;ll find men and only men attractive, and think that they&#39;re the perfect hosts for your eggs. You&#39;ll infect them by having anal sex with them using the end of your tail, and it&#39;ll be the most amazing sex you&#39;ve ever had. You&#39;ll remember being straight, and if you try to infect a girl, she&#39;ll become a guy, and everyone will remember her as always being that way except for you and me. You&#39;ll be the only one who remembers what you were like before, everyone else will find you and your body and its effects completely normal. Have fun infecting people!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the line disconnected and Jake could only stare at the phone. This had to be fake. There was no way the curse was real! He tried to laugh it off but his laugh was nervous and he looked around wondering what would happen. Suddenly he felt a sharp pain in his groin, and his jeans felt like they were burning him.<br />
<br />
Jake pulled his clothes off as fast as he could, and nearly screamed when he saw that his feet had each become a single large claw, connected to legs that were too long and too skinny. The skin was still the same color, but it seemed to become slightly darker and harder, ideal for going out without needing any protection over it. As Jake watched his legs become spidery limbs, his groin pulsed with pain again and he doubled over gasping as he saw his penis begin to enlarge and expand. It seemed to absorb the rest of his body, pushing his spindly legs off to the side as it grew to be as wide around as his waist and segmented like a centipede&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Jake&#39;s mutated penis began to lengthen, growing more segments between his abs and the segment his legs were attached to, until he was able to stand upright from the space between his legs and abs alone. But the changes didn&#39;t stop there. New segments began to emerge between his dick and his legs, and soon four more insectoid legs, each with their own segment of his parasitic body, had grown. He steadied himself on his six claws and turned to see what was happening, unnerved at how flexible he now was. His penis continued to lengthen and grow behind him like a scorpion&#39;s tail until he was at least fifteen feet long from the top of his head to the tip of his &quot;tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once his body stopped lengthening, Jake looked on in horror as his cock head - the final segment of his new body - began to expand further, his urethra opening and seeming to push out of itself so it was like its own cock within his cock. It reminded him of that horror movie with the aliens that had a smaller mouth inside their mouthes. Two long claw-like things grew along the sides of his mini-cock, but he didn&#39;t know what to call them. They weren&#39;t hard like his claws were, though they tapered to point, and they felt strong and flexible, almost like another pair of hands. When the things he decided to call his end legs were fully grown, his cock - ovipositor, an unwanted thought corrected him - slipped back into the last segment of his body.<br />
<br />
Jake stood panting as he looked at his new body, and screamed. What had that asshole done to him?! He couldn&#39;t go to school like this! He absentmindedly began to pace, trying not to notice how his six legs worked in tandem and his tail swished back and forth and arched up and back like a scorpion to avoid hitting walls. No, no, no, no, no, this was just a nightmare and he needed to wake up. He needed to find someone who could help him. He needed to -<br />
<br />
His thoughts were cut short as he caught sight of himself in the mirror. His muscles looked a little bigger, slightly more toned. He had always been hot, but seeing his reflection, he began to feel... aroused. The end of his tail twitched and his end legs pawed at the opening where his ovipositor was growing a bit hard and slowly emerging, feeling warm and wet and like the best boner he had ever had. He gasped at the heightened sensitivity, the sensations sending wave after wave of pleasure up his horrible new body. He moaned as his end legs pulled his opening open slightly, allowing his ovipositor to more easily slide in and out of the end of his tail. A rumble in his gut and a heavy feeling of something sliding through his intestines, down his tail to his leg segments, and sitting heavily made him realize exactly what he needed to do.<br />
<br />
He needed to lay his eggs.</p>
