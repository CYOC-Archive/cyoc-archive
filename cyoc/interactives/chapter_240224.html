(Clarissa&#39;s POV)<br />
Stepping out of the bathroom, I tugged the door shut behind me with a casual slam, like nothing had just happened. My heart was still pounding, my body practically humming with a restless energy I couldn’t shake. The air in the room felt cooler, crisper, against my skin, and yeah—I was definitely feeling it. My thighs squeezing together in a way that wasn’t exactly normal, and I had to resist the urge to touch my shorts... not that it would’ve helped much. The wet warmth between my legs was a nice reminder. I felt electric, like my skin couldn’t contain all the restless, swirling energy thrumming beneath the surface.<br />
Amelia and Stacey looked up the second I stepped into the room. Amelia’s face was drawn tight, shifting slightly on the bed like she was dealing with her own personal nightmare. Stacey, on the other hand, raised an eyebrow, arms crossed, her expression sitting somewhere between mild concern and thinly-veiled amusement.<br />
“Finally,” Stacey muttered, tapping her fingers against her leg. “Took you long enough.”<br />
I rolled my eyes, tugging at the hem of my shorts like it might somehow shield me from any scrutiny. &quot;Yeah, yeah, had to freshen up or whatever,&quot; I shot back, forcing a lopsided grin. The words felt a little too light, a little too forced, because my body was still buzzing, every nerve on high alert after what had just gone down with Ryan. My chest was tight, my skin flushed, and honestly? If they looked too hard, they’d probably figure it out.<br />
Then it hit—sharp, relentless, and way too familiar.<br />
&quot;Ah—shit!&quot; I barked, both hands shooting to my chest like I’d just taken a hit to the ribs. The invisible force clamped down hard on my nipples, twisting and pulling like some sadistic coach cranking the resistance dial to max. A fresh wave of heat rolled through me, and I bit my lip hard, trying to ignore the conflicting sensations battling inside me. The worst part? I was already running hot from... earlier, and this? This was just making it all so much worse.<br />
My breath hitched as the sharp pinching twisted in tandem with the deep ache I’d been ignoring, the throbbing need inside me only stoked by the added stimulation. It hurt, but damn if it didn’t scratch an itch I didn’t want to admit was there. Each sharp tug sent a ripple of tension through me, the pinch on the nipple shocking through me to clenching my ass, and I had to fight the urge to moan. God, I hate that this feels good.<br />
&quot;Bro, come on!&quot; I groaned, staggering forward, knees nearly buckling as another jolt shot through me. Every step was a struggle, each movement sending another spike of unbearable sensation rippling through my chest. I could feel Amelia and Stacey’s eyes on me, and yeah—I knew I looked ridiculous.<br />
Amelia winced, her face scrunching up like she could somehow feel it too. &quot;You gonna make it?&quot; she asked, voice tight with something I couldn’t quite place.<br />
Stacey didn’t even try to hide the amusement in her tone. &quot;Yeah, no kidding. You good there, Clar?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, I get it,&quot; I grunted, shuffling toward the board like I was walking through quicksand. My chest felt like it was on fire, and I had to resist the urge to grab myself just to dull the ache. Not that it would help. &quot;Board’s got it out for me, what else is new?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just roll,&quot; Amelia said, shifting awkwardly on the bed, hiding behind a pillow, her knuckles tight where she gripped a it. Whatever was going on with her, she wasn’t having a great time either.<br />
Stacey tapped her nails against the bed frame, watching me with way too much satisfaction. &quot;Yeah, Clar, roll before it gets worse.&quot; She smirked, clearly enjoying the show a little too much.<br />
&quot;I am, man, chill,&quot; I snapped, fumbling for the dice with shaking hands, wincing as another sharp twist made me jolt forward. My chest burned, my breath coming out in ragged huffs, and I could still feel the lingering heat pooling in my stomach, making every tiny movement distracting as hell.<br />
I tossed the dice onto the board with more force than necessary, watching them bounce and tumble before finally landing on a five. The second that number popped up, the pinching vanished, and I nearly collapsed against the table, panting, my whole body buzzing in the aftermath.<br />
&quot;Oh, finally,&quot; I groaned, running a hand through my hair and trying not to let them see how relieved I was. I could still feel the ghost of the sensation, the ache lingering like a phantom touch, and yeah... I kind of missed it already.<br />
But, of course, the game wasn’t done with me yet. The board lit up again, and those stupid fancy words scrolled across the surface, all mystical and smug.<br />
&quot;Strength within, a core refined,<br />
The frame of power now aligned.<br />
Six shall rise, carved in stone,<br />
A sculpted path to stand alone.&quot;<br />
I blinked at it, then squinted. &quot;Dude... am I about to get ripped?&quot;<br />
<br />
(Amelia&#39;s POV) <br />
From my spot on the bed, I watched it unfold, and honestly? It was infuriating.<br />
Clarissa stood there, blinking down at herself like she wasn’t sure if something was happening yet, but I could see it—the slow tightening, the definition creeping across her stomach. It started subtle, just a soft ripple beneath her skin, but within seconds, it was like her whole core redefined itself.<br />
Her fingers pressed into the new ridges forming under her shirt, and when she lifted it, her eyes went wide. &quot;Dude,&quot; she whispered, staring at the sculpted six-pack that now stared back at her. &quot;I’m jacked.&quot;<br />
Stacey scoffed beside me, arms still crossed, her eyes narrowing. &quot;Oh, cool, so you get abs while I got a metal detector’s worst nightmare?&quot;<br />
Clarissa grinned, tracing her fingers over the rock-solid abs like she’d just discovered buried treasure. &quot;Bro, this is sick!&quot; she laughed, twisting her torso side to side, watching the definition flex and shift. &quot;I could do crunches forever.&quot;<br />
I hugged my pillow tighter, shifting uncomfortably. This wasn’t fair. I’d been stuck with... This burning ass, and she gets a six-pack? My stomach churned, clenching my butt cheek muscles pressing tighter together as I had been for the last 20 mins, the intrusion and clenching becoming second nature.<br />
&quot;How’s it feel?&quot; I asked, trying not to let my irritation seep into my voice.<br />
Clarissa dropped her shirt with a smug grin. &quot;Like I could bench press both of you.&quot; She patted her stomach and flexed again. &quot;Not gonna lie, kinda digging this.&quot;<br />
Stacey groaned, rubbing her temples. &quot;Of course you are.&quot; She gestured vaguely at Clarissa’s abs. <br />
Clarissa smirked, shooting her a wink. &quot;Jealous?&quot;<br />
Stacey&#39;s jaw tightened. &quot;Of you? No. Of the fact that this game gave you something useful instead of... this?&quot; She cupped her breasts showcasing the indents of nipples and piercings, glaring at the board like it had personally betrayed her. &quot;Yeah, a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Stacey&#39;s POV)  <br />
Frustration twist in my chest.<br />
“You’re way too into this,” I muttered, picking at the frayed cuffs of my hoodie, my gaze fixed anywhere but on Amelia, who was fidgeting beside me. “Like, yeah, cool, you’ve got abs now, but what happens when it’s something worse?”<br />
Clarissa leaned back, draping an arm over the chair like she owned the place. “Guess I’ll be the first to know,” she said with that signature cocky smirk. “If I start craving raw eggs or running stairs at dawn, you guys better keep up.”<br />
I rolled my eyes. “You’re impossible.”<br />
She grinned, lifting her shirt again and giving her stomach a playful slap. “Nah, I’m unstoppable. Look at this! I could probably carry the whole volleyball team on my back.”<br />
Amelia sighed, hugging a pillow to her chest like it was the only thing keeping her grounded. “It’s... weird,” she murmured. “Seeing it happen like that. So fast.”<br />
Clarissa’s smirk wavered just a little, and for a second, something softer flickered in her eyes. “Yeah,” she admitted, running a hand over her stomach. “It is weird.” She shot me a look and shrugged. “But hey, could’ve been worse, right?”<br />
I chewed on the inside of my cheek, feeling the weight of the piercings shifting uncomfortably beneath my clothes. &quot;Sure,&quot; I muttered, even though it didn’t feel like it. Not even close. It felt like I’d drawn the short straw and she’d walked away with a prize.<br />
Without warning, Clarissa reached over and ruffled my hair like I was some little kid. “Relax, Stace. We got this.”<br />
I swatted her hand away with a glare. “God, you’re annoying.”<br />
Clarissa just stretched, standing up and flexing again for emphasis. “And shredded,” she shot back, flashing a grin that only made me groan louder.<br />
Amelia crossed her arms, shooting her a pointed look. “You know, it’s kinda messed up how you’re just... enjoying this.” She shifted uncomfortably, her expression clouding over. “We’re dealing with real stuff here, and you’re over there admiring your new abs like it’s nothing.”<br />
Clarissa shrugged, her face settling into something more serious for a split second before she brushed it off with an easy grin. “Bro, it’s either this or losing my shit. I pick the fun option.”<br />
I groaned, sinking deeper into the mattress. “This game sucks.”<br />
Clarissa just winked, running a hand over her stomach again. “Nah, you just need to hit the gym more.”</p>
