<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The 7th month of David&#39;s growth stayed busy for both David and Jason.  David&#39;s success at work meant he had to stay late occasionally to write up orders so that his staff could process them.  Success creates it own problems, but David was still usually able to get to the gym 3 nights a week and always went on Saturday morning.  He wanted to go on Sundays but respected Jason&#39;s wish that Sundays would be their day together.<br />
<br />
Mark had stayed true to his word and had grown to 7&#39;1&quot; and 340 lbs, matching his younger brother in muscle at least.  Steven was delighted and intimidated as Mark&#39;s huge dick stretched another inch to 16 inches of prime Asian meat. The two of them were clearly in love and were a good match.  Steven had really gotten into working out and had already put on about 10 pounds of muscle.  That was enough to give him the muscle bug, he started to become obsessed with eating enough protein and would always arrive before Mark at the gym.  <br />
<br />
Mark was thrilled that with his extra inches and muscle.  He became convinced that the universe was rewarding him for his good behavior, though he really did not need any motivation as being good came to him naturally. In any case,  he decided then that he would be the best man he could be.  Though his immense size intimidated other men, even most Asians, his big smile and gentle manner usually put them at ease quickly.  He would always enter a space with a grin and jovially, brightening the dullest room quickly.  The only time he was ever stern or used his size to intimidate people was when he saw someone being bullied.  All the big Asian guys at the gym quickly learned that he would not tolerate that bullshit and were respectful of the littles. There was really only one that could stand up to him and that was John, but they were never at the gym together.  Mark was still avoiding him, leaving their apartment early in the morning and sneaking in late.  <br />
<br />
One morning, Jason really noticed the size disparity between Steven and Mark as he was on the stair climber watching them work out. Jason knew that Steven was versatile, they had a lot of personal conversations at the coffee shop, but he wondered about Mark. That evening, before David got home, Jason took out the book and said, &quot;show me information on Mark Lee&#39;s sexuality and preferences.&quot;   To his surprise, the book revealed that the giant was versatile leaning towards bottom.  &quot;show me information on Steven Nguyen&#39;s sexuality and preferences.&quot; Top leaning towards versatile.  &quot;Oh boys,  you are about to have some fun,&quot; Jason thought as he wrote in the margins.  &quot;Steven Nguyen will grow 4 inches height, gain solid lean muscle until he weighs at least 300 lbs, and his penis will grow to 18 inches over the next 4 months.&quot; Jason knew that Steven liked Mark being bigger than him, but he thought Steven might enjoy a little extra size.  <br />
<br />
David was frustrated at not working out as much as he wanted over the course of the month, and was not as excited about measurement day as usual.  When he learned that he had still gained 15 pounds and was now 325, his excitement increased though he said &quot;could have been 20.&quot;  When Jason had to get a stool to reach above David&#39;s head, his excitement fully returned.  As his dick rapidly inflated, David said with a wink and a grin, &quot;I might be too much for you to handle, little man.&quot; Jason replied gently twisting David&#39;s nipple,  &quot;I think I know exactly how to handle you.&quot;  The tape showed another inch in height increase to 6&#39;9&#39;&quot; and  another half inch of dick meat, making David&#39;s impressive member 15 and 1/2 inches long.<br />
<br />
As the first week of the 8th month of David&#39;s growth came to a close, David was frustrated.  There was only one who could really lift as much as him at the gym in the evening and there was no way that David was going to speak to John, much less ask him to be his partner.  Despite David&#39;s gains, John would still taunt him thinking that David would never catch up to him.  &quot;Good for you for putting on a little muscle,&quot; John would say, &quot;too bad you still have a baby dick,&quot; or &quot;that you are so short,&quot; or something like that. David would just ignore him.  <br />
<br />
Mark had continued to grow per the book&#39;s edits and now stood 7&#39;2&quot; and weighed in at 365, matching his brothers height but out weighing him by 15 pounds.  His body was almost as lean as John and showed incredible definition making him even more impressive.  Mark also now had size 23 feet. Having decided to confront John, Mark waited in their apartment wearing a pair of John new sneakers he had taken.  &#39;What the fuck do you think your doing?&quot; was how John greeted his brother, staring at his expensive new shoes on Mark&#39;s feet.  &quot;Did you put on extra socks to make them fit?&quot; John smirked. As Mark stood to greet his brother, John&#39;s smirk faded. He was now looking eye to eye with Mark, but realized Mark outweighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;John, I don&#39;t want to fight, but I am taking these.&quot; Mark said defiantly, &quot;and you are moving back to mom&#39;s tonight.&quot; <br />
<br />
John was turning red with rage, but checked himself being unsure if he to take his growing brother.   &quot;Fuck off Mark, you can have the shoes, but why should I move.  It&#39;s not like you need this whole place to yourself and you are never here anyway.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish it did not have to be like this, but you are bully, John, and I don&#39;t like being around you anymore.&quot; Mark replied, &quot;and, not that it is any of your business, but I am planning on asking Steven to move in with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you Mark!&quot; John yelled, &quot;I can&#39;t believe your little sissy boy hasn&#39;t gotten tired of your baby dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby dick!?!&quot; Mark said as he pulled out his limp 15 inch dick.  &quot;It&#39;s 17 now. Want me to get it hard to show you?  Oh, and its way thicker than yours. Just get your clothes and get out!  You know all this shit is mine and if you fuck with anything, I will find you and beat your sorry ass!&quot;  Mark took a deep breath mad that he lost control, but John had a way of bringing the worst out in people. &quot;John, you are my brother and I wish we could be friends.&quot; Mark said calmly having regained his composure. &quot;But the way you treat me and other people is not acceptable and I don&#39;t think you have any plans to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God you are pathetic.&quot; John replied, &quot;Why should I change.  We are the superior men, the littles want to serve us. Even, the Asians worship me.  Mark, why would you give that up?,&quot; John paused and when Mark did not respond. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,  I will go so you can have your little gay love nest. Pathetic.&quot; John said throwing a bag on his bed.  When he had filled the bag,  he threw the key at Mark and said, &quot;just drop the rest at Mom&#39;s this week.  I&#39;ll figure something out.&quot;<br />
<br />
As John left, Mark sat down relieved that it was over and exhilarated that he finally had confronted his brother.  Mark clean the apartment that afternoon,  John was a pig and the place reeked of his sweat and cum.  He took a few garbage bags and filled them with the remainder of John&#39;s things. When he was satisfied that the last remnants of John were gone, he called Steven. &quot;Hi handsome, do you have a few minutes to swing by my apartment. There is something I want to talk to you about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason very happy for Mark and Steven when Steven told him the news at the coffee shop one afternoon in the middle of the month. He was also glad to hear that Mark had stood up to John.  Steven said, &quot;yeah but now he feels like he shouldn&#39;t let John dictate any aspect of his life and wants to workout in the evening again.  I could change to the morning shift whenever i wanted, there are perks to your dad owning the shop, but I like the afternoons.&quot; Steven continued, &quot;I really don&#39;t mind working out by myself and would be OK if Mark started working out in the evening but he wants a partner.  And really, it is not like I can lift anywhere near as much as him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I have an idea.&quot;  Jason said and explained David&#39;s frustration. &quot;I&#39;ll talk to him this evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is good news, I think they would get along well together.&quot; Steven said,  &quot;by the way mister,  you must have upped your game. You are looking tight and those legs and ass are on fire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason looked around and no one was in view, &quot;watch this,&quot; he said as put his foot above his head on the brick column next to him, basically doing a split while standing.  &quot;Wow!&quot; was all Steven could muster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, thanks.&quot; Jason said with a smile, &quot;you are looking pretty good yourself. How much muscle have you put on?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;25 pounds in little over a month,&quot; Steven said, &quot;Mark says it normal for Asian men who haven&#39;t lifted before to put on muscle rapidly at first, but I think I am having a growth spurt too.  My dad thought I looked taller so he made me measure yesterday and I was just over 6&#39;9&quot;, he is so proud. He is only 6&#39;5&quot; and was worried that he would pass his short genes to me. I think he&#39;d lose his mind if I were to make it to 7 feet.  I am only 21, so there is plenty of time for me to grow,&quot; Steven concluded.<br />
<br />
When Jason got home that evening he found David standing in the kitchen with just an apron and the size 22 flip flops on. His feet now filled the flip flops out completely.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Um babe,  that is my new favorite outfit.&quot; Jason said getting a full view of David&#39;s glorious muscle ass as he turned to check the stove, &quot;but do we need to go to Yoshida&#39;s tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I went today,&quot; David replied, &quot; the 23s were a little roomy, but I figured I would grow into them.  I haven&#39;t stopped yet.&quot; He smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;23s were probably the right choice,  I don&#39;t know how much longer you will be able to wear those flips.&quot; Jason said, as he watched David&#39;s dick begin to tent the apron at the talk of big feet and growing. &quot;before you get all excited, I want to talk to you about something.&quot; Jason told David about his conversation with Steven.  &quot;You need someone that can lift with you, and Mark definitely can. Are you interested?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know babe,  he did apologize to me and seems like he is being nice to your friend, but I don&#39;t think i trust him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;David, they are in love and I have seen the difference in the guy with my own eyes.  Will you just meet him to talk about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; David replied, &quot;dinner is almost ready, go sit down.  I am going to throw on some clothes, be right back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Jason pleaded, &quot;all you need is the apron&quot;<br />
<br />
That weekend, Jason and Steven arranged for David and Mark to meet for couple of beers at Big Boys, an Asian meathead bar. Upon coming home, David said, &quot;very funny sending us to that place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean,&quot; Jason replied with a chuckle, &quot;How did it go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, everyone there stared at Mark all night. That dude is huge. And I don&#39;t ever want to hear &#39;how much do bench bruh&#39; again&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,  how did it go with Mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are right, he is a nice guy.&quot;  David admitted, &quot;He&#39;s going to meet me at the gym Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
The following Monday, John wasn&#39;t happy about seeing Mark with David in the gym that evening.  Primarily because he did not like having someone bigger than him there.  <br />
<br />
Mark pushed David hard. For the next couple of weeks, David had the hardest workouts of his life and he loved it.  He had delegated a lot of work at the office, really just being there to close the deal and let others handle the details, and was able to resume getting to the gym 6 days a week.  <br />
<br />
The proof that Mark&#39;s pushing was paying off came on Measurement day.  &quot;Mark said if I break 340, I&#39;ll outweigh John.&quot; David said stepping on the scale, &quot;343...Oh my god, I am 343 pounds.&quot; The idea of outweighing John aroused David so much that he took Jason right there in the bathroom fucking him against the sink, without taking his other measurements first. Later, still sticky with jizz and sweat, Jason stood on the stool to mark David&#39;s height. At the end of eight months of growth, David was 6&#39;10&quot;, weighed 343 lbs, was ripped to shreds, had size 22/23 feet and had a girthy 16 inch cock.</p>
