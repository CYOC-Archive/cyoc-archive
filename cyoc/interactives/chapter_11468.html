<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Francisco watched the 3 year old Sean doze off to sleep in his adult son's arm's. Even after the jerk off session, Marco and Ric were still a little hysterical about their tiny dicks. That's when it hit Francisco. If we couldn't make our cocks age on their own, maybe we could make them age with the rest of us. Wait, I don't want to be a middle aged guy with a teenage cock. My body is great right now, at this age, I'd like to have the cock to match. Francisco walked over to the sofa and sat down. He opened the book on the coffee table. Well, since Ric is the one who started all this, I guess he should be the one to test it, thought Francisco. He stood up, turned around to face Ric and began the spell. <br />
All eyes were on Francisco, he was reading from the book, and it was obvious that whatever spell he was reciting, was meant for Ric. Ric's eyes went wide, what could Mr. Mendes be doing to me?, he thought. His skin started to itch, he looked down at his chest and arms. The hair was growing back wards, it was getting sucked back into his skin. The same thing was happening on his legs and crotch. He could feel the hairs creeping back wards against his skin in his armpits. Ric let out a loud burp and seemed to lose a couple of inches in height. &quot;I must only be 5'5 now, everyone here is taller than me except little Sean.&quot; He murmured. He felt now that Francisco was returning him to his original age, which wasn't so bad, after all, his cock wouldn't look so tiny on a scrawny 13 year old body instead of a hunky 18 year old one. Ric looked around the room, he was approaching his original age. Everything seemed to be at around the right height, and his body seemed to be about 13, except for his cock, of course. He had lost the muscles he had gained, but he had expected that. He shrugged off his clothes, they were way to big for him now. Suddenly he burped again. The spell didn't stop, he was getting shorter, things were looking way too tall. Ric looked pleadingly at Mr. Mendes, with a questioning look on his face. Mr. Mendes smiled back and said gently, &quot;I have an idea Ric, just trust me, all right?&quot; Ric nodded his head in agreement, he didn't say &quot;yes&quot; because he was too afraid that if he opened his mouth, another burp would come, and his height would go. He felt the pressure building up in his chest he tried to hold it in. Mr. Mendes said, &quot;Just let it out, Ric.&quot; Ric's eyes were watering, he finally opened his mouth and let it out. Another loud burp escaped from Ric's slightly smaller body. This time, Ric, felt like he had tripped. He lost so much age with this last burp. He guessed that he had been around 12 or 11 and 1/2 before, but after that last belch, he was probably closer to 5 or 6. He examined his body as everyone else moved in closer to watch his transformation. He had lost all his body hair and all his visible muscles were gone. He had a thin layer of baby fat developing on his body. Josh approached five year old Ric and picked him up in his arms. It felt strange to Ric to be held like a baby in his little brother's arms. Even if his little brother was old enough to be his dad now. Little Ric had a worried expression on his face. He could still feel one more burp trying to break out of his little body. Mr. Mendes nodded to him, he was letting him know it was almost over, and to just let go. Tiny Ric burped. The whole world seemed to pull away from him. Within a few seconds his arms and legs and pulled into his body, his muscles became weak and difficult to use. Even his eyes looked at things differently. Ric guessed that he was somewhere under a year old. Josh was massive now. He held baby Ric with one arm. <br />
Francicso now began reciting the next spell. The plan was to bring Ric's age down to the age of his penis, then to age them back to normal together. He began reading the spell out loud.</p>
