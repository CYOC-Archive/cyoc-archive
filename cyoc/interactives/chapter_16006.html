<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Whoops! I'll have to tell you about my nephew later, gotta head home.  I'll talk to you later Milton&quot; Max said as he ran down the street in a blur.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Soon after Max was changed in the gym, Milton and the rest of the guys were going through final exams, which meant pretty much everything went on hold for studying and writing.  This included going to the gym for Milton, but it didn't bother him because he knew he had to do well in his studies.  Day and night he studied, throwing the same passion that he had for the weights into his studying.  It paid off, because Milton did quite well on his exams, even the ones that he struggled with. Summer vacation was now upon him.<br />
<br />
After his last exam, Milton went home and just goofed off for the rest of the day, because he felt like had earned it.  Later that night, he stood in front of the mirror, looking at himself and his muscles.  He'd lost a little bit of mass during exam time because he wasn't studying, but it was really not a noticeable amount.  You could clearly see a good amount of muscle underneath his tight t-shirt and his shorts, chest clearly defined, biceps bulging, calves that looked like big diamonds jutted out from the backs of his legs.  Milton, while knowing that he was growing stronger and more muscular, was also oblivious to his body.  He didn't realize just how big he was, or how much he had changed.  Compliments abounded for his physique, but he never really paid much attention to them, so he never caught on.<br />
<br />
Falling asleep, he began to dream...this dream was unusual for him because he never had it before, or even had anything close to it before.  In the dream, he dreamt that he was back stage at a bodybuilding contest, just about to go onstage.  He looked down at himself, and realized he was enormous, way bigger than what he currently looked like, pumped and oiled down.  As his name is called, he shakes his head to regain composure, and goes onto the posing dias, ready to do his routine.  When the music starts playing, he performs moves and starts flexing like he had never done so before, and then goes offstage.  He is called out as one of the finalists and starts going through all the posing trying to impress the judges enough to get a good placement.  Milton is totally aghast that he is doing all this stuff, but his body moves fluidly and his muscles bulge and flex huge without him really knowing what's going on.  It becomes time to crown the winner, and Milton is one of the top three.  He wins second place, and turns around to congratulate the winner, a hugely massive man who is incredibly handsome.  The winner gives him a hug and whispers in Milton's ear &quot;I'll see you soon!&quot;, giving Milton a little peck on the cheek.  As soon as Milton feels lips on his cheek, he wakes up from the dream in a cold sweat.<br />
<br />
Turning on his bedside lamp, he races to the mirror to look at himself.  He is relieved to see that he is not as big as the man he was in the dream, and yet suddenly saddened for a reason he can't quite understand.  Milton raises his arms in a double bicep flex, just like he was doing in the dream, and then laughed at himself, thinking that it was preposterous.  &quot;I'm not that big&quot; Milton said to himself, and then he went back to bed.<br />
<br />
Since Milton was feeling lazy the next day, he slept in before doing anything, getting up around 10 in the morning.  He went downstairs and found a note telling him that his family was gone for a while on an emergency trip and will get in contact with him as soon as they could.  Milton made himself some brunch, and ate it while surfing the net on his computer.  After breakfast, he went and had a shower to get cleaned up before going to the gym because he felt really sweaty and sticky for some reason.  While in the shower, he was soaping up his muscular body, and started having flashbacks to his dream, which worried Milton, because he had no idea what it meant.  &quot;Why am I having these dreams? I'm a geek, not a bodybuilder, or am I?&quot;  After getting cleaned up, he grabbed his stuff and headed down to the gym for a good workout.<br />
<br />
Having missed the gym for three weeks, Milton thought he would be considerably weaker than what he was, but this was not the case.  He was just as strong, maybe a bit stronger than the last time he came here.  A lot of the guys came up and talked to him, asking him how his exams went and all sorts of other pleasantries.  Pumping iron felt exhilarating today, and Milton felt better than he had in a long time.  His muscles pumped up bigger than they normally did, and went Milton went to look at himself in the mirror, a couple of the guys joked that he should start competing.  Milton responded that he wasn't that big and headed off to the change room.  He quickly changed into some clean clothes and then headed off to the mall.<br />
<br />
The computer store was Milton's destination, but a couple of stalls down from there was a nutrition shop that was having a picture signing and photo op session with a massive bodybuilder.  &quot;Tim Davis, Professional Bodybuilder&quot; screamed the sandwich boards outside the store.  Tim was sitting there at the table, autographing pictures and occasionally getting up to have his picture taken with another wide-eyed fan.  Some of the fans were quite muscular, but most were either fat or had a hard, lean body.  Boredom had begun to set in, because there is only so much signing and standing in front of flashing bulbs before you want to be somewhere else.  When he finally had a break in the action, he turned to the side, and saw Milton standing there, just outside the computer store eying a computer.  Tim could not believe his eyes, there was this huge teen just hanging around in the mall.  His legs looked like tree trunks, calves like diamonds, and a back that screamed power.  Milton turned around and Tim gasped when he saw the front of Milton, which was even better than the back.  Thick pecs, washboard abs, and bulging biceps, all pulling his shirt tight in all the right places.  Tim scrawled out a note and asked one of the employees at the store to give it to Milton, he had to talk to this very handsome teen god.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meet me at the Westin at 7:00 pm, Rm 1430&quot; is all the note said.  Milton was very confused as to why he got it, and when he looked quizzically at the person who gave it to him, he pointed at Tim sitting at the table.  Milton gasped because he looked exactly like the winning bodybuilder in his dream last night.  Tim looked over and winked at Milton, which sent shivers through his spine.  He had nothing else to do that evening, so he decided to go meet this guy, maybe figure out why he was in his dream.<br />
<br />
At 7 pm sharp, Milton knocked on the door for Rm 1430, and was prompted greeted by Tim at the door.  Tim wore a tshirt stretched over his massive body, and custom made khaki shorts that were tight in the thighs and showed his tremendous calves.  &quot;C'mon in, glad you made it&quot; spoke Tim.  &quot;Thanks for having me, and I'm curious to why you invited me over&quot; Milton asked.  Tim went and sat on the bed, cross-legged style, cleared his throat, and spoke.  &quot;Well, you see, I was in the mall today signing autographs and I saw you standing there.  You look incredible, quite muscular for your age, and I wanted a chance to see you up close and talk to you&quot;.  &quot;Why? I'm not all that muscular!&quot; Milton replied  &quot;Yeah right dude! Have you ever looked at yourself?  You're awesome!  I've never seen a guy your age look so built&quot;.  Tim took Milton over to the mirror and had him strip to his underwear, then Tim himself stripped down to a metallic blue posing strap.  &quot;Pose with me dude&quot; Tim whispered, and Milton felt some strange force guiding him through the poses, mimicking Tim pose for pose, muscles bulging and writhing, veins popping, sweat appearing on the muscles, making them look even bigger.  Slowly, Milton gained a realization that he was damn huge for his age, and that guys even 10 years older than him would kill for the body he had.  &quot;Oh shit! I am really that big Tim?&quot; Milton asked.  &quot;Yeah man, you are that big&quot; Tim said as he wrapped his arms around Milton in a friendly hug, &quot;I wouldn't mind if I lost a competition to a stud like you&quot;.  Milton looked up into the huge man's eyes and found softness and warmth, reached out and pulled Tim in for a long kiss..  Tim did not resist one bit, and rather enjoyed it. &quot;Oh dude! Loved that! Didn't want it to end&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just then, Tim's alarm on his watch went off.  &quot;Oh crap! Sorry man, got another meeting in a little bit so I better get ready.  I'm in town for the rest of the week, so give me a call and we'll get together real soon...by the way, what's your name?&quot;  &quot;Milton&quot; Milton replied.  &quot;Got a middle name? Because Milton sounds like too much of a geek for a big stud like you!&quot; &quot;Well, my middle name is Joshua&quot;  &quot;That settles it, I'm calling you Josh&quot;  &quot;Ooookay&quot;.  Both of them got dressed and went to the door, as Milton was leaving, Tim embraced him again, gave him a peck on the cheek and whispered in his ear &quot;I'll see you soon!&quot;  Milton froze when the door closed behind him, knowing that part of his dream had occurred.<br />
<br />
Milton went home as fast as he could.  He stood in front of the mirror, flexing like he did earlier, pondering the events of the evening.  Now he just had to decide what to do.</p>
