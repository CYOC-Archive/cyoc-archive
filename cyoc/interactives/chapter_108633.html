<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ronnie paces from one side of your room - now nursery - to another, frantically shooting you looks. With his longer legs, he clears the distance in only a few steps, moving forward and back, forward and back.<br />
<br />
&quot;B- mmba,&quot; you gurgle through your uncoordinated mouth. Ronnie&#39;s head whips your way. &quot;Mmbeams.&quot;<br />
<br />
It takes him a moment to work out what you mean. You&#39;re already holding up your arms to be lifted by the time he strides across to lift you up. &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; he says, his voice a deep rumble underneath you. God, but you&#39;re so small! Ronnie seems unbelievably large as he peers down at you, settling you in his hairier, brawnier arms. His chest is so solid that you can&#39;t help but lean against it, feel the soft rise and fall as he breathes.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s so warm, and his hands are so big, and you&#39;re so afraid - it just makes sense to clutch your arms around him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shh,&quot; Ronnie murmurs, jiggling you up and down as he stares at the beans. &quot;You&#39;re okay. I&#39;ve got you, we&#39;ll fix this.&quot; After a moment of deliberation, he picks out a dark blue jelly bean, almost black. You half recognize it as the color he&#39;d eaten. He breaks it into tiny, crumbling pieces, holding a rough thumb to your lips. &quot;Open up.&quot;<br />
<br />
You do as he says, and he pops a tiny piece of the bean into your mouth. It&#39;s so difficult to chew, but you manage it, somehow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shit,&quot; Ronnie swears. When you look, the rest of the bean is on the floor. &quot;Sorry. I&#39;m not used to these fingers,&quot; he says. &quot;Feeling anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
You awkwardly shake your head.<br />
<br />
Ronnie fumbles the next few beans as well, and you still show no signs of changes. It&#39;s getting more and more frustrating. You can feel tears welling up in your eyes. Ronnie cradles you close when you start bawling, letting you calm down until you&#39;re only sniffling every so often. It&#39;s getting harder and harder to think like you used to. The way you used to? Or maybe the way you used to be able to? You don&#39;t know which one is the right one anymore.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ve lost count of how many beans you&#39;ve wasted by the time Ronnie manages to slowly, painstakingly feed you an entire bean, piece by piece.<br />
<br />
And finally, finally, you feel the tug in your gut that signifies the beans beginning to work their magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Down,&quot; you tell Ronnie, articulating the sound with teeth that weren&#39;t there before. He quickly obliges, moving forward as if to support you when you teeter slightly but leaving you be when you quickly find your footing. When you look up at him, he doesn&#39;t seem as gigantic as he was before - in fact, he&#39;s rapidly becoming smaller.<br />
<br />
Or rather, you&#39;re growing taller. You grunt as the first growth spurt hits, the room distorting around you as you shoot up to Ronnie&#39;s height, and the next two quickly follow. Even though Ronnie is pretty well muscled at his new age, you&#39;re surprised to find he&#39;s a little on the short side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back, Sammy,&quot; Ronnie says, clapping you companionably on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to be-&quot; your voice cracks. &quot;Glad to be back,&quot; you tell him, an octave or so lower than before. You&#39;re pretty sure you&#39;re 16, back to the age you used to be before all of this started, but the changes don&#39;t seem to care. It&#39;s not as pronounced as before, but you&#39;re still inching upwards in height, and you can feel a wave of prickles running from your legs upwards to the rest of your body as your body hair grows in. With a creak, your chest slowly broadens, your shoulders pushing further and further apart, and when you raise an arm, you&#39;re surprised to see some muscle there. You aren&#39;t as brawny as Ronnie, but you&#39;re in pretty good shape if you do say so yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you&#39;re my age!&quot; Ronnie says excitedly. He barely reaches your shoulder, now, but he&#39;s much broader and hairier to boot, a thick tuft of red hair poking out of the collar of his t shirt. &quot;Feeling good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; you reply, but you&#39;re a little on edge for some reason. You look down at yourself. Are you still changing? Or is your mind playing tricks on you?<br />
<br />
Without warning, your shirt cleaves itself down the middle before tucking itself into your pants, a row of buttons sliding into newly-formed holes as the fabric stiffens into a stiff, slightly rumpled cotton. It&#39;s the same shade of light blue as your t shirt, but your jeans are rapidly turning darker and smoother, rough denim transitioning into the shiny fabric of suit pants. A belt loops itself around your waist before pulling itself in to the third hole as a silver buckle materializes out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Ronnie says, and he sounds considerably less excited than before. &quot;Fuck. You- you might want to look in the mirror, Sam.&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn to face the mirror hanging on your wall, and your heart nearly stops. Rather than 16, your original age, or 22, Ronnie&#39;s new age, you&#39;re rapidly approaching 30 and showing no sign of stopping. Something looks a little off about your reflection, and when you move a little closer, you feel a completely foreign sensation around your waist.<br />
<br />
The subtle differences in your reflection turn out to be wrinkles; they&#39;re barely there, etched at the corners of your eyes and at the sides of your mouth, but you imagine you can feel them slowly carving themselves onto your face. Inspecting your aged features, however, takes a backseat to investigating whatever&#39;s wrong with your waist. You look down at your pale blue, buttoned shirt, frowning. It obscures the shape of your waist, even while tucked in, and even so you think you might be able to see… you shift, turning to the side, and a brief glance towards the mirror confirms your suspicions, something rapidly dropping in the pit of your stomach.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s a slight but definite curve to your belly. And it&#39;s slowly pushing outwards even as you watch. Your abdomen loses its former tautness as your burgeoning gut creeps forwards, your belt undoing itself only to buckle on the next hole, soon repeating the action as your waist thickens further. A look at your face shows that your jawline has softened somewhat. The beginnings of a second chin are visible if you tilt your head just so, and your features have continued to age, gray strands beginning to spread among your dark brown hair. <br />
<br />
The weight gain continues, developing from the beginnings of middle-aged spread into a modest paunch that droops over the waistband of your pants. When you look down, you can&#39;t help but wince. The excess poundage making itself at home on your midsection has begun spreading across the rest of your torso, and your chest slowly succumbs to the accumulating flab, softening as it droops downwards onto your substantial middle. Your rear, too, expands, sagging slowly down as your waist continues distending, the fit of your suit pants changing shape as they shift to accommodate the added weight.<br />
<br />
And finally, with one last gurgle, the change subsides, the last wrinkles carving themselves into your forehead underneath your salt and pepper hair. A suit jacket flaps into existence around you, shrugging itself onto your shoulders, and yet doing nothing to disguise the ample belly hanging off your front. It looks incongruous on your otherwise-narrow frame; it&#39;s almost as though you&#39;ve swallowed a whole basketball. Only the subtle softness of your face, limbs, and chest belies the impression, your enlarged behind serving as a counterpoint to the weight of your abdomen.<br />
<br />
Within a blink, the room changes, the pastel colors of a child&#39;s nursery giving way to the gleaming wooden walls of a study, and your head fills with new and yet somehow familiar knowledge of your changed life and body. The weight is a result of a healthy love for good food and fine wine combined with a sedentary, sedate lifestyle, both developed along the course of the 20 odd years you&#39;ve been working behind a desk. You&#39;re 44, you note distantly. Nearly twice Ronnie&#39;s new age.<br />
<br />
Ronnie, for his part, is gaping at you, mouth drooping open unattractively. &quot;Holy shit,&quot; he says. &quot;Holy shit, dude, I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t help but feel as though you should be more incensed, but mainly you&#39;re just weary. There&#39;s a dull ache in your lower back. You sit in the comfortable chair near the desk with a sigh, cupping your new flabby mass with both hands. It&#39;s soft to the touch, pliant, a yielding expanse that jiggles when you move it. &quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; you tell him, raising a hand to pinch the bridge of your nose. &quot;Just… be quiet, please, and let me think.&quot;</p>
