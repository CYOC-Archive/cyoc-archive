<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;FINE&quot; Jennifer snapped back. &quot;Transform me, if you really think that&#39;s going to work. Don&#39;t call me again, and go bqck to your little nerd games in the basement.&quot; She slammed the phone with a huff. &quot;Stupid frosh. Now they believe in the curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer resumed her underwear search, looking all over the house (bc she really owns only one pair wth seriously). She finally found them in the bathroom, hidden under her Mom&#39;s clothing. Mom never cleaned up after herself. Suddenly, Jennifer remembered something important. Daylight savings had occurrd. She still had an hour to get ready. Since she had already showered, eaten, packed, and brushed, she decided to lay back in her bed for a while and sleep. She was feeling really tired, and didn&#39;t know why.Her covers had never felt better, and she was soon unconcious in only her underwear, so blissfully oblivious that the memory of Kyle&#39;s call had nearly escaped her mind completely. But not her body...<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Jennifer woke with a start, throwing wild glances around the room, seeking out her clock. 5:00 PM. She had slept through the entire day.Grumbling, she got up and hopped into some decent clothes. Then she saw it.<br />
<br />
Hanging from where her tight pussy was was a small penis, about 2 inches in length and completely circumsized. Below it were balls the size of a large marble. She almost fainted, falling back onto her bed.She became once again very tired, but also felt warm. Not too warm, but enough to lighten her clothing a bit. Just as she took her top off, the sight of her own nipples in the middle of her symmetrical  C-Cup tits made her feel... different. Her small dick started to harden in her panties, extending to 4 and a half inches long and about her thumb&#39;s width across. She didn&#39;t know what to do with it, so she just stared at it, fondling her nipples, and moving her hips up and down. Her breath began to grow deaper, and her thrusts acquired more force. She had felt orgasms before, with a female anatomy, and knowing what was approaching, she reached for some tissues and pushed them to the head of her dick, making every useless effort to push back what seemed to be the biggest orgasm of her life. Her balls drew themelves tighter to her body, the scrotum contracting to better <br />
deliver. &quot;No....&quot; she moaned, her voice much more high-pitched than before. &quot;I.... I don&#39;t.... want this....&quot; She could now barely breathe between all-encompassing orgasmic moans. This had all occured without ever having touched the new-found male genitalia.<br />
<br />
Involuntarily, her penis muscles made slight contractions, and beads of precum started dripping from the tip, as the tissues and the hand holding them had been refocused on nipple stimulation. Her nipples, too, were erect, and both her tits and dick visibly pusled with every heartbeat. It was going to happen, there was no denying it. Quickly, she stuffed her straight, brunette hair behind her to save for what could be a huge cleanup. Then out of nowhere, it happened. Despite the sensations she had been experiencing, the amount of cum wasn&#39;t what she was prepared for. Arching her back gracefully into the air, almost at a 70 degree angle, a tablespoon of hot cum jetted onto her chest in one thin spray, soon dripping onto the underside of her tits. She then passed out, overcome with euphoria, dick slowing softening with every passing heartbeat. <br />
<br />
It was all over in about 20 minutes, but it felt as if it had lasted for days. When she awoke again 5 hours later, she used her nails to scrape the dried cum off of her chest and breasts. She then carefully put on clothing, looking down as little as possible, as the last orgasm (though it felt wonderful) seemed to have been purely of auto-eroticism. <br />
<br />
It must have been the curse, she thought. &quot;That little shit gave me a little dick.&quot; Suddenly, she began to harden again. The memory of her previous episode was turning her on again. This time she was not as afraid, as she did not seem to have much volume. Hoping to gey it over with quickly, she pushed a hand into her pants and pulled out, with considerable effort, a much longer penis than before. It was now hanging flaccid 5 inches over the top of her pants, and her balls.... she gave them a squeeze. About the size of a golf ball, but she could feel blood pulsing through them as her dick began to orient itself with a hard-on of just over 7 inches. <br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn&#39;t help but drool on it. Sitting cross-legged on her bed with her balls resting lightly on the pink sheets, she slowly storked up and down the shaft with one hand and alternated between her tits and the head with her other hand. It felt even better, but more controlled. Soon she was dripping with precum, and was able to lubricate the entire dick with it, squeezing harder into the shaft. Unexpectedly, she felt as if she was cumming, but nothing came out. Her balls started contracting tighter than ever, than slowly lost feeling and went numb. Entranced, she continued, transfixing her gaze on her penis now worthy of being called a cock. Then her balls began to expand, pushing outward as if being inflated. Her cock muscles contracted violently, searching for cum that was not there. Her balls had now swollen to egg size, and continued to push until they were like flat tennis balls. &quot;Woe, that&#39;s huge!&quot; she gasped between breaths. &quot;Imagine how much cum&quot;-- Her dick would take no more. A jet of pure white jizz shot up towards the cieling, splattering itself and dripping down. In an effort to conceal the mess, Jennifer placed her palm over her dick as it tried to shoot over and over for what seemed like eternity. The massive amount of cum built up inside caused her meat to expand like her balls had done. First, she ballooned to almost three inches wide, then her erection lengthened to 13 inches, and her hand was no longer strong enough to hold back the wave of cum. She put her head back and released, covering her tits with ropes of cum. For four minutes straight she shot stream after stream of cum, first onto her breasts, then up to her face, and then to splatter against the wall, and it was unbelievable. When it was finally almost over, her shots down to a normal man&#39;s size, she laid back and covered the head again, hoping to prevent further stimulation.<br />
<br />
It did just the opposite.<br />
<br />
With both hands squeezing the massive head, she tried to hold back the seemingly endless cum and just couldn&#39;t. It dripped down her penis off of her hands, and cascaded over her huge balls like a smooth stony waterfall. Except this time something was different. Her dick was still soft. She held the dripping pole in her hand as she dashed in the bathroom, sat on the toilet and pointed it 180 degrees down, moaning loadly as she shot her load into the toilet. The toilet couldn&#39;t hold it. It began to over flow, at which she straightened it back out and aimed it towards the batb tub. Now it was 16 inches long and 2 around, but still floppy and soft. She shot gallon after gallon into the tu,  her balls now dipping down into the cum-filled toilet. She was nearing the end. She forced her penis between her tits, looked down, and covered her face with jizz, then tried to suck as much down as she could, but nearly choked in the process. Cum was running down the dick, covering her tits, hands, and legs, as well as puddling onto the floor. Her hair was full of it as well, and her face was almost completely caked with streaks of white. Then it stopped.<br />
<br />
She heard the doorbell ring.</p>
