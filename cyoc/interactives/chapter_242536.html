<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I come running into the central room, alerted by the scream I just heard. There, I find the whole group near the fourth door. Abigail seems to be the closest one, but she is holding her right hand with her left. It seems like she is in a sort of pain?<br />
<br />
Trevor: A-are you okay? Why did you scream?<br />
<br />
Abigail: Yeah... no I... This thing zapped me! I tried opening this god forsaken piece of shit, but I felt a jolt as I touched it!<br />
<br />
Hadley: Do you feel bad in any way? Are you okay?<br />
<br />
Abigail: Don&#39;t touch me! I&#39;m no cry baby!<br />
<br />
Revand: Abigail, being aggressive cannot help us right now. We are all in the same boat so please calm down.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Me? Calm down? How am I supposed to do that in that situation?! Don&#39;t any of you knows when to leave a girl alo- OW!<br />
<br />
Abigail suddenly took a step back, as if she had been punched in the stomach. She took a moment to balance herself, before raising her head again.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Okay. There is something wrong. I really don&#39;t feel good... I feel like I&#39;m going to pu-<br />
<br />
She holded her two hands in front of her mouth, her face pale and livid. Trevor and and Hadley rushed to her side as she crumbled onto her knees.<br />
<br />
Trevor: Oh my god... Are you okay? Where does it hurts? What do we do?<br />
<br />
Abigail: I don&#39;t know... I feel wrong... Help me...<br />
<br />
Her voice was weak, her whole body trembling. Her natural assurance was replaced by eyes wide of terror and pain. Everyone was either panicking, at her side, or in shock.<br />
<br />
Abigail: It&#39;s getting worse... Help me... Stop it... I don&#39;t... I...<br />
<br />
Hadley: Someone! Bring something please! I think I saw a room labeled as an infirmary back in the right wing! Go fast!<br />
<br />
Farim quickly did as told and rushed into the right door. Abigail stopped saying words and only whined and whimpered, each of her move sudden and uncertain. She had closed her eyes, pain overwhelming her at sight.<br />
<br />
Hadley: Hold it... here stay calm... breathe slowly... in and out... in and out... in and out...<br />
<br />
But suddenly, it&#39;s like time had stopped. No one was saying anything, we all watched in complete shock as she transformed. Her breath steadied soon after and she reopened her eyes.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Why are y&#39;all looking at me like that? Do I have something on my face?<br />
<br />
She reached an hand for her face, not sensing anything, until she ran it to the top of her head. There she touched it. One of her cat ears, real and working.<br />
<br />
Abigail: What the... What is...<br />
<br />
Her other hand reached for the ground, only to touch a spurt of fur. She jumped in surprise as she saw a long cat tail swirling behind her back in a rythmic motion. This was real... Tristan said the truth. This place is cursed with it&#39;s items. Ranging from anything to a simple door knob.<br />
<br />
Abigail: What the actual FUCK!<br />
<br />
She jumped to a standing position. Feeling her new appendages, touching them hesitantly and seeing them twitch and move.<br />
<br />
Abigail: There is, not a single possible way, I say not a single one, that this is real right? I&#39;m hallucinating! That knob had a needle in it or something! You don&#39;t see what I&#39;m seeing right?! RIGHT?!<br />
<br />
Trevor: I... I don&#39;t know how to say thi Abigail but... This looks pretty real to me.<br />
<br />
Abigail: ... This feels so weird... I can feel through my these ears! they have strange reflexes! And let&#39;s not talk about THIS!<br />
<br />
She twisted herself around to take a good look at her tail, it seemed to move on its own, swirling in a horizontal motion.<br />
<br />
Abigail: This is so... Hey can y&#39;all stop glancing like that! This creeps me out!<br />
<br />
I turn quickly on myself, not wanting to cause more discomfort than there already are for her. I think theres no more doubt now, the revange is a simple as this: we think we&#39;re safe, but without any warning, we could be changed. Into anything, from anything and with anything. I wonder what they could range to? Abigail just became a cat girl! Right in front of my eyes! And it looked painful...<br />
<br />
Abigail: Okay... I guess you can look back now... but I disoblige any comments!<br />
<br />
I and the other revolved back to our original position. I try not to stare too much at the newly changed girl.<br />
<br />
Revand: Okay... hum... change of plans gang. I have to say that I did not expect this to be a reality but... the proof are outstanding. This place indeed has the strange transformative features that Tristan has described. Being careful is now a our main goal here. Finding an exit stays a good thing to do, but please try not to interact with any useless objects. Whatever it might be...<br />
<br />
Trevor: So... What do we do now?<br />
<br />
Samilla: I still don&#39;t know what&#39;s behind that door!<br />
<br />
Abigail: I&#39;m not touching it EVER again.<br />
<br />
Revand: Yeah we... we understand that. But I guess that since our space is limited, it would be great to have an access to the room...<br />
<br />
Hadley: Here, let me try something.<br />
<br />
Hadley approached the door, and took out her shoe and her sock. Trevor looked away nervously and Revand seems to flush a little. Farim arrived back in the room with a medkit in hand, widening their eyes slightly at the sight of Abigail&#39;s new form, before placing down the now useless first aid. Hadley gloved her hand with the her sock, and slowly reached for the knob. After a little hesitation, she took it, and turned it.<br />
<br />
Revand: I see... *Gulp* Very ingenious indeed...<br />
<br />
Hadley: Thank you! Oh and before anyone forget about it, let&#39;s let that door open okay? We don&#39;t want any incidents to happen...<br />
<br />
Abigail: That is a great idea!<br />
<br />
I took a peek in the newly showed room from afar. All there was is a strange disheveled and messy room, full of objects of all sorts.<br />
<br />
Revand: This seems to be a storage room... Not very useful, but maybe an object in there could be of use at some point.<br />
<br />
Abigail: I really got that for this!? I swear to go-<br />
<br />
Her tail has slapped her in a sudden motion.<br />
<br />
Abigail: Argh! That thing is uncontrollable!<br />
<br />
In the room though, I spotted something, a small clock. Kind of strangely, it showed a full twenty-four hour cycle in contrary of the usual twelve. I don&#39;t know why, but it apealed to me. I obviously am not going to take it, but it&#39;s so beautiful... The time it indicates is 22:45 Pm. Was it really that late? My eyes did seems to fall tired... Hadley seems to have spotted my exhaustion, as she headed towards me and started to speak.<br />
<br />
Hadley: Well... in any case, we should maybe try to get a good night of sleep! Or maybe a day of sleep since it&#39;s hard to tell right now... But we won&#39;t be able to do anything with our mind hazed by the lack of slumber don&#39;t you all agree? <br />
<br />
Revand: I guess that you&#39;re right... This has been a fairly long day... For some more eventful than others. We should try to accustom ourself to our dorms and all... If nobody oppose to it, I propose to meet up in the kitchen for tomorrow, planning everything from there would be easier. Also... Hum... I don&#39;t really know how to say this, but you may try to touch the least things possible... and if you do touch something, could you note if it changed you or not? And what does it change? Maybe if we manage to identify all of the transformative items, we may be able to stay safe.<br />
<br />
Everyone seemed to agree with his words, and made their way to their room. I approached my dorm door, and almost touch the knob. Before remembering that everything here could change me. I pulled out one of my socks, the same way that Hadley did, and opened my door with the protection of my clothing. I found myself in a mostly cozy looking room. A bed to the right, a small library to the left, and a large amount of curtains flowing the walls, cushion on the ground and carpets all over... This seemed like my dream room, small, efficient, and cuddly... Even the colors were exactly what I could&#39;ve hoped for, a soothing dark green sometimes gradiating into a calming light blue. But the fear is still present in my mind... I can&#39;t trust any of this... Even the bed...<br />
<br />
I managed to find myself a corner in the room without any objects, and cuddled myself on the cold ground... This is not comfortable, but at least it&#39;s safe... I turned on my back many times, before finally, everything fadded into my slumber...</p>
