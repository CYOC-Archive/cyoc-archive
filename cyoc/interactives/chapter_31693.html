<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Terra took another small gold bead and walked back over to her mirror. 'So', she thought to herself, 'this is me at age 14...I wonder what it'll be like to grow up...' She took one more look at herself, then put the second bead on the bracelet. Instantly, she noticed changes. Her small A cup breasts had swelled into full As and her nipples had grown even larger. Terra reached up to caress her breasts and was surprised at how sensitive they were. Just this morning she'd thought she'd never grow fast enough, and now she had breasts that were large enough for her to cup in her hands! The rest of her body changed even more dramatically. Terra was slim even for a 13 year old and she was jealous of her friends who had already started developing curves. She looked down and noticed her legs were longer and shaplier and she now had a defined waist. Her slim hips had grown wider and her ass had swelled enough to give her a more womanly shape. She also had hair between her legs, which she wasn't entirely sure she liked. It was thin and only around the lips of her vagina. Excited, Terra grabbed another bead and added it to the bracelet. <br />
<br />
This time, the room took a noticable jump as she grew. Terra looked at her 16 year old self with approval and began counting her new changes. She had thought that she was shapely at 15, but the hips and waist she had now made her 15 year old body look small and girlish. Her slim body had started to fill out, but hadn't completely lost all of her girlish figure. She turned around to look at her ass and saw that it was definately bigger, but was glad it hadn't gotten too big. The thin amount of hair between her legs had become a vee and had also thickened noticeably. Her full A cup breasts that had excited her just a few minutes ago had grown into a pair of full, large B-cups with large pink nipples that hardened when she touched them. She also noticed that her torso had gotten noticeably longer and wider to accomadate her new breasts, and she thought it felt very nice to run her hands down her sides from under her arms, down her breasts, over her waist and hips, and down to carress her ass. Terra's hair was also longer and more wavy than it was as a 13 year old. She'd been so preoccupied with her body that she hadn't noticed her face before this point. All her baby fat had disappeared and her face looked more defined and womanly. <br />
<br />
Terra still had 2 beads left so she added another one to her bracelet. This time, the room didn't jump so much, but she definately felt a change in her body. Terra's 17 year old body was still slim with nice curves and a defined waist, and her hips and ass had yet to grow enough to give her the womanly lines she wanted. Her breasts had continued their steady growth into somewhere between a well filled B and a small C cup, and they were still mostly round and high on her chest. Terra liked having actual cleavage, especially since her breasts were firm and didn't sag or jiggle a lot. Her torso had grown to fit the rest of her again, and she was curious how much she'd grown. Terra walked over to where she had gotten undressed and picked up her shirt. &quot;Oh my god, am I really this small?&quot; she said as she held the shirt up to herself. Her panties were also far too small from her new point of view and she wondered how she would ever get as big as she was now. <br />
<br />
&quot;One left,&quot; Terra said as she stood in front of her mirror again. She added the bead to the bracelet and watched as she grew to 18. Terra's body lost any trace of her girlish figure and she now saw a well proportioned woman staring back at her from the mirror. Her breasts had become large and firm, but still soft to her touch. They had grown to full C cups and had lost some of their girlish bounce, hanging down a little on her chest. Her hips and ass had swelled a lot from their 17 year old state and Terra was excited that she finally had the curves she wanted. Her arms and legs were shapely and well defined, and she noticed that her torso had acquired a definate slope inwards to her waist before blooming out into her hips and ass. She kept running her hands over her body, exploring every part of it, and she discovered her nipples were still sensitive and gave her pleasure when she touched them. Terra ran her fingers through her generous cleavage and cupped her breasts in her hands as she gave a small moan of pleasure. Her fingers also found the lips of her matured vagina, which felt much warmer than it should to her. Terra kept rubbing herself and before she knew it was on her knees masturbating again. She plunged her fingers inside her vagina, deeper than she ever thought she'd be able to go and let out more moans as she went at it faster and faster. Terra was still horny after she came, so she got the gender symboled ring again and put it on. Standing in front of her mirror she grinned and turned the knob on the ring.</p>
