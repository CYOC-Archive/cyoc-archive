<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alan felt sick to his stomach even imagining being part of his family after what his dad did. He knew his dad didn&#39;t mean it, but Alan had just been through too much in such a short amount of time to try and forgive him right now. He stood in the driveway for a moment, lost about what to do, before it finally hit him. He didn&#39;t want to be in his family, so he wouldn&#39;t. He&#39;d became an older version of himself, and be the head of his own damn family.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t inadvertently abuse or control my children with magic or be so stupid as to hurt anyone. I&#39;m running away in the most efficient way I can.&quot; He thought as he gripped the band.<br />
<br />
His only desire was to be in his own family, far away from his current one as light began to shine and all his surroundings changed. He felt a little nauseous as reality strained to change the world in a massive way. Finally, the world stopped spinning and Alan found himself sitting on the side of a massive bed. <br />
<br />
He glanced around, and found that it wasn&#39;t anywhere he knew. It looked a little like an adult couple&#39;s room, with dresses and suits in the closet, makeup on the desk, and golf clubs leaning against a massive drawer. Alan&#39;s heart sank a little as he began to worry. He started to wonder if he had merely changed his family instead of leaving. He rushed over to a mirror he saw hanging on the wall, and his jaw dropped in surprise.<br />
<br />
He still looked like himself, but much older. He was probably older than Janet or Steve. Not only did he seem older, but he also looked a little different in other ways. His hair was more of a black than a brown while his skin was much tanner. Although he was definitely still himself, it looked as if he had Italian ancestry instead of Irish. He felt relief knowing he was no longer genetically related to his father, but also some worries that he may have acted too hasty. However, all his fears were put aside once she walked in.<br />
<br />
It was a beautiful Asian woman, with medium perky breasts, a massive fat ass, dark black hair down to her ass, and a beautiful face to frame it all.  Alan had always had a thing for asian women, so he nearly jumped for joy when she greeted him with a &quot;hi honey&quot; as she grabbed a magazine from off of the desk. Accessing his new life&#39;s memories, he remembered that this was infant his wife Naomi.<br />
<br />
He followed behind her downstairs and found the house of a rich person. From the furniture to the paint, the entire house was high end and high maintenance. His new wife walked out towards the back door, where Alan saw that the entire backyard not only massive, but had a massive pool as well! His wife took off her short to reveal a bikini she had been wearing underneath, and proceeded to walk outside to lounge around in the sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dad.&quot; A gentle voice echoed behind him.<br />
<br />
Alan turned around and was face to face with a cute little half asian girl. She looked around 18 or 19, with bigger breasts than her mother, but a smaller ass. She was wearing a one piece and had her curly black hair tied up in a bun. She smiled as she walked by to join her mother out by the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mom!&quot; She greeted as she sat next to her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Samantha.&quot; She replied, not looking up from her magazine.<br />
<br />
Alan&#39;s mouth was still gawked open as another person zoomed past him. Alan barely had time to register a &quot;Hi Dad!&quot; before a boy around 11 jumped into the pool, causing a huge splash that Samantha did not enjoy.<br />
&quot;Brandon you little twerp!&quot; She yelled as she wiped the water from her mom&#39;s magazines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what&#39;s the point of a pool if you ain&#39;t gonna use it?&quot; He laughed while backs stroking.<br />
<br />
It was all so much to take in. Alan was part of a new family, and he loved it. He could feel himself easily letting go of his old family as he fell in love with the new one. Right there and then he vowed to never again use magic, as it would only ever be a hindrance on his new life. Just as he thought this, one final voice spoke up behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, are you alright?&quot; A woman asked.<br />
<br />
Alan turned to see a 20 something year old redhead in a cleaning lady uniform. Alan activated his ability to remember this new reality, and suddenly recalled that this was the family maid Debbie. Debbie was very poor, so she worked almost full time for the family, even living in a not so large guest room. She obeyed every request to a tee and the family loved having her around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here.&quot; Alan said, handing her the notebook and bracelet. &quot;I want you to take these two things and hide them. Bury them, put them in the attic, I don&#39;t care, just keep them from sight and mind.&quot; He ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay sir.&quot; She replied confused as she walked off.<br />
<br />
He wondered if doing so was a good idea, as someone could potentially find them one day, but he figured it didn&#39;t matter. After all, only he was aware of any changes that were to happen, so it&#39;s not like he wouldn&#39;t notice. Plus, judging by the climate, he was in a totally different state, so the odds of his old life finding him were slim at best. He threw the doubt from his mind as he grabbed a pair of swim trunks and joined his family by the pool.</p>
<hr/><h3>
So, what happens to the bracelet and notebook?</h3>
