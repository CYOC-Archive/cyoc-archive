<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lee put his hands behind his head and pushed his chest forward as he crooned “go ahead, baby.”  The buxom blonde reached forward to caress his mighty pecs.  He noticed that she had to reach up a little to get to them, despite her standing tall for a woman at 5'10”.  She began stroking his rock-like pecs with both hands, and he made them bounce, both in sequence.  “Ohh, you're so strong!”  “Does that make you horny, baby?”  “ohh,” she moaned, “yeah.”  <br />
<br />
Lee reached one of giant arms around her and pulled her close.  Her tits pressed against his 8-pack abs, and her midsection against his thickening cock.  “Oh my god, is that you?”  She pulled away, and traced the outline of the python stretching down his pants leg.  “Oh god, I have to see it!”  “Go ahead, baby.”  She hastily undid his fly and yanked down his pants, and then began pulling boxer briefs down, and down, and down, until his cock was free, sticking proudly straight out in front of him, but rising as it continued to grow.  Her eyes opened wide “You're, you're huge!”  “I know.”  “Oh my god, you're erect!”<br />
<br />
That last didn't sound like the blonde.  Lee came back to reality and realized that his roommate had walked in on him in the shower.  Again.  Lee hastily turned towards the wall.  “I thought I told you to knock, Charlie.”  <br />
<br />
“Oh come on, no need to be shy.  It's not like you have much to hide.”  Charlie was an asshole.  “You have nothing to be ashamed of – it looks like we're about the same size.”  Lee automatically looked down at Charlie's dick, just in time to start him start peeing.  He quickly looked away.  <br />
<br />
“Charlie that's disgusting.  I don't want to watch you pee.  Get out.”<br />
<br />
“Oh come on, it won't be long.”  <br />
<br />
Lee gritted his teeth and waited for the sound of Charlie's pissing to stop.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally.  “Alright, now-” sploosh.  “Are you-” sploosh.  “Can you pl-” sploosh.  Charlie was fucking with him.  He stopped taking the bait.  After a few more seconds, Charlie said “alright, the weasel has been drained.  Thanks for being accommodating, mini-me,” and finally left.<br />
<br />
Charlie was an asshole.  And not a very funny one.  Lee was still getting over that “same size” jab.  Their dicks were about the same size -  four inches.  When Charlie was flaccid and Lee was fully erect.  When Lee was flaccid he was only two inches, and he knew (along with half the campus) that Charlie erect was eight thick inches, so in any fair comparison he was only half Charlie's size.  Except, as Charlie was wont to point out, since he was half as long and half as thick, that was really only a quarter of the size.  Lee realized that in fact he was half Charlie's size in all three spatial dimensions and thus only one eighth of his volume, but he wasn't about to point that out to Charlie.  <br />
<br />
Lee was nothing like he had imagined himself in his now-ruined fantasy.  In addition to his strikingly not-large penis, he was short at 5'6” and in danger of becoming a literal 98-pound weakling if he lost a few pounds.  He didn't even seriously consider trying to get a girlfriend.  Unlike Charlie, who was with a girl two nights out of three.  He had no trouble, at six feet tall and two hundred pounds of lean muscle.  Lee didn't even resent Charlie for that – or at least, he tried not to – he just wished that Charlie would spend more of the nights in his bimbos' rooms, rather than 'sexiling' Lee from his.<br />
<br />
Other than the differences in dimensions, Lee and Charlie looked similar; they had the same brown hair and blue eyes, and people sometimes mistook them for brothers – usually assuming an age difference of three or four years, despite the fact that they were both nineteen.  The only consolation Lee had was that he was way smarter than Charlie, but that was cold comfort since it only exemplified how the society he lived in was not a meritocracy.  <br />
<br />
Lee sighed.  There was no way he was going to finish his fantasy in this mood.  Reluctantly, he turned off the water and stepped out of the shower to towel off.  That didn't take very long, because there wasn't much to towel.  He wrapped the towel around his waist and left the bathroom they shared with the adjoining double.  <br />
<br />
“Hey, Lee.”<br />
<br />
“Can it wait until I'm dressed, Charlie?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah yeah, sure thing no problem.”  Charlie was being nice to him – what Charlie considered nice.  Which meant he probably wanted a favor.  Lee hoped he wouldn't have to explain the dot product to him, again.  But Lee got dressed, pulling on a pair of khakis to hide his scrawny legs, despite the fact that it was warm enough for shorts again.  Moments after he pulled a T-shirt over his head, Charlie was speaking.  “So how'd you like to have some fun?”<br />
<br />
Lee grimaced.  “What's in it for me?”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean? Fun is fun.”  Lee stared at Charlie, and blinked twice, slowly.  “Oh all right.  If you help me out, I promise not to walk in on you in the shower again.  For two weeks.”<br />
<br />
Lee sighed.  “What would you have me doing?”<br />
<br />
“I want to break into Old Man Morris's.  Sam dared me to.”  Sam was one of Charlie's teammates on the school baseball team.  Or maybe he meant the Samantha he'd screwed last weekend.  It didn't really matter.<br />
<br />
“And I would be along why, to kick down doors?”<br />
<br />
“What?  No man, you're way too small for that,” he said, completely missing the dry sarcasm.  “There's a funny lock on the gate – I think it's some kind of logic puzzle.  I was hoping you could solve it.”</p>
