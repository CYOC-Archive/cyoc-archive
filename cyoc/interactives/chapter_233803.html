<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy thought about how unfair it was that Tristan brought home all these girls who fawned over him. They barely knew him. Tristan coasted on his looks and his mesomorph beach body. He had abs, as well as model looks. Tristan&#39;s feathery brow hair, soft bedroom eyes and &quot;bro voice&quot; which dripped in arrogance always made Andy look like chopped liver in comparison. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, man,&quot; Tristan had told him just a few weeks ago. &quot;I&#39;m bringing Sarah over and we are gonna POUND. IT. OUT. You know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;? Can you uh, make yourself scarce tonight? I really wanna show her a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know you can&#39;t understand but girls are where it&#39;s at, man! You should try it sometime!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Try to get with a girl?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever been with a girl, bro? Have you even tried? Seriously, you should at least try it at least once.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean you&#39;re gonna try to get with a guy at least once?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, that&#39;s sick. I&#39;m just trying to HELP you, man. No need to be gross and shit.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tristan had stormed out but it had stayed in Andy&#39;s mind ever since. <br />
<br />
His other wishes were still in progress. He had programmed himself to be more oriented toward self-improvement and success. He woke up one morning and discovered he was no longer a gamer. He didn&#39;t mind. He had no time for silly video games. He also discovered that he was no longer a liberal arts major. The book had interpreted his request and he was now majoring in international business and finance. It all came naturally to him, he thought. He had cryptocurrency accounts and had made a small fortune off of the meager income he&#39;d saved up from his minimum wage jobs in high school. He had a notebook full of ideas for businesses he could create and strategized how to market them worldwide. <br />
<br />
Was he getting too far away from who he originally was, he wondered, and then as he stroked his package and gave it a firm shake to make sure it was real, he decided he didn&#39;t care. He was who he was deep down inside. Maybe deep down inside he was deeply unsatisfied with being a gay gamer nerd. <br />
<br />
There was a lot he had not yet experienced in the gay world. He had only had one boyfriend in high school and that had been a disaster. He had dated a guy whose parents didn&#39;t know and he didn&#39;t want to be out and he spread rumors about Andy being a fag that was in love with him when people noticed them together, and he dumped Andy rather than face any possible scrutiny for being gay. It had shattered him for a while. He had girlfriends that consoled him but deep down inside, he wished he could know what it was like to have plenty of guys to choose from. He envied the girls because they had their pick out of hundreds of hot, straight, good looking studs. Online dating had produced some disgusting perverts; fat old men that wanted to get together with him and just about no one else. <br />
<br />
But that was the old Andy. The new Andy could be anyone. He wasn&#39;t bad looking but he didn&#39;t stand out, either. But now he had a secret weapon. He had only worked out a few times a month at the university gym. It was a world class gym and he had not taken advantage of it at all. He decided to give it his all. He could have cheated and used the book but he thought it would be better to try it the old-fashioned way first. He wanted to see just how hard it was for him to gain muscle. He had been told that it was going to be harder for him because he was an ectomorph, which meant he was naturally skinny. His new height emphasized this aspect, but his new secret weapon was omnipresent, always slapping his legs as he walked across campus. <br />
<br />
His walk had changed. It wasn&#39;t the book changing his personality, it was the sheer thrill of having a cock that was as wide as his forearm! He had compared them in wide-eyed wonder that morning. He felt good about himself for maybe the first time since he was a little kid and he got straight A&#39;s in 2nd grade, before all the bullying started over him being &quot;too girly&quot;. <br />
<br />
His hair was dark but his skin was very light, and he had almost no facial hair. He had a simple appearance. His hair was just dull and ordinary. Nothing special. His eyes had a slight twinkle to them and his chin was not that strong, rather somewhat delicate. Freckles on his cheeks that gave him a rather boyish appearance. He took note of these, his lifelong facial features, as he stared into the locker room mirror. <br />
<br />
I can change anything about myself, he thought. I&#39;m six feet tall now. I&#39;m taller than Tristan. What does he have that I don&#39;t have? I know his dick isn&#39;t as big as mine. <br />
<br />
As he was changing, he left his underwear on, but a few guys caught a glance as his cockhead, which was sticking out by a few inches. He pretended he didn&#39;t notice this and he proceeded as normal after changing into his gym clothes. <br />
<br />
His workout proved that exercise was not his strength. Everything was difficult, and he was definitely feeling the burn. He had researched routines on Youtube, and he&#39;d written down notes. It was very hard. At this rate, it would take years before he saw any real progress, he thought. <br />
<br />
The BIG moment came when he revealed himself in the showers. Again, he pretended not to notice other men nearby as he swung his footlong junk around, whipping it back and forth as he soaped up his body and made sure that they could see him in his full glory. He felt absolutely no shame. He smiled. This felt so good, he thought. I&#39;m easily the biggest guy here. It was very difficult with his new libido not to jack off right there, but a little precum leaked out and he was rock hard after the adrenaline rush. His big manmeat was at full mast to the point where it was nearly embarrassing, though he didn&#39;t even have to touch his member for it to be pointing out as if to tell him that he needed to fuck someone badly, like some kind of genital compass pointing to all the hot guys in the showers as he swung around, suds flying off his dick as he swung. <br />
<br />
His walk home had changed even more than before and he realized that it was because his steps were filled with confidence. Everywhere he went, it felt like...he deserved to be there. And he deserved attention. He greeted people a lot more often, and with a big smile on his face. He was becoming friendlier, and it was becoming easier for him to interact with others as he waved and nodded to people he recognized. Some of whom stared at each other briefly, trying to remember who this cute, six foot tall freshman was. <br />
<br />
Andy was starting to realize that even without the looks he had always wanted, it was possible to get somewhere just with confidence alone. He thought of all the girls in all his classes. None of them appealed to him sexually. But he was lonely. <br />
<br />
He had a few options, he thought, as he sat in the quad, observing his fellow students. He could change someone else, make him gay. He could change the world so that more men in general were gay. However, he wanted to be liked for now based on his current looks. He had been rejected by the three guys on campus that were gay for being too much of a loser, he supposed. Too plain, too ordinary, too short. Well, he was taller than average now. And quite frankly, he wanted to get into Tristan&#39;s head. Tristan was so full of himself. It made his blood boil. Tristan had never reached out to be his friend. He&#39;d been passive aggressive from the start. Tristan always dismissed Andy and never invited him to hang out with him and his friends when he visited other dorm rooms. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am now bisexual,&quot; he wrote in the book. &quot;And many people will talk about my giant dick over the next few days until almost everyone in the school knows I&#39;m packing.&quot; <br />
<br />
It satisfied him that he didn&#39;t have to change everything at once. It was going to be incremental. He realized that he was physically the same, but that his libido. He desperately needed to jack off. Walking past the various groups of girls and guys, he looked in awe at the girls with big boobs, and he caught himself before they saw him staring. &quot;Oh my GOD,&quot; he thought. He thought of how badly he still wanted to have sex with Tristan, but...it was like wearing glasses for the first time after his vision had been blurry. Girls were jumping out at him left and right. Brunettes! Blondes! Redheads! Asian chicks! With their cute little outfits. All of them shorter than him. He wanted to just pick them up and carry them in his arms. He could feel his thick banana welling up and straining against his pants. <br />
<br />
He hurried into the nearest public restroom, near the history and sociology departments. He felt like he was going to cream his pants! Sighing in the bathroom stall with relief, he thought about all the girls he&#39;d ever gone to school with, mainly the ones in high school that were nice to him, knowing he couldn&#39;t reciprocate any attraction, and all the hot girls who kept themselves trim. Fat girls didn&#39;t really appeal to him, just as fat guys didn&#39;t. He couldn&#39;t stop to think about whether or not that was fair, he was about to fucking erupt like a volcano! He took off his denim jacket and bit down onto it. <br />
<br />
He creamed into the toilet. It was like pouring out one of those tiny little milk cartons that they gave you in the cafeteria. The 4 oz. kind. As it pumped out of his man cock: plop, plop, plop, plop, plop! He realized by estimation it had to be a load between 4 oz and 6 oz. He wanted to scream. It was like nothing he&#39;d ever experienced. It was an overwhelming rush. He felt so powerful. The scent of cum hit him suddenly and he, rather disorientated, wiped the bowl rim clean of some extra splooge, and then flushed. <br />
<br />
He laid low for a few days, noticing that people were staring at him every now and then, and he wasn&#39;t used to being stared at. He was used to being overlooked. Groups of both men and women whispered about him as he walked by them. He knew what it was about. He had been going to the gym every day and making the same show in front of as many guys as he could. He wanted them to talk about how big and unreal his cock was, all twelve inches of incredible manhood that just jutted out of his rather ordinary twinkish frame. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d also been making eye contact with girls more, giving them smiles he&#39;d never given to them. With guys, he had to be cautious. He couldn&#39;t just smile at a straight man with a stare that said &quot;I want to fuck you&quot; while oogling him. There were too many homophobic jocks on campus for him to risk that. But there was a freedom with the attraction to women in that most of them could statistically be reliably attracted to men enough so that they could flirtatiously smile back and many of them were. <br />
<br />
He decided the following weekend to approach a few girls and ask them out. The first was Audrey, who said no because she was going out with someone, and she asked him &quot;Aren&#39;t you gay?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I think I&#39;m bisexual, actually.&quot; <br />
<br />
He told this, rather carefully to a few girls, one of whom was Danielle. Danielle was Christian and very interested in his story. She asked him to sit down with her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just...don&#39;t want to offend you,&quot; she began. &quot;Have you ever been attracted to women before?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I...only have started to recently become attracted to women. I also have a little bit more confidence now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And before, when you didn&#39;t have as much confidence, you were only attracted to men.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I know that sounds strange. Other girls are looking at me like I&#39;m a weirdo now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No! I think it&#39;s fascinating. So, you&#39;ve never been with a girl before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;m 18 and I&#39;ve never been with a girl.&quot; And Danielle smiled at that as if it was a secret challenge. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still attracted to guys?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I am, but I really just want to give it a shot, you know?&quot; They both laughed. &quot;I mean. I don&#39;t have any expectations, but lately, it&#39;s all I can think about.&quot; Danielle told him her theory that it was possible for gay men to convert to straight lifestyles with enough encouragement and nurturing. She said she wanted to try it with him. Andy, overwhelmed with his new sexual attraction, could only stare dumbly at her perfect plump lips, wavy blond hair and breasts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t we go out tomorrow? We can go grab some pizza down the street,&quot; Danielle told him. &quot;Pick me up at 8 sharp.&quot; <br />
<br />
Later that night, he asked Tristan to talk. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m gonna try...something new,&quot; he told the shorter stud. &quot;I uh...I think I&#39;m gonna try girls to see what it&#39;s like. You know, I met this girl and we started talking and I&#39;d like to invite her back here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well SHIT, dude! You are full of fucking surprises this week, dude! DUDE. Yeah. Fucking go for it, bro! It&#39;s like I always was telling you, girls are where it&#39;s at, bro!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I thought a LOT about what you said before and I decided that maybe you were onto something.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My work here is done!&quot; Tristan put his arms up as if he&#39;d just won a trophy. &quot;No need to thank me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I really should thank you. I was thinking about what you said for a few weeks. I thought, why not just try it out? So uh, I&#39;ll need the place to myself one of these nights if Danielle wants to uh, come back here for some privacy...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Say no more, brother! Dude, what are bros for? Of course. Just tell me when.&quot; <br />
<br />
He told Tristan about his first date and Tristan made him promise to tell him everything when he got back. <br />
<br />
Picking up Danielle, Andy realized he was actually nervous. He had never been &quot;the man&quot; in the date before. He had always felt like the inadequate lesser male on previous dates with guys. Danielle was wearing a very fetching but modest white dress that showed off her cleavage, which made Andy sweat a bit. Over dinner, they talked about school and Danielle was impressed that Andy had so many business ideas. <br />
<br />
&quot;I had no idea you were so brilliant.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well. Thank you. Thank you very much.&quot; Somehow, her hand was on his. The next thing he knew, they were standing in the parking lot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um. Do you want to...?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I please kiss you?&quot; he blurted out. &quot;I just wasn&#39;t sure if I could.&quot; She giggled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that would be alright.&quot; <br />
<br />
He kissed her deeply, passionately, grabbed her and swung her down, and she came away with a shocked look on her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! That was...wow! You are really good at this! This is your FIRST time kissing a girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No. No no no. I just am thinking maybe this was a self-esteem thing because you are really working it right now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um. What...should be do now? I mean...would you like to go out again?&quot; <br />
<br />
When he got home, a group of Tristan&#39;s friends were there and he told them he made out with Danielle and they all hooted and hollered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah! Comin&#39; over to the straight side, son! That&#39;s right! Danielle is hot as fuck, bro!&quot; Tristan gave him a beer, something that he&#39;d never offered before. They three bros gave him advice on women and he nodded respectfully. <br />
<br />
That night, he wrote in the book: <br />
<br />
&quot;Tristan will have less and less confidence with women as the week goes on. He will have much less self-esteem than he used to. This is because he&#39;s going to suddenly have a drastic personality change where he feels much weaker than other men. His muscles will also start to shrink until it looks like he has never worked out. This process will take a month, and he will avoid the gym entirely from now on. He will stutter and get very shy around women and often not be able to even be in the presence of women, preferring to be alone. No one will pay attention to any of these changes. Everyone will consider this normal behavior for Tristan and their memories will reflect this.&quot; <br />
<br />
A few nights later, he brought Danielle back to the dorm. Tristan had vacated the premises. She gave him permission to try to get aroused with her and admitted she had heard rumors about his male anatomy. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...pretty big,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I haven&#39;t really ever had sex before, I mean being a top. It&#39;s...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you...show me?&quot;  <br />
<br />
She was shocked but determined to bring Andy over to the straight side. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOOOOOOOOD!&quot; She screamed so loud she woke up half the dormitory. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, that was amazing. That was...incredible. You&#39;re SO HUGE! I&#39;ve never had it that big before.&quot; <br />
<br />
Danielle admitted that part of the reason she wanted to experiment with Andy was because of his enormous dick, but admitted that she wasn&#39;t ready to take a dick that size on a regular basis and hoped he wouldn&#39;t be crushed. Amazingly, Andy felt like it was going to be okay. They cuddled and when Tristan came home, Andy started bragging about banging the Christian blond hottie with his fuckstick. He went into graphic details. Tristan nodded as if he was overwhelmed by the thought of being with a woman. <br />
<br />
&quot;So anyway, we&#39;re just gonna be friends but I figure there&#39;s plenty of fish in the sea, you know what I&#39;m saying?&quot; Andy mused. He felt so confident and it felt natural to be confident. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah. Of course,&quot; Tristan said, at a loss for words. Hearing about Andy&#39;s conquest with his giant dick would have made him happy for Andy before. He celebrated his friends&#39; conquests because he had never felt inadequate before about his 7 incher. He had always been a prize specimen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone will forget I was ever gay. I&#39;m still bisexual but everyone will think I&#39;m 100% straight.&quot; Andy wrote in his book that night. And everyone treated Andy like he&#39;d always been a straight bro after that. <br />
<br />
Tristan looked at himself in the bathroom mirror. He began to pick apart small details, flaws in his appearance and body. He suddenly wanted to hide from everyone and run away and be by himself. His outgoing extroverted personality was gone and he had no idea why. He began to avoid his bro friends and made excuses why he couldn&#39;t hang out. <br />
<br />
Andy, on the other hand, invited all of Tristan&#39;s bros over to watch football and beer and to make things more enjoyable for himself, told the book that he was now able to enjoy sports and get excited about one team over another. <br />
<br />
Andy&#39;s height grew at the same time, inching upwards as six week passed from his initial discovery of the book. 6&#39;1&quot;...6&#39;2&quot;...6&#39;3&quot;. Andy was glad he went the slow route. It was nice to get compliments from people that noticed how he was growing. <br />
<br />
As he was screaming with his new bros about his new favorite team winning, Tristan came in and went straight to his room to study. He didn&#39;t even say hello when they all said hello to him. The bros ignored him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, that little dude you&#39;re roommates with is kind of weird,&#39; they all agreed one night. Andy smiled. <br />
<br />
He wrote in his book that night: <br />
<br />
&quot;My dormmate Tristan is now 5&#39;5&quot; and his weight is proportionate to this height. He is frail and weak and he is beginning to form an attraction to men. He will become bisexual slowly, progressing on the Kinsey scale from straight to gay over the next month. His dick will also shrink to 5 inches. He will not say anything to anyone about these changes. He will just keep them to himself. Only Tristan will remember his former height. Everyone else will remember him as being a short little man.&quot;<br />
<br />
The next night, Tristan woke up in the morning to find that everything was slightly...off. The bed looked bigger. Everything was taller. He had been 5&#39;9&quot; and now...he had shrunk. He learned with horror that everything in the bathroom, kitchen and living room corresponded to this fact. He couldn&#39;t reach up to the kitchen cabinets. He noticed a stool that the school had provided him with so he could climb up and open them. He  <br />
<br />
He began to bring girls home more frequently and started banging them without warning. As word spread about his giant cock, all the girls at school wanted a piece of him. He suddenly became very popular and Tristan&#39;s popularity fell. Tristan started to wear baggy clothes. He was freaking out over losing all his muscle mass week by week. Sometimes he even cried himself to sleep. He didn&#39;t know what was wrong with him. He would jerk off in the bathroom when he could, but he felt so lousy about the loss of his muscular frame that it was difficult. Especially knowing how girls tried to talk to him sometimes, but he couldn&#39;t even face him. They thought he was cute, too. But pretty soon, within a month, he had lost 40 pounds of muscle and now he resembled a really cute twink. <br />
<br />
Rumors began to spread that he was gay, fueling a crash in his self-esteem even more. <br />
<br />
The first night Andy brought a babe home without any warning, they were both drunk and laughing. He looked at his roommate, who was sitting on the living room couch studying, and told him &quot;Hey, don&#39;t come a knocking cause we&#39;re...gonna be rocking!&quot; The babe thought that was really funny. &quot;Oh, this is Martina. Martina, this is Tristan. Oh, where we going? Where we going? We going to my bedroom? Hahahaha!&quot; <br />
<br />
He fucked Martina while Tristan was trying to study. Tristan tried to concentrate but all he could hear was: <br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD, YOU&#39;RE HUGE! YOU&#39;RE SUCH A STUD! OH MY GOD! OH YES! YES! YES! YES! OH YES!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;YEAH YOU LIKE THAT? YOU LIKE THAT, BABY? FUCK YEAH, I&#39;M ALL MAN!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU&#39;RE ALL MAN! OH FUCK ME, ANDY! FUCK ME! FUCK ME, ANDY!!! OOHHHHHHHHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
It became pretty common for the dormitory to listen in on Andy&#39;s conquests. It was impossible not to overhear them. Every conquest made Tristan feel smaller and more unimportant. <br />
<br />
This became a routine for several weeks as Andy experienced the rush of being a popular, tall young man whose ordinary looks were suddenly becoming much more interesting to everyone with his new confidence boost, and with the biggest dick on campus. It didn&#39;t hurt that he was no longer being overshadowed by Tristan, and that he was the one doing the overshadowing. <br />
<br />
Tristan&#39;s bros had become Andy&#39;s bros. They got together at his place pretty frequently. He was a very popular guy now. One day, Tristan walked in looking at the ground and put his bag down so he could shuffle across the floor and get a bowl of cereal. One of the bros, Felix, spoke up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, dude, I just gotta ask you. Are you a fag? It&#39;s okay if you are.&quot; The other bros laughed. Even Andy laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, guys. Leave the little guy alone.&quot; Andy smiled, drinking his beer. It felt good to be the cool roommate. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m not gay, guys. Just...leave me alone, okay?&quot; Tristan said, his sexual attraction starting to become apparent to him now. The smell of bro testosterone, armpits and beer wafted into his nostrils making him horny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude you look gay, no offense. You never stick around when there&#39;s a woman here.&quot; Steve said. Steve and Felix were both very muscular and towered over little Tristan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, even your name is kind of gay,&quot; said Dave. All of the bros spit out their beer from laughing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on, Tristan isn&#39;t gay. Are you, Tristan?&quot; Andy said, suddenly towering over his former straight roommate. He put a hand on Tristan&#39;s head. Tristan had to look way UP at Andy now. Andy was now 6&#39;3&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;No. No, I&#39;m not gay. Girls just...it&#39;s hard for me to talk to them. I&#39;m not as big and strong and tall like you guys are. I just don&#39;t know what to say to women.&quot; He felt humiliated having to say these words out loud. For some reason, he couldn&#39;t tell people that he remembered being a taller, hot jock with rippling muscles. He had been on the soccer team and baseball team and now he was a computer science major instead of business. He was a nerd! How had this happened! Why couldn&#39;t he talk about it! It&#39;s like all of reality changed and he was the only one that remembered it! <br />
<br />
&quot;You can hang out with us if you want to, little man,&quot; Andy offered. &quot;Come on, man. Have a beer with us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s nice of you, but I gotta get to the library. I have a test tomorrow.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking loser,&quot; Steve uttered as Tristan was still closing the door behind him. It didn&#39;t even matter to Steve that Tristan heard them. And then they all started laughing. He stayed outside the thin door of his dorm hearing them laugh as they made fun of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, did you see the look on his face? That dude is gay, I&#39;m telling you,&quot; said Dave from within the dorm. <br />
<br />
Tristan wanted to cry. They were all so big and strong and tall and hot. He remembered being one of them. And Andy! Andy had changed so much! He was so much taller than he used to be. Now everyone loved Andy! What the fuck is happening to me! he thought in despair as he sat inside a library cubicle and started preparing for his test.</p>
