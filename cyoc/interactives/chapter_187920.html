<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I really liked the pace of the story a lot, especially the one where Kyle has to be nice to Jennifer or gets turned into a dog. Unfortunately this story path ran dry many years ago and even back then didn’t grow more than a few chapters big. Additionally to that here and there were some details I’d really like to change… so I did.<br/>
The next three following chapters are partly overtaken from the other authors; I kept the chapter titles to more easily find them (if you are interested). Sometimes I changed just a word or let out a sentence. Other times I added/rewrote several passages.<br/>
To not take the credit for things I didn’t wrote I always tried to mark them by formatting them CURSIV. Caution: Sometimes I changed a few words (mainly some grammar mistakes etc.; others more for not conflicting with following chapters regarding logic) also in the passages I marked. So not only for that reason feel free to read the stories written by the original authors.<br/>
<br/>
(end of not box space; continue in text section)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[note box continuation]<br />
Be aware I also in the following few chapters added a bit more spice to make writing more chapters for this story more interesting for you and others, hopefully. (Caution, maybe a tiny little spoiler) I tried do give the characters a bit more personality, especially to Jennifer to make her actions more comprehensible and let her have a bit more sympathy from the reader. I also in the next chapter gave her a new nice ability that until now wasn’t part of the story, hope you like it.<br />
And now have fun and enjoy.<br />

Transform or Dare (Jennifer starts things) 2<br />
added by Ape-Boy 12 years ago (lightly edited by T.R.P.T)<br />
<br />
<em> Everyone knew about the town curse. Or at least, one version of it anyway. It came up in whispers, notes passed between high school girls, writing on the bathroom wall at the local single&#39;s bar and the occasional mass e-mail sent out from an anonymous address. Most thought it was bullshit. After all, every town has a legend, right? This one just tended to be a little...unique.<br />
<br />
Regardless of personal opinions, the stories were never stamped out entirely. Just as the latest batch of teens had all but forgotten the tales of the generation before them, strange things would begin to happen in the town of Glendale, and the rumors would heat up again and spread like wildfire....<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
Jennifer Smith lay in bed groaning. She wore only her light pink pajamas when she rolled over and groaned as light filled the room from the open door.<br />
<br />
“Jennifer!” her mother Martha shouted, what was answered with a depressed groan.<br />
“Jennifer, what are you still doing in bed?” she glanced around the room before continuing to yell, “Why is your room such a mess? Jennifer, are you listening to me?”<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t reply.<br />
<br />
“Nevermind! </em> Just wanted to assure that you don’t come too late. But you know, I also have to appear at work on point. So, see you at evening. And stand up now!” <em>Martha yelled letting Jennifer be for now. ‘What was wrong with girls these days’ her mother thought while leaving the room.<br />
<br />
“I swear to God, the world hates me sometimes.” Jennifer muttered, feeling herself pout as she began to get out of bed. “Why would he break up with me for that bitch Tracy?” <br />
She thought about it for a moment. <br />
‘What could he have possibly found wrong with me? All the guys (and the occasional girl) always liked me. There wasn&#39;t a boy alive at East Hampton who didn&#39;t want me as his girlfriend.’ </em><br />
<br />
She bumped the phone she had in her hand when falling asleep last night on her dresser, not having used it. She had wanted to call Kyle and tell him what a big kind of an asshole he is, to leave her all of a sudden and just with a text message. <br />
<br />
She was about to call out for her mother to tell her that she is sorry and didn’t meant to ignore her but just feels miserable since yesterday. But her mother had already left the house as Jennifer heard in that moment, when a car outside of the house was started.<br />
“Ugh Damn.” she said falling back onto her bed.<br />
<br />
Then she got an idea. She remembered about the scheming she did last night when she was angrily raging about Kyle’s behaviour. It helped at least for some hours yesterday to calm herself down, but now her thoughts were depressed again. ‘So why not make the thoughts of yesterday come into action’ she thought. <br />
<br />
<em> She leaned over to pick the phone up again, thinking back to the town’s curse and the results of her last party... she called Kyle Perkins...<br />
<br />
“Kyle?”<br />
<br />
“Who&#39;s this?” <br />
Her anger rose as she realized he didn&#39;t even recognize her voice, </em>of his girl… ex-girlfriend for over a month. <br />
<br />
<em> “Jennifer Smith,” she answered, “do you know who I am?”<br />
<br />
“Aw crap, yes... You sound like a mess.”<br />
<br />
She tried to say something else, but she stopped herself as Kyle continued to talk. “Look Jen, I&#39;m sorry about last night, I just had to end it alright, just leave me alone ok?”<br />
<br />
“Actually, I just wanted to let you know that I&#39;m not ok with how we left things, and I would like to ask you a question.” she seethed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah? And what&#39;s that?” Kyle answered getting annoyed that this conversation was not ending and he was going to be late for the bus.<br />
<br />
“Transform or Dare?”<br />
<br />
Kyles&#39; heart froze in his chest. “W-what?”<br />
<br />
The line was cold. He could only hear faint breathing coming from the other end.<br />
<br />
This couldn&#39;t be real, could it? Of course not. He didn&#39;t believe in bullshit like that. This was stupid, but stupid or not, though, one thing his friend told him rang through his mind, “If you don&#39;t choose one or the other in less than a minute, you have to take both!”<br />
<br />
And that was the town curse. Someone had laid it out for Jennifer at </em> her last party with some friends last Friday. <em>  It was a game, started who knows how long ago, by who knows who? Yes, a game. But unlike its weaker counterpart &#39;Truth or Dare,&#39; this game had power! Whomsoever turn it was could ask anybody, anyone, the question: “Transform or Dare”<br />
The question Jennifer had just asked Kyle. Then they had to choose, “One or the other, or you get both!” <br />
<br />
Dare was relatively simple, once selected the person asking could dare you to do anything and you had to do it! The magic, the curse, made you, no matter how much you don&#39;t want to.<br />
<br />
Transform was even weirder. It effected your being; the thing that you are, rather than your immediate actions. If you pick that one, the person asking gets to turn you into anything they want. They can change small things, like aspects of your personality, or the whole package, such as turning you into a toad. Or so the theory went. The actual limits of the curse were highly debated among the local residents who believed in its power. In any case, after the choice is made and the spell completed, it becomes the next person&#39;s turn. So, suddenly, the one who was cursed becomes the one who wields the magic, allowing the cycle to continue endlessly, with the power passing on from one person to the next, resting only occasionally when someone chooses not to take their turn.<br />
<br />
But that was all made up, right? Kyle glanced up at the clock in his room. His minute was almost up. Though he was skeptical, he wasn&#39;t 100% sure it was made up, he took a deep breath and said...</em></p>

What does Kyle answer?</h3>
