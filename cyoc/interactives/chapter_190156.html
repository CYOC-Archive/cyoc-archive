<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You spend the next few hours sightseeing and doing only mild shopping. You have a weapon and armor already, and Brenda uses a log spear, so getting new equipment isn&#39;t necessary either. You now also are openly appreciative of the outfit too. And while technically you are way more exposed, given how you are not wearing anything but a mini skirt over your pussy and all, you do not need to worry about a thing since it isn&#39;t like it is windy today, and you are fully &quot;covered&quot; for the most part. It is just when you sit down that you need to be careful, however crossing your legs has by now become practically second nature to you.<br />
<br />
Brenda and the clerk had tried to push you to wear at least some panties, but it just felt way to uncomfortable. Perhapse as a side effect of being a mother slime or something. Either way, you can&#39;t stand the feeling of wearing them, so you didn&#39;t get any and insisted that the skirt was more than enough. It was ultimately decided when you compromised by letting her put you in boots with a heel. Wearing high heeled boot is perfectly fine. And in your opinion, totally worth not wearing panties.<br />
<br />
You actually are quute good at walking in heels too. Likely a bonus from being a knight who normally wears only a bikini for armor. In other words, your sense of balance is very strong due to your class, so walking in heels is not a problem for you.<br />
<br />
As you stroll down the street while heading back to the guild building, you think about everything that has happened so far. And aside from the whole slime incident, you are actually having a lot of fun. Which is weird since for all you know, you are stuck inside this game world. And not even Brenda has even mentioned any thought about how you all will be getting out of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what if we are stuck like this?&quot; You ask Brenda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stuck like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stuck in this game world I mean. Am I now forever a girl and a mother to slimes at that? Are you stuck as an Amazonis, Can we even escape? Thoughts like that have been popping in and out of my head.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brenda pauses and thinks it over. &quot;I haven&#39;t even really thought of that, but I am sure there must be a way out, or why would someone make this? Does the book say anything about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had forgotten about the book and quickly look through it. You find a section about ending the game and it is all about winning the game by completing the scenario that the book has automatically generated for you all to play in. But that is all it says. Nothing necessarily about escaping, but it seems to hint towards that outcome if you manage to win and complete the campaign.<br />
<br />
You share the information and are now a bit more calm about it too. One less worry on your shoulders and all. And to take another concern off your plate, you finally manage to run into Judy and Damon as they are entering the Guild Hall. <br />
<br />
Damon looks like your standard magic user. Robes and a staff in hand. He even has a beard.<br />
<br />
But Judy... Judy isn&#39;t living. Judy apparently is now a kind of Golem who looks more like a cybernetic person made up of wires and metal in the shape of a woman, than an actual human. <br />
<br />
Her hair is all wires, and while she has a shell in the shape of a woman, none of her is organic. However, her body moves as if she were flesh and blood. Even her &quot;boobs&quot; are soft and bouncy looking. Her feet are nothing but stilts, with a flat andled bar on the bottom for stability. Without it, she would appear as if she is walking on the tip of her two longest toes. <br />
<br />
On her back are 6 protruding pieces of metal which seem detachable. Her forearms have blades in them which can be extended and retracted too. But the biggest thing is the blue glowing crystal where her heart would be. <br />
<br />
You are also glad that her face isn&#39;t transparent like her body mostly is. But overall she is not what you had expected a &quot;Tech Master&quot; to look like, as it was a bit too SciFi, but apparently the game book thought otherwise. You do have to admit that she looks cool though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you must be Judy, right?&quot; You ask as you walk up to the two of them. You watch as Judy rotate her head 180 degrees to look at you, which is kinda creepy seeing it happen before you. &quot;I don&#39;t know you from my records.&quot; She says. It definitely is her voice, just now with a slightly computerized sound to it. &quot;Do you know them Damon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon turns around and looks you both up and down. &quot;Is that you Brenda?&quot; He asks, seemingly to have put it all together a bit. &quot;Yeah, and this is Luna, er, Lucas. She, He has been through quite a bit, and is now stuck like this for the foreseeable future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, what Brenda said. I am Lucas, but I go by Luna at the moment. Amd I am technically still a knight.&quot; You say awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bikini Knight?&quot; Guesses Damon.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s just like him. He seems to have figured it out already just from looking at you. &quot;Yeah, I am now a Bikini Knight. As well as a Mother Slime. Its complicated. But I am fine and don&#39;t mind being like this for the time being. Anyways, what is it like being a machine Judy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not bad actually. I feel normal, but I don&#39;t ever tire or need to eat. I can see in the dark too. And if it is metal, I can more or less control it to an extent and turn it into some kind of tech device. The 6 things on my back all use to be swords that got stabbed into me. Now I can use them as drones, flying blades, a shield, etc. Its really cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you have been stabbed 6 times already?&quot; Asks Brenda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I suck at fighting, hand to hand. But it isn&#39;t like I really got hurt, and I can fully repair myself if I have the metal to so. And I can just put cuts back together no problem. As long as my mana core is intact and not fully drained, I am theoretically unkillable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s two of us now I guess. I am in a similar situation. My body is my core, and if not disintegrated or burned up completely, I will fully recover with enough time and water. Oh yeah, and this is my first child.&quot; You say and hold out your baby blue slime.<br />
<br />
Damon raises an eyebrow at this. &quot;Child? So you really gave birth to this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwww it&#39;s so cute!&quot; Says Judy who tries to pick it up. But the slime quickly hides deep down in your cleavage. When it sees her reaching for it. &quot;Sorry, but it only really likes me to hold it right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon quickly looks away from you and Judy appears to become flustered all of a sudden. &quot;Hey, whats going on? You ask the two of them. Brenda then nudges your shoulder and pushes your head down. &quot;Ow, what? Oh god damn it!&quot; You say as you tug at your new third breast and pull the slime off of you. Judy just laughs at you after seeing this.</p>
