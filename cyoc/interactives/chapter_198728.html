<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom wiped the tear from his eyes. What was done could not be undone. His wife was now his pet, who was most likely pregnant with his other dog&#39;s puppies at this point. That&#39;s when Tom chuckled slightly to himself &quot;She always said she had wanted more kids...&quot; He remarked to himself,  but then felt ashamed for what he said. He himself had been just moments away from getting himself knocked up with puppies, a nightmare he didn&#39;t want to think of now.  <br />
<br />
He decided that he didn&#39;t want to risk anymore changes to anyone in his family and pressed the eject button on his PC. Once the CD ROM was ejected, he grabbed it and without hesitation, snapped it in half! He threw away the two pieces of CD into the trash can and walked towards the door leading to the back yard. <br />
<br />
By now, both Samantha and Max had finished their mating session and were laying in the grade, butt to butt, as Max&#39;s dick was stuck inside of her still. <br />
<br />
Tom sighed to himself. He had to come up with what he would tell his kids about what happened to their mother. <br />
<br />
And with that thought, Tom turned away from the door and headed back into his home, that felt somewhat empty now. Leaving his darling, beautiful wife, laying in the backyard with a dog dick firmly locked in her now bitch pussy. <br />
<br />
Epilogue:<br />
Two months later<br />
<br />
Tom had been able to convince his kids that their loving mother had decided to leave them. They didn&#39;t believe him at first, but since there was no incidence to say otherwise, they accepted his explanation after a while.<br />
<br />
Samantha was close to giving birth to her first, of many, litters of puppies. Her belly was huge with 5 puppies according to the vet. Her teats were hanging low, full of milk and ready to feed her new kids. Her human mind was still unwilling to submit. She hated every bit of what she was. She could feel her puppies moving and this made her ashamed. She had be fucked by a dog. Dozens of times now. He had filled her with his seed and impregnated her. She felt dirty as a dog. Having to clean herself and sometimes even cleaning Max as well. <br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t cope with what her husband had done to her. Her rows of milk filled tits were uncomfortable, she couldn&#39;t believe still that her once nice sized breasts had developed into 6 dog tits and soon would have puppies nursing on her, like the mother dog she had become. <br />
<br />
She was literally living her worst nightmare and had no escape. Her instincts kept her an obedient dog to her master, Tom and a submissive mate to Max. Not only had she not liked Max before but he was Max&#39;s dog and she never claimed him as her own and now she was HIS fuck toy, his bitch. <br />
<br />
Tom still felt guilt for what he had done. But that didn&#39;t stop him from treating Samantha like any other dog. He made her sleep on the floor, next to Max, eat and drink from bowls, and relieve herself outside. He had even bought her a collar and started caller her Sam, it was easier to call her by that. <br />
<br />
As the years went by, Samantha had many more litters, even after Max passed away, she found ways to get out of the house and fuck random strays on the streets. Her human mind was disgusted by the act of just be used as the neighborhood slut dog. One time she escaped from the house and found a stray wondering down her street. She let him mount her and fucked her right on the sidewalk, in view of all her neighbors. &#39;I can&#39;t believe this ...this is some dirty stray.....using me. He&#39;s probably never had a bath and he&#39;s balls deep inside of me... my dog side is such a slut...&#39; she thought to herself. <br />
<br />
The neighbors were use to see her wonder around looking for dog lovers. The neighbors would then always bring her back to Tom and tell him he should have her fixed because of her high sex drive. But Tom couldn&#39;t do it, he figured that since she was very sexually driven as a human that it must&#39;ve passed to her dog form as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;How was that one Sam?&quot; Tom asked in a slightly mocking tone. &quot; Did you at least get his name?&quot; Tom chuckled.<br />
<br />
&#39;You fucking bastard!&#39; Samantha thought to herself, still feeling the cum from the stray oozing from her sore pussy. And of course, two months later she was giving birth to that strays puppies. <br />
<br />
And this continued for the rest of Samantha&#39;s life...</p>
