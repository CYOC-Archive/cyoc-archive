<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Yes, that was my plan from the start, Chip,” Ray said, still using the perversive smile of Chip’s body.<br />
<br />
“If you want to do that, you could have just made a sex doll that looks like you in the Printing Machine.”<br />
<br />
“You think I haven’t done that before? Sex Dolls feel cold and they look weird. And they don’t have the stimulus, real organic bodies provide. Just look at my body. It’s warm, breathing and moves as a real human body would. So if you’ll excuse me…”<br />
<br />
“WAIT! You want stimulus right?”<br />
<br />
Ray turned his head and slowly thinned his eyes in suspicion. It looks like he’s getting annoyed with talking to Chip. “Yes,” <br />
<br />
“You can put me in your body and we can you know,” Ray blushed despite lacking the necessary organs to show it, “Do your thing.”<br />
<br />
Ray moved closer to the tree trunk with wide-open eyes. His heart was racing and he felt stupid for not thinking of this before. “You would do that?” <br />
<br />
Chip nodded.<br />
<br />
Ray dragged his lifeless body to the chair and lowered the sucker on his old body’s head. The tree did its thing and in a moment, Chip began to wriggle his naked form and appreciate the return of a human heartbeat in his chest. Well, he’s glad that he has a chest again. Although it’s not his.<br />
<br />
Ray’s body is well, a bit similar to Chip’s. Although, he’s not that muscular since he disliked doing heavy farm chores. Nevertheless, their height and weight didn’t stray too far. He’s a bit pudgy from eating his cuisine. Chip tried to stand up but he fell over when he realized his weight have shifted a bit and he’s not used to it. Ray supported him upward, and in doing so, their dicks touched together. Which made Ray hard and soon, Chip too.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry.” Chip said, hiding the blush in his face. Which is hard since Ray is so white that not only does his cheeks blush, but his whole head and ears. “Is it just me or is it warm in here?”<br />
<br />
“It’s just you since you’re in my body. So, are you ready?”<br />
<br />
“Be gentle, I could already feel how tight your ass is.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I’ve never put anything in there my whole life.”<br />
<br />
“Not even your own finger?”<br />
<br />
“Not even my own finger.”<br />
<br />
Ray flipped Chip to the back and led him to the chair underneath the sucker. Chip held his hands at the seat and curved his back, showing his bare rear end right in front of Ray. Like what he said, his ass is quite firm and tight. This butt may not be as bubbly as his real butt, but it will suffice. <br />
<br />
Ray picked another polyp and popped the fruit between his fingers, spreading the juices and lubing his left hand. With his right hand, he spread Chip’s butt cheeks open and slowly inserted his index finger. Chip gritted his teeth at the sudden penetration of his finger. He could feel every touch and every inched it moves. Fuck! Ray not only has a tight fucking ass. He’s fucking sensitive as well. Fuck! <br />
<br />
When the entirety of the index was inside, Ray pulled it out in a quick motion. Chip was taken for a surprise and he made a quick yip because of it.<br />
<br />
“Ray! Wh- What was that?” Chip asked. His butt was still squirming because of how intense that was. Doesn’t ray know how sensitive his body is? Fuck.<br />
<br />
“I just want to see what I look like with a face like that. And now, I know. Are you ready again? I’ll insert two this time.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, but don’t you dare do that again.”<br />
<br />
“Fine,”<br />
<br />
Ray lubed up his other hand. Slowly yet firm, he inserted his right index inside. Chip held the chair tighter when the other index from his left entered the orifice of his behind. The fingers squirmed inside him, like crickets playing lutes using their legs. They moved left and right, and then Ray pulled the hole open, showing the innards lit by the glowing lube. This view of his own open ass is exhilarating. It’s a good thing he just cleaned the rims of it this morning. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to lick it,” Ray muttered.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm… Yeah. Wait! What!?”<br />
<br />
“Too late,”<br />
<br />
Ray dug his head between butt cheeks, sniffing the faint smell of his ass and placing his mouth where the asshole is. Chip was trying to escape but Ray held him tight with his stronger arms, as he began to work his tongue inside the ass. The ass tasted like pine mangoes and the slight tang of flesh. He licked every crevasse, every niche and inch of the hole. Chip collapsed on the floor and the chair he was holding for support toppled over. Which made Chip lie on the ground, and letting the perverse tongue of his old body penetrate deeper and deeper into his anus. His saliva filled him in the inside, and it made the tongue bury deeper and deeper into his hole. Chip has never felt this much stimulus from his life before. He felt bad because of how amazing it is and how much he’s liking it. He wants to break free and yet, he wants to stay and let him melt him in a puddle of pure euphoria. His old body’s hands held tight to his chest, it clung tightly until it made their mark at the surface of his skin. <br />
<br />
“Ungngghhh…” Chip groaned. Underneath his body, he could already feel his borrowed dick harden at every prod of Ray’s tongue. He was a heartbeat beating like drums underneath the earth. He was fire, the hottest he has ever felt. Chip’s face is flushed red from agony and pleasure. Chip clawed at the tiled floor, looking for support. But the only support he could find is the arms holding him in place.<br />
<br />
Chip turned around, looked at Ray straight in the eyes and dove for the juices flowing in his mouth. It’s his first kiss but this body felt like it has kissed a thousand others before. It danced like a sword, scouring the insides of his old body’s mouth as if he hadn’t owned it before. Without a gasp for air, Chip kissed deeper, stealing the domination Ray has bestowed upon him. A vine hangs loosely above them and Chip reached for it and skinned it for the polyps. The glowing juices rained on them like a storm, covering their bodies in a slick and smooth lube. In a moment, it felt like their body was a fusion of each other’s pleasure. Chip left the other’s mouth and scoured his body, licking at every polyp juice his mouth could see. Ray did the same, licking the juices in his former body. This dance of their mouth and body seemed to last for ages and ended with both of them covered in saliva and remaining juices of the tree.<br />
<br />
They glistened under the glow, smiling at each other. One was as red as a rose, the other huffing and begging for more. Ray flipped over until he was face to face with his old organ - a hard 6-inch shaft blessed with a massive girth. At this view, it looked like a humongous beast because it is all he could see. As for Chip, he looked straight at his 9-inch shaft with a cute uncut tip. He appreciated how much he has taken it for granted his whole life. This may be the only time he could ever look at it at this angle and have it as a meal. <br />
<br />
The swallowed each other’s package in unison but strayed away in the way they worked with their meal. Chip is patient with his meal. He took simple strokes of his tongue and took it for multiple round trips inside the foreskin. Ray was the opposite, he immediately swallowed the head and worked his way down to the base. He pulled back his head and dove, he repeated it while his tongue circled the shaft. <br />
<br />
They huffed in every trough, moaned in each crest. Chip’s was faster, Ray’s was deeper and intimate. As their heads did their things, their hands scoured their skin - their own and the other. Chip pinched Rays nippled and fondled his balls. Ray tried to do the same but his left hand found a better activity and diving deeper into his cavernous ass. Ray found it easier to work through his current ass than his old body’s. It&#39;s surprising how easy he found his G-spot. He poked at it and -!<br />
<br />
It was a bigger surprise at how he thought Chip’s body have subdued responses to stimulus. One mere touch of his G-spot was enough to electrocute his own body, paralyze him at the spot and release all his pent up come inside Chip’s mouth. Chip was surprised at the sudden gush of body juices and this, in turn, made him release his own cum in the other’s mouth. In unison, they moan,<br />
<br />
“Ahhhhh….! AH! AH! AH!” They dug their fingernails in the other and held out for the ebb of pleasure crashing on them. <br />
<br />
“Chip,” Ray said with wet undertones, “I fucking love you. Being you,”<br />
<br />
“You can say the same for me, Ray,”<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
As much as they like to stay within their current forms, they need to return as they have their jobs tomorrow. Chip doesn’t know how to cook and it would be a stupid thing to force him to do so in Ray’s body. And Ray, however strong Chip’s body is, doesn’t want to do any backbreaking gardening job. He worked his whole life not to do agriculture on his planet, why should he do it here.<br />
<br />
After returning, they took a bath in the ship washroom next door and prepared themselves for sleep. With a smile before the dark, Chip could only appreciate at how fucking weird yet exhilarating this day is. He hopes that tomorrow would be the same.</p>
