<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan continued to admire his new body, flexing and posing for Doug as he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I can&#39;t believe you wished to be little,&quot; Ryan said, shaking his head. &quot;Being an adult is so much better. I mean, look at me. I&#39;m a freaking bodybuilder now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug couldn&#39;t help but feel a little embarrassed as he looked down at his oversized clothing. He had always been a confident man, but now he felt like a child in comparison to Ryan.<br />
<br />
Before Doug could respond, Ryan grabbed Doug&#39;s old suit and started to put it on, laughing as he struggled to fit his muscular frame into the too-small clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is hilarious,&quot; Ryan said, grinning as he tugged on the jacket. &quot;I can barely move in this thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug couldn&#39;t help but smile at Ryan&#39;s enthusiasm, despite his own reservations about the situation.<br />
<br />
As Ryan continued to admire his new body, he suddenly announced that he couldn&#39;t go home like this. He needed time to figure out what to do next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go back to your place,&quot; Ryan said, grabbing Doug by the arm. &quot;We need to work out an agreement.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug couldn&#39;t help but feel a little nervous as they left the school and headed back to his house. He wasn&#39;t sure what kind of agreement Ryan had in mind, but he knew that he needed to tread carefully.<br />
<br />
As they arrived at Doug&#39;s house, Ryan immediately headed for the weight room in the basement, eager to put his new muscles to the test.<br />
<br />
Doug followed him down, still feeling a little out of place in his oversized clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what kind of agreement are we talking about?&quot; Doug asked, trying to sound casual.<br />
<br />
Ryan paused, taking a deep breath as he grabbed a set of dumbbells.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think it&#39;s pretty clear that I&#39;m the one in charge now,&quot; Ryan said, flexing his biceps for emphasis. &quot;But I&#39;m willing to make a deal.”<br />
<br />
 Ryan immediately went to the kitchen and started rummaging through the cupboards, looking for something to eat. Doug was surprised at how comfortable Ryan was in his home, as if he had been there before.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you want to do this week?&quot; Ryan asked, munching on a bag of chips.<br />
<br />
Doug thought for a moment before replying, &quot;Well, I was planning on going to the gym every day. I try to stay in shape, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;That&#39;s perfect! We can work out together. I can show you some moves that will really make those muscles pop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug smiled nervously. He wasn&#39;t used to working out with someone so young and muscular, but he was willing to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
As they finished their snacks, Ryan pulled out the coin and placed it on the table. &quot;Just in case we need it,&quot; he said with a grin.<br />
<br />
Doug rolled his eyes but secretly was glad to have the coin nearby. He had a feeling he was going to need it before the week was over.<br />
<br />
Ryan spends most of the day at the gym, trying out different machines and lifting weights. He feels invigorated by the newfound strength and energy he has as an adult. The more he works out, the more he feels his muscles growing and expanding, making him look even more massive and powerful.<br />
<br />
As he is changing in the locker room, a teenage boy walks up to him and compliments his gains. &quot;Dude, you&#39;re massive,&quot; he says, eyeing Ryan&#39;s bulging biceps and ripped abs. Ryan can&#39;t help but feel a sense of pride as he flexes for the boy, showing off his impressive physique.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, man,&quot; he says, feeling a surge of confidence. &quot;I&#39;ve been working hard to get to where I am now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy nods in admiration before walking away, leaving Ryan feeling more pumped than ever. He spends the rest of the day pushing himself to the limit, determined to become even bigger and stronger.<br />
<br />
As the day draws to a close, Ryan heads back to Doug&#39;s house, still feeling the rush of adrenaline from his workout. He can&#39;t wait to see what other adventures await him during his week as an adult.<br />
<br />
When he returned to Doug’s place he headed to the bathroom to shower. As Ryan continued to flex in the mirror, he couldn&#39;t help but feel impressed with his own body. He admired his massive biceps, triceps, and shoulders, his shredded abs, and his thick, muscular thighs. He ran his hand over his chest, feeling the hard muscle beneath his skin.<br />
<br />
Ryan couldn&#39;t believe how much he had changed in just a day, from a scrawny 13-year-old to a muscular 32-year-old man. He was thrilled with his new body, and couldn&#39;t wait to see what else he could do with it.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes of flexing and admiring himself in the mirror, Ryan decided to get dressed and head back out to the living room. He wrapped a towel around his waist, feeling the weight of his thick thighs and powerful glutes as he walked.<br />
<br />
As he entered the living room, he found Doug sitting on the couch, watching TV. &quot;Hey, Doug,&quot; Ryan said, grinning. &quot;What do you think of these muscles?&quot; He flexed his bicep, watching it bulge and ripple beneath his skin.<br />
<br />
Doug looked up at Ryan, his eyes widening in surprise. &quot;Wow, Ryan,&quot; he said, his voice filled with amazement. &quot;You really do look like a bodybuilder now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan grinned, feeling a surge of pride in his chest. He loved the way Doug was looking at him, with a mixture of admiration and envy. He knew that he had achieved something amazing, and he couldn&#39;t wait to see what else he could do with his new body.</p>
