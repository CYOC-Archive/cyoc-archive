<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat leaned to her right, letting go of the dice over the board. Her awkward pair of breasts jostled and slapped together a bit as she moved. The latest change to her breasts would have been interesting had it not been for her first change, she reflected. Now, they felt like two fleshy weights that were constantly throwing her off-balance.<br />
<br />
At least they firmed up a bit with that change, Kat thought to herself. She twisted her head to see the outcome of her roll, 5 and 2.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you move over a bit, babe? My ass is in the way,&quot; Kat teased, wearing a stupid grin from her witty remark.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say please, you know,&quot; Scott replied with Kat&#39;s voice. Working together, they were able to reposition themselves without much trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I think we&#39;re starting to get the hang of this,&quot; Kat said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to see you guys try to walk,&quot; Cal replied smugly. Melissa giggled a bit at his remark.<br />
<br />
Kat and Scott gave a mirrored eye-roll, as Kat moved her piece and the next change was read.<br />
<br />
Though your last change helped your relationship strengthen<br />
Perhaps this new change will help both of you manage<br />
What comes next, your neck will be able to lengthen<br />
And move like a snake, as an added advantage<br />
<br />
Kat&#39;s neck tingled a bit, however nothing visible, or even physical had seemed to change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, so you can extend your neck now?&quot; Scott asked behind him, curious about what was happening behind his back. He too had felt the tingling in Kat&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
Kat felt a bit puzzled, feeling like she had an extra muscle in her neck that she just discovered. Kat attempted to use it, like stretching her neck but a bit more fluid. As she did, her neck lengthened and poured out of her shoulders, covering the new growth in smooth flesh without stretch marks. Kat gasped, her head falling down and getting caught in two of her hands. Her head felt like it weighed quite a bit in her hands when she relaxed her neck, but when she tensed it again, it felt lightweight.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to admit, that looks pretty cool,&quot; Cal said. &quot;As long as you can reel it back in, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat nodded and focused, finding a way to do just that. It was like unstretching a slinkie, Kat realized, except instead of a slinkie it was her own neck. The extra flesh merged back into her body as quickly as it was created, and soon her head sat back on top of her shoulders as it was before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, I&#39;m like a rokurokubi,&quot; Kat said with excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; Cal asked, looking confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s something from Japanese mythology. If I remember correctly, they&#39;re these sexy demons that can stretch their necks and move them around and shit. I know about it because one of my friends has a tat of one on her back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;ve certainly got the sexy demon look covered,&quot; Melissa quipped, grinning.<br />
<br />
Kat stretched her neck out a bit, experimenting some more. &quot;You&#39;re not looking too bad yourself, there,&quot; Kat said with a wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;You done messing around, snake-neck? Whatever you&#39;re doing, it feels weird,&quot; Scott said from behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I haven&#39;t forgotten about you, lover,&quot; Kat purred, stretching her neck out and moving it around the other side. For fun, she looped it once around their shared torso, and wrapped it around Scott&#39;s back and tresses. Her head emerged from behind Scott&#39;s right side, moving up to examine her boyfriend at eye-level. Scott flinched a bit, taken a bit off guard at Kat&#39;s flexibility and the sensation of Kat wrapping around their body twice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there, sexy,&quot; Kat said, examining the mirror image of herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I didn&#39;t think I could be surprised anymore after what had happened already. Somehow, this game keeps delivering,&quot; Scott admitted, his eyes tracing Kat&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I was right, that change was an improvement. I have to say, that hair really does suit me- I mean you.&quot; Kat added with a cheeky smile.<br />
<br />
In his best imitation of his girlfriend, Scott stuck out his tongue. Kat mimicked him, before moving in for a kiss. Scott reciprocated, placing both hands on the back of her head to steady themselves.<br />
<br />
Cal felt a bit uncomfortable and aroused, forcing himself to look away from their show. Suddenly, he felt a strong arm wrap around his thin waist, which he quickly figured out belonged to Melissa. He looked over a bit, Melissa staring intently at the odd kiss that Scott and Kat were sharing and not at him. Cal blushed, but didn&#39;t resist it. He felt himself being drawn to Melissa, a strange attraction that he had never felt before. Sure, he thought that she was hot as soon as they met, but she was always too different for him to fee tool emotionally attached to her.<br />
<br />
Now, he felt himself ease into her embrace, moving in a bit closer to her. Melissa brought her hand to a rest on the inside of Cal&#39;s thigh, hovering just close enough to get him even more excited.<br />
<br />
Finally, Kat pulled away from Scott, enjoying the aroused look on his face. It was one thing sharing a kiss with someone who looked exactly like you. It was another thing completely to feel both sides of the kiss. Recovering, Kat lowered her head to his throbbing erection, pulsating powerfully since their sexually charged kiss. Kat gave the tip a gentle lick before retracting her neck back around their body. Scott groaned and nearly came by himself, but was able to stop and keep them under control.<br />
<br />
Kat&#39;s head came to a rest on top of her neck, smiling as she saw Melissa and Cal cuddling across the board next to each other. Between both pairs, she noticed her piece now had a long neck that curved out a bit in front of it. She tossed the dice over to the other side, waiting for Cal to take his next turn.</p>
