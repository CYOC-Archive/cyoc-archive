<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cindy and Steve stood in the dark under the shadow of a huge elm tree, gazing up at a window on which a person's shadow could be seen moving about. &quot;So that'd be him?&quot; asked Steve. &quot;Well, this is the house of Kelvin Hobbs, and that's who's body you're in, if I'm remembering right. I figure he's probably gonna come here sooner or later, if just to pick up cash. It might be him. You should probably climb up and take a look.&quot; Neither of them moved for a few beats before Cindy winced in realization under Steve's incredulous glare. &quot;Oh. I'm the athletic guy now, aren't I.&quot; Steve made a snorting laugh and gave her a light shove forward. &quot;Doubt I could even haul myself up there at the moment. Have fun!&quot; &quot;Fat chance&quot; mumbled Cindy as she clambered up the branches of the elm, gripping tightly to the wood and trying not to look down. But as she made her way up, feeling the reassurance of her hard muscles straining, their strength keeping her safe, she began to admit to herself that this was kinda fun. She pulled herself up onto a thick branch and then very nearly fell off again when she saw the view through the window.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Kelvin ran his fingers across his washboard abs and up his chest again and shuddered in delight. A tight pressure in his pants was urging him to have at it again, but there were already two loads of cum coating his room from the past quarter hour alone, and he had a feeling if he gave into the sex drive of his new body he'd never stop. His parents would getting home any time now and he wanted to finish here and get out before they got back. He went back to throwing his stuff into the bag - some more cash he'd just uncovered, some photos, more shirts and pants (he knew they'd be skintight but now that he had this body he was looking forward to wearing them like that), his laptop... he looked around and tried to think of anything else he'd want to take with him. Catching sight of himself in his mirror, though, he once again became entranced by his sculpted body. Rick Hammerschmidt had been about the most handsome guy in the entire town; he'd done a bit of modeling in the past few years, but had recently quit, to the despair of his clients. Even on the drive back to here Kelvin had noticed the heads of most women and quite a few men turning towards him. He smiled, and the face that had charmed any girl it wanted smiled back at him from the mirror. It had always seemed unjust to Kelvin that such a jerk should be so incredibly gorgeous, but now things were finally evening up. And the body! He rubbed his broad hands along the smooth tanned skin, feeling the hard muscle lurking beneath. It was as though it had all  been sculpted by an artist, from the rocklike biceps of his arms, pecs of steel and pronounced eight-pack on his upper body down to the magnificent ass and strong legs in the hugging pants that hid absolutely nothing. Hell, even his feet were beautiful.<br />
<br />
Kelvin's breathing became short as he continued to feel his body and the tightness of his pants became excruciating. He grinned in anticipation as he moved shaking hands to the pronounced bulge and pulled it open. Again the dick that this body had been blessed with sprang out, nestled with two huge balls in a neat crop of pubic hair. It was at least nine or so inches long, but it really stood out for it's thickness. All in all, it was a extremely impressive set. &quot;Hellooo, my manmeat&quot; laughed Kelvin between breaths, enjoying the smooth deep voice. He gripped it and began to pump, continuing to massage his body with his other hand. His groans became louder as he once again began to be consumed by euphoria like he'd never felt before today rushing though his body. The considerable stamina of this body was no match for his desperate hands in the midst of this pleasure as they moved like a blur before he finally shot what seemed like a gallon of cum all over himself. He felt it splat onto his face and as he fell back and let the bliss wear off to a point where he could think again. Finally he looked in the mirror and laughed at the image of Rick Hammerschmidt coated in semen. He wiped a drip off his ear and commented to himself &quot;Well, at least I didn't yell loud enough to wake the neighbors this time.&quot; He got up and grabbed a shirt to wipe himself down with before he heard a snapping sound right outside his window.<br />
<br />
In a few quick strides he was at the window he'd entered by, ripping it open and hauling in a surprised young man. They tumbled backwards and landed in a heap on the floor, Kelvin on top. He was about to leap up when the boy whispered &quot;Kelvin?&quot; He froze. They lay there for a moment before Kelvin became a aware of a bulge pressing into what seemed like his entire upper leg. He jumped off and the boy hauled himself to his feel. They stood, facing off against each other; the intruder with his jeans tented all the way down his left leg, and Kelvin standing there in only pants, coated in semen. &quot;Who the hell are you?&quot;</p>
