<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; I said weakly, surprised by the display of grief that Keru had shown, though I don&#39;t know whether or not for her siblings or for her parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is nothing you have done,&quot; Keru answered and wiped away her tears, &quot;though all of this creates more trouble...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The ghosts?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ghosts couldn&#39;t have killed them... not in a direct fight... they had enough magic to permanently banish a thousand ghosts on their own and perhaps two thousand five hundred if they worked together,&quot; Keru answered as she stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suppose it wasn&#39;t a direct fight,&quot; I commented, &quot;but an assassination.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keru blinked and looked down, &quot;but what could they have gotten into that would trigger such a thing? They were pretty firm in following the sort of hierarchical rules that run Kitsune society... to always respect those with more tails than you...&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked toward the shrine it self. I couldn&#39;t hear the voices, but I could see large numbers of figurines on a platform in the shrine, which I guessed represented Keru&#39;s ancestors going back beyond her parents and even grandparents. Some of the figurines had a soft glow to them, many of them were of a bluish shade, though softer in color when compared to Keru&#39;s fur. I really couldn&#39;t picture what would inspire such beings to murder each other, though I was still nervous over what was an apparent trick on both Keru and I. The deceiving of Keru into thinking I was a Nine-Tailed Kitsune. The declaration by my parents that I couldn&#39;t back out of the deal that married Keru to me. I could barely picture anything in the reasoning behind what had happened and wanted to find out why we had been married in the way that we were.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does the glow mean...?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Keru wondered, likely still in conversation with her ancestors, &quot;Oh... that glow represents the magic that Kitsune carry. When we die... our magic doesn&#39;t just vanish, and neither do our spirits. They come back to these sorts of shrines where they live in a sort of afterlife, though they can converse with living Kitsune to a degree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the ones that are glowing are actually here to talk to you?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Keru said slowly and then gasped, &quot;not in the way you&#39;re thinking. They can&#39;t leave the shrine...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her voice seemed to fall off. It was like she was sounding very worried. This only made me nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;All of the statues should be glowing...&quot; Keru finished slowly, &quot;Someone... someone stole their spirits... their magic...&quot;<br />
<br />
I narrowed my own eyes at this. Several of the figurines that had lost their glow represented nine-tails. Others represented other multi tailed Kitsune. A lot of magic had been stolen, and on top of it, it had desecrated the spirits of dead. I may not have been familiar with Kitsune culture and religious practices, but I knew that mistreating the dead was horrible and completely disrespectful thing to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I do?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can EITHER of us do!&quot; Keru gave a groan, &quot;I&#39;m only a two tail. You&#39;re human. We don&#39;t know what parents got into... and we don&#39;t even know who could have done this... perhaps it was some rogue Kitsune with seven or eight tails... perhaps it was insane nine-tail...&quot; she then shivered at that, &quot;... maybe it was a servant who was a bit more rebellious than I&#39;ve been within Kitsune society. We don&#39;t know... all we know is that something happened...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears began to form in her eyes again. I couldn&#39;t stand the sight of that anymore and stepped forward and hugged her. I held her tightly to me and gently stroked her back. We might have only just begun to get to know each other, but I did know that Keru was a good person and didn&#39;t deserve to be so upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents and I may not have been close... and we certainly didn&#39;t agree on everything... but that doesn&#39;t mean they deserved death,&quot; Keru whimpered into my shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll get to the bottom of this,&quot; I told her, &quot;surely there was something left behind that might indicate as to what your parents were involved in... a note or something like that... and surely desecrating your ancestors spirits would be worthy of reporting to you Council of Nine-Tails.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But only a Kitsune can report to the Council,&quot; Keru answered, &quot;You cannot come with me before them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can stay here and look around for any notes,&quot; I answered, &quot;besides... we haven&#39;t found anyone as we&#39;ve wandered around. If it was an assassination, it&#39;s doubtful the assassin will return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But can you read Japanese characters?&quot; Keru asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; I admitted, &quot;surely you&#39;d have some sort of spell that would allow it...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keru paused and thought for a moment. I watched as one ear twitched slightly. After a moment, she snapped her fingers and stepped back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m only a two-tail,&quot; Keru answered, &quot;I don&#39;t have the power to give you the knowledge to not only understand the language but understand what is slang and what is not... but... I might be able to link us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Link us?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A telepathic link,&quot; Keru explained, &quot;I&#39;d be able to see through your eyes and you through mine. You could read through my brain and I through yours. You could then use MY knowledge to look for anything that might help and we could communicate with each other... even while apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This wouldn&#39;t hurt, would it?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Keru shook her head, &quot;and it&#39;s the only thing I can do for the moment... short of staying here and looking, then dropping you off in the mortal realm, and then going back to report to the Council...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; I sighed, &quot;Go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keru stepped back further and then flared out her two tails, which began to glow with a sort of blue flame at their tips. She then spoke softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mortal husband of a Magical Kitsune... be linked in mind and knowledge with your wife... so to read and understand the word and rune...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the blue fire went from her tails and to my eyes, and held them open. I could only watch as the fire then bounced back into Keru&#39;s eyes and a beam of blue light seemed to flow between us as we looked to each other. Then after a moment, the light faded and we were both able to blink. I then glanced over to the shrine again and could now notice the names and ages of the Kitsune represented by the figurines. I could also feel some personal sense of grief and loss... loss for lost siblings and even lost parents. These had to be Keru&#39;s thoughts and feelings. I then glanced to Keru again to see that she had a sort of soft smile on her vulpine muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you do find me beautiful?&quot; she commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I...&quot; I stuttered, realizing that through this link, while I had access to Keru&#39;s knowledge, Keru had also gained access to mine. She only came forward and hugged me again.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is okay,&quot; Keru answered, &quot;If we survive this, we&#39;ll have plenty of time to truly date and get to know each other.&quot;</p>
