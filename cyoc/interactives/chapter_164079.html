<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> “I’m not a cripple” she said and sat down but let out a yelp as she  stood right back up.  Looking down at the seat the shiny metal of the  seat belt reflected the summer sun.  She reached down into her pants and  touched her lip.  Bringing her hand up to her face she saw a smudge of  blood on her finger.  <br />
<br />
“I cut my lip” I heard her say  <br />
<br />
“Be careful sweetie” I said and moved the seat belt out of her.  She sat  down and she immediately squirmed a bit and then parted her legs  slightly.  <br />
<br />
“It’s hard to breath” she said but with her mouth smashed up against the  car seat all Jim heard was a muffled “Iffs jhar oo hreafff.”  <br />
<br />
“What?” he said  <br />
<br />
“Iffs jhar ooo hreafff” she said again but a little louder.  <br />
<br />
“ohh fjuh ieh” he heard her say as she crossed her arms and looked sadly out the window.  <br />
<br />
He reached over to hold her hand and she pulled it away.  <br />
<br />
She had all but given up on trying to breath out of her mouth about 10  minutes into the trip.  The plastic seat proved to be an indomitable  obstacle in getting air in and out of her mouth and the harder she tried  the more she should sounds coming from that part of her body.   “God,  he thinks I’m farting” she thought as one particular obnoxious noise  caused by her breath breaking the seal between her lips and the plastic  seat made a squeak.   That thought made consider again her predicament.   What if she has to pass gas and oh God, what if she has to poop?  It’s  going to happen sooner or later.  How will she do this?  Her thoughts go  back to college when her friends would help each other by holding their  hair back and out of the toilet when either of them had had too much to  drink.  She thought of herself now, kneeling in front of a toilet so  she could relieve herself one way but having to sit down as usual to  relieve herself when she had to pee.  <br />
<br />
These thoughts made her start to cry.  What kind of life is she going to  live and how will her husband deal with this?  What is going to happen  to their sex life when a simple kiss is now not such a simple kiss?    Oral sex had never been something she was fond of because of  insecurities about her body.  <br />
<br />
She thought back to in the trailer how he had kissed her on the  forehead.  Was he so disgusted at what was on her face that he would not  ever kiss her on the cheek for fear of being too close to her anus?   She did have to admit that through their entire life together; anal  anything was a no go for him.    Was this going to drive them apart?  <br />
<br />
The van pulled in to a courtyard surrounded on 3 sides by a small wall and the other a bank of glass doors.  <br />
<br />
“We’re here” the doctor said as the driver opened the door and offered Janice a hand out of the van.  <br />
<br />
Standing out in the warm desert air, Janice noticed how having your  mouth in your butt crack was not a good thing in a hot van on plastic  seats as she felt how her lips where wet with sweat.  Perhaps having  underwear would help somewhat but that all remains to be seen.  For now,  she just swallowed hard and then licked the salty wetness from her  lips.  She spread her legs slightly and felt  the breeze that passed  through the cotton scrubs evaporate some of the icky wetness.  It was  kind of refreshing in a very weird sort of way.  <br />
<br />
They walked through the glass doors and were led to what they called a dorm room but it had all the amenities of a luxury condo.  <br />
<br />
As the driver brought some supplies in she decided it was time to use  the bathroom.  For the last 20 minutes she had been tying to put it out  of her mind but nature was defiantly calling and she couldn’t take it  anymore.  The last thing she wanted was for someone to know that she was  using the toilet so when nobody was looking she sneaked into the  bathroom.  <br />
<br />
Staring at the toilet she stood there for a few moments building up  courage to do what needed to be done and also to gauge what had to be  done.  She didn’t really feel that she needed to poop so she was  confident that all she needed to do was sit down and pee.  <br />
<br />
Finally, after not being able to put it off any longer she pulled down  her scrubs and sat down.  Almost immediately her bladder let lose with a  spray of urine.  She focused on keeping her mouth shut tight and stared  up at the ceiling, not wanting to imagine what is going on down there.   How disgusting is it to think that just a few inches from where the  urine was coming out was her mouth.  A couple of times she felt as if  she needed to pass gas but based upon her experience with the doctor,  she tried very hard not to let that happen.  Luckily, she got by for  now.  <br />
<br />
Finally it was over and she used almost an entire roll of toiled paper  wiping every square inch of skin she could reach and if that wasn’t  enough she used a face cloth with soapy water to wipe around her mouth  even more before she pulled up her pants.  <br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror she stared into her own eyes.   Blocking the  surgical mask with the palm of her hand she imagined that nothing had  happened and all was normal.   <br />
<br />
Getting brave, she pulled the mask down.  Slowly it slid down off of her  chin, she closed her eyes as she felt it pass over her anus and off her  face.  She placed her hand over it and opened her eyes.  That was  better, with the mask gone it was easier to pretend nothing had  happened.  She stared and tried to will her self back to normal,  thinking if she believed that nothing was wrong then everything would  have to be ok.  <br />
<br />
She removed her hand and it was still there.  She leaned closer to the  mirror and noticed how her skin closest to the anus was slightly darker  that the skin on her face and looking yet closer she could see little  hairs in the darker area.  She reached up and touched the skin around  the anus.  Again, phantom feelings conflicted with what her eyes and  fingers were telling her and what her brain knew or thought it knew.  If  she closed her eyes she would had sworn she was reaching around and  touching her butt, but in opening her eyes, she still struggled to  register that those feelings were coming not from her butt but from her  face.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly she pulled the mask back up over her chin.  She washed her  hands for what seemed like an eternity and walked out to meet her  husband</p>
