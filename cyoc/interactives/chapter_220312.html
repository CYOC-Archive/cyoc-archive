<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While is mother and other sisters settled in for the night at Simon&#39;s home, Jeff was looking over the guest room that he had been offered. It wasn&#39;t much but he figured that everyone would have guests from time to time and he could detect and feel that there were old slime trails into the room that didn&#39;t match Melody&#39;s scent, which showed that she did have guests from time to time. On various levels, that was good news and reinforced what he and Lucy had picked out over dinner, that while Slug People were different from humans in many ways, there were still many ways in which they were alike. It was all something that eased Jeff&#39;s mind and concern regarding some of the obvious attraction that had seemed to be there between Lucy and Melody.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d noticed it all the way back when the Chapmans first arrived at the colony and asked for Melody&#39;s help... and through the discussion with her father that had told them the origin story for Slug People. Remembering the obvious and semi-forceful actions that Megan and Jenny had taken when they first visited the Chapmans, and lead to their transformations into Slug People, Jeff was a bit protective of Lucy. Melody was attractive, just as Megan and Jenny were, but he didn&#39;t want his twin sister taken advantage of. It was something that played too heavily to what Megan and Jenny had done under the influence of Edward Cupple and Jeff didn&#39;t want that repeated. But as they&#39;d eaten dinner and discussed things, Melody had seemed to put forward honest and non-lust driven conversation that calmed and comforted Jeff a bit. In fact, by the time they finished dinner, Jeff was fairly confident that Melody posed no threat to Lucy and that any interest that was there was genuine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully they can wait on things until Cupple is beaten and Megan and Jenny are freed of his influence,&quot; Jeff mused to himself as he looked the room over.<br />
<br />
The room was actually about the same size as his room back at the Chapman house, with a relatively large square window that allowed a fair amount of natural light into the room. It provided a comfortable feeling that Jeff found himself enjoying and noting the blues and grays that decorated the room&#39;s coloration, be it the tile on the floor or the wall. There wasn&#39;t a lot that was super flashy or &quot;feminine,&quot; though, Jeff also wasn&#39;t sure on how colors associated with gender in human terms would apply to Slug People, since Slug Women were hermaphrodites while the only Slug People that had a single gender were the rare males. The bed was also different in form and shape. It covered about the same area of the floor as his bed at home, and actually came up about as far as Jeff slid up toward it, but the mattress was not like the mattresses of any beds he&#39;d slept on before.<br />
<br />
Reaching down, the mattress did feel soft, like it would support his weight, but it was sort of like a thick foam wrapped in a soft plastic and that was it. There was no bed linin or anything that he remembered having on his own bed. Some of this perplexed him, as he knew his slime wasn&#39;t acidic, as he would be dissolved by it if it was and the blankets and sheets in the Champman family&#39;s master bedroom weren&#39;t dissolved, even though Megan and Jenny had bathed all of them in their slime as part of the planned efforts to transform them and leave them in a mental state that Cupple could likely then brainwash them before they realized their minds could protect each other by being in close proximity to each other. But then, Megan and Jenny&#39;s slime had destroyed his clothing the previous evening, along with the that of the rest of the Chapman family, though after everything, Jeff assumed that was all probably magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... I suppose this might enable Melody to keep things clean easier,&quot; Jeff thought to himself as he pulled himself up onto the bed.<br />
<br />
He lay down for a moment and found things fairly comfortable and looked with one eye stalk to the thermostat in the room. The temperature was fine, and he was more than willing to make do with it. He then lay there quietly for a few moments and thought over nearly everything that had happened over the past two days. Megan and Jenny&#39;s arrival and then his mother becoming a Slug Woman, then Grace, and then Zoe and Lucy before his own transformation. Then came the day that amounted to wandering the town to get little to no help. They only finally got some help when they came across Melody as they came into the grounds of the Slug Person colony, and that had come from discussions with Melody&#39;s father, Simon. A lot of it was tiring on that and Jeff closed his eyes to try and drift off to sleep when a sound reached his ears...<br />
<br />
It was faint at first, but the sound grew louder and sounded like a passionate conversation and a very sexual moan, and that became even more clear by the end. &quot;Yes... sex as a Slug Woman... is... amazing... different ... from... ohhhhhh... what... you... ohhhhhh goooooooooood... before... and... oooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!&quot; It was Melody&#39;s voice and Jeff heard Lucy&#39;s voice not long after, &quot;I want more.&quot; That quickly told Jeff one thing, and that either Melody didn&#39;t have another guest room or that once &quot;alone,&quot; Melody and his sister decided to act on the feelings of attraction that he&#39;d noticed had been there since the Chapmans met Melody. It was something that Jeff expected might happen sometime, though he did hope that Lucy would be able to hold off on it until Cupple was defeated and no longer a threat. That way the Chapmans could return home and begin to figure out what to do with their lives in general. But Jeff wasn&#39;t going to barge in on his twin sister having sex...<br />
<br />
Though, the sound of the two of them having sex did drift to the guest room where Jeff couldn&#39;t help but hear it. The moans did carry, and he thought he heard Melody call out Lucy&#39;s name a couple of times, and that only served to get his own mind wandering. Some of it seemed to drift back to Megan and Jenny and then the fact that Megan revealed that Megan and Jenny were likely trapped by Cupple and needed to be freed of him just as much as the Chapmans were desperately trying to find a way to save their own home and their ability to live it. Though, those thoughts were also joined by some of the base measures of attraction that were there the previous night. As aside from the physical features they had as Slug Women, Jeff had to admit there were parts of them that were quite attractive and with his own transformation into a Slug Man, a part of his mind now saw them as attractive in every way... Though, some of this may have been more that Megan and Jenny were the only other Slug Women besides Melody that he knew that weren&#39;t biologically related to him.<br />
<br />
The fact that anything like that would have to wait until after they could be freed from Cupple&#39;s control didn&#39;t really enter his mind, as the sound of his sister taking her mate seemed to trigger a lot of Jeff&#39;s own enhanced libido and getting his penis to telescope out of the vent and slit that covered it. It was larger than it was when he was human and Jeff looked down to see the mushroom shape of his penis&#39;s head sliding out and forward along the soft plastic of the mattress as the shaft behind it continued harden and even prop Jeff up in the bed and to a degree that&#39;s where Jeff began to recognize what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh...&quot; Jeff moaned as quietly as he could, not wanting Lucy or Melody to know that their love making was overheard and turned him on, or at least got him thinking on other things and that turned him on. It was also something that drove the urge to stroke that member, but Jeff knew where that would lead and he didn&#39;t want to do that in someone else&#39;s home. He then tried to suppress those thoughts, &quot;come on... don&#39;t think about that...&quot; None of that really helped and he could only just lay there and listen to his sister have sex and try to ignore the massive erection he presently had that wouldn&#39;t allow him to lay on his stomach. It was only after the paired moans coming from Melody&#39;s room finally stopped after a while that things began to calm down. It gave Jeff a hint that Lucy and Melody had finished, and the quiet finally gave him enough relief that allowed his arousal to drop down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally,&quot; Jeff said softly to himself as his penis lost its &quot;hardness&quot; and pulled back within him. It wasn&#39;t long after that he finally felt sleep claim him.</p>
