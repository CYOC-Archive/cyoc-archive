<br />
Dinner was better than Aaron had expected, despite his concerns over Kiko’s culinary skills, the meal had been delicious. Aaron couldn’t help but observe Hina as they ate. She was polite and quiet, but there was something about her that felt off. Why had his family decided to take in this vixen? He pushed those thoughts aside and decided to find out more tomorrow. After dinner Hina offered to wash the dishes and quickly took them to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“So Uncle…” Aaron turned to Chisai, “…what’s the story with Hina? She said her family was killed in the civil war but she’s a little old to need someone to look after her.”<br />
<br />
The grey kitsune let out a deep sigh before answering, “She’s lost. Even if she did have a home to return to she’s not quite ready to return. You two have that in common.”<br />
<br />
Aaron looked back towards the kitchen then to his uncle.<br />
<br />
“Right.” He said and excused himself.<br />
<br />
Later that night, just as he was about to drift off to sleep his ears perked up, he heard the sounds of a blade slashing through the air. Aaron quietly left his room and walked towards the sound. It led him up the hill towards a small cliff there he saw Hina wielding a sword. She slashed and thrusted with the precision and grace of a master swordsman. But then she raided her sword high and when she brought it down a large arc of light bursted from her sword, he could feel the power of the attack, he was impressed.<br />
<br />
“Where’d you learn that?” Aaron asked, emerging from the shadows.<br />
<br />
“My Chichioya. He trained me to defend myself.” Hina replied not looking away from her sword.<br />
<br />
“From what? Armies? An attack like that would completely erase any small time crook.” Aaron said skeptically. “The way you wield that katana, that’s pretty advanced to just be something you picked up from your old man.”<br />
<br />
“What can I say? I guess I’m very skilled for someone my age.” Hina replied holstering her sword and turning to the fox man.<br />
<br />
He eyed her two tails suspiciously but relented. He walked next to her and looked up at the night sky.<br />
<br />
“So your father. Chisai said you lost your family…how’d he die?” Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
“Of old age…I…I was raised by a human…I lost him many years ago.” Hina replied quietly.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry.” Aaron replied.<br />
<br />
“It’s nobody’s fault. Humans don’t live as long as our kind…I only wish I could have told him how I felt b-before he…” she trailed off.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure he knew how you felt. Parents are like that, you don’t always need to tell them that you love them. They just know it. They will love you no matter what.” Aaron said.<br />
<br />
“Your father is alive I assume?” The black and white kitsune asked turning to him.<br />
<br />
“He’s not really my father—at least not by blood—but he took me in, raised me, taught me how to fight…” he answered.<br />
<br />
“What happened?” Hina asked, noting the guilty look on his face.<br />
<br />
“I let him down…I don’t think he’ll ever forgive me.” Aaron replied quietly.<br />
<br />
“He will.” Hina said bluntly.<br />
<br />
Aaron looked back at her.<br />
<br />
“You said it yourself: they love you no matter what.” She said.<br />
<br />
Aaron smiled slightly and turned to leave. “Wait,” Hina called, Aaron pausing for a moment. “I..I was wondering if you would train with me,” she said. “It gets rather dull training by myself.”<br />
<br />
Aaron nodded, the kintaro approaching the kitsune slowly. “Sure, what do you have in mind?”<br />
<br />
Hina looked the kintaro over carefully. Aaron wasn’t dressed like a warrior. Instead he sported at red leather coat with dark cargo pants. For the kitsune, she was used to warriors who looked more Japanese. <br />
<br />
“I’m curious about your skills,” Hina said. “You don’t look like a samauri.”<br />
<br />
“Definitely not a samauri,” Aaron chuckled. “Have you ever heard of demon hunters?”<br />
<br />
Hina nodded. Hunters were well known throughout the realms, acting as protectors. Whenever a rogue supernatural being threatened the innocent, hunters would be there to put the threat down. What surprised Hina though, was discovering that Aaron was a hunter. To her knowledge, only humans filled their ranks.<br />
Asking Aaron if he would demonstrate his abilities, Hina watched the kintaro now scan his surroundings. Finding a small piece of firewood, Aaron heaved it into the air. Unholstering his pistols, Aaron fired at the airborne object successfully striking the object in midair. As the small log crashed to the ground, Hina gaped in amazement. <br />
<br />
“You didn’t miss a shot!” She exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Aaron smirked, nodding as Hina examined the log. “Proficient in firearms,” she stated. “Are you trained to fight as well?”<br />
<br />
“Pencak Silat,” Aaron stated. “You usually don’t see it outside of Indonesia. It’s a brutal close in style. My...father figure taught me.”<br />
<br />
Hina nodded, noticing a sad expression cross Aaron’s face. When the kintaro spoke of his profession or demonstrated his skill, he appeared confident. Anything outside of that though, he seemed to withdraw into himself, a mournful expression fixing itself on his vulpine face. Not wanting to upset Aaron, and needing to distance herself from her own pain, Hina now smirked. “Care to spar?”<br />
<br />
Aaron grinned, nodding as he assumed a fighting position. Hina did so as well, assuming a fighting stance Aaron was unfamiliar with. Darting forward, the pair now showed off their differing techniques.<br />
<br />
Aaron was surprised as Hina moved forward. The kitsune did not fight like a kitsune, she fought like a human employing a combination of styles. It made predicting her attacks difficult. Obviously, Hina’s teacher was a master if the kitsune could so seamlessly blend such a wide variety of styles into one, flawless, technique.<br />
<br />
For Hina, fighting Aaron was an eye opening experience. The kintaro’s style was brutal and efficient. Moving in close, Aaron’s attacks were almost suffocating, not allowing Hina to gain any space in order to reset. The kintaro’s stamina and endurance driving Hina back, forcing the kitsune onto her knees. If Aaron was this fearsome, Hina wondered how formidable his master was.<br />
<br />
Grasping Aaron with one of her tails, Hina tried to flip the kintaro onto his back. Instead, Aaron grasped the tail his his hand, tightening his grasp as he looked to knock Hina off balance. Both now grit their teeth, the pair mere inches from one another, as they stared into each others eyes. As they did Hina now felt an overwhelming urge overtake her as she kissed Aaron.<br />
<br />
Aaron appeared flummoxed, his eyes wide before gently pulling her away. The last thing he expected was for this kitsune vixen to kiss him.<br />
<br />
“I can’t.” He said.<br />
<br />
“What?” Hina asked breathlessly.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry I can’t,” Aaron sighed. “You’re beautiful Hina. Truly you are but...my heart belongs to someone else. I...I can’t betray her like this.”<br />
<br />
“I-I’m sorry! I didn’t know—I don’t know what came over me…I just…I’ve never…” Hina stammered nervously.<br />
<br />
“It’s not your fault. I-I should go.” He said and turned to leave.<br />
<br />
“You are a good man Aaron,” she said softly. “And a great warrior. Never let anyone tell you otherwise. If you ever need my help, all you need to do is ask.” Hina now rose to her feet and bowed towards Aaron.<br />
<br />
“I’m not so sure.” Aaron said.<br />
<br />
Taking a breath, she moved closer, placing a gentle peck on Aaron’s cheek. <br />
<br />
“You are. Your girlfriend is lucky to have someone like you. Go to her.” She whispered.</p>
