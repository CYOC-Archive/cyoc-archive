<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric began his tale, taking place a few hours after he had arrived in the world of the game.  He had landed farther away from Ty it seemed, as not only had he arrived days earlier, but he arrived away from the magical forest and near an outcropping of caves that were decorated with wooden battlements and painted sheets.  Not knowing what to do, and still not fully understanding what had happened to him, he made his way into the caves hoping for there to be someone inside to make sense of what had happened to him.  Unfortunately there where people inside the cave, but they had no interest in helping him out.<br />
<br />
Deep inside the cave, he followed torches that lit up beds, furs, armor and weapons all lining the cave walls and beyond.  Brutish runes covered much of it, and as he was examining a particularly large battle axe, a massive hand grabbed him from behind and restrained him.  He said that he was ashamed to learn he probably could have snuck around undetected, but like Ty, he did not fully realize he had been granted the abilities of his character until much later.  <br />
<br />
His arms and legs were bound with rope and he was chucked gracelessly into what he could only describe as a cliche witch’s lab.  It was here he was finally able to get a good look at the people who had caught him.  Standing before him, evil grins plastered on their faces, were a group of women orcs, gigantic brutes standing nearly ten feet tall, barely covered in their furs and ramshackle armor, and each brimming with muscle.  Behind them, a smaller form walked through the crowd.  Another orc, this one slightly smaller than the others, but with look on her face that told Eric she was the one in charge.  She was dressed in robes and finer silks, setting her apart from the other of her kin.  <br />
<br />
She told Eric that he was one of the stupidest little elves to ever grace their  hideout, but they were glad he was here.  Eric listened, with confusion and a creeping terror as she told him that since they had left their males behind to raid, that they hadn’t had a good fucking in ages, and they were dying for some meat.  Eric wasn’t quite sure what she meant by that, given his current physical condition, but the shaman explained in no certain terms that he was going to torn apart to become their ‘meat’ toys.  While the orc women desired cock, they were loathe to use the shaman’s potent on themselves to grow one, as it would be a sign of disrespect to their brood partners.  As well, each of them didn’t want to wait their turn with Eric, so the wise shaman had devised a devious plan.<br />
<br />
She crafted a glowing green potion that gave off the vilest smell Eric had ever witnessed, and forced it down his throat as one of the orcs held his head.  It was the worst thing he had ever tasted, but that was the nice part of it all.  It got exponentially worse when his insides began to twist in inhuman ways.  First his breasts, which he mentioned had been quite large, shrunk down to the flat things they were now.  Then he felt an intense pressure, along with a feeling of off fullness inside his body as he grew incredibly warm.  Sweat began to pour from his head as he felt the pressure begin to rise all over his body, but it was especially focused in his shoulders, hips, and neck.  A few more seconds of it and there were several loud pops and a rush of ecstasy.  Then his head hit the other side of the wall.  And his arms and legs did much the same, scattering across the room in a torrent of cum.<br />
<br />
The shaman, in order to please her tribe, had turned each of Eric’s limbs in a detached thing with a dick head on the end of it, and a pussy where they should join on his torso.  His head got the worst, as unlike his limbs which just had cockheads, his neck had grown into a penis long enough to insert nearly all the way down to his original pussy if sheathed in his neck, and the testicles attached to the cock were as big as his breasts had once been.<br />
<br />
He was utterly helpless for the next few days, as the orc women took turns satisfying themselves with his dick limbs, returning them to his pussified torso when they were done or wanted a laugh, usually returning them to the wrong spot so he looked like some kind of twisted picasso person.  It was on the third day, after the shaman slid his dickneck out of her ass and tossed him to the floor, that he was able to escape.<br />
<br />
Over the days he had learned to control his separated parts, and could even sort of feel where they were without seeing them.  His hands where the most useful, able to scramble about with relative ease.  His legs could hop around ok, but their reach was limited. His head, much to his shock when he discovered it, had limited motion and he could use his long dick to scoot around like a fat snake.  <br />
<br />
Putting all these abilities together, he had distracted the shaman enough during their last fuck session to steal some of her potions and intended to mix them into the ale that the orcs drank throughout the day.  As the shaman left to clean up, not caring about the discarded dickneck on the floor, Eric sluggishly made moved his head out of the room and into the dining area where his left arm was posed in the ceiling on a plank of wood that overlooked the barrel of ale.  Watching closesly so that no roc saw him do it, he carefully poured the mixture in.  A few minutes later the rest of the orcs showed up, three of them carrying his other arm and legs and tossing them to the floor next to them as they sat down for their drink.<br />
<br />
Eric watched with dreadful glee as the orcs first drank, every last one of them, a full mug of ale.  The changes were quick, but effective and disabling, even more so than Eric’s.  He had found the potion that he assumed had to do with ‘butts’ and had mixed it with some other stuff he had been able to decipher.  He looked on as the orcs’s asses began to expand rapidly while the rest of their bodies shrank, sinking into their butts at great speed.  They barely had enough time to curse Eric’s name before the entire group had been reduced to a cluster of giant fat asses, jiggling angrily and hopping slightly in a futile attempt to assault their prisoner.  <br />
<br />
Eric laughed the whole way to his body, then some more as he cleaned himself off and put himself back together for the first time in days, then laughed more as he swatted and kicked the angry butts, and laughed even more as he assaulted each and every one in turn, civering them in enough seed to obscure their forms.  When he finally felt like he had gotten enough revenge, he sprinted out of the cave and towards the first creek he could find for the first wash he had had in days.  Then he started wandering, aimlessly, still lost in a strange world until he had found the road.  By that time, he was starving and penniless, so he had hoped to put his rogue skills to good use, but Ty had made sure that wouldn’t happen.<br />
<br />
Ty, for his part, was sympathetic to Eric, and revealed to him his own troubles and monstrous transformations.  Eric nodded gravely, but Ty noticed his dickneck twitch involuntarily when Ty had taken off the wraps to show his genital face.  With each having told their story, Ty and Eric decided the best course was to stick together and follow the road, but like Eric, Ty was also beginning to feel the effects of hunger too.  And so, they set back down the road again…</p>
