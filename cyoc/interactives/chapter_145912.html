<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the first time, as he slide silently through the woods, listening as Eli followed, making a lot of noise as she went, Tobias found himself feeling self-conscious. He thoughts leaping from one thing to the next, he tried to not to dwell to much on how strange he must look with the ears, tail and teeth of a dog. And, in the process of doing this, as he felt his canine cock slide from its sheath and brush nicely against the inside of his pants, he became aware of what else he&#39;d lost. Looking down at his bare feet, he tried to recall when exactly he&#39;d lost his shoes, socks, underwear and jacket. Drawing a blank, he thought, &quot;Figure it out later. For now,&quot; and his thoughts trailing off into a different tangent, Tobias concentrated on where he was going.<br />
<br />
Behind him, slowing every so often to tug loose he pyjama bottoms when they became snagged, Eli studied Tobias. She wasn&#39;t entirely convinced that he was as he said he was. She didn&#39;t believe it was possible for a person to turn into an animal and the idea of curses, to her, seemed laughable. Studying the ears on his head and the tail sticking out of the seat of his pants, she wondered how he had gotten them affixed and the manner in which he was using to make the tail wag back and forth in such a realistic fashion. Examining the side of his head, she pondered over how he might have managed to cover his ears so well. Failing to come up with any sort of answer that seemed in any way plausible, she was tempted to ask a question on why he was missing his shoes, but was distracted when she realised they were being followed by two grey wolves.<br />
<br />
Scared, she hissed, &quot;Tobias,&quot; a couple times and when she finally got his attention, she whispered, &quot;We&#39;re being hunted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not even missing a beat, Tobias stated flatly, &quot;No we&#39;re not,&quot; then, beckoning one of the wolves, he explained, &quot;They&#39;ve been my companions for the past five days,&quot; as he ran a hand through the fur of what Eli thought was the male as the one she thought might be female glared at her and pressed close to Tobias.<br />
<br />
Not really buying what she was seeing and hearing, the sixteen-year-old girl continued to watch the wolves and Tobias, wary and alert for the first sign the animals would lunge toward her. Tobias, aware that the girl was still frightened, as he could detect smells and movements coming off her that said so, continued petting the male as he watched the girl. Unsure if this was because he&#39;d spent the last five days running about the forest or if it was part of his transformation, he turned and made a motion for her to follow. <br />
<br />
Eli, after fallen into step after a couple seconds of deliberations, eventually found herself needing to voice some of her concerns. Wanting to ask why Tobias was insistent that he&#39;d been lost for five days when she knew, from online newspapers, it was closer to five months, she instead inquired, &quot;So, how long until we reach this cabin?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not even breaking his stride, Tobias told her, &quot;We should have already reached it,&quot; and looking about, he wondered why it was taking so long, as he was certain he&#39;d been travelling in a straight line and that they should have surely seen it by now.<br />
<br />
Curious to know if her brother had found this cabin, Eli worried that maybe this was some sort of elaborate ruse or something Tobias and his brother were playing at. Glancing at the wolves, then at the man, she suppressed a shudder as the thought he might be leading her into some sort of trap crossed her mind. In front of her, Tobias breathed deeply the scents of the forest, trying desperately to block out the smells coming off of the young woman.<br />
<br />
Since he&#39;d first become aware that he could smell and detect subtle things about her, it was like a floodgate had opened and suddenly he could smell a lot more than he wanted, with one thing being her sex. To his acute sense of smell, it was as rich and intoxicating as the bitch, who sometimes sent him signals of what she wished for him to do to her, that travelled with him. And with the scent coming off Eli, the strongest one Tobias noted, he found himself continuously feeling his penis slip from its sheath, the tip rubbing tantalisingly, needfully, against the inside of his pants. Abruptly stopping, he glanced back at Eli and told her, &quot;Wait here. I need to go take care of something,&quot; and before she could reply, he turned and slipped off into the bushes.<br />
<br />
Alone, shocked by Tobias&#39; sudden actions, Eli nervously chewed on her lip. Crossing her arms, she wondered where it was he&#39;d disappeared to. Noticing that the wolves had gone with him, she at first breathed a sigh of relief, then found herself scared to be alone. Thoughts crowding her mind, most about him and his brother planning something awful, Eli scowled and tried to banish these thoughts. After a moment, unable to do so, she slipped as quietly as she could in the direction Tobias had gone.<br />
<br />
Easily, he moved through the woods. Relieved to be away from Eli and the smells coming off of her, Tobias breathed in the deep aroma of the forest. Smelling the undergrowth, the vegetation and the two wolves, he found the only issue that was causing him a bit of a problem was the scent of the bitch in heat. But, since she was off a fair bit to his right, Tobias found it didn&#39;t bother him too much. After a some time, he stopped and taking in a couple deep breathes, he reached down, grasped the hem of his shirt and shucked it off. Next, he removed his pants and dropping it onto the other article of clothing, he walked naked over to a tree. Placing his hands flat, the bark feeling cool and rough under his palms, he squatted down a bit, lifted his leg and waited.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds, his canine penis slid from the sheath. Squatting a bit lower, lifting his leg as high as he could and bracing his hands so that his full balance was against the tree, Tobias soon felt the stream of urine shooting out. Hearing it splash against the base of the tree, he breathed deeply, glad Eli wasn&#39;t around to see him doing something so embarrassing. Reflecting back, he realised that it had been shortly after he&#39;d discovered his cock had changed that he&#39;d also discovered this was the best way for him to go pee, as it not only felt natural to squat down and lift his leg, but it also helped to keep him from touching the thing, which, every time he did, usually led him to feeling like he wanted to do more. Aware that he was finished, he turned, walked two or three steps away, then used his feet to kick dirt back over what he did. Satisfied, believing he was doing this to cover up his waste, unaware that he was actually leaving scent markings, Tobias went to find his pants and shirt.<br />
<br />
Eli, meanwhile, soon located where Tobias had gone. Watching as he stripped off his clothes, she at first wondered what he was doing. But then, the instant she saw first his tail, then the area where his penis was supposed to be, she found herself troubled by what she was seeing. The tail, she observed, seemed to be not only affixed to his body, but an actual extension of his tail bone. Studying how realistic the fur on it was, she soon noticed he had not a human&#39;s butt, but something that looked more like what she&#39;d expect to see on an animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a dog&#39;s backside,&quot; she thought as she watched him lean against a tree, lift his leg, squat down, then start to pee.<br />
<br />
Disturbed by what she was seeing, wondering if maybe he was right when he&#39;d said he was cursed, she stifled a noise of surprise when he turned around and she could see his penis. Having never really observed a dog&#39;s cock before, Eli found herself guessing that, if she didn&#39;t know any better, what she was seeing was the normal genitalia of a dog. The thing, she observed, was red, had what looked like a bulbous section on the end, though she wasn&#39;t to sure, and what looked like two lumps at the base, which she thought might be his balls. Watching as it slipped back into what she could only speculate might be a sheath, Eli silently turned and made her way back the way she came. When she reached the spot, she let out a deep breath and muttered, &quot;Maybe it is true, what he said,&quot; and silently resolved that, if Tobias was indeed cursed because of a cabin, she wanted nothing to do with it.<br />
<br />
The instant she decided this, a faint glimmer of a wish stole over her as she hoped Linus had come upon the cabin. Lost in her thoughts, she was alarmed when Tobias abruptly appearing, then made a motion to follow. Seeing him in a new light, Eli nodded and did so.<br />
<br />
Tobias, his thoughts on other things as he tried to block out the heavenly aromas coming from the teenage girl, missed entirely that she&#39;d followed him. Wanting only to get to the cabin and determine if her brother had actually found his way to it, he found himself troubled that it was taking so long to find the building. As it had been so easy before, and that every path he tried to take away from it only seemed to lead toward it, he tried to sort out why it was taking longer to reach it. When he finally spotted the cabin, he breathed a sigh of relief and figured he must have been mistaken. Making his way quickly toward the front door, he stopped halfway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait here,&quot; he told Eli and seeing the look of defiance on her face, and in the way she held herself, he sighed and explained, &quot;I&#39;m just going in to look around. If you care to do so, fine. Be my guest. I&#39;ll wait here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli, a need to do the exact opposite, and not at all wanting to wait, almost took him up on his suggestion. But then, looking at the cabin, her thoughts leapt back to what he&#39;d said earlier and to what she&#39;d witnessed. Scared, she hugged herself and whispered, &quot;No, it&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll wait here,&quot; as she considered taking a couple more steps back away from the building.<br />
<br />
Again, Tobias found he could detect things about her that told him how she was feeling. Breathing evenly, resisting the urge to move closer, to drop down to his knees and thrust his nose between her legs and breath deeply her sex, Tobias eventually turned away. Gazing at the cabin, unsure of what he&#39;d find, he hesitated a moment before walking purposefully toward the building. Reaching the entrance, he turned the knob, pushed the door open and stepping over the threshold, he called out, &quot;Hello? Is anyone here? Linus?&quot; then, waiting, he slowly scanned the room, his acute sense of smell already telling him what he knew.</p>
