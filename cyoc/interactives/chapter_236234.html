<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl felt a sickening chill run down his spine as Lord Skullface raised his hand once more, the air around him growing heavy with dark magic. The sorcerer’s skeletal grin spread wide, and his hollow eyes gleamed with twisted delight.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Carl,” Lord Skullface said mockingly, his voice dripping with sinister amusement. “You’ve had your fun, but now it’s time for something a little more… appropriate for your new place in the world.”<br />
<br />
Carl’s pulse quickened, his entire body tensing as he felt the ominous energy swirling around him. He tried to move, tried to say something, but his limbs refused to respond. His voice was caught in his throat, trapped like the rest of him. He could only watch in horror as Lord Skullface began to chant.<br />
<br />
“With a twist of fate and a flick of power,<br />
You’ll regress back to your baby hour!<br />
Helpless, small, and wrapped up tight,<br />
Your friend a diaper—what a sight!”<br />
<br />
The incantation echoed in the room like a dark nursery rhyme, each word laced with potent magic. Carl’s body trembled as the spell took hold, and suddenly, he felt a bizarre, overwhelming heat bloom within him, surging from his core and spreading outward. His muscles tightened, then slackened, as if his body was deflating from within.<br />
<br />
A dizzying sensation followed. Carl&#39;s head swam as his vision blurred, the edges of the world stretching and shrinking around him. His underwear began to feel enormous, the fabric slipping down his legs as if his body were shrinking right out of them. His arms felt weak, his hands fumbling uselessly as the ground seemed to rise up toward him. His once-fit, athletic form dwindled rapidly, muscles softening and skin tightening into baby-like smoothness.<br />
<br />
His limbs shrank into chubby, fragile versions of themselves, his fingers becoming tiny and uncoordinated. His legs folded beneath him, pudgy and weak, incapable of supporting his own weight. Carl let out a cry—a high-pitched, babyish wail that escaped from his throat involuntarily as his vocal cords shrank with him.<br />
<br />
The world loomed enormous now, everything in his room towering above him like a giant’s playground. The sensation of helplessness overwhelmed him. He tried to stand, but his legs buckled, sending him plopping down onto his bottom, his head spinning with confusion and fear.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Alex, rumpled around Carl&#39;s baby bottom as a pair of oversized men&#39;s red briefs, underwent his own horrifying transformation. The fabric of the underwear began to change, stretching, twisting, and thickening. The once-soft material of the briefs expanded, becoming a bulky, padded diaper. Alex’s mind was a whirl of panic as he felt his form morph—his soft cotton now thick with absorbent padding, his waistband turning into the snug, secure tapes of a diaper. He could feel every part of the transformation: the thick, crinkling material that replaced his once simple form, the tightness that pulled him taut around Carl’s now-helpless, baby-sized body.<br />
<br />
Alex’s thoughts raced, but there was nothing he could do. He was a diaper, decorated with adorable chibi cartoon characters of the Cyber Space Warriors—wrapped snugly around Carl, his friend now an infant, utterly dependent and powerless.<br />
<br />
Lord Skullface’s laughter filled the room, cruel and triumphant. “Oh, how the mighty have fallen,” he sneered, kneeling down to gaze at Carl with mock sympathy. “Look at you now. Just a helpless little baby… and your dear friend Alex? A diaper! How fitting for two who thought they could outwit me.”<br />
<br />
Carl, now no more than a chubby infant, struggled to comprehend what had just happened. His tiny fists balled up, but all he could manage was a series of incoherent babbles and soft cries. His once sharp mind felt sluggish, clouded by the instincts of a baby. He tried to speak, to protest, but his lips could only form unintelligible sounds. His body felt heavy, foreign, and weak, his limbs flailing with the uncoordinated movements of an infant.<br />
<br />
Alex, now tightly wrapped around Carl’s lower half, could feel everything—every little squirm, every slight shift of Carl’s tiny body and itty bitty baby parts as Carl pressed against his padded form. He felt the snugness of the tapes securing him in place, felt how his once-brief form now cushioned Carl, completely powerless to do anything but fulfill his humiliating new role.<br />
<br />
Lord Skullface stood above them, his cold, hollow eyes gleaming with satisfaction. “I must say, you two make quite the pair,” he taunted. “Carl, helpless in every sense of the word. You can’t walk, you can’t talk, and you can’t even control your own body anymore.” He chuckled, the sound cold and bone-chilling. “And Alex… well, let’s just say you’ve never been so close to your best friend before, have you? You have a very special role now. A shame you appear to be a disposable diaper.”<br />
<br />
Carl’s tiny face scrunched up in frustration, but all he could manage was a soft whimper. He felt the smooth, crinkling texture of Alex beneath him with every movement, the once-comfortable briefs now thick and bulky, enveloping him in an embarrassing, infantilizing embrace.<br />
<br />
“You two are stuck like this until I say otherwise,” Lord Skullface continued, leaning down to tap Carl’s tiny nose with one bony finger. “You’re completely at my mercy. And the best part? You both know how humiliating this is. And inevitably a little baby has to use his diaper, doesn&#39;t he?”<br />
<br />
Alex’s thoughts raced, his mind filled with horror and disbelief at his situation. I’m a diaper. I’m literally a diaper for my best friend! This can’t be happening! But there was no escaping the reality of it—he was wrapped snugly around Carl, completely useless, nothing more than an object for the sorcerer’s twisted game. And all he could do was wait until little Carl made a mess.<br />
<br />
“Enjoy your time together, boys,” Lord Skullface said with a grin. “I’ll leave you to your new reality.”<br />
<br />
With a final flick of his wrist, the sorcerer vanished into thin air, leaving Carl and Alex alone—helpless, powerless, and utterly transformed. Carl let out another tiny whimper, his babyish mind struggling to comprehend the overwhelming sense of vulnerability. Alex, trapped in his padded prison, could only silently endure the unimaginable humiliation, powerless to change their fate.</p>
