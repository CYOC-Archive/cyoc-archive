<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arthur awakens the next morning, ‘man, what a weird dream,’ he thinks to himself, ‘though, it would be awesome if it were real’. The boy turns his head, his eyes widen, ‘what the… it’s just six in the morning! I’ve NEVER been up so early, except if I have school, I feel totally energized… weird. Well, might as well get myself ready’.<br />
<br />
Still slightly groggy, the boy sits up in bed and climbs out of it, stretching, not seeming to notice something is off. Arthur grabs his clothes, which he doesn’t notice are in a total different style, and heads into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Arthur places his clothes on a chair and turns on the water, he then strips and walks up to the toilet to take a piss. Out of habit, the boy stands straight in front of the toilet, pulling down his PJ pants and reaches down to grab his cock, but finds nothing to grab. Arthur’s eyes widen and he looks down at himself, finally realizing, “it… it wasn’t a dream,” he whispers, then grins, “AWESOME,” the “girl” then shouts, before she feels the need to pee growing, so she quickly turns and sits on the toilet, letting out a relieved sigh.<br />
<br />
After finishing her business, the “girl” steps into the show, once again letting out a sigh as the warm water soaks her young body. “Damn… even showers feel much nicer as a girl,” Artura says to herself, “so weird, but I don’t really care. He… I guess this WON’T be the first and only time that I transform into a girl!”<br />
<br />
Artura finishes up and decides to spend the day at home, killing time by playing some video games and reading some comics, but deciding to not use the App, she only opens the App to check out the various types of transformation options, amazed at the number of possibilities.<br />
<br />
The time flies by and soon it’s 2pm when the front doorbell chimes, “I hope that’s my ticket for the show tonight,” the girl says, jumping to her feet.<br />
<br />
When she opens the door, she sees the postman standing on the porch, “are you miss Artura,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Yep,” the “girl” says.<br />
<br />
The man hands her the letter, “this is for you,” he says and leaves.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, have a nice day,” she calls after the man who waves without turning around.<br />
<br />
Artura closes the door and hurries to her room, jumping on her bed she tears open the envelope and grins when she pulls out the ticket to the show, “I can’t wait,” she says.<br />
<br />
The show starts at 8pm and the doors open at 7pm, so Artura, who wants the best seat, decides to leave at 6pm. It takes an hour with the bus to the location, so Artura decides to get herself ready at 5pm.<br />
<br />
When the time comes to get ready, Artura opens her wardrobe and pulls out a beautiful long sleeved and body-hugging dress, a blue lace bra and matching panties and a pair of blue high heels. When Arthur returned home the day before, he decided to dress in something sexy, just to tease all the boys and men at the show, just for fun. So, the “girl” spent most of the evening training to walk in high heels, which surprisingly wasn’t as difficult as he thought. Artura applies some red lipstick to her lips and sprays herself in a flower-scented body spray, she then grabs her handbag, which has her purse, phone and her ticket to the show, still amazed at the power of the App, which had transformed a shopping bag, which hung on Arthur’s door, into a girl’s handbag, his wallet into a purse and his phone also changed into a more girly design.<br />
<br />
As the “girl” sits on the bus, on her way to the show, she smiles inwardly when she feels all the eyes on her, ‘he… I must really look stunning’, she thinks to herself, ‘I must say, I’m surprised that not a single male has not yet touched me in an inappropriate way, I thought some male would have by now grabbed my butt or something’.<br />
<br />
When “Artura” arrives at the location, she is one of the first people, only a handful of people are standing in line. The “girl” smiles, ‘perfect, this will give me the chance to grab myself the best spot,’ she thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
At exactly 7pm the doors open and the people start entering, there are at least 300 if not 400 people wanting to see the show.<br />
<br />
After showing her ticket, “Artura” hurries into the hall and finds a empty seat directly in front of the stage, giving her the perfect line of sight.<br />
<br />
As the “girl” waits for the show to start, a young lady, wearing the theater worker’s uniform, steps up to her, “good evening my dear,” the young woman says kindly, “would you like a snack and/or a drink?”<br />
<br />
“Please, I’d like a Coke and a Hot-Dog,” the “girl” replies.<br />
<br />
The young woman nods, “very well,” she says, “I’ll be right back”.<br />
<br />
“Artura” nods, the young lady walks off and returns ten minutes later with the “girl’s” drink and snack, which the “girl” pays, then leans back as a man in a suit steps onto the stage.<br />
<br />
“I welcome you all to the show,” he says cheerfully, “please welcome Mister Mystic!”<br />
<br />
The whole hall erupts in applause when a second man, wearing a suit and a hooded cloak, walks onto the stage, “thank you, thank you,” he says, waving and smiling at the crowd, “thank you all for coming! Now, how about we’ll get this show started? Are there any volunteers?”<br />
<br />
One by one Mister Mystic pulls people out of the audience onto the stage, at one point he causes a man to act like a woman, then he causes a girl to act like a baby, he also causes a boy to act like a dog. “Artura” laughs and claps with along with the other attendees in the audience, really enjoying the show and having a great time.<br />
<br />
After an hour Mister Mystic looks at the audience, “before we make a half an hour break,” he says, “is there anyone who’d like to have a turn?”<br />
<br />
As the man scans the audience, his eye fall upon “Artura”, ‘man, that young woman sure is stunning,’ he thinks to himself, ‘she’s totally my type, she even seems to be here by herself, which means that she must be single. Man, I got to have her!’<br />
<br />
“Artura”, unaware of what the man is thinking, looks around and seeing no one volunteer, she decides to be next, so she raises her hand, “I’d like to be next,” she says.<br />
<br />
Mister Mystic, who by the way is 35 years old, smiles, “well, then please join me on stage. What is your name, young lady?”<br />
<br />
“Artura,” the “girl” says as she gets to her feet.<br />
<br />
“Please give Artura a round of applause,” the man then says and the audience erupts.<br />
<br />
“Artura” nervously walks towards the stairs, which lead onto the stage, Mister Mystic offers his hand to her, to help her up the steps.<br />
<br />
The man smiles at the “girl”, ‘she is so beautiful,’ he thinks to himself, he then leads “Artura” to the chair and has her sit down, while standing in front of her. The man smiles kindly, “no need to be nervous, dear,” he says.<br />
<br />
“I… I’m not nervous,” the “girl” mumbles, “it’s… it’s just that I’m not used to be the center of attention”.<br />
<br />
Mister Mystic smiles, “I understand, but it’ll be fine,” he reassures her, “now let’s begin,” the man then snaps his fingers and “Artura” immediately falls into a trance. The hypnotist grins, ‘using that Chronivac App to give me these powers has been the best idea I have had! No longer am I a laughing stock, I can do whatever I want. Hehe… all the people I have hypnotized today will keep some of the traits, that boy, who I’ve made to act like a dog, he’ll always bark and do dog noises whenever he talks and even sniff at butts and be attracted towards other canines,’ he thinks to himself. The man then turns to the crowed, “has anyone got an idea what I should make her do?”<br />
<br />
“Make her act like a Horsie,” a girl shouts.<br />
<br />
“Make her strip,” a man shouts, who immediately gets slapped over the head by his female companion.<br />
<br />
“Make her oink like a pig,” a boy says.<br />
<br />
In the end, Mister Mystic has “Artura” act like a Chicken, the whole room bursts out laughing as the “girl” glucks and pecks at the floor of the stage.<br />
<br />
After a while, Mister Mystic causes “Artura” to retake her posture, having her sit back down on the chair. The man then leans in and whispers into the “girl’s” ear, “when I awake you from your trance and announce the break, I want you to meet me backstage. You will still be under my control, but you will not notice it, you will act as though you are yourself. You’ll be open to any suggestions I’ll make and do as I say, while believing that anything you do or agree to is by your own choosing, unaware that you are under my power,” he then awakens the “girl”.<br />
<br />
“Artura” blinks, “wh-what happened,” she asks, “I… I can’t remember a thing! Have you even done anything?”<br />
<br />
The audience laughs, “that is what hypnosis does, my dear,” the man chuckles, “you’ve done great. You may return to your seat,” he then says.<br />
<br />
“Artura” slowly heads back to her seat under the applause and cheers of the audience, the “girl” feeling super confused.<br />
<br />
After “Artura” took her seat, Mister Mystic announces the break, without thinking, the girl gets to her feet and starts walking towards the back of the stage, ‘I wonder why he wants to see me in private,’ is all the “girl” thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
When the “girl” turns the corner, stepping behind the stage, she is greeted by a smiling Mister Mystic, “I see you have come,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Why did you want to see me in private, Mister Mystic,” the “girl” asks.<br />
<br />
“Follow me to my changing room, I’ll explain then,” he says, “oh, and no need to call me by my stage name, you my call me Valentin”.<br />
<br />
“It’s nice to meet you, Valentin,” the “girl” replies, “my name is Artura, Artura Collins,” she adds, sticking to her false personality.<br />
<br />
Valentin smiles, “my pleasure,” he says, “please, follow me, we don’t have much time”. He then leads “Artura” to a back room, and when they step inside, the “girl” finds herself in the changing room of the hypnotist, “please, have a seat,” the man then says, pointing to two armchairs.<br />
<br />
“So, why did you want to see me,” the “girl” once again asks, as she sits down on one of the chairs.<br />
<br />
Valentin sits opposite the girl, smiling at her, Valentin has short brown hair, brown eyes, an olive skin tone and an athletic body, he is half a head taller than “Artura”. The man crosses his legs, “oh, I’d just like to get to know you a little closer,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Artura” raises an eyebrow, “why?”<br />
<br />
“Because you are such a stunning woman,” the man says, “I want to be straight and open with you: I find you very attractive”.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, but I must tell you that you should not set your hopes to high,” the “girl” says, “for one, I am lesbian and not interested in a relationship, and I am only 12 years old”.<br />
<br />
Valentin widens his eyes, “12? You look more like 18!”<br />
<br />
“Artura” nods, “I get that a lot,” she says, “that is just because I’m taller than the average b… girl,” she says, almost letting her real gender slip.<br />
<br />
‘I don’t care about her age, with the way she looks, no one will ever assume that she is just 12,’ Valentin thinks to himself, ‘what bothers me is that she is lesbian, but I’ll fix that’. He then nods, “I must say, your “older” appearance is pretty convincing, it fooled me. Haha… I bet you have no problem being let into a bar, I bet you’ve even already tried alcoholic drinks, hm?”<br />
<br />
“Arutra” shakes her head, “I honestly haven’t,” she says, “to be honest, I’d rather not visit a bar or pub, I’m worried that some drunken guy might… try and start something”.<br />
<br />
“I understand,” Valentin says, “sorry, it was meant to be a joke”.<br />
<br />
“Oh, okay,” the “girl” says.<br />
<br />
“If you don’t mind me asking,” the man then says, “why are you so certain that you are lesbian?”<br />
<br />
‘I can’t tell him that it’s because I’m really a boy, he would think I’m crazy,’ the former boy thinks to himself, “I just feel like it the right thing”.<br />
<br />
“Have you had a relationship with a girl?”<br />
<br />
“Artura” shakes her head, “no, as I said, I don’t want a relationship just yet,” she says, “I’m only 12 and just not ready for such a thing”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” Valentin says, “but you must at least mentally compared the difference is between a relationship with a boy and girl, right?”<br />
<br />
“Artura” nods, “I did,” she says, “although I must admit that the thought of a boy sticking his cock into me makes me feel curious, I just don’t think I’d enjoy it. I’d rather be with a girl, because girls don’t have dicks”.<br />
<br />
“Is that the only reason,” Valentin asks.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” the “girl” replies.<br />
<br />
“So, you don’t really know if you’d enjoy a relationship with a boy,” the man says, “if I were you, I’d at least would want to give it a try, just to be sure if I’m lesbian, straight or bisexual”.<br />
<br />
“Artura” thinks for a while, ‘he actually makes a good point,’ the “girl” thinks to herself, ‘I mean, it felt so good when I accidentally touched my pussy with a finger, how… how would it feel like if…,’ the girl gulps, feeling her body heat up a little as she imagines what it would feel like having a cock inside of her.<br />
<br />
Valentin smiles, “looks like I’ve hit a nerve,” he says jokingly, “sorry, I didn’t mean to make you feel awkward”.<br />
<br />
“O-oh… n-no, that’s okay,” the “girl” says, “y-you do make a good point. To be honest… I AM a little curious about what it might feel like,” she then sighs, “I guess I’m not really sure yet if I’m bisexual, gay or straight”. “Artura” feels conflicted, ‘is it just the female hormones, or am I really unsure? I mean… I’m certain I am into girls… but Valentin made me doubt that,’ she thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
Valentin grins inwardly when he senses the girl’s confliction, ‘I have almost got her,’ he thinks to himself, ‘all she needs is on more little push’. The man smiles at the girl, unaware that in reality she is a 12-year-old boy, “if you really want to know, I’d be happy to help you figure out what your real sexual orientation is”.<br />
<br />
“Artura” widens her eyes, “that… that’s disgusting,” she says, “I’m 12! You must be at least 35!”<br />
<br />
Valentin chuckles, “I’m 30,” he says, “I want to be honest with you, Artura: I don’t mind your age. Age shouldn’t matter, besides, you look so much like a 18-year-old that no one will ever know that you are so young. Also, I promise to not force you into having sex with me, unless you’d be ready to take that step. No, no… we’d only go on dates regularly, either you’ll start feeling that it is right dating a male or not”.<br />
<br />
“Artura” feels torn, on the one side the thought of dating a grown up makes her feel sick, but on the other side, she does feel curious.<br />
<br />
Valentin senses how conflicted the girl seems to be, “tell you what,” he says, “Artura” looks up at the man, “how about you enjoy the rest of the show? That’ll give you time to think about my offer, then we’ll meet back her and you tell me how you have decided. I promise to not be mad or try to persuade you if you’d decide to not accept my offer. I really just want to help”.<br />
<br />
“Artura” thinks for a while, she then lets out a sigh, “okay, Valentin,” she says, “let me think this through and I’ll let you know after the show”.<br />
<br />
Valentin smiles, knowing that he has pushed her mentally far enough to make her at least give it a thought, now he simply hopes that the mild hypnosis he has put her under, will be enough to cause the girl to accept his offer. The man gets to his feet, “then let’s head back,” he says, and the two return to the show, “Artura” takes her seat as Valentin resumes the show, her head spinning as she tries to decide what to do.</p>
