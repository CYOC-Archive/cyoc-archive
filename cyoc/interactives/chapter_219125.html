<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were certain unwritten rules that Shannon and the rest of her pack pretty much knew with out even having to speak them. You do not show your tail, you do not expose your claws, and above all else, you do not run on all fours. Yet all those rules were thrown out the window when they picked up the sound of Mina&#39;s scream, a sound so faint, heard through so many walls, that no human ears would ever have been able to hear it. She did not have to give a command to the other girls, their quiet walk through the hallway of the elementary school had turned into a full sprint, which then turned into a full throat run on all fours, birthing tails and claws that dug into the linoleum floors. <br />
<br />
&quot;What.. Who are you?&quot; The secretary stood up from her desk as the girls barreled into the office. Shannon turned to her, drool dripping from her sharpened teeth, her golden eyes filled with animalistic fury. &quot;Oh God Oh God, don&#39;t hurt me, I just answer the...&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon leapt past her, throwing all 80 pounds of muscle and pre teen girl into the locked door of the principal&#39;s office. Her Beta was on the other side, but another scent was in there with her, another scent that turned her nose and caused the hairs on her tail to stick up, a bear was in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets try together Alpha.&quot; Anna touched her shoulder, already Shannon could feel the paw pads grow on her hand. Shannon responded with a soft nod, and working as one, the three shoved against the hard wood door and pushed their way through to find Mina being held by the throat by the Principal who seemed to be well on his way to bearhood. <br />
<br />
&quot;Put her down, or you have to deal with the Wolf Scouts!&quot; Kaida announced confidently, her tail swishing back and forth in excitement, Shannon shot her a disapproving look before turning her attention back to their enemy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put my beta down. Now.&quot; Shannon stepped forward, she did not even have to will it, her face gracefully pushed out, her teeth sharpened, and fur rushed down her body, it was as simple as the night before when she was first changed by the moonlight, yet now it was a cascade of beauty and strength befitting of a true Alpha. &quot;We won&#39;t ask you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Principal Steelson looked over the three pups as they shut the door and moved to encircle him. He couldn&#39;t help but laugh, causing his furry stomach to jiggle as he held his prey by the neck. &quot;Or what? You&#39;re going to chew on my leg?&quot; He laughed even harder and used his free hand to grab Mina&#39;s arm, snapping it at the wrist as easy as a toothpick. When she screamed he couldn&#39;t help but silently thank the city council for approving the sound proofing for the office.<br />
<br />
Shannon leapt with a deafening howl, her nails bit into the man&#39;s back, pulling at cloth, fur, and skin as her teeth tried to find purchase. Mr. Steelson responded by tossing Mina to the floor, his thick arms swarming his back to try and grab at the young alpha wolf. &quot;I&#39;m going to make your butt a chew toy!&quot; Kaida screamed and grabbed Mr. Steelson&#39;s leg, she didn&#39;t have her muzzle but she did have her claws and sharpened teeth, and when she bit down on his thigh, her teeth easily ripped through his pant legs, and sank into the flesh, filling her mouth with blood. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mina!&quot; Anna moved through the battle and grabbed her fallen Beta, pulling the hurt girl under the principal&#39;s desk before checking on her broken wrist. &quot;Don&#39;t look at it, don&#39;t look at it&quot; She tried to dry the girl&#39;s tears as Mr. Steelson grabbed Shannon and slammed her onto the desk above them. <br />
<br />
&quot;You bitches... do you know how much these pants cost..&quot; Mr. Steelson grumbled, holding his bloody leg as his foot grinded into Kaida&#39;s neck. &quot;You four better taste really fucking good!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon rolled off the desk and back onto all fours, she could still see stars and flashes of light from being body slammed, but none of that mattered as Kaida was turning various shades of purple as she clawed the Principal&#39;s bloody stump of a bear foot as he continued to push down on her throat. Her human instincts told her to run, her wolf instincts told her to fight, her Alpha instincts told her to kill. An animal would go for the neck, it was natural and the quickest spot for the kill, but his thick patches of fur and fat was limiting her chance to bite him, plus his hands had easily thrown him off. Instead she did something a human would do, something unpredictable. <br />
<br />
With an inhuman cry mixed with a howl Shannon ran directly at the Principal, shoving her full body into his massive belly, it was just enough to cause him to lift his foot off of Kaida and allow her packmate to gasp for air. She could feel Mr. Steelson wrap his massive arm around her body to pin her against his stomach, his other hand going for her muzzle, and at that moment his fate was sealed as she reached up with her two paws and dug her claws deep into his eyes as hard as she could, finding purchase in the soft flesh. <br />
<br />
Mr. Steelson let out a roar of pain, his arm instantly dropping Shannon as his hands went to his bloody eye sockets, he never heard Anna leap from behind the desk and rip into his stomach, or Kaida finally rise to her feet and rip into his leg. Shannon stood again, and with little indifference in her golden animal eyes moved in for the killing blow. <br />
<br />
Moments later blood caked the room along with the wolf girls as the body of the Elementary School Principal lay dead on the floor, having reverted back to his human form. Shannon blinked for a moment before covering her bloody mouth and tried not to vomit. &quot;We... we need to go, now.&quot; She ordered her stunned packmates. &quot;NOW&quot; She commanded</p>
