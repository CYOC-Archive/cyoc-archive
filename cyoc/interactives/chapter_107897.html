<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So what are these dinner plans?”<br />
<br />
“Shhh… It’s going to be a surprise.”<br />
<br />
The hulking bull took his prize by the hand, and lead him away from all the jeers and roars of the of the competition. Dan salivated watching as his victor lumbered from side to side with each step with one of the most pronounced powerlifter waddles he had ever seen, his massive size only accentuated by the 12 foot girth of his stomach. His four foot cock swaying lazily from side to side like a divining rod with each step.<br />
<br />
Lit only by the full moon and the night full of stars, the brute lead lead his cub into a park and down a an unsigned path, then along the stony bed of a barely flowing river. Dan couldn’t help himself from stopping his prize every few minutes kiss him, Dan needing to stand on the tip of his toes and Patrick needing to bend down greatly - every time their lips pressed together the feeling was electric, sensual and sexual all at the same time. He expected his bull to be a very forceful kisser, but instead it was very gentle and yielding - weird. Every time their lips met, the bull’s cock got fully hard, reaching it’’s full girth of 22 inches.. The bull leaked out pre as strongly as Daniel would ever come. The deeper they kissed Patrick made an unmistakable sound… was it whimpering? The cub rubbed his own tiny horned-up 12 inch cock against his bull, and that unmistakable sound only grew louder.<br />
<br />
As they walked Patrick suddenly stopped and stepped in front of his cub, his girth so wide he already obscured most of Dan’s field of vision.<br />
<br />
“I want you to close your eyes”.  Obliging Patrick, he held his hands in front of his eyes as Patrick led him gently through the last of the scrub.<br />
<br />
“O-Oopen then p-please” Stuttered Patrick.<br />
<br />
Opening up his eyes, Dan couldn’t help but gasp. Patrick has lead to a clearing in the forest surrounded by violet night blooming flowers. In the middle of the clearing a blanket laid out and a picnic basket waiting for the two of them. Among the trees gracefully flew fireflies, adding to the illumination of the moon overhead.<br />
<br />
The giant took his pup by the hand and lead him to the blanket, offering for him a place to sit on the blanket before taking a seat for himself, taking up most of the blanket. He had to spread his legs out extra wide to accommodate for his balls, each the size of a beach ball and his crimson, girthy belly. Sitting down, his date must be at least twice his size in height and width.<br />
<br />
Dan looked at Patrick, a few things were mistakenly different about him. His posture shrank, he avoided looking Dan in the eyes, the bravado and swagger he had all but evaporated… beneath his beard his face was an equally deep shade of red.<br />
<br />
‘My Alpha bull is blushing? For me?’  Daniel thought.<br />
<br />
Patrick picked up the picnic basket, the thing looking positively dainty in his hands.<br />
<br />
“I-I” He stammered. His voice cracking up. “I-I wanted it it-to be j-just us.”<br />
<br />
“I-I m-made you a p-picnic” Patrick offered Daniel the basket, blushing even harder and avoiding eye contact “P-picked out e-everyhing special… j-just for you...” He coughed, straightening up “my cub.” He added in his deep reverberating growl of a voice.<br />
<br />
Daniel looked into the basket and it was indeed filled with all of his favorite foods, all very deliberately presented and stored. He had no idea how Patrick knew these things, but he had a clue.<br />
<br />
He took two containers of food out from the basket, and offered one to Patrick. The container, a full meal portion to Daniel, fit into the palm of Patrick’s hand. The tiny fork in his hand looking comedically dainty. He expected his date to wolf it down, but instead it looked like he waiting for Daniel to start. He delayed taking a bite for an extra moment, just to be sure. His suspicions correct.<br />
<br />
“So Patrick. What’s it like being the Alpha bear on campus?” Daniel asked.<br />
<br />
“W-well” he stammered. His eyes avoidant “Being the president of the powerlifting, weightlifting, and wrestling club  t-takes up a l-lot of time. But it m-means a l-lot of people r-respect me. I t-tell a lot of p-people w-w-what t-to do. T-that’s k-ind of cool. I-I guess…”<br />
<br />
There was a part of Daniel that found the bull’s stammering very cute, but he had heard enough.<br />
<br />
He stood up and faced his bull, even sitting down Patrick was a good foot taller than him. <br />
<br />
“Look into my eyes” He instructed. The bull obeyed fully, his eyes like ultramarine pools glistening in the moonlight, only further accented by his blonde eyelashes and eyebrows. The bull struggled greatly to keep the eye contact, his face blushing a deeper shade of red.<br />
<br />
“You’re not an alpha, are you?” As Daniel stood over him, Patrick’s cock stirred from it’s slumber, engorging greater and greater between Daniel’s legs, defying gravity and the thick prince albert piercing hanging from the end.<br />
<br />
“O-of c-course I am s-si-- Daniel. What are you talking about. M-Me, a b-beta? You’re Cc-razy” his voice cracked under the pressure of his obvious lie.<br />
<br />
He averted his eyes again. Daniel gripped him by the braid of his beard, re-establishing the eye contact.<br />
<br />
“You’re not even a beta are you? Daniel challenged. Patrick’s eyes dialated, his breathing shallowing. With every exhale he let out a tiny whimper. Patrick’s cock now turgid and leaking pre onto the picnic blanket in response to this interrogation. <br />
<br />
Daniel saw it. Upon reflection he suspects he was seeing it the whole time. Those big blue eyes. Slave eyes. The further he looked into them, the more he could see through all of Patrick’s layers and into the person he truly was.<br />
<br />
Patrick relented. “You can keep a secret, can’t you?”. Patrick’s voice was still velvety deep, but the words carried a helpless plea. The juxtaposition between his imposing figure and his helplessness was stark. <br />
<br />
Daniel nodded.<br />
<br />
“I.. I never wanted to be the big Alpha. I’m no Alpha. I’m just the oldest son in my family. I was the biggest kid in my class. I started puberty really young, and always a lot b-bigger than my classmates, then b-bigger than almost anyone was really good at lifting too. I was the best in the c-ountry. It m-made my dads proud..”<br />
<br />
Daniel’s mind flashed to mental images what his dads could conceivably look like. He imagined two hulking white haired, former red heads. Both impossibly handsome.<br />
<br />
“I-I kept getting b-bigger and s-stronger. P-people looked up to me. F-figuratively and literally. A-at one p-point I.” He paused, looking ashamed “.. I just kind of s-started acting the Alpha. B-but it wasn’t me. It never was me. Every time i-it’s exhausting. When it all becomes too much…”<br />
<br />
He gestured to the clearing around them<br />
<br />
“I come here. Where nobody can find me. All I’ve ever wanted in the whole world...” He paused, shifting his eyes away from Daniel. Daniel, pulled on the giant’s beard braid, his eyes dialating further, behind his eyes more and more mental barriers were being knocked down.<br />
<br />
“What do you want?” Daniel forcefully inquired.<br />
<br />
The giant’s blue eyes began to water under Daniel’s scrutiny.<br />
<br />
“I can’t say it. I’ve never told anyone. Nobody can ever know” he whimpered.<br />
Patrick tried his best to put up a brave front, but it was betrayed by his eyes and his dripping hard on, now so long and so rigidly hard from even this slight gesture of domination. Daniel had no option but to straddle the red-head’s cock. “Please tell me, Patrick”.<br />
<br />
“I can’t” he whimpered back.<br />
<br />
“PATRICK. I ORDER YOU TO TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT”<br />
<br />
Instantly, something snapped in Patrick, the last thread of the little composure he had left. Daniel could see the tears in Patrick’s eyes as he repositioned himself to be on his hands and knees before Daniel. Grovelling.<br />
<br />
“I.. I want y-you to own me. I w-want to be y-yours forever. I w-want t-to spend every moment of m-my l-life making you proud, m-making you happy. B-be your p-prized bull. I need you to have t-total power, t-total control. A-any power, any power at all is t-to much for me. My b-body is y-yours t-to make however you want. M-my mind a blank slate for you t-to write. T-the owner of my s-soul, my destiny, m-my identity. M-my existence is s-serving you. I-it’s never what y-you can g-give to me, o-only what I can give to you”<br />
<br />
Daniel stood there dumbfounded by the beast pouring his heart out before him, wetting down his leg with both precum and tears. He wasn’t expecting the bull to crack so fully under a direct command. Daniel grew acutely aware of a wet spot developing just above his knee cap where the end of his rock-hard cock rested, his nipples painfully sensitive.<br />
<br />
As the bull inhaled and exhales his whimpers became increasingly audible.<br />
<br />
“I-I knew this was d-dumb. Y-you would n-never have me. Y-you’re s-so p-perfect. Y-you w-would never own s-someone like me. I-I’m so Stupid. Stupid. I-I knew I w-wanted to s-serve you forever s-since the f-first time I saw you. I f-ffigured if I was the best, i-if I trained hard, a-and w-won the competition, P-erhaps, I could be worthy of your c-consideration” He stuttered.<br />
<br />
As much as Daniel was appreciating this outpouring, he decided it was time to make it stop “Pup! Rise to your knees!” He ordered.<br />
<br />
The bull jolted upright, holding his arms behind his back as as well as he could, considering the size of his arms and his lays. His oozing cock, engorged red and ultra sensitive coming up to Daniel’s thigh now. His densely furred muscle gut and balls sticking out infront of him.<br />
<br />
Daniel looked into the bulls deep vulnerable eyes reassuringly, letting him know that things were going to be okay. The bull was letting out scared whimpers, uncertain of what was going to happen next. <br />
<br />
Daniel placed a hand over the bulls heart, feeling the thick hair covering his chest. He rubbed his hand reassuringly over it, before gliding his hands over to the bull’s pierced nipples= the tips of each easily the size of Daniel’s palm. <br />
<br />
As Daniel teased, the bull gave himself over more and more to him, whimpering and moaning. Daniel leaned in close to the bulls face, their lips less than an inch apart, the bulls eyes overcome, and tearful still.<br />
<br />
“..Sir..?” The bull quivered.<br />
<br />
“Master. I’m your Master. And you’re my big sexy beast of a slave” - and with that Daniel kissed his newfound acquisition, squeezing his nipples. He needed his new pup to know he is both very appreciated, and very much his.</p>
