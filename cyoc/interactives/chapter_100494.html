<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, I think that&#39;s enough dance lessons for one night,&quot; commented Martha Anderson, as she looked at the living room clock and saw it was almost 9:30. &quot;How do you feel?&quot; she asked Eric.<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m starting to get the hang of this. I just hope I&#39;m good enough to dance with Julie next weekend,&quot; replied her youngest son.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry son. You will be,&quot; said his father, confidently.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s one thing that maybe I should point out,&quot; said his older brother Nate, as he rose up from the couch. &quot;Mom and dad have been teaching you a lot of <i>couples</i> dances, and that&#39;s great for romantic moments. But nowadays not every dance involves the couple being so close to each other.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Eric, as everyone looked at Nate with somewhat of a confused expression on their faces.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know all their names, but there are plenty of dances where it&#39;s just basically the couple moving around together in time with the music and the rhythm of the song&#39;s beat more than actually dancing. Here, I&#39;ll show you,&quot; offered Nate, as he went back to one song from earlier on his parents&#39; CDs that they skipped during Eric&#39;s dance lessons.<br />
<br />
As Micky Dolenz announced, <i>The local rock group down the street is trying hard to learn their song</i> to the opening bars of The Monkees&#39; &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot;, Nate just began dancing around in a relatively small space on the cleared floor. He moved his arms, shuffled, and jumped about for <i>the weekend squire who just came out to mow his lawn.</i><br />
&quot;See what I&#39;m getting at Eric?&quot; asked Nate, hoping he wasn&#39;t making a fool out of himself. &quot;You&#39;re still dancing, but neither you nor your partner will actually be holding hands or even remotely touching each other, unless you decide to bump hips for some reason during a number.&quot;<br />
&quot;That does kind of look like fun,&quot; replied Eric, as he began dancing around as Mrs. Gray took pride in her roses and Mr. Green was happy to have a TV in every room, although why anyone could or would watch so much television was beyond him.<br />
Soon even his parents were happily dancing together until the last strains of the final coda echoed through the speakers.<br />
&quot;What Nate was trying to point out in his own unique way,&quot; began William Anderson, as he shut the stereo off for the night, &quot;is that there is a wide variety of music out there. We would have saved what we just did for later, because it&#39;s pretty much the easiest to learn, but there&#39;s no way to know for sure what will be on the play list until the Halloween dance actually begins.&quot;<br />
&quot;And what you get to dance to will also be influenced by all the requests whoever&#39;s there will make to the DJ on duty too,&quot; added his mother.<br />
&quot;Wow. I hope I can master it all by next weekend,&quot; commented Eric.<br />
&quot;Some of the great dance masters of our time will be the first to admit that they are still learning too,&quot; replied Martha, which made Eric smile. &quot;The most important thing to learn from all of this is that you and Julie love each other so much. Otherwise, why take dance lessons?&quot; added his mother.<br />
&quot;That we do,&quot; replied Eric with a smile. Then he thanked everyone for their help before going upstairs to get ready for bed, hoping there was still time to catch Julie in chat.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Samantha, Frances, and Ben Twist spent another hour or so well past dessert talking with Ben&#39;s new girlfriend Kenya Adaeze.<br />
Despite the kind of awkward position of Ben expressing a romantic interest in a slightly older woman, Samantha and Frances soon warmed up to Kenya, even to the point of telling past tales about themselves and Ben.<br />
&quot;In all honesty, I don&#39;t know who it was most embarrassing for, Ben or us,&quot; said Samantha. &quot;It wasn&#39;t until we were sorting laundry that we realized that somehow, one of Frances&#39; red lace bra and panty sets had gotten mixed in with the load of whites we were doing.&quot;<br />
&quot;The accident completely bleached out that set, and thankfully we all had other underwear available, but Ben just refused to wear anything from that now pink load,&quot; added Frances.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not quite true,&quot; Ben said politely. &quot;I did wear a couple of the shirts between Mothers&#39; Day and Breast Cancer Awareness month, until I outgrew them,&quot; he reminded his mothers.<br />
&quot;You are a good son,&quot; said Kenya, smiling at Ben, &quot;and you are wonderful parents,&quot; she added, looking at Samantha and Frances. &quot;You are all a wonderful family that I am proud to welcomed into, but I&#39;m afraid it is getting late and we both have school tomorrow,&quot; observed Kenya, while looking at Ben again.<br />
&quot;Can I walk you out?&quot; asked Ben, rising up and offering Kenya his hand.<br />
&quot;I would be honored Benjamin,&quot; she replied, rising as she took his hand in hers.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m only going as far as the end of the driveway. Back soon,&quot; announced Ben, before holding the front door open for Kenya.<br />
<br />
As the new couple left, Samantha turned to Frances and asked, &quot;Did we do the right thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ben&#39;s happy, and Kenya is definitely a competent and capable woman,&quot; replied her wife.<br />
&quot;I still have some slight reservation about the age difference,&quot; admitted Samantha. &quot;I know it won&#39;t make much difference to them as weres, but until Ben&#39;s of legal age as far as the normal world is concerned...&quot;<br />
&quot;Sometimes I wonder if we might have been more of an influence on Ben than we thought.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Samantha.<br />
&quot;Well, ever since his first transformation, Ben&#39;s always acted like he&#39;s never quite found whatever it is he&#39;s looking for in life. I suspect he&#39;s never been happy, at least romantically, with female weres his own age. Yet he sees us all the time as older, intelligent women,&quot; observed Frances, now in therapist mode again.<br />
&quot;You mean...&quot; replied Samantha, stopping to think about things for a bit.<br />
&quot;Whether he knows it or not, Ben is looking for someone bright, mature, and intelligent to have a long term relationship with. In that respect, he&#39;s kind of like Eric falling for Julie Stovall,&quot; pointed out Frances. &quot;They&#39;re both very smart kids too, even if they haven&#39;t quite gotten the hang of the rest of the world yet.&quot;<br />
&quot;OH!&quot; realized Samantha. &quot;I was afraid you were going to say Ben was into MILFs.&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a—&quot; Frances began to ask, when Samantha answered her.<br />
Frances looked lovingly at her wife and purred, &quot;Well... considering you <i>are</i> a year older than me...&quot; as she started running a finger lightly and seductively in the valley between Samantha&#39;s breasts.<br />
&quot;Just wait until I get you alone in bed for the night you sexy kitten you,&quot; said Samantha with a smile, before she held Frances close to her.<br />
<br />
OUTSIDE...<br />
&quot;Kenya, I—&quot; began Ben, using his right hand to express his nervous tic of scratching the back of his head while trying to find the right words to say.<br />
&quot;If it was your intention to do so, there is no need to apologize for your parents. They are both kind, loving mothers who care about you very much,&quot; replied Kenya, looking lovingly at her new boyfriend.<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t just that,&quot; said Ben, raising his head to look at her, because Kenya was slightly taller than him in normal form. &quot;What I wanted to say was that... while we&#39;ve only known each other a very short time, you have become very special to me, and I&#39;m grateful they have given us permission to date, because I want our relationship to grow and—&quot;<br />
&quot;Then be sure to thank them again once you are back inside. Now quiet, my young werewolf,&quot; Kenya said sweetly, while gently putting a finger on Ben&#39;s lips. &quot;Sometimes it is our actions, instead of our words, that fully express how we feel.&quot;<br />
With that Kenya took a step closer to Ben, and then removed her finger to replace it with her own lips.<br />
Ben put his arms gently around her, as he began to return the kiss.<br />
Soon, both lovers were holding each other tenderly as their lips continued to express their feelings toward each other.<br />
<br />
Finally, quite reluctantly, they broke the kiss; but continued to stare at each other as they remained within their partners&#39; arms.<br />
&quot;Parting is such sweet sorrow, but I must say good night, till it be morrow,&quot; said Kenya, quoting Shakespeare.<br />
&quot;Not the exact quote, but <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act 2, Scene 2,&quot; replied Ben. &quot;Although I hate how that play ends.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; agreed Kenya, &quot;but I really must go now. Our tree, tomorrow night. Seven-ish?&quot; she asked, reluctantly pulling away from him.<br />
&quot;Until then, my dear panthress,&quot; said Ben, taking a slight bow in her honor.<br />
&quot;Such a gallant werewolf,&quot; said Kenya, smiling at him even as she put her helmet on.<br />
Ben stood in the Twist family driveway, staring off into the night and the direction Kenya Adaeze rode off on her moped, long after she was no longer in sight.<br />
