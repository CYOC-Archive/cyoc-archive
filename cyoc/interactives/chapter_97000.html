<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before he could get very far Matt saw Chris, a guy he vaguely remembered from school. Huh, he remembered him as a real nerd, not the sort of guy he&#39;d expect to see in a place like Powerhouse. In the old timeline Matt and Chris had been close friends, as fellow gay nerds, but the new &#39;improved&#39; Matt would have hardly anything to do with an uncool nerd like Chris. Still, a geek like that would probably cream his pants to get some attention from a stud like Matt, plus he was kinda cute in his own way...<br />
<br />
Chris haddecided to try a night out at the club but was feeling pretty awkward, not knowing anyone there and not really finding anyone he could talk to. He was just hanging around awkwardly, and was thinking of leaving when he felt an arm wrap around his shoulders, and a hand grope his ass. Giving a little yelp at the sudden intrusion, he turned to look at whoever had just grabbed him found himself staring up at the gorgeous face of Matt. Holy shit, he&#39;d always found Matt hot but had never been able to approach him, and now Matt was here, tonight of all nights, apparently very interested in him based on his behaviour. Completely overwhelmed by the sudden attention, Chris could only blush and stammer, feeling completely out of his depth here.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hey there... Chris wasn&#39;t it?&#39; Matt smiled down at him. The guy was cute but man, so shy. What was he even doing in a place like Powerhouse if he couldn&#39;t even handle a grope? Matt thought that he&#39;d really have to fix that, and took the lead by grabbing Chris&#39; hand and guiding it onto his crotch.<br />
<br />
&#39;Like what you feel?&#39; Matt smirked, wondering if Chris had ever gotten to touch a dick as big as his. Probably not, given the way he acted, so Matt felt he was really doing the guy a favour here. <br />
If anything Chris blushed even harder in response to his action and muttered something like &#39;is this okay?&#39; Matt noticed that Chris didn&#39;t remove his hand from his crotch though, there was hope for him yet. Fuck Matt loved this, he&#39;d barely started talking to the guy and he was already being groped by him in the middle of the dancefloor, for everyone to see. God he was such a slut, he just loved letting men use him like this, and the thought caused his cock to swell beneath Chris&#39; hand. <br />
<br />
Chris seemed taken aback by this at first but gradually started groping Matt&#39;s dick a little, opening and closing his hand around it then rubbing his hand up and down the stiffening shaft. Matt moaned and spun Chris around, making out with him and massaging his ass while Chris jerked him off through his jeans.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hey babe, want to see something really good? Matt asked then ripped off his tank-top, waving it above his head before tossing it into the crowd. Matt was in his element now, Chris was clearly entranced by the sight of his muscled torso, and he could see a number of other guys throwing him looks now. Matt danced with Chris for a while, grinding and rubbing against him, occasionally fondling his crotch, which Matt could feel beginning to swell as well. Chris for his part could hardly believe his luck, and with his original urge gone was taking the chance to feel up every inch of exposed flesh. Oh yeah, Matt had definitely made the right choice here, he was getting fucking worshiped by this guy and it was amazing. Chris seemed so grateful to be with him that he was practically licking him. <br />
<br />
Matt was feeling really fucking horny by this point, and he could tell Chris was too, so he suggested that they head back to his place, it was just around the corner after all. He looked around at the guys surrounding them, considering whether to take another partner home, but decided against it this time. A guy like Chris would probably be shy enough about having a one night stand as it was, no need to scare him off by proposing a threesome just yet.<br />
<br />
Chris was practically led out of the club by Matt, holding the shirtless man&#39;s hand as they walked down the street together. He kept glancing up at him, feeling a bit dazed by the night&#39;s events and slightly awed that this hot guy had taken an interest in him. Though he did feel a bit self-conscious at being in public with a half-naked guy, he found his voice and asked Matt if he really didn&#39;t mind being shirtless in public.<br />
<br />
Matt started at him blankly for a few seconds, his brain needing that time to process the question, then responded &#39;Nah. This feels natural man, clothes are so restricting, a bod like mine needs to be on display. I love showing myself off and people love looking at me, so it&#39;s win-win.&#39; Not giving Chris a chance to respond he dragged him along, the smaller man not having a chance against the hunk of muscle pulling him, and before long they were at Matt&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Matt wasted no time discarding his remaining clothes, and was stroking himself on autopilot, apparently engrossed in deciding which brand of lube to use, whereas Chris had discovered that the computer was still on. Even if it was wrong to snoop, he was pretty curious as to what exactly a guy like Matt would even use his computer for, so he couldn&#39;t help taking a peek.<br />
<br />
What he found shocked him. He&#39;d heard the rumours about the Chronivac, so seeing one for himself was... surreal. And that was just the beginning, as he explored the menus and found out what Matt had done to himself. Holy shit, Matt had once been a normal, if nerdy, guy, just like Chris really. Whoa, could he have been friends... with Matt? It was a bizarre concept but not exactly impossible, if this Chronivac was as powerful as it was meant to me.<br />
<br />
It was when he found the changes Matt had made to himself that the really good stuff started. Matt had really gone all out making himself a dumb piece of meat, looking at these settings the Chrinovac had done an excellent job removing any bit of intelligence Matt had within him and replacing it with sex, sex and more sex. Well, hard to argue with the results, Chris thought, smirking as he looked over at the beautiful dumbass blankly jerking himself off.<br />
<br />
Chris was actually getting hard looking at the Chronivac, becoming a dumb slut wasn&#39;t the sort of life that would appeal to him but the thought of Matt giving up everything that made him... him, to devote himself entirely to sex, even if only for a couple of days, was actually kinda hot. Plus, thanks to Matt&#39;s horniness and the Chroniac, Chris was about to fuck a living sex god, and now he had access to infinite possibilities beyond that. Matt surely wouldn&#39;t mind Chris playing about with the computer, that was nerd shit after all...</p>
