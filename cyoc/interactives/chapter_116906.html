<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny and Harry ultimately made their way to the Jenkins home as they finished their day the college. There was plenty that was on both of their minds. Some of it was related to the upcoming wedding that naturally had them both eager, anxious, and terrified all at once. Some of it naturally related to worrying about Huck, as while lycanthropic healing would allow him to fully heal from the gunshot wound he&#39;d sustained the day before, that didn&#39;t mean that he wasn&#39;t in Moon Lake&#39;s intensive care unit. The rest related to the coming Skulk meeting, which when added to the other things going wasn&#39;t necessarily the thing that Jenny really wanted to do on her Friday evening.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we really can&#39;t get out of it?&quot; Jenny asked to Harry as he drove along.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... not really,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;and it&#39;s not really something that we&#39;d get out of if we were some other were. Just about every were species has its own meetings. How these meetings work depends on the were species. A few, like the Skulk, will have at least every adult member present in one place while others may divide into smaller groups... Werewolves and weredogs into individual Packs and werecats, be they male or female, into their own respective prides. And all of that then determines when these groups meet, and that&#39;s often how they organize their events and agenda... For example, Huck&#39;s pack meets every New Moon while most Werewolf packs tend to meet every Full Moon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That last one sounds a bit cliche,&quot; Jenny said rolling her eyes and then looking out the car window, &quot;I mean we can transform whenever we want. Why link things to Hollywood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe they just like it that way... or like the fact that when the moon is full the night is more illuminated,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;and for the Skulk... they meet four times a year, before Valentines Day, before April Fool&#39;s Day, before Halloween, and New Years Eve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why those dates?&quot; Jenny asked curiously, &quot;Do you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I&#39;ve always heard... it&#39;s related to the fox&#39;s place in folklore as a sort of trickster... so the meetings before April Fools Day and Halloween to put forth the ideas for pranks and the like that go with those specific holidays,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;the rest is using Valentines Day to celebrate the loving bonds that every werefox wants and wants to share...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Jenny turned back to look at Harry and smiled. The mention of the bond, which she felt quite firmly to Harry, was enough to make her heart flutter and bring a smile to her face. It felt that good. Harry only continued as Jenny smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And New Year&#39;s Eve... my guess is as a party to help set things up for the start of a new year and celebrate the old year,&quot;  Harry spoke, &quot;the meeting tomorrow will likely include a fair number of congratulations on the upcoming wedding... It may be another thing to add to the list of things to do... but it probably isn&#39;t too bad. And it won&#39;t be as if we&#39;ll be up all night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny gave a heavy sigh as the Jenkins home came into view. Harry was probably right in the sense that things wouldn&#39;t be too bad with this meeting, and given all the congratulations on the announcement of her wedding that she&#39;d gotten that it might be necessary to let everyone wish her well. A part of her even liked the idea given how friendly everyone had been to her after her transformation, particularly the other werefoxes. It&#39;d be nice to make some friends. She then nodded as Harry parked the car on the driveway.<br />
<br />
They made their way in, where they could hear the sounds of food cooking and could smell it cooking as well. It smelled good chicken being backed with rice  and some special sauce. Harry licked his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re home!&quot; Harry called as he shut the door behind Jenny, though he figured his parents heard the opening and closing of the door. He was rewarded with a warm answer as Henry Jenkins Sr. spoke from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great! Dinner isn&#39;t too far off!&quot; Henry called to them.<br />
<br />
Both Harry and Jenny smiled again and made their way into the kitchen to find both Henry and Lisa Jenkins hustling to get things ready for dinner and making sure things were ready to serve. The scent of dinner was enough to make their mouths water.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how was your day?&quot; Lisa Jenkins asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Went fairly well... it was quiet,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;Which is good. We were told about the Skulk meeting tomorrow... but there was no truly bad news.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the meeting will probably include a fair number of congratulations on the wedding,&quot; Harry added and watched his parents nod in response, &quot;as to much of the Skulk... the wedding is good news for the future. Overcoming all the problems Yvette Smith caused.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry and Lisa both sighed and nodded. They understood things that had lead to Jenny becoming a were, and thus Harry becoming a were. However, their knowledge of Harry&#39;s love for Jenny was enough to inspire happiness in their union and that sort of thing would be big among Moon Lake&#39;s weres. The biggest problem in the future was this Dieter Wilhelm that Jenny had told them all about. Henry had little real love for him thanks to his sending agents to try and kill Harry and had seriously wounded his oldest son, Huck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;ll be good,&quot; Henry spoke, &quot;maybe they&#39;ll give gifts and offer additional plans for dealing with Wilhelm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Harry nodded, &quot;though from some rumors I&#39;ve heard through the day today... it would appear that there are a good number of people who will want to help us with regard to the wedding&#39;s security. Not just Peter Talbot at Karen&#39;s request.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that WILL be good,&quot; Henry smiled as he pulled a large serving tray from the oven.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Lisa agreed, &quot;the whole town will make sure you have a happy future together... even with all the challenges that may be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry and Jenny watched as Lisa began preparing drinks, a variety of fruit juices. They both nodded. There were challenges, namely Dieter Wilhelm and to a lesser extent Jenny&#39;s family, but the thought that Moon Lake as a town had her back gave Jenny some comfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;It could mean many changes for the future... not all that you&#39;d expect though,&quot; Jenny warned, thinking of her dream just before the day had started, &quot;and might mean that my younger brother and sister could end up being here too...&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry and Lisa both blinked and looked to each other for a few moments and then turned back to Harry and Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;d want that?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If things really go south with my dad... we may have to,&quot; Jenny said slowly, &quot;Dad is old fashioned even by 1900 standards, and even if he ultimately accepts Harry as my husband... he won&#39;t take it well. Shoot... he won&#39;t take the new me, even in my human form well. That means he could potentially flip and try to take it out on my siblings.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief silence before Jenny felt Harry&#39;s arms wrapping around her before she continued. Henry and Lisa were both focused on her and looked somewhat calm but with enough tenseness to indicate that there was some nervousness as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, my older brother isn&#39;t a concern,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;He&#39;s actually been protective of all of us... to keep my dad from going &quot;too far,&quot; and he could very well accept Harry... but he&#39;s also older and has his own job lined up, based on the letters he&#39;s sent me. However, my dad could end up taking it out on my sister and my younger brother. They are the ones we may need to take in to protect... and if my dad truly flips...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d be more than happy to take them in, dear,&quot; Lisa commented, &quot;Show them that Moon Lake is a safe haven for them to be free...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though if you do go through with this,&quot; Henry spoke, &quot;both you and Harry will need to explain to them that you&#39;re weres... as they&#39;d likely run into that at some point here in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry and Jenny both nodded. That would be something they&#39;d have to share if the secret did come out, but leaving her younger siblings with a flipped out father could very well be worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Jenny nodded, &quot;but if my dad goes nuts on this... I can&#39;t leave them with him. Better to have them where they will be loved and safe than with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d be happy to have them,&quot; Henry than spoke, &quot;Now come on... before dinner gets cold.&quot;</p>
