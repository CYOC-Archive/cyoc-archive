<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now, the reason Eric&#39;s mother had arrived home earlier than expected was she had brought over his grandfather, Steven, for a surprise visit so that Eric could hang out with his father&#39;s father which neither got the opportunity to do that often. He had entered the house not far behind Carol, when she had hurried to bring Eric out of his room. By the time that Carol had been regressed into an infant, Steven had finally made it into the kitchen and sat down to catch his breath. Suddenly though as he did, memories of coming with Carol began to rearrange themselves and he recalled driving himself over to check on his eighteen year old grandson, Eric who was renting this house for a steal with his soon to be wife and mother of his newly born daughter, Carol, or Carrie for short.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in his room, Eric noticed his grandfather was sitting in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...&quot; grumbled Eric when suddenly a thought hit him. He&#39;d fixed the problem of his mother by making her his daughter... why not do the same with grandpa? I mean it&#39;s not like he&#39;d have much more to his life to look forward to, and he&#39;d appreciate the chance to restart, surely. The only question was how old to make him? Too old and Lisa would have had him too young after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Eric, when I said I wanted to make a baby, I wasn&#39;t thinking of having one this way,&quot; teased Lisa as Carol eagerly sucked from her breast as Lisa sat back on the Queen size which she now remembered getting pregnant with Carol on a little less than a year ago, despite simultaneously knowing that memory was entirely fabricated at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s about to get a little bigger,&quot; teased Eric back as he finished making the changes that he thought appropriate and hit enter.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile downstairs in the kitchen, Steven felt an odd tingling throughout his body--no doubt from having sat too long he thought. Leaning on his cane he pushed himself up from the chair, which he oddly found easier to do than normal. That was strange, he thought, before discounting it as him just having a better day than normal. Unbeknownst to him, age spots which had dotted his hands began to vanish and his skin slowly began to recover its elasticity as he dropped from his 80s and through his 70s rapidly. Joints that had swollen with arthritis began to shrink and approach something looking normal. Finally the skin and bones look of his aged years began to fade as what muscle he had had began to return to its deteriorated condition from his comparatively withered state. His vision also began to grow clearer as the cataracts which had clouded them receded, causing him to have to stop and rub his eyes as they began to take in the world around him with a sharper focus. His white hair began to recover a silver grey sheen to it as he re-entered his 60s, and his brittle bones began to strengthen as the marrow within replenished itself, his cane shrinking and reshaping itself to be replaced with a flip phone cellphone. By the time he&#39;d finished wiping his eyes he was fast approaching the younger end of his 60s with a slight pouch for a stomach but an otherwise lean frame and silver hair. The moment he left his sixties he began to no longer think of himself as Eric&#39;s grandfather, but instead as Eric&#39;s father, darker hair as black as a raven&#39;s, beginning to creep into his silver mane as each year of his 50s ticked away. No longer was Steven looking like an elderly grandfather, but instead an increasingly respectable middle aged man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what Eric&#39;s up to in his room?&quot; questioned Steve to no one in particular, now recognizing the house as his home. He slipped his cellphone into his pants pocket and began walking towards the hallway, as he exited the kitchen, so did he leave his fifties behind him. At forty-nine his hair was equal parts salt and pepper and his pouch was beginning to grow firmer into a muscle gut as his other muscles in his arms and legs began to re-inflate to healthy levels. Each step felt easier to take than the last as the odd aches and pain of working all day began to fade as he walked down the hallway, each step bringing more pepper into his hair and slight wrinkles and signs of age began to smooth over as he walked through his forties. When he reached the foot of the stairs, he was already into his late thirties with a completely dark-haired head of hair, smooth skin, the lean muscled body of a runner who worked out fairly regularly, and now thinking himself a young widower father of a teenage son who hadn&#39;t been much older than Eric himself when he&#39;d gotten Eric&#39;s mother knocked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric, I&#39;m coming up!&quot; called out Steven as he began to ascend the stairs. Each step took another year off of Steven&#39;s age as he went through his thirties and into his twenties, returning him to the best condition of his life physically. Halfway up the stairs, Steve--he began to think of himself as Steve more than Steven now--switched to taking the steps two at a time as his memories rearranged themselves again as he went from old enough to be Eric&#39;s father to young enough to be Eric&#39;s older brother visiting from out of town. When he reached the top of the steps, gone was Steven the father-figure, and now stood there Steve, the young college graduate who had helped looked after Eric growing up as they&#39;d been shuffled from foster home to foster home after their mother had died.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope my kid brother isn&#39;t doing anything I wouldn&#39;t be doing...&quot; joked Steve as he turned to head down the hallway towards Eric&#39;s room, and began to youthen further still.<br />
<br />
Muscles which to this point had thickened and strengthened now began to soften and shrink. Steve&#39;s height took a hit as his Adam&#39;s apple began to shrink and recede. The sharp angular features of his face began to soften and round, his nose shrinking and becoming more rounded as his cheeks puffed up as well. The hair on his arms, chest, and legs began to thin and grow lighter and his cock and balls which had blossomed again up until now began to take a hit as puberty undid itself. By the time that Steve had gone from one end of the hallway to the other he&#39;d gone from the college graduate older brother to the slightly gangly preteen younger brother. Steve had just arrived home from school and he had a question for his big brother about his homework, but just as he was about to open Eric&#39;s door, Steve heard a moan come from within as a banging came rhythmically as though someone were hitting something against the wall of the bedroom. <br />
<br />
With all the smart alec knowledge of a preteen, Steve smirked as he heard Lisa plowing his big brother... or was that supposed to be the other way around? Steve&#39;s knowledge of sex was beginning to grow fuzzy as baby fat began to reappear on his arms and tummy and he dropped back down in height and age into the single digits of life. Proud that he&#39;d gotten through his first week of kindergarten, Stevie with some struggle managed to open the door, opening to a sight he&#39;d never seen before and that took him a moment to comprehend as his memories once again began to rearrange themselves.<br />
<br />
On the bed, Stevie saw his mom and dad looking like the were jumping on the bed while laying down. Stevie liked jumping on the bed when he wasn&#39;t off in preschool, so he toddled over to join his new parents in what looked to be a lot of fun. He just managed to climb onto the end of the bed and get two jumps in before the next wave of youth hit him while he was in mid-air, his baby fat intensifying as his height and size diminished even further until he landed on his diapered bottom only a year older than his little sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric, stop, Stevie&#39;s got out of the crib,&quot; said Lisa as she noticed the happily babbling baby at the foot of their bed. Complying, though knowing it wouldn&#39;t be for long, Eric pulled out of Lisa and took a breather while Lisa scooched down to pick up the still youthening Stevie who looked to now be Carol&#39;s age at just a few months old. Oddly enough, scooching down, Lisa had positioned Stevie right between her legs and suddenly she felt a tingling herself in her lower abdomen as she felt weird as her abdomen began to expand a bit and felt her labia and cervix begin to stretch apart oddly enough with pleasure instead of pain--one of Eric&#39;s little enhancements he&#39;d made to this process. Suddenly, just as Lisa had reached close enough to pick the now newborn Stevie she felt something begin to slither out of her body and work its way towards her son. It was the umbilical cord, which connected and suddenly Lisa felt so much closer to Stevie than she had a moment ago as her body began breathing for him, and sharing blood with him. The umbilical cord pulled tight and began pulling Stevie into Lisa whose womb was now ready and complete with a placenta for their son. All the while, Lisa felt rather excited as all the pain that would normally come from giving birth had instead been replaced with pleasure with a click of the chronovac. Eric stood up and walked over to watch as his son, who had but a short while been his grandfather, was pulled into his girlfriend, causing her abdomen to balloon out further and expand as more and more of Stevie&#39;s body was pulled inside until with a final pop, his head was brought in and Lisa laid back moaning in what looked to be an orgasm from Eric&#39;s point of view. <br />
<br />
Hearing Lisa call out like that as her belly stretched out to the full nine months was turning Eric rather horny, but it would be a bit too soon to resume where they&#39;d left off before Stevie had climbed onto the bed, so Eric got on his knees and with a few tender strokes to her inner thigh which caused a deep gutteral groan to come from Lisa, Eric worked his way up to her swollen labia and then leaned in and began to gently run his tongue over her parts causing Lisa to gasp and clutch her swollen belly which by now had shrunk to eight months along as Eric&#39;s tongue began to encircle her clitoris. Lisa with some effort sat up and pulled herself more onto the edge of the bed and began running her fingers through Eric&#39;s already messy hair. He continued to give her oral as Stevie continued to regress through the months of development, leaving the third trimester and shrinking to the second, Lisa&#39;s extended belly pulling in and shrinking all the while until at long last she and Stevie settled at four months along and Lisa let out an orgasmic screaming that was more pleasurable than the previous times Eric had experimented with giving her oral when she&#39;d been pregnant with Carol--which he&#39;d no doubt gain even more practice as this next one grew within her over the coming months--though that didn&#39;t mean they&#39;d have to give up the main act just yet, though being as fertile as she was, Lisa was beginning to wonder if after this baby came out, she and Eric would on the celebration of being able to have sex once again conceive a third like they&#39;d had this one. She was due to find out the sex with the gynecologist this week, she hoped for Eric&#39;s sake it&#39;d be a boy. Her father had been surrounded by a gaggle of girls, and while he&#39;d never said anything, she knew he&#39;d regretted not having the opportunity to do the boy rituals with his children growing up. Lisa didn&#39;t want that same fate for Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can say you&#39;ve earned your reward,&quot; declared Lisa as she stroked his ear to gain his attention. With a final circle with his tongue, Eric pulled his tongue out of her and with a definite hunger in his eyes stood up allowing her time to crawl back in the bed so that he could climb on top and continue where they&#39;d left off earlier.  As Eric re-entered Lisa he thanked fate for bringing the chronovac into his and Lisa&#39;s lives--which would sure to be an interesting and pleasing one ever after.</p>
