<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Having another me around has been wonderful...I wonder if we can straighten out Brock as well.”<br />
A devious smile formed on the other Regina as their plan was set in motion.<br />
Regina looked at her twin <br />
&quot;You kinky girl you&quot;<br />
&quot;You know it&quot;<br />
<br />
Brock Turner is the estranged son of Lionel Sanderson the father of Regina. Lionel Sanderson was a good man and donated a lot of his money and time to charity. Regina was very saddened when he died and almost killed herself. He was also a really horny mother fucker that would bang any woman as long as they weren&#39;t related to him. He was usually careful until one night and forgot to wear a condom. 9 months and 12 paternity tests later Lionel payed off the mistress as along as she kept quiet. The mistress spent the money on bullshit and Brock became self entitled prick that mooched off of the trust until Lionel died. You see Lionel left everything to only Regina his favorite and only &quot;official&quot; child. Brock was pissed. Regina gave Brock help but he kept partying and wasting money.<br />
<br />
Sure, Regina inherited a great sum of money but she donated most of it and then earned more money on her own. Brock just parties and is an abusive borderline alcoholic asshole. She only keeps him around cause he&#39;ll go to the press and tarnish her father&#39;s name. She would hire a hitman but she feels like her father would be disappointed. The thing is he also looks and sounds like Lionel and that upsets her because he has some potential but is too lazy to use it.  However, with her now successful conversion machine (Thank you Xavier), she could be rid of a douchebag. <br />
<br />
She looked back at herself <br />
&quot;You talk to him&quot;<br />
&quot;and I will get the room ready sounds like a plan&quot;<br />
They kissed before heading off<br />
<br />
Ponytail Regina greeted Brock<br />
&quot;Hi Brock&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, I need 700,000 dollars for a new car&quot;<br />
&quot;I just got you one did the other break down&quot;<br />
&quot;No, there is this guy at the country club that has this cool one though&quot;<br />
&quot;Brock we agreed two cars per year&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah but if you don&#39;t I&#39;ll go to the press&quot;<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t dare&quot;<br />
&quot;I would by the way why are dressed up like that, got a date, I&#39;m surprised anyone anyone would put up with you&quot;<br />
&quot;Believe me someone does&quot;<br />
<br />
Bun Regina was in the other room <br />
&quot;Hello Sebastian I need room 125 set up again now&quot;<br />
&quot;Jesus don&#39;t tell me that you used project 346-x-q, Regina we still needed to run diagnostics  for another month&quot;<br />
&quot;Listen Sebastian it works&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay&quot;<br />
&quot;Regina it is going to cost you another 5 million plus 8 million in rush fees&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care about cost just do it and have it ready!&quot;<br />
&quot;Understood&quot;<br />
<br />
Bun Regina saw her twin talking to Brock and they gave glances to each other phase 2 needed to be done <br />
&quot;Oh really who would?&quot;<br />
Bun Regina hit him with a frying pan <br />
&quot;I do&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Frying pan not as refined as a syringe but just as effective&quot; Ponytail Regina chuckled <br />
<br />
&quot;So Sebastian confirmed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay let&#39;s get this asshole in the car&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way let&#39;s wear flats this time&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I call dibs on driving though&quot; bun Regina said <br />
<br />
With Brock in the backseat they drove to room 125. They kissed during red lights. <br />
<br />
With Brock on the same table from earlier he woke up <br />
<br />
&quot;Why the fuck am I here, Regina what are you doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see Brock you&#39;re too much of a liability to us and we are going to give some mandatory corporate training&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that?&quot; he said scared unable to move<br />
<br />
&quot;Hit it&quot;<br />
<br />
The other Regina turned on the machine from the other room. She then walked out and made out with herself. The two Regina&#39;s stripped down and let their hair down. They wanted more but stopped and wanted to wait for the main course.  <br />
<br />
The surgical robots and drugs entered his bloodstream.  He groaned as his bones and muscles were being cut from the inside and becoming smaller and delicate. He shrank from 6&#39;5&#39;&#39; to 5&#39;9&#39;&#39; and his fat overweight body gained a toned look and his hips reformed. Then his torso took on an hourglass form and the bits of fat reformed into D cup and he gained a firm ass. Then his vocal cords reformed and he moaned in Regina&#39;s voice. He was gaining Regina&#39;s mind and memories and he was understanding her way of thinking. His blue eyes became the same beautiful green Regina had. His skull reformed and he his brown hair became honey blonde and long. Then his cock and balls reverted back inside him and became vagina. This new Regina is happy to see her twin lovers naked and exchanging kisses.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you too got some room in there&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course perfect&quot;<br />
<br />
They got into a three-way make out session. They were in a kissing war and no one could win. They were placing hands every where it was hard to tell who was who but it didn&#39;t matter all of them were Regina. The two Regina&#39;s learned from last time and brought sex toys. Soon they were all facing each other shoving and licking dildos in there holes. It was like she was masturbating in front of a fun house mirror. They screamed their names enchaining the orgasms and ate each other out as all of them knew each other so well. They fucked for a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing&quot; all three said <br />
&quot;Okay we have to get home there is a lot of work to get done considering we spent another 2 hours fucking.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well it least we have another set of hands&quot; all three said bursting into laughter  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(Side note: thank you @afanofyourtwinningcontent, I just recently got into this site and wanted to add more twinning/cloning stuff cause I think it&#39;s cool)</p>
