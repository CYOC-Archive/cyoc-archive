<br />
The first thing Eric did when he got to his bedroom was to turn on his computer and wait patiently for the machine to power up and fully connect to the internet. Much of how quickly their house had been connected for cable and high speed internet had been a real surprise for Eric, and in the end, he figured that either William had made some calls ahead of time to make sure the house would be connected or that Moon Lake did some things in advance on its own. As in some of their lunch time chats, Julie had told him that the city had done a lot to make new arrivals feel welcome.<br />
<br />
He logged on and soon connected onto his IM account and began scanning for contacts who were already online. There was only one contact that he was looking for, and pretty soon he found the specific contact he was looking for, Julie. He clicked on the icon and typed a message to send to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Julie... the jewel of my love... how did your lessons go?&quot; Eric typed.<br />
<br />
He waited a few moments before a response came up. It read: &quot;Jewel of my love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your eyes when you&#39;re happy...  they glitter like blue sapphires, and I love you very much,&quot; Eric replied in his own message.<br />
<br />
Julie&#39;s response was only a heart emoticon.  A few moments later Eric read another reply. It read: &quot;It went okay... though I&#39;m still coming along slowly with regard to that. Stepped on my dad&#39;s feet a bunch of times.&quot; That was soon followed by a sad face emoticon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Eric typed in response, &quot;I think we&#39;re both learning and it will take time to get good...&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie&#39;s response was that she hoped so.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Behind him, William and Martha both noted their younger son&#39;s messaging on his computer. It was something they had always noticed that he would chat with online friends on various things from time to time. In the past, it had raised some fear that Eric would never manage to socialize with anyone outside the internet as of some of the issues he&#39;d had in Minnesota and that the internet would create an escape where Eric was able to find people who were interested in the same things he was interested in. However, given that they had just spent the evening helping Eric learn how to dance with his girlfriend, both of them were certain that their younger son was coming out of his shell. And based on what Martha&#39;s eyes could see as they looked in on Eric&#39;s room, she was fairly certain that it was Julie he was &quot;talking&quot; to.<br />
<br />
Both Anderson parents smiled to each other and then made their way to their own bedroom, content things would be right with the world. Once through the door frame they broke apart for a moment. Martha walked into the bedroom while William turned to shut their bedroom door. When William turned back to his wife, he found her standing next to the bed and slowly pulling down her pants and giving him the perfect view of her toned and firm rear with only her underwear covering it.<br />
<br />
&quot;See something you like, big boy?&quot; Martha asked playfully over her shoulder to him, &quot;As I seem to remember you having a bit of an interest in my trunk...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could I not,&quot; William replied as he approached her, &quot;It&#39;s on a set of wide hips... it&#39;s firm... it&#39;s toned... it&#39;s big without being too big.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha turned as he approached her and the two came into holding each other closely and engaged in a very passionate kiss. She soon felt her husband&#39;s hands drift down to massage her posterior with a gentle squeeze again. They were close enough that even without her enhanced sense of smell, she could feel her husband&#39;s member growing erect through the material of his pants and her own panties as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s perfect,&quot; William said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, sir, are delightfully naughty,&quot; Martha smiled to him and brought her hands down to begin working to get William&#39;s pants off and as she could feel her own arousal kicking in as well.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Eric and Julie continued to share some small talk on how their dancing lessons went. Mostly covering what they practiced on. They related to them. Julie did make some progress in the course of her lessons, though she was soon also a bit nervous when Eric mentioned that there would be some dances that wouldn&#39;t necessarily be dependent on each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dancing without you?!!!!&quot; Julie had typed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d still be there,&quot; Eric typed back in response, &quot;We just wouldn&#39;t be holding each other. Maybe you could come by my place after school tomorrow and Nate could handle that stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie&#39;s reply asked on why his brother was the one chosen to give the lesson.  Eric was about to answer was about to answer when he heard a very sexual moan go faintly through the house. It was muffled slightly by the walls of the house and the fact that the door to his parents&#39; bedroom was shut, but it was pretty clear to him what his parents were doing at the moment.  The sound of it made Eric look back toward his door and then sighed for a moment. In the back of his mind, he saw Julie in the pool in her full mer form, her blue eyes twinkling, and her breasts slightly larger in her fully transformed stage and stretching the bikini she was wearing that was made to fit her fully human form.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s so beautiful,&quot; Eric said to himself, feeling some stirrings in his own pants, and then looked back to his computer screen. He found that Julie had noticed and was responding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ERIC!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Eric typed quickly, &quot;I was distracted by something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By what?&quot; was Julie&#39;s response.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think my parents are enjoying each other&#39;s company... SNU-SNU if you know what I mean,&quot; Eric typed in response.<br />
<br />
Julie asked him if he was listening in, and Eric quickly answered no that he&#39;d just heard a moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Married weres tend to enjoy each other&#39;s company very much,&quot; was Julie&#39;s response on the screen, &quot;and a were&#39;s libido makes even single weres rather willing while things are just casual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even you?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even me,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;I love you so much... I can feel great longing to be with you in EVERY possible way. To feel your arms around me... to feel your love for me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I long to feel your love, too,&quot; Eric typed cutting her off.<br />
<br />
The first reply to that was a heart emoticon, but Julie then continued, &quot;but like any were... I&#39;m in control of myself. In general, we&#39;re not driven to have sex. We&#39;re just more open to it. If we don&#39;t want to have sex... we won&#39;t... and we&#39;re smart enough that even if we want to... we can resist the urge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Eric typed in reply, &quot;hopefully...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully when it&#39;s our time... that it&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Eric typed, &quot;romantic and loving.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause, and after a few moments, came a heart emoticon. Eric sent a heart emoticon back up, but then saw the clock on his computer screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to need to clock out,&quot; Eric typed, &quot;See you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Eric logged off and began to turn his computer off in connection with getting ready for bed.</p>
