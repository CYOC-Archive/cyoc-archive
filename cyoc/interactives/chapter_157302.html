<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer decided she wasn’t going to give in; maybe she could fight the curse, thinking to herself if she just didn’t do anything sexual for money then try to get money from other means to support herself like a part time job. She remembered seeing a few job notices downtown maybe she can go down there at some point. <br />
Getting up to do her morning routine before school, Jennifer was reminded that her room was now considerably smaller than before. Having moved her family now lived in a much smaller house with no maids or servants like before. Part of this Jennifer didn’t mind, she appreciated the quiet at the moment. Both her parents had left for the day, her dad no doubt trying to find work elsewhere. <br />
<br />
<br />
Stepping into the shower she couldn’t help but be reminded of her clit piercing. She completely forgot to take that out, looking at it she examined her pussy a bit more, it still felt firm and while not a virgin, she was relieved it didn’t feel loose and floppy like it had in the dream. When she thought about the dream, her mind couldn’t help but wonder to the feeling she had felt when she was having sex. Without thinking Jennifer began to rub her pierced clit getting shocks of pleasure each time she felt the metal nub of the piercing massage her sensitive region. Picking up the pace Jennifer felt electric waves of pleasure riding throughout her body. she began pinching her nipple the orgasmic feeling building and building,  flashes of her dream ran across her mind, the thick shaft riding her, the feeling of when her breasts were pierced. Jennifer soon cummed violently, cum and soapy water mixing together as it goes down the drain while Jennifer just stands their panting.  <br />
<br />
Not remembering the last time she had an orgasm that good she thought what harm will it do to keep this piercing. It’s not like anyone’s going to see it. She thought to herself while finishing up. Going back to her room she decided to play it safe and put on some jeans and a simple top. Opening the closet she gasped, the outfit she had been wearing in the dream.. It was here! Looking at the black leather skirt, white crop top and spiked heels all neatly put to the side as if it was telling her to wear it. She picked up the outfit not sure where it came from but decided it would be best to put it away out of the way… and moved the items under her bed spending a couple seconds too many contemplating what it would be like to put it on. <br />
<br />
Slipping on her jeans and simple black top Jennifer grabbed her coat and flats and walked out the door. Knowing school was a bit farther away now she decided not to chance missing the bus this time and stood waiting a early. Looking around she realised this wasn’t the kind of neighbourhood she was used too but it didn’t look completely rundown either. Houses looked okay, some lawns better off than others, if she had to guess things could be much worse and that thought freighted her.  <br />
<br />
The bus arrived and Jennifer got on, looking at the bus, it was very empty as it had yet to do many pickups so Jennifer just sat along the back waiting for her friends to get on. Maybe she could have a peaceful day she thought letting her mind drift to the hum of the engine.<br />
<br />
While still a bit tired, Jennifer began day dreaming however this was abruptly stopped as when the bus went over a pothole, she felt a spike of excitement run through her as her piercing was being pushed against her quickly catching Jennifer’s attention. She tried alleviating herself but quickly found each pothole bringing her closer to orgasm again like the shower. Deciding that the only way to stop this was by standing up, Jennifer quickly stood up without seeing her friend coming down the aisle and knocked into her. Cups of pumpkin spice lattes flying out of her friend’s hand, Jennifer could see almost in slow-motion the lid coming off and its contents flying in her direction. <br />
<br />
Oh my god I’m so sorry Jen that was my fault here take this – Britney said as she handed Jennifer some napkins. <br />
<br />
Jennifer standing their drenched in lukewarm coffee her top and jeans soaked through. Any lustful feelings had gone completely though she thought. However now she was soaked through, her clothes most likely ruined unless she changes. <br />
<br />
It’s okay like I wasn’t paying attention anyway, - Jennifer said trying not to make a scene quickly sat back down and tried her best to soak up as much coffee off as she could with the napkins. <br />
<br />
Again Jen I am sorry, though I have a spare outfit in my bag if you want to wear it, after all we are similar sizes although I must admit since your… uhm.. Breast augmentation my tops may be a bit tight. Brittney said giggling at the last part. <br />
<br />
Really?! Oh thank you, that would be amazing; I really didn’t want to have to stay like this all day. Jennifer said, almost going in to hug her friend but realising for now she was still half sopping wet with coffee. <br />
<br />
Looking around the bus, which hadn’t really filled up much, was nearly arriving at school. Perks of the early bus she guessed. Stepping off the bus Jennifer and Britney quickly made it to the school bathroom. <br />
<br />
So the outfit I have was one I was going to wear tonight at Scott Malkinsons party, but like its tots conservative and so I decided to wear Rachel’s black lace skirt you know the one she wore when her and Todd got together, supposedly it’s got good luck she giggled. <br />
Handing her the bag, Jennifer was a bit anxious, hearing the words “wear tonight at a party” made her think this wasn’t going to be good. Unzipping and exposing the contents she saw a simple red mini skirt and a white long sleeved top which had a bit of a v neck. While a bit dismayed with how revealing it was she knew anything was better than her slightly see-through wet top and jeans.  <br />
<br />
Feigning a big smile Jennifer thanked her friend and got changed in the stall. Removing her soaking jeans and top and putting them in a spare bag she then stepped into the short red skirt zipping it up on the left side. The top was another matter, her friend wasn’t wrong when she said it would be a little tight. Jennifer’s implants once again making them known as they firmly pushed back on the stretchy fabric making the v neck plunge even lower. Coming out and doing a little twirl for her friend who was smiling. On the inside Jennifer wasn’t happy she had decided to not remove the piercing and this skirt was far too short for her liking. Her friend was only 5ft 2 while she was 5ft 8 which meant a short skirt for Britney was almost a scandals’ skirt for Jennifer. <br />
<br />
Going to class, Jennifer just wanted this day to be over, she’d been avoiding the curse quite a bit, though she couldn’t help but wonder if perhaps the curse was influencing her to end up in situations like this. No longer safe behind jeans and baggy clothing. <br />
<br />
Period one and two went by quite uneventful, Jennifer had struggled to keep up in her physics class and considering everything that was going on she really had lost all interest in learning at the moment. Wanting to focus more on how to beat this curse and if she can find a way to talk to Kylie. <br />
<br />
during break Jennifer made a determined decision to go find the person that had started this all, hoping she could find a way to put an end to this. Just as she turned the corner, she was greeted by none other than Kylie himself. <br />
<br />
“Still at school and not at a strip club a see” He smirked to himself<br />
“my my, you’re dressing the part though, what you doing here? Coming to beg for forgiveness?  He said with a hint of malice in his voice. <br />
“Please Kylie I think you’ve like made your point okay. Can we please just stop this already I don’t want this! Jennifer pleaded, she knew that she’d stand a better chance if she played the victim card first, however she did have an ace up her sleeve she thought. <br />
“Hmm, tell you what, you suck me off and I’ll think about it. He said still with that smirk on this face.<br />
“No fuck you! “ Getting flustered, clenched her firsts, thinking of the words to say what was that curse, Dare or Transform! Jennifer said, hoping to put an end to this. .<br />
Kylie stood still for a moment, looking shocked he hadn’t thought about Jennifer using the curse on him. However he began to smile which turned into laughter “ Oh my you’re almost there, not quite though. It doesn’t work if you say it that way but here let me show you, Jennifer transform or dare?” <br />
<br />
Jennifer’s eyes widened realising the mistake she made, knowing she’s going to have to make a choice and most certainly doesn’t want both again she blurts out <br />
<br />
“ Dare” she said defeated, <br />
<br />
“Okay then Jennifer, I dare you too give me a blowjob in the middle of the hallway for 5$ which will boost your transition to a whore “ Kylie said smiling <br />
<br />
Feeling that overwhelming compulsion, Jennifer quickly got on her knees and began crawling to kylie. Trying to fight it with all her internal willpower but she knew the curse had taken affect. Unzipping his fly and exposing his beefy cock Jennifer began to lick the tip. <br />
<br />
“That’s right you know how to give blowjobs, how many have you given? “<br />
Jennifer thought to herself as she was locked in this routine her tongue massaging the cock as she began to take in inch by inch. She hadn’t given that many before had she? Thinking back her memories becoming slightly muddled as she now recounted how last year at the start of the high school football season she had made a bold promise to give them all blowjobs if they won which they did and she delivered on her promise at the summer finals party. <br />
<br />
“No one man could own you, you really like the attention too much, that’s why you got that tramp stamp right? “ Kylie said<br />
a slight burning sensation could be felt as Jennifer’s lower back was becoming embroiled with two doves holding up a heart. Memories of fighting with her mum over wanting a tattoo, finally deciding to get josh’s brother to do it, he was happy to do it in exchange for some action. <br />
Feeling Kylies cock tense up she was brought back to reality as she felt him explode in her mouth, involuntary sucking down every drop of cum. Making sure to lick her mouth clean. That’s when she noticed it. The crowd… She had just sucked off another student in the middle of free period about 9 or so students she knew where staring at her with utter disbelief and disgust. Britney just put her hand over her mouth and vomited in the trash. Seeing her friend like that forever tainted her opinion of Jennifer. <br />
<br />
Jennifer just sat there, Kylie zipping his flies and walking off as he gets a few high fives from the guys. <br />
<br />
Deep in her mind she knew changes had been made in her appearance and people now certainly viewed her as more of a school slut than anyone else. </p>
