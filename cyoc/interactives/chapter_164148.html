<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarge first secured a plain black barber’s cape around the youths neck. <br />
<br />
“So any big plans for the future?” Sarge asked. <br />
<br />
The youth responded, “well I’m just about to start sophomore year of high school, so I’m just trying to figure out what I want to do after high school.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, wow a sophomore,” Sarge replied feigning interest, “Do you have any ideas what you want to do after high school” <br />
<br />
“Well right now, I’m not entirely decided but I’m thinking I want to go to college and get a degree in either English or Sociology. But I haven’t committed myself to going to college either.”<br />
<br />
English or Sociology, Sarge scoffed internally. Now that just won’t do at all. No way would he let the youth continue down such a ridiculous path. No, he needed discipline for sure. Oh yes, for sure Sarge knew what to do now. He just needed to guide the youth to where he wanted. <br />
<br />
“So what type of haircut did you want again? Buzzcut, high-n-tight, flattop?” Sarge half-joked.  <br />
<br />
“Um no,” Sam responded nervously, “Just an inch trim please. I wasn’t even thinking of getting my haircut until I saw the $5 special anyway. I like it long.” <br />
<br />
“Ok, Sam, you’re the boss here.” Sarge answered. <br />
<br />
Sarge pulled out his scissors and started trimming Sam’s hair just the way he asked—only an inch trim— but while he did he began to work his magic. <br />
<br />
“So, Sam. Don’t’ you want to have more direction in your life? To have every second of your day planned for you and all you have to do is obey.”<br />
<br />
Sam glanced at him like he was crazy but the more Sarge pushed mentally then Sam began to acquiesce. <br />
<br />
“Well, that doesn’t sound like the worst thing ever…,” Sam replied.<br />
<br />
 Good. Sarge thought.<br />
<br />
“ …but I like to have my freedom.”  Sam continued which caused Sarge to frown. <br />
<br />
Sarge pushed further, “No, that is not true. You want order, you want someone to tell you exactly what to do—how to dress, how to act, how to walk.”<br />
<br />
“Yes… that sounds nice,” Sam dazily replied.<br />
<br />
“Now, wouldn’t you like a nice, short military haircut. No muss, no fuss. Nothing to style, nothing to wash in the shower. Doesn’t that sound nice? Your hair will no longer be a part of your identity.” Sarge continued working his magic, feeling that he was close now. <br />
<br />
“Yes. I want a military haircut,” Sam replied unsurely.<br />
<br />
“Which kind. Buzzcut, high-n-tight, induction cut…” Sarge ended with the last one on purpose. Now just to let that “suggestion” take root.<br />
<br />
“Induction cut. Take it all off,” Sam replied confidently. <br />
<br />
Without missing a beat. Sarge took his pair of heavy duty clippers and turned them on without any guard. The youth just obediently stared into the mirror. Then Sarge dove right in with the clippers and drove them right down the center of the youth mane, stripping it bare. He knew internally the youth would be screaming for him to stop—but it would be no use fighting him. His “suggestions” he forced on the youth were strong, but there would always be a part that would fight it. It would fight the order and discipline, but it would have no choice in the matter. He kept efficiently stripping off the youth’s hair until all that was left was a mere shadow. The long hair covered the cape and the floor under the chair, and there was so much of it it was hard to believe if was from just one person.<br />
<br />
Now as each swatch of hair was removed the youth himself was changing. His skin darkened a few shades to a rich golden tan and as the minutes ticked he shrunk slightly from an average 5’8” to a less respectable 5’6”. His face became slightly more youthful, looking like he lost a year, two at most,  and his eyes changed color from hazel to a steel grey. While he lost a year or two, his muscles started to slowly expand as well and within minutes he had biceps and a defined six pack that you would expect on a college athlete and not a high school student. At the and what remained in the chair was a shorn teenager who looked like he would excel in any sport. But he was not going to use these muscles <br />
<br />
Now it was time to continue with the rest of the conditioning. Sarge removed the cape from Sam’s neck. <br />
<br />
“Now go feel your head. Feel every stubble.” Sam immediately followed to obey, “It feels good doesn’t it? It feels right.” Sam nodded slowly. <br />
<br />
“You like the feel. The fact that it is ordered and uniform. But you want this uniformity to continue and pervade the rest of your life. Isn’t that what you want?”<br />
<br />
“That sounds nice sir, but how would I achieve that.”<br />
<br />
Sarge smiled slightly, “well there is an excellent military academy, Marine Military Academy, that will teach you proper discipline and guide you on the right path. You won’t have to decide anything for yourself anymore. You will be part of a unit, a Corps.”<br />
<br />
Sam didn’t even pause, “When can I start.”<br />
<br />
“The first day for new cadets is tomorrow. You are now a freshman. I took a year off your age so that you could get the full 4-year experience. I didn’t want it to feel incomplete.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Sir. I appreciate it.”<br />
<br />
“Now, you will be issued your uniforms tomorrow, but I will issue you something you can wear until then.” Sarge then pointed at towel which changed until a BDU uniform and shiny black military boots. “Now just put this uniform on, and you can be on your way.”<br />
<br />
Sam then stood up, and gave himself a really close look in the mirror and then gasped, “What did you do to me! Where did all my hair go! What—” <br />
<br />
“Attention!” Sarge barked and pushed with all his will to get Sam to submit. <br />
<br />
Sam assumed the position of attention and was unable to move at all. He was a cadet now. <br />
<br />
“Listen,” Sarge continued angrily, “Tomorrow you will be starting you first day at Marine Military Academy. You will attend for 4 years. After 3 years, based on your academic performance and your progress as a cadet, I will decide what you will do after graduation. There are two options—enlisting in the marine corps or attending a military college. In the summer, you will be enrolled in both summer classes and military camps. You will always wear your cadet uniform, even when you are given permission to not wear one. The only exception is if you are prohibited from wearing it, upon which you will wear the uniform I have supplied. Understood?!”<br />
<br />
“Sir, yes, sir!” the cadet barked back. <br />
<br />
Sarge noticed the cadet’s glazed look from before was gone, replaced by one of intensity and determination. Good. Just like Sarge wanted. <br />
<br />
“Now put that uniform on cadet!”<br />
<br />
“Sir, yes, sir!” <br />
<br />
He then started stripping down into his skivvies, which Sarge had changed to a military green. First he pulled on a brown T shirt followed by a pair of woodland camo BDU pants. He secured the pants with a cloth belt. He then slid the sleeves of the matching BDU jacket on and began to rapidly button it all the way. He then pulled on a long pair of dark green thick socks and made sure there wasn’t the slightest crease or wrinkle. Lastly, he sat down to pull on the shiny black boots and to lace them tightly. The new cadet found them very uncomfortable and stiff, but he wasn’t one to speak against a superior officer. He made sure to perfectly blouse his boots into the bottom of the BDU pants. He then stood up, smoothed out any creases that came from him putting on the uniform, and gave himself a good look in the mirror. He then clicked the heels of his boots together and resumed the position of attention. <br />
<br />
Sarge pulled a stack of paperwork out of seemingly thin air, “Now this is all the enrollment paperwork for tomorrow. It ensures you a place for 4 years.” Sarge paused, thinking, “Now before you go, one more thing”<br />
<br />
“Sir?” the cadet questioned. <br />
<br />
Sarge decided it was time to handle some recruitment issues, “Text your friends to meet you at this shop ASAP”<br />
<br />
The youth responded sharply, but also in a somewhat dazed manner, “Sir, how many should I text, Sir.”<br />
<br />
Well, good to see that his programming was working perfectly. <br />
<br />
“Three,” Sarge decided randomly. “Make them your most rebellious friends,” he decided to add.  That should get him started nicely. <br />
<br />
The youth nodded smartly, pulled his phone from his pocket and rapidly sent out the three messages. Once the youth finished he put his phone back away. <br />
<br />
“Dismissed!” Sarge commanded. <br />
<br />
There was no need for the cadet to be there for when his friends arrived anyway. All he needed was for them to come so he could mold them into what they should be. <br />
<br />
The cadet smartly performed an about-face and marched out of the barbershop. He smartly opened and then closed the door. On the other side of the door, he put on the cap perfectly on his head performed a right-face and then marched out of view. He quickly texted the Commandant of the academy to expect a “special delivery” and then took a second to relax and prepare for the arrival of his next “customers.” <br />
<br />
Sarge sweeped up the hair on the floor rapidly and then spent several minutes tidying everything else up that he had used earlier. Still no one. Just like before he then took a relaxed position, “at ease”, and waited behind his chair. <br />
<br />
After another 15 minutes the door opened and in walked….</p>
