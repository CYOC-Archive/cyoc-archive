<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I don&#39;t know how long I passed out but when I finally recovered my senses I immediately noticed it was already night. The living room where I was &quot;sleeping&quot; was almost dark except for the TV which was turned on while it shows what it seems a movie... Wait, oh, that&#39;s any kind of movie, it was a po... oh gosh! It was a porn! I suddenly blushed in shame while tried to look away. That&#39;s when I noticed that my uncle was sit on a couch watching that movie without too much enthusiasm. I don&#39;t know if I had made any sounds but in less than a minute he turned his sight towards me and when he noticed I was woke up, his expressionless face changed with happiness and joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re finally awake!! I almost thought you&#39;re going to be sleeping until tomorrow! You certainly remind me of your father!! Oh, when we lived together, he used to sleep until midday!!&quot; I can&#39;t fully comprehend what was happening but uncle Eric gave me a hand to stand up. I hesitated a little (I&#39;m not exactly sure why) but finally took it and got up from the ground. That simple action was the most surreal feeling I&#39;ve had in my life (at least for now) and I didn&#39;t know why. It was like I was on a slingshot, an elevator or a escalator. My head was spinning too, so when I talked to my uncle, I didn&#39;t realize I was seeing him at eye level.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you have tons of questions right now. So, let me help you to understand your current situation.&quot; Uncle Eric said while he used his cellphone to stop the video he was watching on TV. &quot; First of all, the watch in your hand (I hadn&#39;t noticed it was in my hands until he told me) it&#39;s not a regular pocket watch. It&#39;s a magic watch that I found almost a hundred years ago. And before you asked about it, yes I&#39;m way more older than you thought. In fact, I&#39;m not really your father&#39;s brother, but that&#39;s a story for later.&quot; I wasn&#39;t understanding any of what uncle Eric was saying, but I hadn&#39;t any other choice but kept listening. &quot;As I was saying, that watch is magic and I found it by accident during a travel to South Asia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle Eric. I don&#39;t get it. Why are you telling me this? Why did this thing cause such a blast?&quot; I was asking when I noticed something very odd. My voice... It didn&#39;t sound like my voice. I sounded like someone else, perhaps someone older, because my voice was definitely deeper. My uncle didn&#39;t reply to me and kept talking instead. &quot;I don&#39;t know how it works, but I realized that watch can change time and space around it. At first, just like you, I thought I was getting crazy or so. But, with further experimentation, I finally understood how to take advantage of it&#39;s capabilities.<br />
<br />
&quot;I used it to stop time and do all the things I can&#39;t do before because I hadn&#39;t time enough. When I ended up reading all the books I want and learning all the skills I always dreamed of. I started to get bored of it.&quot; My uncle had a brief melancholic look on his face before he kept talking. &quot;I felt so lonely, that I quickly understood eternity wasn&#39;t as great as some people think. I had too much free time, so I decided to live my life to the limit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why you&#39;re a stunt man?&quot; I wondered and he simply nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But most importantly, I decided to have a family.&quot; He smiled a little. &quot;I met your grandmother during a roadtrip in Texas. I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;d had tons of women before, but none of them captivated my heart like she did.&quot; After hearing that I started to connect dots. &quot;Are you saying that... you... in fact... you are...&quot; He grinned when he noticed I was realizing it. &quot;Yes, in fact, I&#39;m your grandfather...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s impossible! We were at your funeral!&quot; I was agape while he replied. &quot;It was an empty coffin. When your grandmother passed away, I was devastated. I offered her to use the watch to live longer but she refused it. She didn&#39;t want a long life but a plenty one.&quot; He had a sad smile on his face. &quot;That&#39;s when I understood that messing with time wasn&#39;t something a simple human must be able to do. So, I decided to use it one last time to become younger again and have a regular life. Of course, I hid the watch in a place where I can keep an eye on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, does my father know about this?&quot; He shook his head, &quot;But, how? Does he authentically think you&#39;re his brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it a little complicated...&quot; He told me. &quot;Your grandmother knew about it. I told her before I marry her... And when your father was born, we thought it could be fun if we become kids his age to play with him ocasionally.&quot; He smiled. &quot;After a few times, your grandma got tired of it, but I kept doing it for several years... or I must say I&#39;m still doing it. Just that now, I&#39;m doing it permanently. Your granda helped me a lot to keep the story going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, even after I was born, you were still playing that fake life?&quot; I was shocked in a non positive way. My uncle wasn&#39;t really my uncle, and my grandfather wasn&#39;t really dead... I was so upset that I almost forgot I was watching him at eye level. &quot;You&#39;ve been lying to us all this time?!!! How can I believe in you after this?!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, son.&quot; He said but I didn&#39;t want to listen to him. &quot;I won&#39;t calm down! I... I... I guess I need some time alone...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; He said before he returned to his porn movie on the TV. &quot;Would you mind?&quot; I said. &quot;You aren&#39;t suppossed to be watching that in front of me. I&#39;m a minor.&quot; He paused the video and turned his sight towards me. &quot;Oh, hoho... you&#39;re not!&quot; He smiled. &quot;Look at yourself... I&#39;m not done with my story.&quot;</p>
