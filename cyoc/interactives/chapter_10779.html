<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Angel picked up the cloth and watched Ralph carefully.   His body twisted and grew fur, his teeth enlarged into fangs, his hands and feet became paws and a tail emerged from his lower back.   He struggled against the simple rope that held him in place as he completed his transformation into a werewolf. The string lengthened into a fantastic rope of grand design.  You lifted it up and tested it.  The wolf didn't seem to like it so much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Untie me,&quot; The wolf growled at you both. With a simple tug of the rope, he fell to his side and growled evilly at the two of you.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We are heading for Medora, and you are coming with us as per your human-side's request.&quot; You said boldly to the creature who stood at attention.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The path to Medora is thick and long.  My counterpart knows nothing of the obstacles that lay in your way.  But I do!&quot; The wolf hungrily licked his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speak!  What obstacles might these be!?&quot; You interrogated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nay, unless you untie me!  I speak not of your dangers!&quot; The wolf gave a devilish grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will not fall for your deceptions, Wolf!&quot; You say, and tug simply on the rope again.  The wolf fell to his side angrily and struggled against the binding spell to attack you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you risk your lives without my help!&quot; The wolf barked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What ever dangers there may be, you would pose a larger threat than <br />
the obstacles in our path,&quot; Angel said reasonably.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd like to think that wouldn't you!&quot; The wolf said.  &quot;If you doubt what I say, then hear me now!  The maidens of Medora are coming for you!&quot; And he sang:<br />
<br />
     Dressed in white, covered in silk skin<br />
     They are deadly as any other assassin<br />
     Soft and sweet, devilish meat!  <br />
     They pleasure you from bottom to top<br />
     Feast on your sins no matter how small<br />
     When you sleep, waiting till you drop<br />
     They will curse you, one and all<br />
<br />
The rhyme made you feel dizzy.  For a moment you nearly dropped the enchanted rope that would've freed your new companion's nemesis.  But you fought the small spell that began to cloud your head and gripped the rope tightly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;These maidens did not sound so deadly to Farmer John who transformed them easily into goats!&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, The farmer had to out-wit the maidens.  True, they are not the most intelligent creatures Medora could offer, but that doesn't mean they aren't deadly.   John had powers to transform them into less harmful creatures that were more submissive.  Have you ever wonder why he didn't simply kill them?&quot; The wolf asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn't kill Sarah or Jack!  He transformed them despite them being nothing but teenagers!&quot; You said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He couldn't risk it, besides!  It was too dark, and young Sarah did have a book in her arms.   And Jack was strong and able to fight of John, so they were transformed.   But do not doubt my warnings.  The maidens are looking for you, and the Queen Mayella knows you are here in this world.  She knows of your threat to her kingdom if you should step foot inside her castle!  She cannot allow it and has sent more than just ordinary whores and soldiers to wipe you out!&quot; The wolf said.<br />
<br />
After a long pause, you took everything into account.  The wolf seemed earnest, but you couldn't simply free him.   If a maiden was heading your way, the wolf would pose as a powerful weapon against such an assassin.   You looked to Angel who was already looking to you for answers and you nodded to her that a solution had already reached your mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;If a maiden should cross our path, I will use the spells I have.  I cannot risk you as an obstacle and I've promised Ralph a share of magical water...&quot; You began.<br />
<br />
&quot;You fool!  I am the only one capable of defeating these maidens!  Release me or I will find myself cursed too!  I will not be able to defend myself after your spells fail you and you and your Angel fall under the maiden's enchantments!&quot; The wolf snarled.<br />
<br />
Another tug came from you and the wolf was sent thrice into the dirt and grass.   The three of you said nothing, and you made your way toward the mountains.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is where we can camp,&quot; Angel said as she inspected a cave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cave smells of Orc, I'd press on!&quot; The wolf growled but you threatened to tug the rope again and he quieted down.<br />
<br />
You progressed further until finding nothing in the cave.  &quot;It's abandoned.  We'll be safe from just about anything here.&quot;  You tied the Wolf's magical rope to an old tree root that sprang from the ground.   You and Angel slept away from Wolf, who guarded the entrance of the cave.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am going forward.&quot; Angel said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need rest,&quot; You insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nay, I do not!  I will venture forward and investigate the cave.  Sleep, mi lord, we will need you at full strength when you face Queen Mayella.&quot; And with that Angel ventured into the darkness, her glow fading into the shadows of the cave's interior.<br />
<br />
Sleeping on the cave floor made you toss and turn.  You dreamed of home and of Sarah.  You even forgot about all that you had and sat up in the dark, expecting you to still be in your bed.  You crawled out of bed and made your way to the kitchen for a light snack.  But there was Angel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay on the task at hand,&quot; She warned before embracing you.   She kissed you and slipped her tongue forcibly between your lips.  You were too shocked to fight back and felt your member begin to rise to the occasion.  Her robes slacked back, her breasts beginning to show.<br />
You finally drew back and held your hand up and turned your gaze from her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; You said.  &quot;No! I love Sarah!&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can be anything you want me to be,&quot; Angel said and pulled your face to her breasts.  Her aroma was intoxicating and was making you fall to your knees.  She collapsed gently onto the floor, her robes falling around her.   The light of your home passed as shadow began to take you.<br />
<br />
Scattered images of lust and love filled your mind.  You were lost in a kind of maze of temptation and had to escape.  Flesh mingled with fur as you were lost in the passion.  Angel's face stayed with you, transforming ever so slowly into Sarah's comforting smile.   None of this was real.<br />
<br />
&quot;None of this is REAL!&quot; You screamed.<br />
<br />
And Sarah kissed you again.  Your tongues intertwined and you tasted her saliva but suddenly she tasted of nothing but slime.  You pulled your face away from the kiss and found yourself confronting a strange and wicked face laughing at you.  Her narrow chin and short narrow nose, and eyes mingled with a green haze.  A jeweled crown sat on the top of her head.  Her lips curled evilly and laughed at you in a cackle.  Her eyes pierced your own and you couldn't open your eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awaken!&quot; You heard and Angel was there.<br />
<br />
At last you could open your eyes and free yourself from the evil vision.  You looked around and was glad to see the wretched cave.  The werewolf lay asleep in the opening and Angel had her arms around you. &quot;You were dreaming, master.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dreaming?  But I could see and feel everything.  It was so real, but it couldn't be.  It was so strange,&quot; You said and tried to stand but Angel held you down.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, your awake now.  Nothing can harm you, now that I am here,&quot; Angel said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; You said and calmed down and let Angel cradle you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, I have something to confess,&quot; Angel said suddenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; You said loftily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ever since we began this journey,&quot; She began and her head fell on your shoulders.  &quot;I've been ...falling for you,&quot; Angel confessed.<br />
<br />
You couldn't move, you didn't care anymore, as she slid her hand to your genitals.  She cupped your pants and kissed your neck.  You moaned in anticipation as she shed her white clothes.  She unbuckled your belt and slid your black pants down.  Your penis had risen a total 8 inches in length and she took it all in one breath.  She suckled the tip of your penis gently and bobbed her head up and down.   Your balls swelled as you felt them fill with cum.   You grunted and grabbed Angel's waist.  She grabbed your hand and repositioned it on her firm breasts.<br />
<br />
You couldn't stand it anymore and released your load in her face.  She licked it all down like she craved it more than anything else.  You found yourself drawn to her nipples and when she told you to suck them, you obliged.<br />
<br />
You knew this shouldn't be happening, you knew you wanted Sarah, but you didn't care.  Something was different now, something that you couldn't quite place.  You were shorter.   Your hands were chubbier and you were naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmmm na! Nm...., yes!  Suck my tits!&quot; Angel moaned like a petite little girl as if it were her first time.<br />
<br />
You could feel your clothes growing larger and larger, and Angel's breasts doubled in size.   You didn't care you just had to drain Angel of the milk she had.  It was the best thing you've ever tasted and you could hear Sarah moan and love you.  You were in total bliss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suck my tits, slave!&quot; Sarah commanded.  &quot;Suck them until you are nothing but a harmless child!&quot; She laughed evilly.  You couldn't help but obey as you felt your hair pull back into your head and enjoy the free-flowing milk from the maiden of Medora.</p>
