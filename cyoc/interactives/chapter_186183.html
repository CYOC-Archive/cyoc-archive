<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bortock&#39;s mind raced, but he quickly realized that there was no other choice, and finally decided to use the &#39;Submission&#39; Spell,<br />
just as the Chimera finished tearing Renux apart. He- or rather she was about to tell the bunny girl to run away first,<br />
only to realze that she was already gone. The fact that she abandoned him, knowing that Bortock was now slower than her,<br />
filled the former bull-man with a bitter feeling. She shook her head, now wasn&#39;t the time to tink about this.<br />
Bortock used the spell, while looking at the Chimera that had started to approach,<br />
only to noticed that her body had suddenly started dancing, no longer responding to what she was telling it to do.<br />
The seductive swaying of her body made the former male flush, but there was nothing she could do to make it stop.<br />
She could only watch as the horrible beast approached her, now seemingly interested in more than ripping her apart.<br />
Bortock looked at the horrible, blood-drenched, vile, nature-defying, abominable, sexy beast as it approched.<br />
&#39;Wait, sexy? Why do i think that this thing is...&#39; Her thoughts drifted off as she watched the Chimera approach.<br />
For some reason, Bortock no longer saw the monster as a horrible creature that might kill her,<br />
but as something she wanted to be closer to. She wanted the beast to wrap it&#39;s muscular body around her and protect her.<br />
Bortock felt like she was growing weaker as the beast approached, as if she was a fragile thing in need of protection.<br />
She realized that this might be a side effect of her constitution being swapped with her wisdom.<br />
The Chimera had now reached her, sniffing her body, wich had stopped moving. She was wondering what would happen next,<br />
when her body suddenly moved again, and made her lie on her back, grabbing her tighs with her hands and spreading her legs.<br />
The Chimera took the invitation and moved over Bortock, aiming it&#39;s growing member at her sex, wich was quickly becoming wet.<br />
&#39;I&#39;m only submitting to this beast because i have to, i can&#39;t let the side effect of the spell get to me!&#39; Bortock had steeled her mind,<br />
she was certain that she could overcome the spell&#39;s effects, especially with her increased wisdom.<br />
The monster slowly started to thrust it&#39;s shaft into Bortock, almost gentle in it&#39;s approach, despite the fact that it had just finished tearing someone into pieces and was still covered in the sorcerer&#39;s blood.<br />
&#39;It&#39;s really doing it.&#39; Bortock clenched her teeth. &#39;Why does it feel so good? I don&#39;t want this horrible, disgusting... strong...&#39;<br />
She moaned lightly. &#39;Dammit! Get it together! The only reason you&#39;re doing it with this beast is because you want to get away in one piece!&#39;<br />
Bortock tried to deny the pleasure she was feeling, but couldn&#39;t stop a few more gasping moans from escaping her lips.<br />
&#39;That&#39;s the only reason i&#39;m letting this, big, brutish.. dominant alpha male have his way with me!&#39; The thoughts running through Bortock&#39;s mind had started to turn lewd, before she stopped herself again &#39;No, no, no! That&#39;s not what i meant!&#39;<br />
The chaotic thoughts running through her mind finally stopped, when the Chimera suddenly thrust the rest of it&#39;s member into her.<br />
Bortock meaned loudly, no longer able to suppress her voice. &quot;Yes! Breed me! Give me your cubs!&quot; She was startled by her own words.<br />
&#39;What am i saying?! That can&#39;t be what i really want... right?&#39; Despite what she was thinking, Bortock&#39;s limbs suddenly wrapped around<br />
the Chimera, clinging to it like her life depended on it. &quot;Please, harder! Make me yours!&quot; Her words seemed to rouse the beast,<br />
making it thrust harder and faster, until it was hammering into the bull-turned-cow.<br />
The room was filled with Bortock&#39;s loud moans and incoherent obscenities. Her mind was too clouded with lust to form thoughts.<br />
She didn&#39;t know how long it took, but the Chimera finished with a loud roar, painting her insides with it&#39;s seed,<br />
before protectively lying down on top of her.<br />
She didn&#39;t know why, but having this giant monster on her made her feel safe. She stroked the resting monster&#39;s side and closed her eyes.<br />
She could feel a deep connection to it, as if they had become a part of one another. Bortock listened to the Chimera&#39;s strong heartbeat.<br />
This was her mate. He would keep her safe and stay by her side. Perhaps she could even bear his cubs one day, thanks to her fertility skill.<br />
She felt like she was about to fall asleep, pressed underneath her mate&#39;s powerful body, when she heard a ping.<br />
Bortock reluctantly opened her eyes and looked at her status to see what changed.<br />

It will protect you, now that you can no longer do so yourself. But where will you go now?<br />
:::<br />
<br />
<br />
Bartock was surprised at the Chimera&#39;s high level. It was by far the most powerful creature she had ever seen,<br />
and most likely the reason why Renux had been free to do as he pleased until now.<br />
She closed her eyes again and fell into deep thought. Barto-ALEX was now fairly certain that this wasn&#39;t just a game.<br />
He considered everything that happened and everything he felt until now.<br />
This wasn&#39;t a game. No game would be able to adapt like this or make him feel the things he&#39;d felt.<br />
Bartock wasn&#39;t just a character he&#39;d made. This was his life now. Alex hadn&#39;t been hilling to accept that until now,<br />
because it seemed too far fetched. The thought had crossed his mind before, but he dismissed it,<br />
thinking he&#39;d just read too many isekai stories, but he was certain now that he had been right.<br />
Alex was Bartock now. This wasn&#39;t a game. He&#39;d been raped and changed against his will.<br />
And now he had to somehow make a new life for himself, because no one would believe that this weak cow-woman was actually the proud and mighty Bortock. She couldn&#39;t return to her tribe, had nothing to her name and knew little about this world.<br />
She felt like she was about to cry, when she felt the Chimera shift to it&#39;s side, so that it could cradle her possessively.<br />
It could feel what she felt, even if it didn&#39;t know why she felt that way. She pressed herself into it&#39;s embrace.<br />
She was&#39;t alone. She had someone to rely on.<br />
Bortock fell asleep pressed up against the beast, exhausted by everything that had happened.</p>
