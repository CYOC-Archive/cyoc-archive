<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Thank God for the internet!” Will exclaimed as she finished a touch of blusher on Sam’s face. A quick Google of styling online gave them some reference pics and tutorials and they’d been away. They both felt ridiculous but at least looked now like they’d put in the effort. Sam was much plainer with the choices, whilst Will after a slight mistake had gone for very dark eye shadow giving her a panda look. She had no idea how it would go over but it was passable and easily done with little that could go wrong.<br />
<br />
As they put the finishing touches on Sam the doorbell downstairs rang and they both froze.<br />
<br />
“That’s them” Will muttered under her breathe. “I wonder who they are.”<br />
<br />
“Your Mom said Mike and Jim. Does she mean Mike and Jim from the Krusaders?” Will thought about it. The only pair of guys she knew of called Mike and Jim were indeed the two guys from the Krusaders, a lame Indy band that entered every talent show and event the school had to offer. They weren’t that brilliant but were determined to make a career out of it and blow off school if necessary.  They weren’t that athletic or anything, preferring skinny jeans and beanies to the more acceptable look. Truth be told they were quite similar to Sam and her before this all happened, at least in appearance. <br />
<br />
She suddenly remembered something and spinning round let her eyes dart about the place until it settled on the point on the walls she’d been looking for. There, the poster she’d seen behind her in the mirror, it was of the ‘Krusaders’ with Mike and Jim standing proud in the foreground. ‘Oh God’ she thought to herself as various thoughts about the situation darted across her mind. <br />
<br />
Pulling herself together she took a deep breath and pulled Sam to her feet. “Here we go. Whatever you do, act natural. We have to just go with the flow and pretend like nothing’s changed.”<br />
<br />
“How can we act natural if we don’t know what natural is?” Sam protested as Will dragged her to the door.<br />
<br />
“Shut up will you, just play it cool. We’ll think of something.”<br />
<br />
Sam conceded and was led out of the door down the hallway. “I hope the other guys are okay.” She muttered to herself.<br />
<br />
Downstairs Mike and Jim waited in the lounge whilst Will’s mom bustled about the place doing various chores. Mike glanced over to Jim and just shrugged. “Women” he said matter-of-factly as they waited for the two girls. It would have been interesting for him to know that those ‘women’ had not been so a mere few hours ago. <br />
<br />
Jim and Mike had met them after a concert once where the skater’s had been. The band took a few sarcastic comments and got into a bit of cursing war with the group. It was all in good fun but it did give the guys a chance to talk to the girls, if only to make rude jokes about their skate boarding. Mike had taken the first plunge and had attended a competition Will and the other had been entered in. He was mildly interested and had just come along to check it out but on the way out he had been caught by Will who, curious about what he was doing there, began to interrogate him. After attempting to dodge a few questions he jumped off the deep end and kissed her. He didn’t know why he’d done it, it was just a quick stupid thing, except that it wasn’t quick, and it wasn’t stupid. Will just kept locked with him, and they’d pretty much been locked together ever since. Jim was the nerdier member of the band and he asking Sam out came much later at a party similar to the one they were going to. He was very drunk which, far from making him make a stupid decision, actually gave him the courage to make the right one.<br />
<br />
Jim sat looking nervous about tonight. They’d been going out for a while and Mike had been telling him tonight might be the night. He wanted it to be, but knew Sam might not yet be ready. He didn’t want to ruin things with her; he cared too much about her to force himself on her like that. Mike and Will had already apparently made plans to this effect and Mike was pretty excited about it. Will and he had been going steady for much longer, but as far as he knew they hadn’t hooked up properly yet, but they were far more outgoing and confident so he had no doubt that they’d already arranged everything.<br />
<br />
Footsteps from upstairs brought their attention away from their own thoughts and they moved their eyes to the top of the stairs. The site that greeted them was two very attractive, very cute girls, who strutted gracefully down the stairs. Will had a confident grin on her face, only to hide the complete terror and confusion going on behind it, whilst Sam who followed her was not hiding her discomfort as easily. Will arrived at the bottom of the stairs and looked at the two guys with a grin. “Well?” she offered.<br />
<br />
“Babe, you look fantastic” Mike said rising and walking over to her. ‘Well that at least answers which one is for each of us’ Will thought. He wrapped his hand around her waist and pulled her closer. Shocked by the manoeuvre Will fell forward opening her mouth to protest but before she could felt her lips locked with Mike’s. She felt his tongue probe hers and she wanted to fight back, but the feeling of being held in his arms and pressing her body up against his caused her to instead fight back with her tongue. Mike eventually surfaced for air, allowing Will to gather her composure and figure out if what just happened actually just happened. Sam just stood agape and Jim reached out to simply hold her hand.<br />
<br />
“Come on girls, you’re going to be late.” Will’s mom finally chirped from the other room.<br />
<br />
Embarrassed about being interrupted Will grunted before simply turning and saying. “Go to hell mom.” Had she been a guy she’d have done exactly the same thing but instantly realizing what she’d said glanced around at the other guys for a reaction. No one seemed to take any notice so clearly Mike and Jim were used to the same Willow as Will. That made things easier at least but Will still felt uncomfortable about Mike checking out her body. She hoped he didn’t have any funny ideas about tonight.</p>
