<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pressured to make a quick decision, Brian shook his head.  &quot;No thanks.&quot;  Without time to really think about it, he was not going to leap at a chance to become an animal.  Anyway, it appeared that getting turned into a horse or other beast was easy in this world.  And Dar had been a little evasive when he answered Brain&#39;s questions.  What did &#39;mostly&#39; mean?  Or being an &#39;incredibly smart Shire stallion&#39;?  It sure did not sound like Brian would be all there any more.  Maybe Mike was OK with losing  intelligence, but Brian did not want to just be a smart animal.<br />
<br />
That did not mean Brian wasn&#39;t fascinated to watch his friend change.  Mike pushed forward over the mare&#39;s back, scoring a direct hit on the slick black lips of her cunt.  The pleasure was obvious on the centaur&#39;s face as he pushed his swollen cock deep, and the mare whinnied in her own sexual sensations.  Brian shivered as a thrill shot through him, eyes wide as his friend began to change again.  Dar&#39;s warm, dirty arms were draped around his shoulders, keeping his back against the older boy&#39;s chest.  The embrace was both protective and intimate, and combined with the intense experience of watching Mike transform, caused Brian&#39;s small elven male parts to stiffen.  It was quickly obvious to him that Dar was having a similar reaction, the teen&#39;s enormous sexual equipment becoming a thick, hard prod.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s face was pushing out into a muzzle, nose flaring into velvet nostrils, and his lips thickened and opened deeper.  Each powerful thrust seemed to draw humanity out, shrinking the centaur&#39;s arms and collapsing the shoulders and chest.  His head was thickening, getting larger and heavier, and dropping down as it appeared to absorb Mike&#39;s neck.   But no - the centaur&#39;s entire upper body, the powerful centaur torso, was a neck now, thick and muscular, pushing Mike&#39;s equine head forward.  Glossy black hide swept up to cover rippling muscles.  Mike&#39;s arms dwindled into misshapen sticks that drew in to become bumps on the slick hide, and then vanished completely.<br />
<br />
Dar&#39;s arms tightened around Brian&#39;s chest, pulling him tight against the teen&#39;s sweaty chest with a  grunt.   The elf was flushed and sweating himself, just as erect as Dar, and felt tugging as the teen tried to remove Brian&#39;s tunic and loincloth.  Though he was still mesmerized by the transformation magic, Brian&#39;s hands and legs seemed to cooperate on their own, and he was naked in seconds.  Dar must have already dropped his scrap of a loincloth, for the teen&#39;s enormous shaft slid between Brian&#39;s legs and lifted him up.  This was wrong, this was twisted.  Yet as Brian watched Mike slow his thrusts for the final release, the last traces of his friend&#39;s eyes swallowed up into the liquid brown orbs of a horse, he clamped his sweat-slick thighs around Dar&#39;s massive cock and felt his own orgasm build to release.<br />
<br />
Mike, the mare, Brian, and Dar all seemed to come at the same time in a chorus of shouts, whinnies, and grunts.  Dar shuddered, his grip almost painful as he shot a thick jet of semen that splattered against Mike&#39;s side.  Brian&#39;s much smaller load hit the ground.  They stayed like that for almost a full minute, the Shire stallion panting over the mare&#39;s back, and Brian gasping and sweaty in Dar&#39;s tight embrace.  Finally, Mike slid off the mare and nuzzled her, while Dar slowly released Brian and stepped back to free his still-hard cock.<br />
<br />
Brian&#39;s heart was pounding, his mind confused by the overwhelming intensity of what he had just experienced.  The combination of watching Mike surrender his humanity and the intimate contact with Dar was the most amazing thing he had ever experienced.   The stallion snorted and dropped its head to pull up some grass.   Brian knew that while that animal might be Mike, it was now Mike the Shire stallion, and no longer the teen he had gone to school with.  Just as Dar had said - a very smart horse.<br />
<br />
Fingers brushed his shoulders, and he turned to see Dar looking uncertainly at him.  The teen was streaked with filth, slick with sweat, and stank of piss, sweat, and horses.  His teeth were too large and scummy, and even cleaned up he would still be considered homely at best - like this he was an ugly, dumb-looking brute of a boy, more like a Neanderthal.  But he fit into this world, and seemed to enjoy his life.  There was just something about him...<br />
<br />
Brian flushed, realizing he was staring, and turned back to the horses.  &quot;Mike?&quot;  The stallion showed no reaction, busy cropping grass.  Had he even lost his name?<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s eating now.  Hard to break through.&quot;  Dar stepped up beside him and once again dropped an arm across Brian&#39;s shoulders.  &quot;You friend is still in there.  It will take a while for him to sort out memories and knowledge - it&#39;s all jumbled in with the horse stuff right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian leaned into the casual embrace, and after a moment, slid his arm around Dar&#39;s middle.  His fingers wiped sweat and dirt as they brushed down to rest lightly on the teen&#39;s butt, fingertips just inside the start of the crack.  He was tense at first, afraid he might have misread the attention, but Dar hugged him tighter.  Gathering courage, Brian looked up at the teen and asked &quot;Is it always intense like that?  Transformations?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dar smiled and sighed happily.  &quot;Not always as powerful as that - that was you and me and your centaur friend all tied up together.  But, yeah.  It&#39;s pretty amazing.  And when I do the transformation magic myself, it can be even stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man.&quot;  Brian grinned.  &quot;I would love to do this again.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teen chuckled.  &quot;So, you willing to be a stable boy?  Spend your life mucking stalls, grooming animals, and sometimes turning people into beasts?  That means sleeping on old straw, being mostly naked and dirty all the time, a lot of lifting and hauling, pretty much being treated and living as an animal yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian thought about that.  It sounded like a hard life, but a simple one.  No demands, no pressures.  No real danger, either.  Dar sure did not appear to suffer - but he was big and strong for a boy his age.  Brian&#39;s pale, slender elven form would not last a day.  &quot;I don&#39;t think I could do a lot of work like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So let me make you into a human with muscles, like me.&quot;  Dar grinned.  &quot;I could really improve your sex life.&quot;  Then he looked embarrassed.  &quot;I mean, you wouldn&#39;t have to look like me.  I know I&#39;m sorta ugly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian had to look at the impressive cock and balls before smiling back.  Yeah, Dar was ugly, but the thought of looking just like him was really tempting.  Then again, if he could look more handsome and still be hung, that would be nice.  But what would that do to his ability to go back?  If Tye was to be believed, Mike was now a horse and was stuck here.  Would Brian be stuck here forever as a stable boy?  Did he even want to go back now?<br />
<br />
<br />
