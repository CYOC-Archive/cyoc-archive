Katie felt giddy with excitement. The ring could not only change herself but the world around her. Being 8 years old physically and mentally now, Katie&#39;s thought processes were still very childlike. She thought about how unfair it was that her mother never had time to enjoy herself, to have fun, and that she almost never had time for Katie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I can give her a vacation for a few days, make her my sister! I could be older and in charge and eat as much junk food as I wanted then.&quot; She thought aloud, giggling to herself. &quot;But what about Aunt Amy? She&#39;ll be here any moment.&quot; <br />
<br />
She thought about this problem a bit. &quot;I could just wish she didn&#39;t remember mom being anything but a kid too. Ok! I&#39;ll do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie closed her eyes, not realizing the consequences her new wish could make. &quot;I wish that I was ten years old and Mom was my nine year old little sister when she woke up from her nap. I wish that she&#39;d have her own room and stuff her own toys and clothes in my house and that everyone in the world who knows us remembered that our mom was already away out of town working except for mom and it wouldnt cause us any problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie felt the ring warm and her body began to grow and change straining at her clothes, as it did she quickly made a second wish. &quot;I also wish my room and clothes would change to be those I&#39;d wear as a ten year old and I knew and felt everything a ten year old girl should.&quot; <br />
<br />
That did it. As katie grew, she felt her body mature and become stronger as knowledge of an average fourth grader began to float into her mind and fill the space. All the Monster high stuff dissapeared from her clothes as they became more plain, her sneakers were now soft teal hued converse high tops, she wore jeans with bejweled patterns on the front and a blouse with the same. Her hair shifted and grew a bit longer as it sweapt back into a ponytail by a scrunchie. Her nails became polished. As this happened, Katie noticed portraits of pop stars appear on her walls and a computer on her desk as her closet filled with new clothes and shoes. Her room now looked just like a ten year old girls room should, and she knew it. But the portraits were strange to her at first. Boys? Wait... she was starting to like boys? Katie struggled with this a moment. Of course she had some friends who were boys in fourth grade, but she didn&#39;t like them the way these other pop icons made her feel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wierd...&quot; She said aloud, she didnt understand why she felt this way but she did and, interestingly enough her wish helped her accept it. Looking at her reflection in the mirror, katie grinned at the ten year old staring back at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I can go watch mom&#39;s change.&quot;  Katie said hurrying downstairs.  She found her Mom sprawled out on the couch.  Moving to sit opposite her on a chair, Katie felt ecstatic to realize her toes finally could touch the ground.  &quot;Cool, I really am growing up.&quot;  She thought to herself.   &quot;Now let&#39;s see how mom changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Already her Mom did look quite a bit younger.  The worry lines were gone from her face, and her hair had regained a natural sheen.  She looked about half her age, and still becoming younger, crossing into her early twenties as her body became stronger and leaner.  &quot;I better make sure her clothes change with her.&quot;  Katie thought.  &quot;I wish Mom&#39;s clothes would adjust to what a girl her age would wear when she&#39;s done changing.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Katie felt the ring warm as her mom started to enter her teens.  Pimples dotted her face as she tossed and turned, moaning in her sleep.  Her clothes started to look more baggy on her as her shoes started to slide off her feet.  Puberty wasn&#39;t being kind to her mother, more pimples appearing as her body became more gawky and lean, the body of an adolescent who hadn&#39;t quite evened out into the beauty that would come with being an adult.  Katie saw her mom open her mouth revealing braces on her teeth.   She giggled noticing them, remembering her mom&#39;s early high school pictures she&#39;d seen where she&#39;d worn braces.  <br />
<br />
Mom, or Kelly as she probably should be called by that point as Katie realized, was now entering her early adolescence, the pimples were diminishing but so was her body.  Her breasts were shrinking in her blouse as her hair began to gain natural highlights, the braces dissapeared as she became thirteen, and freckles began to dot her face.  By 12, her breasts were non existent and Katie started to feel more excited.  Her mom and she now evened out in age, but then her mom passed beyond her double digits into the singles.  Her face rounded as her clothes were now huge on her tiny body, one of her shoes had fallen away, revealing her clenching toes.   Her mother was still squirming as if having a nightmare.  <br />
<br />
Then she stopped regressing at age eight, and her clothes began to change.  Katie watched as her mom&#39;s shoes became sneakers like hers, but a softer pastelle pink, her nylons now socks.  Her blouse and shirt joined together to a simple blue dress and her hair fixed itself into braids.   Katie grinned as her mother stopped squirming and finally relaxed.  Where once lay her mother, now lay an 8 year old girl with no sign of any maturity.  What was more, Katie could see pictures in the room shifting appearing with Kelly&#39;s adult form, and her child form in the picture.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome,&quot;  Katie thought.  &quot;She really is my little sister now...&quot;</p>
