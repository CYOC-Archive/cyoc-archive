<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danielle woke up alone.  She was really starting to hate when Gemory did that.  Not that she&#39;d bring it up with the demon- she knew Gem had things to do.  But it still sucked.  Sliding her legs over the edge of the bed, she was surprised to find her feet almost touched the floor.  Looking at her chest, she actually had tits again, though they were still smaller than usual.<br />
<br />
She stood up and stretched.  It felt good to be older again, but at the same time, she would have liked a little more time.  At this rate, she&#39;d be back to normal by tomorrow or the next day.  She really wished she could just change her age at will, instead of being limited to growing younger.<br />
<br />
But if wishes were horses, beggars would ride.  She made her way to the shower and wished Gem was here.  After getting ready, she realized nothing she had would fit her right now- she guessed her age to be on the southern end of 13.  Shrugging, she pulled on one of her shirts.  Sure enough, it came down enough to cover everything.<br />
<br />
With that, she went to go find breakfast.<br />
<br />
<br />
She found Mist and the other girls in the kitchen already.  Mist already looked about 18 or 19.  Ami was about 11, and she figured Toni had to be about a year younger than that.<br />
<br />
The baby, thankfully, was still about six months old.<br />
<br />
“Hey girls, how is everyone?”  Danielle said, entering the room.<br />
<br />
“Not bad, considering.  It seems your power is wearing off quickly.  We should all be back to normal soon.”  Mist said.  “Eggs or French toast?”<br />
<br />
“Ooh.  French toast sounds yummy, thank you.”  Danielle sat down, her tummy rumbling.<br />
<br />
“Somebody is hungry this morning!”  Toni grinned.  “Damia sure takes after you, she&#39;s a bottomless pit.”<br />
<br />
“Well she is going to grow faster than normal, right?  I guess you&#39;ll need me to slow down her aging.”<br />
<br />
“It would help, but right now we&#39;re trying to decide what age to let her get to.  Ami and I have decided we hate changing diapers.”  Toni made a face.<br />
<br />
“Oofta.  I don&#39;t blame you there.  Probably want her able to talk too.”<br />
<br />
“Of course that means she&#39;ll be old enough to get into trouble.”  Mist pointed out.  “You&#39;ll never be able to take an eye off of her.”<br />
<br />
“Was your little one a lot of trouble, Mist?”  Ami asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes!  She was so curious about everything!  And I refused to leave her with a sitter.  So you can imagine what that did to my romantic life.”<br />
<br />
Toni shivered.  “Oh that sounds bad.”<br />
<br />
Ami patted her lover on the head.  “It won&#39;t be so bad.  Your Mom and Stepmom will help out, I&#39;m sure.”<br />
<br />
“Well I will, but Gem...she&#39;s always busy.”  Dani didn&#39;t meant to sound annoyed about that, but soon she found herself being glomped by Amielle.<br />
<br />
“Is she neglecting you, Danielle?  I&#39;ll smite her if so!”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn&#39;t, Ami.  She&#39;s a lot stronger than you.  And you&#39;re not exactly a warrior.”  Mist advised.<br />
<br />
“Still!”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t feel neglected.  But I do hate waking up alone.  Sorry guys, I didn&#39;t want to complain.  I know she&#39;s busy, and I don&#39;t want to interfere with her career.”  Dani shook her head.  “Even if it is acquiring souls for Hell, I got to see her at work.  She&#39;s really in her element.”<br />
<br />
“No, Danielle, you should say something.”  Toni spoke up.  “She has people to take care of things.  She likes being hands on, but you should be more important.”<br />
<br />
“It sounds so selfish.”  Danielle sighed.<br />
<br />
“Ami, my love, can you bop her on the head for me?  Our daughter seems to be part octopus.”<br />
<br />
Ami nodded and gave Danielle a perfect “Gibbs slap” on the back of the head.<br />
<br />
“Ow!”  Dani protested.<br />
<br />
“You have the right to be selfish.  Gemory loves you a great deal, she can make time for you.”  The Angel pointed out.<br />
<br />
“But she does!  She has!  I can&#39;t expect her to let me hang on her like a barnacle 24-7!  She has to have some freedom.”<br />
<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door frame, and Raphael poked her head in.  “Oh my, I heard you were all younger, but I didn&#39;t expect everyone to be so adorable!”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not adorable.”  Mist said.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes you are, Misty!  I should have come by sooner, you&#39;re growing up so fast.”  Raphael smiled.  “And this is little Damia?  Who&#39;s a beautiful little baby?”  She smiled at Damia, who cooed in delight.<br />
<br />
“Wow, you really have a way with kids, Raphael.”  Danielle noted.<br />
<br />
“Oh I adore children.”  The Archangel shrugged.  She started to play &#39;peek-a-boo&#39; with Damia, who squealed happily.<br />
<br />
“It seems Damia likes you right back.”  Dani grinned.<br />
<br />
“She does, doesn&#39;t she?  Such a sweet child, just like her parents.”  Raphael pretended to snatch Damia&#39;s nose, which confused the infant.<br />
<br />
Toni giggled, then frowned.  “Ugh, time to change her again.”<br />
<br />
“Already?”  Ami whined. <br />
<br />
“That&#39;s what children her age do.”  Mist snickered.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ve got this, relax, kids.”  Raphael snapped her fingers.  There was a flash of light, and the baby was wearing a clean diaper.  “Mary really appreciated that trick.”<br />
<br />
“Mary as in...the mother of Jesus?”  Danielle blinked.<br />
<br />
“Well of course I was there, Mary and Joseph were just a couple of kids in love, and Herod was still trying to find the Scion of David.  Talk about a mean, bitter old man.”  Raphael shook her head.  <br />
<br />
“Man, hearing you talk about stuff that happened thousands of years go is never going to sound normal.”  Danielle focused on her meal.<br />
<br />
“You say that now, but once you&#39;ve lived a thousand years or so, you&#39;ll be just as bad.”  Raphael laughed.  “So where&#39;s Gemmy?”<br />
<br />
“Working.”  Amielle frowned.  “Poor Danielle is missing her terribly.”<br />
<br />
“Ami, come on, it&#39;s fine.”  Danielle protested, then paused, finding the Angel of Love standing close to her, her face mere inches from her own.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll be the judge of that.”  Raphael said.<br />
<br />
“Uh...personal space, Raphael?”  Danielle felt nervous.<br />
<br />
Instead of taking the hint, the Angel gave Dani a hug and a kiss on the cheek.  Danielle decided not to make a big deal of it.  Raphael gave pretty good hugs.<br />
<br />
She then took a step back.  “Sorry, Danielle.  I really shouldn&#39;t be taking liberties, I know we don&#39;t know each other that well.  But you are feeling down.  Could it be that you&#39;re a little homesick?”<br />
<br />
“I do worry about Dad, I&#39;m his best employee, and without me around, there&#39;s no telling what he&#39;s eating.”  Danielle admitted.<br />
<br />
“Then maybe it&#39;s time to move back home.”  The Angel smiled.<br />
<br />
“Thank God for that!”  Mist said.<br />
<br />
“Aw, won&#39;t you miss us?”  Ami looked up at the Valkyrie with her cutest expression.<br />
<br />
Mist rolled her eyes and sighed.  “Yes, I will, but I have a business to run here.  And with all your shenanigans, who could have mortal guests?”<br />
<br />
“Oh don&#39;t let Mist fool you, she&#39;s a big softy.  You&#39;ll find her visiting often, I&#39;m sure.”  Raphael said.<br />
<br />
“Hmph.”  Was Mist&#39;s response.<br />
<br />
“Not sure where me and Ami are going to go.  I don&#39;t think her Dad is going to be happy with two other roommates, let alone two with a baby.”  Toni frowned.<br />
<br />
“Ah, well, if you don&#39;t mind, Toni, my dear, you can live with me.”  Raphael offered.  “To better keep an eye on Gemory and Danielle, I was planning on living near them.  It&#39;d be a simple matter to get a house with enough room for all of us.”<br />
<br />
Immediately the conversation turned to what sort of place Raphael would get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in Hell...<br />
<br />
Despite the existence of an Infernal Hierarchy, the various Lords of Hell were not actually beholden to their superiors.  Their rank simply denoted their power, and how many of Hell&#39;s Legions they commanded.  Direct confrontations between the Fallen were forbidden (though backstabbing, betrayal, deception, and other forms of skullduggery were allowed).<br />
<br />
So even though she was a Duke of Hell, it wasn&#39;t like Asmodeus, a King of Hell, could order Gemory around.<br />
<br />
There was, however, one individual to whom all demons owed their fealty.  And when they called upon you, you arrived with all due haste.<br />
<br />
Thus it was that Gemory found herself in the fortress of Lucifer the Morning Star, Master of Hell.<br />
<br />
As much as she hated to do it, she was forced to break Danielle&#39;s enchantment- she didn&#39;t want Luci to think her young form was an attempt to manipulate him/her.  Lucifer, despite their reputation as the Prince of Lies, was touchy about being manipulated.<br />
<br />
She arrived in her (previously) favored demon form, a 6&#39; 4” blonde maiden of indescribable beauty (ok, so really, she looked about the same as she always did, but she was taller!).  She wore her horned crown and the dress of a medieval noblewoman.<br />
<br />
There was no telling what form Luci would take, so she decided overdressed was better than underdressed.  She was escorted to the throne room, a chamber of black basalt, dominated by the Obsidian Throne.<br />
<br />
She was announced by a Herald, and she strode up to the throne, then went to one knee.  “You have called me, and I have come, my Lord.”<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t see Lucifer very clearly- a combination of the Throne&#39;s tendency to be cast in shadow, and the brilliant light of Luci&#39;s halo obscured exactly what form he/she had taken.<br />
<br />
She was pleasantly surprised to hear a young female voice.  The Princess of Darkness was usually easier to deal with.<br />
<br />
“You may rise, Gemory.”<br />
<br />
She did and was presented with a radiant child of about 10 years.  Perfection of form was an easy thing to attain for the Fallen- and yet, Lucifer quite literally outshone them all.  Describing the girl was a pointless exercise.  She had a perfection found nowhere among humankind- it was as if the greatest sculptor who had ever lived had combined the best qualities of the human form.<br />
<br />
She wore a simple white dress and was barefoot.  The only two traits of real note was that her hair was long and raven black (Luci, like Gemory, usually preferred to be a blonde), and that she stood about 10&#39; tall.<br />
<br />
&#39;A giant little girl.  Ok, that&#39;s a new one&#39;, she thought.<br />
<br />
“Yes, my Lady.”  She corrected.  Lucifer was genderfluid, and it was best to address her as the gender of whatever form she took.  Thankfully, she didn&#39;t seem inclined towards blending genders overmuch (even if her male forms tended to be extremely androgynous).<br />
<br />
Lucifer crossed her legs at the ankles.  Despite her great height, her feet still dangled off the ground.  She gestured to the floor, and a basalt bench rose from the floor.  “Sit with me, Gemory.”<br />
<br />
Gemory sat down on the bench.  The hard stone wasn&#39;t the most comfortable surface, but she supposed she&#39;d become soft in more ways than one.  “Yes, my Lady.”<br />
<br />
Lucifer was quiet for a moment.  Then finally, she spoke.  “You&#39;ve been making waves of late, Gemory.  My spies tell me that rumors about you are flying about.”<br />
<br />
“Demons gossip like old women, my Lady.”  Gemory replied.<br />
<br />
“Yes, but some of these rumors aren&#39;t exactly false.  You&#39;ve been spending a lot of time on Earth, more than any of the Fallen.  Even the forces of Heaven are troubled by this.  Many think you are planning a coup.”<br />
<br />
“My Lady!  Surely you don&#39;t think I would be disloyal to you?!”  Gemory blinked.<br />
<br />
“No, Gemory.  You are among the most loyal of my followers.  You never blamed me for The Fall.”<br />
<br />
She sighed.  “It was as much our fault as anyone&#39;s.  Some say you were too prideful, too stubborn.  But which of us was any different?”<br />
<br />
“And yet, you were stripped of your halo, your wings carved from your body.  Wings that have never regrown.  While I remained unpunished.”<br />
<br />
Even though she had made her peace with Raphael...even though she didn&#39;t blame Michael...millenia hadn&#39;t healed the wound in her heart.  She lowered her head, to hide her tears.  All this time, and she still wasn&#39;t -whole-.<br />
<br />
To her surprise, she felt small arms embracing her.  Lucifer had shrunk to the size of a normal girl and was hugging her.  “I&#39;m sorry, Gemory.”<br />
<br />
“My Lady...you don&#39;t...apologize.”  That had -not- come out the way she intended!<br />
<br />
The girl looked at her sadly.  “I know.  Stubborn and prideful, remember?  Never admitting weakness, daring my subordinates to turn on me.”<br />
<br />
There -had- been rebellions in Hell, long ago.  But Lucifer had put them down with ridiculous ease.  Even Asmodeus was exceedingly subtle with his plots and schemes, wary of the Morning Star&#39;s power.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not worthy of an apology.”  Gemory insisted.<br />
<br />
“Why Gemory, you -have- changed.  I had to see it with my own eyes.  Where&#39;s that unshakable confidence?”<br />
<br />
“...still here.  But...yes, I have changed.”<br />
<br />
“Tell me what has happened.”  Lucifer didn&#39;t command.  She didn&#39;t need to.<br />
<br />
Gemory told her Lady everything that had happened in the past week.  She expected...well she didn&#39;t know what to expect.  Judgement?  Scorn?  A scolding?<br />
<br />
“So a mortal has trapped you.  With the greatest trap of all.  Love.”<br />
<br />
Gemory nodded.  “It&#39;s...insidious.  Even if I could break free...I don&#39;t want to.”  <br />
<br />
“As much a cage of your own making as the girl&#39;s cleverness.  But she has changed you in a very short time.  It must be love.”<br />
<br />
“What is love?”  Gemory joked.<br />
<br />
Luci giggled.  “Baby don&#39;t hurt me, don&#39;t hurt me, no more.”<br />
<br />
Gemory sighed.  “So that&#39;s it, no great scheme, no trying to overthrow Heaven or Hell.  I&#39;m just a stupid girl in love.”<br />
<br />
“Never stupid, Gemory.  Never.  Once, long ago, you were a simple creature, but even then, you had untapped potential.  Paimon saw it.  And once he told me, I saw it as well.  You haven&#39;t looked into the future at all, have you?”<br />
<br />
She shook her head.  “No!  I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t want to know.  If I saw a future where Danielle was lost to me...I can&#39;t go through that a second time, Lucifer!”<br />
<br />
“The worst fate a Fallen could endure.  We lost God&#39;s love, even though each of us still craves it.  If our Maker ever called us home, would any of us remain?”<br />
<br />
“I would.”  Gemory said.<br />
<br />
“Oh Gemory.  You really can hold a grudge.”  Luci smiled.  “But I&#39;m the same way.  Nothing stops me from striding through Heaven&#39;s Gates, making my way directly to the Throne of Heaven.  Yet I remain here.”<br />
<br />
“Stubborn.”  Gemory nodded.<br />
<br />
“Prideful.”  She paused.  “The worst fate...for one of us to find love again.  If this girl were snatched away, you would be unmade, my Duke.  And you have enemies.”<br />
<br />
“I was proud to have them!  I didn&#39;t care!  Let them come!  Let them storm the gates of my palace, kill my servants!  I had nothing to lose!”  Gemory burst into tears.<br />
<br />
“Ah, but now, you have -everything- to lose.  Well take heart, my dear Duke.  All is not lost.”<br />
<br />
“No?”  Gemory hated how small and weak her voice sounded.<br />
<br />
“You see the girl, but you haven&#39;t really looked at her, have you?  At first she was a target of opportunity, someone you could give a cursed gift to, and watch and see what happens.  A source of amusement.  But then everything changed, and she became the most beautiful creature in existence to you.  Why, I bet you find her prettier than me!”<br />
<br />
“I...yes, she is my light.”  Gemory admitted.<br />
<br />
“And a wedding!  What a momentous occasion!  Have you planned it at all?”<br />
<br />
“No.  I don&#39;t think I can have it in Hell.  Danielle&#39;s Father is Mortal.  And...there will be a few Angels in attendance.”  Gemory bit her lower lip.<br />
<br />
“Truly?!  How surprising!  Who?”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t be angry, my Lady.”  Gemory looked nervous.<br />
<br />
“The names, Gemory.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, a second class Angel, Amielle.  And uh, the former Valkyrie, Mist.”<br />
<br />
“This Amielle has caused a bit of a ruckus, I&#39;m told.  And Mist...it&#39;s been a long time.  Is that all?”<br />
<br />
Gemory bit the bullet.  “Raphael.”<br />
<br />
The look in Lucifer&#39;s eyes was...well it was something.  Anger.  Sorrow.  Pain.  <br />
<br />
Rather than lash out at her, Luci kicked her Obsidian Throne, breaking off a chunk of it.  She stood there, seething for several minutes.  Then...<br />
<br />
“Ow!  That really smarts!”  She turned and limped over, her foot already swelling.<br />
<br />
“Let me, please.”  Gemory had bothered to learn the secrets of medicine, something most Demons had no use for.  She tenderly probed the foot.  “You didn&#39;t break anything at least.  I&#39;d say put ice on it, but...this -is- Hell.”  Instead she wrapped the foot with an elastic bandage.  “You&#39;ll want to keep it elevated.”<br />
<br />
Lucifer muttered something in Angelic that Gemory couldn&#39;t make out, even with her exceptional hearing.  Then she sighed.  “Ok, I admit, that was dumb.  But Raphael?!”<br />
<br />
“I know!  I...when I saw her, it took everything I had to not backhand her into next year!  She came up to me, acting like nothing had ever happened...you know how she is, she acts like a love-addled lunatic, so you can&#39;t stay angry at her.”<br />
<br />
“Did it work?”<br />
<br />
“No.  But we were in Mist&#39;s House, so...I just yelled at her.”<br />
<br />
“Hm, probably wise.  Even a former Angel of Death would be a tough fight.”  Luci nodded.  “So...why?”<br />
<br />
“Danielle.  She...ordered me to make up with Raphael.”<br />
<br />
“Ordered you?”  Lucifer&#39;s eyebrows raised.<br />
<br />
“...yes.  She punished me until I did.”  Gemory felt embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“You have it bad.  Real bad.  And yet, a part of me envies you.  Well.  As long as she stays far away from me.  I have no inclination to forgive the &#39;Angel of Love&#39;.”<br />
<br />
“So.  Yes.  The wedding will have to be on neutral ground.  I&#39;m not even sure who could officiate!  I gather Jack and Danielle aren&#39;t particularly religious, so maybe a Justice of the Peace?”<br />
<br />
“No, I rather doubt they would be.  Well if it&#39;s a judge you need, we could have Rhadamanthus officiate.”  Lucifer offered.<br />
<br />
“The Judge of the Dead?  I suppose even the Angels in attendance would accept that...wait.  You doubt they would be religious?”<br />
<br />
“Oh Gemory.  You don&#39;t realize it, but you very nearly fell into a trap that would have destroyed you.  It was no accident that led you to that girl.  Someone planned all of this out.”<br />
<br />
“I...I don&#39;t understand, what do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Lucifer sighed.  “The girl&#39;s father is of the line of Cain.”<br />
<br />
Gemory felt her world tilt.  Cain!  The first murderer!  Cursed by God!  “No...”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m afraid so, and you never saw it coming.  That girl may very well have saved you by making you fall in love with her.  Imagine if she had ceased to be entertaining, and you&#39;d decided to drag her to Hell against her will?”<br />
<br />
Gemory shivered, a lost look in her eyes.  “Oh my G...”  She stopped.  <br />
<br />
Lucifer didn&#39;t admonish her for her near faux pas.  “Exactly.”  She then quoted the Bible.  “Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.”<br />
<br />
“But she doesn&#39;t have the Mark!”  Gemory protested.<br />
<br />
“Oh she does, but being merely a descendant, it is invisible.  You would have had to look for it.  And whoever baited this trap knew you wouldn&#39;t bother, my arrogant Duke.  But look at the bright side- it makes her relatively safe from harm.”<br />
<br />
“Relative being the operative word.  I should have known.  The two of them can&#39;t cook for shit.  They fix old homes for a living.”<br />
<br />
“Indeed.  When you work the ground, it will no longer yield it&#39;s crops for you.  You will be a restless wanderer upon the Earth.”  Luci quoted the scripture again.  “I love the New International Bible.  It&#39;s adorable, in a sea of wrong, what little they got right.”<br />
<br />
“I think we are to blame for that.”  Gemory pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Bah.  Humans don&#39;t need us to make things more difficult for them.  They get into enough trouble on their own.  But it is fun to mess with them.”  Lucifer grinned.<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t really hate them as much as you claim.”<br />
<br />
“Why Gemory, you forget your place.”  Luci chided.<br />
<br />
“Oh I thought we were friends.  Well if you want, I can abase myself before you, rend my clothing, and kiss your feet.” <br />
<br />
“Temping, but you&#39;re going to be a married woman.  I suppose Danielle will make you into an honest woman?”<br />
<br />
“Ha!  As if.  I left her alone once and came back to find her in a threesome with a Succubus and an Angel!&#39;  She laughed.  “I mean, I kind of set it up, so it&#39;s not like she was really cheating on me, but it was impressive.”<br />
<br />
“By Succubus, do you mean dear, sweet Toni?  You adopted her, I heard.  And she is with child?”<br />
<br />
“Was with child.  Toni evolved, and since she was pregnant, there were complications.  So now she&#39;s the mother of a bouncing baby girl.  Damia.”<br />
<br />
“I will have to meet this child, and congratulate the mother.  And the other parent was an Angel, this Amielle?  Talk about exploiting a loophole.  Why hasn&#39;t Heaven kicked her out yet?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not sure, but the girl is a sex fiend.  She&#39;d get along well down here.”  <br />
<br />
“We haven&#39;t had a new Fallen in quite some time.  Well, we almost got Mist, but it&#39;s good we didn&#39;t.  The woman&#39;s a menace.”<br />
<br />
“I assume she&#39;s under probation, but as Raphael is in charge of her now, I highly doubt she&#39;ll be seriously punished.  Ami and Toni are in love, and you know how Rafe is about that sort of thing.”<br />
<br />
“Bah.  Love freaks.  Still...I think I will like this Amielle.  Second Class Angel.”  Luci shook her head.  “It&#39;s funny, we haven&#39;t had any real problems with turning humans into demons...well, other than that incident with Dominy the Arusities...but Heaven has their hands full with the Second Class Angels.”<br />
<br />
“Too bad.  Some of them need to be kept on their toes.  Speaking of Dominy, how is she?”<br />
<br />
“The same.  Bored.  But what can I have her do?  Her specialty is pointless in Hell, and if I let her go to Earth, she&#39;d be Smote on sight.  It&#39;s a rare problem to have- a soldier who is too good at following orders.”<br />
<br />
“Turning an entire town into Arusities was fairly ambitious.  However, I have a new project I think she could be of great help with.  Would you consider loaning her to me?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m intensely curious about this &#39;new project&#39;.  Tell me more.  Actually, let&#39;s go for a walk, I&#39;m tired of the Throne Room.  Care for some tea?”<br />
<br />
Gemory told her Mistress that tea would be lovely.</p>
