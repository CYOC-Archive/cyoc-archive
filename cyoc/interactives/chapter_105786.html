<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martin was the first to get up in the morning. Despite all the excitement and drama of last evening, his sleep was restless. Looking at the alarm clock he noticed it said five thirty. Sighing, Martin gets out of bed and silences the alarm. “No point in waking Melissa with that”, he thinks to himself. He heads to Julie’s room to see her asleep. Despite everything that has happened, Martin still loved her and only wanted the best for her. Closing the door he heads to the washroom to shave and shower.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
20 minutes later <br />
*****<br />
<br />
Melissa stirs in bed finding Martin not there. She slowly gets up and hears the shower turn off. Groggily she gets up as Martin arrives back into the master bedroom naked preparing to get dressed. She muses to herself, “Despite Martin’s flaws, he still has one hell of a body.” Melissa finally gets out of bed and gently slaps Martins ass. He turns around to see her head to the washroom with what looked like a come hither look.<br />
<br />
“She can’t be horny now.” He wonders to himself. Still naked he head to the washroom to see Melissa in the shower. Partially obscure by the steam, Martin sees Melissa and can tell she is naked. His member starts to stir and a large blast of steam billows out of the shower stall and engulfs the room. Suddenly he is grabbed by Melissa and thrust into the shower stall with her.<br />
<br />
Fully awake and aroused, Martin sees Melissa start playing with his member as both he and her go into their stage one transformation. Not one to waste a good time, Martin gently escorts Melissa off him and soaps her up with some of her lavender shower gel. Gently rubbing her curves, Martin slowly works his way down. Starting with Melissa’s neck he takes the shower puff and lathers up her breasts. Martin then gently rubs Melissa’s abdomen, slowly working his way to her neither’s. <br />
<br />
Enjoying the subtle foreplay, Melissa lets Martin continue all the while thinking of all the crap Martin has pulled. Sure he was a cheat and a unmitigated philander. But he has change, Melissa thinks to herself. Last night when seeing Alyssa Cooper naked in the lake she notices that Martin showed no interest in her. Physical and emotional. The only thing he was concerned with was where Julie was/with. That may not excuse his past acts, but it may be enough for the both of them to see a counselor to save their marriage.<br />
<br />
Rearing back to reality, she stares at Martin’s throbbing rocket eager to reach its destination. She feels a need for it to be inside her. Without warning she jumps Martin aiming her moist folds to his eager penis. It’s a good think they are both in their stage one transformation. For that act alone could of knock them both down due to the slick shower floor. Feeling Martin’s member enter her successfully she wraps her legs around him and starts gyrating her hips. Martin, surprised at the aggressive move, yet pleased braces Melissa to one of the shower walls and starts thrusting in and out.<br />
<br />
They both go at this for several minutes. Martin thrusting, pushing deeper into Melissa. Melissa starts to feel her orgasm building. Her vaginal muscles clenching down trying to lock Martin in. Martin feeling this, starts to pick up the pace. He thrusts faster and harder all the while feeling his own orgasm building. Both begin to breathe hard. Both clench their faces in torment as they both reach the cusp, trying to force the dam to break.<br />
<br />
Both are now going at it faster and harder than ever. Melissa’s tunnel starting to feel rubbed raw; starts to scream in frustration. Then she feels Martin’s rocket twitch and a warm liquid spurting in her. It was at that moment that her own dam burst and her body shudders with the most mind bending orgasms she ever had.<br />
<br />
They both stay locked together for some time. Melissa still feels Martin spilling his seed in her. His sperm, filling her womb. Not knowing that her orgasm shook loose and egg from one of her ovaries; eagerly waiting to be fertilized. In all the drama, Melissa had forgotten to take her daily were birth control pills for the past few days. A surprise that will soon shock both Stovall’s by the days end. <br />
<br />
Melissa unhooks herself from Martin and continues to wash up. Martin also washes up again and both get out of the shower. Martin is confused, yet pleased with Melissa’s about face with him. Not wanting to ruin the moment he keeps his mouth shut as they both finish cleaning up. Leaving the shower and toweling off again, Martin heads back to get dressed and notices the time is now seven in the morning.<br />
<br />
Rushing to put on his clothes for another day at the office, he heads to Julie’s bedroom to wake her up, just as Melissa leaves the shower.<br />
“Come one Julie. Get up.” Ask he gently shakes her awake.<br />
Julie starts to moan and turnover. Martin not having any of it raises his voice. “Get up Julie. You have school!”<br />
“Fine,” She responds. “You don’t need to shout.”<br />
“Julie. We are still going to have a talk over last night. Your mother and I know you were the lake. Do not try to lie to us.” Martin continues. “But that will wait. Until then, get up and get ready for school.” With that Martin leaves to finish getting dressed.<br />
<br />
July slowly gets up to use the washroom. Disrobing she heads to the shower. Turning it on, she notices that the water is lukewarm at best. Not knowing that her parents drained the hot water tank with their silent, spur of the moment love making.  Quickly washing up, Julie performs her other daily ablutions and heads back to her room to get dressed.<br />
<br />
Minutes later, Julie heads downstairs to a breakfast of cereal and toast that Martin prepared. She eats in silence as Martin is sipping his coffee while on a laptop reading his emails. Melissa comes down fully dressed and grabs a slice of toast a cup of coffee. Julie feels extremely uncomfortable with the awkward silence. She is about to say something when her father breaks the din.<br />
<br />
“Okay. I’m off to work now.” Looking at Julie’ “I’ll be picking you up after school today. Behave.” He kisses his daughter and then tries to kiss Melissa but is rebuffed. Confused, Martin heads off wondering what the hell their shower fun was for.<br />
<br />
As soon as Martin leaves, Melissa finally speaks. “Hurry up. You’re going to be late.” Melissa put the dishes in the dishwasher and looks to see it doesn’t need to be run just yet. Putting on her shoes, coat and grabbing her purse and car keys. Melissa escorts Julie to the car and drives her off to school. All Julie can think, is what will happen when dad picks her up. Will she have her grounding extended again?</p>
