<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dad after finishing the potion sat on the sofa, turned on the TV to watch a football match, I followed him thinking that the potion had no effect until I noticed something strange. My father had lost his hair when he was still very young, about 28 years old, at that moment the whole scalp was regenerating, the strangest thing is that my father did not even notice what was there happening, indeed he behaved as if everything was normal. As the hair continued to grow, changing its color from gray to brown, I began to notice other rather unusual attitudes for my father. He ached for games and sports in general, which instead hated my mother preferring films and TV series, but also a great lover of animation and reading, so I couldn&#39;t understand why he was so detached, almost bored by the match . &quot;Dad, are you feeling well&quot; I asked &quot;Sure darling, I&#39;m fine&quot; he replied how my mother would reply, I noticed that the hair was still growing and didn&#39;t stop, I also noticed syavo acquiring thickness and volume and brightness like my mother&#39;s, now they were almost close behind. Suddenly my father feels a strong itch on his right arm and I start to scratch it, then the itch spreads on the skin, then on the other arm and finally spreads all over the body, especially on the face. The more my father scratched himself, the more he lost hair, precisely the hairs fell where he scratched, the hairs that remained became less strong and weaker, losing thickness. He took off his shirt and trofino his back, belly and chest, here the hairs were reabsorbed into the skin, this also happened to the beard leaving a round face and a smooth and well-groomed skin. &quot;But seriously there are people who like this stuff!&quot; my father said &quot;What sense to see consumption that run chasing another guy with a ball in his hand!&quot; took the remote and said &quot;Do you want to see Stranger Things?&quot; &quot;W-What?&quot; &quot;Yes, you know the one we last saw with your mother.&quot; I could not believe my eyes on what was happening, the hand that was holding the remote control tightly was getting smaller and smaller, you could hear the sound of the hand bones getting longer and thin and I also saw the sickly fingernails passed to the healthy and then they were covered in red, this process also happened to the other hand. &quot;Honey, are you okay?&quot; I jumped for a moment and said &quot;Y-yeah ... I just didn&#39;t hate TV series and Netflix&quot; &quot;Really? I absolutely don&#39;t remember saying something like that and especially why should I say this bullshit. I love Netflix!&quot; he said in a higher voice than normal &quot;Ah .... ok go to Stranger Things&quot;. While dad turned on the app I noticed that his height was constantly decreasing and he heard the sound of bones breaking and rearranging so much that his back was arching &quot;Ah ... what a pain in the back&quot; he said with a suffering expression on his face &quot;Dad goes everything good?!&quot; suddenly you heard the rumble of the bones moving inwards leaving an arched figure &quot;Aaaaahhh ... Much better!&quot; my father answered with an expression of usual on his face and a voice much more feminine than before. The hair was now well over the shoulders like mom&#39;s and the height from 6&#39;8 step inexorably to 5&#39;5 the same as. .. in short, you understand.Here you are you are ready!&quot; said elated dad, I turned to him and said &quot;Yes me to- oh fuck !!&quot; &quot;What&#39;s up honey&quot; my dad&#39;s face was starting to look like mom&#39;s, the bones were shifting in front of my eyes, I could see the blobs on my dad&#39;s face that were making her lose weight and rejuvenate from wrinkles mainly caused from smoking, my mother does not smoke. The way he sat vaguely reminiscent of Mom, not to say at all &quot;Dad your face ...&quot; &quot;Dad?&quot; he burst out laughing &quot;No silly, I&#39;m your mother, not to say anything to your father but it takes a lot to mistake me for him!&quot; Oh fuck. My father has begun to identify with my mother, meanwhile the father / mother&#39;s arms are starting to lose fat and acquire a slight feminine tone, the thighs are starting to swell but not too much to make it look fat, quite the opposite.The intestines of my now ex father deflated and the excess fat ended up in two well-designed parts of the breasts and ass, all this while we were watching TV. the once flat chest became swollen, the breasts grew slowly by the minute, by the second by the second, from a cup A to a well-endowed D. my father&#39;s penis became a vagina. Although the facial transformation was at a good point, the nose had resized drastically, turning it into a potato nose, the lips swelled constantly until they became juicy, I noticed the lips also acquired a color Shiny red similar to the lipstick Mom had this morning when she kissed my ex father (now mother) who started this whole thing. Teeth whitened cheekbones rose and makeup remained you apply it on the face. The last missing piece was my mother&#39;s eyes that went from blue to magnificent hazelnut. After the episode, the transformation was completed after a few seconds of trans my mother realized that she was without her clothes and with the merchandise blowing in the wind. she immediately went to the room full of shame to pick up some clothes that suited her more. After an hour or so I went back to the living room and asked me &quot;Do you want to see AOT?&quot; in a totally feminine voice &quot;Okay&quot;. , my 35-year-old mother</p>
