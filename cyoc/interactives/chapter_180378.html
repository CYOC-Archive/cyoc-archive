<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wes had never really given his tan much thought until PE that day.<br />
<br />
Now he wondered how bronzed he was gonna be once school was over. He&#39;d taken it for granted that he was done transforming, but now as he headed out from school, he found himself looking at passing car windows, trying to get a feeling for if he had continued changing. Muscle was definitely something he had an abundance of, seemingly even moreso now that school was over. Either it was the change continuing or the pump from PE - because Wes could see his pecs pushing out just a bit more still - and in the process making his nipples stand out in his shirt.<br />
<br />
He could hear girls chatting about him on his way out, building his confidence even more. Though even with that going on, he found he could still not exactly go on without doubts. Wes admitted he was kind of nervous to see what was going on with Bryan, seeing as he had ran off from school in a rather uncharacteristic way. He&#39;d never known Bryan to go rush off like that before. Maybe it was something to do with the transformation.<br />
<br />
As Wes looked around, he eventually saw Bryan standing by his car near the edge of the parking lot.<br />
<br />
Hot damn.<br />
<br />
Wes found himself gawking a little bit. Bryan looked a bit further well built, in the same direction as where Wes was going. And his skin was, just like Wes&#39; a deal more tanned. But there was more going on there. Wes could see that Bryan&#39;s hair was slightly curly and in a way that it had never been before. His skin was if anything even further tanned and bronzed looking than Wes&#39;, though it looked like it might be more than just a bronze tan.<br />
<br />
He could not tell what it was - just that it was something he knew he should&#39;ve recognized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Bry,&quot; Wes said as he approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Wes. Sorry I ran off like that.&quot; He said as he stuck his hands in his pockets, &quot;I just needed to figure some things out. Let&#39;s uhh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go for a ride?&quot; Wes offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Bryan nodded quickly, looking Wes over, &quot;Let&#39;s go for a-a ride. Yeah. A ride.&quot; Bryan promptly opened up the car and seemed to bite his lip a little bit as Wes quickly headed over to the passenger side door. Once he got the door open, Wes looked at Bryan, blushing for a moment as he took his seat. Bryan didn&#39;t seem to know where to begin.<br />
<br />
Wes found himself feeling parched, &quot;Dude, uhh, about the plan...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that was in part what I hoped to uh, to talk to you about,&quot; Bryan started, and, before he even started the car at all, Bryan found himself leaning over toward Wes. The muscled up young man started leaning into it as well, and the two suddenly smashed their lips together, kissing thunderously and passionately. Wes groaned into it, feeling like this was just...such an amazing thing to get to experience. Here they were, doing this...<br />
<br />
After parting their lips, Bryan breathed and sat back down in his seat, &quot;Well, I suppose that gets to the heart of it. The plan. The whole &quot;just act like we&#39;re gay so we can get girls more interested&quot; thing. Yeah, I&#39;m feeling like revising the plan. Not saying we&#39;ll be in a relationship or anything, I just...I want you, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same, bro,&quot; Wes said, looking out the window as some of the cheer squad walked by, &quot;I-I also like fucking women though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we can do whatever we like then.&quot; Bryan said with a grin and then brought Wes into another kiss. Their tongues swishing around in their mouths and both blushing as they also started feeling up one another, getting acquainted with each others&#39; muscles and any new developments. <br />
<br />
&quot;Love your abs, bro.&quot; Bryan murmured as he stuck his hand up Wes&#39; shirt. The larger young man moaned a little as he felt Bryan pinch his nipple as he kept moving his hand up to Wes&#39; pecs. &quot;Pecs are awesome too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s uhh...let&#39;s...&quot; Wes looked around, trying to think where they could do this. He was getting really turned on, and unless he got a good fuck pretty soon he&#39;d be going home with the blue balls of the century. &quot;We can use my place. My folks are out for the night.&quot; With that, Bryan nodded, and the two separated. Bryan starting to drive off toward Wes&#39; place.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really hope we can have the same kinda cool relationship Ross and Diego have.&quot; Bryan said, &quot;They let each other fuck whoever they want, and it&#39;s not really a monogamous thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like some fun.&quot; Wes responded, &quot;Ross told me Mandy Heard was gonna be aiming to get her hands on you tomorrow. How about we see if she&#39;s up for two queer boys instead of one?&quot; He leaned back in his seat, awaiting Bryan&#39;s response.<br />
<br />
Just the idea made Bryan feel kind of nervous - but also incredibly turned on. Just the thought of a threesome like that, of sharing his own pleasure with not just one person but two, one of them being Wes? Ohh yeah that got his dick interested. Wes found himself looking over as he saw Bryan&#39;s tight clothes were doing relatively little to hide his interested, pulsing erection.<br />
<br />
By the time they got to Wes&#39; house, Bryan started working on getting his shirt off even before they got inside. Wes likewise stood outside in nothing but a pair of shorts, gasping after another kiss between the two of them. Wes fumbled a little with the keys as he moved to the door, feeling so excited and relieved that things had lined up like this. He and Bryan would get to indulge in whatever sex they wanted - and hopefully, this transformation, however it worked, would only make things feel even better.<br />
<br />
Once the door was open, Bryan was on Wes, kissing him from lip to neck down to pectoral. The blond tanned stud groaning as he felt Bryan jerk his cock, kiss his muscles, and slowly further undress. &quot;Let&#39;s do this, man.&quot;</p>
