<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Running to his room, Simon couldn’t help but gets excited at the prospect of getting older. Using the remote he began to type his new age.<br />
<br />
18/male/5’7/130Lbs<br />
<br />
Clicking the accept button, Simon didn’t have to wait any longer as he could feel his body start to age up, his clothes now slightly tighter on his now big boy body. He was practically brimming with excitement, the remote worked, he is now 18 yrs old. <br />
<br />
“Hehe, no more parent supervision for me. Watch out M-rated games, here comes a new player in town!” Simon yells, “I can’t wait to show my friends this!”<br />
<br />
As Simon was setting up the Chronivac for his friends, his finger slips and a bunch of new options appear in front of him. One option in particular sparked his inner child’s curiosity. Animal.<br />
<br />
“Ooh! What is this?” Simon says, clicking on the option a whole bunch of prompts pop up, each displaying a set of  vivid details about Simon himself.<br />
<br />
Looking through the details, he felt slightly exposed due to the Chronivac vast knowledge of himself (And his private bits). Shaking off the momentary embarrassment he looked through the options.<br />
<br />
“Dog? Maybe? Cat? Also maybe? Horse…. Yeah!” Simon says, he liked horses, how they seem so strong as they pull carts, how they looked so majestic in the winds, and how funny they sounded every time they neigh or snort. Clicking on the option, Simon was baffled at the utter complexity as the Chronivac now shows options on what breed of horse it was.<br />
<br />
“Hm…” Simon says, he didn’t know much about horse breeds, but his dad did give him a book about horses for his birthday since he loved horses so much, grabbing the book from under his bed, he flipped through the pages, soon stopping on one particular page. There, in all of it’s glory, was the largest horse he’d ever seen (in a book).<br />
<br />
“The Shire Horse…” Simon reads, flipping through the Chronivac options he wastes no time in finding the breed of horse.<br />
<br />
Clicking the option, he is then presented by another set of options, only, it just two buttons. ‘Feral’<br />
‘Anthro’<br />
<br />
“Feral? Anthro?” Simon questions, he remembers what his dad said about feral animals, how they somehow contract a virus called ‘Rabies’ that makes white foam comes out of their mouths. <br />
<br />
Simon shook his head, “I don’t want rabies!!!” He thought, so he selected anthro, there another two option appears on the screen.<br />
‘Partial’<br />
‘Fully’<br />
<br />
“Partial? Fully?” He questioned, unlike the previous two questions, this was easy to answer. “Fully! Why is partial even an option? Doesn’t a horse need a full diet to get strong?”<br />
<br />
Clicking the ‘Fully’ option, one final prompt is shown, “Reality Adaption?” It states, unchecked.<br />
<br />
“Sure, I guess.” Simon says, checking the box and clicking accept.<br />
<br />
After that, the prompt disappears, waiting a few moments Simon began to become impatient.<br />
<br />
“Where’s my horse?” He huffs in anger. That is when he felt something press against his pants just above his butt. Feeling the area, he immediately noticed the bump that’s growing on the back of his shorts, taking off his shorts he immediately gasps, there above his own butt was a growing horse tail.<br />
<br />
He was shocked, but at the same time intrigued. “Cool.” He says, his tail flicking back and forth without any input. That is when another sensation pulls his attention, this time in the front of his pants, fearfully, Simon looks down and see he has indeed got an boner. Feeling the bulge in his pants, he couldn’t help but moan a little, has he always been this sensitive before. That is until he noticed that his significant bulge has significantly gained size, he could feel his shorts getting tighter as it tries to hold his growing erection when with a loud snap the zipper breaks revealing the now flared head of  Simon’s new horse cock.<br />
<br />
Simon couldn’t believe his eyes, he does’t know what to feel, his hands inching closer to the now exposed flesh, only a single touch sent a shiver of pleasure to him.<br />
<br />
“T-that…was…a-amazing.” He says, putting more of his hand on his flesh, he is immediately shocked with pleasure.<br />
<br />
As Simon was continuing to pleasure himself, he didn’t notice that his body was still changing, his feet, though subtle, was shifting into digit grade hoof legs, gaining mass as well as fur, Simon’s shorts didn’t hold well as a number of tears appears, revealing the new coat of horse fur before ultimately succumbing as it turns to shreds.<br />
<br />
“My shorts!” Simon says, in his shocked haste Simon stood up too quickly, not allowing his body to adapt to his new legs he immediately fell, his dick shooting a load of pre from the impact.<br />
<br />
Next up was his arms, starting from the tips of his fingers which formed into hooflets, horse fur began to cover his entire arms, his arms bulking up to fit his new body, which from the very beginning has been slowly being covered in horse fur as well. His body then gaining muscle mass that could rival a body builder, ripping his shirt to tatters.<br />
<br />
The only thing left now was his head, his ears has already migrated on to the top of his head as well as his hair lengthening into a majestic horse mane. Only his face is left and that doesn’t take long he could feel his mouth and nose beginning to stretch and fuse into each other into a horse’s muzzle before finally being covered in fur.<br />
<br />
With the transformation complete, and his horniness high, with a mighty neigh he began to climax, his balls now the size of  cantelopes begins to empty themselves as they spread his horse semen  around the room.<br />
<br />
After a bunch of neigh and snorts as his cock slides back to its sheath, Simon finally gets out of his pleasure stupor and gets up, he felt immediately unbalanced, from the sudden height gain and his newly acquired horse legs, it took him a time to walk normally. After he finally gets the hang of it a sudden door ring notifies him of his friends. Walking towards the door, he notices how everythicing became smaller for him, especially the doors, having to position a certain way in order to gain passage through the door he finally reaches the door… and…</p>
