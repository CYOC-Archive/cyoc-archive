<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dialing his number, Barbara calls the general manager Jim to let him know about her situation. After set rounds of rings, she hears a familiar, semi-deep &quot;Hello&quot; coming through her speaker. Barbara starts to speak, &quot;Hey Jim, so I came in to work this morning.&quot; Barbara heard a long sigh coming out before Jim continued to question. &quot;So you didn&#39;t see the warning message this morning?&quot; &quot;Yeah,&quot; Barbara answers. &quot;You didn&#39;t know about the Great Fusion Wave?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; Barbara answers before questioning Jim back, &quot;What the hell is it? I was opening up the store, felt the heat of the hottest day here, passed out, and now I got a balloon&#39;s end on my left palm.&quot; Jim takes a moment before responding, &quot;So you definitely got fused. Barbara, I want you to close the place, make sure everything&#39;s back as it was, and then call 911. The Great Fusion Wave is a wave that has left many, many abhorrent fusions. From people to animals and even objects, the government has issued a huge pause across everyone as they handle all they need to. Some emergency folks will have you a check-up to see if you are going to be okay, before dropping you off back home. It is required to check up on them, by federal court order, so you need to do it. When you get home, call me again about their report, and I&#39;ll tell the owner before proceeding with any confiscation, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
After the confirmation, Barbara hangs up with Jim and starts preparing to redo the little opening tasks she did this morning. Still not used to her new lighter weight, Barbara notes measuring her weight once home as she prepares the work back to what it once was. As she finishes her work, Barbara grabs her phone, puts it in her purse, and grabs her purse, and as she puts it on her left shoulder, she notices her shoulder on the straps are being pushed a lot lower, like down an inch around her rubbery skin, and feels a slight air extruding from her left-palm lip. Freaking out about it, Barbara grabs her purse off her shoulder and sees the lining of her shoulder slowly protruding back to where it was, with some air going in her left palm. Taking a deep breath, Barbara holds her purse with her right hand and walks out of the store, already locked and security alarm on.<br />
<br />
She sits at the sidewalk corner, feeling her view sink a little as her bottom flattens, but not enough to blow air out of her left palm. Putting down her purse by her right, Barbara starts breaking down a little at her new body. &quot;Oh my God, oh my God oh my God,&quot; she keeps repeating to not cry out in public. After a hard moment of trying to keep herself composure, Barbara looks up and looks at the surrounding area, seeing the Wave&#39;s changes. Mainly cars fused down to the pavement roads, and what appeared to be a little girl sitting on a big rock which is at the corner of the turn into and out of the parking lot of the retail stores. Barbara looked at the girl, seeing if she would turn back to her, but she didn&#39;t for the time Barbara stared. Barbara eventually pulls out her phone from her purse and dials 911.<br />
<br />
&quot;911: What&#39;s your emergency?&quot; &quot;Yes hello, I got affected by the Fusion Wave and need a check-up,&quot; Barbara asks into her phone. &quot;Alright, are you at your home ma&#39;am?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; Barbara answers with a hint of fear, &quot;I worked a morning shift at my job and started working with my phone off before the warning message was issued.&quot; &quot;Alright, and where&#39;s your job address?&quot; After giving the dispatcher The Party Shack&#39;s address, the dispatcher gives Barbara assurance, &quot;Alright ma&#39;am, emergency will be coming over to you. Please stay where you are at and try not to do anything with your fusion until the emergency folks come. But until then, please stay on the line with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
After staying on the line with the 911 dispatcher for some time, Barbara hears and sees an ambulance vehicle coming over to her work. As they park near her, Barbara hangs up with the 911 dispatcher and sees two workers coming over to her, a man and a woman who look normal and unaffected. Barbara grabs her purse and starts standing up and feels her legs and butt inflate a little as they get out of the vehicle. The woman comes up to Barbara with a clipboard on hand, as the man opens up the back of the vehicle. &quot;Hey, so I&#39;m gonna need your name,&quot; the woman asks Barbara. &quot;Barbara, Barbara Seids.&quot; &quot;Alright,&quot; the woman starts writing down on her clipboard, &quot;and do you have any differences with your body?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; Barbara answers, &quot;My skin has turned more rubbery, and I have a balloon&#39;s end on my left palm,&quot; as she shows her palm up to the woman. &quot;Alright, alright, and do you feel any different than before the wave?&quot; &quot;Yes, a lot lighter.&quot; &quot;Okay, so can you explain to me what you did today?&quot; the woman asks.<br />
<br />
As Barbara recalls her day with the woman, the woman writes down on her clipboard while asking her more detailed questions for clarification. After getting all that the woman needs for her backstory, the woman informs her of the check-up they will need to record from her, and as such, Barbara does all that she was asked to do. Walk, run, jump, grab and hold the woman&#39;s pen she was using. It was noticeable to both Barbara and the woman that while Barbara could do all she was asked to do, she was floatier than before, being able to be in the air longer and higher than a woman of her size. After Barbara passes all the tasks the woman asks her, she directs Barbara to the man waiting in the ambulance. After grabbing her purse and getting herself in the back of the vehicle with the woman, the man asks Barbara for her pre-recorded height and weight, which the woman records as she takes a seat. Then Barbara was directed to a stadiometer and was asked by the man, &quot;Take off your shoes please ma&#39;am.&quot; As soon as she takes off her shoes, Barbara notices her feet inflated a little, feeling a tiny growth spurt. Barbara stands on the stadiometer, and after some tweaking from the man, the man tells the woman, &quot;Alright record five-foot-nine as Barbara&#39;s current height.&quot; Barbara frowns a little, she&#39;s now a little taller than what she wanted to be. As Barbara gets off the stadiometer, the man directs her to a weight scale, in which she stands. Seeing the number rising, she looked with big eyes when the scale was stopping around the one-hundred-twenty mark. &quot;And record one-twenty-five as Barbara&#39;s current weight,&quot; the man tells the woman, to which the woman and Barbara both say &quot;Wow!&quot; With a whole fifty pounds lost, Barbara struck gold with this fusion for her weight.<br />
<br />
The man tells Barbara, &quot;Now usually we would end the check-up with a blood sample, but since your skin is recorded as &#39;fragile,&#39; we will have to skip this for today.&quot; Barbara smiled a little, being afraid of needles now with her new, less-known skin. The man tells Barbara, &quot;Okay, now Sarah is going to finish up the notes, and will tell you how you will proceed with your life once we drop you home. You two can stay back here, I&#39;ll drive us back to your apartment complex Ms. Seids,&quot; to which Barbara nods in agreement. As the man closes the back of the ambulance vehicle, leaving Barbara and the woman, Sarah, alone, Barbara sits across from Sarah and puts her purse by her right once more, as the vehicle starts to move, waiting to hear directions. &quot;Alright, so good news,&quot; Sarah smiles, &quot;you are classified as a &#39;perfect fusion.&#39;&quot; &quot;A perfect fusion?&quot; Barbara asks with some confidence. &quot;Yes, it means that your fusion is impacting your physical skills very little. You are way lighter in weight and can float in longer periods in the air compared to your body type, of course, but you don&#39;t have anything that makes you incapable with your body function-wise,&quot; Sarah reads off her notes, which makes Barbara sigh deeply with gratitude. &quot;So you will need no form of a person or assistance to help you around your home. With that being said, if you are low on food or are having complications with your housing call your apartment complex, they are required by law to assist you and your apartment while we are at a shutdown,&quot; Sarah continues as she looks up to see Barbara nodding with no comment. &quot;Okay, and my recommendation to you, as a perfect fusion, is to enjoy your time in your apartment and don&#39;t be afraid to try out your new form. Do you have some type of an air tank?&quot; Sarah questions Barbara. &quot;Yeah, I have a couple of helium tanks, for my friends who want me to help prepare their kids&#39; parties,&quot; Barbara answers with a slight giggle at the end, which Sarah giggles a little back. &quot;Yeah, well maybe try it in your body a little. As a perfect fusion, your body should be able to handle itself well. Don&#39;t try to stretch yourself too much, but having some air through your left palm, where your belly is popping out a little, should be fine for your body. Either helium or your air should be fine, would recommend waiting for your doctor for a full check before trying any different substances through your left palm.&quot; &quot;Full-check?&quot; Barbara asks again, to which Sarah answers back, &quot;Yeah, about that. Since you are a perfect fusion with no need for emergency surgery or work, your full check will more than likely be at the end of the week or shortly before the government opens up to the public again, if you can put in your e-mail address and phone number here.&quot; Sarah gives Barbara her clipboard and pen, pointing her to put in her information, which Barbara writes down her information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, so do you have any questions about all of this?&quot; Sarah asks. &quot;Uhm, no I think I&#39;m all good,&quot; Barbara smiles in relief, knowing that at least she is fully functional. &quot;Great, we should be at your apartment complex soon. Until then, you can sit tight as Mark drives to your home!&quot; Sarah tells Barbara, as she puts down her clipboard and pulls out her phone. Barbara only looks around for a bit, before feeling the stop of the vehicle. After a second, Mark opens up the back of the ambulance vehicle. &quot;Alright Ms. Seids, you should be good to get off. We are at what we were told is your place.&quot; Barbara grabs her purse, and with Sarah they get off of the back, in which Barbara sees the building of her residence, &quot;Yeap! This is my place! Thank you guys!&quot; &quot;Of course,&quot; Mark replies as he waves back, &quot;Have a good week of being in your apartment!&quot; Mark and Sarah get on the driver and passenger seat of the ambulance vehicle and drive off as Barbara walks into her apartment building.</p>
