<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thieves and pickpockets are prevalent in the orphanage, even in the locker rooms where it is supposed to be a personal space. And worse, the caretakers would sometimes do a surprise inspection which started when someone sneaked in drugs. It was a screening process against banned items in the start but so, it grew into practice to steal whatever valuables the orphans have. It was a surprise to see that the cabochon-shaped gem is still there, glimmering in the dark.<br />
 <br />
After a dinner of thin fish stew and a side of rice, Ben rushed back to bed before it was even bedtime. In the solace of his room, he clutched the gem to his heart and emptied his mind. From the silence and darkness, Ben focused on a singular thought - and that was his friend Cole. His smiling face beamed at him, dimples on both cheeks, and he swore he heard his laughter echo inside his head. Even though his eyes are closed, he knew the gem was glowing brighter because of the rays sneaking into his eyelids. Strange energies wrapped around Ben and disappeared under his skin. He knew the wish was done when he felt a fleeting sense of fulfillment inside of him. Ben hid the gem underneath the thin pillows and slept. And for the first time in years, he slept like an innocent little babe wrapped around her mother&#39;s arms. It was a dreamless sleep, a foreboding welcome for the true dream that is about to come.<br />
 <br />
Ben awoke in the cold darkness, his body sinking in a soft and comfortable material that was new to his body. When he opened his eyes, he awoke to a room with high ceilings and an expansive space. The place looked strangely familiar. He arose from the bed but as he did, an alarm beside him blared its horns. A machine attached to the curtains whirred and pulled the shutters to the side, bringing sunlight and a familiar splendor to Ben&#39;s eyes. At the moment the view of the entire city unfolded, he knew why this place is so damn familiar. It&#39;s Cole&#39;s bedroom. Along with this realization came the understanding that the gem did its magic.<br />
 <br />
In his pajamas, Ben went outside the bedroom and traversed the maze that was this mansion. He wanted to explore his new home, but nature is calling. The place may be familiar but the specifics are unknown. Ben opened doors after doors. He knows the place has multiple bathrooms and he is bound to find one if he keeps opening new ones. Finally, he reached a bathroom that is as large as his bedroom that he shared with thirty other kids back in the orphanage. He rushed to a gilded toilet and relieved himself of this burden of the groin.<br />
 <br />
But something is amiss. Surely, these aren&#39;t his fingers. They are too clean, fingernails are cut and no soot under them. It&#39;s devoid of scars that healed in haste and callouses from years of manual labor. And surely this wasn&#39;t his penis. It&#39;s whiter and longer, and he is pissing way too long. But by the heavens, relieving himself truly is bliss.<br />
 <br />
After shaking off his strange penis, he walked to the mirror to see a full view of what happened. There in the reflection, he saw a familiar face that was once in his mind a day prior. Cole is staring at him, with his light-brown hair and equally shaded eyes. A shocked expression is stamped on his face, an expression that Ben knows as his. When the gem told of a change granted by the wish, he expected that it would only affect their lives. A change of bodies is a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. Aside from being ridiculously rich, Cole got some decent looks. Probably a product of his privileged upbringing. Ben spun around, exploring his new body and satisfying himself with how better it is than his previous one.<br />
 <br />
After doing so, he matted his unkempt hair and went out of the bathroom, meeting a sweet aroma that lured him into the dining room. Cole&#39;s father was there reading a newspaper while writing something on a notepad. Ben met the guy multiple times in the past, each time was met with a disdainful look. It was like he could sense that Ben is someone to look down on. Cole&#39;s father, or in this case, his father placed down the pen and looked at Ben.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ben, did you do your homework yesterday? Your principal said that your professors left you with assignments for the entire weekend.&quot; Martin said with a stern voice and ended with a sip of his black coffee.<br />
 <br />
Ben was surprised. Seeing that he now has Cole&#39;s life and body, he expected that he would be called Cole. Hearing his real name coming out from his father&#39;s mouth, however, surprised him more.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Yes, I think so…&quot; Ben said.<br />
 <br />
From the way his father&#39;s eyebrow twitched, it seems that it was the wrong answer. Before his father started to nag, Ben followed the answer with a quick excuse. It is a skill that one learns when he wants to de-escalate a nag fest from the orphanage caretakers. &quot;I already did them, but Mr. Lynch might send more questions in the online school portal since he was gone this week.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Good, I don&#39;t want you falling behind your class. Also, your mother and I discussed that you should take cram school while it&#39;s still early starting next month.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Yes, father.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The clock tolled and a cuckoo came out of the nest. One look at the time and Ben&#39;s father left for his job, leaving Ben alone to eat breakfast. That means more for Ben. He stacked flapjacks on his plate and bathed them in butter and maple syrup. He could count the time he ate flapjacks on his finger, so eating another one is always a luscious surprise. His mouth exploded with a multitude of sweetness that made Ben pig out on stacks after stacks. And lucky for him, the chef kept on cooking and the food kept on coming. By the end of it, his face is a sticky mess. A maid came over to wipe the mess with a damp cloth and plucked out his pajamas before leaving him with a fresh set of newly bought casual wear.<br />
