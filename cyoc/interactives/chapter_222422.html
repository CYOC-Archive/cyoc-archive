<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Guess I’m first,” Milo said, reaching over and grabbing his card. But before he could grab it, Harry said, <br />
“Wait!” He pointed at the box, seeing that some words were appearing,<br />
‘A New Game Has Begun, The Game is Reversed. Starting Player is the Winner’<br />
<br />
“So I guess it’s me then. Right?” Isabella asked,<br />
“Suppose so,” Judy said, “followed by Harry, then me, then Milo,”<br />
“Last place; as usual.” Harry teased his best friend,<br />
“Not true.” Milo replied, smirking, their chemistry not dwindling despite the circumstances.<br />
Isabella reached over and grabbed her first and only change card, turning it over,<br />
“It says ‘Nerdy Braces’… huh.” She said,<br />
“Oh that’s the one I got! Last round… I think at the start?”<br />
“Yeah, you did,” Judy said, seeing a sparkle on Isabella’s teeth, “can you open your mouth sweetie?” She asked,<br />
“Sure.” Isabella said. She opened her mouth, showing off her teeth. They all watched as braces began to form, a small bracket appearing on all her visible teeth, and before long a wire threaded itself through them, <br />
“I mean you had pretty straight teeth beforehand.” Harry commented, making his girlfriend chuckle a little,<br />
“They could always be straighter; just like me.” She joked. She didn’t get much of a laugh, but she enjoyed the joke.<br />
She ran her finger across her new braces, feeling the unnaturally bumpy texture, and vaguely achy jaw. If they played this for over five hours, she could imagine the pain getting a lot worse. <br />
<br />
“Let me tell you, you look a lot better with braces than Milo did.” Judy teased,<br />
“Heeey! I actually had braces when I was in High School!”<br />
“It’s true,” Harry chimed in, “I was there the whole time!”<br />
“Not cool.” Milo said grumpily, yet lightheartedly.<br />
<br />
“Me next then!” Harry said. He leaned forward to grab his card. <br />
Milo caught a glimpse of his cleavage. He was not sure how to feel, staring into not only his best friends cleavage… but his best friend. With cleavage.<br />
“Card says…” he turned it over, “Eyes of Emerald.” He said,<br />
“Wait,” Isabella started, “didn’t you get…”<br />
“That one in the first round?”<br />
“Yeah… I think I did.” Harry said, shrugging. He turned to face the group. His eyes brown colour shifted, becoming more shiny, gorgeous, mesmerising. Before too long, he had two dazzling gemstone coloured eyes,<br />
“N-no… they were blue,” Isabella stated, “I remember them. They were just as… as majestic, but definitely blue.”<br />
“Weird coincidence you’d get such a similar card on your first turn,” Judy said, “maybe theres a theme?<br />
“I guess,” Harry said, “let’s keep playing to find out.” He said.<br />
<br />
Everyones gaze averted to Judy. She reached down and grabbed her card, turning it over, “Feline Ears,” she said, “yep. This game is definitely repeating itself.”<br />
“That’s strange, maybe it’s the first round, but I’m feeling some déjà-vu for sure.” Harry said.<br />
Everyone looked at Judy, past her silicone injected… everything; they watched the top of her head sprout two pointy cat-like eats, resting atop her head. Strangely, despite her hair only being dyed blonde, they came out covered in platinum blonde fur. Made at least Milo wonder if her hair was actually that colour as opposed to just dyed. They were playing with magic after all.<br />
<br />
“And now me,” Milo said, reaching over, grabbing his card, “it says: ‘Uncontrollably Horny’…” he spoke, “uh oh…” he said. He could already feel it beginning to work. His mind, already a little unfocused, was beginning to become more focussed. A little too focussed. He looked over at Judy, who seemed oddly prepared for this,<br />
“This might be a long game.” She said, “babe, whatever you need, ask me,”<br />
“I…” Milo said, trying to fight the wave of lust overcoming him. His cock was hardening, which didn’t bode well for his already somewhat tight shorts. He could feel them beginning to strain as his cock got more erect, “I’m sorry…” he said, not wanting to destroy his clothes already. He had to open his shorts, they practically swung open like a saloon door, showcasing his huge member to the crowd. Precum was already beginning to spill from the tip.<br />
As Milo opened his eyes, trying to find a way to reveal what he’d failed to mention, his gaze met Harry’s. Moving down Harry’s body, looking at his supple breasts, his slim waist, his best friends slight bulge above what he knew to be a tight pussy. He didn’t know what was coming over him, but he lusted for his best friend,<br />
“Babe!” Judy yelled, his eyes swinging to his girlfriend, she opened herself up to him. Fighting his urges, embracing another, he almost pounced onto Judy!<br />
“It only…” Milo tried to say, panting, “lasts… one round!” He finally said, his body flexed as his muscles tensed, his entire being aching for an orgasm.<br />
<br />
Isabella and Harry looked at each other, Isabella said, “I think we need to speed through the next round!”<br />
“Yep…” Harry said, looking over at his best friend becoming practically feral on his girlfriend. Luckily for her, there was a lot of her, and she was pretty strong,<br />
“Come on!” Judy said, “you can play with my tits! But not in front of Harry and Izzy!”<br />
“Yes…” Milo said, latching himself onto her breasts, trying to pull her dress down to reveal her bust,<br />
“I wouldn’t mind doing this round as quick as possible!” Judy said, trying to keep her dress from being torn, considering it was especially made for her.</p>
