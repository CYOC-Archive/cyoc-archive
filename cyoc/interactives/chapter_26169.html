<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd initially didn’t believe Mary. Magical vials that can turn a human into an animal hybrid; Hogwash, Todd thought. On the other hand, Mary wasn’t one to lie. Perhaps, Todd wondered, this was all a ploy, a strange attempt at foreplay. Todd’s perception of reality was about to change.<br />
<br />
Upon arriving at Mary’s house, a figure clad in a robe that obscured her face greeted Todd. Who was under that robe interested Todd.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you could come,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
At least, it sounded like Mary. The voice was hers, however there was an almost sensual tone to it. Mary normally only spoke like this if she was in that sort of mood.<br />
<br />
“Mary, is that you?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
Before Todd could say or ask anything of Mary, she removed the robe. Todd gasped; standing before him was a beautiful skunk woman. She still had all Mary’s curves, however she now also had fur and a tail.<br />
<br />
Todd felt a familiar stirring in his jeans; whatever Mary had done to herself, the result was certainly … interesting.<br />
<br />
“What did you…”<br />
<br />
“I told you. So, want to try this form out?” Mary asked with a wink.<br />
<br />
“I dunno. Being a skunk person is one thing … you want me to become a girl?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“I can see it in your eyes Todd, you want to try this out,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
Todd didn’t get a chance to respond before Mary dashed over to him and put her tail around his body.  She ran her right fingers down the side of Todd’s face. Todd felt his building erection grow stronger. His resistance was fading as he groaned in approval, assuming he had much resistance to the idea to begin with.<br />
<br />
“W…we can reverse this?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“Yep, so we can try all sorts of forms out without fear of getting stuck that way,” Mary replied.<br />
<br />
That was enough for Todd. Mary seemed fine. As long as he could reverse this, Todd was sure things could work out. Besides, he was curious how being female felt. Why pass up the opportunity if life presented you with it?<br />
<br />
“What the hell, let’s give it a try,” Todd said.<br />
<br />
Mary backed off, much to Todd’s disappointment. She grabbed his right hand and led him into the kitchen where she kept the vials. Todd watched Mary make a concoction by pouring the contents into a shot glass. When she was done, she licked her lips and handed it to Todd.<br />
<br />
“I just have to drink this thing?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
Todd took the glass and started getting cold feet. “I dunno, this is kinda weird … even for me.”<br />
<br />
“You’ll never know unless you try it,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
Todd was still nervous. However, he knew that he wasn’t going to get anywhere standing there unable to decide. Without a second thought, he brought the glass to his mouth and drank down the liquid.<br />
<br />
When he was done, he put the glass on a table. This was it; the potion was inside him. Now, all we could do was wait. This made him nervous, it was inside him, and there was no escaping it.<br />
<br />
“Great! Once you’re done we can go out and have a night on the town!” Mary said.<br />
<br />
Todd kept staring at Mary’s body. She was gorgeous like this. He felt the stirring in his pants growing tighter to the point where it was begging for release.<br />
<br />
The inhibitions that had become a part of Todd’s life for longer then he could remember started to fade away.<br />
<br />
“Must get out of these clothes,” Todd whispered.<br />
<br />
“Then by all means … don’t hold back,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
Todd took his shirt off and threw it to the ground. He was feeling light-headed, as though this concoction was making him drunk. He unzipped and unbuttoned his pants before sliding them down his legs and stepping out of then. The tent his lust was making in his briefs became obvious immediately. However, instead of feeling shame, Todd felt amused.<br />
<br />
“Looks like Todd Jr. wants to come out and play,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
Todd was about to pull his underwear down to show Mary just how much ‘little Todd’ wanted to play when he felt a sudden warmth surround his groin.<br />
<br />
“Whoa!” Todd said.<br />
<br />
Looking down, Todd watched three things happen at the same time. His hips widened, stretching his briefs. His waist narrowed slightly. The most damning change came when the tent in briefs began to shrink. Todd felt as though someone were pulling on his pride and joy.<br />
<br />
In a matter of seconds, Todd felt much different down there. He nervously slipped off his now strained briefs.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God, it happened for real!” Todd said.<br />
<br />
In place of his male groin was now an unmistakable female equivalent. It appeared not as though some force had re-shaped Todd’s body but as though he’d been born this way.<br />
<br />
Things were just getting started. Todd’s chest started to tingle.<br />
<br />
“Um Mary, maybe this w…wasn’t such a good idea,” Todd said.<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you interested in exploring a little?” Mary asked.<br />
<br />
Todd in fact was interested. He was holding back only because Mary was there. What he didn’t want Mary to know was that he’d only said that question because while the idea of what was happening to him intrigued him, he felt obligated to say it. If anything, he feared he’d like this and not want to change back.<br />
<br />
The tingling on Todd’s chest turned to warmth. The first changes started with his nipples growing in size. Todd licked his lips as his nipples doubled in size.<br />
<br />
“Mary … I … ooooooooooo.”<br />
<br />
A pressure build from under Todd’s nipples, he gasped as the skin around and under them started to stretch and then expand. A pair of breasts started out small but then expanded all while Todd gasped.<br />
<br />
“Must … sit down,” Todd said.<br />
<br />
Mary helped Todd over the couch even as his breasts expanded. Once on the couch, Todd closed his eyes as he put his hands around his breasts. The new part between his legs was tingling and he was panting.<br />
<br />
“I h…have breasts!” Todd gasped.<br />
<br />
“I guess so,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
Todd giggled, as his breasts seemed to settle into place a nice healthy size, neither too big nor too small. They were not quite Mary’s size. However, Todd knew he wasn’t a natural female and thus didn’t want to outdo Mary in that regard.<br />
<br />
“I have to say, not bad,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
“But I th…thought this was going to make me a skunk lady?” Todd asked, still gasping.<br />
<br />
“Geeze Todd if you need it that bad then by all means, don’t stop on my account,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
Todd’s belly began to itch. All of his muscles ached. Other then his chest and groin, he was still otherwise a male. He felt a little dizzy and suddenly everything seems clearer. This was just the beginning, Todd knew there was much more to come.<br />
<br />
“Weird, I feel ... funny,” Todd said.<br />
<br />
“Duh, you’re turning into a skunkette!” Mary said with a playful tone.<br />
<br />
“No, I mean, I understand things. Whoa!” Todd gasped.<br />
<br />
Fur began pushing out of Todd’s body from virtually every bit of skin. he felt faint; something she expected would happen for such an extreme change to her body. The world around her seemed to fade as her tailbone tingled. Then, everything went dark.<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
Todd awoke on the couch with a slight headache.<br />
<br />
He … she sat up and looked over her body. It had worked, she was a fur covered female. She even had a tail with the characteristic stripe of a skunk. Her belly and chest were white, as were her hands and feet.<br />
<br />
“Remarkable!” she said in a voice that was without doubt, female.<br />
<br />
Her mind was abuzz with the implications of this. She wasn’t sure how, but she remembered her biology lessons from high school. Textbook words that used to be meaningless to her now meant something. It was though she were remembering a play and now understood the symbolism in it, allowing her to enjoy it on a different level.<br />
<br />
What had happened to her body was incredible! It was impossible yet, here she was, a humanoid skunk!<br />
<br />
“You’re awake!” Mary said as she walked into the room.<br />
<br />
Mary was now wearing a large white tee shirt that covered most of her body. Todd felt a little disappointed. This may have boosted her intelligence but she was still flesh and blood. Interestingly enough, she still appeared to be attracted to the female form.<br />
<br />
“How do I look?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“You make a cute skunk lady,” Mary said with a giggle.<br />
<br />
“I hope you don’t take offence to this but I still find you attractive,” Todd said.<br />
<br />
“Really? Well, that’s weird, but meh, in this day and age it’s not like it’s that big of a deal,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
“Mary, I know this is going to sound weird but do you still have the source code for that program we tried to write in college a couple of years back?” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I think so. Why do you ask?” Mary asked.<br />
<br />
“Because I think I know why it wasn’t working!” Todd replied.</p>
