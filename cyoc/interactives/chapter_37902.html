<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We should keep them this size&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don't want my sister to remain a doll&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Jeff!&quot; Suzy said with relief evident in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff is a boy and doesn't care anything about you!&quot; Emma said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why wouldn't I care about my sister?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You had made it so she couldn't touch anything of your's or go into your room!&quot; Emma said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did that to avoid a repeat of what happened when you got your hands on the Chronivac the first time&quot; Jeff said. &quot;It looks like I should have done the same to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see Suzy!&quot; Emma said. &quot;Jeff doesn't care about you! He freely admitted that he did that! That's not something someone who cares about you would do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were going to leave us as dogs!&quot; Jeff said. &quot;You were going to leave Tony as an ass! You even deleted his old profile! We had the right to try and protect ourselves you psycho bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma laughs and says &quot;Tony as the symbol of stupidity. That's classic. He deserves it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to be careful what you say&quot; Tony said. &quot;I'm the one holding you. I could accidentally squeeze until you pop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Emma's not worth it Tony&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You don't want her death on your conscience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your right&quot; Tony said with a heavy sigh. &quot;Though it's fun threatening her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you truly think that then you're no better than she is&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know where that came from&quot; Tony said.<br />
<br />
Lisa noticed a smirk on Emma's face. &quot;Emma messed with Tony&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly scanned Tony and after a couple of minutes said &quot;He seems to be fine. I don't see anything out of the ordinary here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I'm sure that Emma did something.&quot; She went over to Jeff's side and started looking through Tony's settings. After a few minutes she said &quot;Here it is. She tried to erase the evidence of what she did but fortunately you had saved his profile with TransDem. She must have set it to slowly change his personality. He's slowly becoming anti-social and quick to anger. If we hadn't caught this in time he could have gone on a murder spree.<br />
The Chronivac wouldn't be able to bring back the people that he killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it can change reality&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can to a point&quot; Lisa said. &quot;If Tony had killed anyone the Chronivac could alter reality so he didn't kill them but they would remain dead. If we wanted to make them live we would have had to engage TransDem's temporal services. Those services are expensive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That explains how the TransDem employee was able to respond to my call so fast the last time Emma got her hands on the Chronivac&quot; Tony said. &quot;They used some sort of temporal device to come back in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we could go back and register Tony's original profile before Emma deleted it&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Like I said before though, it's expensive. It's better to use it only in certain situations. Besides that, Tony likes his new body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet I do&quot; Tony said. &quot;I'll kill anyone who would turn me back into who I was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better zap him quick&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right&quot; Jeff said as he pressed a few buttons. He hit enter and the energy wave hit Tony.<br />
<br />
Tony blinked and said &quot;Oh man! I can't believe Emma would do that! I was starting to have thoughts of killing you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm betting that Emma was betting on you losing it in the doll house and killing us&quot; Lisa said. &quot;She kept your morals intact deep down. It would have been torture for you if you had killed even one of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She really is psycho&quot; Felicia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a new low for her&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least it didn't succeed&quot; Jack said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may have partially succeeded&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Tony still has to live with what he thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could wipe his memory&quot; Clarie suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Tony said. &quot;I want to remain aware of everything Emma has done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, I'm sure&quot; Tony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we should see if Emma did anything to Suzy&quot; Lisa said. &quot;The Suzy I know wouldn't have done this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you might be right&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Suzy may have thought that us turning ourselves into dogs was funny but I didn't think that she had such a mean streak in her.&quot; Jeff scanned Suzy and after a few minutes said &quot;Well Emma deleted her profile so I have no idea if she did anything or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a good thing that I saved Suzy's profile with TransDem before you got your Chronivac&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you had yours?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three months longer than you've had yours&quot; Lisa answered. &quot;Now I have a phone call to make.&quot; She pressed #* to get back to phone functionality and dialed TransDem Labs.<br />
<br />
&quot;TransDem Labs Lifeline&quot; a female voice said. &quot;How may I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to allow a friends Chronivac to access my saved profiles&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I need your name&quot; the lady said.<br />
<br />
&quot;My original name is Richard Michael Kilpatrick&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the name of your friend?&quot; the lady asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff Walton&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
After a couple of minutes the lady said &quot;Ok, I have set that up for you. Will there be anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at the moment&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; the lady said. &quot;Thank you for being a TransDem customer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Lisa said then hung up. &quot;You should be able to access the profiles that I saved now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good deal&quot; Jeff said as he typed on his laptop. &quot;I should do that too so you can access the profiles that I save.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That service costs money&quot; Lisa said. &quot;My mom and dad may kill me for using it. I hope that they'll understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do they charge for that?&quot; Tony asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;TransDem is a business&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff hasn't gotten a bill for his Chronivac&quot; Eric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;TransDem sent out some free Chronivacs to random people&quot; Lisa said. &quot;It's a test marketing deal. The people who receive a Chronivac during this time get all of TransDem's services that are included with the Chronivac. That includes saving up to ten profiles free. After that you're charged for each additional profile you save. You also get the lifeline which I just called. You get the<br />
reality change service free. Except of course for making sure someone didn't die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How much is it to save over ten profiles?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It costs one hundred dollars for each profile saved over ten every six months&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That could get expensive&quot; Jeff said. &quot;How much is it costing you to allow me to access your saved profiles?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That costs fifty dollars per month per Chronivac&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So if you allow two Chronivacs to access your saved profiles, you would be charged one hundred dollars a month&quot; Tony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right&quot; Lisa said. &quot;It can get very expensive if you're not careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have Suzy's saved profile up now&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
Lisa looked at the screen and said &quot;Emma did do something to Suzy. It looks like she transferred some of her personality traits to Suzy. That explains a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad that you were able to save Suzy's profile before Emma messed with her&quot; Jeff said as he restored Suzy's personality. &quot;That was a lucky break.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't luck&quot; Lisa said. &quot;The day after I became friends with Suzy a guy came up to me and told me to save Suzy Walton's profile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He must have been a TransDem employee&quot; Claire said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tony, could you set Suzy down so I can return her to her normal size?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing&quot; Tony said and set Suzy down.<br />
<br />
Jeff zapped Suzy and she started to grow. Soon she was back to her original height. As soon as she was she said, with tears running down her face, &quot;I'm sorry Jeff. Emma, Suzy, and Heather had come over looking for Eric and Jack. I showed them the tape I made of you guys turning into dogs. I thought that it was funny and that they'd get a laugh out of it. I didn't know how far Emma would take it. After she figured out how to use the Chronivac she insisted on<br />
scanning me to prevent you from changing me. She said that I would be their back-up in case you changed them. I was their 'ace in the hole'. After Emma had zapped me I wanted to punish you guys and I was having fun. I swear that I didn't know Emma would do that! I'm so sorry! To think that you could have been stuck as dogs and an ass forever like Emma had planned. Or worse, being killed like Emma had evidently planned now. Tony, Lisa, I'm sorry that I forced you to have sex.&quot; She sat down on her bed and buried her head in her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's ok&quot; Tony said. &quot;That wasn't the real you. Now you're back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the things Emma wanted to do to you&quot; Suzy said. &quot;I was a part of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn't you&quot; Jeff said. &quot;I need to know something. Did Emma also scan Heather and Suzy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Suzy said. &quot;She said that I was the only one that needed to be protected. That I was ideally placed in case you did something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it looks like you get three new dolls&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
Jeff scanned Emma, Suzy, and Heather. After a few minutes of typing he zapped them again. Their struggles stopped as their skin became plastic and a blank look came over their faces. &quot;Well they're dolls now&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Emma won't be giving us any more trouble. I've also made it so they are aware and their families don't remember them. Take good care of them Suzy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will&quot; Suzy said. &quot;Are you going to leave them like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For awhile&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Maybe after a few months I'll change them back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said before that you didn't think that the guy who came to see you was a TransDem employee&quot; Tony said. &quot;Why do you think that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's simple really&quot; Lisa said. &quot;If one of us had called the lifeline a TransDem employee would have gone back to make sure that Suzy wasn't changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So who do you think it was?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It had to have been one of us&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I'm betting that it was Suzy herself that came back. From when I don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean I'll become a guy?&quot; Suzy asked. &quot;I don't think I want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than likely it will only be for that one instance&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that I could handle that then&quot; Suzy said. &quot;If it helps to save me. I'm glad that you're my friend Lisa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're nuts for having her as your friend&quot; Phil said. &quot;She's a guy for crying out loud!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a guy&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I freely admit that. Now though, I am a girl. I like being a girl and don't plan on going back to being a guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you want to be a girl?&quot; Craig asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I felt like I was in the wrong body&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I fixed that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're gay&quot; Phil said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all&quot; Lisa said. &quot;When I was a guy I liked girls. Now that I'm a girl I'm getting into boys. I did enjoy the sex Tony. Even though it was forced. Could you restore my virginity Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure&quot; Jeff said as he typed.<br />
<br />
Lisa felt the energy wave hit her when Jeff hit enter. She felt her hymen reform making her a virgin once again. &quot;Thank you Jeff&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome&quot; Jeff said.</p>
