<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Naomi swam over in time to read Irene&#39;s latest note, and had to laugh. As bad as all this had been, seeing this almost made it worth it. Almost. Irene indicated they should stay where they are, to which he just gestured at how they didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go. Charlotte gave her another hug. What was it about being a mermaid that made her so big on physical contact anyway?<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
A loud shot rang out over the water, sending the ducks, and Mark, scattering. It took some time to calm down, realizing she hadn&#39;t been shot, and land to catch her breath. Tran landed nearby shortly thereafter, setting his case down carefully before hopping over, all his feathers ruffled and a look of incredible anger on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you drop the case you ditz we need those files to rebuild when we get there what were you even thinking!&quot; he started shouting in a huff.<br />
<br />
The rational part of her mind was reassuming control, at least as well as it ever had since her transformation. He&#39;s right he&#39;s right I shouldn&#39;t have dropped it we need all that it&#39;s how to build chambers and be human again and get rich and do research and now Tran&#39;s mad and he&#39;ll hate me and leave and I&#39;ll be all alone and I need him he can&#39;t be mad I have to make it up to him wait I have a fish I can give him the fish at least maybe then he&#39;ll stop yelling. She held it up in a shaking talon, saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t mean to drop it I just wasn&#39;t thinking look see there&#39;s nice big fish in the water you can have this one I&#39;ll get us more just please don&#39;t be mad I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tran snatched the fish away in his teeth, tilted his head back and did his best to swallow it all at once. Their digestive system was built to handle things like that, but their mostly human mouths still made it rather awkward. Once he finished, he continued his tirade. &quot;Just shut up and go get it they&#39;re reinforced cases it might still be fine but it won&#39;t be for long now go go go fish it out and bring it back here it&#39;s too cold and loud here we need to keep going but first get the case go go go!&quot;<br />
<br />
As she quickly returned to the air, trying to find where she&#39;d dropped it, she saw the humans approaching Tran to talk. They heard them shouting and saw them and now they want to talk but they really didn&#39;t want anyone to see them not this close they might say something and someone would stop them and stuff them in a tiny space again and no no no but Tran would tell them something and they&#39;d leave and it&#39;d be OK she just needed the case and more fish too she was still hungry she gave hers away and there&#39;s another she had time to catch it she hated getting wet but she had a fish and it was good and it filled her up and she wasn&#39;t hungry now so she could fly back to Tran but no she need the case the case where&#39;d she drop the case? It was there it was shiny the water was too cold and the case was stuck in the mud and she hated this she hated this but there she had it it was OK it was OK she just needed to drag it away.<br />
<br />
Mark looked at the mud-caked metal briefcase, water still streaming along the seam. Is it OK it has to be OK everything is ruined if it isn&#39;t OK she should open it and see if everything inside is OK how did she open it? She thought for a moment. Her mind still mostly functioned in a human fashion when it wasn&#39;t being overridden by instinct or high stress, but the mental rewiring that came from trading hands for wings made it quite hard to think about anything a human would use her fingers for. It opens here there&#39;s a big seam and first you pry the things here and here but before you do that there&#39;s the combination you have to make the numbers spin and be the right combination it&#39;s 6124 and that&#39;s easy to remember because it looks like &#39;bird&#39; and I&#39;m a bird now and that&#39;s easy but how do you make them spin? She clawed frantically at the case, then stood it up and attempted to grab the tumblers with her teeth. This wasn&#39;t working she couldn&#39;t get it open but wait she could just fly up real high and find a rock and drop it and it would smash the shell and she could get at what was inside but no no no she couldn&#39;t do that she&#39;d break everything she didn&#39;t want to break everything she wanted to make sure it wasn&#39;t broken it&#39;s not like food with a shell it&#39;s like an egg she had to make sure it didn&#39;t break and it didn&#39;t look broken so it was fine she could go tell Tran it was fine it would be OK and they&#39;d go somewhere warm and dry and make a nest and take care of the case and their eggs.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Irene searched the whole facility for any sign of a technician, but the Tran had been the last to depart. The female naga was fully capable of operating everything, but neither Irene nor even Lawrence had no way of knowing that. She&#39;d radically altered the human aspect of her appearance, and had every incentive in the world to play dumb and pretend to be another abductee. The pair of lizards were also former researchers, but in addition to having just as much reason to play dumb, in their case it wasn&#39;t entirely an act. Their transformation had rendered their grey matter largely vestigial in a grave miscalculation. As reptiles normally didn&#39;t even possess the physical parts of the brain required for any rational thought, they weren&#39;t currently making use of them, for now just acting on pure instinct, or not acting, more accurately. Their habitat was nice and warm, and they weren&#39;t particularly hungry, so what reason was there to move at all?<br />
<br />
Lawrence meanwhile had found the hatch used for feeding the merfolk, and opened it up. Charlotte swam up, eager to get out of the water and hold a proper conversation, but quickly she discovered the limits of her form. First, her ears and larynx had been adapted to function Any attempt to fill her lungs with air and speak to the winged horse pulling her out just resulted in a high pitched whine that hurt his ears. She felt incredibly heavy as well, her body having been designed to be supported by its natural buoyancy. More importantly, as her gills cleared the water, she began to suffocate. She began panicking and flopping about until Lawrence realized what was happening and pushed her back in, apologizing profusely.<br />
<br />
Naomi rushed over, deeply concerned, and made sure she was swimming properly again. Once she&#39;d recovered her composure, Charlotte gave a thumbs down to Irene through the glass and shook her head. Irene had returned to hold up a sign saying &quot;NO TECHS&quot; but also a cell phone one of the transformed researchers had abandoned. Charlotte nodded, realizing she must be calling someone from the park to get things sorted out. Hopefully whoever it was would be more trustworthy than the Minotaur had been. Naomi actually looked a lot more worried than Charlotte felt after her brief ordeal, so she gave him a big hug and lead him away towards the hatch in the floor. The dark tunnel it led to would give them a little privacy to compose themselves. Charlotte rested her head on his shoulder, reassuring him that help was on the way, and soon enough they&#39;d be &quot;a pair of hot sexy bitches&quot; again. Still embracing, she suddenly felt the odd sensation of something squirming about and prodding at her groin. Respecting Naomi&#39;s issues, she tried shifting away to one side and felt it follow. Was Naomi really ready to try things like this, or did Little Naomi just sort of have its own independent guidance system?<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Tran managed to convince the hunters they were regular park guests, out testing their new wings, which raised an eyebrow or two. Fortunately, none asked about the briefcases. He should find Mark it was weird calling her Mark now she really didn&#39;t look like a Mark or like a Martha or whatever it would be but really they&#39;d need to change their names anyway since they were fugitives but not until after they met their contact down south and really they should get going soon and he probably shouldn&#39;t have yelled at Mark like that his instincts were almost as strong and she&#39;d made up for it with that fish and just look at her there all cold and wet and shaking to try and dry herself off it was honestly a little sexy and now he just felt guilty he should make it up to her before they leave &quot;Sorry for yelling at you like that but you can&#39;t just go dropping things and flying into danger and we&#39;re still too close to stop we need to keep going as long as we can and then find some trees or a big roof or something where we won&#39;t be bothered when it&#39;s time to stop you know people will probably come looking for us with helicopters and these feathers are easy to spot we really should keep going at least get out of the state before dark who knows maybe we can get all the way to Mexico nobody can follow us into Mexico it&#39;ll be clear skies when we get that far right?&quot; He moved in to give her a kiss, and rubbed up against the side of her head for good measure. That calmed her down she even looked a bit excited he had to consider doing a bit more but it was too dangerous to do that here they had to keep moving plenty of time for that later when they were somewhere warm can&#39;t forget the case don&#39;t let her forget the other case time to fly off again.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s the story with these does anyway? Bunch of college girls they suckered in with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, they&#39;re all a bunch of overgrown frat boys too. Apparently they had some stupid bet going, the does are the losers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tasha was rather incensed by this. She&#39;d had to deal with entirely too much misogyny in her life to have any sort of tolerance for people treating womanhood as some sort of punishment. &quot;Well, their ringleader is probably in violation of some gaming laws, but that&#39;s hardly much of a charge under the circumstances. There&#39;s a case to be made for the whole thing being a form of rape, but only if the does are willing to press charges... what I&#39;d really like to follow up on here though is whatever paperwork was involved, and the names of whoever signed off on this from the park&#39;s side.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Brian meanwhile had been asked to explain things to the does, which wasn&#39;t going well. Half had wandered off to find &quot;their bucks&quot; the second they had the chance, and the rest were giving him some serious bedroom eyes. He&#39;d tried explaining to all of them the seriousness of pregnancy, and how their best bet was to start eating berries now as something of a morning after pill, not that it was always successful. Of course, none of them listened. He couldn&#39;t even work out anyone&#39;s original name. Apparently they&#39;d all adopted the degrading nicknames they&#39;d been given. Cherry was actually the classiest. Apparently there was also a Bimbo present, a Sweetcheeks, a Jugs... he&#39;d almost thrown up when he learned the one getting into a possessive argument with Cherry was seriously insisting she just be called &quot;Big Tits&quot; of all things. It was just monstrous what had apparently been done to them.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Goldie was still dealing with a different sort of monster.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was it again you used to always brag about doing to them?&quot; Max asked, walking right up to her. &quot;You&#39;d lick their throats and give&#39;em a little grope like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldie shoved him away as hard as she could when he reached for her, sending him crashing into the bench on the opposite side of the cell. Did he really want to see her back in full predator mode? He was nothing next to her right now physically. She could end this whole thing with just one good solid bite. It was better than what he deserved...</p>
