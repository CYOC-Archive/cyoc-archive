<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan sat back on her haunches, twitching her nose and thinking. After moment, she asked, &quot;So what do you want to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Slightly agitated, Mary squeaked out, &quot;Well I cannot go very far on two legs,&quot; and rolling over to get a better look at herself, she noticed that her breast had flattened out and that she now had six teats.<br />
<br />
Looking back toward the table and the vials atop, she glanced back at Susan and then announced, &quot;Help me get the vials. Maybe if I take a regulated does of the human, I can return to walking on two legs instead of four.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her nose twitching, Susan looked at the table and then at Mary, before she finally started hopping across the room. Reaching the table, she looked at the chairs and after a moments thought, wondering why it was that she felt so addled in the mind, she hopped onto the chair. Behind her, a scrabbling noise could be heard and turning, she saw Mary moving across the room.<br />
<br />
Hopping up onto the table, she peered into the box, attempting to sort the vials out. Behind her, Mary was fooling with another chair and one of the kitchen drawers and after a moment, she dropped with a heavy thud to the floor and made her way to the table.<br />
<br />
Peering over the edge, Susan saw that Mary had what appeared to be a thimble in her mouth and jumping down, she asked, &quot;What do you want me to do?&quot; forgetting for the moment how hard it was to comprehend what has written on the vials.<br />
<br />
Dropping the vial, Mary told her, &quot;Measure out an equal part of human with an equal part of mouse into the thimble. Next, I am going to ask you to pour it into my mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding seeing the logic in this, Susan nodded and twitching her nose, she picked up the thimble and was about to jump back up, when she asked, &quot;Why don't you measure it out and then pour it into you mouth? Why do I have to?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary, who was scrabbling up onto the chair, looked at her friend and said, &quot;Because for some reason my paws have a hard time holding the thimble. And, I am thinking that I might also have a problem measuring out the correct dosage so that I can still be a mouse, but at the same time be human,&quot; and then climbed atop the table, failing to realise that she had said the last three words of her speech in a combination of squeaks, clicks and chittering noises.<br />
<br />
Susan, who understood perfectly what Mary had just said and completely missed the shift in speech-patterns, grasped the thimble and with two easy jumps, ascended up onto the table.<br />
<br />
Glancing in the direction of the clock, she worried that they might not make the cruise. And then shrugged it off, figuring that they had plenty of time as she made her way over to the box containing the vials, grasping the thimble close to her body.<br />
<br />
Peering in, she set the thimble down and began to pour over the various thimbles. Extracting the one with a picture of the mouse, noting that underneath the picture was a circle with a plus sign attached to it. Not understanding what the funny drawing meant, the difference between the male and female symbols escaping her, she instead started to search for the human vial.<br />
<br />
Moments later, she turned to a distressed Mary and asked, &quot;Which one should I use?&quot; as she held up to vials, one with the circle and plus symbol and the other with the circle and an arrow point off to the right a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care,&quot; Mary squeaked out. &quot;They both are human and should make me human. Mix them both.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, seeing the logic in this, Susan grasped the mouse vial and carefully measured out a third into the thimble. Next, she repeated the act and measured out two thirds from the human vials into the thimble. Moving in a clumsy fashion over to Mary, trying not to spill the concoction, she reached over and poured the contents into her best friend's mouth.<br />
<br />
Tongue flicking out and back in, licking her mouse lips, Mary commented, &quot;Tastes like cheese, strawberries and blueberries all at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peering at her friend, Susan asked, &quot;Do you feel any change?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary sat on her haunches and looked down her body, rubbing a paw-like hand over her torso in a clumsy manner. After a moment, she shook her head and said, &quot;Nope. Maybe it takes a moment,&quot; and turning, she dropped to all fours and started toward the edge of the table.<br />
<br />
Looking at the thimble and then the box of vials, Susan thought about taking a couple with her, just in case something happened to her that made her want to change.<br />
<br />
Before she could make a decision, a squeak from the edge of the table, followed by a thud, broke her concentration and hopping to the edge of the table, she looked down, taking in Mary's sprawled form below.<br />
<br />
Nose twitching, Susan hopped down onto the chair and then the floor. Approaching Mary, she heard her friend moan out, &quot;It hurts,&quot; and twitching her nose, Susan explained, &quot;Well that's what you get for falling off the...&quot; but stopped as she realised that her best friend was transform yet again.<br />
<br />
Before Susan's eyes, Mary's vulva shifted and the started to bulge out into a thin, pink shaft, complete with a hard, little nub at the base. As Susan watched her friend grow a penis, she noted with some curiosity as Mary's chest ballooned out into what Susan was sure would be an A sized cup if she had been her normal height.<br />
<br />
Another moan from Mary and looking back at the penis, Susan watched as it slowly sank back into a protective sheath, but noted that even though Mary now had a penis and testicles, her vagina did not close.<br />
<br />
A crack distracted Susan's train of thoughts and looking over her friend, listening as she continued moaning pain, Susan could have sworn she saw the bones beneath Mary's skin shift. And then it was over, almost as fast as it had begun and Susan was looking at mouse that was both male and female as Mary stood up on her hind-legs, balancing with ease, she looked down, taking in both the male and the female genitals.<br />
<br />
After moment, she said, &quot;This is so not right.&quot; as she reached down and touched her male sheath and then her female slit.</p>
