<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Locked inside what he was seeing as a nightmare, Damion wanted nothing else but to wake up. The dream had started off nice, with him being a male cat, having his way with a female. But then it&#39;d shifted and much to his displeasure and horror, he&#39;d become a girl cat asserting dominance over another of the same sex. Not wanting to be so, he was unable to do anything as things shifted and he was forced to relive his sexual prowess, but from the perspective of having a male atop of him, nipping at his neck, gripping him in place with their front paws as they thrust a barbed shaft into Damion&#39;s slick feminine folds.<br />
<br />
A yowl of discomfort and, much to his dismay, pleasure escaped him as the male withdrew, and the nightmare changed. He was squatting to pee, then teasing another male, then lying on his back, his underside on full display as he wiggled in comfort in a warm patch of sunlight. Aware he was lying on a rug, Damion turned over, and the nightmare shifted and he was taking his tongue and using it to clean his female genitals. Seeing this as insult, as it shoved his face literally into the matter of him now being female, he stopped when it suddenly came to him something was off. Standing, not sure exactly what, he started to pace back and forth, uttering plaintive meows every so often before stopping and shaking himself.<br />
<br />
Still not sure what was off, he tried to raise his tail, only to discover he didn&#39;t have one. Balance shifting, he dropped to the carpet and squirmed in place as he began to lengthen. It coming to him what was happening was he was becoming human again, Damion thought, &quot;Good,&quot; but this was all short lived as it came to him he was not changing back to a male.<br />
<br />
Trapped within his nightmare, as Damion transformed in it, he also morphed in the real world. The seal-point fur covering his body regressing like his tail had, he was soon left with smooth skin. His height and weight shifting, it wasn&#39;t long before Damion stood at four one and weighed five-five pounds. Looking like a bald girl, other features his aunt had typed into the Chronivac took shape as hair grew out of his head, took on fullness and volume as it lengthened till the point it came down past the small of his back. As this transpired, two thin eyebrows appeared over his eyes, never to get any thicker, whilst his eyes turned green. More and more of the changes occurring until what lay in the bed was a girl of eight, Damion awoke as his mind started to fill with new knowledge whilst stuff his mind no longer needed vanished.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a nightmare,&quot; he squeaked out, then, upon hearing his voice, clapped a small hand over his mouth. Missing how his room had started to change around him, Damion looked down at himself, and promptly began to moan, &quot;No, no, no, no,&quot; and without a second thought to what he, now she, was doing, Damion rolled out of what was now clearly a child&#39;s single bed and rushed across the room.<br />
<br />
It not even crossing her mind to question where the mirror had come from, she stopped in front of it and stared in open-mouthed horror at her reflection. Seeing the little girl reflected back, Damion looked down at herself. Her nipples such pale pink they were almost non-existent, what drew her attention the most was her now smooth groin which had the barest hint of cleft to indicate what she knew she now had between her legs. Glancing back at her reflection, shaking her head in denial, watching as the long brown hair she&#39;s suddenly had a desire to braid switch back and forth, Damion moaned, &quot;No. Not this. Anything but this,&quot; as it came to her how she not only looked like her former bratty cousin, but had somehow become Tanya.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a nightmare,&quot; she whispered after some time and suddenly aware of what she was doing, Tanya released the hold on her hair, which she&#39;d started to braid. Stepping back away from the mirror, she whispered, &quot;I&#39;m, Tanya,&quot; before softly exclaiming, &quot;I can&#39;t be Tanya. I&#39;m not. I&#39;m,&quot; but drew a blank as to what her male name had been.<br />
<br />
Conflicted, upset she couldn’t remember her boy name, she turned away from the mirror. Looking at the bedroom, which was slowly starting to shift to a theme of bright, pastel colours, decorations of rainbows and unicorns on the walls, and Hello Kitty sheets on the bed, Tanya shuddered as new things came to her. Recalling her life growing up a girl, how she&#39;d been taking ballet and gymnastics for the last two years, a lot of her likes and dislikes, how momma had informed her she&#39;d gotten something called an inheritance from some an aunt and uncle she didn&#39;t know, how it&#39;d been placed in a trust, Tanya glided across the room. Struggling against everything which insisted she was a girl, it suddenly came to her there was a way for her not to be her own cousin as she remembered the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Stepping over to her vanity, Tanya peered at it in a blank way. On one hand, a part of her which was still Damion felt it ought to be a desk. Yet, the part of her which was very much Tanya insisted it was exactly what it was supposed to be. This overruling any idea it was supposed to be a desk, she wondered where the Chronivac was and taking out of one the larger drawers a pair of white panties printed with pastel-coloured dinosaurs, Tanya wondered if the thing had been erased when her room had changed.<br />
<br />
Upset and frightened by such a notion, as the part of which was still very much Damion didn&#39;t want to be stuck as a girl, let along his own cousin, she pulled on the underwear then went to look for a skirt, shirt and tights to wear. Dressed, Tanya wandered back over to the mirror. Gazing at the little girl she&#39;d become, torn between thinking she looked cute, liked looking cute, and hating what she&#39;d become, Tanya again stated, &quot;This is a nightmare,&quot; as she wondered how she was to wake up from this, and if it was even possible.</p>
