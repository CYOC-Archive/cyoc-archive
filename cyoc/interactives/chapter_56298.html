<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sound of cloth ripping woke Jake up. He found that his shirt had torn into shreds <br />
while he was in the middle of a stretch, his body adjusting to make room for his <br />
enormous muscles. Then he remembered; he was Jake, the super-hot college kid that <br />
had only two things in life; muscles and sex. That was all he would ever need, and he <br />
knew everyone was either envious of him of lusted after his godlike body and sexy face. <br />
It's not surprise that he was so popular; after all he was a walking wet dream!<br />
<br />
He stood up drowsily and walked over to the mirror, estimating his new size at a little <br />
over 300lbs of pure muscle. Yeah, his face truly was the epitome of hotness. His blue <br />
eyes he inherited from his mother indicated beauty and innocence. Jake didn't car for <br />
either, but they really contrast perfectly on his masculine face that his father gave him. <br />
That straight dark brown hair enhanced his rugged appearance even more. Jake smiled, <br />
showing his flawless white teeth. Dang, if it weren't for his large muscles he could have <br />
been a model. <br />
<br />
But screw that. He liked his muscles, those muscles that could intimidate the toughest <br />
badasses in town with the most casual flex. Jake's young muscles weren't just for show, <br />
they really were deadly weapons when used properly. A couple of stupid guys tried to <br />
give shit to him the first few days of college, thinking that the body under those baggy <br />
clothes was a load of fat. Too bad for them they were wrong. That mistake cost them <br />
millions just to get their bodies back in working condition. Jake had only stayed at the <br />
college for a few weeks, but he already had the reputation as the strongest and hottest <br />
man around. He never had a dissatisfied woman, not with that freakish, superhuman <br />
baby factory that most guys call a dick...<br />
<br />
Jake snapped out of his pleasant thoughts to get ready. If he thought about his own <br />
perfection for too long, he would end up getting horny again. He brushed his teeth, <br />
ate a gigantic protein-filled breakfast, shit out all the stuff his body didn't use to grow, <br />
took a shower, toweled off, and looked for clothes. That's where things got tricky. <br />
Though his waist was a stunningly small 31 inches, his thighs couldn't fit in any of the <br />
shorts with a waist size that small. His shirts also were too small from his most recent <br />
growth spurt. Jake panicked at first, then remembered something. His mother, a very <br />
loving lady who was proud of her son's great muscles, was used to his growth spurts. <br />
She would know what to do.<br />
<br />
He bounced down the stairs nude, his heavy feet stomping on the steps and creating <br />
large booms while his cock slapped against his thighs in the motion. His mother had <br />
already heard him coming and looked up at the giant naked stud expectedly. Jake was <br />
embarrassed, but quickly blurted out, &quot;I, uh, had a growth spurt again,&quot; he paused, <br />
then continued, &quot;could you, uh, help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake's mother's face changed from a look of annoyance to pleasure. &quot;You men are so <br />
funny,&quot; she laughed, &quot;you can grow bigger and stronger than anyone around you, but <br />
you'll always be reliant on the women in your family.&quot; She walked up to Jake and <br />
gripped onto his big arms, feeling the power inside them for a second. Then she pulled <br />
herself up and just barely reaching the bottom of Jake's chin so she could kiss him, <br />
&quot;And I love you for it, Jake.&quot; <br />
<br />
The muscular son looked fazed for a moment, then smiled, &quot;Thanks, mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
His mom nodded, &quot;I'll hurry to get a good pair of shorts and a tee-shirt right now. It <br />
may not be the best, but I'll try to get something you like. Then, I'll come home and <br />
give you what I found. When you're at your classes I'll buy some more clothes so that <br />
you can have something else to wear later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake looked guilty for burdening his mom with so much work, but then hugged her <br />
tightly. Her eyes bulged and she started to breathe hard, but Jake didn't let his mom <br />
go until atleast a few seconds had passed. Letting go of her relatively puny frame, he <br />
gave her an angelic smile and thanked her one last time before letting her go to shop. <br />
He may have been the most badass irresistible musclegod in the town, but he still <br />
loved his mom as much as a child would. It wasn't something you could tease him <br />
about either, not unless you want to get your face punched in backwards and your <br />
torso crushed into a bloody pool.<br />
<br />
Lazing around, Jake wondered what to do in his free time while his mom was out <br />
buying clothes for him. His dad was at work and he didn't have anything to wear, so his <br />
natural instinct would be to workout and improve his muscles even more. He <br />
wondered, however, if there was something else he could do in the mean time...?</p>
