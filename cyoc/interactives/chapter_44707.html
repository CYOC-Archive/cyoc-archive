<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Going to wake up and join us, Football Star?&quot;<br />
<br />
Somebody clapped him on the shoulder. The class was laughing good naturedly. Parks shook his head and looked up as new memories filled his head. It was Mr. Alan, the hunky math teacher, with his big paw onParks' shoulder. His enormous chest was heaving back and forth. He was one fo the bigger teachers. He was in his late 30s and had a still extremely youthful, incredibly handsome face, and his muscles were beyond dreams. Everyone in class was submissive to him because he had those sexy older man muscles and most of them just had teenager muscles and more than one guy in class probably spent many a night jerking off to his image. Parks smirked at Mr. Alan, thinking how he had been lucky enough to service that 12 incher on a lot more than one occasion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know Mr. Alan,&quot; Parks said, and ran a hand up and down Mr. Alan's hard bicep. &quot;Maybe you'll have to give me a personal detention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone laughed even harder and looked admiringly at Parks, that hot huge jock, and the way he was able to talk practically on the same level with Mr. Alan. Parks was a true alpha in the making.<br />
<br />
Mr. Alan grabbed Parks by the back of his head and pulled him close to his own face. Parks looked up into his eyes and gasped a little, his pants (and everyone else's) tenting hard and fast. Parks' 13 incher jutted out and struck Mr. Alan's, who leaned in to him and breathed, hot, staring into his eyes. &quot;Mr. Football Star,&quot; he said, running his hands down Parks' tight 10 pack, &quot;What can I do to make you care about math? It's very important.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Mr. Alan turned and walked away, every boy in the class focused on his ass (classes were separated into boys and girls because girl alphas could not control the boys). Parks suddenly catcalled. &quot;You could teach shirtless!&quot;<br />
<br />
The entire class laughed nervously, but this was what they wanted more than anything else. Mr. Alan stopped without turning around right before the blackboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... maybe I could... but I wouldn't be comfortable just by myself. Why don't you all come sit down here with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The class became a flurry of seductive stripping. Mr. Alan sat on his desk and eyed all the boys appreciatively. The boys were stripping for him and for each other, each showing off his gym worked body. Even the geeks, who probably only dedicated 10 or 15 hours to the gym every week, weren't too bad, although they tended to be shy around the much more alpha boys. Each boy came down the hall, playfully bumping into one another and rubbing up against one another. Parks was of course the star, as usual. He waited until most of the boys had finished and then stripped his shirt off, slow, a little sweaty from the hot spring day, the smell of his deodorant and cologne filling the air. More than one boy gasped at the site of his perfect abs, his pecs popping out of his shirt, his arms that seemed even bigger out of a shirt, if that was possible. With a laughing cry Parks jumped on Jason Wang's back. Jason was hot and big, but not as big as Parks, and Jason was head over heels in puppy love. Jason grabbed Parks' hand and led him to the front of the group and they all sat at the bottom.<br />
<br />
It was Mr. Alan's turn. The entire class was rapt. Mr. Alan's piercing blue eyes took each one of them in turn. His tight, spiky blond hair was shiny in the light. His cheekbones could cut glass and his teeth dazzled, sparkling white. He had been a football star in his younger days and he still modeled, but he loved teaching the boys. Mr. Alan began with some poses, still dressed in his tank top. He lightly flexed his biceps, one after the other, producing baseball sized mounds that the kids stared at in awe. He then abruptly threw up a double bi and one of the geeks gasped &quot;Ah-ah-ah!!&quot; as he came in his shorts. Another geek handed him a tissue.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna feel 'em?&quot; Mr. Alan said to one boy. That boy nodded eagerly and started forward, first comparing his admirable but not nearly as big biceps to Mr. Alan's, and then grabbing with both hands.<br />
<br />
Abruptly Mr. Alan spread his wings and lifted the boy off the ground, and several more boys came in their pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;You--and you.&quot; He pointed to Jason and Parks. &quot;Come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason and Parks, awed and honored to have been chosen, came forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;The shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
With their big hands, they each grabbed a segment of the shirt and pulled, and with little effort tore the shirt down as simultaneously Mr. Alan threw himself into a most muscular that completely obliterated everything. No boy in class was left with dry pants.<br />
<br />
Mr. Alan was HUGE. Every muscle tensed and vibrated with life, muscles on muscles, muscles that didn't have a name. As he went into his posing routine three braver boys came forth and began licking him everywhere, making him slick and shiny with their sweat. A bunch of horny 18 year old boys with the hottest teacher in school.<br />
<br />
But Parks held it together. Abruptly Parks started in on his own posing routine, looking pretty impressive even next to Mr. Alan. Jason had eyes only for Parks and the boys were torn between where to look. Jason took off his pants and came over in his thong, grinding his body into Parks' and worshiping his amazing muscle, and Mr. Alan turned on some club beats, and the boys all fell into pairs or threesomes or foursomes, while Mr. Alan talked about calculus over them. When a boy got an answer right he would allow him to be kissed, like a teaching version of spin the bottle, but if he got it wrong he had to put his hands in the air and not touch his cock until he got one right. After a couple of minutes of blue balls the kids got with the program.<br />
<br />
After everyone had come four or five times (Parks nine--Mr. Alan an astounding 13 times), the bell rang, but it had been a good lesson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, football stars, geeks, theater boys, cheerleaders--get to your after school activities. And pop quiz tomorrow! Study!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone groaned. &quot;But Mr. Alan,&quot; someone said, &quot;We have to read all of Romeo and Mercutio tonight, and I haven't even finished reading Pride &amp; Prejudice!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bennett get together. Now,&quot; Mr. Alan said, taking that boy's eyes in his own and destroying his will with his gaze, &quot;You will study. You will all study hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mr. Alan!!!&quot; Everyone said enthusiastically, and then they all bounded out of class, hands and lips casually touching.<br />
<br />
Nobody noticed as they left that a piece of paper slipped off of Parks' desk and blew out of the window...</p>
