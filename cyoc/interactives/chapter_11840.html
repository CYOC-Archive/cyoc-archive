<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finding Jeff, Jack and Eric was even easier.  Suzy drove slowly along the road at the edge of the park and a quarter mile off they spied a huge dog, mastiff Eric, wrestling playfully with two others, one white one black and white.  As they got closer, the other three girls squealed with delight.  Emma reached for the center console and put up the windows so as not to alert the canine boys.<br />
<br />
Jeff's sister, in particular, giggled uncontrollably at the upcoming prospect.  Suzy and Heather cackled as well.  &quot;This is what you get for being such a prick Eric!&quot;  &quot;Now you'll get yours Jack!&quot;  Though Suzy did think to ask why they weren't going to change them, too, into jackasses like they'd done to Tony.  Emma explained through a huge grin as she quickly punched keys (she hadn't expected to get all three together at once) that Tony was a stuck up brainiac, a term that she knew fashion mag addict Suzy probably applied to her as well, for whom transformation into the living symbol of stupidity was the worst possible thing.  As for Jeff, Jack and Eric . .<br />
<br />
Emma finished with a dramatic pressing of the enter key.  The emitter was pointed out the window at Jeff, Jack and Eric.  All three were wrestling furiously, yet not doing anything to hurt each other.  The fury of it was such that they balanced precariously between their dog instincts and human minds.  All three found it sort of intoxicating.  There was no doubt that 200 pound mastiff Eric could easily subdue either great pyrenees Jeff or border collie Jack, but he held back just enough so that the three of them continually rolled in a ball of happy, aggressive dogs.  <br />
<br />
They scarcely noticed the electric wave pass through them and as all three shrank similarly, they just kept wrestling as they quickly diminished from their chosen forms.  They only realized what was going on Jeff and Jack were suddenly able to take the advantage and wrestle dachsund Eric onto his back as he was barely bigger than dachsund Jeff or dachsund Jack.<br />
<br />
Jeff stared down in amazement at little brown wiener dog Eric.  What the hell happened to Eric.  But, wait, why don't I tower over him like a great pyrenees should?!  All three sprang to their feet barking and yipping frantically at this horrible state of affairs.  How could this be happening?  I don't want to be some measly little dachsund!  What the fuck is going on here?!  Eric and Jack looked to Jack for an explanation.  They barked a demand for such to him.  Jack, though, was just as perplexed as they were.  There was no reason for them to be anything but the dog forms they'd chosen until midnight Monday.  &quot;Why would we change into dachsunds, and small dachsunds at that?&quot;<br />
<br />
In a moment, the reason was clear.  None of the three former boys heard the car door open, but their hysteria did lift when they had three shouting, laughing girls chasing after them.  Jeff suddenly saw his now gigantic little sister running after him just a few steps away.  He tried to bolt on his little legs but after only a few step, he felt his sister grab his chronivac generated collar, it had shrunken with him, and lift him off the ground.  She looked into his face, and laughed hysterically after reading &quot;JEFF&quot; and &quot;432 Maple Ave&quot; on his tags.  Jeff struggled to free himself but all he managed to do was twist his wiener dog body a bit while his sister laughed herself out of breath.<br />
&quot;My big brother!  Ahahahhahahahahaha!  Jeff the strong one!  Ahahahahahahahaha!  How's it feel now midget wiener dog brother?  Who's the big one now?  Ahahahahahahahaha!&quot;<br />
<br />
She kept this up for a couple minutes after bringing him next to the car and presenting him to Emma who laughed as well and held him up, uncomfortably by his little tail.  Upside down, he could see out into the park that Jack and Eric had been lucky enough to get away from Suzy and Heather, having found refuge in a 20 foot long culvert pipe under a gravel path.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any idea all the things I could've done to you, Jeff?&quot;  Emma cooed out the car window.  &quot;I guess you do, don't you, if this was your machine&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait till you see your friend Tony!&quot; his sister giggled.  &quot;He's not small like you but it's even worse for him!  He . . &quot; she couldn't finish through her own laughter.  At last she steadied a bit and Emma rocked back in her seat smiling delightedly at something letting go of his tail.  It was only his sister holding him now as Suzy and Heather returned to the car and they were paying no attention to him.  He tried to wriggle free but got nowhere.  Another idea occurred to him and he held one tiny back leg out.  <br />
<br />
His sister reacted in disgust at the little stream of dachsund piss suddenly running down his leg and dropped him.  Jeff sprinted as fast as he could for the culvert where Jack and Eric were cornered.  Only when he was almost there did his sister collect herself and chase angrily after him.  Even with the late start, she almost caught him.  She crouched at one end of the pipe and first called him names then switched to making fun of their diminutive size.  Finally, she tired of it and went back to the car.  Dachsunds Jeff, Jack and Eric then left the pipe as Emma shouted down to them.<br />
&quot;Don't worry about going to school Tuesday, unless you can attend like that, boys, because that's how you're going to stay!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the car screeched away the laughter of four girls still audible until the car turned down the road and went out of sight.  <br />
<br />
The three dachsunds hadn't even had time to react when, out of the gathering dusk, they heard oddly timed heavy steps and saw a sight not expected for a public park in a city suburb, a jackass.  The gargantuan animal slowly ambled over to them and stopped there with a forlorn expression.  Branded into one side of its massive rump was the name &quot;TONY&quot;.</p>
