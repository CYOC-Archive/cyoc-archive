<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alvin looked over the collection of various battered items on display, not really looking for anything in particular, just seeign if there was anything that caught his eye. And it didn't take long for your lamp to do just that. The bright finish and the inset gems which the owner foolishy thought was fake were like a magnet to the scrawny collge student. He picked it up and look it over. &quot;Wow, this is so sweet! This looks just like a lamp of endless daylight! And only fifteen bucks too! I gotta get it!&quot;<br />
<br />
'A lamp of... is this kid stupid? This is so totally a genie lamp!' You think to yourself as he walks to the register and pays for your home. 'And when I get my hands on that appraiser I am gonna turn him into a tarnished brass candlestick. Fifteen bucks...'<br />
<br />
You grumble the entire time you are set into the basket of a bike with a do-it-yourself moped moter on it, taken several miles to a college dorm and placed on a shelf. All without even the slightest of rub. You finally get so frustated you plop onto your large pillow of a bed and drift off into a dreamless sleep.<br />
<br />
Loud voices awaken you several hours later as a bunch of young men file into the room, each being very noisy and not caring about who they woke up at the obvious late hour. You groaned and looked at the tv, willing it to show what was going on outside the lamp. Six college guys, including Alvin were setting up a table below you, each with several books and bags/boxes of dice. You focus the view to look at one of the books, seeing the copyrighted logo for dungeons and dragons. 'Crap, D&amp;D geeks. They know at least a little about genies and wish twisting. Well, maybe I can get them all to make wishes, or maybe wish me free. Six for the price of one isn't bad. Now, how to get them to give me a rub?'<br />
<br />
The inuendo is not lost on you, especialy since you realise that you haven't had any since a couple days before you got stuck with this gig. Yet it feels like you haven't in weeks. You spot a monster manual and get an idea, manifesting a manual for genies. You read through a few sections untill you come to what you were looking for.<br />
<br />
&quot;While unable to procreate unless unrestrained by a magical 'prison' or if their current master wishes to lay with them, the genie posses an extremely high libido. Being decended from a race of demons may contribute to this fact, but regardless of its origin a typical genie will find themselves craving sexual satisfaction daily if not more. This is why some genies act as they do when released by their masters. Attempting to lure them into a wish that is enjoyable by both, if not only the genie, to release the pent up lust that may accumulate over days, weeks, months and even years.&quot;<br />
<br />
You groan and look back at the screen, several cans of soda already opened and a few drained. You glance over in the mirror and look at your muscular body with its dark brown skin, that could almost be mistaken for a purple. It is hard to not be attracted to yourself, as already the need for sex is greater then you know. While the guys in the room outside your lamp argue about games and things that you don't really care about you change the channel to some porn and try to manifest something below your sash. Even going so far as to remove it but to no effect. Where your crotch would start you fade into a wipsy smoke. Suddenly a violent motion jerks you out of your trance and you feel the lamp being rubbed. You vaporise and rush out of the lamp to materialise in front of the gamers.<br />
<br />
They stare at you with mouths hanging open and you realise you're not wearing anything. At first you making a move to cover yourself then realise you've nothing to cover. So you make the movement into a grand flourish and bow before the guy holding your lamp. It's a somewhat lumpy white kid who looks to be about 19. His short brown hair messy and glasses over his deep brown eyes. He turns to the others and laughs. &quot;Hah, in your face Alvin, I told you it was a genies lamp!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alvin puts his hands up in defeat and they all seem to snap out of it. You're almost disapointed the shock wore off so quickly so you quickly go into your shpeal of the three wishes to the one who rubbed the lamp. He looks over at his friends and sits down. &quot;Well, we know he's gonna find some loophole in my wishes, so we gotta try and make them as flawless as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at them, all but two of them are looking as if this is an everyday occurance. The two who aren't, a someone good looking guy around the age of 21 with semi-long brown hair that grew up instead of down, held up by it's own thickness and a taller guy of the same age with styled blonde hair and gentle blue eyes, were looking at the others as if they had lost their minds. The Brown hair, who had about three inches of beard on his chin only, suddenly stood up. &quot;Guys! There is a purple eyed naked bald guy who's half made of smoke and is the color of an eggplant floating there! How are you not freaking out?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy Dan, it's not like we haven't been preparing for something like this. You've been gaming longer then we have, chill out!&quot; A dark skinned guy who looked 20 and was in decent shape (not in any way muscular but in no way fat) eased back and opened a can of mountain dew. &quot;Sides, shouldn't you be thrilled there's a naked guy in front of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because I'm gay doesn't mean I'm not freaked out!&quot; Dan sat back down in his seat and glared at the others, now talking about how genies would intrepret certain words. Even before you had always been a little curious what it would be like to have sex with another male, and now that you were in libido-overdrive mode, the idea seemed like something you might wanna try. And soon!<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay so genie, I gotta question, how does this work. Do we all get three wishes, three divided among the six of us or does only Rick get wishes? And if so, when he's done will the lamp stick around so we can rub it and get some wishes of our own?&quot; Alvin turned his chair towards you, looking up at you as you float over the table reading their character sheets.<br />
<br />
You lean back, resting on your own smoke tail which expands into a big pillow shape. Smiling, you shrug and manifest a nail file. &quot;Well, since I don't really enjoy the whole summoning thing, and I'm going for quanity of wishes, I'll give you all three. Without the need of each rubbing the lamp.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well thats good. But if we wanted too we could hold off on our wishes right? Untill we thought them through a little more?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes I suppose. But I'd rather stay out, it's so stuffy in there and the company is much better out here.&quot; You blatently look at Dan, who raised an eyebrow but obviously understands, the smallest hint of a smile playing about his lips. He looked over at his blonde friend who was still quite lost in all this. A quick peak into his mind found he had only just started playing this game a week ago.<br />
<br />
You begin picking through the minds of the others, not able to get more then surface thoughts and blatant desires, but enough to learn a bit about them. Learning what you need to get what you want out of them. You pretend to be looking over their character sheets, noticing most of them are only half filled in, letting them watch you as you study them. after a few minutes Rick speaks up, directly addressing you.</p>
