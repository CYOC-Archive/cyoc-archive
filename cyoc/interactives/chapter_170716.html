<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hey now, I’ve got the towels!&quot; Greg called out as he walked towards the pool.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
He got out from the small awning, missing the slight flash of the camera by a millisecond, and placed the towels on the edge of the suddenly much calmer pool. He stretched his back off to show off his figure before sliding back into the water. He didn&#39;t need to show off his muscles, obviously, but he couldn&#39;t help himself with his beautiful wife Becky nearby.<br />
<br />
Becky watched her hunk of a husband slide into the pool with glee. His toned abs, his sharp jaw, his chest hair, his bulge in his swim trunks... everything about him drove Becky crazy. Likewise, Greg gazed it his amazing wife. She had killer hips, DD breasts, gorgeous curly red hair, and an ass that drove him crazy when he pounded her from behind.<br />
<br />
Greg reached out his arm and pulled the much shorter Becky in closer, who giggled at his husband holding her tightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, thank&#39;s for getting those!&quot; A voice called out from the other end of the pool. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we had forgotten.&quot; He laughed, quickly picking up on to dry of Elsa the Rottweiler who was panting on the side.<br />
<br />
Greg turned his head to spot Tyler bending over to clean up his dog. He didn&#39;t say it out loud, but Greg could TOTALLY believe that Tyler could forget towels when going in the pool. Tyler was about 6 years younger than the rest of them, with bright blonde hair, killer abs which rivaled Greg&#39;s and a decent sense of humor.<br />
<br />
Becky always joked with Olivia and Greg that Tyler was basically a trophy husband due to his ditzy attitude, younger age and lacking monetary background. Of course, Olivia always scoffed at the notion, but she never outright denied it. Olivia, of course, was currently watching from the second floor, her eyes fixed on Tyler&#39;s tight ass. She was unaware she ever had a different husband, who was no longer living in the same state as reality had changed so the two had never met, and Tyler was Olivia&#39;s love.<br />
<br />
While Tyler moved on to drying his hair, Becky moved from Greg&#39;s grasp, letting her tits float slightly above the water. She crossed her arms against the edge and stared at Tyler seriously.<br />
&quot;So, Ty, you and Olivia ever thinking about having kids?&quot; She asked inquisitively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I um, I don&#39;t know... we talked a bit.&quot; He stuttered, looking away from Becky slightly.<br />
<br />
Becky chuckled, while Greg tried not to laugh. He knew Tyler did like Olivia, but obviously he was still spooked about the idea of having kids. <br />
&quot;Oh lay off him hon, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll have some soon.&quot; Greg teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of kids, ours are probably driving Kylie crazy. How about we receive the poor teen and get back home soon?&quot; Becky asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright alright.&quot; Greg laughed, giving Becky a quick kiss.<br />
<br />
Tyler, relieved the conversation shifted, just dried his body and quickly walked off. Upstairs, Olivia had wondered why they all seemed to scatter, so she walked downstairs to check. As Becky walked inside with Elsa, Olivia had just come down the stairs with the camera still in her hand.<br />
&quot;Oh no, are you leaving?&quot; Olivia asked saddened her bestie was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry Liv, it&#39;s just we were all out before too, and I don&#39;t want to leave the babysitter there too long.&quot; She apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;No no it&#39;s my mistake.&quot; Olivia sighed. &quot;I just got so wrapped up in using this old thing.&quot; She replied, gesturing to the camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! I haven&#39;t seen a camera like that in ages.&quot; Becky gasped, tying her curly wet mop of a haircut into a messy bun. She then leaned over and took it from Olivia to examine. &quot;Wow, it looks brand new!&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s just unused.&quot; Olivia chuckled. &quot;I found it upstairs, buried under the bed in the guest room. I think someone in my family must&#39;ve bought it years ago and just forgot it. Then, poof, it must&#39;ve mixed in with my stuff at some point.&quot; She theorized, unaware that her pet dog ha once used that room when she was human.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it really prints picture, like back in the day?&quot; Becky asked, holding it tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rebecca, you can have it if you like.&quot; Olivia chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Oh, Liv, I could never-&quot; She began before being interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rebecca, you have to little ones, I just have a 2 year old Rottweiler and a hunky husband. They&#39;re nice, but neither are fans of having their photo taken.&quot; Olivia laughed.<br />
<br />
Becky smiled, gave a quiet &quot;awwww&quot; before hugging her friend. She lifted her leg up and squeed. &quot;Thanks Liv! I promise, if you ever need it just let me know and I&#39;ll give it right back ASAP.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg and Tyler soon walked back inside, and gave one another a strange glance at why their wives were hugging with a camera.<br />
&quot;Uh, you two, like, alright?&quot; Tyler asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes hon we&#39;re fine.&quot; Olivia chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on baby, let&#39;s get home!&quot; Rebecca giggled, before grabbing Greg&#39;s massive hand. Greg, although much stronger, just laughed and let his wife pull him along. He knew from her face that she had something in mind. The two walked out the front door, waving back at the two briefly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Tyler.&quot; Olivia said, staring at her husband. She paused, pulled down his swim trunks, and in one motion grabbed his massive cock tightly, causing him to tense up while his member grew. &quot;What did I hear out there about kids?&quot; She asked seductively with a whisper as her nipples grew hard and her pussy got wetter.<br />
<br />
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Kylie was a typical 15 year old girl, and she was having a slightly hard time. She was watching over two kids, 5 year old Jacob and 2 year old Henry, who were both currently laughing and yelling at the T.V. She began to wonder if her price was worth it when she thankfully heard the door begin to open.<br />
<br />
To her relief it was Mr and Mrs Baker, coming home from there time with some family friends. Kylie thought Mrs. Baker was a cute older woman, and that her hair was totes adorable, but she REALLY liked Mr. Baker. She would never tell a soul, but she definitely had a bit of a crush on him. He was pretty hot for an old guy.<br />
&quot;Hi Mr. and Mrs. Baker!&quot; Kylie called out. &quot;You&#39;re back early!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! We thought we&#39;d relieve you, so at ease solider.&quot; Greg joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy Daddy!&quot; Jacob yelled as he ran into his mother&#39;s arms. &quot;Look, Mith Kylie taught me how to make a brathlet.&quot; He said proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, what a nice bracelet Jacob, good job!&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
She then waved at the two year old who had stood up on the couch who waved back at her.<br />
&quot;Oh, that reminds me, before you go, can I ask you something Kylie?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, sure Mrs. Baker.&quot; She replied, a little worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you mind taking a photo or two for us? It would mean a lot.&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Kylie was relieved it wasn&#39;t something serious and chuckled with a sigh. &quot;Sure, who you want me to take a picture of?&quot; She asked.</p>
