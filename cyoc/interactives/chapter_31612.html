<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The itching was driving Dace mad, he stood and began to undo his shirt, pulling his weapon harness from him as he did, as soon as his skin was free he ran hid over his well muscled torso, scratching and itching at the thick hairs pushing out of his already hairy chest. <br />
“Shit” he said in his rough voice. He felt wrong all over not just the itch, all his muscles seemed weak and his bones hurt.<br />
“It seems we have been infected” Brown said. Dace went round the desk to find the big man already naked and sat down on the floor leaning back against the wall his face calm even though Dace could see his muscles twitching, growing, the thick fur overtaking Browns already dense body hair. Brown was massively erect and throbbing, and it must have been a huge act of willpower to keep his palms where flat on the floor Dace guessed.<br />
“Yes. I guess Blocker took advantage of our situation” Dace said, his voice cracking as his jaw began to change. <br />
“I think it will be hard to resist any impulses that come next sir” Brown said even as his massive organ began to dribble precum “but please know I respect you as a Commander” Brown spat out a tooth “interesting” he said and closed his eyes. A shudder went through him and Dace watched as the man literally expanded everywhere; chest, arms, legs, feet- everything about Brown- already a massive man seems to grow even as the huge frame was covered in fur. Dace suddenly became aware of his own throbbing organ as he blew a load in his briefs. He shuddered in climax and then the itching returned in spades- he pulled at his belt with his changing hands ripping the belt out and pulling the material away with his new claws, his trousers pooled round his expanding feet and he fell over as his muscles suddenly grew tossing him off balance. <br />
<br />
Dace pulled himself into a sitting position and tried to reach for his booted feet, just as a hand grabbed one of his already splitting combats boots and simply ripped it from his left foot. Dace looked into the now black eyes of Blankan, the young man grabbed the other boot and tossed it away letting Dace’s black clawed feet breathe. Blankan ran his much longer tongue over the muzzle he was slowly growing; he crawled forward towards Dace his uniform shredded revealing a growing body covered in fur. Dace tired to say something but the lust in Blankans eyes was undeniable and he was feeling it, smelling it, and wanting it too. His cock stood up from his briefs, 10 inches or more and massively thicker than he remembered. He growled in anticipation as Blankan leaned over the tip and then sank his mouth down the shaft length. Dace leaned back and growled approval. <br />
<br />
Blankan sucked down on the boss’ thick, growing cock, but he needed more. He pulled himself to his changing feet, aware of how much bigger he was, how small Human things seemed suddenly. He never imaged power like his in his body, he raised both his arms and crunched down into the ‘most muscular’ pose he had seen the bodybuilders do- he felt the strength in him, even though he knew he was not done growing yet. Looking down Dace was watching him, both semi-clawed hands on his still growing cock, Blankan knew what he wanted and lowered himself down, pushing his legs apart so Dace could not miss as he sank down onto the bearmans pole. Both of them roared in pleasure as Dace pushed himself in. Blankans own cock exploded over Dace’s chest with the last of his Human sperm. Dace leaned forward and began to kiss Blankan’s muzzle pumping his legs and ass up and down as he did. Blankan returned the kiss as they got a good fucking rhythm going. <br />
<br />
Brown leaned back and tried to mediate, despite his growing horniness; despite the smell of bears fucking he wanted to remain calm. He wanted to master his new body. Brown could feel himself getting bigger, spreading across the wall and floor. He felt his muzzle grow out, and his Human teeth fall away as new Bear-Human hybrids grew in. His black claws had replaced his finger and toenails, his ears moved to the top of his changed head; and his cock throbbed just below his collarbone. He knew it had changed shape slightly as well as growing gigantic, he knew he would have to ejaculate eventually but for now he kept his calm and mediated.<br />
<br />
Hawkins moaned as hands lifted him upright... he was not awake, he felt big, bloated, heavy. He hands holding him where lowering him and something slipped against his lips, without worry he opened them and something stiff slipped inside, Hawkins gagged a little on the size but the shaft pulled away and he growled, he wanted it back again, it tasted so nice on his long tongue, it was pushed back as he felt something pressing against his behind, but he was too asleep, too floppy to stop whatever it was getting inside him. The shaft behind him pressed forward as the one in his mouth withdraw and then vice versa. Hawkins rolled his eyes in pleasure as he was taken on both ends. Suddenly something wet was licking his own throbbing shaft and then engulfing it. A shudder went through him as his last Human orgasm exploded from him snapping him awake. He had time to register a huge furred form fucking his face just as the man’s cock exploded into his mouth, he tried to spit but the smell and the sensation from his ass and cock was too much and instead he gulped down the bearmans load, his own cock exploding again as the one on his ass blew his load deep within his guts. <br />
<br />
Dace and Blankan rode each other as the final changes overtook them both. They where huffing in pleasure as their frames filled out, becoming massive Kodiak hybrids; their muzzles stayed locked together as second and third orgasms washed over them, the fur of their torsos covered in Blankans thick cum. Slowly their senses began to return and they broke their lip lock.<br />
“Oh.... god that was intense....” Blankan rumbled in a deep bass that was nothing like his former voice. He leaned back, though making no move to get off Dace’s still hard cock. <br />
“Damm look at the mess” he laughed. Dace looked up at him and began to laugh too. Roars came from the other side of the security console and they knew the others were changed too. Dace looked over to his friend Brown, who was still sat alone.<br />
“Look” he said, surprised at his low voice. Blankan looked over and his cock jumped back into life<br />
“Fuck” he said then added “we better help him out” Dace agreed and they slipped apart.<br />
<br />
Brown was still sitting concentrating. He had closed out the outside world instead concentrating on his inner feelings, specifically his cock. He was directing all his willpower, all his chi into himself, he didn’t know what the effect of becoming infected was, but he was not going to lose his mind, and become an animal, and since the final part of the change seemed to involve him cumming he was not going to cum. A hand on his shoulder shocked him<br />
“Brown?” he voice said, much deeper but still familiar as Dace “Brown? Henry?” Brown opened his eyes to see the huge, hulking form of a bearman- Kodiak hybrid- his mind told him. Behind Dace he could see the younger, slighter, lighter brown fur coloured bearman, who’s silly big fanged grin marked him as Blankan. He could smell more Bears further away.<br />
“Henry, you need to let it go- you have to cum” Brown shook his head slightly and Dace seemed to read his mind<br />
“It’s all right, we are still ourselves, even if we are much changed” he rumbled “if you don’t cum you are going to hurt yourself, you can’t keep it in here forever” Dace brushed a hand against Browns towering cock and Brown jumped at the sensitivity and he focused on his throbbing organ suddenly aware the mushroom shaped head was at eye level and thicker than his old Human bicep had been.<br />
“I...” he tried to say, but Blankan had thrown his huge body down and was licking the base of his shaft. He twitched and a little pre came from his tip<br />
“Let it go Henry. Let it go” Brown closed his eyes against the pleasure he was feeling from Blankans hands; then there were two more hands on him as Dace began to lick his organ and caress his softball sized sack. He shuddered again. He smelt more Bears where coming and then he felt more hands on his humongous shaft. Someone else found his nipples and where kissing and nipping them with his sharp teeth; a third was kissing him and he could not resist kissing back. They were all growling in pleasure and a roar erupted as someone blow a load over Brown coating his chest and shaft in hot cum which quickly got rubbed in. As if discovering a new toy they were all then whacking off and blowing loads over Brown each time the wet splashes hit him his control grew less and his giant phallus began to dribble more and more. <br />
<br />
Someone forced a hand between his thighs and under him teasing his crack and the sensitive space under his balls. Another was giving him head expertly. More cum landed on him and finally he couldn’t take it he began to thrash about and roar as his massive organ twitched and throbbed. There where hands and mouths all over him as he finally let the bear in and cum erupted from him even as he felt the power of his new form, the sheer size and scale of what he had become. Bear cum flowed from him and he heard Blankan shout<br />
“It’s like a fucking shower!” the others all laughed as Brown continued to shower cum on them; their hands and lips never leaving him despite the mess. It took a good ten minutes to empty Brown’s balls. He slowly calmed down and looking at his cum splattered bear brothers he could not help but laugh, at their massive frames covered in strips of slivery white, their fur matted and messy. Not that he was in any better shape his huge body as plastered from head to toe in cum and sweat.<br />
“You know what I need” he said his voice deeper than any of the others “a shower. A warm shower and a fucking big hairdryer to stand under afterwards” there was laughter all round.<br />
“Actually, why not?” said Blankan “as far as I know we are the only ones here apart from Dr. Summers team. This place has great facilities, why don’t we use them?”<br />
“Well there are people out there with guns hunting for animorphs like us” Hawkins said<br />
“And?” Dace said quickly “we are expected to co-ordinate them there is no reason we can’t do that and keep them away from here. Summers is working on a cure.....” he paused and looked down at his immense body “...... or maybe a stabilization” he said hoping the others missed his hesitation “either way we are in a good position. There is no need for us to risk the wilds just yet and when we do we’ll have all the information on our side. We are not animals despite the change in our form, if there is no need to go foraging and playing ranger then I don’t see why we should. Plus if nothing else we have the choppers”<br />
“No way!” Blankan cried “they are big birds, but all of us? Come on- I must weight close to 1500lbs now and I’m probably the smallest here” there were some nods of agreement<br />
“We can worry about that later” Brown said “for now can we get cleaned up?” There where mummers of agreement and people stood up from the floor with the odd ‘humf’ as sticky fur came away from the tiles. <br />
“Why don’t we use the executive washrooms?” one of the former guards said. <br />
“What’s your name?” Dace asked since there was no convenient name tags anymore.<br />
“I’m Brin Hendersson” the bearman answered sticking out a pawhand. Dace shook it noting that Brin was of a light, almost blonde fur and oldest of the three guards. Dace looked at the other two- “and you?“ he said<br />
“I’m Hanz Talon” the youngest of the guards said automatically. He was rubbing his hands over his belly like he still did not believe what had happened. His fur was a very dark chocolate brown Dace noted.<br />
“I was Anastazy Goraidh but most called me Gora” the last man said sticking out a huge hand which Dace shook. Gora was a big man before and had become a huge bear- nearly 11’ tall he was the biggest here second only to the titan that was Brown who had climbed to his paws only to have to duck under the 12’ ceilings. Not that any of them where going to fit inside normal Human sized buildings easily, but next to these two Dace felt small and he was nearly 9ft himself!<br />
“Hey, where’s Rothman?” Blankan said. <br />
“I tossed him a mask before passing out” Dace said “either Mac got him or the gas did. We better check he might become a liability.” The Bearmen nodded and fanned out. Both Gora and Brown took the opportunity to stretch in the 25’ tall Lobby area. The group checked the various rooms and corridors off the lobby. <br />
“Here!” Brown shouted, looking into a conference room, the others came round as Brown ducked into the room.</p>
