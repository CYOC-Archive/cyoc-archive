<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;m looking real forward to continue this storyline, and I&#39;m happy to see the positive response that the first part has received so far! <br/>
By the way, props to anyone who gets the reference as to where the Prince&#39;s name comes from. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Almost immediately as the fox began the bidding, a voice from the back of the crowd calmly says “1000 Gold Pieces”. Many people in the crowd are shocked by such a large amount being thrown so early and turn around to see who placed such an outrageous bet, only to step out of the way and create a large path down the middle, allowing you to see who placed the bet. <br />
<br />
Standing at the end of the newly created path was an anthropomorphic wolf. He had a lush, grey coat of fur that covered most of his body, save for his chest, neck, lower face, and inner thighs, which were white. Around his waist was a red loincloth that covered his genitalia. From the way the people in the crowd reacted to his presence, you could tell that he was a powerful person in the city. Based on his voice, you assume that he’s about your age. <br />
<br />
“P-Prince Ralis!” the auctioneer fox said, trying his best not to stumble on his words. “This is an unexpected surprise! What brings you here, my liege?” <br />
<br />
“I was told that this was where to go if I wanted to buy a personal slave,” the prince responded plainly, approaching the stage. “This one seems like he’ll be a fun toy, so I will gladly take him off your hands. Of course, I am a fair player, so if anyone here would like to outbid me, please go ahead.” The crowd remained silent. “Very well then. I believe that this one is mine.” The prince walked onto the stage and handed the fox a large sack of coins before taking your leash from the lion and leading you off the stage. <br />
<br />
“A pleasure doing business with you, my liege!” the fox called cheerfully as you and the prince left the building. <br />
<br />
As soon as you leave the auction house, you are given your first look at the world you have been taken to. The city had a medieval look to it, with the buildings all appearing as if they were made centuries ago. You could see various shops along the street, such as a blacksmith and a clinic. On the other side of the city, you could see a large stone castle that towered over everything else. You didn’t have to be a psychic to know that was where you were headed.<br />
<br />
After a relatively short walk, you and the prince arrive at the castle. The prince called out to the guards on the ramparts to open the gates for you and the prince to enter, which they do immediately. The prince then quickly guides you through the castle’s front courtyard and into the main hall, a large, luxurious room with an elegant red carpet and beautifully designed banners hanging from the walls. At the end of the room is a large and rather comfortable looking throne, which you presume belongs to the prince. Your assumption is proved to be correct as the prince leads you to the end of the room and sits down in the throne with a sigh of relief. <br />
<br />
“Ahh, it feels so nice to be back home,” Prince Ralis says before turning his attention to you. “Now, allow me to formally introduce myself. I am Ralis, the Lone Wolf Prince, and soon to be king, of the Hidden City of Pedda, but you will not address me as such. As my slave, you are required to address me as ‘Master’ and do whatever I tell you to do. Failure to do so will result in punishment. Do you understand?” <br />
<br />
You begrudgingly nod your head, avoiding eye contact with the prince. Prince Ralis doesn’t seem to accept this response. <br />
<br />
“Look me in the eyes,” he says. You reluctantly obey out of fear of what he might do to you if you don’t. “Do you understand?” <br />
<br />
“Y-Yes…” you say quietly. <br />
<br />
“‘Yes’ what?” <br />
<br />
“Yes, master…” <br />
<br />
The prince smirks. “Good,” he says. “Now get on your knees.” You obey the prince’s orders. Once you are on your knees, the prince begins to undo his loincloth, taking it off and revealing his rather large canine cock, standing at attention. <br />
<br />
“Suck it.”<br />
<br />
Your eyes widen in horror as you realize what he wants you to do. You try to move away from the prince, but he yanks your leash and forces you closer to his crotch than you already were. <br />
<br />
“I said, suck it!” <br />
<br />
Realizing that you have no other choice, you hesitantly grab the prince’s member in your left hand and bring your lips closer to the tip. Then, you begin to take the cock into your mouth. Almost immediately, the foreign taste overwhelms your tastebuds, causing you to retch in disgust. As you are about to take the cock out of your mouth, you feel Ralis place one of his furry, clawed hands on the back of your head, keeping you there. Tears begin to stream down your cheeks are you are forced against your will to continue sucking the canine’s cock. <br />
<br />
“That’s a good pup,” Ralis says, petting your head as you suck his cock. “Keep that up and you’ll get your treat in no time.” <br />
<br />
With no other options, you continue to suck the young prince’s cock, which earns the occasional grunt of satisfaction from Ralis. Then, after sucking his cock for what felt like an eternity, the prince lets out a loud snarl of satisfaction and a large load of cum bursts from the tip. Immediately you try to get Ralis’ cock out of your mouth so you can spit out his cum, but the prince doesn’t move his hand from your head, keeping you there. You quickly realize that the only way he’ll move his hand is if you swallow his load. Begrudgingly, you swallow every last drop of wolf semen that was in your mouth, feeling disgusted for having done such a thing. <br />
<br />
Satisfied that you swallowed his cum, Prince Ralis moves his hand from your head, finally allowing you to take his cock out of your mouth. Immediately you begin gagging, trying to get the awful taste of wolf cum out of your mouth. You are so preoccupied with the taste in your mouth that you fail to notice your ears growing longer and pointed, moving to the top of your head as your hair turned a snowy white color. It is only when you feel a pressure at the base of your spine that you turn your head just in time to watch a large bushy tail sprout from your rear. You then watch as a fair amount of your body fat wastes away before your eyes, leaving you with a body that resembled that of a professional swimmer. All the while, Prince Ralis watches your transformation with a smirk on his face. <br />
<br />
When your changes stop, you turn to the prince with a panicked look on your face. “Wh-what the hell did you do to me?!” you cry. <br />
<br />
The prince chuckles at your reaction. “That’s no way to talk to your master, especially after I’ve given you such a wonderful gift,” he says. “But I’ll let it slide this time.” <br />
<br />
“Gift?!” you say. “Nothing about this…” You quickly gesture at your changed body. “...is a gift!” <br />
<br />
“Oh, but that’s where you’re wrong pup,” Ralis retorts. “You see, we beastfolk have a powerful and very potent seed. If it were to enter a human’s body, either anally or orally, it would quickly begin to change their bodies to match the beast that the seed originated from. The more of my seed you ingest, the more you’ll change until you’re a wolf like me. Not only that, but humans who ingest beastfolk seed orally will find themselves wanting more and more. All it takes is a single load for the addiction to set in.” <br />
<br />
You feel your heart sink as you realize that there is no way out of this. The prince has already forced you to swallow his load, which effectively sealed your fate as his sex slave. Even now, the lingering taste of the wolf cum has become slightly more bearable than it was originally. You hang your head low in defeat, much to Prince Ralis’ delight. <br />
<br />
“Good pup,” he says as you sit down next to his throne. As he strokes your head with his free hand, you try your best to hold back tears.</p>
