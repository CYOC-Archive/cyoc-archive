<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Amy continued onward down the west wing she found one door at the end of it and having no other options she opened it. Looking inside the room all she saw was a bed, mirror and a closet. <br />
<br />
Out of curiosity more than anything else she opened and saw nothing that could help them break free however something felt on top of her head as she did it. Reaching up to pull it off she quickly found out that the satin? Thing would not get off her head panicking she went over to the mirror and saw what it was: a maid headdress! Turning her head from one side to another she could not find anything that was keeping it stuck to her head nor a way to remove it.<br />
<br />
Quietly she gave up trying to remove the damn thing and went for the door however it slammed shut right in front of her! Now really panicking she screamed when she heard noises from what she had thought being an empty closet she now saw a pair of long black gloves coming crawling out from it!<br />
<br />
Crawling much faster than she anticipated she tried to kick them away but that only resulted in one of them latching itself around it and keeping it pinned in place. The other one proceeded to crawl up her leg and she screamed again this time louder than before and panicky tried to grab it and throw it away but all that did was that it managed to catch her arms. She quickly closed her hands so that the glove would not have an easy fight but the &quot;fingers&quot; of the glove slowly but surely undid her knuckle and began to crawl up her arm.<br />
<br />
She started to cry when her arm moved on her own and took the other glove around her leg and without much resistance put it on. The gloves then proceeded to take off her top. Fighting the movement of her arms as much as she could to at least slow them down a bit they slowly but surely moved her top off and away from her head and threw it so far away that she could not reach it.<br />
<br />
It did the same with her bra and even her pants and panties but since she was still in control of her lower body she was hell bent on keeping them on even if it meant &quot;her&quot; arms had managed to get them all the way down to her ankles. She yelped as she heard another rumbling sound from the closet and saw that a pair of white stockings was now crawling out from it.<br />
<br />
Having barely managed to fight of those gloves with arms fighting those stockings might as well be impossible but she did not want to give up so easily. As they crawled forward she planned on kicking them away just like she had tried to with the gloves but she had forgotten that her pants was down toward her ankles so she tripped and felt backwards on her back.<br />
<br />
She wanted to get up quickly but the gloves kept her arms upward so she could not get up in time before one stocking just like the gloves latched around her legs and keeping her pinned in place while the other one slowly but surely somehow undid her shoe lacing and pulled her shoes off her sock was of course no challenge for it.<br />
<br />
As her shoe and sock was now off it proceeded to pull her pants and panties of as well that took a bit of effort for it as she moved her legs around as much as she could but it was futile as everything was now taken off and it proceed to crawl up her left leg slowly but surely tightening and preventing her from moving it any further in the end.<br />
<br />
Then the other stocking released her pinned legs but now having lost control of her arms and one of her legs she kind of just gave up and watched as it crawled down and up her other leg slowly tightening as well. The gloves and stockings then made her rise herself up from the floor and move awkwardly toward the closet.<br />
<br />
When her arms moved inside they grabbed what felt like a pair of panties and slowly but surely they managed to put those on too next came a garter belt that crawled up by itself and latched on to her stockings just to add more insult to injury than was needed next came what looked like a oh no... she recognized it instantly for what it was: a corset! She tried to fight it again but the stockings kept her firmly in place and the gloves had complete control over her arms.<br />
<br />
They took the corset and put it slowly around her waist then it latched on by it&#39;s own effort and started to tighten itself she had almost ran out of breath when it stopped and she had to take really small breath from then on. Next came what looked like your typical anime maid dress cute and sexy and in the typical black and white with a huge bow on the back and a small skirt. They put it on her (not without difficulty though) and the bow tightened. Then they took out the shoes: a pair 4 inch heels not really wanting to fight the clothing anymore she just let&#39;s her stockings move her feet&#39;s into the shoes. Her left hand then grabbed a feather duster and hold tightly around it.<br />
<br />
She sighed with relief (as much as the corset allowed) when the door opened with a small *click* and she tried to take a step toward the door and felt that she could now once more move on her own she moved out of the room as quickly that the heels would allow her to warn the rest.</p>
