<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Emrys, take Callie with you to the former king&#39;s, my, bedroom,” the Queen continued to caress her hand against the femboy&#39;s cheek, languidly stroking his silken skin. “Don&#39;t hold destroying the tower against him, if you should hate anyone it was I who ordered it.” Even as Emrys&#39; gaze flicked away and him grimacing at the painfully fresh memories of the fire and his master trapped inside, the Court Witch continued to hold her surcoat tightly with the rest of his delicate frame pressing against her. He bit his trembling lip and shook his head as if to deny her guilt. Seeing this, she clutched his head gently and held it against her stomach. “Such a sweet and sexy minx you are. Now go apologize to Callie for laughing at him, the femboy has his pride as a dragon to consider. And I promise it won&#39;t be long before I join you after I have introduced myself to the kingdom.” <br />
<br />
Despite her words, Ceridwen kept holding Emrys and sharing her body&#39;s warmth with him until his skin felt flush and hot as he continued to breath in her scent. It felt as if he was holding onto an immovable mountain. “Ahhhhh~,” the sound of the low and desirous moan was muffled by the femboy pressing his mouth against the Queen. Embarrassed, he pulled himself away, knowing he could little to conceal the large erection poking through his lacy underwear except try to hide it with his hands. But Witch didn&#39;t let him hide his lidded expression as she ran finger along his jaw and keeping his eyes focused on the sexual thirst visible in her face. That feeling of being desired by such a powerful, amazonian woman played havoc with Emrys body and mind, especially his twitching sex.<br />
<br />
After a few more mortifying, electrifying, seconds, she let him go. <br />
<br />
Once the Queen had left the parapets it felt as he could breath again. His chest heaved with the effort, making him keenly aware of the leather straps around his swollen breasts and the negligee brushing up against his pointed nipples with each intake of breath.<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t have to apologize, witchling,” a quiet voice sounded to Emrys side. The pouting draconic femboy had blush of his own but the ridged draconic member stood proudly curved and erect in the air. He was doing his best to not let his surreptitious glances toward the Court Witch&#39;s crotch show. “Dragons are also magnanimous, you know.” The pouting intensified as he again thrust out his chest, however without the same dramatic excessiveness as last time. That look suited the femboy much better, Emrys thought as he closed the distance between them and took one of the scaled hands in his without exactly knowing why he did so. <br />
<br />
The dragon boy&#39;s clawed fingers were thin and slender, still they seemed large in the Court Witch&#39;s tiny and dainty hand. Comparing himself to the knights, Rhys, and Calegor, Emrys was on the smallest side, certainly enough to be noticed when he stood beside the already short and lithe draconic femboy. Yet Callie didn&#39;t resist as Emrys tugged at his hand to lead him away from the battlements and the embers of chaos and confusion that could heard on the winds. The young enchanter had no intention of taking them straight through the throne room, but instead went through a circuitous route used by the servants when they wanted to avoid the main hallways.<br />
<br />
Ceridwen would be holding court on the Lion&#39;s Throne, and there was no point in them interrupting her. She couldn&#39;t make any obvious moves on the prince unless she wanted a full-scale rebellion. At least, Emrys hoped that was the case.<br />
<br />
The side-door to the new Queen&#39;s chambers was as unassuming as ever, easily missed in the hallway lined with identical doors. Yet its grandeur revealed itself as they entered, stepping on a richly decorated carpet. The sheer opulence illuminated by the morning sun&#39;s rays streaming through the windows made Emrys uncomfortable; his room in the eastern tower had been spartan and even that had taken a while to get used to after he had been taken from the streets. Callie had no such issues, and the feminine dragon boy immediately claimed the immense canopy bed for himself. <br />
<br />
And with the Court Witch attached to the other end of Callie&#39;s hand, he tumbled down onto the bed with the dragon. Emrys straddled him. Their faces were inches from each other, their breath playing on each other&#39;s faces. Suddenly Emrys realized he had never noticed how pretty the blushing Callie was, even his more inhuman features like his slitted reptilian eyes and light pattern of red scales didn&#39;t detract from his soft cuteness. While at the other end Callie marveled at the witchling&#39;s girly and exotic face and body that he could&#39;ve had mistaken for belonging to a young and beautiful princess.<br />
<br />
Following a shuddering groan releasing his pent-up lusts, Emrys was the first to act as he kissed the monstrous femboy. Emrys tasted his soft and plush lips with his. Unlike with Rhys, Callie didn&#39;t pull back or resist, but eagerly returned the affection with an open and eager mouth as soon as he realized what was happening. Their hands were already exploring their slight and feminine frames, and Emrys could feel his sheer negligee tearing underneath Callie&#39;s sharp claws that somehow managed to scrape harmlessly across his naked and sensitive breast. <br />
<br />
Emrys pulled away with a labored breath. “Who taught you to kiss like that?” He said, voice and expression dreamy. But without waiting for the answer, he continued to kiss him. The femboy left trail of wet marks against Callie&#39;s scaled neck until he found one of his hard nipples. Emrys captured it between his teeth, tugging at it with the same gentleness as he had the dragon boy&#39;s hand earlier.<br />
<br />
“Ahh! You did, witchling! You&#39;d think I&#39;d willingly be in this human form.” Callie arched his back as he felt a jolt of electricity shooting through his heart hi ding behind his chest. His voice broke, rising several octaves in pitch, and he sounded far girlier than he had earlier as he continued to speak. “Hmph. And who told you you could stop anyway.” As one of the dragon&#39;s hand returned the Court Witch&#39;s lips where they belonged, his other wrapped around their sex. <br />
<br />
The two cocks rubbed against each other as the two femboys kissed while they sloppily swapped saliva with their tongues. Emrys began to slowly thrust his hips, ensuring neither sex slipped from his lover&#39;s grasp. The scaled ridges of his inhuman cock felt amazing as they brushed up against his engorged glans and shaft.  Callie must have felt the same as his muffled moans increased in frequency between breaths and kisses which Emrys then put stop to by returning and forcing their mouths together again. <br />
<br />
It was almost painful in how erect Emrys&#39; penis felt, like nothing else before, made worse by the pressure building at its base. The femboy shook his head. He wanted this to continue. To forget about Rhys and everything else. But, “I&#39;m gonna cum. Please, cum with me, Callie.” The dragon blushed, looking away, but Emrys didn&#39;t need to beg again as he felt their cocks bulge and thicken before releasing a stream of cum all over the feminine dragon boy&#39;s flat stomach and chest.<br />
<br />
It was far more and thicker than either could&#39;ve guessed and Emrys cock continued to twitch and send jets of cum to spill over Callie. Yet even as that subsided, neither his cock nor that of the dragon boy had flagged and remained erect. Emrys groaned as he reached down to confirm it, his delicate fingers teasing Callie&#39;s length. The dragon tried to squirm out from under him, and Emrys let him but keeping his grip around his sex as he leaned his body to the side. <br />
<br />
Their arms were crossed as they each worked the other&#39;s shaft, hips thrusting and quivering in the air with each cycle of their mutual masturbation. <br />
<br />
It felt so good that neither the quietly moaning Emrys or Callie stopped when they noticed Queen Ceridwen looming over them. The amazon was naked, wearing only her crown, her rippling muscles on full display. Her fingers were brushing over her glistening labia. Looking up at her drove home the difference between them, both in terms of size and the power they wielded.<br />
<br />
“The other femboys in the castle weren&#39;t half as easy to convince they should embrace this as you two were. Not the case with the Ambrian women.” Again she spoke without reproach at how easily they had surrendered to their lust, rather perhaps even with a hint of pride as moved toward them. With a light kick, she discarded the last leg of her garments. <br />
<br />
Somewhere Rhys was riding from the castle. Emrys knew he could be happy with that. Then he turned to meet Callie&#39;s gaze for a second before sneaking in another kiss while they waited for their Queen to decide what to do with them.</p>
