<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Norloc Village rarely had use for an infirmary, save the typical visit for children who were injured or sick. Even so, it had long been run by a young red-haired woman named Devolei; one of the few people in the village who knew of both magical healing and medicine. Children often spoke of how there wasn&#39;t a wound in the world she couldn&#39;t heal, broken bones and torn skin able to be patched up within seconds.<br />
<br />
That could not be said for Arhian, even as he laid upon a bed with a blanket draped across his shivering body. Various other beds lined the infirmary&#39;s interior, which was quite small and cramped given how small the population of Norloc was in comparison to towns west of the village; although that was not to say it was uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Amier struggled to stifle another sniffle, having lost track of how long he had been crying. He hadn&#39;t glanced at his reflection since the night before, yet he knew with how much his eyes stung they were a shade darker than both his pink hair and tunic. His nose stung constantly, growing drier with each sniffle; while his eyes were too dry to shed any more tears.<br />
<br />
Three years.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d waited patiently for <em>three years</em> to see his brother return, and now that he had… he was gone just a short while later. Lost to the world of dreams, never to awaken. The few hours that had transpired since then were a blur and a painful one at that. It all felt so unreal and lucid, as if he was in a dream or a nightmare. <br />
<br />
Yet, as he gazed upon the slumbering form of his older sibling, Amier knew it was no dream. It was anything but a dream. The bed he sat on across from Arhian and the working Devolei, the figure of his grandpapa next to him, the clothing hugging his form; they were grounded in reality. He just had yet to fully accept it.<br />
<br />
And how could he?<br />
<br />
He had no idea how to explain to grandpapa what had occurred all those hours ago, he still had yet to; although thankfully as Arhian had said, news of the Black Disease had not gone undetected by the entirety of the village. Or so Devolei had told them. <br />
<br />
Both Eihrons were thankful that Devolei had allowed them to stay at the infirmary with Arhian. Dawn had broken only an hour ago, which meant the three had been awake all night as she did her best to tend to Arhian. Yet, no matter how much she had tried, he refused to stir; although it was clear he was still alive with his steady breathing and pulse.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s… not much else I can really do, Fernius.&quot; Devolei whispered grandpapa&#39;s name solemnly with a shake of her head, retreating from Arhian&#39;s slumbering body. The vast amount of medical herbs splayed across the bedside table had gone unused, the sweat across her brow indicating she&#39;d been relying on her magic.&quot;I wish there was more I could do but… I haven&#39;t got much information about this disease aside from what a few of my colleagues in Dalint have told me… which is very little. Really, all I actually know is the name; Quietus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grandpapa grunted at her words, his worn gaze falling to his lap; his younger grandson mirroring his actions with a whimper. He had long sobered up, yet Amier could still smell traces of alcohol in his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Grandpapa choked, his own blue eyes staring emptily at the floor. &quot;There&#39;s… nothin&#39; more ya can do…?&quot;<br />
<br />
The tense silence that had filled the infirmary returned once more, this time even more overpowering: akin to an anvil slowly crushing one&#39;s head. Before it had been anticipation, hope that there&#39;d be a way to wake Arhian.<br />
<br />
&quot;I… I-I&#39;m sorry, Fernius.&quot; Devolei stammered, the sadness in her eyes and voice clear. &quot;If I&#39;d known more… I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...&quot; Grandpapa started, halting the girl&#39;s sentence. He sighed, before allowing his head to rise to meet her gray-blue eyes. &quot;It&#39;s alright, Devolei. I&#39;m sure ol&#39; Arhian will be okay. He&#39;s my grandson after all, and a knight too. An Eihron knight ain&#39;t one to give in to some fancy letter sickness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes.&quot; The red-haired girl stuttered with a nod, clearly thankful that grandpapa had not lashed out in grief nor anger as she had been expecting. &quot;Knowledge is… sparse on this disease, but I promise you as soon as I get word from my friends in Dalint I&#39;ll work to getting Arhian back to full health.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...How long will that be?&quot; Amier blurted out abruptly.<br />
<br />
Devolei and grandpapa&#39;s attention shifted to the younger boy, head low and bangs obscuring his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I… I know the information would have to reach Selheino City first before they&#39;d start sending messengers to neighboring towns.&quot; She mused, struggling to reassure the boy. &quot;O-Of course, we could send a messenger of our own in a few days so they can reach Selheino, get information, and then return to Norloc. But even then, that&#39;d probably take a week minimum. And beyond that, it could take months before actual information reaches Esbur Island.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...A week? <em>Months</em>?&quot; Amier rasped quietly, his body beginning to quiver once more. He couldn&#39;t deny how long that&#39;d take. With each word the physician said he found his breaths growing quicker, head lifting to glance at his sleeping brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it seems like a long time, Amier,&quot; Devolei whispered in an attempt to ease his worries. &quot;But… it&#39;s the reality of how these things work. I promise you I won&#39;t let Arhian get anywhere close to dying under my watch, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I-I&#39;ll go to Selheino.&quot; Amier stuttered, eyes leaving his sibling&#39;s bed to meet both grandpapa and the red-haired girl&#39;s somber gazes; who were appropriately stunned into silence at the abruptness of his words.<br />
<br />
&quot;You… what?&quot; Grandpapa&#39;s asked, voice just above a hoarse whisper.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I-If… if it&#39;ll make Arhian better, I&#39;ll go to Selheino and find a cure. I&#39;ll sail the entire Great Sea if I have to.&quot; Amier elaborated with a determined nod, gaze returning to his brother&#39;s relaxed face. Even in the depths of slumber, he had made no movement aside from breathing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot; Grandpapa spat, shattering the hollow silence that had followed his grandson&#39;s proposition. &quot;No way in hell are ya going out there. I&#39;ll hire one of them guardsmen to go to Selheino, we still got a farm to take care of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What?&quot; Amier asked, his gaze breaking from his sibling to snap to his elder. &quot;Isn&#39;t family more important than some stupid old farm?!&#39;<br />
<br />
The pink-clad boy rose from the bed, his yells shaky and voice cracking. Per usual, his voice had already exhausted itself from his consistent crying, each word from his mouth causing his throat to lurch in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Please</em>, grandpapa…&quot; Amier begged, fists clenched at his sides and eyes buried into his elder&#39;s own. &quot;I can&#39;t… tend to some <em>stupid</em> old sheep while Arhian sleeps to his <em>death</em> in this <em>stupid</em> infirmary!&quot;<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
Once again, he had run.<br />
<br />
The stale air of the infirmary and the silence that had plagued it had been left behind, yet the emotion and weight on his heart stayed. Even as the fresh breeze blew against his face, hair swaying gently along with it; it felt empty. Even as light bore down upon the world, the sun&#39;s illuminate gaze felt so distant and dull. <br />
<br />
Amier didn&#39;t know the last time he&#39;d ever felt like this. Even before Arhian had left to become a knight three years ago, not once had he ever felt so… sad. Or even when his parents died, although he was only a baby when they passed on. He&#39;d only ever heard of how they were from Arhian and grandpapa, how hopeful they were for him and his sibling.<br />
<br />
And now Arhian was going to drift away to his death. He was older now and understood what death meant, and losing his older brother would mean only grandpapa would be left.<br />
<br />
Adrift in thought, a shaky sigh slipped from Amier&#39;s lips; his eyes that had once been staring blankly into the green abyss that served as the ground, now focused beyond it and the deep blue void that mirrored his eyes.<br />
<br />
Even he didn&#39;t know why he had come here. The fabled edge of Norloc Village, a beach cliffside overlooking the field of gold and blue below; Aerinver&#39;s Locket.<br />
<br />
The pink-clad boy shook his head in resignation at the thought, crumpling to his knees before reclining on his rear near the edge of the cliffside. <br />
<br />
No, he knew exactly why he had come here.<br />
<br />
Whenever he&#39;d feel down, the sight of the sun setting over the horizon would always be a sight to stir awe within him; a simple way to ease his worries, which would be washed away by the sound of waves crashing against the foot of the cliffside.<br />
<br />
Yet, the sun was still so far up in the sky; the blue void above appearing to almost taunt him.<br />
<br />
After all, Arhian was just asleep, wasn&#39;t he? The sky and the sea, the grass beneath him; they felt the same as ever. Which meant everything else would be normal too. The sheep were probably still grazing back at the Eihron farmland, Sylev up to his mischief going to see if he was out shepherding.<br />
<br />
And...<br />
<br />
Amier wanted to scream, yell in fury, or maybe even fling himself down into the waves below as if hoping the past few hours were but a dream. A nightmare he&#39;d wake up from, something stupid his mind made up as if to make fun of how anxious and excited he&#39;d been to see his big brother after three whole years.<br />
<br />
His mind flashed to Arhian&#39;s sleeping body, the sight of the black letters fading across his face. Taunting him. Driving him mad with anger and regret.<br />
<br />
Amier shook his head once more, gazing aimlessly into the endless blue depths.<br />
<br />
Grandpapa&#39;s words and Devolei&#39;s silence at his insistence on heading to Selheino. They also drove him mad, yet he knew they meant well. They wanted to protect him. After all, he was just a boy in their eyes. A stupid boy, who just wanted to see his brother to full health.<br />
<br />
But… what if he went anyways…?<br />
<br />
&quot;Gah!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pink-haired boy shouted, barely managing to stifle it as he bit down on his lip. On his feet and stumbling away from the cliffside, Amier&#39;s left hand clawed at his right; a searing pain assaulting it without mercy. Fear overwhelmed him, thoughts of a stray poisonous spider that he hadn&#39;t noticed having dug its fangs into him while he&#39;d been lost in thought, it&#39;s venom already flowing through him.<br />
<br />
Hissing away the pain, Amier willed his hand to release its opposite after the pain had dulled; right hand rising to meet his hesitant gaze.<br />
<br />
To his relief, there was no blood or spider; although what was there was a bit more… confusing. Puzzling, for lack of a better term.<br />
<br />
At the back of his hand, sat an unusual black mark in the vague shape of what he could describe as a claw. It was a bit fancy, with various smaller lines making it up; alongside it taking up a good majority of his hand. He&#39;d never seen such a strange mark before… unless he had…?<br />
<br />
Amier felt his pulse quicken at the thought. The Black Disease, Quietus. Did he have it? Was it contagious after all? He <em>did</em> touch Arhian, although the black letters burned to the touch when his hand made contact.<br />
<br />
The window of tense silence that accompanied his panicked thoughts and quick breathing slowly filtered away, however. As he clenched and unclenched his fingers, the pink-haired boy noticed that… the black mark didn&#39;t spread up his arm or make him feel sleepy. Even when he&#39;d been up all night through the morning, he felt… oddly reinvigorated. Even more puzzling, the black coloration of the claw-shaped mark had appeared to fade, looking much more like a scar or birthmark than a tattoo.<br />
<br />
Eyes wide and brow furrowed, Amier&#39;s fingers danced across the faded mark hesitantly, earning no particular reaction. It was… pretty weird, he had to admit. Maybe he should go see Devolei about it…?<br />
<br />
As his gaze sat on the claw-shaped mark at the back of his right hand, he felt those thoughts drift away. He felt… utterly absorbed in the strange design, the crisscrossing lines up-close barely resembling a claw. It looked so similar, yet at the same time so much different than the black runes that had formed on Arhian&#39;s skin.<br />
<br />
And with that thought, Amier felt something stir within him. Prodding at the back of his mind. An ache in his soul, the mark upon his flesh beckoning him to fulfill his desires.<br />
<br />
Clenching his hand, the boy simply sighed.</p>
