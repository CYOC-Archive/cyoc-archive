Now, on with our story...}}<br />
<br />
Tachibana no Akane was being driven to work when her cellphone rang.<br />
This in and of itself was no surprise, considering that her &#39;private&#39; number was known to a privileged few.<br />
However, not recognizing the number displayed on the Caller ID, she was curious as to who it might be.<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; she said cautiously.<br />
&quot;Err... Hello. My name is Jacoby Albertson. I&#39;m the personal attorney of Jack Crawford,&quot; announced a male voice on the other end.<br />
Hearing the name of the werepanther that had been causing the Elders Council, Moon Lake, and weres in general so many problems of late instantly soured Akane&#39;s mood even worse than it already was.<br />
Yet this man was unknown to her, so she would at least hear him out.<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; she said politely.<br />
&quot;I have absolutely no idea what number this is or who you are. All I&#39;m doing is following my client&#39;s instructions. Mister Crawford said to call and give whoever answered a message on his behalf,&quot; explained Albertson.<br />
&quot;I see. And what is the message?&quot; asked Akane.<br />
<i>“Make this go away, or the cat will literally be out of the bag.”</i><br />
&quot;Make what go away?&quot; wondered Akane, although she had already been contacted and warned by fellow were–Agent Brook Reed of the FBI–as to current events in Seattle.<br />
Briefly, Albertson explained his client&#39;s arrest and being investigated by the Federal authorities as to his possible involvement in the attempted assassination of notorious mobster Fredrick &quot;The Shark&quot; Parker and the death of the Moon Lake deputy that occurred in the process.<br />
Akane was silent for a while after the lawyer finished speaking, but Albertson could swear at least once he heard a low growling sound, as if some angry animal was on the other end of the conversation and about to strike.<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Akane finally said, after managing to regain her composure. &quot;Can you relay a message to your client on my behalf?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. Please tell him, verbatim*, that steps are being taken to protect <i>everyone</i>, despite his interference and threats otherwise. We will do what we can, although his current troubles with the Federal authorities are all of his own creation, but his day of reckoning with us is only postponed, not canceled. Do you have that Mister Albertson?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the lawyer, for the message was delivered in a very stern tone of voice. <i>Whoever this lady is I&#39;m speaking to, I certainly don&#39;t want to face her in court, let alone a dark alley.</i><br />
&quot;Good. Have a nice day, and never call this number ever again,&quot; said Akane, before she hung up.<br />
<i>Oh, bugger. I&#39;ll have to get a new cellphone now,</i> she realized, letting out a heavy sigh.<br />
Then Akane gave her driver a change of destination as she started calling every member of the Elders&#39; Council she could get a hold of.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me,&quot; said Principal Ian Andrews.<br />
The man was sitting in his office at Moon Lake High School. When Benton Knight came in the front entrance and told the teacher on hall monitor duty that he needed to talk with Andrews (after dropping off his daughter and her friends/lovers for the school day), the teacher politely asked him to wait while the request was relayed.<br />
Although Andrews was watching the bus stop that morning, upon receiving the message, the Principal was willing to see such an important visitor once the morning bell rang heralding the first class of the day.<br />
Andrews was thankfully he didn&#39;t mind waiting, but what Benton Knight told him was absolutely unbelievable, even for weres.<br />
&quot;The proof of everything is right before you,&quot; replied Knight, pointing to the folder with the contents laid out across the Principal&#39;s desk. &quot;My investigator has the originals, but I assure you that everything is accurate and verified.&quot;<br />
&quot;The implications. All these years he&#39;s been teaching...&quot; realized the Principal.<br />
&quot;Personally, I can&#39;t blame Jeff Wilson for putting his college education on hold to answer his country&#39;s call to arms when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and brought America into the Second World War,**&quot; conceded Knight. &quot;Why the werepig never did more than KP*** duty throughout his military service is a question only he can answer. But it&#39;s clearly documented here that when the war was over and Wilson was honorably discharged, that the man came back to Moon Lake and began his teaching career <i>without</i> finishing college and getting his accreditation to be what was then called an Educational Instructor,&quot; he added, pointing to the college and military records Brock Stone, his private detective, uncovered.<br />
&quot;My God! Wilson&#39;s been teaching high school algebra here since 1946! Unaccredited! Without a diploma...&quot; said Principal Andrews, unable to imagine the consequences when this came to light. Yet, his course of action was clear. &quot;I&#39;ve got to notify the school board at once. Your man Stone can attest to all this?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;If necessary. His card,&quot; replied Knight, before handing it to Andrews.<br />
&quot;I trust you&#39;ll be discrete about all of this,&quot; the Principal requested.<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; promised Benton Knight, as he started to rise out of the guest chair. &quot;Unless there&#39;s anything else...?&quot;<br />
&quot;What? Oh, no. You&#39;ve given me enough to work with as it is,&quot; said Andrews, looking over the documents again.<br />
As Benton Knight left the Principal&#39;s office, he thought to himself, <i>First class is now,</i> while looking at his watch and seeing it was now well after 8 that morning. <i>The kids say Eric has him third period, which would be around ten-ish. But even if it&#39;s just temporary until he gets accredited, and I don&#39;t see how that will be possible for such an older were like him, hopefully Jeff Wilson will no longer be a menace to students here. That should make Frieda and her...</i><br />
There was a significant pause in his thoughts as Benton Knight finished the walk back to the Visitor&#39;s parking lot at the front of the school before he came to terms with the word he was about to use.<br />
<i>That should make Frieda and her</i> family <i>very happy. Hmm... something else I&#39;ll probably have to talk to Doctor Twist about at some point. Eric Anderson and Spencer Lawson may not be what Amanda and I originally envisioned, but as far as Frieda&#39;s concerned, they&#39;re part of her family as much as she&#39;s a part of ours. My little girl is growing up,</i> Benton realized, wondering where the time went as he got into his car and prepared to drive back to his estate to keep his end of Twist&#39;s house call.<br />
