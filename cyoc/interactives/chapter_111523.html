<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Conner resolved to stay silent for now.  The guy wasn&#39;t going to put him on now, was he?  He needed fresh underwear for the morning, and if Conner played his cards right, he would change back in the early morning, and sneak out before commando guy even woke up.<br />
<br />
Kevin handed the strange kid what he thought was Conner&#39;s spare underwear.  Conner felt cold, grimy hand close around him.  He smelt of garlic.  Who was this guy?  The guy unceremoniously crammed the underwear into his front pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, kid. Where can Conner get his underwear back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No givebacks,&quot; answered the EMO kid as he strolled down the corridor, &quot;But the name is Malcolm, and I&#39;m in room 409 North Tower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that&#39;s the next building over? Why a-never mind,&quot; sighed Kevin.  He closed the door and turned toward Dylan, &quot;Some guys are so ungrateful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Further down the corridor, Malcolm stopped and knocked on a door.  The door opened buy Duncan Attwater, who was in Creature from the Black Lagoon form at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Dunc, I forgot I forgot to bring my spare undies from summer storage, so I&#39;m fresh out of a pair for the night.  You have a pair I could borrow, Dunc?&quot;<br />
<br />
Duncan looked up and down his naked fishman body and said, &quot;Do I look like I wear underwear?  Hey, Gyro, got any spare underwear?&quot;<br />
<br />
The automaton roommate whirred into action, gears squeaking, and lights flashing, as Gyro scanned the room.  In an unnatural monotone, Gyro said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure where Casey is, but his clothing is on the bed, and there are two pairs of underwear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure Casey won&#39;t mind. Gyro, collect the cleanest pair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casey wanted to scream as the clawed hand collected him, and handed him into Duncan&#39;s damp webbed clawed hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here ya go, mate,&quot; Duncan said handing his transformed roommate to the kid at his door.  The EMO dude took the underwear, and shoved it into this pocket with Conner.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe this is happening,&quot; whisper-moaned the blue briefs that had joined Conner in the EMO kid&#39;s pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re were-underwear too?&quot; blurted out Conner in a whisper.<br />
<br />
From further down in the pocket came another voice, &quot;That makes at least 3 of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malcolm was gone before Gyro asked Duncan, &quot;Who was that, Duncan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?  Oh, just some guy down the hall, I think?&quot; Duncan said with a shrug.<br />
<br />
Malcolm pulled a folded paper from his front pocket.  He checked off Casey&#39;s and Conner&#39;s rooms. And sighed, he needed to climb ten flights of stairs to the next one on the list.  He&#39;d prefer to fly, but he couldn&#39;t carry his were-undies with him if he flew, and he suspected they would try to escape if he left them to their own devices.  He lifted one stiff leg, and then the other, and began climbing the ten flights to South Tower Room 1313.  It took an eternity, but he didn&#39;t even break a sweat.<br />
<br />
He knocked on the door, after reading the list of occupants on the slot next to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening,&quot; said a classic Transylvanian accent.  The guy was so 19th Century, it was pathetic, thought Malcolm with a sigh.  Had to be the guy called Vlad Tepes X.  He forced a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Vlad, I forgot to bring my undies from summer storage, so I&#39;m fresh out of a pair for tonight.  Do you have a pair I could borrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would a corpse need a change of underwear?&quot; Vlad replied.<br />
<br />
Malcolm licked his lips.  Was the question rhetorical or was Vlad seeing through his glamour?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Vlad, be more polite, I&#39;m sure we can help our new friend?&quot; said the patchwork animated corpse coming into view, &quot;I&#39;m Igor, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve met yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damn, the glamour must be wearing off, thought Malcolm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Malcolm, pleasure to make your acquaintance Igor,&quot; he said extending his cold white Garlicky hand.<br />
<br />
Vlad raised his hand to face, and stepped back murmuring, &quot;Garlic, yuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive Vlad, he&#39;s a bit old school, and he&#39;s always cranky when he wakes up before he&#39;s had his evening blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, alright.  You have some underwear, I might borrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as Vlad said.  We undead really aren&#39;t into changes of clothing usually,&quot; he said this as he looked strangely at the EMO kid, and shook his head. He seemed to be seeing double.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, about the underwear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, our roommate, Lyle.  He was gone when I got back, and before Vlad uncoffined himself.  But I noticed he left a clean - I think it&#39;s called a thong on his nightstand.&quot;<br />
<br />
He picked up the shiny red g-string with one long-mismatched finger (Igor&#39;s entire hand was made of index fingers, and the one holding the red thong was in the pinky position).<br />
<br />
&quot;That will do nicely, thank you,&quot; Malcolm said eagerly grabbing the thong from the Frankensteinish piecemeal man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, buht wait. Where can Lyle get that back from you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;North Tower 409,&quot; Malcolm replied. Though if the glamour was still strong enough, Igor would forget what he said in a few moments.<br />
<br />
Malcolm fumbled with the paper on the landing.  There was no way he could get to three more rooms with his glamour failing, well maybe a different ruse.  He smiled, and started up to the fourteenth floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I&#39;m on a scavenger hunt,&quot; he began as the door opened, &quot;Trev, do you think I could give me a clean pair of knickers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who you?&quot; asked the black hairy anthro-labradordogman.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Malcolm, Trev, remember at orientation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, oh, yeah, Malcolm?  As you can see, I&#39;m a were-dog, and we don&#39;t wear underwear. But perhaps one of my roommates?&quot; he said as he turned back into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Mickey and Peter, either of you fellows got a pair of knickers for this guy on the scavenger hunt?&quot; he asked.  Peter was a bull-dogman, sitting on his bed licking his junk.  Mickey was some sort of terrier struggling to unpack his box of things.  He held a leash and a squeaky toy awkwardly in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Malcolm double checked his list of rooms.  It was well past sunset.  One of these roommates should be underwear now.  <br />
<br />
Peter said, &quot;We&#39;re all canine weres, why- oh, wait.  My former roomie left a pair in the closet next to a box of his stuff.  He traded rooms with Mickey earlier today.  I should really take it back to him, but he said he was going out for the night, so as long as you give them back to him tomorrow, I&#39;m sure it will be okay.&quot;  He reached down and picked up the black boxer briefs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, Peter! It&#39;s me, Dave!  I&#39;m were-undies.  I thought I&#39;d be back in my new room, but I had to come back for that last box, and I changed.  I figured, I&#39;d just spend the night, but no you give away my stuff the moment some stranger knocks on your door!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry, Dave!&quot;</p>
