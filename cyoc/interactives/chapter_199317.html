<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The man was absolutely gorgeous. 6&#39;5&quot; tall, and had to be at least 300 pounds, bulging everywhere. Gideon had kept his mud brown hair, which was somehow much sexier now that it was shaved into an army crop top and graying at the temples. Gideon&#39;s beard was the first thing he noticed when he woke up, along with all the glorious fur covering his physique. He was so incredibly hairy that there was no way he had anything in common with his father&#39;s genes. His father was only 6 feet tall, and this was evident when he walked by in the hallway. Though it was the first morning of their lives where Gideon was taller than his father, both men somehow had accepted it as normal. <br />
<br />
Gideon waddled in, following his smaller father with amusement. Dad didn&#39;t have that much in the way of muscle. He was more a cigar smoking badass ectomorph with dirty blond hair and a tough looking face, but he wasn&#39;t much more than skin and bones compared to his now enormous and imposing beast of a musclebear son. <br />
<br />
&quot;Notice anything different, dad?&quot;<br />
&quot;You appear to be about my age and yet I know it&#39;s you. That&#39;s interesting!&quot; Zeb began to make morning coffee as if it was just another day in their house. In reality, he knew that his son should be much smaller, a tiny boy who hadn&#39;t even reached his teens yet, short for his age. Now he was 6&#39;5&quot;, and Zeb decided that the improvement was a good thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot; Gideon looked down at his father, marveling at the deep tenor voice that echoed forth from his lips. &quot;Wow, that&#39;s a deep voice. Listen to that. I sound a lot different now! Look how big I am, Dad!&quot; Gideon flexed his muscles happily, flaunting the 23&quot; guns he now possessed in front of his pitiful looking but handsome father, staring up with aged lines crinkling his eyes. His forehead crinkled in confusion and then desire, overcome with the sexual awakening that his son was now the most masculine, bearded, fur covered stud he&#39;d ever been this close to, and in a flash he knew that he was homosexual.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m feeling right now but it feels really good and right. You wanna kiss, Dad?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, son!&quot; his rough voiced father Zeb replied. &quot;Yes, Sir!&quot; His son brought his gargantuan bearded head down to kiss his smaller father, who was soon clasped in his son&#39;s arms, nestled softly and cooing into his now dominant son&#39;s embrace. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, Dad. You&#39;ve never felt this good before and neither have I. Now, you have to go to work today, you fucking slut. Another day of fucking you at work at the studio never gets tired, especially when we tell people that I&#39;m the dad on this house. You refer to ME as DAD or DADDY from now on. You got that, handsome? You&#39;re real cute. I never noticed how sexy you are until I got this big body.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how this is happening, but I&#39;m so happy that my son is a big strong man now. I hope you can fuck me later to seal the deal, Sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Work first, BOY,&quot; Gideon smiled. His uncle trounced in. <br />
<br />
&quot;How is everyone doing?&quot; Uncle Craig asked, popping in with a bounce to his step. &quot;I see everything here is going well. Are you two hitting it off yet?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Gideon answered for his father, shushing him with a hand. &quot;In fact, I am loving this scenario so much that I&#39;m fairly certain I&#39;m going to remain this way. I mean, look at me. I&#39;m an absolute beast of a man and I exude masculine energy. That&#39;s what you really need, Dad. Someone to be in charge of you. But don&#39;t worry, dummy. I am so gonna take care of you, Dad. But you gotta take the garbage out now. You&#39;re doing that from now on. Go on. Take the garbage out, Dad! Now! Hustle up, dumbass!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes, Sir! Sorry Sir, I meant to do them last night.&quot; <br />
<br />
Craig watched his handiwork with shock and wore exaggerated faces where he was absolutely in love with his new family. He could barely contain his own happiness. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t give me excuses, just carry out my orders,&quot; the muscular man said, swaggering around the room like he owned the place, because he now did. &quot;And uh, then make me some breakfast. I have an appointment this morning with some of those clients from Alberta that are visiting for the weekend. I&#39;m going to convince them why they should choose my company and then I take home an enormous percentage when they sign on board. It&#39;s all very complicated, so I&#39;ll spare you the details. You wouldn&#39;t understand. You&#39;re just a security guard, right? What a stunning one you make, too. That&#39;s why when you&#39;re not a security guard, you&#39;re getting money for people to watch your webcam as you get fucked by younger man after younger man, each of them telling you what to do. Luckily, no one cares about who some security guard is sucking off in his spare time for jollies, and you should be proud of that dick of yours, pops. It pays my bills a lot of the time. I have expensive habits, after all. You keep up your thing, pretending you&#39;re a big tough man out there. We both know who rules the roost when you get home, puddin&#39;.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gideon kissed Zeb selfishly and with no care for what his father wanted. He was now in charge. He never imagined the sexual urges of an adult man could feel so amazingly...hot. Heat radiated throughout his body. He felt alive and confident, brazen and arrogant. He felt superior, especially compared with his now smaller, handsome stud of a dad. <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you guys feel about being in love, with Gideon as the dominant in the family?&quot; Craig approached Gideon and ignored Zeb. <br />
<br />
&quot;After I get home from work, you&#39;re gonna see your handiwork up close, Uncle Craig. Now what you may not realize is both of you fags are gonna do exactly as I say OR ELSE. You understand me? If I tell you to change my father into something else, you will. Same goes for you. I now have the power over you to do whatever I want. And you&#39;re gonna go along with it because you made me the dominant in the family, you enormous dumbass. That means you have to do what I say, too. You don&#39;t have a choice. I&#39;m in charge. You got that, Craig?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir. I understand, Sir. I&#39;ve hoisted myself by my own petard, Sir.&quot; <br />
&quot;I actually know what that means now.&quot; Gideon shook his head. &quot;I have so much new information in my head. I can&#39;t believe I oversee such complicated financial transactions. This is awesome!<br />
<br />
He realized he had to get dressed. While his father made breakfast, Gideon dressed in a suit and tie, expensive tailor made outfits that showed off his godly, almost glowing masculine beauty. His eyes radiated penetrating sexual power and his walk was more of a strut. He was a walking sex object, everywhere he went people would be stunned by his handsome and rugged lumbersexual face. <br />
<br />
Gideon took the keys and demanded he drive his father to work, dropping him off and giving him a stern warning to be at the curb by 5 sharp. No dilly dallying, he told his new 40 year old son. After sending three guys into a studio to plow his boyfriend, Gideon gave instructions to the crew and took off for more important appointments. He had discovered he could keep much more money if he pimped his own father out himself and pocketed all the money. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even think twice that this was the first time he had ever driven a car. And wearing a confident grin, he knew that everyone in the office depended on him and his incredible expertise more than anyone else. <br />
<br />
Yeah, this was going to be a wish worth exploring, the former lad thought, as he strutted into his new office, staring down at all his smaller and often even diminutive male office team. No women on the staff. He didn&#39;t need them crowding his style. He only hired gay boys who knew how to take orders, except the few tops who he put into management positions, always finding alpha gays he could connect with in order to develop a definite harmony and flow to the office he&#39;d created. One in which suboordinates were carefully chosen submissives. <br />
<br />
As he brought in the first intern blow job of the morning, he got his sweet reward from a scrawny man he recognized as being one of his former bully&#39;s fathers. He&#39;d seen the man at school a few times. This reality just gets better and better. Can&#39;t wait for his son to find out I fuck his dad in the ass and blow loads in his mouth. I bet he&#39;ll love me being in his life as a new father figure. <br />
<br />
He came in the man&#39;s mouth. The sub, known as Robert, was extremely grateful for the chance to serve a man after a long and unsuccessful marriage to a woman he could never satisfy with his two inch penis, a pathetic two incher that couldn&#39;t even get her pregnant. His son had been the result of a cuckolding so that they could raise a baby together, only now he was a single father. <br />
<br />
All of this had been different from the original universe, Gideon thought. In that universe, this man was happily married, confident and respectable and now he&#39;s just my bitch! Awesome! </p>
