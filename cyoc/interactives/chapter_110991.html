<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken tapped his pencil as he thought about what to change. &#39;What if I change the human race in such a way they are no longer &#39;human&#39;?&#39; Ken thought as he smirked and turned the page of the note book to the human race one.<br />
Erasing almost everything on the page Ken started to write, knowing that it wouldn&#39;t take effect until he stopped writing. Replacing the name of the &#39;human&#39; race with &#39;slime&#39; race he started to rewrite the race.<br />
&quot;Slimes start their lives as looking the same as genderless humans. But as they grow older they begin to change. At a year old their toes will have turned into slime, which is a different color for each person. At age two their feet will have become entirely slime, and can be changed into different forms at will, but only with the slime present. By age five they will be slime from the knees down, at which point they will no longer be able to hold shape, and melt into a blob of slime below the knees that slimes can move around on. At age ten they will have become slime from the hips down, no longer having legs, but at this point the change to slime will have stopped for now. At age twelve slimes regain the ability to morph their slimy bodies into legs, tails, anything they can think of so long as they have enough slime as part of them. At age thirteen slimes start to change again, this time gaining their genders. Slimes that will become male will be able to form a penis from their slime, not that it does anything, but won&#39;t change much at all. Female slimes on the other hand will grow a pair of breasts on their chest and become more feminine as they age, and their hair will grow longer. At age fourteen their transformation begins again, with their body becoming slime from the midriff down. Female slimes will have the inclination to morph their lower bodies into feminine shapes or tail, while Males will form masculine shapes. By age fifteen slimes&#39; hands with start to turn into slime, and their bodies will be slime from the chest down, just below where the breasts would be on a female slime. At age sixteen slimes once again lose the ability to morph their bodies from their bloblike form, and their arms will be entirely slime before melding into their slimly body, leaving them limbless for a year until age seventeen, where slimes will be slimes from the neck down, and regain the ability to morph again. At this point the hair of a slime will start to become slime as well, usually a shade darker then the slime&#39;s normal color. At age eighteen the transformation will end with slimes being completely slime, even the head, at this point they will stop aging.&quot; Ken wrote as his replacement for the human race. He would have to write more details later, but right now he felt a little strange. Quickly turning to his page in the note book Ken wrote that he was twelve years old so that he could start where he wanted to as a slime.<br />
Ken watched as his feet became blue slime, quickly pulling his pants and under where off as his legs followed suit, becoming blue slime as it reached his hips, changing them into slime as his now slimy lower body settled into place as a blob he could mold. &quot;Sweet... and now for the details.&quot; Ken muttered as he wanted back to the notebook, holding his pen.<br />
&quot;Slimes reproduce by have a male slime and a female slime meld their lower bodies together and staying that way for an entire week as a slime baby forms between them. After a week the baby will be born and the female slime will take care of the child, the male usually leaving their mated slime. Slimes require air until they are at least sixteen, when their lungs become slime. Slimes can enter water and hold themselves together, being a mostly solid liquid themselves. Some slimes prefer to live underwater instead of on land. As slimes age depending on their gender they will start to act differently. Male slimes will become more loner and territorial, while female slimes start to act for fun loving and &#39;ditzy&#39; for a lack of a better term. while female slime may act dumb, they are actually smarter then their male counterparts, they just prefer to act ditzy because it&#39;s in their nature.  Slimes are divided into two types of tribes, one male and one female. The female tribe has all the children, which upon gaining their gender, either leave for the a male tribe if male or stay with their tribe if female. Slimes are not a highly advanced race, hunting by changing their bodies into a variety of tools, though the preferred method of hunting among males is smashing, females prefer suffocation. When eating slimes will dissolve their prey into their bodies, gaining their nutrients and adding a part of the victim&#39;s mass to their own slimy bodies.<br />
Males can only mate three times before dying, their bodies dissolving into water after mating three times. Females however will live until their bodies give out, which has yet to been observed, as female slimes are known to become hundreds of years old. as a result the chance to become a female slime is 30% to the 70% for males. <br />
Slimes live either in huts on land that they have build from trees, or in cave systems or underwater villages below the seas. If children slimes are born in underwater villages, they will be kept in tunnels that have air pockets and cared for until they no longer require air. Male and Female slimes rarely interact outside of mating. Slimes do know enough to be able to make basic quills, arrows and paper. If a slime wanted to launch something, they usually do it by forming a bow with their slimy arms and launching the object. Male slimes are known to be bad archers while females have excellent eyesight and archery skills. Slimes are a mostly tribal race, with a healthy respect for the the world and it&#39;s resources. Slimes to not wear clothes, no matter their gender.&quot; Ken wrote smiling as the world started to change around him.<br />
His room melted away into a wooden cabin style with a stone floor his table becoming just a basically wood one as the notebook stayed the same, his pencil becoming a quill dotted with ink as he closed the notebook and left it on the table. He had removed the human race, and now it was time to grow up to enjoy this new world he had created.</p>
