<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyra was rather proud of Heather. A less-controlled Heather would have attacked that woman for trying to snag Jeremy from her. But she showed very good restraint in not using physical violence to scare her off. But roaring and making that hussy run into the wall was hilarious. And Tyra was particularly pleased that the video of that incident ended up winning Heather $10,000. She hoped her granddaughter would be doing something wise with that money.<br />
<br />
So Tyra was a little bit concerned when she received a call from Horizon Labs to talk with them about something. She hurried over there as soon as she could. Dr. Stein and his assistant were waiting for her. &quot;Ah, glad you can get here so promptly,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where Heather&#39;s concerned, nothing&#39;s too important to wait,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, this isn&#39;t about Heather,&quot; said Dr. Stein&#39;s assistant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeremy?&quot; asked Tyra. The assistant shook his head. &quot;Me?&quot; asked Tyra, now sounding worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not...precisely,&quot; said the assistant, &quot;You&#39;re more of a...point of reference in this case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come again?&quot; asked Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is about a co-worker of yours who was recently hired by the Meat Market,&quot; said Dr. Stein, &quot;Do you know Olivia Goldsmith?&quot; Tyra just raised an eyeridge in confusion. &quot;She&#39;s changed her name Gazette Oryx,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gazette Onyx,&quot; corrected his assistant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, that antelope gal,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s a gazelle,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can&#39;t tell the difference between the two,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gazelles are a type of antelope,&quot; said the assistant.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not important right now,&quot; said Dr. Stein before turning to Tyra and said, &quot;I suppose you&#39;ve noticed her behavior since she&#39;s started working the Meat Market.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She certainly does quite a bit to make herself noticed,&quot; agreed Tyra, thinking back.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Being on the stage gives Tyra an unimpeded view around the Meat Market, though being offstage didn&#39;t make it hard to look around. Typically, Tyra didn&#39;t pay much attention to the audience as she performed. Unlike some other adult performers, she couldn&#39;t really concentrate on one particular member of the audience as she was too large for most men, even Animalians. But when she wasn&#39;t actively performing, she did sometimes look around to see what her co-workers were doing.<br />
<br />
The Meat Market didn&#39;t really have a strict uniform code. The cocktail waitresses who went around the room could wear anything wanted so long as they weren&#39;t indecent. But they still dressed up sexily to appeal to the customers. One of the most commonly seen sets of clothes were bikinis that were designed after leaves.<br />
<br />
Gazette was pretty easy to pick out from her fellow waitresses. It wasn&#39;t because of her particular curves, though she was generously endowed with her breasts, which she highlighted with her bikini top. She wasn&#39;t too tall either, except for her horns. What really made Onyx stick out was her dyed hair, the edges of her brown hair were a distinctive mauve. There was also the fact that she wore hoop earrings, which was uncommon among Animalians. Most uplifted Animalians blanched at the thought of getting their ears pierced, preferring clip-ons at most. But the biggest difference between Gazette and an uplifted gazelle was that her bikini top was so tight, her nipples were clearly outline and it was evident that they were pierced. And that was something <i>no</i> Animalian would subject themselves to.<br />
<br />
Gazette&#39;s distinctive appearance made her easy to track around the room, though she didn&#39;t do a lot to keep herself anonymous. She did bring the customers the drinks they ordered, but she often offered a lot more than that. For instance, she had gone over to a businessman who had chosen a rather odd place for his lunch break. &quot;So, you looking for a little dessert after your meal?&quot; asked Gazette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon?&quot; asked the businessman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I can offer you something sweet, round, and goes straight for your hips,&quot; said Gazette, getting uncomfortably close.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean &#39;to my hips&#39;, right?&quot; asked the businessman.<br />
<br />
Gazette practically sat on his lap and said, &quot;I think you know what I meant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, lady, I don&#39;t have enough time for this kind of thing. My lunch break isn&#39;t that long,&quot; said the businessman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, surely your boss can let you have a little more time off,&quot; crooned Gazette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if they knew what I was up to. I just want to finish my drink and get going,&quot; said the businessman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your loss, sugar,&quot; said Gazette, walking away and making sure he saw plenty of her ass in her tight miniskirt.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;So, yeah, she&#39;s extra flirty over there,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;But what does this have to do with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve noticed that when women of an advanced age are double-dosed, they experience a very considerable surge in libido,&quot; said the assistant.<br />
<br />
&quot;So she&#39;s interested in her restored sexuality, big deal,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;I&#39;m reveling in being young too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but you&#39;re not bordering on nymphomania like she is, which may or may not be enhanced by her PTSD,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
&quot;The gal has shell-shock?&quot; asked Tyra, &quot;How&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as Olivia Goldsmith, she was 15 years old and living in France when the Nazis captured France,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;d be a hard time for anyone to live through,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse,&quot; said Dr. Stein, &quot;Her family was Jewish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyra winced at that. &quot;Oh, that would mess anyone up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She did become a part of the French Resistance,&quot; said the assistant, &quot;She was the contact for several US Army agents to inform them on the movement on Nazi troops. And one of those agents was Daniel Richardson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, so he got her into the program here,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;More than that. After the war, he got her political asylum and American citizenship. Though what she experience left many mental scars. Her PTSD were what got her into Project Phoenix,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
 Tyra had heard that some had joined Project Phoenix because of mental problems. Mostly it was things like Alzheimer&#39;s or senility, Tyra wasn&#39;t sure if addiction was a mental or physical problem. &quot;So, after ya&#39;ll changed her, she started acting more sexed up than usual?&quot; asked Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;There were certainly signs when she was converted,&quot; said the assistant.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Olivia was half-listening as the assistant was taking her to the changing room. She was trying not to let her horrible flashbacks overtake her, not now. But once she was an Animalian, her night terrors would be over. She had chosen to become a Thomson&#39;s Gazelle for their speed and grace. She had heard that particular gazelle was particularly popular because of some recent movie. But what really mattered most was that she&#39;ll be able to escape the horrors of her past.<br />
<br />
She was a bit surprised when the assistant asked her to pull up her sleeve. Olivia saw he was ready to give her the injections. She pulled up the sleeve of her dress and allowed him to inject the serum. After that, the assistant left so she could change in privacy. Olivia soon felt and an odd tingle go through her body. Curious, she stripped to her underwear to see the process. Her appearance in the mirror wasn&#39;t much to speak of, a skinny old woman of 93, her face heavily wrinkled by stress. But the wrinkles were started to fade as soft fur started to appear on her arms. She watched in fascination as her shriveled hands, shaking with arthritis, became dainty and fair again as the tips became encased in keratin. Her feet soon changed as well, making her sit down as her feet stretched out, the heel lifting high as her toes became hooves.<br />
<br />
As her skin was covered with the distinctive tan, white, and black-striped fur of a Thomson&#39;s Gazelle, Olivia really felt her body youthening. A tingle in her nether regions she hasn&#39;t felt in years was becoming extremely apparent. She felt her breasts quivered as years of sagging reversed. Before long, they were as perky as they once were again. Perkier in fact as they were growing larger than they had before. Olivia unclipped her bra to allow her larger breasts to bounce free. With a lusty moan, she started fondling them, feeling her nipples engorge as her mammary glands filled up with rich milk. She was so engrossed in this, she barely felt her small tufted tail form. But what she did feel was her pussy demanding attention. Olivia slipped one hand into her panties and started furiously fingering herself.<br />
<br />
After that, she paid no further attention to the changing of her body, not even as her face extended into a muzzle, her ears grew out, or her horns appeared. All Olivia cared about was getting herself out. She moaned louder and louder as she got closer to her release. Pretty soon, she let out a bleat as both her pussy and her nipples gushed. But she was far from satisfied now. She only took a moment to look at her new reflection and the incredibly sexy gazelle she had become. Her hair, gone white with age and shock, was back to his former brown. It seemed so...boring to Olivia. In fact her own name sounded boring. There was definitely a few alterations she could make to herself now. But she wasn&#39;t finished here yet. Removing her panties for easier access, she was soon fingering herself again, wishing she had a big, strong male to plow her.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Near as we can tell, she spent half an hour relieving herself,&quot; said the assistant.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re worried her libido&#39;s getting out of control,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet, but it could progress to that,&quot; said Dr. Stein, &quot;We had called you because we wanted to see if your hormone levels are comparable with hers. As you and your granddaughter will testify,  you&#39;re a lot more...active now then you were when you were originally young.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no lie in that,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, if you could, keep an eye on Gazette while she&#39;s at the Meat Market so she doesn&#39;t do something stupid,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure how much time I can devote to that, but I&#39;ll watch her when I can,&quot; said Tyra.</p>
