<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sage woke up just under four hours later, once again, bursting with energy.  Thinking of <br />
Skye, she pleasured herself again...and again, wishing her lover was healthy.<br />
<br />
She had a naughty thought just then, and try as she might, couldn't get it out of her mind <br />
completely.<br />
<br />
She bounded out of bed.  She felt so light!  &quot;Mm...I can get used to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
After going through her morning routine, she checked herself in the mirror.  She was <br />
almost disappointed that she hadn't become a perky teen in the night.  <br />
<br />
She went about her daily activities, and made her way to the hospital for visiting hours.  <br />
The doors couldn't normally be locked, but she managed to swipe a nurse's keycard.  Just <br />
before lunch, the nurses didn't check patients on this floor for a good hour.<br />
<br />
She'd observed that before, but never really thought much about it until today.<br />
<br />
She shouldn't be doing this, but she just couldn't help herself, as she got undressed, <br />
singing softly.<br />
<br />
Skye had said it was &quot;their song&quot;, and she hoped that her lover could hear her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby, I know you're sleeping...but I need you...so bad.  Please don't think less of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pulled aside the covers, and got on the bed, looming over Skye's body.  The smaller <br />
girl looked like a lifeless doll.   Sage leaned down and kissed her angel, then removed her <br />
gown, revealing a pair of pretty breasts.  They were a little flabby, but that wasn't Skye's <br />
fault, she hadn't been very active lately.<br />
<br />
To Sage, they were perfect.  She kissed Skye's breasts, then licked, nibbled, and sucked on <br />
her nipples.  Moving down, she kissed and licked Skye's body.<br />
<br />
They'd been keeping her angel shaved, which pleased Sage greatly as she kissed Skye's <br />
bare skin.  She held her lover's lips apart as she began to lick, her tongue probing into the <br />
other girl.<br />
<br />
Even though Skye remained lifeless, Sage continued for quite some time, and was <br />
rewarded as the girl's body began to react, just a little.  She crawled up and held her baby <br />
close.  &quot;Oh Skye, you're still in there, aren't you?&quot;   <br />
<br />
She cleaned herself and Skye up, and got dressed.  She could taste Skye on her tongue.  <br />
She felt giddy; she hadn't been so naughty in her life!<br />
<br />
Kissing Skye goodbye, she skipped out of the room, almost knocking into a nurse.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!  Excuse me, Miss!  I didn't think anyone was in there!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage just beamed.  &quot;I was just saying hi, she seems so lonely in there.  Be back tomorrow!&quot;<br />
<br />
The nurse shook her head.  &quot;Was I ever that young?&quot;  She sighed.  <br />
<br />
The manager of the video store kept staring at Sage during her shift.  Whenever she <br />
confronted him, he would babble about how she looked really good today.<br />
<br />
By the time she showed up at Megan's, she'd noticed her clothing seemed a bit loose; was <br />
she losing more weight?<br />
<br />
She'd missed Megan's mom, but her young friend was thrilled and met her at the door.  <br />
After a half hour of playing one of Meg's video games, she looked over at her taller friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sage?  You look different all of a sudden.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage blinked.  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, well, your clothes look funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure enough, her clothing was even more loose on her body.   Standing up, her skirt slid <br />
down her legs and pooled at her feet!   &quot;Oh no...what's happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan stood up, and Sage was surprised that the girl seemed taller than before.<br />
<br />
No...not taller....<br />
<br />
Sage's eyes widened.  She was smaller!<br />
<br />
She ran to hall, where the closet had a full-length mirror on the door.  Staring back at her <br />
was a girl she hadn't seen in years; a fourteen-year-old Sage, wearing an oversized shirt, <br />
her panties barely clinging to her hips.  With a shudder, she actually shrank a little more, <br />
and her panties slide down her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sage, you're smaller now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage gulped.  &quot;I...I'm getting younger, Megan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People get younger?  Mommy said we only get bigger and older.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage explained about the drug she was taking as best as she could, even as her body <br />
continued to grow younger. Her chest was almost flat now, and her pubic hair was <br />
receding fast.  Her arms and legs looked coltish now....it wouldn't be long before she was <br />
a preadolescent!<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm scared, Megan...what's going to happen to me?&quot;  She didn't know what to do...she was <br />
regressing so quickly...her mind was whirling, and it was hard to think.<br />
<br />
Megan did the best thing her seven year old mind could think of, and hugged her friend.<br />
<br />
Sage made little whining noises as her body shrank.  It didn't hurt, exactly, in fact, it was <br />
almost pleasant, but the sensation was so alien that she was terrified...and then she <br />
blacked out.<br />
<br />
She woke some time later, with a slight headache.  She was in Megan's room...in her bed.  <br />
She sat up to find Megan staring at her, wide-eyed.<br />
<br />
Looking at herself, Sage saw her chest was completely flat, her nipples pink and tiny, and <br />
her body was about as developed as Megan's.<br />
<br />
She looked to the other girl.  &quot;What...what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You started getting littler and littler, and you were sweating, so I got you in bed.  Are you <br />
my age now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage got out of bed, a little wobbly, like a colt standing for the first time.  The cool air on <br />
her naked body made her shiver, but not with cold....she felt sexually aroused for some <br />
reason.  Standing next to Megan, she was just a hair taller than the other girl...which <br />
meant...<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, I think I'm younger than you.  I was always really tall.&quot;  She sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...so you're six now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage nodded.  &quot;Yeah...and in big trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan bit her lip.  &quot;Mommy won't understand, will she?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage shook her head.  &quot;Probably not.  If I leave you alone she'll be mad..but if she comes <br />
back and sees me like this, she'd freak out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan giggled a little at that, and despite herself, Sage joined her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it is funny, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're like my sister now.  Oh but I'm the big sister, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage smiled.  &quot;Yep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan hugged her.  &quot;I'll take care of you, I promise.  I'll text Mom, tell her something <br />
happened at the hospital, to Skye.  She won't be mad about that, she knows you two are <br />
special friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Special friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan rolled her eyes.  &quot;She doesn't think I'm old enough to know what lesbins are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lesbians?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Sage was afraid to ask.  &quot;Um...so what do you think lesbians are?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan gave her a 'well, duh' look.  &quot;That's when a girl likes other girls, not boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't bother you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh.  Boys are icky.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite her situations, Sage laughed.<br />
<br />
With Megan covering for her, she borrowed one of Meg's outfits and slipped over to her <br />
apartment.  Finding Marcy's business card, she called her.</p>
