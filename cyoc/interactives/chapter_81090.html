<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She braced herself against the pavement with her free hand, and her fingers' penetrating rhythm increased suddenly before she cried out in orgasm. The pedestrians around us stopped and clapped politely, smiling and nodding at the girl and me like this was some kind of performance art.  She straightened up, her face flushed red, and dipped her head politely to the crowd before turning back to face me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Kira, what's your name?&quot; She asked me, flipping her hair over her shoulder with the hand not covered in pussy juice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, Daniel, my-my name is Daniel.&quot; I couldn't seem to take my eyes off of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;'Daniel', that's a nice name.&quot; She tipped her head down and looked up at me through her long blond lashes. &quot;Would you like to be my friend, Daniel?&quot; She looked up at me with lust-dilated eyes and started to press close to me. &quot;My 'special' friend?&quot; <br />
<br />
It struck me that she was talking like a character from a porno, or one of those meet'n'fuck games, and I realized that I didn't want that.<br />
<br />
The girl in front of me staggered and blinked a couple times before looking down at herself and then at her sticky hand in horror. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god what did you do to me?!&quot; She backed away, looking at me with pain and tears rapidly filling her eyes. She took another step back and looked around at the busy crowd. &quot;Somebody! Somebody help me!&quot; she wailed. <br />
<br />
I started to reach out to her and she froze again. For an instant, I couldn't figure out if the terrified girl was behaving how she would have without my wish's influence, or if in that split-second I'd wanted her to be afraid of me. I had felt a little threatened by how fast she'd been coming onto me, so maybe that was it?<br />
<br />
She shivered and rolled her eyes, blinking away the tears.  Her body language went from terrified to studiously nonchalant in the space of a couple breaths. &quot;So,&quot; she drawled, looking off into space and picking up her purse, &quot;did I just like, totally give you a free sex show or somethin'?&quot; She looked at me with a knowing smile and a sparkle in her eyes.<br />
<br />
I caught my breath. &quot;Uh, yeah, you totally did.  It was pretty hot.&quot; I thought really hard about her not changing personalities again until I thought &quot;Ding!&quot; at her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Rock on.  Here, hold this.&quot; She handed me her purse and popped it open so she could rummage around inside with her clean hand.<br />
<br />
I silently wished that she had something to clean herself up with. The contents of her purse seemed to ripple, then she pulled out a travel pack of wet wipes.<br />
<br />
&quot;On a scale of one to ten,&quot; She said, running a wipe over her hands, &quot;one being a geriatric lady in a wheelchair, and ten being the most smoking hot chick you've ever fantasized about,&quot; she paused wiping her thighs to glance up at me, the wet wipe pressed against her snatch, &quot;how hot was I?&quot; She resumed wiping and tossed the resulting mess into a trashcan nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'd have to give you at least an eight, maybe an eight point five.&quot; I smiled at the confident young woman in front of me as she put her hands on her hips and pouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;That!&quot; She sighed and reclaimed her purse. &quot;is room for improvement.&quot;  She looked at me quizzically and reached over to mess with the little bow tie I had to wear for work.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a snazzy-dressed gent like yourself doing standing on the sidewalk with a big wad of cash and my-naked-self?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this is just a clip-on for work,&quot; I gestured at the shop behind her.  She put her hands back on her hips, leaned back and glanced theatrically over her shoulder.  Her breasts caught my attention as they swayed and bobbed along with her movement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Newsflash, it's obviously a clip-on.&quot; She straightened up again.  &quot;And I'm guessing the Hallmark store slash old-time candy shoppe doesn't pay you in crumpled tens and twenties.&quot; She pronounced the silent e in shoppe with a head wiggle.  &quot;So lets try again; why are you outside ogling me,&quot; She tucked her hair back with both hands and my eyes were again drawn to her breasts as they briefly stuck out towards me. &quot;instead of inside selling candy?  Not that I mind the ogling, kinda gotta expect that when you go around town naked.&quot; She raised an eyebrow and looked at me expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, well, a customer left her purse so I ran it out to her before she got on the bus.&quot; I ran my hand through my hair and tried to match gazes with Kira.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice! 'Bashful boy brings back bag,' film at eleven.&quot; She gave me a light punch on the shoulder, then somehow managed to hook her arm around mine and started us walking back into the candy shop.  I stuffed the wad of cash in my pocket and marveled at the way the crowd parted for us before remembering my wish was still affecting other people, even if I'd apparently stopped controlling Kira? I thought for a moment about her doing something I wanted her to.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I notice you seem to like my breasts.&quot; She said as we stepped through the doorway. &quot;Wanna touch 'em?&quot; She let go of my arm and turned to stick her tits out at me. &quot;It's totally cool, I don't mind.&quot; She rolled her eyes and grinned. &quot;Actually I really want you to, 'cuz I think you're kinda cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe still controlling her, but definitely filtered through the quirky personality she'd adopted.  I was trying to decide if I should feel guilty about manipulating her this way when she impatiently grabbed my hands and cupped them around her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got tired of waiting. You can squeeze now, or tug, or whatever your skeeze is.&quot; She folded her arms behind her back and started humming and looking around the store.<br />
<br />
I gently squeezed Kira's breasts a few times, then began stroking them with my fingertips. Around the nipples, up to her chest, then back down the sides and underneath. She gasped slightly as I ran my nails across her tightening nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoo-boy! Gonna need another wet wipe if you keep that up!&quot; As snapped my head up to look at her face Kira smiled and leaned forward to kiss me.  In a moment our arms were wrapped around eachother and we were french kissing like there was no tomorrow.  I did have enough presence of mind to slide a hand down and finally squeeze her behind.<br />
<br />
After a couple minutes of tonsil hockey she put her hands on my cheeks to hold me in place as she pulled away. &quot;Down boy! Let me catch my breath.&quot; She grinned at me and licked some saliva off her lips. &quot;I had a feeling you were going to be an awesome kisser, glad I was right.&quot;  She let go of me and started walking through the candy racks.<br />
<br />
I followed behind, noting her pussy lips were dark and slightly parted, guess she really did find me a good kisser!  It occurred to me that dating a naked chick would make the whole 'is she or isn't she' question pretty moot: I only had to glance down to see if I was turning her on.  It also dawned on me that this was true for every woman in a relationship with a guy--no wonder women were so confident!<br />
<br />
Kira had stopped swishing her ass at me to gape at a wooden bin with dozens of different flavors of sucker sticks.  &quot;Oh, my, god.  I have died and gone to candy store heaven!&quot; She looked over at me and frowned &quot;Would you believe I have a huge oral fetish?  Just can't wait to get something long hard and sweet into my mouth.&quot; She grinned suddenly. &quot;Gotcha!  That kinda thing always trips guys' triggers.&quot; She picked through the candy sticks and selected a watermelon flavored one.  &quot;Shop Boy!  Be a good lad and ring this up for me.  If you hurry I might let you taste it second-hand!&quot;<br />
<br />
I took the candy from her and headed over to the register.  Roger, the other guy working this afternoon, gave Kira an appreciative once-over as she strolled along behind me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Dan, I'll trade you if this young lady would prefer some expert assistance from an older man?&quot; He wiggled his eyebrows at Kira. Roger was a few years older than me, his dad was a part-owner in the shop so he worked as much or as little as he wanted to and no one said anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; I said handing him the candy and a ten dollar bill, &quot;this should settle my tab.  And while you're at it,&quot; I removed the clip-on bow tie and set it on the counter. &quot;you can put this in the drawer; I quit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel!&quot; Kira squealed behind me and beat on my shoulder with her open hand. &quot;You can't just quit your job!&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger looked at me for a moment, then glanced at Kira before looking back at me. &quot;Sure, take the afternoon off, the tie will be waiting for you when you come back.&quot; He smiled at Kira. &quot;Hope to see you around a lot more Miss!&quot;  Kira squirmed a bit under his gaze, but didn't bother covering up her tits or pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel, may I speak with you outside?&quot; She said imperiously.  <br />
<br />
As we stepped out into the sunlight she took my arm again and we started walking down the street. &quot;Actually, I'm not even mad.  That other guy was creepin' a bit so I was ready to leave.&quot;  She peeled the cellophane from her candy and popped one end in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you get that a lot from guys? Going around naked and all?&quot; I asked curiously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Some.  More than when I wear clothes, but not as often as you might think.&quot; She worked the candy from one side of her mouth to the other and back.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don't go naked all the time?&quot; I asked grinning at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't go naked ever.&quot; She said flatly, then smiled at me. &quot;'Nude' is a state of being unclad, 'naked' is a state of being exposed.  If I'm comfortable in my skin, I'm not naked, which makes me a nudist.&quot;  She skipped slightly and hummed as she looked into the shop window we were passing.<br />
<br />
Trying valiantly not to be distracted by her bouncing breasts, I said &quot;But earlier didn't you say you were--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel,&quot; Kira said, twirling to press herself against my chest and look me up in the eyes, &quot;Never ask a woman to be consistent, it's not in our nature.&quot; Sh pulled the candy from her mouth. &quot;Now kiss me you fool!&quot; She threw her head back, eyes closed, sugar-sticky lips pursed for a kiss, so I leaned down and kissed her.<br />
<br />
After a couple minutes of enjoying second-hand watermelon and squeezing Kira's ass some more she broke the kiss. &quot;Not fair, I only have one hand free for grab-arse while you've got both.  Here, hold my candy.&quot; She deposited her candy stick in my unresisting hand and proceeded to squeeze the bejeesus out of my ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Careful, you'll leave bruises!&quot; I yelped at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awe, does Kira's big strong boy fear for his tender bits?  Just wait 'til I get you home and out of those pants!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Where is home anyway?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh,&quot; Kira rolled her eyes, &quot;Student dorms over at Dempsey College.  Such a drag, but Mater and Paps want their baby girl to get an education.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hence strolling downtown in the nude?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hence doing anything to break out of the staid, sheep-like undergraduate conformist blargle margle blah.&quot; Kira plopped herself down on a bench and tugged on my arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a technical term?&quot; I asked as I sat down. &quot;'Blargle margle blah?'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it means the utter abrogation of thought brought about by too much lecturing by old people.&quot; Kira sucked meditatively on the stub of her watermelon stick before chewing it to bits with loud crunching noises.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what you want to do with your life?  Sell candy?&quot;  She asked meditatively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, and I quit, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure sure, but what happens when the rent's due?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This.&quot; I said decisively and stood up.  <br />
<br />
I stepped to the nearest person wearing a hat; a hipster in a trillby, and held out my hand.  The hipster glanced at me, handed me his hat and pulled out his wallet.  Around me a small crowd was gathering, each person pulling out what they could afford to give me and dropping the bills into the hat.  After a couple minutes Kira pushed through the crowd to stand next to me and stared in amazement as the cash kept coming.  Eventually I gathered the money together into a wad a bit bigger than the first one I'd collected, peeled off a $20 bill for the hipster and returned his hat.  He walked off and Kira and I were left standing alone on a deserted sidewalk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap, how is that even possible?&quot; Kira stared at me in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the old lady I helped gave me this ring as a reward, and it lets me do things.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get outa town! Like make strangers give you money?!&quot; She paused for a moment then pointed at me in shock. &quot;Or make Kira put on a sexy show for you!  That was totally your ring wasn't it!?&quot; She grabbed my hand and peered closely at the ring.  &quot;Not much to look at is it?&quot;  She let go of my hand and grinned at me excitedly. So what else can it do?&quot; She looked at me sternly.  &quot;Can you destroy the earth?&quot; <br />
<br />
'I hope not, that's where I keep all my stuff!' I quoted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you pass.&quot; Kira grinned. &quot;Got an obscure cartoon reference, 10 points Daniel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren't upset about, you know, playing with yourself in public?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfft, no?&quot; Kira said. &quot;I got a totally satisfying orgasm for like, ten seconds effort? And then people applauded.  Total ego boost.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stuffed the new wad of cash in my other pocket and held out my arm.<br />
<br />
Kira came over and took it and we started walking again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So seriously, what else can it do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think I could make your boobs bigger, or at least both the same size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Don't say that, you'll make righty embarrassed!  It's not her fault she's small for her age.&quot; She looked up at me and wiggled her eyebrows. &quot;Are you wanting to see more of me around too, Daniel me boyo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I suppose I could try shrinking lefty to match--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's lefty? My boobs are named righty and Susan.&quot;  Kira smiled manically.  &quot;Oh okay, you can make them bigger. --but they have to end up a whole cup-size, none of this, 'in-between, never fitting in a bra' size shit, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
I stopped and cupped Kira's breasts in my hands and silently wished for them to grow--naturally--into healthy, perky, extra sensitive D cups.<br />
<br />
Kira gasped and I felt a sudden flush of heat as her breasts expanded under my hands.  Kira put her hands over mine and pressed them tightly against her chest, mashing her tits flat.  She wiggled a bit from side to side and began violently moving my hands up and down. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna!&quot; Kira threw her head back and shrieked with pleasure. When she was done I released her breasts and admired them for a couple seconds before she stepped forward to rub them and her belly against me. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, that's two you've given me and I haven't even seen your junk yet.&quot; She smiled and pressed her head under my chin. &quot;Thank you.  If they look as awesome as they feel you are going to be the luckiest boyfriend in all Kramer hall.&quot; She paused for a moment.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, with that ring I guess you could just make me put out any time you want some.  But right now I'm pretty much feeling willing to put out any time you want anyway, so I guess that's moot.  Unless you're already using the ring to make me want to have sex with you, in which case I hope your place is closer than mine because Dempsey is like, all the way across town.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pulled back slightly and looked up at me eagerly.  &quot;So, sex.  When? Where? Right here? On the sidewalk? Behind the bushes? In an alley? Flag down a cab?  Help a girl out already, I wanna take these tits for a real test drive!&quot;</p>
