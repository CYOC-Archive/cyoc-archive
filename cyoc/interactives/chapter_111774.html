<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tuesday morning came in Moon Lake and Martin Stovall awoke to his alarm to find his arms wrapped around his wife, Melissa, and felt her arms around him. Her body glowed with the same light he&#39;d seen all those years ago at one of the gas stations in Moon Lake while she was driving through. He grasped her and held her to him, wanting to give her all the love that he could and show her that he missed her while visiting California to help his mother. Doing so began to wake her up as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emmm...&quot; Melissa yawned to find herself in a warm hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, beautiful,&quot; Martin said to his wife, &quot;Sleep well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I always do when you&#39;re here beside me,&quot; Melissa smiled back.<br />
<br />
The two hugged and then sat up in bed, slowly breaking apart, even if part of them didn&#39;t really want to. Melissa followed her husband with her eyes as he made his way toward his dresser. Her eyes focused directly on the flaccid penis hanging between his legs, though she lost sight of it as he pulled on a clean pair of underwear. She sighed and leaned over to turn off the alarm and began to get out of bed, herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going into work today?&quot; Melissa asked, judging by how fast Martin was getting dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s probably a good idea based on what you told me over the phone and then what Samantha told me over the phone,&quot; Martin sighed, &quot;even if things are under control for us... there is still the potential that weres as a whole are exposed and we&#39;ll need to put together Moon Lake&#39;s plan for that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think it&#39;ll come to that?&quot; Melissa wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know right now,&quot; Martin sighed, &quot;but if it does, we WILL need to be ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa sighed and then turned her head to hear Julie&#39;s alarm going off. She then made her way toward the hallway to check on her daughter while Martin got dressed. Even if he didn&#39;t have to go to work, she did have school to get ready for. She made her way into Julie&#39;s room and found her daughter laying face down on her bed with her pillow over her head as if trying to muffle the sound of her alarm clock. Melissa quietly turned it off and then moved to make sure Julie was up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, dear, it&#39;s a new day,&quot; Melissa said softly, &quot;Time to get up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm... Eric we just got off work...,&quot; Julie said sleepily as she rolled over in bed, &quot;don&#39;t you want to snuggle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t believe I am who you think I am,&quot; Melissa chuckled as she lifted up Julie&#39;s pillow.<br />
<br />
Julie blinked her eyes open to realize that it was her mother talking to her, not Eric Anderson. She blushed heavily and gave a very sheepish smile as she sat up in bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Julie,&quot; Melissa chuckled, &quot;if your father didn&#39;t have to go to work and we didn&#39;t have to be there to make sure you&#39;re ready for school... I&#39;d probably like to snuggle with your father as much as you wish to snuggle with Eric... but you&#39;ll get to see him at school.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got Julie up and moving to get dressed, happy thoughts of seeing Eric again going through her head.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jenny awoke to the sound of the digital alarm clock going off on the nightstand next to the bed that she and Harry were in. At first, she hoped they were in either her dorm room or Harry&#39;s present room at the Jenkins house, but as her eyes came into focus, she could see the bare white walls and the very heavy door in the far corner that was designed to take whatever punishment a fully transformed were might deliver on it and suffer no damage whatsoever. That served to remind of her of where they were at the moment. They were in the college&#39;s safe room, a room designed to keep an incomplete were from causing trouble while needing to complete their transformation, and Jenny was fairly familiar with that, as she had been an incomplete were, herself, for a time. <br />
<br />
The thing that made her sigh heavily was the fact that she wasn&#39;t incomplete now. She was a complete werefox vixen with a bonded mate and the hope for centuries of happiness ahead of her, but first she had to get through Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s unwanted attention and meddling. Her past with her family had never been easy or the happiest, but Dieter Wilhelm was the worst. Even if everything had been perfect with regard how her parents had raised her, she wouldn&#39;t want to go back to Alabama just to get away from Dieter. And now he was causing trouble for her in her new home and trying to take her bonded mate from her. A real part of Jenny&#39;s mind wanted to simply tear Dieter Wilhelm apart in her fully transformed state, but she knew she couldn&#39;t do that. It&#39;d make her just as bad as him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; came Harry&#39;s voice from beside her.<br />
<br />
She turned one of her large ears, as Fennec Foxes did have large pointed ears, and then turned to face her Gray Fox mate&#39;s red eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;As good as I can be,&quot; Jenny sighed, &quot;though, hopefully things get better... like a truck crashing into Dieter Wilhelm doing a hundred miles per hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny...&quot; Harry said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, that was wrong,&quot; Jenny corrected, &quot;Make it two hundred miles per hour and on fire besides.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things will get better, Jenny,&quot; Harry assured her, &quot;things will get better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Jenny sighed, &quot;because he&#39;s caused more trouble for us than we deserve and more than I even figured my parents would cause by themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them then slowly got and prepared to get ready for the day.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The alarm went off when it was supposed to, but that wasn&#39;t the thing that actually woke Martha Anderson up. What did that was a soft nibbling on her ear, making it twitch every few seconds. It wasn&#39;t a hard or even threatening bite, more like a playful nibble with other things in mind. She glanced up and back to see her husband behind her, and in his sleep he gave out a few soft growls and opened and closed his vulpine muzzle on her feline ear. After a few moments of listening to the radio play, his eyes opened and he soon realized what he had in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you forget I&#39;ve already had my ears pierced, dear?&quot; Martha playfully asked to her husband, and grateful that a were&#39;s ability to heal hadn&#39;t closed the holes from when she got her ears pierced for the first time, though perhaps that was because they&#39;d been pierced so long ago that it was like her ears had always been pierced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; William said slowly, &quot;I think some of our activity last night carried over into some dreams...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so THAT&#39;S what was poking me in the butt,&quot; Martha teased and rolled over and throwing the covers off of them, giving him a full view of her breasts, her nipples presently hidden underneath her brown fur, &quot;a shame we have work to get ready for... or I&#39;d ask to play with it a bit this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps we could manage a quickie in the shower,&quot; William offered and and Martha both sat up in bed.<br />
<br />
Martha slowly stood up and then looked over her shoulder to look to William as she began to return to her human form, and gave a smile as began to turn back to her human form.  Her brown fur pulled back inside her skin as she resumed human form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like fun,&quot; Martha replied, &quot;I&#39;ll get the water warm... though we&#39;ll have to be in human form to enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
William quickly rose to his feet and began to follow his wife to the master bathroom to start the day, after all it would be big. He had his work at the college and Martha would have her first substitute teaching day. The only they&#39;d have to settle would be who drove to work and either who walked or if one of them dropped the other off, but first, a shower.</p>
