<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When they arrived, they were very tired, so they decided to sleep in one of the tents that they brought with them until the following morning.<br />
In the morning, they packed their tent and went on exploring the carnival. There were all sorts of interesting carts with card reading, others were regarding your future being read from a crystal ball, while the rest were simple shops.<br />
However the main attraction was a giant tent that said The amazing madame Illusia.<br />
They decided to buy two tickets with the money they had on them.<br />
After they had bought the tickets Paul started to worry about the importance of what he was about to ask. If he would be denied his wish, his whole family would have to abandon their home, so he had to succeed. On the other hand if his wish would be granted he would probably spend a lot of time or the rest of his life as a draft horse. It was a risk he was willing to take.<br />
As madame Illusia&#39;s show began everyone in the room took a seat.<br />
The first few minutes of the show were dedicated to other participants and their desires, of course everything was being recorded and broadcasted live for other people to watch.<br />
At some point madame Illusia got mad at all of these selfish desires and asked: Is there anyone who actually wants to be an animal!?<br />
That was the moment Paul was waiting for as his hand shot up.<br />
Yes, yes, you on the right! said madame Illusia.<br />
I have something to ask you madame Illusia, my family and I are in a tough spot and I don&#39;t think we will make it through winter without the help of a  draft horse. As you can probably guess by now, we don&#39;t have the money to buy one, and I can&#39;t really pull a plough in my current state, so I&#39;m asking you to turn me in to a draft horse.<br />
Madame Illusia was fascinated by this request as it was many times more selfless than the other wishes she had heard that night. It prompted her to say:<br />
I usually take a fairly large commission for custom changes but since your act is noble and what you have asked me peeked my curiosity I will let the audience decide. As she said that the audience started yell: Make him a horse! Make him a horse! Make him a horse!<br />
Madame Illusia raised up her hand to stop the shouting and fairly quickly everyone was quiet.<br />
OK young man, you seem to have won the heart of the audience and mine in the process, so you can come on the stage and I&#39;ll make you able to pull a plow.<br />
As she said that Paul made his way to the stage and in the process he was getting excited about turning into a horse, his misfortune was that madame Illusia noticed and said:<br />
Getting excited aren&#39;t we! she said as she smirked.<br />
Well I can&#39;t really help it.<br />
After she said that she told him to take of his clothes in order not to tear them apart.<br />
He reluctantly agreed and he took of all of his clothes, putting his boner on display.<br />
The audience started laughing, but madame Illusia cut them of saying that he has plenty of reasons to be excited, and now I&#39;ll show them to all of you as well.<br />
As she said that his whole body started to grow a fine layer of black and brown fur.<br />
As this happened madame Illusia got up and said:Let the fun begin! As she said that she cupped his ears with her hands and when she removed a pair of pointed horse ears jumped up from his head, one brown and the other one black.<br />
The audience cheered as he started to touch his newly found ears.<br />
As they cheered on he started to feel uncomfortable and as he got up he saw a tail sprouting from his back which eventually got a coating of glossy black hair.<br />
As this happened madame Illusia started to ask Paul and the audience if they knew why draft horses were used for pulling.<br />
After a few seconds of waiting she said: Because they have been especially bread for raw power. A draft horse&#39;s hind quarter kick could reliably kill anyone.<br />
As she said that Paul&#39;s legs started to elongate from his heels down quite a considerable amount while at the same time bulking with muscle especially around his thighs.<br />
As all of this muscle were setting around his thighs, his legs had finished elongating from his heels down creating his connons and then his fetlocks. His toes were rearranging and melting together in order to form the fleshy inside of his hooves as what remained of his nails turned a black colour and spread around the new formation creating a pair of shiny black hooves.<br />
Did you know that draft horses have 15 percent more hoof area than other horses in order to provide more grip and to prevent them from sinking in to the ground.madame Illusia said. <br />
As Paul was trying to move hin new legs his abdomen and ribcage started to grow while in the process his penis was attached to his abdomen with a sheath. As it retreated in to his sheath it continued to transform in to something fit for a stallion.<br />
You may dislike your sheath now but it will be the only thing helping you to mount a mare when the time comes. <br />
As his whole torso and ribcage were getting larger his shoulderblader moved directly under him to better support his weight while at the same time greatly restrict his range of movement. <br />
Unfortunately for you  pulling the plow doesn&#39;t require hands so you will have to repurpose them as another pair of legs. <br />
As she said that his arms started bulking up with a lot of muscle while his wrists elongated a lot to form his front cannons. His knuckles turned in to his fetlocks leaving his 4 remaining fingers to merge in to the solid fleshy mass at the center of his hooves. What remained of his fingernails turned black and engulfed what remained of his fingers with solid black keratin creating another set of hooves. <br />
Come on get up, show the audience how you have transitions from bipedal to quadrupedal. <br />
For those in the audience who don&#39;t understand what has happened, his hands have been repurposed as legs giving him much more traction and stability. <br />
Paul eventually got up on his four hooves admiring his new body and the raw power that it holds. <br />
This isn&#39;t that bad, I&#39;m starting to like this(he said as he moved his weight from one hoof to the other) I bet I could pull anything with these hooves! <br />
You bet correctly! said madame Illusia<br />
By my calculation your hooves are going to help your family way more than your hands ever could.So rejoice, this was a good decision! <br />
As madame Illusia said that she started to transform his neck and head to better fit his body.<br />
Half of the audience was looking at how his neck was elongating while the other half was looking at the other side of his head where a black mane was growingdown the side of his neck.<br />
As his head started elongating and growing in width Paul looked towards madame Illusia and lowered his head in sign of gratitude.<br />
His head finished growing  moving his eyes on the side of his head and his nose at the end of his muzzle, which had been fitted with large blocky teeth, perfect for munching grass. <br />
As his transformation finished he was petted on his head by madame Illucia who noticed the white whiskers under his muzzle. <br />
Here is a beautiful draft horse, by my estimation, about 2 years old, does he have any relatives? <br />
As she said that his brother came up and told madame Illusia that he was his brother and that he was there to take him home to his family. <br />
As he said that, Paul placed his head in between his brothers hands showing madame Illusia that they knew each other. <br />
Very well, you will find a spare saddle in the back of the stage which you can take if you want.<br />
What do I do with that! asked his brother. <br />
Ride him, of course! You don&#39;t seriously want to walk besides him until you get home. Put those hooves of his to work before you strap him to a plow. <br />
The advice of madame Illusia was right as always and his brother did as he was told. He strapped the saddle to the back of his brother and took him out of the tent thanking madame Illusia in the process. <br />
Once they were outside Mark told Paul:<br />
OK brother, we have a long journey ahead of us, I trust that we will get there safely and much faster this time thanks to your new form. <br />
Paul whinnied in approval at his brothers plan. <br />
As Mark climbed on he told Paul while patting his side. <br />
Come on, I have to put you through your paces and get you comfortable with your hooves before you can help pull our parent&#39;s plough.</p>
