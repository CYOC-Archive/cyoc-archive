<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Tom the reporter continued to look for the facts to make his story factually based, the man who had helped fuel the flames that threatened to expose at least the existence of weres was presently into a hospital examining room. Dymixious was pleased with his success in offing a rogue were who was known to be a drug addict and a suspect in a Federal investigation. He figured that would surely protect the secret that weres existed and would serve the vigilante purposes that the &quot;Dragon clan&quot; had lived under since his father joined were society before he was born and later when his mother was killed by suspicious normals that had been hunting a rogue were of their own. Some might view it as a sort of cycle of violence, but Dymixious really wasn&#39;t in it for justice. He was more interested in making sure any rogue were out there would be fearful of going rogue. And while people might be &quot;agitated&quot; over Lionel Ulysses death, he figured that once it died down, he wouldn&#39;t have any trouble.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, he had his wife, Jade&#39;s pregnancy to be concerned with. Despite their were forms being based off of reptiles, werekomododragons gave birth to live young just as if they were mammals and made having some medical help important. Weres were generally immune to parasites and disease, but that didn&#39;t mean that they couldn&#39;t have trouble with them or face difficulty due to medical issues. Knowing that Moon Lake was a were sanctuary, he had figured to call in old favors to see that his wife was treated and they could return home and wait for the next rumors of a rogue were to show up. The one thing that was irking him for the moment was that the doctor he requested was taking his sweet time to see his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure things will be fine, dear,&quot; Jade said to him from the examination couch, &quot;they&#39;re probably busy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The appointment was preset and made with the local authorities,&quot; Dymixious answered. <br />
<br />
As he spoke, he heard the door open making him turn to the opening door. It revealed one male Japanese werefox and a human male. Both were dressed professionally, though the werefox looked a bit more formal than the human doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;While my mother is the local Skulk&#39;s leader and the chief executive officer of Tachibana Industries, she does not represent any legal authority,&quot; Tora Tachibana spoke clearly and with as much tact as he could muster, &quot;And we&#39;ve agreed to your request... provided certain terms are met, but you will also have to abide by the hospital&#39;s procedures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t request a second doctor for my wife,&quot; Dymixious borderline snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t getting one,&quot; Tora answered, &quot;While I did graduate medical school and am a doctor... My specialization is not in Obstetrics and Gynecology. I deal more with cranial and nervous system issues. I can do general practitioners work, and many of the hospital&#39;s staff DO perform those rounds, given your wife&#39;s state, it would be best that you see an actual OB/GYN.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor Harris Jones,&quot; the human male offered his hand, &quot;I assure you your wife is in good hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He isn&#39;t a were,&quot; Dymixious again borderline snarled, remembering that given what he&#39;d learned about Moon Lake&#39;s history that it was likely that local residents knew all about weres, be they normals or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT isn&#39;t an issue,&quot; Tora said firmly, &quot;the issue will be your wife&#39;s health and providing some measure of comfort for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tora remembered reading through the papers that his mother had offered him, noting the deal between the Dragon Clan and the Tachibana family, as well as the notes of suspicion that both his parents had regarding the Dragon Clan.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Doctor Jones is good, one of our two OB/GYNs on staff,&quot; Tora continued, &quot;your wife will be in good care while you both are here in Moon Lake for the foreseeable future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If YOU weren&#39;t going to see her... what did you do?&quot; Dymixious growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got you the appointment and cleared the red tape needed to avoid drawing unnecessary attention to yourself,&quot; Tora answered with as tactful a voice as he could muster at Dymixious&#39;s clearly aggressive attitude, &quot;Something I&#39;d think you&#39;d probably NEED at the moment. And fulfills the terms of my family&#39;s agreement to give you some assistance when needed.  We will also arrange for a cabin for the two of you until the present heat in Seattle dies down and people aren&#39;t agitated over your murdering a man in cold blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones said nothing as Dymixious&#39;s eyes narrowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You would let a rogue were who killed a man who fought for this country and more go free?&quot; Dymixious demanded, ignoring that he was essentially admitting to murdering Lionel Ulysses.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would let justice take its course,&quot; Tora answered.<br />
<br />
Beyond the fact that Lionel Ulysses had been caught transforming out of reflex and the fears that created, no member of the Tachibana family knew Jeff Decker or had any great interest in the hunt for Lionel Ulysses. The issue that would best work would be let justice prevail and see where it would go. America did, after all, have a legal death penalty and from what Tora had seen in the news, he had figured that the FBI would push for that punishment, making Dymixious&#39;s act of vigilantism unnecessary and thus doubly dangerous to were secrecy.<br />
<br />
&quot;And suppose he weasels out?&quot; Dymixious questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then things may have to change,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke up, &quot;I can understand wanting the secret of weres existence to be kept hidden, which is why I&#39;ve agreed against my better judgement NOT to report you... BUT at the same time, the attempt to capture Ulysses already had a great deal of tension in it. Killing him, especially in a way that leaves hints but not everything... is only going to make the problem around Ulysses&#39; arrest bigger. Without the prime suspect to speak on the issue, the media is likely to try and investigate further, just to make sense of the oddness in Ulysses&#39; arrest and for what reason he was murdered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll think it was a rival drug dealer, nothing more,&quot; Dymixious dismissed that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all of them,&quot; Tora countered, &quot;and even if its only one man looking... that could be one too many.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I covered my tracks,&quot; Dymixious growled, irritated that the people who were supposed to be at his service, were criticizing his actions. You didn&#39;t let bad guys go free.<br />
<br />
&quot;Until the heat dies down...&quot; Tora answered, &quot;You cannot be sure...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t?&quot; Jade asked, &quot;I mean... the treaty...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is NO treaty between my family and your father-in-law,&quot; Tora answered, &quot;what was signed was a loose agreement with an interest in preserving were secrecy and dealing with a troublemaker. And even if it was a &quot;treaty&quot; it is not binding here, where my mother&#39;s influence is no more than any other CEO&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tora decided not to mention the suspicions that made his mother had regarding the Dragon&#39;s Clan&#39;s actions. Things were tense, and the clan&#39;s actions had already played a role that was surely making all weres nervous. Those in the school or in the city government were bound to be in some nervous state on what to do.  Dr. Tora Tachibana could only hope that Dymixious would not cause any more trouble that would further raise the risks of weres being exposed.</p>
