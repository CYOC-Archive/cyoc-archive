<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arriving at Moon Lake Hospital was rather easy. While coming to the hospital from Target had meant coming from a different direction than the previous night or picking Rose up from the hospital in the morning, the town was small enough and their recent adventures around the town that he wasn&#39;t hopelessly lost, and it was about 2:20 as he pulled into the modest parking lot that was there. He glanced over to the collection of bags that were in the back seat of van and gave a bit of a sigh, in knowing that some of the things he and Rose would need going forward would be handled for the moment. While they hadn&#39;t had time to change into the clothing they&#39;d bought, they at least now had clothing that would fit their new forms. Trying things on had been a bit difficult, but it had given both Richard and Rose some idea on what their size was now.<br />
<br />
Richard&#39;s waist was at least two inches longer, his inseam almost three inches longer, and now needed an XL shirt to more easily contain his wider shoulders and more prominent muscle. Rose had had similar amounts of growth in her human form. Her waist was about the same, but her hips and butt were bigger than before, adding about four inches to her hip measurements. And from what Richard had seen when they&#39;d gotten to the checkout counter at target, Rose had grown from a 30 C to a 32 E cup chest. It was something that had shown just how much they&#39;d changed as a result of becoming weres. And now they were back at the hospital again, though this time with an appointment and more to get some confirmation as to whether or not Rose&#39;s entry into were society had also assured the creation of a new were in Rose&#39;s womb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything will be okay,&quot; Rose said to him as she noted that Richard hadn&#39;t moved after putting the van in park, &quot;but we will need to go in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard nodded and unbuckled his seat belt and slipping out of the van while Rose did the same. Once out, he hit one button on the key fab to lock it and then make his way in. Once he cleared the back of the van, Rose came to his side and quickly took his arm. A soft smile on her lips was enough for him to feel assured that she was feeling okay with things, though these things had also moved fast enough that the reason for the visit was unplanned and unexpected. He&#39;d become a were, Rose had been attacked, and then shortly after being released from the hospital, Rose became a were and might be pregnant, if she was in heat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Richard wondered, struggling to hide his worry and unease, &quot;I mean... you only just became a were this morning and... well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Regina said it&#39;s probably too soon to know for sure if I&#39;m pregnant,&quot; Rose answered as they made their way across the parking lot, &quot;but if I&#39;m in heat right now, they will be able to detect those related hormones. And if I am in heat... the stimulation you&#39;ve already given me may have been enough to trigger ovulation.&quot; Richard looked down as the automatic doors opened to let them in.  Rose noticed and wrapped one arm around his. &quot;And if that&#39;s happened... it&#39;s no problem. We&#39;ll get our store running soon, as you did have a building for the shop rented, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Richard nodded, &quot;Though... I had the expectation that Moon Lake as a college town would have its own low level sports team and people might want to access to the equipment for exercise. I didn&#39;t expect that most of the people here are weres, are in great natural shape, and might engage in out of season hunting for exercise...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You never know,&quot; Rose answered, &quot;people may still want the equipment... not to mention that we&#39;ve also sold things like basketball hoops, and that will be more recreational than fitness and so on. Besides, not everyone in Moon Lake is a were, from what we&#39;ve been told. So some may need the exercise equipment... and we&#39;ve both figured out ways to fix the mechanical problems with some of them. So we could add repair services to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then reached the front desk and the person looked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello... I&#39;m Rose Van Direstag, I have an appointment at 2:30 for some lab work,&quot; Rose then spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just lab work?&quot; the secretary spoke, blinking a bit, and in a way that made Rose think that the secretary recognized Rose from earlier. One small sniff told Rose that this secretary was a were...dog, she believed, and thus Rose also had to have the sense that the secretary likely knew Rose wasn&#39;t a normal human either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;d only just joined this morning, and didn&#39;t have werelion birth control pill,&quot; Rose said in a soft voice, &quot;but your obstetrician&#39;s appointment list is full for the day, so all I could get was the lab visit. To see if I&#39;m in heat.&quot;<br />
<br />
The secretary tapped on the keyboard a few moments, and nodded after a few moments, &quot;Okay, sorry about the delay. I was just checking things, and we do have your paperwork on file from this morning, though you will need to correct some of that on your way out so that our records will have you as a werelion. You can go on to the elevator, signs will direct you up to the floor the lab is in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, will you need a copay now, or...?&quot; Rose asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can handle that after you&#39;ve finished with the lab and you put in the your new were-status,&quot; the secretary answered, and then passed a paper to Rose, &quot;this should be your lab order. Just present it to the doctor or nurse when they come to check on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
They slowly made their way in and followed the directions into the rest of the hospital. It had basic signs that gave directions to areas of the hospital, and Richard was able to follow them with some amazement. The basic clinic and ER facilities were on the first floor. Going up the successive floors there were wards that dealt with heart and lung issues, major surgery areas, basic neurological issues, along with full reproductive health services, including wards for newborns and giving birth. Rose also knew there was the obvious ICU and observation ward, which showed just how &quot;big&quot; the Moon Lake hospital was. For the moment, the pair of them were to head to the lab and they followed the signs that lead them there.<br />
<br />
They rode up to the floor that the lab was supposed to be on and passed some of the other areas that were on that floor, including a small waiting room. Eventually they came to a lone door that had a plastic sign that read &quot;Lab&quot; beside it. They approached the doorway, though also found that the area where the patients would have access to was rather small in some respects, and much of the rest of the room was spaced out more for the lab&#39;s doctors and technicians to work, though from the angle they had, neither Richard nor Rose could see much inside it. As they got to the door, they noticed a small buzzer that was just underneath the sign that read: Lab. Rose pressed it with one free hand and then waited with Richard just outside the door, unsure as to where they were to go or where to wait.<br />
<br />
A few moments after pressing the button, a large female figure moved into the doorway from inside the lab. She carried the scent of a werehorse, though carried a fairly noticeable round middle. She wasn&#39;t close to giving birth, but had to be at least somewhere in the second trimester from what Rose could tell. The werehorse was in her human form and looked carefully between the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I ask who is here to see the lab?&quot; the werehorse asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be me,&quot; Rose spoke as she presented the lab order that the secretary at the front desk had given her, &quot;I&#39;m Rose Van Direstag. I&#39;d scheduled an appointment with the help of Regina Talbot earlier on account of just becoming a were this morning and not having any werelion birth control pills. I&#39;d kind of need to know if I&#39;m in heat or not right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The werehorse nodded and took the lab order and looked it order, &quot;I see. Well, if you only just became a were this morning... after release from the ER and observation ward, we can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re pregnant now and thus the blood tests won&#39;t work. However, we can tell if you&#39;re in heat. That test will require a urine sample. Have you gone to the bathroom recently?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not recently,&quot; Rose said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor...&quot; Richard began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tucker, Doctor Kathy Tucker,&quot; the werehorse answered, &quot;I run the lab here. And don&#39;t worry, the test is accurate, as if a new were goes into heat with their first transformation, the hormones associated with heat will be present and detectable. Actual pregnancy won&#39;t be detectable for a day or so, or more... but given were fertility being high, if your wife is in heat, pregnancy is likely. Though this will only require your wife, so if you could go over to the waiting room...&quot;  Kathy then paused to point back to the waiting room. &quot;And things shouldn&#39;t be too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I shouldn&#39;t be too long... and I could stand to go...&quot; Rose commented to Richard and after a moment she added, &quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard sighed and nodded. He moved off toward the waiting area that Doctor Tucker had directed him to while he overheard some of the instructions given to Rose. A part of him couldn&#39;t help but worry. He could accept being a father again, and he&#39;d do his best, but that still didn&#39;t ease the worries over whether or not he should have done more to hold Rose back. Even if she was willing to become his werelioness and could accept becoming a new mother again, that didn&#39;t mean that that was the plan, there would still be all sorts of other things to consider that worried in the back of his mind. He made his way back that waiting area, and while they had a television on there, Richard paid little attention to it. He sat down and waited quietly and with his mind racing a million miles a minute. He barely noticed when Rose approached a few moments later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Richard?&quot; Rose called to him, and Richard only flinched when her hand passed in front of his eyes.<br />
<br />
He then looked up to see her standing there with a small smile as she moved around to sit by him<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you...&quot; Richard asked, his voice falling off as he asked the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know yet,&quot; Rose answered, &quot;I had to give a urine sample... I while I did have pee... it&#39;ll still take their equipment a few moments to analyze it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry if I rushed anything on you,&quot; Richard managed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Rose assured him and rubbing one knee with her right hand, &quot;if anything, I got overly curious and interested in the new you. And if I were to become a were... I&#39;d prefer it to be the man I married. And if I&#39;m in heat and thus likely pregnant, then so be it. We&#39;ll love the baby, Frank, Rob, and Rachel will love the baby, and we&#39;ll get by. Just as we always have... and our cub will also get the support of our pride in terms of attention and help. So you have nothing to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard relaxed a little and the two of them sat together, with eventually Rose taking his hand. After about ten minutes or so, Kathy then approached from the hallway and looked to them. They heard the footsteps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Richard and Rose asked together, in near perfect unison in a voice that sounded a mixture of eager and nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, based on what we can determine, Mrs. Van Direstag,&quot; Doctor Tucker spoke, &quot;You are indeed in heat. And if you were active for as long as you say you were after your transformation was completed... it is probable that you are pregnant. Though that can&#39;t be confirmed for a day or two. I would suggest you schedule an appointment with Doctor Harris Jones in a few days. By then he can request and order the pregnancy tests that will confirm it and he can then explain some of the finer details regarding what you may expect as a pregnant were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose was silent and only felt her hands drift to her stomach and womb area.</p>
