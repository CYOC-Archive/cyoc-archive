<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the end, it was decided that the serum would be tested throughout two phases.<br />
<br />
The first test was done by doctor Abrams. She listened to Justin&#39;s theories, going over the formula together, and used her equipment to simulate the effects of the serum. They weren&#39;t going to move on to live testing unless they were absolutely certain the formula would work. It would be both dangerous and irresponsible otherwise.<br />
<br />
It took about an hour before the first phase was done. Justin&#39;s work passed with flying colors, and he was congratulated by doctor Abrams. The older woman was very impressed with what he&#39;d created. Her own subordinates hadn&#39;t come close to creating a drug like his. She jokingly offered him a position as her assistant, but his mom had quickly nipped that idea in the bud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Then we can now move on to the next experiment.&quot; Margaret declared, once everything was in order.<br />
<br />
Doctor Abrams nodded. &quot;As luck would have it, there&#39;s already a candidate available. She should be arriving soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how quickly can you reproduce the serums?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm. The ingredients aren&#39;t too difficult to acquire. In fact, we still have plenty stockpiled here in the lab.&quot; The scientist fiddled with her glasses, looking down at a clipboard. &quot;I reckon we can start synthesizing more growth formula either tomorrow or the day after. Once we are certain the first batch is of good quality, we can expand the production process and deliver larger batches in about a week&#39;s worth of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
That soon? Justin was somewhat confused by how fast they were going. Didn&#39;t his mom say that they would prepare a patent first?<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, will that colonel Cooper guy be okay with this? You didn&#39;t inform him about the serums yet.&quot; He pointed out.<br />
<br />
Margaret shared a knowing look with the doctor. &quot;Colonel Cooper is the type of man who wants to see results first. If we present him the formula as it is now, he&#39;ll be dismissive or call our efforts a waste of time. No. We&#39;ll inform him later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
His mom and doctor Abrams then began discussing other matters that Justin couldn&#39;t quite hear so well. They were keeping their voices down on purpose, which was rather suspicious. Did they have some ulterior motive? Or a plan that they didn&#39;t want to involve him in?<br />
<br />
Justin was curious, but didn&#39;t plan on sticking his nose into his mom&#39;s business. It could have been about some army stuff for all he knew. He didn&#39;t need to know all of that, anyway.<br />
<br />
Several minutes passed before Tiffany entered the laboratory, followed by a young woman in soldier fatigues. She was about the same age as Tiffany, but had red hair and green eyes. The soldier was quite tall, though. She basically towered over everyone in the room-- even his mom. And Margaret was six feet tall, which meant that this woman was one of the tallest girls that Justin had ever seen.<br />
<br />
Her outfit consisted of a green shirt and khaki pants with numerous pockets. The former had short sleeves, exposing surprisingly muscular arms and wide shoulders. All in all, she looked more buff than he had expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Private Waters reporting for duty, ma&#39;am.&quot; Said the tall woman, snapping to attention.<br />
&quot;At ease.&quot; Responded Margaret. &quot;Nikki Waters, correct?&quot;<br />
She nodded. &quot;Yes. I came as soon as the doctor called for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nikki here is a volunteer for the soldier enhancement program. She was stationed here a while ago, and passed all of our physical psychological tests.&quot; Doctor Abrams clarified for Justin&#39;s sake. She was already moving towards the table where he&#39;d deposited the vials of growth serum. &quot;Seeing as we needed someone to test the formula on, I thought it was appropriate for her to be the first subject. After all, Nikki here is a bodybuilder. She&#39;s even participated in some of the army bodybuilding contests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you have been informed of the dangers and regulations? Once you are exposed to the enhancement drug, you will be required to remain on-site at all times.&quot; Margaret said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand, ma&#39;am. I&#39;m willing to do my part.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s also signed all of the necessary documents.&quot; Tiffany added. &quot;That includes several NDA&#39;s and other forms. We&#39;re all set when it comes to the administrative side of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin&#39;s mom smiled, excitement dancing in her eyes. &quot;Excellent. Looks like we&#39;ll get to see your invention in action, son. Doctor Abrams?&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin watched as the doctor retrieved a vial filled with growth serum. It was the blue variant, meaning that Nikki would experience moderate muscle gain and strength increase. That made sense; it was the lowest dosage available, and would allow them to measure the impact of the growth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t need to be injected with this, right?&quot; Asked the red-haired private. She eyed the concoction warily. &quot;I&#39;m not good with needles, doc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abrams rolled her eyes. &quot;Luckily for you, it&#39;s designed to be consumed orally. Now be a good girl and drink your medicine. You&#39;ll get a lollipop afterward.&quot;<br />
<br />
The scientist&#39;s sarcasm elicited smiles and laughter from Justin and Tifanny. Nikki, on the other hand, muttered something incomprehensible before accepting the vial. She closed her eyes and drank it all up in one go.<br />
<br />
Everyone waited with bated breath for what came next. Justin knew that his serum was incredibly potent, and the changes should occur rapidly instead of gradually appearing over time. He was proven right when Nikki suddenly began growing muscle out of nowhere!<br />
<br />
Her whole frame filled out with more mass, which was proportionally distributed over her body. The young woman&#39;s arm bulked up, with biceps and triceps swelling larger. The lumps of sinew gained much definition in the process. Intricate lines separating the individual muscles grew deeper. Nikki&#39;s arms gained several pounds of beef each, as her biceps passed the 15 inch mark, with a prominent vein snaking across each arm. Even her forearms became meatier.<br />
<br />
Capped deltoids connected those strong-looking arms to her broadening torso. Her shoulders were getting wider. Impressive striations marked her round delts, and both her neck muscles and traps became more prominent. The growth also affected her back, which Justin saw less of due to where he stood, but nevertheless understood due to how her lateral muscles began flaring out. Sinews were torn down, repaired and made sturdier, before doing it all over again. This way, Nikki&#39;s back turned into an artwork of muscular development.<br />
<br />
The soldier&#39;s legs were pumped bigger and bigger, as her thighs and calves inflated. Defined quads became shapely, teardrop-looking beef that strained the seams of her pants. It didn&#39;t take long before her thighs had gained maybe a quarter of their original size in width. Even the woman&#39;s glutes were enhanced by the serum. The muscle stored within her butt cheeks grew bigger, denser, and rounder. Hence why Nikki&#39;s behind looked like she was quite the curvaceous gal.<br />
<br />
Seeing as her fatigues were becoming rather tight, it didn&#39;t surprise Justin that Nikki had her abs on display. The rock-hard muscles were visible through the thin green fabric. Their outline showcased an impeccable detail of muscularity; six bricks of finely exercised sinew. The same transformation affected her obliques as they bulged across her sides.<br />
<br />
Up above, her average-sized breasts jutted outwards because of her pectoral development. The twin slabs of pure muscle packed on some serious size, visible between her neck and breasts, yet somehow she didn&#39;t lose any fat like she would during workouts. If anything, it seemed that her boobs were perfectly preserved. And due to her burgeoning chest muscles, they looked bigger than before!<br />
<br />
The growth began slowing down, though. Which Justin rationalized as normal since she&#39;d drank the blue formula.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, by the time it was over, Nikki had grown increasingly more muscular. Her emerald green eyes widened in surprise as she looked down at herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! This is something else than those supplements they sell in the gym!&quot; She exclaimed, fingers prodding at the pumped muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;This makes the gym irrelevant, if you ask me.&quot; Tiffany remarked. The blonde secretary was also amazed by what she saw. They all were, to be perfectly honest.<br />
Justin was suddenly enveloped in a tight hug, as his fit mother swarmed him with her own sizeable bulk.<br />
<br />
&quot;It worked! I knew you would do great things, dear. But this takes the cake!&quot; Laughed Margaret joyfully. She ruffled his hair, more proud than he had ever seen her before. &quot;Your formula works!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki grinned. &quot;Heh. No kidding! I feel awesome, too. Like I could go for another workout and then some more. If these muscles are as strong as they look, then I can probably break every previous record of mine in the gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which we will be evaluating anyway.&quot; Doctor Abrams interjected sternly. Her words tempered Nikki&#39;s enthusiasm, but didn&#39;t dampen her spirits. &quot;We need to know how much stronger you&#39;ve gotten, in order to gather precise data on the blue serum&#39;s potential.&quot;<br />
<br />
That sounded good to Nikki, if the soldier&#39;s flexing was any indication. Justin watched attentively as the red-haired woman curled her arms, and showed off two biceps that belonged to a female bodybuilder. As in, a bodybuilder that dedicated herself to the craft. Those guns were seriously defined, with proud peaks and decent vascularity.<br />
<br />
Justin tried to be subtle as his heart sped up a little. He hadn&#39;t expected to react like this to a woman with big muscles, but apparently he was attracted to Nikki&#39;s kind. A surprise, but not an unpleasant one, he supposed. Might make things a bit awkward around his toned mom, though.<br />
<br />
He was grateful for the distraction that doctor Abrams provided as she went into detail about how they would continue from here on out.</p>
