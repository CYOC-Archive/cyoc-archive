<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Screw it. One day off wasn&#39;t going to cost Joanna her job - and if she got even an hour of excitement out of this, it&#39;d be worthwhile. Breaking out her phone, she quickly texted her boss, delivering a pretty straightforward &#39;feeling sick&#39; excuse as she kept walking home. She didn&#39;t even bother to wait for a reply before stuffing the phone away, her gaze alternating between the sidewalk ahead and the enigmatic vial. <br />
<br />
It was a short walk back to her apartment, allowing her to easily slip back into the privacy of her home. As soon as she had dropped off her purse, locked the door, and slipped off her shoes, she was leaning on the kitchen counter, staring at the vial. All the movement of walking around and exposure to the morning sun hadn&#39;t changed its surface; it was still blacker than black, the only interruption a white shimmer as it reflected the light from her overhead lamps. So curious.<br />
<br />
After a few moments debating, she decied the best thing to do was uncork the stuff and see what happened. An easy enough task, the cork popping off and landing on the counter nearby. Without that bit of material holding it back, she could finally smell the stuff. It was... well, truth be told, she didn&#39;t have a basis for comparison. The only word she could conjure up to describe it was alien... and, perhaps, pleasant. The aroma wafting up to her nostrils, strange as it might have been, was hardly offensive to her senses.<br />
<br />
Wondering about its properties, Joanna quickly grabbed a paper plate, setting it on the counter before tipping the vial to try and pour the contents onto the plate. She could hear what sounded like liquid moving around, and yet... nothing. No visible movement. Peering inside, the top of the black mass was smooth as the rest of it. Huh. She grabbed a toothpick, poking the surface, and found it offered no give. Any attempt to apply pressure or scrape the surface merely damaged the toothpick.<br />
<br />
Something hardened in there, she wondered? The idea was quickly discarded, however. Despite what her eyes were seeing, something about the way the weight shifted as she moved it in her hand... it was fluidic. She wondred what the texture must be like - growing bold, she pressed her pinky finger in, just barely managing to squeeze the tip through the bottleneck to touch the material.<br />
<br />
This time, the reaction was immediate. Just as her finger was nearing the black material, it seemed to jump towards her, sticking to her skin. She shivered as an electric shock traveled up her arm, reflexively pulling her finger back with an unbroken trail of the material following. Setting the vial down, she quickly grabbed a paper towel to try and break the drooping trail, only to find that it resisted every effort to break the connection.<br />
<br />
What&#39;s more, her eyes grew wide as she realized that it was still moving, and not in the direction that it should have. In defiance of gravity, it was traveling up her finger, slowly but surely covering the tip and her fingernail. No matter what random kitchen implement she grabbed, nothing could seem to scrape it off; the black ichor merely continued its advance up her skin.<br />
<br />
She should have been scared, at this point, but instead of fear she felt an increased curiousity. The way it oozed, moving up her finger to slowly advance over her hand... it was almost like watching muscles in action. Somehting... alive, climbing up her body. Cool to the touch, with a slimy texture she couldn&#39;t quite compare to anything she&#39;d felt before, but it hardly made her feel threatened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you... alive?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her question seemed to cause the slime to advance its pace slightly, covering up the rest of her hand at an accelerated rate. Cautiously she touched her other hand against the trail of slime oozing from the vial up to her body, and quickly the slime began to spread over this part of her as well. The vial had been emptied by now, but still more of the material slid out, now crawling up her arms.<br />
<br />
It was consuming her... no. This... spark of life, whatever it was, she didn&#39;t sense any hostility. It was curious, as interested in her as she was in it. Friendly, even. The way the ooze massaged her skin reminded her of a cat showing affection, rubbing itself against her. Her anxious expression shifted into a smile as it climbed to her shoulders, dissolving her clothing as it traveled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... feel nice.&quot; She brought her arms across her chest, hugging herself, and the response was rapid. Clothing and undergarments were eaten away as the creature spread itself over her torso, its pace having quicked greatly. She grinned, relishing the way it caressed every part of her that it spread to. An excited heat filled her core as it spread to the sensitive flesh of her chest, conforming perfectly to her curves. <br />
<br />
The being cascaded itself rapidly down her legs, up her neck, even twisting through her face and hair. She closed her eyes so that it could cover her eyelids, reopening them to find that the whole of her body had been encased. In her most private region, she sensed a quivering, a shaking of the slime - it was asking permission, she realized to enter into her body. <br />
<br />
Her answer came instantly. &quot;Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
It had felt blissful to be covered by the creature - but when it dove into her moistened slit, she thought she might genuinely die of happiness. It advanced into her rapidly, bringing with it pure joy at every touch, unrivaled excitement from every little cell that was covered. She fell to her knees, hugging herself and the creature as moans left her mouth. The excitement spread to the being that had encased her, taken as a sign to begin something well beyond any pleasure she&#39;d ever felt.<br />
<br />
Before, it had covered her skin, but now... now she could feel it bleding with that same flesh. It diffused itself into her being, bonding with her body as it spread internally. The line between Joanna and the entity was vanishing, and she couldn&#39;t have been more excited. Its counciousness touched hers - something basic, not stupid or undeveloped, but... straight forward. It touched her mind not with words, but with feelings, communicating in pure emotion its desire: to be part of her, bringing her joy.<br />
<br />
She screamed, begging for it to continue. Bones, skin, muscle, everything began to break down, becoming nothing more than an extension of the slime. Every bit of her that became joined with the entity seemed to send a tingle through her increasingly amorphous form, the arousal of flesh becoming a sense of bliss that permeated her entire existence. Her body was melting down, and she couldn&#39;t throw herself into the puddle fast enough. The last part to go was her very mind, disappearing into a misama with the entity&#39;s.<br />
<br />
It was hard to judge how long she remained there, now nothing more than a black puddle of liquid joy. The passage of time became meaningless in her endlessly happy state. She only became aware of such things once more as the puddle suddenly rocketed upwards, taking on a form rapidly. Human, arms, legs, torso, a head that popped out, but entirely black and resplendently shining. <br />
<br />
She ran a hand through her slimy hair, adoring the feeling of a body that wasn&#39;t some combination of countless complex organs. Just a single being, herself, able to bend and twist and shape itself into anything. She was living bliss, affection in a pure form, and her soul surged with a desire to share what she was. This contentness, this feeling of being so joyful, so free of all the awful constraints of the human body - it demanded to be spread. The only question was where she would begin.</p>
