<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen took a breath and prepared to give Kyle a piece of her mind, but Kyle had already hung up. She tossed the <br />
phone on the bed, then fell back on it herself with a frustrated groan.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a jackass!&quot; she said out loud. &quot;Who says that sort of thing? Creeper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, a lingering paranoia grew in her mind. She thought back to Kyle getting pants'd at school and <br />
remembered the intense looks of anger and humiliation he'd thrown her way as she and her friends had walked <br />
away laughing. <br />
<br />
The transform or dare story she'd heard her friends tell her back at junior high summer camp started to replay <br />
in her head. It couldn't be true. <br />
<br />
Could it?<br />
<br />
Just to reassure herself, she rolled off the bed and went over to the vanity mirror in her bedroom. Looking <br />
her reflection in the eyes with an overly compensatory smirk, she stuck her tongue out at herself. Her tongue <br />
was still a normal shade of reddish pink, in its usual shape, with ordinary taste buds. She poked it <br />
experimentally with her finger, and felt the normal sensation of a soft, damp tongue.<br />
<br />
Feeling silly, she closed her mouth and began to gather up her things and get ready for school.<br />
<br />
But then, her tongue began to feel a bit...weird.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, she felt a twinge at the base of her jaw. It quickly intensified to a wave of tics and rolling <br />
muscle spasms in her neck muscles and mouth, and then it began to spread.<br />
<br />
She rushed to the mirror, feeling her tongue start to stiffen in her mouth as the discomfort advanced to her <br />
jaw and throat. She could see a visible writhing movement under the delicate skin of her neck. Remembering <br />
Kyle's words, she opened her mouth.<br />
<br />
Inside, her tongue was visibly swelling. Before her eyes, its shape grew more cylindrical and its taste buds <br />
morphed into wrinkly, vein-rippled flesh.<br />
<br />
She watched, horrified, as a hole appeared in the tip of her tongue and the ridge of a glans formed, sloping <br />
back from it. It was quickly enveloped by the loose rolls of a thickening foreskin. The organ, already more <br />
penis than tongue, grew longer by the instant.<br />
<br />
Jen tried to scream but found no sound emerged from her windpipe. Nor air, for that matter - in or out. The <br />
instinctual panic of suffocation began to overtake her, until she realized that she wasn't actually <br />
suffocating even though she wasn't breathing. The rest of her body's transformation immediately regained her <br />
attention.<br />
<br />
The muscle tics advanced downward as Jennifer's tongue-cock grew steadily in her mouth. Her pert breasts, <br />
smallish but well-shaped, began to tingle. Jen instinctively cupped them to stop what was happening to her, <br />
but to no avail.<br />
<br />
The pinching of her bra straps made her realize they were growing. In a matter of seconds, the supportive <br />
parts began to dig into her skin. Jen raced for relief, nearly tearing her shirt to get it off over her head. <br />
She almost had to rip her bra straps apart to undo the strained fasteners to keep them from drawing blood.<br />
<br />
In the mirror, she saw her boobs, already twice as large as they were when she'd dressed, visibly expanding. <br />
Her tits grew fuller and wider by the instant. The deep pink circles of her areolae enlarged accordingly, <br />
puffing outward as her nipples grew. It didn't stop until each of her breasts was as large as a ripe <br />
cantaloupe. Thankfully, at least, Jen noted, her boobs retained a feminine teardrop shape.<br />
<br />
In no more than one minute in all, Jen's body had become exactly as Kyle had dictated. As the sensation of <br />
change subsided, Jen found herself staring at herself in the mirror, hands trembling. A teardrop coursed down <br />
her cheek.<br />
<br />
Several of the final twelve inches in length of her newly-formed cock still stuck out from Jen's mouth. She <br />
grabbed it to shove it back in, hoping that might make it all go away somehow.<br />
<br />
As her fingers seized the cock, she was unprepared for the sensation it gave her. The touch of her girlish <br />
fingers on the new dick-flesh sent a wave of pleasure straight down its length, on through her mouth, throat <br />
and chest, then spread out as lovely tingles across her body as her pleasure center registered the act for the <br />
first time. Her tongue-cock twitched involuntarily in her grip, and her boobs registered a very nice, electric <br />
feeling. <br />
<br />
Her dick hardened ever so slightly. It invited more.<br />
<br />
But that was all too much for Jen for the moment. She snapped out of her momentary shock, shying away from <br />
making -that- happen again.<br />
<br />
She sat down on the floor to think, overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
She wasn't wearing a shirt, none of her bras could possibly contain her new boobs, she apparently couldn't <br />
breathe -- didn't need to breathe -- and her tongue was now a foot-long cock. How the hell was she going to <br />
deal with this?<br />
<br />
Reining in her focus somehow, she tested her new anatomy and found her mouth still had a good deal of <br />
articulation. Thankfully, her cock's resting inside her mouth didn't cause the same reaction as touching it <br />
with her fingers had, and she found she felt somewhat normal when her new penis was tucked away inside. <br />
<br />
As Kyle specified, her cock filled her entire mouth, but something that had happened to her throat during the <br />
transformation made it -just- able to permit the whole length to retract inside her mouth when it was soft. It <br />
felt not much differently than her tongue had in its previous form.<br />
<br />
She briefly considered the possibility of being able to suck herself -- Kyle had been explicit about that -- <br />
but when the small arousal that thought created caused her cock to press against the insides of her lips, she <br />
decided not to test that theory out lest she become unable to close her mouth.<br />
<br />
After additional concentration, Jen discovered she could still make normal sounds, though it was through <br />
entirely different means than before. She didn't even pretend to understand how she was doing it, but it was a <br />
great relief to her that it was happening. Learning this trick led to the realization that she had somehow not <br />
lost the ability to talk, unlikely as that was with a penis for a tongue. Apparently whatever twisted magic or <br />
curse was behind &quot;transform or dare,&quot; it was merciful enough to make some accommodation.<br />
<br />
It took much more concentration than she was accustomed to, but before long she was able to speak normally <br />
again.<br />
<br />
Clothes were still a problem. Going through everything in her drawer, she found everything either didn't fit <br />
and/or looked comically scandalous. She rummaged through her closet until she found what had been a baggy <br />
sweater that she hoped would downplay her new endowments. To her dismay, her boobs now filled the garment out, <br />
but at least she could wear it comfortably.<br />
<br />
Just then, there was a knock on the door. Her mom peeked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, are you going to school today? We're going to be late,&quot; her mom said.<br />
<br />
Jen went pale, feeling caught, waiting for her mom to react. However, her mom seemed not to notice any of <br />
Jen's new additions.<br />
<br />
Then Jen remembered Kyle had said that everyone would treat it as normal. Her tension subsided a notch, but <br />
not much. Jen decided to...</p>
