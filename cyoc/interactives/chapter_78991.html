<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a Month in the wilderness you , Hannahona and Jimmy live awkwardly as racoons.<br />
One day they both decide to gather some berries for the week.<br />
Eating fish, your mind slowly drifting between racoon and human thoughts, you begin to miss your freind, and <br />
jimmy, and go running after them.<br />
While going through pine tree pass you notice a weird base camp located in the middle of the forest, a woman, <br />
eating a tub of berries is sitting in the front room as if waiting for something. You can see through the <br />
window. The small cabin had a radio signal transmiter attatched, and through the other window you see army men <br />
talking.<br />
On the buildings side there is an abbreviation: A.C.E.S. You had no idea.<br />
Then finally, you see jimmy climbing a tree.<br />
&quot;Jimmy&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
&quot;Where's Hannahona? [Your lady friend]<br />
Jimmy responds questioningly &quot;I can't remember, she left in the trees to talk to some other coons&quot;<br />
You, and Jimmy leave:but a thought comes to make you come back:<br />
How could that lady in the window be eating berries and not transform like you?<br />
Further investigation was needed. <br />
After two hours of pond fishing  Hannahona returns.<br />
&quot;Hey we were looking for you, how was the meeting?&quot;<br />
&quot;It was fine, no complaints the forest is dandy&quot;<br />
&quot;Dandy? that's a new one haven't heard you say that before.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmm...weird.&quot;<br />
You were already putting two and two together: your racoon freind here might not be what she seems, and on to <br />
her game, you spy on her when she, in the middle of the night, ran into that part of the woods again.<br />
A.C.E.S...What did it mean?<br />
You follow han into the river and watch her...<br />
get a midnight snack.<br />
You felt pretty dumb.<br />
After an hour of watching her eat, and go back to the nest you decide to be brave and go into A.C.E.S.<br />
you dig a hole, and find you way under the floor boards.<br />
Listening<br />
...Nothing for an hour till sunrise then...<br />
&quot;General sir, good morning&quot;<br />
&quot;Morning jules how was sleep?&quot;<br />
Blah blah blah...<br />
&quot;How's the family?&quot;<br />
&quot;oh...we just lost my second cousin&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah missing for a week with jimmy&quot;<br />
That choked you up hard...Jules...you vaguely remember the name. Tennis comes to mind.<br />
Tennis team!<br />
You were on the tennis team with jules!<br />
After another hour of sobbing jules says:<br />
&quot;Here's the Report for this week. I need to lay down.&quot;<br />
Looking through the cracks of the floor board you see &quot;Animal Cause/Effect scenario&quot; A.C.E.S!<br />
This is an animal experiment center! That's why it was gated.<br />
You dashed right away to hannahona and Jimmy.<br />
&quot;Hannahona! Hannahona!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes My mate?&quot;<br />
&quot;There's a disturbance in the forest, people are testing on animals, I saw in a report there was shock <br />
therapy, and drugging, and all kinds of weird things. That's why this is a gated forest we're in an animal <br />
experiment test site!&quot;<br />
&quot;No, My mate, this is not so, there's something I've forgotten to tell you about me&quot;<br />
&quot;What? Why would we keep secrets, I thought we were engaged&quot;<br />
&quot;No, Let me tell you a story. There was once a little Indian girl who lived in this forest not to long ago, <br />
she was fond of her family, and lived on a reservation for the utes tribe. She loved the forest, and nature. <br />
Listen, I try and act like you, but I'm not like you.&quot;<br />
&quot;...Is that all?&quot;<br />
Jimmy said, confused and lightheaded.<br />
&quot;O.K let me put it this way: I turned you into...A racoon.&quot;<br />
You and Jimmy looked shocked.<br />
&quot;...Why?! I mean, I know I kinda wanted to, but it wasn't your choice to make! Nor was it yours to make to <br />
poor Jimmy! I still have trouble you know. I've been starting to miss my old life, and my freinds, and my Job, <br />
and my Family. This was a hard decision! I can't believe you would do this! I thought we had a connection!&quot;<br />
&quot;we did! We had a connection it's just...when I saw your face I had to do something! So...I cursed those <br />
berries. In my tribe you see: I was the local shaman, and it was a pretty new thing because our Native rights <br />
officer had introduced me to it, and it was from africa, and I was so excited to practice my magic <br />
then...things got bad.<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot;-Jimmy<br />
&quot;Well as you may know the ute's have had a long history with torture, and I was so angry, I mean infuriated, <br />
really mad at the white man In a bad point of my life. You have to understand: My people have suffered trough <br />
so much, and now with the obesity epidemic...&quot;<br />
Hannahona looked desperately.<br />
&quot;Sigh...I cast a circle, I saw the delivery men who were providing us food, and I prayed to the totems of the <br />
forest to change them into a form where they no longer could harm my people. Then, I changed with them, and I <br />
saw you&quot;<br />
Jimmy was angered:<br />
&quot;Don't make it sound so innocent you pagan neanderthal. You did witch craft, you were a witch, I don't care if <br />
it was African or American magic you used the devil, and that's that. Don't try and spice it up with yer talk <br />
on all this &quot;My people&quot; nonsense. You did something ute: tortured them drivers, and then used voodoo and look <br />
where it gotcha: They just got new drivers! You have done nothing For &quot;Your people&quot;<br />
Hannahona was in awe.<br />
You were in awe: Jimmy, being a catholic Apache Native you assumed had the right to speak in such a manner.<br />
<br />
Han was down, and limp.<br />
&quot;Your words can hurt you know&quot;<br />
&quot;The truth hurts: I miss my mom and dad.&quot;<br />
You see Han, and Jimmy both saddened.<br />
Hannahona:&quot;Jimmy...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you think it's... we're both, you know, Indians&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorta...&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you recall a story from the anastazi, or ancient enemy, about an enslaved race, and a freedom fighter from <br />
great grandfather to set them free?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, but do recall a man named mosses, and a man nammed pharoah.&quot;<br />
&quot;What I'm saying is maybe, I'm...pharoah, and I just need Jesus right now.&quot;<br />
You have no current Idea what to say right now.<br />
&quot;No, you aren't. Your just paul before he was paul. We all need Jesus&quot;<br />
You finally get to a break point.<br />
&quot;Hey, do you guys ever wonder why we like nature so much anyways?&quot;<br />
Hannahona:&quot;What!? I love nature! It is our bond. We are bound to it! we are one with the wind and it's <br />
sediment&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm just saying, I thought I was into it but really...I just wanna go back to my little construction <br />
outlines, and maybe get a cool chick in my life. Jimmy's been trying to get me to go to church and I was <br />
thinkin' maybe I might try it.&quot;<br />
Hannahona:&quot; Huh. 'get a cool chick in my life' Typical white man.&quot;<br />
&quot;just sayin&quot;<br />
&quot;O.K. I guess I can change you guys back if I have the right things.&quot;</p>
