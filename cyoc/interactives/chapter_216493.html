<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John looked at his cousin’s dog collar stash with mix of intrigue and worry.  On one hand, he was blown away by the wide array of choices, each of which Riley was super familiar with.  But on the other hand… John wasn’t as accustomed to using the medallion as the rest of the family, let alone used to turning into something that wasn’t human.  <br />
<br />
Riley could definitely read the look of concern of his cousin’s face.<br />
<br />
“Tell you what John, most of the collars I own come with a spare.  We can both transform into dogs together, that way you won’t be alone in your first experience!”<br />
<br />
John pondered this… it would be pretty great to have someone experience help ease his concerns.<br />
<br />
“Ok Riley, let’s be dogs together!”<br />
<br />
“Yes!!!  I promise you’ll love this cuz! Ok, any preference on the breed now?”<br />
<br />
John rubbed his neck, “Well um, I kinda like the look of those pointy eared guard dogs.  You know, the kind see on TV?”<br />
<br />
Riley eagerly nodded. “Oooo I get you! A Doberman pincher!  Man I love turning into that one. Haha even my dad likes it.  Makes the neighbors think he’s a real badass for having such a cool guard dog.”<br />
<br />
Riley ruffled through his bag and pulled out two identical collars.  They were wine red and covered in silver studs.<br />
<br />
“Here you go, just clasp it on.  Oh and you might want to take off your clothes now.  You should be able to shake em’ off as a dog too but I’d recommend against it since it’s not the most pleasant feeling to have polyester rub up against your coat.”<br />
<br />
John nodded and began take off his clothes until he was left in just his boxers briefs.  He was surprised that Riley was already full-on nude before he even finished taking off his socks! <br />
<br />
“Dude we’re turning into doberman pinchers, not ‘boxers’, come one! Lose the undies.” <br />
<br />
John blushed as he looked over at Riley.  The whole family had seen him naked after he changed back earlier.  It had made sense why he wasn’t initially so quick to cover up… damn- cousin Riley was HUNG.  John blushed as he tried not to let his eyes linger for too long on what had to be a soft 7-incher between his cousin’s legs.  Maybe that’s one of the reason cousin William seems so antsy around Riley.  Envy over his younger brother’s junk perhaps? <br />
<br />
“Hello? John? Haha you still with me cuz?”  Riley laughed while clasping his own collar.  <br />
<br />
“Huh? Oh- yeah.  Just nervous is all.” John replied sliding his boxers down his legs.  He was slightly below average in the crotch department but it seemed like Riley thankfully didn’t make a fuss about it.<br />
<br />
“Nice!  Here’s yours.”<br />
John took the collar from Riley’s hand and clasped it on.  They both reached for the medallion together-<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
“Oh wow!” Robert exclaimed petting the two impressive looking canines that had just ran into the living room.  “These two are quite handsome dogs!  Must be John and Riley.” <br />
<br />
Doug began to clear his throat, “Yeah not to brag or anything but I actually got those collars off a higher up coworker of mine.” He boasted. “He recently got new collars for his stud guard dogs so I asked him for the old ones before he tossed them out.  I’ll admit, I get a kick walking Riley around the neighborhood.  A big scary dog is quite the status symbol around our little town.” <br />
<br />
“I can see why! Man, walking around with two of them would just double the street cred’ for sure.”  Robert said scratching behind one of the boy’s ears.<br />
<br />
Eventually both the dogs broke away from Robert’s petting and went towards the door.  They began a chorus of barks as they faced the potential exit. <br />
<br />
“Seems like they already wants us to let them out!  Doug laughed.  <br />
<br />
“I’ll get the shock collar so Riley doesn’t wander off too far.” Debbie said, about to get up from her seat.<br />
<br />
“Ah don’t bother honey.  It’ll be impossible to tell them apart physically and I wouldn’t want to accidentally shock our nephew.” Doug said.  His decision was apparently well received because the pair of doberman’s began frantically lick him as a thank you.<br />
<br />
“Haha cut it out you two!  Alright boys, you better stay safe.  Seems you two were early birds because it’s barely 8 am.  Feel free to be out and about around the property.  Just be back by 8 pm so you guys can get transformed back.  I can’t tell which of you is Riley so both of you listen up.  After last night’s little argument we decided it would be good for Riley not to be dogs for the rest of our stay.  Now we aren’t mad you boys took a trip to the doghouse today, we’re actually happy to see Riley wasn’t the only one down on all fours for once! But it can’t happen again.  Bark twice if you understand.”<br />
<br />
The boys responded as instructed.<br />
<br />
“Good.  Now go off and have fun! Dinner will be ready by the time you get back so don’t stay out late!”<br />
<br />
Robert then opened the door and let the two dogs run outside, with the family dog Max following shortly behind them.<br />
<br />
“Guess Max will get to show Riley that hidden bone spot after all.”  Robert chuckled.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
It was three quarters past 8 and the family had just begun to wrap up dinner.<br />
<br />
“Those boys are sure taking their time…” Robert said with some concern.<br />
<br />
“Relax dear, I’m sure their fine.  Max was with them.”<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the family soon heard a scratching at the door.  The boys-turned-dogs sat on the porch outside, paws just slightly too muddy to be let in quite yet.  Doug could tell from their frantically wagging tail stumps and slobbering tongue that they were hungry.<br />
<br />
“Well look at that, seems our doggies want some people food.”  Will gave the two Dobermans a smug look as he chomped down on his barbecue ribs.<br />
<br />
“Be nice William.  Now, why don’t you be a dear and help Riley and John turn back to normal. The medallion is on the countertop and I think the boys left their flip flops by the staircase.” <br />
<br />
Will got up and did what he was a told, a bit annoyed that he had to be the one to turn his annoying brother Riley back to normal.  Once he had the medallion and the flip flops he stepped outside.  He rolled his eyes at the slobbering pinchers.  Not wanting to hold the sandals in his hand for too long, he quickly tapped each Doberman with a sandal and the medallion.<br />
<br />
Fur recurred, snouts reverted in faces, and soon enough two teenage boys, 15 year old John and 14 year old Riley stood in place of the twin Dobermans. Only something was off.<br />
<br />
Riley (or what appeared to be Riley) was inspecting himself with look of confusion.<br />
“What the-?! Hey! Will, you accidentally -mMPF” John’s words of concern were soon muffled, by his own hand no less! <br />
<br />
“-- you accidentally uh… changed us back without giving us clothing!  Yeah that’s it.  Out of nowhere too, could’ve given us a bit of a warning don’t you think?”<br />
<br />
John looked towards his rightful body, now certainly occupied by Riley!  What the heck was he doing?!<br />
<br />
Riley simply shot him a wink then removed the hand that was covering his old mouth. Riley then continued to speak. <br />
“Yeah COUSIN Will, I mean, look at us! We’re just completely naked now!  Isn’t that right COUSIN RILEY?”  The John imposter awkwardly emphasized before lightly slapping his cousin’s ass.  John blushed as his new large cock almost slapped against his inner thigh. <br />
<br />
“OW! I mean, uh, yeah?  Some warning would have been nice um… bro?”  John had no idea where Riley was going with this but he thought it best to avoid another messy confrontation between Will and Riley.<br />
<br />
“Whatever.  All they told me to do was turn you back, so that’s what I did.  You guys can just go upstairs real quick and grab something.”  Will gave one last look down at John in Riley’s body before heading back inside. <br />
<br />
John grabbed his discarded sandals then staring speaking to his old body in a hushed voice. <br />
“Why did you lie to your brother about him messing up and turning us into each other?!”<br />
<br />
“Because, this is a fun opportunity!   Trust me, the thrill of transforming loses its ‘WOW’ factor because everyone always knows when you’re using it.  But now with my big bro’s dumb mistake, we can stay swapped for spring break and no one would know!  I’ve been dogs sure, but I’ve never tried being a convincing human!  I bet you and I can fool everyone this weekend.  Come on cuz! Let’s pretend to be each other!” Riley said with a giddy tone in John’s body.</p>
