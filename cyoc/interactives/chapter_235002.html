<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the werewolf bounds off into the night, Ryan stirs in his bed, his average muscled body restless, his lips smacking together as his tongue licked at them, his mouth seeking more of the tasty fluid Ryan unknowingly consumed. Lost in the throes of sleep, he calls out to the beast that changed his life, &quot;come back...&quot; as the sound of the words uttered danced along the wind, reaching the werewolf&#39;s ears, halting him in his tracks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did... did he just call out for me?&quot; The brown-furred beast asked aloud, looking back over his shoulder, and waited to hear his mate&#39;s call.<br />
<br />
Back in the bedroom, Ryan&#39;s mouth opened a bit wider as his jaw went a bit more slack, but then uttered, &quot;please... come back... I need you, I need more.&quot; He moaned as lust and desire had began to set in as first few dollops of precum started doing their work.<br />
<br />
&quot;That... that was him! No... I can&#39;t go back... could I?&quot; The werewolf named Arthur questioned, but the connection that he created with the human Ryan was already growing and not only could he hear his pup... his mate to be calling out to him... Arthur could feel the desire within him. Now the wolf was winning and the human side began weakening and diminishing with a wry grin forming on his muzzle. &quot;Who am I to deny my pup what he is asking for?!&quot; Arthur said as he bounded back to the house, no longer was the human side keeping the beast from what he desired as it knew the deed was done and nothing would undo it.<br />
<br />
With supernatural speed and agility, Arthur lept back to the window sill, through the open window and into the house, carefully padding over to the pup in the making.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please... I need more...&quot; Ryan moaned in his sleep, still on his back, his mouth still wide open and now there was no denying it... Arthur&#39;s pup had asked for it... desired it... needed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh... there, there my pup... I am here. I will give you what you desire as I desire it as well!&quot; Arthur said in a soft, quiet tone as he walked up to Ryan under his covers and pumped this thick crimson spear. <br />
<br />
Arthur coated his clawed and furry digits in his thick, gooey precum, and carefully brought each digit to Ryan&#39;s mouth, gently pressing the first of the furry digits to his lips, sliding it carefully into his mouth as Ryan closed his lips around the finger and sucked it in deep. Athur&#39;s finger went to the base of his last knuckle as he could feel Ryan&#39;s suction pulling on and most importantly his tongue swirling around the digit, collecting all of the precum and when the flavor was gone, he opened his mouth for the next finger, which Arthur was more than happy to oblige. Watching and experiencing what Ryan was doing, completely in his sleep, Arthur&#39;s cock throbbed and bounced as he looked down and saw a thick bead of precum forming at the tip, threatening to fall and drip onto the floor, going to waste. He grinned to himself, hoisting his cock up carefully for the bead not to break away from the tip until it was ready and let the head rest gently on Ryan&#39;s open lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan... my mate to be... I got something better for you to suckle from.&quot; Arthur quietly stated as the drop of pre fell into Ryan&#39;s mouth, a moan escaped his lips, and then pulled the crimson spear into his mouth and began sucking it, nursing from it and enjoyed the untainted flow straight from the tap. Ryan&#39;s tongue lapped at the cock now present in his mouth, eliciting moans out of Arthur as more precum continued flowing, only further corrupting and making the pending changes in Ryan that much stronger.<br />
<br />
Arthur, the beast, wanted to keep going... to cum in the man and just let the transformation take him right then and there, but that would spoil the fun. The fun was in the transformation happening over time and Ryan had imbibed plenty to make him change. With a grunt and a groan, Arthur pulled away, wishing he could just let Ryan have his way, but even the beast side of Arthur knew when to show restraint.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... no more my mate, but soon. Soon you will have all that you hunger for and more!&quot; Arthur said softly, stroking Ryan&#39;s head of hair as he milked his cock of the pre that was still in his urethra, enjoying the treat for himself and bounded off back into the night, this time not heeding the call if there was one from his mate.<br />
<br />
As the night progressed and Ryan slumbered deeply, he had dreams of being surrounded by humanoid wolves, existing in a pack and being intimate with one another before and after a hunt commenced. The dreams were lewd having his cock straining in bed, the lycanthropic precum had changed Ryan to a degree as his cock leaked a steady flow of precum onto his sheets, soaking them in one spot, as the rest slid down his stiff mast that was not only more sensitive, but slightly thicker than it had ever been. It wasn&#39;t going to be enough to cause any level of concern because he would think that his mind was playing tricks on him if he even noticed, but it was going to be true. As Ryan continued sleeping, his body grew a bit more muscled, looking thicker and more built. Stubble adorned his face, his body was slightly hairier, more masculine, and rugged while his canines were slightly sharper than they had been and his ears gained tipped points. In his mind, his entire look was going to be normal as the precum rewrote his thinking so that he wouldn&#39;t think anything was amiss.<br />
<br />
Suddenly and abruptly the morning&#39;s alarm sounded, stirring him awake, as he rolled over and silenced the first alarm of three that he set. Being the deep sleeper that he was, it took Ryan a bit of time to fully wake up and get going, which was part of the three-alarm process. The first was to signal to his brain that sleep was ending; the second was to wake him up fully; and the third was the one that was the last call and Ryan had to climb out of bed. As the second alarm went off twenty minutes later, Ryan silenced that one as well as his eyes fluttered open, feeling like he had the most restful sleep in his life... more so than any other time in the past. Smacking his lips, he could taste the remnants of Arthur&#39;s pre... though Ryan didn&#39;t know what it was... and just chalked it up to his saliva being thicker, stringier and more syrupy than usual because of sleeping with his mouth wide open. He did that in the past more than a few times and it was never quite as bad as it was now, but Ryan shrugged it off because it certainly couldn&#39;t have been anything else... as far as he was aware. Stretching, curling his toes, hearing his joints pop and crack as he was getting his body ready for movement, Ryan laid there in the bed and started messing with his phone. He started with his emails, seeing if there was anything important that he needed to know for the day, and there were none... at least none that mattered or pertained to work. Then he went through his Discord servers, looking at the art and werewolf transformation materials people posted overnight... if there were any... which there were none. However, there was plenty of banter and bickering about a lack of good werewolf material or transformation related material for that matter. From there, he started looking at all the other sources for transformation material and nothing new was anywhere. Ryan sighed, irritated that there was nothing new for him to enjoy, but like usual... this was pretty normal.<br />
<br />
As Ryan sat up and hung off the edge of the bed, the third and final alarm sounded and Ryan made his way into the bathroom to shower, brush his teeth and so forth for his shift on the beat as a cop. Walking into the bathroom, Ryan stripped and threw his dirty clothes into the hamper and stood in front of the large mirror admiring his body. &quot;Man... these workouts at the station Drew has been putting me through sure seems to be paying off!&quot; He thought to himself as he flexed a little, then climbed into the glass-enclosed shower stall and started his shower. With a grin, he lathered up, feeling his slightly larger muscles and not noticing that his body hair seemed thicker and denser than usual, even when he washed his hair and his hands brushed past his now slightly pointed ears... nothing was amiss and it was all as it should have been... or so Ryan believed. As his hands brushed up against his nipples, they instantly went rock hard, hard enough to cut glass or even possibly diamonds, which made him grin while his cock simultaneously jumped to life as a wave of pleasure flooded his mind. A light, low growl grew in his throat as he continued rubbing his nipples, deftly and gently grazing the sensitive flesh, making him moan further as his cock throbbed with desperate need. There was so much pleasure that was assaulting his brain, Ryan just kept going at it, as his cock pulsed and throbbed even harder, bouncing with each throb, until he moaned loudly as his cock tensed, his balls drew up and he fully ejaculated into the drain and watched his load flow away with his soapy water.<br />
<br />
A look of dismay developed on his face, sad that it went to waste, but felt great and more pleasured than he ever remembered feeling from a jackoff session and climax. &quot;Wow... I think that&#39;s the first hands-free load I have ever lost on my own! That was so fucking intense, but so fucking good at the same time!&quot;<br />
<br />
Being careful not to stimulate himself, Ryan just quickly finished his shower, hopped out, and dried off with the large bath towel he had. Once dried, he walked back into his room, grabbed everything that he needed, and got dressed. However as he even put on his underwear and undershirt, Ryan noticed that the items fit on him a bit tighter than usual, but shrugged it off, thinking he either gained weight from the increased amount of food he had been consuming recently to fuel himself while working out at the station&#39;s exercise equipment or he gained weight from adding muscle on to himself, which would also account for the size he seemed to have obtained from his muscles growing. Either way, Ryan wasn&#39;t displeased, but it did mean that he would need to fill out some acquisition forms to get new pants, shirts and a duty belt if need be. He grumbled at that last bit because he absolutely despised paperwork, but he also knew that there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of choice because that was just the way things were. Once he was halfway ready, Ryan went to brush his teeth, baring them to visibly tend to them in the mirror and though they were longer and more fang-like... nothing seemed out of the ordinary to him there either. Finally, after tending to himself, he hopped in the cruiser in his garage and headed to the station where others were definitely going to notice, but he would think they were making it all up and would simply dismiss it all away.</p>
