<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey Jimmy, do you want to see something cool?&quot; You ask him. Jimmy looks bewildered. &quot;What is it?&quot; He asks. &quot;It&#39;s kind of a magic trick. Do you want to see it?&quot; You ask him again. Jimmy nods his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I need a pair of your clothes and bathroom for this trick&quot; you tell him. Jimmy gives you a pair of his clothes and you grab your book bag with the magic socks and Jimmy&#39;s shoes and take them both inside his bathroom. &quot;When I come out the magic will have happened&quot; You say. You close the bathroom door to a confused Jimmy. You strip put on Jimmy&#39;s clothes and the magic socks. You place your feet in his shoes and begin to change. Now faster than before you&#39;ve turned into Jimmy once more, in a minute at most.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK Jimmy! Are you ready?&quot; You say. &quot;This better be cool&quot; He says. &quot;Ok...close your eyes&quot; you say and give him a few seconds. Peering behind the door you see Jimmy has firmly shut his eyes. &quot;OK now open them!&quot; You say. Jimmy looks at you and then shrugs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the trick?&quot; He says. &quot;Don&#39;t you see it?&quot; You say concerned. &quot;Not really... I just see my reflection. Are you hiding behind a mirror?&quot; He asks. You groan. Not only was Jimmy not shocked but he didn&#39;t seem to notice that you were wearing a completely different outfit than him. You grab his shoulders and shake him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jimmy! I. Turned. Into. You.&quot; You say. A bit dazed Jimmy stares at you for a few seconds before his lips form a wide o of surprise. &quot;Woah! You&#39;re me! That&#39;s so cool!&quot; Jimmy says amazed. &quot;Yeah! I can turn into anyone&quot; you tell him. &quot;How? Are you a wizard or something?&quot; He asks. &quot;No, but I have these magic socks. They turn you into anyone as long as you wear their shoes&quot; you take off Jimmy&#39;s shoes and reveal the socks. Jimmy stares at them in amazement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will they turn me into anyone too?&quot; He asks with excitement. &quot;Yeah but first let me change back&quot; you say. Suddenly Jimmy softly pushes you on to the floor. &quot;Wait! Let me try them first&quot; he says eagerly trying to snatched the socks off your feet. &quot;But aren&#39;t you worried about me being in your body?&quot; You ask him. &quot;Not really... should I?&quot; Jimmy says with a look of bewilderment. You roll your eyes. As usual Jimmy was unconcerned with the fact that you were him and now had possession over every inch of his body. But to be honest it didn&#39;t matter to you too much. <br />
<br />
After all, you were beginning to like turning into Jimmy. &quot;I got the perfect shoes&quot; Jimmy says. He returns with an athletic red pair of shoes. &quot;Woah! Where&#39;d you get the money to afford those?&quot; You ask him. &quot;I didn&#39;t. They belong to one of my brother&#39;s friends. They left them at our house last time they came over&quot; he explains. <br />
<br />
Jimmy puts the magic socks on and is about to put his feet in the shoes when you stop him. &quot;Wait! You need to change out of your clothes. You may rip them in the transformation&quot; you say. Jimmy nods his head and begins to strip. &quot;Woah! Not in front of me dude&quot; you say blushing. &quot;Who cares? We&#39;re both guys and besides you&#39;re in my body right now if you want to see me naked you can do it yourself&quot; he says. As per usual, Jimmy has no shame. But you could admire his high sense of self-confidence .<br />
<br />
Jimmy puts the shoes on and you watch in anticipation. Jimmy&#39;s hair turns into a sandy brown color before growing long. Past his shoulders. His skins begin to darken to a tan color as of he&#39;d been in the sun for an entire summer. Next Jimmy grows even taller than before perhaps a few inches. You would have to guess he&#39;s 6 ft 5 at this point. Then Jimmy groans as his biceps grow and develop. His body hardens, expands, and grows thicker. His chest is covered by two giant pecs with an array of chest hair along with a six pack.<br />
<br />
His legs  widened and become defined and have also been covered in dark hair. Jimmy grows bigger and muscular within every second. Soon the last change you notice is his dick. Already pretty long you see it shrink an inch but widen in girth. His balls also grow and hang lower than before. Where Jimmy stood before was now a hairy and muscular hunk. Jimmy grows a faint beard and his face broadens. Then you hear Jimmy say in a much deeper voice. &quot;I think it ended&quot;.<br />
<br />
You stare at Jimmy up and down in awe. Jimmy was now a complete stud. Just before he was a pale and skinny weakling but now he looked like a linebacker for a professional football team. &quot;Damn! That was so cool.&quot; Jimmy says. He begins to flex his new biceps and says &quot;I guess those shoes belonged to Devan, he&#39;s my brother&#39;s teammate&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well can you put some clothes on now? Or do you want to change back?&quot; You ask him. &quot;Hell no! I look amazing!&quot; Jimmy says posing and exposing his newly acquired muscles. &quot;Besides I haven&#39;t taken this body to its full limit&quot; he says and walks over to you. &quot;Wait Jimmy what do you plan to do?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw the way you were staring at me Mike&quot; Jimmy says. &quot;You&#39;re gay aren&#39;t you?&quot; You blush. You honestly didn&#39;t know. Over the past days of becoming Jimmy you&#39;ve felt something awaken inside you but you weren&#39;t sure what it was. &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; you say. &quot;Then let&#39;s test it out&quot; Jimmy says and pulls you to his bed. <br />
<br />
He takes off your clothing and reveals your long and hard cock. &quot;Damn! I never realized how hot I looked&quot; Jimmy says in his soothing baritone voice and begins sucking you dick. &quot;Jimmy...isn&#39;t this worng?&quot; You ask but it&#39;s barely audible over the feelings of pleasure you currently feel. He grabs you and removes your shirt revealing your skinny and pale figure. &quot;I want to fuck you so bad right now&quot; Jimmy says and he opens your legs and inserts his cock.<br />
<br />
You take it in easily and are shocked by it. &quot;I&#39;ve been practicing on myself for a while&quot; he says noticing your confusion. You moan in ecstasy. You weren&#39;t sure how but Jimmy had turned into a completely different person. He was suave and cool. Meanwhile you felt confused and aroused. Did the socks also change people&#39;s characteristics along as their bodies? You didn&#39;t really care in the moment            <br />
 as Jimmy continued to fuck you.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes you came over Jimmy who had finished inside you. &quot;That was so hot!&quot; Jimmy says as he kisses you completely unaffected by what had happened. On the other hand you felt exteremely confused and weirded out. You had just had sex with your best friend in his body. Things couldn&#39;t possibly  get any weirder. The two of you change back into your own bodies with the magic socks and sait in silence for a few minutes...<br />
<br />
Before Jimmy breaks the silence. &quot;That was awesome! We have to do that again!&quot; He says ecstatic. &quot;What the sex?&quot; You say feeling a faint feeling of warmth coming to your face. &quot;Not that! Turning into different people. But we can if you want&quot; he says. You blush more and attempt to hide your face. Jimmy however is examining the socks. &quot;Thanks for showing me these Mike! I have the perfect idea where to use them mext&quot; he says. &quot;Where?&quot; You ask him. He responds with &quot;The...</p>
