<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><b>Earlier that morning...</b>
</br>
</br>
Jessica jumped at the knock on her door, quickly pulling her hand out of her pajama bottoms. Remembering her stint as Steve's jockstrap was always an arousing memory. She dove back under her sheets as the door swung open. Her mother stood there with a knowing smirk on her face.
</br>
</br>
"Jessie," she said with a voice dripping saccharine falsehood, "are you ready for the beach trip today?" Jessica's mom had been overly happy lately, thanks to Jeff's Chronivac program. It was rare to see the woman without a smile plastered over her face or at least a look of kinky ecstasy. Jessica felt like she should have been creeped out, but she'd used the Chronivac for equally strange stuff, so she had no room to judge. Hell, her brother Jeff was using the thing so much, she hardly saw him. Well, hardly saw him looking like he was supposed to, at least. He was even sneaking to the beach today as her friend Alice's bikini top!
</br>
</br>
"Yeah, mom," Jessica answered, waiting for her mother's eventual intrusion.
</br>
</br>
"I  was wondering if, maybe, I could come along?" Her mother played coy, absently looking at the various things in Jessica's room: posters, dolls, buttplugs, dildos... Jess liked to stay active. Her mother played with a set of ben wa balls as she studied her daughter in the mirror.
</br>
</br>
"What? Mom, no. This is beach trip just for me and my friends." Jessica quickly added, "Well, Jeff, too. Technically."
</br>
</br>
And just like that, Jessica realized she sprung her mother's trap. The woman turned on her heel, a wounded expression painted on her face. "Oh, but Jessie dear," she said, her voice so fake that Jessica started to feel embarrassed for her, "if Jeff get's to go as clothing, than shouldn't your mom as well?"
</br>
</br>
"Ugh. You're going to find a way to come along anyway, aren't you? So what, did you want to be my hat or shirt or-?"
</br>
</br>
"Well...," her mother cut in, "maybe I shouldn't have said clothing." She absently toyed with a little dildo on Jessica's nightstand. Her eyes darted up to hold her daughter's gaze.
</br>
</br>
Her mother's implication slowly sunk in. "Oh, jeez, mom, really? A dildo?"
</br>
</br>
"Well, maybe not one of those things," her mother said indicating several of the large rubber dicks Jess kept in her closet. She took a seat next to her daughter on the bed. "I was thinking something a little... smaller. More discrete!"
</br>
</br>
"Like a-?" Jessica started before her mother shoved a small device into her hands.
</br>
</br>
"Like that!" Her mom tapped the screen excitedly. Everything was already filled out. A pink vibrator, four inches long with no frills or anything. A classic model. All that needed to be done was for Jessica to confirm the selection. "I got a portable Chronivac for us, as well. You've got it right there in your hands."
</br>
</br>
"But why?" Jessica asked. She searched her mother's face, but there was nothing to read beyond excitement; possibly arousal.
</br>
</br>
"Sweetie, I know how young women can be. You just get me to the beach and I'll be in your debt. Name your price, and I'll take care of it."
</br>
</br>
"That's something we can sort out later, I guess." Jessica was already forming ideas and not just about her eventual reward, but also of the possibilities of having her mother along as a vibrator. "Well, mom. Here goes." Jessica hit the confirmation button and watched as the transformation happened.
</br>
</br>
Her mother's skin became shiny and pink and her limbs pulled up into her torso almost the instant the button was pressed. As she began to shrink, Jessica's mother began to shout back up, "Just make sure your friends know about meeee..." And with that, her face lost all of it's features and she shrunk down to the specifications. Her breasts flattened out, her ass disappeared, everything about her mother was gone. Jessica reached down into the pile of clothes her mother was wearing and fished the tiny toy out.
</br>
</br>
She ran her hand along her mother's cool exterior. "You have to be loving that, mom." Jessica had enough experience with the Chronivac to know how the sensations of being touched felt like. She knew how much better they felt when they were actually used. Her mother was going to love this trip. "Well, Steve's coming over in about an hour, so let's hide you before he does." Jessica walked over to her purse to drop her mother in, but paused. She did know how great it felt to be used. She also knew how disorienting it was as an object. Her mother wouldn't know that it was Jessica she was inside, just that she was inside someone.
</br>
</br>
Deciding quickly, Jessica tore off her pajama bottoms and stared at herself in the mirror. Her mother hummed to life in her hand as she started to edge her closer to her cunt. Jessica turned around however, looking back into the mirror to see her tight ass staring back at her. Her mother probably wouldn't be able to tell an asshole from a pussy. Balancing on her knees on her bed, Jessica stuck her mother into her mouth, letting her tongue roll over the smooth surface. Her mother even had a slight strawberry taste to her! Once she felt that the toy was good and lubricated, she gently traced the outside of her asshole with the tip. Even that little stimulation was driving the horny woman wild. She slid the head of the vibrator in and allowed the feeling to wash over her. Jessica was really going to enjoy this car ride. She pushed her mother in deeper, each inch drawing an excited moan. When the toy was about to disappear entirely, Jessica flipped the switch at the base and turned it on, nearly causing her to cum. She bit her lip and gave the toy one final push and shoved it all the way up her asshole.
</br>
</br>
"Oh, mom. I'm so glad you chose to do this. You're going to be the best vibrator my ass has ever seen." The doorbell rang, drawing Jessica out of her reverie. "Ah! Steve's here early!" She quickly threw on a skirt and panties and ran downstairs, her mother jostling around inside of her ass.
</br>
</br>
<b>Now, in the car...</b>
</br>
</br>
"And that, Alice, is how my mother wound up inside my ass." She patted her round bottom for emphasis. Steve was doubtlessly loving the feeling as well.
</br>
</br>
"Well, let's get going, then! The girls are waiting!" Alice exclaimed as Jessica began pushing the vibrator back up her asshole.
</br>
</br>
"Get in there, mom. We've got a drive yet," Jessica commented blithely.</p>
