<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Toby felt incredibly proud of himself when he saw the big boy run down the soccer field. He had done that! He was responsible for changing the shortest and the weakest kid into the biggest guy on the team! What a hunk he turned out to be! Toby was just loving it as he stared at the boy, who was all the results of his work. He couldn’t help but cheer loudly when the tall, buff kid scored his first goal. <br />
<br />
Yes, he had to do it again. There were more, many more, other guys who needed to become bigger, taller, and much stronger. There was work to be done and he was the one to do it. The loincloth had given him all this divine power and he was determined to put this power to good use!<br />
<br />
Thanks to his divine powers, he was able to hear the cries, the pleas, and the prayers from many others around him and near him. One expression of desire caught his attention. He instantly wished to be where this person was, and he teleported to the large shopping mall, where a preteen boy was standing just outside a large sporting goods store. <br />
<br />
Kyle had always been short, thin, and weak. He was already fifteen years old but being among the smallest guys in the Freshman high school class was especially hard on him. He was always pushed around by the bigger guys, and playing sports just seemed out of the question. He did try to work out in the school gym, but he was laughed at and made fun of by the bigger guys, so he found himself being too scared and intimidated to return there. He wanted desperately to be bigger and stronger, but he just didn’t have the means to accomplish this goal, until now. <br />
<br />
He casually strolled into the large sporting goods store where he walked all the way to the back of the store, where the workout equipment was. He loved the idea of working out at a gym, but he couldn’t afford a gym membership. So, he walked around and spotted everything from dumbbells to the bigger exercise machines. <br />
<br />
“Maybe I can afford a pair of ten-pound dumbbells so I can lift weights at home, just to start!” he mumbled to himself as he strolled past a long, metal shelf containing pairs of dumbbells going from 5 pounds all the way up to 45 pounds, in increments of 5 pounds. He picked up two 10-pound dumbbells and turned to face the huge mirror on the wall before doing a few arm curls. <br />
<br />
“Time for Kyle’s muscles to grow!” Toby grinned. “But he’ll need to work for it! His muscles will grow incredibly fast if he works out!” <br />
<br />
Toby decided to remain invisible so he could watch the growth from a distance. He also added a special promotion to the workout section, just to make it even better for Kyle. <br />
<br />
A salesman walked by and spotted Kyle working out.<br />
<br />
“Can I help you, sir?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes. I really like your gym equipment, but I’m afraid I can only afford a pair of dumbbells for now to use at home. How much are these?” Kyle asked the man. <br />
<br />
“Those are ten Dollars, but we have them at a fifty-percent discount! You can have them for five Dollars if you buy them today! In addition, you’ll enter in a contest for a free lifetime membership at Gym World, the large gym located on the other side of the mall!” <br />
<br />
“Oh! I’m interested in that! Uhh… Is it okay if I check out your other machines?” Kyle asked him politely. <br />
<br />
“Of course, young man! I will ring up the dumbbells for you!” the salesman said as he took the five-Dollar-bill and the dumbbells from the teen. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kyle walked over to the leg press machine. He felt rather strange, though. Did his biceps seem bigger and harder, all the sudden? He had only done a few curls, but it almost seemed as if his muscles had grown a bit. <br />
<br />
Kyle sat on the leg press machine and set the pin for the weights at 45 pounds. Then, he placed his feet against the large, metal plate and began pushing. At first, it was hard the extend his legs and push the plate away from him, but with each rep, it seemed to get easier and easier. <br />
<br />
Next, Kyle lay down on the bench, which was right by a metal rack containing a barbell with two 45-pound plates. Kyle grabbed the bar with both hands and tried lifting up the bar. It was a struggle at first, but with each push, it got easier. After about four reps, the barbell felt incredibly light! He re-racked the barbell and got up from the bench. <br />
<br />
Finally, Kyle sat on the leg press machine and placed his legs against two large cushions as he let his legs hang off the front side of the seat. Then, with his lower legs pushing against two cushions, he flexed his quads and raised up his legs, pulling a steel cable which lifted about 35 pounds’ worth in metal plates on the machine. His first two reps were the hardest. After that, it just became much, much easier. <br />
<br />
“I wanna work out at a gym so bad…” Kyle sighed as he stepped off the machine. He then strolled past the giant mirror when something strange caught his attention. <br />
<br />
He stopped and faced the mirror when it struck him. He looked… different! Much different than a few minutes ago! <br />
<br />
His quads were bulging with muscle, almost straining his shorts because they had grown and become so thick and so wide! His calves looked like they were massive, as well. His biceps were popping out and his pectorals were sticking out several inches’ forwards and sideways from his frame. He even had a V-taper! <br />
<br />
Last, but not least, Kyle felt like his cock and balls had grown as well. He had somehow become more manly. His voice had lowered a bit and become more baritone as his muscles had grown. Not only that, he had grown more hair on his arms and legs as well! What was going on? <br />
<br />
“Hey… Wait… What the--?” he gasped, as he flexed before the mirror. “Where did all this muscle come from?”<br />
<br />
Just then, the salesman came up to him carrying a box and a printout.<br />
<br />
“Sir, here you go! Congratulations! You qualified for the free lifetime gym membership! Here are your new dumbbells and here is a voucher for you to redeem at the gym so you can start working out over there today!” the man grinned as he handed Kyle the box containing his dumbbells. “The gym is open 24 hours per day so you can work out any time you like!” <br />
<br />
“What? Say what?” Kyle stuttered as he read the text on the colorful certificate. “Is this for real?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, you need to go over to Gym World right now to claim your free membership!” the salesman said. <br />
<br />
Kyle left the store and hurried over to the large gym, which was clearly located on the opposite side of the large two-level shopping mall. Once he arrived there, he walked in and showed the person at the front desk his certificate. <br />
<br />
“Welcome, Kyle. Here is your membership card and your locker key! Are you working out today?” the lady behind the counter asked him. <br />
<br />
“I… Uhh… I didn’t bring any clothes!” Kyle stammered. <br />
<br />
“Oh, you get a free gym bag with towel, water bottle, and an extra pair of shorts, and a gym t-shirt so you can start working out right now! No worries!” the lady smiled as she handed Kyle a soft bag filled with all these items. <br />
<br />
“I must be dreaming…” Kyle sighed as he strolled through the gym to the locker room as Toby looked on, feeling very satisfied. <br />
<br />
Toby looked forward to watching Kyle grow even more as he worked out at his new gym from now on. And, while he was there, Toby started looking out for other guys to grow!</p>
