<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric woke slowly, he felt so comfortable and warm. Furry legs tangled with his under the sheets, and a strong arm was across his chest, holding him tight against a shaggy-furred chest that pushed against him in deep, even breaths. The night&#39;s events came back to him slowly. Dinner, Clyde wanting him to try his favorite beer, a few drinks, and then kissing, fondling..<br />
<br />
Finally they had come back to the bed,  Clyde losing control of his human for as they made out. Eric gripping onto Clyde&#39;s antlers as he.. Eric blushed. He still felt a little sore from the rutting, and Clyde had been eager. Gentle as he could be, but eager. Eric hadn&#39;t been sure he&#39;d be able to take him, but they took it slow until they discovered he could indeed. The slow gentle thrusts coming harder and faster as they worked themselves up. The feeling of something inside of him tightening then unwinding. A release so much better than any of his self-inflicted climaxes. Then falling asleep in that warm protective embrace.<br />
<br />
He shifted a little in Clyde&#39;s arms, turning so he could see the reindeer&#39;s face, back to that not quite animal but definitely not human look. Definitely not the type of guy he imagined loosing his virginity to, or having a relationship with. His human form was closer to it, but Clyde couldn&#39;t seem to hold on to that once he really got aroused.<br />
<br />
Eric had to make up his mind. Three weeks the doc had said. That was even less time than his vacation was supposed to be. It seemed too short a time to make such a decision. He lifted Clyde&#39;s arm gently and slid out from under it. He grabbed his glasses from the nightstand but didn&#39;t put them on yet, instead heading into the bathroom. He stepped up to the sink and splashed water across his face, drying it with a towel before pulling on his glasses. He couldn&#39;t help the shout that came out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
He heard Clyde leap out of bed and come running. &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Did..&quot; He stopped when he saw Eric who was looking at his reflection and poking one of a pair of small knobs atop his head parting his brown hair. &quot;Oh heck. I guess we shouldn&#39;t have..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It probably would&#39;ve happened anyway.&quot; Eric interrupted. &quot;As long as we&#39;re close, right?&quot; He looked over to Clyde, trying to force a smile, then blushed as he saw that the reindeer was standing there completely in the nude and a bit aroused, then blushed a bit harder when he noticed he was naked as well. Even if they had slept together last night, he wasn&#39;t used to, well, this. He quickly grabbed a robe off a hook and wrapped it around himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I&#39;m going to be late!&quot; Clyde had caught a look at the clock and started darting about the room, collecting clothing. Then noticed the clothing he had worn was human clothing and wouldn&#39;t quite work with his current shape. He sat on the bed and took calming breaths.<br />
<br />
&quot;Late? Got lessons today?&quot; Eric even sounded a little jealous to his own ears, and tried to let that feeling go away.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m on transport duty. What? Did you think we just sat around practicing flying all for one night?&quot; Clyde grinned, grasping on this opportunity to distract himself. &quot;We&#39;re the main way in and out of the Village. Someone needs to visit family down south, or we need to pick up materials or supplies, all sorts of trips, all up to us. The old man keeps us busy.&quot; As he talked his form slowly slipped back into his human shape, letting him get dressed. Eric was only a little disappointed when the pants and shirt went on.<br />
<br />
Eric leaned against the wall as he watched Clyde dress. &quot;I guess I could use a day alone to think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde stood and walked over. &quot;Just promise me you won&#39;t leave without saying good bye.&quot; Eric grinned. &quot;And maybe one more rut like last night, because that was really..&quot; He made a deep growling sound in his throat. Eric swatted him in the chest at that, but then kissed him. He could feel Clyde&#39;s face beginning to stretch back out, before the he pulled away.<br />
<br />
Eric couldn&#39;t help but giggle at the partial muzzle on Clyde&#39;s face, as the other man patted his nose with his hand trying to get it to go back. &quot;I&#39;m going to need to learn to concentrate on this if you do stay.&quot; Clyde sounded hopeful as he spoke those words, reaching up to touch the small antler knobs on Eric&#39;s head gingerly, but didn&#39;t say anything further. He went to the door and pulled on his parka, giving Eric one last smile.<br />
<br />
Eric sat on the edge of his bed then flopped back, arms going wide. The bed was still warm and had a lingering scent he was beginning to associate with Clyde. It was more noticeable as a reindeer, but even with his human nose he could pick it out. He turned his head a looked right towards the collar sitting on the nightstand. Part of him wanted nothing more than to put that on and go chasing after Clyde. He wanted to stay.<br />
<br />
Then again, part of him knew that meant living up here. Giving up everything that had been his life to that point. What he needed was advice. He could always call his older brother, he couldn&#39;t explain everything, but maybe he&#39;d have some advice. Or maybe Rudy? He&#39;d probably be on Clyde&#39;s side. Lars? He didn&#39;t even really know the fox but he seemed friendly enough.<br />
<br />
Or just get drunk and vent to strangers at the bar? He hadn&#39;t gotten drunk before. No, not true, he had been more than tipsy last night when they. He blushed to think about it again. Regardless, he needed some outside perspective.</p>
