<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hmmm,” Frances thought; pursing her lips trying to recall anyone she and Samantha had a past dalliance with.<br />
“Before you start bandying out names,” Samson rolling his eyes; feeling embarrassed that his sister could be so casual with the conversation they are having. “I would like to have a ride home,” Samson getting up; “before I start seeing you and Samantha doing your own version of the beast with two backs.”<br />
“I have an idea,” Samantha speaking up; “William can drive you home. That way,” Samantha looking at Frances and Martha with a lustful gaze; “we could get things ready for a little fun time tonight.”<br />
<br />
“And with that,” Ben getting up; “Alex and I are outta here.”<br />
“We are still under a were-alert,” Frances thumbing through her phone contacts; “so no going furry while outside.”<br />
“We won’t be outside for long,” Alex grinning; “it’s been a while since we had a good howl at my house.”<br />
“Your still not going outside in your fursona,” Samantha speaking adamantly; “clothes. Now!”<br />
“Fine,” Ben grumbling; “let’s go upstairs Alex. At least it will be more fun disrobing each other once we get to your place.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh,” Samson shuddering as he watches Ben and Alex racing upstairs, their tails wagging merrily; “I know you have embraced this lifestyle sis, but still…. Ugh.”<br />
“You’ll find someone eventually,” Frances smiling; “until then… people who live in glass houses…”<br />
“What’s that supposed to mean,” William looking curious.<br />
“Never mind my sister,” Samson quickly answering; “I’ll guide you to my apartment.”<br />
<br />
Martha watched as her husband left with the bare chested deputy. Growling as they both left the kitchen; Martha was clearly impressed with Frances’s brother.<br />
“I wouldn’t mind feeling his shaft slip in me,” Martha loosening her clothes.<br />
“Down girl,” Frances chuckling; “my brother doesn’t fool around with married women. But he does fool around,” Frances looking up; “you think your husband would mind if a were-cheetah joins the fun?”<br />
“You don’t mean,” Samantha choking on some fruit punch; “not her?”<br />
“Oh yeah,” Frances smiling a she sends a text; “her.”<br />
“Good god,” Samantha shaking her head; “she is going chew him up.”<br />
“Who,” Martha looking at Samantha.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Ten minutes after William and Samson left the Twist household; William was stopping outside of a rather plain looking two floor apartment complex containing a total of twelve one bedroom apartments. The brick façade and window mounted air conditioning units, implied that the building was built around the late seventies and early eighties. Being a few blocks from the college campus; William could deduce that a few apartments are being rented out to several college students.<br />
<br />
“Yeah it can get fairly noisy at times,” Samson looking at William; “lots of young ladies eager for a tumble with a deputy.”<br />
“All were’s I take it,” William looking at the man.<br />
“I haven’t turned anyone,” Samson answering flatly; “if that is what you’re asking. But I have been known to attend a few parties as,” Samson grinning; “the evening’s entertainment.”<br />
“You’re not a gigolo,” William looking shocked.<br />
“Nope,” Samson getting out of the car; “but I did support myself while attending police sciences in college as an exotic dancer. Sex, was just an enjoyable tip afterwards.”<br />
“And Frances knows,” William looking at the wounded deputy oddly.<br />
“And I’d like to keep it that way,” Samson looking serious; “my relationship with my parents, especially with dad is strained to put it mildly. If they found out,” Samson sighing; “it would destroy everything I’ve done to get my sister and dad to be in the same room without trying to kill each other. Please don’t go spreading this around.”<br />
<br />
William looked on as he watched Samson walk to his apartment building. Observing a well-built woman leaving the building; giving the deputy a sly wink and an inviting slap on the ass. Hearing the deputy growl and bark in return as he entered the building. William was about to drive off when his phone buzzes with a text from Martha.<br />
‘Hurry back. The fun has begun. Frances and Samantha’s friend is a spotted delight you’ll love to plow.’<br />
Arching an eyebrow as he puts down the phone; William wonders who it could be.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Arriving back home and parking his car back in the driveway; William quickly gets out of the car. Noticing the curtains at old man Johnson house flutter; William shook his head as he enters his home to grab a few things. Being hit with that alluring smell his son Eric and his girls seem to be able to make; William’s pants start tenting immediately as thoughts of rutting his wife into unconsciousness fill his head. Growling as he runs upstairs to grab a few spare clothes and his wife’s were-birth control pills; he pauses as he quietly listens to see if Nate and his mate Jean are still awake. Placing an ear as close to the door as possible; he was soon rewarded with a bit of giggling as he could hear the two going at it hot and heavy.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to ruin their happy moment; William was about to run back out the front door when an idea struck him. Putting down the clothes in his hands, William races to the kitchen to grab a container with an air tight lid.<br />
“It may not be much,” William chuckling to himself; “but this maddening scent must be shared.”<br />
<br />
Waving the container into the musk filled air of his house; William quickly caps the container and heads back to where he dropped the other items. Making sure everything thing was secured; William leaves through the front door, locking it as he steps outside and makes a mad dash to the Twist’s house. His raging hard on straining through his pants as he enters the twist household.<br />
<br />
Removing his clothes as quickly as possible, William rapidly shifts into his were-fox form. His fur marking him as a typical red fox with black fur acting as gloves and socks for his paws. Sniffing the air with his vulpine nose; William grows with wanton lust as he can smell the arousal coming from two were-cats and a were-vixen coming from the basement. The fourth smell was however a little hard to discern; clearly feline and definitely female. William grins as he heads to the top of the stairs leading to the basement; opening up the container and waving the musky contents in the air. William hopes that they will travel downstairs; ensuring that everyone will want to go crazy with lust tonight.<br />
<br />
The sounds of four were-women in the throes of passion make his member strain; pre-cum oozing from the tip as he can feel his balls already clenching, preparing a fresh batch of cream to seed a fertile female with. Entering the basement with an audible growl; William easily gets the attention of both his wife Martha and a were-cheetah currently eating her out.<br />
“Is that the were-fox you mentioned Frances,” the were-cheetah growling.<br />
“That’s William,” Frances sighing; enjoying Samantha using her tongue to probe her sex. “Have fun with him.”<br />
<br />
“Gladly,” the were-cheetah yowling as she pounces from Martha and expertly impales herself on William’s hard vulpine member. Forcing the stunned were-fox back onto the stair as she starts grinding her hips; burying him deeper into her sensitive folds.<br />
“Woah,” William yipping in surprise; his body reacting as he shoots his load into the horny female.<br />
“You came already,” the were-cheetah looking unimpressed; “Frances here billed you as a voracious swinger in need of a good rutting.”<br />
“My husband is,” Martha joining the two; “he just need to warm up with something familiar.”<br />
<br />
“Familiarity breeds’ boredom,” the were-cheetah getting off of the stunned were-fox. Walking to a bag by the washing machine; pulling out a blindfold and a large vibrator that would make even the well-endowed were-horse look small in comparison. “Time to add a little sizzle to tonight’s steak,” the were-cheetah looking at William and tossing him the blindfold; “put it on William. Tonight you embrace your other senses for tonight’s fun.”<br />
“And the dildo,” William gulping at the leering were-cheetah; fumbling for the blindfold.<br />
“This is for later,” the were-cheetah growling lustfully; “much later.”</p>
