<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door key fit, and Tyler entered his own house. He heard plates being placed on the dining table, so it was probably almost dinner time. Putting off his shoes, he heard his mother come into the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening Tyler. Have you managed to stay dry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly,&quot; he answered, &quot;but I took shelter at Misha&#39;s house. She washed my clothes for me, as I was taking a shower there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that sounds fantastic, that means I don&#39;t have to do it. Anything else you want to tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so.&quot; Tyler lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, dinner is ready, so you can sit down right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, that was unfortunate, Tyler actually wanted to get his clothes sorted, but also didn&#39;t want to raise suspicion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first half of dinner was a bit silent and awkward. Tyler wanted to tell everything what had happened, but knew that would probably have negative effects, for both him and Misha. Thus, he decided to stay silent. When he was halfway finished with his dinner, his father joined in. He immediately started a conversation with Tyler&#39;s mom. Their son just kept sitting there silently, sometimes unfolding his legs, after realizing he subconsciously folded them. It sat more comfortable that way somehow. His parents didn&#39;t see it though, as his legs were underneath the table. Once finished with his food, he excused himself from the dining table, grabbing his phone in the process. <br />
<br />
In the hallway, he quickly unzipped his bag and got out his coat. He slipped his keys into its right pocket, and hanged it on a clothes hanger. He took the bag and the remainders inside of it with him upstairs.<br />
<br />
In his room, Tyler came to rest. He needed something to set his mind to. He walked over to his bookshelf, and grabbed a couple of school books, for studying.<br />
...<br />
<br />
Tyler hadn&#39;t dared to go out his room yet that evening. He yawned, it was almost night time already. He&#39;d spent most of the time trying to make homework, but barely made any progress, as he often lost his concentration. At that time, he&#39;d given up already. His parents had already gone to bed.<br />
<br />
Finally giving up, Tyler switched off the light he&#39;d studied in, and headed towards the bathroom. He brushed his teeth, and got ready for bed. Back in his own room, he grabbed the pajamas laying on his bed.<br />
<br />
He knew he still had Misha&#39;s panties on, but decided hours before already, he wanted to try something really bold. By chance it would be a once in a lifetime experience, as he didn&#39;t know how long he was able to hold on to this power, which he&#39;d discovered the past afternoon.  He slid off these panties, and saw that his pussy was still there, hidden in between his legs.<br />
<br />
Tyler put on his pajama shirt and pants, but got rid of any underwear. He tested it, and as he pulled up the pajama pants, he felt nor saw change in his crotch region. He reached down there with his hand, touching his crotch, feeling its flatness. Nope, no change.<br />
<br />
Tyler switched off all the lights in his room, making sure it was entirely dark. He made some sound, and did a routine he always did before he went to sleep. He did it to avoid suspicion, for if his parents were still awake. His anxiety brought the worst out of him apparently.<br />
<br />
At last, Tyler set himself on the side of his bed, and felt down there again. This time he tried massaging the region gently. A pleasure just as gentle returned to him, it was a nice tingle, at the same place the whole time. Once he found the exact location of this point, he found out this pleasure was caused by the clitoris. Continuing to massage it, he found himself clenching his teeth in bliss, sometimes letting out a gasp. He stayed silent though, still fully aware about what situation he was in back then.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he was concentrating on only that knob, with just a single finger, as he could be much more precise where underneath the folds of the lips he was able to touch his clit best. He felt around with his free hand, and found that the area underneath the clit had gotten moist, and felt a drop of liquid stream down the lips of his pussy. Searching around for what caused it, he found the fingers from his right hand - which were cold thanks to the blood having rushed downwards to his groin - circling around an opening in between the pussy lips.<br />
<br />
Tyler retracted his hands, searching for his phone. He found all of it taking too long. Looking at a good porn video would perhaps be able to boost his performance. He went incognito, and typed in the link of a good porn site. He just selected a random video on top of the recommended list. He was too horny to pick one himself, and didn&#39;t want to lose that feeling. Tyler brought his right hand down to his groin once more, and started massaging his clitoris again. The state of bliss hadn&#39;t faded one bit while he was searching for a good video, and it was as if his pussy was on fire, positively, of course. His breathing got quicker, as he felt odd, unfamiliar muscles inside the lower part of his belly faintly contract from time to time.<br />
<br />
Tyler wanted to feel where they came from. He lied down the phone, which he was previously holding with his left hand, on his head cushion, and turned his body. He was on top of the bed, his knees bent, his upper body hovering above the phone screen, which was still displaying that same porn video. He was still massaging his clit, but since he now had his left hand free, he searched around for that opening he&#39;d found just before. He rediscovered it, and held a finger right before the entrance. He looked at the video some more. The woman he was gazing at, was rather attractive. Just like normally he found himself looking at the girl most of the time, as he thought that would get him aroused the quickest. That statement was wrong in this case however. He felt himself get turned on the most by the dick the jock was in possession of. That thought both weirded him out and aroused him. <br />
<br />
With that thought, Tyler entered his glory hole with his finger. The sight of that guy&#39;s dick, hold that in front of your eyes. His finger went in and out quickly. He kept massaging his clit, but quicker. <br />
<br />
Caress that thought, treasure it! How big that must&#39;ve been. Tyler kept fingering his cunt passionately, the massaging of his clit had turned into a more violent, yet more pleasurable rubbing. Tyler brought a second finger inside his cunt!<br />
<br />
Embrace it. Cherish it! Hold it! Orgasm! Tyler soundlessly gagged. He wanted to scream it out thanks to the pleasure, but held on just in time. He&#39;d felt as if he had been orgasming for ages already, but the pleasure wouldn&#39;t fade. It had only gotten stronger over time! Eventually, the pleasure, the orgasm, it reached its peek. He couldn&#39;t do anything anymore but let all of it wash over him. Muscles all over his body contracted. It lasted seconds!<br />
<br />
What an experience.<br />
<br />
Tyler lied down on top of his bed, his face buried in a cushion. He still had to get back to his senses. His heart started beating in a normal pace again, his breathing slowed. He calmed down.<br />
<br />
He got ready for bed, finally. He pulled up his pajama pants again, but found them to be wet. Warm too, as if he&#39;d peed in it. Ignore for now, first delete the video.<br />
<br />
Tyler grabbed his phone, and was met with the exact moment the woman in the video orgasmed, pussy juices continuously jetting out of her cunt. So that must be it. Tyler had squirted, during the orgasm. Why hadn&#39;t he thought that through sooner... Ah well, no way to turn back time. He covered himself with the blanket, paying as little attention as possible to the wet stain on his pajama. Within a couple of minutes, he fell asleep.</p>
