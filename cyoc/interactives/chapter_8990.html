<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Noooooooo!&quot; <br />
You push yourself away from the kennel lady with your paw-like hands, but the pants bunched around your legs trips you and makes you fall onto your back. A canine yelp escapes your blackened lips as you land hard on the floor. And before you have anytime to react, the zoo lady is on top of you. She grabs your arms and presses herself against you. Her action making you feel aroused, and for a second, you stay perfectly still before resuming your struggle. You start panting out of fear as your muzzle pushes itself out a bit more. You can barely see the kennel lady as she brings her face closer to yours, there is so much fur in the way. Blindly you try biting at her face.<br />
&quot;Easy, boy, easy.&quot; She calmly says to you.<br />
But how can you be calm!? She’s literally turning you into a large Old English Sheepdog. And there is a part of you that wants her to do this to you! Suddenly she lets goes of your stocky, muscular arms and grabs your muzzle instead. You desperately try to open your jaws, but it hurts you to do so. You try pushing her away with your arms, only to discover that your hands are now full canine paws and that your arms now look more like forelegs. She then lets one hand go from your muzzle and starts stroking your shaggy head with it.<br />
 She starts to fond rub one of your drop ears and you start to pant contentedly at her touch. And this feeling of pleasure that you find yourself beginning to enjoy is something that worries you. You whimper as you make one last attempt to get her off of you. But your struggling starts to diminish as you find it hard to think. And you find yourself just wanting to lie there on your back while she gives you some loving attention. Looking up at her through the furry veil covering your eyes, you can see is saying something very soothing to you. You can’t understand what she is saying to you. But you do know that she is trying to calm you down and make you accept the fact that what is happening to you is perfectly normal. It is perfectly normal and acceptable to become a large, friendly and shaggy Old English Sheepdog. It is perfectly normal for you to be treated this way by your human friend. In fact you want her to treat you this way. You start panting contentedly again as she stops giving you  that nice rub behind the ears and looks deeply into your eyes. She shows her teeth to you, but you don’t feel alarmed or threatened by her action. Humans always smile when they are happy. And she does smell happy. She then gets off of you and lets you go. <br />
You roll over and look at her, waiting for a command from her. You still feel a bit odd between your hind legs, a tickling feeling that sometimes hurt, but not much as before. Maybe it needs some cleaning? You think. You curl yourself up to get at it, but your underwear is in the way. The human then speaks to you again in that strange but oddly familiar language again. You finally catch onto one of the words she is saying to you. <br />
&quot;Stand!&quot;<br />
And without a thought, you stand up on all four feet. <br />
&quot;Good boy!&quot; Your friend praises you.<br />
You look at her curiously and try wagging your docked tail that is still trapped under your underwear. You then twist upon yourself to get a better look at your body. Your fur coat looks really mussed up because of that thing you did before she managed to calm you down. Some of your fur doesn’t look fully grown in. And your hind legs and hind paws don’t look entirely right. Not to mention that you are still wearing some of your former human clothing. Why you are still wearing it you don’t know. It just looks silly to be wearing it still when you got this nice shaggy fur coat. And you do appear to be bigger than a dog of your breed should rightfully be, not that your size fully concerns you. Maybe your friend here likes bear-sized Old English Sheepdogs. You hear your friend sigh and she still smells happy. And why shouldn’t she smell happy, at least you aren’t trying to bite her, bark at her, kick her or run away from her- not that you would really do that to her. You’re too friendly to do that. <br />
 &quot;Well let’s see about getting you out of those clothes.&quot; She tells you as she squats down besides you. <br />
&quot;You know?...&quot; Your friend tells you as she starts to pull your shirt off. &quot;I am glad that I managed to distract you from the initial part of your transformation. As you male dogs are so much a pain in the butt when you change. You always try struggling before you are dog enough to accept what’s happening to you. Bitches are so much easier to deal with because most of us are so submissive to accept what’s happening to us. Though there were a few were dominant enough to have a go at me before they accepted  their place here.  But you...&quot;<br />
She puts her index finger on your nose<br />
&quot;...Pretty much gave into the change. Was there a part of you that really wanted to become a large, friendly Old English Sheepdog?&quot;<br />
In answer to your friend’s question, you just give a friendly lick on her nose. She chuckles and gives you another rub behind the ear.<br />
&quot;I guess so.<br />
She lifts one of your forelegs out of  your shirt and then does the same thing with your other leg. She folds the shirt and puts it on the floor before reaching over to pull a sock off your hind foot. She then fully kneels besides you. You try looking to see what she is up to.<br />
&quot;Now let’s see how well endowed you are.&quot; She tells you while smiling again and pulling your underwear off. With your underwear off, you can finally wag your tail with glee. Your friend then peeks between your legs. Her smile widens and she starts smelling even more happier. She grabs you by the collar and then reaches over to give you a firm hug. Your friend gives you another playful rub behind the ears with one hand while scratching you on the chin. She must be very pleased. So you start panting contentedly. Your friend then gets up and pulls out a brush from her pocket. <br />
&quot;Now, let’s brush your fur out before I help you out with the rest of your body. And you know what’ll happen after that?&quot;<br />
You look up at her and cock your head to the side before contentedly panting again.<br />
&quot;After I finish grooming you into a large, lovable Old English Sheepdog, I’ll take you on that walk I promised. How’s that?&quot;<br />
You say nothing to that. Instead you lean up against your friend and curl your shaggy body into her and look really happy.</p>
