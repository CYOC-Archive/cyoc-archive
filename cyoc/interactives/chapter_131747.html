<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
I opened the wardrobe and pulled out the red dresses I could see. 3 of them were possibilities. I decided to try them on. One barely covered my panties I decided I wasn&#39;t ready to go out in public with something that short just yet. A second reached mid thigh but was very low cut. <br />
<br />
The third, well the third was what I would wear. I thought I looked great. To my eyes it was classy without being too revealing. I don&#39;t know how you would describe it. There was a like a red slip with a red lace covering. At front it reached my knees but was slightly longer at the back. It had sleeves that covered my upper arms but left my shoulders bare. There was a small bow at waist level then it draped over my hips. I twirled around and the skirt bit flared out. I was sold. It had tags on it. It had not previously been worn.<br />
<br />
I took it off and put the other clothes away. I would have to braless but the dress had built in support. However I would need to find some red panties and shoes to match. I searched through the underwear drawer and found some satin red undies but when I pulled them out found it was a G-String. In for a penny in for a pound. I had found G-Strings quite comfortable and no-one would know what I was wearing. It would be my little secret. <br />
<br />
There were a multitude of shoes to choose from. In the end I decided to try some light pink stilettos with gold trim.  I walked around the room in the 4 inch heels, only in my undies and bra. They felt reasonably comfortable. <br />
<br />
Should I wear stockings? I didn&#39;t think so but if I was going to go bare legged I probably needed to shave. When I felt my legs I could feel a few bristles. I ended up running a bath and shaving my legs, my bikini line and my underarms. I was careful to tie up my hair so it would not get wet. <br />
<br />
Once I was out of the bath I worked on the makeup trying to replicate how Sarah had decorated my then face for the motorshow cocktail party. I experimented with lipsticks and ended up deciding on a dark red lip-gloss. Next I experimented with hairdo&#39;s. I ended up deciding long and straight was just fine.<br />
<br />
I glanced at the phone. It was 10.15 I would have to hurry. Still wearing the dressing gown I went down to tell Mum where I was going. They were already in bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you awake Mum?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m heading out with Shaz&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, Stay safe. Remember you bail conditions though and come back home. Don&#39;t disappear on us again&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mum, Goodnight&quot;<br />
<br />
I returned to the room and put on the clothes. I instantly recognized the pad would not go with the G-String so inserted a tampon. When I pulled up the G-String the cord was totally hidden.<br />
<br />
The dress clipped up at the back. It was a bit tricky to reach the top clip but I eventually managed. I chose a pink and gold clutch bag that had a long strap I could put over my shoulder. Lastly I choose some dangly gold earrings and put a gold bangle on my left wrist. I put my small amount of cash, credit card, drivers licence, the lip-gloss and a spare tampon in the bag, along with my keys to the house and room. I was ready.<br />
<br />
It was 10.42. I waited by the front door. Shortly a car pulled up in the drive. Here goes, I thought as walked towards the car, dazzled by the headlights.<br />
............<br />
I fumbled for the front door handle, a girl called out &quot;In the back&quot;<br />
<br />
I tried the back door and opened it. &quot;Hi Jenna&quot; came a chorus of female voices<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi everyone&quot; I mumbled<br />
<br />
A girl in a short red dress was shuffling across the back seat making space for me. I had obviously got in the wrong side. &quot;Looking classy Jenna, where did you find that outfit?&quot; That came from the front passenger seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve had it for a while just not a chance to wear it&quot; I sat in the seat, shut the door and fumbled in the dark to put the seatbelt on. We were already in motion, reversing out on to the road then heading towards town. The car was quite spacious.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you been up to Jenna&quot; asked the driver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got myself a job&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You? Doing what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Receptionist at a dentist&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Steady income I suppose&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like one?&quot; It was my back seat friend. I looked down, she was passing me a mint.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Sure&quot; she dropped the mint in my hand. I put it in my mouth. Shit, that&#39;s not a mint. I&#39;m not sure what I had put in my mouth, but guessed it was some sort of party pill. I had never been into that scene and didn&#39;t want to start now. I discretely removed the pill and held it between my fingers. I would dispose of it on the first opportunity.<br />
<br />
I asked a general question to the group &quot;What have you been up to?&quot; <br />
<br />
Front passenger answered &quot;I thought I had got myself preggo, my period was late. But it turned up Monday. Just as well, I would not have had a clue who daddy was&quot; All the other girls giggled.<br />
<br />
I sat in relative silence for the rest of the journey, listening to the other girls chat. I gathered that Shaz was the front passenger, the girl beside me was &#39;Em&#39; and the driver was Gabby. It sounded as if the girls knew each other from university. But I knew Jenna&#39;s stint at uni was very brief and many years ago. Maybe in time I would get the complete story.<br />
<br />
Gabby parked the car in a business carpark only 100 meters from Aston&#39;s. There was a sign saying &#39;No parking for unauthorized vehicles&#39; but she didn&#39;t seem concerned. Maybe she had a connection to this company. I didn&#39;t ask.<br />
<br />
When we were all out of the car I got my first look at the other 3 girls. We were all wearing red. Perhaps I chose the wrong dress if I wanted to fit in. The other 3 wore dresses of similar length to the 1st one which I had rejected because it was so short. Shaz had long wavy red hair. Gabby had shoulder length brown hair while Em was a platinum blonde, with a very short but feminine cut.<br />
<br />
My 4 inch heels were short compared to the heels the other girls wore. In the light I could see the car we had exited was a BMW. <br />
We walked as a group to the night club and had to show our licences to be allowed entry. The bouncer checked us out scanning his eyes over each of us. They lingered longer on my breasts  than on the licence I showed. He gave us a complimentary drink token each, for wearing red. <br />
<br />
I followed the other girls up the stairs to the main bar area. I had been here before and knew there was a quieter rooftop bar we could retreat to later if we wanted a break from the thumping music. <br />
<br />
The room was crowded and there were a lot of people up on the dance floor vigorously shaking to the thumping sound. A DJ was up on the stage. I estimated about 50% of the females were in red.<br />
<br />
The girls were scanning the room I assumed they were looking for somewhere we could sit. There were some empty booths at the far end. &quot;How about over there&quot; I said pointing at a booth in a corner.<br />
  <br />
&quot;No near those guys&quot; said Em. She was looking at a group of 4 well dressed guys in a booth much closer to a bar. There was an empty table outside that booth. We made our way over to the table. <br />
<br />
Gabby said &quot;Give me your vouchers and I&#39;ll collect some drinks. Anything in particular?&quot;<br />
<br />
Em said &quot;Surprise me&quot; I just nodded.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll come and help&quot; said Shaz. <br />
<br />
When they were gone. Em leaned in to my ear and said &quot;Let&#39;s see if we can stir up some interest&quot; She turned her back to the guys in the booth and looking at the dance floor started gently rocking her backside in time to the music. I soon found myself doing likewise. This body seemed to want to dance as much as Sarah&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Several minutes later Shaz and Gabby returned each carrying 2 cocktails. I couldn&#39;t make out what Gabby said they were but mine was nice. I did hear Gabby tell Em that the guys were looking.<br />
<br />
We stayed there sipping on the cocktails the girls showing off their assets. I realized I doing the same. I was trying to stand straight and thrust my breasts out, I wondered if people thought they were a bit on the small side.<br />
<br />
Em had worked herself around to the other side of the table. She was talking to Gabby and &#39;accidently&#39; bumped into one of the guys as he left the booth. That gave her an excuse to say a few words to him. In no time she was over in booth talking to the others and shortly afterwards came back to say we had been invited to join the guys. <br />
<br />
I followed the other girls over and we were introduced. It was hard to hear what was being said. I signaled that I couldn&#39;t hear. That prompted one of the guys to put his mouth close to my ear and say &quot;Robert&quot;<br />
<br />
I said &quot;Jenna&quot; into his ear<br />
<br />
He looked to be about 30, was quite tall with short dark hair and was wearing a nice suit. He and his mates had a jug of beer and glasses on a low table positioned between two 3-seater couches<br />
<br />
He pointed at my drink which was nearly empty. I nodded and said into his ear &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked to his mates who had all paired off with one of us. They gave him a nod, He spoke into my ear &quot;Don&#39;t go anywhere&quot; I nodded. He indicated I should take a seat on the couch. I nodded again and sat down. <br />
<br />
He went to the bar. Em was dragging her partner, the guy she had originally bumped into onto the dance floor. Shaz was sitting on another couch with a short blond guy and Gabby was talking into the ear of the last guy who had a shaved head.<br />
<br />
My feet were tapping to the beat and I drained what remained in my glass as I waited for Robert to return. He was back quicker than I thought but without any drinks. Had he misunderstood what I meant? He sat down beside me. He leaned in close enough that I could hear and said &quot;The drinks are coming&quot; I could see Em dancing out on the floor having fun. I wanted to do the same, but I didn&#39;t have the gumption to drag Robert out as Em had done with her partner. It was too noisy to do anything but dance. I thought I&#39;ll give him 2 more songs. If he doesn&#39;t ask me to dance I&#39;ll make my excuses and go to the quieter bar.  <br />
<br />
However after 1 song one of the club staff approached and set up two ice buckets on the table between  the couches. Two more of the bar staff came carrying two bottle of champagne that went into the ice-buckets and 4 Cosmopolitans. The first barman returned with a tray of champagne glasses. I was impressed. I would give Robert at least two extra songs.<br />
<br />
I continued tapping my feet to the beat while sipping on my cocktail. Rob eventually got the hint and leaned close to my ear &quot;Dance?&quot; I nodded. He offered a hand and helped me to my feet then led me to the dance floor. This body really did enjoy dancing. In it I wasn&#39;t self conscious as I had been when I was Zach. I knew from my experience as a male that any girl looks good dancing and good looking girls look great dancing. I knew I was a very good looking girl and it gave me great confidence that I could pull off all sorts of different moves. I was amazed how comfortable I was dancing in 4 inch stilettos. <br />
<br />
Robert was only an average dancer but he was very attentive and appeared to enjoy dancing with me. His eyes followed my every move. However after 15 minutes he motioned that he felt like a drink. I nodded as I too was starting to tire. He took my hand and led me back to the booth. I didn&#39;t try to pull away.<br />
<br />
Em and her partner were sitting on one couch while Gabby with the shaved guy were on the other. I sat in the spare seat beside Em, while Robert sat on the other couch beside Gabby. I assumed Shaz and the blond guy were dancing. I finished my Cosmopolitan. Robert leant over the table and showed me one of the champagne bottles. It was a Bollinger. He stood up and leaned to my ear. &quot;Another cocktail or a champagne?&quot; I pointed to the champagne. He popped the bottle and filled two glasses. Handed one to me and had one for himself. <br />
Before he sat down again I beckoned him close again. I spoke into his ear &quot;Let&#39;s go to the rooftop so we can talk&quot; He nodded. He helped me to get off the couch then picked up his glass and the bottle of champagne he had opened. I picked up my bag and put its chain over my shoulder. We made our way across the room then up stairs that led up to the rooftop bar. <br />
<br />
I was relieved when the noise abated once we emerged on the rooftop. It was a balmy night so I didn&#39;t feel cold in my dress. There was vacant table near the edge of the bar area from where there was a view down to the street. I made my way over to the table with Robert following. <br />
<br />
&quot;So I think you said your name was Robert. It was very hard to hear down there&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes, pleased to meet you. Robert Somerton is my name. Did you say your name was Emma?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Close, I&#39;m Jenna McKenzie&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;So tell me Jenna why are all the girls in red?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh just a theme for the night. We got a free drink&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well you look stunning in your dress. It was a pleasure to dance with you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, I enjoyed dancing and thank you for the drinks&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So tell me about yourself Jenna&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s not a lot to tell. I work as a receptionist at a dental clinic&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In town?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Near the Gardens shopping center. What about yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a farmer from near Horsham&quot; I was surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;You certainly don&#39;t look like a farmer. I didn&#39;t think farmers even owned suits&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not always sitting on a tractor sucking on a straw&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how come your in town?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m down for a bucks weekend. The main party is tomorrow night&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So where are you staying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At the Sheraton, we are sharing a suite&quot; The Sheraton was very close by only about another hundred meters from where Gabby had parked her car.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like dancing again. Are you up for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was actually enjoying being able to talk to you&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean dance with me up here&quot; We could still hear the music but it was more like background music.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would love to&quot; He took the champagne from my hand and placed it on the table. He took me in a waltz hold and we started swaying to the music.<br />
<br />
It was very nice dancing slowly with Robert. I found myself holding him tightly. He must have been about 6 ft 3 and I could feel his muscles through the suit. What sort of farmer wears a suit. He must be a gentleman farmer. He certainly had behaved very much like a gentleman and the way he had the barmen bring over the drinks showed he had a bit of class. He might own one of those old stone mansions. Be a member of the squattacracy. If I was stuck in this body for life I could do a lot worse. I loved Sarah, but she could only ever see me as a sister. She was no longer attracted to me. But Robert was, if I pressed a bit closer I could feel him pressing into my tummy. And I couldn&#39;t pretend that I wasn&#39;t attracted to him. My nipples were erect and I felt damp down below. <br />
<br />
I broke off the embrace and returned to the table and took a drink of the champagne. I needed to think things over. I didn&#39;t want to be a girl who slept with a man on a first date. But I was now a girl and I did want to try sex with this man. I would never get another chance. He would return to his farm and soon forget about a girl he met at a nightclub. Who was I? A almost 25 year old woman who was certainly not a virgin. I was on the pill. What did I have to lose?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to the ladies room. Stay here and I will be back&quot; I strung the bag over my shoulder<br />
<br />
&quot;I certainly hope so&quot;<br />
<br />
The toilets were on a mezzanine floor we had passed on the way to the rooftop. I went in and found a clean vacant stall. I emptied my bladder and removed the tampon I had put in earlier. There was no sign of a period and I did not replace it. I flushed and washed my hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jenna. There you are. Where have you been?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Shaz, I&#39;ve been up on the roof&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With Big Boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm with Robert, the guy I was dancing with&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just thought of him as Big Boy, I couldn&#39;t hear the names when we were introduced&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nice up there on the roof, we were able to talk&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think Robert is the pick of the bunch, that was classy how he got the drinks&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah, he seems a real gentleman&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like you won&#39;t be coming home with the rest of us. My guy seems a bit of a loser. I don&#39;t think Gabby has clicked either. Em on the other hand I suspect will get a bit of action......Do you have a brush. Let me fix your hair&quot; She ended up helping me reapply lip gloss as well.<br />
<br />
When we were done she said &quot;Good luck, Have fun, Stay safe. I want all the details&quot;<br />
<br />
I returned to the rooftop. Robert was where I had left him with a glass of champagne in his hand. &quot;I&#39;m so glad you came back&quot; He handed me my glass which he had refilled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s have another dance&quot;<br />
<br />
We resumed where we had left off. Me hugging him tightly as we rocked backwards and forwards to the beat. I could feel him pressing against me again. Just as I&#39;m sure he could feel my nipples pressing against his chest. I looked up at his eyes and he kissed me. The kiss lasted a minute. I broke it off but continued to hold him tightly. I slipped a hand to discretely touch his crotch. &quot;Do you think you could show me your room?&quot;<br />
<br />
He said to just let him text his mates so they knew he was going back to the hotel. He removed a phone from his coat pocket and sent a text off. I mentioned I had met with Shaz in the toilet and she knew what I intended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go&quot; I held his hand as we went down the stairs but continued directly to the exit. It was only a short walk to his hotel. I was pleasantly surprised when he hit the button on the lift to take us to the penthouse. He must be made of money I thought. He swiped his key to enter the room and switched on the light. The room was huge. &quot;Wow&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are having the bucks party here tomorrow night. I&#39;ll show you my room. It&#39;s impressive&quot; <br />
<br />
He led me down a short corridor to the room at the end. When he turned the lights it revealed a spacious room with a king sized bed. The room opened onto a balcony that looked over the city lights. He dimmed the lights and took me out to the balcony. I stood there admiring the view. He stood beside me and followed where I was looking. &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very nice&quot; he kissed me. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come inside&quot; <br />
<br />
I followed him back into the bedroom. &quot;Are all the rooms like this?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No this is the largest&quot; he was fumbling with the clips on the back of my dress. I turned around so that he could see what he was doing. He undid the top clip, then the second, then the third. The sleeves on my dress meant that the back had to be completely undone before I could get the sleeves off my arms. <br />
<br />
He was undoing the fourth clip, in the small of my back. I asked &quot;Are you the best man?&quot;<br />
<br />
He was silent. The fourth clip was undone. He started on the 5th and last. Once this was undone the dress could be peeled off. <br />
I horrible thought occurred to me. The last button was undone. He could no doubt see the top of my G-String. His hands reached around me and pulled the sleeves down my arms. The dress fell to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you the groom?&quot; He stopped undressing me. I turned around and saw a guilty look on his face. Here I was only wearing a red G-String and high heels. I covered my breasts with my arms. &quot;How could you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A last fling&quot; he muttered<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t do this, I&#39;m sorry. Please call me a taxi&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at me. If he wanted me I was powerless. I remembered how quickly the real Jenna in Rod&#39;s body had so easily overpowered and raped me. I judged Robert to be much stronger. I was at his mercy. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I should have told you. I&#39;ll call a taxi&quot; I was relieved but not out of the woods yet. <br />
<br />
He left the room hopefully to make the call. I quickly stepped into the dress and pulled it up. I fumbled with the clips on the back I was still trying to do the top clip up when he returned. &quot;There will be a taxi out the front when you get downstairs. I will pay for it&quot; he saw me struggling with the clip. &quot;Let me help you&quot; I had to trust him one more time. I turned around and let him do the clip up. I retrieved my bag from where I had left it on the balcony and left the room, the penthouse, the hotel. The concierge approached me to say my taxi was waiting. He handed me a voucher to give to the driver so that the fare would come back to the hotel. I was embarrassed, he must have known what I had been doing.<br />
<br />
As the taxi left I saw Em walking back towards the Sheraton with her guy. Good luck girl I thought. He is probably married. Men can be such bastards.<br />
<br />
It was after 3am once I was back home. It was straight to bed and asleep once my head hit the pillow.</p>
