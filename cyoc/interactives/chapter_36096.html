<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a nice summer day and Karen, Rick, Denise, and David were enjoying a picnic. It was a double date. Karen was very happy with her new life. She had quickly grown accustomed to knowing who she was originally but having her original memories just beneath the surface. It was like a persistent itch but she learned to ignore it. She and Rick had had sex a few times since the day they had switched bodies. They did use protection on those occasions like her mother wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was nice of you to provide the food David&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem&quot; David said. &quot;It's my pleasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wish that you didn't have food allergies so you could enjoy what you brought for us&quot; Denise said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's ok&quot; David said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you prepare this with your food allergies?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very carefully&quot; David said laughing. &quot;I made sure to wear gloves so none would get on my skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love your sense of humor&quot; Denise said. &quot;I'm just sad that we can't kiss for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll be kissing sooner than you think&quot; David said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; Denise asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nothing much&quot; David replied with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Karen was puzzled by this but didn't think much about it. After a few minutes she started feeling strange. Her vision began to blur and she suddenly felt very tired. She saw David stand up and wave someone over.<br />
<br />
When two guys appeared David said &quot;Let's get them out of here. We're going to have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still don't understand why we can't do it here&quot; one of the guys said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've told you this before&quot; David said. &quot;Someone could come by and that would be the end of our fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do they have to be awake?&quot; the other guy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they do&quot; David said. &quot;It will just add to the fun to see the terror in their eyes. Now, pick up Karen and put her in the van. Then we'll put Denise in and finally Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen was just barely able to hear what they said and she didn't understand it all. As the two guys lifted her limp body up and carried her to a van she realized that David had drugged them. She lost consciousness just as the two guys placed her in the van.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Karen slowly came to. The first thing she realized was that her clothes where gone. 'They must have raped us' she thought. It was then that she noticed that she was tied up. She then heard someone moving around and decided to pretend that she was still out.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no use pretending Karen&quot; David said. &quot;I know that you're awake. Though you'll still be feeling the effects of the drug I gave you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen slowly opened her eyes. Her vision was still blurry and she felt sick to her stomach. &quot;You bastard&quot; she said. &quot;You drugged us and then raped us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't raped you yet&quot; David said. &quot;I'm not interested in having sex with you right now. That will change soon though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's wait for your sister and boyfriend to come to before I answer that&quot; David said.<br />
<br />
From Karen's right she heard her sister groan and say &quot;You asshole. You drugged us. Do you even have food allergies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I have food allergies all right&quot; David said. &quot;They're just not the ones I told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another groan came from Karen's left and she heard Rick say &quot;Please tell me I wasn't raped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't been raped yet&quot; David said. &quot;Now that you're all awake I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I, Adam, and Dennis are going to rape each of you. Though when we do it won't be in your current bodies. We are going to change you with the Medallion of Zulo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know about the medallion?&quot; Denise asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do&quot; David said. &quot;How else would Declan and Steve have transformed into seven year old girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember them?&quot; Denise asked a bit surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do&quot; David said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to change us into?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we're going to change you into little girls&quot; David said as he held up a pair of panties.<br />
<br />
Karen felt a surge of fear swell within her and she said &quot;You're sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just find little girls sexually arousing&quot; David said. &quot;That doesn't make me sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it does&quot; Karen said. Her mind was alert now but her body was still sluggish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you just made up my mind for me Karen&quot; David said. &quot;I had been debating which one of you to transform first and to rape first. Now it's going to be you that's first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't get away with this&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh but I will&quot; David said. &quot;You see no one will be looking for you for a few days. By the time they realize something is wrong I'll have changed their memories to where you three never existed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know our parents won't know anything is wrong?&quot; Denise asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we used your clothes to transform into each of you and we called your parents&quot; David said. &quot;We'll keep doing that to check in over the course of the week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have we been out?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
Karen had an idea which was confirmed when David said &quot;It's been fourteen hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get a medallion?&quot; Denise asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam and Dennis took it from your mother last winter&quot; David said. &quot;Now no more questions. It's time for you to become little girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
David slipped the medallion over Karen's head and then touched the panties to it.<br />
<br />
Karen felt a tingling all over her body as she started to regress. Her breasts shrank as she went through puberty backwards. She felt her hymen reform after being broken just two months prior. She felt herself shrink and as she did her bonds loosened. The transformation stopped when she was eight years old.<br />
<br />
David picked Karen up out of the chair and said &quot;Here Adam, hold her. Remember, don't do anything with her yet. I get to be the first one to do anything with her. And Karen, you'll find that you can't scream. It wouldn't make any difference anyway as this room is sound proof.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam grabbed Karen and held her tight against him. She could feel his hard dick through his pants. She knew that when they did rape her that it was going to hurt as her present body wasn't made to accommodate adult dicks. She tried to get away but was unable to. She started crying in her helplessness and what was to come.<br />
<br />
She watched as David first transformed Rick the Denise. After he had transformed Denise he handed her off to Adam and stripped. He then took Karen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are one lucky little girl Karen&quot; David said. &quot;You get to be the first one to lose her virginity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Karen said and tried to pull away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now don't be like that Karen&quot; David said. &quot;I want some fun and you'll enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, let me go&quot; Karen said still trying to pull away.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see just how enjoyable it is&quot; David said.<br />
<br />
David reached down and began rubbing Karen's slit. This shocked her so much that she momentarily stopped trying to get away. She then renewed her struggles to get away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop fighting it Karen&quot; David said. &quot;It will be much easier for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then the door burst open and someone said &quot;Police. We have a warrant. Put your hands up and step away from the girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't just come barging in here&quot; David angrily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a warrant&quot; the cop said. &quot;Now, put your hands up and step away from the girl. If you do not do this on your own we will use force.&quot;<br />
<br />
David's answer to this was to hold Karen tight to him and he said &quot;Make me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen bit David's arm then and he loosened his grip. She then elbowed him in his balls as hard as she could. That was too much for David as he released Karen and dropped to the floor writhing in agony.<br />
<br />
The cop who had spoken quickly went over to David and restrained while calling for paramedics.<br />
<br />
Karen dimly noticed that David was bleeding while a female cop wrapped a blanket around her and led her outside.<br />
<br />
Several hours later they had each undergone an exam to see if they had been raped. The good news was that they hadn't been. When their parents came to pick them up one of the cops took them aside and explained what had happened. Alice and the cop were able to convince Tom and Roseanne to say that Rick was actually their daughter Rachael. They agreed on the condition that things would be explained to them. Once they were done they went home.</p>
