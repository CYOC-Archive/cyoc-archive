<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As jeff was still naked for this, Sally was quite surprised by Jeff&#39;s decision. Yet how was Sally going to argue with with one&#39;s dream as she turned to him with a raised eyebrow. Finding no joy of turning someone into a regular pet though, she had something special in mind for jeff to spice things up for him becoming her pet that was once her master.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, a role-playing pet? Jeffy boy wants to be a human pet?&quot; Sally giggled while watching him blush at the prospect of marveling his former pet&#39;s new pet.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, why would you choose to pick such a thing as for being a pet to be turned into of all things? Why?&quot; She suddenly ask him that he sheepishly answered this one easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they are the most popular people that are out there for they&#39;re also cool looking. not to mention sometimes acting on the job for their own masters sounds like fun, but I don’t really want to tell my folks that I&#39;m into this sort of thing. So, I figured that it would be nice to try this out with you.&quot; Jeff said as Sally felt like her heart would melt by his strange idea he wanted to try, with a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, sounds like a good enough reason to me. I&#39;ll tell you what, why don&#39;t we make you a special kind of pet? I do like the idea you have, just give me a moment.&quot; Sally said as she began to type down into the computer. Once she was done with it as she was soon done looking through the remaining options, she was then ready to start it up for Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... looks like we&#39;re just about ready to begin. shall we? Sally said as she was just about to push the button to start it all up on the computer, but before she could do it that Jeff stopped her for something while being told to wait.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Jeff? Did you forget something?&quot; Sally asked, turning to face him.<br />
<br />
looking over to Sally, Jeff then answered as to why he stopped her while wanting to tell her on waiting. “in a way, sort of. Just give me a few moments.”<br />
<br />
This made her questionable as to what he was doing which was so important to wait that hurrying over to the bed, he sat down and started to do something unexpected in front of a naked woman who was once his dog while bashfully blushing about it. he was taking his clothing off as he started to take his shoes off first that once they were off for he did the same with his socks, followed by his pants, then his shirt that the only thing left was his very own underwear. Seeing as he was shortly after removing them off to is where he was completely naked while looking at Sally with a almost red face by now that he told her why he did what he had done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry for the wait. it&#39;s just that if I were to change now while my clothes were on that it would be a seriously big mess, not to mention on getting us both in trouble if someone finds out about what happened to my clothes. so, I can’t transform with my clothes on.&quot; Jeff said as she was amazed by his naked body for he was a bit lanky with some muscles on his arms and legs while his chest was poked out a little.<br />
<br />
Sally, being his former dog was somehow getting turned onwhen she sees his limp dick in a way that she was biting her lips. Jeff saw this from her and realized why that he tried to cover from embarrassment with only his arms and hands while blushing red. “Hey! st, stop staring at me like that! you may be a woman now, but you&#39;re still a dog on the inside. so if you Don’t mind there missy, get your head out of the gutters that i don&#39;t want any funny ideas about me for right now. You pervert.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally gave a bit of a sigh as she decided to tell him what was on her mind about it. “Y, yes… of course… I do get it, but I don&#39;t want to have sex with anyone other than you. Let alone when you&#39;re turning into something else that&#39;s not human. still, it would be interesting to see what it&#39;s like to have sex as a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
This made jeff feel bad for she had feelings for him, filling him out with gilt. &quot;I think that will be for another time, one I hope would wait until you get use to this new human life style. slowly, but surely. Now then, shall we begin with this change?”<br />
<br />
Sally moved back to the computer was a smile. after various minutes with the mouse pointer, she clicked on it to start Jeff&#39;s changes that the window screen appeared initiating change. &quot;Why, I thought you&#39;dnever asked.<br />
<br />
Once the changes started that Sally turned to see Jeff naked, waiting for something to happen. So far though, Jeff noticed that the beginning changes to his body wasn&#39;t overwhelming with pain as he had expected for it was just uncomfortable to him with the re-shaping part with several of his bones. Jeff was quite excited though when his hands gradually became longer and thicker while being completely encased by what looks like rubber.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re happy and you know it, clap your hands.&quot; Sally giggled while she began to joke that Jeff played along and clapped his them together a couple of times, before Jeff started to feel uncomfortable for his feet were going through the same thing as his hands did. Gradually, his body was losing hairs that his arms and legs were being covered by the same thing his hands and feet were as it was soon climbing up his waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is awesome! You know, I can&#39;t wait to see what kind of human pet I&#39;ll turn up being as.&quot; He said while starting to get used to his new, as well to his new extremities that was encasing his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s not all there is. Look!&quot; Sally said as she was soon pointing to his rear where a little nob was popping out. Jeff realized that this was going to something special as it continued to pop out just above his butt, growing to what Jeff believes was his tail.<br />
<br />
Jeff started to feel sick as his entire body-hair, except for his hair disappeared while being completely covered by rubber for it shortly after reached up to his neck. However, the sickness was soon gone for Jeff saw Sally digging in his underwear drawer and pulls out what appears to be a red ball with a black strapped buckle attached to it for Jeff knew what she had as it was a ballgag. Suddenly, Jeff did not like the idea of being Sally&#39;s human pet anymore as she fastened it around his head to where only the ball part was sticking out of his mouth as Sally shortly after gave him a kiss over his ball covering mouth.<br />
<br />
Jeff was quite puzzled about this. Why did he wanted this to happen? Sally would do a lot better of being a human pet then him, yet Jeff suddenly understood what Sally meant by a few adjustments when under her laughter is when his face was being covered up to look more like an animal that only holes were his eyes, nose, and his muzzle of a mouth.<br />
<br />
To Jeff&#39;s added surprise as tight straps were being placed on his rubber skin coat body that a harness appeared on his torso while most of this started which some showed off his tight, bulging crotch. Turned on by this that the changes suddenly stopped there as Sally was smiling by this. Jeff wanted to scream, but with him being gagged under his pet hood that it didn&#39;t quite come out like he expected to be.<br />
<br />
Sally couldn’t tell what Jeff&#39;s expression was, no thanks to his rubber pet hood as it completely covered his head. Jeff was feeling red for he was blushing by this however that the the straps quickly wrapped around his ankles, wrists, thigh legs, and his upper arms as locks were placed to where his closed hand fist that were covered by rubber mitt hand glove like paws and his feet, which were on the thightly bound straps by the way. Luckily for him as Jeff wasn&#39;t on all fours with pet covered mitts on his hands and feet while ending up being placed on all fours, let alone on his knees that he looked like a wet dream to somebody with a latex tail for a metal ring was placed at the base end of his rear.<br />
<br />
The straps was connected to keep the metal ring tightly in place while holding it together as the base just above his butt, but just by an inch that changes slowed down to a holt fot it stopped there. Feeling a little lightheaded from this, Jeff was trying to gain some footing to his newly changed balance as Sally saw this happening to him that she couldn&#39;t help but giggled by what she was seeing from him. &quot;Ah, how cute. You try to walk like a little bambi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cut the crap Sally! Look what you&#39;ve done to me! I&#39;m a freak of all pets out there! Get me out of here, help me!&quot; Jeff wanted to complain while he tried to say, but only noticing that with the gag still strapped to his mouth is where he couldn&#39;t say much of anything at all for he could only muffle. He was no longer able to speak for His muffles were indead coming out as they were being heard out by an animal call, unaware that she could very much hear him out perfectly clear. Only being able to make the sounds of an animal started to suck and sounding unfair now as Jeff started to struggle to get this strangely formed pet suit off of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Jeff, what do you think? Are you Alright?&quot; Sally asked, watching as he tried to see his new form for the first time. However, feeling really strange about this that he failed to tell her just what for it still came out as an animal with no facial expression to even show her how he&#39;s feeling. Trying to answer her that he doesn&#39;t know, don&#39;t know how this was going to work out as he looked to her with confusion as she bursted out laughing.<br />
<br />
Jeff was feeling scared, but also intrigued for what his former pet had planned for him now. Jeff did however wished he didn&#39;t have to hide from Sally his large box with any kind of sex toys imaginable in his closet, or rather Sally&#39;s now. Still though, what would his parents think as they were shocked to find them before, but as this?!<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you&#39;re wondering why this for a human pet. Let&#39;s just say,  you&#39;re better off this way then anything. besides, having to hide you from the public eye is going to be a thrill without. The reason for this is because I didn&#39;t have the reality switch turned on. Pretty sweet, ha?&quot; She smiled viciously that Jeff thought this wasn&#39;t going to end well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, why don&#39;t you just follow me. I have something special planned for you, my pet&quot; she continued as she led Jeff out of the room and into the basement that she even did it with her old leash atached to his strapped collar. This was almost making him stumble alot as he&#39;s still very much unfamiliar with his new physique.<br />
<br />
Since Jeff didn&#39;t want to end up as someone else&#39;s property that Sally could count on his obedience, even if he had thoughts to attempts on escaping. However, where would he go looking like this?  So he didn&#39;t had plans on attempting to escape from her as shesoon after the end of the leash to the wall inside the basement, tieing it firmly so that he couldn&#39;t get away.<br />
<br />
&quot;And just so you know, I got big plans for you. Now then, be a good boy and wait for me here while I prepare some things. You know, having hands instead of paws is the best thing that could ever happened to me. Just think, I would never have been able to tie this lesh with such things.&quot; Sally continued as she patted your head that you felt ashamed for this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally! c, come on Sally! You, you can&#39;t leave me here like this!&quot; He try to yell, but it still came out with him muffling for it also came out as an animal. Jeff wished now on what human pet he truly was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I&#39;m sorry that you can&#39;t do things anymore that we humans can do. Now that I&#39;m in this body, I&#39;ll be able to go anywhere as my collection of pets is going to multiply in no time. still, with you in those beautiful new mitt hands that I imagine it to be even more impossible.&quot; Sally said as she laughed loudly, but blow kisses you befofe rushing up the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Co, collection? What, what are you talking about? Sally! Sally, do not go up those stairs. Sally, do not leave me here like this all night. look, what ever you want that I&#39;ll give it to you. You can stay human and be apart of this family.&quot; Try as he might while struggling to Break Free of his predicament that Jeff almost panicked for he knew very well what he&#39;ll not be able to do anymore, being able to things like opening the simple knots which tied him up like a regular horse to its stall of a shed was just one of those things for it was just the tip of the iceberg.<br />
<br />
What did his former pet had planned for him? Now that Sally was his master and Jeff was just a mere pet to Sally. It took her several long hours to return back, fully dressed he my add while bringing down with her a full-size mirror that Jeff stopped struggling to break free and looked up to see what he had saw of himself for he was amazed at the metamorphosis.<br />
<br />
Even by a pet&#39;s point of view, they each wanted to stay home and tested out their new bodies that Sally was thinking more of trying to have some pet style sex. Sally leaned over the sizable mirror as she brought the phone down with her, in case the phone rings for it could be Jeff&#39;s family that he wished it not to ring it to be one of his friends. Sally didn&#39;t plan on using the program to turn herself into what Jeff calls Sam, a male boy that the thought of his family being turned into animals for their trip by the use of the program had really turned him on of being worried for their safe return.<br />
<br />
now Jeff started wishing for his family to come back home earlier then planed, even if he&#39;ll be grounded for messing with the program in the first place. Sally untied the end of his leash and led him closer to the mirror for a better look to what kind of human pet he was. When he did, Sally also brought a few things for Jeff as his pet life starts now on being a human pet _______.<br />
<br />
(This is where you decide what human pet he is while being completely encased by what looks like rubber from head to toe. He could be a pony to help pull Sally&#39;s chariot, a pup to be where Sally had once been, an alligator to make Sally some money, a fox to be dressed in a maid outfit, even a dragon for the sky&#39;s the limit. please, feel free to add your own story line up ideas as there are a few listed down below. thank you and happy reading.)</p>
