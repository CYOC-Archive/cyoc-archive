<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Dustin entered the women’s room there were three girls there and they did bat an eye actually smiling  and acknowledging him.  Getting into a stall and hiking down his panties Dustin saw that his thighs and butt had grown and his dick had gotten smaller with crunch berry sized balls and his nipples had become puffy fat surging out becoming barely a cup size mounds. <br />
<br />
Suddenly right before they were leaving having finish their cigarettes the three girls began foaming from the mouth and convulsing their bodies becoming a little broader, their breasts shrinking to bumps as their face made cracking and popping sounds their Face is becoming exact replicas of  Dustin’s. Their moans became his, he peered out to see their clothes vanish clitoris’ grow into replicas of his smooth cock before surging a foot bigger becoming Weaponized the tiny balls remaining small but somehow capable of producing gallons of highly infectious semen. their hips and thighs finishing compressing. Dustin trying to think up a plan retreated and sat hunched up on the toilets hiding his feet from the bottom of the stall terrified of  what he saw.<br />
<br />
The three replica Dustin(s) leapt up giggling ran out the door as infectious nudist femboi(s) hearing screaming and moaning coming from the hallways as people were being affected by them in different ways only needing to breathe within 3 feet of them to trigger the change. <br />
<br />
Opening the door he wanted to cry it was worse than he imagined, as he saw the process of becoming him various semen contact students writhing on the ground becoming various versions of him. Some of them mutated with horse heads, tentacles, claws, multiple limbs, and beaks some of them had elf ears some of them were morbidly obese others were massively muscular like how Dustin used to dream of being with new mutations happening constantly. Knowing it was a matter time before they would be up Dustin fled to the biology lab he was supposed to be at ,thinking Andrew would keep him safe. <br />
<br />
“Stop!!” Ty boomed intercepting Dustin in a baritone growl  vibrating the ground with every heavy footstep looking wildly different having become 12 feet tall covered and acne his nose becoming broad and crooked his features roughing up  becoming hyper masculine growing a massive beard on his lanterned jaw patches in his head as clumps of his own hair falling out well hair was sprouting all over his body.<br />
Dustin turned his head sideways  “Ty?!” Doesn’t begin panicking as he started to feel funny his bones hearing up cracking.<br />
Breathing heavily yet hurrying now being over 500 pounds of muscle unable to touch his head  “I-I wish that you aren’t infectious anymore and virus proof!” <br />
Even though Ty looked like like hammered dog shit his booming baritone voice gave Dustin a stiffy particularly because he just got a minor testosterone bump.  Ty saw that sighing “Listen it’s not a forever cure I have wished myself an not infectious four times, get to class.” as his roid gut surged forward his muscles growing again having become a waddling wall of muscle ty gave himself  a small tool belt of super powers flight to get around (And if he can’t reverse it possibly the immortality to keep the muscles from crushing his organs killing him) hidden by his ripped up jeans his cock had shrunk to be roughly the size of dustin’s.<br />
<br />
Even though Ty  didn’t want to be on the juice he unfortunately he looked jacked up with almost every bad side effect having  stopped rogue scientist who made a reverberation machine and had been following him tracking Ty and creating replicating nanobots containing his wish energy he was teaching a bullying jock a lesson Ipso facto creating a magical virus. Ty had crushed his skull with his super strength but it’s too late damage is done Ty thought.<br />
<br />
But he was wrong as he levitated over the streets he saw the naked femboi Dustins Savagely screaming and pounding their chest there a high-pitched whales becoming animalistic. The Zombified viral fembois chadding out Becoming massively muscular and masculine the only thing remaining from the Dustin virus being his feminine haircut and pink nail polish As they surged in height and muscle becoming covered in Downey orange hair eventually resembling pimply grunting orangutan steroid monsters.<br />
<br />
Thai feeling mercy on her soul’s “I wish that the Femboi Virus and the Gym bully virus cause the subject to turn to dust!” The orange ape like creature’s with girly haircuts and pink finger and toenails all perished into ash. Floating back home because ty had made June and Mark bio- occultists Mindlessly and tirelessly they work as automatons being stripped of the need to sleep eat or drink they work in a hyper sterilized lab.<br />
<br />
Waiting at the Archway far too big to enter the domicile any more Mark came out in a advanced bio suit one would probably see eventually on Mars he was holding a vile saying that his stepson who is now in immobilized slab he poured it in his mouth running back inside partially terrified. Ty shrank down becoming 4’2” His face is clearing up and his beard hair falling out while his head hair grew down to his shoulders his body becoming thin lithely Grinning he saw that his cock would return which gave him some sense of accomplishment. The super powered beanpole entered the scan bay Initiating a ritualistic incantation and scanning him with highly advanced sensors they could not detect a single Nanobot.<br />
<br />
“You are good ty, I would advise on waiting a period of 4 to 12 hours for side effects before I would distribute this into the populace.” Said June Mark handed TY the recipe through a slot. Reading the chemical map out Ty wished to understand it and fast forward 12 hours It became nighttime and then summoning a vast concentration of rainclouds Ty altered them on a molecular level to rain concentrated cure Distributing them throughout the world there was a four day period of torrential orange downpour.  Reassuring TY that the gym bully virus was gone for good Probably causing a good chunk of the earths population to become emaciated and small like him he could wait on a cure for that His relief was short-lived though as the shrimpy twig ass boy Saw Dustin holding Andrews hand just for Andrew to start convulsing on the ground shrinking and moaning and becoming more and more feminine his face warping into dustin’s Andrew leaping up Ty used his eye beams exploding the infected  Andrew’s head. <br />
Dustin screaming “TY I loved him”<br />
<br />
Ropey ty shooting off “I’ll bring him back to life and if not I’ll turn a rock into him or something I have to go and cure some thing that can’t be wished away! The only people who know anything about this crap is me and our parents who can’t succumb to the virus!”</p>
