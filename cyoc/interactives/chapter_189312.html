<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">+++ Kimberly&#39;s POV +++<br />
&#39;What is happening here?!&#39; Kimberly thought in fear and desperation. She could see everything as usual from her own point of view. She had witnessed everything that suddenly had changed about her appearance, the perverse photos on her phone that also were on all her social media accounts… her life was a mess now all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
But what scared her the most was the fact that since she felt the impact of something rushing into her and fell to the ground she couldn&#39;t move anymore…but her body moved itself!?!<br />
<br />
And also she could hear her voice saying something but she didn&#39;t had any control about her mouth herself &quot;<em>Ha ha! That was...hilarious, oh my God! It&#39;s like, I kinda feel bad for her, but hey, I don&#39;t really feel bad for her! After all, she ruined my life, and now, I&#39;m ruining hers, or rather, she&#39;s ruining herself!&quot;</em><br />
<br />
Who was that? Somebody seemed to be inside of her body…speaking with her voice!?... someone that hated her and wanted revenge.<br />
And then Kimberly&#39;s memories came back, remembering the moment when she was in her room on her bed and something tuck up her shorts and afterwards got inside of her… then speaking to her… it had been Jake!<br />
<br />
He really had overtaken her body completely… and after that it was all blank to her… next thing she remembers being: lying on the floor and looking into the mirror and seeing her naughty, black leather outfit, absurd hairstyle and her tattooed skin.<br />
<br />
&#39;Okay, Kimberly get clear on this situation.&#39; she forced herself to calm down and again just watched what her body was doing.<br />
<br />
It began to dress into several outfits, taking photos of herself in naughty and humiliating positions and also videos while speaking like a slutty, dumb bitch, stripping down naked in front of the running camera while putting on a new outfit. She couldn&#39;t believe that this pervert was in charge of her body and with that is &#39;allowed&#39; to touch it, dress it in sexist costumes and whore-like clothes – it was a total nightmare to her. Unable to do anything, but watching EVERYTHING! <br />
<br />
She felt like crying, like breaking together to the ground; but nothing happened, just more and more costumes were dressed up on her body that afterwards humiliated itself for the camera.<br />
<br />
&#39;This mental asshole!,&#39; Kimberly thought in anger, &#39;how did he even get those powers? He can&#39;t have them for long, otherwise he had already used them earlier. The way he freaks out this power seems to be exactly the power he ever wished for. And he is so excited that it seems like he just received them today, right after waking up or something.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jealously she then thought &#39;I wish I would receive the powers I wanted, and that all this wouldn&#39;t have happened … well and couldn&#39;t happen to me ever again… nor my friends. But which powers would I like?... Don&#39;t know about these possession skills, since I really like to be myself… but making others do what I want is cool, I admit… so mind control powers would be lit, I think. I wonder if I would be THAT mean like he is when I&#39;d get such powers… well I wish I was, because that way I could really enjoy my revenge.&#39; Kimberly dreamed, maybe to flee from this dreadful reality – but then –<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish granted.&quot;  a female voice called.<br />
<br />
Before Kimberly could react, well mentally that was, a white flash surrounded her and she found herself back at her parent&#39;s home, in her room; like earlier this morning.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened?&quot; she said out loud, confused by the sudden flash and change of surroundings. But after one more second all events were erased from her memory. And she acted normally like when it had been earlier this morning.<br />
<br />
She got into the bathroom, already being a bit late, so wanting to get ready quickly… well that was what she hoped for at least, but then she met her little brother Timmy in the bathroom. Timmy is 14 and sometimes can be a real nuisance. He is often lazy, messy and snippy. So Kimberly hoped for the best when she said &quot;Morning. Well I am a bit late, could you please brush your teeth somewhere else? I still have to get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Your bathroom time is over, now it&#39;s my turn. Why don&#39;t YOU go somewhere else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I have all my stuff here; make-up, toothbrush, jewelry and I wanted to have a quick shower as well. And you always just brush your teeth and go through your hair 3 times with a comb, if at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No means no, Kim. And now let me brush my teeth.&quot; he declared unaffectedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;~Timmy, go out now.~&quot; Kimberly said a bit more forcefully.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden Timmy turned around, still the toothbrush in his mouth, and left through the door, closing it behind him as well.<br />
&quot;Okay?&quot; Kimberly said, a bit irritated, but then stopped questioning his sudden change of mind; she still needed to get ready, so she hurried.<br />
<br />
<br />
After a quick shower, brushing her teeth and applying make-up she went down the stairs and got into the kitchen. She wore the outfit she already laid on her chair yesterday; a tight white tank top, knee high socks with tennis shoes, and pink shorts. Very ordinary she thought to herself but the outfits she wants to wear aren’t allowed by the dress code at her school. <br />
<br />
In the Kitchen she again met her brother, chewing some cereals while making himself a lunch box for school. Kimberly looked at the watch and saw that she had needed more time for getting ready than she thought, so she said &quot;Hey, brother. ~Give me your Peanut butter sandwich.~ I am late and you still have got time to make yourself another one.&quot;<br />
<br />
In her own ears it sounded a bit lame for an excuse, they both went to the same school and so had to get the same bus, but she still needed to put all her school stuff from the desk into her bag.<br />
<br />
To her surprise though Timmy didn&#39;t waver but immediately stretched out his hand with the prepared sandwich into her direction to take it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thanks. ~But I meant in a lunch box, duh?~&quot; she added sassily. And once again he did exactly as he was told without any hesitation. <br />
&quot;Here, Kimberly.&quot; he said not minding at all.<br />
<br />
After she took the box he simply took out two new slices of toast for his own sandwich.<br />
<br />
Kimberly was still stunned. Why was her brother all of a sudden doing these things, even without complaining? She wasn&#39;t asking  friendly neither, but he didn&#39;t mind. And somehow it wondered herself why she acted that harshly towards him. Yes, sometimes they would squabble a bit and then spoke this way, but most of the time in their family they spoke very polite with each other, just that Timmy and her were kind of a morning grouch.<br />
<br />
Yet today it kinda felt gooood to her to be harshly towards him. And him doing these things nonetheless somehow gave her tingles, which made her give in into a mischievous smirk.<br />
<br />
What Kimberly didn&#39;t know, or no longer, was that her wish settled that she now was as &#39;cruel&#39; as she perceived Jake to be when he tortured her, taking control of her and blemishing her own body. Maybe in his core he isn&#39;t that unmerciful, power-mad, loving to take advantage of others and humiliating those he is mad on with relish; despite that situation … but that was how Kimberly saw him in that moment, and that is now exactly what she feels to behave like; but all the time! It gets her satisfaction, fun and makes her feel powerful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kimberly just knew one thing: Something was very different with her brother this morning, and Kimberly felt the urge to test the boundaries of it a bit further… </p>
