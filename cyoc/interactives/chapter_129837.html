<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Principal Leonard was a generally a laid-back staff member at the school. Sure, he was very social conservative and was firmly rooted in his beliefs but he understood that people could disagreed with him. It came with the job of being principal, he thought. You had to get along with others in order to make the job work, and he wouldn&#39;t be principal right now if he hadn&#39;t learned to do so. That said, there were two things he didn&#39;t like: troublemakers and homosexuals. He believed they just caused mischief in the school. He only let the latter on that list slide because the mouth on that Luke was too good to ignore. The moment he turned 18, that boy couldn&#39;t keep his mouth off Leonard&#39;s dick, and the principal couldn&#39;t and, more importantly, wouldn&#39;t really complain. Besides, it wasn&#39;t like the boy wouldn&#39;t get what he wanted -- most of the male staff had already fucked him by now, and no one was in a position to complain. Still, the 40 year old&#39;s disgust for that orientation could not be ignored as he was walking towards the trio of boys in the Slut Team, the team Luke was the captain of, as they were making their way down the hall, barely able to keep their hands off each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking faggots,&quot; he cursed under his breath, to which Sean, who was jerking off to the scene unseen, nearly lost it and laughed as a result. This was too easy, he thought.<br />
<br />
The super senior in tow with the principal, Drew, couldn&#39;t say he disagreed with the principal&#39;s comment. He would be grouped into the first group the principal hated: troublemakers. Skipping classes, drugs on the side, multiple piercings and &quot;tough&quot; tattoos all over his body. He acted out cause of trouble at home, and it showed. He refused to submit to the stereotype of his Asian heritage and, as a result, he purposefully failed his senior year of high school and had to retake it. Not that it would matter, he thought. He was already going to drop out sometime this month. He didn&#39;t really have a plan after, he just knew it could be staying here. Nonetheless, for the time being, he kept his mouth shut; he was in enough trouble already and just because the principal said something didn&#39;t mean he was allowed to.<br />
<br />
But the principal did say something. Something that his original self would regret but his new self would be grateful for. His hair, silver as a sign of his age, was starting to turn back to its original red color. Irish by descent, he had two monikers to show it: the remaining specks  of red in his hair and the beer belly he has gained from too much alcohol and not enough gym. He put on a hand on his belly. Weird, he thought. Wasn&#39;t his stomach a lot bigger? It seemed to be less than before.<br />
<br />
Luke looked behind him and noticed the duo walking towards them and met Principal Leonard&#39;s eyes. He winked; such a cutie, he thought. The man was old enough to be his dad, and that thought turned him on. He whispered to his teammates and liutenant twinks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hotties, six o&#39;clock, boys,&quot; Luke said while squeezing Ry-Ry&#39;s ass. Mikey turned and flirted with the duo in his own way while Ry-Ry, not the smartest tool in the shed anymore, was slightly confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean these sexy cheeks?&quot; Ry-Ry asked, slapping them as if to confirm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and no honey&quot; Luke said in response. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go invite our guests in through the back door,&quot; and with a wink, they started to slow down to meet their new friends.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Leonard was confused by the boys&#39; actions. He should&#39;ve been angry, but instead he felt warm and flattered. These boys strutted around like this was a bathhouse, not a school. But wouldn&#39;t it be so hot if it was a bathhouse, he thought. He was taken aback by that thought. This was a school, for now, and until he made it a place where slutty twinks like him could roam and fuck freely, he had to maintain school order, he thought. Wait, he wasn&#39;t a slutty twink, right? What even was a twink? Oh, right, he was, he thought with a smile. A sexy, slutty, 35 year old twink. No, that can&#39;t be right,  he was only 27, right? His now completely red, curly hair was growing out and styling itself. That&#39;s right, he was 20 year old hot twink, he thought with a smirk as he ran his hands from his smooth, flat stomach to his juicy bubble butt. It was incredible that he was already the principal of the school given his age and young features-- he probably wouldn&#39;t have got the job if the board saw his nipple rings or his tattoos. Oh, who was he kidding. He got the job by sucking off and getting fucked by most of them, he mused. They all had to have seen the rings and the tattoo above his dick that said &quot;Please use the back door.&quot; It completed his look. On the outside, he was simply a freckled, cute red hair that wore tank tops and short shorts. By his standards, he looked like a virgin. It was only once they saw his lack of underwear (they were a waste of time) and his multiple piercings in the few places his clothes covered that they realized how much of a slut he was, he thought with a smirk. He giggled as the last bits of the Principal Leonard left his system. He was Principal Leo, a slutty, red-headed, twink with a passion for being naughty and &quot;discretely&quot; flaunting it. By the time the Slut Team had reached him, his transformation was already complete and he was ready to go a few rounds with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey boys, what&#39;s up?&quot; Leo said, reciprocating Luke&#39;s wink from earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much, we just wanted to check out the commotion from down the hall and see if we could, like, join in,&quot; responded Mikey with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s been, like, a few hours since this cute boypussy got fucked,&quot; Ry-Ry explained, smacking his ass again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds totes amazing!&quot; Leo said excitedly, ready for some new cock. Luke, responded by sloppily frenching him while squeezing his shrunken girth.<br />
<br />
Drew, for his part, was shocked. He saw Principal Leonard transform before his eyes and couldn&#39;t believe it, however, not being the smartest, couldn&#39;t figure out why it had happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you turn into such a flaming homo?!&quot; Drew yelled, initiating the transformation. As soon as the words left his lips, they got fuller as his lip piercing popped out of existence. His piercings started popping out of existence one by one and face started to look more twinkish.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean honey?&quot; Mikey responded. &quot;We&#39;ve always been like this,&quot; and with that and a naughty smirk he planted one right on Drew&#39;s lips. Ry-Ry, not wanting to be left out, started necking and feeling up the super senior.<br />
<br />
Drew&#39;s mind wanted to pull away but his body didn&#39;t. These sensations were so foreign. Sure, he had sexual experience before, but those girls were never able to make him feel like this. Almost all his tattoos and piercings had disappeared by now and his hours of work at the gym diminished more and more with each kiss planted on him. Why would he go to the gym? Boys wanted him lean and taut, not bulky of buff. That&#39;s why he ran; they practically encouraged him to show off skin and it made his ass look great, he thought with a giggle. A part of him was shocked. Why did he want to impress boys? Wasn&#39;t he completely straight? Sure, he had thought about guys every once in a while, but that didn&#39;t mean he always wanted to suck them off. He&#39;d only fuck them occasionally, and even if he preferred guys to girls, that didn&#39;t mean he was completely gay, right? Of course, it did, he mused. He couldn&#39;t even remember what he liked about girls; they were icky to him. His jeans started rising up and turned pink until they perfectly cupped his new bubble butt while his boxers had to morph into a speedo to accomodate. His shirt completely disappeared, never to be worn again. Florida wasn&#39;t a place to be wearing those things, he thought with a smirk. Mikey ran a hand through his faux hawk that was streaked with bright gold. He realized, as his cock grew to it&#39;s new shrunken 4&quot; in length, he had a plan after high school. He&#39;d spend every day he could on the beach, seducing any guy he could to fuck his cute boypussy. Maybe he stay a couple extra years here though--the senior class would have more boys turn 18 every other day, and that meant more boys to fuck.<br />
<br />
Drew, the cute, slutty Asian twink, smiled into Mikey&#39;s kiss. He pulled away for just a second, giving one last grope to Mikey&#39;s cock. &quot;Boys!&quot; he said with a grin and a lisp. &quot;I thought you said there was some cock you were trying to find!&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that they strutted once again towards the sexy moaning.</p>
