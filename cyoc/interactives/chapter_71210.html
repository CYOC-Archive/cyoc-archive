<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will clicked on the "template" button, curious as to what it was. As he suspected, it showed him a list of pre-made templates that could be applied to Troy's profile. He clicked the "females" section, a list of subsections appeared. He disregarded some of the sections, like: "animal", "anthropomorphic", "cartoon", etc. Most of those didn't interest him, but his cursor stopped at the "myth" section. His curiosity was piqued. More subsections below this one. As his eyes darted over them, he caught a glimpse of an even more intriguing section: "demon". With a double click he went down the hierarchy again, looking for a section he hoped existed. His cursor came to rest on exactly what he wanted. "Succubus", it said. Will felt a bit anxious, but remembered that Troy had given him the go-ahead. He could turn him into his ideal woman, and his ideal woman was a blue-skinned succubus by the name of "Astaroth".<br>
<br>
Apparently, she was a character from some kind of collectible card game from Japan. A Japanese imageboard had made her popular with fanart of her living a relatively normal life in the modern world. They had replaced the skimpy attire she wore with a casual and modern style, consisting mostly of T-shirts with odd prints and tight jeans or short shorts. Will loved this interpretation of her, and somewhere on his computer he had a folder full of Astaroth fanart. Often, the thought would creep into his mind that liking a fictional character to the point of having a crush on her, was quite pathetic. And at the moment the thought had surfaced again. He looked over his shoulder. Troy was still lying on his bed, staring at something on the ceiling. "You still want to do this?"<br>
<br>
Troy nodded. "Yeah. It's not a big deal if I can change back. You can change me back, right?"<br>
<br>
"There's a restore option," Will said, "You should be fine."<br>
<br>
"Go to work, then." Troy seemed annoyed.<br>
<br>
Will just nodded and picked a template that came close to what Astaroth looked like and began modifying it. He changed everything, down to the clothes, until he was satisfied with the results. He took a deep breath and accessed Troy's profile and selected the modified template, then he placed the cursor over the "apply" button. "Here it goes..." The click of his left mouse button could be heard.<br>
<br>
"Oh, wow!" Troy shot up from his bed. "I feel something!" His voice seemed slightly higher. Will turned around to see his roommate's face getting softer and rounder. "I'm getting pale," Troy said, looking at the back of his slimming hand, "Are you turning me into a goth chick?" Will was looking on in shock at the rapid transformation. "It's turning blue..." Troy's hands suddenly shot up to his temples. "What the hell?" His voice was really beginning to sound like a woman's.<br>
<br>
Will saw Troy's skin settle into the light blue of a morning sky. His lengthening hair soon followed and became a dark blue. Troy's eyes turned to Will, showing his sclera turning dark grey, while his irises were changing colour as well. Suddenly, he closed his eyes as his hands flew from his temples to just above his continuously more volumous butt. What his hands had been hiding was the growth of two thick, black, glossy horns. His eyes opened again. The sclera were now completely black, while his irises were a golden yellow with slitted pupils. "What is that thing above my ass...?" Troy was completely unaware of the changes to his visual organs. "Oh, god... It's a tail!"<br>
<br>
A whip-like tail wriggled above the straining denim. Like the horns, it was a glossy black. At the tip a lump formed that quickly took on a heart shape. "My dick is going!" Troy grabbed his (her?) crotch, letting her new tail wriggle about freely. Will saw that his roommate's jeans were really short, on the verge of showing nearly all of her shapely blue legs. They were becoming the short shorts he put into the template. Her T-shirt was rising up slightly as well, revealing a bit of her flat blue stomach. Will's eyes were then drawn to her chest. Beneath the T-shirt's were, as expected, two soft masses of flesh that were just about to stop growing.<br>
<br>
"I... I think I'm done. Ow!" As she said that, two earrings with red heart-shaped jewels appeared, one in each (now long and pointy) ear. The brand new succubus ran a slim hand over her leg. "Smooth..." She turned to Will. "Am I done?" Will blinked for a moment and then nodded. "Uhuh, yeah..." His transformed friend and roommate wriggled her toes and smiled. "This doesn't seem bad at all. Time to check myself out!" She jumped up from her sitting position with an unexpected energy. "Holy shit! I bounced! And not just my tits, my ass too," she said as she skipped towards their bathroom. Will pinched his arm and followed her into the bathroom.<br>
<br>
The blue-skinned demoness was already looking at her black and yellow eyes in amazement, pulling down an eyelid to see how far the black went. "Damn! My eye whites are black. They're eye blacks!" She traced her fingers over the thick horns as they curved forward to her forehead. "I have earrings?" She turned her head to the side to get a better look at her new pointy ears and the jewelry that had appeared on them as if by magic. "What am I?"<br>
<br>
"A succubus," Will said, stammering slightly.<br>
<br>
"A sex demon!?" Her cheeks turned a deeper shade of blue.<br>
<br>
Will nodded lightly, his own cheeks blushing. "You don't like it?"<br>
<br>
A smile appeared on Troy's beautiful new face. "Don't worry, man. I asked and you delivered. I'm not just a hot chick, I'm exotic as well."<br>
<br>
"Yeah..." Will was somewhat relieved. "You can change back, if you want."<br>
<br>
"This soon? A change like this should be savoured." She wiggled her narrow shoulders a little. "I'm wearing a bra." Her eyes then went down to her chest and the old pepsi logo on her T-shirt, raised her eyebrow for a second and then burst into laughter. She hadn't seen it immediately because she was looking into a mirror, but the lettering on the logo said something quite different from the expected 'pepsi'. "'Penis'! It says 'penis'!"<br>
<br>
Will laughed awkwardly along with her. "Yeah, that's my doing..."<br>
<br>
Troy surprised him with an intimate hug, her breasts squishing against him. He felt her soft leg brush against the erection he had been hiding for the last few minutes. "Couldn't help but laugh," she said still giggling, "I feel a little lame for laughing so hard."<br>
<br>
"It's alright," Will said nervously. His face was getting a deep red hue. "You... you seem to be enjoying yourself."<br>
<br>
"It's just all so weird and cool," the demoness said, "I want to check all this stuff out."<br>
<br>
"Wha... what do you mean?"</p>
