<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You sat down, looking ahead at the brand new Wanda Aleman. It was so strange, you’d known her the better part of four years and within the last half hour she’d completely transformed, and it really felt like she’d been this way the entire time.<br />
That bathroom trip was… pleasurable, and absolutely confirmed that all of this was real. But you had more questions, and only one way to get answers.<br />
“So did you pick anything?” You asked,<br />
“Just a croissant, not feeling too hungry,”<br />
“As usual,” you tease. She’d never been someone who eats a lot, rather telling looking at her thin frame,<br />
“Thanks for that,” she smirked.<br />
<br />
“Here you are miss,” the waitress arrived, placing the slightly warmed up croissant on the table in front of her,<br />
“Amazing. Thank you,” she replied,<br />
“No worries,” the waitress said. She then turned to you, “can I offer you anything from our selection?” She asked,<br />
“Oh um…” you look over at Wanda. You notice her staring right at the waitress’ ass. You hadn’t considered it until now, but Wanda being a lesbian was never a question, “I wouldn’t mind a slice of the chocolate cake,” you replied,<br />
“On it,” she said with a wink. A part of you naturally assumed she could be in to you, but you weren’t likely to go anywhere with it. She walked off to get your treat,<br />
Wanda leaned over to whisper, “nice ass, huh,” she chuckled,<br />
“I thought she was sweet,”<br />
“Yeah yeah… but we’re not talking about personality here. Or… I guess we are,” she giggled at herself. You chuckled in response, then wondered.<br />
Under your breath, you said, “I wish that waitress had an even bigger ass,”<br />
“What did you say?” Wanda asked before taking a bite of the croissant in front of her,<br />
“Oh I said… I…” you had another idea, “I said I wish you were eating chocolate cake,” you experimented.<br />
As the words left your mouth, you watched as the food on Wanda’s plate shifted from a uniquely folded pastry to a simple slice of chocolate cake. In fact, you watched as her mouth filled up with a larger quantity of food, she seemed to stutter as she struggled to get it down,<br />
“You okay?” You asked. She finally managed to swallow, almost coughing afterwards,<br />
“Agh… sorry,” she apologised, “guess I just ate a little too much all at once,” she uncomfortably replied. She lifted up her tea to take a sip, trying to wash down the food you didn’t eat properly.<br />
You couldn’t help but feel a little bad, you decided to say, “I wish you didn’t struggle so much on that slice of cake,” with the intention of removing that uncomfortable even from history. You watched as Wanda’s facial expression changed. She sipped her tea with a much more comfortable look on her face, then something else…<br />
<br />
“Here you are,” the waitress said, placing the plate in front of you. You quickly looked down to find that you’d been given a single croissant,<br />
“Uhm…” you said, trying to not make a fuss, “I thought I asked for a slice of cake?”<br />
“Did you!?” She replied, startled. You looked up at her, seeing a look of panic on her face, “I’m so so sorry!” She said, taking the plate,<br />
“N-no it’s okay, I actually…” you turned and watched as she quickly rushed away to correct her ‘mistake’. But you were right, as she rushed off, you took note of her ass. It was significantly bigger, in fact it seemed to have strained her work pants. You could actually see her panties poking out,<br />
“Still a nice ass,” Wanda said, jokingly,<br />
“You have no idea…” you replied, turning back to face her. But as you did, you noticed Wanda’s face. It was just slightly softer looking. Maybe a little rounder. She was by no means fat, but undeniably a little bigger. Maybe a side-effect of your wish. Then you realised… you’d been making all these wishes in front of her, and she hadn’t once questioned you.<br />
<br />
“Have I said anything weird today?” You asked,<br />
“Huh?” She replied, “like… in what way?”<br />
“I mean, in a way that felt… kind of ‘out-of-place’?”<br />
“Uhm… not that I can think of. Asking if I’d ‘seen a woman’ was kinda out of pocket, but not really,”<br />
“Okay…”<br />
<br />
“Here you are!” A voice said from behind. The waitress looked very embarrassed, “again, I’m so sorry. I usually don’t mess up orders like that. I don’t know what came over me,”<br />
“It’s okay! Really,” you said, trying your best to not make her feel uncomfortable. But then had another idea, “maybe… I guess as an apology I wish you could… sit on my friends lap?”<br />
“Of course! It’d be the least I could do,” she said in the sincerest way. She didn’t seem to take in any wrong way. She made her way over to Wanda and sat herself down on her lap. Wanda’s eyes looked pretty shocked, but she was hardly complaining. They were acting as if this was a normal thing to happen, just that you’d just asked politely. As if this was accepted.<br />
After maybe thirty seconds, Wanda finally said, “o-okay…” awkwardly, “thank you for that,” she smirked. The waitress started getting up, “apology totally accepted,” Wanda said, looking at you and winking,<br />
“Please, let me know if there’s anything else you need from me. My name is Heather, just ask my name I’ll be right over,”<br />
<br />
As Heather walked away, you had to look at her swaying hips and huge round ass. After all that, it seemed her pants had slid down slightly further, revealing more of her panties. She grabbed the sides and pulled it up, hiding everything but the shape of her bubble butt.<br />
“That was intense,” Wanda said, “but thanks,”<br />
“For that? Why thanks?”<br />
“I mean, you let her sit on my lap instead of yours. I at least owe you a drink for that,” she smirked,<br />
“So wait… is that a normal thing?”<br />
“Not really, it’s an apology favour… why are you asking?” She asked, a little puzzled,<br />
“Right…” you said, “So that’s just a normal thing?”<br />
“Yeah. Are you okay?” She chuckles, “why the hell are you asking all these questions?”<br />
“I’m just… curious if… our knowledge matches,”<br />
“You’re being weird, man,” Wanda said, “I don’t know how much of a bimbo you think I am, but I know about Apology Favours… you wanna ask me if I know about high-fives next?” She said, clearly a tiny bit offended.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, right,” you say, then smirk, “what can I do as an apology?”</p>
