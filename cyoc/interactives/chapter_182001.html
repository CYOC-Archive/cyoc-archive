<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Confirmed selection: Lamia<br />
Proceeding to next phase....<br />
Beginning auto-character creation.<br />
Integrating current user&#39;s player data into their new player model....<br />
Integration complete!<br />
Updating user....&quot; <br />
<br />
Andrea read the prompt before here eyes, but had to react half way through as she suddenly fell forward after losing all feeling in the lower half of her body. From her waist down, it felt as if it was completely gone, not just numb, but as if it didn&#39;t exist entirely. And because her vision was completely blocked by the game&#39;s screen, she couldn&#39;t see what was going on either. <br />
<br />
Panicking now, Andrea frantically began blindly grabbing at her legs. She could feel them still there with her hands, but they also felt very different than normal. They were much too... scaly? After roughly a minute of blindly feeling up her one leg since she couldn&#39;t for some reason locate her other, she regained total feeling of below her waist once again. She could now feel her hands grabbing at her leg. But just her leg. There was no other leg that she could feel. And her only leg&#39;s thigh was massively thicc, easily equal to her hips in size. It also felt extremely long too, as if it was now well over twice her height at least. And she couldn&#39;t feel any of her toes besides her big toe, and even that felt odd and disfigured too. <br />
<br />
The next thing she knew, was that her head underwent the same process. First it feels like it is gone, then it returns, but feels different. This time her mouth had the same feel to the outside at least. But inside of it was greatly different. Her 2 upper canine teeth were very different, both becomming incredibly long and curved down and back slightly to a sharp point. They didnt interfere with her ability to move her jaw though, nor did she seem able to stab herself with them, which was good to know. Her tongue was split down the center at the tip,  separating it into 2 halves. Her now forked tongue was also much longer, able to extend out several feet from her mouth too. Lastly, she didn&#39;t seem to have a hard set stopping point for how wide she could open her mouth up now. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck&#39;sss going on wisss me? Wait... why do I have a lissssssp now? Why a lisssssp? Damn it, can thissss possssibly get any worsssss?&quot; Frustratingly complained Andrea to her empty bedroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;User&#39;s player model update complete!<br />
Updating user&#39;s knowledge to now include how their new player model moves about and other important information which is very necessary to know....<br />
Update complete.<br />
The system will return to active standby for aprox: 2 hours. Then will resume final game initialization process.<br />
User may begin the final process early by pressing the skip button next to the 2 hour countdown timer.<br />
Attempting to restore user&#39;s vision with included augmented reality update....<br />
Vision restoration successful!<br />
Minimizing start-up view.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrea could once again see the &quot;real world&quot;, albeit with the semi-transparent GUI of the system still in the lower left hand corner. But she could see everything that happened to her now. Looking behind her back, she could clearly see her now roughly 30 ft long snake tail coiled all about her bedroom. Just the sight sent a chill down her spine, which now took a great deal longer to feel as it went down now all the way to the tip of her tail. The scales were deep purple, with a black crisscross pattern, almost like it was in a fishnet, and ran all the way up to just below her asscheeks, and wrapped around her new cloaca, which had replaced her pussy. <br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror at her face revealed that she still looked mostly human in that reguard. Save for her now longer, pointed ears and slited, bright green eyes, which contrasted against her red hair. The underside of her tail also was a lightish pink with a gray tinge to it. She opened her mouth slowly, and saw her new fangs, which she immediately disliked. But then kept on opening up her mouth, until her jaw literally unhinged itself and allowed her mouth to open up to a truely ridiculous size. She stuck out her thinner, forked tongue to its limit, which was about 2 feet. She had a surprising level of control over it too. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is when her A/C turned on. Andrea immediately began to feel a bit sluggish and cold, way too cold. The A/C was pumping in the cool air. And with her already small room, becomming even smaller with her tail taking up so much space, the room didn&#39;t take long at all to cool down. By the time she realized what was up, Andrea had to, with what limited movement she had left, dive her upper body over to her bedside table to grab the remote and turn off the A/C. She managed to do that, however the damage was already done. Her room was now uncomfortably too cold, and she was not able to warm up her entire tail with just her upper body heat. <br />
<br />
Thankfully she was able to crack open her window before she fell into a shivering heap. But with the warm air outside pouring in through her window with a warm breeze, she regained her lost body heat soon enough. &quot;F-fuck. No A/C anymore I g-guesssss.&quot; Andrea stated while still shivering a bit. She was regaining more movement in her tail again amd slowly began to cool it up underneath and around her as she repositioned herself into the sunlight comming in through her window. Moving was surprisingly easy thanks to the system updating her knowledge on how to do it. She could move quite naturally, right off the bat. Andrea also took off all of her remaining clothes so she could feel the sun on her skin directly. Her large boobs also felt nice finally being free from her too tight and improperly designed shirt.<br />
<br />
She felt a bit awkward looking down at her chest. On one hand, she was disturbed that she now had huge boobs, but on the other hand, she was getting turned on by them too. They were a perfect combination of being both soft and firm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ssssso I guesssss I am a snake girl now? What wassss it again? A Lamia? Better look it up before ssssssomething elsssssse happenssssss.&quot; Andrea said to herself, grabbing her phone to do some research. She continued to look at various websites while basking, and with one of her hands idly fondling one of her boobs absentmindedly.</p>
