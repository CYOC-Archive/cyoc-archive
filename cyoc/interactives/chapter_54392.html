<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I do not like this,&quot; Shannon announces, wondering why she never listens to her inner voice and just leaves when problems and events get too big for her to handle.<br />
<br />
Looking at Cole/Geneva, Prudence thought over everything thing her former brother and her had just explained, looking for another answer and another way out of their current predicament. Not seeing one, she explained, &quot;It's the only logical answer. And it just might solve so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but,&quot; Shannon started and stopped as Cole said, &quot;If you have another solution, I am all ears. Because, technically, I am not looking forward to being a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you use the amulet, if this plan will work, on some clothes belonging to a boy,&quot; Shannon asked.<br />
<br />
Cole looked at Prudence and then explained, &quot;Because. If this works, I would probably become male, but I would still not be myself,&quot; and seeing that Shannon was about to ask another question, she cut her off by saying, &quot;And I don't want to try it with some brand new clothes belonging to a boy. I have a feeling they would turn me into a male version of Geneva, which might cause several more problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What sort of problems,&quot; Shannon demands, suddenly suspicious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there is the matter that Geneva's family had a girl, not a boy. If this works, it might have a negative ripple effect in the future. And it might have a negative effect on out friendship,&quot; Prudence explained.<br />
<br />
Looking at the two girls, Shannon finally stated, &quot;I don't like it. You want to turn yourself into a six year old version of yourself? That's crazy.<br />
<br />
Cole/Geneva looked at Prudence and then back at Shannon and the replied, &quot;Yes it is crazy. But, like I said before, if you got another suggestion, then I would like to hear it. Otherwise I...and I am sure Prudence will join me...plan to find some age appropriate clothes and correct this situation as best as I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at her two best friends, Shannon held up her hands and standing, she said, &quot;Count me out.&quot; and turning, she started to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Prudence exclaimed and standing, she said, &quot;You aren't going to help us? Or even be with us when we do this? Not even to be our friend and maybe still hang out with us? This is your choice? Walking away?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stopping in the doorway, Shannon turned and did not saying anything for a moment. After a bit she opened her mouth to saying something, closed it, whispered something that sounded like, &quot;I cannot deal with this,&quot; and then simply said, &quot;Goodbye.&quot; and turning about, she exited the room, leaving Cole/Geneva and Prudence watching her back.<br />
<br />
Sitting back down, Prudence muttered, &quot;Maybe we should rethink this,&quot; but Cole shook her head and stated, &quot;If you do not want to go through with this, I'll understand. But I am going through with it. I cannot be a seventeen year old girl with only natural instincts to get me by.&quot; and standing, she looked at her former sister and said, &quot;If you want to go with Shannon, I'll understand,&quot; and turning, she started to leave the room.<br />
<br />
Watching her former brother leave, Prudence's mind flashed through different scenarios and just as the other girl was about to leave, she called out, &quot;Wait,&quot; and standing she said, &quot;I'm with you all the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moments later the two girls where down in the basement and as Cole/Geneva slipped the amulet into a sandwich bag and then tucked it into her pocket, Prudence began to sort through all the boxes her mother kept containing all her clothes from when she had been a young girl.<br />
<br />
Finding the box marked 'Prudence, Age Five' Prudence pulled open the box and began sorting through the clothes, asking, &quot;What do you think I should wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole/Geneva peered over her friends should, but after moment she said, &quot;Just pick something you think would be appropriate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selecting a bright pink and purple one-piece bathing suit, Prudence pulled out a pair of shorts with a slight stain on the front, set them aside and then extracted a tank-top and a pair of sandals, explaining, &quot;I know the perfect place for us to try and transform ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at the clothes, Cole asked, &quot;Why can we not do it hear or at my place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because,&quot; Prudence explained as she folded the clothes up and placed them into a backpack with Hello Kitty on the front. &quot;I think we need to be away so that reality can adjust to out new forms. And that includes our families and places of residence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing logic in this, Cole nodded and leading the way upstairs, she asked, &quot;Where did you have in mind,&quot; as they collected their shoes.<br />
<br />
As they left, Prudence replied cryptically, &quot;You'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, Prudence pointed to the stall that over looked the lake about two blocks from her house, telling Cole as she did so, &quot;We try and transform in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casting a dubious at the stall and then looking up at the deepening night sky, Cole finally asked, &quot;What happens if it is dark after we have transformed?&quot; and then started to follow Prudence, who was already heading for the woman's toilet and changing stall.<br />
<br />
Pushing on the door, Prudence explained, &quot;We deal with things as they come out way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Cole dropped her backpack and unzipping the top, she took out her swimwear, noting the unicorn on the front and thinking that it was cute, she asked, &quot;So which one of us should go first,&quot; as she pulled the amulet from her pocket.<br />
<br />
Prudence looked at it and after a moment, she said, &quot;I'll go first,&quot; and taking the amulet, still in the baggy, she unzipped her pack and pulled her swimsuit out.<br />
<br />
Looking at her former brother, she grinned and said, &quot;Here looking up your old address,&quot; and pulling the amulet from the bag, she touched it to her bathing suit, scrunching close her eyes just before she made the contact with her skin, the garment and the amulet.<br />
<br />
Immediately there was a bright flash and Prudence began to rapidly lose height. Watching in amazement, praying that it would also work for her and not be some sort of one-time-only deal, Geneva/Cole watched as Prudence's clothes ballooned around her and she quickly aged back from seventeen to fifteen to eleven and then to finally five year old.<br />
<br />
Holding out her hands, opening up her eyes, Prudence squeaked out, &quot;It worked,&quot; as she dropped the amulet onto her backpack...where it slid to the floor...and then began looking at herself.<br />
<br />
A look of awe flashed over Cole/Geneva's face and reaching down, careful not to touch anything of Prudence's, she picked up the amulet.<br />
<br />
Touching it to her swimsuit and at the same time her hand, Cole prayed once again that it worked.<br />
<br />
Another bright flash and suddenly everything around her began to grow as a sense of vertigo and being pushed downward washed over her. Giggling suddenly, Cole peered down, watching as her pants and underwear puddled at her feet and her shirt grew several sizes bigger as her body aged back, quickly shedding all that it gained during puberty and redistributing some lost baby fat.<br />
<br />
Moments later, the transformation was complete and the two girls merely stood looking at each other, only partially aware of their nudity. And then, suddenly, they both began to giggle as they started to race each other, seeing who could get dressed the fastest.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do with this,&quot; Prudence asked after they were dressed in there swim attires.<br />
<br />
Looking at the amulet, having trouble remembering where she had seen it before, Geneva grasped it and suddenly said, &quot;I have just the place,&quot; and kicking her teenage clothes under a sink, she headed for the stalls.<br />
<br />
Inside, she looked at the toilet and then looked down it. Seeing the goop at the bottom, she dropped the medallion into the sludge and watching it sink, she suddenly turned and racing out of the stall, she grabbed her backpack as Prudence said, &quot;Come on,&quot; and then dashed out of the lavatory.<br />
<br />
Giggling some more, forgetting more and more of her old life, her mind emptying and preparing to refill itself with her new life, Geneva called out, &quot;Wait up,&quot; and followed after.<br />
<br />
Inside the toilet, the Amulet of Zulo slowly sank into the sludge. As it did so, it slowly started to turn transparent and then after a bit, it vanished, moving as its magick directed it to, before it finally settled and was found by another.</p>
