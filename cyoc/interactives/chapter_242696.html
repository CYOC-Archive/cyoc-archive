<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was meant to be an easy night, but the young couple soon learned that nothing would be so easy. Chase and his girlfriend, Andromeda, had both volunteered to watch both Caleb and Gloria&#39;s boys along with Connor and Spark&#39;s kids, that included Kaida who was there for additional help with her younger siblings and cousins at Connor&#39;s house. Caleb, Gloria, Spark, Connor, as well as Nina Moreland were asked to come into S.P.E.A.R. to help and try find out as much as they could about Seraphim and the Superior Church.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Hank and Colton shouldn&#39;t be too much to handle, it&#39;s the older ones you&#39;ve got to pay attention to.&quot; Spark warned her brother in-law.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on now Spark, the kids love their uncle Chase and I know they definitely love Andromeda, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve got this down.&quot; Chase promised Spark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just the same, Gloria and I prepared a few notes for you. Here are mine,&quot; Spark said handing Chase an index card with information about the kids on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here&#39;s the one for my kids,&quot; Gloria said handing Andromeda her list which looked like a short piece of paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this doesn&#39;t look....&quot; Andromeda began to say before the paper unfolded down to the ground. &quot;.....that bad?&quot; Andromeda said cringing.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got to be going, but all the info we have for them is on those papers.&quot; Gloria said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And also remember the kids each have a bed time, so make sure they&#39;re in bed at the right time.&quot; Spark said as she and Gloria went to Caleb&#39;s truck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you heard my mom, my siblings have their own bed time.&quot; Kaida smirked at her uncle and Andromeda.<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT INCLUDES YOU KAIDA, YOU HAVE YOUR OWN BEDTIME!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;BUT MOM! I&#39;m 12, I don&#39;t have to have a bed time anymore!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;TOUGH COOKIES! Be good for your uncle Chase and Andromeda! Love you, kisses!&quot; Spark shouted from the truck as they all waved goodbye.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got this, right?&quot; Andromeda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I mean, how hard is babysitting kids compared to fighting the supernatural?&quot; Chase asked as they walked into the house to see Kaida reading a book while her younger siblings and cousins were playing uproariously.<br />
<br />
Chase and Andromeda now spent the next several minutes trying to keep the young Morelands entertained and happy. Andromeda helped settle a dispute between Hank and Colton over a toy. Meanwhile Chase was playing one against four against Jay, Cali, David, and Marcus in a Nerf shoot out. A few foam darts shot at Hank and Colton by mistake after Andromeda had just got them to stop fighting, now they were crying. Meanwhile, Kaida was still reading her book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaida, I could use a little help here.&quot; Andromeda said to the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just let them cry it out, they&#39;ll get tired eventually.&quot; Kaida said as Andromeda rolled her eyes seeing that the girl was no help. Andromeda now grabbed both Hank and Colton and soothed them both to stop as best as she could and they both calmed down.<br />
<br />
Andromeda now looked over to see Chase being overpowered by his niece and nephews. The NERF war had escalated into a wrestling match, Chase body slamming the kids onto couches with uproarious laughter. Unfortunately, the kids team work was slowly wearing down Chase as Jay and David launched themselves off a bookshelf as Marcus hit his uncle in the knee. Knocked down, Andromeda now watched as Cali flew through the air delivering a flying elbow to Chase&#39;s stomach.<br />
<br />
Thinking Chase had had enough, Andromeda stepped in-between Chase and the kids with her hands on her hips glaring at the rambunctious children as they looked worried now and stopped what they were doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s enough raucous for now. How about we play a quiet game before dinner....like....twenty questions?&quot; Andromeda suggested.<br />
<br />
The kids were unsure before they saw Andromeda tapping her foot and decided to go along with it. Allowing Chase enough time to recover from Cali knocking the wind out of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss &#39;Dromy, what&#39;s twenty questions?&quot; Cali asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just it Cali, you ask me and your uncle Chase questions and we answer them.&quot; Andromeda answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;How come our parents are worried about this new bad guy?&quot; David asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, this person is....a bully and they&#39;re related to someone else that was also a big bully. So they&#39;re all trying to figure out how to stop the bully.&quot; Chase answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t they just ask the bully to stop?&quot; Marcus asked Chase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....Andromeda&#39;s turn.&quot; Chase said not sure how to answer the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are your mommy and daddy nice?&quot; Jay asked Andromeda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, they&#39;re nice if you&#39;re nice to them.&quot; Andromeda replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were my mommy and daddy not nice to your mommy and daddy then?&quot; David now asked Andromeda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, well....uncle Chase&#39;s turn again.&quot; Andromeda said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is your hair so pretty?&quot; Cali now asked not directly asking either of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Herbal essence shampoo.&quot; Andromeda and Chase both said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you both want to have kids one day?&quot; Jay now asked them.<br />
<br />
Chase and Andromeda looked at each other, blushing, before responding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Chase and Andromeda both said at the same time again.<br />
<br />
Before the older kids could ask another question, they all heard little Hank and Colton&#39;s stomach&#39;s growling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like someone&#39;s hungry for dinner, so who wants,&quot; Chase looked at the card Gloria left them real quickly. &quot;Macaroni and cheese?&quot; Chase asked as all the kids cheered.<br />
<br />
Chase and Andromeda definitely weren&#39;t the best cooks, which is where it was good that Gloria had cooked up some wagon wheel macaroni and cheese for everyone before they left for the night. Andromeda and Chase helped both Hank and Colton into their high chairs and began feeding them while they got plates of food out for everyone else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Colton, it&#39;s good for you.&quot; Andromeda tried to say to Colton who refused to eat the food. Andromeda now had a thought as she closed her eyes before opening them to give her puppy dog eyes at Colton.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Colton, I promise they&#39;re really good.&quot; Andromeda asked as Colton opened his mouth for the pretty girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someday you&#39;re going to have to teach me that trick miss Andromeda, maybe it&#39;ll get me out of homework.&quot; Kaida said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I tried that on my parents once. It did not work, they made sure I got my work done. And yes, just because I grew up in a fancy castle, doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t get an education.&quot; Andromeda said to Kaida.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, the kids were done eating and Chase and Andromeda had the kids all brushing their teeth before they went to bed, except for Kaida who went to bed later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle Chase, Cali and I want to hear a bed time story. Can you tell us a bed time story about a knight and princess?&quot; Jay asked as Cali nodded along with her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Marcus and I want to hear one too,&quot; David agreed just as Marcus whispered into his ear. &quot;Oh, but Marcus says he doesn&#39;t want it to be too scary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I think I can make up a story for you guys about that.&quot; Chase said as Andromeda whispered something into his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I know just how it starts: once upon a time, there was a brave knight who was making his way through the forest, when he suddenly heard a damsel cry out in distress.&quot; Chase said as Andromeda was on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help! Oh, someone help me! A savage wolf is after me!&quot; Andromeda said pretending to call out for help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fear not princess I&#39;ll rescue you! Begone savage beast!&quot; Chase said heroically and tossed aside a stuffed wolf toy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my hero. Good sir knight, I should thank you somehow....&quot; Andromeda said as Chase and Andromeda leaned in for a kiss before Andromeda turned her head quickly. &quot;I know! You are cordially invited to my castle for a night at the royal ball.&quot; Andromeda said as the young kids giggled at the almost kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it means seeing your beautiful face again, I agree, until then fair maiden.&quot; Chase said kissing Andromeda&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;So at last the night of the royal ball came and the handsome knight rode to the ball, when he suddenly saw that the castle was being attacked by a dragon!&quot; Chase said motioning for Kaida to pretend to be a dragon but she shook her head indicating that she didn&#39;t want to. Chase then motioned towards the young kids to keep them happy and Kaida sighed and went along with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a terrifying dragon, roar! ROAR! ROAR!&quot; Kaida said playing along and shaking the kids beds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help! Is there anyone who can save my family from this beast?!&quot; Andromeda asked in playful call for help.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll rid your castle of this dragon my lady!&quot; Chase said as he and Kaida pretended to fight one another before Chase pretended to stab Kaida who fell backwards onto the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! I&#39;m dead! Now all I can do is crawl to my own bed.&quot; Kaida said as she crawled out of the room as the younger kids giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I&#39;ve rescued you princess, will you marry me?&quot; Chase asked heroically holding Andromeda in his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes mighty knight, I shall.&quot; Andromeda said as she and Chase now kissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want a lullaby.&quot; Marcus suddenly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that Marcus?&quot; Chase now asked his nephew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna hear a lullaby. Mommy sings lullabies, I want lullaby.&quot; Marcus demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....uh...I guess so. That is if miss Andromeda is a good singer.&quot; Chase said winking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my gram gram and miss Cheyenne did give me singing lessons. It&#39;s not just for animals.&quot; Andromeda said as she now stood away from chase and cleared her throat before singing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me, starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee; Sounds of the rude world, heard in the day, lull&#39;d by the moonlight have all passed away.&quot; Andromeda sang in a beautiful angelic soprano voice.<br />
<br />
She now went around the room tucking in the young Moreland children as they listened to her sing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song, list while I woo thee with soft melody; Gone are the cares of life&#39;s busy throng, beautiful dreamer, awake unto me. Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me.&quot; Andromeda finished singing and came over to Chase who was also mesmerized by her beautiful singing voice and the two gave an even more passionate kiss on the lips before going outside to look up at the stars.</p>
