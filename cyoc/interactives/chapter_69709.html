<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No... no, I want this. You two have done so much for me already. You helped me as I've struggled with my <br />
sexuality and have shown me so many new pleasures. After all that, it would be my honor to join you two.&quot; Mark <br />
said as he went closer to Tom as he was finishing the last stages of his transformation; his spine detaching <br />
to become a tail and his eyes changing to those of his dog form.<br />
<br />
Mark sat down on the bed that Tom, or rather Titus, was lay on. Looking at the throbbing canine member in <br />
front of him, he contemplated whether or not he was doing the right thing, giving himself one last chance to <br />
reconsider but decided he wanted it. Grabbing hold of the panting dog's cock, Mark put it into his mouth and <br />
instantly knew he needed it. Starting off slow, Mark worked up a steady motion, taking only a couple of inches <br />
in at a time.<br />
<br />
Titus whimpered as he felt his member starting to become engorged; his knot swelling fast. Noticing his, Jeff <br />
walked over to his husband, giving him a scratch behind the ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know boy...&quot; he said as he started rubbing his own crotch, smirking as he grabbed Mark's head and pushed <br />
him down on to the base of Titus' raging cock, the knot filling up quickly in his mouth &quot;Sorry Mark but Titus <br />
really  wants you to get right in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gagging on the member, Mark started to quickly breathe through his nose like the guys had shown him before <br />
during one of their kinkier sessions. He then started to go much quicker on the dog as he heard the panting <br />
increasing, shorter gaps between each one. &quot;Looks like he's close Mark, better get ready for this because it's <br />
going to be-&quot; Jeff managed to get out before his canine husband howled, shooting a powerful load straight to <br />
the back of Mark's throat. &quot;...Strong&quot; Jeff finished as rubbed Titus' belly as the dog lay panting in the <br />
afterglow.<br />
<br />
Mark quickly had to swallow the load so he didn't choke on it. Pushing the dog's member out of his jaw as it <br />
started to revert back to Tom, Mark started to feel funny. Getting to the top of the bed, he started to feel a <br />
slight pain in his ribs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Mark, the one thing we didn't tell you about this is the first transformation isn't like the others. In <br />
a few seconds it's going to start to hurt as your bone structure starts to change. Don't worry though, it'll <br />
only last for a minute&quot; Jeff said as put his hands on Mark's chest, trying to reassure him that everything <br />
would be okay. Then the first changes started.<br />
<br />
His rib cage was the first place that it happened as they moved around, becoming more canine. Then his arms <br />
and legs started to shift to a more quadrupedal stance. Mark struggled around as the pain became intense with <br />
his mouth and nose expanding out, turning into a muzzle. Mark tried to speak, to tell his friends how much it <br />
hurt but instead, he made whining noises as his vocal chords readjusted to match his new form. Next he felt <br />
pushing at the end of his spine as his naked tail formed out of it. His ears then started to stretch out and <br />
move up his head, causing him to flinch as the pain struck him. Tom and Jeff held him, stroking him and <br />
comforting him as the pain of the first transformation took hold.<br />
<br />
The pain started to dull down as the changes to bones finished with his fingers and toes shrinking to become <br />
paws, matching his new set of legs. Mark start panting as he felt the worst of it over. Unbeknownst to him <br />
though, a fleshy sheath started to form over his cock shortly before the hair around his crotch started to <br />
thicken out, spreading along his body quickly and becoming more fur-like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, looks like somebody's going into the final stages. Wouldn't you say so, Jeff?&quot; Tom asked as he gave a <br />
wink to lover, giving a quick glance to the growing member of their friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'd say MAX is about ready for some action. How about it, boy? Want Jazz and Titus to show you how dogs <br />
do it?&quot; Jeff replied before asking their quickly changing dog buddy if he wanted to have his first canine <br />
experience. Max barked as the fur crept up his body, a red tip sticking out of his sheath.<br />
<br />
Jeff and Tom immediately both started messing with Max, rubbing his furry sheath as the tip started to grow <br />
out of it, as both of them started their transformations in their German Shepherd forms. Before long, Jeff's <br />
lower body had changed into Jazz, his tail swishing in front of Max's muzzle as he revealed his open whole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on boy, you know you want it!&quot; Jeff said before he fully changed into Jazz. Both Jazz and Titus were <br />
larger than Max though Jazz was only slightly bigger than him. Max gave his canine buddy a sniff of the butt <br />
and a few friendly licks as he positioned himself to mount the dog. Placing his forelegs on the hips of his <br />
partner, Max pushed inside, knotting him instantly. The bigger dog howled as he felt the member press into his <br />
ass. At the same time, Titus had moved his way around to Max's jutting hole as he was pressed inside Jazz's <br />
rear. Titus lifted himself on Max's back and entered the other dog. Jazz felt the weight shift and was forced <br />
downward as his legs buckled under it. The added pressure from his now-dog husband had sent him over the edge <br />
in pleasure as he could feel himself about to come.<br />
<br />
Titus had been sent into a lustful state as he could feel himself already about to shoot his load into Max. <br />
Quickly pushing forward, he knotted the other dog making Max whimper as it stretched his unsuspecting hole. <br />
The larger dog increased his force, pushing into the dog underneath him so hard that Max was being pushed <br />
further into Jazz. Jazz let go of any resistance as he howled, shooting a long stream of doggy cum onto the <br />
bed sheets. Titus then went, hitting his climax and blowing straight into the young pup beneath him.<br />
<br />
Max, feeling the warmth spreading inside him, started to pick up the pace on Jazz's hole. Getting close, Max <br />
howled and pushed in further, cumming deep into the depths of his German Shepherd boss. As he felt his Titus' <br />
load start to leak out of his filled hole, Max started to feel sleepy, passing out straight on the bed.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Mark, now back in human form, work up under the sheets of a familiar bed. He was between <br />
both Jeff and Tom who were sleeping in the nude, a strong musky scent lingering in the air from the night <br />
before. Mark lifted up his arm and gave his pit a whiff, getting an incredibly powerful mix of sweat and dog <br />
up his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that's nice. Should probably get a shower though.&quot; he thought as he got up. Attempting to move over Jeff <br />
to get to the bathroom, he woke him up and got his face pulled in for a long smooch against the man and his <br />
thick beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mornin' pup. You look great.&quot; Jeff said, getting a semi as their junk touched.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Mark asked, puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take a look in the mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark walked over to the corner of the room where there was a standing mirror, large enough for him to get a <br />
good look at himself. The first thing he noticed was that his chest was now hairy and muscled. The rest of his <br />
body was well defined too, much of it also covered in a good amount of body hair too. He'd grown too. Before <br />
he'd been about 5'7&quot; but now he was just an inch short of Jeff's 6'. He still wasn't as big as Tom. The giant <br />
was 6'5&quot; and had the body to match it in all areas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love the new ass too&quot; Jeff said as he walked over, spreading the pup's cheeks apart &quot;Yep, so much more hair <br />
than before. Looks good on you; manly. Now let's see how much your junk has grown because I don't remember it <br />
ever looking that large before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sticking his face right in, Jeff rimmed Mark's hole, making the pup hard. He was definitely larger. Whilst <br />
before he'd only been about 5 and 1/2&quot;, he was now definitely hitting about 8&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey come on guys. If you're going to start frolicking around, at least wake me up first- WOOF! Mark, you <br />
certainly changed overnight!&quot; Tom said, moving his way over to the mirror as he started stroking the pup's <br />
cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH FUCK!&quot; Mark shouted as the two made him shoot a load. The overwhelming hormones still lingering in his <br />
system made too sensitive to hold on. Tom walked over to the mirror and in one lick, cleaned off the spunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, salty&quot; he said, pushing his lips against Mark for a quick kiss &quot;Now go on, get a shower. We've got some <br />
stuff to teach you soon. You got two papa dogs now and we're going to show you everything you can do with that <br />
brand new body of yours.&quot;</p>
