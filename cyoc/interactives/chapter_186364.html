<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hmm, let&#39;s spice things up a bit. Dan, you are going to be the bitch, and Daisy, you are going to be the alpha male.&quot; Chuckled Sarah. She then watched as Dan grew 6 more nipples down his torso, and Daisy&#39;s breasts shrank down a small bit while her clitoris lengthened slightly. A tiny nub poked out above both of their asses as well, forming the beginning of what would eventually become their tails.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you two can go and play for a bit, just remember that you are dogs, and that dogs go outside to relieve themselves. I do not want to see any accidents today. And try not to get too dirty&quot; instructed Sarah as she feeds them another treat. Dan and Daisy lick her palms clean with extra enthusiasm since they were given a treat and then took off to play with each other, staying on all fours for the entire time.<br />
<br />
Sarah unlocked the doggy door so that they could come and go as they pleased through it. She then opened up the livingroom curtains and took a seat in order to watch the fun unfold right in front of her, as her new pets played outside. She did not realize though that Daisy had just accidentily turned on a speaker in the room which had connected to the device in their bedroom, but with the speaker&#39;s volume turned down to a nearly inaudible level. However, despite being so quiet, it still was having a very slight effect on Sarah. Nothing major was changing about her, but ever so slightly she was beginning to feel more and more sleepy.<br />
<br />
A few hours pass while Sarah naps in the chair. And as the sun begins to set, Dan and Daisy begin to get hungry. So they head back inside to find their Owner. <br />
<br />
Daisy also now is walking completely on her hands and feet with her knees well off the ground. She seemed very comfortable moving around like this too. The only other noteworthy development is that now she is radiating a lot more confidence and authority. <br />
<br />
Dan still is on his knees, but his finger nails have turned black and each nipple now has a bit of mass behind it, as all 8 of his still tiny breasts are beginning to form. His behavior around Daisy also is slightly taking a more submissive nature. It is almost unnoticeable, but for example, he will never walk in front of her, unless she lets him do it.<br />
<br />
What the two find is Sarah slumped into a chair near the window, with a pair of small, dirty blonde triangle points peaking out from underneath her blonde hair and a pair of dangling earrings on the ground on either side of the chair. Dan and Daisy both feel compelled sniff her a bit, and Dan even starts licking her face, having partially hopped up onto the chair with just his hands.<br />
<br />
This woke Sarah up right away. And she couldn&#39;t help but laugh at seeing Dan trying to lick her face some more with excitement. &quot;Haha, Dan, get off of me and the chair, you crazy bitch&quot; she says while lightly shoving Dan off of her and back down to the floor. &quot;I know you are excited to see me, but my face can only be licked so much. Huh? What the hell! When did it get so late?&quot; Sarah finally saw how dark it was getting outside and looked at the clock to find it almost 8:00pm. &quot;Wow, I must have been tired to nap for so long. I guess you two want your dinner, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan and Daisy were elated to hear the word &quot;dinner&quot; as both of them were quite hungry by now. Sarah stretched and headed into the kitchen where she poured 2 bowls of the special &quot;dog food&quot; she had prepared already ahead of time. It was not normal dog food, as Dan and Daisy were not actually dogs, yet. It was just a mixture of hard foods like nuts, croutons, and dried fruits. Essentially it was just a kind of trail mix with a few bits of cooked hamburger meat and some diced cheese sprinkled here and there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright you two, sit&quot; commanded Sarah as she set both bowls down on the floor, as well as a bowl of water for them to share. &quot;Good dogs, you can go eat now.&quot; Sarah left the room after saying that while Dan and Daisy dove head first into their respective food bowls. Sarah headed for the bathroom as she wanted to take a shower. <br />
<br />
When she got to the bathroom mirror though, she stopped dead in her tracks as something had caught the corner of her eye. And after a closer inspection, she confirmed that she now sported a dirty blonde, pointy pair of dog ears on top of her head as well as a significant lack of human ears. But unlike how it normally should have be seen as normal to her, due to the sound being so low, she didn&#39;t get the full effect and was never made able to become fully entranced. Meaning that even though her mind was not under the full hypnosis effect, her body partially was and is now changing just like her dogs are. What she didn&#39;t understand though, is how. The device was not in the livingroom at all. She couldn&#39;t possibly have heard it either, as the device was obviously not plugged into any of the outlets in the living room. Also, she discovered that while her ears had changed, her hearing ability hadn&#39;t gotten any better.<br />
<br />
Sarah touched her new ears and then began to rub them frantically as the feeling they gave her when she rubbed them was close to an orgasm in terms of pleasure, but in a different kind of pleasure. Just a purely blissful one. After a experiencing a minute more of this, she had to focus really hard in order to stop herself from petting herself. &quot;Fuck, what am I going to do now? I can&#39;t be seen in public like this, or else it will draw a lot of unwanted attention. But I can&#39;t turn their device off either, or it will mess with their progress. Maybe I just got exposed to it a little bit somehow... but I still cannot see any possible way in which I could have heard it while in their livingroom. Maybe their door was left open?&quot;</p>
