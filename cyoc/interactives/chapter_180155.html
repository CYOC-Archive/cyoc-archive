<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chet Landon had went into that club feeling like he was a typical straight guy. Interested in boobs, football, boobs again, more football, fucking, and enjoying himself.<br />
<br />
But after that experience in the nightclub he didn&#39;t really feel so sure he was quite so male any more. As he left it, leaving the experience behind and likely something he wouldn&#39;t get to explore again, he found himself wondering about his change in there. He remembered slimming down, the growth of his breasts and retraction of his cock. He remembered the last blowjob, and how good it felt. He remembered dancing with other guys in there, and enjoying the feeling of their hands on him. He wasn&#39;t...gay, so he thought.<br />
<br />
But now that he was done with it however he couldn&#39;t just forget all that happened to him in there. He couldn&#39;t forget how good that all felt. And he couldn&#39;t just leave it all behind in the nightclub. He looked in his reflection and saw the rough, muscular jock in the reflection as...not quite what he wanted to be right now. He wasn&#39;t exactly sure what he even was any more. Maybe he was just dealing with the residual feelings of how good it felt being that club chick.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was something he had never even noticed in himself before this all happened.<br />
<br />
And maybe it was the magical effects of the club, making him feel a sense of connection and enjoyment, a sort of not quite brainwashing to make the experience not quite traumatic.<br />
<br />
Chet continued walking, all the way until he reached the dorm at the college he went to. Usually he would be eager to get in, workout, shower, maybe jerk off and head off to sleep. But tonight he felt a different sort of agenda was needed. He fumbled with the key and looked at his hands, wondering again about how good it had felt to have such dainty little hands.<br />
<br />
Opening the door up, Chet looked inside the dorm and saw not many people were out and about. One of his buddies walked by and casually shouted over his shoulder, &quot;Hey bro, welcome back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chet didn&#39;t answer, and continued into his own room, one of the larger ones. Inside he had his TV, a few fitness weights, including a barbell, an adjustable EZ bar, some dumbbells, and two kettlebells. His bed was large and generous, and he couldn&#39;t remember the number of women he&#39;d ushered into it before fucking them senseless. Remembering their soft curves and figures, and the clothes they wore before Chet disrobed them made his dick hard.<br />
<br />
Chet groaned and looked around. He first closed the door behind him and locked it tight. He didn&#39;t need any interruptions tonight. He then disrobed, eagerly and with a sense of urgency. Tossing his shoes off in the corner as well once he got down to his jeans. Then he took those off too, standing there a muscular example of masculinity by all appearances. Chet gulped, and took a seat by his bed.<br />
<br />
He got his laptop up, and started looking for a good porno.<br />
<br />
At first he got ones where the guy was a buff stud like him, such that he could imagine doing the same sexual moves, but then he switched over after several nonstarter attempts at getting into the scenario. He found himself looking at lesbian porn with a different sort of intensity now. His brow caught a droplet of sweat. His hand tightened on the side of his laptop, his other hand gripping his hard manhood.<br />
<br />
Pump, pump, pump, pump.<br />
<br />
His heartbeat moving fast, at the same time his hand doing likewise. His muscles streaked with sweat as he kicked with a leg. He saw the women in his porno moaning, heard them grabbing at one another&#39;s breasts, stroking a finger in and out of their pussies. Grinding those wet pussies together. Feeling each other&#39;s form so keenly and tightly.<br />
<br />
Chet couldn&#39;t help but imagine himself in the video. As one of the women so involved.<br />
<br />
He felt her grinding her pussy against Chet&#39;s, felt her kiss Chet&#39;s lips, her breasts so sensitive as she succumbed to excitement. She felt the other woman kiss her breast and--- &quot;FUUUUUUCK!!&quot; Chet shouted aloud in his deep, powerful voice as he suddenly emitted, only barely managing to turn in time, painting the floor by his bed with his seed.<br />
<br />
Chet gasped and realized what he had been doing. What he had been fantasizing about. He shut down the porno, and closed down his laptop, looking at the ceiling as he laid there in post-orgasm contemplation. He had just fantasized about being a woman again. He didn&#39;t know if it was some residual effect or maybe something woke up, but he knew it wasn&#39;t anything like any other time he&#39;d cum like that before.<br />
<br />
His contemplation took him unto his nightly hours, and before long he drifted off into a fitful sleep.<br />
<br />
Chet found himself dreaming that night, imagining himself as he was, but then he saw a change taking place. Something that took him from what he was more toward what he...what he...he didn&#39;t even know. Chet knew he wanted to be more feminine, but he didn&#39;t know how much he wanted to go in that direction. He knew what he fantasized, but he didn&#39;t know how thoroughly that fantasy had roots in his own mind. If he could only explore again.<br />
<br />
He found himself turning, tossing, transforming.<br />
<br />
It was perhaps some remnant of the magic of the club, or maybe something else, acting on his desires. Chet didn&#39;t know if it was a dream or reality at this point. His luxurious experience was one he hoped he didn&#39;t wake up from. His body was blended more - still masculine, but much more feminine. A successful, blissful combination thereof. To allow Chet to explore what he wanted and how much of that he wanted outside the influence of the club.<br />
<br />
He thrust his hips up from his bed, and let out a loud, somewhat femme moan...</p>
