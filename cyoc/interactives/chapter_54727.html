<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the cubs and pups were filed out of the room (with of course the Alphas eldest children <br />
leading the pack), Mary felt a sick feeling in her gut. <br />
<br />
'I should be in high school.' Mary thought, 'I'm way smarter than everything that's being <br />
taught in any of my classes! Just cause I'm not as smart as Jenny and Bart everything thinks <br />
I'm just clever! I'm smarter than any other cub! And I'm smarter than some of the humans <br />
going to high school!'  Mary had personally been happy to miss a few days of public school. <br />
It wasn't that she -didn't- like her friends, and it wasn't that she was teased or bullied, it <br />
was just... 'I know I can do better. I just know it.' <br />
<br />
The eight going on nine Mary felt a warm memory of when she had casually corrected an <br />
error made by her first grade biology teacher. <br />
<br />
Mary thought of the high school students who were much bigger than her, Mary thought of <br />
people who'd be jealous of her being so small but knowing more than them. 'I can take'em.'  <br />
<br />
Tano and Moja meanwhile for their sisters looked about for their mothers. 'I wonder how <br />
mom is going after yesterday.' Tano and Moja thought much the same. <br />
<br />
That was when thunder clapped and mountains broke in two and the heavens came <br />
crashing down.   Tano and Moja stopped dead in their tracks. Mbili, Tatuli, and Neli crashed <br />
straight into Moja almost knocking her over. Sita, Saba and Nane bumped head as Tano <br />
halted in front of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sis'?&quot; Sita asked worried. <br />
<br />
Mary snapped out of her own self pity and looked at her half sister, &quot;Moja?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.... mom dead...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy dead! And she's never coming back!&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;That letter was addressed to me to give to Wanda.&quot; Tabby said sternly. <br />
<br />
Gillie took a look at the instructions attacthed to the letter, &quot;It was given to you, to give to <br />
Wade, er, Wanda, to give to Trevor... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know a leoman named Trevor?&quot; Wanda didn't know every member of the pride by <br />
name... yet. <br />
<br />
Gillie thought back to the cat turned into a lion boy the night before last. &quot;Yes I do. And I'm <br />
just hold onto it for the moment anyway. Now please wait Tabitha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I will.&quot; The human woman promised. <br />
<br />
Gillie asked, &quot;Wanda really means a lot to you doesn't she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course she does.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gillie wasn't sure why she asked, but given the grudge the game seemed to have against <br />
the Y chromosome she figured it was worth asking, &quot;So, if you were a guy, would you date <br />
her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-?! Are you kidding? She's my best-friend! More than that: she's a close as family! It <br />
would too weird! Blegh!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Gillie sighed, &quot;I see.&quot; 'I wonder if the population of the wolves and the lion people are all <br />
kept under control from there being fewer males. But that doesn't make a lick of sense. <br />
Logically speaking, it would be fewer -females- if you wanted to keep the population <br />
down...' <br />
<br />
Gillie nodded and headed into her officer. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You thinking about him too?&quot; Asked Sunny as they prepared breakfast for their damaged <br />
guests and packmates. This was normally Omega's work, but given they had the pride to <br />
deal with as well, they had other obligations. <br />
<br />
&quot;You mean Kira? Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was great last night wasn't it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it was. I guess this means we're not virgins anymore does it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it?&quot; Sunny wondered, 'Does having sex as statues counts-?!' <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see why not.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was -Sunny- who blushed first, it had always been an ideal to her.  Something she had <br />
always failed to reach or to touch. <br />
<br />
&quot;If Anne hears, she'll say we're honor bound to get married now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sunny looked at her, &quot;Married to a statue?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we were statues too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who'd marry a bunch of statues?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another statue?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think there are any statue preachers...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, got it there... Let's focus now before we end up cutting off our own fingers.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sunny nodded, &quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
'Be careful Kira.' Thought Helen from the front lawn to Kira. 'Remember what they said <br />
about Romeo and Juliet if they lived... Their marriage was spur of the moment and wasn't <br />
like to last if they hadn't killed themselves.' <br />
<br />
'Don't worry I know.' Said Kira, 'We're art remember? If there's one thing we're good at, it's <br />
waiting. Plenty of time to figure out if they want in for me or just looking for any guy.' <br />
<br />
'You aren't a guy.'<br />
<br />
'I am now.' <br />
<br />
'She is now.' Echoed Nessie. <br />
<br />
'And what about us?' Michelle asked. <br />
<br />
'What about us?' Kira asked, 'It's not like the five of us are married. We were prisoners, all <br />
alone, next to each other but unable to speak to each other. We've known each other <br />
personally only a few days.' <br />
<br />
'I know.' Michelle said, 'I apologize Kira.' <br />
<br />
Kira's statue form was connected to the intercom that ran from the front gate to the entry <br />
way and the power gates to open and close them. And thus was connected to Glendale's <br />
power grid. The three fountain head statue wolves were connected to Glendale's pipe <br />
system. And Michelle of course could feel it all through the senses of her sub-pack mates. <br />
<br />
'If you wish to ultimately marry. If you chose to, I can aid you.' Said a new voice, that spoke <br />
mean in meanings than words. <br />
<br />
'Huh? Who are you?' Nessie asked first. The five statue wolves followed the spiritual scent.  <br />
It led them straight to Glendale's catholic church. <br />
<br />
'I was a priest, until three little witches turned me into a cherub statue... during the chaos <br />
of the disaster before their hanging, I was broken and logically assumed to be dead if I had <br />
even still been alive. I've come to suspect due to the saturation of magic that had come <br />
from the witches abuse of it at the peak of their rampage, my spirit lingered, or maybe I <br />
am a shadow of the man who was transformed made a true person all my own from the <br />
slow absorption of the spiritual strength within these walls. Whatever the case, I was <br />
quality stone, and broken down into mortar, and was used to help rebuild this church... My <br />
presence had since seeped into every brick...  And I am not alone.' <br />
<br />
'What do you mean?' Nessie had to ask.<br />
<br />
'Many statues were broken during the witches' chaos. Many of them their own victims. <br />
Many like me were 'recycled' during Glendale's rebuilding... The school, the hospital, the <br />
police house, and more. We are Glendale herself, we have witnessed every good and evil <br />
that the game has been used for, and wish for it to end. We are each are own self, but, also <br />
WE are Glendale. Just as YOU now are Glendale.'<br />
<br />
'We are Glendale?' Michelle asked. <br />
<br />
'Just as anyone I suspect who will chose to join you in eternity until judgement day, I <br />
assume will also become Glendale. YOU are Glendale. Open yourselves up and you can feel <br />
it all, all of us... WE are Glendale, we feel the pain caused by the game, the precious few <br />
times it was used for good.'<br />
<br />
<br />
'WE are Glendale, we feel the pain caused by the game, the precious few times it was used <br />
for good. We feel the people living within us.'<br />
<br />
'WE are Glendale.' <br />
<br />
'WE are Glendale.' <br />
<br />
'WE are Glendale.' <br />
<br />
'WE are Glendale.' <br />
<br />
<br />
'I just hope this doesn't freak out Sunny and Luna when they come to visit.' Kira thought to <br />
the rest of Glendale. 'And we're happy for the welcome to the community and all but... <br />
seriously, we'd like to keep to ourselves for now.'<br />
<br />
'As you wish. Just know that I can technically marry you if you wish it later. We won't make <br />
contact again unless you call out and wish it. We can appreciate the need for privacy.'  <br />
<br />
'Thanks.' Nessie replied mentally. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Gillie said coming out of her office, &quot;Let's go.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Tabby said happily. <br />
<br />
No one asked about Gillie doing it, after all, it was her pride that was hurt there at the <br />
estate too. <br />
<br />
Gillie sighed at the police van outside apparently built for someone her size and body type. <br />
And saw the marked of wear and tear of something that had been there for years. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get in.&quot; Gillie said simply and Tabby obeyed. <br />
<br />
Laying on her stomach with pedals behind her, Gillie got in, and drove slowly and carefully <br />
getting used to the set up custom made apparently just for someone of her super human <br />
height. <br />
<br />
She looked around, she felt sick when she spotted at least two Leomans who weren't one <br />
of her officers walking about town naked and causing no one alarm and distress. <br />
<br />
She drove up the walls of Smith Manor, now engraved as Wolf Manor, and saw the winged <br />
woman dragon/wolf statues on the corners of the building. She resisted the urge to sigh <br />
again. <br />
<br />
She clicked on the button on the wall, waited a minute before a rough woman's voice <br />
asked who it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gill, Chief Gillie Daleson... I have a visitor for one of my officers.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gates opened up and Gillie drove along, seeing the three giant grinning busty fountain <br />
statues and shuddered at the taste and wondered if they too were victims of the game and <br />
if so if they were even alive. <br />
<br />
Gillie stopped out, the mansion was larger than the time she had visited a couple years <br />
back. Much larger. She took Tabby hand and lead her along and knocked on the door.</p>
