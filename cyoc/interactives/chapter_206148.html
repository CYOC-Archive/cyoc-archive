<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tsukuyomi was feeling a little anxious right now. His mate was due to have their pups any day now. True, she was stronger than the average wolf Animalian and was able to carry herself with little problem. But Tsuku had no idea when they can expect her to start going into labor. As such, any other business he was called to was finished as quickly as possible so he can hurry back to his mate.<br />
<br />
However, today&#39;s business wasn&#39;t something that was going to be finished in a slapdash manner. Amaterasu had asked for him to come speak with some girls who were getting double-dosed conversions. Tsuku wasn&#39;t even sure why he had to be there, but he supposed he ought to do his duty.<br />
<br />
He found Amaterasu outside of the assigned meeting room. She was looking at her phone with a frown on her face. A small glimpse at her phone showed she was looking at Animalia&#39;s website. Rather surprisingly, she was looking at the English version. Yes, learning to speak and read English was standard with Japan now, though most Japanese people still prefer to read Japanese when they can. Curious, Tsuku asked, &quot;Is there anything in particular you&#39;re reading right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been going over the Quasi-Raccoon Cuties&#39; reviews,&quot; said Amaterasu a little gruffly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have they been doing a bad job?&quot; asked Tsuku.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only in one aspect,&quot; said Amaterasu, &quot;They&#39;ve been getting my name wrong. It&#39;s &#39;Ami&#39;, not &#39;Ammy&#39;. They should know better than that. I&#39;ve been a leader of Heiya Island since it started. Would it kill them to get my name right for once?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably nobody pointed out to them they were getting it wrong,&quot; said Tsuku, &quot;It&#39;s a simple mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Except that &#39;Ami&#39; is a proper name,&quot; said Ami, &quot;I don&#39;t even know anyone named &#39;Ammy&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure a simple correction will end this issue,&quot; said Tsuku, &quot;But you didn&#39;t call for me just because people were spelling your name wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I was just waiting for our other speakers to get here,&quot; said Ami.<br />
<br />
Presently, the other speakers did show up. Andrew and Jen had to duck their heads as they walked down the hall. While Heiya Island&#39;s buildings were designed with Animalians&#39; larger average in size, they weren&#39;t quite built for larger Dinotopians, especially <i>Brachiosaurus</i>. Jen bowed as much as she could and said, &quot;It is an honor to finally meet you, Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need for formalities,&quot; said Ami, &quot;We&#39;re all just simple Japanese people here. You could have moved here after the colony was set up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought about it,&quot; said Jen, &quot;But this island is a little small for me. Besides, I&#39;m happy with Andrew in Dinotopia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you have heard about why you were asked to come here,&quot; said Tsuku.<br />
<br />
Jen nodded and said, &quot;To help other girls who, as my grandmother would say, have been cursed by <i>ushi-oni</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What exactly is an <i>ushi-oni</i>?&quot; asked Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a yokai that has the head of an ox and often the body of a giant spider,&quot; said Ami, &quot;And it can do a lot worse to humans than give women huge breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were only three girls waiting for them when they went into the meeting room. Breast hyperthropy is a rather rare condition and few women have their breasts grow large enough to classified as such, particularly among Asian women. Only one of the girls had breasts that were under 2.5 kilograms and was categorized as macromastia. On a bigger girl from, say, America, her breasts would just be considered quite busty. However, her small Japanese frame made them too much of a handful and overshadowed most of her chest. But she appeared modest compared to the other two. Jen internally winced in sympathy, remembering all too clearly of what it was like to be shackled to such enormous weights on her chest that she relied on a wheelchair. These two might not be quite as big as she was, but it was clearly too much for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allow me to introduce Uehashi Yauvani and Tahara Kumiko and Tahara Kumiyo,&quot; said Ami indicating first the first, relatively smaller girl and then her larger companions.<br />
<br />
Jen looked between the two Taharas. To his older eyes, Asian people tended to look quite a lot alike. But there was an undeniable similarity between the two of them even to people who knew Asian people better. &quot;Twins?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cousins, actually,&quot; said Kumiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;But our dads were identical twins who married another pair of identical twins,&quot; said Kumiyo.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we were both born on the same day,&quot; said Kumiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we might as well be twins,&quot; said Kumiyo.<br />
<br />
Tsuku looked at Yauvani. In addition to smaller breasts, she had darker skin than the Taharas. Actually, darker than most Japanese people and a different complexion. &quot;Yauvani isn&#39;t a Japanese name,&quot; observed Tsuku.<br />
<br />
Yauvani shrugged and said, &quot;My mother was from Calcutta. My father&#39;s side of the family blame her for the <i>gyuki</i>&#39;s curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it was an <i>ushi-oni</i>,&quot; said Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Gyuki</i> is another name for <i>ushi-oni</i>,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, blaming her mother is wrong,&quot; said Jen, &quot;It&#39;s nobody&#39;s fault except a strange genetic quirk.&quot; She turned to the girls and said, &quot;So, I assume you have questions about conversion. Let me assure you, I was once in your position. Actually, I might have had more disproportionate breasts, but as you can see, I&#39;ve had that problem sorted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have to become a dinosaur to have it fixed?&quot; asked Kumiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; said Jen, &quot;I was told other large Animalian forms would be able to alleviate my size problem. Admittedly, I had such a large pair, that one of the larger ones would make a difference. But I met Andrew before I converted and he seemed like a nice guy. I don&#39;t really regret becoming a <i>Brachiosaurus</i>, though you don&#39;t have to become one yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t you sink because your great weight?&quot; asked Kumiyo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, we can&#39;t sink at all,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;To support our great size and make it so we&#39;re not too heavy for the square-cub law, our bones actually have air pockets in them. So we actually just float on water like corks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko and Kumiyo went into a quiet but animated conversation in Japanese with each other. Yauvani spoke up. &quot;So, do we have a choice about what kind of Animalian we can be?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; said Ami, &quot;It&#39;s just that becoming megafauna will allow you to grow to match your breast size. You might be a little above-average, but you&#39;ll have the frame to better support yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In which case, it would be fine if I became a water buffalo?&quot; asked Yauvani.<br />
<br />
&quot;That shouldn&#39;t be a problem,&quot; said Ami, &quot;Though I may ask why.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not about your father&#39;s family blaming the <i>gyuki</i>, is it?&quot; asked Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; said Yauvani, &quot;If anything, it&#39;s more in spite of that. But I kinda wanna honor Mom&#39;s side of the family and I don&#39;t think I want a zebu&#39;s hump on my back. Also, I kinda admire Shuixing of the Five Elements and I kinda hope I can be like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we can arrange that,&quot; said Ami. Gongniu would probably be quite interested in a water buffalo cow being available, but Ami wasn&#39;t going to pair them up unless Yauvani was willing.<br />
<br />
&quot;One other thing,&quot; said Kumiko, &quot;Large breasts don&#39;t hamper swimming, does it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Depends on the Animalian,&quot; said Jen, &quot;Some land-based Animalians like horses have trouble adjusting, especially with their hooves. They&#39;re quite capable of becoming good swimmers in spite of that. Aquatic Animalians aren&#39;t nearly as hampered as you might think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I think I would like to be an orca,&quot; said Kumiko, &quot;If you can make one of the white orcas like near Hokkaido, I&#39;d appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be a little hard,&quot; said Tsuko, &quot;Most orcas aren&#39;t likely to hold still for a genetic sample.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I was wondering about one of your sea dinosaurs,&quot; said Kumiyo, &quot;Is that the right word?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ancient marine reptiles were actually more distantly related from true dinosaurs,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;But we do have a few different species for you to choose from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like the looks of Tyson-san,&quot; said Kumiyo.<br />
<br />
Andrew knew who she was talking about. The Dinotopian community was small enough to know most of the people in it, especially more notable ones. &quot;You do realize that <i>Tylosaurus</i> Dinotopians are very large,&quot; he said pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like an orca,&quot; said Kumiyo, &quot;And you say bigger forms help us scale up with our breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could become an orca yourself,&quot; said Ami.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve spent our whole lives being mistaken for each other,&quot; said Kumiko, &quot;We want people to be able to tell us apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But not look too different from each other,&quot; said Kumiyo.<br />
<br />
&quot;We also loved swimming before we got too awkward to swim,&quot; said Kumiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we can arrange for you all,&quot; said Ami, &quot;Though we may need Mr. Tyson to come here to provide his sample.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait,&quot; said Kumiyo giddily.</p>
