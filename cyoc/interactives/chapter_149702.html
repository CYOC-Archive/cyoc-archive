<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny watched as the stablewoman took up her position at the far end of the aisle. She then looked to the opposite end of the stable where a large black horse was being ushered into place. Once there, the horse calmly waited for the mare to make her decision.<br />
<br />
Internally, Jenny’s mind was in chaos as it was torn apart by the human and horse personalities as they fought for dominance. The balance of power shifted constantly as human reasoning fought mare instinct.<br />
<br />
“GO!” the stablewoman yelled.<br />
<br />
Jenny hesitated for a few more moments before making her move.<br />
<br />
Her eyes locked on to the dark stallion at the far end of the stable. She recognised that it was Harry, perhaps the stable’s most prized asset. Thinking about him made Jenny’s legs feel weak as she imagined what it would be like to submit to him. Her desire for the stud then ramped up again when his thick musky scent found her nostrils. She breathed in deeply as she took a few steps towards him; almost in a trance.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jenkins’ consciousness became alarmed as his infernal body took a few more steps towards Harry. He dug deep and struggled desperately to resist. <br />
<br />
As a result of Jenkins’ efforts, Jenny started to slow as she shook her head, desperately trying to ignore the nagging human voice inside her head.<br />
<br />
However, the human voice didn’t ease up. He mentally yelled “YOU ARE A MAN! YOU ARE A MAN!”<br />
<br />
As a result, the mare ground to a halt, and then she started to turn away. The feisty horse whinnied in anger as she twisted and turned her head, desperate to reach the amazing stud. But now Jenkins was in the driving seat as the mare now headed towards the female attendant at the other end of the stables.<br />
<br />
Jenny continued to show her distress as she crossed her original starting point. She let out shrill whinnies, which were the equine equivalent of saying “please fuck me!,” as she felt that she was losing the battle of wills. She tried every trick in the book, including swishing her tail back and forth in a desperate effort to fan her pheromone-laced scent over to the handsome stud.<br />
<br />
But Harry just kept staring patiently at Jenny’s large backside and swaying hips as she gradually got further and further away. He seemed to have the horse equivalent of a grin spread across his muzzle, as if he was up to something mischievous.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jenkins was starting to hope that he would get through this. He was in charge now and he was determined to reach the finish line. Just a few more steps and he would be done. He could virtually taste his imminent victory.<br />
<br />
The mare’s steps quickened as Jenkins asserted himself more and more. The woman was now tantalisingly close. Three dozen steps left! Two dozen! One dozen! Jenkins started to relax as he judged that success was virtually a guarantee.<br />
<br />
It therefore came as a massive shock when Jenkins heard the approach of hooves as they clattered louder and louder on the stone floor. The confused horse barely had a chance to turn her head around before feeling a heavy weight land on her back and a dark form looming over her.<br />
<br />
In a stunned haze Jenkins took a few moments to register what was going on. However he soon worked out the implications of what was happening: he had been mounted by Harry! He knew that if he allowed himself to be fucked into submission then it was game over.<br />
<br />
Jenkins sent desperate orders to his mare’s body to buck or shake the stallion off. But Harry used his larger size to his advantage as he pushed the mare down as she tried to buck and kick, using his front hooves to steady himself as he gripped her flanks.<br />
<br />
Jenkins fought valiantly but it was clear to see that the bucking movements were getting weaker and weaker. To his horror, Jenkins could now feel the mare’s instincts returning in full force. He began to feel impressed rather than frustrated at Harry’s brute strength. And the stallion’s musk began to smell alluring rather than disgusting, which made Jenkins’ body unwittingly shudder in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Jenkins’ control of his warped mind was quickly eroded as his accursed body’s resistance dwindled to nothing. He despaired as he felt his vagina moisten; clearly lubricating itself in preparation for some imminent action. <br />
<br />
The horror of what was about to happen shattered any sense of control that Jenkins held mere moments ago. His eyes were wide open in fear as he felt something hard jab between his legs. His mind slipped more as he felt two more hard pokes from what could only be Harry’s enormous penis. He then shuddered in disgust and unwanted pleasure as he felt the cock’s large tip spread his vagina’s lips as it slipped inside the slick orifice with ease.<br />
<br />
This animalistic act opened the floodgates. Now, by welcoming Harry inside him, Jenkins had unknowingly sealed his own fate. After all, males didn’t have vaginas designed to have cocks inside them, only females did. And humans weren’t mounted on all-fours when they mated, but sexy mares certainly were.<br />
<br />
As a result, Jenkins came to the conclusion that ‘he’ was in fact a ‘she,’ and that she was enjoying being mated with like the lustful mare in heat that she truly was.<br />
<br />
Now, with Jenny the mare back in charge, and with Harry’s member fully enveloped inside her vagina, the couple resolved to eradicate any lingering traces of Jenkins’ mind. <br />
<br />
Harry didn’t mess around as he pounded into Jenny in broad, powerful strokes. Sexual juices were forced out around the rock-hard member as it hammered in and out. This created loud wet squelches which added to the slapping sounds of his enormous testicles as they crashed into her backside.<br />
<br />
Jenny was overwhelmed with desire at this point. Her whole body rocked forwards as her mate’s penis slammed forcefully inside her. She was determined not to be denied her elusive orgasm for a third time. And so she began pushing back down against the massive member, hoping that it would reach her deepest recesses as he eagerly humped away. <br />
<br />
The pair’s whinnies began to get louder and louder as they built towards a glorious orgasm.<br />
<br />
By this stage all but a speck of Jenkins’ consciousness remained, the rest having been fucked into oblivion by the virile stallion. Jenkins now wished it was all over. But sadly his human survival instincts refused to let him give in. Instead he would have to suffer in despair until it was all over.<br />
<br />
Mercifully, he wouldn’t have to wait too much longer for his wish to be fulfilled. Harry and Jenny’s mating now reached a fever pitch as they sensed that they were on the brink of orgasm. The mare whinnied out in wild animalistic bliss as her glorious climax got closer and closer.<br />
<br />
Jenny unleashed one last earth-shattering whinny as she felt the first warm jets of cum splurging deep inside her equine pussy. Her vaginal muscles continued to grip her mate’s cock tightly as Harry dumped his load inside her tight passage. She intended to milk him for every last drop of his precious seed, thus maximising her chances of being impregnated.<br />
<br />
Before long, Jenny’s already-stuffed orifice could take no more as the sticky semen filled her up. The excess was soon cascading out of her and down her hind legs to the floor. Harry unleashed so much cum into her that their combined fluids soon began to bubble up and become frothy as it struggled to escape Jenny’s overflowing passage.<br />
<br />
The intense female orgasm had been the nail in Jenkins’ coffin. The small surviving remnant of his mind immediately died and drifted away as the first drops of cum exploded inside of his bestial body. Now Jenny had no recollection of ever having been human, she was just a common mare, and almost certainly a pregnant one at that.<br />
<br />
“Bravo” the stablewoman applauded. “Excellent work Harry, exactly as planned.” The big stallion snorted in satisfaction as he rested on his mate’s back, clearly still enjoying having his cock inside her hot wet pussy.<br />
<br />
“And as for you,” the woman continued motioning to Jenny, “did you really think I’d let a little snake like you get away with your betrayal Scott-free? For such a clever man you really were foolish. I much prefer you in your new form, Jenny. Now you are elegant, loyal and popular with the studs: a true asset to my stables!”<br />
<br />
Jenny barely registered the woman’s humiliating words. Rather than mourn the loss of her humanity she was instead morning the loss of her mate’s giant cock as it slowly slid back out of her. She whinnied softly as the head stretched her one last time before slipping out with a wet *slop* after which more of their combined juices flowed out in its wake.<br />
<br />
With his mission completed, Harry made his way back to his stall with a smug expression on his face.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the stablewoman smiled as she led Jenny to her own stall. She patted the tired mare on the rump before she left her alone to recover. It wasn’t long before Jenny was lying on the floor, fast asleep. Last night’s dreams about escaping or of turning into a disgusting human were now abhorrent to the freshly-bred mare. Instead, she dreamed about giving birth to a healthy foal and nursing him from her swollen udder, hoping that this vision would one day become a reality.<br />
<br />
However, not everyone could share in Jenny’s peaceful state of bliss. Already the stable’s true boss was back at work planning what she should do next…</p>
