<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come on guys... open the door!&quot; Whitney Chapman&#39;s voice was heard through the door as Jeff approached it, and he felt that his mother didn&#39;t know that that was precisely what he was about to do.<br />
<br />
The reason for that, however, wasn&#39;t to signal any sort of cave in to the demand that Megan and Jenny had wanted and had started the previous evening in turning them all into slug people enslaved to their master. Jeff had the sense that all of them would likely become slug people at some point, given what Grace had told them after her transformation, but there was also the sense that they could avoid the sort of control that Megan and Jenny had over their mother at the moment. That was better than nothing, in Jeff&#39;s mind, and if Grace was right on what she sensed, they might be able to save their mother from that control and thus setting up the plan. Jeff was moving to open the door, which would keep him out of sight while Grace stood not to far away just inside the door. From there it was expected that Whitney would rush Grace and Jeff could shut the door behind her while Grace moved to try and restrain their mother. Zoe had volunteered to help if need be and even Lucy might help if Whitney couldn&#39;t be restrained quickly enough to get them the chance to break whatever mental hold that Megan and Jenny had over their mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready, Grace?&quot; Jeff asked as he looked to his transformed sister. She sat in positioned with her tail curled in a way that looked like a half circle and might enable her to avoid being pushed too far back. Zoe was closer to the bed and Lucy was on the other side of it for the moment, but Jeff kept his eyes focused on Grace. It was only when she nodded that he gripped the door handle and pressed in on it to disengage the lock, &quot;Okay... here it goes...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Jeff opened the door and letting Whitney into the room. She called out to Grace and rushed in, though Jeff could also hear &quot;it&#39;s a trap&quot; coming from downstairs and the sounds of Megan and Jenny sliding up the stairs to try and call Whitney back. But Jeff managed to look out of the corner of his eye as Whitney practically charged at Grace, likely without thinking about why the door might be opened. Once Whitney was fully in the room, Jeff quickly slammed the door shut and again pushed in on the door nob and turned it to reengage the lock. From there he turned back to see what was going on between Grace and Whitney.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Grace knew that this would be tough, particularly with the fact that their mother was under whatever mind control that Megan and Jenny&#39;s master had cast and would likely act in that line of thought. And as Jeff opened the door, Grace made sure she was the one that Whitney would see and braced herself as Whitney smiled and gave a gleeful cry as she rushed into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grace! Oh Grace, you look beautiful!&quot; Whitney cried as she rushed toward Grace, &quot;Give mommy a kiss!&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace didn&#39;t do that, however, and braced herself for the inevitable collision as Whitney slid forward. She managed to reach out to get a grip on her mother&#39;s arms, though the slime on her mother&#39;s arms and her own hands meant that the grip was slippery and Whitney&#39;s &quot;charge&quot; was able to progress until Grace&#39;s hands slid to Whitney&#39;s shoulders. She tried to hold her mother back, even as her mother moved to try and wrestle out of the grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here to TALK, mom,&quot; Grace answered as she tried to push her mother back, &quot;about being free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re free to be slug people!&quot; Whitney said with a smile, &quot;and you make a beautiful slug woman!&quot;<br />
<br />
Whitney continued to try and wrestle with Grace, and it was at this point that Zoe moved in. With the two slug women facing each other directly, it was safer for Zoe to move in from a side and avoid any potential amorous attention that Whitney would want to deliver on them. Zoe could see that both Whitney and Grace were aroused, but she privately had to admit that the scent in the room had all of them aroused. And since she&#39;d volunteered to help wrestle their mother down to calmly talk with her, Zoe made her move. She moved forward and caught one of Whitney&#39;s arms and began to pull on it so that Whitney couldn&#39;t use it to wrestle with Grace.<br />
<br />
&quot;We may all become slug people, mom, but this is more freedom about who we are,&quot; Grace spoke, &quot;not being enslaved to Megan and Jenny&#39;s master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get you to be our MOM again,&quot; Zoe added as she pulled on Whitney&#39;s arm though soon found Whitney&#39;s tail trying to wrap around her.<br />
<br />
Whitney tried to struggle, but found that she couldn&#39;t overpower Grace with only one arm and Zoe was strong enough to actually maintain her balance and pull Whitney off balance. She&#39;d managed to coat Zoe&#39;s back in her slime and managed one attempted squeeze of Zoe&#39;s breasts, but that didn&#39;t work in getting either Zoe or Grace to back down. At the same time, a part of Whitney&#39;s mind was puzzled at Zoe&#39;s line to &quot;get you to be our mom again.&quot; Whitney was sure she was already and would always be their mother and she did love all her children and that was part of her reasoning for accepting Megan and Jenny&#39;s plan, and if they&#39;d all be happy slug people together, they would be a family.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;re already family!&quot; Whitney protested as she tired to pull Zoe to her with her tail, &quot;Megan and Jenny want us to be together... to be a family together!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They want us to serve their master, mom,&quot; Grace argued, &quot;serve their hive. If we weren&#39;t here... they wouldn&#39;t care about you or us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace tried to wrap her own tail around the other side of her mother&#39;s tail and pull it off of Zoe&#39;s back, but she quickly found that while her tail was long as a result of her transformation, it wasn&#39;t long enough to get around Whitney&#39;s tail completely. She could see some of the blinks in her mother&#39;s eyes and could feel her mother&#39;s confusion, which was a hint that her plan was working, but they still needed to get Whitney to settle down. It was at this point that Lucy moved to join in, and pushing Jeff back from the bed. Grace felt some relief as Lucy actually came up and got her arms around Whitney&#39;s tail and pulled it off of Zoe&#39;s back. It was at this point when Whitney found herself being pulled in three directions and couldn&#39;t break away that she finally began to stop struggling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I only want what&#39;s best for you!&quot; Whitney wailed, sounding half defeated in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know, mom,&quot; Jeff spoke, &quot;it&#39;s how you raised us... with love. Real love. Teach us right from wrong and everything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Megan and Jenny weren&#39;t part of what you raised us to be,&quot; Lucy added.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t just hate them because they&#39;re new,&quot; Whitney answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that they&#39;re new, mom,&quot; Grace replied, &quot;it&#39;s that they came to take away our choices. They bathed all of us in magic that turned you and me into slug women, like them, and has assured that the rest of our family would change as well... None of which we asked for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you ask to be a slug woman, mom?&quot; Zoe asked as she followed Whitney&#39;s eyes. The stalks moved in varying directions to allow Whitney to look to all of them, but Zoe also noticed a bit of panic in those eyes. &quot;I mean before you transformed... did you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Whitney said weakly, &quot;but it happened. I changed. Grace changed. You will change...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but for what purpose?&quot; Lucy demanded, &quot;what do Megan and Jenny want out of this? Grace has already told us that slug people can&#39;t cast mind control or create barriers on their own. This means that someone else is controlling them and it is that master that has done these things. So do you know what this master&#39;s purpose is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Whitney managed. She had some sense of this outside master, but Megan and Jenny didn&#39;t share much and her focus had been focused more on trying to get her children to join her as slug people to really look into the hive mind to find out what Jenny and Megan had actually planned and what their master had commanded them to do, &quot;but the hive...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But their hive isn&#39;t built on love,&quot; Jeff spoke up, &quot;it&#39;s not a family... not like what we have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They barged in with magic to try and control us,&quot; Lucy spoke, &quot;something you would have opposed if you knew it was happening. For it goes against how you raised us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember when I&#39;d tried to get the girls to give up desert by hiding their dolls when we were all little... and dad was still alive?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were grounded for a month for trying to bully your sisters,&quot; Whitney said remembering that event.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that shows where family and hive are different,&quot; Jeff spoke, &quot;And Megan and Jenny&#39;s hive...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s entirely based on coercion,&quot; Grace spoke, &quot;not love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love...&quot; Whitney said weakly, as her head began to hurt as it felt like part of her was battling with something else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, family love,&quot; Grace spoke, &quot;as we all love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we won&#39;t be in Megan and Jenny&#39;s hive,&quot; Lucy vowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that leaves you with a choice, mom,&quot; Jeff spoke as he stood back, &quot;If you HAD to make a choice between us and Megan and Jenny.... who would you choose? The children that you&#39;ve raised and love you very much? Or a pair of strangers you barely know and took your choices away on what you&#39;d want to be... took OUR choices away from us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Whitney began, as her headache increased and she began to struggle and shake a little bit. Though this time it was more like a spasm than anything that was coordinated. She could feel Lucy continue to hold and grip at her tail while Zoe was pulling on her left arm while Grace had moved more to holding onto her right arm. She could feel Grace&#39;s personal love radiate to her through the hivemind, and there seemed to be faint calls of &quot;choice&quot; coming in the distance. She didn&#39;t understand all of it, but it contrasted with Megan and Jenny&#39;s feelings, which Whitney found rather hazy. It was like something else was messing with them.<br />
<br />
Grace loosened her grip as her mother&#39;s eyes began to blink rather rapidly and slid around to where she could look directly into Whitney&#39;s face from the front. As this happened, Whitney moved her right arm so that her hand was rubbing at the side of his head. After a few moments Whitney&#39;s eyes squeezed shut and in a way indicate that kind of internal fight in Whitney&#39;s mind. To Grace that had to be Whitney fighting the mind control that had been part of the magic that had been cast to transform them. She could only hope that her mother would break free of it, now that she was in a position where Megan and Jenny couldn&#39;t directly influence her. After a few moments Whitney&#39;s eyes opened again and she stooped struggling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would choose you,&quot; Whitney said slowly and in a tone that sounded more confident and more loving, not lust driven, &quot;because I love you all... and... I&#39;m sorry for all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
All other eyes turned to Grace and Zoe and Lucy ignored that they were practically covered in slime again. For the moment, Grace was the only one who could get some sense as to whether or not Whitney had changed tactics and was playing some measure of distraction. Grace watched as the scent of arousal that had been coming from her mother was going down. She could see Whitney&#39;s penis going flaccid and being pulled back inside the slit that had been at the point where her human hips had been. At the same time, Grace picked up some sense of relief, sorrow, and even guilt radiating off of Whitney.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please... I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Whitney spoke, &quot;and I can&#39;t even describe how I fell into what I did... I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Whitney began to cry. It was at this that Grace did speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s good to have you back, mom,&quot; Grace spoke with some relief in her voice which got everyone to relax for a moment.</p>
