<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Raptora looked into Chris’ eyes as she thought what she desired at that moment “I want to hunt to feast on something I caught with my teeth, I want to claim a territory I can call my own that no one take away from me, I want to breed to have children to teach on how to truly live...” her voice getting more excited as she continued. All that Chris can do was watch as Raptora ranted on, feeling more aroused by her passion, ferocity and beauty. Raptora thrashed around as she ranted testing her strength, flexibility and speed, once she was done she saw the damage she inflicted to the room, the desk crushed in pieces, the shelves were thrown across the room and the walls were riddled with claw marks. Chris kneeled before the magnificent creature he had created “I must feel what you are feeling” Chris said meekly, he then started pointing the Morphomax at himself ready to fire it. Before he could pull the trigger Raptora in a feat of blinding speed had snatched the Ray away and with her powerful leg placed her scythe like talon against Chris’ neck. “Oh no you don’t what makes you think you deserve the gift I have received” Raptora cruelly said with a sneer smile. “I bought the ray, I gave you this gift you are relishing right now, why shouldn’t I experience what you have?” Chris begged as sweat dripped from his forehead holding his breathe with every word to ensure the claw doesn’t rip his throat out. “True. But I have a better idea” she then bend over as she whispered her plan into his ear.<br />
<br />
The next day Chris booked his private jet to take him and a mystery guest to Brazil stating he taking a much needed vacation and Ingrid had resigned her position for a new job in London. No really questioned this statement as Chris was custom to spontaneous trip around the world and Ingrid being offered a new job everyone knew she better than just a secretary. Little did anybody knew Chris had recently set all his affairs in order updating his will, selling of his properties and ensuring his corporate successor. All of Ingrid’s assets were sold off under the ruse of her move. As soon Chris arrived in Brazil in he chartered a boat to tour the Amazon paying extra so that only he and his guest would present on this trip, that was the last time anyone saw Chris Stewartson, his boat was found in a wreck a week later no bodies were found. <br />
<br />
A few days earlier<br />
Chris was deep in the jungle having spent the last two days traversing the labyrinthine tributaries of the Amazon in a dingy old motor boat. Raptora was lounging in the back of the boat in the nude letting the bright South American sun to warm her body which she highly enjoyed after having to cover her body in highly concealing clothes and slouch to a normal height in order to hide her body Raptora was relishing every moment. “Okay this should be far enough” said an exhausted Chris as he drifted the boat to the jungle river coast. As they disembarked Chris and Raptora pushed the boat back into the river so anyone looking for them would assume they drowned and their bodies lost to hungry scavengers. “Now I did as you asked we are completely isolated from the world give me what you promised” the tired Chris asked as his sweat drenched his clothing. Raptora had kept hold of the Morphomax ray teasing Chris with her elegant form the form he so desired. “Alright Chris you can have it, it would be lonely all by myself here and remove your clothes we wouldn’t want you feeling restrained by them” Chris taking off his clothes as soon as he heard that “it would be so nice to have a sister” the sultry Raptora replied aiming the Ray at Chris and pulling the trigger. “Wait... Sister” questioned Chris then the red beam hit him center mass beginning the transformation. At first Chris thought it didn’t work then scales started growing on his hands a deep bright crimson red and black claws started replacing his fingernails. As the scales spread across his arms they stated lose hair along with the rest of his body hair and same growth Raptora took Chris started but as he grew in height his limbs started to decreasing in size but still turned into strong lithe feminine arms. As scales started appearing on his body his shoulders and waist compression into a strong muscle filled torso with the same six pack Raptora held. Next six inch Neon bright red, yellow and orange feathers started sprouting on her arms and spine. Just as soon Chris started getting comfortable a budding feeling manifested in his chest as a pair of shapely breasts formed covered by red scales. Chris couldn’t believe what he was witnessing a truly womanly feature forming on his body and he couldn’t believe how good it felt as he moved his new clawed hands on them as if dopamine was being shot right through his heart and he wasn’t going to be a he anymore soon. As the scales approached his lower body he felt his hips widen, then he felt his groin start to be pressed against his body with his testes digging their way into his/her body turning into ovaries as they ascended. The sac then began folding into itself forming an opening as that appeared to a budding vagina his/her shrinking into the new opening becoming a perfect full set of female reproduction organs. If Chris thought she felt pleasure the formation of her vagina was if a wake-up call to her entire nervous system making the rest of the transformation all the more sensual experience. As her euphoria peaked her legs became strong feathered digitigrade extremities with feet forming three clawed toes with one on each foot turning into a large sickle claw. With her powerful legs complete a new limb started protruding from her lower spine becoming a four foot long muscle packed tail covered in bright colored feathers forming a foot wide radius fan at the end. All that remained of the old Chris was her head which was now speedily turning into a long muzzled raptor like head filled with razor sharp teeth, receding nose and ears and growing red scales. Her hair soon fell out only to be replaced by brilliantly fiery feathers on top of her head giving her a strikingly beautiful profile. Then her eyes finally turned into a blazing sunlight yellow with a black slit pupil. Chris stared at her new arm using her new high precision vision to take in all the colors of her feathers, her brain processing all the new smells, vibrations and tastes she was experiencing throwing her mind into overdrive. Once it settled she looked toward Raptora “Is it everything you thought it be?” She asked in her usually sultry voice. Chris then in a feminine smoky voice “It’s everything and more. I almost hate you a little more for denying me this for so long but I love you right now for how I feel right now. From now on you can call me Droma” Droma then stepped toward Raptora and smiled at her sister. “So what are we waiting for, I smell something delicious in that jungle and I don’t want it getting away”  Droma asked. “Just thinking what we should do with the Morphomax” replied Raptora she then processed to drop the ray on the ground and with one high power stomp crushed the device with her foot “Since were never turning back, we won’t be needing that anymore”. The two Raptor then went on to dash into the jungles the start of a new species called Saurians.</p>
