<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty decided on what Dustin would become quickly. It would benefit himself and get rid of Dustin. And to top that, he could simply built it as a trap for Dustin. Smiling at his idea he stood up and walked over to Dustin&#39;s room, knocking on the door.<br />
Dustin was still trying to understand what happened. How could Ty change him the way he did? And how could his parents say it was normal? Could he get Ty to restore his body back to normal? He was still thinking in such lines as someone knocked on his door. As he didn´t answer, he heard Ty ask from outside: “Hey Dustin, can we talk?”<br />
Dustin took a second to think before he replied: “Sure, come in.” As Dustin sat on his bed, Ty took his desk chair after closing the door. Before Dustin could ask, Ty started with: “I´m sorry, Dustin. It seems that I got the power to change things and as I wanted you to understand me I made you a late bloomer like myself.” Ah, that would explain it, at least if it was the truth. <br />
But Dustin had also thought about how he bullied Ty and if he has possibly earned this punishment in some way, so he asked: “Why do you apologize to me, Ty? I´ve not been nice to you, and never apologized myself?”<br />
“It just felt the right thing to do, as it wasn´t planned. Maybe if I had known about it beforehand, but then it still wouldn´t be right to do. I will try to change you back now.” Ty said, and wished for Dustin to return to normal, which he did seconds later. <br />
“Thanks, Ty. I will try to be nicer to you, after all I now know how easily you could get revenge on me.” Dustin said, but thinking about how to get revenge on Ty himself.<br />
Ty then suggested: “Do you want to be bigger and stronger maybe? See it as compensation for making you smaller?” Ty hid his smile as Dustin agreed. He willed him to agree to his next sentence before saying: “Okay, then let´s go into the garden. If I do something wrong you wouldn´t want to hit your head on your ceiling, right?”<br />
So they moved outside, Dustin only wearing his boxers, and Ty told him where to stand, laughing mentally about how easy it was. As Dustin stood in his spot Ty started with an easy wish. Dustin wouldn´t notice that his feet sunk into the earth underneath him as he stood there, legs close to each other. Then he started the changes for him with another wish.<br />
Dustin didn´t feel anything at first, nor did his viewpoint change enough for him to notice any difference. Being not really patient he asked after around half a minute: “You can start the growing, Ty. I didn´t came out here with you to wait for nothing.”<br />
Ty grinned at him. “But it has already started, you just didn´t notice it. There is more then one way to grow bigger, Dustin.” Ty had willed himself to see through the earth beneath Dustin and could see that his feet had already changed into thick roots, reaching in every direction for at least four meters while being also four deep. <br />
Dustin looked down in shock, thinking Ty had started to make him fatter instead of bigger, but as far as he could see his belly was the same as before as well. Just then one of his new roots, maybe the former little toe of his left foot touched something in the earth, something slimy. When he tried to to lift his foot away from whatever that was he couldn´t lift his foot. <br />
He looked down further then before and was shocked to see his feet were under the earth. All tries he made to get his feet out were unsuccessful. “Very funny Ty. Why stuck my feet under the earth? I´m not a plant.” <br />
Ty laughed before he answered: “Are you sure, Dustin? But you said you havn´t changed, that&#39;s not true. You have grown bigger, you just can´t see it. I would guess you have tripled in size already.” While Dustin looked shocked at him, Ty let Dustin&#39;s boxers vanish from his body, leaving him naked.<br />
Dustin only got over his shock as he felt some tickling in his legs. As he looked down again, he saw that his legs started to merge and turned into a rough, brown surface. “What the hell are you doing to me, Ty?” Dustin screamed at him, making Ty only laugh more. The process crawled up slowly, letting Dustin grow along the way.<br />
Ty only answered after the changes had passed Dustin&#39;s cock, the only thing that hadn´t changed into wood below his stomach. “Oh Dustin, I asked if you would want to get bigger and stronger. You get both, just not the way you thought about. You see I played with you. I wanted to get rid of you, but this way you will be useful for me afterwards. You will become the second tree in this garden, just in the right distance to the other for a hammock.” <br />
Dustin again looked shocked at Ty. So this had all been a trick? “You can´t do this to me Ty. Please stop this.” Dustin tried to beg more, but Ty hold up his hand to stop him. “Oh no Dustin, I´m tired of you. But now I guess its time to become a good tree, as they stay silent.”<br />
“No Ty. Plea.....” was all that got out before Dustin&#39;s mouth was covered with bark, silencing him. The bark stopped just underneath his eyes by now. His neck had expanded and you could no longer see were it had been. Dustin&#39;s arms had raised up and were also slowly covered in bark and turning into branches as Ty moved over to touch him.<br />
“See, strong and big, like we agreed on.” said Ty laughing as he knocked on Dustin&#39;s bark-covered chest. His body stretched even higher, his head by now four meter above the ground. More branches started to grew out of his body, all from above his waist. Below that was only one thing remaining, Dustin&#39;s cock, for which Ty had another thing planned. As Dustin&#39;s eyes and ears were covered and vanished Dustin could still see and hear, just from every part of his body.<br />
“You know, a tree didn´t need a cock like you still have. But as I need a clasp for my hammock I can use it as such.” Dustin screamed at Ty mentally, begging for him to stop, but Ty didn´t heard or just ignored him. He yelped mentally when his cock changed into a clasp for a hammock, firmly holding inside his now tree body. <br />
Ty willed another one out of the second tree, before he unfolded something out of his pocket. Dustin saw it was a small towel, but Ty just willed it to change into his new hammock. Soon he had it spanned between the two trees and instantly tested it. Again Dustin screamed mentally, but this time in pain as Ty was only hold by his former cock and it felt as if his whole weight hang from it.<br />
After enjoying an hour in his new hammock, Ty moved inside again, leaving the new tree shadow his own window, another positive quality of the changed Dustin. Ty willed only one thing in Dustin&#39;s favor, and that was that nobody would try to break any branches off or fell him. He would be robust to withstand any storm, so he would stand there forever, or as long as Ty didn´t change his mind.</p>
