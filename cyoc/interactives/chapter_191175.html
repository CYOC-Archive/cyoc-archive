<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Looks like you’re getting both.” Kyle says, as Jennifer feels a flash of heat on her face. She lowers the phone for a moment just too look around, unsure of what just happened.<br />
<br />
“You remember last year when that one kid visiting from junior high peed his pants cause they wouldn’t let him leave?” He snarled, each word coming out with a distain that rocked Jennifer to her core, though she was not sure why, though she did not know that it wasn’t his words that struck her in her soul.<br />
<br />
“You remember how you humiliated him to his class and asked him if he needed a diaper? Well, Let’s let that be the basis on which you learn your lesson. Your transformation is that you will grow younger by a month for every ounce you piss, and just so you don’t wizz out of existence; every time you shit you grow back to your original age.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt the urge to do many things, like roll her eyes, call this guy an idiot, a freak, a weirdo even. She wanted to hang up, she wanted to block his number and go back to getting ready for school, but her boys just wouldn’t let her. She clung to the phone as he spoke. “And for your dare? I want you to go to a gas station, buy two of the largest soda cups you can buy, fill them to the brim, drink them and repeat throughout the day.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt her lips fight her as she tried to argue, her legs stiffened as she wanted to move. “You have a nice day at school, Jennifer. I hope you have fun finger painting and all.” There was a click and the line was dead. Jennifer’s body released as she fell to the floor, feeling a great deal of exhaustion as she started to pick herself up. Before she could even think, her body began to move all on its own. “What the fuck?!” She said as she opened and closed the door, leaving her missing sock and shoes.<br />
<br />
<br />
As she stepped outside, she made her way onto the sidewalk, she felt the heat of the concrete burn her vulnerable foot. Witch each step, she had realized the horrible truth of this moment; the closest gas station to her was about 5 miles away from her, she would have to pass through the school’s sports center to get there.<br />
<br />
“Well… shit.”<br />
<br />
As the cheer team practiced, a few of them took note that Jennifer appeared to be approaching, but she seemed to be limping slightly. It turns out that when you walk that far mostly barefoot on hot concrete, it really takes its toll. Some of the girls approach in her sorry state.<br />
<br />
“Jennifer, what room you so long? Also, god, what happened to your shoes?” One had said.<br />
<br />
“It’s… I’m not sure?” Jennifer walked onto the rubber runway of the track where the cheerleaders often practiced, though she did not stop.<br />
<br />
“Jen, what… where are you going? We need to practice!”<br />
<br />
“I can’t stop. I… I’ve been dared?” Jennifer didn’t know what to think about her situation, but her words had an impact. A set of girls didn’t understand, some knew too well. Those who did began to follow her. “We can help you, what did the freak who put you up to this say?” Jennifer felt a bit of warmth, she was glad to know her compatriots we’re on the same level with her.<br />
<br />
“I have to go to the closest gas station, buy two of the largest cups they have and repeatedly fill them up and chug them all day long.” She said, the words coming out a bit more monotone than she had probably realized. With this, the small sect of girls formulated a plan to help her in her troubles.<br />
<br />
They quickly found a way to get her in a car instead of walking, it was simple as putting a car in her path and locking the door and driving before she could get out, it was almost as if whatever was driving her realized she was getting there fast.<br />
<br />
After this, the group dispersed into the store and got everything she needed. They paid for them and met her at the front before she could really set foot in the store. The large sodas in hand, she began to suck on the straws with a furious force as the girls looked on. She very gently let some tears flow, she felt relief. Relief in that she didn’t have to walk the whole way, that her friends helped her through it and that they would understand.<br />
<br />
“You’re lucky you just got a weird dare, Jen, the last time one of our own got hit they got turned into a bird. She’s still in Mr. Lamberts office.” One girl had said. She was shocked to hear that, she never know that was the case. She’d genuinely thought that Rebecca had moved away.<br />
<br />
“You know…” one girl, Venessa, spoke up. “A week ago, someone got me with it. I actually did transform. I didn’t realize how bad those could really be until I hear about Becca, but fortunately for me they gave me bigger boobs.” She said. “Even then, though, the guy that did it was gross as hell.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer was halfway through her first cup as Venessa made her plight known. She thought Venessa was stuffing but they seemed real now. She, well, she wasn’t sure what to think or how to feel about this information coming in. Like, until this moment she didn’t realize that this whole ordeal was real and that it affected some of her friends. Moreover, it seemed to affect all of her friends. One by one, they all talked about their dares, some showed off their transformations. Apparently, one of them was hiding that they’d been turned into a boy, one had been wearing a wig to hide that their forehead had a second mouth with some tape over it.<br />
<br />
As they all let Jennifer know the truth, she finishes her final cup and as if by auto pilot, goes back inside to get more.<br />
<br />
As she walks in, she feels the mass of carbonated liquid rolling in her stomach. She was bloated to a great degree, a good many burps came out as she filled both cups back up to full and just began sucking again, all the while the girls following her take her back outside to the car, taking her back to the football field.<br />
<br />
“So you have to drink from those cups… all day?” One had said. “Well, you don’t have to necessarily fill up at the gas station, so there’s a loophole.” Jennifer’s body began to relax (relatively) as she heard this. Maybe the logic of the dare made things easier. Jennifer’s stomach gurgled loudly, causing the occupants of the car to grow silent. Jennifer was noticeably bloated from all the soda and carbonation, but she just couldn’t stop drinking. They hadn’t even reached the football field when she ran out, which lead to her unbuckling her seat belt.<br />
<br />
The girls beside her in the car began to hold her down as she tried to essentially jump out of the moving car. “Thank y’all for helping me with this” Jennifer said, struggling against the girls and burping and groaning quite a bit.<br />
<br />
“You’re good, girl. We get how rough the dates can be.”<br />
<br />
It was then, she felt an urgency like no other. “Oh god…” she said, squeezing her legs together for dear life. “Y’all… I didn’t just get… dared.”<br />
<br />
All of the girls looked to her in an instant. “You’re transformed?!” They shouted in unison, the two who held her down releasing some of the pressure on her, making her feel a little more at ease. “What’s gonna happen?” Vanessa asked, eyeing Jennifer over like a Hawk.<br />
<br />
“The weirdo… he… said that if I pee….” She paused for some time, she was in pain from then pressure. “I’m gonna get younger.” The car fell silent for a bit. “… do you have to g-“<br />
<br />
“FUCKING YES, REALLY BADLY.”<br />
<br />
They all arrived at the field, parking as close as they could to the bathrooms, and Jennifer busted out of the car in a mad dash for the door. The weight of the 4 giant cups worth of liquid sloshed around in her bladder in the most uncomfortable way, she felt as if with each step she would lose it all and let it go then and there, but she knew that’s what HE wanted. She was determined, she didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of seeing her pee herself in front of her friends. She was mere feet away from the door when she heard it; the lock. Someone locked the bathrooms from the inside. She grabbed at the door and pulled as hard as she could, the desperation nearly pushing her to pop. She heard a snickering behind the door, Kyle&#39;s snickering. She knew she had lost, and at this point she no longer cared. She went.<br />
<br />
As the relief set in, the world around her shifted. She did not realize it then, but she’d essentially drank 176 oz of soda, and right now a good amount of that had rushed through her system and down her legs. Her face was beat red, her heart raced as she felt it shrink down with age. The girls who drover her crowded around her, hiding her from the rest of the team as a massive puddle formed around the poor little girl.<br />
<br />
It felt like forever when she felt herself get to the final little bit of pee came out, and by this point she’d come to grips with the reality of her situation:<br />
<br />
She was young. Really young. 3. She’d pissed away 176 months of her life, just over 14 years. Her soaked uniform clung to shoulders like a little tent. She’d looked up to the girls around her and in a small voice said “I wanna go home.”</p>
