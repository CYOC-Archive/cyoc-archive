<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Freddie Rafferty was now a big, strong, 12 year old boy, now trapped in the body of a much older man. He bet he was bigger and stronger than any other 12 year old boy in his area, except for maybe other Mind Transfer students. He couldn&#39;t wait to meet other kids like himself. <br />
<br />
Dad had picked out his new clothes. They were okay, but he felt like things were a bit...missing. He felt like he should be wearing black leather and vests, tight wife-beater shirts, torn jeans, and a silver necklace. He looked at himself in the mirror and envisioned these things. <br />
<br />
Freddie didn&#39;t know the name of the man whose life he had taken. He had been a prisoner. Now that man was dying in his body, and he had a whole new life. Whoever this guy had been, he had really big muscles, and was old enough to be his own grandfather! Not that many old men looked like this! He found himself constantly flexing. His 21 inch biceps fit very snugly inside his new rather preppy clothing choices: striped shirts, cardigans, clothes that made him look &quot;gentlemanly&quot; according to his mother. He stroked his new, yellow-white beard. He rubbed his bald head. It was going to take a while to get used to this! he thought. <br />
<br />
At the doctor&#39;s office, they brought him in after a few days to assess him. On the way there, Freddie noticed that he understood what his father was doing. He didn&#39;t know how to drive but somehow he knew he could completely take over for his father and he had just remembered it. Sort of the way he remembered how to ride a bike. He just knew he knew how to do it. <br />
<br />
He told his doctor, Dr. Kubiak, all of these things. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m also, like, humming songs in the shower that I don&#39;t even know that are all really old, from like the 70s or whatever. I didn&#39;t tell my Dad. I don&#39;t want him to freak out.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well. We can arrange a driving test for you to see how you fare. The DMV works with us on these issues now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really? They&#39;ll let me drive?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s up to your parents as well, but I&#39;ll advise them to get you behind the wheel as soon as possible. Now, then. Any nausea? Vomiting? Sore throat? Itchiness? Any headaches? Any signs of illness whatsoever?&quot; <br />
<br />
Freddie actually felt great. He hadn&#39;t felt this great in a long time! <br />
<br />
His parents were delighted that he seemed to be doing so well. They followed him to an office so he could talk to all three of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. So, I&#39;m not seeing signs of personality decay. That&#39;s good. But with every mind transfer, the brain is going to retain a LOT from the previous lifetime. That brain of yours knows how to drive, it knows how to do a lot of other things as well. You&#39;re going to be discovering you know how to do things you never knew how to do.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...I saw some motorcycles near the parking lot riding down the street and...I know how to drive one.&quot; Freddie shook his enormous, bald head. &quot;This is crazy, Dad!&quot; He turned to his father. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know. We read the literature. We&#39;re just really glad there&#39;s no behavior changes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet. There might be down the road. Just report anything to my office the minute anything unusual happens. There are bound to be what we call &#39;hiccups&#39; wherein the individual has flashes of another personality. Now, don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s almost never violent. You didn&#39;t inherit this man&#39;s emotions, but you did inherit his genetic makeup. Genetically, there are certain traits you have probably inherited. This man was very dominant throughout his life, he was a boss to other people. We find that in these cases, individuals personality shifts over the first few months to become more dominant. The mind transfer process means we usually target the part of the brain where impulsiveness occurs the most and tone it down ever so slightly, so you shouldn&#39;t be experiencing too much outside your normal personality range.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a question. I have big muscles now so like...should I be going to a gym or something?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s bound to be some hardwiring for working out with weights by this point, and we&#39;ll be assigning you a physical therapist who will briefly show you the adult ropes for working out and training exercises. I have some brochures for you as to what symptoms to look out for as you experience any &quot;personality mesh&quot; as we in the industry put it. The range for you should be low. Other, higher risk transfers are usually the ones where we worry about personality decay. <br />
<br />
And now, by law, I must discuss Freddie&#39;s physical changes with him privately. He has never been through puberty and we have to go over the whole gamut with him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we be here for that?&quot; Catherine said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mooooom. Gross. I don&#39;t want to talk to you about sex. I&#39;d rather talk to a stranger. I mean, a professional guy type of person. Not just any stranger. You know what I...mean.&quot; Freddie got embarrassed. This whole bein an adult thing was already shaping up to be kind of weird and embarrassing. It was as though he felt he didn&#39;t deserve this big, hulking, muscular frame. But he loved being this big! <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well we can talk about it later, too, I suppose.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;When the boy is ready, dear,&quot; Saul told his wife as they exited the room. <br />
<br />
Freddie turned back to Dr. Kubiak.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...let&#39;s have a talk, Fred. Mind if I call you Fred?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No. I guess not.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We usually suggest trying out more adult names rather than nicknames. You just look like more of a Fred than a Freddie to me. You&#39;re too BIG to be a Freddie, you know what I&#39;m sayin?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so. My voice is pretty deep now and I look like someone&#39;s buff grandpa now. All my friends would probably be super shocked to see me!&quot; He held up a bicep and flexed, and grinned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you discovered masturbation yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? N-no.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Has your penis gotten hard yet? Have you gotten stimulated sexually at all?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not with my Mom around all the time! She won&#39;t leave my side!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dr. Kubiak chuckled. &quot;Yeah, moms can be like that after a mind transfer. She lost her little baby. Now you&#39;re a big strapping man with big muscles and a big dick as well. Which means you&#39;ll be wanting sex fairly soon, but you have to know the basics. First of all, your body is gay. We never reveal the orientation of the body before someone takes it. This is because we don&#39;t want to deal with time hassles from parents making all sorts of requests. We just don&#39;t have the time. We don&#39;t have enough donors to match everyone right away so when we get a good match, we need to just seal the deal as quickly as possible.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So like, I like men now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, as a matter of fact. And I got a call from your donor&#39;s boyfriend. He wants to send you all of the donor&#39;s old clothes and a lot of his things. He won&#39;t be needing them now. And don&#39;t you feel guilty about that. The state wouldn&#39;t have confiscated his body if he hadn&#39;t done some terrible things. You can be a productive citizen. Now, he was a motorcycle enthusiast, so you probably do know how to drive one, but you still need to pass a class on motorcycle and driving safety and that will take a month of classes once a week. We will schedule you for tests once a month for six months. We will also be putting you in a special school for children who have been transferred to an adult body. It&#39;s called the Anstey School. They are very renowned. Their instructors are used to their pupils being different. And they can fast track you to job training and graduation. Most students are not going to spend much time in the school because they can access their adult knowledge, and that can lead to them entering the same vocation, or maybe you want to try your own path. They can help you to do that in a very timely and efficient way. Did you have any ideas about what kind of job you want to look for?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I just became a grown up a few days ago. But I definitely feel like going to the gym now. And I kind of want to go to my favorite bar...I...&quot; Fred squinted his eyes. &quot;I like beer?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who doesn&#39;t? I&#39;ll grab a drink with you sometime. But promise me you&#39;ll wait a few more days before trying alcohol and try to get your parent&#39;s permission. They often don&#39;t like their kids drinking, but I&#39;ll just tell them you&#39;re going to go it eventually, so it may has well be around responsible adults.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that is so cool!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s part of being an adult. You should have a drink now and then to socialize. It will help you relate to other men. Now, I have to talk to you about sex, sexually transmitted diseases, basic prevention and the basics of gay sex, including what to do for tops and bottoms.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fred&#39;s eyes bulged as the doctor went over the basics, even showing him a brief porn video. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, if you feel something down there in your groin, that&#39;s perfectly natural...&quot; <br />
<br />
Fred did feel something. Before he knew it his snake was turning into a club!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s hard. It&#39;s hard! Wow! I have a boner! I&#39;ve never had a boner before!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to rub one out? Would you like to try?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just take this over to the booth at the end, there&#39;s a light switch and a small bed. You can find a position you like. Try and make it as hard as possible for as long as you can and that&#39;s how you orgasm.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Fred said, overwhelmed. <br />
<br />
Looking at his naked reflection, Fred couldn&#39;t help but grin. He was so muscular! His chest was powerful! His back had wings that he could feel all the time! He couldn&#39;t believe how big they were! How did you even get a back this big!? He grinned. His dick was rock hard and swung up. He barely touched it and it hardened to the point of making him gasp. He grasped his massive tool and started pumping it. He turned away from the mirror. The porn on the laptop played in front of him. An older daddy type of man, muscular, hairy, beginning to gray fucked a young college aged boy, smooth and thin. <br />
<br />
He felt himself climaxing. He gasped and moaned. It hurt so bad at the tip of his peepee. He felt like crying, it felt so GOOD!!! AND THEN WHOOOOOOOOSH! Hormones flooded his brain as cum shot out in a jet, splattering the wall. He felt it again, and again. Ropes spread out all over, all in a circle...he was like a fucking lawn sprinkler of cum! <br />
<br />
He gathered himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was great!&quot; He sounded so manly. His pec muscles throbbed. His biceps jiggled their enormous muscles as he moved his arm. A tattoo covered half of one of his new enormous arm muscles; a barbed wire pattern that made him look truly badass. <br />
<br />
Dad promised they could go out past the city limits and practice Fred driving around, and chose a drive in movie theater that had been closed down so that Fred could get behind the wheel for the first time. Fred was incredibly excited and couldn&#39;t wait!</p>
