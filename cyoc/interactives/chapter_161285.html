<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy was really happy walking to the courtroom, he&#39;d awaited for this for so long. The day he could be free from his parents!<br />
<br />
Since he was 4 years old, he has been in commercial, tv shows and, more recently, movies. It&#39;s a dream to be as successful as Andy, but for him it was a nightmare because of his parents. All that money he earned was fully managed by them, he can&#39;t buy things or do cool stuff like other famous kids he met. His life was working, working, working but nothing of fun. <br />
<br />
One day during a filming, he heard his parents discussing with the director, a young man who was very nice to him and usually told him about his incredible life in Hollywood. Later that day, the director came to him and told him the his parents were the worst, something that Andy agreed and started this idea of emancipation.<br />
<br />
When Andy&#39;s lawyer, a good friend of the director, came to his house and gave his parents a citation to the courtroom they couldn&#39;t believe it. They tried to convince their son but Andy just ignored them. In consequence, they hired a good attorney and followed her instructions prior to the trial.<br />
<br />
That day, a lot of people were in and outside the courtroom. Reporters, fans and even some celebrities could be seen around. Andy took his place next to his lawyer, he was grinning all the time. His parents and their lawyer did the same on their respective place, a moment later the trail began.<br />
<br />
As a kid, Andy didn&#39;t understand all the things that happened. Those complicated law words and legal stuff were alien to his ears. Sometimes he glanced at his parents who occasionally cried and begged for the court&#39;s comprehension. He kinda felt bad for them, but them he saw his lawyer triumphantly smiling and he thought he was winning like if it&#39;s a videogame or football play.<br />
<br />
Several hours had passed and Andy was bored to death. All these things take too long? Sometimes he completely ignored what were people saying and he just nodded when he was asked a question without even hear it. A few relatives and friends made their testimony, including the director who motivated him to do this. Then the court asked for a short break before they make their decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m so bored!&quot; Andy told to his lawyer. &quot;It&#39;s the worst day ever!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t think the same in a moment when we win.&quot; His lawyer told him with a big grin on his face. &quot;We have practically won already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me. Can we have a word with our son in private?&quot; Andy&#39;s parents asked his lawyer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I usually say no, but whatever... This game is on the bag!&quot; The lawyer cockily said as he leaves them alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Son... Are you sure you want to keep going with these?&quot; Andy&#39;s father told him. &quot;I know we can found better solution than emancipation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we promise we will be better parents.&quot; Andy&#39;s mother said. &quot;We&#39;ll take you to Disneyland or so... Please, stay with us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Disneyland? That&#39;s all?&quot; Andy replied. &quot;I filmed a lot of commercials there! No! I want to be free from you! To do whatever I want with my money!! You hear it... MY MONEY!!&quot;<br />
<br />
His parents tried to talk more but the break time was over. They had to return to the courtroom. A minutes later, the judge appears and the court was ready to make its decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Andrew Galar. Please rise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy stood up very excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Andrew Galar, I find you are capable of earning your own money to live and we looked at your parents accounts. They will have to give you 50% of all their savings and properties because you&#39;re going to be officially emancipated. However, according to the new laws in the country, people under 18 can&#39;t live by their own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy smiled disappeared from his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Therefore, you had two options. The first one and most common is getting you a tutor responsible of you. But your lawyer proclaimed that you didn&#39;t want that. So, the alternative is...&quot; Andy smiled at his lawyer who smiled him back. &quot;Body swap you with an adult man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?!!&quot; Andy said in surprise to his lawyer, but he just kept smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Body swap will commence within 24 hours. This sentence will be carried out over the court of the next six years, by which time you will be remitted back to your own body cause it&#39;ll be legal by then,&quot; Judge Loggia continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I wanted to be free from my parents not from my body!!&quot; Andy yelled but judge Loggia had already made his verdict. <br />
<br />
He looked in horror at his lawyer grinning in his black suit like if everything went as he planned. He looked at his parents who curiously weren&#39;t crying like he expected. In fact, he could heard them asking their judge if they could keep his body like if he was some kind of object. No one but him seems worried about his sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, I don&#39;t want to swap my body! Please, mr. lawyer. There&#39;s a way to change this, right? Right?!&quot; Andy burst out, about to cry. He would rather having a tutor if he knew this beforehand!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Galar, we&#39;ve been over this,&quot; Judge Loggie warned. &quot;This is my final verdict. Now, if you&#39;re worried about your acting career, this good man had said that he&#39;s already made a casting to choose your new body.&quot; Andy realized that judge Loggia was talking about the director. &quot;We also have counseling available to help you make the transition to life in your new frames. Now, let&#39;s move on to the next case...&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy felt himself near tears as he was led out of the room...<br />
<br />
His parents didn&#39;t wait for him, nor his attorney or the director. So, he asked for a taxi that drove him to his hotel room. When he got there, he found out that it was already all over his social media. Everyone was talking about it, internet, tv, radio. Andy didn&#39;t expect this turn of the events and he ran to his room and cried. He didn&#39;t want to lose his youth. A childhood that he never enjoyed. His beautifully cute charisma and his angelical face.<br />
<br />
Andy wondered if he would still be famous after that. Gorgeous slim eyes and chestnut hair, thick in the front, and looks that could kill from a mile away. He didn&#39;t have any imperfection on his skin but he had two gorgeous dimples that drove any girl wild. Just one smile melted their hearts. He used his looks to get everybody&#39;s attention. All of it could be gone...<br />
<br />
And now, how they will look at him? He will be handsome or ugly? Oh god, that last one would be so horrible! Being forced to go around as a repulsive man who nobody wants to look at!<br />
<br />
He cried into his pillow and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
The next day dawned. His last day as an 12 year old kid. He got washed up. He looked at his nice young body. It was such beautiful and perfect. He hadn&#39;t reached puberty yet and now someone else is going to take care of his body in that difficult age. What if he didn&#39;t take care of it and his body turned obese or deformed? No, he don&#39;t even want to think about it.<br />
<br />
And then he thought about his dick, now it&#39;s small and useless, but he was expecting to lose his own virginity at least! He wondered if his new body was virgin too. Of course not! But then he frightened at the idea of making sex. His mind doesn&#39;t have the capability to process it yet. He was straight but, what happens if his new body belonged to an homosexual? He will be aroused by men? And his former body will get those feelings as well? He almost puked at the idea of kissing some old dudes.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day became a blur. The drive to the hospital...getting prepped by the doctors, getting through the decontamination sprays...lying down on what looked like a cat scan machine....only it sealed up after he was in there. There were so many lights and sounds and a high beeping...he fell asleep.<br />
<br />
The light.<br />
<br />
And then he was groggy. His head hurt. There was a light above. He almost made out someone saying something with his name. He moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s waking up,&quot; one of the techs said.</p>
