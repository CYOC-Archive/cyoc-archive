<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Whatever had been taken from him kept Sid from enjoying the game.  Sure, he had a surge of physical energy in him from the muscular expansion but that only went so far.  In fact, it only seemed to really give him any ambition when he became emotionally agitated about something.<br /><br />

He shot a sidelong glance to his right.<br /><br />

Something like Chris, most specifically.  Damn, rich bastard.<br /><br />

But apart from that...  He sighed as the dice stopped on a "3" and "4".  His piece slid forward a bit and -like Chris before him- came to the intersection and a choice.  Looking ahead, he could feel a sigh of resignation fill him.  If he stayed on the short track, he'd land on yet another one of those damn "CHANGE" spaces.  Three in a row!<br /><br />

"Fuck," he muttered in his deep, growling voice.  "Is this game rigged?"<br /><br />

"Probably..." responded the Incubus, noting that everyone was avoiding looking at him.  "If it can steal someone's True Name how far of a stretch is it to imagine that it can fix the random rolls of dice, too?"<br /><br />

"Great."<br /><br />

Sid counted and looked at the trek to the next ring of spaces, out.  The third ring was slightly longer than the innermost track but had fewer of those accursed "CHANGE" spaces.  He could only assume that the changes from those were permanent, especially since each of the colored spaces always clarified themselves as "TEMPORARY CHANGE".<br /><br />

Yellow.  The space in the third ring was Yellow.  Un-set as of yet.<br /><br />

He looked at Tyler's face, just visible over the top of the table on the other side of the board across from him.  "Look, I know you suggested we get through this as fast as possible but -man- I don't want another big change.  I ... I can't do it."<br /><br />

"Sid..."<br /><br />

"Hey; my choice, right?" asked the lion, reaching out and tapping his piece along the track to the next ring, out.  The small pawn, as exaggerated in its musculature as the player who moved it, slid a tiny bit and then finished its journey on its own, sliding neatly onto the yellow space.<br /><br />

Once more, the lettering came up on all of the yellow spaces.  This time, though, there was only one word left:  "MENTAL".  Only the black spaces had -as of yet- not been landed upon.<br /><br />

Everyone except for the Incubus seemed to hold their breath as their eyes turned to the center of the board for its pronouncement.<blockquote><i><b>TEMPORARY CHANGE<br />-5 turns-</b><br /><br />

"What some will fear most may not be "the end",<br />
Your identity is yours, rest assured.<br />
But then there's the part you've hid from your friends:<br />
Your lackluster libido's now cured."</i></blockquote>

"Lackluster libido?"  Tyler had been standing on his chair to see the center of the board and now looked across at his friend, curiously.  "You've never had libido problems, Sid..."<br /><br />

The lion, a growl half-caught in its throat, shuddered.  "I ... I don't think that's ... what it means..."<br /><br />

On the outside, the hugely muscled lion looked as he had, before.  His bulky body was still clad in the same tawny hide, cascading mane falling down around his shoulders and to the middle of his back.  His hands and feet were paw-like with pads on the finger tips and his tail swished behind him, nervously, as his rounded ears twitched.  Yes, on the outside, he was the same...<br /><br />

Inside, however, a storm was rising...<br /><br />

"Guys...  This ... this isn't good..."<br /><br />

Sid's quelled emotions were being pricked and prodded by long-kept-secret desires.  The raging hormones he'd kept in check as a teenager were slowly emerging, his immature fantasy life slowly reasserting itself.  He'd been like this before, when he'd been a closeted youth, but he'd overcome it.<br /><br />

He'd grown ... matured.<br /><br />

But the game ... the game was taking that away.<br /><br />

"Sid?  What's happening...?"<br /><br />

The voice belonged to Chris and even though he still loathed the little rich boy, just the sound of a sexy, handsome male made his pants instantly tight.<br /><br />

"No..." he muttered, reaching out to push the dice over to the demon, next to him.  "No, I won't ... give ... in..."<br /><br />

"What is it?" asked the demon with a slender smile that spoke to the suspicion he already had.<br /><br />

"I ... Oh, God; guys..."  He looked up, keeping his eyes as far from the Incubus as possible.  "I ... when I was younger...  God, I ... I was like a total slut.  I..."  The lion clenched his eyes as his libido soared and grew stronger.  As his body had been modified in the last round, his desire for sex now matched that power.<br /><br />

His hand went to his crotch and massaged the rock-hard erection that he found there, beneath his jeans.  A shiver went through him at the touch and he squinted his eyes shut even more.  "I...I'm feeling it again.  Always horny...  Always fantasizing..."<br /><br />

He stopped talking and, with both hands, started undoing his fly.  "Guys, I need to get off, now.  The game ... the game woke it up in me again...  Magnified it..."<br /><br />

"Do tell," said the demon with a cold smile.<br /><br />

"Enough of that," snapped Chris with a glance to the Incubus.  "Just roll the fucking dice..."<br /><br />

The demon almost snapped back at him, but a glance from the diminutive Tyler made him think twice.  There was so much pain in the room already ...so many emotions for him to feed on... why not keep it going?  Out loud, he said, "fine..." and picked up the dice.<br /><br />

Sid stopped himself, his hands in his overly-tight jeans, looking up at his friends (and Chris) with embarrassment on his leonine features.  "Guys, I ... I can't..."<br /><br />

"Sid, it doesn't bother me."<br /><br />

The lion looked at the diminutive Tyler, questioningly.<br /><br />

"Look," he continued, "we've all seen it before; if you have to do it, do it.  We won't mind..."<br /><br />

Sid shook his head.  "It's not like that," he gasped, rubbing his rock-hard erection with his large paws.  "I ... I used to think only about sex; it was all I dreamed of..."<br /><br />

"So did the rest of us," Tyler said, in a low voice, trying to agree with his friend lest he start shrinking again.  "It's nothing to be ashamed of..."<br /><br />

"It is if you're nearly an adult," snapped Sid, not really noticing the inch that his disagreement took from his friend.  "Besides, oh God...  I ... I want it so bad...  I ... I might lose control and ... and then..."  Plaintively, he spread his huge, heavily muscled arms for emphasis on his unspoken threat.<br /><br />

Chris gasped, his rabbit-like fears reasserting themselves at what the lion hadn't said.<br /><br />

Tyler, on the other hand, shook his head.  "No, Sid.  Listen...  The game said it had restored your libido.  That doesn't make you a rapist!  You understand me?"<br /><br />

Sid panted and looked at his tiny friend, now only about 2'8".  "But, Ty..."<br /><br />

"No.  You listen to me, Sid.  You aren't a rapist, Ok?  Even if that game made you the horniest guy in creation, you <i>still</i> are in control of yourself, right?  Right?!"  Tyler's face darkened with resolve.  "Prove it to us.  Prove it to yourself!  You have the willpower, Sid...  You can stop yourself..."<br /><br />

The lion half-rose out of his chair, his sex visible, now, for all to see.  His breaths were coming short, now, and his body began to inflate, again.  His stomach swelled a bit, followed by his chest, as he looked at the handsome men all around him.<br /><br />

He felt the desire to feel their flesh burning in his loins and he wanted them, badly.  He groaned aloud and gritted his sharp fangs, nearly biting his lower lip in the process.  He shook his head, flowing mane dancing around his shoulders like an angel's halo, and tried to focus past the searing desire.<br /><br />

Slowly, ever-so-slowly, he drew his hands away from his penis.  He felt a shudder go through him but the desire didn't abate.  It seemed to have reached a high point but wasn't ebbing.<br /><br />

He looked around the table, into each of the others' eyes, and sighed.  There was no danger of his detachment returning, now.  As he exerted his will, his emotions ran high.  But he had to hold off.  He had to control it!  Slowly, without refastening his pants, the lion sat down and rested his fists on the top of the table.  His erection still throbbed and he needed sexual release, but not yet.<br /><br />

He could hold on.<br /><br />

"Okay..." he said, slowly.  "You're right, Tyler.  I'm not a rapist..."  He growled under his breath and shook his head again, trying not to think about the other men's' bodies pressed against his own.  "But I still want to get off and I ... I don't want to wait for 'five turns'.  After this round, we take a break and I ... I'm going to my bedroom..."<br /><br />

Tyler nodded and kneeled back on his chair, his small height getting difficult for him to sit at the table like the others.  Sid was still rather roundish looking and, in addition to his freakish musculature, that made him wider than he was, tall.  The small man could only hope that Sid would be able to calm himself enough to both deflate and keep himself under control through this next round...<br /><br />

The Incubus, though, with his eyes on the lion, rolled the dice...</p>
