<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sheldon&#39;s feet swayed on the side of the cot anxiously. He knew Bran would be arriving any moment with his beloved space books. Bringing those books and reading them on the camp outskirts was one of the few things that made this yearly camp venture bearable. That is if you discount the annoying mosquitoes. The other thing was his constant summer companion, Brandon Summers. Most people call him Bran, and by most people, it&#39;s just Sheldon. If there was any person worthy of hearing what happened last night, it was Bran.<br />
<br />
The tent flap rustled and Bran ducked inside, a stag of dog-eared paperbacks in his arms. &quot;Hey, space cadet,&quot; he greeted with a grin. He padded over and plopped the books on the table beside the cot. Based on the books he brought, it was obvious he didn&#39;t think much about what he would bring, like these book series about Mars. He brought only two volumes out of six, and Sheldon already read this. Nevertheless, he was thankful for his friend&#39;s kind sentiment. &quot;Thought you might want these.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon smiled. Reading books would be a wonderful time to waste the day away in this tent, but he has more important matters to attend to so he set them aside for now. &quot;Thanks, Bran. Listen, I&#39;ve got to tell you something crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m all ears. Everyone&#39;s wondering what happened to you. Even Preston and his two goons are asking me.&quot; Bran inched closer and held tightly on Sheldon&#39;s shoulders. &quot;What the hell happened to you, dude!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First off, I&#39;m fine. You don&#39;t need to be such a worrywart. And second, I heard a boom outside the camp and followed it to a meteorite crater near the hills. It was a fresh impact, like it was still smoking and stuff. I approached it, but this weird slime creature attacked me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brain raised an eyebrow, his expression skeptical. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re fine? And a slime creature? Really? I thought you were just into stars and planets like Pluto, not little green men.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon bristled slightly at the dismissive tone but pressed on. &quot;I&#39;m serious! It was this glowing, pulsating thing. It tried to get inside me. Well… it did and made all sorts of weird stuff to me. I thought I was going to die, but all it did was give me these weird powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bran let out a hearty laugh as he collapsed on the floor. He was cackling hysterically, that he was gasping for air. &quot;I never took you for a joker, dude. Slime and going inside you? Are you sure you&#39;re not talking about something else?&quot; Bran&#39;s gaze hovered over his friend&#39;s crotch, and Sheldon took a few seconds to get what he meant. Bran stood again and let out a few more laughs before tapping Sheldon&#39;s shoulders. &quot;But seriously, did you smoke weed or mushrooms? I know other campers brought some over. Counselor Dean confiscated a bag the other day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon&#39;s face flushed with embarrassment and frustration. Convincing Bran was a challenging ordeal, but he hadn&#39;t expected outright mockery. He enjoyed his company, but his immaturity can be overwhelming sometimes. &quot;I told you I&#39;m not kidding. I&#39;ll just show you what I&#39;m talking about since you&#39;re acting like a jerk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon concentrated on his hand and willed it to transform. His fingers melted into green candlesticks before dropping into lobs on the tent&#39;s fabric floor. His palms rained on the floor and congealed into one green mass that leaped toward Brandon&#39;s shoulder. Bran&#39;s eyes widened as he watched, his draw dropping open in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, what the fuck!?&quot; Bran spat as he reached out a tentative finger to poke at the writhing mass of slime.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? I told you it was real. And it&#39;s not just my hand. I can transform my entire body into slime. Not only that, I could also do this.&quot; Sheldon&#39;s slime hand coiled tightly and sprung toward Brandon&#39;s ear. <br />
<br />
Brandon&#39;s eyes widened in shock and horror as he watched the slime invade his body. He opened his mouth to protest, but no words came out. Instead, his hand began to move on its own, clenching and unclenching in a jerky, unnatural fashion. Sheldon let him go eventually, but Bran could feel the time crawling and creeping all throughout his body.<br />
<br />
Sheldon grinned as he enjoyed the power he held over his friend. A flick of his thoughts was enough to feel Bran&#39;s flexing and relaxing muscles. He let a part of himself slide over Bran&#39;s strangely spacious cranial space, letting the thick slime course through the ventricles of his brain. This level of control felt like electricity running on both their bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty cool, huh?&quot; Sheldon said, his voice tinged with amusement. &quot;I can make you do whatever I want. Dance like a monkey, sing like a bird, or just sit there while I scan your brain. Although, that level of control needs all of my body inside you. I can&#39;t do much when it&#39;s only my hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon&#39;s slime burrowed deeper into Bran&#39;s brain, causing his face to contort with confusion and fear as he struggled to regain control of his body. Despite his efforts, Sheldon maintained a firm grip. With a sudden jerk, Sheldon withdrew the slime from Bran&#39;s ear. The boy&#39;s hand immediately stopped moving, and he slumped back against the tent wall, panting heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;What… what was that?&quot; Bran gasped. He pushed himself off the ground and sat beside Sheldon on the cot. &quot;What did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon shrugged. &quot;You weren&#39;t believing me, so I did something that you won&#39;t be able to deny. What I told you, I did not make them up. There was a meteorite and an alien gave me this power. I… I have its memories, and it wants to possess humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bran stared at Sheldon with eyes of fear and awe. &quot;This is crazy,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You really are some kind of freak. Like the good kind of freak! This… This is awesome!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon was taken aback and blinked at Bran&#39;s enthusiastic reaction. He expected Bran to be a bit angry at him for taking control of his body with permission. He tried to go against the idea, but the alien side of him compelled him to do so. To see Bran with the widest grin on his face was rather unexpected, but a welcome one. Sheldon was right to divulge his secrets with him. This eagerness... In a way, he was also a freak like Sheldon. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe it. You&#39;re one of the freakiest people I&#39;ve met. And that&#39;s an achievement once you meet my uncle. This year&#39;s summer camp will be one hell of an experience with that power of yours.&quot; Bran grabbed Sheldon&#39;s hand to inspect it. Sheldon sated his curiosity by turning them into slime and letting his friend play with it. &quot;So, what do we do now? I bet you could use it to prank the other campers. And fuck! We can finally get back at that bitch, Preston. That alien was heaven sent, Sheldon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It literally came from the heavens, but I get what you mean.&quot;</p>
