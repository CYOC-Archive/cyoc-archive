<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After their humiliating experience, Jason and David left the gym with a plan to meet at up a little later at the coffee shop near campus. Jason frequently studied there, but David had never been.  It’s funny how two people can live in the same town and never see each other based on the places they choose to frequent. It was purely by luck that Jason and David ran into each other at the gym. <br />
<br />
Driving home, Jason’s thoughts were a mix of how excited he was to see David again, how turned on he was by the huge Lee brothers, and how he would use the book to get back at them. <br />
<br />
After showering and putting on fresh clothes, Jason walked to the coffee shop. He arrived before David, as he lived much closer.<br />
<br />
On the walk over, he was happily impressed with his edits. The East Asian men he encountered were all tall and muscular. They had retained the beauty they had before his edits to the book, but it had a more masculine edge. Walking past a field, he slowed to watch two shirtless Japanese undergrads throwing a frisbee. They were both around 6’6” and nicely muscled, and their huge dicks bounced in their loose shorts as they moved to catch the frisbee. Jason wanted to find a place to sit and watch, but knew he couldn’t. <br />
<br />
At the coffee shop, Jason’s favorite barista was a sight to behold. Steven Nguyen had always been super friendly and Jason thought he was cute. Now, Steven was an absolute stud. At 6’8”, he looked out of place behind the counter. His tight black teeshirt hugged his muscular torso leaving little to the imagination. The big veins running down his biceps and across his forearms and large hands fascinated Jason. Steven gave Jason a big  cocky smile that said both hey buddy and, yeah, I know you want me. Jason smiled back sheepishly , told him he was waiting on a friend and then sat a table near the door to wait on David. <br />
<br />
David arrived wearing a fresh polo that showed off his full pecs, broad shoulders and narrow waist, and shorts that exposed his smooth sculpted legs. He may not have been as big as other Asian men, but he was still sexy as hell. Judging by the bulge in his shorts, he had a cock of at least average Asian size even if he was shorter than others. <br />
<br />
Jason’s pulse quickened as David pulled him into a hug.  Jason had considered asking David out before the edits, but always worried that he would lose David as a friend if  things didn’t work out.  <br />
<br />
“I’m so glad you said yes to coffee,” David said. “I have been thinking of you lately.”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad we ran into each other at the gym,” Jason replied, “I’ve missed you.”<br />
<br />
At the mention of the gym, David grimaced. “I should have stood up for you against those ass holes.”<br />
<br />
“And ended up in the hospital?” Jason said, “the Lees are huge, they could really hurt you.”<br />
<br />
David frowned, “some Asian men think they can treat others like shit just because they are so much bigger than everyone else. I hate that.” He continued “it just sucks being so small.”<br />
<br />
“Small” Jason exclaimed. “Nothing about you is small,” forgetting himself he continued “you are stupid sexy.”<br />
<br />
David grinned at this as Jason blushed and said, “sorry, I’ve made things awkward. <br />
<br />
“No you haven’t stupid. Why do you think I asked your cute ass to have coffee.” David said, “speaking of which, what would you like ? “<br />
<br />
When David came back with their drinks he said, “sorry about the small comment earlier, it was insensitive. As an Korean man, being under 6’6” is embarrassing.  I’ve been picked on and bullied my entire life. My dad is 6’9” and huge. I think I’m a disappointment to him. Really, I just I was big enough to put jerks like John and Mark in their place.”<br />
<br />
“Now enough with that,” David continued, “I’m here to see you.”  Jason smiled and continued to make conversation but the gears of his mind were turning. <br />
<br />
After the coffee shop, David and Jason had dinner and a drink. It was clear that neither of them wanted the evening to end. Jason invited David to his place for another drink. Their clothes were off before they made it to the bedroom door. <br />
<br />
Though the were the same height, David had 20 pounds on Jason and was much stronger. He used that strength to tease and pleasure Jason. Jason’s 11 inch cock was rock hard and leaking precum. David held Jason’s hands above his head as he gently stroked Jason dick, making it twitch and making Jason writhe while they made out. David’s own cock was rock hard. It was a good inch longer and much thicker than Jason’s. <br />
 Finding the lube in Jason’s nightstand drawer, David slowly began inserting his finger into Jason. Jason silently nodded his approval as David inserted a second and then a third finger. Jason, writhing in pleasure, begged David to fuck him. David got between Jason’s legs and leaned in to kiss him as he pushed his twelve inch dick slowly into Jason’s tight ass. Once acclimated, Jason gave the nod that let David know he could take it. The sex was epic. Jason came twice with out touching himself and David flooded him with what felt like a gallon of cum. Content, David fell asleep while Jason gently stroked his firm chest. <br />
<br />
With David quietly sleeping, Jason gently climbed out of the bed and snuck out of the room pulling the door to. Jason sat at his desk and took the book from where he hid after the gym, in the back of the bottom drawer. Though he had the best date of his life and the best sex, Jason had been thinking of the book all evening. Opening the book, he wrote in the margin that David Kim, who was sleeping in the next room, would grow one inch in height, gain 15 pounds of muscle and gain 1/2 inch in penis length every month until he was the tallest, most muscular and most hung man in their gym.  Of himself, Jason wrote that he would had a tight muscular ass that would accommodate and please David no matter how big his penis became.</p>
