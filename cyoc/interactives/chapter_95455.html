<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;&#39;Im not sure really&#39;&#39; joey said cupping his breasts again, he wandered over to the bathroom and stared at his reflection in the mirror.<br />
&#39;&#39;I wish kelli and sarah could see what i see&#39;&#39; i looked in the mirror as a i felt something tingle inside me &#39;&#39;Hey! i can see&#39;&#39; i could hear sarah shout in my head &#39;&#39;Me too!&#39;&#39; kelli sounded overjoyed by that.<br />
&#39;&#39;This is...you gotta change us back Joey, please ? im sorry for what i did all i wanted was to have some fun...i was going to turn you back i promise!&#39;&#39; Sarah pleaded to me.<br />
&#39;&#39;Seriously ? What about me ?! im innocent in this, you gotta turn me back joey!&#39;&#39; joey pondered a bit &#39;&#39;fine but we are going to change a few things here, i wish that kelli and sarah was back to normal&#39;&#39;<br />
A gentle glow emerged out from my breasts as sarah and kelli appeared infront of me &#39;&#39;Thank you&#39;&#39; sarah looked at me annoyedly. &#39;&#39;Dont be angry, you liked it, i could tell&#39;&#39;<br />
sarah shook her head and held out her hand &#39;&#39;give me the ring, you owe me&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;i owe you ? are you serious ?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Yeah! i am!&#39;&#39; she smacked my hand, i could feel the ring slowly rolling of my finger as i heard a small hud at it hit the floor.<br />
we all quickly started looking for it as i heard sarah giggling, i looked over at her to see her slowly putting the golden ring on her finger &#39;&#39;You lose joey but dont worry, i wont do anything mean&#39;&#39; <br />
i felt my heart racing as i lunged towards her and pinned her to the floor &#39;&#39;H-Hey! what are you doing !?!&#39;&#39;  &#39;&#39;Give it back! its mine!&#39;&#39;  &#39;&#39;Its not!&#39;&#39; i held around her and pulled the ring of her finger rather easily and quickly put it back on my finger.<br />
&#39;&#39;You Bitch...&#39;&#39; i got of sarah and looked at her &#39;&#39;C-Can we all just calm down ?! damn it...&#39;&#39; kelli looked at us both and i sighed deeply &#39;&#39;I&#39;m sorry Sarah...&#39;&#39; i lended her a hand and helped her up &#39;&#39;its...fine i guess...&#39;&#39;<br />
&#39;&#39;Look, you two are going crazy!&#39;&#39; i sighed and nodded slowly &#39;&#39;yeah...it is&#39;&#39; sarah nodded aswell. <br />
&#39;&#39;lets use the ring one time each okay ? get it all over with then get rid of it&#39;&#39; i looked at kelli, i didnt really want to lose the ring but what she said made sense, just seeing everything that happened today.<br />
we all agreed to it and sat down on the sofa and put the ring on the table.<br />
&#39;&#39;Who goes first ?&#39;&#39; kelli looked at us, we all shrugged and just decided to do rock-paper-scissor, Kelli won then i so Sarah was last.<br />
&#39;&#39;So im first then, okay...I wish that...i was rich and would never have to worry about money again!&#39;&#39; the ring glowed and the wish was granted.<br />
second up was me &#39;&#39;Okay so my turn....i wish that i...&#39;&#39; i grinned to myself&#39;&#39; I wish i would become a...black woman, Sarah would become my bra and you kelli would become my girlfriend!&#39;&#39;<br />
Sarah looked at me furiously and tried snatching the ring of the table but her arm slowly fades away from her body, &#39;&#39;No..please, Dont ple-...&#39;&#39; her voice faded away. i looked at sarah as she shrunk into herself, slowly turning into a black laced bra.<br />
I then felt something tingling happening to me, i could feel my hair growing longer and turning brown, my skin slowly changed from my pale white to a brown color, my breasts turned a cup size higher turning into a pair of nice D-cups i could also feel my hips turning a bit bigger aswell as my butt.<br />
i let out a sensual moan and stroked my breasts and hooked my new bra on me, it fit perfectly as i gently cupped it and fit it in place. <br />
&#39;&#39;You Backstabbing bitch! i hate you!&#39;&#39; i sat down on the sofa again next to kelly who snuggled into to me &#39;&#39;oh ? i didnt think you could talk Sarah, im sorry let me fix that&#39;&#39; N-no!&#39;&#39; i picked up the ring from the table and slid it gently on my finger.<br />
&#39;&#39;I wish sarah would stop lying and just admit she loved being my bra&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;you look so amazing cutie&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;i do ? you are so adorable kelli!&#39;&#39; we gently kissed each other.<br />
I then decided to go on in life as a woman, and it was the best choice i had ever made<br />
<br />
Three months have since passed, i decided to split the ring into two, giving one piece to Kelli aswell. <br />
<br />
Kelli looks at me as i walk over to her seducingly, i push her down onto the bed and lies down ontop of her &#39;&#39;It is happening ? i cant wait!&#39;&#39; sarah is talking in my head again....i decided to turn her into my breasts aswell after she begged, she felt so alone when i took her off so i felt i could atleast do that for her.<br />
&#39;&#39;Shhh...im trying here sarah dear&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Awwww, You are such a tease Rachel, but i cant help but love you&#39;&#39; even though Kelli is my girlfriend...or rather wife now, me and sarah...developed a very special bond togheter becoming something of a couple aswell.<br />
&#39;&#39;So is my wife ready ?&#39;&#39; i nod in happiness as she starts stroking my breasts with her hand and my womanhood with her other, every single touch sends ripples of pleasure trough my body.<br />
&#39;&#39;Kelli is so amazing! she knows just what to make us feel amazing! right dear ? i tried speaking to her back but all that came out was moaning.<br />
&#39;&#39;You are so adorable Rachel dear&#39;&#39; she kisses my lips and kept stroking me.<br />
i felt this amazing familiar feeling as i could feel something leaking i let out a huge moan and looked at kelli &#39;&#39;Good girl! i am so proud of you, Want to go a bit more ? &#39;&#39;i shook my head &#39;&#39;let me take a shower then come back okay ?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;without me ?&#39; she smiled. &#39;&#39;Sorry sweetie! i would but you took a shower before&#39;&#39; she nods and blows me a kiss as i walk to the bathroom.<br />
as i walk to the shower i stop to look at my reflection in the mirror &#39;&#39;Looking cute as usuall aren&#39;t we Rachel ? &#39;&#39;we are&#39;&#39; i said proudly as i gently stroked my hand over my breasts, i walked into the shower and turned on the water.<br />
<br />
1 year later<br />
<br />
Kelli and are married!<br />
<br />
i&#39;m lying in the bed looking up at the celling, kelli is gone for the day since she is visiting her parents. its been a couple of weeks since the marriage.<br />
&#39;&#39;Hey...Rachel ?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Yes sarah ?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;i know you are married to kelli and you&#39;re her wife now but...we still&#39;&#39; i sit up in the bed &#39;&#39;Sarah, dont...dont finish that sentence, i know i am now kelli&#39;s wife and im happy being her wife but we have something special togheter, i love you and need you sarah.&#39;&#39;<br />
&#39;&#39;Yeah...rachel...love you&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Love you sarah&#39;&#39; i smile and gently stroke my breasts, i can feel sarah is liking it alot.<br />
i Drift into sleep and is awoken the next morning by someone snuggling into me, i open my eyes and spot kelli looking me into my eyes and kisses my lips lovingly &#39;&#39;Hey dear, missed me ?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Yeah, love you&#39;&#39; i smile and kiss her back.<br />
A couple of hours later after having some private time togheter kelli helps me out of the bed and holds around me, she strokes my back and kiss my lips again, i press my lips against her and kiss her back. <br />
Life is great really...i still have the ring i think ? its in some jewellry box somewhere, i dont really care that much about anymore, i got what i wanted and im happy being a woman and a wife. it was never really any question if wanted to turn back...i was happy from day 1 as a woman, i knew that, kelli knew that and Sarah knew that, and i&#39;ll be happy til the day i die.</p>
