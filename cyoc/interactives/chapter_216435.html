<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I kinda like the whole &#39;sexy green gals from space&#39; look so I reverted her back to it. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey Rick, can you access more of that camera&#39;s dev tools?&quot; Emily asked as her hands gripped the strange cube controls. She&#39;d been practicing a bit over the last hour and was starting to get a hold of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe? It&#39;s hard to describe. Like looking at a hall of doors and finding out which one is locked. Maybe with time I get can get into them but...&quot; Came Rick&#39;s voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...., do you have secruity cameras though? Like records?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Gimme a sec..., yeah I think I can pull up play back. Wow that feels really weird though, like rewinding my mind. What&#39;s up?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pull up an image of how I first looked like and save it. I want to try something, and pull it up onto a montair.&quot; she commanded, trying not to put that much authority into it. <br />
<br />
A &#39;humming&#39; like noise came over the intercom as Rick worked. Soon a picture was on the screen in front of her, which showed her walking through the hallway of the ship. Clad in that skin tight outfit and being that green shapely milf alien. Emily gave a nod. <br />
<br />
&quot;So as interesting as this whole.... form is, I kinda don&#39;t want to get to the point I can&#39;t ... undo it. So what I want to try  and do is make a &#39;default&#39; state. And the last form wasn&#39;t so bad.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose that makes sense. Last thing we want is you to turn into like a goo creature and you can&#39;t push the button or something.&quot; Rick replied a bit of worry in his digital voice. <br />
<br />
It would really suck to get stuck as a ship floating through space if he couldn&#39;t use the camera, but then again, just finding a new &#39;captain&#39; should fix that... but that would still leave Emily spinning in the wind.... or shoved out an air lock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I suppose can&#39;t keep this off any longer. Status Aware; Twinning mode Version Three. Take a shot of me in the recording and then take a shot of me now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rick did as he was asked with the machines inside his &#39;body&#39; whirling to life and Emily authorizing it with the push of a button. A bright flash coated the entire room and as vision came back to her, she saw her hand was once more green with the finger nails. Calling up the mirror from before, Emily admired her green skin and shapely hips. Ideas started to run through her head as she ran a hand through her long hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rick if you can change or edit any of those settings, start working on the twin one. I have a bit of an idea I want to try but first... is there a bath room?&quot; <br />
<br />
Lucky for her, the bathroom looked close enough to &#39;human&#39; to not pose a problem nor did her new &#39;plumbing&#39; seem to be that different. A cutting tool was found similar to scissors and her hair was trimmed down to just above her shoulders. It made her ends look a bit jagged but it felt better than the whole mop of hair she previously had. The ship had a &#39;bio recycler&#39; so the hair was tossed in there to be processed into reusable material. Emily tried not to think too much about possibly eating something made out of her &#39;hair&#39;. <br />
<br />
&quot;How much of you is Automated Rick?&quot; She asked as she walked through the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Most of it, all of it? It&#39;s odd. Like when you have a muscle spasm or your blood pumps hard after a jog. You can feel it, and you know your body is doing it. It&#39;s just as a &#39;ship&#39; now or AI in control of it, I can shift my focus to that system and take full control of it.&quot; Rick explained, his voice echoing from the speakers. <br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose that makes sense...., whelp, I&#39;m gonna check the ship out some more to see what we&#39;re working with. You keep trying to crack into some of those dev settings.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You got it but uh..., can ... we agree to something?&quot; the voice sounding a little shakey. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I still feel kinda...., womanly even as this ship... very weird feeling. Can we go with... Ricki for now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Works for me honestly Ricki.&quot; Emily said with a smile as she started down the hallway, with a small breath of reflief sounding from the ship.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Ricki&#39;s ship body was rather large, probably the size of a private yacht. It had a master bedroom, a few smaller bedrooms for one person each, and even a small kitchen. No dining room though; meals were to be eaten in the kitchen or the rec/break/living room.<br />
<br />
Besides the rooms for living there were a few other rooms of note. What looked to be a small armory about the size of a walk in closet, mostly empty with a few laser weapons and a couple non lethal stun weapons. Engine room was combined with an engineering bay reminding her of perhaps a sci-fi garage only with far more white plastic than chrome and way more curves than hard angles.<br />
<br />
 Nearby was what seemed to be a med bay, about the size of a doctor&#39;s office, with a few tubes tossed in to hold human sized creatures. Adjenct to that was a small research and or chem lab; it was hard to tell. Perhaps someone could tell her what it did once recruited. Well, that kinda depended on how the camera worked. <br />
<br />
Finally, within a small walk from the lab area there were about a dozen small cell like rooms complete with one way viewing windows. Small bed, small bathroom, small table that slid out from the wall and a chair; Just the perfect spot to keep prisoners and test subjects. <br />
<br />
All and all, the ship had the feel of as personal mad science vessel mixed with a scout ship. Like she was here from some distant empire to do tests and research while keeping things slimmed down to the minimum. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think I got a decent grasp of the ship.&quot; Emily said as she leaned back in the pilot&#39;s chair sipping from some tangy drink she got out from the kitchen, &quot;Enough so I don&#39;t blow it up at least.&quot; She paused as she threw empty bottle into a reclaiming shoot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Make any progress?&quot; she asked as she turned to a floating screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little.&quot; came the reply, Ricki&#39;s voice sounding a bit softer now, &quot;The problem is I don&#39;t have enough data to work with. Maybe after some tests and &#39;fun&#39; I can figure something out but... don&#39;t expect too much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess it&#39;s time to go to work then. Besides, we can probably hit two birds with one stone.&quot; Emily gave a stretch before putting her hands on controls.<br />
<br />
“Whatta you mean ‘cap’n’” Ricki asked as the engine warmed up. It was a weird feeling, like throwing on a couple heated blankets onto what would have been ‘legs’ on a normal human body. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s simple, we abduct people to test the camera on while at the same time trying to find people to crew the ship. Who knows, maybe we can get them to know more about how this all works than me if we don&#39;t use the &#39;aware&#39; settings. It&#39;s all about where to start first.&quot;  Emily explained.</p>
