<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Aiden is an inflatable rubber incubus now but doesn&#39;t have any special powers, just an easy to pleasure rubber body that is made to never age or break. While Geoff owns him completely, Aiden still has control of his mind and being. Geoff can order his body to do something or shut up but he can&#39;t overwrite Aiden&#39;s mind. Arn&#39;t living sex toys the best sex toys though? And what&#39;s the fun if they don&#39;t struggle a bit? The next chapter should be very... Interesting...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiden suddenly snapped to as he heard the sound of keys turning in the lock of the door. The rustling of the knob put a fear into him that made him stop moving and posing in the mirror with a sudden short tight rubbery creak. -No! Geoffs home already!? Shit, I got to get out of here now!- He thought to himself before turning quickly to face toward the window, his body squelching with his sudden movements as he spun around. Before Aiden could take his second step and sprint to freedom the door flung open as Geoff walked into the room and staired up at the latex rubber incubus squeaking about in his room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aiden!?! How the hell...&quot; Geoff stated loudly as Aiden started to sprint toward the closed window with the unplugged Chronivac in hand. Aiden took two more rapid sprinting steps making his body squelch loudly before before Geoff screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aiden stop!&quot; Aiden instantly froze solid in mid stride, causing himself to trip and faceplant into the closed window with a balloony &quot;bompf&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! what the, my legs won&#39;t move, what. Geoff! Leave me alone!&quot; Aiden squeaked sharply at Geoff as he turned around and sat in the corner next to the wall, trying to get away from Geoff. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aiden... I don&#39;t know how you turned yourself into whatever it is you are or got off my bed. But you just cost me BIG TIME. Chronivac. NOW!&quot; Geoff Commanded furiously at Aiden.<br />
<br />
Aiden once again felt a strong compulsion to obey and as if against his will picked up the Chronivac and presented it to Geoff. Geoff stormed over to Aiden and snatched the machine out of his rubbery claws and went over to the computer to hook it back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m changing you back right now. You were promised to the rugby team for spring break as payment for the Chronivac. When your done there, you&#39;ll be lucky if I ever inflate you agai-.&quot; Geoff stopped in the middle of his fussing to see that Aiden&#39;s profile was locked and his transform history was deleted. There was no way for Geoff to change him back now. Geoff turned his head to glare at Aiden who was grinning with his rubbery demonic face. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Geoff, but I can&#39;t let you change me back. Since you made me inflatable permanently, I made myself a body I would enjoy. I&#39;m an inflatable rubber incubus now, and theres nothing you can do about it!&quot; Aiden squeaked at Geoff. He knew there was nothing Geoff could do about his state now, the moment the Chronivac was unplugged it deleted Aiden&#39;s transformation history, removing the ability to hit UNDO and since he had locked any further body transformations, he was now an inflatable demon forever. <br />
<br />
Aiden tried to get up from his spot but couldn&#39;t get his body to move. Aiden struggled as Geoff constantly tried to un-brick Aiden&#39;s profile to no avail before tossing his keyboard to the side and walking over to Aiden and grabbed his squeaky rubbery body by the throat and lifted him up. Aiden struggled before Geoff threw him onto the bed. Aiden bounced once onto the headboard before flopping back onto the bed, his big rubbery wings catching him on his fall. Geoff was storming over to him. Aiden was scared now, he had never seen Geoff this mad before. Aiden couldn&#39;t make his body get away from him, he constantly ordered his rubbery legs to get him away his wings to fly him away his arms to crawl him away but he wouldn&#39;t move to get away from Geoff. Geoff was at the bed now and grabbed Aiden and flipped him over. Aiden instantly knew what he was going to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geoff! Stop! Please! Why won&#39;t you leave me alone!&quot; Aiden squeaked at him as Geoff held him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Aiden... I own you. You may have turned yourself into a nice squeaky demon and gave yourself the ability to move and squeak. But you are mine.&quot; Geoff said with a commanding voice climbing on top of Aiden. Geoff then sat on top of Aiden&#39;s lower back making his rubbery body squeak faintly. Aiden was instantly filled with extreme pleasure as Geoff;s weight squished his balloon of a body making him let out a squelchy rubbery moan. Aiden;s body went stiff, his limbs extended straight outwards and his wings fully extended over the bed. Aiden then felt a sudden explosion of pleasure as Geoff grabbed Aiden by his left ankle and with his other hand by his horn and stretched him to look at the bottom his own foot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now tell me Aiden, what does that say?&quot; Geoff stated sternly to Aiden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah- Ah, A... Geoff?&quot; Aiden squeaked worriedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, Aiden.&quot; Geoff said maliciously before leaning forward into Aiden&#39;s right elvish ear. &quot;You... are... a... TOY!!!&quot; Geoff screamed as he let go of Aiden&#39;s horn and ankle, making Aidens leg and Face slap back onto the bed with a sudden sharp squeak. &quot;And you made yourself a demon in appearance only, that&#39;s where your wrong Aiden... Demon&#39;s have true names and I am your master. You are my toy. You exist solely for my pleasure. and now you have displeased me. Because A squeaky rubber demon toy is not what the team ordered.&quot; Geoff continued. <br />
<br />
Geoff then ordered Aiden to look at him. Aiden obeyed. His solid black rubber eyes showed little emotion on his pearl white rubber face. Aiden could feel Geoff was sprouting an erection sitting on top of him. Aiden was clearly getting hornier by the minute with the pressure of his body squished under Geoff. Geoff grinned and looked deep into Aiden&#39;s rubber eyes. &quot;Now... Since i&#39;m feeling merciful, I won&#39;t destroy you or melt you down or anything like that. Your far to valuable of a toy...&quot; Geoff then took one hand and reached behind him, and fondled Aiden&#39;s air valve. Aiden moaned with a squelchy rubbery cry. His valve was more sensitive than his dick which was starting to inflate inside of his tight rubber briefs. He didn&#39;t want to be deflated just after he had regained his freedom but the thought of a full body deflation being on the horizon was driving him insane with lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geoff... please... don&#39;t...&quot; Aiden whimpered.<br />
&quot;Now, now, Aiden. If you don&#39;t want to be deflated and stuffed in my dirty underwear drawer for the next two weeks you need to make up for your mistake... You can start by showing me exactly... why... you became an incubus of all things...&quot; Geoff then took his hand off of Aiden&#39;s valve and stroked down his backside before molesting Aiden&#39;s posterior. &quot;I do like what you did... So why don&#39;t you show me just how good your new body is in bed... Maybe if you do a good job, your master will reward you and forget about your attempt to escape.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden was scared about what Geoff was going to do to him, but was getting more and move overwhelmed by his arousal and was indeed truly enjoying what was happening. When he set his sliders to max he didn&#39;t think it was going to be anything like this level of sensation. It was like something had truly awakened in him and he was a whole different person. Geoff was taking two fingers and reaching into Aiden&#39;s ass crack and starting to pull of Aiden&#39;s shorts, revealing his tight white rubber ass. Aiden was compelled to pleasure Geoff in any way he can. As Geoff pulled down his underwear until it wouldn&#39;t pull down any further at his leg bands where he had fused it too him. Geoff took his other hand propped Aiden&#39;s weightless body up against Geoff&#39;s member. Geoff took his hand he had on Aiden&#39;s ass and slid it around his side, grabbing Aiden&#39;s Glossy rubber member. Aiden was going to be in for one hell of a night, and with a sudden loud toy squeak, felt extreme joy as Geoff plunged his member into Aiden&#39;s tight rubber ass, and began to fuck him senseless.</p>
