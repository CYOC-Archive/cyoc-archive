<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samy had returned to the zoo, kinda glad her boss was out of the country, for she&#39;d had entrusted Sammy to take care of things from day to day when she was gone. She would flip had she known what was happening, so Sammy, out of the smartness of her gut closed the zoo for the day.  She knew that it was a smart choice. She started to put pieces of the puzzle together. &quot;After Fee City, it was Paris, Sidney, and now Cairo. Interesting choices. But what is your goal?&quot; She asked as if someone were listening.  If I were the mastermind behind this, the next cities would be big ones with lots of population.&quot; She walked back and forth. &quot;New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Moscow, Beijeng, Bombay, Buenos Aires, Rio de Jenero, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Seattle, London, Madrid, Rome, Berlin.&quot; She looked. &quot;All these are mass populated areas, New York is even connected to more, and China has billions of people. If the Virus was leaked in those two places getting a vaccine would be near impossible.&quot; She thought. &quot;Well, I can warn my Uncle in Washington. He would be able to get the coastal cities in the US prepared.&quot; She grabbed her cell and dialed. It rang and picked up. &quot;Uncle Renald?&quot; She waited for him to answer. &quot;Listen. I know you&#39;re the Sec Def there in the US, I need to warn you. The terrorist behind the outbreaks, he&#39;s targeting major cities.&quot; She said. &quot;And New York, it&#39;s connected to several cities along the eastern seaboard. I would recomend preparing people, give them the new Vaccine that was made in Paris.&quot; She waited until he spoke. &quot;If you need more, the one that did it is in a place called Janice, Colorado, hir name is Jess. I know it sounds crazy, but shi&#39;s got the vaccines. Shi&#39;s the one who helped stop the outbreaks in Fee City and Paris.&quot; After that she hung up and went about doing her chores while continuing her investigation, hoping that he would do what needs done.<br />
<br />
When she was done she turned and next thing she saw was a hand come and make contact with her forehead, sending her onto her back knocking her onconscious.<br />
<br />
When she came too, she must&#39;ve been out for a day or two but she was staring at a chinese fellow. He was short, about six foot, had a long beard and dark eyes. He glared right at her as if to see through her. &quot;I see you&#39;re awake. Good, good. You&#39;ll see what I&#39;m about to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you, what do you want with me?&quot; She wanted to say but it came out muffled and gagged so nothing got out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just relax, you&#39;re not going anywhere. You see, I&#39;ve been making multitudes of... what are your friends calling this new species, ah yes, kats. Well, this one is older than the rest, and you&#39;ll be the very first in a long time.&quot; He held up a bone. &quot;See, this is the bone of a dragon. And no, not the mythical, magical ones. Though it looks like them. This, my dear child, is of those we hunted. The mythical ones are ones that were passed down. This one couldn&#39;t fly, couldn&#39;t breath fire. It was treated like deer, or wolves, ment to be hunted. And through you, you will spread and recreate an ancient species that existed thousands of years ago. You see, I coated this bone with the virus that way it&#39;ll change you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked wondering how, then he took, and cut her leg open, smashing the leg out, and graphing this one in. He then looked at her. &quot;Good night my dear. Oh, and enjoy Hong Kong, it&#39;s a lovely city.&quot; She reached and hit him on the head, glaring as she was going to get him back, but soon she had passed out from the loss of blood.<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
When she finally came too, she was in the hospital, looking up. She hadn&#39;t changed yet, and the doctors had sewn up her leg. She looked and an inspector with the police was there. &quot;Miss, I&#39;m Chief Inspector Ki.&quot; She said. &quot;I need a full description of what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy looked at her. &quot;I need to contact General Heroud with the French army. The man behind the outbreaks...&quot; She started to speak fast. &quot;You need to quarantine this hospital, this room, now. I&#39;m going to end up infecting this whole island.&quot;<br />
<br />
The inspector looked at her. &quot;Hun, it&#39;s okay, you may be frightened. But you&#39;re safe.&quot; She looked at her then froze. &quot;Sammy?&quot; She looked at her frightened eyes. &quot;It&#39;s me, Gloria. We were college room mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gl... Gloria?&quot; She hugged her long time friend. &quot;Look, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened. I was working the zoo, trying to get things straitened, but then, it was after the outbreak in Sydney. I got jumped and then next thing I knew I was on a plane, this guy, cut a bone out of my leg and put another in it&#39;s place, then I passed out again and I&#39;m here.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got a description?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Sammy gave the description as she looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, hun, you found a man wanted in just about every country.&quot; She said softly. &quot;If there&#39;s a law out there, he&#39;s broken it. Only one he hasn&#39;t broken is the Law of Gravity. But given the chance, he&#39;ll figure that too.&quot; She looked over, and went to tell one of the officers who did it to her, then had one of the others contact General Heroud in Paris to get here. The man was a class rate terrorist who&#39;d make Saddam seem like a innocent little school girl.<br />
<br />
Sammy looked and grabbed a phone and called her sister to tell her where she was. Mikkie decided she&#39;d come to her, Alexis and Flake would go to Cairo to help there if they could, while Danna accompanied Mikkie. Gloria thought she&#39;d stay and make sure that Sammy handled alright. A nurse came in to change Sammy&#39;s bandages. While Gloria kept Sammy company.<br />
<br />
Sammy looked and breifed her friend on everything that she&#39;s known to have happened just as whiskers, like the chinese dragons in the lore had. Gloria noticed and moved closer to comfort her. &quot;Shit. Sammy, this is different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think that&#39;s bad, my wound don&#39;t hurt no more. But I&#39;m getting lots of intense pains along my back. Just help me onto the floor, and you&#39;ll see.&quot; She looked as Gloria did so, and Sammy stripped, Gloria noticing this, locked the door and had an officer to keep all out, closing the blinds. Sammy began growing a long tail, it covered in crimson red feather like fur, her legs and arms getting the same treatment, as her body lengthened, she let out a loud roar, her face having started change, as horns grew. Just then her back was a good length, and her front legs grew in, completing the taur like appearance. She dropped down and started to cry. The last thing to change was her growing a sheath containing a cock. Shi looked over at Gloria. &quot;Now look at me. I&#39;m a freak.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
Gloria looked walking over and wrapped a hand around her friend. &quot;No, hun. Come. Look, you&#39;re absolutely stunning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy looked at hir reflection. Gloria was right. Shi did look absolutely beautiful. Perhaps this wasn&#39;t bad. But one thing that was is what was building up. Shi looked at Gloria and grabbed her shoulders. Hir mind was now lost in the lust as shi ripped Gloria&#39;s clothing off, putting a hand to her mouth. Gloria tried to scream but couldn&#39;t due to what was happening, Sammy had forced her new cock right into Gloria&#39;s mouth, and proceeded to rape hir friend. When done Gloria began her own change, becoming a navy blue dragon much like her friend. The two then continued out the door. In hours the whole hospital was becoming Dracokats. If Sammy had been hirself shi&#39;d notice what the asswhole ment, the real dragons that roamed this land resembled deer in a lot of ways and also rams, there were a variety. Shi wasn&#39;t in no way a magical creature like the stories said, but shi was infact a normal creature who resembled the dragons of myth. Shi and Gloria were now lustfilled. Sadly the outbreak had hit the streets of Hong Kong and poured right out into the city. Sammy and Gloria returned to hir hospital room and continued their sex there.</p>
