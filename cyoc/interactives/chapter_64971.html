<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Derrick realized what he could do with the Chronivac a thought went through his head.<br />
<br />
He didn't have to be fat any more.<br />
<br />
As he moved the mouse over the weight section he moved it down to 140 pounds.<br />
<br />
That little Bi notation blinked at him as he moved the mouse over it and he sat for what seemed like an <br />
eternity when he changed it to 100% gay. And masculine butch.<br />
<br />
As he hit the submit button and went to sit on the sofa again he felt the changes happen. Within minutes there <br />
was a tingling going through his body like a thousand ants crawling all over him. But not just the outside his <br />
brain seemed to have some changes going on and they didn't seem to be all that unpleasant. It was almost as if <br />
the emitter was stimulating all the pleasure centers of his brain.<br />
<br />
When he stood up he looked at himself. He looked hot he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Slipping on a leather harness and some leather laced shorts and some boots that went up 3/4 of the way up his <br />
calf Derrick headed out to a bar. Although he hadn't made a change in his reality he felt as though he had <br />
been to this leather bear bar before. And as he walked in he saw so many big men. Bigger than he had been of <br />
every description. Furry, Smooth, Lethered, Jeans, and they were being fawned over by other big men and twinks <br />
like himself.<br />
<br />
Derrick ordered himself a beer and started a tour of the bar. Passing by a few bears he would casually reach <br />
out caressing the exposed chest hair and maybe a nipple or two and moving on.<br />
<br />
When he got one to follow him he would make out with them for a bit and move on to another conquest.<br />
<br />
Derrick had never had this kind of contact with others before. When he was bi women were disgusted by his <br />
weight and his amputation. And he had never explored men at that time so he was quite happy with his new form.<br />
<br />
Derrick tried to pick up another twink but things just didn't work for him. They were looking for big men and <br />
he just wasn't that any more.<br />
<br />
When he saw Tony, one of the twinks that he had been to art school with at the bar he had a wonderful idea. He <br />
was never interested in Derrick when they were in class. He didn't know if it was the way he looked or the <br />
amputation but he pulled out the scanner and took a scan of him and would take it home to check out the <br />
details later.<br />
<br />
Derrick enjoyed himself the rest of the night and went home with a smooth chubby man about the size he was <br />
before he made the changes. He was wearing a set of overalls with no shirt, his love handles and man boobs <br />
hanging out the sides.<br />
<br />
Derrick was ravenous. He took on that boy several times that night and even when he rolled over and went to <br />
sleep Derrick was still excited by his new predicament. He went to the computer and pulled up his scan of Tony <br />
and found out he was into really big men. 500 pounds or more. He didn't like the muscled chub look and it <br />
didn't matter if they were furry or not but he preferred sooth. It did show that he was turned off by <br />
amputations and Derrick figured that was probably why he wasn't interested in him before. Derrick got an idea <br />
and he was going to play with Tony for awhile.<br />
<br />
He scanned the chub laying on the bed and pulled up his profile. He decided he would see what else he could do <br />
with the Chronivac and decided he was going to try an inanimate alteration.<br />
<br />
First he changed him from smooth to furry. Changing his hair from black to dark brown. Although the weight was <br />
significantly decreased his size wasn't changed. He filled him with pillow stuffing. And then changed the him <br />
into a Teddy Bear. His torso was the same size but his legs pulled into him looking like stubs coming out from <br />
the big bear tummy. His arms turned into small arcs that rested on his tummy and his face turned into a snout. <br />
His ears moved to the top of his head and his eyes became button eyes. He left the consciousness to active so <br />
that he could see everything going on. He just couldn't participate.<br />
<br />
As Derrick hit submit he watched as his chub changed and soon was sitting in the over stuffed lounge chair in <br />
the corner looking at the bed he had been sleeping in just moments before. <br />
<br />
Derrick crawled into bed and decided he was going to start his plan with Tony in the morning.</p>
