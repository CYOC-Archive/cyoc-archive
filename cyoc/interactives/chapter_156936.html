<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eli hummed, thinking about Gary&#39;s conflicting question earlier as he began his daily chest presses at home. The thought weighed and gnawed on him as he contemplated, going past 200 reps in his completed sets before hitting failure and gasping deeply in his still enormous body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would going back to college really work out for me...?&quot; He mused, mulling over the opportunity that was presumably presenting itself so tenderly to him. The idea was quaint, with Ellenore&#39;s divorce finalized and his (in reality 24) many years of experience as a coach, it seemed plausible to return to college, score maybe a new opportunity and inspire the boys back home... But the more he thought of it, the more the question weighed heavier on his mind. The intense sexual prowess, the bulging, strapping muscles he was now presenting to all who were more than eager to worship his manly physique... The idea to return to college was perhaps the most responsible, maybe even critical decision to attain the things Eli had lost, but, why did he feel it wasn&#39;t the decision to truly maximize his potential? He had always told his students, particularly Gary these days, to stay focused on task and pursue the best possible choices in their lives to prevent another disaster like...<br />
<br />
Eli looked in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Himself.<br />
<br />
He thought himself a broken man, a man who lost his wife, yet in reality, he gained so much more, from the new beau&#39;s and the new baes, the constant DM&#39;s complimenting his sweaty muscles in the gym and the envying looks of the teachers, Eli realized in reality he didn&#39;t need the opportunity to go back to college, his time was over, poetically, and now was his time to rethink his life, to retool what was a boring and repetitive experience and renew his body and soul. Eli grabbed his 55 lb dumbbells and went back to his chest press, his force of will renewed as he counted upwards. <br />
<br />
341...342...343...<br />
________<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Gary...&quot; Eli spoke, gesturing over the behemoth of a student towards him in the weight room as he finally had dibs on the bench press. &quot;Been thinking about the question you gave me, man.&quot; Eli continued, as he loaded up the weights, catching himself as he realized how improper his language was to his own (growing) student. &quot;...I&#39;d like the opportunity to go back to class and really hit the books, y&#39;know?&quot; He spoke as he patted the bar to hint towards Gary spot him. Gary obliged, smiling as he had hoped for some more sage advice from his coach as he nodded. Eli grunted, lifting the impressive stack of almost 375 lbs overhead, as if it were only mere pillows. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly,&quot; Eli grunted, pushing the bar even higher than before. &quot;I thought it may be the best option but... I realized in a way, I don&#39;t mind taking what I got and pushing forward with it. You and the team are like the kids I never had, in a sense, I mean that, kid. But I realized too, a coach is a coach but it&#39;s the man...&quot; He grunted again, dropping the bar to a count of 21. &quot;...Underneath the whistle that makes the difference...&quot; He panted, chest heaving and spilling out of the generously cut tank top threatened to be eaten up by the 24 year old&#39;s burgeoning body. <br />
&quot;My time&#39;s up, and I trust you and the boys&#39; to make the right decisions before you turn out... regretting stuff you didn&#39;t realize would impact you later on.&quot; He paused, taking up a white towel to soak up the sweat off his brow and sipped a water bottle that laid next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... But coach, what if you had the chance to uh... Well, let&#39;s say besides college, then, what&#39;d you wanna do with yourself?&quot; <br />
<br />
Gary posed, almost innocently to his venting coach. Had it not been for the simple fact that he was the culprit of growing and de-aging his teacher, Gary would have never realized the complexity of &quot;growing up&quot; the way Eli had to. It was... Complicated, to say the least. Regrets? He just wanted to switch places with Coach and make things right for himself, he didn&#39;t realize the way this was turning out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh... y&#39;know, that&#39;s a good question, son... Think I&#39;m big enough for Mr. Olympia?&quot; <br />
<br />
Eli joked, flexing his massive bicep to the overlooking giant of a student, the coach was huge, of course, but compared to Gary&#39;s physique and looks, the two resembled a pair of muscle bound gods almost laughably. Gary nodded, seeing the glint in his teacher&#39;s eye and seeing where his interests were beginning to lie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah, coach.&quot; Eli smirked, pumping the muscles back and forth, and running a thickened hand through his overwhelming body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, guess ol&#39; Eli could take a swing at it... Yeah, I&#39;d say I&#39;d think about going into bodybuilding on the side, you know? Flex a few poses, wear those fancy posing straps with the number on it, win a few trophies...&quot; Eli mused, unaware of the fairy-ripped-father that was taking in every word with gusto. &quot;Beef up a bit, trim the beard and maintain a good cut...&quot; Details, details, so many things to work with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Olympia, age 40, heh I could believe that, you?&quot; Eli chuckled, it was almost insulting how unperceptive people affected by the Chronivac were, Gary had realized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, yeah... Nah, but thanks for that, Coach. Say, you&#39;d say you look like, 30, or something right?&quot; Gary prodded, just to test his curiosity as his heart pumped. Despite being the only two people there, Gary was glad that the Coach was far too involved with doing another set, grunting under heavier weight and could not see the mammoth like bulge in both of their shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya kidding? Kid, I&#39;m twice your age and then some!&quot; Eli laughed, the weight being taken off his mind in favor of the cheer up his student was obviously attempting to achieve. Sure, he was maybe a bit of the slippery kind, but he had to admit, talking like this to someone was pleasant, and Gary had been shaping up to a real swell &quot;young&quot; man despite his own restored vigor. But that didn&#39;t stop the massive gains he was going to have over the kid after he was done, Eli told himself, feeling the fire in his eye reignite. 40 year old coach with the looks of a late 20, 30 something and the body of a god... Eli admitted, the thought was everything to him, to change and to get bigger and better than he used to be, than what he hated about himself. It was all thanks to this... Miraculous season that had everyone different, had everyone shaping up too, maybe this was just his year.<br />
<br />
______<br />
<br />
Eli posed in front of his mirror, though tired of his hand, it was always his trusty companion, the younger jock that screamed in his bed earlier that night tongue worshipped him in every nook and cranny before screaming out &quot;Daddy!&quot; and rocking Eli&#39;s blooming non-heterosexuality to its core. He... When did he get so loose with himself, these days? The surging, flexed slabs of muscles threatened to grip his attention as he made a most muscular, his now trimmed beard was gorgeous, it was as if a superhero had changed into his civilian form, but the physique and handsome features remained. There were so many options laid out for him, change his hair, maybe even try a new beard style or haircut. Eli pumped his cock idly as he took off the shower towel and tossed it above the shower rack, he was getting far absorbed into his preening ritual to notice too many details, but subtly they lined up. Eyeing the lessened wrinkles, patting his freshened face with aftershave, and almost moaning and the sensational touch his rugged palm had given him, Eli was beaming as he realized the potential that he still had yet to express to the world... To all his adoring fans. <br />
<br />
He was surrounded by them, millions of men and women screaming for him as he walked to and fro on stage, the music pumping and the cheers for the newest, and by far largest, competitor for Mr. Olympia was there for all to see. Eli tensed his chest, posing a side chest that swooned the men up in front, before turning around and flexing his lats with such precision, all he could hear was the screams of his fans as they called for him and snapped pictures of him. Eli strutted with confidence and poise, he was every bit the god he was fashioning himself to be, aged 40 but with such good lucks, age was really just a number he would coin as his motto as he took the scene by storm, bringing both fame and even a new passion for life as he would take the nations by heart, and by cock if need be.<br />
<br />
Eli pumped his cock faster, feeling the high of his arousal as he imagined his glistening tanned skin in the camera light, the shutters and the many public eye licking every inch of him. He imagined the numerous photoshoots, the scandalous muscle worship videos, even a charity stripper night where he participated and went home to the highest bidder, and he&#39;d ravish them in bed until they howled his name like a true love god. Eli roared, his approval spraying everywhere on his body as his arm probed and groped his hairy, massive chest that bounced with glee. &quot;Oh... Fuck yes...&quot; Eli whimpered, feeling his cock spring hard again as he rolled the scene once more of an older, aged Eli working a thong off on the pole as he shook his hips to the beat no one could hear. He flexed, licking the curvaceous biceps and bounced his pecs up and down to his enjoyment as he cupped every bit of his rejuvenated body. To the victor... He thought, goes the spoils, licking his lips as he pulled out his phone to snap some new pics for his social media.<br />
<br />
______<br />
<br />
Gary fired another load as he felt himself up, he had his fun making everyone potentially bigger than anyone else in the entire state, even aged his coach down for proper measure, but the thought of being able to influence his entire team and coach was more than ever satisfying to a degree. Maybe he could even &quot;fix&quot; his other problems... But Eli had hit a bump on Gary&#39;s plans. So, Coach Eli Bramden wanted to go into bodybuilding, eh? He could certainly fix his dear old coach up, Gary thought, immediately going to Eli&#39;s profile and making the necessary adjustments to make his previous coach into a every middle aged gay man&#39;s dream: A bodybuilder with the body broader, more defined than anything they&#39;d see yet, and a new future that was brighter and hotter than what Eli could possibly imagine alone.<br />
<br />
Of course... There was still the matter of his initial mission of overtaking his teaching job, but the chance to see Eli strut his stuff on stage in a skimpy poser, and come nightfall he was on stage for a different crowd all to stroke his enlarging ego was enough to work Gary into a frenzy as he pumped out another for the night and the Chronivac for making his dreams come true... But what he didn&#39;t realize in his ecstasy of cumming and hitting, nearly smashing confirm thrice in horny impatience was the first being a misclick on &quot;randomize&quot;: Eli was now 30 once more on the interactive age changer. His weight? A solid 335 lbs at a steep 6&#39; 5&#39; feet height with features to match the soon to be heavyweight bodybuilding champ. The second misfire was on the option to &quot;Send&quot; the stats to the profiled subject, and the last, the stats being open to edits rather than having been set on &quot;view&quot; only or disabled. &quot;Fuck...!&quot; Gary moaned, eyes dizzy and felt sleep take him in the privacy of his room, shutting the computer and the Chronivac to take over while he went to finish his nightly rituals and prepare for bed, Eli&#39;s evolution was quickly going to become the height of his career... As well as the birth to many new changes to come...</p>
