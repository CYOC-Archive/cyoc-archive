<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ash being a furry fan changed his two sisters, with their boyfriends and turned them each into furry girls. of course having them being nude is when he thought of giving each of them some clothing while giving them each an order to do around the house, as his personal furry girls that he unfroze them while he started with his new furry sister Ashley, the cat. handing her some of her old clothing as he told her to quickly get dressed that Ashley did as she was told and put on her panties on first as it was followed be her pants, her white tang top t-shirt with a signature seven on it, her belt, and lastly, her fingerless rubber gloves over her grey fur as her hair was still white. <br />
<br />
once she was fully dressed is when he gave Ashley her orders and told her to basically act like a military cat girl while also being mostly on patrol around the house, meaning that she'll be watching over the house to make sure everything is ok and be on the look out for anyone who maybe a threat but Ash's parents. next came Aria's former boyfriend, Violet the bunny girl as he remembered his mom's sexy maid suit she used to wear for show that he told her put it on and be the house maid and start cleaning. once she too was dressed as Violet was in his mother's sexy maid uniform that she soon, without being told where to start first, started to clean the house. [this is what she would mostly look like.] <br />
<br />
as one of his sisters being a military guard cat girl while one was a bunny maid that he then focused on his next furry as his two furry girls had multiple tails, witch he liked most from them. he focused his attention on his other sister's former boyfriend, Dawn the two tailed wolf as he got her dressed and to her job that he whispered it in her canine ear. "I hope you like furry strip clubs, cause that's where you will be working at. you'll be earning money while being on the furry strip club job at night and are always eager to please the customers on your performance, but during the day, you'll be at a different club serving drinks on the beach. you'll be the hit on the beach as you'll be the sexiest furry they ever had on each of your jobs. you will return back home and hand over your money earnings each day as you will look like you were in heat while on the job, but not. the only day you'll have off is Saturday, but that is the day you'll be watching cartoons 24/7 as you'll be pole dancing during the day and pleasing yourself during the evening, unless I decide to have my way with you on the evening. do you understand your orders?" he said as she quickly nodded while the thought of herself pole dancing made her extremely Horny. <br />
<br />
once he was done telling his former sister's boyfriend about her orders that he patted her on her lap and gently spoke to her like any normal person would. "good girl. now then, off you go." he said as she got off the couch, but he soon spanked her butt cheeks a good one that it raised her hormones to there peaks. "have fun on your new job out there." he shouted as she waved a hand back to him before exiting the house for her first day on her new job.<br />
<br />
as he dealt with nearly most of his furry girls that the only one left to give orders to was his five tailed fox sister, Aria. as you gave Aria her change of clothing that it was more japan style, almost as if her clothing were changed with her through her changes as well. <br />
<br />
"normally I would save the best furry for last, but I have something very special in store for you. you're going to continue to be my sister, but as a fox priestess while granting most of the wishes everyone will make at your shrine. this shrine will be your home during the day as this will still be your home at night that the more wishes you make, like helping out an old lady of her day, helping a lost boy find his way home, or even just being there when someone just passed away, the more it makes you happy as there as some wishes in witch can't be made. for example, you can't kill or bring things back from the after life. and with that, I have one more thing to say to you before the four of you begin your new orders." he said as she was then curious on what he was going to say, but was soon stun by him kissing her as she was then into it. when they broke their kiss that he then finish what he was going to say. "you're also bashful and kind with every wish you grant to." just then, she was bashful, but very kind as they each now had their orders to fulfill.<br />
<br />
as Ash fulfilled his revenge on his sisters, with their boyfriends that he knew this was only the beginning of his new furry family. as each of them were doing as Ash told them to that witch story line do you now follow?<br />
<br />
