<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Rick smiled, knowing that he was about to have two things. His first pack mate and a gay companion of his own. As Brandon moved further and further into the dense cloud of the exploded cologne, Rick could already see thing begin to manifest in Brandon. Rick's lips furled, smiling because he knew it wouldn't be too much longer before Brandon was like he was. The first thing Rick saw was that Brandon looked much tighter in his once loose fitting clothes, confirming that his muscles had already bulked up.</Br>
<Br>Brandon, walking through the basement, found it harder to get where he wanted. He felt as though his clothes were constricting him somehow. Taking a moment to stop and smell the cologne around him, Brandon saw the cause of his slow movement and increasing discomfort. What Brandon saw shocked and amazed him, not knowing exactly when this first change even took place, especially without him really noticing that things were different. With awe, Brandon looked anywhere he could see and found that the muscle groups he could see were bigger... much bigger! His hands were rough and tough, his forearms tapered out from tiny things at his wrist, to six and a half inches in diameter up at his elbows. His biceps and triceps were huge, being twenty-two inches around, forming thick and billowy arms. His shoulders were nicely formed, looking as though they had been chiseled straight out of a chunk of marble. Through his tight shirt, he could see that his chest blossomed out forming large, yet soft "man pillows" which was something Brandon had always desired but could not get. His stomach was flat, not rippled, but not round either. His entire thighs and calves were twice as big, but muscle wise, as they were before inhaling that stuff. Enjoying the way he looked now, he felt his loins stir to life, causing even more tightness and uncomfortably in that region.</Br>
<Br>Brandon looked over to Rick with a look as if to ask <I>Would it be alright to take off my clothes now?</I> and Rick just nodded. With the approval of his newly found father, Brandon quickly disrobed, finding even that to be extremely difficult since they were pretty much plastered to his new body. As the cool, nice smelling, yet wet air kissed his naked skin, Brandon just stared down at his meat. Unbelievably, Brandon had gone from a meager five and a half inches long, a half an inch thick (or a pencil dick as he found it to be called) to seven inches long and as thick as a beer can. Tears of joy welled in his sockets, happier than he ever thought he would be, since he always figured there really wasn't anything that could be done to enhance that department. Suddenly, Brandon felt a slight bit of heat creep across his skin, while he could still feel the cooler air around him.</Br>
<Br>Brandon watched himself go from being completely hairless, where there normally was hair on the body, to being a bear in gay male standards, as he watched hair sprout from his feet all the way up to his face in a slow sweep, moving across his entire being like an ocean wave. Once he was sure the hair was done, he looked at his arms and smiled, loving the way the dark and thick pelt looked and felt. Rubbing his face, just to get a clue how that all changed so far, Brandon quickly pulled his hand away when he felt the thick brillo pad that he now sported over his entire face. Not only that, but when he felt his jawline, he found that it was sharper, more defined, not to mention older.</Br>
<Br>Again, Brandon looked over to Rick for somewhat of an answer or comment, yet he found none. Rick was too busy drooling over the hunk of a MAN Brandon just became, not to mention his cock spewing a thick string of pre, just like a slow running kitchen faucet. Brandon smiled when he saw Rick, but that was when he felt two things. First, Brandon wanted to taste not only the smooth velvety skin that Rick's cock was, but he also wanted a taste of the fluid that now avidly came from the faucet of a cock. The second was when Brandon licked his lips, his tongue came across something longer in two places and they were much sharper.</Br>
<Br>When Brandon did it again, he came to realize that his teeth had elongated and sharpened to become his new fangs. That was when things started up again for him. Brandon could feel his bones shifting, popping, lengthening and thickening to fit the new form he was taking. He could feel his ears slowly elongate to a point and as his skull changed, he could feel them migrate to the top of his head. He watched as his vision changed from being normal, to that of an animal as his snout pushed out, forcing his nose to flatten, then darken and become moist. As all of this was happening, Brandon could also feel his tongue widen from flattening out, just to match that of the partial animal Brandon was becoming. Then, the vertebrae in his entire spine thickened, while slightly causing a bulge to show off each individual bone and bump. Then his fingers and hands changed; thickening and puffing up; knuckles becoming slightly gnarled; fingernails lengthening while darkening and curling; thick skin blossoming from his palms to be the pads he might need to run on all fours; all while he was still able to keep his opposable thumb. Then Brandon watched as his feet did the same, his knees popped so that he could run in both human and wolf form, when he chose to do either. Next his cock lengthened and thickened slightly, his balls grew from the new golf ball size to his newer baseball sized balls. Thankfully, like Rick, his cock remained human in shape and appearance with no foreskin or a sheath as he thought werewolves had to of had. As the fur finished enveloping his entire body, a long and fluffy wolven tail sprouted from just above his butthole, waving happily behind him.</Br>
<Br>With the wolfish smile plastered across Rick's face, Rick approached Brandon. At first, Brandon just smiled back while staring dead into his forest green and amber yellow eyes, but when Rick was directly in front of him, Brandon enjoyed the new scent that he smelled. Brandon, just then, got his first full taste of the pheromones of attraction and he loved it. Brandon dropped to his knees, while leaning into Rick's crotch, getting another full whiff of that smell. With it driving him to sexual arousal and hunger, Brandon looked up to Rick with wanton eyes, wanting only to get that tasty cock in his maw and enjoy what Rick had to offer, especially since Brandon knew that he would even get his first taste of spooge!</Br></p>
