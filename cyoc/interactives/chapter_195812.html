<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Not right now.” Damian replies. “I know as a lion, you are able to keep on going, but I would like to talk to my family first. I like you a lot, I really do. But with Susan just becoming a Part Hybrid, it maybe too sone for them to have me change too.” <br />
<br />
“I understand. I don’t want to force you.” Jenifer replies.  “Besides, it wouldn’t be fun to have my first time be with my tired boyfriend.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks for understanding.” Damian replies. “What would your grandmother think?” <br />
<br />
“She would be fine.” Jenifer replies. “Hell, she is happy that I have friends, especially after my parents just up and left. She has told me before that she was surprised that I haven’t come home pregnant with a little cub of my own. I’m older now then my mother was when she and dad had me. And they weren’t even Hybrids, just two horny teens.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know.” Damian replies. <br />
<br />
“It’s all good,” Jenifer tells him. “I think you are the first person I’ve told, but it’s not like a secret or anything.” <br />
<br />
Jeff hears this and decides to go to his phone to make a change. He wants to see these to really go at it, just like the bull and cow he made two days prior. As he is about to select continue, the Thompson family SUV comes down the road. Susan and Draco had barely made it back to his father, but they didn’t have to say anything. Laura was playing and had fallen off some money bars. She ripped her pants and need a new pair. <br />
<br />
Jeff decides he wanted to wait and see what happens, but then he gets a text to come home from his parents. Jeff walks of disappointed that all he got to see was Jenifer give Damian head. <br />
<br />
As they are walking in, they find Jenifer trying to pick up her torn clothes as Damian was in the kitchen making sandwiches. “Oh, hello.” Jenifer says.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you must be Jenifer.” Mr. Thompson says. <br />
<br />
“Sorry for the mess.” Jenifer replies. “I had tried to dress nice for our date, but some stuff happened at the mall, and we came back here. I was frustrated and I flexed out of the small clothes. This is why we Hybrids don’t wear clothes.” <br />
<br />
Draco and Susan look at each other. They both realized that Jenifer doesn’t remember her human life, just her new Hybrid life. They both start thinking about how this could have happened. <br />
<br />
“It’s alright,” Mr. Thompson replies. “We had a little bit of a clothing issues ourselves.” He was caring his daughter, who was still crying over splitting her pants. <br />
<br />
“Aww.” Jenifer says before walking up to Laura. “You must be Laura. I heard a lot about you. Would you like me to carry you to your room to fine new pants?” Jenifer then looks back at the rest of the family. “Damian is making some food in the kitchen.” <br />
<br />
Laura shakes her head yes, reaching out to Jenifer. Jenifer picks up the seven-year-old and holds her close to her large breast. Laura lays her head down on Jenifer’s left breast, rubbing her head into them to make herself comfortable. Jenifer smiles before asking which room was hers. <br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s upstairs to the left, left hand side.” Mr. Thompson replies. Jenifer walks Laura up to the room as Damian walks back out of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you all are back.” Damian says, holding the two sandwiches.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Laura had an accident.” Susan replies. “She’s okay, Jenifer is taking her up to her room.” <br />
<br />
Mr. Thompson walks up to his son, “What is this about something happing at the mall?” Damian explains the situation about the jerk clerk and the police. Mr. Thompson nods his head. “Alright, as long as there is no surprise.” <br />
<br />
“Well, about that.” Damian says. Susan and Draco listen in closely. “Jenifer wants me to not just be her boyfriend, but also her mate. I wanted to bring it up to you and mom, especially after Susan’s surprise change.” <br />
<br />
“Well, we knew that could happen with Draco being a Hybrid, and you been dating one.” Mr. Thompson replies. “Invite Jenifer to stay for dinner, so the four of us can talk. What about Jenifer’s parents?” <br />
<br />
“She lives with her grandmother.” Damian replies before explaining that situation. <br />
<br />
“I see, so it’s just me and your mom stopping you.” His father says before turning to Draco and Susan. “Why don’t the two of you go to your room so we can talk. If you see Jenifer, as her to come down here please.” <br />
<br />
Draco and Susan comply. Walking upstairs, they see Jenifer walking out of Laura’s room. She walks over to talk to them, “Laura fell asleep on my breasts. She is in bed now.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Draco says. “My dad says he wants to talk to you and Damian downstairs.” <br />
<br />
“That’s doesn’t sound good.” Jenifer says before looking at Susan. “So how is being a Half hybrid?” <br />
<br />
“Hard, but I’m getting use to it. I get staired at a lot, until they see my tail.” Susan replies. <br />
<br />
“Yep, us big breasted hybrids get looked at a lot.” Jenifer replies. “Don’t worry too much about it. You have a strong wolf with you.” Jenifer smiles. “Oh, if you need any fur grooming tips, just let me know. I see it’s mainly your tail, but it is still important to clean it well.” <br />
<br />
“It’s only the tail.” Susan says, almost disappointed.  <br />
<br />
“I see, explains the pants. Do you take them off here?” Jenifer asks. <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Susan replies.<br />
<br />
“Good, get use to them off, and one day, it won’t matter what other people say or do.” Jenifer tells her with confidence. “Well talk to you later.” <br />
<br />
Jenifer walks downstairs as Draco and Susan walk into their room. The close the door to not seem like they are listening in, but they are also unable to hear the conversation. <br />
<br />
While in their room, Draco and Susan start talking about what they now believe what is going on after Susan takes off her pants and panties. <br />
<br />
“Apparently she changed while at the house.” Susan says. “It’s amazing that she didn’t have sex with him. I could swear I smelt it on her.” <br />
<br />
“I did too.” Draco agree, “She may have been giving him head when she changed. He is lucky she didn’t bite him down there.” <br />
<br />
“But she doesn’t seem to remember being human.” Susan replies. “How do you remember?” <br />
<br />
“It could be I was the first or one of the first.” Draco hypothesizes. “That could be why you are slowly remembering too, because my <br />
transformation was different than the others in some way.” <br />
<br />
Draco and Susan sit there quietly for a while, just thinking. After some time, Susan walks over to Draco. “Draco, I know it’s not the time, but can we have some ‘fun’ tonight?” <br />
<br />
“Maybe.” Draco says. “I can feel myself building up. This has been the longest I’ve been without doing anything since my transformation. I can feel my balls filling up.” <br />
<br />
Susan looks down and takes Draco’s balls in her hand. “I can tell.” She replies with a smile. Draco returns the favor by rubbing her slit with his pawed hand. <br />
<br />
The two start kissing until they hear a car park in the driveway. They stop and try to listen in downstairs. They still can’t make out words, but the conversation turns from dramatic to energetic quickly. Soon, Mr. Thompson knocks on their door. <br />
<br />
“Pizza is here.” He tells the two kids. “Also, if you ear noises from Damian’s room tonight, we have agreed to let him become a Half Hybrid or Enhanced. So, no messing with him or Jenifer. She is becoming part of the family just like Susan did.” <br />
<br />
The two kids nodded as they walked downstairs, dumbfounded, to eat dinner.</p>
