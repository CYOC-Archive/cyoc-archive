<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah and Lillian stepped out of the water giggling to one another both of them none the wiser as to what had happened to their mounts just moments ago. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know why it feels like we’re getting away with something? We’re allowed to be here,” Sarah laughed as she grabbed a towel from her bag and started to dry herself off. She had a lanky, yet muscled build. Not quite curvaceous enough for pop-culture’s idea of an amazonian woman, but perhaps identical to what those ancient women had looked like with her caramel colored skin and commanding features. She certainly rode a horse like a fantastical warrior as far as Lillian was concerned. <br />
<br />
“I think it’s the sense of freedom,” Lillian said as she wrapped herself in her own towel and pat Apache on his nose. The horse knickered happily and nuzzled into her hand. “It feels too good to possibly be allowed. Right Patch?” She cooed to the horse who let out a happy snort and pressed his large head into her side. <br />
<br />
“Hehe, I think he agrees,” Sarah laughed. Nugget came up behind her and pressed into Sarah’s back. Sarah rolled her eyes, “Yes yes, Nuggs. I know you’re hungry. I promised you carrots, and you don’t forget.” <br />
<br />
Nugget bobbed his head as if to say “you’re darn right!” <br />
<br />
Lillian giggled as Apache continued to nose at her playfully. “Someone’s playful.” She reached up and stroked his long nose. “We’ll have to do a few laps around the field to burn off that energy.” <br />
<br />
Apache didn’t seem to hear her as he slipped his dexterous lips around the hem of Lillian’s towel and whipped his head to the side. Lillian squealed in surprise as the towel gave way without much resistance and was flung off into the grass. <br />
<br />
Sarah exploded in laughter as Lillian was left stunned and stark naked by the horse. She was a shorter woman at barely over five feet tall with pale freckled skin and auburn hair. For some reason Sarah found it even more hilarious when Lillian reflexively clapped her arms over her modest bosom and nethers in embarrassment. <br />
<br />
“It’s not like you weren’t just naked and proud two minutes ago,” Sarah cackled, wiping tears from her eyes. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, but I wanted to be naked then!” She then turned to glare at Apache. “I swear I’d geld you again if I could Patch!” Apache just snorted apparently quite pleased with himself before pressing his nose affectionately between  Lillian’s cleavage. She pushed him away with a gentle, firm shove. “Pervert!” She grumbled at him before stomping over the grass. <br />
<br />
Sarah rolled her eyes and went to pick up her clothes. “Sometimes that boy acts more like a dog than a horse.” <br />
<br />
Lillian groaned. “Yeah, and here I am without a roll of newpapeeEEEEEREEEERRR!” As Lillian had bent over to get her towel she’d felt a long, muscular, and slimy tongue snake its way between her legs and lick her from groin to middle back in one might slurp!<br />
Sarah had spun around at Lillian’s squeal only to see her friend swatting at Apache her face blushing furiously. <br />
<br />
“You impish, perverted, bastard foal of a ten penny mule!” Lillian punctuating each curse with a swat at Apache’s nose. Sarah had never thought a horse could look smug before, but that twinkle in Apache’s big eyes was unmistakable. <br />
<br />
“What did he do?” Sarah asked as she picked her pants up off the ground. Lillian wasn’t being attacked, so she figured she could get dressed without issue. Lillian was doing her best impression of a stewed tomato as tried to form words other than sputters or more curses directed at Apache. <br />
<br />
“That bastard,” she made a very vague gesture at her rear, “licked me! Now don’t you start again!” Lillian said as Sarah covered her mouth to stifle the laughs, but it couldn’t be helped.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Sarah said, her resolve beginning to falter. “I guess…” She snorted. <br />
<br />
“WHAT?!”<br />
<br />
“I guess he found the salt-lick,” Sarah said before nearly bending in half cackling like a mad woman. Lillian’s towel being thrown at her face did nothing to make her stop. <br />
<br />
A few minutes and giggle fits later the girls were dressed and settled into their saddles. Lillian cheeks were still red, but she gave Apache a nice ear scratch. <br />
<br />
“You are lucky I love you, idiot,” Lillian said as the horse leaned into her scritches.  <br />
<br />
“He certainly loves you too.” <br />
<br />
“I will murder you in your sleep,” Lillian holding her finger up to Sarah. <br />
<br />
“But then who’d be your big spoon?” Sarah said as she got Nugget into a walk. <br />
<br />
“You…” Lillian faltered, “... are lucky I love you too!” She gave Apache’s sides a kick with her heels, probably a touch more firmly than necessary, but for a large meathead like him it was barely a tickle. <br />
<br />
They fell into step beside each other taking their time to get back to the stable. The moon had risen and the only hint of the sun was a beautiful band of violet and orange on the horizon. Cicadas had already started their rattling song. It was a sound you either loved or hated, and both girls found it peaceful if sometimes almost annoyingly loud. <br />
<br />
Lillian couldn’t help but squirm in her saddle as she kept thinking back to Apache’s impromptu tongue lashing. <br />
<br />
Stupid horse, Lillian thought. Thinking with his nonexistent balls. The up and down motion of Apache’s lazy trot kept rubbing her crotch into the leather. And why do I have to know he’d be better at that than any boyfriend I’ve ever had! <br />
<br />
Lillian bit her lip and gripped her legs tightly against Apache’s side as she felt her lower lips tingle. The animal’s tongue had felt so powerful, yet at the same time almost tender. It was a shame that a human tongue just wouldn’t be able to do what she knew Patch’s could from just one lick. <br />
<br />
She closed her eyes and tried to clear her head. Lillian had been a horse girl all her life, but she was not going to bow down to the perving on her horse stereotype. Her clit however seemed to have been awakened and felt needy as it started to throb along with her tingling vulva. <br />
<br />
Inside her jean shorts the skin of her nether lips started to swell. With each throb her clit pulsed just a tiny bit larger. Lillian pictured someone getting between her legs and dragging their tongue across her sex in slow methodical laps. Her pussy lips flushed at the imagined partner’s work. She started to grind into the saddle as her crotch grew moist. <br />
<br />
“I’m probably going to be working late tomorrow,” Sarah said, her voice piercing the haze. <br />
<br />
“Y-yeah?” Lillian murmured. Instantly the formless partner materialized into Sarah. She could see her girlfriend’s confident smirk clear as day as she looked up at her. Lillian’s clit held gently in her teeth. <br />
<br />
As if on command Lillian’s clit ballooned to the size of a grape inside her pants. As she bobbed along on the saddle she suddenly felt her breath hitch as the enlarged button was pressed into the seat. <br />
<br />
“Donovan’s asking me to be the driver on unit two,” Sarah continued oblivious to Lillian’s problems. “Just hope he doesn’t put me with Tommy. Guy’s a hell of an EMT, but he’s such a douchenozzle.” <br />
<br />
“U-uh huh,” Lillian answered half listening. It was taking a good deal of her concentration to keep a grip on Apache’s reins and not shove both her hands into her folds right there.<br />
<br />
She imagined Sarah letting go of her enlarged clit and going to work on the rest of her pussy. Everywhere Not-Sarah’s tongue danced across her skin was left thicker. The flesh darkened to a deep, rich brown as it grew leathery and smooth. Not-Sarah smiled at her fleshcrafting before letting her tongue loll from her mouth. Only to Lillian’s astonishment it wasn’t Sarah’s tongue but Apache’s that extended from her love’s mouth. <br />
<br />
Not-Sarah then dove into Lillian’s passage. She felt her insides yield to her phantom love’s tongue, her passage deepening and widening. The muscles spasmed in a way that made Lillian stifle a groan as they grew stronger and more dexterous. They gripped Not-Sarah&#39;s tongue hungrily while in the real world they sent a wave of feminine juices gushing from Lillian’s changing pussy. <br />
<br />
Lillian quivered on the saddle. Her mind assaulted from the sensations erupting from her groin. It was hard to stay in the moment. One second the real Sarah was talking about Tommy’s many failed relationships, and the next Not-Sarah was coring her out mercilessly with an equine tongue.<br />
<br />
Not-Sarah gained a wicked smile as she removed her horse tongue from Lillian’s passage and then turned her attention to Lillian’s asshole. Not-Sarah swirl her inhuman tongue around the tight button causing it to plump and darken into a round chocolate donut. Sweat trickled from Lillian’s brow and her heart pounded in her chest as she felt the silver dollar sized ring spread her cheeks apart and press into the saddle. <br />
<br />
The real Sarah finally noticed something was wrong with her doppleganger forced her tongue inside Lillian’s mutated hole all the way to the root. Lillian screamed and came hard. Fluids leaking onto the saddle in thick globs. She curled over hugging herself letting out a moaning lust-filled whimper. <br />
<br />
“Lilly!” Sarah shouted as she threw herself off of Nuggets and ran up to Lillian’s side. She took Lillian by the arm and pulled her from the saddle. Her soaked crotch peeled away from the leather with the same sound a person made when getting up from a leather chair on a hot day. <br />
<br />
In dim light Sarah couldn’t tell what fluids were pouring from her girlfriend’s crotch, and from the volume her EMT training had her picturing the aftermath of an intestinal rupture. Their relationship was open. Could it have been a miscarriage? Terrible thoughts were running through her head as she helped Lillian to the ground. <br />
<br />
Lillian quivered in real Sarah’s grasp as Not-Sarah continued to savage her. It was like that tongue was reaching inside her and molding her very soul. Her stomach grew hot as she felt parts shift and swell. <br />
<br />
“I-it,” Lillian moaned as she felt her spine be tugged on. Not-Sarah played with a swelling bump just above her ass. It pressed into the back of her jeans as it grew longer. Hair the same shade as what was on her head began to sprout from the browning skin of the growing appendage. The bristles tickled across her changed groin just as maddeningly as Not-Sarah’s not tongue. <br />
<br />
“It what, hon?” Sarah said, trying to remain calm. Handling strangers in pain was one thing. Seeing Lillian squirming in what seemed like agonizing pain was terrifying. <br />
<br />
“It-it feels…” Lillian’s hips crackled as they widened causing Sarah to jump. Her jeans split open across the seat and groin. “It feels so good!” Lillian screamed as she came again. Not-Sarah nodding in satisfaction before fading away. <br />
<br />
Lillian’s eyes snapped open, and she wrestled her mangles pants the rest of the way off. What she revealed made Sarah’s mouth fall open. First she saw the tail, still growing longer every second, trailing from one of the leg holes of Lillian’s utterly soaked panties. Lillian quite literally tore them away exposing her brand new and winking mare pussy to the air. <br />
<br />
The sudden shock of cold air against her boiling sex caused Lillian to gasp and fall back in a stupor. Her chest heaved and legs twitched as if she’d just run a marathon. Her new marehood and donut sat glistening between her legs soaking the crop of her equally new tail.<br />
Sarah blinked, not quite able to process what she’d just seen. Her thoughts raced as she watched her girlfriend’s huge clit wink up at her like a tiny error in reality.  <br />
<br />
“What…” she said dumbly before hearing a slap to her side. She turned to see Apache rear up, a massive pair of balls dangling pendulously between his legs. His cock slapped against his belly once again as he mounted up on Nugget and speared himself on the other gelding’s… vagina?! Nugget snorted as he and Apache’s balls slapped together as the two former geldings began their rutting, and if Apache’s winking backside and Nugget’s raging hard-on were any indication round two would follow shortly after round one. Sarah blinked again, looking back and forth between the two hermaphrodite horses and her girlfriend’s new, equine attributes. “... the fuck?!”</p>
