Jeff, looking at the screen, grinned as he didn’t mind the settings that he saw. Jeff thought it was kind of funny that his werewolf self and all 
werewolves would be gay, since Jeff had been gay for quite some time. Even though he knew, Jeff acted as straight as he could and thought 
that none of his family would know the truth about him. For as long as Jeff could remember, he enjoyed doing a lot of girlish things and when 
he got older, his attraction always ran toward the big, burly, manly type of men. In fact… men just like his dad and his brother. Thinking about 
what was displayed on the screen, Jeff began to wonder what else the Chronovac could tell him about everyone he wanted to know about and 
even began fantasizing about what would happen if he changed the settings to the maximum. Jeff even thought about his father Pete and his 
brother Ben coming upstairs into Jeff’s room to have their way with him. For as long as Jeff could remember, he had always had these incest 
based fantasies about his dad and Ben. Jeff couldn’t help it since both men were the type Jeff found himself most attracted to and he was dying 
to have “fun” with men like the two of them. Now, Jeff knew that this was definitely a possibility since he could change the settings and be privy 
to what would unfold. Jeff sat there in front on the computer, drumming his average fingers on his desk while staring at the screen. Curious 
about everything, Jeff scrolled up to the top of the available information, which was still on him, and smiled as he read the stats.
</br>
<br>

<li><b>Jeffery Masters</li></b>
<li>Species: Lycanthrope
<li><b>* All Stats are for both Human and Wolf forms unless indicated*</b></li>

<li>Cum Production: Average</li>

</br>
<br>
With all of those options being the main ones Jeffrey even cared about, he ignored the others, which were all subtle nuance type things and 
thought about what he wanted to change, but was also pretty curious about his dad Pete and his brother Ben. First though, Jeff had stuff that 
he definitely wanted to change about himself. First, he changed his hair color to medium brown with dark brown accents. Then he changed his 
body weight to 250 with his muscle rating to 80/20, making sure to change his body type to “Power Lifter” because he loved the idea of being 
a thick, strong, beefy dude and not one of those prissy body builders, then he changed his body hair level to “Above Average” since he loved 
the idea of being a muscle bear. Then Jeff changed his mannerism to “Straight Acting”, his stance as “Submissive to Father, Dominant to 
Brother” since he was the older son. Jeff grinned as he went to the next spot and thought about changing his man hood to ridiculous sizes, but 
decided against it. He made himself 3” long and 1” wide when soft; 7.5” long and 3” wide when hard; his libido to “Above Average” because he 
wanted to be able to have sex more; his stamina was kept the same; his precum production was changed to “Above Average” when slightly 
aroused and “Extreme” when aroused and hard, since that was something he had always wanted; then finally, Jeff changed his cum production 
to “Above Average” since he definitely enjoyed cum and wanted who ever his partner was to enjoy it too! Then, Jeff went back to the werewolf 
options, at the bottom and slid all three options to ten, just to be sure to make a pack with very healthy numbers. Then, with all of the changes 
he wanted made, Jeff hit the “Accept” button. 
</br>
<br>
When Jeff hit the “Accept” option, a window popped up that read: </br>
<br><center><b>Warning – All changes made to these options will result in all other 
werewolves to have the same settings. Do you wish to proceed?</b> </center>
</br>
<br>
Reading that, Jeff grinned and clicked “Yes”! As Jeff sat there, he began to feel his body tingle as the changes started to happen. Amazingly, 
everything changed in the order from top to 
bottom. His hair darkened while losing the red; his huge new muscles grew in quickly while his skin stretched and added tissue so not to break 
and get stretch marks; his fat reduced while still being there to give his enormous muscles a softness; his body hair increased, making his 
forearms and legs look like a thick, dense forest of hair while his chest and muscle gut spouted hair, but remained trimmed and definitely 
added sexiness to him.  Then the more “fun” areas changed where he began feeling more manly, more assertive and slightly dominant; his 
cock stirred as it grew to his specified sizes and with the changes happening, he became slightly aroused from it and began leaking pre, 
making him feel wet in his pants, which made his heart soar. Jeff couldn’t wait to see what happened when he was hard or when he climaxed! 
As the changes stopped and Jeff gave himself a moment to adjust and become comfortable with his new body, especially since he was still in 
his tattered Denim shorts. Shifting a bit, getting used to his new size and improved equipment, Jeff toggled the program to scan for all males 
in the same dwelling. Slowly, the scanner began to whir, revving up, as the computer displayed “scanning” with a small animation indicator 
rotating to show that it was working. Within a moment or two later, the screen changed and displayed Jeff’s father first, then his brother.
</br>
<br>

<li><b>Peter Masters</b></li>
<li>Species: Human
<li>Hair Color: Dark Brown with medium brown natural highlights</li>
<li>Height: 6’ 3”</li>
<li>Weight: 215 Lbs</li>
<li>Body Type: Muscular</li>
<li>Body Hair: Average</li>
<li>Muscle to fat: 70/30</li>
<li>Muscle Type: Outdoorsman</li>
<li>Sexual Orientation: Gay</li>
<li>Mannerisms: Straight Acting</li>
<li>Dominant or Submissive: Alpha Male</li>
<li>Cock Size soft: 3.5” long, 2” wide</li>
<li>Cock Size hard: 8” long, 4” wide</li>
<li>Libido: Above Average</li>
<li>Stamina: Average</li>
<li>Precum Production when slightly aroused: Average</li>
<li>Precum Production when aroused and hard: Extreme</li>
<li>Cum Production: Above Average</li>
<li>Marital Status: Unhappily Married</li>

</br>
<br>Immediately reading his father’s stats, Jeff was shocked to see that his father was listed as gay, not to mention the other outstanding 
stats. In fact, Jeff was happy with how his father was and thought about making a tweak or two. Quickly, Jeff changed his father’s Muscle to fat 
ratio to 80/20, his muscle type to “Power Lifter”, his body hair to “Rugged Bear”, his cum production to “Gusher” since Jeff was definitely going 
to get some action once the changes were made and his marital status to “Happily Divorced”. Jeff figured that his father was “Unhappily 
Married” because of his sexual orientation and doing what he did to appear normal. With his father’s changes entered, Jeff decided to move on 
to his brother.</br>
<br>

<li><b>Benjamin Masters</b></li>
<li>Species: Human</li>
<li>Hair Color: Light brown</li>
<li>Height: 5’ 10”</li>
<li>Weight: 225 Lbs</li>
<li>Body Type: Muscular</li>
<li>Body Hair: Average</li>
<li>Muscle to fat: 70/30</li>
<li>Muscle Type: Power Lifter</li>
<li>Sexual Orientation: Gay</li>
<li>Mannerisms: Straight Acting</li>
<li>Dominant or Submissive: 50/50</li>
<li>Cock Size soft: 1” long, 1” wide</li>
<li>Cock Size hard: 7” long, 3” wide</li>
<li>Libido: Average</li>
<li>Stamina: Average</li>
<li>Precum Production when slightly aroused: Average</li>
<li>Precum Production when aroused and hard: Average</li>
<li>Cum Production: Average</li>
<li>Marital Status: Single</li>

</br>
<br>
Yet again, Jeff was shocked to see that his brother too was gay and straight acting. There was no way that Jeff had ever thought that about his 
father or his brother, yet the proof was staring him in the face. The other stuff, well… Jeff was aware of that since he had stumbled in on his 
brother in the shower a couple of times. Come to think of it, since he was reminiscing about seeing his brother naked in the shower, he 
remembered that his brother was not only ok with Jeff being in there, but seemed to invite him in as well. Jeff grinned at the prospect, always 
thinking that being with another family member was kind of hot, but now the potential of two was just too much! Focusing on the task at hand, 
Jeff made his brother like his father, leaving his endowments the same and changed everything else where it counted. Scrolling down to the 
bottom, where the “Accept” button was, Jeff noticed another option that wasn’t there with him. It was an option for changing the living 
arrangements as well as another toggle box with the option to make only him aware of how the world was before he changed it. Jeff clicked the 
box, knowing that it would be better this way and he couldn’t wait to see what happened. Jeff decided to leave the living arrangements as they 
were because he figured once he hit the button, things would change and the world would be reformed to fit his changes. Thinking about how 
fun it could be to make both of them a werewolf with the device, Jeff contemplated to change that option as well. After only a moment’s 
thought, he decided to leave both his father and his brother human because he wanted to have fun changing both men into a werewolf like 
him. As Jeff hovered the mouse over the “Accept” button, he grinned from pointed ear to pointed ear, knowing that things were definitely going 
to become much more interesting.</br></p>
