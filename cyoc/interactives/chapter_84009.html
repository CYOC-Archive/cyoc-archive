<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sammy had woken up, arm wrapped around Gloria, with the sun shining in hir eyes. Shi leaned over and kissed hir friend before getting up and walking around the now empty airport. Shi gave a slight shiver as shi looked around. Shi saw Heroud and walked up. &quot;Don&#39;t an empty airport spook you, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled and turned around, chuckling. &quot;In a since yes. I mean could be a sniper somewhere and take me out. I&#39;m a general and anyone would love to put a bullet in my head but right now, as it sits, they know I&#39;m here to help here. And help I&#39;m going to give. Anyway, how are you adjusting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With the change? Well, it certainly is different. I never thought, in all my life, I&#39;d resemble them.&quot; She points to the statue of a dragon. &quot;But, in all honesty I came to accept it. Though I feel bad for changing Gloria, and changing several others, but it wasn&#39;t my fault. And now we got an asswhole to find, who better hope I don&#39;t get my claws on.&quot; She looked over. &quot;I was happy working at my zoo. It was like my home, but I wouldn&#39;t trade the experience from this for nothing.&quot; She pointed behind her. &quot;I mean It...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear, I get what you mean. I&#39;ve been considering getting the change myself. I mean I look at your sister and hir friends and see how powerful they are, and well, if they wanted they could easily take me. Plus with two hearts in their body, shooting one wouldn&#39;t be enough and going for the second wouldn&#39;t be easy, plus while the first is healing the other keeps pumping enough to keep them alive. So, I&#39;ve been looking at the Pros and Cons.&quot; Heroud smiled. &quot;Plus, I seen you and the other, what are you calling yourselves...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dracokats. We would go Dragonkats but that is too long. So we use the latin term for dragon to shorten it.&quot; Shi sat back, tail wrapped around hir legs. &quot;I mean I love that I see Gloria is happy, but I think that&#39;s because shi&#39;s with me. Not because of us both being &#39;kats&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nevertheless, I&#39;d still be with you, should you have asked me many years ago, Sammantha.&quot; Came Gloria&#39;s voice as shi walked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wasn&#39;t into girls.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. But, I never truely was a girl. When I was born I was both. As rare as it is, I was born a hermaphrodite, so having a cock and pussy, is nothing new.&quot; Shi hugged hir friend. &quot;And I know you knew, you stared at my buldge multiple times when I would walk with you to classes.&quot; Shi teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just thought it was a really good strapon.&quot; Sammy said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it sure was good enough to scare most of the boys away. I still haven&#39;t used it.&quot; Shi giggled. &quot;So all things are forgiven for giving me this wonderful gift. And you know, we Chinese honored dragons, so becoming this isn&#39;t a curse, it&#39;s a blessing.&quot; Shi said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And with the altered vaccine,&quot; Mikkie said walking up, holding a new vial in hir hands. &quot;This is a gas form of the vaccine. It&#39;ll counter the gas form of the virus, and on top of it it&#39;ll vaccinate the kats, and more. See, I combined the Vaccine ment to keep humans from changing, with the Vaccine to keep the virus from spreading. This will work to stop all. Only problem is, I don&#39;t know where to take it to release it to the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria smiled. &quot;It happens that as a matter of fact, I do.&quot; Shi walked up. &quot;We take it to the worlds highest place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mount Everest?&quot; Sammy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct. We can set it as a bomb, and let it explode. The stuff will get caught in the jet stream and spread like wildfire. But it&#39;ll take weeks, months, perhaps even years to cover the entire globe.&quot; Gloria smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genius.&quot; Heroud said. &quot;Say where&#39;s Danna?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that one is easy.&quot; Mikkie pointed at a clothing store. &quot;Where else would you find one who is so into fashion?&quot;<br />
<br />
At that all four started laughing. Yes even General Heroud. &quot;Alright. We have to vaccinate Hong Kong first, then we&#39;ll move to Everest. I hope this works, Mikkie, for I, am one who absolutely hates the cold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You live in Paris.&quot; Mikkie challenged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Point taken.&quot; He said and walked over to Danna. &quot;Hun. What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re selling my product here.&quot; Shi points at the vine like clothing. &quot;I made human clothes too out of it. And they&#39;ve only got one.&quot; Shi cleared hir tears.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
In Janice, Alexis and Flake had returned to see a rather plump Charlie. Who was ordered by hir mother to stay in bed. Flake walked right up and sat beside hir. &quot;Hey Charlie.&quot; Shi said rubbing hir belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Flake.&quot; Charlie looked at hir, purring at the rubbing. &quot;That feels great, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. Did you hear any updates?&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet. All I know is Midnight is in Cairo.&quot; Charlie stretched some.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, from what I gather, Aunt Snowy, Luna, Sally, went to help, while Mikkie and Danna had to rush to Hong Kong. Alexis and I had to go to China and that&#39;s the latest we heard on them.&quot; Flake said. &quot;Though I heard there&#39;s trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie looked. &quot;Hun, it&#39;s the Middle east, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just hope that they&#39;re not in the middle of it. But the trouble I ment was in Hong Kong.&quot; Shi looked. &quot;Say where&#39;s Jess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess had to leave to go to Washington to try and administer the vaccines if needed. Fortunately the Sec Def had tracked down all those with type O with the D strand, so that will help tremendously for making new vaccines. And perhaps stronger ones. They plan to vaccinate the greater populous with the vaccines. Thus hoping it spreads to smaller communities.&quot; Charlie explained. &quot;Fee City was the start of this. Did you know our own President was there during that. He is a Kat. A pink fluffy pussy cat like. Had I not have my Sally, I&#39;d try and mount hir.&quot; Shi chuckled only joking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Well, me and Alexis had discovered something with our seed. It has the capabilities to act and change animals.&quot; Shi noticed that the two chakats that they changed somehow made their way here. &quot;Anyway...&quot; Shi looked at Charlie as a gush of water shot right out of hir cannal. &quot;Shit. Hold on Charlie.&quot; Shi ran to get a towel, warm water and blankets, returning quickly, shortly followed by Alexis. Flake was down there at the end while Alexis was comforting Charlie and rubbing hir belly. Flake looked up. &quot;Okay, Charlie, I&#39;m ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexis looked. &quot;I may have a faster way to get them to slide right out.&quot; Shi looked. &quot;Pleasure Charlie&#39;s clit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, climax.&quot; Shi said reaching up and rubbing Charlie&#39;s clit, who was moaning while shi was pushing. Shi let out one loud moan of pleasure as Alexis stroked hir sheath as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s balancing out the pain with pleasure. Making it easier. Dad did this with mom.&quot; Shi kept rubbing hir sheath as shi and Flake aided Charlie in the birth.<br />
<br />
Charlie who kept pushing while enjoying the pleasure leaned back. &quot;I hope Sally won&#39;t get mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing else you can always tell her the trick.&quot; Shi giggled.<br />
<br />
Flake kept up with teasing his clit, but stopped a moment, Charlie looking over. &quot;Relax, I got hir.&quot; Shi aided the kit out and laid hir in a basket, then went back to work. For paws up ready to catch the next one as Charlie leaned back and climaxed right there, the kit sliding out nicely into Flake&#39;s paw. Charlie relaxing some as Flake and Alexis cleaned them off. When they were done, they looked like their mom and dad in many ways. Half black, half white with spots, one poofy, the other not. But Flake noticed something about them, and frowned. &quot;Oh my...&quot; Flake looked. &quot;Go get Maurice, Alexis.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a few moments Alexis and Maurice came in. &quot;What is it...&quot; Instantly shi saw. Unlike most, these two were born with twin pairs of tails. &quot;A deformity. Perhaps a result of them being twins?&quot; Shi asked. &quot;It certainly requires some looking into, but all together, they are healthy as a pair of oxen.&quot; Shi smiled. &quot;Nothing to worry about.&quot; Shi handed both to Charlie who began nursing them. &quot;Congratulations, Charlie.&quot; Shi smiled. &quot;You just gave birth to the first set of twin chakats.&quot; Shi looked as all three when to sleep.<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
In Cairo, Sally was fighting hir way through the city when hir phone went off. Shi answered it. &quot;Hello?&quot; Shi said vaccinating a kat who came up. &quot;Flake, I&#39;m not sure this is a good tim...&quot; Shi looked. &quot;Really?&quot; She said excitedly as shi kept shooting darts, while talking. &quot;Oh my....&quot; Shi said. &quot;Well, I&#39;m proud of hir. Shi did good. Well, you keep watch over my babies.&quot; Shi said. &quot;Send me pictures.&quot; Shi said hanging up. <br />
<br />
Just as Sally hung up, shi ran out of ammo, some Jakalkats walked up to hir and grabbed hir, from behind. &quot;Be a good kitty and lift your tail or you won&#39;t see your family again.&quot; One said. Sally, attempting to fight, got hit on the head as hir ear piece came out. &quot;Do it again and we cut your throat.&quot; One held a blade to hir neck as shi complied.<br />
<br />
The other proceded to sniff. &quot;Oh yes. Shi&#39;s in heat. And shi&#39;s mine.&quot; Shi chuckled, jumping up and mounting. In broad daylight proceded to rape Sally. &quot;Fight and my friend slices. Comply, you&#39;ll go free.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
Sally wimpered, ears folded back, as shi caught the look in one&#39;s eyes. They weren&#39;t filled with lust. These two were rapists. Shi frowned as shi was, for the first time powerless. When one climaxed tying in hir pussy, shi turned and hir friend mounted, sliding in with the first&#39;s cock being tied in hir, blade at hir neck still. &quot;My turn.&quot; Shi proceded to continue what hir partner started.<br />
<br />
After shi was done, shi dismounted and the two stood there mocking Sally, as Sally knew shi will end up baring children that are a product of rape. As soon as the two finally pulled out, they grabbed hir arms. &quot;You know, brother, this one will do fine as a breeder slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agre...&quot; Just then the other fell down, head being shot right between the eyes.<br />
<br />
A yell came over as a dot was centered on the others head. &quot;Get your paws off of my mother you fucking freak.&quot;<br />
<br />
The jackat looked up ready to fight as Midnight jumpped down dropping the fire arm. Midnight rushed at the monster who raped hir mother and tackled hir to the ground, and proceded to beat the jackat within every inch of hir life. Sally came too and seen what hir young daughter was doing and walked up pealing hir off. The jackat was pretty well dead. Well, that or close to it. Sally brought a claw right to the jackat&#39;s cock and sliced. Shi then looked at hir. &quot;Let that be a lesson to you. Don&#39;t fuck with me.&quot; Shi looked leaning on hir daughter who walked hir back to the chopper that brought them to the area. Midnight looked. &quot;Take my mother back to hq. Move it to the sphinx. Trust me, it&#39;s a perfect spot. Me and Talia will finish up here. Shi climbed back onto Gloria and called Snowy and reported what happend. As for the Jackat, shi lied in a bloody mess, but still alive, cock cut off and blood flowing from where it was.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jess had made it to Washington, for hir new mission. It was rather easy. Get there, extract several pints of blood and make a vaccine. Shi had gotten a call from Mikkie on a way to make a gas vaccine on hir way to the capital, which they decided to use the white house as a base. Shi looked around and smiled at them.  &quot;Hello Miss President.&quot; Shi shook hir hand and smiled. &quot;Mr. Secretary.&quot; Shi looked as all sat down and looked. &quot;Sorry if I sat without permission. I currently am with child. And it&#39;s not easy.&quot; Shi looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to appoligize, Mrs...&quot; The chakat that resembled that of a jaquar looked at hir, whom Jess knew was the president.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Jess works fine, madam President.&quot; Jess looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, I&#39;m sure you know why you&#39;re here. And yet you&#39;ve already done so much for us, and for France. That is why we&#39;ve had decided to give you the Medal of Honor, you and all your friends, but that&#39;s not why you&#39;re here. We&#39;ll wait until your whole team is here for that. Now we got some other issued.&quot; Shi turned to the secretary.<br />
<br />
&quot;My niece lives in Sidney, and told me to prepare the seaboard for an outbreak and get as much of these vaccines as we can. So we got together enough people and foxkats that have the specific genetics to produce these. She also told us what cum from &#39;kats&#39; can do to our normal animals. And we tend to fix that.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m here to help.&quot; Shi said. &quot;You&#39;re lucky I wasn&#39;t as far along as my sister in-law, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have been able to come.&quot; Shi looked. &quot;So when can I get to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now.&quot; Both said. &quot;And we&#39;re going to help.&quot; The secritary said.<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
Lia and Luna had arrived in Alexandria and found it was safe. A kat here and there but they had already been vaccinated. Lia found hir parents home, and walked right in. They seen them sitting there on the couch. Fortunately Lia sent them photos of what&#39;s happened in Sydney and what is happening in Cairo now. Lia&#39;s family were glad to see their daughter was safe. And glad to meet Luna. Luna walked up, and had to blink hir eyes and though. &quot;Um... forgive me, Lia, but I gotta step out onto the balcony for a few.&quot; Shi walked out and rubbed hir head.<br />
<br />
Lia&#39;s parents looks. &quot;What is wrong with her?&quot; Hir father had asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s hir, and as for wrong. I don&#39;t know.&quot; Shi looked. &quot;I&#39;ll go talk to hir.&quot; Lia walked up and looked at Lia. &quot;What&#39;s wrong Luna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... your dad. He seems so familiar.&quot; Shi said softly. Shi looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Well, my dad has been to many places. Romania is where his family&#39;s from originally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna sighed as shi looked. &quot;Perhaps knowing my name before I changed would help. My human name was Christopher Galen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lia smiled. &quot;Well, Luna...&quot; Shi froze. &quot;G... Galen?&quot; Shi looked. &quot;Wait, Chrissy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s only one person who called me that. Lucous.&quot; Shi froze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Lia rubbed hir head. &quot;Talk about awkward. Your adopted mom was trying to hook me up with my cousin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna chuckled. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t be all that bad, would it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lia giggled. &quot;No, no it wouldn&#39;t.&quot; Lia hugged Luna, giving hir a kiss. Lia then turned opening the door. &quot;Dad, it&#39;s Chrissy.&quot; Shi said. &quot;Funny discovery.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy got up and walked over. &quot;I see. So it is true then. My brother and his wife are dead. But my nephew... I mean niece now, is alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been adopted, I&#39;ve a new mom and dad, and they&#39;ve taken great care of me too.&quot; Shi said softly. &quot;My sister&#39;s alive as well.&quot; Shi looked. &quot;It&#39;s good that I still have real family alive.&quot; Shi hugged hir uncle who returned the hug. &quot;And it&#39;s Luna now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; He stood there.<br />
<br />
Luna then gave him the run down on what has happend thus far with hir and hir new family. &quot;Why don&#39;t you two go to Janice, then when we&#39;re done we can all meet there and well, live.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked. &quot;Well, Alexandria&#39;s became home, but I&#39;m always interested in trying new places.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna then felt hir phone go off so shi answered it. &quot;Yes.&quot; Shi paused. &quot;Mid... what happened?&quot; Shi looked over. &quot;WHAT?&quot; Shi nodded. &quot;I&#39;m on my way.&quot; Shi looked at Lia. &quot;Mom just got raped by a pair jackats.&quot; Luna looked and headed to the door, Lia close behind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait up, Luna.&quot; Shi caught up. &quot;We go together.&quot;</p>
