<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Open pawed, Stetson lunges at Andrew and Andrew shoots, missing his target completely with Stetson's fangs bared, sinking into Andrew's shoulder. Andrew yells out in pain as Stetson releases his fangs from Andrew's flesh. Stetson smiles with blood dripping from his fangs, then winks and heads off to take out the other screaming militia-men.</Br>
<Br>Just as Stetson did, Andrew held his bleeding shoulder, not knowing what to do now that he has already had his game completely changed, not to mention from feeling actual pain, he wondered if he would indeed change into a werewolf then continue to be one even after the game ends at some point. Slowly, Andrew's thoughts changed from focusing on the negative aspects to the changes that were already developing in his body.</Br>
<Br>Just as Stetson mentioned right before he lunged toward Andrew, Andrew could feel everything happen to him. He could feel his muscles tighten up with adrenaline pumping through his veins, virility flooded his body like he never experienced in the past, making him want to get off as quick as possible and spread the lycanthropy to as many as he had the chance. With his already heightened senses, he could smell the fear, blood and... death in the air. It was new and extremely invigorating.</Br>
<Br>Before Andrew even knew it, his body bulked up to a size slightly less than Stetson's since he was just a skinny thing before. He looked at himself, seeing that his body increased in hair density, that his hands had begun shifting into paws with claws to match. Licking his lips, smelling the food that was now just in front of him, Andrew felt his sharp fangs and smiled, knowing the damage that he could inflict on someone now.</Br>
<Br>Andrew's now pointed ears perked up as he heard the footsteps of several people leaving through the front door, more than likely to join up with their brethren. Andrew's muscles bulked up slightly more, causing his clothes to split where they were the most taught. He felt the intensity of his bones crack and shift to fit his new form. His body still increasing in hair... no fur as it felt like each couple of strands jutted from every one of his pores simultaneously.</Br>
<Br>As Andrew was completing his first change into the very form he once dreamed of becoming in secret, he saw a hugely muscled and dark brown furred werewolf approach him. Andrew saw every inch of the massive form and longed for his change to be complete to join with his other brethren. Andrew wanted to speak, but found that he couldn't now that his face had pushed out into his muzzle, just to find out who this massive werewolf was and why he smelled food. Unexpectedly however, Andrew heard the voice of Stetson, but it was not coming from his ears... it was coming from inside his mind.</Br>
<Br>"So I see that you are already changing into a werewolf like I just did. Fuckin' right on!"</Br>
<Br>"You better bet your sweet ass! How is it that we are even able to communicate and why do I smell blood?"</Br>
<Br>"That is just the fuckin' thing... I have no idea how we are doing this. We, our now enemy humans, always speculated that werewolves were able to communicate somehow or else how would they accomplish such accurately planned strikes? The reason you smell blood is because there is a lot spilled out in the rest of the hall when I attacked the rest of the defenses."</Br>
<Br>"Fuckin' sweet about the communication and about takin' out the humans in this house. I still smell death though! Why did people die when you attacked?"</Br>
<Br>"It beats the shit out of me, but it also answers something humans also wondered, if women were able to contract lycanthropy. The answer is no, they can't because all the death you smell is from the women that died almost instantly. So now I have a question for you Andrew, my new werewolf brother... how does it feel?"</Br>
<Br>In his werewolf form, Andrew looked his new body up and down, getting a feel for his new and improved body. He smiled a wolven smile with his maw, showing Stetson that he rather enjoyed the way he was now. Werewolf Stetson nodded in approval, but Andrew could tell that he wanted more.</Br>
<Br>"I think we both like the way that we are now, but what's left of our clothes sure is constricting and very uncomfortable."</Br>
<Br>"I agree with you bro, plus I am curious to what we are both sporting between both ends of our legs."</Br>
<Br>Stetson just nodded while the two tore away their remaining tattered clothes with their sharp claws, letting the tatters fall to the ground beneath their feet. When they were done, the two stood there fully in their wolven glory, letting their fluffy new tails swish behind them and something else hang as freely as it was meant to be. Stetson and Andrew</Br></p>
