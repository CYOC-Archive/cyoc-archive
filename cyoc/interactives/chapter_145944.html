<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Another gravelly roar of pleasure slips from your jaws as you continue to rub your spear of latex against the boy&#39;s puny dagger, tucked away in worthless clothing. However, your grin begins to turn into an unpleased scowl as you remembered your state moments ago; bound, naked, and ready to be converted. What better than to do the same to this <i>stupid</i> boy?<br />
<br />
Pulling away, the boy looks at you pleadingly, hoping to somehow instill you with your lost humanity. His eyes light up as your scowl vanishes, leaving your expression neutral, almost calm. You wind your arm back, your claws ready to strike, although he appears to interpret it as meaning you&#39;d be cutting his bonds.<br />
<br />
He cries out and flinches as you swing at him, expecting pain. All he receives is cold air hitting his bare skin and the sound of clothes ripping.<br />
“What th--” Cutting him off with another dark chuckle, you squish and grind your latex member against the boy&#39;s now bare pelvic region, his cock practically being suffocated by your balls. He yells hopelessly as the remains of his shirt, shorts, and underwear fall to the latex covered floor, sickeningly and noisily eaten by the seemingly sentient goop.<br />
<br />
He shuts his eyes in denial, biting his lip in a mix of fear and unwilling pleasure. Continuing to rub against his bare body, you bring your clawed webbed hands and gently tease the boy&#39;s sensitive nipples, eliciting a quiet gasp. His attempts of squirming to escape the tight latex bonds only result in him grinding against you, returning the favor. Lowering your shark-like head, you sensually lick at one of his nipples, coiling your tongue around it.<br />
<br />
You can <i>taste</i> his fear…<br />
<br />
And it tastes <i>GOOD</i>.<br />
<br />
A moan freezes in his throat as his eyes divert upwards from the pleasure, his squirms abruptly ending. Not amused by the sudden lack of movement you pull away, hoping your retreat will give the boy more false hope, yet he stays still, his mouth frozen open in <i>fear</i>. <br />
<br />
<i>Drip</i><br />
<br />
Your eyes glance down as you hear something small drop onto the large latex covered floor, sounding akin to a droplet of water falling into a puddle. Your eyes widen.<br />
<br />
Realization hits you. And it wasn&#39;t a pleasant realization.<br />
<br />
An annoyed growl escapes your throat as you see a large tendril of white goo crawl down from the dark ceiling, small drops of white falling into your land of grey, easily consumed by it&#39;s dominate presence. The white tendril slowly makes it&#39;s way to the boy&#39;s open mouth, before winding back and preparing to strike it&#39;s frozen prey, completely ignoring you.<br />
<br />
A wet squelch echoes throughout the dark room as your webbed claws grasp the tendril of white goop, feeling unusually solid yet malleable at the same. The tendril of writhes in your grip like a snake, the webbing between your fingers preventing it from being able to slip out. The boy flinches as he sees the mass of white squirm before him, captured by you. It almost mirrored his situation.<br />
<br />
About four more tendrils of white latex trickle down, ready to consume their next prey. Although before they can even reach the bound, naked teen, the floor of grey latex suddenly surges up, wrapping around the white tendrils and easily subduing them as by your will. <br />
<br />
You bring the tendril of white latex to your jaws, hungrily licking your chops. Bringing the “head” to your lips, you sensually slurp it down, the “body” and “tail” of the tendril squirming around, as if it too held fear. Slurping it down with ease, your eyelids droop as you&#39;re rewarded with a taste reminiscent of vanilla.<br />
<br />
“Revenge sure is sweet.” A loud burp from your maw is enough to make the other four tendrils squirm in fear, joining the boy in his futile attempts to wiggle free from their bonds. <br />
<br />
“Struggling won&#39;t do you any favors. It&#39;ll only prolong the inevitable.” You grin sadistically as you look at the boy, crushing one of the bound tendrils beneath a clawed foot as you noisily slurp down two more tendrils.<br />
<br />
You gently caress your belly as a loud gurgle resounds from your meals. Oddly enough though, the gurgle didn&#39;t <i>feel</i> like it had come from your stomach. <br />
<br />
Shrugging it off, you continue to grind the sole of your foot against one of the tendrils, repeatedly spreading and clenching your webbed toes and shuddering as the worm of goop wiggles between your toes in a futile effort to get free. Picking up the other remaining tendril, a devilish grin crosses your monstrous face as you take notice that this one is <i>much</i> larger and longer than the previous ones. As if instructed by an external force, instead of bringing the tendril to your jaws, you slowly lower the mass of writhing latex to your erect member, grey viscous goo leaking from it&#39;s tip.<br />
<br />
You inhale quickly as you feel the wet head of the tendril wiggle futilely at your urethra, accidentally prodding at your cocktip. <br />
<br />
You plunge.<br />
<br />
Crippling to your knees in unmatched arousal, the tendril&#39;s head squirms inside your dick, it&#39;s  attempts to escape by wiggling only succeed in making it slide down further until it is completely sucked into your ballsack. Drooling, you clench your webbed toes and slide your foot forward before grasping the only surviving tendril in unbridled hunger. Bringing it to your cock, large amounts of grey latex drip from it, as if your cock <i>itself</i> was salivating.<br />
<br />
But before you can do so, your jaws fly open in shock as the tendril is abruptly <i>sucked</i> in by your cock, as if your member contained a hunger of it&#39;s own, before meeting the same rate as it&#39;s cohort. Landing onto your hands from such pleasure, you grunt as your balls suddenly churn. Glancing between your legs, your jaw drops as you see your balls begin to grow, their grapefruit size increasing. A shred of realization hits you as you realize where the previous gurgle had come from.<br />
<br />
Pain fills your sack as your testes begin to grow to such an extent that your scrotum is stretched to it&#39;s maximum limit. But the growth doesn&#39;t end. Falling to your wide barrelled chest, you roll onto your back and desperately clench your growing balls, praying for the pain to <i>end</i>. Your cock throbs as it lengthens with your growing sack, widening and pulsing until your spear is now a greatsword fitting of a latex shark. <br />
<br />
Rasping, you slowly sit up, shaking as you take notice that your urethra is at your chin, your cock wider than both of your already heavily muscled arms put together. And it&#39;s <i>still</i> flaccid. Your balls, a completely different story, near the size of <i>basketballs</i>. Yet even that was an understatement.<br />
<br />
Rising to your feet, your eyes blur as your cock is so long the tip is to the floor, the grey goo sliding against your urethra causes your knees to buckle. In your fogged mind you glance at the naked, still bound boy. His eyes widen as he realizes that there&#39;s no more tendrils to keep you preoccupied. <br />
<br />
“<i>Please…</i>” He whispers as you slowly make your way towards him, his whimpers falling on deaf ears. Every squelch of latex from your feet hitting the floor causes him to squirm ever more. <br />
<br />
His struggles cease for the final time as your wide muscled frame stands before him. Lowering your head to his neck, you gently lick, thick viscous saliva trickling down his neck and onto his bare chest.<br />
<br />
“<i>Mmmmmm…</i>”<br />
<br />
“You taste <i>good</i>, boy.”<br />
<br />
Unable to even shiver, the boy is rendered completely frozen.<br />
<br />
“I can&#39;t wait to savour your <i>fear</i>.”<br />
<br />
He remains unmoving as his bonds suddenly liquify, turning thick and viscous. The thick ooze slides under his arms and between his legs before bringing them together, binding him. More latex coils around his ankles and below his neck, slowly making it&#39;s way around his body before completely encompassing him, forming a makeshift cocoon while leaving his head, cock, and feet exposed.<br />
<br />
A loud gurgle resounds from your muscled stomach. Your thirst for vengeance wouldn&#39;t have ever been satisfied through mere conversion. You wanted this boy to <i>suffer</i>, to feel the same pain you did, <i>tenfold</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Didn&#39;t you</i>?<br />
<br />
Of course you did.<br />
<br />
Fearful whimpering and the sign of his wiggling socked feet were the only remaining signs of his struggling. The rest of the boy&#39;s body was coiled so tight he couldn&#39;t even move. Slowly walking around the table, you stand before the teen&#39;s exposed head, your shark-like features staring below in contempt. <br />
<br />
“I must admit, <i>boy</i>, even in such a sorry state your will to resist, to <i>live</i>, is admirable. But like all prey, in the end you&#39;re nothing more than a meal to satisfy me, the predator&#39;s, insatiable hunger.” You slide down to your knees, your face now at level with the boy&#39;s bound form. “Accept your fate. This is simply the consequence of abandonment, of reckless courage.” <br />
<br />
He offers nothing in response. As if accepting his demise, the movement of his feet ends. The squeaking of the latex cocoon along with his whimpers also end. A single tear escapes one of his eyes, unnoticed in your heartless crusade of twisted revenge. <br />
<br />
Your eyes light up in interest as the boy gives in so suddenly to his fate despite his previous struggles. With a few words, he so easily bends to your will. A part of your humanity seems to resurface, born from the will to not let such resilience be forgotten to the laws of nature. Closing your jaws, you rise up to look down at him.<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s your name, boy?”<br />
<br />
His head perks up at the sudden question, unable to comprehend such a simple question in such a serious situation. He was about to die, yet all you cared about was knowing was his name? Not to mention how surreal it was having a huge muscular shark about to eat him asking such a stupidly trivial question. <br />
<br />
The boy&#39;s mouth opens, his expression seeming to imply he was going ask <i>just</i> that. His expression changes as he appears to contemplate, mouth closing as he chews on his lip.<br />
<br />
“Alex... My name&#39;s... Alex.” You give a cheeky grin at the name before gently rubbing the boy&#39;s cheek with a claw, who remains unflinching, his once bright eyes rendered dull.<br />
<br />
“Such resilience you&#39;ve possessed throughout all of this. Such a strong soul can&#39;t be forgotten. I&#39;ll remember you, Alex.” His expression returns neutral as he stares past you into the ever expanding darkness of the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Unable to contain your hunger any longer, you drop back down to your knees, grey latex rippling and squelching from the impact. Hungrily licking your lips, you part your jaws, thick globs or saliva trickling down your chin.</p>
