<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing in front of the mirror, I groaned as it became apparent that some time during the night I had shrunk and now stood only about four feet tall. Tucking my penis and testicles back, I groaned again as I saw that I looked even more like a girl like this and reaching over, I pulled the pair of pink pants off my bed, my thoughts on what happened the night before.<br />
<br />
Previously I had just found the amulet, only to discover that my Aunt Jeannie not only knew about the amulet, but also the changes that were occurring. And what made it all the more confusing was when she said that she could offer an explanation, if I would allow her to do so.<br />
<br />
Thinking that what I really wanted to do was go play with Katherine, to which Aunt Jeannie told me, &quot;If you don't want to hear what I have to say, that's fine. You can allow the transformation to continue, unabated, and go and play with Katherine if you want,&quot; almost as if she was reading my mind, which I wondered now if maybe she was.<br />
<br />
Torn, I finally took my Aunt's hand and she gently took the amulet from me, explaining as she did so, &quot;I can keep this safe for the moment,&quot; and then leading me out of the front hall, and back upstairs, she explained, &quot;Tomorrow, when you awake, do not get dressed as you would normally do. After your mother and Katherine have gone to school, I will offer what I hope is an explanation of what is going on.&quot; and then she parted ways, allowing me to play with Katherine, or do whatever I wanted, as she went back downstairs.<br />
<br />
Looking over at my sister's sleeping form, I wondered how much I would look like her if I continued to transform. Already I had hair that was midway down my back and just a smidge lighter then Katherine's. My eyes had shifted from Hazel to the same Bluish-green she had. But what bothered me the most was that, if I let the transformation continue, I would have the same female slit between my legs that she had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means,&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;Learning to pee sitting down, periods later in life and maybe pregnancy if I really wanted to have sex with another man someday,&quot; and then shuddered at the thought of a male putting his penis inside of me.<br />
<br />
Turning away from Katherine, and looking back into the mirror, realising that with the pink, crushed-velvet pants on, I looked younger and more feminine. Reaching over to where the purple shirt that I was going to wear was laying, I pulled it on with the thought, &quot;At least I'm not wearing girl's underwear,&quot; I shuddered once more at the thought of doing so, thinking of how I wasn't wearing any right at the moment.<br />
<br />
Turning, I felt my give a slight slip and before I realised what it was I was doing, I found myself skipping across the room I shared with Katherine and collecting the ten-inch Angelina plush that was on my bed, I skipped out of the room just as Katherine was waking.<br />
<br />
The early morning passed in a blur and before I knew it, my mother - who looked like she was about nine - was up and out the door, with Katherine tagging alone behind her. Turning to Aunt Jeannie, eating my cereal, kicking my feet back and forth, I asked, &quot;Are you still going to tell me a story,&quot; not quite realising how much like Katherine I sounded and was behaving like when she had been a year younger.<br />
<br />
Smiling, my Aunt stood and slowly clearing the table, she nodded and told me, &quot;Yes sweetie. Just let me tidy up a bit and then I will explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cringing because of the word sweetie and how my mind wanted to take another fantastic leap, I nodded and as she cleaned up from breakfast, I finished mine. Afterward, she led me into the living room and taking me on her lap, cuddling me close to her in much the same fashion my mother had done with Katherine, Aunt Jeannie started her tale.<br />
*****<br />
<br />
&quot;My tale,&quot; Jeannie began, &quot;Starts with two dogs and a couple of very curious kids.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was one of the dogs and the other one was my litter mate, your mother. Only we weren't female at the time, but a couple of happy, but unaware, son of a bitches.<br />
<br />
&quot;In truth, I have no idea why all that happened took place, only that it did. Coming home one day, my owner Justin was accompanied by his friend, Jonathon. Joking and laughing amongst themselves, I followed them, just wanting attention. And then Justin produced the amulet and said something to Jonathon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not knowing what was being said, I thought they were playing as they tackled me. Playfully nipping, I soon realised that something was wrong as they quickly snapped a leash on me and hauled me behind the barn.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, they tied me up and left me, unsure what I had done wrong, but sure I had done something. Hours passed and eventually the two came back, only they had an article of clothing. Backing up as they approached, unsure of what they were going to do, I watched and allowed them to force the dress, for that was what it was, onto me. And then, after that, they stood there, laughing at me, till finally Justin leaned down and said something to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hours afterward, I finally learned what it was, but still didn't know what it meant. It took me years to finally understand what a sex slave was, and even then I couldn't believe that my owner would want to do something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aunt Jeannie took and deep breath and then continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Touching the amulet to me and then dress, I suddenly experienced a sharp pain throughout my body as I slowly transformed into a human female of about nineteen years old. My mind caught between having just been a dog and now being a human, I watched as Justin and Jonathon stood, laughing amongst themselves. And then they removed the leash and led me into the barn, were they had their way with me.<br />
<br />
&quot;This sort of treatment went on for weeks on end before I was able to fully start to formulate a decent plan. And when I did, it was one for revenge for what they had done.<br />
<br />
&quot;But even then, it would still take about two years before my plan could be carried out. In that time, I was forced to allow Justin and Jonathon to have their way with me. But as they did so, I allowed myself to observe and learn from my surroundings and when the time came, I acted.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a cool summer night that I finally took my revenge. Breaking into the house was easy - nobody really thought that someone would come in through the doggy door. Searching the house, the first thing I located was the amulet. Next, I back tracked, looking for something I knew that was kept, just not sure...Later I learned the word what I was looking for was collar. And when I found one, I returned to Justin's room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Inside, I waited to see if he was as heavy a sleeper as he sometimes was, when he would fall asleep after having his way with me. After a bit, sure he wasn't going to wake up, I approached his bed and kneeling down next to it, I watched him sleep, wondering how it was that he was able to keep me a secret and that nobody knew about me.<br />
<br />
Reaching out, I laid the collar on top of his naked chest and then gently I touched the amulet to his body and the collar.<br />
<br />
&quot;The effect was instantaneous as Justin's body began to transform, sprouting blonde fur all over. But what surprised me even more was when I shifted the covers to make sure he didn't get to tangled up, I noticed that his privates were also shifting. And within moments, all that lay in Justin's bed was a bitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quickly figuring out how to snap the collar on, I told the dog, 'If you ever want to see you old life again, you'll do exactly as I tell you', and then leading the surprised canine out of the room and downstairs, I wondered what I should do next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quickly the idea to go after Jonathon came to mind, but I really didn't know where to find him. Looking down at Justin, I thought about figuring out how to transform him back, not knowing at the time that there was time limit of about twelve hours before the next transformation, and then changed my mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Releasing Justin out the back door, telling him that he would be like this for a good long time until I was satisfied that he had learned something, I looked at the amulet and then figured to go look for my litter brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Years later, my litter brother also transformed and willing to assist me, we discovered a cult that worshipped the amulet and in discovering, we learned all that was to be learned about the amulet. Having already spent ten years as humans, and unable to find Jonathon, we made a pact that we would always keep an eye out for each other and then decided to regress back to human children, figuring we had spent too many years as humans already and that there was really no point in returning to our dog lives.&quot;<br />
*****<br />
<br />
&quot;Those two children we became, eventually grew to be your mother and I,&quot; Aunt Jeannie announced as she finished her tale. &quot;We kept an eye out for each other, and for any news about the amulet. And when you mother brought the amulet back to me, something I had lost years ago, I immediately thought of how much trouble it had caused. But then your mother, at my request took the amulet away and at some point must have accidentally used it, because she would never openly use it after what we agreed when we became human children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why she looks like she is regressing,&quot; I asked Aunt Jeannie.<br />
<br />
Nodding, my Aunt explained, &quot;And why I am also here, as your legal guardian. Which is also how I know about the amulet and am aware of your transformation. And which is why I also know, that because the amulet is cracked, that it has enough magick left for one last transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that going to be me?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Aunt Jeannie smiled and then explained, &quot;I don't know. You're going to have to make a choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What choice?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aunt Jeannie shifted and then looking at me, she replied, &quot;I have something to show you. Something that involves your friend Thomas and why you haven’t seen him in awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at her, I was about to ask her what she meant, but she cut me off with, &quot;Go and get your coat. We have somewhere to go.&quot;</p>
