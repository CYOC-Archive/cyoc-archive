<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Abigail Grant had been a Star Student just like Jennifer was, her picture was plastered all over the papers and it didn’t take Jennifer long to find things out about her thanks to the internet. She had been a genius with high grades and a high work ethic. However after her visit to St. Elsa’s her health had deteriorated and the appearance she had at the end was accounted for by lots of makeup and a lack of eating. However Abigail wasn’t dead, or rather she was, Jennifer wasn’t exactly sure how to explain it but Abigail Grant was now her little sister. A five year old without any memory of her prior life and the temperament and knowledge of a five year old. However Jennifer knew she was an adult under all that. She was smart, not knowledge wise but kind of like how someone with amnesia is still good at art. She knew math even if she wasn’t aware of it and she seemed to have random facts in her head. The only problem was that Jennifer’s parents didn’t pick up on this thanks to her own successes in the classroom. She even had a paper that listed Abigail as a girl with high potential and her parents mentioned that she had gotten a similar paper when she was done her first year. It just seemed so odd to Jennifer and she didn’t know what to do. Lisa was equally freaked out by all this but she didn’t want to investigate Abigail she wanted to distance herself as far away from the girl as possible. So Abby ended up latching onto Jennifer asking her to play all the time. As weird as it was Jennifer obliged. The headmistress may have turned her into her little sister but she was still her little sister.<br />
<br />
Summer passed with as much investigation as possible but Jennifer could only get so far before she had to look towards school in order to find more answers.<br />
<br />
The drive to school was delayed by a ravenous rainstorm that lashed at them and made them drive slower. Because of it they ended up arriving at the school late near sunset actually. They pulled into the drive and teachers looked up. Jennifer and Lisa exchanged a look of shock upon seeing dozens of boys around the front.<br />
<br />
“Must have helped unload,” Tristin muttered before opening the door and helping her three girls out. Madame Criss met them and apologized for the boys. Jennifer however got a good look at them. One boy was frowning heavily while another whined that they were in the wrong place. Jennifer watched the boy roughly her age with his stark brown hair and brown eyes. He wore his shirt untucked but that was all she got to see before they were ushered into an office as a family’s o sign some late paperwork. Madame Criss shut the door locking them in and the chalkboard in the room suddenly ignited into a hypnotic series of images. Lisa and Jennifer blinked against it but it didn’t last long. Their parents and sister stared mouths agape at the wall while Madame Criss entered again.<br />
<br />
“Have a nice year Mr. and Mrs. Primrose!” Madame Criss exclaimed before she turned to the Lisa and Jennifer, “You missed dinner, we’ll have some sent up to you later. Abigail iIll Show you to your room. Girls I presume you can find your new dorm room, you’ll be in the bigger ones this year. I don’t want to hear about any tomfoolery or fights. You are to behave. You’re in room One seventeen.”<br />
<br />
Lisa and Jennifer walked to their new room rather baffled and upon entering it they found it had four beds instead of two and was a bit roomier with actual desks for working set under the loft beds and bookshelves to place their books or other things upon. No roommates were present though so both girls exchanged a wary look before beginning to unpack. They finished before the door opened again and two figures stood in it. Jennifer felt her eyes widen in shock at the sight of a girl with Sharp brown hair that fell to her shoulders and brown eyes that glistened with confidence. Her shirt was untucked in a rowdy manner and she greeted them as Charlie. Jennifer couldn’t believe it, it was that boy she had seen but now he was a girl.<br />
<br />
The new girls were boys. That was the simple reality. They had hobbies typical of boys, liked to tease each other like boys, but as far as they knew they had always been girls. It freaked Jennifer out but Lisa was convinced Jennifer was believing too much weird stuff. Hypnosis was one thing but creating anatomically correct girls from boys was too far fetched.<br />
<br />
Charlie was an overly confident athletic girl with early developing breast buds on her eleven year old body. The teachers quickly stuffed her in training bras and every time she entered a classroom her shirt had to be tucked back in and her tie straightened only for her to undo that work in the desk over from Jennifer and wink like she was proud of being unruly.<br />
<br />
Jo, short for Jodi, was the other girl. She liked the outdoors and running and was quickly drafted onto the sports teams. Thanks to her star student status Jennifer got to see her every day in a swimsuit wearing it like she had been doing it for her whole life. Jodi was quiet otherwise so Jennifer got along with her.<br />
<br />
She half expected the parents to freak out but whenever Charlie or Jo called home they just talked to their parents as if nothing had changed. Their parents didn’t even react when they were picked up at Christmas time. Jennifer watched Charlie’s parents greet her and her dad ruffled her hair like she was a boy and talked about how he’d finished building that tree fort.<br />
<br />
No one even reacted. The only people that seemed to be aware were the teachers. Charlie brought action figures with her and a few days later they were gone, replaced by new toys, much larger possible dolls themed after princesses and nurses. When Jennifer brought this up Charlie just brushed it off and called her crazy before proceeding to play with the dolls in the same way she had with action figures a few days prior.<br />
<br />
This led to a weird trend Jennifer started to notice. Some of the girls at school had strange aspects to themselves almost as if they hadn’t been raised as girls with all the pressures that accompanied it. A lot of girls seemed to recognize a cartoon that had been specifically aimed at boys from five years ago and even more seemed to lack any baby pictures or evidence of their existence before being five. Jennifer had to wonder, exactly how many of the girls at St. Elsa’s has been boys. A good deal from every grade it seemed. Odd girls with boyish habits. Almost the same habits Jennifer had though the habits seemed to vanish with time. A girl named Stephanie in her grade was almost certainly one of the boys turned girls and yet she was one of the most feminine ladies at St. Elsa’s. Jennifer’s idea of this was basically confirmed when they got their first sexual education talks. Some of the girls would crack jokes and seemed to be eerily familiar with the anatomy of the penis. Charlie even went on a giggle inducing explaination as to how boys peed standing up and no matter how hard they shook they couldn’t get that last bit of pee out of their penis, alas why they constantly smelled bad and had pee stains on their underwear. She didn’t have a brother.<br />
<br />
Miss Circe taught the class and for the first time the graphic details of puberty were explained. Most of the presumed boys turned girls would gag and make a big deal out of this as if female anatomy disgusted them and yet male anatomy was all the rage. At the very least there wasn’t a section of the honours class dedicated to more in depth body changes. Instead Jennifer’s own body decided to do that. One day she just woke up and realized one of her breasts had budded. Not both just one. It was panic inducing and she thought something was wrong with her. She and Lisa were promptly examined and suddenly bras were a requirement at school. Tiny little things meant to conceal the nipples. A lot of girls had to start wearing them or already were and it was rather embarrassing until the other nipple inflated as well. However this scared Jennifer to death as fear of a period emerged and overtook her priorities. Spelling bees, track and field, swim meets. None of them mattered and the gold medals she kept winning did little to ease her fears. At least until Jennifer realized that Charlie had ditched her dolls entirely and was now focused on adult things. She just came back one day and suddenly had nail polish which all four girls indulged in. Gossip dominated the floor and Jennifer was reminded rather painfully of the whole brainwashing thing. This just kept happening and by the end of the year all the boys had completely become girls with just trace amounts of their boyish past leftover such as Charlie’s untucked shirts. Jennifer’s investigations yielded little to no results. She had no idea where this was being done or why but now she knew they were doing more than just brainwashing girls. They were far more sinister. As she watched Charlie hug her mom and dad before getting in her parent’s car Jennifer couldn’t help but want to stop it even more than before. Now it wasn’t just vague curiousity. Now it was the desire to halt whatever went on at St. Elsa’s before they did something  to her, or worse made her forget she even noticed in the first place.</p>
