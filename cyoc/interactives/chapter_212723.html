<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bruce chuckled as he wrote down all the details on the Chronivac. He setted that Dean would become &#39;Lightning&#39;, a 7-years old Thoroughbred stallion, with slick black fur, for the next two hours. He setted Dean mind so he&#39;ll stay human mentally, thou he added some horse instincts to help with his mission-breeding Sahara.<br />
When he was finished, he called his son. &quot;Dean! Meet me near the stables, I have something to show you.&quot;<br />
Dean headed towards the stables, womdering what his dad wanted to show him. Maybe he has a prize for him, for winning the race? Anyway, whatever it is, it should go quick. Jeff is going to trasform back tommorow, and Dean knew Jeff couldn&#39;t wait longer. He approached the stables, and saw his father waiting for him outside, waving his phone. &quot;Here!&quot;<br />
As Dean got closer, Bruce pushed a button, starting his transformation. Bruce smiled at his son, and said: &quot;Remember that after the races, I walked away with a guy? His name was David, and he told me about a very special app... Oh, here he is. Hi Dan!&quot; Waved his father. Dean turned and saw Dan, a pretty normal-looking guy. &quot;What app?&quot; Asked Dean coriously.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s called the &#39;Chronivac&#39;, and apperently, this app has the power to change almost everything. So I decided to reverse the age of your horse, turning Sahara into a 6-years old mare-just at her prime time for breeding.&quot;<br />
Dean was shocked. This guy, Dan, knew about the Chronivac? And his father wanted him to breed Sahara? Jeff would never forgive him!<br />
&quot;What?! Dad! I don&#39;t want to breed her! She&#39;s my horse, and I&#39;ll do whatever I want with her!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. You will,&quot; Grinned his father. Dean was confused. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sahara would not be the only one to change. You see, the stallion who came second-&#39;Thunder&#39;, I reckon? Has been stolen just after the race. No one knows where he is. And because I haven&#39;t found any good breeder her level, I decided to do something... more interesting. Dean, since you love Sahara so much, you&#39;ll get to be her mate,&quot; His father said. Dean didn&#39;t understand. &quot;What do you mea-ahhh!&quot; He shouted, feeling his ears growing longer, and his fingers mashing together, changing to hooves. &quot;You&#39;re gonna make me a horse?!&quot; He asked in disbelief. &quot;But I&#39;m your son!&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a prize, Dean. You see, you&#39;ll love it. And It&#39;s only temporarly anyway. After you impregnate Sahara, you will tranform bck into a human-my son, which I&#39;ll be even more proud of.&quot;<br />
&quot;But, dad, please! I don&#39;t want to do this! I-arrgh!&quot; He sighed in pain, as his legs and back changed, forcing him on all fours. His trousers bursted, and Dean blushed in embaressment. Dan laughed. &quot;Hey, kid, don&#39;t be embaressed. Stallions aren&#39;t shy about their equipment. And you&#39;ll love being a stallion. I know, I&#39;ve been one!&quot;<br />
Dean couldn&#39;t respond; He was too busy trying to keep his balance, until his hands changed, transforming into a horse&#39;s front legs. His body shifted, gaining a more equine posture. A tail bursted out of his back, swinging and lenghtening. Dean cried, thinking: &#39;Jeff would KILL me!&#39;<br />
&quot;Oh, Dear, don&#39;t cry. It might be a bit painful now, but trust me, It&#39;ll be worth it,&quot; sayd his father, stroking his new body&#39;s black fur. Dan said ominously, &quot;Now only two changes remain...&quot;<br />
Much like Jeff, Dean felt a burning sensention in his crotch, but unlike Jeff, he could feel his privates changing, transforming into massive stallion&#39;s cock and balls. A sheath formed, completeing his genetalias change. Dean pleaded in fear and embaressment, &quot;Dad, please, don&#39;t make me do this, ple-eeeeighe!&quot;<br />
&quot;Now for the last part,&quot; Said Dan. Dean&#39;s face pushed ounwards, forming a snout. He tried to shout in anger, but all that came out was a fearful whinney. His eyes changed last, completing his transformation. His father patted on his side, and said: &quot;Wow, Dean-or, I geuss, Lightning-you&#39;ve become quite the specimen... and you&#39;re, well, pretty well suited for the mission,&quot; He said with a grin. Dean neighed in anger, stomping the ground. Dan laughed again, and Dean turned to him. It was all his fault! Dean started approaching the man, wanting to kick him as hard as he could, but his father shouted: &quot;Stop!&quot;<br />
Dean turned to him. Bruce patted his muzzle. It felt good, and it calmed him down a bit. &quot;You know I love you, and I would never want to harm you, right, son?&quot;<br />
Dean nickered. He knew his dad loves him, but... Why whould he do this?<br />
&quot;Listen, Dean. Our family needs money, and we need it as soon as possible. Breeding Sahara will get us the money, and we couldn&#39;t pay for a proper stud. That left me with two options, turning either of us into a stallion-and since you love your mare so much, I figured you should be the one who mates her.&quot;<br />
Dean neighed. He understanded why his father thought it was a good idea, and he probably was agreeing if Sahara was a real horse... But she wasn&#39;t. She&#39;s his best friend Jeff, and Jeff would never forget him if he mates him-even if he wouldn&#39;t actually become pregnent, thanks to the fact that she&#39;ll change back tommorow. He neighed in disagreement, stomping the ground. He wasn&#39;t going to do that!<br />
&quot;I see you&#39;re struggling, son, Let me help you with that...&quot; He pushed another button on his phone. Suddenly, a strange scent filled the air, and he could hear Sahara whinneying in her stall. The smell was intoxicating, and Dean followed the scent, untill he stood in front of Sahara&#39;s stall, who looked at him in fear, but also... in hunger. She wanted him, told him his stallion instincts. He needs to mount this mare!<br />
&#39;But this mare isn&#39;t just a mare, She&#39;s my best friend Jeff! I can&#39;t do this to him!&#39; he told to himself, his cock throbbing out of his sheath. It became harder and harder, and his dad opened Sahara&#39;s stall, letting him in. &quot;Come on, you two! Make me proud!&quot;<br />
Dean and Jeff both tried to resist their urges, but without avail. The stallion started licking the mare&#39;s dropping sex, and she neighed in pleasure. &quot;Mount her already!&quot; shouted his excited dad. Dan laughed at the horses again, and gave Bruce a high-five.<br />
Dean, now giving in to Lightning&#39;s instincts completely, started mounting Sahara, whose her instincts took her aswell. The stallion found his spot, and started thrusting into the mare. Both horses whinnyed in pleasure as they hit climax. Than Dean dismounted, his mind taking over again. He neighed in fear. &#39;Oh no, what have I done...&#39;<br />
Jeff&#39;s mind kicked Sahara&#39;s instincts out as he gained control on himself. He felt disgusted, defiled... But he coulndn&#39;t deny that was the most pleasureble moment in all of his life. <br />
Jeff watched in shock as the stallion&#39;s massive body started reducing, changing Dean back into a human boy. Jeff neighed in anger, feeling betrayed; Why would Dean ever to that?!<br />
Bruce helped his son to get up. He smiled at him, and said: &quot;Dean, you dont know how much you made me proud... put on some clothes, and let&#39;s go enjoy ourselves. And for you, Dan, thank you so much. This Chronivac really did proved itself, and for the best.&quot;<br />
&quot;No problems, Bruce,&quot; Responded Dan. &quot;Just remember, be careful with it.&quot; He turned around and left them alone, walking to his car. Dean turned to his dad, and asked: &quot;Please, dad, before we go... can I get a moment with Sahara?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course, dear,&quot; said his father, and left the stables. Dean turned to Sahara, and pleaded: &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Saha-Jeff. My dad forced me to this, I promise you, I am so, so sorry.&quot;<br />
Jeff whiinyed in anger, but also in relief. At least he didn&#39;t mated with a complete animal!<br />
Dean continued. &quot;But don&#39;t worry, nothing has changed between us, I will never talk about that, and when you&#39;ll change back tommorow, you can do anything you want to me. Please, forgive me!&quot; He cried.<br />
Jeff was angry at him, but he understanded. His dad would always make him do stuff against his will, and besideds... Dean made quite the handsome stallion, and, to his shame, he really enjoyed their act. And Dean was his best friend... He can&#39;t be angry at him for too long. He neighed. &quot;I fogive you.&quot;<br />
Dean smiled, tears still dropping from his eyes. &quot;Thank, thank you so much. I promise you, when you&#39;ll change back, we&#39;ll do anything you want. You can turn me into a cockroach if you want! I&#39;m so, so sorr-&quot;<br />
Jeff stomped the grouned and snorted. &quot;Dude, I&#39;ve already forgiven you, don&#39;t try to annoy me again.&quot;<br />
Dean chuckeld. He heard his father voice coming from outside the stables. &quot;Dean? Are you coming?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I got to go, girl,&quot; He said, petting Jeff&#39;s side. &quot;See you tommorow-I just can&#39;t wait for you to be yourself!&quot;<br />
He left the stables, leaving Jeff to enjoy his last few hours as a horse, a mare, as Sahara-his best friend, and his mate.</p>
