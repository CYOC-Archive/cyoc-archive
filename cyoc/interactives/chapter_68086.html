<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Following his mother as she pushed the cart into the section of the store for teenage boys, Justin wondered what the hell was suddenly the matter with him. Barely paying any attention to what his mother was picking out, he nodded in an offhand manner and after a moment, selected various items for himself and putting them in the cart, he noticed the three sets of pyjamas and asked himself, &quot;Did I put those in there? Or did mom?&quot; but found himself at a lost as to why and who had put them in the cart.<br />
<br />
After they were done in that section of the store, Justin's mother commented, &quot;Forgot your underwear,&quot; as she started to leave, to which Justin just shrugged in an offhand manner, not really paying attention as he looked at a bedding set for a little girl's room, thinking it was really cute and whether his mom would buy it for him.<br />
<br />
It dawned on him what he was thinking and turning away from the bedding set just as his mom was selecting a pair of little girl's underwear with Barbie on them, commenting, &quot;These should fit you,&quot; as she looked at the size tag and chart.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't wear those,&quot; Justin whined out, suddenly realising what his mother was holding and who she was talking to.<br />
<br />
Gazing down at the package of underwear in a distracted manner, Justin's mother suddenly exclaimed, &quot;Oh. I'm sorry sweetie. I forgot you don't like Barbie,&quot; and as Justin tried to understand what she meant about him not liking Barbie, which his mind told him was obvious, he watched in an off-hand manner as she returned the package and instead picked up a different package with Hello Kitty print, commented something in an distracted manner about it as she read the information printed.<br />
<br />
After a moment, she tossed the underwear into the cart, looked about and after a moment's thought, selected another package in the same size, noted that it had no design on them and that there was three different colours being offered, pink purple and teal, and grabbing a third, with strawberries printed on them, tossed both packs into the cart as she commented, &quot;Done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure as to why his mother was buying him girl's underwear, Justin thought about asking, but was immediately distracted when his mother announced, &quot;And for being so good, you may each pick out one toy,&quot; as she turned the cart and began to push it towards the toy section.<br />
<br />
Not really wanting a toy, wanting instead to figure out why his mother was buying him girl's panties and pyjamas and why he suddenly was so attracted to things he thought normally only a girl would be, Justin thought that maybe his mother was suddenly going through some crazy phase, but immediately dismissed such a notion as it did not explain why he was suddenly having the thoughts he was having. Gazing at his cousin, he thought of the broken toy, but was unable to find a reason as to why a toy might be connected to his mother's suddenly odd shopping habits for her son or his off thought patterns.<br />
<br />
As his mother led the way into the toy section that he noticed was bright and pink, Justin thought about the one-piece with the tail and how he had gotten a static electric jolt off of it. He thought about the tail sewn to the back and how it had been black with a white tip and the ears, solid black, that were held in place by a white piece of plastic.<br />
<br />
&quot;One toy,&quot; his mother said to Mandy and looking about the aisle, he forgot about the onesie when he saw the dolls and plush animals. Picking up a twelve inch Hello Kitty plush wearing what he thought was such a pretty dress, he hugged it close, cradling it in much the same way that Mandy would hold her dollies and plush animals. Gazing about the aisle, Justin wondered if his mother would allow him to get a couple outfits for Kitty as he realised that her dress could come off and be changed for a different article of clothing, something he thought Mandy might like to do if she was to play with Kitty.<br />
<br />
His mother's voice telling him, &quot;Put it in the cart, Justin,&quot; distracted him and dropping the Hello Kitty plush in the cart, he asked, &quot;May I please get her some outfits? It's still only one toy? Please?&quot; unaware that he was pleading and begging in the same manner Mandy did when she wanted something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; his mother told him and as he started to look at the pretty outfits that would fit Kitty, she also told Mandy, &quot;You may also select an outfit for your dollie.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Justin browsed the doll clothes, thinking that each in turn would make Kitty look pretty, he failed to realise that what he was doing was more appropriate for a little girl instead a fifteen year old boy and when he finally found a couple outfits, he tossed them into the cart, thinking only of how much fun he was going to have and whether his cousin Mandy would join him.<br />
<br />
While Justin wandered about the aisle and Mandy pointed to the outfits she wanted, which Justin's mother put in the cart in a distracted manner, Justin's mother also reread the list of things she was buying and stopping what she was doing, she told Mandy, &quot;That's enough. I forgot to get you and Justin new swimsuits, as you have both outgrown your old ones,&quot; and pushing the cart back down the aisle, she told Justin, &quot;Come along,&quot; as he had missed entirely what it was she had said.<br />
<br />
Back in the section of girl's clothing, she began to browse the recently placed swimwear, taking a couple off the hangers and looking at them. After a moment, Justin's mom had a fair bit and looking back at her son, she told him, &quot;Come along,&quot; and immediately started making her way to the fitting rooms.<br />
<br />
Realising where it was his mother was going, Justin felt a sensation of trepidation crawl over him and unable to think of a way to get his mother from dragging him along into the extra wide changing room for mothers who are buying clothes for their children, he followed along behind her. As she stopped the cart, he commented, &quot;I'll wait out here,&quot; sure that what his mother wanted was for Mandy to try on a couple of the bathing suits, but when he mother told him, &quot;Nonsense. I need to see if any of these fit you,&quot; he almost whined out, &quot;But mom,&quot; catching himself at the last moment.<br />
<br />
As he wondered what was suddenly wrong with him and his mother, Justin watched as she lifted Mandy out of the cart, grabbed the pile of swimwear she had picked and following her into the changing room, he thought that he would die if anybody from school saw him in the extra wide changing room, trying on girl's swim suits, as if it was a normal thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need my help undressing?&quot; his mother asked, disrupting his thoughts as she handed Mandy one of the swimsuits, which Justin noted was obviously a size or two bigger than the one his mom was handing him.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, unsure how it was he was going to get out of doing what it was he was about to do, Justin glanced at his cousin, noticed that she apparently had no qualms about stripping naked, and following suit, he hastily pulled off his clothes and taking the swim suit, which he saw had a picture of Hello Kitty on the front and was primary pink and white, he pulled it on, sure it would not fit.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, the swimwear fit him better then he thought, despite it clearly being for a little girl and as his mom squatted down in front of him and began to tug at a couple areas, making vague comments every once and a bit, Justin gazed at his cousin and then the mirror, wondering what had happened and how it was that he had would up in such a situation. But before he could get too far in such a thought, his mother comment, &quot;You'll need the next size up,&quot; and handing him another swim suit, tie-died with Hello Kitty print, she told him, &quot;Try this one on,&quot; and complying, he watching in an offhand way as his mother fiddled with the swimwear Mandy was wearing, making sure that it fit and she wouldn't grow out of it in a couple months.<br />
<br />
Afterward, as he got dressed, his mother placed two of the one piece swimsuits and two of bikinis in the cart and commenting, “Done,” she made sure both Justin and Mandy where dressed before she pushed open the door. Returning the swimwear that she wasn’t going to purchase back and making her way to the front of the store, Justin following a couple steps back, she announced, “How about lunch now,” to which Mandy, who was walking alongside the cart, began to cheer and clap.</p>
