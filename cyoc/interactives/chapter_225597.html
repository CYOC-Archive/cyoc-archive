<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I don’t know how to write dominance/submissive scenes, so the options are kinda waiting their writer?<br/>
Once again, I fail to keep the content under control, this chapter suppose to end at finally the second possession 0x0</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Upon arriving at the dock office, I found Cornwall pouring over the accounts ledgers with a troubled scowl. As a former docker raised to his managerial position, numbers were not the boar&#39;s strong suit.<br />
<br />
Hearing my entrance, Cornwall bade me wait with an upraised hand. I took the opportunity to scan the open ledgers myself. Though a mish-mash to the untrained eye, my past job before being transported into Isekai including handling store inventory, granted me basic accounting skills.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long to spot discrepancies in the records. Politely, I pointed them out to Cornwall, who scrutinized my findings with surprise. After a moment, he grunted and made the corrections, visibly relieved.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve a head for figures, wolf. Didn&#39;t expect it,&quot; Cornwall rumbled as he worked. I shrugged, replying in Max&#39;s direct manner without giving a clear response. I know this is not like Max, but what I plan to do tonight isn&#39;t exactly what Max would normally do.<br />
<br />
I asked him curiously &quot;Why not hire someone to do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cornwall&#39;s grumble rose in volume and indignation. &quot;Hire a scholar, bah! Those pointy-hats want far too many coins just to scratch marks in a book. Don&#39;t know their ass from a cargo haul!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boar made a rude noise deep in his throat. &quot;No, ledgers stay with dock folk I can trust not to blab. Can rely on us to do the math, even if it&#39;s a slog. Secrets are coin, and I&#39;ll not lose both to some fancy-pants clerk!&quot;<br />
<br />
Catching his uncharacteristic loss for words, Cornwall aimed to change the subject. &quot;Best find sustenance while we discuss the day&#39;s mishaps, my treat.&quot; he rumbled, pushing aside ledgers.<br />
<br />
We took to the streets, the boar cutting a wide swath through evening foot traffic. His keen snout twitched, sampling scents on the breeze until he settled on a destination. &quot;This way, wolf. Fine fare and stout drink await.&quot;<br />
<br />
The restaurant was cavernous, its hearty patronage suggesting a fine reputation. Cornwall shouldered past lingering crowds, clearing us a path with his grandeur. Hoisting himself onto a sturdy bench, he let loose an ear-splitting grunt that drew the keeper hastening over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your best haunch roasted with all the fixings, and strong ale aplenty!&quot; Cornwall declared without hesitation, then turned his expectant gaze to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Max, help me choose. What cut of meat satisfies your palate best after a long day&#39;s labor?&quot; I asked gently. His gruff laughter rumbled through my mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;No fancy dishes. A thick rib steak, seared till the outside&#39;s crisp while the inside still bleeds. Fills me up properly.&quot; The memory of such a simple pleasure brightened his voice.<br />
<br />
I smiled, opening my eyes to the waiter awaiting my order. &quot;A rib steak as well, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.&quot; Our waiter nodded and departed, leaving Cornwall regarding me with interest but no questions.<br />
<br />
The delectable scents of sizzling meat and spices caused my mouth to water in anticipation. At last, piping hot plates were laid before us by a doe girl.<br />
<br />
Wasting no time, Cornwall dug in with gusto, blade and tine flashing. I took a more measured approach, inhaling deeply to savor each note of flavor upon my tongue. Max&#39;s appreciation was shared - the well-made food lifted our body and soul.<br />
<br />
Between bites, Cornwall recounted the day’s events, pausing to allow my questions. I flagged the names, places, and ship details he mentioned, looking for any clues or leads. But so far, nothing seemed out of the ordinary or suspicious. I felt frustrated, knowing that I was not in a detective game with clear options and obvious prompts.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Cornwall stiffened, a low grumble escaping his bristled jowls. &quot;Speak of the devil...&quot; He jerked his snout towards the entrance, where a short, well-fed rabbit beastman had just bustled in.<br />
<br />
Mercurius Billings, client rep by profile. His pink-eyed gaze roamed eagerly, finally latching with unseemly focus on us. Politeness barely restrained an enthusiastic gleam as he scurried over, all cordiality.<br />
<br />
As he greeted us, I couldn&#39;t help but notice the way his eyes lingered not on our faces, but on but on Max’s imposing physique—now mine. His interest was palpable, and so was his breathing, unexpectedly heavy.<br />
<br />
An idea sparked. I casually raised my arm, paw tucked behind my head, pretending to stretch. The muscles in my arm bulged and strained, showcasing my arm musculature, their size and peak impossible to conceal beneath my snow-white fur. With my arm raised, my armpit was exposed to the air, wafting out my musky smell of body odor. It was a silent invitation for him to marvel at my physical prowess.<br />
<br />
My display of power captivated Mercurius. He stared straight at my biceps, his talk reduced to a murmur, his nose twitching like crazy, absorbing my sweat and musk. His eyes widened and his mouth watered, as he gazed at my biceps and armpits with admiration and desire. I could smell the aroma of his body odor by my keen wolf nose.<br />
<br />
The allure was broken by the sound of Cornwall&#39;s thick fingernails tapping on the wooden table. The rabbit&#39;s long ears suddenly stood up, and he quickly straightened his collar, found an excuse, jumped up in embarrassment, and fled to the table far away.<br />
<br />
I turned to Cornwall, “Hey, Cornwall, what&#39;s wrong with that rabbit?” I asked him, pointing at the fleeing figure.<br />
<br />
Cornwall sighed and shook his head. “That’s Mercurius Billings, the business rep we just talked about. He’s a troublemaker, likes to cumber with the workers, especially those capable. He’s caused a lot of complaints and disturbances. But we can’t do anything about it. They pay well, and he has some connections in the city. Just pretend nothing happened, and stay away from him.” He said resignedly.<br />
<br />
Knowing all of this helps me form a plan in my head. A crazy, risky, and thrilling plan. But there was one problem. I was not inhabiting my own body, but Max&#39;s one. He was still in the body and could see, hear, taste, and feel everything I did. I don&#39;t want to ruin our hard-earned trust and hope he&#39;d agree to carry out this particular plan. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Max, I have something important to ask you. And I need you to be honest with me. Can you do that?” I said in my mind.<br />
<br />
Max’s voice answered me. He sounded gruff and annoyed, as usual. He didn’t like me very much but understood that I was trying to help him.<br />
<br />
“What? Just say it,” he said, impatient with my euphemism.<br />
<br />
“I want to seduce that rabbit with our hunk body and see if I can find anything fishy in your case. So, are you okay with being intimate with a male partner? &quot;I said, trying to sound as confident as I can.<br />
<br />
There was a pause. I waited nervously for his answer. I hoped he wouldn’t freak out, get angry, or reject me.<br />
<br />
“Heh, you don’t know what I like from my memory? Didn&#39;t expect a mind-reader to be so clueless. I don’t mind it. You can see in my memory that I had fun with many girls, hopin&#39; for love and a family of my own. But ain&#39;t nothin&#39; wrong with enjoyin&#39; life when the moment&#39;s nice, yeah? As long as I feel good.”<br />
<br />
I was stunned. I didn’t expect him to be so open-minded and easy-going. Really? You’re OK with it? You’re not lying to me?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not lyin’. Why would I lie? It’s your body now, anyway. You can do whatever you want with it. Just don’t hurt it, or make me clown. And don’t forget about me as I’m still here, you know.” he said.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Max. I appreciate it. And don’t worry, I won’t forget about you. I’ll always be here for you.” I said.<br />
<br />
Taking a swig of ale, Cornwall eyed me shrewdly with narrowed azure gazes. &quot;Something&#39;s got your tail twitching, wolf. Thinking of using that new nose of yours to sniff around Billings, eh? If you&#39;re thinking of clawing for information, hear me first.&quot;<br />
<br />
His gruff voice lowered warningly. &quot;No dragging the docks into your business, d&#39;you hear? Don&#39;t need the harbor in an uproar because you lost your marbles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet beneath the brusque words lay concern for a friend. Cornwall had known the old Max, and this strange change gave him pause. But he was willing to give the benefit of the doubt, for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll put a stop to any stuff if you are the clumsy old wolf before. But I see you have wits inside you now, Max. And no starting fights, or else I&#39;ll toss you in the sea myself!&quot; The boar pretended gruffness, but his eyes glinted kindly.<br />
<br />
Holding Cornwall&#39;s intense gaze, I nodded solemnly. &quot;No need to fret, old boar. I ain&#39;t some pup fresh off the hunt - got enough scars to prove it.&quot; A wry smirk curled my muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Information&#39;s what I seek, nothing more, rest assured the docks remain out of it.&quot; My words carried a new thoughtfulness alongside Max&#39;s familiar brashness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the vote of care, friend. Your watchdog role keeps us all on track.&quot; As I spoke, I stood up and took off my tunic, preparing my towering and muscular wolf body for <i>persuasion</i>.</p>
