<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Crystal walked into the library, finding Greg by himself.<br />
<br />
“Shit. Listen, you seem like a nice girl… um…” he started<br />
<br />
“Crystal.” Crystal answered bluntly.<br />
<br />
“Right. Crystal. You seem like a nice girl and all, but can we talk later? I’m kinda… spent at the moment.” Greg said, motioning to his penis.<br />
<br />
Crystal turned beet red. “I’m not here to fuck you! I’m trying to figure out why my best friend is talking like a fucking idiot and ignoring me now!” As she said this, she felt a surge of energy rush towards her. Suddenly, her crystal burned hot on her chest.<br />
<br />
Greg lurched over, clutching his stomach. “What’s… happening… to… me?!” He shouted out, his voice getting higher by the word.<br />
<br />
Greg shrunk down from 6 foot even to 5 foot 2. His frame shrunk down as well, his shoulders and waist pushing in and his hips widening out. His hands and feet shrunk next, becoming more effeminate. His penis shrunk and disappeared, replaced with a vagina as his body hair fell out.<br />
<br />
Greg, or rather Gemma, moaned out in ecstasy, no longer concerned by the changes. A pair of breasts began to grow as her now heart shaped rear began to inflate. They soon grew to large G cups, sticking straight up on the new girl’s chest and perfectly symmetrical. Her rear end grew to a similarly large proportion. Her flat stomach gained a bit of toning. Her skin turned a ghastly pale as any freckles, moles, or imperfections disappeared.<br />
<br />
Her hair cascaded down her face and back, turning a neon orange color. Piercings suddenly adorned her body, from her nose, to her nipples, to her tongue, to her lip, to her clit, and finishing off with a dozen or so in her ears.<br />
<br />
Heavy goth makeup appeared on her face as it became increasingly feminine, including winged black eyeliner, black lipstick, and black eyeshadow. Her lips puffed up, giving her a permanent pout.<br />
<br />
Finally, a pair of black leather boots, a tight latex skirt, and a latex corset top appeared on her. She was no longer in ecstasy but simply seemed to be completely relaxed, a glazed look in her eyes.<br />
<br />
“My charm must have protected me… but it sent the power back to Greg.” She realized; Greg had been a victim of his own power.<br />
<br />
Crystal couldn’t believe what had happened. However, she felt that something had changed in her, too. Once she looked more closely at Gemma, she realized what it was.<br />
<br />
“I’m a lesbian.” She said to herself, shocked. She knew she hadn’t been gay before. This beautiful goth girl in front of her, though, was arousing her on in a way she’d never felt before.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the glaze in Gemma’s eyes disappeared. She now had an aroused look on her face.<br />
<br />
“Greg?” Crystal stammered out.<br />
<br />
“I’m not Greg anymore. I’m Gemma now. My power must have moved from me to you.” Gemma said.<br />
<br />
“And you’re not mad?” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“I’ve never been happier. You’re so fucking hot, Crystal. And so am I! I’m sorry I was so rude to you before. And I never should’ve stolen Gwen away from you. You’re the rightful owner of the power, and now you can take all of your girls back!” Gemma said, hugging Crystal.<br />
<br />
Crystal hugged back. “All… of them?” She thought to herself, getting a bit aroused before shaking her head. “No! This might be - this is wrong! Maybe I should try to - I need to fix them.” Crystal thought to herself.<br />
<br />
“Can you take me to Gwen?” Crystal said. She hoped she could at least shake Gwen out of this spell. She definitely didn’t like the ditzy personality she’d been forced to adopt.<br />
<br />
“Of course, Crystal! I’ll do anything for you!” Gemma said. She started walking and Crystal followed.<br />
<br />
“Anything?” Crystal thought, again ignoring it as she tried not to stare at Gemma’s large rear.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the two saw Gwen. She was by herself in another corner of the library.<br />
<br />
“Gwen!” Crystal shouted out. As she did so, she felt the crystal heat up again.<br />
<br />
As soon as Gwen looked over, her eyes glazed over just as Gemma’s had. They, too, quickly turned back to normal.<br />
<br />
Crystal hugged Gwen. “Is everything okay, Crystal?” She asked. Her ditzy voice and bimbo-ish mannerisms had disappeared, but she’d kept the beautiful body she’d been bestowed.<br />
<br />
“Yes… yes, everything’s fine. I’m just glad you’re okay.” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
Without thinking, Crystal kissed Gwen, who happily returned the favor. Crystal broke the kiss as soon as she realized what she was doing.<br />
<br />
“Oh… oh, I’m sorry. I don’t know what came over me.” Crystal said, blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
“You never have to apologize for that, beautiful.” Gwen said, stroking the side of Crystal’s face.<br />
<br />
“No… no, I shouldn’t - I CAN’T do this right now. It might be - it’s wrong!” Crystal thought to herself.<br />
<br />
“A-anyway, we should find Heather.” Crystal said, composing herself. <br />
<br />
“Oh, I know where she is!” Gemma said, leading the way once again.<br />
<br />
She wondered if the two girls would be jealous of each other, as they seemed to be when Greg was their “partner,” but as the trio walked along, Crystal noticed Gwen acting just as flirty with Gemma as she had been with her, and vice versa. Crystal realized that she could have both girls at once, and before she could recognize how perverted her thoughts were, Gemma called out to Heather. <br />
<br />
Heather turned to look at the trio, and the crystal burned hot once more.<br />
<br />
Heather began to change, her blonde pigtails turning a bright pink as she, too, became as pale as a ghost. Her proportions remained the same, but her outfit changed to one more befitting a slutty goth girl, a pair of black denim shorts and a black tube top. She, too, gained a bunch of piercings, as well a black choker.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I missed you all so much!” Heather said, first hugging Crystal before moving on to Gwen and Gemma. Gone was the valley girl accent and high pitched tone; she still sounded extremely cheery and a bit spacey, but there was an heir of intelligence and book smarts to her voice and manner of speaking.<br />
<br />
“Woah…” Crystal thought to herself. The crystal was changing the girls to fit her new personal type - the only reason Gwen hadn’t changed was because Gwen was already beautiful to her.<br />
<br />
“I… I have to use the bathroom.” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“Alone.” She said, after realizing her harem was following her.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Crystal splashed cold water on her face. This was… wrong, wasn’t it? She was supposed to be straight. And yet, she’d always had feelings for Gwen. Maybe they weren’t as platonic as she thought. She’d never felt anything for any other girls in the past, so maybe she was just…<br />
<br />
“No! I know I was straight.” Crystal said to herself. The power must’ve been influencing her.<br />
<br />
Crystal looked at herself in the mirror. She felt the crystal burn hot once more - and an energy flowing through her.<br />
<br />
“What… what is this?” She said. Suddenly, she knew.<br />
<br />
Crystal began changing her body. Moving some fat from stomach to her breasts. Making her body hair disappear. Making her hips a bit wider. Firming up her rear end. Removing her various imperfections that she’d been self conscious of - straightening her teeth a bit, getting rid of stretch marks, making her face perfectly symmetrical. She made sure the dye would never run out of her hair; she also made sure her makeup wouldn’t come off. <br />
<br />
“Wait… what am I doing? Why am I… why am I changing myself like it’s nothing?” She said to herself. At the same time, she didn’t want to change anything back.<br />
<br />
“I can always change it later.” She said, walking out of the bathroom.</p>
