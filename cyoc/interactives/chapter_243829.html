<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack walked down the street. Looking at the window, he grinned at his plant body. Ever since he escaped from the McHenry estate, he&#39;s felt more in touch with nature. Speaking of which, he felt the call of nature now. Going over to a tree he unraveled his plant loincloth and began to piss. His green cock spurted out a rainbow arc of piss. It hit the ground, and the wildflowers grew.<br />
<br />
As the rainbow droplets hit the soil, they sizzled and sank into the earth. Within seconds, the nearby bushes quivered, and colorful buds emerged. The petals multiplied, stretching and morphing into various shapes. One such transformation occurred at the local coffee shop, where a barista named Linda was taking out the trash. The scent of the wildflowers wafted over, and she felt a sudden urge to touch herself.<br />
<br />
Her hand slipped under her skirt and into her panties. The fabric grew damp as her fingers danced over her swollen clit. She didn&#39;t realize that the rainbow mist from Jack&#39;s urine had reached her. The moment she came, her body began to shift. Her clit grew into a cock and her pussy morphed into a cock. She was a futanari now, a rare transformation indeed. Linda stumbled back into the coffee shop, her new cock slapping against her thigh as she moved. Her boss took one look at her and said, &quot;Well, Linda, I guess you&#39;re going to have to serve, just keep it in your pants this time,&quot; and handed her a new apron. It had been three months since anyone had noticed the changes in town, and they had become a part of the norm.<br />
<br />
Jack walked on, unaware of the chaos his body fluids were causing. The town had grown accustomed to the sudden emergence of wildflowers and the transformations that accompanied them. It was as if the town had always been this way, where reality was a canvas painted by the whims of McHenry&#39;s invention. A young boy playing in the park suddenly felt a strange sensation as a wildflower grew near his sandbox. He looked down to see his legs covered in a soft, pink fur, his hands morphing into clawed paws. His mother, watching from a bench, didn&#39;t even blink; she had seen it all before. She handed him a towel and said, &quot;Looks like it&#39;s time for you to learn how to be a proper were-cat, dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the local library, a stern librarian named Margaret felt the irresistible pull of the pollen as a bouquet of wildflowers bloomed by the window. She gasped as her glasses fogged over, her eyes widening and changing to a vibrant shade of gold. Her nose and mouth grew into a snout, and a tail began to sprout from the base of her spine. As her clothes tore away to reveal a body covered in shimmering scales, a set of wings emerged from her back. The patrons of the library barely glanced up from their books, as if a dragon-woman working at the counter was an everyday occurrence. Margaret cleared her throat and adjusted her new form, resuming her duties without missing a beat.<br />
<br />
Across town, at the bustling supermarket, a young cashier named Tim was ringing up groceries when he felt the sudden need to sneeze. As he did, a rainbow mist shot from his nose, and the wildflowers grew around his feet. His body grew taller, his eyes turned red, and his hands elongated into tentacles. His uniform stretched and tore, revealing a new, slimy body. The customers looked over briefly before returning to their shopping, as if they had always bought their milk and bread from a creature of the deep. The store manager nodded at him, saying, &quot;Tim, you&#39;re up for a shift in the seafood department,&quot; as if his transformation into a tentacle monster was a promotion.<br />
<br />
At the high school, Jack was now a celebrity of sorts. His plant-like nature had made him a bit of a mascot for the students, who found his whimsical presence a charming addition to their otherwise mundane lives. As he made his rounds, he couldn&#39;t help but feel aroused by the youthful energy surrounding him at the pep rally. He stepped outside for a moment, seeking solace in the night air, and as he leaned against the brick wall, he felt the pressure building within him. With a moan that was part pleasure, part pain, he released a torrent of cum that shot through the air like a rainbow waterfall, sprinkling the nearby bushes with his essence.<br />
<br />
However what he was unaware of was his cum was way more potent then his urine. As his cum hit the soil, the wildflowers grew exponentially faster. Their colors grew brighter, and their scent more intoxicating. It didn&#39;t take long for the effects to spread. At the high school, where the pep rally was in full swing, a cheerleader named Rachel felt an unusual tickle in her stomach. She was in the middle of a pyramid when the sensation grew unbearable. Her body convulsed, and she tumbled down, her teammates landing in a heap. Rachel looked down and saw a cock emerging from her stomach. It grew longer and thicker until it was a foot long and had a bulbous head that matched her skin tone. The crowd only cheered louder when it twitched. Her coach looked over and said, &quot;Rachel, you&#39;re in the spotlight! Get back up there, you&#39;re a natural-born star!&quot; Rachel blushed and climbed back up, her new cock bobbing with each step she took.<br />
<br />
Her changes weren&#39;t done yet. Below her large cock a hairy sack grew. Rachel had never felt so exposed and aroused in her life. She tried to ignore it but it was difficult with each pulse of her new cock. Rachel had always been popular, but this was a whole new level. The crowd cheered, unaware that her legs were also turning into those of a goat. Rachel was now a futanari with a cock that was growing longer and a set of legs that were covered in fur and had cloven hooves. She was a satyr now, a creature of myth, and she loved it. Her skin grew patches of fur as her ears grew pointed. Rachel clutched his head as the crowd cheered his name, &quot;Randy! Randy! Randy!&quot; his body seeming to reflect to match.<br />
<br />
His breast shrinking away into a muscular chest. Randy looked down at his body, amazed and excited by the transformation. The crowd continued to cheer for &quot;Randy,&quot; their applause echoing through the gym. Rachel&#39;s new cock was now a full fifteen inches long and as thick as a soda can. She could feel the power in her new form, the strength of the satyr surging through her veins.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want some ivory high?&quot; Randy yelled. Everyone cheered back, and he began to masturbate. His cock rumbled as something came out, it was his seed but it was not like anyone&#39;s else. It shot into the air, and as it fell, it hit a group of five girls. Each of them felt a warmth in their crotch before they looked down to see their underwear bulging outwards. Rachel watched in amazement as each one grew a cock. Each one grew to match the size of Randy&#39;s. The crowd cheered more as Rachel felt a sense of pride. She had created more like her.<br />
<br />
The five girls moaned as they gained some enhancements in addition to their cocks. The first girl, a shy brunette named Emma, grew a pair of majestic antlers. The second, a redhead named Alisha, sprouted surprisingly functional bat wings. The third, a blonde named Jessica, grew a horse-like tail. The fourth, a curvy Latina named Maria, grew a pair of bull horns. The fifth, a young Asian named Mei, grew a pair of fox ears. Each transformation was met with applause and amazement from the crowd. Had all become unique and powerful in their ways.<br />
<br />
The five girls jacked off with their cocks. as they came their transformations continued into something more mythical. Rachel watched in amazement as Emma&#39;s body grew taller and more muscular, her antlers grew even larger and pointed as her skin turned to that of a deer&#39;s. Her eyes glowed with a fierce light. Alisha&#39;s wings grew larger and darker, her skin began to take on a bat-like appearance. Jessica&#39;s horse&#39;s tail grew thicker and longer, her muscles bulging as she gained the power of a stallion. Maria&#39;s horns grew longer and more curved, her eyes turned a fiery red, and her skin took on a leathery texture. Mei&#39;s fox ears grew more prominent, and her tail grew fluffier; her skin now had a hint of fur. Rachel felt the energy of the room change as the five of them became more than just futanari; they were becoming something else entirely.<br />
<br />
They lost the female forms as male myths replaced them. Emma was now a mighty <b class="highlight">centaur</b> named Ethan. He thought in the masculine pronouns as his breasts were replaced with strong pecs and his hips with a powerful, horse-like body. His cock was still present but it was not the only thing that grew, his muscles bulged and his skin had a slight shimmer to it. His eyes remained human, but his face took on a fierce, almost divine, look.<br />
<br />
His upper body became that of an anthro deer with a boyish haircut to match his new form. He then said, &quot;I am now Ethan!&quot; The crowd cheered for him. Alisha, a vampire with wings, just like Ethan, he renounced his female name and now goes by the name of Aiden. &quot;Behold, Aiden the vampire,&quot; he announced. The crowd gasped in amazement as the two of them stood tall in their new forms. Jessica had become a minotaur named Jason. He looked around and said, &quot;I feel so powerful!&quot; as his tail swung from side to side.<br />
<br />
Maria was now a dragon, his body had lost all hair except his mane, which ran from his head to his tail, which was now a dragon&#39;s tail. His eyes turned gold, and his skin now had scales that reflected the light. &quot;I am now... Marquez, the dragon,&quot; he said with a powerful voice that echoed through the room. His cock was still there, a testament to his dual nature. Mei had become a kitsune, his skin now a soft white fur with red tips on his ears and tail, which had grown longer and more fluffy. He looked at his new form and giggled, &quot;Name&#39;s Max now, the sexy kitsune,&quot; he said with a wink to the crowd.<br />
<br />
The five strutted around the gym floor, their new forms a spectacle to behold. Randy felt so good that he wasn&#39;t the only myth in school. He had no idea his cum was just as infectious as Jack&#39;s urine, without the flower ability. The five of them had formed a bond, a pack of myths in a school full of humans. They had plans, big plans. Randy was still a bit shy, but his new form made him feel so powerful that he couldn&#39;t help but smile. The crowd had gone wild for Randy, the satyr, and the five others had become the talk of the town.<br />
<br />
Ethan, the <b class="highlight">centaur</b>, felt like he had been born to run. The gym was too small for him, and he yearned for the open fields outside of Ivory. His human mind was still present, but the power of his deer body was overwhelming. He felt the power in his legs and the strength in his cock. He knew that with one thrust, he could make anyone his. Aiden the vampire felt a hunger, not for blood but for power. The transformation had made him feel more alive than ever before. His wings fluttered with excitement as he thought of all the things he could do with his new abilities.<br />
<br />
Jason, the minotaur, felt a rage building in him. The power of his bull-like body was unlike anything he had ever felt. He knew he could crush anyone who dared to stand in his way. The crowd parted for him as he strutted across the gym floor, his massive cock bobbing with every step. Marquez the dragon felt a fiery passion burning within him. He could feel the power in his lungs, the desire to breathe fire and claim his rightful place in the world. His scales shimmered as he took in the amazed faces of the crowd, his tail lashing back and forth with excitement.<br />
<br />
Ethan, now a proud <b class="highlight">centaur</b>, took a moment to appreciate his new form. The power of the stallion was exhilarating, and he knew that with his new body, he could conquer any race he set his sights on. His hooves clopped against the hardwood floor as he trotted over to join the others, a cocky grin plastered on his handsome human face. Aiden, the vampire with wings, felt a thrill of the hunt. His fangs elongated as he imagined the thrill of the chase and the taste of power that awaited him. He spread his wings wide, the leathery membranes blocking out the light for a brief moment before he folded them back against his body, the tips brushing the floor.<br />
<br />
Jason, the new minotaur, let out a bellow that shook the very rafters of the gym. The power of the beast within him was undeniable, and he reveled in the fear and awe his presence inspired. His cock, now as thick and veiny as the rest of him, swung heavily between his legs with each step. Marquez the dragon took a deep breath, feeling the flames of his newfound power flicker to life in his chest. He knew that with one fiery breath, he could turn this entire town to ash if desired. Yet, as he looked around at his friends, he felt a sense of belonging that he had never experienced before. His golden eyes softened as he took in the sight of them all.<br />
<br />
Randy, the satyr, felt a strange mix of excitement and trepidation. His new form was unlike anything he could have ever dreamed of, and the way the crowd had accepted him filled him with a newfound confidence. He knew that with his power, he could bring joy and wonder to the people of Ivory. Max, the kitsune, twirled around the gym floor, his tail wagging happily. The fox-spirit felt a mischievous energy within him that was both thrilling and terrifying. He knew could charm anyone with a flash of his fluffy tail or a seductive smile, and he was eager to explore the limits of his new abilities.<br />
<br />
Ethan, the <b class="highlight">centaur</b>, stepped out of the gym and into the cool night air. His heart pounded in his chest, and he could feel the grass beneath his hooves. The world looked different through his human eyes, but his deer instincts guided him with a grace he had never known. He was a creature of legend now, and the town of Ivory had accepted him without question. The wind rushing past his face as he ran was intoxicating, and he knew he would never tire of this newfound freedom. His cock, though smaller than Randy&#39;s, still had the power to stir passion in anyone he desired.<br />
<br />
Aiden, the vampire with wings, reveled in the shadows. He had always felt like an outsider, but now he owned the night. The town had become a playground for his kind, and the people of Ivory had come to accept the nocturnal prowls of their new, mythical neighbors. His fangs glinted in the moonlight as he watched over the town, protecting it from any harm that might come its way. He had discovered that his bite could give others a taste of his power, and he used it sparingly, granting strength and speed to those who sought his favor.<br />
<br />
Jason, the minotaur, found solace in the town&#39;s abandoned gym. The scent of his cum still lingered in the air, a reminder of the power that had transformed him. He had become the school&#39;s unofficial protector, using his brute strength to maintain peace and order. The students looked up to him, and the faculty had even allowed him to design his own PE curriculum, which included obstacle courses that tested their new abilities to the limit. His massive cock had become a symbol of his might, and the school had even painted it on their mascot to embody their new spirit.<br />
<br />
Marquez, the dragon, had discovered a love for knowledge. He spent hours in the library, his scaly tail swishing as he perused the ancient tomes. His new golden eyes devoured the words on the pages, and the librarians were more than happy to help him, seeing his thirst for learning as a breath of fresh air in the otherwise mundane tasks of their daily lives. The townspeople had come to accept him as one of their own, often bringing him gifts of gold and jewels, which he graciously accepted but never used. The power of the dragon was not one to be taken lightly, and he knew it was his responsibility to use it for the betterment of Ivory.<br />
<br />
Max was the mischievous one of the group. His kitsune nature was a perfect fit for the school&#39;s prankster reputation. He had the uncanny ability to sneak into places he wasn&#39;t supposed to and leave little surprises for the unsuspecting students and teachers. His fox tail would wag with delight as he watched the chaos unfold from afar. Yet, beneath his playful exterior, he had a kind heart and always made sure his pranks were harmless, bringing a smile to everyone&#39;s face in the end.</p>
