<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim had doubts about a secret admirer.  It was probably a trick.  Who liked him?  Who cared about him.  Who even noticed him?<br />
<br />
The only reason someone would take notice would be if they were planning on having fun at his expense.  Even so, he looked over the clothes.  Cargo pants and a black t-shirt.  Bright abstract art on the shirt that was meant to look like something that a graffiti artist might make.  A flannel shirt.  He wasn&#39;t making sense of it until he found the skate pads.<br />
<br />
This was exactly the kind of outfit a skate boarder would wear.  Not a rich one, but not a poser either.<br />
<br />
Mass produced, maybe even marketed to the demographic, but not niche enough to be expensive.  The sort of thing you&#39;d get if you liked the look but didn&#39;t have money to burn and cared more about skating than perfecting the skater look.<br />
<br />
Jim looked around quickly.  Who knew that he wanted to be a skater?  Everyone would laugh at him if he even tried.  He could never pull off the look, and he couldn&#39;t actually skate either.  He didn&#39;t even have a board of his own.<br />
<br />
Still...<br />
<br />
It was a fantasy-- well part of a fantasy.<br />
<br />
He took the bundle of clothes to a nearby restroom, single stalled.  He didn&#39;t want anyone seeing when he tried them on.  That&#39;s all he&#39;d do.  Try them on.  Then he&#39;d take them back off, change into his normal clothes, and leave school.<br />
<br />
His body tingled with excitement as he pulled on the cargo pants, his own jeans discarded in a lump.  The t-shirt came next, his own thrown on top of his pants.  The baggy flannel shirt --it was probably a size too large for him-- he tied around his waist.  Skate pads were last, of course.<br />
<br />
He modeled in the look in front of the restroom mirror.  And he felt sad.  What he really wanted was to be a skater _girl_.  This was only part of it, and somehow being part way there was worse than being nowhere near there.<br />
<br />
But just before he turned around in despair, he realized that he might be able to pull of a girl&#39;s look.<br />
<br />
Sure, he&#39;d be a flat chested girl, but there was ... something.  He detected a hint of femininity in the mirror.  How had he not seen it before?<br />
<br />
Jim struck a few poses and with each he felt more confident and more feminine.  Hell, if he posed just like so it almost looked like he had--<br />
<br />
He had breasts!  Small ones.  He wasn&#39;t even sure if they were big enough to be A-cups, but they were there.  They definitely hadn&#39;t been when he&#39;d been half naked as he changed into the shirt.<br />
<br />
How could he have breasts?  It wasn&#39;t possible.  And yet...<br />
<br />
Jim noticed more changes.  The curve of his jaw, the cut of his hair.<br />
<br />
What about--?  Jims eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
She looked down to confirm what a quick check had told her.  She was a she.<br />
<br />
Her underwear had changed too.  It was now simple white bikini style panties.  And she realized she was wearing a bra.<br />
<br />
Thoughts rushed through her head: How was this possible?  What would she tell mom?  What would the other kids in school think?<br />
<br />
But she tossed them aside.  At the moment she didn&#39;t care.  It was a dream come true.  She&#39;d face whatever problems there were when she came to them.<br />
<br />
She did wonder if there might be more changes to come.<br />
<br />
None did.  She was a relatively plain girl.  No one would ever notice her in a crowd, but she looked good enough, in her own opinion, and now that she wasn&#39;t hiding who she wanted to be, and her acne had disappeared, maybe she&#39;d be able to attract a nice girl.  New muscles reacted to that thought.  Girls.  She was going to be a very happy lesbian, she was sure of it.<br />
<br />
She stepped out of the restroom without even glancing at her old clothes.  If she had looked she&#39;d have noticed that they&#39;d disappeared.<br />
<br />
When she walked away from the restroom someone behind her asked, &quot;Forget your board?&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned around to see Angela, a girl in her grade.  Angela had her own skate board attached to her backpack, and was holding out a black one with hot pink detailing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen that before,&quot; Jim stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Angela said.  &quot;But it&#39;s yours now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait ...&quot; Jim said.  &quot;You know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I&#39;m not your _secret_ admirer anymore,&quot; Angela said as though she&#39;d been caught doing something wrong.  &quot;But I called it right, yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Angela gestured to Jim&#39;s entire body, &quot;You like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like,&quot; Jim said.  She couldn&#39;t keep from grinning.  She liked very much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s get out of here,&quot; Angela told Jim, and led her down the hall.  Angela got out her skateboard as she walked and soon was skating down the hall.<br />
<br />
Jim paused to pick up her backpack, homework wouldn&#39;t take a holiday no matter how strange things got, hopped on her own, brand new, board, and followed Angela out of the school.  A teacher yelled, &quot;No skating in school!&quot; after them, but it hardly mattered.  The teacher didn&#39;t know them.  There would be no punishment.<br />
<br />
Jim noticed that her new body had much better balance and coordination.  She wouldn&#39;t be a pro skater, but she could probably be sure no one would laugh at her.  Now she just needed a new name.</p>
