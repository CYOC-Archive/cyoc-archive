<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the party raged on, Andy the whiteboard was getting his use. He loved the feeling of his penis marker being used on his chest and the feeling of cumming ink on himself over and over was just incredible. He was wrong about everything with this hazing. He loved it so much, he wished he could stay like that forever. As the party died down, the other brothers either went to bed with someone or had passed out. This gave the object boys some time to think about the night. When everyone woke up in the morning, they knew they had to take the boys back to be turned back into people. When they got to Andy the whiteboard, they asked how it was. He said &quot;it was truly amazing. I loved the feeling of all of this! I love being an object and having my penis used like that! I would give anything to stay an ever feeling inanimate whiteboard forever!&quot; The brothers looked at each other and said &quot;Andy, you&#39;re not the first one to ask to stay your inanimate for forever. A few of our brothers have opted to stay the objects they were turned into. The statue out in front of the house is one of those cases. He was the star quarterback in his high school and decided to rush here. Much like you, he hated the idea of being transformed. He was flattened, then filled with marble. When people came up and admired him and stroked his cock however, he quickly sang a different tune. Permanently hard and admired is how he wanted to live out the rest of his life. We gave him a supplement that made him unable to be flattened again. He still says he loves his life as an admired statue, and we think you&#39;ll feel the same way.&quot; Andy was amazed and in awe. He loved the idea that he&#39;d be unable to change back, never having to worry about anything except being an object. He quickly said &quot;I want it! I want the supplement! I never ever want to be a person again, just your object!&quot; The brothers responded &quot;we will get the supplement for you when your rush brothers come back from being changed back. You&#39;ll have to wait until then.&quot; Andy hated the fact he had to wait. He wanted to make this self his permanent self as quickly as possible. He could have cum just thinking about it if his balls marker cap hadn&#39;t been covering the head of his penis. When his friends returned, they were shocked Andy was still on the wall. When the brothers explained the situation, all of his friends were in shock. They couldn&#39;t believe anybody would want to never even have the option to turn back. However the time quickly came to make it permanent. The supplement was brought in and Andy became very excited very quickly. The brothers removed his balls cap and put it on the back end of his marker penis, leaving the head open. They then told Andy the process. &quot;Andy, we&#39;re going to give you the supplement orally. You&#39;ll feel yourself getting more and more horny. That means it&#39;s working. You&#39;ll feel as though you&#39;re being masturbated by 1000 hands. Finally, your mind will fog up. You will feel your brains draining and your thoughts only replaced with those of horniness and trying to get to orgasm as much as possible. When you cum, the change will be permanent. Those thoughts, your whiteboard chest, the marker penis and cap balls. You will always be happy, horny, stupid, and submissive. Are you sure you want to continue on with this?&quot; Andy just looked at his friends who looked shocked, then he looked at the brother with the supplement and said &quot;hell yea I want to continue on with this! Permanent hornniness and happiness? Sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me!&quot; The brothers then gave Andy the supplement. Andy gave a face of disgust, then said &quot;when will I start feeling the ef- ooohhhhhhh I feel it now.&quot; He was starting to feel incredibly horny. He started to feel like his penis was being rubbed, then the hands rubbing it kept adding. His head was feeling it greatly. He said &quot;it feels sooooo good. Whoever&#39;s rubbing it, keep at it!&quot; One of the brothers replied &quot;nobody is rubbing it. That&#39;s just the drug!&quot; Andy moaned in pleasure as the feelings intended. Then he felt his thoughts fog up. He felt all his smarts drain away. He still had all his memories, but his thoughts and free will were replaced with feelings of happiness, horniness, and submissiveness. He could feel his penis getting closer and closer. Suddenly, it burst into orgasm. He moaned in pleasure as ink squired out of the pen onto the table it was sitting on. In the ink was his free will and his intelligence. He no longer needed either of those as he would be happier and hornier without them. Andy knew he&#39;d love his new life as a whiteboard. That&#39;s all he needed now. He just needed people to write with his penis on his chest. If he had that forever, he was now happy.</p>
