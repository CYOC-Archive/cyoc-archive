<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate Anderson awoke to the sound of birds greeting a new dawn.<br />
Dazed and confused, he looked around to get his bearings and realized he was within the tent he was temporarily sharing with his boyfriend Alex Ramsey while they were on their camping trip near the shores of Moon Lake&#39;s namesake.<br />
Wanting privacy after eating the last of the S&#39;mores for Friday night, the young lovers had retired inside after the campfire was taken care of, anxious to be with each other.<br />
At first, it was slow and sweet, as both stayed in their human forms and intimately enjoyed each other&#39;s company.<br />
But as the night and their passions grew, both had shifted into their werewolf fursonas for a howling good time, pun intended.<br />
As Nate stared at the dashing lupine form sleeping in his arms, now more than ever confirmed the fact that they would be together forever in his heart, mind, and soul; and heaven help whatever might be foolish enough to attempt tearing them apart.<br />
With that, Nate moved his head just long enough to kiss his lover&#39;s muzzle on the tip of its nose, and then happily fell back asleep in Alex&#39;s paws.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Martha Anderson awoke with a start. Werecat senses ever alert, she quickly identified the sound of the morning newspaper landing on their front porch as the source of the disturbance, but needed to wake up her sleeping husband so he could explain why, &quot;Honey, why are we under the dining room table?&quot;<br />
William Anderson lazily opened one vulpine eye as a smile crossed his werefox muzzle. &quot;We successfully defended Fort Libido the only way we knew how. Didn&#39;t you ever have forts when you were a kid?&quot; he asked, leaning forward to kiss his wife.<br />
&quot;With just a sister, it was more dress up and tea parties for me,&quot; she replied, nuzzling her furry body against his soft pelt.<br />
&quot;Anyway, after the kids left, you stripped right in the middle of the living room, demanding I take you right then and there, which started our wild sex tour of the house,&quot; William reminded her, while massaging Martha&#39;s breasts.<br />
&quot;Yessss,&quot; pleasurably hissed Martha, as much from recalling the wonderful events of last night as enjoying current events. &quot;I&#39;ve heard of it done before, but never really knew how... invigorating riding an active washer or dryer could be while having sex.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, the werefox within me knows plenty of things to show my sexy kitten a good time,&quot; cooed William, while nuzzling Martha&#39;s furry neck.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all well and good,&quot; said Martha, suddenly pulling away from him before crawling out from under the table, &quot;but right now I want a nice soft mattress to rest on,&quot; she added, stopping only to pick up her dress where it was discarded last night before reaching the main staircase.<br />
Then she turned back to look at the dining room table and asked, &quot;Aren&#39;t you coming? I said I wanted a nice soft mattress. I didn&#39;t say the wild sex was over,&quot; she purred.<br />
As the werefox scampered out from under the table to be with its mate, William saw Martha seductively shake her rear as her tail sexily swished back and forth even as she slowly sauntered upstairs.<br />
<br />
NEXT DOOR...<br />
Just like going to bed, Doctor Frances Twist awoke in her favorite position: nestled within the loving arms of her wife Samantha. Only taking a quick glance at the clock radio to see it wasn&#39;t even 7 yet, Frances knew the alarm was set for 7:30 and she didn&#39;t have to be at the police station until 10 for her final meeting with Yvette Smith, and the prearranged introduction of the rogue werevixen to her biological father, who also happened to be her biological uncle too.<br />
Frances nuzzled close to Samantha, purring in time and happy contentment with the beating of her wife&#39;s heart. She had almost drifted back to sleep when Samantha&#39;s cellphone started ringing.<br />
Samantha bitched like a sailor as she groggily reached out for the offending device on her nightstand, but was all business by the time she pressed the answer button and said &quot;Hello.&quot;<br />
&quot;Konichiwa, Mrs. Twist. This is Daisuke Tachibana on behalf of my grandmother,&quot; said the voice on the other end, more alert and conscious than Samantha privately thought anyone had a right to be at this hour. &quot;There has been a new development in the Jennifer Harper situation. We have confirmed the presence of an agent working for Dieter Wilhelm in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
Samantha sat up, instantly alert herself and asked &quot;What&#39;s the sitch?&quot; not caring that she was quoting one of her favorite lines from the last cartoon series she watched with Ben.<br />
Frances sat up as acute werecat hearing allowed her to listen to the story about the man trying to gain access to Jenny&#39;s dorm room last night by pretending to be her brother.<br />
Samantha turned to look at Frances as she asked &quot;When and where would you like to meet to discuss revising our strategy in light of this new development?&quot;<br />
Knowing that look in her wife&#39;s eyes, Frances thought for a moment and then mouthed the word &quot;Harry&#39;s&quot;, to answer the unspoken question of where Jennifer Harper might be right now.<br />
&quot;We seem to be having trouble contacting Police Chief O&#39;Hara at the moment, otherwise, wherever is most convenient for you,&quot; answered Daisuke.<br />
&quot;He said something about being with his grandkids today. Otherwise, that conference room we used last time in about an hour?&quot; wondered Samantha.<br />
There was a slight pause. &quot;That is acceptable. We shall meet you there,&quot; replied Daisuke, before ending the call.<br />
Frances gave Samantha a peck on the cheek before saying, &quot;I&#39;ll go make coffee.&quot;<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE....<br />
Unaware of new developments, Harry Jenkins awoke about 3 am to discover himself lying on the floor, curled up against his beautiful fiance Jenny Harper; after giving her an all body massage that helped ease her nervous tensions.<br />
Not knowing how his parents would react in the morning to finding a pair of werefoxes asleep on their living room floor, Harry gathered up all their things and took them to his bedroom. Then he came back for Jenny.<br />
&quot;Why did you have to wake me?&quot; she groggily asked, as Harry helped her off the floor. &quot;I dreamt we got married and lived happily fur ever after,&quot; she said, not noticing the unintentional pun in the way she made her statement.<br />
&quot;That dream is going to come true soon enough my love,&quot; promised Harry, while rubbing his vulpine muzzle against hers. &quot;Now let&#39;s go back to bed and see how it turns out,&quot; he suggested, leading her to his bedroom.<br />
<br />
HOURS LATER...<br />
After new strategies were formed and plans enacted to ensure not only the safety of Jennifer Harper and the town of Moon Lake while keeping an eye on unwanted henchman Mark Wilson; Julie Stovall started to stir within the arms of her boyfriend/fiance Eric Anderson.<br />
In were-mer society (which Eric recently and happily joined to be with Julie) their engagement and future marriage was just a question of formally setting a date. To Eric&#39;s family and those not knowledgeable in were-mer traditions, Eric had yet to officially &quot;pop the question&quot; as far as they knew, but the single pearl necklace Julie wore proudly around her neck said otherwise.<br />
As Julie started returning to consciousness, she took great comfort in feeling Eric&#39;s presence by her side. There was no resisting the urge to tenderly kiss him before laying her head across his chest, hearing Eric&#39;s heart beat like it was her favorite tune of all time.<br />
But then Julie had this lingering doubt that something was wrong.<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Junior?&quot; she asked, looking around for her missing son.<br />
&quot;Waiting for us in the future darling,&quot; promised Eric, before kissing his lady love. &quot;Him and our daughter Melinda,&quot; he said with a smile.<br />
&quot;OUR—&quot; then Julie reached down to feel that she currently wasn&#39;t 8 and a half months pregnant with their second child.<br />
<i>The dream link between us is as strong as ever, just as it should be between committed soul mate mers,</i> she realized, before wrapping her arms around Eric and hugging him. <i>But I better make sure to stay on my were-mermaid birth control pills so I don&#39;t inadvertently mess that future up,</i> realized Julie, promising herself she would take today&#39;s when she went upstairs to change clothes before breakfast.</p>
