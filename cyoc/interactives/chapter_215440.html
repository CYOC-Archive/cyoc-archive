<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you pulled into the strip mall parking lot, you saw the store right where you left it.  To be honest, you expected that a store selling magical items would up and vanish the moment you drove off, but the fact that it was still here was an unexpected relief.<br />
<br />
You got out of the car first, then watched as the suspension rocked back and forth when ‘Stan’ stepped out.  It made you appreciate just how enormous his new body was, and while you had no idea how much he weighed, it was obviously significantly more than a human.<br />
<br />
You opened the door and walked inside, still holding the Moo’noculars in hand, only to see another customer finish paying for an item at the cash register.  As soon as you realized what was going on, your heart sank and you stopped dead in your tracks – was he buying a similar magical item that he could use on you?<br />
<br />
You could feel your arms instinctively trying to bring the Moon’noculars to your eyes in an attempt to gaze at him before he could do anything to you.  But then you looked down at his hands and saw that whatever he bought was still inside of the box, causing your hands to relax back at your side.  Walking up behind him, you looked more closely and saw a picture of pair of binoculars that looked quite similar to your own, with the name “Alli’goggles” written in green, scale patterned letters.<br />
<br />
“Be careful with those,” you said, “they really work.”<br />
<br />
Turning around, the man’s eyes fixed directly on Stan.  Or, to be more specific, on the massive balls swaying between Stan’s legs.  <br />
<br />
“You don’t say…” he uttered in stupefied amazement.<br />
<br />
“That’s what happened when my sister looked at herself.  Like I said, be careful.”<br />
<br />
“I will,” he muttered, clutching the Alli’goggles box to his chest.<br />
<br />
As the man walked towards the doors, the store’s clerk looked up and said, “enjoying your new product I see?”<br />
<br />
“Of course not!” you exclaim, pointing at Stan, “it turned my sister into that!”<br />
<br />
“You mean me boss?” Stan said.<br />
<br />
You ignored her and sighed, “I’m assuming the changes are permanent?”<br />
<br />
“Oh very much so,” the clerk replied.<br />
<br />
“So what happens now that my farm already has a bull?  If I look at myself, do I end up as a bull too?”<br />
<br />
“I can’t say,” the clerk shrugged, “I’ve never had a customer let someone else use their product before.  If you do happen to look at yourself in a mirror, please come back and let me know what happened.  I’d be very curious.”<br />
<br />
“So what do these things do?  Supposedly I own a farm now, are these things just building out that farm?  And what about the cows, they were producing milk, does that mean they’re all pregnant?  What do I do with the calves?”<br />
<br />
“So many questions…” the clerk trailed off, “well I just sell the things, I’m no expert in them.  But from past experience, the subjects that the customer chooses to make don’t become pregnant until the customer looks at themselves through the product.  If they weren’t noticeably pregnant before, I suspect that you’d find them to be so now – and more productive milkers as well.”  <br />
<br />
“As to what you do with the calves,” the clerk continued, “that’s up to you.  Sometimes the customer sells them off, sometimes they raise them as an addition to their harem.  Given that your product creates cow-girls, it may be more profitable to simply milk them, but you’ll have to figure that out for yourself.”<br />
<br />
Great.  If the clerk was right, you were probably going to return to the farm to find Jacklyn and Billie sitting there with gigantic bellies and overfilled udders.  You needed to wrap this up and get back to the farm, but you still had a few last things you wanted to know.<br />
<br />
“So what does-“ you began to ask another question, only to be cut off from a loud shout outside.<br />
<br />
“Wow, they really do work!” <br />
<br />
You turned towards the door, only to see the other customer standing there, back to you, as he stood propping open the door, staring at a large anthropomorphic alligator through his goggles.<br />
<br />
It was about six feet tall, with a thick tail dragging on the ground behind it and dark green scales that shifted to a creamy white along its chest and stomach.  Its wide muzzle was hanging open, showing off the thick fangs that filled its mouth.  <br />
<br />
Then you realized that it didn’t look particularly feminine – unlike your cows, whose bodies had a typical feminine shape and fatty appearance, the alligator had an androgenous but muscular shape to its body.  Its chest was completely flat and there were no external genitalia to speak of, though if you looked closely you thought you could see a thin dark line in the scales leading to its underside.  <br />
<br />
You vaguely remembered that reptiles had internal penises, so did that mean that the Alli’goggles turned its subjects into men?  Then again, reptiles also didn’t have breasts, so did that mean that this androgenous look was what a female anthropomorphic alligator looked like?<br />
<br />
The alligator began to jog towards the store and waived a clawed, green scaled hand, shouting “coming master” in a deep, raspy, but otherwise androgenous voice.<br />
<br />
But you didn’t have time to ponder the alligator’s fate anymore, as you saw the other customer begin to turn around towards the interior of the store, Alli’goggles still pressed up against his face.<br />
<br />
Your heart raced and you franticly glanced around, looking for somewhere to hide.  Next to you, the clerk had also seen what was happening and ducked behind the counter, out of sight of the other customer.  But there was no way you’d be able to jump over it in time, and there was nowhere else in the store to hide.<br />
<br />
The other customer kept turning.  He was approaching a 90 degree angle towards you when you realized that you were holding the key to your salvation in hand – the Moo’noculars.  Like lightning, your hands raced up to your face, desperate to press them up against your eyes before the other customer could look you.<br />
<br />
He was now looking 80 degrees to the side as your own Moo’noculars raised up to your chest.  70 degrees, the Moo’noculars passed your neck.  60 degrees, the Moo’noculars edged past your nose.  50 degrees – he was so close, you were almost in his field of view.<br />
<br />
You saw the rubber eyepiece of the Moo’noculars pass up into your vision.  You pressed them up against your eyes as hard as you can, and stared straight at the cow in front of you.<br />
<br />
Her fur had a pattern of creamy white, blotched with large spots of midnight black.  Her belly was bloated out, filled with a calf that looked almost too big for her body.  And attached to the bottom of that stomach, dangling down between her legs, was a huge red udder.  On its surface ran a pulsating vein, pressed tightly against her skin by the reservoir of milk sloshing around behind it.<br />
<br />
Then you looked up at her head – she had short, blunt horns and the same thick, cow-like muzzle as the other girls had.  But then you realized that what you were looking at as your own doom - she was still holding the Alli’goggles to her eyes, still turning towards you.<br />
<br />
Oh no!  You’d turned her into a cow, but all that had done was to turn her into a cowgirl who was still looking through the Alli’goggles.  Nothing you had done was going to stop her from looking at you!<br />
<br />
40 degrees.  <br />
<br />
What do you do?  Your heart was beating so hard that it felt like it would leap up out of your throat.  You tried to think of a solution, of a way out, but nothing came to mind.  There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.  <br />
<br />
35 degrees.  <br />
<br />
Your new cowgirl maintained her inexorable turn towards you.  You took a deep breath, swallowed hard, and opened your mouth to yell at her.</p>
