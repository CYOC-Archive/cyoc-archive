<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike looked down to see a muscular tiger body staring at him. He was currently naked and sitting down. During the merge the three had fallen on to the bench in front of the exhibit. Mike felt dazed and confused, unable to completely remember the recents events that transpired. It was a bit hazy to make out. He remember coming to the zoo with Josh and…<br />
<br />
“Wait! Josh!” Mike thought as he turned to look for him. Questions could wait, he had to find Josh. Mike turned his head to the left to see a tiger head with his eyes closed. Alarmed and confused, Mike turned to his right to see an identical tiger head.<br />
<br />
Mike had no idea what was going on. He remember that one second he had felt a strange sensation and the next he had stripped naked and began making out with his son. At the realization of this memory, Mike felt his face warm up from embarrassment despite his fur easily hiding it.<br />
<br />
“Wait… what fur?” He wondered as a slight shudder coursed through his body.<br />
<br />
Mike pulled his muscular tiger arms up to feel his face. Instead of his usual human face, he felt a soft texture of fur instead. Panic filled Mike as he confirmed his thoughts with a touch to his nose. The texture was different, smooth and a different shape, not anything like a human. His fingers brushed past his whiskers as he felt his mouth. More appropriately muzzle as he confirmed the shape and recognized his whiskers. Pulling on them to confirm them, Mike’s triangular ears twitched on the top of his head, as he heard a slight groan. He looked to his left to find the noise’s source, to see the tiger head opening his eyes.<br />
<br />
“What happened? Where am I?” He said in a deep and alluring voice.<br />
<br />
Mike felt a sudden loss of control of his left arm as it gravitated toward the awakened head and held his hand er… paw to his head.<br />
<br />
“I’d like to know the same thing.” Mike asked him, realizing his voice sounded identical to the voice he had just heard.<br />
<br />
“Listen, I was just on my phone and at this lame zoo when…” he began to explain.<br />
<br />
“Wait it couldn’t be!” Mike thought as he turned and made eye contact with the tiger.<br />
<br />
“Josh is that you?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… how did you know?” He asked in a scared tone.<br />
<br />
“It’s me Mike! … Your dad!”<br />
<br />
Josh’s yellows eyes bulged as he looked at his dad, now the middle tiger head on his new body. “Dad! Is that really you?” Josh exclaimed. <br />
<br />
Mike nodded his tiger head yes.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on? What’s happening?” Josh asked, fear rising in his voice.<br />
<br />
“Settle down son.” Mike told him and used his right paw, which he still had control over, to gesture him a calm down motion. “I’m trying to also figure that out.”<br />
<br />
“I remember you touching me, feeling super horny, and then doing…” Josh began before gagging in disgust. “Some NASTY stuff with you before something jumped at us.”<br />
<br />
“That’s exactly what I remember. Everything else after that is a blur. I don’t think I got a good look at what got us.”<br />
<br />
“Are you talking about me?”<br />
<br />
Josh and Mike turned their heads to see the right tiger head, fully awake, and staring at the two.<br />
<br />
“Who are you?” Mike asked him, confused at his sudden awakening.<br />
<br />
“And what do you mean?” Josh asked angrily, beginning to feel suspicious.<br />
<br />
“Oh. I was the tiger in that poor excuse of an exhibit.” <br />
<br />
Mike feels himself lose control of his right arm as the third head pointed toward the small gated habitat.<br />
<br />
“Wait you’re the tiger from the exhibit… How can you talk? Why did you lunge at us? And more importantly… do you know what’s going on?” Josh questioned him.<br />
<br />
The tiger closed his eyes in deep thought before opening them and answering his questions. “I just had a sudden increase in knowledge and just know that I am now able to properly converse. I’m not sure, I just had the sudden feeling to join you two. And… no.”<br />
<br />
“Well that’s just great. I seemed to have lost my mind and am currently imagining myself as some sort of tiger man with three heads. One controlled by my dad and the other a tiger.” Josh dropped his head, dejected.<br />
<br />
“The name’s Michael.” The tiger said. “And we’re all tigers now if you think about it.”<br />
<br />
“Name’s Mike Evans Sr.” Mike told him. “The guy on the left is my son Mike Evans Jr. but he goes by his middle name Josh.”<br />
<br />
“Wait a minute… I just realized something.” Mike said.<br />
<br />
“What?” Josh asked desperately, perhaps hoping his father had figured out a solution.<br />
<br />
“We’re also all technically named Mike.” He said as he began to laugh. It sounded much richer in his deeper voice.<br />
<br />
Michael also chuckles at this bit of information while Josh frowns. He could do without his dad’s lame sense of humor.<br />
<br />
“Dad maybe we should try to figure something that could help us instead of focusing on your shitty jokes.” Josh complained.<br />
<br />
“Sorry son, couldn’t resist.” Mike said with a grin. “But I guess we should head home. We’ll probably be more safe there and also be able to figure out a solution. Honestly I’m surprised no one’s even noticed us yet.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not. This lame ass zoo barely had anyone to begin with.” Josh responded. Looking around, there were no other humans to be seen. “But you’re right. We can’t spend all day here and get spotted. We have to go back home.”<br />
<br />
Josh tried to stand up but found he no longer retained the ability to do so.<br />
<br />
“I-I-I-I can’t stand up!” He shouted.<br />
<br />
Michael also tried and found he couldn’t lift himself up onto his legs either. “Likewise.” He said.<br />
<br />
Mike attempted and easily found himself getting up as he balanced his new body on his legs. Luckily his legs were also muscular and built to carry his new physique.<br />
<br />
“Wait how did you do that?” Josh asked.<br />
<br />
“I kinda just figured this out now but I think we all have a small sense of control over our body.” Mike explained. “I can’t control the left or right arm but am able to control both of our legs.”<br />
<br />
Josh tried to move his right arm and found he had no access to it. The same could be said for Michael.<br />
<br />
Josh told his body to move forward but it didn’t respond. His dad was right. They could all only control a specific set of limbs.<br />
<br />
“Actually I was able to control my left and right earlier when you two were unconscious but we can figure that out later.” Mike said as he began to move them to the exit and the parking lot.<br />
<br />
The three of them felt the wind brush on their body as they walked naked throughout the zoo. Mike and Josh noticed this extra breeze down below while Michael did not.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe I’m just noticing this but we’re naked.” Josh said.<br />
<br />
“I know. What about it?” Michael responded, unbothered.<br />
<br />
“We can’t be walking around just naked and showing “that” everywhere!” Josh spouted and pointed to their cock. Their large and hairy feline cock was currently in its sheath and hung down at an impressive length, laying on top of their large tennis-sized fur covered balls.<br />
<br />
“Why not? It’s not a big deal to be seen in your natural state.” Michael told him, trying to reason with him.<br />
<br />
“I mean… Josh kinda has a point.” Mike said, embarrassed at his impressive new equipment, out on full display. “But… we’re a large 8 foot muscular tiger man with three heads. I don’t think there’s any reason to prioritize our nudity at the moment.”<br />
<br />
“Fine.” Josh rolled his eyes. “So how are we getting home?”</p>
