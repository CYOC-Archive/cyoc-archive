<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh picked up a vial and glanced at it, noting it's bright, almost neon pink color. He swirled it around a bit, seeing if there was any kind of foaming effect or dirt floating in the water. After several seconds he set it down on the counter, seeing nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I doing,&quot; he said to himself as he looked over the vial. &quot;It's probably just some fruity colored water that he got duped into buying.&quot; Grabbing the vial again, he uncorked it and smelt the contents. Just as he suspected, there was no smell at all, not a fruity smell or anything. Shrugging his shoulders, he downed the vial in two or three gulps, surprised by the large amount of liquid contained in the vial. He smacked his lips and shook his head. &quot;Just some color water. Not even fruity tasting.&quot; He placed the cork back on the vial and put it in the container, ignoring the others before heading back upstairs. He didn't notice as the vial he just drank slowly began to refill itself with more of the neon pink liquid.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, Josh found he just couldn't concentrate on the chemistry book he was trying to read. He felt as if he had an itch in the back of his head that he just couldn't scratch. Sighing and closing his book in frustration he walked over to the kitchen to forage for some food. As he reached the kitchen, he paused for a moment, glancing at the cabinet over the sink. &quot;That's funny,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;I could have sworn that cabinet hung down lower. Shrugging his shoulders, he brushed his hair out of his eyes and headed towards the refrigerator. He had taken no more than two steps when he realized the problem.<br />
<br />
His hair had never been long enough to hang in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Josh turned towards a small mirror that hung on the wall and glanced at his head. Much to his shock, his hair was now shoulder length...and growing even longer, and lighter as the minutes progressed. Josh began to breath heavily and rushed towards the bathroom to get a closer look. Sure enough, the mirror in the bath room told the same story. As he hair continued to lengthen, Josh felt a rising heat growing in his body. He nearly ripped his shirt off his body to allieviate the sweat he was going through, and was shocked by what he found. The rug of hair that had once adorned his chest was now sparse, and growing fainter by the moment. He glanced at his arms and saw the same thing happening, and watched in shocked silence as his fingernails began to grow out and taper off at the end. <br />
<br />
Finally there was a sharp cracking sound and a rush of pain as his bones began to contort and twist in his body. Josh screamed in pain as he felt his hips crack outward and his spine crack inward, forcing his chest out in an uncomfortable position. His screams became a higher pitch as the moments progressed forward, and he felt a sensation of his skin crawling as his muscles tensed and relaxed, giving his entire body a fit, but svelte look. As the pain subsided, he looked into the mirror, almost screaming again at what he saw. All of his body fat seemed to have been reduced, but his abs that he had worked all summer on were gone, replaced with the finely toned smooth skin he found all over his body. His arms were thinner, and his legs appeared to be far longer. Even his ass had expanded outward into a feminine heart shape. But it was in his face he could feel the most change, with higher cheek bones, smaller chin, and large bright blue eyes that were framed by a blonde halo of hair that hung down to the small of his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...wha...&quot; Josh stopped himself from talking when he heard the high soprano of his voice. Feeling a stirring in his groin, he immediately removed his boxer shorts and checked on his dick. To his horror, he found it much smaller than it had been before, and growing even smaller. He frantically grabbed at it, as if trying to make it stop shrinking, but it was to no avail. He had no sooner grabbed it then it finished pulling up inside him. Josh felt his insides churning even as he felt his wayward hand slowly sink inside of him his newfound female genitalia formed. Stunned into silence, Josh slipped a finger inside himself almost as an experiment, and quickly recoiled from the sensation. In a few moments though, Josh began to probe once more, as pleasure began to course through his body. He moaned as his other hand began to tweak at his nipples, which were growing larger and puffier with each second. His ministrations became much more rushed and frantic, as with each breath, mounds of flesh began to push out of his chest. Finally, after a minute or so, Josh let out a loud, feminine, shuddered gasp of pleasure as her breasts finished forming into a rather large D-cup at the end of her first female orgasm.<br />
<br />
As Josh came down from her orgasmic high, she took stock of what had happened. Somehow, she had transformed into this beautiful woman in a matter of moments...when the idea quickly came to her. The vial of liquid! That had to be it!<br />
<br />
The question was, what could she do about it. Glancing up at the clock on the wall, she knew that Eric would be home any minute, if he wasn't already home anyway. Josh quickly had to decide what to do.</p>
