<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I really was quite pretty&quot; mused Maureen to Ted as they gazed at an embarrassed Eric returning to his seat at the table. Eric was trying to console himself that he would only have this pretty face for one night, well more like one day. When he woke up tomorrow morning he would be himself once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you really were the girl who met us at the door yesterday? I really didn&#39;t believe you. That girl was quite a honey&quot; said Ted to Eric  &quot;Who were the other girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were who they said they were, Amy, Jen and Nikki&quot; replied Mike in his mother&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;And did you really go out to a night club? As a woman? I don&#39;t think I would have the guts to do that&quot; Ted continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I had no choice. I was too embarrassed to tell you who I was. And the other girls wanted to go out. I didn&#39;t want to be alone&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be embarrassed dear&quot; cut in Maureen. &quot;I always wished I had a daughter&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look more like sisters than mother and daughter at the moment. You both could be my daughters though&quot; said Ted who seemed to be enjoying Eric&#39;s embarrassment<br />
<br />
&quot;The game isn&#39;t over yet. There are still a lot of black squares between you and the finish. We could end up being triplets&quot; Eric pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m really enjoying the game. I just hope I get to lose this weight&quot; mused Maureen &quot;It&#39;s my turn. I&#39;m going to toss&quot; She did toss and landed on a black square only 7 spots from the finish. The usual card turned over and Maureen tossed a second time. There were no obvious changes. <br />
<br />
&quot;What changed&quot; asked Ted<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing that I can see&quot; said a disappointed Maureen. Who was feeling her body &quot;I&#39;m still fat&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may have got one of your own features&quot; pointed out Eric<br />
<br />
&quot;Pass the dice. It&#39;s my turn&quot; said Ted<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wait. That&#39;s different. Where did these come from?&quot; said Maureen. She then proceeded to lift up her skirt in front of Ted and Eric. She revealed pink panties, Identical in design to Nikki&#39;s pair that Eric was wearing. Eric felt himself blushing. &quot;Are you wearing pretty pink panties Eric?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you never gave me a chance to change when I got here&quot; Eric said in a quiet feminine voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why were you still wearing panties? I thought you said everything changed back in the morning&quot;  accused Ted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only the clothes I was wearing when the sun hit me. Nikki had given me  fresh pair of panties. My shoes also didn&#39;t change back they remain a copy of Nikki&#39;s shoes. These are the slippers I keep near the door&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m tossing&quot; said Ted. He did so. He also landed on black. A second toss saw Ted&#39;s chest protrude. He had developed a pair of large breasts on his chest. &quot;Oh Wow!&quot; he exclaimed in his still very masculine voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you father&#39;s dream just came true&quot; giggled Maureen &quot;Now he can play with himself and leave me alone&quot; <br />
<br />
Indeed Ted wasn&#39;t waiting for an invitation. He was cupping his new assets. &quot;These are heavy&quot; he declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why women wear bra&#39;s. I&#39;ve only bought the one I&#39;m wearing but perhaps Eric has a supply?&quot; teased Maureen.<br />
<br />
There was another delay while Ted went to the bathroom to check himself out in the mirror. Eric took the opportunity to go to his room, remove Nikki&#39;s panties and put on a pair of his own male undies. <br />
<br />
When he returned Maureen handed Eric the dice saying &quot;Your turn&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t want to&quot; Eric replied in his soft feminine voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;What actually happens if we don&#39;t continue the game&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Last night was the first time I had even seen the game. I don&#39;t remember ever buying it. It was just in my cupboard with the other games. I&#39;m scared of continuing but I&#39;m also scared of not finishing. The game does warn of consequences if it is not finished&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then Eric&#39;s mobile phone rang. He saw the call was from Amy and answered without thinking &quot;Hi Amy. What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.. Hi.... Mrs Thompson. Is Eric there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric had forgotten he now had his mother&#39;s voice. However he wasn&#39;t going to get stuck in a lie again. &quot;Umm... Well actually it&#39;s me. We are playing the game again. I&#39;ve got Mum&#39;s voice&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric could hear Amy get excited over the phone &quot;You&#39;re playing again? Why didn&#39;t you tell me? I&#39;ll be right over&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No don&#39;t. It was an accident. I didn&#39;t want to play again. Mum and Dad had started when I got back here&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m coming over. Expect Jen and Nikki as well. See you soon&quot; Eric heard the phone hang up.<br />
<br />
Eric looked across at his Mum who had overheard the conversation. &quot;I really don&#39;t want to be seen like this&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t be silly. They are your friends and they have already seen you changed. What are you worried about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted returned with a stupid grin on his face still fondling himself &quot;This is fantastic. But I do think I need a bra. Have you tossed yet Eric?&quot;<br />
<br />
The dice were in Eric&#39;s left hand. What choice did he have. He was already past the point of no return. He sat on his seat and looked at the board. 2, 4 or 8 were the only non black squares. He tossed 5 and 4 and watched as his piece moved to another black square. At least that put him close to the end. The inevitable card flipped over. Eric tossed again. Unfortunately it was a double 4. &#39;Two more changes&#39; was Eric&#39;s momentary thought. He looked at his parents to gauge their reactions. &quot;What&#39;s the damage?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your shirt has changed. It has lacy shoulders&quot; commented Ted<br />
<br />
Eric looked down. Sure enough his plain white T shirt now had lace shoulders. He immediately felt his chest and was relieved to find it still flat. &quot;I&#39;d say you clothes have been feminised&quot; said Maureen <br />
<br />
That prompted Eric to look down at his jeans. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; his jeans had changed as well. Unfortunately they were now very tight against his crotch. They had changed to woman&#39;s jeans. Being tight they revealed the shape of Eric&#39;s crotch. There was no longer a bulge. It seemed his body had been feminised as well. Eric felt her crotch in despair.</p>
