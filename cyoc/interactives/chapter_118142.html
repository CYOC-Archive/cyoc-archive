<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Climbing out of bed, Eric stretched as he shut off his alarm clock with his paw. The white furred were-panther slowly made his way to the bathroom; grabbing his bathrobe as he walk out of his somewhat messy room. In his fursona, Eric wasn’t concerned if his parents saw him naked; them being were-foxes, Eric’s parents found being nude while furry natural. Yet for Eric, he need his robe for he was about to take a shower shortly after he de-furred.<br />
<br />
It was after he had his shower and was dressed did Eric finally see his parents. Both also awake but still in their fursona’s as they sat in the kitchen with breakfast already made.<br />
“Morning son,” Martha being the first to speak; “ready for your first day back at school?”<br />
“As ready as I can be,” Eric sitting down to a plate of scrambled eggs and bacon; “I wish summer holidays lasted longer though. It felt like it went by to quick.”<br />
“It always does,” William looking thoughtful; “you just need to make the most of the time you are given.”<br />
“Is Nate going to be at school,” Eric speaking between bites of eggs; “or is he still at the hospital?”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Nate was just waking up after having to spend the night under observation. Despite his insistence that he felt fine after getting assaulted by two were-panthers; Nate passed out just before being discharged. A second examination discovered that Nate suffered a moderate concussion. Also revealed that Nate’s inner ear was also injured; causing him to lose his sense of balance, unless of course he is holding onto someone or something. Getting up from bed, Nate noticed the cane left for him and used it to help prop him up.<br />
“Oh this is so wrong,” Nate struggling to stay vertical; “a werewolf in the prime of his youth made into a cripple.”<br />
“You’ll heal,” Nate’s roommate speaking; “you get to leave the room, while I’m stuck until I have healed up enough to shift back.”<br />
<br />
Nate grunted as he slowly walked to the bathroom. His roommate; also his brother in-law is Peter Talbot. A were-lion who was shot by Daniel Parker last Friday evening; all for the mustang Peter drove. Having to walk slowly so as not to feel more dizzy than he already is currently feeling; Nate managed to make it to the bathroom so he could take his morning pee.<br />
“At least I’m not roaring in pain,” Nate speaking through the door; “having to pee.”<br />
“At least I don’t need a cane to get up and stay up,” Peter mocking Nate; “so hurry up I need to go as well.”<br />
“You mean scream in pain again,” Nate flushing the toilet and slowly making his way out of the bathroom; “how many bone chips are you passing by the way?”<br />
<br />
“With any luck,” a female speaking as she enters the room; “enough to make another were-lion brother for me to torment.”<br />
Peter growls as he sees Jean walking into the room carrying a couple cups of hot coffee; the were-lion getting tired with all the tormenting his sister has put him through, Peter starts taking a defensive posture; prepared to fight back if Jean starts something.<br />
“Oh you’re not even a challenge anymore,” Jean laughing as she watches her brother tense up; “so relax, your safe,” Jean eliciting a devilish grin; “for the moment at least.”<br />
“Heard that before,” Peter keeping an eye on his sister as he makes his way to the bathroom; “so forgive me if I don’t relax until you leave.”<br />
<br />
“Wow,” Jean chuckling as she helps Nate to a nearby chair; “someone is tightly wound up.”<br />
“You’d be too if you been up half the night in pain,” Nate feeling another headache coming; “and he was worried if I’d snore.”<br />
“Didn’t get much sleep my wolfy,” Jean chuckling; “I have just the thing to wake you up.”<br />
“You don’t need to tell me,” Nate smiling; “I can smell the coffee. Gimme!”<br />
“Hope there is one for me,” Peter shouting; eliciting a groan as he passes another bone chip. “How many more of these do I have left to pass,” Peter howls in pain.<br />
<br />
Nate and Jean just shrug as neither could answer the question Peter just gave; instead they look into each other’s eyes as they drank coffee together. Their soul gazing was interrupted by a gruff cough. Turning their heads they see Peter looking at them.<br />
“No coffee for me,” Peter looking at the two.<br />
“You’ll have to wait,” Jean chuckling; “I believe I saw your Helen at Café Luna waiting in line for coffee just as I left.”<br />
“Helen is coming,” Peter looking happy for a change; “I think I’m feeling better already.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“Nate is still at the hospital,” Martha sighing; “I don’t think he will be in a fit state for school today.”<br />
“Speaking of which,” William getting up; “I should call Principal Andrews and let him know of Nate’s medical situation. Eric,” the were-fox looking at his son; “once I’ve gotten ready, I’ll drive you to school.”<br />
“No need,” Eric responding; “I’ve already made arraignments with Frieda last night. Her father is picking me and Spencer up.”<br />
“Alright,” William sighing; “just finish your breakfast. But I wished you told me that last night,” William muttering; there was something I need to discuss with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As William leaves the kitchen to get ready for his days lectures at the college; Martha follows him upstairs.<br />
“You know we should of told him,” Martha sighing.<br />
“And ruin his summer break with worry,” William defurring as he gets dressed; “it’s not as if its bad news to begin with.”<br />
“For him it will be,” Martha also defurring so she can get ready for her teaching job at the elementary school; “With Spencer in her second to last year of high school and Frieda starting her sophomore year…”<br />
“I know,” William nodding; “Eric’s scholastic education is about to go into overdrive. But with his excellent grades, it’s natural for person of his intellect to be placed into college level courses. Eric has an eidetic memory and a high I.Q. after all.”<br />
“I still think we should have told him,” Martha sighs; “instead of just putting him into advance classes without talking to Eric.”<br />
“We were going to last night,” William looking at Martha; “during the family dinner that didn’t happen. But Nate got jumped,” William comforting Martha; “and dealing with that crisis, it just slipped through. And remember,” William letting go; “we agreed to not tell Eric until after the Labor Day picnic.”<br />
“Just make sure you tell Principal Andrews,” Martha looking at her husband; “you need to anyway since you are informing him of Nate missing school due to being attacked last night.”<br />
<br />
As Martha and William head back downstairs, Eric was just leaving; his ride already here. Both smile as they quickly finish up getting ready.<br />
“You know,” William pausing as he was collecting his keys; “starting tomorrow, Eric will be spending most of his school days at Moon Lake college.”<br />
“Don’t expect him to attend your class,” Martha answering; “Eric does get to decide which college level courses he will be taking.”<br />
“Speaking of which,” William picking up his cell phone; “I better call Principal Andrews.”</p>
