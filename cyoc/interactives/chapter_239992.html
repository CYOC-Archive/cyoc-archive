<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeremy Willis was living with his father Jack and with his brother Malcolm in the same household. Long ago when Jeremy was just a little boy their mother had taken a divorce from their father. It had happened previously with his brother Malcolm. As Malcolm’s mother had also left him with their father Jack. Jeremy and Malcolm were stepbrothers but since they’ve lived so long together as brothers. They considered themselves as true brothers as their father’s blood run deep inside them. Malcolm was four to five years older than Jeremy was.<br />
<br />
Malcolm lived in the basement while Jeremy lived in his own bedroom on the second floor. Malcolm always joked how the basement was his dungeon while Jeremy lived up in the clouds. Both of the brothers shared their father’s surname and had no ties to their birth mothers. As such Jeremy was raised by men and didn’t know how to approach women.<br />
<br />
In high-school Malcolm had met a guy named Kurt Johnson and they became best friends. All three of them would play games on their laptops or do other activities together. It was like three brothers having fun together as Kurt was treated as honorary member of the Willis family. Kurt was tech-savvy with computers but his favorite past time was surfing on top of actual waves of water and as such he was known as the ‘surfer’ in his high school. Jeremy had always seen Kurt’s relaxed attitude as something that he wanted to imitate and on Jeremy’s sixteenth birthday he had asked Kurt if he was willing to date him. Kurt was twenty at the time.<br />
<br />
Kurt first took Jeremy’s suggestion as a joke but slowly as Jeremy showed his dedication for dating. They went on their first date after two months on Kurt’s twenty-first birthday. It was a movie night between them. Jeremy tried to act like proper boyfriend to Kurt but Kurt rejected Jeremy’s advancements. They had read online that there was no laws preventing them being together but Kurt wasn’t mentally ready. Kurt didn’t want to do anything “lovey-dovey” with Jeremy even if it was legal. Kurt always told Jeremy to wait until he grows older.<br />
<br />
Kurt wanted their relationship last long and be healthy as possible as Jeremy was all the time the one who wanted to be loving and caring to his boyfriend. Kurt was more indifferent to Jeremy’s shenanigans and random displays of affection. Kurt had directly told Jeremy that he doesn’t know what to think as to Kurt dating a 16-year-old felt wrong. Jeremy understood Kurt’s feelings and kept their relationship as normal as possible. As if they were “really” best friends who loved to hang out together all the time. On Jeremy’s seventeenth birthday Kurt brought Jeremy to surf with him and they bonded even more as Jeremy was interest non-traditional sports. It was like the beach was Jeremy’s second home that he shared with Kurt.<br />
<br />
Kurt kept calling Jeremy his bro all the time and asked if Jeremy would only call him as ‘his boyfriend’ when no-one was watching. Kurt was warming up for the idea of them being together. Still Kurt didn’t want to go down the rabbit hole of explaining why he was dating a seventeen year old. As it might have raised eyebrows if other people saw a twenty one year old and seventeen year old were calling each other boyfriends. Meanwhile as all this was happening Malcolm had no idea that his best friend and brother were unofficially dating. Malcolm saw Jeremy’s free time with his best friend as something innocent and never suspected anything happening under the surface.<br />
<br />
Jeremy was still unsure how to break the news for his brother and father. Tomorrow was going to be Jeremy’s eighteenth birthday and he wanted to have a special day with Kurt on the day before the birthday celebrations. Jeremy’s father had gone for a business trip and was going to come home tomorrow. Jack had left Jeremy and Malcolm to watch over the house. It wasn’t a long business trip but long enough to take three to four days to get back home with a plane. This meant that Jeremy could tell about his relationship with Kurt to his brother first and then after that to his father.<br />
<br />
The oddity of the day being the small black USB-stick with instructions telling what it was. It had to be gift from his father as the package was sent from a different state. Jeremy didn’t think much of it as it started to install itself on his laptop. Watching how the old tech installed it’s software and took a lot of space from his computer. Jeremy looked at the application and wondered what it can do as it had a lot of features to choose from.</p>
