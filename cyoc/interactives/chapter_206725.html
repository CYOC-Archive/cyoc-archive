<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A rush of steam exited the bathroom as Finn opened the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;You look so cute like this,&quot; Jeff smiled, laying on his bed.<br />
<br />
If there wasn&#39;t so much orange fur covering Finn&#39;s face, he knew it would have turned bright red. Even more when Jeff stood up and started undressing as he crossed his room and went into the bathroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe next time we can save some water and shower together...&quot; Jeff said, one of his big hands rubbed the damp fur on Finn&#39;s head. <br />
<br />
&quot;M-maybe,&quot; a stupid smile filled Finn&#39;s face as he nodded along. He couldn&#39;t believe all this was happening. And somehow it was even better than he imagined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good man,&quot; Jeff rubbed his head again as he stepped into the bathroom and started to shower. <br />
<br />
Finn almost had an urge to join him right then and there. He held off. Jeff was hot. Too hot. And this all still felt unreal. The feeling he was having right now just felt like a dream. He plopped down onto the large bed and took in a deep breath. The smell of their sweat and musk still stained the sheets.<br />
<br />
“It was real!” Finn squeezed the pillow hard, twirling on the bed as he silently cheered. <br />
<br />
However, a beep from the computer drew his attention. The screensaver had disappeared, and a program took its place. [Process complete. Please type what you would like to change.] Finn felt a bit of anger at himself for snooping, but couldn&#39;t deny that he wanted to know what was on the computer. Besides, Jeff needed help with his homework.<br />
<br />
The flimsiest of reasons would have worked and he went over to the computer. Finn clicked the &#39;Ok&#39; button and the box disappeared. He looked at the screen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Finn exclaimed, curiosity was really taking over when he saw his name typed into the program several times. <br />
<br />
But reading the sentences was odd. &#39;Finn is a small red anthro fox. Finn has is gay but still in the closet. Finn has a strong infatuation with me.&#39; Each of these sentences were accurate but seeing them typed out felt weird. Especially about his sexuality. It was a bit of an open secret, though no one ever called him on it.<br />
<br />
He did his best to ignore it and focus back on the program. [Type what you would like to change.] A bit of a mischievous grin filled Finn&#39;s face as he started to type. &#39;Finn satisfies me sexually like no one else ever has. My loads are twice as large as usual and feel better with each time I cum with him.&#39; He clicked enter. A loading bar appeared on the screen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shoot!&quot; the little orange fox exclaimed. <br />
<br />
He quickly shot a look at the bathroom door, hoping that Jeff wasn&#39;t finished yet. Looking back at the computer, the green bar quickly filled up and another window popped up. [Process complete. Please type what you would like to change.]<br />
<br />
Finn clicked the &#39;Ok&#39; button again and the same words appeared at the bottom of the screen. Only his addition was there as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-weird...&quot; Finn stared at the screen. <br />
<br />
Then felt a strange memory worm its way into his mind. He thought back to the shower and how difficult it was to clean all that cum out of his fur. He really had to scrub at it to actually get it off. Then looking down at his shirt. A strange bit of disgust and arousal seemed to mix as he saw the massive mess coating his clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way...&quot; His awe quickly turned into a giddy laugh. &quot;This thing works?&quot; <br />
<br />
But he remembered that Jeff had used it on him. Part of him wondered how upset he should be about this. If at all. But he also didn&#39;t like the idea of anything about him changing either. He was perfectly happy that Jeff was paying attention to him now. He went back to typing into the computer. &#39;Finn has this exact app installed on his phone.&#39;<br />
<br />
The loading bar barely appeared before it was gone again. Finn went to his shorts and fished out his phone. There it was. An app with just the letter C on it in a silvery color. &quot;So cool...&quot; Finn muttered as he opened it up. It was just like it was on the computer. But that&#39;s when he noticed the additional settings. He instantly changed it to target being unaware and the user being aware. Then quickly added a line where it asked him what he would like to change. &#39;Jeff doesn&#39;t like using the Chronivac anymore. He had his fun and is exceptionally satisfied with his changes he&#39;s made so far.&#39; Finn started giggling. Excitement filled his entire body as he had such a powerful device in his pocket.<br />
<br />
There was a beep from his phone. Finn minimized the app and checked what it was. It was a message from his friends. It was game night tonight and he was missing it to go to a stupid football party with his dad. <br />
<br />
>Hey, how long until the game is over, we’ve started without you-Charlie<br />
<br />
Finn sighed.<br />
<br />
>A little while…-Finn<br />
<br />
Wait. Did it <I>really</I> have to take a while?<br />
<br />
A smile curled across the sly fox’s face. Maybe game night would be at Jeff’s house from now on.<br />
<br />
>Come over, I’m at Jeff’s and he’d love to play-Finn<br />
<br />
There was a pause, and then all his friends chimed in on group text<br />
<br />
>Play? With king of the jock douche-bags, Jeff? Fuck no, I’m out-Charlie<br />
<br />
>Me too-Greg<br />
<br />
>I mean, he’s not terrible, but I’m not going out of my way for him-Todd<br />
<br />
Todd had sent the last one. Jeff and Todd had been friends in elementary school…until Jeff ballooned into a huge jock muscle-head. Which was the big problem. His friends hated jocks. There was an easy correction to that. Make Jeff a nerd and then, once he was back in the friend group, encourage everyone to start working out through some clever wording.<br />
<br />
That…was a big change. He loved his sexy tiger man as he was. But Finn was afraid of being a bottom, he’d rather Jeff let him top. But…the fox was rather small down there. And he was completely uninterested in football or even tutoring Jeff. He wanted a guy who understood him and could compete with him intellectually. His cock stirred in his pants. Yeah. Maybe some changes for himself and Jeff <I>were</I> in order after all.<br />
<br />
Finn began typing in sentences, starting with himself. ‘I am a weight lifter. I am a well-endowed gay fox who tops. ’ Then it was Jeff’s turn. What were those big gay guys called? Right, bears. ‘Jeff is a stereotypical nerd. Jeff is definitely not an athlete.Jeff is a gay bear who bottoms.’<br />
<br />
He hit enter and waited for it to process.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Jeff stood underneath the shower, the fluffy white tiger enjoying the heat and pressure on his muscles. <br />
<br />
He really didn’t have much to wash off, except his groin. It would be a quick shower. He lathered up some specially formulated fur shampoo and began rubbing and scrubbing, making sure he hit the crotch and belly fur.<br />
<br />
As he scrubbed his paws across his muscles he felt them…diminish. <br />
<br />
Jeff paused in his scrubbing, wondering why he felt so…off. It was like he was shrinking, muscles slowly withering away as the shower rinsed off the soap bubbles. Oddly, some muscle groups appeared more affected than others. His chest and arms were practically twigs, but his butt was still rather nice, as were his calves and thighs, though still definitely not as defined.<br />
<br />
He cut off the shower and stepped out, wanting to see what was going on. Jeff cleared the mirror of steam and stared. His muscles were mostly gone, making him look skinny and oddly bottom-heavy, where what little muscles he had remained.<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked. Of course he wasn’t muscular. He wasn’t athletic at all! What was he thinking? The tiger chuckled to himself and shook his head. He turned on the industrial fur-dryer and let it dry him off. His white and black striped fur grew thicker under the blower, color-shifting into a uniform buttery brown.<br />
<br />
The shaggy, brown-furred tiger turned off the dryer and went to the sink.<br />
<br />
His tail whisked from side to side as he tried to figure out what was different about him. As it did, it began to shorten, sliding back up into his spine until only a fluffy brown nub waggled between his ass cheeks. Jeff scratched his butt and shrugged. Whatever it was, it could wait. Finn was outside.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled on his plain white shirt and jeans. They fit…wrong, like it was sized for a different person. As he struggled to pull his head through the collar of his shirt, his muzzle pushed out a bit more, nose darkening to a moist, textured black. He felt a growing pressure in his face as his skull cracked and rearranged. With a sudden burst, the bear’s head popped through the opening. <br />
<br />
The new ursine blinked groggily, feeling a bit dazed. He gripped the edge of the sink with paws that grew wider, claws turning black and not retracting. The same thing happened to his feet, but the bear didn’t notice. Jeff straightened and adjusted his clothes so they hung properly off of him.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s body began to tingle. There was a low rumble as his stomach slowly pushed out. A fine layer of chub coated the rest of his body. Even his chest grew, though not with muscle. The bear’s face softened with the rest of his body. His jeans shifted, the rough material becoming softer as they became sweatpants, drawstring neatly tied.<br />
<br />
He stifled a burp, his shirt altering, becoming a black shirt with a D20 logo on it. Jeff couldn’t put a finger on it, but something about him seemed different. His stomach continued to gurgle and rumble, bloating out even further, pressing firmly against the edge of the sink. The bear’s cheeks started to puff, becoming pinch-able.<br />
<br />
His midsection had now filled out his shirt. It felt fairly cozy. Idly, he reached a paw down and scratched softly at his gut. A moan escaped his lips as he heard his stomach start to rumble again. His belly bulged and filled with fat. It wobbled forward inch by inch, until it pushed the front of his shirt up. Jeff’s budding moobs fully blossomed into man-breasts, areolas widening as they drooped down onto his large belly.<br />
<br />
The bear’s gut gurgled again, louder and more insistent. This time, the flow of fat felt different. He could taste something on his tongue, like custard. A gasp and chuckle escaped his lips as his belly inflated, the pressure steady this time. It hung over the front of his sweatpants, covering the loose and hastily-tied knot that kept them up. The rest of his body swelled with fat, his cheeks sagging into jowls, the flab moving down his chin and pooled there into an enormous cushion for his wide face.<br />
<br />
The weight gain didn’t stop. Years of soda swilling and snacks, bloating him. His arms were heavy with fat, the flab swinging as he rubbed his chin, trying to figure out what was changing about him. Jeff burped and patted his midsection. Maybe it was just gas, he was feeling oddly full. The bottom-heavy bear scratched his ass as he grew more and more voluptuous, the flab moving from his gut to his butt. As Jeff’s waist widened, it stretched taut his sweatpants with the drawstring taken out.<br />
<br />
He was starting to feel rather snug in his clothes. The bear’s shirt barely made it over the beach-ball sized belly and his pants were getting well-filled, feeling a bit tight around his crotch. As if it heard the thought in his mind, Jeff’s lengthy shaft tensed and shrunk back into his fat pad until only a thick nub poked out of the fupa. His ass grew thicker and chunkier, filling out his stretch-fit pyjama pants to their limits. It held its round shape, his nubby tail wriggling perkily above his bulbous butt cheeks. Jeff’s thighs and legs soon followed, fat swelling them into thick clubs, nary an ankle visible, his paws growing just as wide.<br />
<br />
Jeff pushed his glasses up the bridge of his thick muzzle and tried to think of what was bothering him about his appearance.<br />
<br />
“Wait, glasses?” The bear muttered to himself in a rather nasally voice.<br />
<br />
It was like his old voice, still deep, but higher pitched, more breathy. He reached up and pulled the glasses off his face. They were thick rimmed, black, with comically thick lenses. On taking them off he had to squint to view them.<br />
<br />
“Since when have I worn glasses?” Jeff wondered aloud, his voice starting lose its deepness, growing almost feminine.<br />
<br />
His other paw reached down and scratched his stomach, running his claws through the thick pelt that fluffed his fat, jiggly gut, as he contemplated them. He certainly couldn’t see without the glasses on. One quick look around the inside of his bathroom proved that. Everything just looked so blurry and out of focus. Frowning, he slipped them back on, feeling the thick band of scotch tape wrapped around the bridge, likely from all the times he’s broken it.<br />
<br />
He snorted and adjusted his glasses again, inspecting himself in the mirror with a tilt of his head. <br />
<br />
By this point, he was, without a question, morbidly obese. The bear’s muzzle had thick cheeks and pouty jowls drooped onto a puffy double chin that ringed his thick neck. Aside from his regular body fur, his face was framed by thick, dark brown tangle of beard that reached down to the top of his prodigious belly. His gut hung down over his waist and covered his crotch. Even though his shirt was five times larger than before, it only covered his bitch tits and most of his enormous abdomen. More thick dark brown belly fur rose from his waist in a wide-spread love trail. His cozy pyjamas were stretched wide; his waist, hips and rear seemed as wide as he was tall. <br />
<br />
As he donned his glasses and took himself in, the last bits of Jeff’s mind made their changes. He wasn’t a douche jock bro, nor was he a normal, quiet gay kid. All of his personalities were replaced entirely with nerdy science facts, useless pop culture trivia, a love of video games and books (mostly fantasy) and an incredibly awkwardness and general lack of social skills. In other words, he became a stereotypical nerd, orange eyes glimmering with intelligence.<br />
<br />
Jeff idly pawed himself and brushed his teeth. He had a date tonight with his new boyfriend! How lucky was he? And then he had a game to run…<br />
<br />
He was so busy thinking of what he was going to do, he completely forgot about what had been bothering him.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
As soon as Finn had hit the ENTER button, his body began to change.<br />
<br />
The little fox’s spine popped as he grew a few inches taller, becoming merely short. His muscles bulged, becoming visible even through his fluffy fur coat. The biggest change was Finn’s package, which bulged and pressed against the front of his jeans pleasurably.<br />
<br />
He leaned back and looked for a mirror, hoping to get a better look, but couldn’t find one. So he used the camera on his phone. The fox flexed an arm, watching a baseball-sized knot of bicep pop into stark definition. Finn smirked and adjusted his crotch. He looked rather masculine now, his cuteness upgrading into handsomeness.<br />
<br />
As he admired himself on his phone, the room around him began to shift.<br />
<br />
The bed grew larger and made itself. Sports posters hung up on the walls shifted into anime and fantasy movie posters. Little figurines and entire painted miniature armies stacked up on the shelves. The computer Finn was sitting in front of became more expensive, liquid-cooled and glowing with LEDs. The seat he was on grew wider, as though built for someone heftier.<br />
<br />
Finn heard the door open and looked up, expecting a large, nerdy tiger.<br />
<br />
Instead, out walked a morbidly obese bear wearing pyjama bottoms that were stretched tight over his wide waist. Finn’s cock got instantly hard in his pants. The brown bear was perfect. Finn’s eyes roamed over the heavy belly, big hips and wide ass. He met Jeff’s large, intelligent orange eyes, the big glasses emphasizing the bear’s handsomeness, and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Hey baby.” The bear smiled back, voice high and nasally. <br />
<br />
“Uh, hey.” Finn said, “How are you feeling?”<br />
<br />
“Better now that I’m…with…you.” Jeff’s voice broke up near the end of the sentence, voice going  froggy. <br />
<br />
The bear’s eyes widened and he pulled an inhaler from the pocket of the pyjama pants. He took a couple puff and sighed in relief, panting slightly under his breath. Finn watched it all in fascination.<br />
<br />
“Asthma?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded and rubbed his glasses with his XXL shirt as he wandered over to the bed. His walk had<br />
slowed down significantly, it was like he was swaying back and forth with all the shifting weight in his body, belly and rear wobbling with the movement. The bear plopped his wide, jiggling ass on his bed and heaved a sigh of relief, flexing his wide paws.<br />
<br />
Finn glanced at the program. It had taken him literally. And big, apparently, in the case of stereotypical nerd, meant morbidly obese. How the hell did he fix this without screwing everything up again?<br />
<br />
“Not big enough for you?” Jeff grinned crookedly and attempted a double-arm flex. Fat wobbled at the bottom of his biceps. The bear kissed the flab and winked. “What do you think?”<br />
<br />
“Are you okay with…all of that?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down at himself and shrugged. “I’m fine with it if you are. Did you change me into this or something?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
Jeff heaved himself up and waddled up behind Finn. His furry moobs brushed the back of Finn’s head. Finn found himself snuggling back into the bear’s soft form. Jeff snorted a chuckle and embraced Finn with one paw, drawing him into a warm embrace. The bear leaned forward to look over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“So, you have the Chronivac on you phone, huh?” The bear smiled.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Are you…interested in using it?” Finn asked nervously, not sure if he had worded it correctly.<br />
<br />
“No way!” Jeff snorted a laugh, pushing his glasses up his muzzle. “That’s too dangerous! Plus I already have you. What else could a guy like me want?”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Finn looked down at his phone and blinked. There was a message flashing on the screen. “What’s this mean?”<br />
<br />
“Well…” Jeff pushed his glasses up his muzzle and squinted at the screen. “It says finalizing, so if you made me nerdy or fat…reality might be altering unpredictably.”<br />
<br />
“What does that mean?”<br />
<br />
“You might not stay as muscular or…non-nerdy for long.” Jeff said. “I won’t mind, because I won’t remember reality any differently.”<br />
<br />
“But…” Finn looked down at his muscular form. “I don’t understand. I made myself muscular!”<br />
<br />
“Order of operations.” The bear explained. “You went first, then I was changed. It might be magic, but….” The bear’s voice grew raspy again and he took another puff on his inhaler. “…It’s still a computer, Finn.”<br />
<br />
“But I wanted to be muscular!”<br />
<br />
“Babe, we’ve been dating for a while now.” Jeff hugged the short, muscular fox. “I’ll love you no matter what. Now come on, I want you inside of me before our friends come over for the game.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, you play with us?” Finn asked, incredulous.<br />
<br />
“Play?” The obese bear snorted and puffed his chest proudly. “I am the dungeon master. Now let’s get to bed. We have about a half an hour before they arrive.”<br />
<br />
“B-but you just showered!” Finn said, exasperated.<br />
<br />
“You know how stinky I can get, I wanted to wash up before…” <br />
<br />
“Before?” The fox swallowed heavily, staring into his boyfriend’s eyes.<br />
<br />
The bear leaned over and kissed the fox, their tongues fighting for space in each other’s mouths. They kissed for a while, Jeff’s wide paw roaming over the fox’s body and down to his shorts, giving his hard cock a squeeze. He helped the fox out of his chair and they moved towards the bear’s big bed. The bear plopped back down, flab jiggling, taking the fox with him. Finn lay on the bear’s large belly as it wobbled under his weight. It felt a bit like a waterbed to the small fox. <br />
<br />
Finn slid off the furry gut and pulled down Jeff’s pyjama pants revealing...tighty whities with anime figures on them. The fox giggled and the bear squirmed in embarrassment. Finn reached down and pulled those off as well, a puff of moist musk escaping as he exposed Jeff’s crotch. The bear’s little nub barely poked out of his furry fupa. The blonde pubic fur glistened with sticky strands of precum, and Finn realized Jeff was hard and that was as big as his cock got.<br />
<br />
“Fill me up.” The bear murmured, rolling over onto his gut and using his paws to spread his cheeks, exposing his sweaty pink pucker.<br />
<br />
Finn’s cock throbbed, the fox breathing in the bear’s light musk. He pulled a bottle of lube from under the bed, not sure how he knew it was there, and spread it liberally around Jeff’s hole. The bear groaned in delight as Finn gently inserted his finger and began stroking his insides.<br />
<br />
“Just like that, yeah.” Jeff panted and moaned.<br />
<br />
Finn continued massaging the bear’s prostate, inserting another finger when the hole relaxed. <br />
<br />
“Ready for me, babe?” Finn grinned, enjoying the bear’s moans and positioned himself.<br />
<br />
There was a pause.<br />
<br />
“Can you fit?” The bear finally asked.<br />
<br />
“Of course I can…” Finn trailed off, staring at his dick. It had been a hefty 8 inches, but now it was receding into his crotch. “My dick’s small!”<br />
<br />
“Duh. I thought you meant a toy. Get on the bed.” The bear snorted out a laugh.<br />
<br />
Shakily, Finn climbed onto the bed. The bear positioned him so his ass was near his face and shifted himself so Finn could reach his own hole. He jumped when he felt Jeff’s cold, wet snout snuffle his tense ring. The bear chuckled, hot breath on the fox’s hole, and began licking him tenderly. Finn moaned as Jeff’s tongue loosened him up.<br />
<br />
As he moaned, his muscles began to fade. Finn’s stomach gurgled and he began to swell with a different kind of mass. He burped, tasting soda on his tongue. Finn always down a bottle of soda with Jeff just before game night.<br />
<br />
“I-I was muscular!” Finn protested.<br />
<br />
“You don’t need to be muscular, just my boyfriend.” The bear smiled, gently rubbing the chubby fox’s belly.<br />
<br />
“I-I-” The fox moaned, his gut bulging and sagging. <br />
<br />
The bear shifted his paws to massage Finn’s pecs, which bloated with fat, becoming tits. They softened and drooped onto his belly. Jeff played with them, rubbing a nipple, shooting sparks of pleasure into Finn’s brain. .<br />
<br />
“Calm down. It’s gonna be okay, babe.” The bear’s paws moved to the fox’s widening rear.<br />
<br />
“How am I supposed to fuck you if I’m like this?” The fox protested, face puffing out.<br />
<br />
“We don’t. We’re too big to use our dicks.” Jeff said and smoothly inserted his fat digit into the fox’s hole.<br />
<br />
Finn groaned, tongue lapping the air as his boyfriend prodded his prostate. His body continued to fatten and swell, forcing the bear the dig his hand deeper between the vulpine wobbly butt-cheeks. The fox’s flab started jiggling against his boyfriend’s gut. It felt warm and weirdly comforting.<br />
<br />
“There you go. Relax.” The bear encouraged as he felt his boyfriend resume fingering his hole.<br />
<br />
Finn moaned, his dick dribbling precum into his fat-pad. The motion of his gut wobbling with each movement of Jeff’s fingers in his hole was stimulating his cock in new ways. His own prods on the bear increased, fingers knuckling against the nerdy bear’s prostate. Their bodies were a wave of pleasurable furry motion.<br />
<br />
Memories of him and Jeff bingeing since they were cubs growing up together filled his mind. Finn wanted to reject them, but the constant stimulation of his prostate was making it difficult to think. He relaxed, the last twenty pounds filling him. The obese fox felt himself reach the edge of orgasm.<br />
<br />
“Jeff.” He panted. “I’m close.”<br />
<br />
“Me too.” Jeff grunted.<br />
<br />
Jeff stuck three fingers in Finn’s hole, stretching him nicely and Finn couldn’t hold back anymore. He huffed and his balls tensed and the obese fox came onto his underbelly. The bear snorted and his ass clenched around Finn’s pudgy digits and he spewed messily into his fat-pad.<br />
<br />
They lay together, panting, enjoying the after glow. A few minutes later, Jeff glanced at his phone. He cursed and hauled himself to his feet.<br />
<br />
“Let’s wash up and get ready for the game.” Jeff said. “They’re coming.”<br />
<br />
Finn nodded and smiled. They shared another kiss and got ready.</p>
