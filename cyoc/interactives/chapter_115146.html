<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sorry for being gone for so long.  I was away and did not have my computer.  However, over these past days, I&#39;ve thought long and hard, using my extremely messed up psyche to come up with some premises for some more chapters.  WARNING!  Some of the content in the upcoming chapters might be disturbingly violent and filled with death.  Just saying...<br />
<br />
Also, I&#39;m changing a big detail.  Due to me thinking about how dragons work, it makes absolutely no sense for you to be seven feet, as Rowan would not fit on you.  Your wings would be in the way, and everything would be screwed up.  Rather than saying, &quot;But Magic makes things like that not matter&quot;, I&#39;m changing you (Gannoth&#39;s dragon form) to one a bit larger.  Rather than being 7 feet long, I think 15 would be more realistic, and make more sense.  Aside from that, enjoy the story!<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest of that day wasn&#39;t particularly exciting.  You practiced your shape shifting, trying to make the changes more seamless and quicker.  Just like the book you read on your species said, you noticed that it was incredibly easy to improve your skills.  After only an hour, you were able to shift between forms in the blink of an eye.  The forms you settled on as your usual forms, AKA the ones you&#39;d be using most often were as follows:  A human form that would have the same exactly magical proficiency as you in your dragon form, but far less physical abilities.  It would look like your &quot;Angel of Death&quot; form, without the wings, hair and eyes.  Instead, you would have sapphire blue eyes, and short, black hair.  You also had your &quot;Angel of Death&quot; form, which you were excited to master.  You also went for a Phoenix form, one where you were a master of fire magic.  It&#39;s the equivalent to your &quot;Angel of Death&quot; form, but for fire instead.  Finally, your last regular form was that of a giant dragon, one much bigger than you normally are.  Aside from size though, nothing is different about this one.  It&#39;s just bigger and more intimidating.  After a lovely dinner, where you got to sit at the table, Rowan helped you hone some of your magic skills.  You were going to have fun tomorrow, and wanted to be as prepared for it as possible.<br />
<br />
You woke up to the sounds of the morning.  Crickets were chirping, birds were singing, rivers were flowing, and Rowan was snoring.  It was right before dawn, and you were ready for a day full of destruction and terror.  Once you were awake, you immediately turned into your regular human form, making getting around much easier.  Through your training yesterday, you learned that being in other forms, with the exception of Angel of Death and Phoenix is not draining, and you can just be in them indefinitely.  It takes a comparatively small amount of energy to change into forms, but with a little more practice, even that small amount will be completely negligible.  After a short amount of time, Rowan woke up.  The excitement coming off of your human face was almost palpable.  “Gannoth.  You seem ready.”  Rowan yawned, laughing slightly.<br />
<br />
“You have no idea Master!”  You smiled excitedly.  “What are we going to do?  Blow up castles, assassinate kings, what?”<br />
<br />
“Eat breakfast.”  Rowan replied with another yawn.  “We’ll discuss plans around the table.”<br />
<br />
“Okay Master.  I’m just a bit excited!”  You laughed excitedly, ready to have a great day.<br />
<br />
“I noticed.”  Rowan chuckled, getting out of his bed.  Immediately, he walked to his closet, where he put on a special outfit today.  It was pure black robes, with his normal purple accents around the waist and edges.  The thing that made it special was a long, dark purple cape.  He looked like a complete super villain, which excited you a lot.  Meanwhile, your human form’s clothing reflected the Angel of Death’s clothing.  Robes of pure blackness.  The only other color was a small, dark purple patch over your heart, showing your allegiance to Rowan.  Over breakfast, you discussed your plans for today.  The kingdom that kept sending the knights to get rid of Rowan was not too far away, and was at the beginning of Rowan’s “To Explode” list.  Needless to say, the two of you were excited for this one.  You could almost taste the hatred Rowan had for this kingdom through the violet fires of his eyes.  As you finished breakfast, you finalized your plans.  Hopefully, everything would go as planned.<br />
<br />
You were back in your normal dragon form now.  You stretched your wings as you took off into the air out of pure excitement, accidentally leaving Rowan behind on the ground.  You just wanted to feel the air in your face.  “Gannoth!  Get back down!  I can’t get on you if you&#39;re up there!”  Rowan yelled to you.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Master!”  You yelled back, descending to the ground.  “Just needed to stretch the wings.”<br />
<br />
“I understand.  Just let me on and we’ll fly there together.”  Rowan laughed, creating the magical saddle on your back.  “Today’s going to be fun.  Let’s do this!”  Rowan yelled as you took off into the skies, flying far into the vastness of the skyline.<br />
<br />
Soon, you approached a small kingdom; The Kingdom of Firenze. (I have nothing against the real Firenze [Florence, Italy], just like the name.)  This kingdom has been pissing off your Master for years, and now it’s finally time to end it all.  Today will be the end of Firenze.  Firenze was quite a small kingdom, consisting mainly of one large city; Solano.  The rest of the kingdom was mainly agricultural lands and small villages.  “This is it Gannoth.”  Rowan started, his voice reaching his commanding, powerful register.  “Firenze.  It may be small, but it is quite powerful.  It’s military might is much more than it appears.”<br />
<br />
“But it’s no match for us, right?”  You asked.<br />
<br />
“Not even close.”  Rowan laughed evilly.  “Comparing us to them is akin to comparing a cat with a mouse.  Predator and prey.”<br />
<br />
“I see.”  You smiled, joining in with the evil laughing.<br />
<br />
“Remember the plan?”  Rowan asked.<br />
<br />
“Of course Master.”  You replied, grinning an evil grin.<br />
<br />
“Now.”  Rowan commanded.  Immediately, you flipped upside down, dropping Rowan to the ground.  You watched as he hit the ground with a thud, sticking the landing perfectly and leaving a small crater where he landed.  Once he did, you assumed your “Angel of Death” form.  “Citizens of Firenze.  Bow down to me or die!”  Rowan yelled, you hearing in the distance.  After that, you heard nothing but screams.  Not a single person bowed to your master.  You weren’t sure if it was out of defiance or fear, but it didn’t matter.  They all were about to meet death.  Rowan took out his two swords, which started to glow black.  He immediately swung them around his body, creating two circular beams of dark energy, which cut through houses, buildings and people like paper.  Buildings were collapsing, people were dying, and chaos was forming.  Everything that came in contact with the beams, which cut everything within 500 feet of Rowan, started to glow black.  Then, with a huge, loud bang, everything exploded in pure black flames.  You, in the air, were giddy.  The sheer amount of destruction Rowan just caused with one attack was outstanding, and you knew this wasn’t even close to trying for him.  Rowan walked through the carnage, slicing anything and anyone that survived the attack.  Blood poured through the streets as people ran for their lives screaming.  The more they screamed, the more Rowan enjoyed their deaths.  In one particular case, Rowan found a man cowering in fear in an alleyway.  Rowan took a small fireball and shoved it into the screaming man’s mouth, who blew up from the insides in a brilliant purple explosion.  You could hear Rowan’s laughs from your watching post in the air, and they were maniacal.  Then again, your’s weren’t so far from that either.  You were enjoying every single bit of this.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes, Rowan made it to the castle.  He demanded entry, which was unsurprisingly refused.  As you neared the castle, you noticed something different.  There was a ballista aimed right at you.  You were found.  But, this wasn’t overlooked.  In fact, you wanted this to happen.  “What’s that in the sky?”  One knight asked in fear.<br />
<br />
“My pet.”  Rowan laughed.  You swooped down to the ground like a flash, showing them your terrifying presence.  “The Angel of Death.”  Rowan laughed evilly as he demanded entry again.  Still, they refused.  In fact, the knights aimed their crossbows right at you and Rowan.<br />
<br />
“Leave this place and cause no more harm to here!”  A different knight yelled, being much braver than the others.<br />
<br />
“I’d rather not.”  Rowan smiled.  “You’ve caused me enough inconveniences.  It’s time for you to die.”  The knights did not like Rowan’s response, and shot their crossbows at you.  You simply held out your hand, suspending the bolts in mid air.  You let them drop as you laughed maniacally.  Meanwhile, the knights dropped their crossbows in fear and ran for their lives.  “Gannoth, you know what to do.”  Rowan grinned an evil grin.<br />
<br />
“With pleasure.”  You replied with your own evil grin.  Keeping your arm where it was before, a small black orb appeared.  Once it was formed the way you wanted it, you shot it into the castle.  Immediately, the whole thing erupted in a pillar of blackness, just like the forest.  When the pillar evaporated away, nothing remained.  Not a single stone of the castle was visible.  The only indication of the castle’s existence was the small gate that you were standing in.  The rest of the city, that hadn’t been destroyed yet, was terrified.  People were running around, trying to gather supplies for their flight from Solano.  Rowan was not allowing anyone to escape this city though.  There were never survivors of Rowan’s attacks.<br />
<br />
“Gannoth, let’s end this.”  Rowan commanded, his voice powerful and commanding.<br />
<br />
“Let’s indeed Master.”  You grinned, returning to your dragon form.  Rowan got on your back, which still had the saddle on, and you took off, overlooking the whole city.<br />
<br />
“Gannoth, you’ve never witnessed my true power.”  Rowan smiled.  “Allow me to demonstrate.”  Rowan’s hands started to glow black, as he raised them over his head in an arching motion.  Soon, a large purple orb formed over him and you.  “Firenze, it’s time to be destroyed.  Goodbye.”  Rowan laughed as he shot the ball down.  When the ball hit the ground, a large, purple circle started to form around the border of the country.  When it was complete, it erupted into a wall of purple energy, surrounding the whole country.  Rowan finished his motions by bringing his hands down violently.  The wall of purple started moving inward, destroying everything in its path.  Eventually, it reached the center, where it became nothing but a point.  At this time, Rowan laughed and snapped his finger.  The remaining energy exploded, taking the whole country with it.  “That, my familiar, is my true power.”  You were speechless.  Rowan just destroyed an entire kingdom in one attack.  Granted, it was a geographically small and insignificant kingdom, but the point stands.  “Nobody survives an encounter with me.  Let’s go home.”  You flew home speechless.  Words couldn’t express your reaction to what you witnessed.  It wasn’t that you were disgusted or scared.  You just didn’t know how to react to such a brilliant and powerful display of power.  You knew, now more than ever, that Rowan was, no doubt, the strongest sorcerer in the world.</p>
