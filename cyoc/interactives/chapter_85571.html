<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a crisis. The world had been been caught up in a rather unorthodox epidemic. All over the news, this sickness was being showcased in great detail. It was clear the public had no idea what was going on, and they were no closer to finding a cure. By that point, the whole planet was at risk of getting infected.The illness had been given a name: the A-Virus. <br />
<br />
 I never thought I&#39;d be involved in something like this.<br />
<br />
 Hullo, my name is Catrina. Now, how to describe myself? I&#39;m a twenty year old woman from Britain, hence the british accent. I like to think of myself as at least somewhat intelligent and efficient. I can be very quiet around strangers, but I do enjoy having fun in my own different ways.<br />
<br />
 Now for my appearance. I&#39;m very much thin, a little bit too much so if I do say so myself. My hair is a darker blue color (I dyed it, don&#39;t ask) grown long and straight, and it reaches to my bellybutton in length. I have a cute, small nose. The same could be said for my lips. My height is around 5&#39;4.<br />
<br />
 My butt isn&#39;t anything amazing, I assure you. Neither flat nor bubbly, really. But I do pride myself on my hips. They are wonderfully wide and give me an impressive hourglass figure. My breasts are average at best, I&#39;d say. Probably in the B-C cup category.<br />
<br />
 Of course I&#39;ll keep out some of my, er, &#39;&#39;minor&#39;&#39; details about myself until later. You&#39;ll know what they are when you read about it.<br />
<br />
 Now without further ado, my story.<br />
<br />
 ******<br />
(Catrina&#39;s point of view)<br />
<br />
 I was beyond late. I quickly took a turn to my left, then passed a red stoplight. Usually I prided myself over having a perfect driving record, but I couldn&#39;t afford those pleasantries today. I was supposed to give a special presentation to my boss. No biggee, just the most important project in my whole life.<br />
<br />
 I was an employee (or lawyer) at Pem-Corp, the UK&#39;s largest law firm. Becoming a lawyer there had always been my dream as a kid, but to be perfectly honest, my two years of working there showed me how boring writing papers at an office really was. <br />
<br />
 I never slept in before in those two years, and I never had to use an alarm clock. I pinned my troubles on a new stress-relieving medicine I had tried the night before. Some stress-relieving that turned out to be.<br />
<br />
 I screeched my car to a halt as I arrived at Pem-Corp&#39;s parking lot, then arrived at the office&#39;s waiting room. I noticed the presence of the attendant (one of my co-workers), Debby. <br />
<br />
 &#39;&#39;Am I late!?&#39;&#39; I said with haste.<br />
<br />
 Debby laughed, then said, &#39;&#39;No worries there, Cat (one of my nicknames). Your bosses are also late today, as usual.&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
 I sighed. I had really dodged a bullet there. I went to sit down on one of the plush red sofas in the waiting room. To my left was a flat-screen TV showcasing an emergency broadcast on the national news channel. Despite trying to act professional, I couldn&#39;t help but stare at the screen. <br />
<br />
 The newscaster was speaking of the A-Virus, which was the usual talk nowadays. Apparently the situation was becoming even worse in India. A staggering 10% of their entire population were now infected with the illness. The scene shifted to a video of the treatment center for the A-Virus. One woman was shown with fuzzy rabbit ears coming from her head. Another with full-grown tusks. One man had patches of scales on his body.<br />
<br />
 Yes, you may be wondering what sort of illness causes these types of effects, and that answer is the A-Virus. The planet was shocked to discover that the disease caused people to mutate; sometimes with small changes and sometimes with more drastic changes. The population had named these infected citizens, &#39;&#39;Animal people&#39;&#39;.<br />
<br />
 Nobody actually knew how it was provoked, just that it thankfully wasn&#39;t contagious. Scientists had discovered that the virus held random animal DNA, causing the transformation. And that was the basic knowledge of the disease, which wasn&#39;t much to work on for whoever was trying to prevent it.<br />
<br />
 My boss had finally arrived, and greeted me. He was a friendly chap, if not a tad harsh and stern. The other executives arrived shortly after. I readied for the presentation. For some reason, my stomach was feeling rather queasy. I dismissed it as my own nervousness. <br />
<br />
 My presentation went smoothly. My voice had cracked only a couple of times, and I gave my bosses good pointers. They clapped as I finished, but I still felt nauseaus. <br />
<br />
 I headed for the washroom and threw up. I truly felt pitiable. However, what was stranger was a tugging sensation coming from under my skirt. Since I&#39;d previously locked the bathroom, I took my skirt off. What I found made me scream. Right above my panties was a furry, black cat tail.<br />
<br />
 I started panicking. Me, infected with the A-Virus? How could this happen? Will I be stuck this way forever? My thoughts were interrupted as I experienced a sharp pain coming from my head. I watched in horror as two fluffy cat ears emerged, and my regular ears slowly shrunk until there was nothing left. I couldn&#39;t hear anything until blood pumped through them. I poked them to make sure they were real. They were.<br />
<br />
 I had to hide, now that I was clearly an animal person. I made sure there was nobody watching, then left the office. I was almost to my car when two strangers walked past me. I could tell by their expanded eyes that they had seen me, and it wouldn&#39;t be long before they called for the authorities. <br />
<br />
 I got inside my car, then drove off. My transformation, I noticed, had given me a keen sense of sight. I watched every detail of the road with ease. Oh god, I was a freak. I shortly arrived at my home, then checked myself in the giant mirror in my living room. <br />
<br />
 The... fur of my new cat tail and ears were the same color as my hair: dark blue. Which was strange, since it was dyed to be that color.<br />
<br />
 I had felt something strange under my blouse. I removed it, then screamed. Over my crotch were three pairs of cat teats. I began to touch them, and they were extremely sensitive. I barely had any time to myself when an armed military crashed into my home through the window. <br />
<br />
 The soldier seemed to be alone, but had a confident air to him. He removed his helmet. Or should I say, &#39;&#39;her&#39;&#39; helmet -- she was actually a woman. <br />
<br />
 She stared at me and said calmly. &#39;&#39;Excuse me, but you&#39;ve got the A-Virus. You&#39;re gonna have to come with me.&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
 I hadn&#39;t resisted, there was no point. She escorted me into a black van with some organization&#39;s logo on it. We sat down on the van&#39;s chairs. <br />
<br />
 The woman put on some sunglasses. &#39;&#39;So,&#39;&#39; she began. &#39;&#39;Catrina, right? We&#39;ll be searching for a host to keep you.&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
 ******<br />
(Jacob&#39;s point of view)<br />
<br />
 Hey, the name&#39;s Jacob. <br />
 I&#39;m just a seventeen year old guy living in a small apartment in London. If you&#39;re wondering why a kid living in London would have an american accent, get in line. I moved here around two years ago to live on my own. Some decision that had ended up to be. <br />
<br />
 I&#39;m a short dude, about 5&#39;2. I have my curly blond hair grown sort of long, with a messy bedhead style. I&#39;m not a bodybuilder, but I have some muscle from my job as a U-Haul employee. <br />
<br />
 ...I might have found it odd when a stranger in military uniform showed up at my door with a cat girl standing next to her. She obviously looked nervous. But I inspected the girl in uniform and then recognized her face.<br />
<br />
 &#39;&#39;Cousin Sarah, is that you?&#39;&#39; I asked, then nudged my shoulder in the cat girl&#39;s direction. &#39;&#39;And who&#39;s this?&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
 Sarah broke her usual grim face with a smile. &#39;&#39;Yeah, it&#39;s me. I need you to do me a small favour...&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
 The favour was anything but small. I watched as Sarah drove off my driveway without the cat girl. She had told me the whole story. Apparently the woman next to me was infected with the non-contagious A-Virus, and she wanted me to keep her at my place. Since this would be the first infection in the UK, she didn&#39;t want to cause panic.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s how Catrina came to live with me.<br />
<br />
