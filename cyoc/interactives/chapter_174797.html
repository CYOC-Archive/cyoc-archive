<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ten years later, I&#39;m pondering my fate. I k ow it&#39;s almost the holidays, as the farm is putting up their bright shiny lights again, that my poor eyesight can barely pick up in the grey, foggy world.<br />
<br />
Ten years ago, my brother and I, Anthony who went by Ant, got home from school. The first thing we noticed, was the infamous red letter envolope sitting on the counter. Red. A &quot;color&quot; I would no longer recognize.<br />
<br />
Next thing we noticed, was mom sitting at the table, gripping a letter with tears in her eyes. The third thing we noticed, ware two officers standing in the kitchen. My stomach immediately turned to knots. A pang  I still feel to this day. We both dropped our school bags on the floor. An item I would never touch ever again.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here to take Vincent Salvatore away.&quot; The mention of MY name froze me in my tracks.I could almost feel the tension drain from my tein brother and best friend. I could only stand there and gape.<br />
<br />
&quot;This. This has to be a mistake!&quot; I blurted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all. Ma&#39;am, the letter please?&quot; said one of the officers, holding a hand out. Mom just continued sitting there,  gripping the dreaded letter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am. The letter. Please. It must be delivered to its proper recipient.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom stood up, and thrust it at the officer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. Here, son. Read it very carefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
I no longer remember the exact words written in that letter. I just remember the official stamp of the state government, and two words:<br />
<br />
Species: Donkey.<br />
<br />
My jaw dropped,  as I stood there, stunned. Staring at the word &quot;donkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations. You&#39;ll remain male. You&#39;ll have a week to say goodbye to your family. You&#39;ll have to wear this GPS ankle bracelet for tge duration. Any attempt to tamper with this device or run away,  will result in your entire family replacing you. And in the end, you will be caught and converted anyway, and become a work animal rather than a breeder. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
I could only stand there, dumbfounded. A donkey! These were goverment people. The threat would noy be and idle one. They do mean business.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for your school, well, everything has already been arranged. All your teachers and principal have all been notified of your permanent absence, and your permanent record has been shredded. Your entire education to this point has been negated and rendered meaningless.&quot;<br />
<br />
We always knew that identical twins would be guranteed a new placement in the dying animal kingdom. We knew it was policy for the younger of the twins to be the unfortunate one. But we went through the motions of a normal life anyway when the bill was passed the previous year. Believing that it couldnt possibly be true. The bill was supposed to only be targetted for those 18 and older. Except for the younger of identical twins. The only ones that didnt need to be entered into the lottery. We were guaranteed to become breeders. The species was the only thing that would be random. 60% were to be females. So I had a 40% chance at remaining male. <br />
<br />
The officers grabbed me by the arms, and forced me into a seating posistion in a chair, so they could chain me up with the little tracking device. I was too scared or stunned to really resist, when I hear it snap into place around my right ankle.<br />
<br />
The officers stood up and handed mom a small booklet on my instructions, my rights, and my responsibilities, which I was to read. It also contained a legal list of consequences should I attempt to become a fugitive. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. And have a nice day.&quot;<br />
<br />
The officer left. The house was quiet, as I reluctantly looked down at the hated big bright red ankle bracelet that marks me for my fate. One of the rules, is that I was now disallowed from wearing pants. I was allowed to go back to school to say bye to all my friends and teachers. But those of us fated to wearing these ugly red bracelets,  typically would be mercilessly ridiculed as walking, talking future farm animals. Even the most popular of kids, quickly became the butt of jokes. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Ant asked:<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what are you going to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A do- a do-&quot; I coulndt say it.<br />
<br />
&quot;A dog!?&quot;  He asked.<br />
<br />
I hung my head in embarressment.<br />
<br />
&quot;No....a....donkey....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A donkey!? Gross!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; I said idignantly.<br />
<br />
Ant huffed. &quot;Well,  Im going up to my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My&quot; room. Typically, he would say &quot;our&quot; room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....Ant....?&quot; I started. <br />
<br />
He ignored me and headed upstairs. I followed him. He slammed the door in my face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! What&#39;s the big idea!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want no disgusting donkey in my room&quot; he shouted from the inside.<br />
<br />
That memory still pierces me to this day. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well. I&#39;m not a donkey!&quot; I shouted &quot;....yet...&quot; I added in a lower voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, soon enough you&#39;ll be braying from a farmyard and pissing wherever you desire with a big smelly old dong!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
 And he wasnt wrong. Here I am, reminiscing in some random field and pissing a long stream of acrid-smelling hot piss from my emormously huge long black hose dangling between my hind legs. I can feel my giant wobbly black balls churning at the thought of being human again. My front hooves trying for the millionth time to grow fingers with which I could flex and grip. But they remain intact as hard black hooves below my front legs. This has been my ritual for the past 10 years. A decade. With a lifetime still to go for being sentenced to all fours.<br />
<br />
My giant black donkey dick goes rigidly hard again. This has happened at least twice every single day since I awoke on all fours for the very first time. My nostrils picked up the scent as I thought about my twin brother. My DONKEY twin. I was turned into an identical twin of a natural-born donkey a decade ago. My current body carries all of his DNA. I no longer biologically have a human twin, and never will. Imstead,  I now have a biological donkey twin. And always will.<br />
<br />
The scent I pick up is that of a female. A female in heat. She has noticed my own discomfort and came wandering over. My body can&#39;t help itself. The disgusting scent wafting from a female in heat,  causes my body to go into &quot;reproductive&quot; mode. Even though I am now an old geriatric donkey at the age of 25, my body still insists on doing its thing, even against my mental protests. One sniff of her cunt, and I&#39;m immediately up on my hind legs trying to grip her large barrel-like hips with my fingerless front hooves from behind.<br />
<br />
My dick tries to find its home insde her loose, soft folds. She is a slut that has babied several foals already, all to different donkey jacks. I must be about her dozenth, while she is my two dozenth. I only get stabled with a female twice a year. Every other day, im by myself strugging to ejaculate. So when my body is finally paired with a female, its reaction is immediate.<br />
<br />
Two old graying slutty breeder donkeys know exactly what to do. I find my home and drive forward walking on two legs, but not unsupported which has been my decade-long dream to have back. To be able to walk upright again, instead of being relegated to be stuck on all fours. And she pushes back against me. My dick easily fits inside her flappy loose folds.</p>
