<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mark Rhodes, an 18 year old male.  I&#39;m Dr. Remor.  Please follow me.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Mark followed, and endured as he was subjected to various tests, but he didn&#39;t feel good. After a while he&#39;d had enough.  &quot;Doc, I can&#39;t take this.&quot;  He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it&#39;s hard, but you&#39;ll be ok I promise.  Tell me what has you upset?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I&#39;m terrified about possible mental and physical changes, but becoming a hero is everything I ever wanted too.  So I mostly just wish I could get it over with before I have an anxiety attack about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; said Remor, &quot;That actually may be possible.  We&#39;ve recently discovered that exposure to high levels of Agent Indigo can speed up the change into a super.  We&#39;ve been wanting to experiment more with it, and would love to have you as a test subject.  I will say that while we haven&#39;t discovered any dangers to the process, you never know with Indigo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;  said Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well&quot; said Remor.<br />
<br />
Soon Mark was standing inside a sealed glass chamber, waiting to once again be dosed with Agent Indigo.  Then the gas began to fill the chamber.  He nervously held his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please breathe in deeply, Mark.&quot;  said Halsing.  Mark complied, and for a moment he felt nothing, but then it happened!  It was as if someone had turned his heart into a drum and struck it as hard as they could.  It hurt like hell, but as the vibrations flowed through him, he felt an electric tingle of power flowing outwards from his heart and into the rest of his body.  He noticed his skinny frame beefing up, growing powerful.  What a rush! Then the tingle reached his dick and well, that grew too.  He rapidly got the biggest erection of his life, and then it grew bigger and bigger.  At first he was a tad embarrassed to be pitching a tent as the doctor watched, but then the tingle reached his head, and the pleasure grew, and he forgot about that completely.  He was lost in the rush and looked down at his huge dick with nothing but pride<br />
<br />
But then something...changed.  He started to feel different.  The electric energy coursing through him now somehow felt...cold.  He saw his skin turning black, a jet black with shine to it, like polished obsidian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot; he heard the doctor curse.  &quot;Shit, shit.&quot;  <br />
<br />
When the Agent was cleared from the chamber it unlocked, and Mark stepped out.  He was still pitching a tent, but it just didn&#39;t feel like anything shameful anymore.  He didn&#39;t feel inclined to hide it.  But he supposed it was expected, so he did casually move one hand down there to cover it.  &quot;Apologies for the sight.&quot;  He said. He also felt strangely comfortable with his new skin, which he was busy looking over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing I haven&#39;t seen a hundred times before,&quot; said Remor, &quot;But, well, son, you&#39;re clearly a changed.  Furthermore, you&#39;re a wyrdling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you be sure?&quot;  Asked Mark, but he knew it was true.  He just felt it inside, an inner knowledge that he was different now, almost like he was no longer part of this world.  He belonged to...something else.<br />
<br />
The doctor looked upset, almost pained. &quot;There&#39;s no easy way to say it, but I know because I can feel myself struggling not to look on you with suspicion even though I wasn&#39;t mere seconds ago.  I know it&#39;s just the damn magic or whatever it is and I still struggle with it.  It honestly takes more mental energy to treat a Wyrdling with compassion.  I&#39;ll always put that energy in, but a lot of people won&#39;t.  I&#39;m sorry son.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark only smiled though.  &quot;It&#39;s ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, well, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re adjusting well.  There&#39;s a mirror over here if you want to see yourself fully.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark stepped over and observed himself.  He barely fit in his old clothes now, with all his new muscle straining them to the limit  His skin was black, but also just slightly translucent, so that his veins, now glowing with the namesake color as Indigo flowed through them, could be seen.  His eyes were a brilliant purple on dark purple sclerae, and his hair a brilliant blue. Looking closely at his pointer finger, he noticed that it had a retractable claw.  Most uniquely, he also had a long monkey-like tail, which split into two tails halfway up.  He did indeed look weird, but he was also actually quite stunning to behold.  Many wyrdlings were hideous.  He was lucky.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is said that Wyrdlings are chosen by a goddess of chaos...&quot; said Remor, &quot;I can understand why people feel that way.  You have that otherworldly feeling about you.  Well, shall we go on to power testing?  Sometimes powers can be discovered right away, but other times-&quot;  Remor stopped.  Mark was staring at his chest oddly.  &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;  asked the doctor.<br />
<br />
Mark could suddenly see something through the doctor&#39;s shirt.  It was a trio of small rectangular objects, that seemed to shine with an inner light that only he could see.  They were...calling to him. He almost felt like he could hear them, and they were singing. He reached out to touch, but the doctor stepped back in alarm.  &quot;What are you doing?&quot; asked Remor nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; said Mark.  &quot;but what is that under your shirt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;  Said Remor, looking a bit ashamed at his reaction. He reached under his collar and pulled out a trio of crystals that hung from his neck.  &quot;Selenite, tourmaline, and moonstone.  It may be atypical for a man of science, but I&#39;m a pagan who believes in a fair bit of magic.  Selenite is said to cleanse, and black tourmaline to protect, basically.  Moonstone helps with channeling the divine feminine, but I actually have found that it helps me connect to my masculinity as well.  You can&#39;t have one without the other, I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...that&#39;s what it says.&quot; said Mark<br />
<br />
&quot;What it says?&quot; asked Remor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can hear it.  Not quite in words, and they don&#39;t seem conscious in the same way that humans are, but they have voices of a kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fascinating.&quot; said Remor, &quot;No doubt this is your new power.&quot;  He removed the crystals from his neck and offered them.  &quot;You may touch, but please treat them with respect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark reached forward and moved his hand over the crystals, listening to them one at a time, before deciding to pick up the tourmaline.  As soon as he did, the doctor was sent flying backwards!  The crystals dropped to the ground, except for the tourmaline that remained in his hand.  &quot;Are you ok?&quot;  asked Mark, but the doctor was picking himself up off the ground.  &quot;I&#39;ll be fine, thank you.&quot;  Then he pointed.  &quot;You&#39;re generating a visible energy field of some sort around yourself!  It pushed me back.  You don&#39;t suppose...that since tourmaline is meant to be protect, that your power uses this to generate a protective field?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark regarded the shimmering sphere around himself.  &quot;Yes, that&#39;s exactly what happened.  I absorbed some sort of energy from the tourmaline and then it happened.  Sorry for knocking you back.  I think I&#39;m learning how it all works quite quickly though.&quot;  He focused for a second, and the energy field vanished.<br />
<br />
&quot;A truly unique and wondrous power.&quot; said the doctor.  &quot;Do you think you can do other things with the other crystals?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark nodded.  &quot;I know I can.&quot;  The other two crystals on the ground were calling to him, but one far louder than the other.  The moonstone was practically begging to be used.  He sat down and waved his hand over it again, listening to it.  He was slightly hesitant about the moonstone if it was meant to channel the feminine...  But as he listened to it he got impressions of masculinity and strength.  The doctor had said it helped with that too, and if the crystal was promising that then he supposed it would be ok.  He reached out and touched it.  <br />
<br />
As soon as his finger grazed the surface, he knew he&#39;d fucked up.  He could practically hear the crystal laughing at its successful ruse as he felt it suck all the masculinity out of him in an instant.  All of his newly acquired muscle vanished, living him even skinnier than before.  He&#39;d shrunk to about 4 feet and looked like the ultimate wimp, and now not only did his drink shrink to a micro penis, but he quickly lost all libido. He didn&#39;t think he&#39;d even be able to get hard if he tried.  His once stretched clothes now swallowed his frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot;  he cried.  He picked up the moonstone and tried to will it to give his masculinity back, but it resisted him.  &quot;You bastard, give it back!&quot;  It gave him something back sure enough, but not what he&#39;d wanted.  Having drained him of the masculine, now it poured in the feminine.  He let out an unintentional feminine squeal of surprise as two huge boobs erupted from his chest right before his eyes and he felt his dick suck inside, leaving him no doubt with a vagina.  In shock he, or rather she, dropped the moonstone.  She looked into the mirror and beheld the most curvaceous babe to walk the planet, if perhaps one that was still clearly a wyrdling.  Her massive breasts, of a size bigger than she even knew how to quantify, felt painfully restrained in her shirt, and then it ripped open, leaving her on full display.  Looking down she noticed that the expansion of her hips and ass had done the same thing to her shorts.  She looked at the doctor.  His eyes were wide, the bulge in his pants clearly growing.  <br />
<br />
Logically she should be embarrassed, or ashamed, sitting here looking like this feminine sex pot while a man ogled her, but she wasn&#39;t.  The stone had drained all such masculine thoughts from her, and suddenly she was noticing that the doctor was very handsome, and beginning to pitch quite a large tent in his pants.  She smiled at him.  &quot;Like what you see?&quot; she asked.  The doctor barely managed a nod.  The poor thing must be overwhelmed by her sex appeal.  How cute!  &quot;Well, I like what I see too.&quot; she purred, and the she began to crawl towards him, leaving behind the last scraps of her clothes as she kicked off her sandals.  His eyes only widened further as they took in her bountiful ass, swaying back and forth as she made her way across the floor to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you say, want to give me a crash course in my new womanhood, stud?&quot;</p>
