<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A tears eyed and awkward Adrian arrived at Shawn’s door late that evening and he seemed completely understanding. He pulled his couch out into a hidabed and promptly set Adrian up in his own before collapsing into the makeshift bed and sleeping there.<br />
<br />
The week progressed with this setup. Adrian went to work per the norm and had to put up with her boss hitting on her while anticipating that week at Shawn’s parents place. She had enough clothes at Shawn’s place to avoid going back to her landlord and packing proved to be a relative breeze. Adrian’s passports had changed and security didn’t look at her twice when she boarded the plane. She sat in the jet reading a book while finding the seat uncomfortable. Shawn sat next to her avoiding physical contact and they spent the ride flying north in silence until they reached the airport. As they left the terminal they glanced at each other and slowly locked hands.<br />
<br />
Permission to kiss you first thing in the morning,” Shawn requested.<br />
<br />
“Granted,” Adrian replied, they had to make this look convincing after all.<br />
<br />
The two of them walked outside with luggage in hand and it took all of five seconds for a teenager to spot them and wave at them. She was a slender Brunette with a small bust and Adrian could immediately feel the girl size her up. Adrian was curvy and though her waist caved inwards it was more a result of her hips and breasts than the thinness the girl sported. Maybe it was because she was a guy but she didn’t feel self conscious and trick herself into thinking she was overweight or something.<br />
<br />
The girl was Shawn’s sister and she put on this completely fake happy tone while greeting Adrian. She then loaded them up into the car, Shawn in front and Adrian in back before zipping off towards home. The siblings chattered about everything and Adrian felt completely invisible to them. The rumbled down city streets and through residential sectors before arriving at a small house crammed between other houses of the same build. They exited the car and Adrian was left with the luggage. She didn’t mind, she was completely capable of carrying it all. They reached the front door and she entered with her things clutched in her arms finding a pretty normal home with pictures of the family on the wall. She entered the room unsure where to leave the bags while a couple entering their elderly years hugged their son and congratulated him, after they were done they turned to Adrian with broad smiles.<br />
<br />
“You must be Adrianna,” Shawn’s mother smiled before hugging her and being followed by Shawn’s father.<br />
<br />
“You can put the luggage upstairs in Shawn’s old room,” His father explained. Shawn quickly grabbed Adrian and dragged her upstairs with bags in tow. They shut the door to the room that had long been a guest room and exchanged a look.<br />
<br />
“Pet name?” Shawn asked in a near panic.<br />
<br />
“Anna seems fine,” Adrian shrugged while Shawn exhaled.<br />
<br />
“Okay, expect them to start probing for problems, this is why I never told them about you... er... Vivian...” Shawn trailed.<br />
<br />
“Relax, I’m a great liar, I won’t tell them I’m actually a man and your real fiancé ran off with neither of us,” Adrian replied while they left the room and descended the stairs. What followed was a quick seperation. Shawn was sat down by his father while Adrian was hooked by his mother.<br />
<br />
“How did you two meet?” Shawn’s father asked while Shawn laughed and scratched the back of his head.<br />
<br />
“In... um... At a holiday party...” Shawn explained while grinning nervously.<br />
<br />
“Can you cook?” Shawn’s mother asked from Adrian’s side of the room.<br />
<br />
“Of course, best cook in my class,” Adrian replied while waving her hands. Shawn’s mother pointed to a pot of boiled and skinned potatoes and Adrian immidiately knew what she meant. She walked up to the pot and lifted the masher. She exhaled deeply and pressed the potatoes downwards.<br />
<br />
“But I assume you two just eat out a lot,” Shawn’s mother stated in an assuming voice.<br />
<br />
“Oh on the contrary,” Adrian laughed while picking up speed with her mashing. Her fingers ought out the margarine and added some in, “how creamy did you want these?”<br />
<br />
“Decently,” Shawn’s mother replied.<br />
<br />
“I cook for him you see,” Adrian lied while pointing to herself.<br />
<br />
“What kinds of food?” She asked with narrowed eyes.<br />
<br />
“Um... steak, tacos, uh...” Adrian trailed before her brain seemed to get access to a new pocket of information, “I make a mean vinegarette Caesar, bruschetta wrapped asparagus is one of his favourites, I also enjoy brocolli with lemon zest and parmasan...”<br />
<br />
Adrian blinked as her mouth went into rapid fire listing off dishes she only just found the names of and ingredients involved. Shawn’s mother seemed to be growing more and more impressed as Adrian began to list off foreign dishes she hadn’t understood until now. This continued until dinner was ready and she helped carry food to the table and was seated next to Shawn. She sat down delicately and for the first time in her life understood which fork was which.<br />
<br />
“Something weird is going on,” Adrian whispered into Shawn’s ear.<br />
<br />
“For some reason I remember meeting you on Christmas,” Shawn replied.<br />
<br />
“I was in a cute black dress,” Adrian smiled nostalgically before shaking her head.<br />
<br />
“So how long were you two together before...” Shawn’s father asked while the false couple exchanged a look.<br />
<br />
“Two years,” Shawn replied.<br />
<br />
“And you never told us until now,” Shawn’s mother replied while plating some ham.<br />
<br />
“Well considering what you did to Valarie whenever I introduced her how could I blame you?” Shawn demanded while recalling his ex girlfriend who had dumped him almost two years ago now. Adrian blinked both recalling dating Valarie herself and only hearing about her second hand.<br />
<br />
“We just wanted to make sure you were with the right girl,” Shawn’s mother smiled.<br />
<br />
“Well let’s drop the secrecy act then,” Adrian suggested while putting her fork down, “I can take any questions you have.”<br />
<br />
“Where do you work?” Shawn’s father asked.<br />
<br />
Adrian was about to say she worked in a supermarket but she responded instead with, “Mark’s Steakhouse,” a place she hadn’t heard of... no wait it was one of the priciest and fanciest restaraunts in the city. Millionaires, athletes, and business owners ate there and she was sous Chef there, right under her master Jorges Delophante, who had apprenticed her after finishing culinary school. Adrian blinked and quickly explained that to Shawn’s parents. They had met at a Christmas party because her brother had invited her. But she didn’t have a brother. No she did, his name was Conner.<br />
<br />
The more they talked the more information flowed in Adrian and Shawn’s heads. Their favourite places to eat, their fights, and the things they did together. By the time the meal ended they were holding hands under the table. They helped clean up, they talked with the family, and eventually retired to their room. The door was shut and locked and they embraced and kissed. All that information had been revealed. They’d given away every subject but one.<br />
<br />
And that indormation was that Anne liked to be on top.</p>
