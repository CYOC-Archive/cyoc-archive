<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Small&quot;, finishes Lindsey. &quot;I doubt the merciful one would actually be good, but I&#39;m still willing to take the bet that you&#39;re telling the truth and this one&#39;s small.&quot; I smirk, &quot;The small punishment. Well, I&#39;ll tell you this much, it&#39;s better than some of the others, but I doubt you&#39;ll like it anyway.&quot; Lindsey tenses up as I flick the wand at her, but when nothing happens in the immediacy, she gives me a strange look, &quot;What was that supposed to do?&quot; I grin deviously, &quot;You&#39;ll see!&quot; I stroll over to the bed and flop down next to Lindsey, who flinches away, &quot;While we&#39;re waiting, let&#39;s have a little fun.&quot; Her look of confusion changes to indignant anger as I wrap my hand around her, restricting her hands from moving. &quot;Hey let go!&quot; She shouts, pushing me away and jumping up as I reach my hand towards he chest. &quot;Oh come on, it&#39;s just a little fun.&quot; I cackle, advancing towards her. She backs away towards the door and struggles with the handle, but after a few seconds, gives up and turns back to me. I know I&#39;m in trouble when I see anger, not fear in her eyes. She pounces on me, socking me in the face. &quot;Ow!!!&quot; I scream as a stumble backwards. &quot;Now you&#39;re in for it!&quot; I scream and rush at her, she attempts to dodge around me, but trips on her pant leg, pulling her pants partially down and falling onto her bed. I quickly take advantage and pin her. Her confusion is evident, even as she struggles, but while she might have been able to escape minutes before, now she&#39;s helpless. Finally giving up, she glares at me, &quot;What did you do? There&#39;s no way I&#39;d normally trip on my clothes.&quot; I grin, I&#39;d like to think I can pull of a pretty good devious grin, but Lindsey didn&#39;t even flinch, &quot;My dear Lindsey, you&#39;re shrinking.&quot; I cackle. That shocked her pretty good. I took advantage of the distraction to reposition my hold so that my hands were free.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I can have the fun you tried to deny me.&quot; I mock her as I squeeze her tits. She screams at me to stop and struggles again of course, but despite not being noticeably much smaller, she&#39;s definitely weaker. I pull up her shirt a little bit and run my fingers along the skin between her breasts before reaching under her bra and stroking them. Moving on, I decide to make things worse for her, I reach for her panties and begin to lower them, only for Lindsey to get a hand free, guess I can&#39;t quite do that yet. I subdue her again and have fun stroking her exposed skin as she begins to cry. As she shrinks some more, I stop molesting her temporarily, and wipe a tear from her eye, &quot;There there,&quot; I mock, &quot;It&#39;ll all be all right.&quot; I get off of Lindsey, but I&#39;m able to pick her up easily. It takes both hands as she struggles, but it&#39;s not incredibly difficult. &quot;Calm down, it&#39;ll be ok.&quot; I say, grinning. I hug her close to my chest and rock her like I would a baby. Surprisingly, this calms her down and I stop as she asks me a question, &quot;Why?&quot; She asks, her voice quivering, &quot;Why are you doing this? I deserve some punishment for abandoning you, I&#39;ll admit that, but why torture me this much?&quot; I smile at her, a smile full of happy loathing, &quot;Because I can,&quot; I respond, &quot;And because you deserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deciding that the lull in her torture had extended too long, I rip off her panties and bra, her other clothes having fallen off long ago. I use on hand to hold her in place while I use the other to tickle her pussy. She squirms harder, but I continue. I try to stick my finger in, but I waited too long and it&#39;s too large. I&#39;m temporarily dismayed, and even consider making her a little bigger, before I&#39;m struck with a brilliant idea. I grab a pen from Lindsey&#39;s desk and roughly shove the smooth end into Lindsey. The gasp that punctuates this action makes me grin, and I begin to work the pen up and down as she squirms and moans. I roughly finger Lindsey&#39;s body as I do this, but she&#39;s beyond caring about anything but the intruding pen. I smile as she shrinks further and further, until she orgasms. I remove the pen, now far too big for her, and drop her on her bed, exhausted. She lays there as she proceeds to lose the last few inches, ending at just under two inches tall.<br />
<br />
I let her recover for a bit until she resumes motion and struggles to get up. I grab her leg and whip her into my cupped hands. She attempts to stand but I flick her rear and she falls forward. &quot;Before we begin your punishment, I thought there&#39;s something you might want to know.&quot; I say, as she glares at me from my hands, &quot;What.&quot; She spits the words out, venom in her voice. I&#39;m honestly impressed shes still defiant at this point, but I&#39;ll get that knocked out of her. &quot;You&#39;re effectively invincible, you won&#39;t take any injuries you can&#39;t heal, that doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t feel the pain, if you would have broken a leg, you&#39;ll still feel the bone-crushing pain for a second, but you&#39;ll be fine afterwards.&quot; She glares at me, and I move her closer to my eyes so I can see her better, intent on examining her body one last time before her punishment. Then she spits, right into my eye. I reel backwards blinking, she tries to dive out of my hand, but I&#39;ve got her. I glare at her, then my anger melts into a smile as I get an idea, &quot;I believe a demonstration of that last principle is in order.&quot; I say. I pick her up below her arm pits and dangle her in front of me. &quot;You see, if I put my fingers like this,&quot; I snap her bone and she lets out a howl of pain, &quot;Your bone will shatter.&quot; I remove my fingers and her leg snaps back into place. &quot;But it can get worse,&quot; I tell her as I reach for the pen I used earlier. I uncap the pen, the smooth end now the side of her head, and move it towards her vagina. I marvel at the fear in her eyes as I move it towards her, &quot;Let this be a lesson,&quot; I say, and roughly shove the pen into her. It doesn&#39;t go in easily, I have to push pretty hard, but it does, tearing apart her insides and pushing her outwards. Her howls of pain are swiftly cut off as the pen pierces her lungs. I grin at her face, tied into excruciating pain, and look at her bloated body wrapped around the pen. Despite how mangled it is, there&#39;s no blood, and I can leave her like this as long as I wanted. I remove the pen and her organs reconfigure with a squelch. I place her down and she takes half a step before falling over and rolling on her back, taking deep breaths. I pat her gently on the head and leave the room. I head downstairs and grab a plastic container, then bring it back upstairs and put it on Lindsey&#39;s night table. Lindsey looks up at me, fear in her eyes, and I feel the need to reassure her, &quot;That wasn&#39;t even your actual punishment, but rest assured, you chose the small punishment, not torturous. I only did that because you were fighting back. Listen to me, and you&#39;ll be fine.&quot; (Hey, I never said I was good at reassuring). She lies there breathing heavily, before bowing her head and muttering, &quot;Ok.&quot; I smile and move her into the container. &quot;Your actual punishment will begin in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
I wake up as light streams into Lindsey&#39;s room, and stretch. Looking at the night-table beside me, I see Lindsey&#39;s huddled naked form still in the container. Smiling, I tap the container, &quot;Rise and shine!&quot; I sing, as she rolls over, a worried look overtaking the peace of sleep. She sits up and watches me as I move closer to her. &quot;Here&#39;s how this is going to work, you take the punishment, then we&#39;ll see about what we want to do afterwards. I&#39;m personally thinking that if you&#39;re good I&#39;ll leave you small but still consider myself avenged and not subject you to any more punishments, but we&#39;ll see if my mind changes. Lindsey gulps silently and nods. Your punishment is pretty simple, I tell her, &quot;What is it?&quot; She asks timidly. Rather than respond, I grab her lightly by her shoulders and bring her over to me. Then I pull back my pants and underwear and drop her in before snapping the band shut, locking her inside. I can feel her squirming against me as I get up and begin to head home. After all this, Lindsey will surely be more humble.<br />
<br />
The day progresses without any more incidents, I get home, play some video games, go shopping, do some chores, all that boring stuff. Lindsey&#39;s squirming keeps me entertained through the boring parts and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a living hell down there. Far from as bad as the pain exhibited  upon her earlier, but still not comfortable. At the end of the day, I fall asleep in my bed and wait as Lindsey goes still. I can still feel her heat against me, and as I fall asleep, I decide that tomorrow I&#39;ll...</p>
