<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was only a few minutes later when Gina pulled up to a quiet spot near the beach, they parked their car in a area surrounded by bushes and trees.<br />
<br />
Gina turned to the twins “alright gang we’re here” both of the twins won’t frilled at being at the beach, Max wasn’t looking forward to being covered in sand and having the hot sun shine down on him for a couple of hours, and Ricky was still annoyed that his brother hasn’t turned him back into a boy.<br />
<br />
They all got out of the car, Max zipped up his bag with the Chronivac in it and it put on the backpack while Ricky slipped his shoes back on and hopped out the car, standing next to the car made Max realise how much taller he really was now while Ricky felt uncomfortable standing around wearing a skirt as the gentle sea breeze brushed against his legs made him feel so open and that he wasn’t wearing anything at all.<br />
<br />
The trunk of the station wagon was open as Lannan and Gina were searching through their luggage to get appropriate beach wear for them and the twins to wear, the twins themselves were standing by the front of the car, Ricky had his arms crossed under his boobs with a fed up look on his face and Max was using his new height to appreciate the beauty of the beach.<br />
<br />
“Come on Max, take that device thing out and turn me back into a boy, being a girl fucking sucks”  whined Ricky.<br />
<br />
Max looked down at his twin brother and he cupped his own ear “huh sorry I couldn’t hear you from down there” he teased as there was now a seven inch height difference between them.<br />
<br />
Before Ricky could angrily respond, the twins heard the trunk of the car close, Lannan was on the right side of the car and he began walking into the bushes and trees “come on Max, we’ll get changed in here”<br />
<br />
While on the left side of the car, Gina began walking into another part of the same Forrest with tress and bushes “come Nicki, sweetheart we don’t have all day”<br />
<br />
Ricky shook his head before he jammed his finger into Max’s chest “this ain’t over” he scolded before he went to follow Gina.<br />
<br />
With a smirk on his face after embarrassing his twin brother, Max ran into the Forrest to catch up with Lannan, when he found his dad he was shirtless and only in his boxers, his big hands were on the waistline of the boxers as he was ready to pull them down.<br />
<br />
The thirty eight year old man who was previously a woman had a lean build, his torso was muscular, his arms and legs were defined, he looked like he could star in a romantic tv show that was aimed towards older women and the bulge in his boxers was hard to ignore which was unfortunate for the disgusted Max.<br />
<br />
“Think fast!” Said Lannan as he stopped with taking off his boxers but instead he threw Max his red swimming trunks, Max had a solid blush across his face “thanks dad” he muttered as he grabbed the trunks.<br />
<br />
With a wink Lannan said “no problem son” he than pulled down his boxers prompting Max to quickly turn around before he saw his mom turned dad’s penis.<br />
<br />
Max quickly slipped his socks and shoes before he pulled down his shorts and boxers, he swiftly pulled up his trunks feeling uncomfortable with his penis being out so close to a family member and he was in public, he removed his shirt and he stuffed his clothes into his backpack to hide the Chronivac before he slipped the backpack back on.<br />
<br />
Lannan than patted Max on the shoulder “come on Max, let’s not wait up for the girls because we know how long girls take to get ready” Max couldn’t help but almost laugh at the irony as his mom was notorious for taking ages getting ready.<br />
<br />
Lannan and Max than made their way down to the beach.<br />
<br />
A few minutes earlier with Gina and Ricky, Ricky was sick of Gina walking endless through this Forrest to find a spot for them to get changed, finally she stopped “Aw this spot is perfect” it was covered by bushes and a massive tree blocked the view from the beach.<br />
<br />
Ricky started to feel a bit nervous as the thought of someone catching him naked especially a boy while he was a girl seemed like his worst nightmare “are you sure this place is hidden, d-mom” <br />
<br />
Gina was taking off her boots and removing her socks to reveal her recently pedicured and pink painted toe nails “don’t worry honey, there won’t be any peeping toms” she said softly,<br />
<br />
He just sighed as he got to taking off his sneakers and socks so we could get this over with, Ricky took off his hoodie and he blushed when he saw that his breasts were very noticeable under his white t-shirt and a little bit of cleavage was showing.<br />
<br />
As he was looking down at his cleavage and wondering how he got into this mess, Gina wrapped a towel around his waist, Ricky turned around to see Gina also had a towel around her waist “Urm mom what’s the towel for?”<br />
<br />
With the towel around her waist Gina pulled down her jeans to  her ankles before taking them off and leaving them on the ground  “it’s so we can get dressed and we don’t have to see each other’s Fu-Fus”<br />
<br />
“Yuck did she just call our pussies Fu-Fus” he thought to himself as he cringed, while painfully thinking about why his dad turned mom would call vaginas ‘Fu-Fus’ he accidentally watched as Gina pulled down her black panties, he blushed seeing her panties and he instantly turned around.<br />
<br />
Ricky than silently pulled down his skirt and panties while he thought about ways to get revenge on Max for putting him in this situation, once he was bottomless Gina walked over to Ricky “here’s your swimsuit, I got it for you before we left, do you like it”<br />
<br />
She was holding up a black low cut bikini with full back bikini bottoms “yeah I love it mom” he said with gritted teeth just to please her, Gina smiled as she handed the bikini over to Ricky.<br />
<br />
First thing Ricky done was pull up the bikini bottoms so he didn’t feel as exposed, he then took off his t-shirt and he saw his black bra for the first time, his face went even redder “I can’t believe I’m wearing a bra, I can’t believe I have freaking boobs and I can’t believe I’m a fucking girl, this is the worst shit ever” he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
He failed at removing his bra, he had hands all over his back but the inexperienced fourteen year old boy has never removed a bra before in his life so he struggled with unclasping the bra, he was getting frustrated but that’s when Gina came up behind him and unclasped the bra for him “there that should be better sweetie” said Gina.<br />
<br />
He could feel the difference as his breasts were now not supported by the tightness of the bra “thanks mom” he said softly with back still turned to her.<br />
<br />
“Let me help you honey” said Gina, Ricky just stood still as Gina took off his bra before putting on his black low cut bikini top, she tied it up from the back for Ricky.<br />
<br />
He gulped as he looked down and saw that the low cut bikini top showed off an uncomfortable amount of cleavage “hey turn around I want to see how it looks on you”<br />
<br />
Ricky did and he was shocked at what he saw, Gina was standing down in nothing but a  yellow string bikini bottoms, her breasts were bare, they were full and perky which was surprising as she was a woman in her late thirties with two kids, her nipples were small, Ricky’s face was a dark shade of scarlet after seeing his dad turned mom’ breasts, he quickly avoided looking at her.<br />
<br />
With a smile on her face Gina said “Aw my little girl looks so pretty and grown up”she said before she went and put on her yellow string bikini top, she noticed Ricky’s face was red so she walked over to him and rubbed his shoulders “is something the matter darling”<br />
<br />
He looked at Gina, he didn’t know if he could ever look at his dad the same way again after everything goes back to normal, he was traumatised “Erm yep but it was just your… never mind”<br />
<br />
Gina looked puzzled “my what?” She than thought about for a second “come on Nicki, you can’t be serious, we’re both girls, we’ve seen each other’s breasts hundreds of times”<br />
<br />
Ricky cringed “alight mom let’s just forget about it” he wanted to never think of Gina’s breasts again so quickly wanted to move on, the two of them started gathering their clothes into a bag.<br />
<br />
With her phone held high and her arms around Ricky’s shoulders Gina smiled as she said “selfie time” Ricky forced a smile as she took the picture, Gina clicked on the photo “Aw that’s gorgeous I’m putting that on instagram” <br />
<br />
Ricky didn’t like how much of his and Gina’s cleavage was in the photo and that it was getting posted on social media “yeah it’s cute” he said thinking that would be a response must girls would go with as him and Gina started walking on the beach.<br />
<br />
The beach was semi busy with families, college kids and surfers around the shore, Max snd Lannan were sat under the umbrella drinking sodas they got from the car, Max smirked seeing his twin brother in such a revealing bikini knowing he was hating every moment of it.<br />
<br />
“How’s my two favourite girls” said Lannan as he approached both of them as he gave them both a peek on the cheek, Ricky sat down next to Max with his cheeks as bright red as a rose “nice bikini sis! How was getting dressed with mom” he teased.<br />
<br />
With a sigh Ricky said “I’m gonna kill you” he was quite dry with his delivery.</p>
