<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the weekend and Christmas was only two weeks away, Stephanie was definitely excited for it, she was especially excited to see what Travis would get her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Stephanie said to herself out loud for Travis to hear. &quot;What is it?&quot; Travis asked. &quot;It&#39;s going to be my first...our first Christmas as a couple!&quot; Stephanie said as she hugged Travis and they spun around happily. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m really lucky to have you in my life.&quot; Travis said as they headed to Stephanie&#39;s house, she got excited to see Jackie&#39;s car parked in the driveway.<br />
<br />
Opening the door, Stephanie rushed in to give Jackie a hug. &quot;I&#39;m so happy to see you, how are gran....I mean....how are your parents?&quot; Stephanie asked reluctantly. &quot;Oh, they&#39;re fine Steph, I&#39;m happy you were able to meet Ann&#39;s family though. We just want you to feel like you&#39;re part of a big family.&quot; Jackie said holding closely to Ann.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I am. But growing up I always kind of wished I had a fancy Christmas like the ones I saw on TV. I wish it could be like that.&quot; Stephanie said as she accidentally brushed her hand against Jackie&#39;s where her ring was.<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie&#39;s clothes were transformed from what they were wearing to vintage clothes from the 1940s or 1950s. Ann was wearing a green bow tie neck dress that buttoned up and was wearing pearls, while Jackie was now wearing a red Christmas bow knot collar swing dress. Meanwhile, Stephanie and Travis were aged down to at least ten years old and Stephanie was now wearing a red embroidery bubble sleeved smocked dress with white bows on the side, and Travis was wearing a long sleeved plaid buttoned shirt with a black vest over it and a red bow tie to complete it.<br />
<br />
&quot;WOW! My Christmas wish came true!&quot; 10 year-old Stephanie cheered as she spun around in her dress. &quot;Stephanie O&#39;Toole-Kirkman, you are in very big trouble young lady.&quot; Ann said waving her finger at her now young daughter. &quot;Oh, angel...leave her alone, she just wanted a Christmas that she never got.&quot; Jackie said putting a soft hand on her girlfriend&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Also, let&#39;s admit it, you and I have never looked lovelier.&quot; Jackie smirked as Ann gently held her girlfriend&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, why did the magic affect me too?!&quot; 10 year-old Travis demanded to know. &quot;Because I wanted to see if you looked cute when you were little and you do.&quot; Stephanie said batting her eyes at Travis who blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Are those my presents under the tree!&quot; Little Stephanie said rushing up to the tree. &quot;Ah, Ah! Stephanie, is it Christmas yet?&quot; Ann asked in a sing-song voice. &quot;No mommy, I&#39;m sorry. May Travis and I go to my bedroom? Please? He and I are little right now, we&#39;d just play...and maybe play house.&quot; Stephanie asked shaking her dress back and forth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...alright, but only if Travis promises to keep our little Steph happy.&quot; Jackie said as she and Ann eyed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise Mrs. and Mrs.....uh, Steph&#39;s mommies, to make Steph happy because she&#39;s my girlfriend.&quot; Travis said with a blush as Stephanie giggled and gave Travis a kiss on the cheek as she pulled him into her bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;This whole situation feels like something we would do.&quot; Jackie said when they were left alone and continued to decorate the tree. &quot;I know, but it&#39;s Stephanie who made the wish. You could just wish us back to normal, right?&quot; Ann asked. &quot;I could, but Steph never really got a Christmas like this at 10, did she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she didn&#39;t. Oh, it just makes me want to cry.&quot; Ann said trying to hold back her tears as Jackie came to wipe them away with a tissue and kissed her on the face. &quot;We&#39;ve been doing good, raising her all these years, right?&quot; Ann asked. &quot;You know we have. She tells us whenever she can that she loves us as her moms.&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t wait for that wedding paper to confirm it.&quot; Ann smiled. &quot;Neither can I.&quot; Jackie said as she and Ann sat down on their couch to make out for a little bit.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Travis was feeling a little nervous, he was 10 years old again with his girlfriend, in her bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter Travis? Have you never been in a girl&#39;s room before?&quot; Stephanie said chuckling. &quot;Oh, I have. But I haven&#39;t been in my girlfriend&#39;s house as a ten year old.&quot; Travis said. &quot;Can&#39;t you get your moms to wish us back to normal?&quot; &quot;I can, but I want to play house first.&quot; Stephanie said as she looked at Travis with pleading eyes. &quot;Okay, let&#39;s play house first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Travis and Stephanie pretended they were a married couple with Travis pretending he just got home from work while Stephanie was pretending she was painting and on the computer. &quot;Hey, you can&#39;t have more that one job.&quot; Travis said. &quot;With today&#39;s economy, I think I should have two jobs.&quot; Stephanie said laughing under her breath. Stephanie then had Travis pretend to do chores outside the house while she did the ones inside. &quot;Why can&#39;t we do it the other way?&quot; Travis asked. &quot;We can talk about that another time, it&#39;s time for dinner.&quot; Stephanie said as she pretended to make a dinner for herself and Travis. &quot;I&#39;m full, now let&#39;s go to bed.&quot; Stephanie said as the two climbed up on Stephanie&#39;s currently large bed. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to give me a good night kiss?&quot; Stephanie asked as Travis kissed Stephanie on the lips. &quot;Uh, uh...you gotta kiss me on the lips.&quot; Stephanie said as Travis slowly kissed little Stephanie on the lips which made her giggle again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now I want to do one more thing before we change back.&quot; Stephanie said as she pulled Travis out of the room with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommies! Mommies! Can I do something with you two?&quot; Little Stephanie asked. &quot;Of course sweetie, do you want us to play with you?&quot; Jackie asked. &quot;Or maybe turn all of us into teenagers to have some drinks?&quot; Ann chuckled thinking about getting drunk with her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. I want....to marry you two.&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;You want to what?&quot; Jackie asked confused. &quot;I want to pretend to marry you. I know, I&#39;ll probably be a very big girl when you two get married, so I want to pretend to marry you and what better time to do it than Christmas time?&quot; Stephanie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, are you sure?&quot; &quot;Yes, the last few years, have been the greatest for me. My mommy and daddy barely cared about me. But ever since you two came into my life, I&#39;ve always thought of you as my moms. You may not have raised me since I was this little, but can we just &#39;pretend&#39; that you did?&quot; Stephanie asked.<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie couldn&#39;t say no to Stephanie at any age and let her pretend that she was marrying them. Stephanie got a book off the shelf pretending it was a bible and made herself look like she was reading it. &quot;Do you Ann O&#39;Too....O&#39;Too, uh, Ann O...Tool take Jackie Kirman to be your wife?&quot; Stephanie asked them as Ann and Jackie looked at each other lovingly. &quot;I do.&quot; &quot;And do you...Jackie mommy  take Ann mommy to be your wife?&quot; Stephanie asked Jackie. &quot;I do.&quot; Jackie said nodding her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! Then you two may kiss the other mo...I mean...kiss the bride!&quot; Stephanie said as Ann and Jackie lovingly kissed each other and little Stephanie ran over to give them a hug. Ann, Jackie, and Stephanie all hugged without noticing that that Stephanie and Travis were changing back to their normal ages but all of them were still wearing the Christmas clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, how come we&#39;re still wearing these?&quot; Travis asked. &quot;I said you looked cute when were were ten and you look handsome all grown up like that too.&quot; Stephanie said as she kissed Travis on the lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you two have anywhere to be? Ann was going to fix some meatloaf for dinner.&quot; Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No mom, I think we&#39;ll join you for dinner.&quot; Stephanie said as she and Travis helped Jackie decorate while Ann went to start on the meatloaf.</p>
