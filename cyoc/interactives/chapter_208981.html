<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jillian scanned the nearest houses, most were filled with happy couples with children of various ages. But there was Rose&#39;s previous husband, now grandfather, Alex, who was now a lonely old man. He looked after Rose, but Jillian&#39;s memories told her that was only when Rose&#39;s parents were busy. Otherwise he was an old man who kept to himself, and was growing grumpier from doing so--Rose was apt to mention. Feeling a bit responsible for having put Alex into the position of being alone by taking his wife away from him, the least Jillian could do is perhaps give him a chance to start over again and give him a gaggle of friends his new age to compensate for the loneliness she&#39;d inflicted on him. And he&#39;d likely be a cute little brother to boot, and she found she could make him friends with Jeff&#39;s little brothers.<br />

<br />
Jillian looked over the statistics and satisfied with her choices, pressed enter and Alex Nolan stopped rocking in his porch chair for a moment before standing up as though he&#39;d seen something down the street which concerned him.<br />
<br />
Alex Nolan&#39;s trip back through youth Jillian noticed started with his posture. It went from being slightly stooped, to slowly becoming straighter by the moment. Age spots, wrinkles, and some grey hairs also began to disappear, smooth over, or darken as he left his seventies for his sixties and then re-entered his fifties. Soon, the elderly old man was looking rather like an older middle aged man who while not the most impressive man, seemed to have taken care of himself enough to pay attention to. His loose button down shirt soon began to tighten as muscles began to slowly re-inflate, and his pants now seemed to fit a bit better on his lower body. At about the time he&#39;d hit the period where he was about to re-enter his forties, Alex pulled at his collar, flapped his shirt a bit, before quickly unbuttoning his shirt, untucking it, and exposing his tight wifebeater underneath, before he took that button down shirt off entirely. This left him with just a wifebeater and pants which had morphed into jeans, his sneakers had become work boots, and of which now seemed to become a bit stained with oil grease, as though he were working on old cars as a hobby in his spare time--something her memories were now telling her was true. His hair now was more pepper than salt, and Alex stood with a bit of self-assuredness that even Jillian had to admit looked rather sexy.<br />
<br />
As forties were traded for thirties, only a few strands of grey hair were even apparent, and Alex&#39;s muscles seemed to have recovered to where they&#39;d been at their highest definition. He now looked like a rather sexy father to Jillian&#39;s teenage eyes--one she wouldn&#39;t mind oogling at when no one was paying attention to her.<br />
<br />
That kind of rough-hewn and unpolished attractiveness however started to erode as Alex left his thirties and re-entered his twenties. No longer covered in oil grease, it seems that he&#39;d now grown younger to where he no longer had the free time to work on old cars as a hobby, but instead his wife beater grew thicker until it&#39;d transformed into a sleeveless shirt that allowed him to show off his shoulders and biceps. His jeans were well-fitted and his boots turned back into rather clean sneakers. His hair thickened, especially as he approached his early twenties and became almost shaggy. And his muscles shrank a little to look still rather impressive, but less thick as they had in his thirties. At this point Jillian was starting to think of Alex no longer as &quot;Mr. Nolan&quot; as she had before now, but instead as her slightly cocky and insanely over protective older brother in college who would sooner chase Jeff away, than allow him or anyone else to ever consider letting her date. Jillian was actually rather glad that she&#39;d decided to make Alex her little brother, because as far as older brothers went, he definitely wasn&#39;t what she wanted from a sibling.<br />
<br />
From here on out the transformation began to erode away the gains that Alex had had as an adult. He re-entered his teenage years with his muscles deflating almost like a balloon losing air. He went from a well-built High School Senior to a reedy High School Freshman rather quickly. His hair grew a bit longer until it covered his ears before garnering a trim at the same time he re-entered middle school and lost almost a foot in height rather suddenly. Puberty undid itself and soon the shorter, thinner, and now younger little brother was looking more of a boy than the man he&#39;d been a few moments ago, and growing cuter by the moment as he lost more height and his facial features completely rounded off by this point. Soon, a prepubescent boy of 11 or so stood in clothes that had shrunk to fit his shrinking form. His sleeveless shirt gained sleeves to turn into a normal blue t-shirt with a picture of the Pokemon Cyndaquill on it. His jeans shortened into jean shorts, and his slick sneakers became scuffed and more worn from constant wear and tear. A few more shrink spurts, landed the preteen back into the single digits of life and Elementary school, everything shrinking with him until he was a cute little boy of five with an upturned button nose, and dimples in his cheeks. Jillian soon saw her much younger brother standing on Rose&#39;s porch, looking off at the departing ice cream truck that was leaving the neighborhood with a certain sad longing. Alex was in T-Ball and often Alex would go over to Rose&#39;s house after his t-ball practice because Rose&#39;s new little brother--Jeremy (formerly the elderly Rose & Alex&#39;s son) and him were on the same t-ball team, and Alex would wait until Jillian got home to go home. On days when he didn&#39;t have t-ball practice, Alex and Jeremy would often find an excuse to hang out with Artie, Max, and Cheyenne, who were in their class and quickly becoming their good friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on squirt, time to head inside,&quot; said Jillian.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I didn&#39;t get an ice cream cone...&quot; moped Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got ice cream inside,&quot; countered Jillian, feeling far more comfortable as older sister. And with the promise of ice cream inside, Alex hurried down the steps and rushed past Jillian to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t even think of trying to open the freezer without me!&quot; called Jillian as she followed her new little brother into the house.</p>
