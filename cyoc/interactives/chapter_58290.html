<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">14 Year old Sarah was a cute girl. She had light blond hair, a pretty face with freckles, she was rather short but had a good body, she had a cup breast and was starting to develop a figure. She was out in the forest playing when suddenly she tripped down a hill. As she got to her feet she cried in pain as she realized that her foot was broken, she saw a tree and limped over to it to rest. Sarah sat down and looked around at the part of the forest she was in, then she saw something odd, it was a giant hole. Curious she got up and limped over to the hole, she looked down to get a better view but leaned to far and fell in. As she fell she realized how deep the hole was, she shut her eyes waiting for death but it never came, instead she landed on something very soft. She opened her eyes to see what she had landed on and it turned out to be a giant spider web. She couldn't believe it. Sarah tried to get up but couldn't because she was stuck to the web, she continued to try to get out when suddenly she herd some one coming, she looked over to see a giant spider creature coming to her. The lower half of the creature was a spider but the top half was the appearance of an adult woman with purple skin, she was very beautiful, a perfect figure, large breast which where covered by what looked like a metal bra, her face was perfect but she had fangs and her eyes where glowing red. Sarah got the breath to speak , she asked where she was, surprisingly the Spider creature spoke English, it told her that her race ,the aracmians, had arrived on earth 100 years ago and that there entire race was female. She also mentioned that there warriors had been killed recently and that there queen had demanded that they find new warriors to train. She then told Sarah that by falling into there hole she had just &quot;volunteered&quot; to become one of them and be a aracmian warrior. Sarah screamed no but it was too late. The aracmian shot a web at Sarah and began to wrap her in a cocoon, soon all of her body was covered like a mummy she could still see out of it and she could still breath. Next the aracmian walked over to her, bent down and sunk her fangs into her waste, Sarah cried in pain but there was nothing she could do. Once the spider creature was done she stepped back and watched. After about a minute Sarah felt the changes begin. First her rear began to grow and shift, it grew larger and larger until it was the shape of the butt of a spider, next she stared to get taller, as she did her hips became more curvier, Sarah guessed her skin was changing color too, she felt her small breast tremble as the began to swell, they grew to b cups, then to cups, then to big firm dd cup jugs, by now she was the aracmians height as her her arms grew longer and her hands grew bigger and her fingers more feminine, she felt her face change and her mouth hurt as her teeth transformed into fangs. The changed stopped and the cocoon began to dissolve revealing the newest aracmian. &quot;Stand up Haras&quot; Said the aracmian. Sarah or Haras now stood up and admired her new body, it was almost the same as Ydas(witch is the name of the aracmian that transformed her). &quot;What now?&quot; asked Haras now appcepting that she was to become an aracmian warrior. &quot;Now you must create a team to lead, are there any humans you have in mind?&quot; Asked Ydas. Haras smiled. &quot;Just a few&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Sarah's back yard he younger brother and sister and friends where playing. Her Brother Zac was 10, her sister Lily was eight, both had blond hair like she did, Lily had a friend Jane who was playing with her, Jane was also 18 and had dark black hair. Watching over them was Jenny, Sarah's best friend , she was also 14 and had red hair, also watching the kids was her other friend Max, he had brown hair and had been Sarah's friend forever, he had a small crush on Jenny. They where all playing a game together when suddenly webs shot out from every where and grabbed them all. They all began to scream but no one was around to hear. They where dragged into the woods where Sarah had gone for a walk in as they looked up they saw giant spider creatures looking down at them, one of there faces looked familiar, then they all realized that it was Sarah. Haras explained what had happened and told them what she had to do and told them that she had picked them. She then told the other aracmians to wrap them up in cocoons. she then bit each of them and they began to change like her. She remembered that there where only female aracmians and that Max and Zac would both transform into females. Zac felt his chest getting warm as two breast started to grow, they grew to a cups, then to b cups then to c cups, and then to firm dd cups like Haras, next he began to get taller as his butt got bigger and morphed into a giant spider butt, he felt his face change and his mouth began to hurt as fangs grew in, his arms grew longer and his fingers grew thinner, his hips got curvier as the changes slowed down. Jenny felt her butt morph into a spiders ass as her small b cup breast began to swell like balloons into full dd cup breast, she began to grow taller as her hips became more curvy, her arms grew out as her face changed and her fangs came in. Max felt his privates shrink as his hips became curvy and his butt transformed, he grew taller  as two buds showed up on his chest, they began to jiggle as they grew to dd cup breast, his arms grew and so did his fingers, his fangs came in as his face changed and his skin changed to purple. Lily and Jane transformed at the same time in the same order. First there hands grew bigger as there arms grew longer, they got taller, then there butts changed into aracmian asses. next there breast grew to dd cups like all other aracmians. Then there fangs came in as there faces changes into sexy beauties, there skin turned purple, there hair stayed the same color as at flowed down to there asses. Now they where all aracmians. The cocoons dissolved and Caz, Ynnej, Xam, Ylil and Enaj stood up and accepted that they where now the Warriors of the aracnian army and that Haras was there leader. &quot;What now?; asked Ynnej. &quot;Get some sleep, we began training tomorrow&quot; Said Haras.</p>
