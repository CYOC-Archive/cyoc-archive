<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“BAM! SLAM!”<br />
<br />
It was another one of those mornings, Colin bracing himself for every loud bang coming from upstairs, trying to drown out that screaming match between his mom and Alex, the reverberations from the stomping feet and slamming doors vibrating milk in his cereal bowl.<br />
<br />
“COLIN!” His mother shout for Colin with excess indignation in her voice leftover from her verbal battle with Alex. She came barging into the kitchen, her arms stuffed full of clothing - girls clothes.<br />
<br />
“Damn it.” Colin whispered under his breath as his mom made her way to the cupboard to fish out a trash bag, stuffing it full to bursting with all the clothes she’d snatched from Alex’s secret stash.<br />
<br />
“Colin. Tell your brother I want every last piece of frilly skirt or bra or whatever in the trash when I get back from work!” She bellowed down at her thirteen-year-old son, red rage steaming on her face.<br />
<br />
“Okay, mom… I’ll make sure she kno-“<br />
<br />
“She? SHE?” His mom shoots a frantic glance at him, “HE! Your brother is a boy, damn it! A boy!”<br />
<br />
As she yells that, she seems on the verge of crying, leaning her head against a kitchen cabinet, holding her face in her hands.<br />
<br />
“Your brother is sick, okay? He’s just unwell… he’ll get over it… he’ll get over it…” She sobbed, trembling a little as she picked herself back up, hiking the garbage sack of clothing behind her. “I’ve got to go. Just… Tell him I’m doing what’s best for him… I can’t get a word in edge-wise with that kid, he trusts you. Maybe you can get him to understand.”<br />
<br />
She shot Colin a mournful face, as she stood in the doorway. It was the sort of face of someone who just saw and accident or saw someone they loved sick and deteriorating on a hospital bed. A pining irritation beset every motion of her body as she shut the door, leaving her son to deal with his cereal, and Alex upstairs.<br />
<br />
Colin waited to hear the sound of the engine igniting, the bump at the end of the drive-way as his mom pulled away. Leaving his cereal for later, he began the march upstrairs, an eerie quietness lingering from the open door of Alex’s room as he approached. Scatter socks and women’s underwear littered the hall as Colin stepped towards the doorway, gently tapping a hand on the open door before finally slinking his way in.<br />
<br />
And there was Alex, the 16-year-old transgirl not muttering a word or even acknowledging her brother’s entry. Her head was held low, a completely blank expression plastered on her face as she sat on her bed, remnants of her woman’s clothing collection strewn around everywhere. Amongst the chaos of whatever fight she and her mom had, night tables were flipped over, blankets and covers were ripped off the bed, even her favorite poster “The Lion Prince” poster was torn in two, the shreds draped over the TV across from her bed. Colin approached, gently sitting down next to her, fishing for something to say.<br />
<br />
“M-mom said…” His trembling voice paused, not sure how to continue the sentence. His hands fumbled in his lap, legs shifting awkwardly as he fought to find some sort of verbal bandage that’d make everything feel better.<br />
<br />
“… food…? I’ll make you something to eat, … okay…?” Colin tilted his head towards Alex, thinking he caught his sister faintly nodding. He got up excusing himself from the site of the outburst, jogging into the kitchen and gathering up all the ingredients he’d need to make the only thing he knew how to make.<br />
<br />
Within minutes, the counter was messy with butter and cheeses, Colin wiping the sweat from his brow as he completed the most meaningful grilled-cheese sandwich of his whole life. He spatula’d it onto a plate and made his way back upstairs, gently knocking on Alex’s door again as he found his sister again, fiddling on her phone.<br />
<br />
Her thin form shook a little, acknowledging the shellshock from this morning’s argument with her mother. Her short brown hair bobbed upwards, eyes peaking up from her phone for a moment as she spotted Alex setting the plate on her lap.<br />
<br />
“I used a ton of cheese… It’s extra cheesy” Colin added, sitting down on the bed next to her again, back in the same position he’d just found himself in ten minutes ago.<br />
<br />
“I can… um…” The boy cleared his throat, “I know where mom put the clothes… I can get them back and hide it in my room – I have a big closet, and we can just say you got rid of them and…”<br />
<br />
Colin paused again as he noticed Alex, starting to lean against his shoulder, her phone in one hand and a piece of grilled cheese in the other. Colin felt her trembling body reverberate against his, Alex slowly bringing the sandwich to her lips and taking a bite.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, really…” She barely whispered, her voice sounding a little hoarse from all the shouting. Alex spoke to his mom using her boy voice and to him using her girl, but this was a bit different… he could tell she was trying really hard to sound like a girl – harder than usual. “I’d really like… to watch that movie… you know, the Lion Prince. I have the DVD under the bed…”<br />
<br />
Colin nodded, getting up and fishing the DVD jacket out. He knew where it was. This wasn’t the first time they’d watched it together. The old, animated classic was sort of a comfort movie for the both of them when their mom got mad.<br />
<br />
The boy inserted it into the TV’s DVD player and pressed play, the booming African flourish filling the room as he sat back down next to Alex.<br />
<br />
“Look.” Alex whispered, nudging her phone towards Colin, clearly wanting to show him what she’d been transfixed on for the last couple of minutes.<br />
<br />
“Yiffr?” Colin asked, his sister’s head nodding as it rested on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
He’d never heard of this app before. On the screen was something familiar though, a 3D model of a lioness, her proportions very realistic, but still reminiscent of something he’d scene before.<br />
<br />
“Is that Nadia?” Colin asked, eliciting another tacit nod from his sister’s head perched on his Shoulder.<br />
<br />
Nadia was the lioness from the movie they were watching – the main lion’s love interest. That poster that laid ripped up on the ground featured her, and the 3D model of the character on the screen still had the same charm translated into a real-looking lion. Underneath the visual display were all sorts of digital nibs and nobs adjusting all sorts of body proportions and the like. Colin didn’t dare mess with it, it looked like Alex spent a while making the model look right, and to him it really did look dead-on. Below all that was a last, big button reading “Go Wild”.<br />
<br />
Before Colin could ask what it was, Nadia pressed it. The display on the screen changing to… some sort of progress bar? It was, and sitting above that bar was a box stating the current status was “Stage 0”. Before Colin could ask about it, Alex gently pulled the phone away towards her, a tiny glowing smile appearing on her face.<br />
<br />
“Could I, ask you some more favors?” She said as she picker her head off his shoulder, finally looking him in the face.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah, sure.” Colin nodded, a wave of relief washing through his body as his sister’s tone grew a bit stronger.<br />
<br />
“I know it’s weird, but… could you, ugh…” A little blush appeared on her face, “Could you cook for me a bit more…?”<br />
<br />
“The sandwich wasn’t enough?”<br />
<br />
“The sandwich was nice. But I’m gonna need more.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, okay, sure. Another sandwich?”<br />
<br />
“No.” She shook her head, “Something more substantial, you know? Meat.”<br />
<br />
Colin tilted his head in confusion. Meat? Colin knew she was trying to keep look more feminine so she swore off protein dense meat a long time ago.<br />
<br />
“Meat? I thought you were a vegetarian… I mean.” Colin stopped himself. “I mean… you eat cheese and milk sometimes… but I can’t remember the last time I saw you eat meat.”<br />
<br />
“It’s something I’ve gotta get used to.” She said with an encouraging smile. “Just like, look through the freezer and cook up whatever… make sure it’s a lot too. By that I mean. If you think it’s too much, it’s not enough. Get more.”<br />
<br />
Colin’s head was roiling with questions, the boy getting up and turning towards his sister as he tried to think of something to say. Why meat? Why so much? What do you mean ‘get used to it’? So many questions swirled on the tip of his tongue, that he couldn’t say anything.<br />
<br />
Fine. If it would make her feel better, he’d do it.<br />
<br />
He climbed down the stairs back into the kitchen, rummaging through the fridge to try to find out what they had that he might be able to cook.<br />
<br />
Bacon, breakfast sausages. Those were pretty tasty and seemed pretty simple to cook even though he’d never done it before. There was some left over fried chicken from a few nights ago that he could heat up, but more substantial things like fish or chicken breasts or steak was beyond his cooking abilities.<br />
<br />
Colin spent half-an-hour at the frying pan, battling the hefty portion of food, trying to turn it into something edible for his sister. He balked at the final saucer-plate stacked up with meat. His sister was never gonna be able to eat all this, and even if she could she’d get really sick.<br />
<br />
He climbed back upstairs with the super-sized plate of food, handing it to Alex who gladly took it.<br />
<br />
“Thanks!” She flashed a toothy grin at Alex, patting the bed beside her, inviting Colin to watch the rest of the movie with her.<br />
<br />
Colin did just that. He’d missed a bunch of the beginning of the Lion Prince, but he’d seen it so many times now, it didn’t matter that much. His eyes trailed from the screen as he watched his sister heft up a piece of bacon, chomping down on it.<br />
<br />
Colin felt her quake beside him, that first bite of meat clearly not agreeing with her as she cleared out a cough from her throat.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think I cooked it enough… Sorry, I’m bad at cooking…” Colin apologized, only for Alex, to gently squeeze his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“N-no. It’s good… It just feels a little weird eating meat again.” She reassured him.<br />
<br />
Colin nodded back to her, letting her contend with that Olympic portion of meat he’d made for her, focusing back on the movie.<br />
<br />
As Alex ate, she did seem to keep the food down better, the girl beginning to down strips of bacon in one bite before slowly started to peck at the fried chicken he’d reheated for her. She surgically picked off the breading and skin, tearing through the meat of the chicken breasts with her fingers before bringing it up to her mouth and swallowing it.<br />
<br />
“Ahnn…” She huffed, her belly grumbling as it neared capacity, Alex rubbing it a little as she picked up her phone to check on it again.<br />
<br />
Colin caught sight of the screen out of the corner of his eye. The progress bar had progressed. 35%. It didn’t seem to move for a few seconds until Alex scooped up some more chicken into her mouth. 37%. Another bite. 40%. The progress bar seemed like it was in tune with Alex’s food intake. But… how could that happen? It had to just be a coincidence.<br />
<br />
Colin tried to return his focus back to the movie. It was one of his favorite scenes, the one with all the lionesses lounging around, licking each other and their cubs. Damn - why’d they have to make them so pretty? He’d had a crush on them since he was six, and being so enamored with those cartoon lionesses was a secret he’d swear he’d take to the grave.<br />
<br />
However, as much as he tried to ignore Alex, he couldn’t help but notice her hip starting to rub against his. Was she getting heavier? It felt like she was displacing more of the mattress below her, springs creaking as Colin’s smaller body slid towards the depression in the mattress her butt made.<br />
<br />
“They look so cozy, don’t they…?” Alex commented on the movie with a strange rumble in her voice, the guttural vibrations blending oddly with her emulation of a soft, feminine voice. Colin felt her hand wrap around his shoulder, tugging him in close to her as she smiled down at him with a long-toothed grin. Her little brother couldn’t quite make out what was wrong with her teeth. Her front incisors were far more pronounced, taking on the shape of a row of sharp canines.<br />
<br />
Colin’s head got tucked right underneath her arm, his face shoved up against her body. She felt astoundingly warm, her body an engine overheating on an that excess of fat and meat she was consuming. With that warm came sweat. Colin could smell it on her, moisture seeping through her loose-fitting T-shirt as it started to press hard against her slim form… as if it were suddenly way too small.<br />
<br />
“H-hey, quit it!” Colin huffled, finding it really difficult to free himself from her firm grip. It was her armpits or her body or… something that was starting to smell ripe, a simmering scent bubbling up from her wet T-shirt, tickling the air in his nose. It did smell like he remembered Alex smelling, but there was far more to it than just that. Her pores seemed to be weeping out a savory, salty, and acrid scent, way too strong to just come from her! Maybe it was all that meat finding nowhere to go in Alex’s body so it was seeping out her sweat glands… but no, there was this strange admixture of musky stench he just couldn’t account for. It didn’t smell like Alex and it didn’t smell like the fatty meat she was eating. All he knew was that it didn’t smell human.<br />
<br />
Alex looked down on her little brother with a smirk on her face, the sweaty trans-girl lifting up one of those breakfast sausage to his lips, bifurcating it in between her sharp teeth like it were made of butter. “Just snuggling a little! You know, like we used to do!” She giggled as she swallowed the second half of the sausage.<br />
<br />
Colin rubbed his nose trying to rid himself of Alex’s musk, “Ugh… but you’re really stinky. Did you take a shower this morning or… even this week? You didn’t smell this sweaty like five minutes ago…” The 12-year-old eyed down the diminishing plate of food he’d made for her then peered back at the phone sitting on her lap.<br />
<br />
“85%”, read the progress bar. 85% to what?<br />
<br />
“Alex, you should hold off on eating all that…” Colin nervously suggested, watching his thin sister’s belly start to bloat out with food, almost making it look like she was pregnant. “You’ve never eaten meat for the last couple of years so it’s not gonna agree with you! You’re gonna get a really bad tummy ache… you might throw up!”<br />
<br />
Alex smirked in response, turning towards Colin as she kneeled on the bed, lifting up one of the few remaining sausages and slicing through it with her teeth. “I appreciate that you worry about me… really that’s what makes you so sweet.” Alex explained, reaching up a hand to rustle her little brother’s hair. “But you don’t have to worry, I’ve thought about this for a long time. It’ll all be okay.”<br />
<br />
Even though Alex said that as sincerely as anyone could, Colin had an ominous feeling wrinkle through his spine. “Alex… what’s the thing on the phone for? It says 97% now… is it doing something to you?”<br />
<br />
Alex stroked her little brother’s shoulder, smiling as her rumbly girl voice spoke out, “Just watch. It’ll be okay. I’m never gonna do anything that won’t make you feel good, alright?”<br />
<br />
Maybe mom was right, maybe Alex really was sick! Colin scooched himself off the bed as Alex hefted up the last sausage on that play, holding it up to his mouth as he stuck it inside. This time she didn’t bite right through it through. She flashed another smirk towards her little brother as she tilted her head back suckling that last slab of food into her mouth and down her throat without chewing!<br />
<br />
Colin could have sworn he saw the outline of the sausage press against her esophagus until it disappeared into her torso. The phone buzzed, the progress bar reading “100%” as a new window popped up. “Adequate mass consumed. Beginning Stage 1 changes.”<br />
<br />
“O… oh-…” Alex groaned, biting her lower lip with those canine teeth of hers as her belly rumbled violently. She collapsed forwards on the bed, one arm straining to reach forward as the other cradled her belly, the girl finally looking up towards Colin with an utterly frantic expression on her face.<br />
<br />
“Ugh… I told you this would happen!” Colin backed away, watching his sister suffer the worst stomach cramps he’d ever seen. “Just, stay right there! I’ll get a bucket, a really big one!”<br />
<br />
Alex shook her head “no”, eyes starting to tear up as she abruptly jerked her rear high on the air. She began panting, hot, desperate puffs of steamy breath escaping her mouth as she stretched her back even more, arching her butt as high as she could as she let out a pained, rumbling yowl. “Ahn- AghnnYAAGGHH!”<br />
<br />
A fissure of crimson red ruptured the back of her jeans, the denim tearing like wrapping paper as a flesh-colored protrusion popped out from it like a jack-in-a-box. A pressurized smattering of blood spouted out from behind her, straining the floor and walls in red as that thing growing from her rear just got longer and longer, extending rhythmically as a tassel of tawny brown fur sprout from the tip like a paintbrush.<br />
<br />
A tail. Colin was frozen, petrified where he stood as his eyes darted to his sister’s new addition then back to her face. The tail bobbed up and down fitfully, the elongated spine starting to thicken with muscle as her jeans began to rip even more, the ruined fabric starting to lose its grip on her waist and dip down her thighs as a thin trickle of blood oozed down her inner legs, staining her panties and bed sheets.<br />
<br />
Alex’s mouth was agape as trembling wails escaped through those sharp teeth. Her mouth clamped shut as she suddenly jerked her upper body into a yoga “child position”. Her arms trembled as her lower body began to erupt with loud pops and snaps. It sounded like someone cracking their knuckles but 20 times louder, Alex’s legs suddenly snapping back just above the heel, bones in her feet starting to squeeze together lengthen as the femur in her upper legs visibly became squatter.<br />
<br />
Her stance widened, the transgirl’s jeans tearing to shreds as her panties could barely keep their grasp around her thickening rear. Her underwear was dripping wet, her erect cock tip starting to peak from over top the lacey hem of her undergarments as a desperate stream of piss erupted out onto the bed sheets. It reeked harshly of ammonia, that steady hose of piss growing more intense along with Alex’s cries as her arms underwent the same changes.<br />
<br />
“SNAP!” her wrist crunched and got displaced, “CRICK!” ligament and muscles shifted before bulking up, the skin on her arms growing taut as inhuman muscles cocooned her limbs in a digitigrade structure.<br />
<br />
“Alex! ALEX! Can you hear me!? What the fuck is happening!?” Colin shrieked, mustering enough bravery to step forward and clutch Alex’s shoulder. He could feel it so vividly. Her deltoids bulked up as the ligament’s insertion point shifted further down her arm. Her flesh was seeped in a layer of sweat as slick as vegetable oil, her shoulder blades cracking and crunching as they repositioned her arms to always be held out perpendicular to her chest… as if they were to be used for walking…<br />
<br />
“K-ColynayaGGH!!” Alex yowled a growly screech as her lower lumbar sundered, her bones and nerves fizzling and cracking as her legs were hiked up closer to her belly, excess skin from her shortened femur fusing against her hip, completing a distinctly feral looking hindleg. Alex couldn’t do anything to resist it. She hiked herself up on all fours just like any animal would, her hips-turned-flanks bulging and sizzling as they bulked up with bestial strength.<br />
<br />
Colin’s mind raced for a solution as he watched her sister’s entire anatomy shift across species. Feline. Her butt looked feline. It looked just like his family’s pet cat but bigger and mostly hairless. Alex’s chest began to fill in with muscle, her torso taking on more barrel-like proportions as her sweaty T-shirt strained hard to contain growing body. Sickening clicks and rattles fizzed up from her spinal cord as her body began to extend, Alex gaining 6… 8… 10 inches in length as she groaned out for Colin.<br />
<br />
The boy stepped back and looked at her face, goosebumps running along the back of his neck as he watched her face shift little by little. Her nose widened, the skin blushing a deep pink before the tip darkened to black, her nose extruding outwards, tugging her mouth along with it. A short muzzle developed as her ears were dragged up by the tips by a pair of unseen hands, the tell-tale feline tips developing, stretching the ears to the top of her head.<br />
<br />
Then the yowling stopped, Alex’s shacking body starting to calm down as she settled in place, hunched over on all fours a top her bed. Her body was steaming as if it were just taken out of an oven, the changes slowing to a crawl until nothing seemed to be shifting at all anymore. This was Alex now.<br />
<br />
Colin had long since backed up to the door, his hand fiddling with the handle, flirting with the idea of locking Alex inside and calling 911, but even he couldn’t believe what had just happened… and the most unbelievable part was that dopey feline smirk growing on Alex’s short muzzle.<br />
<br />
The four-legged human chimera arched her haunches upward, putting her weight on her new hindlegs before stretching out her forelimbs. The bed creaked underneath her as her weight shifted, bedsprings audibly snapping underneath her as she rose to a quadrupedal stand as natural if she were always a cat. Her tasseled tail whipped, she careful lowered herself off the bed as looked towards Colin, licking her chops.<br />
<br />
Colin realized by now that the best time to leave would have been five minutes ago. The boy frantically turned the knob, readying himself to fly through the door, only for that heavy leonine body of Alex’s to instantly slam the door shut, pinning Colin against it and her.<br />
<br />
“Collliiinnn…” She said with a deep purr, the bottom of her muzzle nuzzling Colin’s scalp as he got caught in the inferno of his sister’s new body. Perched up on her hindlegs, she was even bigger than she used to be, that stretched out T-shirt that was barely hugging her chest squashed up against the boy’s face, forcing all that sweat and that sebaceous oil to press right against Colin’s nose.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t just stink anymore; it was a weapon. The boy could hardly breath with how humid the air was, all the steaming, musky girl scent flooding into his nostrils, assaulting him with that smell!<br />
<br />
Deep inside that admixture of aromas, he could still vaguely smell Alex… or at least what he used to be, but now it was getting crowded out. Her new smells were obnoxious, meaty sweaty stink mixed in with harsh, wet animal perfume. It clawed at his senses, begging – no – demanding attention as Alex rubbed her feral chest up against her brother’s face. Her flat chest dimpled that T-shirt, erect nipples rubbing against her brother’s cheek as he purring rattled against him.<br />
<br />
Colin tried pushing her away, only to find his hands digging into bare skin covering rock-hard muscle. Her skin felt supple and raw and lush, nothing like hers used to feel like… nothing like a human’s.<br />
<br />
“Oh, ff-fuck yes. Pet me…” Alex groaned, her purring vibrated against Colin’s face, the boy’s hand sliding along her sweat-drenched hairless animal skin, rubbing lower down her side, feeling the alien curvature of her feline features. Colin felt Alex’s paws shift from holding the door shut, wrapping around his back until the feral chimera rocked backwards, taking her brother along with her.<br />
<br />
Colin fell on top of her with a wet slap, his legs straddling her torso as she hugged him flush against her body. She arched her head up and started licking him across his scalp, glazing his head in hot, seeping licks of lion-scented drool. She did it giddly… greedily, as if she’d always wanted to groom like a cat her whole life, leaping at the chance to do it now.<br />
<br />
 Laying there a top her transfigured sister, her tight grasp hardly allotted him any free degrees of movement. Aside for her purring and breathing, mixed in with the pounding of her heart, Colin could also hear the emotional flourish of that one romantic song from the movie… the part where the lioness, Nadia, just looked so pretty...<br />
<br />
“Hah… ahn…” Colin whimpered, sticky webs of his drool mixed in with Alex’s sweat connected Colin’s tongue to that stretched-taut T-shirt hugging his sister’s feral chest. He know that scene from the movie from memory – how playful and excited she was to see her mate, how sexy and needy she looked. He clutched her slick body hard, digging his fingers into her soft but stolid feral hide.<br />
<br />
Was this how Nadia felt in real life? How she smelled? Colin felt like he was there, transported into the movie, laying there snuggled up with Nadia.<br />
<br />
Colin couldn’t help it, he was loosing all sense. He tugged down his shorts, his erect member popping free and jabbing against the underside of Alex’s pert belly. No, not Alex – Nadia. He was there. He was really there. He couldn&#39;t bear to imagine mating with his sister... but Nadia was different. Her searing hot tongue sloshing licks against his forehead, her strong body and feral heat. She hugged onto him tight, her purrs growing into a rumbling growl as her hips jerked in time with Colin’s loins.<br />
<br />
He lasted only a few seconds, his cock splurting his seed all over Alex’s hairless, feral skin, the thirteen-year-old moaning and shivering as his ejaculating cock head rammed against his sister’s lush, feral underbelly.<br />
<br />
For minutes he just laid there hugging her, eyes closed, listening to her rumbling purrs as she continued to groom his hair. It could have been hours, Colin transported to that jungle in the movie with Nadia, his little body cuddling with hers like he’d always wanted.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Alex’s tongue pulled away for a moment, that muzzle returning to his head only to plop something down on top of it. Colin woke from his sex-induced torpor, realizing Alex had just dropped her phone on his head.<br />
<br />
The lioness that looked like Nadia was still on the screen of the Yiffr app, the new progress bar reading, “To Stage 2.” displayed on the screen. Alex had turned into a feral chimera of animal and human but wasn’t close to being done yet. Her head was still mostly human, her hands hadn’t shifted entirely into paws, she hardly had any fur, and she had much more to grow. The app was asking to feed her more food, then it would change her more.<br />
<br />
Colin shivered as his flaccid member pressed against something that wasn’t soft lion-like skin down there. It was rigid and hard… but smaller than his. Colin nudged his cheek down against her chest, lifting his belly high enough above Alex’s to spot what it was.<br />
<br />
It was her dick, and it was the only thing that had grown smaller from her transformation. It looked oddly human on that broad lioness groin of hers, the head oozing with whitish goo. She’d gotten off to this just as much as her brother did.<br />
<br />
Alex’s huge tongue lapped across the boy’s cheek drawing his attention back to her. She had a grin on her muzzle, a content smile oozing with lascivious bliss. She knew this was going to happen. She wanted it to happen. She never wanted anything more – ever.<br />
<br />
She slid a paw-like hand off Colin’s back and pointed a short index finger towards her open maw. “Mooorrre.” She growled, puffing a blast of meaty lion breath against his face. She wanted more changes, so she wanted more food.<br />
<br />
He shouldn’t want this. Here was his sister so desperate to be a female, she’d turn herself into an animal! He’d watched the “Lion Prince” with her so many times and maybe had an inkling she had a thing for Nadia too, but never in his wildest dreams did he think she’d wanted to be her! … And never in his deepest darkest desires did Colin think he’d want her to be Nadia too.</p>
