<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lawrence asked what was on everyone's minds, &quot;You told us before that Herodias was just <br />
a mundane cat before she became a familiar. But the way Herodias said it, SHE was the <br />
black cat that tried to make little girl Marie just after her parents' deaths to hate the man <br />
who would become her god father for failing her. That SHE was the black cat that Marie <br />
accidently killed with a hot poker and Father Gaberiel threw outside. And it's clear that <br />
Marie had remembered that cat.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If there could indeed be a thing called fate, one could say that the original fate would <br />
have been there to be four witches, and for what the witches sought to happen TO happen, <br />
and for the world to be remade into a mad house only for a new order to slowly rise out of <br />
the muck stronger than the order that the chaos had torn down. But destiny it seemed in <br />
opposition for the world to go on struggling, building itself painstaking one piece at a <br />
time. Maybe Herodias healed from that fatal encounter -after- dying, but that would make <br />
no sense given Solome's fate. Maybe she played dead. But given her relentless attitude that <br />
also makes no sense. Perhaps what made Herodias greater than she was, simply found a <br />
new vessel.&quot;<br />
<br />
1689 - March <br />
<br />
In the witch's house, the two lupman pups, one male and one female, played together on <br />
the rug. The boy pulled on the girl's super long hair making her cry out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Francis! That's not fair!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy quickly apologized. &quot;Sorry Julianna.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gaal looked on with satisfaction, before these two less-than-dogs had been determined to <br />
kill her, her sisters, and those close to them. Now they were pure and innocent as they <br />
should have stayed from the beginning if not for an unfair god.  Lilith turned her head as <br />
she coiled around Gaal looking at the small family of leoman as the lion people worked <br />
tirelessly, endlessly, and dauntlessly continued to work on and expand the house. <br />
<br />
'Before they were just drifters, vagrants, drunks, now they have a family, a purpose, and <br />
once the spell is complete, will be among the first to feel absolute freedom from this unfair <br />
universe.' <br />
<br />
The first one they changed had become the male of the group, the rest that followed had <br />
become his lionesses, and a couple had become brother and sister, a common pattern to <br />
the witch's games. <br />
<br />
The leoman family worked without complaint or word, to a point that would have even the <br />
normally altruistic leomans stunned. Even their two cubs worked with bright eyes and <br />
smiles on their faces, none showing the slightest frown of boredom.   The witches had built <br />
up their family one by one, not only working as free carpenters to continue the work of <br />
expanding the house, but also to act as physical body guards in case their magic somehow <br />
failed them.  The witches didn't comprehend how their magic failing them was remotely <br />
possible, but there was a chance they could be away when another gang of less-than-<br />
dogs attacked their familiars, and that would be totally unacceptable! <br />
<br />
The leomans did their absolute hardest not to get in the way of the unruly children, and <br />
serving in other tasks when needed. <br />
<br />
Gold Deer were ideal prey animals, if for no other reason than they had no true mating <br />
season, and could reproduce year round if need be. Hunting was thus one of the things <br />
that naturally kept their numbers in check. This meant that there always fawns in some <br />
form or another among the herds. <br />
<br />
And sometimes they wandered off. This led to an incident where the witches' charges had <br />
wanted to play with a gold fawn that had also wandered from it's parents.  When the buck <br />
found them however, it thought the worst and decided an example needed to be made.  As <br />
it ran foreword with it's horns lowered, one of the witch's leomans grabbed hold of the <br />
buck by the horns and twisted it's neck, dead. The fawn cried out and fled in terror.  The <br />
buck's pelt became a nice skin for many of the children including Joella. <br />
<br />
That was all the witches needed to know, to be sure that these leoman they had created, <br />
with reddish gold fur and crimson manes, were indeed the perfect physical protectors. <br />
<br />
'Princess' mates and kittens had of course moved in with the witches now. Princess' litters <br />
now acting as the witches eyes and ears, there was little that now happened in Glendale <br />
that these witches didn't know. <br />
<br />
 'Princess'' first mate, a plain brown cat named Cain, was only vaguely aware of the world <br />
around him anymore than any mundane cat, he knew that these humans however were <br />
making life easier for him, his mate, and his litters, so why complain?<br />
<br />
 Cain did it very odd that he didn't feel like fighting to the death over Herodias/Princess, <br />
but something about her presence made him shrug off these urges to battle... besides... his <br />
brown coat had long since turned to gray, and his muscles decayed and his body grew <br />
chubby. 'Maybe it's better something about her makes us not want to kill each other... I <br />
don't think I'd last long... anymore...' <br />
<br />
With Herodias' mates and litters as a security network, and their created leomans as <br />
bodyguards, and the geass around Joella, their familiars now (they wouldn't make that <br />
mistake again) and themselves, the witches were certain that they were effectively <br />
invincible. <br />
<br />
Glass Marie said, &quot;For Joella, and the children she shared the house with now, the 'oath' <br />
was ultimately just a game that Joella had invented on the spot. the witches had nothing to <br />
do with it.<br />
<br />
But there was one thing if the witches had found out they would have gone mad if they <br />
were not already lost in their own world. To the many mad children they had inflicted, by <br />
using them as a massive joint familiar, they had brought ORDER to them! They had given <br />
the chaos inside them DIRECTION! It had created a sense of unity and form. It wasn't a hive <br />
mind, not in the least. But it had brought a sense of clarity back to these broken children's <br />
minds. <br />
<br />
This 'miracle,' the witches barely noticed, after all, this little world was supposed to be <br />
perfect already.  They also didn't realize how it worked in their favor, since the people of <br />
Glendale stopped fleeing... and slowly began to trickle back to their home town. And new <br />
ones were drawn back to Glendale as well, either to add to their leomans, their children, or <br />
become a new family to support their increasingly large household.<br />
<br />
This would leave Joella as the sole inheritor of a surprisingly impressive estate when the <br />
witches died. But that's getting ahead of the story. <br />
<br />
It was March by the time that the hunters had their disastrous first encounter with the <br />
witches. When the spell over Glendale was only twenty-five percent complete more or <br />
less. And it wouldn't be until around ninety-two or ninety-three percent that the spell had <br />
completely changed Glendale from what it was and began to build up to expand. <br />
<br />
 Of course, Marie had no way to know this, only knowing that it was by the end of the year <br />
that it would be too late to stop the tiny snow ball from becoming an avalanche. <br />
<br />
Sadly, Draco was now in no condition to go anywhere. Kathrine had suffered a concussion <br />
and several broken bones from impacting the gargoyle from the hammer of water. And <br />
Vatican, had lost his wings, and had come dangerous close to losing his head, and with no <br />
other Gargoyles around to perform a transference ceremony, this would have left him <br />
blind, deaf, and mute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you mean dead?&quot; Betty had to ask. Maddex glared.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Glass Marie said, &quot;Remember when the assassin killed the gargoyle security? A <br />
gargoyles' awareness is housed within the very center of their beings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right.&quot; Betty nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Only Linus had suffered no crippling injury from the battle, and he was needed mostly to <br />
take care of the others. Marie had come with mostly brushes, but her injury was in it's own <br />
way the most crippling of all. She had failed. She knew there was still time, she knew there <br />
would be another chance, but that all felt so meaningless.  Such an utter defeat did not <br />
click in Marie's mind, she thought that they would win, die trying, or end up slaves.  The <br />
idea of being so utterly defeated and LIVING left her completely jarred. <br />
<br />
During the time they recovered, Linus and occasionally Marie tried to discouraged people <br />
from returning to going to Glendale... but it was no use, and those that they did <br />
successfully block simply via other than the roads, to be quickly spotted by one of the cats, <br />
and for the witches to transform them through one of the children sent with a leoman <br />
bodyguard. <br />
<br />
Joella, didn't know any of this. She knew what the witches had done to the mob of killers, <br />
but figured that had been simple self defense, like the leoman who had killed the buck <br />
whose fur she was now wearing. <br />
<br />
But she had no idea where the REST of the children, supportive families, or leomans were <br />
coming from. In no small part due to realizing this would mean realizing how awful her <br />
foster parents were, which Joella, born from idealized memories, couldn't comprehend <br />
doing. <br />
<br />
Joella DID however hear about the awful evil hunters who had sought to destroy her family, <br />
and had sought to murder her foster parents, not to mention try to destroy all the hard <br />
work the witches had done for Glendale.<br />
<br />
Joella immediately asked around of Herodias' cats of what they had seen and what they had <br />
heard in relation to these five hunters, where they had gone, and what they looked like. <br />
<br />
Taking only Le-Fay, a small black and brown kitten recently born from Herodias, Joella left <br />
the house, no being stopped, after all, the witches (rightfully) trusted Joella with their lives <br />
and trusted her not to do anything foolish.  <br />
<br />
Joella's geass, and to a small effect the trees that would soon enough act as ANOTHER <br />
protective barrier around Glendale and the witches themselves as they became living <br />
guardians, protected her easily enough. <br />
<br />
She found the battered, bloody, and broken hunters in the forest beyond the protective <br />
reach of the trees that would be recruited into Glendale's protection. They were talking <br />
among themselves, what Joella didn't hear, but she announced her presence with a, &quot;Hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
This started the hunters as a whole, good. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello little girl,&quot; Said the blue felman, a make-shift pad and bandage around her head. <br />
&quot;How are you today?&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie said, &quot;Hello child, are you lost? We can get you some help if you need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I don't, thank you.&quot; Said Joella as polite and calm and civilized as possible. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you parents?&quot; the dragon with the ruined wings and looking a little like a <br />
mummy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back in Glendale.&quot; She said simply. <br />
<br />
This caused more small starts. <br />
<br />
&quot;My parents are good people, they're nice people, they -help- people! They shouldn't be <br />
hurt for that!&quot;<br />
<br />
The hunters wondered if this girl was a victim of the witches. <br />
<br />
&quot;My parents saved me and all my friends and their families from a bunch of bad men who <br />
were going to kill us! They shouldn't be called bad people for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hunters all slowly nodded. Wondering where this girl truly came from and why she was <br />
saying all of this to them out of the blue. <br />
<br />
&quot;So please, please,&quot; the girl who had not even given her name said, &quot;JUST LEAVE MY FAMILY <br />
ALONE! Just leave us be! We don't want to hurt you so please don't try to hurt us!!! Please! I <br />
don't want to see any of you hurt!.... I... I just wanted to say that because I don't like seeing <br />
people hurt and in spite of what you did you're still people... Please. Just stay away if you <br />
don't want to get along, at least let us be.... I'm going home now, please don't follow me.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Linus wondered if this was one of the witches in disguise. When the girl began to back up, <br />
Kathrine stood up and used her good arm to grab the child. <br />
<br />
Draco's magical sense screamed at Kathrine to stop seeing the protective aura surrounding <br />
the child like a fortress, but it was too late. <br />
<br />
This contact combined with Kathrine's intent trigger Joella's geass, and Kathrine's arm was <br />
on fire, and began to spread to the rest of her. <br />
<br />
Kathrine screamed, Marie at once, ignoring that it burned her own hands began to roll her <br />
on the ground to put out the flames, Linus helped too, and to the shock of the hunters, so <br />
did Joella.... <br />
<br />
The deadly fire were put out. <br />
<br />
Everyone worked quickly and silently and when it was done, Kathrine's was shedding <br />
streams of tears of pain... If not for her time with Armando, she'd be screaming in agony. <br />
<br />
The small felman body on one side was now devoid of fur, she looked half like some <br />
strange goblin from fairy tales rather than a human suddenly without fur. <br />
<br />
Linus, Marie, and Joella helped her up. Le-Fay just watched all this confused, not knowing <br />
why the Big But Not Giant Cat had suddenly caught on fire, but glade she seemed to be <br />
okay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Joella said at last still not having given her name, BEGGING, &quot;Just live your lives <br />
and let my family and friends be!&quot; <br />
<br />
Joella ran away, no one stopped her this time. <br />
<br />
Joella had unwittingly given the witches another service... efforts to Kathrine's recovery <br />
would now add yet another month to the hero's mending on top of the months needed for <br />
Draco and Vatican to recover.... <br />
<br />
Joella returned to Glendale, waved at one of the trees, and it looked like it tried hard to <br />
wave back, it would have it down in a few months. <br />
<br />
Joella wandered the streets for a bit, looking about town. The buildings were all the same. <br />
The people were all the same. Besides some newborn lupman with odd fur. The spell was <br />
only thirty three percent complete at this point after all. But things would be truly <br />
interesting soon enough. <br />
<br />
She wandered into a book store and saw a large book with several names in it. She asked <br />
what it was about, and she learned it was a ship's book for writing down names of the <br />
crew. Getting an idea she took a large blank book promising that she'd come back with <br />
money for it later and was believed (no one had ever known Joella to lie even once to <br />
anyone). <br />
<br />
She let Le-Fay go and returned to her home, the leomans happily nodded at her as she <br />
came by. <br />
<br />
She put down the book next to a grinning monkey figurine (still in the loop of reliving the <br />
few happy memories it had when it had been a man after all these years) and the smiling <br />
fairy figurines that resembled her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey everyone!&quot; Joella cried out getting the attention of her 'brothers' and 'sisters.' She put <br />
on the captain's head that was just hanging about.  &quot;Your captain wants you to write down <br />
your names, gender, species, and hair/fur color for the ship manifest! If you don't know <br />
how to write you can just say and I'll write it in for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Intrigued by the new game the children driven mad by the witches, the two leoman cubs, <br />
the two lupman pups, and those transformed from coming into Glendale into children <br />
including Samantha and Alissa, and the former angry mob, began to wander to the smiling <br />
girl with a quill nearby.</p>
