<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they lay in the grass coming down from the high of their coitus, both the cougar and Casey began to feel strange. For the cougar, she felt her abdomen begin to rapidly distend and breasts swell with milk. Casey though, began to itch over most of his body as his testicles burned and ached, his penis painfully erect, while his spine cracked and spasmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuc... k...!!!&quot; Casey shouted, noting the timbre of his voice rapidly bouncing upward. As his back forcefully arched, he saw his erstwhile mate groaning as while, and looking to already be 7 months pregnant. Before Casey could worry about that though, he saw fine black hairs poking up on his hands, arms, armpits, feet, legs, groin, and the sides of his torso, though his fine chest hair was shedding away, leaving his pecs and abs smooth and hairless.<br />
Casey was distracted from the coat of fur sprouting up from the paradoxical overwhelming pain and pleasure coming from his groin as it felt like his balls were in an ever-tightening vice, causing him to repeatedly orgasm out load after load of jizz from a shrinking dick as his testicles pull inside him, his body purging his sperm.<br />
The cougar, smelling Casey&#39;s seed, despite looking like she was about ready to pop, crawled over and began lapping up the seed, sucking off the shrinking member. The feeling of her sandpaper-like feline tongue and muzzle of Casey&#39;s shrinking dick had the effect of slightly mitigating some of the pain of his groin. Slightly. As the cougar continued to lap, her water broke, but being a wild animal, she seemed more capable of dealing with the pains of labor than a human, able to focus on pushing the rapidly-developed offspring while still lapping at Casey&#39;s crotch, which seems to have now become smooth.<br />
&quot;Most of the pain... is gone...&quot; Casey utters in a clearly soprano voice, back arched, supported themselves on their elbows as several loud cricks and cracks went on, Casey&#39;s waist caving as the their hips did the opposite, ballooning out.<br />
Casey gasped and shuddered as the cougar&#39;s ministrations with her tongue, along with growing pressure on their chest, drove home and confirmed what Casey suspected now; he was now a she. Casey moaned as she felt the cougar&#39;s tongue in her, which helped distract from the pain from the base of her spine as she felt an alien limb touch the ground, no doubt a tail.<br />
The pressure, both on her chest, and down below, was building, crescendoing. Casey was reaching her limit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unngh... Ooohhh... Nyaaaaa!!&quot; Casey completely ignored the fact she meowed as she orgasmed, as well as the fact, she had her head rolled back, so she couldn&#39;t see she was sporting two G-cup breasts followed by two D-cup breasts underneath.<br />
As Casey collapsed, overwhelmed by her first female orgasm and much of her transformation, suddenly her hearing began to ring painfully to the point Casey finally passed out, the last thing she saw was the first of their children coming out of the cougar.<br />
<br />
Speaking of, once the cougar came down from her strange lust induced by Casey&#39;s seed, she put all her focus on delivering her young, surprised they gestated so fast. Was this another side effect of the strange water of the stream? As she pushed, she saw the last changes of the unconscious Casey, as black furred cat ears pushed out of hair that grew down to her waist as her fingernails and toenails became claws and pseudo-paw pads formed on her fingers and toes, as her feet shifted into a digitigrade shape. The cougar acknowledged her mating with the human Casey did something to make her a female humanoid cougar like her, although her proportions were different, in that her chest, belly, neck, and face were still hairless, she had long human hair, she had no muzzle or whiskers, the human had feet more like her old feet whle she had feet more like a human, and the human had four breasts compared to her two.<br />
The first baby came out, followed quickly by a second, then a third, and finally a fourth, all in rapid succession. The cougar wasn&#39;t all too focused on the how or why of the rapid labor at the moment, but more on the health, and the physical condition, of her spawn. Would they be strong offspring capable of carrying on her genes? Would they be able to hunt? Woul...<br />
<br />
&quot;This is... puzzling?&quot; as she licked off the afterbirth, she observed her offspring born from her mating with the human. There were three females and one male. The male looked just like a regular cougar, a cougar like she was before she drank from the river, but the three females were for the most part human except the black-furred feline ears & tails they possessed.<br />
<br />
Knowing she lacked the sufficient teats to feed her young, the exhausted cougar took two of the female young over to the unconscious Casey and let them latch onto her two upper breasts as she layed there, while taking the other female and the male and feeding them on her breasts. The cougar cooed in her maternal instinct, until she began to see the children growing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly, the young began to gain mass, increasing in age, gaining a (human) year every 30 seconds, until they seemed to stop at about the age of six, while the male was roughly the equivalent age, becoming a medium-sized cougar kitten. The cougar noticed that after finishing feeding the two she breast fed behaved more ferally, the mostly human female and the beastly male playing together like young kittens, growling and mewling at one another as they play-wrestled. Meanwhile, the two fed on Casey&#39;s breasts seemed suddenly disturbed by their nudity and their unconscious &quot;mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama Casey, are you alright?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why are we naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
The cougar was amazed those two knew how to speak, while the two she fed behaved more like kittens she would have reared. &quot;Did they learn... from our milk?&quot; the cougar wondered.<br />
Suddenly, one of the girls who fed from Casey ran over to the cougar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama, is mama Casey alright? She won&#39;t wake up!!&quot; The cougar cocked her head. It seemed the other two recognized her as their mother as well somehow. Did the two more feral ones recognize Casey in turn, she wondered?<br />
As those two tumbled into the concerned child, knocking her over, she got back up, exclaiming, &quot;Chell, Ajax!! Cut that out!! Something&#39;s wrong with Mama Casey!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The cougar looked at the girl and quixotically and asked her, &quot;Chell? Ajax?&quot; the cougar blinked. Had they somehow named themselves, or did Casey name them subconsciously through her milk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes, those are their names...&quot; the girl responded. &quot;...and I&#39;m Anne, and that&#39;s Fiona. I thought you knew that, mama!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The cougar made a curious growl. All of this was giving her a headache.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wake mama Casey up!! Maybe we need to take her to a hospital.&quot; Fiona says, trying to shake Casey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I found mama Casey&#39;s phone!!&quot; Anne exclaims, holding Casey&#39;s pants in one hand, and Casey&#39;s phone in the other.<br />
<br />
The cougar began to worry. These two girls possessed human intellect roughly equal to that of humans of their physical age, and for some reason wanted to take her mate Casey to some human place called a &quot;hospital,&quot; fiddling with some rectangular thing, and now, the cougar hears one of them, Fiona, opening the door of Casey&#39;s nearby truck laden with fishing gear, the odd dinging sound of the open truck door distracting the play of Chell & Ajax.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought if I could honk the horn I could get the attention of someone on the road...&quot; Fiona said sullenly to her cougar mother.<br />
<br />
The cougar was beginning to stress. She was worried more humans or going to human places would endanger them, but her children were actively trying to contact humans. At the same time though, Casey still hasn&#39;t woke up from the stress of her transformation, and that also worried her. She also didn&#39;t know what else the stream may have done to her, Casey, or their children.<br />
