<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well you look fine at first glance,” Frances commenting as she sat in Benton’s study. Arriving at the Knight Estate for the house call he so urgently requested the day prior; typically Benton didn’t see Frances Twist until Friday, at her office. Yet since the discovery of her office being bugged with surveillance; a gift from an associate working on the behalf of Jack Crawford, Frances had to do some major rescheduling as her office is swept and any illegally place surveillance devices were disposed of.<br />
<br />
“Your call from last evening,” Frances continuing; “implied that the walls were closing in on you. The tone of your voice,” Frances watching Benton pace from his desk to the nearby bookshelf; concealing the panic room Benton’s father had installed when Anton Knight had the home originally built. “But it seems as if you are itching to get something off your chest,” Frances continuing to speak.<br />
<br />
“I had a rough day yesterday,” Benton pausing to take a deep breath; “Starting with how Tachibana managed to sit herself in my office at Knight Industry headquarters, evading the security in place. Imagine my surprise to see her sitting there waiting for me.”<br />
“You didn’t do anything violent did you,” France sounding concerned.<br />
“No,” Benton pulling out his chair and flopping in it; “but I wasn’t exactly thrilled to see her waiting for me.”<br />
“Was this unexpected meeting business related,” France asking.<br />
“Personal,” Benton glancing at his emails; “it had to do with Jack Crawford, asking for my help in dealing with him.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Frances familiar with the man; “I take it the conversation didn’t go well?”<br />
“In a fashion,” Benton sighing; “Tachibana mentioned a few things that did set me off, and not in a good way.”<br />
“Care to discuss it,” Frances pulling out a note book.<br />
“It mostly had to do in regards to Frieda’s trust fund,” Benton tensing up; “the fact that Jack Crawford discovered a particular item in it. An item he has been trying to reclaim ever since I took over Knight Industries.”<br />
“Something that belonged to his family I take it,” Frances seeing Benton tensing up.<br />
“A company that makes computer chips,” Benton answering; “while it was part of Knight Industries, I discreetly had ownership transfer to Frieda as I was creating her trust fund. She doesn’t take control until she turns eighteen.”<br />
“And who controls it until then,” Frances asking; “You? Your wife?”<br />
“Lance,” Benton groaning; “it was one of those moments where having a brother proved useful.”<br />
“You still have little love for your brother,” Frances noting the way Benton mentioned his name.<br />
“Must we go down this road again,” Benton glaring; “last time that happen, I made a hole in your office wall.”<br />
If I recall,” Frances looking at Benton; “that hole was the result of finding out that Tachibana was hosting the owners of the Wang Technological Corporation. But since your bipolar diagnosis, you have had more contact with Lance, then you have had after you father retired so as not to let the world know that were’s exist. With Lance married,” Frances going on; “and expecting a child…”<br />
<br />
Benton sort of zoned out while Frances was speaking; hearing the same drivel before, Benton wondered if these sessions were still needed. Sure he was able to work out some of his problems and rage; allowing him to become a better parent and husband. Yet lately for Benton, they have become more of a chore that he was getting tired of being stuck with; however, Benton has found that talking to someone in confidence over  personal issues has helped in out.<br />
<br />
“Frances,” Benton interrupting the doctor; “I really didn’t ask you to come here so we can talk about my brother. Lately I have been stressed. You already heard the first part,” Benton feeling hesitant.<br />
“So what is the next reason why you called me over,” Frances looking at the nervous man at his desk.<br />
“Perhaps this is where Amanda steps in,” Benton getting up; “after all she is partially responsible for my having to take a Xanax yesterday.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Once Amanda joined Benton and Frances in the study, all attempts to discuss Benton went out the window. Following Amanda were three Doberman puppies each feeling energetic as they gravitated to Doctor Frances Twist.<br />
“And how long have these little critters been here,” Frances just melting as she picks one up to cuddle.<br />
“Since yesterday,” Benton grumbling; “Amanda will tell you.”<br />
“Oh knock it off,” Amanda none to amused with Benton’s eye rolling; “you know exactly why we need these dogs.”<br />
“I take it,” Frances looking at Benton’s sour expression; “that this is the other reason why Benton called me.”<br />
“If it was,” Amanda shaking her head; “it’s a poor excuse to try and win the argument over not having these dogs about. Especially after what happen Saturday evening.”<br />
<br />
Benton sulks back to his chair behind his desk as Amanda talks to Frances. Listening as both ladies are well familiar as to what happened last Saturday. With Benton soused at his brother’s place; Amanda, Lila and Lila’s sister in-law Ester left for a girl’s night out. With Frieda along with Spencer and Eric minding Ester’s three children at the Knight Estate; the butler George the only adult presence, several of Frederick Parker’s men attempted to break in. Despite having one of the best security systems in place, the would be burglars were able to thwart it by cutting power to the Estate. If it wasn’t for the quick thinking of Spencer and George and Eric, the events that took place last Saturday would of ended badly.<br />
<br />
“Well that’s the short version,” Amanda speaking; “yet you already know what happened. You were here that evening.”<br />
“Yeah,” Frances nodding; “Eric wasn’t feeling talkative after he had to kill one of the assailants. But that doesn’t explain why these puppies are here.”<br />
“That began on Sunday,” Amanda sighing; “thanks to Frieda. We were supposed to discuss this after Benton and Frieda had their Sunday outing. Yet,” Amanda trailing off.<br />
“You went behind Benton’s back,” Frances glancing at the sullen were-panther as he glares at his therapist talking to his wife.<br />
“It’s not hard to do,” Amanda smiling; “plus it gave me an excuse to restart a hobby I had with my mother. Dog breeding,” Amanda looking at the puppies as they play with each other.<br />
“Dog Breeding,” Frances looking at the were-panthress oddly; unsure where this was going.<br />
“Let me correct that,” Amanda speaking; “it involved training dogs for kennel show competitions. Some wealthy families went into equestrian, polo or golf. My mother and I preferred raising dogs. Dobermans to be more specific.”<br />
“When did you stop doing this,” Frances looking at Amanda.<br />
“It was after Benton and I met,” Amanda smiling.<br />
“We can skip over that part,” Benton chiming in; using the time to take care of some work related emails. “Frances does not need to know what we were doing,” Benton then looking coy; “or where we were doing it.”<br />
<br />
Amanda glares at Benton, she was about to make some retort over Benton’s crass remark when there was a knock on the study room door.<br />
“Enter,” Benton being brusk; seeing it was George approaching.<br />
“I apologize for the interruption,” George speaking; but there is something you might want to look at.”<br />
“What is it,” Benton feeling impatient.<br />
“It’s on the telly,” George using the British slang for television; “apparently Jack Crawford was arrested earlier today. For the attempted murder of Frederick Parker,” George finishes; observing as everyone in the study goes slack jawed at the sudden and surprise news.</p>
