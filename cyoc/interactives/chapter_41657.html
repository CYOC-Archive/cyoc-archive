<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John responded to Randy with enthusiasm, complimenting him profusely and asking for a meeting.  Randy agreed and suggested he visit him at his home.  John was a bit hesitant but Randy assured him he would be safe, that no harm would come to him and that if he was really that put off by a visit to his house, he could meet with John at a local coffee shop.<br />
 <br />
John, deciding he’d just come off as some sort of paranoid kid apologized to Randy for seeming mistrustful and agreed to meet Randy at his house.<br />
 <br />
Randy asked if John would mind sex on the first date, if they both agreed that they would like it and John had no problem with it, provided they both agreed.<br />
 <br />
Randy also mentioned that John was a handsome young man, but that he usually liked his men to be shorter ‘Pocket Bears’ with thicker beards and more body hair than what John had.  Randy liked having a smaller man he could cuddle up with in his den, wrap his furry body around, but said that he was sure that wouldn’t be a problem.  Things would work out.  <br />
 <br />
John, of course, was extremely turned on by the prospect of this near seven foot tall grizzly of a Biker Bear wrapping himself around his body.<br />
 <br />
Pocket Bear was a term John had never heard before.  Randy explained that a Pocket Bear was a hairy Bearish guy who was from five foot to probably no more than five foot eight inches in height and stout, some times rather a ‘fire plug’ type build, another term John had never heard, but needed no explanation with the other descriptors supplied in the sentence.  John, topping out at six foot one apologized for not being a ‘Pocket Bear’ and suggested that perhaps it wouldn’t work out, but Randy assured John that things would be just fine.  It was John’s handsome face and his general compatibility in his profile that Randy was interested in, not his build.  That John was a young man looking to be a ‘Bro’, interested in long bike trips with an older man and perhaps to go to Sturgis was more important it seemed.<br />
 <br />
They agreed to meet.  Two weeks later John pulled up into Randy’s driveway on his Kawasaki bike.  He parked it next to Randy’s Fat Boy Harley which was parked next to an old Chevy pickup.  It was a warm day and Randy was sitting on his front porch drinking a beer and puffing on a thick cigar.  His chest was bare and John got an instant hard-on looking at the huge muscular man coming to greet him.<br />
 <br />
“Hey John,” Randy rumbled in his rich bass, “nice bike!”<br />
 <br />
“Well, it’s nothing compared to yours, but I can’t afford a Hawg.”  John said in a rather embarrassed way.<br />
 <br />
“Nah, I started out with an import when I was in college, like you.  Couldn’t afford much, but I wanted to ride.  Some of the Bros’ get all bent outta shape if you ride an import, but a lot of them started out just like you and I did, they just don’t talk about it and burned all the pics they had of them on their ‘rice rocket’,”  Randy laughed, “because it was all they could afford at the time too!”<br />
 <br />
It made John feel better to know a Biker stud like Randy rode around on a bike like his once.<br />
 <br />
Randy smiled down at him, “So, this is a bit forward, but I believe in cutting the bull shit.  I’d love to kiss you and wondered if you’d like to.”<br />
 <br />
John looked around, always a bit on guard.<br />
 <br />
As if reading his thoughts Randy said, “No one’s gonna see us kiss, Hell, we could have sex right here on the spot and no one would see.  I’ve got 40 acres of land I planted lots of trees and built a half dozen berms and hillocks on just so I’d have some privacy and if you noticed the road to the house winds through those little mounds and forest so you can’t see the main road.  Now, how about a little ‘let’s get acquainted’ kiss?  You can tell a lot about a man by the way he kisses, they say.”<br />
 <br />
“Well, I hope my kiss says the right things about me.”  John said and before he could add to that thought, Randy took the cigar out of his mouth and pulled the young man in for a very hot Bear hug and even hotter kiss.  Randy wrapped his huge, furry, muscular, tatted Bear arms around the bean pole of a Cub and after a good thirty seconds of tonsil swabbing and beard meshing, Randy broke the kiss, but didn’t release John from the embrace.<br />
 <br />
“You’re kiss tells me that you really do like big hairy brutes like me.”  Randy said looking intently into John’s eyes.  He released the young man from his tight grip, replacing the cigar in his maw.  “How ‘bout we go ‘round the back.  I fired up the grill and have some steaks ready.  There’s some potato salad and cold beer too.”<br />
 <br />
“Sound’s good.”  John said and they proceeded to the back of the house going through it.<br />
 <br />
John was impressed by the home, comfortable and rugged, but neat, well kept and well appointed.  It was obviously a very expensive home, even with all the ‘hunter/outdoorsman’ furnishings.  By looking at the home, no one would assume that Randy was gay.<br />
 <br />
After dinner, all through which John and Randy poured out their life stories to each other, they settled in the living room being that the mosquitoes had come out and it was getting a bit chilly outside.  They sat on the couch, finishing their beers.<br />
 <br />
John yawned, a bit more than relaxed after about four beers in the course of two hours, and Randy smiled, “So, I have the guest bedroom set up for you… if you like.”<br />
 <br />
John looked at the tent in Randy’s jeans, seeing the man’s hunger and thought, “What the Hell?  Why not?”<br />
 <br />
“I don’t think the guest room would be suitable.”  John said<br />
 <br />
“Oh?”  Randy said, picking up on his meaning as if he’d said it plainly.<br />
 <br />
“No, because, it wouldn’t be nearly warm enough.”  He smiled.<br />
 <br />
“My bed is nice and warm, would you rather sleep there?”  Randy leered.<br />
 <br />
“I don’t think there’ll be much sleeping, at least not for a few hours.”  John said and Randy pulled him into another long kiss, this time adding quite a bit of skillful groping.  For his part, John returned what he got and soon, Randy had kicked off his boots and was out of his jeans.<br />
 <br />
Naked, Randy was a furry on his bottom half as he was his top and the size of the meat and meatballs between his legs took John’s breath away.<br />
 <br />
“My God!  I’ve never seen anything that huge before… well, outside of a porno mag.  I mean, I saw it in your profile, but you must have been soft or something when you took the pictures.”  John said.<br />
 <br />
Randy grinned, &quot;Yeah, I won't lie, I'm proud of it, damn proud and you're right, I was soft, my buddy snapped that shot after a long session and I just wasn't ready to be hard again.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;I wish I were hung like that.&quot;  John said a little embarrassed.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh, I've see you, you're goodly sized, now how about you take those clothes off and we can explore each other a little before we go to bed.&quot; and with that John nearly tore his clothes off.<br />
 <br />
John and Randy began exploring each other, John repeating he wished he had a body like Randy's and finally, Randy looked him in the eye and said, &quot;I think you're ready to hear what I'm about to say.&quot;<br />
 <br />
John stopped his fondling, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;As I said, I'm a guy who likes to get right to it and I think by our conversation tonight you are someone who can handle this, so I'm just going to say it; you can be like me.  In fact, I can make you like me tonight.  My question is; would you be willing to lose something for it?&quot;  Randy said and before John could ask he continued, &quot;Simply put, John, I'm a werebear.  All this fur, all this muscle, the big cock, I got it all when I was changed and you can have it too.  The loss I mentioned would be to your stature.  You know I like Pocket Bears... would you be willing to lose six or so inches in height, but gain that fire-plug body and a carpet of fur, not to mention the kind of package I got?  You know, on a shorter, stockier guy, it looks even bigger.&quot;  Randy said and waited.  He'd just put it all out on the table and hoped John was the kind of man he thought he might be.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Soooo... you're a werebear and you can make me a werebear too?&quot;  John said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;And... you can shrink me?&quot;<br />
 <br />
Randy smiled, &quot;Well, not really shrink.  Think of it as a redistribution of your mass... though for the body you want, I think you will have to add a few pounds, but that's not really that hard, you've got a bit of a beer belly goin' now and as you can see,&quot; Randy patted his own belly, &quot;that's not really a problem with us Bears, is it?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;I've gotta see some proof, of course.&quot; John said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Of course, that's the next part.&quot;  Randy said and with that began to change.  <br />
 <br />
Fur began to grow all over his already hairy body.  At first, because he was so hairy it didn't show, but soon Randy was covered in a thick pelt.  His full bushy beard almost swallowed by all the brown Bear fur.  His body began to shift and morph.  More muscle growing on top of his muscular frame, his posture changing, a muzzle growing out of his face as his ears shifted back and up on his skull, growing rounder and furry.  Randy's nose blackened, broadened and took on it's ursine shape and his lips thinned, changed color to black just like his nose as they stretched out over his muzzle.  Fangs grew over his human teeth as they pushed through his gums.  Thick claws pushed out fingernails as his fingers became the toes of front paws, yet he retained his human thumb, his tailbone pushed out and made a stubby tail and a sheath formed around his cock securing it to his furry belly, his cock did not change in size appreciably, but did change shape to that of a grizzly bear's.  With that, the changes were complete.<br />
<br />
John reached out a trembling hand to touch Randy's face and then, realizing he might be in danger of a bite, withdrew it.  <br />
 <br />
Randy growled out, &quot;I won't hurt you.  Go ahead, touch.&quot;<br />
<br />
John reached out again and touched Randy's muzzle.  The beard was still there, it was one of the things that made Randy look odd as compared to a natural bear, that and the paws which were paw-hands.  The muzzle fur was soft and Randy closed his eyes and John petted it.  John found himself drinking in the musky bear scent, reveling in the feel of the thick soft fur and realized he was hard.  This turned him on and he admitted to himself, he wanted to be this.  This was raw physical and sexual power all in one furry package.<br />
 <br />
He looked into Randy's brown eyes, &quot;So, you want me to be a pocket bear?&quot;<br />
 <br />
Randy nodded, &quot;I want you as a mate and pocket bears really turn me on.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;How would we do that?&quot;  John wondered, seeing how large Randy was, he didn't see how he could become shorter if Randy was the template. <br />
<br />
&quot;A moment.&quot;  Randy said and began shifting back to human form, a minute or two later and Randy was as he had been before, his beard was a bit longer and he seemed somewhat thinner, John commented on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Changing takes energy, when we change; we use some of our fat reserves.  Now, once you're in one form or the other, you keep your calories, but the shifting back and forth burns them.  Now, as to how; I have friends of the stature I find attractive.  Broad, muscular men between five and five and a half feet in height.  They are not werebears themselves and as to why I have chosen you over them for this, it is simply a matter of their choice.  They didn't want to become werebears.  They're Bros' and can keep a secret.  We do have some fun together, but I always use protection with them.&quot;  Randy paused for a moment and John took the opportunity to ask a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do they fit into this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Randy smiled and continued, &quot;If they donate their DNA to you, and then I donated mine, you would take on their traits as well as mine.  Now, part of what makes you perfect is that your blood type is the universal acceptor AB, and rare.  My friends, I have asked are both A and O.  What we will do is transfuse their blood into you; along with the blood we will get some other genetic material in with it from them.  After you've been transfused and it is flowing through you, I will then transfuse you with mine.  A short while thereafter, you will change.  You will grow shorter, stockier and will become a werebear.  You'll look quite a bit like I do, but you'll retain your own features, if altered somewhat by your donors.  You'll look like you mostly, but you'll be different enough so that you might look to be a 'cousin' to anyone who had known you prior to your change.  Your hair color and eye color might change a bit, your complexion somewhat, but generally, you will look like a relative of yourself and in essence, that's exactly what you'd be.  No longer who you are now, but still related to who you once were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that's it?&quot;  John said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, that's it.  You get to choose 4 of the 7 donors.  You can choose based on their looks, I have extensive photos and every one of them has donated a half pint of their blood.  I'd draw two pints from you and replace it with one half pint from the four men you choose.  Then, I'd take a syringe, draw out a small amount of my own blood and inject it into you.  Four weeks later, after some filling out with good food to fuel your changes, you'll change for the first time and when you change back, you will be a broad, stocky man with a thick full beard like my own, body fur to match mine and extremely well hung.  Of course, we will have to see about a new identity for you and I will be very happy to introduce you to biker life.  You can move in with me, we can be exclusive mates or we can be open, it's up to you as I don't have a preference.  So, what do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
John thinks for a minute and says...</p>
