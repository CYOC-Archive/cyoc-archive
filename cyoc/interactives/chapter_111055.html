<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Phoenix was the capital and largest city in Arizona. With a population of over a million and a half people. And was the sixth most populous city in the USA before the First First appeared, and the most populous state capital in the country. <br />
<br />
In short, it wasn&#39;t small, it wasn&#39;t sleepy, and it wasn&#39;t the type of city you just strolled into unnoticed, in particular when, from the average human being&#39;s perspective, there was a stuffed animal zombie apocalypse devouring the world, turning all the symbols of innocent childhood into symbols of soul stealing terror. <br />
<br />
Even if it was the middle of the night, the baby furs weren&#39;t getting and through unnoticed. And it wasn&#39;t exactly a hop skip and jump from the heavily fortified army base to the capital city. <br />
<br />
That meant going across an on major highways, and unlike Abe, they weren&#39;t about to NOT notice the little toy car full of the &#39;furry zombies&#39; driving along the highway and keeping up cars going 60 miles an hour against several laws of physics. <br />
<br />
Thankfully no one tried to run them off the road. More for the human&#39;s sake than the baby furs. But this was still the age of cell phones. And they called 911. <br />
<br />
The nearest army base... did have the slight problem of a baby fur being at their front gate now, and being on the most highway between them and the city. (Though after watching the security footage, and humans not being stupid, the former could be dealt with by giving him orders like you would any solider not to laugh or make any jokes). <br />
<br />
But the real problem for Teddy and new friends was at that this point, people weren&#39;t blissfully unaware of baby furs, and this far away from a horde of their own kind, things would not go their normal smoothness. <br />
<br />
The average police force at this point knew that physical harm was useless at best or counter product at worst with baby furs. They didn&#39;t know the loops hole Teddy HIMSELF didn&#39;t understand yet that all he had to do was MAKE a human -genuinely- heartfelt laugh to start their transformation, but Teddy didn&#39;t exactly know that either nor did any baby fur. <br />
<br />
A paddle for a good spanking had proven to ACTUAL affect them to experience pain, and the signs written to inform them where they were not allowed worked wonders with their rule abiding nature, and the police knew all of this. <br />
<br />
Teddy just hoped this sister hadn&#39;t had the baby come out of her tummy yet. He wanted to be there for her when it happened. He knew that it would be REALLY close now for the baby to come out. <br />
<br />
Jamie The Rabbit, Mari The Deer, and Teddy The Bear drove right to the big city.<br />
<br />
Teddy&#39;s sister meanwhile, did hope that wherever they&#39;d taken her brother, that they&#39;d be able to cure him. Though... there was one sliver of doubt... that Ted had agreed to the entire thing. That wasn&#39;t the behavior of a &#39;we&#39;ll infect you all!&#39; zombie, let alone some ceature that had wiped away Ted&#39;s personality, happened to have his memories, and only THOUGHT it was Ted. The idea that Teddy was in fact still Ted in every way that actually counted sincerely worried her MORE than anything. <br />
<br />
And she wished she was allowed to leave the hospitals. She&#39;d been kept quarantined, first to make sure she wasn&#39;t slowly turning into one of them, and that she wouldn&#39;t give birth to one of the furry zombies herself. It was only after OTHER pregnant women had given birth to normal human babies that she was allowed to be near people. But she was still in the &#39;sealed off&#39; part of the hospital away from regular patients, even if she wasn&#39;t sick in the slightest. Doctors and scientists testing her, her baby (who was still in the womb!), and other pregnant women their newborns who had gotten away from the baby furs without being changed in spite of interacting with them, trying to figure out WHY they hadn&#39;t been affected. But so far, had come up with nothing. Jill wished they&#39;d let her talk to Ted again. <br />
<br />
The idea that, it would kill the baby and that would be wrong never crossed their minds. <br />
<br />
Jil&#39;lith with her undead plush horse knew she couldn&#39;t just brainlessly wander the world looking for one of the stupid plush toys... She just have some fun and be lazy. Princess wouldn&#39;t like that. But luckily, her snake tail, named Junior, patted against her thigh, and her old ipad from when she as human. It was now twisted by dark magic, but still usable. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay google search, find me the first fur.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jill in the hospital meanwhile... was confused when she got a notification that someone else had signed into her google account using her password. <br />
<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
In the world of the imps, D&#39;Sam&#39;lith ran around her lab like she&#39;d downed a dozen sodas. All she wore was a pair of glasses and a little oversized labcoat, but she had as much to show as a mannequin, so it didn&#39;t matter even if she still had such concepts. She was also happy to be free of such things like &#39;morals&#39;, she still had ethics, she as Big Science Girl after all, but morals just got in the way. <br />
<br />
She was fairly unexceptional for a imp, her unique traits included a typical spaded devil tail, and horns that stood straight up like radio headset almost. Her white hair was tied back in a black bow. She also had a third eye on her forehead. Like all imps her eyes were yellow swirls in darkness. <br />
<br />
D&#39;Sam&#39;lith had been experimenting on her fellow imps, none of them were family, so it was okay by Princess&#39; One Law. She was testing the limits of what it took to know out an imp. <br />
<br />
Her experiments were a set of imp sisters with feline features, fangs, claws, tail, nose, even their horns gave the impression of feline ears. <br />
<br />
The feline like imps, opposed to most imp, had a taste in lilly-goth clothing with with lace and strings (much to the delight of Princess&#39; &#39;mother.&#39;). They hissed and snarled at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wait for when I get my claws on you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tell her big sister!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I call ankles!&quot; Said her littlest sister. <br />
<br />
D&#39;Sam&#39;lith giggled. &quot;Now now, this is for the good of imp kind! Now be sure to continue to hiss and snarl, let&#39;s see how many times I can hit you over the head with a heavy wait until I force you into regenerating your head. And let&#39;s see how many electric volts it takes until you&#39;re rendered unconscious.&quot; <br />
<br />
Death was NOT a fear any of the imps knew, considering they&#39;d had atomic bombs dropped on them near the end and they&#39;d just needed a new wardrobe after all, and Princess knew how to make them fear things worse than death if the One Rule was broken. <br />
<br />
Sami&#39;Lith meanwhile snorted and walked away from D&#39;Sam&#39;lith&#39;s lab seeing she was busy. She wore a loin cloth and an &#39;X&#39; shaped set of bandages over her chest even if there was as much to hide as on a doll. She moved with a calm and grace the belied how frustrated she was. She snorted and took out her black walkman, wanting to lose herself to some Blast Death Metal Music. Her horns were shaped like a greek wreath almost, but her most notable feature was the nine fox tails behind her, each one with a blue flamed tip.  <br />
<br />
&quot;SO! HOW DID IT GO?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sami&#39;Lith groaned and looked up. There was Jesi&#39;Lith standing upside down on the xenomorph like archway of the black hallway D&#39;Sam&#39;lith thought was a &#39;cool&#39; design. Jesi&#39;Lith wore a white apron with the Japanese word for &#39;oni&#39; engraved on it, and a large white round straw hat she was keeping on her head with her tails. <br />
<br />
 She had had black marks on her otherwise perfect rubbery red skin that looked like a mark on her face, and diamond marks on her hands and feet. Her horns were squarish and squat. She had a pair of pointed tails that actually grew from the back of her neck she had full control over. She did a triple backflip as she &#39;let go&#39; of the ceiling and gravity took hold again and she landed perfectly in front of her best friend. <br />
<br />
Sami&#39;Lith for her part saw Jesi&#39;Lith as that annoying little that she would never go away, even if deep down she didn&#39;t want her to, but would never admit that she liked having the chippy annoyance around. <br />
<br />
Sami&#39;Lith rubbed her eyebrows. &quot;D&#39;Sam&#39;lith I don&#39;t think had done any new research on seeing if we can create new imps from red clay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh, too bad!&quot; Jesi&#39; pouted dramatically. &quot;Hey! Let&#39;s go see if Oss&#39;Lith has figured out anything new and fun!&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;So much for listening to Blasting Death Metal.&#39; &quot;Fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
Back at the archway of skulls and bones arranged like a rock band cover that was the&#39; gateway&#39; that the imps had constructed, Tedi&#39;Lith wondered when her sister would be back, she hoped she bought back some new plushie animals to play with.</p>
