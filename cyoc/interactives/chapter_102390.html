<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Onto the other crisis at hand… <br />
<br />
The nurses wheeled Julie back into her room a bit later. Eric immediately rose to his feet when he saw her being carted inside. He waited outside the door, anxiously watching the nurses, Frances and Tachibana moving Julie’s unconscious body from the stretcher to the bed. And then strap her to it. <br />
<br />
More than a little nervous, Eric walked in. Frances and Tachibana stopped talking when they saw Eric enter. Whatever they were talking about wasn’t for his ears. <br />
<br />
Julie looked fine, aside from the bandage from where she’d previously ripped the IV from her arm. And it was clear the sedative was wearing off. Once back in bed, Tachibana examined her. Shining a flashlight in her eyes proved to be the thing that woke Julie fully. <br />
<br />
“What’s going on?” she asked, her words coming out a bit slurred.<br />
<br />
“Julie, you’re in the hospital.” Frances said slowly, making sure Julie understood her words. <br />
<br />
“I’m… right.” Julie tried to sit up, but the pounding in her head forced to her to lie back down. <br />
<br />
For some reason, she couldn’t see things right. They must have knocked her out again because her vision was all wrong. Being a weremer, she’d never had trouble seeing underwater. But she imaged this must be what it was like for a normal person, or another were when they opened their eyes in water. <br />
<br />
“How are you feeling?” Tachibana asked. Eric crept closer, but Tachibana held up a hand, telling him to wait a moment. Julie wasn’t aware of his presence just yet. And maybe they wouldn’t need Eric there after all if she stayed calm. <br />
<br />
“My head hurts a little, but I’m okay.” Julie was still waiting for her vision to clear, but the headache she woke up with was slowly dissipating. And as it did, she started to take in her surroundings. Dr. Tachibana was there of course, and Frances Twist. And someone else, behind the two doctors. Was it…? It couldn’t be…? <br />
<br />
“Eric?” Julie asked hopeful it was her boyfriend (and to her mind, fiancee). Eric looked to the adults, who nodded, before he went up to Julie. <br />
<br />
“I’m here Julie.” he said softly. He took her hand, and tried not to look Julie in the eye. He was afraid that if she did, she’d see through the ruse. <br />
<br />
Eric didn’t look at Julie and see the same things she saw when she looked at him. Granted she was still living in la-la land, but still. Eric had no romantic feelings for the girl holding his hand like it was a life preserver. <br />
<br />
Julie’s vision finally cleared, and she looked up to see Eric Anderson standing beside her bed. He seemed a bit off, but Julie assumed that was because they’d kept the two apart for so long. For a second, his eyes met hers. They were a darker blue than she remembered them being, but again, assumed it was due to either her groggy state or the dimly lit room. <br />
<br />
“I’m glad you’re here.” she said, pulling Eric closer. <br />
<br />
“Uh, me too?” Eric’s words came out like a question. As confident and “lovesick” as he was trying to act, he just didn’t feel a thing towards Julie. Yes he was concerned about her well being and wanted her to get better, but he wasn’t going to pull his hair out if that day never came. <br />
<br />
“Julie made her bed.” he thought placidly. <br />
<br />
“What’s wrong Eric?” Julie asked, noticing his odd tone and posture. It appeared that he was looking everywhere and anywhere BUT at her. Which didn’t make a lick of sense. <br />
<br />
“I’m just worried about you, that’s all.” he said. And at least that was the truth. <br />
<br />
“Thank you for worrying, but you don’t have to. I’m fine.” Julie patted his arm. Which felt more toned than she was expecting it to be. Maybe since his transformation his muscles had grown more? No, that didn’t make sense. He’d made the change a few days ago. But then why did he smell so peculiar?<br />
<br />
“Julie, Eric can’t stay. We need to talk to you and your parents about something important.” Frances said. She watched Julie’s face, and she could tell Julie was starting to doubt her surroundings.<br />
<br />
“Why? He and I are going to spend the rest of our lives together, he can hear whatever it is you need to tell me.”<br />
<br />
“He already knows. But this decision is for you and your parents to decide. It had nothing to do with Eric.” Tachibana lied. <br />
<br />
“It has everything to do with him! Why wouldn’t you let me see him earlier? Why did you bring that fake Eric into my room?” Julie was getting quite angry. Eric squeezed her hand, and had her focus on him. Hopefully that would keep her from getting too crazy. <br />
<br />
“Julie, this is a serious matter. You may not remember what happened, but the rest of us do. And what I need to discuss with you is for YOU to hear and act upon. Eric can’t influence your decision.” Tachibana said firmly. He was more than prepared to knock his patient out again if she got too riled up. <br />
<br />
“But…” Julie tried to protest, but it was Eric who spoke up. <br />
<br />
“It’s okay Julie, just talk to your parents and the doctor. I’ll, uh, be waiting outside?” Eric looked at Frances for confirmation, and she nodded. <br />
<br />
“Promise you won’t go anywhere?” Julie gave Eric a hard look. He returned it as best he could, and said he wouldn’t leave her for too long. That was the most “lovey-dovey” thing he could think of. <br />
<br />
“Come on Eric, you can do better than that. You know that’s not what she’s expecting you to say. God I should take an acting class or something,” he thought. <br />
<br />
“Alright. But don’t send him away again.” Julie’s gaze was now directed at Frances and Tachibana. <br />
<br />
“It is past two in the morning Julie, I think Eric would like to go home and get some sleep. His mother too.” Frances said. Julie blinked and looked out the door’s small rectangular window. And she could just make our Martha Anderson’s head, bent over as she was reading a magazine. <br />
<br />
“Oh. I’m sorry Eric.” Julie apologized. <br />
<br />
“Julie, it’s okay. If you want me to stay then I’ll stay. I don’t mind napping on the couch.” Eric said. <br />
<br />
“No, you should go home. Your mom’s probably tired, and… I don’t want to be a burden.” Julie muttered. <br />
<br />
“You’re not.” All three said. Frances slipped outside to the waiting room to talk to Martha, while Tachibana called a nurse to bring Julie’s parents in. He looked at Eric, and then gave the two a moment alone. Eric felt sweat roll down his neck and forehead. <br />
<br />
“So… are YOU alright?” Julie asked. <br />
<br />
“Never better.” Eric said. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry if I’ve inconvenienced you or…”<br />
<br />
“Julie, stop. You haven’t done anything. Just focus on getting better.”<br />
<br />
“But why am I here? No one will tell me anything! How can I get better when I don’t know what’s wrong with me?” Julie said. <br />
<br />
“It’s not my place to say. I’m just here for emotional and moral support. I don’t know a thing about medical stuff.” Eric smiled weakly. <br />
<br />
The smile sent shivers down Julie’s spine. She so needed to see him smile. Eric stopped smiling when he saw that Julie was leaning in to kiss him. Unsure if he should, Eric kisses her cheek really fast, and then says he’ll be back later. <br />
<br />
Leaving Julie very confused as to why her lover is behaving so nervously. They’d already consummated their relationship, why was he acting like that was his first kiss? Julie didn’t have a lot of time to wonder, as Dr. Tachibana and her parents entered the room no more than a minute after Eric fled from it.</p>
