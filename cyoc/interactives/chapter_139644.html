<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The water only getting slightly tepid, Jessica found herself consumed by a number of things. Her male moment had passed and it no longer seemed important that she was in a room full of naked girls, which further hammered home the point that her sexual preference had changed. Wondering if she&#39;d clicked on something when she&#39;d been designing the template, she followed the other girl&#39;s leads as she started to wash herself.<br />
<br />
Never before had taking a shower required so much. As Jeff, she&#39;d simply used shampoo for her hair and a bar of soap for her body. Now, she had two bottles for her hair, one shampoo and the other a conditioner, a bottle of something for her face, ears and neck, a bottle for her torso and everything down, and one last bottle that at first confused her, but when she figured out it was to go over her crotch, she stepped back out of the water, applied it and then shut off the shower. Joining the other girls, she dried herself off, another thing that was more than what she&#39;d done as Jeff, as it required a towel for her hair, a tower for her face and a towel for her body. And all the while, Tanya kept talking about random stuff that Jessica found herself just barely to keep up with and discovered that the other girl was nervous, which Jessica figured Tanya took her to be as well.<br />
<br />
After a minor hesitation about deciding if she should put back on her underwear, she noted a number of girls weren&#39;t, she put on her sports bra, leggings, shoes and socks, with the last one she wasn&#39;t sure how they wound up in her bag, but figured she must have put them there without realising it. Taking a scrunchie from her purse, she tied up her hair as she headed back out to the field, were she took a seat on the hot metal bleachers with the other girls. Trying to figure out if the smell the soaps and shampoos and whatever it was she used on her crotch would stick with her after she transformed back, she watched as Coach Gillian and another girl approached. The girls that were talking quieting down, Coach Gillian began by introducing the girl, a senior who&#39;d graduated the previous year as Lisa Simpkin, then stepping back and allowing Lisa to say something.<br />
<br />
Not recognising her, but figuring it was possible as there had been a lot of girls in her graduating class, Jessica listened as explained that being a cheerleader was no easy thing. That it required hard work, commitment, dedication, confidence, a positive attitude, patience, persistence, athleticism, physical strength, sportsmanship and, with a bit of emphasis, she ended with, &quot;And above all else, you must be able to follow rules and directions,&quot; before stepping back and letting Coach Gillian take over.<br />
<br />
A sharp whistle blow and the coach told them, &quot;I expect nothing short of excellence. With that said, we will begin. Now, I trust you all brought consent forms,&quot; everyone acknowledged this and she continued. &quot;Good. I will collect them afterward. Anyone that does give me will automatically be dropped. That being said, when I have made my decision, it will be final. Nine of you shall be on the main team and five shall be in reserve. The others are encouraged to try again, as there are always a couple who have to drop out because of accidents or some other problem. However, as stated before, those chosen are expected to stick with the squad for the four years they are in high school. So, lets start with something simple, an interview,&quot; and pointing to a girl, Coach Gillian made her stand up and state her name, whether she had any cheerleader experience and something relevant of her background.<br />
<br />
Each girl doing this, Jessica quickly learned that none of them had any experience in cheerleading, a couple had knowledge in gymnastics, but most were new to this. When it came to her turn, she stood and stated, &quot;My name is Jessica Kaylon. I&#39;ve never tried out for a cheerleading squad, though I have studied a bit on them to prepare myself. I have had several years of gymnastics and ballet,&quot; and sitting back down, she listened as Tanya stood and told a bit about herself.<br />
<br />
Afterward, they were led off the bleachers to a part of the field where several mats and coolers had been placed. Coach Gillian taking a stance at one end of a mat, with Lisa, now holding a clipboard, standing next, the coach blew her whistle and announced, &quot;When I call your name, step on the mat and you&#39;ll receive instructions on what to do,&quot; and blowing her whistle again, she called out a name.<br />
<br />
Never before as Jeff had she worked out so much. When it came her turn, she was put through a rigorous workout of somersaults, cartwheels and handstands. Then she was expected to do it all over again, this time with Lisa. Afterward, she stepped off the mat, joined the other girls and watched as Tanya went through a routine that was somewhat close to what she did. Grabbing a bottle of water from the cooler, Jessica began following the other girl&#39;s example of clapping and cheering on the other girls and congratulating them when their turn was up. When she was called to the mat a second time, her routine was to perform a series of stunts, but mixed in was a series of dance moves she had to perform with Lisa.<br />
<br />
After nearly three hours in the hot sun of dancing, learning and performing one basic cheer, a number of routines that showed off her gymnastic skills, among a number of other things, they were led back to the bleachers. Sitting, drinking her third bottle of water, Jessica listened as Lisa congratulated them, then Coach Gillian stated, &quot;Why rough in a couple areas, a number of you are some of the best I have seen in years. That&#39;s said, good work. I&#39;ll collect the consent forms and after you&#39;ve showered, I&#39;ll call you each into my office to tell you if you were cut or made it,&quot; and giving  a sharp noise on her whistle, she had them stand and led them back across the field back to the locker room. Inside, Jessica collected the consent form and handed it the coach. Heading for the shower, tired, wanting this over as soon as she could, she stripped without giving a second thought and washed herself in the same way she&#39;d done before. Afterward, she dried herself off, dressed and sat on the bench, debating on whether she should put back on her underwear.<br />
<br />
When Coach Gillian called her name, she tossed the skimpy garment into her backpack with the other clothes, including the strapless bra, and walking toward the office, she found herself so tired that she didn&#39;t care if she made the team or not and that the prank she&#39;d thought would be fun wasn&#39;t so any more. Inside, Jessica listened as Coach Gillian congratulated her on a good tryout, then welcomed her to the squad. Unsure how she should react, she smiled in what she hoped was a believable manner and gushed, &quot;All right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Coach Gillian, again congratulating her, explained, &quot;All girls are expected to attend a cheerleading camp from July twenty third to August nineteenth. In addition, they are expected to be at all homecoming events, whether it is a dance or sports event, among other things,&quot; and pushing a handbook across her desk, she said, &quot;It&#39;s all in here, which it is recommended you read.&quot; Taking the book, thinking that the first chance she got, she was out of here, Jessica continued to smile, thanking the coach as she did.<br />
<br />
Back in the locker room, she collected her backpack and purse. About to leave, she was caught off guard when Tanya asked, &quot;You want to come over after we&#39;re done here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not really wanting to, but also not wanting to hurt the girl&#39;s feelings, Jessica pretended to consider the offer before saying, &quot;No. I want to go home and tell my aunt the good news,&quot; and hastily coming up with something, she added, &quot;Maybe later?&quot; to which the girl, as her name was called, smiled and said, &quot;Sure,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, there won&#39;t be a Jessica Kaylon later,&quot; Jeff thought as she watched the other girl heading for the office. Wondering what sort of confusion it would cause, she tried to make her way out of the locker room, but found herself stopped by other girls who&#39;d made the squad.<br />
<br />
In the end, it took quite a bit to finally escape, usually with the promise of, &quot;Talk to you later,&quot; and the excuse, &quot;I really should get going. My aunt will want to hear the good news.&quot; Heels making a sharp clicking noise, Jessica hurried to away from the locker room and locating a quiet place, she sat and waited. Checking her phone every so often, she gave it twenty or so minutes before taking out of her purse the remote. Listening, certain she was alone, Jessica set the transmitter on a level surface. Tapping the screen to wake it up, entering the security clearance, then bringing up the necessary information, she took a couple deep breathes before hitting the revert option.<br />
<br />
Instantly, she was overcome with a sharp discomfort in her lower abdomen and groin. Growing into a painful pressing sensation, Jessica spread her legs, squatted down, reached out and grabbed the nearby wall to keep herself from falling over. Breathing heavily, she looked down and watched as her dress regressed back into the tank top it had been before. As he chest flattened, a ticklish, burning sensation erupted between her legs and gasping, she watched as her skin began to lengthen downward in what was clearly to be her dick. The pressure in her groin suddenly giving way, Jeff wondered what it was as his shorts began to reappear and the high heels morphed back into his normal shoes. Within minutes, sixteen-year-old Jessica was gone and eighteen-year-old Jeff, slowly standing, noted the he wasn&#39;t wearing his normal boxers. Quickly glancing about for the backpack, and not seeing it, he nearly screamed when somebody suddenly clamped a firm hand on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Terrified, slowly looking back over his should at the person behind him, he listened as a familiar female voice stated, &quot;I would not believed such a thing was possible if I hadn&#39;t seen it with my own eyes,&quot; as he found himself looking at Coach Erica Gillian.</p>
