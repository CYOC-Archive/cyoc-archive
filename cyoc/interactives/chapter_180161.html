<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ian I swear, for a guy as big as you, you&#39;re a walking ball of phobias.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh shut up, Drew.&quot; Drew Lansing and Ian Bronson were just two of a group of urban explorers looking through an old building in an abandoned hospital.<br />
<br />
Standing near the back was Dale Harding and Mack Rueben, the latter helping the former get some spiderwebs off of his coat. <br />
<br />
As to the four, Ian Bronson was a former lacross player, tough and well built, with light brown hair and intense blue eyes. His build was almost as impressive as Mack&#39;s, who was indisputably the big guy of the crew. He was dressed in a hoodie, a beanie cap, jeans and boots. Drew Lansing was the nerd of the group - red headed and green eyed, he had some light Irish in his background, and freckles on his face. He had previously been skinny, barely a collection of reeds physique wise, at least until Mack helped him put on muscle. Now he was lean and well muscled, though not nearly as strong as the two athletes in the group. He still however didn&#39;t feel all that intimidated out of snarking at them. He was dressed in a blue jacket, a white shirt, slacks and a pair of sneakers.<br />
<br />
Dale Harding was larger in body weight than even Mack, but it was never said he looked more impressive. Dale was obese owing to both genetics and poor food habits, his whole family being pretty chubby on average. He was handsome for his weight, though nobody really paid him much mind. He had dark brown hair and steely grey eyes, and some light stubble.<br />
<br />
Mack on the other hand was the big one muscle wise. Neatly tanned and well muscled, the bodybuilding adonis of the group Mack was known around campus for being a horndog. His dyed blond hair made quite an impression along with his tanned look and muscular build. There were some slight hints in his appearance toward slight Asian ancestry. He wore a tank top, jeans and boots.<br />
<br />
The four were out here to see about trying out urban exploration, their target being a building reportedly haunted. No ghastly shrieks or unexplained noises just yet though. All they found were some boarded up windows and some cheaply drawn symbols on the ground. Probably made by some edgy idiots trying to play ghost hunter. Lots of noise, little action.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys, are you sure this place is supposed to be haunted?&quot; Mack asked with a cheesy grin. He then stepped forward and, over Dale&#39;s hush voiced complaints, shouted, &quot;HEY! DEMONS! IT&#39;S ME, THE MACK ATTACK!! C&#39;MON AND SHOW YOURSELVES, YA PUSSIES!!&quot; He slapped his own ass several times, eagerly waiting for any hint of the angered supernatural.<br />
<br />
Dale murmured, &quot;We&#39;re sorry, we&#39;re sorry, he&#39;s an ass...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean I have the finest ass.&quot; Mack gloated and gave himself one last smack before going quiet. Everyone listened...<br />
<br />
Ian remarked, &quot;Dude, all you probably did was spook a bunch of homeless folks here. There&#39;s nothing haunting this pla---&quot; *Crash.*<br />
<br />
Everyone turned in the direction of the staircase. It sounded like something apropos of nothing crashed from the upstairs direction. Dale started murmuring some prayers in multiple languages, Drew sighed and rolled his eyes, and Ian gulped. Mack for his part? Just outright started leading the way off toward the direction. Eager as could be to have his eyes on the paranormal.<br />
<br />
Mack may not have looked like it, but he considered himself a fairly scientific man. He measured his macronutrients daily, he calculated his workouts, he maintained a tight schedule, and he routinely paid heed to what he should and should not eat in the interest of his body and mind. He acted the part of a sex starved frat bro - because that was in part what he was - but inside of that hedonistic frat bro was a surprisingly active, astute brain.<br />
<br />
And he could not believe the paranormal was real. Hence, he made a point to be as loud and disrespectful toward it as possible to make sure others got the memo.<br />
<br />
Crack. Crack. CRASH!! Mack kicked the door down once they got upstairs, ascertaining that was likely where the noise came from. He could see nothing really going on here, but he was sure this was where the noise came from.<br />
<br />
Ian was cringing and biting his lip, the muscular jock following his bro along but obviously not liking the dark and the cobwebs, and the numerous needles left laying around in open cupboards. He tapped his foot, and then smiled a little too broadly, &quot;Well guys! It looks like there are no ghosts nor ghoulies here! Shall we head off in a LESS anxiety inducing---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The dark, spiders, and now needles. I swear to fucking God, Ian.&quot; Drew chuckled. &quot;You&#39;re not nearly this weepy on the football field.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s cuz I expect it!&quot; Ian defended himself and shivered in place even still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Ian, show some backbone. Nothing here but shadows and old boxes!&quot; Mack said with a grin as he threw his hand to the side as he stepped forward and into the room...and in the process hit something off of a shelf. He gulped when he heard something like glass breaking, and everyone stepped in to investigate. Ian gulped as Mack picked it up again - it seemed to be some sort of box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, put that down!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way man, not yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, this is giving me major bad mojo vibes. I think this entire building might be cursed!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dale, everything with you is evil spirits, bad karma or bad mojo. We get it. You watched Ghost Hunters of Albuquerque and it stuck with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m opening it.&quot; Mack did indeed do just that, and everyone present found themselves drawn forward to look and see whatever it was was inside of that box. It appeared to be some odd collection of glowing green, cracked bottles. Which were now leaking some sort of increasingly odd gas and sparking in contact with the air. Each of the young men barely had time to react one way or another as they took in what they saw...followed by the reaction:<br />
<br />
The strange container exploded in a way, green smoke and energy surging out of it in a cloud of force that threw the four young men from their position on to the floor. Within their eyeshot, each of them would be able to see that the strange material seemed to be emptying from the container and filling the room. <br />
<br />
Mack felt like his limbs were leaden, barely able to move. He groaned and tried to force himself on to his feet...<br />
<br />
Dale shook in his position, hoping and praying he was not going to die. He felt...odd. Strange. Something was tingling.<br />
<br />
Ian didn&#39;t like the way that the strange energy or gas or whatever made him feel. It was like a head to toe massage feeling. Like his whole body was undergoing some sort of intensive attention. And he didn&#39;t like the way it seemed to be building toward something.<br />
<br />
Drew moaned softly, as heavy as he could, feeling like his body was being caressed, reminding him of the last time he got laid. If this was the way things were gonna end...at least he wasn&#39;t going painfully...ohh yeah, that felt nice...<br />
<br />
Their sight went dark, and they honestly thought this was the end of them.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...motherfucker...what was that?&quot; Ian managed to drag himself to his feet as he looked over where he last saw the container full of that odd energy / gas / whatever. It was empty now. He groaned and rubbed his forehead, breathing in once, then twice. Testing his lungs. He saw someone slowly standing up, looking a bit like Dale but distinctly not.<br />
<br />
It was like if Dale lost a lot of the weight that had been such an easy identifier for him. His face was more feminine, eyelashes heavier, lips slightly thicker, his arms and shoulders slim and tight and toned. His body structure also distinctly trended toward the feminine though not conclusively. His feet were hanging out of his shoes, and it seemed his hips were wider and his butt slightly larger. Dale turned and looked at Ian, &quot;Woah, dude, what happened to you. You look...like, all girly. I never saw this happen in my paranormal shows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speak for yourself man---wait, my voice?&quot; Ian felt a gnawing sense of dread as he leaped up and examined himself in the window. He saw someone vastly less muscular than usual. Longer light brown hair than usual, his beanie laying on the floor. His face was pretty - fucking pretty - and he could see a lot of the same trends that manifested in Dale. He could even see, as he examined his chest, that his nipples pushed out in very early approximations of breasts...<br />
<br />
Ian barely noticed the others starting to get up there as he hurriedly checked his groin, starting to panic, gasp and choke down a scream. He felt a sense of relief as he noticed his manhood and balls were still all there and probably in working order, as he noted when he checked them they were now incredibly sensitive - and not quite as big as usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCKING BULLCRAP, WHAT DID THAT THING DO TO ME!?&quot; Even with his voice lighter, Mack still sounded intimidating when he wanted to be as he looked at another mirror. His face was prettied up, blond hair longer, almost past his shoulders, he remained possibly the most muscular, but that wasn&#39;t by much. His nipples pushed out and looked visibly sensitive. Mack too checked his groin, and breathed a sigh of relief seeing his cock and balls were still there.<br />
<br />
Mack was pacing back and forth angrily, Ian didn&#39;t know HOW he&#39;d be able to explain this to friends and family...and as Drew got up, looking almost like an effeminate popstar popular with girls...he just looked at the way Ian and Mack were reacting, and asked, &quot;Hey, uh, have you two girls seen my urb-ex friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK YOU, DUDE, IT&#39;S ME!!&quot; Mack lashed out, shaking his fist.<br />
<br />
Drew examined himself next, looking just as stranded between male and female as the others, though trending more toward pretty boy than full on androgynous to the point of possible confusion. &quot;Well, I&#39;m hot now.&quot; Drew examined himself, doing a few moves in the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you&#39;re fucking pleased with yourself.&quot; Ian groused and crossed his arms in front of his chest. All his work, gone it felt like. His body was left like...like this. How was he supposed to deal?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess I&#39;m on Drew&#39;s side in this,&quot; Dale said as he took off his shirt, standing there letting his somewhat puffy pectorals show. His newly pretty face showing a giddy smirk, &quot;At least I&#39;m not obese any more. And I think SOME girls would probably still be into me like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mack sighed, &quot;Glad you two are looking on the fucking bright side. Well, I don&#39;t intend to take this lying down. Soon as I possibly can, I&#39;m heading back into the gym. I&#39;ll work my body back up, one way or another.&quot; He clenched his fist and scowled, which didn&#39;t exactly look as drastic as it usually did when Mack made these shows of his determination.<br />
<br />
Ian shook his head, &quot;Speaking of moving on and not taking this lying down, I say we leave this place before we get hit with any more changes. You guys good with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nods all around. And with that the urban explorers left their first exploration site substantially changed from how they were before. Each of them left androgynous, still male, but easily mistaken for a woman pending on their outfit. And whether they went ahead with such a shift in presentation would influence if there were any more changes to come. As they headed out, Dale gestured at his significantly oversized pants, &quot;I think we gotta make a stop soon and get some better fitting clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nods from Ian and Mack followed - their clothes as they were had been made for men much more muscular and differently sized than they were now. Drew however left the place with a cocky grin on his face, feeling more at home with his changed body.<br />
<br />
As they headed off to a nearby clothing store to get some new clothes, would any of them choose to present differently...?</p>
