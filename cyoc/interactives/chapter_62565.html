<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan had a restless night at the Daimler Dog Training Academy. He had a spacious enough cage, one of those with a part inside and a part <br />
outside. But there was no furniture. The only things in the cage were the usual dog things such as food dish and cushion. At least so far, Dan <br />
had been able to keep his clothes but he found himself acting more and more like a dog and he couldn't seem to control that. Finally, in the <br />
middle of the night, Dan felt uncomfortable in his shirt and tore it off. He then tore it to shreds with his mouth before he realized what he was <br />
doing.<br />
<br />
The worst part was that he was alone, except for the other dogs. He didn't have anyone to talk to. He would have even preferred having Kat <br />
around so she could explain what was happening.  Dan was frightened.<br />
<br />
Finally, Kat and their dad arrived the next day. The dad spoke with the trainers for a while and Kat slipped over to talk to Dan.<br />
<br />
Dan asked, &quot;Am I going to change into a dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat said, &quot;Well, that kinda depends. I don't really want a dog. I just want to torture you for a while. It's more fun to keep you in this limbo state <br />
so that you are aware that you are not a dog but to everyone else, you are a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan asked, &quot;So you're not going to transform my mind to be that of a dog's mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat said, &quot;Oh, I may give you some more dog like traits as we go. But I promise that some part of you will always know that you are Dan and <br />
you used to be my beast of a brother. Now you're just a beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan asked, &quot;What about my body? Are you going to give me the body of a dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat said, &quot;That also depends. So far, I'm having more fun letting you keep your human body as long as everyone else continues to think of you <br />
as a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, the trainer and their dad walked over to Dan. The trainer said, &quot;It's unusual to train animals here while they wear clothing. I know, <br />
your daughter probably thinks of him like a human and enjoys dressing him up but during training, it's important to remember that they are <br />
dogs and address their behavior as such.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad said, &quot;I understand.&quot; He was let into the cage and he approached Dan.<br />
<br />
Kat asked, &quot;You're going to remove his clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad said, &quot;For training. You can dress him up again later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan began barking, &quot;No, dad, please don't do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan was dodgy and succeeded at avoiding his dad but the trainer stepped into the cage and helped. Next thing Dan noticed was hands pulling <br />
his pants down. After he was completely naked, he crouched in a corner trying to cover himself.<br />
<br />
The trainer said, &quot;Another thing we do here, we use shock collars. I know some people protest that they are inhumane, but they are effective. <br />
You want fancier training for your dog, there are other places you can go but they are much more expensive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad said, &quot;No, a shock collar is fine. Just don't overuse it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The trainer said, &quot;Don't worry, the faster he learns, the faster we can forget about the shock collar.&quot; The trainer slipped the collar around Dan's <br />
neck.<br />
<br />
The trainer said, &quot;Alright, Kat, command him to heel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan was so bewildered that it took him a while to understand and he wound up shocked a few times. The shock was intense and Dan did not <br />
want to repeat it. So after the first few shocks, Dan learned quickly and was soon obeying.<br />
<br />
The trainer said, &quot;We prefer dogs to be spayed or neutered. It makes them easier to control and we don't have to worry about female contact. <br />
We could neuter him for you at a small charge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan barked, &quot;Please don't&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat telepathically told Dan, &quot;I'll hold that as an option to ensure your cooperation.&quot; then she told the trainer. &quot;No thanks. He can keep his balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then went through various paces. The Training Academy had some obstacle courses and other set ups so that Dan was taught to do many <br />
tricks.<br />
<br />
The trainer said, &quot;Your dog learns quickly. You could make him into an acting dog and have him do these tricks in film.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat said, &quot;I'll think about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
They were joined by some other dogs and their owners and a few of the owners asked, &quot;That dog is rather big for you. Is he a wolfhound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat thought about it and agreed. So when she got a chance, she looked through her book and found the correct spell. Dan began to shrink to <br />
the size of a beagle.<br />
<br />
Dan barked, &quot;Hey, don't shrink me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat said, &quot;I'm just making you more appropriately sized to be the family pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, the day was done and they removed the shock collar. Dan immediately tried to run away but was caught quickly.<br />
<br />
The trainer said, &quot;You're dog is very smart. It's almost like he knew that he wouldn't be shocked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat telepathically told Dan, &quot;You better keep obeying. You know I have the power to make this worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Dan heeled and Kat led him away by the leash.<br />
<br />
Dan knew that his dad was being unfaithful but for now he kept it a secret. He didn't want his dad running afoul of the witches because Dan <br />
still hoped he could convince his dad that he was in fact a son, not a pet. Then Dan hoped that Dad could help rescue both of them.</p>
