<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Davis lived only a few blocks from campus, so he knew exactly where to go.  There was a club on the edge of the university which tended to attract the gay student body.  Normally shy in a crowd, Davis made a straight line to the bar tonight, and pushed his way over to an muscular grad student he knew by reputation.<br />
<br />
Tom was a dark blonde stud, a few inches taller than average, mustached and broad-shouldered.  He was well known for his voracious sexual appetite and his search for the world's largest cocks -- the perfect man for Davis to meet tonight.  Davis introduced himself and tried to chat, but even though he was feeling supremely confident tonight, his shyness hadn't given him much conversational range for a situation like this.  Tom was polite enough, but kept checking out other guys in the room and was quickly losing interest.  Finally, Davis realized a direct approach was needed before Tom got up and walked away, so he said, &quot;I know I have something that you want to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
He asked, &quot;What does a little guy like you have that could interest a big guy like me?&quot;  Davis laughed.  &quot;Little&quot; was the last word he would use to describe himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me give you a hint,&quot; Davis said and turned to block the view from the room.  He took one of Tom's hands and steered it down to his knee.  At first Tom hesitated, but then Davis began moving Tom's hand up his leg and over his monster cock.  After a moment, Davis let go of Tom's hand and it travelled up his thigh on its own to discover the enormous nuts that bulged, hidden beneath the fabric.<br />
<br />
Tom looked up at Davis, his eyes narrowing.  &quot;This is some trick,&quot; he said, taking his hand back but visibly disturbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no trick,&quot; Davis replied.  &quot;I guarantee it.  We can go to the bathroom here and you can check out the authenticity of my claim for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom sipped his beer and thought for a moment.  &quot;No,&quot; he said finally.  &quot;Let's just go back to my place and I'll see for myself.&quot;  Tom waved over the bartender and paid his tab, and in less than a minute they were headed down the sidewalk away from campus again.<br />
<br />
It was a short walk to Tom's apartment, and mostly the trip was quiet.  Stepping into the living room, Tom turned and locked the door behind them.  &quot;OK, show me what you've got,&quot; he said, still suspicious but now sounding a little hopeful.<br />
<br />
Davis replied by unbuckling his ill-fitting pants and letting them drop to the floor, revealing a soft dick that lazily hung to his knees.  Backing it up were two giant testicles, almost football-sized as they bulged, pushing his dick out further into the cool air of the room.<br />
<br />
Tom opened his mouth and then shut it.  Getting down on his knees, he lifted the dickhead to his face, and rubbed his mustache across the tip.  A shiver of pleasure ran along its length and up Davis' spine, and the penis drew back in response.  &quot;Does it work?&quot; Tom asked, flopping it over his shoulder and placing both hands on Davis' oversized balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Davis said with a snicker.  &quot;Tested it out just today, in fact.&quot;  Tom was rubbing his face against Davis' balls now, and started licking them.  Hesitantly at first and then more firmly, Tom's tongue raked over the rough skin as he unbuttoned his pants to free his own hardon.  It seemed a perfectly respectable seven inches, and thick... but no comparison to the stiffening beast attached to Davis.<br />
<br />
Breaking away at last, Tom stood up and said, &quot;Let's get in the shower,&quot; throwing off his shirt to reveal a chiseled, fur-covered chest.  Turning, Davis saw Tom's perfect back start to move down the hallway.  Stiffening further, he followed.<br />
<br />
Happy to be free of his clothes, Davis found Tom had already stripped and had the shower started.  Tom was standing there, cock at full mast, with the curtain open.  Davis stopped at the edge of the tub and began to suck on Tom's perfect dick.  With his hands, he explored Tom's hairy tummy and perfect butt.  Finally, his own inflating rod started to interfere, pushing its way up Davis' front, and refusing to be bent.  Stepping into the shower, Davis asked, &quot;What should we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can leave that to me,&quot; Tom said, rubbing his front with soap.  &quot;I've thought about what I'd do if I ever met a cock like yours for a long time.&quot;  By now the soap had worked up to a frothy lather, obscuring his thick hair with white.  Tom turned around to face Davis.  Standing so close together now, Davis saw he had underestimated Tom's height earlier.  Tom was a full head taller.<br />
<br />
Tom put a thick, well-muscled leg beneath Davis' balls to lend support to the massive nutsack.  &quot;Now you just relax,&quot; he said.  Bracing the smaller man against the wall, he put both hands around the shaft of Davis' manhood and started to rub it against his hairy, lathered chest.  Fully hard, Davis stretched all the way up to Tom's chin.  He watched as the big stud in front of him worked this gigantic cock with his arms, hands, chest and occasionally even his head.  If it wasn't for wave after wave of pleasure as his balls bounced and his dick throbbed, Davis wouldn't believe this was happening to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh,&quot; Tom said softly as Davis panted.  &quot;I think we have a winner,&quot; he teased, swirling his palm on the top of the huge cockhead.  Davis could only gulp in reply as he felt his dick muscles clench as his balls began to unload.  Tom hugged the giant cock against his furry, soapy front with one arm while continuing his circular stroking at the very tip as shots started coming up the shaft.<br />
<br />
As each shot hit his palm, cum exploded in the shower, splashing sideways onto every surface.  Tom kept up his rhythm, jiggling the shaft against his lathered body and circling the cum-smeared cockhead with his hand.  All Davis could do was squeeze Tom's rock-hard boner, which seemed to grow a tiny bit with every spurt.<br />
<br />
Finally, after what seemed like hours but could only have been minutes, the blasts subsided.  Davis' vision cleared and he could see Tom rubbing his still-hard cockhead in the ravine between his pecs.  Tom reached out and held all of Davis against his front, and Davis caught his first full breath.  &quot;People always told me that good things come in small packages,&quot; Tom said with a laugh.  &quot;I've been so busy chasing big men, that I entirely overlooked little gems like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Exhaling, Davis felt himself slip lower against Tom's body, and looked up to see his head only reached the hairline at the top of Tom's chest.  He had misjudged Tom's height by more than he realized.  After a moment, he realized he was still holding Tom's hardon -- a good 8 or 9 inches of it he discovered, how that he was up-close and personal.  &quot;What are we going to do about you?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Tom leaned back and started spraying water out of the showerhead in every direction.  &quot;I bet those big balls have another few shots left in them tonight,&quot; Tom said, finally satisfied that things were washed off.  He threw back the curtain and grabbed a towel, heading to the bedroom.  <br />
<br />
Davis followed, drawn thoughtlessly behind his big new friend.  Stopping for a moment, Davis pulled out a towel and dried himself.  Everything about Tom seemed big -- his muscles, his mustache, his dick, even his towels!  Davis smiled to himself, pleased that he had the insight to buy that spellbook.  <br />
<br />
Reaching the bedroom, Davis found that Tom was already laying spread-eagled, fingering his balls gently.  Davis climbed up on the thicker-than-average mattress and knelt, lowering his giant balls onto Tom's hard cock.  He felt the shaft slip against their rough surface as it grew -- or he shrank.  Davis put his hands on the firm, hairy surface of Tom's chest and leaned over to kiss the broad mustache below.</p>
