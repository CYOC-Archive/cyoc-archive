<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Working the health food kiosk were this girls that looked like fitness instructors fresh out of high school. There was a tall girl with tanned skin, brown, curly hair, and brown eyes wearing a green sports bra and matching yoga pants named Addison working the register. Behind her working two smoothie machines was a shorter, pale-skinned girl with red, straight hair with more musculature than the other girls wearing a loose, tie-dye shirt and gray yoga pants named Gabrielle. The girl working the toaster oven was the shortest of the three with black hair tied in a bun, dark skin, and a blue one piece bodysuit. Her name tag said R Love (her real name is Railynne [pronounced Ray-Lynn]). All of them wore aprons and hairnets, but it looked themed. Kylie was the first to approach, genuinely curious as to what they sold and would it be any good. Addison approached her first, giving her the best service she could.<br />
“Hi! Welcome to Revive! What can I get you today?” Kylie didn’t take her for the bubbly personality, but it wasn’t a bad thing at all. She turned to face her.<br />
“Well, ideally, I would like you. But until we can get some alone time, I’ll just take a Juvenate smoothie.” Kylie gave her a seductive glance, making Addison quite uncomfortable. She waited on the side while she watched the girls work. Jax was the next one up, seeing as he was the next level-headed one out of the group. Seeing the girls, he flexed a little while he started to become erect. Railynne hopped off the food prep station and walked to see who was ordering, and she couldn’t hide her interest. She bit her lip as she eyed Jax from his ears down to the tent in his pants, drinking it all in. “What can I do for ya, big boy?” She kept her eyes on his pecs the whole time. Jax had to chuckle, she was being adorable. “Lemme get a Protein Pack Boost smoothie with a protein cake.”  They kept their eyes on each other the whole time, as if they were a couple. Leo and Ariel are busy making out, so that just leaves Gabrielle wondering what all was happening. <br />
<br />
After their smoothies and treats were bought, Kylie offered the girls a chance to join them and get to know them better. Jax and Railynne seemed to be hitting it off, so the other girls offered to make sure they didn’t get too frisky. Gabrielle and Ariel were getting along great and Leo was having fun teasing everyone. It was only Kylie and Addison that seemed to have a little friction, but this was all Kylie’s plan. They stopped at a teahouse in the food district of the mall (not the food court) as the girls started to itch. Addison started getting hot despite being in a comfortable setting, wearing comfortable clothes, drinking her favorite tea, and sitting in a comfortable spot with a breeze to her back. Somehow, she still managed to get hot and started taking off clothing. Gabrielle followed suit and started shedding layers of her outfit, leaving her in a shirt, some pants, her bra, panties, socks, and shoes. Railynne took this as an opportunity to strip tease as her and Jax were too into each other to notice the transformation. Kylie, however, did notice the girls starting to take on feline characteristics. <br />
<br />
Addison’s ears moved up on her skull as her muscles flexed and swole up a little, making her look more buff than Gabrielle. Her eyes turned blue as her irises slanted like a common feline’s. She tried to cover her mouth as her face reshaped into a feline muzzle, her hair getting lighter and lighter. Her body started growing more and more as she arched her back, feeling an odd sensation down the base of her spine. She stretched her whole body as a tail grew out, white with black stripes, just as long as her leg. Her hands started morphing, growing fur and getting fatter as she just kept feeling warmth surround her body. Her feet shifted to full-on paws with long, black claws just like the white tiger she was becoming. Her fur then grew over her musculature as her breasts and butt thickened out as well, giving her a stronger, fuller appearance. With her curly hair turning just as white as her fur, her transformation was complete as she was now just as tall as Jax, but with a burning need for sex. She began to look at Kylie differently, not as an awkward girl, but as a nice piece of meat. The two cats immediately went into a 69 right in the middle of the tea house and no one batted an eye to attempt to stop them.<br />
<br />
While Addison changed, Gabrielle took on a new look, with brown fur covering her body first. Unlike Addison, her body didn’t get more muscular, but her ears did shift. Instead of rounded tiger ears, she got more traditional cat ears with an extra black tuft on top. It looked adorable, but her change had just started as her eyes and face changed into that of a caracal, turning her from cute to almost evil looking. Her body stayed mostly the same, but her arms and legs did thin out slightly, giving her a more lean look and less like a muscle bound midget with breasts. Her tail followed her ears as her claws grew in real sharp, sharp enough to tear her clothes apart without her trying. After her transformation, she immediately made it a threesome with Kylie and Addison.<br />
<br />
Jax watched Railynne change as he helped her strip off her clothes. Her hair turned gray first with her ears following close behind. Her face gained the normal feline features with the extra fur on the sides of her cheeks. They locked in a kiss as her face shape changed and fur sprouted on her neck, spreading down to her well-endowed chest. Railynne actually gained a little fat for her transformation, but it was quickly hidden by a layer of fur. She was soft and fluffy, and couldn’t  help but feel herself as she kept changing. She grew a short, stubby tail with big hands that were actually slightly bigger than a normal human male’s hands. Her ass flared out as she actually gained a pretty good amount of booty to match her perky mammaries. Jax felt every change as he felt her up. She easily became the widest and thickest of the three girls, but she just looked so fluffy and squeezable, she quickly became the favorite. <br />
<br />
With the changes made, the groups split off. Addison, Kylie, Ariel, Gabrielle, and Leo stayed together trying to transform more mall goers, while Jax and Railynne became an item, splitting off to go find the other girls.</p>
