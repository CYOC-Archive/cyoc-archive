<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Ty arrived home, Dustin was watching a movie. &quot;Do you want to watch this with me?&quot; he asked Ty. &quot;I could start it over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No thank you, Dustin,&quot; Ty said. &quot;Maybe another time.&quot; He went up to his room, and sat at his desk, thinking.<br />
<br />
There was a knock at his door. Must be Mom, Ty thought, I suggested to her that we talk later. He hadn&#39;t been looking forward to the conversation, in large part because he felt like their roles had become reversed due to what had happened this afternoon. Now he felt that he had to be the adult in the conversation, and he wasn&#39;t thrilled by the prospect. Well, now it&#39;s later, he thought. I&#39;ll have to deal with it. He opened the door, and as he expected, June was there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mind if we talk now?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; Ty said. &quot;Come on in.&quot; He waved her to his desk chair, closed his bedroom door, and sat on his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, once again I&#39;m very sorry about what happened this afternoon,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s not right that you should see your mother like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s OK, Mom,&quot; Ty said. &quot;I knew that all the transformations I did to you, and enabled you to do for yourself, would provide you with sexual stimulation. I just think things got a bit out of hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they did,&quot; June agreed, &quot;and I&#39;m sorry for that. Ty, the things I said, I asked for, when I thought you were Mark...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Ty said. &quot;You were very... preoccupied... at the time. Your eyes were rolled up in their sockets. You couldn&#39;t even see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Ty,&quot; June said, &quot;you told me that you weren&#39;t Mark, that you were Ty. And I understood that, at that moment. And I didn&#39;t care. I wanted the same thing from Mark, or you, or any man. Ty, I&#39;m so ashamed! You must think I&#39;m just a disgusting, depraved slut!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Mom,&quot; Ty answered. &quot;I was quite taken by surprise, I&#39;ll admit, but I knew you were experiencing sensory overload. You weren&#39;t fully in control of yourself. Even just being merged with one machine was more than you could really handle. I never imagined that you would merge with both at once. Had you asked, first, I would have strongly urged you against even trying, for fear that it would hurt you. And I think you&#39;re lucky that you didn&#39;t hurt yourself when you collapsed. I&#39;m just glad that you did it when I was right there, able to help. If you&#39;d waited until i went back to my room... well, i have no idea what would have happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for getting me to the sofa, Ty,&quot; June said. &quot;I couldn&#39;t have done even that much on my own, just then. But Ty, I know you&#39;ve seen me naked, when you&#39;ve transformed me. And obviously you&#39;ve seen me with a bunch of the kinky transformations you gave me. When you first gave me those, I couldn&#39;t resist using them to masturbate right in front of you, and then I was ashamed at having done that. But this. Ty, i think this was inexcusable. I was in such a sexual frenzy that I didn&#39;t even care that you saw me, or whether anyone else did. And I wanted you! That&#39;s a terrible thing to do to my son. I don&#39;t see how I can expect you ever to respect me again!&quot; She was crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, you&#39;re wrong,&quot; Ty said. &quot;Of course I didn&#39;t want to see you like that. But I knew that you&#39;d never do such things if you weren&#39;t being pushed beyond your limits by the transformations! My only concern was to keep you safe. That&#39;s why I demanded that you transform back. And why, to get you to do it, I let you think that I was Mark, ordering you. I&#39;d never do such a thing, if it hadn&#39;t been necessary for your own good. And that&#39;s why I took away some of your abilities. I wasn&#39;t at all happy about needing to do that. But I haven&#39;t lost respect for you. You&#39;re my mother, and I love you. You made a mistake, trying to do something you weren&#39;t prepared for, but we all make mistakes at times, and we learn from them. I&#39;m just happy that you&#39;re back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Ty, thank you!&quot; June said. &quot;That means a lot to me!&quot; She stood up, so Ty did as well, and she hugged him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merging one of the machines into my human form was even better than just being the machine. I&#39;ll miss that,&quot; June said. &quot;But thank you for leaving me the rest of my abilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Mom,&quot; Ty said. &quot;I didn&#39;t like taking any abilities away from you, but I didn&#39;t want to take away any more than absolutely necessary. I still want you to enjoy transformations. I just don&#39;t want you to get hurt, and I&#39;m afraid that if I didn&#39;t take that specific ability away, you might be tempted to do it again. Heck, seeing how much pleasure you got from it makes me want to try it, but if there was a problem, who would fix me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, a while back, you told me that I was the best,&quot; June said. &quot;I want you to know, so are you.&quot; She kissed him on the cheek, then left his room, closing the door.<br />
<br />
Well, that wasn&#39;t so bad, Ty thought. He sat down at his desk again, and soon was lost in contemplation. Then there was another knock at his door.</p>
