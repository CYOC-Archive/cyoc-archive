<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After they got dressed, Eric Anderson offered to walk his girlfriend Spencer Lawson home, something his parents readily agreed to, as long as he came back so they could still take him clothes shopping to accommodate his new post-were human form.<br />
What Eric really wanted more than anything else was a chance to talk to her privately without any adults around, so about halfway to her house they stopped under a tree to chat.<br />
&quot;So, what do you think?&quot; Eric asked her.<br />
&quot;About?&quot; Spencer asked in return.<br />
&quot;All of it. It is quite a lot to take in,&quot; admitted Eric, referring to the dreams they recently shared and everything else of late.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll agree. For one thing, have you noticed our eyes are still that unique shade of green even in our normal forms?&quot; asked Spencer, referring to the physical indication of the special bond they now shared between themselves and their friend/sex partner Frieda Knight.<br />
&quot;Yeah. I couldn&#39;t help noticing mine in my bedroom mirror as I got dressed,&quot; replied Eric. &quot;I love you and I&#39;m developing more feelings for Frieda than I originally had, even after she completed my transformation into a werepanther,&quot; confessed Eric, referring to her initiating him into were society. &quot;Are you cool with us being a threesome? And I don&#39;t mean just sexually.&quot;<br />
&quot;If I wasn&#39;t, I would of said something long before now,&quot; revealed Spencer, as she leaned against Eric. &quot;Do you think it&#39;s strange that, even as enjoyable as it is for it being just the two of us right now, a part of me misses Frieda?&quot;<br />
&quot;Honestly? I&#39;m glad you said something about that. I was beginning to think it was just me,&quot; admitted Eric. &quot;It&#39;s like, I know I&#39;m here. I know you&#39;re here, but as great as that is, I feel kind of incomplete.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; agreed Spencer. &quot;Next time we see her, we&#39;re going to have to ask Frieda about that from her perspective.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope everything&#39;s going okay at the hospital with her parents. That&#39;s some heavy stuff Frieda&#39;s going through right now,&quot; said Eric, even as he put his arm around Spencer and enjoyed the moment with her.<br />
&quot;I know. Are your parents still going to sue Benton Knight over him attacking you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Far as I know, as long as it doesn&#39;t put the secrets of Moon Lake and were society at risk. I just hope them doing so doesn&#39;t jeopardize the relationship the three of us have somehow.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, we know Frieda&#39;s parents no longer can even threaten to send her away, because Frieda&#39;s next in line to represent the werepanthers of Moon Lake on the Elders&#39; Council, but I can&#39;t see where that would prevent her folks from either grounding her again or trying to prevent Frieda from seeing us somehow,&quot; said Spencer.<br />
&quot;Fat chance of that happening. Knowing Frieda the way I do now, she&#39;ll find away around that in time,&quot; replied Eric. Then he paused, thinking things over before tackling the questions he was hesitant to ask. &quot;About the dreams. Are you okay with someday becoming a mother, let alone Frieda having a daughter with me at the same time?&quot;<br />
&quot;That I will admit surprised me,&quot; confessed Spencer, while sitting up straight and looking at him. &quot;Ever since we started falling in love, even before we discovered Frieda was a werepanthress and might be able to help you become a were, I had these occasional stray thoughts of becoming Mrs. Spencer Anderson someday. Of course, with marriage eventually comes motherhood too. Do you have any idea when we actually walk down the aisle?&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all 14 now, and our 15th birthdays aren&#39;t till next year*. You two give birth to our daughters at 25, according to the dream. Knowing our parents, I would say at least sometime after high school graduation at the earliest, which would put all of us over 18,&quot; surmised Eric. &quot;After college graduation at the latest, which would put us around 22.&quot;<br />
&quot;You have plans for college?&quot; wondered Spencer.<br />
&quot;Only to do something scientific? You?&quot; Eric asked in return.<br />
&quot;Honestly, I hadn&#39;t thought about it yet, especially being sent back a grade because of my past... indiscretions,&quot; replied Spencer, thinking about all the trouble she caused in her previous school before moving to Moon Lake, and how she should actually be a Junior this year instead of a Sophomore, again.<br />
&quot;I guess Frieda will do something business wise,&quot; she added.<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; agreed Eric. &quot;I remember Frieda talking about her dream house at the diner. I guess it will be somewhere in Moon Lake, since all our folks were at the hospital to see their new granddaughters right after you two gave birth.&quot;<br />
&quot;In one version. Frieda said she also had a version where her dad wasn&#39;t there,&quot; remembered Spencer.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Hope everything works out for him. I don&#39;t really bear him any ill will. Frieda said he was probably scared when we pulled up unannounced with no security around. As long as he replaces my shirt and gives me a formal apology, I&#39;d be happy.&quot;<br />
&quot;The shirt I can see, but don&#39;t hold your breath on the apology.&quot;<br />
&quot;As long as Frieda doesn&#39;t get any additional grief from him, I&#39;ll good,&quot; said Eric, before taking a deep breath and asking, &quot;Any idea who that weird guy was in the dream?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Spencer. &quot;My folks explained to me all the stuff I needed to know about weres long before I had my first transformation, but that was the first prophecy dream I ever had, and they never said anything about Rod Serling** or whoever that was showing up in it.&quot;<br />
&quot;A genre fan after my own heart,&quot; said Eric, before kissing her.<br />
Their lips lingered together for far longer than just one kiss, even as the couple began to embrace and draw each other closer.<br />
Then Eric forced himself to stop kissing his girlfriend and said, &quot;We better get moving before we start something we can&#39;t finish in public.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Spencer reluctantly agreed, as she stood up. &quot;But any time, any place, anywhere, you handsome werepanther you,&quot; she added, before kissing him again. &quot;Especially if Frieda&#39;s with us!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ying, Yang, and Whole,&quot; said Eric with a smile, before grabbing her hand in his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Somehow, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re truly whole without her,&quot; observed Spencer, as they started to resume the walk toward her place.<br />
&quot;Maybe not, but we&#39;re bonded together even if we&#39;re not all physically together at any given moment,&quot; commented Eric.<br />
Spencer was about to respond to that when she saw a familiar vehicle drive past. It was her grandfather&#39;s car. Mike Lawson was behind the wheel, driving to wherever he was headed, but what really caught her attention was—&quot;Did you see that Grandpa had a woman with him?&quot;<br />
&quot;I saw enough to know there was somebody with him in the front seat, but I couldn&#39;t tell you what she looked like, let alone who she was,&quot; admitted Eric.<br />
&quot;Come on!&quot; yelled Spencer, as she started running down the sidewalk.<br />
Now being a werepanther, Eric easily kept pace with his girlfriend, which was one of the reasons he wanted to be that specific were species to begin with.<br />
But when they came into view of the Lawson residence, Spencer stopped in mid-step, dumbfounded. &quot;Grandpa&#39;s not here. I wonder where he and that lady went?&quot;<br />
