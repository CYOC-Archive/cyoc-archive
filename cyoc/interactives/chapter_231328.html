<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Antoine woke up finally. It was probably somewhere between 11:30 and 2... least that was what his internal clock told him with the way the sky looked outside. He walked downstairs and the more tavern/inn part of the business was doing well. Antoine saw a teen human girl staffing the front and asked &quot;Hi... how much can I get for 4 copper?&quot; <br />
The human girl blinked for a second and said &quot;Your Antoine aren&#39;t you?&quot; Antoine nodded &quot;I&#39;m Shirly, T&#39;Kiln&#39;s assistant and secretary. Go back to your room, I&#39;ll have a special staff meal brought over.&quot; Antoine feeling a little muddled in the head through hunger just nodded and went back to his room. <br />
A few minutes later there was a knock on the door as another new voice said &quot;Room Service&quot; and the way it was said sounded odd and like there was a click or two. Antoine opened the door to find a giant spider with a suit on carrying a platter of food and a mug of something and then slammed the door in the giant spider&#39;s face. &quot;Miss Shirly, I told you I may not have been the best waiter for him.&quot; <br />
Another minute later Shirley&#39;s voice spoke through the door &quot;That was Jozvm, one of our most efficient waiters. He&#39;s not about to suck out your innards or anything.&quot; <br />
Antoine opened the door and said &quot;I could see how his many arms would let him deliver a lot of food at once... I&#39;m just a little arachnophobic...&quot; <br />
&quot;You&#39;ll get used to him... Most do.&quot; A weird hand-like appendage slowly inched it&#39;s way into the door frame with a tray of food. Antoine could tell that Shirley wanted him to grab it... Antoine took the tray, and shivered as Jozvm&#39;s chitinous hairy hand brushed his and then came the mug. Antoine was then allowed to eat in peace, and it was a good meal. It was a steak of some kinda meat somewhere between beef and fish, some sorta mashed something or other that resembled potatoes, and some greens that were greens. The mug was filled with a slightly alcoholic beer. It was good and filling, and when Antoine came down it seemed like he was expected to [cleanse] his own dishes... He did, and he could tell [prestidigitation] was a marked improvement in everyway. Slightly less mana, slightly more thorough, and it felt more versatile like he could do more with it. Something about [illusions] at least if that was what his level ups implied. <br />
Shirly caught Antoine as he was bringing the plates to the kitchen and said &quot;Alright, you are going to be on standby in the basement. No customers are in there right now, so give a little knock on the doors and tell them it&#39;s room keeping. You&#39;ll then do whatever is in your power to help them with whatever they need.&quot; Now with a job assignment Antoine started the [Brothel Assistant] part of being a [Magical Brothel Assistant]!<br />
Down in the basement it was a somewhat wide hallway with doors on either side, and thanks to his [Mana Well of Lust] he could feel the whole are saturated with mana he could claim. During cleanup he knew which one was Sparkle&#39;s but he supposed he&#39;d familiarize himself with the others at least a bit. Antoine knocked on a door and said &quot;Room Service...&quot;<br />
It turns out that when you can gather ambient lust mana instead of having it shoved into your mana veins the toll isn&#39;t quite as bad. Most of the girls wanted their beds cleaned at least a bit. A few wanted to try his [Enhance Beauty] when he offered... he wasn&#39;t sure about [The Beauty of the Beholder] since it felt a bit... stronger than the others, but [Enhance Beauty] was enough. It made the makeup marginally better, helped correct posture, and Antoine could only use it 3 times in a row and it lasted about an hour. Somewhat disappointing, but from the way some of them  said &quot;Level up fast&quot; he imagined that maybe some skills would scale with his level? The rest of the day was mostly Antoine reading a book one of his co-workers had leant him to pass the time, and then when Antoine turned the next page there was a note that he read &quot;Antoine a [Wizard&#39;s] come to try to kidnap Sparkle, hide her or bar his entry quick!&quot;... Antoine wasted a second wondering how the heck that message got in there, and then saw the latch open and a thick robbed leg came down. It was trying to be brought up by a few spider-like appendages but was forcing its way down. Antoine made the rash call that he&#39;d try to hide Sparkle somehow. He ran into her room which thankfully had no other customers in it and said &quot;Sparkle, how do we hide you?&quot;<br />
Having gotten some magic affinity in the last few hours he could tell it wouldn&#39;t be like hiding her in a chest or somewhere. He could sense her just by the magic she radiated. Maybe she could possess him or something? Sparkle&#39;s eyes were technically for show, being made of energy she sensed her surroundings probably through magic however the way they looked and her posture... She seemed resigned. Like this day was bound to come. Sparkle could sense the caliber of [Wizard] who had sniffed her out. Who had sensed her extreme amount of mana through the wards and [skills] keeping detection away from outside the cellar, and the staff who doubled as bouncers weren&#39;t able to physically eject. That was the fate of most Draio who lived among the living, they&#39;d eventually get found and enslaved by a [Wizard] eventually. Sparkle could sense the magic the [Wizard] was using to enhance himself against Jozvm&#39;s might. Today&#39;s staff wouldn&#39;t stop him... <br />
Antoine looked in Sparkles eyes trying to think of something he could do. [Prestidigitation] probably couldn&#39;t hide the mana which the [Wizard] was tracking. [Enhance Beauty] nope... There were strained noises coming from outside the door... Time for a Hail Mary. <br />
<br />
The [Wizard] Draio hunter had sniffed one out, was overcoming the damned Arachnian&#39;s strength, and opened the door to find some human guy pinning some human girl to the bed. &quot;What magic trick is this!?!&quot; the [Wizard] masking his identity asked. Antoine looked down and saw Sparkle looking like a human. He wasn&#39;t touching her, but her face looked flushed and there was a sort of warmth radiating from her, and while he could feel &quot;lust mana&quot; coming from her the overwhelming pure mana she normally emitted Antoine couldn&#39;t sense. <br />
Antoine felt a bit snappy and said &quot;I guess this magic trick is called KILLING THE MOOD! GET OUT!&quot;<br />
<br />
Moments later the [Wizard] was &quot;escorted&quot; out by Jozvm, and Antoine was cooling down with Sparkle. Thankfully [The Beauty of the Beholder] bestowed Sparkle some clothes. Underwear apparently along with a simple frilly black dress. It looked good on Sparkle the human who had black hair and red eyes instead of her normal... energy look. The two felt shaken up a bit when after a good half hour of just, enjoying not being in danger T&#39;Kiln knocked on the door and entered. <br />
&quot;Alright, Antoine from what I heard you managed an emergency excellently... but this... it&#39;s a capstone isn&#39;t it?&quot; T&#39;Kiln asked<br />
&quot;You mean a special skill you get after 10 levels or so?&quot; Antoine asked<br />
&quot;Yes, I had confirmed that at the start you had nothing. I pushed you hard last night but not enough to just blitz through the entire first 10 levels...&quot; T&#39;Kiln then put a hand on Sparkle and said &quot;...This ain&#39;t a regular skill though. Not some cheap illusion, she has mass.&quot; Looking at her form Antoine had to agree... he thought her chest was bigger than in her energy form, and maybe some wider hips... were they growing? T&#39;Kiln pulled out a small pouch and tossed it to Antoine &quot;20 silver coins. That&#39;s your starting bonus and your wage is going to be a silver a day. Best I can do for now till your skills start pulling in more business or better clientele... It&#39;s just... expect to level well tonight, you just protected a very important person here from being kidnapped from a very strong person.&quot; and then T&#39;Kiln left the two alone. Antoine was about to leave for his own room, but Sparkle held onto his sleeve.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t go... please stay for the night&quot; Sparkle pleaded, and that night Antoine slept with a girl. Nothing THAT sexual, but there was a connection. <br />
