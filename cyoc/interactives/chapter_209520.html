<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Renata lay relaxing on her bed, she heard a strange tapping on her window. When she peered out, she was surprised to see Ruby Reynard sitting in a tree in her human form! Renata hastily unfastened the window and pulled it open. Ruby gracefully leapt out of the branches, landing on her feet in Renata&#39;s bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are your parents asleep yet?&quot; Ruby whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; Renata answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Ruby smiled mischievously. &quot;Thought I&#39;d surprise you with a little visit. Up for some &#39;playtime,&#39; Rennie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always!&quot; Renata grinned lustfully. &quot;I have to admit, though, you kinda took me by surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the werefox way!&quot; Ruby laughed as she undressed herself. &quot;Romantic moonlight trysts with our enthralled lovers, forbidden lovemaking under forbidding parents&#39; noses, the works! I honestly think I&#39;d die without these kind of adventures to keep my blood pumin&#39;, Rennie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m starting to agree, now that I&#39;m a werevixen,&quot; Renata agreed as she removed her own clothes. &quot;Rebellion and thrill-seeking just make me feel more alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once the two werevixens were fully naked, they let their human bodies begin to shift. Red and white fur sprouted all over their skin, their feet became paws, and bushy tails burst forth from their rounding asses. Each girl approvingly watched her lover change as their breasts swelled and multiplied in number, their muzzles pushed out, and their ears grew pointy.<br />
<br />
Once the changes stopped, Renata ran her clawed fingers down all of Ruby&#39;s breasts, &quot;Babe, you look <i>amazing</i> with more than two tits! I just can&#39;t get over it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re rockin&#39; the look yourself, cutie!&quot; Ruby laughed lewdly as she pushed Renata onto the bed. Ruby then positioned herself so that her mouth was over Renata&#39;s pussy and her pussy was over Renata&#39;s mouth. &quot;So, ready to sixty-nine with me, Rennie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was ready before you got here, Ruby,&quot; Renata smiled before running her vulpine tongue over Ruby&#39;s engorged pussy lips.<br />
<br />
The two werevixen lovers vigorously lashed at each other&#39;s pussies with their tongues, licking, caressing, and nibbling in their quest for pleasure. As they licked, they used their hands to fondle and knead each other&#39;s tits, savoring the luxurious softness of both fat and fur beneath their fingers. As their arousal mounted, the two werefoxes switched from licking pussy lips to clits. Ruby felt a surge of pride and satisfaction as she felt Renata twitch and writhe under her as she licked away at her alpha&#39;s erect clit.<br />
<br />
Soon, Renata&#39;s writhing intensified as her orgasm washed over her like a tidal wave. She yowled and yipped in rapture as her body wildly spasmed under Ruby&#39;s expert touch. Before long, Ruby joined her lover in the throes of bliss. She shuddered violently as a warm, electric thrill radiated from her squirting pussy out to her fingers and her footpaws, her tail going stiff and her ears twitching as she lost control of her body for a moment. All too soon, the height of the ecstasy wore off and Ruby collapsed onto Renata&#39;s spent body to savor the heavenly afterglow.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was... incredible!&quot; Renata said at last. &quot;I&#39;ve slept with a lot of boys and girls, but nobody&#39;s ever given my orgasms quite like you do, Ruby. You&#39;ve got so much more than just a hot body or great moves. Not that you don&#39;t have those, but there&#39;s something else, too. It&#39;s like you... connect with me when we make love. You almost <i>meld</i> with me. I... I love you, Ruby Reynard. I really do want to spend the rest of my life with you, and probably my afterlife, too. I want you to be my mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, too, Rennie,&quot; Ruby smiled as she sat up on the bed. &quot;And, believe me, that&#39;s fucking special. Werefoxes don&#39;t fall in love easily. Oh, we experience tons of passion and sexual desire, but that&#39;s not the same thing as love. Love is <i>selfless</i>. It isn&#39;t so much about making <i>yourself</i> feel good as it is about deciding your beloved&#39;s joy <i>is</i> your joy. Thank you for giving me true love, Rennie. It feels more amazing than all the lust and passion in the world!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad we could share something like that, Ruby,&quot; Renata smiled, squeezing Ruby&#39;s clawed hand.<br />
<br />
Ruby sighed. &quot;Unfortunately, I&#39;m still a werefox. Our feelings are infamously fickle and changeable. Sure, I&#39;m in love with you <i>right now</i>, Rennie, and I&#39;ll probably be in love with you for quite a while, but it won&#39;t last. I was in love once before, with a vampire girl named Valeria von Karnstein. I thought I&#39;d devote the rest of my life to making her happy. Instead, I skipped town and broke up with her over a text message. I just wish there was a way to make our love last, Rennie. I don&#39;t want it to die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d probably last if you took the Werefox Inhibitor Potion,&quot; Renata suggested.<br />
<br />
Ruby stared out the window, brooding. &quot;I don&#39;t like the idea of watering down my free-spirited shameless personality, but I&#39;d do it if it were the only way to stay with you, Rennie, no matter the side effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there any other option?&quot; Renata asked. &quot;I don&#39;t wanna force you into something you aren&#39;t comfortable with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess Morgana might have a love potion that could irrevocably strengthen our love into an unbreakable bond. Mom used to tell me stories about humans who fell in love with their werefox partners and used potions like that on them to keep them from leaving them. I&#39;m pretty sure Mom meant those to be scary stories to warm me to watch out for human tricks and snares, but right now I&#39;d kill for a potion like that, Rennie.&quot; The fire in Ruby&#39;s eyes betrayed that her words were not hyperbole.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Morgana could have a potion like that?&quot; Renata asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Ruby shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m certain she&#39;ll have some love potions, but ones strong enough to forge an unbreakable, everlasting bond are rare and difficult to make. Some witches are also reluctant to sell them due to the trouble they can cause. Look at all the chaos even a <i>weak</i> love potion caused in <i>A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream</i>. Bottom line, there&#39;s a very good chance that Morgana won&#39;t have what we need in stock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else?&quot; asked Renata.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, angels can create everlasting love,&quot; Ruby mused, &quot;and there&#39;s one in a nearby town, Byron Heights. Her name&#39;s Yomiel, and she lives with a human girl called Mandy. Of course, dealing with an angel is fucking dangerous for Children of Night like us. The less tolerant angels would gladly smite us for sullying their presence, and the <i>really</i> powerful ones radiate an aura that burns us. Now, Yomiel&#39;s supposed to be pretty nice, but I also hear that Tori Vordenburg uses her as a contact. Huge security risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please tell me there&#39;s a fourth option,&quot; Renata begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is...&quot; Ruby paused nervously. &quot;But it involves letting a vampire patriarch or matriarch brainwash us into adoring each other forever... and then having sex with her to seal the geis. I hear that staring into the mesmerizing eyes of Carmilla von Karnstein or Lord Ruthven isn&#39;t for the faint of heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Ruthven?&quot; asked Renata.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Lord George Gordon Ruthven,&quot; said Ruby. &quot;He&#39;s the patriarch of Clan Ruthven, the vampire clan that lives in Byron Heights. Stokerville isn&#39;t the only town with a magical community, after all. Between him and Carmilla von Karnstein, I&#39;d go to Carmilla to seal our love. Lord Ruthven&#39;d do it, but he&#39;d ask for a favor in return. Clan Ruthven isn&#39;t as bad as Clan Báthory, Clan de Rais, or Clan Tepes, but their patriarch&#39;s a pretty mercenary guy. All he really cares about in any situation is if his clan benefits, and I hate being in ANY creature&#39;s debt, a vampire patriarch most of all. Carmilla&#39;s really nice, though, She&#39;d do it just to help out. On the other hand, walking into her nest&#39;ll be an awkward experience. Like most non-werefoxes, her clan&#39;s learned to mistrust werefoxes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s the good option?&quot; asked Renata.<br />
<br />
Ruby just laughed. &quot;There <i>isn&#39;t</i> one, Rennie!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; said Renata. &quot;What&#39;s the <i>least bad</i> option? Personally, I&#39;m favoring asking Morgana if she&#39;s got a powerful enough love potion in stock tomorrow. Can&#39;t hurt to ask, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ruby thought about it. After weighing all of her options, she decided that she was most comfortable with...</p>
