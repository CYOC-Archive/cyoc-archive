<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...an invisible stroll down the street.  <br />
<br />
This would be too good, I thought.  Wish myself invisible, walk around and try to catch people saying or doing things I could use against them.  Underhanded?  Of course.  I might as well use this ring for something devious.<br />
<br />
I stepped outside my front door and quickly looked around.  I did not see anyone around.  I wished that I was invisible.  It worked.  I coudl not see myself.  However, I could see my clothes and shoes.  Uh-oh, I thought.  That would be a problem.  I wished that my clothes and shoes were invisible too.  They disappeared from my sight.  Time for a walk through town.<br />
<br />
I had walked for about half an hour and hadn't seen or heard anything of much interest.  Finally I made my way to the Roxbridge Mall.  This is one place where I might actually see someone I knew.  <br />
<br />
I walked to the entrance and realized that I had two problems now.  I quickly stepped off the pathway where nobody was walking.  I had not come into contact with anyone as of yet.  But what if I were to bump into somebody?  Surely they would feel me somehow, and that could lead to some complications.  Another problem is that if I opened a door or something, that would be seen, too.  How could I eliminate this problem?<br />
<br />
I found the answer in a minute.  First of all, I wished that I could walk through walls and doors.  That would take care of that little complication.  Now the tricky part.  How to prevent people from knocking into me?  I had only one solution, and I prayed it would work.  I wished that I could walk through people and animals.  To be honest, it was more that they could walk through me without feeling me.  This way I wouldn't have to dodge people every which way.  I just hoped I wouldn't have a &quot;Ghost&quot;-like experience and see a person's insides.  Better yet, I wished that wouldn't happen.<br />
<br />
I walked right through the mall's outside doors.  Didn't feel a thing.  I have to admit that was pretty cool.  I quickly scanned the area is was standing in and intentionally walked right in the path of a person heading for the doors.  I walked straight at an older man, and as he came closer to me, I braced myself for what was going to happen.  I passed right through the man's body.  Again, I didn't feel anything, and I didn't see any internal organs.  I turned around and looked at the man, who just kept walking on his way.<br />
<br />
OK, time to cruise the mall, I thought.  Hmm, what would be a good place to start?  Let's try The Gap.<br />
<br />
That was a good choice.  Walking out of the store just as I walked up were Lindsey Houseman and Trisha Crewson.  They were two of the hotter girls in the school.  And, as usually goes with that territory, two of the bigger bitches you'd ever meet.  I decided to follow them to see what they'd do.<br />
<br />
I followed them towards the food court.  They were just talking about normal, mindless stuff.  Nothing that peaked my interest whatsoever.  They went into the food court and bought some frozen yogurt, then found a table.  They sat down at a table with 4 chairs.  Luckily, one of the chairs was pulled out enough so I could sit down, too.  After all I had not said &quot;pass through tables and chairs,&quot; just &quot;walls and doors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm so excited about tonight,&quot; Lindsey said in between spoonfuls of fat-free strawberry yogurt.  Lindsey was a big-breasted, blonde bimbo.  Again, is there any other kind?  She wasn't really mean-spirited, just rude and never wished to be bothered by those who weren't her friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, it's going to be so much fun,&quot; Trisha agreed.  &quot;What time are we supposed to go to Erika's house?&quot;  Trisha, a pretty brunette with breasts as large as Lindsey's, was referring to Erika Stevens.  Erika's family was very well to do, to say the least.  The house in which they lived was practically a mansion.  Needless to say, Erika was a true snob.  She also thought she was into every trend there was, and set the trends in our school.  The &quot;k&quot; in her name was the best example of that. <br />
<br />
&quot;About 8:30,&quot; Lindsey said.  &quot;Erika invited us, Claire, Mia, and Katie.&quot;  Ooh, I thought.  Claire Peterson, Mia Gregorio, and Katie Broussard were three more of the hottest girls in the school.  They were decent one on one, but group mentality often took over when they were together.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love slumber parties,&quot; Trisha said.  &quot;No matter how old I am, I never get tired of them.  Is there going to be anything naughty like last time?&quot;  That really grabbed my attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Lindsey said, &quot;Erika wouldn't say but she said it should be better than last time.&quot;<br />
<br />
They got up from the table and I was careful to stay seated.  They threw away their trash and began walking away.  I got up without moving the chair and snuck after them.  I picked them up as Lindsey said, &quot;...such a pain.  It's impossible to find a decent guy here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what college is for,&quot; Trisha said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, for you, maybe,&quot; Lindsey complained.  &quot;I'll end up stuck here for school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trisha consoled her.  &quot;Only for two years.  Then you'll transfer somewhere and find someone right for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
They talked about more mindless stuff, never mentioning the slumber party again.  They exited the mall and drove off together.  I stopped following them as they went to Lindsey's car, and instead began walking home.  I was going to have some fun tonight.</p>
