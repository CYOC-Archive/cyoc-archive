<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a few minutes of staring at the screen for a few minutes Rick noticed the text beside the <br />
horrific image.It was a typical teen girls post<br />
<br />
&quot; DO YOU THINK HAVING BIG FANGS AND BLOODY CLAWS IS COOL.DO YOU WANT TO <br />
LEARN THE SECRETS OF BECOMING A BEAST OF THE DARKNESS.tHEN JOIN OUR GROUP<br />
<br />
                                                                                         MISSIPISHUGURL AND FRIENDS &quot;<br />
<br />
Rick looked down at the latest stream of messages that kept scrolling up his screen.Most of them were<br />
idle chatter.He posted under Sadie_sicklove,asking the kids if maybe the image on the homepage was a <br />
little too real for their tastes.The idle posts continued,as if they did not care or could not see Sadies <br />
post.<br />
<br />
              A idea struck Rick.Maybe there were two levels of viewers on this group.The real McCoy's<br />
and mere mortal kids who wanted to have fun.So he typed in a typical teen post about Sadies mate<br />
from a past life and how their relationship was breaking up.Immediately he typed in another post <br />
about how the white ribs showing on the victim of the home pages image looked liked they'd been <br />
chewed by a mountain lion.<br />
<br />
            Both posts popped up but the other members only responded to the first,innocent teen post.<br />
The other one was ignored,as if it never existed,as if it was only viewable by members for whom the<br />
act of ripping open a humans ribcage was no long theory.<br />
<br />
             Rick clicked on his membership profile.It was all there.Sadies species a &quot; feathered bitch of the<br />
night&quot;,more commonly known as a female thunderbird wolf.It listed his parents address,Sadies past <br />
existence as Rick and a record of performance.She was listed as a &quot; inactive supernatural.&quot;<br />
<br />
             His eyes rested on the date of her first kill.In two months time Sadie would become active.<br />
<br />
He'd seen enough and rushed from the computer.Ignoring the rattling and howls,he crept under<br />
his blankets.After an hour or so he finally fell asleep and dreamed.<br />
<br />
           Rickietta found herself standing out on a road.For a minute she was disorientted,but then she saw<br />
the mall she used to hang out as a teenager earlier.Earlier?She tried to remember when she,d been a <br />
teenager.How could it be decades earlier when she'd just turned fourteen three months earlier.She could<br />
sense that this was a dream,and decided to go with it.She felt uncomfortable in this oversized mans <br />
clothing,and in the back of her dream state she felt her male body tossing and turning as forces within<br />
it awakened.She could feel the pressure on its spine,the aching hip bones,the itching of the scalp,the<br />
tens of thousands of pins and needles pricking at and under the skin.<br />
<br />
            She ignored the sensations of her slowly altering physical body and got back to the dream.She<br />
drifted towards the police station,where she saw her parents car parked in the lot.It was one oclock in<br />
the morning and she walked in,unseen by both the cop on duty and her parents.Her mother was <br />
frantically telling the sergeant that her daughter Rickietta was missing.She's awakened at midnight with<br />
a feeling of dread and rushed to her teen daughters bedroom,only to find the bed hadn't been slept in<br />
and her daughter was missing.<br />
<br />
            Rickietta stared in wonder as her parents described her to a tee.When the cop asked if there <br />
any relatives she might contact,her parents mentioned her sister and brother,but neglected to mention <br />
Rick their son.<br />
<br />
             It was as if Rick no longer existed.....<br />
<br />
Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br />
<br />
Rick fumbled for the alarm,and slowly the dream faded away.He knew it had been important <br />
but he couldn't recall it.No matter,he felt strong,invigorated,better then he'd ever felt before.<br />
<br />
                   He switched off the computer and after chores put on some light work clothes .He took<br />
the train to work and rushed early to his cubicle at the trading firm.It was just another Monday morning.<br />
It was around noon when he suddenly felt the wave of heat flow up between his legs just as he was<br />
talking to a client on the phone.The line started crackling and then went dead.<br />
<br />
              Rick immediately called up the automated switchboard to reconnect but the stupid machine<br />
wouldn't recognize his voice commands.He waited a few minutes then decided to go to the mens <br />
washroom to freshen up.<br />
<br />
          He had only just began washing when the column of heat rushing up and down his spine<br />
suddenly exploded into a fireball and he pitched forward over the basin.It was as if worms were <br />
crawling and moving about inside of his belly.he groaned in pain and felt his whole body shift.<br />
<br />
             Then it was done and he slowly straightened his slightly baggy clothing.He felt himself,<br />
and everything appeared to be all right.No emerging fangs,no pointy ears,no blackened claws at<br />
the end of his fingertips.Then he looked into the mirror and said a bad word very loudly.<br />
<br />
              She was a full foot shorter than him.Her raven black hair swept over her bosom and her back <br />
down to her knees.Her eyes were a glittering brown and her small blossoming breasts were barely <br />
hidden by the breastpiece woven of bird skulls and long wickedly sharp black and grey claws.<br />
<br />
Her waist was pinched in,unike his flabby pouch,and he could see her skirt of talons and skulls <br />
barely hid her feminine figure or the little tuft of crotch hair that poked up invitingly.She was fourteen<br />
and she was him.<br />
<br />
          Rick was stunned at the altered appearance of his reflection,and decided finishing work early<br />
would be a good idea.As soon as he walked out the mens washroom door the loud murmer in the <br />
room and the turned heads of disapproval and lust confirmed his worst fears.He saw himself,others<br />
saw a teen girl strutting her stuff.<br />
<br />
          When his supervisor rushed up and helpfully offered to lead &quot;her&quot; to the ladies washroom,Rick <br />
meekly followed.Once in the ladies washroom he sat on the toilet and thought.It was obvious that to <br />
everyone else Rick the employee no longer existed.She was sadie_sicklove or Rickietta,daughter of one <br />
firms employees.<br />
<br />
               So he went up to the mirror and took a closer look at the creature he was turning into.He<br />
pulled off his shirt and watched his mirror image do likewise.He felt at his chest with his hands and <br />
watched in sick fascination as the girl in the mirror smirked at him .She didn't match him exactly,and<br />
gave off a dark aura of erotic menace.As he just touched his nipples she rubbed them virgorously and<br />
twisted them so that he could gaze upon them as her breasts bounced up and down.<br />
<br />
           She was amplifying his movements,transforming them,reinterpreting them.Where he lifted his<br />
shirt <br />
half an inch,his mirror self raised her grisly adornment<br />
 an inch,just enough to expose the curves of a hidden breast<br />
or a nipple.When he pulled down his shorts two inches,she pulled hers down two and a half.And with a<br />
evil inviting smile just let him peek at the private parts he knew soon would be his.When he tosses his <br />
head,she tossed hers even more vigorously and seemed to pant as her chest heaved up and down as<br />
her midnight black hair flew about.<br />
<br />
             He left the ladies washroom after half an hour and tried to be as modest as possible as he <br />
realized anything he could do,she could do better.His supervisor was eager to lead the young lady to her <br />
dads workstation.Rick was a little startled when the supervisor reached out a hand and it came to rest<br />
somewhere in his neck.That would be about where the helpful mans hand would rest on the head of a <br />
shorter fourteen year old girl.Ignoring the uncomfortable feeling of a ghost hand in his neck,Rick tried<br />
to modestly reply to the mans questions.<br />
<br />
             Once he'd left Rick left several messageson his own voice mail.When he played them back it<br />
was the feminine voice of a evil young seductress that he heard.After that,the discovery that the shadow<br />
he cast against the adjacent wall had long swishing hair,feminine fingernails and figure came as no <br />
surprise.<br />
<br />
              Finally the end of the day came and he was eager to return home.He ignored the wolf whistles<br />
and stares,and locked the door behind him.</p>
