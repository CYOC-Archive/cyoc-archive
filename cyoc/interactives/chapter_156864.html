<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roger woke slowly the next morning. He had slept fitfully with a mix of good dreams about Tony and and bad dreams about Adam. He grogily took care of business in the bathroom before getting some more clothes on and heading downstairs for breakfast. He was just sitting down to a bowl of cereal when his mom came in from the living room and smiled at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good you&#39;re finally up.&#39;&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Hey Ma, you mind if I go over to Max&#39;s place today and hang out with him and Tony.&quot; Roger asked wanting to get out of the house as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure sweetie, in fact when you finish with Adam maybe you can take him along.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger almost spit out his mouthful of cereal, &quot;You got to be kidding!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Roger you know you&#39;re going to have to keep a close eye on Adam if this is going to work. His box arrived yesterday while you were out, its in the living room waiting for you,&quot; she said without skipping a beat. <br />
<br />
Roger practically knocked over his chair as he bolted out of the room. Sure enough a large plain brown box was sitting near the front door. The return address indicated it was from the Pony Barn care of the PRLB and Roger&#39;s pulse quickened. He grabbed the large box and took it up to his room where he opened it as quickly as he could. <br />
<br />
Inside was a booklet of regulations and instructions from the PRLB on owning a pony boy as well as s sheaf of paper detailing the license permitted to one Adam Nelson. Roger barely paid any attention to these as his focus was immediately drawn to the other items in the box. First he pulled out a thick set of straps and leather harnesses. Roger wasn&#39;t sure but he thought they looked thicker than the ones they had used to hitch Tony up to his sulkie. Next there was a pair of special designed shoes to help the wearer get used to hooves. There wear also several boxes of nutritional supplements and some drink pouches that were labeled Tranquil Stud.  <br />
<br />
He was just about through all the contents of the box when a knock at his bedroom door caused him to startle and he litteraly fell over when his brother Adam walked in completely nude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey little bro, I was just down at breakfast and mom said she gave you my box,&quot; He said with a grin. <br />
<br />
Roger stared up at him and took in the changes to his appearance. He had shaved the sides of his head leaving a distinct strip of brown hair from his forehead back to his neck like a mowhak. Aside from that hair the rest of his body had none. He had apparently shaved off all of his body hair below the neck, from his arms and chest right down to his now hairless crotch and balls. Roger wasn&#39;t sure if it was just that lack of hair on his body or if he had actually become more ripped than he was the day before with every muscle standing out in perfect definition. <br />
<br />
&quot;Adam? What the hell is going on?&quot; Roger stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whadda ya mean?&quot; Adam asked, idly grabbing his cock and stroking it a little. &quot;We&#39;ve been waiting for that box ever since I volunteered last week. It&#39;s about time too, since my first appointment at the clinic is tomorrow.&quot; <br />
<br />
Roger shook his head, &quot;You volunteered? For this?&quot; he indicated the box of equine supplies. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. You know. College wasn&#39;t working out the way I wanted so I decided this was the next best option. Mom and dad were ok with it since you agreed to be my owner and you&#39;re friend Max had such big plans for his bro Tony they thought you could make use of the connections he had with the PRLB. Good thing too since you asked them for some special treatment for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing up and dusting himself off, Roger couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing. His stupid ponyphobic bully of a brother had actually volunteered to undergo the treatment. &quot;Are you sure about this?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on bro, would you stop with all the questions. We&#39;ve been over this and I want to get started!&quot; Adam all but begged. <br />
<br />
Roger wasn&#39;t sure if he was still dreaming or not but he didn&#39;t want to waste it if he was. &quot;Ok, get over here then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Adam fist pumped. <br />
<br />
First Roger pulled out some of the leather straps and the harness. He tightly secured Adam&#39;s arms to his sides. If the was some kind of joke at least he won&#39;t be able to pound me, Roger thought. There was also a modified bridle the fit around his neck like a collar and there was an attachment point for a bit, though he opted to leave that out for the time being. Next he had Adam step in to the shoes. This put him on his toes and kept him from settling back on his heels. The effect was to give him a couple more inches of height and really made his muscular calves bulge. <br />
<br />
With a deep breath Roger grabbed the next item from the box. The ball weights. He hefted them in his hands ans swore it felt heavier than the one Tony had on. He hesitated for a moment as he looked as his bother in his straps and he stared back expectantly. His thick cock rigid as a flag pole and bobbing in time with his heartbeat, a small clear glob of pre forming as the tip. Joke or not, there was no way he could fake that. <br />
<br />
Roger reached out with trembling hands and took his older brother&#39;s shaft in his grasp. He pulled on his balls with his free and and tugged them out from his body before snapping the heavy weights in place. In a moment of malicious revenge, he let them fall from his grasp and Adam yelped as the weight dropped and pulled on his sack, though even this only seemed to excite him further and a small gush of pre streamed from his cock head. <br />
<br />
&quot;There you go, all set Adam.&quot; Roger said standing up and looking over his older brother now strapped and weighted like a proper pony. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite, Rog. You almost forgot the tail.&quot; Adam giggled as he turned and waggeled the big round globes of his ass at Roger. <br />
<br />
&quot;You got a pony tail sent, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, no way I would go for just any run of the mill pony.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curious, Roger dug back in the box and pulled aside a sheet of packing material to reveal what he was looking for. It was a tail alright, sprouting from the end of a thick rubber butt plug. But it wan&#39;t the long glossy hair of a pony that Roger pulled out of the box, it was a thick ropy brown tail with a black tassel of fur at the tip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this a...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Donkey tail. I&#39;m gonna be your big strong jack ass, bro&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger grinned as he reached around Adam&#39;s waist and pulled on his cock several times, collecting several large dollops of the pre he was producing. He lubed up the bulb of the tail plug and placed it against Adam&#39;s taint. He gently started pushing it in and Adam moaned in delight. Roger pulled it back a little before pushing it in a little further. He did the several more times, practically fucking his jock brother&#39;s ass with the tail plug before if popped into place and seated itself firmly in his hole. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hawww yeah,&quot; Adam yelled as the tail went into place and his cock spasmed sending several thick shots a fresh spunk shooting across the room.</p>
