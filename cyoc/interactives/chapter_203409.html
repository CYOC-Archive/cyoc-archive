<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken hung trussed up while eyeing his skin a blackened animal hide and it getting tougher as did the body hair grew, flourishing to form a pelt. <br />
<br />
He had need to cock his head for a view of those growing Mule size balls. Ken wondered if at some future date that a Veterinarian might suggest to cut away his lovely, big, male jewels; leaving him still horny but castrated. Ken felt the many agonies that came from a body transforming; as did he jump and wriggle, feeling the waves of pain. His knew that his ears and face were changing making vision as strange, both the lacking a full ranges of color, and how he needed to contort his head for better views of how he was changing species. <br />
<br />
When Ken first felt his lips thickening, the upper lip merging with the brunt face of his expanding nostrils, both nose and mouth grew to form the beginnings of a mealy, whiskered, Mule muzzle. As had the mouth expanded and his tongue broader, more muscular, he felt his human teeth being pushed out from beneath as were equine teeth sprouting, growing, becoming a part of his newer self. <br />
<br />
Ken began to flicking of his growing tail; this was with anxious feelings of want for the finality of when his body were all an equine male animal. As well he watched his thighs to broaden, and human buttocks grow stout, there came muscular cramps, as horrid discomfort, but was easy to understand why it all hurt. <br />
<br />
The scientist there and watching, acted as if displeased, was unhappy about something Ken did not do, as he never begged or pleaded about the loss of his being human. The common actions of mostly all who were subjected with the use of Reformation Serum, screamed for mercy. Ken reacted differently, as much owning a deep seated,  personal desire about his self and future; was faithfully accepting easily his transformation to becoming an animal and a male Mule.<br />
<br />
The wondering scientist walked up close to Ken. The small man of about 5&#39;2&quot; stood gawking up at Ken; he being 6&#39;7&quot; tall a man, would gain spinal growth during the changing process. Ken did not grimace his mouth from what he felt, or might expect to know of hurt. At last his questioning mind needed some answers, so the scientist asked of Ken a few questions before his mouth and lips became total equine of form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young sir, I note that unlike so many others you seem to be accepting this situation with some strange sort of willingness, which naturally I consider as not the normal, why,&quot; asked the Scientist?<br />
<br />
Ken thought for a minute before wishing to offer his truthful reply. Down deep inside his brain, it felt a changing occurring, something physical, due to transitioning chemicals. Ken found his five senses as far more alert due to how he was evolving. It took a fair bit of mental and oral, lip contortions to offer a response, as a Mule-human replied, &quot;Aye ahh, ah...ike ati !&quot; (I ah, ah like it!)<br />
The essence of what Ken implied as said through the use of equine, Mule lips, did not offer an easy pronunciation. As using larynx, tongue, and some lip movements, what Ken needed to speak his thought was a losing annunciating ability due to radical chemicals that were degrading learned human patterns of thought. Ken wanted and was fervently looking forward to when he became physically an animal, he a Mule; the ultimate impossibility!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as that is the whole crux,&quot; so exclaimed the Scientist his hands on hips and some level of disgust showing.<br />
<br />
Ken inhaled a deep breath, and his whole form shuddered as he then strained to speak a further thought, &quot;Aye kame hoo hirra hoo hee!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Scientist rattle Ken&#39;s muddled words over in his thoughts, he having heard of such said and garbled many, many times before. Then they struck home and he repeated them as Ken agreed to the meaning, &quot;Aye, or I kame, came hoo, I came to hirra hoo hee, I came to here to see; as you came to Pleasure Island just to see the animals! <br />
<br />
Oh of course you are a beast lover, and the possibility of becoming as well an animal was forthright in your desires, correct,&quot; so asked the questioning man?<br />
<br />
The Scientist was right on, as Ken nodded his near equine size head, agreeing with the man&#39;s statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;That tells me a lot about why you are not then acting as have so many others. They unlike you found becoming as an animal to be horrid and terrible; as I might suspect any sane person would. Yet you having come here with the fond hope of seeing a transformation, and becoming part in part as one of our many Reformation subjects, makes me feel gratitude. <br />
<br />
Yes sir, I feel our work here not only makes extreme profits, but for some, we serve a rare few their ultimate delight. As you are enjoying the transition and look forward to a new lifestyle as animal and Mule, I feel your gratitude to guide you along your pathway,&quot; said the Scientist to Ken.<br />
<br />
A vigorous head nodding, as Ken agrees with the man, feeling as he has nothing to lose and maybe by being agreeable had something to win. The Scientist man walks to the Technician manager and has a brief talk. They argue and then the manager walks out the room in a huff. The Scientist takes the subject chart and paging through it he then returns to the Tech manager&#39;s desk and makes a phone call.<br />
<br />
His call was short and hung it up, he walked closer to where Ken still is trussed up off the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, I&#39;m not an evil and unfeeling man, and thus due to the gratitude shown by you for accepting your situation, I have an offer. As planned, you were to grow larger, and become a fourteen hands high at the withers, then a fully male Mule. Since you are willing to become an animal for us here, I will offer you a betterment to your new form than of being a common Mule. <br />
<br />
As offered, I am changing your assigned lifestyle, the new you then preferred being a ridden Mule used here in the park by our security personnel,&quot; the man did ask of Ken.<br />
<br />
Equine attitudes were fast overtaking human expression as Ken feeling some added delight, he got painfully erect, sporting a fully flared equine length cock. Seeing the black penis fall and stiffen as the common manner of equine style masturbation, the Scientist man smiles knowing his offer was accepted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here now, lower him down and move the subject to operating room five, do it NOW,&quot; ordered the Scientist.</p>
