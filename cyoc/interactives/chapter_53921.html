<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike the Pizza Guy rang the door-bell with all the confidence of a man who had been doing it for years.  He had been, but that was only because he needed money for his art career.  At least that is what he told himself.  For the most part, his 'art' consisted of him drawing slutty manga characters for people on-line.  Mike loved anime and manga and always dreamed of being called over to Japan and living the life of a celebrity animator.  He would get a hot Japanese wife and get her to dress up in flowing robes and dye her hair pink or blue or pale purple.  But it was an idle fantasy, he knew, he was not likely to go anywhere but back and forth in this town delivering pies for people.<br />
<br />
Mike set the pizza case down on the small bench that adorned the porch of the large house.  He thought about ringing again but did not want to irritate the customers.  A big house like this required a few minutes to get to the door and an angry customer tipped poorly.  While he waited Mike looked down the driveway.  Three cars filled the lot and Mike had to park on the street.  His ugly, rusting hatch-back idled noisily.  He had a few more deliveries to do then he was done for the night.  Mike wanted to go home and watch the new DVD set he had got in the mail today.  All that stood in the way was a slow customer.<br />
<br />
Mike's finger was inches from the buzzer when he heard the locks being worked.  The door pulled open a little and a pleasant smiling face met his.  &quot;Dominic's Delivery?&quot; he said cheerily.  This girl must be in her last year of high-school Mike thought.  Harmless flirting was a good way to get tips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, awesome!&quot; yelled the girl pulling open the door.  In the bright lights of the porch she stood tall and lean.  She had long blond hair and large breasts that left the house before the rest of her body.  &quot;We've been waiting for so long ...&quot; she trailed off seeing how Mike stared a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, sorry.  Fridays are always busy for us,&quot; he recovered.  The girl was like a living Barbie doll, Mike thought.  Not really what he wanted but certainly one of the hottest girls he had ever seen.  He wished he could take a photo with his cell-phone for later reference.  She would make a great model for an anime character.  &quot;I've got a large Italian-sausage and a large pepperoni and cheese.  That will be, ahh, thirty-six dollars and change,&quot; Mike said finally.<br />
<br />
The beauty nodded a moment seemingly unsure of her-self and then slapped her head with a cute little hand.  &quot;Oh, I left the money in the house, I will be right back.&quot;  She left the door ajar as she hustled to step over a mess of bags strewn on the floor.  She motioned for Mike to step inside as she left the hall.<br />
<br />
Mike cautiously stepped in.  It was the rule to never go in the house but something about the girl called to him.  Make took the boxes out of the warmer and held them up.  The girl was in his mind and he started to play with her image; designing the character as he idly waited.<br />
<br />
She was too tall, he thought.  She needed to be short like four feet but keep the super long-leg look.  He wanted to put her in stockings; white, lacy and right up to the top of her thighs.  She would be permanently clad in stockings never taking them off.  Maybe they were magical or something, like the rest of her outfit.  Her breasts would have to be huge too.  Like two giant pillows sitting on her tiny frame and they would bounce and jiggle with every movement.  It was cliched but Mike was on a role.  He imagined her to be cursed or something to be a walking, flirty wet-dream girl.  How tragic.<br />
<br />
The girl came back holding money.  Mike shook his head.  She seemed shorter now.  It must have been the step up to the house that made her seem so tall.  The long legs that she sported did not help, they seemed to make her body look tiny walking on such stilts.  It was no wonder Mike had thought she was so tall.  They were striking legs and clad in tight white stockings.  The girl giggled, looking up at Mike, she held out the money, shyly trying to hide her enormous breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go, uh, what's your name?&quot; she said in a tiny voice that seemed to match the voice in Mike's imagination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike,&quot; he said taking the money between two fingers.  He started to wonder about his fist impression.  This girl still seemed to have the air of a Barbie doll but for some reason she had Japanese features too.  Her eyes were huge and watery and bright blue her nose seemed to shrink as he watched.  Her lips which had been full before seemed to be growing as if her mouth was shrinking; becoming more pursed and pillowy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm, Jen,&quot; she said and her shy voice slide passed her huge lips in a way that mad Mike hard.  Jen took the boxes from Mike and turned slowly to make sure that he was watching her as she stepped carefully back toward the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Mike shivered.  This Jen was everything he ever wanted to have in a girl.  If only she had curly blue locks that fell about her face and down her back.  If only she wore a smoldering maid's dress.  It would be ruffled on the shoulders and tight about her bodice.  It would be dark-blue and shiny as if it was made from plastic.  Her lacy petty coats would hold up the short, frilled skirt almost horizontal but under all that fluffy fabric she would always be nude.  Clean shaven even.  Her hands should also be covered in flawless, white satin gloves that she could never take off.  The cursed clothing would force her to obey commands.  She would do anything to have sex but would be unable to sleep with any but the right man, the one that gave her the cursed clothing.<br />
<br />
Mike's daydream was once again broken when Jen returned from the kitchen.  He did not know how she did it, but her hair was now blue.  As he watched it seemed to curl on its own and slowly fell about her face and down her back.<br />
<br />
She leaned in close to Mike and he could smell the fruity scent of her shampoo.  &quot;Thank-you for dinner, Mike.  I hope you don't have to work too late,&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I have a delivery or two left and then home,&quot; Mike's mouth watered as her clothing darkened, becoming bluer as he watched.  She did not seem to notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what?  You'll be with a girl-friend?&quot; Jen asked quietly the possible answer seemed to hurt her but she waited eagerly in anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no girl-friend,&quot; Mike stammered.  He forgot why he had come.  He forgot what he was doing.  All he wanted was to leave but he needed to stay.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you're done you should come back here and play with us.&quot; Jen smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Us?&quot;  Mike watched as her shirt wrapped tight around her bulging breasts making them look huge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just some friends.  We are having a good time playing with magic.&quot;  Jen shrugged her shoulders and her larger breasts bounced like two balloons under her top.  The sleeves became lacy and poofy.  &quot;Do you want to know how to play?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike made a noise.  It might have been yes or no or something very different his brain was not working.  He was watching this girls shorts sprout a frilly petty coat and push the fabric out to almost horizontal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, I ask you: Mike, Transform or Dare?  Then you pick one,&quot; Jen said.  She leaned forward and looked up at the vapor-locked boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare?&quot; Mike repeated not really listening or thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!  Then I dare you to um ... let's say that you should stay rock hard for me until we meet again.  You go finish your work and then we can play again when we meet up right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Mike said.  Something in his pants seemed to lock in place.  He was sure that there was no turning back again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, you better go now,&quot; Jen said with her tiny pouty mouth.<br />
<br />
Mike turned and walked out the door.  In a daze his feet carried him to his car and drove off.  As his mind started to clear he almost convinced himself that it had all been a bout of sever daydream.  There was no way a hot girl like Jen could have transformed into a manga fantasy like that.  He was so freaked out that it was nearly twenty minutes before he even thought to think about where he was driving.  That was when he noticed his super-hard cock.<br />
<br />
Back on the porch at Naomi's house.  Jen seemed to come out of a daze as Mike drove off.  She remembered giving money for pizza and the smell seemed to trigger a memory.  A memory of Naomi giving her a curse, &quot;'You will become the most powerful sexual fantasy of the person who delivers the pizza and you will keep them around while you transform in front of them.'&quot;<br />
<br />
Looked at her hands and found tight, satin gloves that ran up to her elbows.  The pizza guy had wanted something, Jen thought as she walked back into the house closing and locking the door behind her.<br />
<br />
A wisp of blue hair fell over her eyes and she brushed it out of the way.  Tossing her hair she caught her reflection in the hall mirror.  Her big cartoony eyes grew wide as her breasts bounced and jiggled from the motion.<br />
<br />
Jen screamed.</p>
