<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hey...Mary.”<br />
<br />
Pete spoke, feeling the diamond ring in his “Wife’s finger”, solemnly wishing Eric would have done the same to him instead of a stranger who is destined to be his wife either way. <br />
<br />
Pete restrained from thinking about his ex -trying not to escalate the heartbreak or get aroused as he briefly noted that lantern jaw with stubbled his ex spotted.<br />
<br />
“Yes...Peter?” <br />
<br />
Marilyn herself tried not to think about Sharon, or the woman her ex girlfriend became. With the diamond ring in her finger, she wished she could have presented one to her dear Sharon.<br />
<br />
She did not want to abort the baby, but she did not want to abandon Sharon either...or her husband to be. The diamond ring shone, it helped that they had sexual intercourse earlier-even in their heterosexual forms. <br />
<br />
It made it easier for the curse-or the blessing as Christian memorabilia started to surround their already-golden rich room, similar the jewish and christians who had prosperity in everything-including wealth.<br />
<br />
“This is the most hopeful ending you can think of-plus you do love each other deep down you?” The voice spoke.<br />
<br />
Their alter egos, Mary and Peter, deep down were crying out for redemption-to resurface and live their lives as their respective roles, husband and wife...at least until the wedding coming soon.<br />
<br />
“Yes...”Pete spoke.<br />
“Yes...”Mary spoke.<br />
<br />
With the mutual approval, the voice started their transformation once again, as it flashed images of their respective het christian selves straight into their minds-accentuating each detail of their mannerisms and bodies, especially the part where they had sex.<br />
<br />
Pete could only lust over his own transformation as he focused on the rippling muscles of Peter, the rock-rock solid abs and bulging muscles kept strong whilst being a well known investor and businessman-boss and in charge of well known Jewelry stores in US and in overseas and a huge investor in any company that commits to his christian beliefs-or at least those that hates fags.<br />
<br />
Marilyn met the same fate as well, as she blushed at the cutie-despite homophobic, woman she became. Those gorgeous long curls, <br />
<br />
With an onslaught of angles of Mary and Peter having pure bliss with one another, they wanted to become one with their homophobe selves, and their homophobe selves are ready to become one with their future spouses.<br />
<br />
The man, THRUSTED dominantly into the woman’s pussy. As she cried out “Ouahhhh!” In a mixture of disgust and bliss. Marilyn tried to imagine that it was a lady, Mary loved that it was her strong and masculine husband-as her curls resurfaced longer and longer, shoulder length as the blonde faded to brunette.<br />
<br />
“I love you Peter, I hate...homosexuals!” Marilyn forced those words out, not really meaning it but it was enough to seal the deal, as her body slender out even further, she cried out in pain and ecstasy, but as her facial features smoothed out, more petit and less roundness or any fatness, her new, karat diamond earrings shone in delight, <br />
<br />
She licked her lips as she thought about her hunky husband, complimenting her beautiful smile as carefully placed lipstick decorated onto her lips. With that, her eyes shone a gorgeous hazel-as she stared at her soon to be husband. <br />
<br />
“I love you honey bunch~” She said once more, but now really meaning it as Mary. “Gosh Homosexuals really make me mad, I’m so frustrated hun~.”<br />
<br />
Pete, appalled by the words coming out of his wife to be. Peter smirked at the proudness of his gorgeous wife. As Pete forced his very own words out-as he forcibly thrusted deeper into his wife-attempting to visualize it being a tight men’s ass before Peter scoffing at disgust.<br />
<br />
“Same there Sweet pea! I...hate fags and dykes! YUCK!” Pete snapped as he said YUCK, as his gay mind shattered, alongside any thoughts of ass in his mind-especially not the celebrity chef’s ass, he was his business partner for God’s sake-and for God’s sake-<br />
<br />
His hair exploded back to a slick back do, with a match brunette to his wife. His jaw accentuated and became squared, as stubble decorated above and under his lips. He smiled his signature-deal making-dazzling smile, as his teeth shone in bright pearly whites.<br />
<br />
His old self winced, as he could not contain the masculinity as his mouth licked his lips, feeling the sexy stubble as it complimented his rougher appearance. The old Pete would be a bottom most of the time, but a man always tops his wife. He opened his eyes, revealing the green overtaking the brown, which is what Pete is doing now-as his cock throbbed several inches larger and thicker, longing for this moment as though he had abstained for over a century.<br />
<br />
“Damn Wifey!” Peter cockily spoke, as he thrusted back in forth with aggression and bliss. His muscles getting stronger as he could visualize a six pack forming onto his core now. “That fag made me so mad! Over what he did to both of us!”<br />
<br />
“I know right honey bunch oaaahhhhh~” Mary moaned, enjoying this moment over more than the last as though she was a more sensitive woman than before. “Glad to have a big strong, hunky man like you to help me. Not to mention, charming, intelligent, and sexy~”<br />
<br />
Her breasts perked up, as her fiancé groped them without mercy. Moaning louder and louder like a virgin, touched for the very first time. As her back softened and as her core shifted to an hourglass shape-she became the perfect figure for a model-especially for her husband to be’s company ads.<br />
<br />
Her butt smoothed out, as her legs became long and slender-alongside her feet. As her wardrobe expanded inside Peter’s bedroom-him already prepared for his wifey to move in with him for good and for eternity, even in the heavens above. She loved his suites in many locations across the globe, as well as their mansion in LA, traveling with him as his business partner and fiancé was more than a dream for the born-again Mary.<br />
<br />
Peter watched his wife’s complete transformation, his male hormones and testosterone raging in his newfound sexuality, he flexed his biceps as they took on a healthy tan-though not as extreme as that jogger and his girlfriend that he saw earlier this afternoon-who were they again?<br />
<br />
His pecs squared out as he fondled his fiancé’s breasts, loving every bit of the jiggle as his very own was masculine. Mary groped them sheepishly, which only accentuated his erection, as his butt pushed out and rounded itself to a tight bubble butt. <br />
<br />
His back became wide and firm, large and muscular as he had to carry his gorgeous wife pretty often, but he loved it as he felt her boobs against his strong traps.<br />
<br />
Tight and stylish wisps of brown hair decorated his arms and his chest, trailing around his pecs and forming a nice treasure trail above his abs and dick. His balls surged in his new manhood as he made love with his wife.<br />
<br />
He licked his lips, wanting to kiss her so badly for the hundredth time, as his legs kicked aside his former homo self, growing longer and much thicker than they were before, reaching a 6ft 2, matching his business partner’s height. They were both alpha males after all.<br />
<br />
As his legs grew more muscular, than they ever were, with accents of hair around them, his core tough and masculine enough that would dare make firm business deals, his feet larger and twice the size of his wife. He bellowed a loud shout as he came into his wife with an-<br />
<br />
“OOOOAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!” <br />
<br />
His seed was inside his gorgeous wife, and the final seed that eradicated his homosexual self, as Mary absorbed that, her pussy came and was dripping wet over how big Peter was, he was her rock and she was his virgin-well not virgin anymore.<br />
<br />
Peter gently cupped her cheeks as they kissed in bliss, forgetting their old selves and even the curse as they became one. Remaining and fated to be husband and wife for eternity as they continued to make love to one another like it was their first time again.<br />
<br />
The voice laughed, as it began to trail over to the other couples-or single fags that have already or have not yet been infected.</p>
