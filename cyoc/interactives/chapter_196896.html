<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike tried to formulate a plan. She guessed Sara had become one of the pink panties he had just hung up in the bathroom but she had no way of knowing which of those multiple pairs was his wife and he knew she had no way of communicating with him.<br />
 <br />
Mike also had a limited knowledge of how the medallion worked. Knowing that for 12 hours she was immune from further changes she didn’t hesitate to pick up the medallion. She also picked out a bra from Sara’s suitcase. Guessing that Sara had changed the same time he had therefore suspecting that most likely nothing would happen, she touched the medallion and bra to each of the pink panties hanging in the bathroom. As she expected nothing happened. She put the medallion in the room safe, deciding she would try again in the morning.<br />
<br />
There seemed to be nothing she could do to alleviate her situation other than wait for the 12 hours to be up. The sun was getting low outside so Mike decided to try and relax and take stock of her situation.  She found a bottle of wine in the minibar and some crisps and sat out on the patio to watch the sun set over the ocean.<br />
<br />
A thought occurred to her. If she and Sara were here then where were the kids? The room was large and luxurious but there was only one king sized bed in it, although the sofa did look as though it converted into a bed as well. Mike figured Sara must have left them at home. Tina and Andrew were old enough to look after the younger pair and they had done so previously although only for a night. Sara seemed to have packed enough of her own clothes for a week. Mike decided she should ring Tina and find out exactly what Sara had done. She used Sara’s phone, her own didn’t appear to be with them. Fortunately, she now had Sara’s fingerprints and was able to unlock the phone.<br />
<br />
Tina’s phone rang out. Mike left a message, simply “Hi Tina. Ring me when you can”. She currently had Sara’s voice so Tina should ring back on Sara’s phone.<br />
<br />
She left the same message on Andrew’s phone then rang the home phone. It too went to message bank. She guessed the kids were asleep. It would be the middle of the night back home.<br />
<br />
Giving up, Mike realised she was hungry. She had no idea as to when this body had eaten last. She found a menu and decided to order room service and have an early night.<br />
<br />
To do that though she had to clear the bed. She collected all the clothes still on the bed and tossed them into the second suitcase. As she did so Mike contemplated why Sara might have bought clothes belonging to each of the kids. Her best guess was that she intended on using the medallion to become the kids themselves. What a kinky idea? That would explain why there was only one change of clothes for each person. He imagined being Andrew for a day or little Brad. It would be very interesting to feel young once more.<br />
<br />
Mike picked out the polo shirt that belonged to Andrew. It would be a better fit on her current body than the shirt of ‘Mike’s’ that she was currently wearing. She wanted to look presentable when room service arrived but wasn’t prepared to put on female clothes. She took off the baggy ‘Mike’ shirt and pulled on Andrew’s shirt. It was a better fit but it seemed to make Mike’s breasts more prominent. She could see her nipples protruding. That was probably why women wore bras. <br />
<br />
She decided to try Andrew’s shorts as well. They had a smaller waist and the board shorts she was currently wearing were hanging too low. It was only her wide hips that were keeping them up at all. Andrews shorts were certainly a better fit but they were tight about Mike’s bum. It made Mike aware of just how fleshy her bum now was. <br />
<br />
That done she closed the suitcase and placed it into the wardrobe. <br />
<br />
Mike did not realise that the pair of tights he had thrown in the suitcase was actually his younger daughter - the only member of his family that the medallion would actually have worked on. Kimmy found herself locked in a dark suitcase which Mike placed in the wardrobe where it would be out of the way.<br />
<br />
With the arrival of her room service now imminent Mike went to the bathroom. Sara was always fussy about her appearance and Mike realised she would not be happy if Mike pretended to be her with such messy hair. She had seen Sara’s vanity kit in the bathroom when he had been hanging out the panties. Now Mike retrieved a hair brush and tried to brush Sara’s long brown locks. It was weird watching Sara’s reflection. He noticed the make-up in the kit but was not prepared to go there. Sara always wore make-up but surely she would understand? She glanced at the panties drying on the rail. One of those was most likely Sara and she would be currently watching what Mike was doing.<br />
<br />
Sara was indeed watching her husband. She had also figured out what had happened. She had essentially swapped bodies with him, even if at the time Mike’s body had been a pair of her pink panties. She did not approve of what Mike was wearing and was trying to will him to put on some make-up. Why would Mike be wearing Andrew’s shirt when she had bought all her nicest dresses along? Was he intending to go out looking like he currently was? She was horrified at the thought but had no way of communicating with him.<br />
<br />
Also watching were Andrew, Tina and Brad. They were not fully aware that they had been changed to pink panties as well. They couldn’t understand why their mother was unable to change them back into their human forms. They had seen her press the medallion to them but nothing had happened. They were all very worried.</p>
