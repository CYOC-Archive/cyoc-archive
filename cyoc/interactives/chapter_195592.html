<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Neil knew he very well should not do this. He needed to be concentrated more upon the details of the changes currently going on at the gym, and try to find out what the cause was - and whether he could halt the progress of the changes, without undoing the absolute boon he had received from the transformation. Because even if Neil was apprehensive about more transformations, he was only human - he could recognize that so far the changes had helped him 1) have sex with Sandra 2) have sex with Bradley and 3) feel contented in his bodily shape. He was a big bodybuilder guy now, and there was...a sense of power in that, something Neil had never exactly had before when he was put upon so much by Matt.<br />
<br />
Speaking of whom, Neil was curious where Matt was right now again. Maybe he did just come in later in the day or somehow even earlier, but Neil wanted to know for his own sake what was happening to Matt. Surely if this was all just making people buffer, that didn&#39;t explain Matt. The very fact of Matt&#39;s more effeminate changes meant something was going on here beyond just some sort of accelerated growth. The sexuality? Could it be part of this? Or a side effect...?<br />
<br />
Well, he needed more answers - and right now, the two guys he had managed to turn from enemies even just a week ago into being really buddy-buddy were wanting to go to the steam room with him. They had undergone the same speed of transformation Neil had, though theirs seemed to be strikingly different in the details. If Neil had to guess, Lucas was...there was either something going on with his tan or even with his racial background...<br />
<br />
And Brock Medina. Brock was enormous and brawny, but it was pretty obvious at a cursory enough look that Brock was older. Quite a deal older. Neil wondered how old Brock was physically - and given the fact it seemed Brock was still mentally as young as he ever was, how long it might take for some element of that aging effect to manifest.<br />
<br />
Racial transformation and aging...and whatever was going on besides.<br />
<br />
Neil finally just nodded, &quot;Yeah, yeah...sorry for spacing out there.&quot; He noted he was looking in the mirror again...<br />
<br />
Brock chuckled, &quot;No problem. You were probably distracted by all of the gains, haha!&quot; He slapped Neil&#39;s back, though his hand stayed there and felt Neil&#39;s muscles there a bit. Brock licked his lips, &quot;Hot damn. Big and jacked everywhere.&quot; Neil admitted he wasn&#39;t exactly opposed to this. Regardless if it was naturally him or some effect of this change, he was definitely bisexual - and having Brock touching him wasn&#39;t exactly something he was averse to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Neil said with a smile, &quot;I figure we can talk a bit more about you guys&#39; uh...experience...in the steam room, right?&quot; He hoped they didn&#39;t leap right into nothing but sex. Because honestly, Neil didn&#39;t know how much he could withstand before he&#39;d let his newly minted libido take the reins. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, sure, bro,&quot; Lucas started leading the way in toward the steam room. The steam room at 20 Fitness was right by the locker room, just past the men&#39;s locker room door. Brock followed along, checking out Neil and Lucas all the while. As they walked in eyesight of some of the squat racks, Brock eyed one of the women on the squat rack.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s looking pretty good today, eh?&quot; Brock commented with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh baby, I see what you mean,&quot; Lucas responded, &quot;Maybe a bit later. Once we&#39;re done helping ourselves to Neil here...oh. What do you think, man? Same tastes as Brock?&quot;<br />
<br />
Admittedly, Neil definitely saw the appeal. She had a very nice, muscular tush, and her breasts strained a top that had obviously been chosen for the sake of leaving little to the imagination. He swore he could see every single fucking dimple on that sweet ass every time she squatted down. Neil didn&#39;t know when he clenched his hand to try and keep himself from getting too obviously hard, but it happened.<br />
<br />
Brock moved over and cupped Neil&#39;s groin as he jarred Neil back into the waking world, &quot;Woah, and you were saying we get too into sex...wow, somebody&#39;s packing, bro.&quot; A few rubs made Neil gulp, and let out a heavy breath. Right out here, just a little ways away from the steam room...and they were fooling around. Ohh fuck... Neil managed to control himself and went along, playfully swatting Brock&#39;s hand away from his increasingly hard manhood.<br />
<br />
As they approached it, Neil wondered how this was going to go.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d never exactly been involved with something like this. His experience so far had been with Bradley, and that was that. He&#39;d gave Neil something to expect, some experience to use to gauge how things were supposed to go, but he doubted that encompassed everything gay sex was. Honestly, on some level, Neil felt eager to do this. To broaden his experience. Surely if he went along with these guys, it&#39;d help his overall lovemaking capabilities...right?<br />
<br />
Brock and Lucas were walking over to the door, guiding him over.<br />
<br />
The door opening was like walking into a desert.<br />
<br />
Neil had never used the steam room before, and thus he had never experienced the heat and the atmosphere inside. A breath escaped Neil&#39;s mouth as he registered the sharp difference between the gym out there, a nicely cool, crisp temperature, and the stark heat inside of the steam room. The room itself was very wide, and extended in almost a rectangular position, with long benches along the walls. There was a thin table at the middle, and several clothes hooks on the walls - all likely intended for...for people to---<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Brock said with a cocky smirk, &quot;Lets do this. Clothes off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly? Could barely wait.&quot; Lucas answered and thus, both he and Brock started stripping off right in front of a starstruck and increasingly lustful Neil. The blond bodybuilder swooned as he registered the two sights. Lucas&#39; perfectly toned and sculpted body, resting on the bench, cock flopping between his legs. Lucas&#39; countenance making every bit of his body stand out all the more.<br />
<br />
Brock&#39;s weathered skin and massive build were utterly eye catching. Even with how aged Brock was, it lent a sense of establishment to the bulky, mass monster body sprawled out across from Lucas. The two of them were obviously enjoying the atmosphere...and it was increasingly obvious they had probably done something like this before. Probably even had sex in here before.<br />
<br />
Neil reminded himself he needed to keep control. Keep his mind in power over his body and libido. He needed to be able to ask questions during this, and---and try and interpret the answers he got. He could not just believe this all sprung up from nihilo. There had to be something, anything, and he intended fully to find out what that was. He kept all this in mind as he stripped off his clothes, hanging them up besides Brock and Lucas&#39; apparel. He heard them gasp, whoop and catcall as his cock came out. <br />
<br />
He guessed he was of pretty good size even relative to these two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...dude,&quot; Brock moved over as soon as Neil took a seat and began acclimating, &quot;This your first time in here? Heh, guess I should give you a nice welcome.&quot; Neil gasped as he registered Brock starting to give him a handjob - but for now, Neil managed to retain control of himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...you guys don&#39;t remember like...a week ago? Anything weird going on?&quot; He asked even as he tried to keep himself from propping fully up into erection - though Brock made that difficult. Neil continued, &quot;Any weird lights? Things uhh...things going on like, with any uhh, employees---?&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil found it even harder (pardon the pun) when Lucas moved over as well and started openly groping Neil&#39;s chest, even going as far as licking his nipple, while joining Brock in primping and touching Neil&#39;s manhood. For now though, Neil managed to retain control - though that was getting slightly shakier. For their part, Brock spoke on the subject, &quot;Naahh, nothing crazy like aliens or anything. No like, weirdness going on late in the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas&#39; hand moved to touching Neil&#39;s balls, drawing a moan out of Neil as he did this. Neil for his part recognized this needed to be a two way street, so when he started fondling Lucas&#39; cock, he was rewarded by the dark skinned athlete grunting in his ear and whispering, &quot;Ohh yeah Neil, keep at it.&quot; Neil for his part indeed kept going, trying to keep his eyes on the prize while also keeping these two involved in this sexual occasion. If he could draw it out, he might get somewhere. He might be able to...<br />
<br />
Brock spoke up, running a hand through his hair, &quot;Whew, man...hey, Neil, mind if we take this to the next level?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you mean?&quot; Neil asked, face a little flush.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; Brock said with a smile as he got up and then slapped his ass then and there, &quot;I want you to put that amazing tool you&#39;ve got going on...and fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil paused, wondering if he could retain control during such a sex act. Continue the talk and look into things, ask the relevant questions. He was already feeling turned on enough that it might prove a distraction to a light degree. But going that far? He didn&#39;t know if he could fully control himself...and right now, with Brock offering that kind of thing to him...Neil didn&#39;t know if he even wanted to. Surely if he just...indulged...he could ask afterwards...?<br />
<br />
No...no! Neil bit his lip and thought about it. But then Lucas spoke up, &quot;Hey, soon as you&#39;re done with my bro&#39;s sweet booty, I want my turn. If you&#39;re still up for it when you&#39;re done, I wanna see how tight that booty of yours is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil gulped, wondering what he got himself into.<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
As Max continued on with the treadmill, he wondered about the young woman he had increasingly developed an intensive attraction to. At first he wondered if he might be able to make the first move soon, but he could tell increasingly over time that she was looking at him. And it seemed going by her blush - as brief as it was - that she liked what she saw. And this only contributed to turning Max on, making him lightly chew his lip a little. He had never - ever - been looked at in the way the young woman had looked at him. It was a look reserved for muscular jocks, the admiration of their body and the fruits of their hard work...<br />
<br />
...But then, Max as of now was bigger than a lot of the jocks had been, and he was feeling...confident. Cocky even. He wanted to let her know. Let her know he too appreciated his muscles. But he didn&#39;t want to just go &quot;Hey you like what you see babe?&quot; He wanted to handle this...better. As the current circuit on the treadmill ended, he got off and without even thinking of it stepped off to wipe his forehead with his shirt.<br />
<br />
Inadvertently (?) exposing his muscled abdominals - yet another thing he had never really had before.<br />
<br />
As of now his abs were slightly puffy, and remained in a shape that alluded to his starting point, but the fact was he was looking just so much better than he ever had before. And by the time he finished dabbing his forehead and clearing his vision of any sweat, he turned and found himself looking at his beautiful brunette from the treadmill. She chuckled, &quot;Oh, oh I swear I wasn&#39;t staring! I was just...I wanted to ask you how often and like---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I get it...I mean...&quot; He shook his head, &quot;It&#39;s uh, it&#39;s okay if you were. Honestly, I came from pretty much nothing. So staring is more flattering to me than it might be to anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Really...?&quot; She said, looking astonished. As far as she&#39;d been concerned, she just saw this big near on bodybuilder kind of guy doing his daily cardio, and thought she might&#39;ve been...being creepy. But Max had said that and now she kind of felt complicated. Admittedly, she got it - she kind of felt the same way. She had been &quot;the fat girl&quot; in middle school after all. She said, &quot;Oh, my name&#39;s Clara...Gordon. Clara Gordon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ahh so that was her name.<br />
<br />
Clara Gordon... Max nodded, and said, &quot;My name&#39;s Max Walmann.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Max Walmann?&quot; Clara inquisitively asked, and then gasped, &quot;You really put on a lot of size! I remember you even just like, a week ago! Wow! Something&#39;s...is something going on here? I mean nobody just goes from zero to one hundred like you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah, if you think I&#39;m impressive, you should see my buddy Neil. He got me into the gym here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And Neil Booth got huge too?&quot; Clara gasped, and looked at Max. She knew she needed to try and figure more things out. But she was exhausted after her cardio workout, and honestly, she was taken with Max. Just how eager he was after so long with that kind of body...she related, and she understood where he came from. And maybe more, pending on how things might go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Max?&quot; Clara asked as she looked him over. Oh yeah. Call her a shallow person, but she definitely appreciated a muscular body as one of her big &quot;things&quot;. And Max definitely had that, plus his kinda dorky charm. That plus his whole muscle man act was a kind of combined appeal that Clara honestly hoped he never got rid of or something. Never outgrew or whatever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; He answered, realizing increasingly what this was looking like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you...wanna head out to the cafe just down the street? Well, if you&#39;re done, that is.&quot; Clara said, a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
Max contemplated for a minute. It seemed like Neil went off with those guys for some reason. Matt&#39;s friends...it was all so incredibly weird. Could it be something related to whatever&#39;s going on here at the gym? Max decided he needed to just trust Neil to handle these kinds of things. He had no way, after all, to know the situation Neil was in right now. So he nodded, &quot;Yeah I&#39;m...pretty much done. Lemme go change clothes and I&#39;ll join you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a date.&quot; And with those words, Clara sent Max&#39;s whole world swooning as he almost dashed toward the locker room to freshen up.<br />
<br />
<i>A date!</i> Max thought to himself as he ignored some noises from the steam room, <i>I have a date!</i></p>
