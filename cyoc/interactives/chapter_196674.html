<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Nudity warning is more for the mention of certain bits, not actually showing them.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were a bit lost over things as you stood there in a section of woods behind the home that you and your father had moved into after he married Christian Monique. The woman had been beautiful and kind to your father, but there had been some things that always seemed a bit off to you as she would always head off into the woods after dinner, leaving you to go to bed and your father doing the same not long after. Christian had always returned in the following morning, but the fact that she&#39;d seemed to head off into the woods seemed to raise questions, but you didn&#39;t want to raise anything because your dad had seemed happy, and Christian hadn&#39;t done anything cruel to him or to you.<br />
<br />
Now, however, there were additional surprises. As Christian had approached you and invited you into the woods with her, which was a surprise, particularly as your father had already gone to bed. Given how close your father and Christian had seemed, a part of you figured that if this conversation was to be done in the way it&#39;s gone so far that your father would be involved. But he wasn&#39;t, which perplexed you a bit, and Christian&#39;s decision to strip off her clothes in front of you was even more surprising, though as a young man in your last year of High School, it was at the point were turning away was hard, even though you knew that Christian was your stepmother. But then the absolute biggest surprise was that Christian was a fairy and had a daughter and that both of them wanted to turn you into a fairy. Christian apparently wanted you as a daughter to her and her daughter, Princess Wellowyn, wanted you as a potential lover. A part of you was interested, but you presently had too many questions to really make any sort of decision in that regard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... wait...&quot; you spoke raising your hands and stepping back, even as Wellowyn tried to beckon you toward the large flower that she had come out from behind a few moments earlier, &quot;you&#39;re fairies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Christian said softly, &quot;I am Queen Chrysanthemum of the Forests of Moniqueer. And this is my daughter, Wellowyn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, your name isn&#39;t Christian?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is... it&#39;s just that Chrysanthemum in the fae language translates into Christian in your language,&quot; Christian answered, &quot;English, I believe it is called.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we have the word Chrysanthemum in our language,&quot; you commented, &quot;it&#39;s the name of a flower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Curious,&quot; Christian commented with a soft smile, &quot;your father said the same thing when I explained things to him before we married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He knows...&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Christian answered, &quot;as I said... we fae are a good judge of character and I saw in your father the qualities I would want in a romantic partner. And something that would fill a void in my heart since my previous partner Queen died... Thus, when it came time for the wedding, I had to tell your father as I could not... would not... hide the truth from your father. I love your father too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all so... surprising,&quot; you said while rubbing your head with one hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;That my mom could fall in love?&quot; Wellowyn asked, her voice sounding a bit more suspicious.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... the whole fairy thing and everything else....&quot; you answered, &quot;it&#39;s all things I... I&#39;ve never seen before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... that is something that many humans have,&quot; Christian said slowly, &quot;our people and all the magical peoples left your realm on Earth a long time ago...&quot;<br />
<br />
From there Christian then recounted a long history on how all the mythical/magical races once lived with humanity on Earth, but there was often conflict between the various races. Humans feared some and resented others and this led to hunts, persecution, and what studies humanity made was in how to kill the various magical races. Some like werewolves escaped for a time because they could naturally shapeshift and the fae helped others with their magic to grant shapeshifting abilities, but it didn&#39;t end the problems and also lead to when humans found them, they were often alone. It ultimately led to the Fairy Queens of every &quot;Queendom&quot; creating another realm that was a sort of parallel world to the one you had lived in. The mythical and magical races moved there for safety, but for various reasons soon ran into troubles that eventually came from a narrowing gene pool, which ultimately lead to those like Christain crossing between their realm and yours to find love and partners.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a lot...&quot; you said slowly, &quot;but... why would you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The fae can live for a long time, but we are not immortal,&quot; Wellowyn commented, &quot;and that&#39;s assuming that someone doesn&#39;t use iron or pollution against us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you just recruit humans to join you and become fae?&quot; you asked to Christian.<br />
<br />
&quot;I assume you are asking about fae reproduction?&quot; Christian asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you did say all fairies are female,&quot; you pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... female in the way that you would tend to think on gender issues,&quot; Christian nodded, &quot;though, it can be complicated. For in many ways... we are like flowers, and thus why I wished to use the Gossomer Flower to turn you into a new daughter and as Wellowyn&#39;s half-sister. Fairies do not have all of the equipment that you would associate with human women. Our... &quot;clitoris&quot; is really closed flower blossom. When aroused with a partner fairy, that flower will &quot;bloom&quot; and extend to reveal the petals that will hold the nectar and reveal the opening to the pistil, which in a fairy is internal, and the stamen that will carry the nectar to that fairy&#39;s partner. The actual act will then mimic what humans call sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When a child among fairies is conceived, the nectar from one will find the seed in the other,&quot; Wellowyn spoke, &quot;Queen Chrysanthemum is my seed mother. Her former partner... killed by dwarves&#39; mining... is my nectar mother... a combination of the magic of both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how were you born?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Essentially the same way human children are born,&quot; Christian answered, &quot;it&#39;s a complicated part on how magic works and how all the magical/mythical races have some connections with humanity in some way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you want me to become a fairy, too?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... as a family,&quot; Christian began slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are strong, a defender of what you feel to be right, even if a bit confused,&quot; Wellowyn said to you, &quot;and this wasn&#39;t something I expected as I am younger than Queen Chrysanthemum... but... I would want you to become a fairy... to be MY partner and future wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t I just be a husband as I am?&quot; you asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could,&quot; Wellowyn said slowly, &quot;but then, you&#39;d die of old age in about eighty or ninety years and my mother won&#39;t even be middle aged by that time. I&#39;d then lose one I love very much, and my heart would be broken. As a fairy, you and I would be together for a long time and could raise our daughters together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t be that deeply in love with someone you just met,&quot; you said her a bit nervously, &quot;I mean... my dad and my mom dated for about a year before they got married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you are thinking in human terms,&quot; Christian spoke, &quot;the fae swim in magic and it&#39;s partly what makes us a good judge of character. And it is something that survives in all your fairy tales. People falling in love at first sight. It something that despite humanity&#39;s past fears and wars with the magical/mythical races that the connections between our races remained. We faded into stories in your world and those fairy tales were part of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I am,&quot; you said slowly, &quot;but then, I am still human. I&#39;d make sense for me to think that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked over to Wellowyn, who stood there with a bit of a pout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Princess Wellowyn,&quot; you said to her, &quot;you are very cute... and given that Christian has been willing to answer my questions, and I get the sense that part of her bringing me here was to answer those questions or provide a means for them to come out. So, I don&#39;t think that your mother would do anything to hurt my dad or me. But it&#39;s all still new, and you may feel you know me through your magic... and perhaps you do. But I still know very little about you, other than that you&#39;re my stepsister, whom I&#39;m only just meeting now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My daughter was too young... the council of Queens told me I could not take her with me when I was courting your father,&quot; Christian spoke, &quot;and they only tolerated your entry into our realm because of the marriage between your father and I.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... but...&quot; you managed and still looked to Wellowyn, &quot;couldn&#39;t we just date a bit? Get to know each other first? Or at least let me get to know you before making this sort of decision?&quot;</p>
