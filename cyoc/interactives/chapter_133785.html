<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taylor woke up halfway into the night having to pee. She groggily made her way to the bathroom, say down and peed, then made her way back. In the dim light coming from the bedroom windows she could see Jason&#39;s form lying on the bed. What she saw that interested her was that Jason was asleep but was at full mast under the covers, forming a large tent in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is an opportunity that&#39;s not to be wasted&quot; she thought deviously. Before she got into bed she had the thought that the tent in the covers looked a little bit too big for Jason to produce, but shrugged it off as a trick of the light.<br />
<br />
Crawling into bed again, careful not to wake Jason up, she moved under the covers and positioned her mouth over his penis. Lowering her lips to his balls she sucked on them for a second before she licked from the bottom to the top of his cock. As she moved her tongue along his penis she couldn&#39;t help but make a face. His penis tasted a lot stronger than normal. It tasted salty and sweaty and much more musky than she was used to, with a hint of acidity thrown in. <br />
<br />
This was not what she expected but she took it as a result of the long ride mixed with not showering. Not wanting to stop her ministrations, she licked it a few more times, starting to get used to the flavor. With the last lick she slowly started at his balls and licked all the way up his length, closing her eyes and moaning a little at the top. The taste was really starting to get to her. She was actually enjoying it and savored it. <br />
<br />
She swirled her tongue around the top of his shaft then closed her lips around it and moved her face up and down so that she was giving him a proper blow job. The texture of his cock definitely felt off too, but she was so groggy that she didn&#39;t think about it much. She just kept sucking and moving her tongue around his length that was inside of her mouth, all the while getting more of that addicting flavor. She blew him for as long as she could before she thought he <br />
might come. Her lips came off the top of his cock wth a slight pop and she felt giddy with sexual excitement. He might not be awake to enjoy this but she certainly was and enjoy it she would. She felt his penis with her hand, making sure it was nice and wet and ready for<br />
Her, though her pussy had been dripping fluids onto the bed for a while now. With great care, she pulled the blanket off Jason and squatted over him. His cock seemed huge but she was happy with the fact that it seemed that way, not stopping to be concerned that it was or might be.<br />
<br />
She grabbed his cock around the middle, not noticing the bump in it from his medial ring, and slid the head back and forth between her pussy lips a bit. She bit her lip, closed her eyes and groaned, so needing this. She was starting to have juices run down her thigh she was so wet. Lining up the head with her vagina, she lowered herself onto him and popped his clock into after having used more force than she was used to. She threw her head back and moaned loudly, but Jason did not wake from this even, so tired was he. While squatting on the bed and with his cock in her, she rode him up and down at a fast pace that slowly increased. He was huge in her, and every time he got a few inches into her she felt something even higher that only served to drive her wild and really stimulate her, that being his medial ring. Eventually she was slamming herself up and down on him, crying loudly and moaning &quot;oh Jason! Oh Jason!&quot; And yet he still did not wake. Finally she could feel him spurt inside of her and with that she slammed herself down on him, getting him as far inside of her as she could and the cum as well, into the deepest parts of her. She thought she could feel it splatter her cervix. &quot;AHHHHHHH!!&quot; She screamed as she finally came too, and hard, her juices gushing put around his cock, with a little bit of admen escaping too.she sat on him panting, with her chest heaving a bit, looking down at him and smiling and laughing a bit. That was the most amazing sex they had had in a long time and he wasn&#39;t even awake for it.<br />
<br />
After she was ready and he was a bit softer she lifted one leg and pulled herself off him. She kneeled there for a moment, smiling and looking down at him and feeling very contented. Then she turned, flipped backwards and pulled the covers over herself to go to sleep.</p>
