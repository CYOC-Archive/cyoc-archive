<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick kept back far enough he didn&#39;t think the centaur would notice him, but the big creature stopped and looked back as soon as they were out of the main resort area and pointed to a stack of large bags.  &quot;Make yourself useful, boy!  Carry some of that grain back to the stables.&quot;  Considering the centaur could have probably hauled the whole load himself, Derrick had to bite back a retort that would have exposed him right off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes sir.&quot;  He hefted a bag, grunting under what must be a hundred pounds.  Though he was younger and smaller than he had been before, he found that it wasn&#39;t as hard as he expected.  Plodding behind the centaur, he followed the rest of the way to stables.  An ugly  creature looking like a cross between a horse and human took the feed effortlessly and carried it off, leaving Derrick free to stare in amazement.  The mix of creatures here was incredible!  Besides centaurs like the one he had followed, there were winged horses, minotaurs, griffins, satyrs, and regular-looking horses and donkeys.  And lots of the ugly attendants, who seemed to be doing most of the work.  It struck him that there were no other humans around that he could see - he stuck out.  <br />
<br />
Remembering the faun&#39;s advice, he grabbed a bucket and tried to find something to do.  One of the workers was  filling water buckets in another part of the stables, and he figured out what do by watching.  It was surprising how much work it took - first you dumped the old water into a stone sink, then you used a brush to wipe away residue from the inside and rinse, then you filled up the bucket with fresh water from a basin next to sink.  After that, you carried the heavy water bucket back to the stall and moved to the next one.  After the first two stalls, Derrick worked into a rhythm that made the work go easier.  Instead of getting tired, he felt satisfaction as he finished up the stable section and looked for something else to do.  <br />
<br />
He watched one of the workers muck a stall with a long-tined pitchfork, puzzling over how the creature threw the straw against the side.  The worker saw him and motioned for him to enter, then handed him the tool.  Derrick tried to imitate the motions, and heard the worker whinny a laugh.  Curious, wide, flat, three-fingered hands guided his movements through a few scoops, and he was aware of a strong sweat and urine smell that was not unpleasant.  The worker&#39;s hide was warm and damp, and it even more male than Derrick, though the occasional brush of sheath and testicles did not exactly feel sexual.  <br />
<br />
It took a little more coaching, but Derrick finally figured out how to flip the bedding up to separate clods of manure and then scoop the waste up and move it to a crude wheelbarrow outside the stall.  As before, he set up a rhythm and felt satisfaction at leaving a formerly dirty stall clean and fresh.  The place was big enough that even with more than a dozen of the workers obviously busy as he was, there was no break until the sun started down.  Following the workers&#39; example, Derrick put his tools away and followed them to a large open area that apparently served as their quarters.  Two things struck him at once - he was bigger than he had been at the start, and he felt perfectly at home here.<br />
<br />
There were no mirrors, but he could compare himself to the workers, who had looked 7 feet tall before.  He was still shorter, but not by nearly as much - probably close to 6 feet.  His body was different, too - arms and legs were longer, and his hands were broader and flatter.  Muscles rippled under thick skin, and his feet were curiously wide and hard.  More like the workers&#39; hooves.  Considering the drastic changes the faun had managed in a few seconds, Derrick wasn&#39;t really alarmed.  Just looks, which were easy to reverse.  He didn&#39;t even think the workers were ugly now that he had been with them for most of the day.  Different, of course, but practical and perfect for their tasks.  Many of them used the long, flat fingers instead of rakes.  He stiffened as some of those strong hands closed around his shoulders and neck and started to massage muscles.  One of the workers was behind him, and Derrick groaned in pleasure and leaned back against the furred chest.  The worker&#39;s heavy sheath was pressed into the small of his back,  and he felt the horselike cock start to push out between them.<br />
<br />
Instead of being repulsed, Derrick found that he was coming erect as well.  The worker began sliding his cock between them while Derrick used his larger hands to good purposes on his own. The massage became an embrace as they both built rapidly to climax, Derrick shooting a thick jet of semen with a grunt a good minute before his partner sent even more in short geyser that splattered against the back of Derrick&#39;s neck and head.<br />
<br />
The sexual release also seemed to trigger a deep need to sleep.  Derrick and the worker slid down to the straw-covered dirt and embraced each other as the sudden fatigue hit.  Although he was dazed and confused, Derrick was overwhelmed by a tremendous sense of satisfaction and accomplishment that sent him into slumber with a smile on his face.</p>
