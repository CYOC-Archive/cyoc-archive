<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was thinking of what to do with Aidan. He could change him however he wanted, and he had just the right idea. It would make Aidan useful and decorative at the same time. Oh, Aidan will hate it, that’s for sure.<br />
Aidan didn´t know what to make out of Marks look. Beside the longer Mark thought about what to do with Aidan, the smaller the chance got he would just be himself afterwards.<br />
Mark than smiled about his idea and started with: “First I want you to strip out of the rest of your clothes, so I see the base for your predicament.”<br />
Aidan turned red in embarrassment for the stripping, but also feared what Mark had planned. His socks, jeans and underwear fell on the already discarded shirt right next to him as he stood now naked before Mark.<br />
Mark grinned at Aidan´s earlier mistake, thinking it was Aidan´s normal gear down there. But then he continued: “I want your legs to shrink mostly away, until your feet are nearly direct under your pelvis and next to your gear. They will face away in a 120-degree angle to each other and freeze in position. At the same time, you will grow a tail above your ass that will take the third spot of the 120-degree circle around you and lock in that position as well.”<br />
Aidan looked at Mark in fear. With legs that short he couldn´t run away even when his feet weren´t locked in place. And why a tail? Said tail pushed out above his ass, taking the flesh from his shrinking legs to gain length behind him. By the time his legs stopped shrinking you could barely see any legs at all, only a small bulge of flesh above his feet remained of them, resembling his knees. The tail had grown to at least a meter in length, bend down to the same level as his feet before winding up in a spiral against his back, still flesh-colored. Then both his feet turned away from each other and froze in position like Mark wanted them to, the tail following suit. Not that Aidan could move any other body-part at the moment.<br />
Mark looked down to him, smiling. “You know, I think I forgot to say what your body should look like later on. As you know, my room at home is dragon themed, so I want your feet to look like dragon-like paws with claws and everything. Your tail will gain a couple of spikes and all around you lower body will grow dark-blue scales to cover your skin. Only exception will be your cock and balls, which will shrink away. There will be one light blue scale to mark that spot where they have been. Then your arms can grow shorter on your sides while also getting covered in scales. Your hands will change to look like dragon paws, with you will hold up in front of your body afterwards, inside up.”<br />
Aidan´s fear of Mark only increased after that. Was Mark turning him into some decoration for his room? The merging of his toes and his fingers was uncomfortable, but not painful. But he would have screamed in pain when the claws pressed out of them. Also, the growing spikes pressed painfully through his skin. Then his skin started to be covered step by step in a layer of dark-blue scales. At least that wasn´t painful to him. Like his legs before his arms begun to shorten until they were little longer than his legs were now, with his elbows pointing outwards. His hands then were moved in front of him about three inches below his shoulders, the claws all pointing outwards. Finally, his cock was pushed back into his body with his balls, shrinking away to make room for the one light blue scale. Nothing could be seen of his former cock and balls afterwards. Through the pain he had tears in his eyes, easily flowing down his cheeks as his only way to show his pain.<br />
Mark was still smiling down at Aidan. He loved the power he had over him and enjoyed watching the changes, but he wanted to go on, ignoring Aidan´s pain. “You look good so far, but for something resembling a dragon there is something missing. Therefore, I want you to grow some wings from your back, which will frame your body from there. The tips will just touch your fore-paws in the end. Their highest point will be beside where your ears are right now. But there will be an opening between them right behind your head. Your torso will round a bit more to a good shape, as it should be more like a cylinder between your limbs. Your scales will climb up your body and only stop at your neck.”<br />
Aidan just sat there in shocked silence, not that he could do anything but cry as the wings burst out his back, just to fold around him like a cape. He felt the gentle touch of them at his paw’s sides, but they felt wrong to him, much like the tail. He was a human being, not some dragon themed decoration. His body pushed out a bit to shape into a cylindrical way, pushing his hind-paws a bit forward, scraping the carpet. But he felt nearly nothing of that through the scales, and any covered skin felt number to him.<br />
Mark´s smile widened as he saw Aidan´s state. Nearly finished with the changes. “Now that your body is finished and only your head remains unchanged, it´s time to move on to that. Your neck will grow a bit longer and move backwards through the opening between your wings, until your eyes are between that opening. Then you will grow a draconic muzzle out of your face until its front reaches above the front of your cylindrical body again. It will also be covered in the same scales as your body is. Your eyes will grow a bit and shape rounder, as your ears will vanish under the scales, but you will still be able to hear. When your completely covered in scales afterwards, you will be completely unable to move anything yourself, and your scales will be hard as rocks, so you won´t be deformed by any outside force.”<br />
Aidan looked on as his head moved backwards as his neck grew longer. Soon his field of vision was limited through his wings and he could mostly look ahead, over his now growing muzzle. It felt surreal to him that his mouth and nose stretched this far outwards, it was even weirder than the wings and the tail. When his eyes reshaped, they also hardened, making him unable to move them, now really limited to look straight ahead. The scales that covered his head ended in his going bald, as his hair dropped to the floor behind him. What the hell is Mark´s plan for him, he asked himself as the scales hardened and any movement ceased.<br />
Mark seemed satisfied with how Aidan looked now. The muzzle covered the whole cylindrical body below, which was exactly what he had wanted. Now for the finishing of Aidan´s fate. “Now that your outside is finished, let´s finish the rest, namely your insides. You see, I want your insides to be empty, a completely hollow body, with only your limbs filled. With your cylindrical shape, you will become my new dustbin, that´s able to expand on the inside so everything fit´s in. Because it should be a fast way down, the underside of your muzzle will be directly connected to your body underneath, and your muzzle will easily be able to open by outside force. That will work by either hitting one of the claws on your hind paws, or by just pulling your muzzle up. The upside of your muzzle will be able to bend all the way up until your nostrils hit your head, and you will be able to see through it when it is opened. Your tongue will be like an inside lid that covers around half your opening. It will slightly go down towards it´s middle and the other side, so if any trash lands on it it can slide down. If needed, it can be rolled back by touching it´s tip. Whenever someone touches the lighter blue scale that had been your cock and balls, everything inside you will be absorbed into you without anything left, but only if your muzzle is closed. If someone let your muzzle open, no smell can leave your body, and only you will be able to taste and smell it. Oh, and if something is in you, it can´t be removed anymore by grabbing in. But if asked for something specific you have absorbed, it will be reappear on your fore-paws. Additional, if I say you swallow or eat something that´s near you, you will do so with your tongue, which only then can expand outwards.” Then Mark grinned cruelly at Aidan.<br />
Aidan would have screamed in horror if he still could. A dustbin? Mark couldn´t be serious. But he already felt his insides vanish and with a small pull felt the underside of his new muzzle connecting to his body. The skin and scales in between vanished, opening it up. His tongue bend like he half tried to roll it before it tipped down from the middle and froze in place. Nothing else seemed to happen, but everything other Mark said was no bodily change beside his muzzle opening, and that he couldn´t do himself.<br />
But Mark´s cruel grin showed his decision to test him out. So, Mark opened his muzzle around half and with a laugh dropped Aidan´s discarded clothes on his tongue, from were they slipped down into his empty body. Mark closed Aidan´s muzzle and tipped the light blue scale with his foot, making Aidan scream mentally at the pain of being kicked right there. It felt like his balls had been crushed, and that was beside the point he had them no longer. He felt his clothes being absorbed into him, and when Mark opened his muzzle a second time, Aidan could see he was empty again. Mark dropped Aidan´s backpack in next before closing him again, but this time didn´t do anything more. Aidan waited, but Mark opened him after around five minutes of waiting and tried to remove the backpack again, but couldn´t grab it.<br />
Laughing again, Mark walked to where Aidan´s shoes laid in the corner and selected three pairs of them. He positioned them in front of Aidan before saying: “Aidan, swallow the left, red shoe and the right, black shoe.” Much to Aidan´s disgust and Mark´s satisfaction, Aidan´s tongue shot out like the one of a frog to first collect the red shoe, followed by the black one. Both slipped down on top of his backpack. Next Mark ordered: “Aidan, eat the shoes in front of you.” This time Aidan collected all four remaining shoes in one go, and Mark laughed again.<br />
To test out the next commands, Mark stood on one of Aidan´s left hind-paw claws, which resulted in Aidan´s muzzle to open, before kicking the light scale. Aidan cried mentally in pain, but the shoes and his backpack remained inside. But Mark showed enough mercy to step back from the paw, closing Aidan´s muzzle, before hitting the scale again the third time, so the backpack and shoes were absorbed this time. Then he asked for the keys of the flat, which had been in Aidan´s jeans pocket when he absorbed them, and they appeared on his right fore-paw.</p>
