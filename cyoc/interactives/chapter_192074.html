<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“God damn it!” Tyler swore under his breath as he held the tape measure against his erect penis. The weekend had come and gone, and each morning he’d woken up, his cock had become a little shorter, a little thinner. It was Monday, and his cock was under six inches now, but still fairly girthy. His balls had also grown slightly smaller as well. Tyler sat down on the toilet and held his face in his hands, his hard dick softening as it made contact with the cold surface of the seat. He watched it relax and dwindle until it became soft, sticking out from his crotch only a few inches. Is that what its gonna be like hard? he wondered to himself. He sat up and reached for his phone; no new messages from Colby but he’d be back from his vacation soon enough; it wasn’t a long flight. It was almost noon and once again, Tyler had the house to himself the laundry list of chores his father had set up for him on Saturday morning had been quickly exhausted as Tyler was desperate to push his thoughts on his diminishing dick out of his mind. It was already over a hundred degrees outside; though he was uncertain about what to tell his friend, he was eager to relax out by the cool water, maybe even score some beers.<br />
<br />
He stood up to dress himself before leaving the bathroom, returning to his bedroom and flinging himself onto his bed with a groan. He looked down at his crotch, his smaller cock and balls barely making an impression against the fabric. How was he going to explain this to Colby? Bulging shorts and strained seams were just another part of being a large-dicked Man, his friend would surely notice the lack of a bulge in his swim trunks next time they met up at the river. Especially if both of their dicks kept changing at this rate. Colby was nine inches when they last texted on Friday. By now, it must have gained at least another two. The thought of his friend growing into his large-dick status made Tyler’s shrinking cock grow hard and his heart sink in his chest. It wasn’t just the loss of size; he’d noticed since dinner on Friday that food started to taste bland. Some of it had even made him sick. He hadn’t eaten anything since Sunday, and his stomach was starting to growl. To distract himself, he pulled up his phone and found himself snooping around on the internet.<br />
<br />
With some hesitation, Tyler typed the words “small-dick information” into the search bar and hit enter. Immediately several news posts and highlights from chat forums came up first, some of them derogatory or humiliating in nature. Tyler skipped over those until he found a link from Small-Dicks Anonymous, one of the largest small-dick advocacy groups in the country. He was shocked to learn that they were so rare; only one in a million young men transition into small-dicks when they become adults. He thought the term “feeding” was just a euphemism. His heart sunk even more as he read the section on Early Signs; less-developed body hair and musculature, penis shrinking at a rate of 0.3-0.7 inches per day for the last three weeks preceding the man’s birthday. Apaarently, his body would also develop a gradual distaste for and inability to digest most solid foods. His entire digestive system would rearrange itself to be able to digest a large-dick’s cum. Tyler couldn’t believe it; he’d always thought the term “feeding” had just been a joke. On the plus side, Tyler noted, he wouldn’t have to take a shit any more. Small-dicks could absorb almost 99% of the nutrients of a large-dick’s cum. <br />
<br />
Tyler read on, coming up to a section about the psychological aspects of the transition. For the first few days, maybe a week, it read, transitioning small-dicks go through the usually stages of grief as they come to terms with their body’s changes. Especially when there is a large-dick with whom the new small-dick interacts with regularly, and has a familiar relationship with them. He thought of Colby again; they had always been fast friends, ever since they were little kids. They’d confided in each other about a lot of things, but they’d never discuss what would happen if one of them was to become a small-dick. Well, they’d once had the hots for the same girl a few years ago, and that didn’t get between them. Mostly because she rejected both of them but still, Tyler knew the secret would come out eventually. He’d need a friend if he was going to make it through college as a…Tyler gulped…a small-dick. He took a deep sigh, his cock throbbing once again. <br />
<br />
He reached into his boxers and wrapped his hands around his shaft, shocking himself when he felt his entire hand wrap around it. Despite the loss of length and girth, his cock somehow felt more sensitive. He gasped and arched his breath slightly, taking a firm grip of his shaft and stroking himself at a slow pace. His other hand reached down to feel his balls; they two were smaller than normal, like a pair of large grapes rather than the heavy golf-balls he’d had between his legs since puberty. It’s getting so small, Tyler thought to himself, his cock throbbing and his balls clenching. He stopped his motion to shimmy out of his boxers before returning his hand to his cock and stroking it again awhile squeezing and mashing his balls against his crotch. His thoughts turned unbidden to the possibility of it growing smaller and thinner, until he couldn’t even stroke it anymore. Of his balls shrinking away until they couldn’t produce more than a few drops of cum. Why would they? He could get all the cum he needed from large-dicks, Real Men. Like his father.<br />
<br />
And Colby.<br />
<br />
And just before his climax broke, an image of his friend came into Tyler’s mind, of Colby naked and wet and sunkissed, one hand caressing his strong pectoral muscle while the other hefted he base of a cock that made Tyler’s jaw drop and his cock, no, his cocklet, explode in climax. He leaned back as his cock shot out a few small ropes of cum, his orgasm still radiating over him in spite of his small load. He tucked his arms under his head as he lay there, eyes closed, enjoying the aftershocks. If this is what a small-dick’s orgasm was like, Tyler thought, then he could get used to this. Jerking off his original dick had always felt good, but this was incredible. He could feel his orgasm in his balls, his jaw, his ass. His reveries were interrupted with a chime from his phone. <br />
<br />
Tyler reached for his boxers to clean himself off before grabbing his phone to check. It was a message from Colby. Tyler opened the message to find a picture, taken by Colby of a lazy river with Colby’s long, hairy legs stretched out over the graveled waterfront. His upper legs were in clear few, the red boxers stretched slightly around a tubular length running down his right thigh. Tyler could just make out the base of Colby’s bare, hairy stomach in the photo as he drank in the sight. Another message popped up.<br />
<br />
“At the river. Older bro scored me a six pack. You coming?” it read.<br />
<br />
Tyler’s eyes lingered on the view for a moment longer before he found himself responding “Sure thing, buddy. Be there in a minute.”<br />
<br />
“Better hurry before all the beer his gone small-dick.” Colby replied.<br />
<br />
Reading that made Tyler groan and his dick throb and harden. It’s getting stronger every time, He thought to himself. How is he going to talk to me once he knows? Tyler was conflicted; one hand he really wanted to confide in his friend and tell him what was happening to his body. But on the other, he was embarrassed and if he was honest with himself, a little ashamed. And if he were still being honest with himself, he was also startled but curious about his fantasies of his friend, of how enticing the bulge in Colby’s red swim trunks had looked. He wanted Colby to call him a small-dick and mean it, to demonstrate his superiority as a man by pulling out his growing meat and make Tyler beg for his meal. He could feel all of this, and it scared him. But it also thrilled him. His cock, no, it wasn’t going to be a cock anymore, he reminded himself. His cocklet was rock hard and leaking once again all over the bed. Tyler decided that he wanted to reveal himself to his friend, but he would have to be careful around the other men in town. Sure he was still a minor, but if any of them found out he was a small-dick they’d be all over him once he was eighteen. He caught himself smiling at the thought of hordes of men, desperate to patronize his small-dick status. <br />
<br />
Tyler dug around in his room until he found a pair of boxer-briefs, some swim-trunks, and a tank-top. He dressed himself, put on some sandals, grabbed his phone, keys, and wallet, and departed his room. He was surprised to find his father standing in the kitchen, shirtless and standing by the sink gulping down a glass of ice water.<br />
<br />
“Hey, buddy,” he said, letting out a deep sigh and setting the empty glass down. His hairy chest was flushed and sweaty, Tyler could almost smell it.<br />
<br />
“Wha, hey! Dad…What’re…what are you doing here?” he asked, trying to mask his feelings.<br />
<br />
“Its damn hot today. Had to come home to change my shirt.” He confessed, picking up the glass and returning to the fridge. Tyler took in the sight of his fathers strong back as the man filled his glass again, before snapping himself out of it just before James turned around to face him. “What do you have planned today?” he ask with genuine interest.<br />
<br />
“I was gonna meet up with Colby at the river. He and his family are back from Mexico.” Tyler said, deciding to take a seat in case his erection became noticeable. <br />
<br />
“Lucky bastard,” his father chuckled, joining him at the table. “Enjoy it while it lasts. You’re gonna be in the books all day once college starts.” His old man reminded him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Tyler chuckled nervously. Couldn’t’ he put on a shirt already?<br />
<br />
“Which reminds me,” His father leveled a serious gaze at Tyler. “I know your birthday is coming up in a few weeks. You’ll be making your transition soon and,”<br />
<br />
Tyler’s stomach curled into a knot. “Oh, god. Dad, I don’t wanna talk about this right now,” he said, his cheeks flushing.<br />
<br />
“Just listen,” his dad held up a hand. “I know us guys put a lot of pressure on you boys as you transition into adults. My father certainly did, but I just want you to know that I love you, no matter how you transition.” His stern gaze met Tyler’s eyes, and Tyler felt embarrassed, but he also did feel a little better.<br />
<br />
“So,” Tyler began with hesitation. “You wouldn’t get upset if I did turn out to be a, uh, small-dick?” he said, looking at the table.<br />
<br />
His father winced but sat pensieve for a moment before responding, “Well, no man thinks it would happen to them. But it has to happen to some people. You’re my only son, I guess I’ll have to find a way to live with it.” Tyler noticed his father said “I’ll have to”, and he wondered if James maybe already knew, or suspected.<br />
<br />
“Have you ever met a small-dick?” Tyler asked. His father had never really mentioned before if he did.<br />
<br />
James smiled. “Yes, once. In college; he was a legacy in our fraternity. All the expensive frats had a resident small-dick in those days. You could say it was their…college meal plan. This was before I met your mother, of course,” he added quickly, the smile becoming sheepish. “Look, just don’t give yourself to much hell. Go have fun with your friend and enjoy your summer. Look forward to your birthday party!” he said, pointing at him and raising his eyebrows.<br />
<br />
Tyler laughed and stood up from the table. “Yeah, don’t forget the bounce house,” he quipped. “Alright, later, Dad.” He said, turning to leave.<br />
<br />
His father gave him a quizzical look. “’Later, Dad’?” Who am I, your weed dealer? Give your old man a hug. Probably won’t see you all week.” James said, leaning back in his chair expectantly.<br />
<br />
Tyler looked from his father’s face to his bare, hairy chest and gulped, but obliged. He crossed over as his father stood up to embrace him, his big heavy arms wrapping themselves over Tyler’s shoulders and back. He’d hugged his father a million times over the course of his life, but for some reason this felt like the first time he’d ben held by a man, ever. His father’s body was war, soft with the fat of age but firm with muscle underneath. James’s chest was hard and meaty, his coarse chest hairs prickling against the almost hairless skin of Tyler’s chest. And below the waist, Tyler could feel the soft pressure of his father’s bulge pressed innocently against his thigh. His own cocklet was rock hard, but Tyler had been smart enough to tuck it up into his waistband before he’d stood up. His father broke the hug and chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Have fun, son. Don’t drink and drive,” his dad said, giving Tyler a playful shove on the shoulder before striding from the room, leaving Tyler feeling flustered for a moment before making for the front door and stepping outside.</p>
