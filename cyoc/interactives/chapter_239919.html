<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty thought for a bit, and returned to his bedroom. Sliding onto his computer, he was pleased to find that all of his old files still remained. He navigated to his hidden &quot;homework&quot; folder, the images of anime girls getting their minds scrambled by baseball-sized cocks greeting him. He absentmindedly went to a favourite series of his- He didn&#39;t know the name, but he did know the story.<br />
<br />
A high-school student, disappointed with his luck with women, decided to do something drastic about it. He summons a god at an old shrine, who transforms him into a hot girl, and he then proceeds to have hot lesbian sex for the next few hundred pages.<br />
<br />
Now, Ty knows that he could get any girl he wants now- hell, he can make any girl he wants now, as proven by the robot maids- but the idea of seducing a hot girl as a hot girl is too appealing to pass up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I was a girl,&quot; he declared. Immediately, he felt a hollow grow in his lower abdomen as his genitals and nipples began burning. His hands reached for them by themselves as his cock and balls began shrinking. A bolt of pleasure shot up his spine as his vagina formed, and he let out a squeaky &quot;Fuck!&quot; as his Adam&#39;s apple disappeared.<br />
<br />
He- now she- leaned back into the chair, waiting for more changes to happen... but the heat died down. &quot;What?&quot; She asked. Her voice wasn&#39;t even that different now! &quot;This is bullshit,&quot; she muttered. She knew that she wasn&#39;t exactly the manliest man around, but she had at least expected some tits. <br />
<br />
She walked to the ensuite, annoyance building as she looked at herself. Sure, she was a bit more feminine- no more scraggly half-beard thing anymore, thank god- but she could have probably done this entire change with makeup. <br />
<br />
She sighed. Looks like she would have to do it step by step. &quot;I wish I was 6 feet tall,&quot; she said. Immediately, her legs felt weak, and she had to hold onto the countertop to stop herself from falling down. Then, she grew 9 inches taller, each inch adding a bit of strength back to her legs. It also, however, began stretching out her clothes. &quot;I wish that my clothes would change to fit me!&quot; she quickly added, causing her pants legs to grow back to the floor. Her shirt, however, shrank, becoming a vest.<br />
<br />
She leaned down to see herself, which highlighted her disappointing lack of tits. &quot;I wish I had large breasts,&quot; she said. Instantly, her nipples warmed up again, and they grew quickly... to not much bigger. They were less orbs and more bumps. &quot;I wish my breasts were even larger.&quot; Her nipples warmed up again, and her vest grew a cleavage window as they finally grew to an appreciable size. She repeated her last wish, however, which finally allowed her to reach the size she wanted. <br />
<br />
Ty- no, she needed a new name... Taylor? Taylor would work- Taylor reached up to grab her large chest, hormones flowing. &quot;Fuck yeah,&quot; she said. &quot;I wish they were softer, but still perky enough to wear without a bra.&quot; Her hands sunk deeper into her flesh, but they stood proud on her chest when she let go. <br />
<br />
She turned her head to see her flat, boyish ass. &quot;I wish my ass was as big as my tits.&quot; Her ass gurgled- the cheeks themselves- as they ballooned out, each cheek as large as her chest. &quot;I wish my hips grew as wide as my ass,&quot; she added, jiggling one of her cheeks. She watched, amazed, as the jiggle crawled across her ass cheeks. &quot;I wish my thighs were thicc enough to rub together when I walked.&quot; <br />
<br />
Her thighs followed her demands, rippling with new fat as she clapped them together, amazed. She looked back at herself in the mirror. After wishing it to be bigger, she stood up, pouting at her chubby belly. &quot;I wish I had defined muscles,&quot; she added. Her belly shrunk directly from her hands, tightening up into abs. &quot;Fuck yeah,&quot; she repeated. <br />
<br />
She pulled a few poses in the mirror, and realised how out-of-place her boyish face looked on this bombshell of a woman. &quot;I wish that my face matched the rest of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately, her face became numb. Taylor watched in amazement as it began flowing like hot wax, her hair retreating into her head. It was the first thing to stabilize, becoming a short brown bob. Her eyes were next- emerald green gems in a sea of tanning skin. Her face finally stabilized, with thin lips, a sharp nose, and beady eyes. She clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth, pinching the bridge of her nose.<br />
<br />
It gave way, and a few more touches revealed that she was malleable. She shrunk her nose into a button, gave herself sharp, angular eyes with long, dark eyelashes and thin, light eyebrows. She plumped up her lips, and pulled her hair out, making it thick and fluffy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I was blonde,&quot; she finished, and she felt her face solidify. Her hair lightened up. &quot;I wish I had a soft, deep, relaxing, and domineering  voice-&quot; she began, before she started coughing her lungs out. When she finished her coughing fit, she tested her voice out. <br />
<br />
She got shivers from her own voice. It was quite effective. She examined herself in the mirror one final time, her clothes transforming into a plain white t-shirt and a pair of black yoga pants. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; she said to herself... &quot;I&#39;m missing something...&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor paused and thought before realising. &quot;Oh yeah... I wish I had all kinds of accessories in gold, orange, and purple.&quot;<br />
<br />
A wave appeared from her ears, where 7 loops appeared on each of her ears, going from orange at the very top, to white in the middle, to purple at the bottom. Her earlobes each gained a piercing each, a small feather dangling from each. Her face was attacked by makeup- she had huge eyeliner wings now, and her lips were now deep purple. Her hair twisted itself into a loose braid, a purple bow appearing at the tip. <br />
<br />
Her clothes changed too, becoming a black tube-top with a cropped jean vest on top. It did very nice things to her cleavage, while also revealing her rock-hard abs. Her nails grew- all except the middle and ring finger, which remained very well groomed. She rolled her eyes as orange, white and purple nail polish appeared. <br />
<br />
Her wrists became home to a very pretty watch, and a very fancy armlet made of gold and studded with stones. No points for what colour the stones were. <br />
<br />
She yipped as something cold pierced her belly button. Further examination revealed she now had a stud in her belly button. <br />
<br />
Her pants shrunk, now barely hiding her bulbous behind. Her socks grew, however, letting a thin slit of thigh pudge out between them and her shorts. <br />
<br />
Taylor popped her lips together as she adjusted her clothes. &quot;Mhmmmm... me likey~&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
She left the bathroom, her stride making her swing her hips back and forth unconsiously. She arrived at the kitchens, manned by Sarah... who was not wearing anything except an apron. Taylor blushed as she realised, striding up to feel up her ass. &quot;Hey Sarah~&quot; she said, squeezing. &quot;What&#39;s for breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M-Mistress!&quot; she squeaked, blushing. &quot;I-it is your favourite, mistress,&quot; she said, &quot;Omlette with cheddar.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor grinned, and found herself kissing Sarah on the cheek. &quot;Thanks babe!&quot; She said, giving her plump ass one last squeeze. &quot;I&#39;ll be in the dining room!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she sauntered out, wishing her phone into her hand. When she opened it, she saw that she had a notification on her social media. What surprised her was the person sending it- she recognized the account.</p>
