<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Blake winked at his little buddy as he flexed his mighty triceps, the freakish muscle popping out under the skin. &quot;Fuck I feel good, bro,&quot; Blake drawled, before dropping the pose to turn and face Sean directly. &quot;Come on, dude,&quot; Blake continued, a grin on his face, &quot;drink up! You&#39;re gonna love being a roided up beast like me and the boys!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sean stepped back. He had no idea what the hell was going on here. He stared at Blake and realized that his new friend was gone, replaced by the muscular freak he now saw. They had been assigned as roommates in the dorms and had immediately hit it off. It had been Blake&#39;s suggestion that they start working out together, and it had been his idea to hit up one of the local gyms when the school gym got too crowded. But that Blake seemed to be gone, replaced by an insane brute. Sean&#39;s willingness to go along with his buddy&#39;s suggestions had just ended. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way,&quot; Sean said, his voice trembling. &quot;I&#39;m outta here!&quot; <br />
The cup dropped from Sean&#39;s hand, spilling its precious cargo on the floor. <br />
<br />
Blake&#39;s smile dropped, becoming a scowl when he saw the waste of juice. &quot;That was a big fuckin&#39; mistake, bro,&quot; he snarled. Sean&#39;s eyes widened and he stumbled backwards, eager to escape. But Blake was on him seconds later, pulling him back toward the front desk near where the trio of roiders stood with big, stupid grins on their faces. Sean&#39;s struggles went nowhere; he was no match for Blake&#39;s insane strength. <br />
<br />
Blake pushed Sean back against the counter, holding the smaller man in place with his massive body. One hand reached up and grabbed Sean&#39;s jaw, squeezing it and forcing the mouth to open. The other hand grabbed one of the cups. &quot;Now drink up. Don&#39;t make me fuck you up even more,&quot; Blake warned as he brought it to Sean&#39;s lips and then tipped the contents in. Sean sputtered in protest, trying not to swallow, but Blake was unyielding, holding Sean&#39;s mouth open and waiting patiently for the liquid to go down. After half a minute he took another cup and held it up where Sean could see. &quot;You keep holding out, I&#39;m going to make you drink even more,&quot; Blake growled in warning. <br />
<br />
Eyes wide, Sean kept fighting, unwilling to give in yet. Blake poured the second cup into Sean&#39;s mouth, as the latter freshman panicked inside. Blake held up two, then three fingers. &quot;You asking for number three, bro?&quot; He started to reach over toward the tray. <br />
<br />
Realizing that he was in an impossible situation, Sean swallowed. Blake grinned broadly as he saw it, and pushed himself away from his smaller roommate. Sean staggered away from the counter, rubbing his aching jaw. &quot;Fuck you,&quot; he growled crossly, staring daggers at Blake and the others. <br />
<br />
But already Sean was changing. His hair was receding and his jaw was growing, stubble spreading across it. He took a deep breath, his mind suddenly slammed with a strange new sensation. As he breathed in his chest expanded, his pecs growing larger and larger, swelling with muscle, becoming positively bloated. They stretched out under his white shirt, two growing mounds of muscle, striations cutting across them. <br />
<br />
His traps grew at the same time, pushing up and out on either side of his thickening neck, reaching around to cap his increasingly massive back, which swelled with brutal power. His arms and shoulders swelled dramatically, muscle expanding under the skin, shredding his shirt sleeves in seconds, the fabric tearing audibly, then disappearing as his shirt slowly changed shape as it turned into a white tank top that hugged his giant pecs and showed off his huge arms and shoulders and lats. A few veins appeared here and there. He wasn&#39;t as lean as Blake, but he was so muscular that the larger veins and striations were still visible. <br />
<br />
Sean staggered to the side, dizzy, his mind buzzing with what was happening to him. He tried to cry out, but no sound came from his voice. Instead, his soft belly hardened, swelling into a cobblestone street running down a rounded roidgut. The growth reached down into his glutes, which expanded dramatically, making his loose shorts suddenly tight. His thighs were next, the quadriceps and hamstrings bloating with size and power, forcing the fabric of his shorts to rise up and tear in several places. Just as it looked like they were going to give way entirely they changed into a pair of spandex shorts, cut high to give the thighs maximum movement. Further down, Sean&#39;s calves grew until they were huge and hard, while his balls shrunk down dramatically, no longer needed for testosterone production. Only Sean&#39;s dick remained the same. It hardened to seven inches in his shorts as artificial testosterone surged through him, making him horny and aggressive. <br />
<br />
Blake and the three other roidheads looked on approvingly. The double-dose had worked wonders on Sean&#39;s pudgy college boy body, turning it into a wondrous example of offseason superheavyweight mass. Although still shorter than Blake, Sean was considerably wider and his muscles were clearly much larger. Although his normal-sized dick looked small between his huge legs, it was considerably bigger than any of the other roidheads around him. Sean took a deep breath, his massive chest expanding under his tank top. The words &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m on roids SO WHAT&quot; appeared in blocky black letters on the front of the white tank top, stretched out by Sean&#39;s abs, while the Roid Bros logo appeared on the back. Sean&#39;s dizziness finally subsided, and he looked up at Blake and his new bros.</p>
