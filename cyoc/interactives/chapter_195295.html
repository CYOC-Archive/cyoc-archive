<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the very next day at the gym that made Neil realize things really were changing quite a lot. And it wasn&#39;t just him, either. He and Max met up early in the morning at the apartment - Max wanted all the details about Neil&#39;s hot date with Sandra...which he was happy to provide. It didn&#39;t seem like anything that should be private, especially with how he and Max were. Though it seemed Max was very interested in the details of the threesome it became, to a degree that left Neil wondering. He had known that something was going on with his own sexuality.<br />
<br />
But he had discounted the idea going into this that it might have been affecting other peoples&#39; sexuality. He just thought going by how naturally Bradley seemed to go into detail about his experiences that he had just...always been kinda bisexual. But no. It seemed that as Neil and Max went into the gym that day that other people were changing - and Neil realized that, when he had looked at Matt, he should&#39;ve realized that sooner. He should&#39;ve been thinking as he went to bed that night about why Matt might suddenly be willing to do...<br />
<br />
To do all that. To him. Sexually. And he just...hadn&#39;t. Matt had been his school antagonist for the longest time, and Neil had admittedly grown bitter about it. So when the time came and the chance arose to put Matt &quot;in his place&quot;, Neil had jumped the gun and taken the chance, not even thinking as he did about the implications. He had just been too turned on, and feeling at his best from finally having sex with the hottest woman at the gym.<br />
<br />
Today had been an interesting day even so far. Neil had come to the gym dressed in a way that even a week ago he never would&#39;ve considered. He wore a pair of tiny black short shorts that showed off the rippling musculature in his legs and nicely showcased his ass, and a yellow and white very thin material stringer shirt that more or less exposed the majority of Neil&#39;s chest and abdomen. His nipples unable to even be concealed by the tiny strings extending over his shoulders.<br />
<br />
But as Neil walked into the gym that day he saw a distinctly different panorama from what he had ever seen before. The ambiguity and the curiosity of the prior day had moved forward into open displays of affection and desire. He swore he could see Lucas Peyton and Brock Medina touching each other in a strikingly flirty way between sets, and looking very, very different besides.<br />
<br />
Lucas looked almost like he was half African American on one side of the family, a more light caramel tint to his tan, though he retained his original blue eyes. His body had if anything further broadened up, and started approaching the size and scale of a classic physique bodybuilder. Looking more and more like the black bodybuilder that Lucas had originally viewed as his aspirational point...<br />
<br />
And Brock Medina. It was clear that Brock was trying his hardest to conceal the signs he was getting on in age. He was massive, bulky but very well toned, but there was a weathered and lived in element to his strong physique. His face seemed moisturized, and an effort had been made to conceal wrinkles. He wore his hair differently, likely to conceal a declining hairline. But it was clear that even with all this going on that, as roided up as he ever was, Brock was fucking impressive.<br />
<br />
Neil shook his head, and found himself considering...well, himself.<br />
<br />
He was easily the size Bradley Channing had been yesterday, a muscular paragon of masculinity. Max was gonna get there soon, but Neil was more concerned with the mental effects. As he and Max set in and started looking for a place to start their chest, arms and shoulders day, Neil found himself kind of enjoying the fact the gym was so open now to these sorts of affection. He wondered if he was due to grow any more today, and if anyone from here was going to notice.<br />
<br />
Be they male or female.<br />
<br />
Max certainly noticed, though he wasn&#39;t exactly far enough along for his sexuality to change completely - though he did seem to have a certain element of curiosity. The formerly chubby lifter had ended up more of a stocky, powerfully built muscular man. Eager to show off his new gains and find the same degree of romantic fulfillment that Neil had only just discovered. He too dressed in a stringer and shorts, though he didn&#39;t wear quite so showy shorts, and his stringer was black instead. &quot;Dude,&quot; Max said with a grin, &quot;You are one of the biggest guys in here. I swear, everybody at college thinks you&#39;re on DBol.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dianabol?&quot; Neil chuckled, &quot;Not my scene. But I get why they&#39;d think that.&quot; Neil then hoisted a pair of 65 lbs weights to start some dumbbell bench press on one of the benches. Fuck, getting ripped even affected his face - decreased his dorky look and made him look broad, strong-featured, and sexy. If nerdy Neil had seen this rippling bodybuilder, pounding out 10 rep sets at this weight, he&#39;d be afraid of getting bullied.<br />
<br />
Neil grunted and groaned through his set, and he swore as he got up he could see even more tone pushing through on his powerful chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh yeah...&quot; Both he and Max flexed before he handed the weights off to Max. He stood by to spot, knowing Max would probably make it to eight reps today - and need some help with the last two. He was pleasantly surprised by Max getting to nine reps instead, before he needed to step in and spot him for that last rep.<br />
<br />
We&#39;re really, Neil thought, getting to be so incredibly different. He didn&#39;t know what was inciting these changes, but he knew this probably wasn&#39;t the end of it. He wondered what more it could do. He looked at a grinning Max, eagerly preening away at the mirror. As tempting as it was to make some kind of sexual move on his buddy, he didn&#39;t want to. Neil shook his head - but fuck it was tempting to do so.<br />
<br />
As they moved into the next sets, Neil found himself considering Matt.<br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t seen Matt today at the gym with his buddies. It seemed Caleb had discovered something was awry and stopped showing up here. Spooked, probably, by what was going on. Maybe he needed to talk to Caleb about this all. Maybe Matt just came in early. Hopefully things didn&#39;t progress any further in that case. He didn&#39;t like how he&#39;d acted. It was entirely too much. Just...way too much. Taking that kind of sexualized vengeance on Matt had been...hot. Sexually inciting. It even made Neil feel a little aroused now - but he knew it was also not exactly the right way to handle it.<br />
<br />
The contact should&#39;ve been more even. Treating Matt like the cuckold in some pornographic video was...well. The term &quot;two wrongs don&#39;t make a right&quot; came to mind. There was a reason that was just porn. It didn&#39;t reflect reality - or at least, it shouldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
By the time Neil and Max finished up their sets on both incline and decline, as well as regular dumbbell bench press, Max indicated he wanted to try and go tone up some on the treadmill. Neil personally didn&#39;t care for the treadmill for his cardio. It was boring - and he preferred stairmaster. More burned calories that way. But for whatever reason, Max liked it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dude,&quot; Max said, &quot;I&#39;m gonna hit the cardio right now between this and our arm sets. You good over here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Neil said, &quot;I&#39;m...yeah. Yeah.&quot; Neil looked over at where Brock and Lucas were working out. He knew he needed to get some answers. Or at least TRY and find something out with those two. He trusted his self control, even as he admitted he found both tremendously hot as they were now. &quot;I&#39;m gonna just be over here, uh, doing my own workout for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Max said with a slight knowing chuckle. Admittedly, letting Max know he had been in a bisexual threesome probably affected the guy&#39;s view of how Neil was gonna do certain things.<br />
<br />
So now, as Max walked off, Neil finding himself watching Max&#39;s back as it seemed to broaden at least a little further right there in front of him, Neil had some decisions to make. He needed to talk to people who had been at the gym just as long as he had. Who had changed in such drastic ways. He couldn&#39;t exactly approach Matt if he did show up without the whole thing being incredibly awkward. And he didn&#39;t know what further effect the gym might be having on Matt regardless.<br />
<br />
So he had to go talk to one of Matt&#39;s former goons.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, he was feeling a lot less trepidation over this now. Not only was Neil no longer the nerdy victim that he had once been, but the two of them seemed less...standoffish. There were definitely shifts at least in how they carried themselves. Neil wasn&#39;t sure how much in total their personalities had changed. But he was sure at least he could approach without being immediately picked on. And that left him feeling pretty brave.<br />
<br />
So here he went...</p>
