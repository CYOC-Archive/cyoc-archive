<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Beryl grabbed her clothes from her locker, and ran out of the locker room.  She knew Coach Miller and the other girls would probably follow her into the locker room, demanding answers.  She ran down the hallway, looking for a room where she could hide and change clothes.  She spotted a small storage room, and jumped inside.<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to her, her hiding spot did not go unnoticed.  Jennifer had seen the strange occurrence during tryouts, and had covertly followed her to the storage room.<br />
<br />
So, she doesn&#39;t like being big, thought Jennifer.  Well, I think I know just the person she needs to meet.  She smiled wickedly at the thought of her new evil plan for revenge.<br />
<br />
Beryl removed the tattered remains of Sarah&#39;s leotard.  It was in a pieces, and tightly adhered to her body, so she merely ripped it off of her body.  She put on Kyle&#39;s clothes.  The baggy shirt was now snug, and the waistband of her mother&#39;s sweatpants pinched her wide waist sharply.  The shoes were too small, and Beryl realized that she would need to walk home barefoot.  She was about to leave, when the door opened, and two figures entered, blocking her exit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hello, Beryl.  How are you feeling today?  Maybe a little sick like you&#39;re brother?&quot; said Jennifer mockingly.  &quot;That&#39;s too bad.  You put on quite a show at the tryouts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beryl was tired, and just wanted to go home.  But the storage room was narrow, and the only way out was past Jennifer.  She didn&#39;t want to touch her as she left and grow even taller.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, Jennifer.  I&#39;m sorry.  I&#39;m tired and I want to go home.  I don&#39;t want to fight, &quot; said Beryl.<br />
<br />
Jennifer smiled.  &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t want to fight either.  Especially after our little spat in the locker room.  That was just so embarrassing.  Almost as embarrassing as your little performance in the gym.  No, I have other plans.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beryl was getting worried.  Jennifer had something planned, and she knew from Kyle&#39;s experience that it was probably going to be pretty bad.  &quot;Please, Jennifer, just let me go.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jennifer clicked her tongue.  &quot;Tsk, tsk.  I&#39;m not going to hurt you.  Just like your brother, you think I am some kind of evil monster.  What was it you called me - a bitch?  No, I&#39;m just trying to be nice.  I just wanted to introduce you to someone -  a little friend of mine, who just wants to shake hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer stepped aside, and Beryl finally saw who had accompanied her into the storage room.  Her heart raced, and she began to sweat as she felt true terror.  It was Tina.<br />
<br />
Or Too Tall Tina, as she was called.  Poor Tina was 6 and a half feet of gangly mess.  She had grown tall quickly and early in life.  Being so tall, she had developed a hunched appearance, as she frequently bent down to try to make herself look smaller.  It was no secret that Tina wanted to be smaller.  Her whole life she had been teased and abused.  And Beryl had little doubt what Tina wanted with her.<br />
<br />
She looked sheepishly at Jennifer.  &quot;Are you sure about this?&quot; asked Tina nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, you oaf, &quot; said Jennifer impatiently.  &quot;If you want to get smaller, just touch her skin.  I think 5 pokes should bring you down to a normal size.  Don&#39;t you want to be smaller, be normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Beryl could see the desperation in Tina&#39;s eyes, as she reached forward to touch her.  It was the same desperation she had seen in her own when she first wanted to be taller.  She tried to maneuver out of the way, but the room was just too small and narrow.  She felt Tina touch her 5 times.<br />
<br />
This time she really felt the growth.  It was almost painful, as she felt her bones stretch and pull.  She felt her feet dragging on the floor as they lengthened, and fell on the ground.  She saw the legs of her sweat pants ride up over her ankles, and her arms stretch out of the sleeves of her shirt.  <br />
<br />
She looked up, and saw Tina ecstatic with joy.  Her posture was now better, and she no longer appeared hunched.  Her clothes hung loosely on her frame.<br />
<br />
She was about to stand up, to assess the damage, when Tina suddenly sprang on her.  She felt her poking her again - six times by her count.  Once again, she felt the familiar sensations of growth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what the hell are you doing? &quot; said Jennifer angrily.  &quot;This isn&#39;t what we agreed on.  This isn&#39;t the way it was supposed to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina just ignored her, and continued to watch her shrinking body with glee.  &quot;Sorry, but I want to be normal.  And I was still just too tall. &quot; <br />
<br />
Beryl groaned on the floor.  The growth was more painful this time, and everything felt sore.  She stretched her arms and was surprised to see how far her arms reached in the tight shirt.  Her elbows were well past the shirt cuff now.  The previously baggy shirt now looked like a half shirt, revealing a tight midriff. She looked down to her pants, and saw that the cuffs of her sweatpants were above her knees.  She tried to stand, unsteady on her new gangly limbs, bracing herself against the wall as she stood.<br />
<br />
Tina watched Beryl rise to her new height, and quickly pushed past Jennifer out the door.  &quot;Thanks for you help, Jen, but this is your deal and I am out of here. She&#39;s your problem, not mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer stared at Beryl, now towering over her at 7 feet tall.  Beryl looked down at her with malice and rage.  Jennifer slowly began to back towards the door, fearful of Beryl&#39;s anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, sorry, Beryl, this isn&#39;t what I intended.  I just wanted to get back at you a little, but nothing like this, &quot; she sputtered, as she made her way to the door.  Beryl looked at the ground, smiling with an evil grin.  Jennifer opened the door, and thought she had made it to safety, when Beryl finally spoke the fateful words, &quot;Jennifer, Transform or Dare?&quot;</p>
