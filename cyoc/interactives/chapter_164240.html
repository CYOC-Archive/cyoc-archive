<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This was probably one of the weirder stores Tucker had ever seen in his twenty-two years of life. He had almost walked right by the new store front on his way home from work, but something about the sign had caught it eye. NuYu, nothing to explain what it was until you got closer. The advertisement in the window had been quite the read though.<br />
<br />
&quot;NuYu&#39;s line of men&#39;s products guarantee the New You you&#39;ve always wanted. Who hasn&#39;t ever wanted to change something about themselves or even try on a whole new look. With NuYu, nothing is impossible.&quot; All printed below the image of a muscular model in Speedos.<br />
<br />
The inside of the store was broken up into areas, everything from grooming, to supplements, and even some food and clothing items. There were even some sex toys in a back corner of the shop that couldn&#39;t be seen from the window. And Tucker couldn&#39;t believe some of the claims on these items, a soap that would make your B.O. smell like pine trees, a razor that would shave off hair and it would never grow back, a protein powder that promised forty pounds of muscle in just one week (results may vary).<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything I can help you with, sir?&quot; Tucker was not used to being called sir. He was short, skinny, and even at twenty-two and being a college grad he could walk into a high school and pass for a student. He looked like a teen at best. The mop of blond hair that never cooperated, and big blue eyes didn&#39;t help. Well, unless he was cruising a gay bar, he was about as twinky as you could get and be legal.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m just looking around.&quot; He turned to look at the clerk, a handsome man in his mid twenties, immaculately groomed to look like he rolled out of bed, but his neatly trimmed stubble gave it away, lean and athletic, with a bright smile. &quot;Does this stuff really work?&quot;<br />
<br />
The clerk nodded. &quot;Money back guaranteed.&quot; He tapped his chin as he looked Tucker over. Tucker felt himself blushing at the guy&#39;s attention and quickly put the bar of soap back on the shelf like he was a kid caught with his hand in a cookie jar. &quot;We&#39;re running a grand opening special. You can pick any item in the store with a value of less than thirty dollars and take it home free. We think you&#39;ll be so impressed you&#39;ll be back.&quot; The man broke into a salesman smile. &quot;So, tell me, what do you most want to change?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tucker just shook his head. &quot;I don&#39;t know..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you do. Everyone knows what they want to change about themselves. No secrets here, I&#39;ve heard it all, trust me. From bigger dick, to smaller nose.&quot; He waited expectantly.<br />
<br />
Tucker finally found himself wanted to speak. &quot;Well, I&#39;ve always wanted to be more.. adult looking..&quot; He rubbed his jaw as he thought about exactly that, and something that would really put this place to the test. &quot;What about something that grows hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since you have a full head of blond hair or else the best hairpiece I&#39;ve ever seen, I guess you mean facial or body hair.&quot; The clerk started moving off down one of the aisles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Super hairy, or just a little more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something gradual then you can stop... aha!&quot; The clerk reached over onto one of the shelves and handed Tucker what looked like a shaving razor, like all the ones you buy in the store it only had one head, with others in a package next to it. Those were out of the thirty dollar range, but the single head and handle weren&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Razors get rid of hair.&quot; Tucker said, looking over the package. &quot;GorillaRazor.. more hair in less time..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t you heard the saying, when you shave it off it grows back in thicker. Well, this makes that true. Any time you want a little more hair anywhere, shave with this and in a few hours you&#39;ll have a thicker patch growing in. Good for tiny adjustments or when you&#39;re not sure how much you want.&quot; The clerk leaned on the shelf as he watched Tucker check out the item. &quot;One razor is good for about ten shaves. Depending on how much you want.. it might take a few refills, but we have other stuff if you want a much faster result. Little pricier for the product but cheaper in the long run.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What have I got to loose?&quot; Tucker said as he turned the package over in his hands once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much, if you over do it we have the Baby Smooth Razor that will let you get rid of your hair and start from scratch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I don&#39;t have hair there?&quot; Tucker asked, looking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shave the spot and you will. Oh and, best results happen if you shave before going to sleep. Enjoy!&quot; The clerk smiled. &quot;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll see you in a few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tucker returned to his apartment with his prize, setting it on the table as he got dinner in the oven, just heating up a frozen pizza. Though his eyes kept going back to the package. &quot;Best results from overnight, but he said it would work in a few hours... so maybe a test..&quot; He took the razor into the bathroom and got it out of its package, browsing the little instruction pamphlet inside. Though it pretty much said it worked how the clerk said it would.<br />
<br />
He looked himself over. Something to test, but out of sight in case the thing messed up, or just ended up giving him a rash. He had just the idea, he took off his shirt and set it aside. Lifting his arms he looked at his pits. Small wisps of blond hair were there, barely noticeable. Perfect. He lathered up with some shaving cream under his arms and with a few swipes at each pit it was soon smooth as could be. He pulled his shirt back on and went to enjoy a little after work pizza and TV.<br />
<br />
By the time it was late enough to go to bed, Tucker had almost completely forgotten about the razor. He went into the bathroom to take his evening shower and wipe away the day&#39;s grime, taking off his clothes and tossing them in the hamper. It was as he stretched out his arm to turn on the shower he noticed it in the vanity mirror. There was a darker patch under his arms. Stunned, he lifted both arms up. It wasn&#39;t a lot more, but it went from a few wispy pale blond hairs to a patch of darker blond hair, thick enough you could see it under his arms without having to really look. He reached up and gave the hairs a little tug. Ouch.. okay.. bad idea. But they were his.<br />
<br />
He picked up the razor and looked at it, then the shower..</p>
