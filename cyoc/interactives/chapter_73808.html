<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott Rolfe was a genius. He had a scholarship by his own merits and was studying to become one of the most <br />
renown biologist in the world. The guy was good looking, albeit a bit geeky perhaps. He didn't train out his <br />
body, but kept a healthy diet and overall good shape. He was around the area gathering samples. He was <br />
accompanied by his sibling, the unremarkable Keith Rolfe, a year older and going to community college. He <br />
accompanied his brother on petition of their parents, but years of being crushed under his young brother <br />
shadow took its toll on the brothers' relationship.<br />
<br />
While Scott gathered samples, he went to the fair, were he saw the trials of Timothy Porter and Shawn Mayer. <br />
Thinking it the perfect chance to finally get back at his brother, went looking for him. Before seeing the <br />
cautionary tale that was Mr. O'Toole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three persons with to much and to high opinion of themselves. Has come and gone, and many people here has <br />
taken what they didn't needed. Now another one has been drawn to our little show of amendments.&quot; said Madame <br />
as Keith dragged Scott into the tent. <br />
<br />
&quot;Keith, I don't have time for this superflous nonsense.&quot; admonished Scott.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be fun, beside you need a break. Hey Madame, here's a volunteer!&quot; shouted Keith before shoving Scott <br />
forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do no such thing!&quot; said Scott with severity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scott Rolfe. You believe you have all the answers, and trust your wits over everything else. But life is not <br />
that way. You should listen to your brother and enjoy life. However you're far to smart for your own good.&quot; <br />
said Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll hardly think so.&quot; said Scott antagonizing with the old woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Therw you see, you THINK. Let's take care of that. How much is your IQ?&quot; asked Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is obviously a set up of my brother. So I'll play along for now. 160.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How smart, rationalizing even my influence. Very well. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you Scott Rolfe a genius <br />
who lives only and for his brains. But he is unhappy because he is to smart to live a simple life. Since his <br />
points are way to valuable, they'll be not sell by money, but for gifts to enjoy his new life.&quot; said Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don't want a new life.&quot; responded Scott.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad. Let's start by selling 5 points.&quot; stated Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't sell my intelligence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey aren't you going to strip him first!&quot; shouted Keith, thinking he would cause an uproar, but the audience <br />
was wary now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... So you have some ideas.&quot; said Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keith!&quot; barked Scott at his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;$100 for all his clothes, and make him ugly for another $100.&quot; yelled Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to be part of the act so much, become part of show. Ladies and Gentlemen, for the first time a 2 <br />
for 1 offer, Keith here will gladly double you whatever you buy from his brother cost free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?! FUCK THAT!&quot; shoted Keith for this turnabout. But soon himself dragged into the stage by two of Madame <br />
goons. who proceeded to search him for his wallet extracting only a hundredth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! That's mine!&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;No it's not, you offered $100 for a strip show, and that's what you get. Later.&quot; said the assistant. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you! And Fuck the Old hag too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just for that not only will you suffer your brothers change, but you'll also pay the price. For now let's <br />
start the bidding, what do you give for 10 points of IQ.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give?&quot; asked a person in the public. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, we have already said you can't get something from nothing.&quot; said Madame glaring.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll pay for 10 points each, and some knowledge too.&quot; said a young man. In fact one of the three who <br />
purchased the years from the jock. &quot;We made ourselves older but with no education. We want it so we can get a <br />
better job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very laudable, but what would you give him. Your asking for double and then some.&quot; asked Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just had it with you people.&quot; steamed Scott his patience consumed. &quot;All this nonsense of stealing <br />
intelligence and youth is no longer amusing, let my brother go. I had enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know!&quot; said other of the young men. &quot;If he wants to enjoy life. We each will give him an inch of cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; yelled the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on! We are pretty well endowed an inch less is nothing. Beside think on the trade.&quot; explained the <br />
second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine&quot;said one. &quot;All right...&quot; said the other. &quot;What fuck no!&quot; said Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not enough.&quot; said Madame. &quot;If you want what you ask, Two is the minimum.&quot;<br />
<br />
This startled the three young men. Each gave each other a look, until finally one said. &quot;We agree.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;And then some... I'm sure the audience will want to SEE the transaction.&quot; said Madame.<br />
<br />
The trio looked defeated. And without warning three set of pants came down. And lie they didn't one had an 8 <br />
incher, while the other two where around 7 and half.<br />
<br />
&quot;What vulgar disp- hey!&quot; but before he could finish Scott's own trousers were pulled down. As well as Keith's.<br />
<br />
They wanted to inmmideately pull them up, but somehow felt compelled to show their cocks to the people there. <br />
And unlike the other three Scott was four inches long, and Keith's was six.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... At least even two inches less I'll be bigger than you?&quot; said Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two?&quot; said Madame sarcastically. &quot;He's obviously the genius, because your math is lousy. The deal is <br />
accepted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott was blushing red, from all this people seeing his tiny cock, but then he felt lightheaded as his years <br />
of formation left his noggin. Keith also felt lightheaded, but in areas were Scott could spare 30 points he <br />
was struggling to form coherent thoughs. <br />
<br />
As their heads filled with knowledge and the ability to understand and apply them their cocks regressed into <br />
their bodied. At 6 and 5.5 inches, theirs were average at worse. And while they were shrinking Scott dick <br />
began to enlarge and grow until it was an impresive 9 incher. Meanwhile Keith saw with horror how his cock <br />
shrunk from five, to three to a mere nub... To nothing. Effectively a pee hole were a penis should be.<br />
<br />
The less endowed but with the mental capability of a regular college freshman young men quickly did their <br />
pants and left the stage.<br />
<br />
But before going one of them turn around and suggested, &quot;Madame, if I may. Why don't you mention an attribute <br />
for the better life of our fellow here and simply pay the people the appropiate amount of points?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a great idea. Listen people, I'll mention some attributes and you'll raise your hand and then we'll <br />
make the appropiate transaction.&quot; said Madame,<br />
<br />
&quot;If I may also contribute, Madame.&quot; said a woman. &quot;This young man is too shy for him to be happy like that&quot; <br />
said as Scott and Keith were trying to cover themselves. &quot;and I have a daugther who is way to bold, she like <br />
to run around naked. That's not proper of a lady. How much for my daughter boldness?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh... Fair point. A good trait 5 points,&quot; said Madame, Scott felt light headed again as he was trying to <br />
remember why he was trying to cover in the first place. Meanwhile Keith was blushing red, all his boldness <br />
stripped away, now having trouble processing what was happening.<br />
<br />
A man said. &quot;His dick is well an all, but his body doesn't match, he doesn't look strong or manly enough to <br />
pull it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; looked puzzled Scott and Keith. <br />
<br />
&quot;Another perfect point. And as they said handing out Brains over Brawn. The men who want a point raise your <br />
hand, and I'll take the equivalent of a point, the women raise your hands to give out your man-like traits. <br />
But first the young man here was promise a strip show. So off with their clothing. Given away complimentary to <br />
the first bidders.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hand's began raising, as Madame assistants tore up the brothers clothes trowing them to the crowd.<br />
<br />
The empty headed feeling was increased, with each raised hand, but it also was Scott body. Each point lost <br />
gave him more muscle, height and a manlier physique. But since it was drawn for women, the masculine traits <br />
were more handsome and princely than bearish and thugh. <br />
<br />
But as his intelligence dropped Keith suffered the opposite effects. He lose muscle mass, become a puny man, <br />
for the time being, since his man facets were melting away, his hips narroed, and his chest began to inflate <br />
into two mounds, and his nonexistant cock was easily turned into a vulva. His brother became so manly, than <br />
the only option was for him to become her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you have it folks. After loosing 60 points we have a dull minded nudist with a giant cock, on the other <br />
hand a bashful petit woman.&quot; said Madame. &quot;What do we do with Scott, who will not be a scholar anymore, and <br />
Keith, rather Kath, to dumb to take care of herself. She can't even dress herself.&quot; mocked Madame to the red <br />
woman crouching on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take them both.&quot; said a fat man in a cheap suit. &quot;I own a pair of certain entertainment stablishment and <br />
I'll hire both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pray tell the audience what.&quot; asked Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well far from me to make shameless advertisement. But Club Mars is proud to announce his BIGGEST star, Scott <br />
here. And Venus Villa Club newest 'waitress'. What do you say Scott, would you like to dance naked and fuck <br />
any girl that come your way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehehe... Girls...&quot; said Scott simply thinking all the sex he would have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good bring your... Sister. Maybe Madame could give them some covering at least a blanket or something, price <br />
is no problem.&quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
Madame produced to bedsheets that the couple used to drape themselves. Then being lead by hand outside the <br />
tent.</p>
