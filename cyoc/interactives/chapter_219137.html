<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ten, nine, eight, seven six,…”<br />
<br />
Richard moans as he drives deep once more pushing himself over the edge as he begins to spasm with pleasure. His hot cum fills Floyds ass, joining the four other loads that have been deposited into the unfortunate guinea pig of Richards experiments. <br />
<br />
Richard dismounts and hurriedly shuffled away a couple of yards as Nancy shouted for the next person to take his place. Once the next punisher was working away Nancy came over and hoisted Richards pants back up into their place. <br />
<br />
She leaned in and whispered into his ear. “Once I’m done here, come see me in my office.”<br />
<br />
Richard stood there for a second looking dumbstruck before he realized that with the new office culture, he was expected to get back to work after his participation in the punishment activity had been satisfied. Richard made his way back to his cubical and found it mostly unchanged except for a headset that he hadn’t left out on top of his keyboard. <br />
<br />
He looked at his taped-up hands and realized that there was no way that he would be able to type as he normally would. But by using the headset he could at least dictate. Thankfully it was an easy task to orient the headset on his head correctly and he soon found himself slipping into the rhythm of work. <br />
<br />
An hour later and obviously sore and thoroughly abused Floyd made his way down to his cubical. Richard couldn’t help but notice that the man was now naked, and sported a shiny metal chastity cage that looked to be two sizes too small around his cock. Richard was sure that Floyd did not complain or even make an assertion that his cock was too big for the device after the pounding his ass had taken. <br />
<br />
Richard turned back to his work then remembered that Wendy had asked to meet with him after she was done, so he removed his headset and gingerly locked his computer before setting off for the CPO’s office. An office which he did not know existed or where it might be located but somehow his body carried him through the workspace until he arrived at a door and knocked.<br />
<br />
“Come on in,” Wendy said and Richard filed in. The office itself had a split personality to it. Half of the room, the half that Richard had walked into was arranged the way a normal office would be, centered around a desk to which Wendy sat on the other side of. The other half looked like a black leather BDSM dungeon complete with several racks of various implements. <br />
<br />
“Well, come on, have a seat, you don’t want to make this take longer than it needs to, don’t you?” Wendy said with a smirk. Richard, a bit confused by all of this, sat down in one of the chairs opposite of Wendy. <br />
<br />
“Right, lets get to it,” Wendy said. She spun around in her chair and opened up a filing cabinet drawer and pulled a folder and Richard’s phone out of it. “Here we are, Mr. Timewaster. Your work phone that we caught you playing around on when you should have been working.” Wendy opened the folder and pulled out several forms. “I need you to sign and date these forms after you’ve read, understood, and agree with everything written on them, then we can move on with our day.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, okay,” Richard said sheepishly. His eyes were focused on his phone. He hoped that the app still existed on it in this new reality. He picked up a pen between his two bound hands and began to read through the splayed-out paperwork, initialling and dating to the best of his hindered ability. <br />
<br />
“Hmm, what’s this,” Wendy said. Richard looked up and saw that Wendy was on his phone actively looking through its contents.<br />
<br />
“Select a target and the app will return a sentence describing the target,” Wendy read out loud. <br />
<br />
Richard’s stomach dropped. It was the tutorial that had popped up when he had first opened the app, and now Wendy was using the app. Richard wanted to get up and say something, anything, but for some reason he couldn’t. Unbeknownst to him it was the active punishment from the CPO that held him in place in this reality.<br />
<br />
“You may edit one word in the sentence. Reality will shift to reflect the changes. You control whether you, your target, or the world at large is aware of the changes,” Wendy said. “Well, look at this nonsense. And you thought you would download an unapproved app onto your work phone? I really should add more to your punishment.”<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Wendy clicked ‘okay’ on the app and the phone lit up with a map of the current area. On it she saw herself and Richard clearly labelled on the screen to her surprise.  She clicked on Richard and a sentence generated itself into existence on the screen.<br />
<br />
‘Richard is scared as he tries to complete his paperwork.’<br />
<br />
It took Wendy a moment but she figured she might as well try the app out while she waited. <br />
<br />
‘Richard is horny as he tries to complete his paperwork.’<br />
<br />
Wendy glanced from her phone and saw that a tent had formed in Richard’s pants, noticing that he was fidgeting around a little more than before. That wasn’t an uncommon thing for men in her office, so she generated a new sentence.<br />
<br />
‘Richard’s cock is pitching a tent in his pants.’<br />
<br />
This took Wendy by surprise; it seemed that the app was actually aware of what was happening around it. Wendy smirked as she made a change.<br />
<br />
‘Richard’s horse-cock is pitching a tent in his pants’<br />
<br />
Wendy looked over and sure enough the average size bulge in Richard’s pants was now comically sized as his newly fashioned dick struggled to get erect within his pants pushing them to their breaking point. The best part about all of this was that Richard looked none the wiser about any of these changes as he still struggled to fill out his paperwork. Wendy selected herself this time.<br />
<br />
‘Wendy is looking at Richard’s horse-cock.’<br />
<br />
A strange thought passed through Wendy’s mind at that moment. She didn’t have time to think things through as she pushed forward a change.<br />
<br />
&#39;Wendy owns Richard’s horse-cock.&#39;<br />
<br />
And with that Wendy knew deep down that she truly owned the cock within Richard’s pants, even if it wasn’t attached to her. Not only did she own the cock, but since her possession was attached to a person, she also owned the person while using her property.  The thought of having a warm living cock toy to play with was too much to pass up. She got up from her office chair and made her way around the desk. She grabbed a hold of the straining fabric and pulled Richard onto the ground without much protest. <br />
<br />
“If you wanted your cock, all you needed to do was ask,” Richard said. “It’s been getting a bit unwieldly today. It’s been a while since you fucked it.”<br />
<br />
Wendy said nothing as she unzipped the crotch of her black leather standard issue punishment suit. She pulled her cockholder’s pants off and snapped the underwear at the band letting her favorite toy spring forth. Not a moment was wasted as she mounted her horse cock and got to work fucking herself. It was huge and stretched her to her limit, but it was somehow a familiar and pleasurable feeling for her as she quickened her pace. It didn’t take long before she came squirting from her pussy all over her beautiful horse cock. She unmounted, leaving the poor throbbing member on the edge.<br />
<br />
“No! No please! You can’t leave me like this,” Richard said, trying to coax out an orgasm from the painfully erect cock.<br />
<br />
“Stop touching it. Stay right there and keep it up for me. I like the view,” Wendy said. <br />
<br />
“Uhg, fine, you got it boss,” Richard said. <br />
<br />
Wendy sat back down in her chair and pulled up the app once more, now fully convinced that it could do anything and everything. Wendy looked at the other half of the room, seeing the BDSM dungeon. It was all fine and good, but that was her job, enforcing punishment for violations to the offices code of conduct. She could haul anyone in here and do any of the certified punishment SOPs with them, but something else was burning away in her mind.  There were so many other fetishes and kinks that had haunted Wendy late into the evening that she could now experience thanks to the app. <br />
<br />
With that her mind turned to her favourite kink/fetish …</p>
