<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This was not the way I expected to spend my spring break. My big plans were to make a new astronomy website with all the cool photos coming out compared to the old ones, but I couldn’t quite get the size where I wanted it to be for hosting. <br />
<br />
After that, there were a few series online I’d been meaning to watch and then my Steam back catalog. <br />
<br />
“Barry?” Duncan Rogers, my roommate, came knocking at my door with an optional quest proposal: Join him and a party he was putting together to visit a supposed magical, mysterious lake up near the state line. I could’ve said no, I was getting better at the idea. But I found myself intrigued.<br />
<br />
Joel Griffin would be coming along though. In freshman year, I thought he was a total meathead without enough of an intelligence bulb to read by. And he had it out for me. But I noticed when he put an embarrassing thing on my phone and some of the girls in our class actually kinda looked at me. He probably didn’t intend that, but it wasn’t the worst thing. <br />
<br />
His jokes weren’t really that funny, but he knew when to quit. My dad always told me to trust first but Joel pushed that to its limit. Sometimes, I humored him. A big guy like that I was useful when we needed to move stuff around the dorm. <br />
<br />
Along with Joel, he told me that Joel‘s girlfriend Jess Butler would be coming too. And then he had thoughts about asking this one girl I figured he had a crush on, Alyssa Eckhart. She had this sort of subdued, almost goth mood about her and didn’t say much in classes. She looked kinda like Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice crossed with Shelley Duvall in The Shining. Too intimidating for me, but more power to Duncan.<br />
<br />
Out of everything, it was his mention of Fiona Eggers that got me to go. She was like sunshine beaming out of a person. Instead of eyeliner to make her eyes look like she was a decomposing corpse, hers were a playful accent to punctuate her smiles. She had streaked golden locks in feathered tiers like a starlet of yesteryear. Her lips were plumply pink like something out of my dreams. Even if we only went to a shopping mall on the other side of the state, I would’ve gone with her.<br />
<br />
Since I had a history of being the best driver on campus and it was my car, I drove through the dips, rises, and stretches of the forest. I sweated when we needed to sneak around a blockade. Not because I thought we were in any danger, but because I had never done anything this questionable before. I nearly lost my mind when I saw a gardener at school and we were stopped in a no loading zone. I wondered if he could arrest us. In retrospect, that was dumb, but it was how I felt.<br />
<br />
When we arrived, the place was pretty for this part of the state and it was nice to basically have like a private lake. Even though this was the kind of situation where you run into Bigfoot, aliens, or the government doing something it doesn’t want you to know about. <br />
<br />
I went to go get some firewood and Joel made a slasher movie reference. I bristled that he was trying to scare the girls but did my best to play off it. I couldn’t remember any scary movies I’d seen recently though. <br />
<br />
My mind was all about Fiona, and I didn’t want her to think I was some sort of creepy guy. I tried not to go too far into the woods because of all the astronomical stuff about this place and crazy folklore had me on edge. If someone started calling my name and smelling like rotting meat, like a skinwalker, then I was climbing the car. Fortunately, there were just squirrels. <br />
<br />
Joel set everything up, but I noticed he was watching me a lot. When Duncan revealed the secret of this place, I felt thoroughly skeptical. That sort of thing was reserved for Chinese springs in anime TV shows. Fantasy. Although not to denigrate the local tribes. <br />
<br />
Of course, Joel got into it with him. And then turned his attention to me. Before I knew it, he picked me up and was dragging me to the water. My first thought was brain eating amoeba. I could tell Joel wasn’t going to just toss me without a care. He knew how to roughhouse without hurting someone. I just didn’t want any part of it and at the same time I just wanted it to be over so we could have a good laugh and forget all these crazy lake myths. <br />
<br />
The lake didn’t feel like the worst thing to land in. The water was cool but not freezing. It cushioned and propped me up after a roll. Fortunately, I was able to get to my feet and stagger to the shore. Immediately though, I felt absolutely weird and funky. <br />
<br />
My hips seemed really awkward. Swollen but slim. Plush but lean. And it felt mechanically complicated just to step onto shore. A moment later, it dawned on me that my ass was bare. What I could feel between my legs wasn’t at all normal. So much flesh and yet so little, folded, split, and raw. If I had to describe it as anything, then it felt kind of like when my allergies went off. A deep, sensitive point inside me. Vaguely like it was consumed by intangible fire. I didn’t want to imagine it dripping, like my nose did during those times.<br />
<br />
The fact I clearly had girl parts between my legs was immediately overshadowed by the massive tits rising from my chest like a prop practical joke. Ha ha, someone stuck balloons on you. No joke though.<br />
<br />
The weight of them pulled on my back, pits, and neck. They moved, jiggled, and reacted to me in a way only vaguely muted by my soaked Hawaiian shirt. How could I possibly deal with these things until it wore off? <br />
<br />
Fiona rushed over with a towel as we recovered my pants. She wanted to know if I was okay. I would’ve been better if I was still myself in that moment. All the girls started to crowd me and that was a little bit intimidating because I still had decades of feeling that girls never got this close to me for any reason. <br />
<br />
I felt so weird and told everyone as much. My drenched Hawaiian shirt would have to go. It was already starting to feel irritating, clammy, and heavy against me. I started to take it off before I realized, with alarm, that there was nothing under there to hide how I looked. I just flashed the other guys. Well, just the guys, since I currently wasn’t one of their number. <br />
<br />
Fiona led me over to the far side of my car. To say the walk was surreal would be the biggest possible understatement. I wasn’t sure what to hang onto. Pressing my thighs together to keep the feelings muted down there had the opposite effect. Trying to restrain these wild tits required pushing slender arm flesh against yielding warm boob. Fiona helped me undress when was the first to see me naked outside of my family. Not exactly the scenario I daydreamed. <br />
<br />
We were basically the same and that kind of blew my mind. She fumbled around the backseat with what clothes everyone had brought. I got permission for pretty much anything. It again melted my brain that all the girls clothes in the back was stuff that I could wear. Holding a quick breath, I gestured to one of Jess’s bikini tops. Fiona raised one of those lovely eyebrows and asked me if I was sure.<br />
<br />
A lot of me wanted to say no and just go to the safe stuff. But I was a girl and I figured, why not? It felt so insubstantial to actually wear. So vivid and exposed. Fiona had some running shorts which took care of my lower half. Still so surreal. And then she added on what seemed like a tracksuit with drawstring pants and a windbreaker for my crazy top. Fortunately, there were plenty of sandals to share.<br />
<br />
Walking back was a battle against my timid nature. Crawling into a sand hole never to be seen again seemed like a good idea. Joel noticed what I was wearing and paid extra attention to it. Being smaller made it feel like every gesture was somehow patronizing, but I was used to that in general. I was well ready to find out when this would wear off. <br />
<br />
When Duncan unfurled the truth after dancing around it, I wanted to scream that he was lying. My thick but substantial legs gave out from under me. I couldn’t even hold my mouth up to talk. Maybe plopping on the ground on my knees was a little melodramatic but I didn’t feel like hiding my emotions.<br />
<br />
Joel got up soon after and it was easy to see the outline of his… Himself… His well, his erect dick through his pants. He took a nosedive but we all knew. Any other day, I would’ve laughed it off or yelled the things that guys were always supposed to yell when something gross happened. But this day, he was different. Not just the kind of cool guy and surfer dude, whose orbit I only entered due to derision and pranks. But a man with a certain scent carried across camp on the breeze. <br />
<br />
Uncensored, my mind envisioned just the two of us. He still joked and teased but slipped warmly around me with his big arms and leaned close over my shoulder. He breathed on me and everything quivered. I could feel him rising as I settled into his lap, vulnerable but wanting to be that way. And if we were naked together…<br />
<br />
I felt abject embarrassment and screamed, “WHAT THE HELL?!?” As much to where my thoughts were leading me as to Joel getting hard just from me being around. His girlfriend chewed him out and Alyssa slipped over by my side. She offered me one of her sweaters to be a little something more than just the windbreaker. I was fine with this outfit but I put it on anyway.<br />
<br />
Joel tried to smooth things over. I wasn’t sure what to think when he referred to me as a “goddess”. The sniffles were definitely starting between my thighs. I had so many new thoughts to try on and think through. The girls eventually took me back over to the car for a more permanent outfit. It felt more like they just wanted to see me in all sorts of clothes, but I obliged. At least what they settled on looked decent and felt comfortable enough. I kept the bikini top on, for reasons I didn’t quite understand.<br />
<br />
Reflecting on everything and still getting used to walking around like this, I noticed that Alyssa snapped up the bucket for the fire and walked over to the jetty. Scooping carefully, she came up with a bucket full of lake water. Joel wasn’t really paying attention and Duncan was off to the side. The other girls soon noticed and took a little steps back. I didn’t but then I was far enough away that I didn’t seem to be at risk. Granted, if another dose of the water would change me back… I wasn’t sure if I would jump for it.<br />
<br />
Joel tried to jump with the water that Alyssa hurled at him, but it got him all over and especially in the face. Watching a transformation was way different than being the subject of one. I could see Joel’s thick muscular arms turn into tanned but slender girlish limbs poking out of his top. I felt sad but also satisfied to see him become more petite than anyone else. Her pants couldn’t stay up either. <br />
<br />
“Bitch”, sounded strange coming from a girlish voice with the intonation that Joel gave. I honestly didn’t expect her to use that word but I could understand. Alyssa rocked her head and held out a hand, as if to say, “Takes one to know one.”</p>
