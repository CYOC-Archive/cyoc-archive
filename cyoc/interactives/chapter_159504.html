<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Meat Market is known for putting on a lot of erotic shows. Some patrons have described it as like being on the film site for a porno shoot, though there&#39;s no actual sex going on. A lot of these shows are based off of Greek myths, which had no lack of sources of erotic roles for Animalians to fill in. Most of them were based off of the many dalliances of Zeus taking on different animal forms to woo new lovers. Once in a while, these shows would feature the angry retribution of Hera, though &#39;Hera&#39; here tended to be more merciful than the original had been.<br />
<br />
Though undoubtedly sexy, continued repetition of Greek erotica made it start to lose its charm. So new material has been introduced at the Meat Market. For instance, Ami had introduced Japanese geisha dancing, which could be more erotic than what westerners would think. Though these days Ami was too busy working with the Spirit Council on Heiya Island to perform. Still, there was some talk about starting a geisha school to reintroduce the style in modern times, as well as updating it for Animalian performances.<br />
<br />
Currently, the latest buzz were African-based shows. There weren&#39;t as many myths that can be adapted into erotic shows, but a tribal setting piqued interest. And two performers that stood out were King Andrew and his &#39;mate&#39;, Kinjira. Since Andrew was still coming to terms with his bisexuality, it was a little uncertain what his official relationship was with Kinjira: wife, girlfriend, or sex buddy. Though as far as Jeff was concerned, Kinjira was already his stepmother.<br />
<br />
It still made things a little awkward around the house. It wasn&#39;t that Jeff thought his father was moving on too fast from his mother&#39;s death. He clearly needed this. But Jeff was only a single-dosed lion Animalian. Unlike his father, he wasn&#39;t assigned a girlfriend when they moved here. And with this sexy lioness moving into the house to be with Andrew, to say that Jeff was sexually frustrated would be an understatement.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Jeff&#39;s predicament wasn&#39;t ignored. Miss Fabina had been around the block a few times and she knew what teenage boys were like. She did respect Andrew&#39;s decision to not have Jeff double-dose so soon, but she felt it was fair to give Jeff a taste of what maturity will have waiting for him. Being the head of the &#39;Adult Entertainment Guild&#39;, she was able to pull some strings and arrange for Jeff to have a very special look at what his father did at the Meat Market. Valentine&#39;s Day was just the day for it too. And it was certainly a memorable experience.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Jeff had a little trouble at the door with the bouncer. The one on duty that day was a particularly beefy bull. Jeff wasn&#39;t sure if the nose ring was a real piercing or a clip-on, but it certainly made the bull look scarier. &quot;Sorry, kid, no minors allowed,&quot; said the bull.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;ve got a special invitation,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; said the bull dismissively, &quot;I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, I do,&quot; said Jeff. He pulled out the invitation personally printed by Miss Fabina, &quot;See? It&#39;s completely legit.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bull examined the invitation closely. &quot;So, you&#39;re the kid that the top dog is letting to get a peek?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m here to see my dad and his mate do their show,&quot; said Jeff. The bull paused as he processed that. Then he doubled over laughing. &quot;What? What&#39;s so funny?&quot; asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing, nothing. Go on in, kid. They&#39;re waiting for you,&quot; said the bull, stepping aside. Though as Jeff walked in, his sharp feline hearing heard the bull mumbled, &quot;Man, I hope someone takes a picture of that kid&#39;s face.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t have much to compare the Meat Market to asides from old movies, and this was much more tropical than he imagined. Well, it was obviously a jungle motif, but the brightly-colored drinks looked tropical to him. Jeff wasn&#39;t left standing around on his own before a gazelle with dyed hair and hoop earring walked up to him. &quot;Oh, you must be Jeff,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m Gazette, but you can call me Onyx. I work with your father. Well, I mostly wait on tables, but they need an extra hand on stage, I&#39;m there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Jeff, trying to keep his eyes on her face and not her very tight bikini top. He could practically see her nipples through it and they were obviously pierced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, your dad will be up before long and you&#39;re getting the best seat in the house,&quot; said Onyx before leading Jeff to a table with a reservation card on it. It was right next to the stage, so Jeff will have no trouble seeing anything. &quot;Shall I get you a soda?&quot; asked Onyx.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t I have some beer?&quot; asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
Onyx laughed and patted Jeff on the head. &quot;Nice try, but we&#39;re only bending the rules so far. We can&#39;t serve alcohol to minors. I could get you some near-beer if you want. But it doesn&#39;t taste as good as real beer,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, real beer isn&#39;t supposed to taste that great, isn&#39;t it?&quot; asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re getting a soda,&quot; said Onyx flatly. Jeff shrugged as she walked off. He probably shot his mouth off there, but soda would probably taste better than near-bear anyways.<br />
<br />
Not very long after Jeff got his soda, the lights got dim. All attention was turned to the stage as the curtain lifted. The backdrop was of the African Savannah, which mostly featured tall grass and scattered trees in the distance. There was plenty of tall grass props on the stage. On the right side of the stage was King Andrew I, sitting in an African throne that probably looked nothing like a real one, if there was such a thing. He had on some arm bangles, some tribal paint, and a loincloth that didn&#39;t hide very much. Jeff was careful not to stare very long as his father&#39;s groin.<br />
<br />
Presently, Kinjara came through the &#39;tall grass&#39; and onto the stage. Much like Andrew, she was wearing bangles, paint, and a skimpy loincloth. But the only things covering her chest was a multitude of bead necklaces and it would only take a little movement to expose her nipples. &quot;Ah, my great king,&quot; said Kinjara, putting on her best African accent. Though considering Kinjara was a zoo-bred lioness, it wasn&#39;t quite perfect. &quot;Our pride has prospered greatly thanks to your great strength. There is much game in these lands for us to stalk and prey on.&quot; She did a few pouncing hops, which made her necklaces and breasts quite noticeably.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is only my kingly duty,&quot; said Andrew. He didn&#39;t bother to mimic an African accent. Any attempt would be laughable at best and offensive at worst. Instead, he went for a regal British accent. It did make a few of the audience chuckle though.<br />
<br />
&quot;My king, you speak too low of yourself,&quot; said Kinjara, &quot;What would our pride be without you to guide it?&quot; She bowed to Andrew, raising her tail up so everyone behind her could get a full view of her ass.<br />
<br />
Andrew pretended to take notice. &quot;Is there something you wish to say to me?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only to express my gratitude to you, oh mighty king,&quot; said Kinjara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?&quot; asked Andrew, &quot;Then you wouldn&#39;t mind expressing your gratitude through dance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kinjara grinned and said, &quot;It would be my pleasure.&quot; Drum music was played as Kinjara began dancing. She moved her body to the rhythm of the drums, which naturally involved a lot of bouncing. There was also a lot of provocative movement, which got the audience revved up. Jeff was so enraptured he probably wouldn&#39;t have noticed if he was drinking ink.<br />
<br />
Of course, it wasn&#39;t just the audience getting excited. Anyone looking over at Andrew would see his loincloth rising up. Eventually, Andrew got up and started joining Kinjara in her dance. That got a lot of people hooting and hollering. Jeff wasn&#39;t able to look away as the sight was burned into his mind. Pictures of him taken during that performance became the source of many a quick laugh backstage at the Meat Market.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
When asked later what he thought of the show, Jeff would have mixed feelings. For one thing, the sight of his dad dancing on a stage with a very obvious boner was something he did not want in his head. But he couldn&#39;t deny that Kinjara was incredibly appealing. While Jeff wouldn&#39;t openly admit it, it was pretty obvious he was infatuated with his stepmom. For a long time, Jeff would jack off to the memory of Kinjara dancing in beads, her breasts bouncing without restriction. Another lioness would have to work hard to outdo Kinjara in his mind. Hopefully he&#39;ll be able to find a girlfriend before he embarrasses himself.</p>
