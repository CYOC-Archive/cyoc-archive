<br />
“What the hell just happened to Frank?” Donny demanded while he and Jason slid away from the brand new girl. Unfortunately for Dave, Frank was clutching onto his arm quite tightly.<br />
<br />
Their bro was gone, replaced with a hot brunette with massive tits. All three guys couldn’t help but stare at Frank’s deep cleavage and if they hadn’t already had boners they’d definitely have them after staring at her.<br />
<br />
“I just had the best eating out of my entire life,” Frankie sighed blissfully while clutching onto Dave’s arm, convinced that they’d been dating for months now. “You’re going to have to step up your game in bed babe, or I might start coming back here all the time.”<br />
<br />
“Frank, what are you talking about?” Dave demanded while trying to pull away from Frankie. She just pushed herself closer to him. Perfume wafted off her and made his dick get even harder. He would kill to bang a girl that hot, but two minutes ago she’d been one of his best friends and now she was just all wrong.<br />
<br />
“I think someone needs a little change of mind,” their stripper, Tiara giggled before getting close to Dave. He began to sweat heavily and look for an escape but Frankie had him pinned down.<br />
<br />
“No wait! You did something to Frank! Stop!” Dave shouted but it was too late, the stripper had his pants opened up and his erect dick pulled free. She wrapped her mouth around it and began to suck, and she was good. Like blush inducing and moaning good. Her tongue swirled around his cock and Frankie giggled girlishly, snuggling up close to him and pressing her huge tits into his shoulder. He shuddered and his junk began to throb while that stripper smiled and deep throated his cock. He only lasted a few more seconds before ejaculating into her mouth. A massive moan escaped his lips and once he was done releasing his load she slid off his dick, some of his cum touching her piecing as it slid out.<br />
<br />
It glowed cold while Dave shuddered, his eyes rolling back into his head. His blonde hair cascaded down his shoulders and got all wavy while his skin darkened into a gorgeous tan. His blue eyes turned a deeper shade and drooped downwards with his eyelids getting heavy with mascara while red lipstick formed on his lips. His jaw shrunk down, his eyebrows trimmed themselves, and his Adam’s apple shrunk into near nothingness. Hook shaped earrings appeared dangling from his ears and his moans became sensual and feminine.<br />
<br />
Shoulders slimmed inwards while his body hair retreated all across his torso. His arms got smaller and his fingernails elongated and painted themselves as blue as his eyes. It wasn’t long before his pecks drooped outwards and began to expand with fat, his nipples getting larger and more sensitive until he had a nice pair of knockers on his chest that were squeezed within a lovely bra and plain white sleeveless top.<br />
<br />
His waist caved inwards sexily and tattoos began to weave up his left arm and across his left shoulder. Then his hips burst outwards and he officially became a she. Dave’s friends watched in horror as his girthy dick receded into his body showing off a vagina to the world instead. The new girl’s thighs shifted to a feminine size, her feet got smaller, and her toenails painted themselves just like her fingernails. Her underpants turned into panties to match her bra and her jeans got tighter and more form fitting.<br />
<br />
That tan spread across her whole body until she looked like an absolute beach babe. Dave’s mind settled into a happy slowness as a new reality set in and Frankie pressed herself up against her just as lovingly as she’d done when Dave had been a guy.<br />
<br />
No, Dave was a boy’s name, her name was Danielle and she had just had just been eaten out by a stripper and was basking in the afterglow. Who was Dave? She’d always been a girl.<br />
<br />
She was a woman who’d spent all her adult summers working at a beach bar. She liked the beach, vogueing her new bikini, being oogled at by men, and spending her time swimming and surfing along the coast. She made up for the lack of beaches in the winter by taking up martial arts and yoga and her body adjusted accordingly becoming a sexy and fit thing with beautiful and lithe muscles. Oh she wanted to open her own dojo when she graduated from college and was an A-grade business student suddenly, and she’d decided to start dating her roommate Frankie a few months ago and come to realize she was actually bisexual.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, that was amazing,” Danielle exhaled in a sunny California accent. Frankie giggled and moved to kiss her. Danielle couldn’t resist and the two held a passionate kiss in the afterglow of being given orgasms by the stripper’s expert tongue.<br />
<br />
“You guys are gonna love this,” Frankie moaned and their stripper turned towards the remaining two guys with a lick of her lips and a sultry gaze. Both Donny and Jason began to scream in terror as Tiara turned and began to stalk towards them.</p>
