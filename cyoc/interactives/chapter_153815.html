<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael had another agonizingly long day at school. Although things were stressful yesterday, he liked having Freddy around to be keep him company and to be able to reach him in case he dogged out again. Michael thought to call Freddy back after he hung up the phone to tell him he had second thoughts about him staying home today, but by the time he could reach him, it was already time to leave for school. <br />
<br />
At the end of the school day, Diya caught up to Michael before he left to go home.<br />
<br />
“Michael!”<br />
<br />
Michael turned around to see Diya, who, surprisingly, didn’t look all that upset considering the circumstances. Sure, she looked a bit worried, but there wasn’t a sense of anger or sadness on her face. <br />
<br />
“Diya!” Michael exclaimed. “I was looking all over for you yesterday afternoon. What happened at the principal’s office? Did you get in…”<br />
<br />
“Shh!”<br />
<br />
Diya leaned into Michael’s ear and began to whisper.<br />
<br />
“That’s what I wanted to talk to you about, but not out here. You think you can come over tonight?<br />
<br />
“Sorry Diya” Michael responded as he pulled away. “Freddy and I already have plans.”<br />
<br />
“Can’t it wait? If you’re in the kind of danger that you say you’re in, then….”<br />
<br />
“It’s about the danger we’re in.”<br />
<br />
Diya looked Michael over carefully. He didn’t give any tells on his face. She had the strangest experience yesterday afternoon and she needed to share it with Michael as soon as possible. If Michael’s date with Freddy was related to it, then she could wait, but she wanted to make sure before she let him off the hook. <br />
<br />
“Does it have anything to do with what happened on Wednesday?” Diya asked.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to reveal too much, Michael decided to give a general answer. <br />
<br />
“Yes”<br />
<br />
“Are you going back to the place you went to on Wednesday?”<br />
<br />
Michael could tell that Diya was starting to put pieces together and he wanted to misdirect her so she didn’t get too deep into his mess with Freddy. <br />
<br />
“No”<br />
<br />
“You’re lying.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“You’re lying. I am an expert body language and voice reader and I could by the slight dip at the end of that answer that you were lying. It’s an automatic tell when someone is lying.”<br />
<br />
Wanting to ease the situation, Diya gave Michael a brief hug. <br />
<br />
“I’m not going to ask you 21 questions, Michael. Just be careful and call me if you need any help.”<br />
<br />
Diya began to walk towards the neighborhood before briefly turning back to Michael.<br />
<br />
“Or if you’re ready to tell me what’s really going on. Because I have a feeling that what happened at the principal’s office yesterday has something to do with it.”<br />
<br />
Michael tried to call back to her before she walked away. He had been interested in hearing what happened to her yesterday before now, but with that last comment lingering over him, he really wanted to know what was up with her. Although he already had plans…or rather, Freddy made plans for them to see Sofya tonight, he wanted to try to make his way over to Diya’s afterwards, if it wasn’t too late. <br />
<br />
Composing himself, Michael began to walk home from school. He wasn’t really in the mood to head back so quick, so he decided to make a detour to Freddy’s first. Upon arriving, Michael heard a commotion and yelling in the backyard. He also noticed that the car was in the driveway. <br />
<br />
“That’s odd” Michael thought to himself as he approached the front door. “Freddy’s parents aren’t usually home this early.”<br />
<br />
Before he could ring the door bell, the door swung open and Michael looked out to see Freddy’s father holding Fido by the scruff of his neck, with Josh screaming and crying in the hall. <br />
<br />
“Oh Michael!” Freddy’s father exclaimed with a sigh of relief. “Thank God you’re here! Would you mind looking after Fido for a little bit?”<br />
<br />
“I want Fido!” Josh yelled back as his father blocked him from the door. “I knew it! I knew Michael hid him from me the other day!”<br />
<br />
Fido looked up at Michael with watery puppy dog eyes. <br />
<br />
“Uh” Michael responded, not sure of what to say next. “Uh, I don’t think that’s a good idea, Mr. Benson. I can’t take him home with me. My dad is allergic to dogs and he’ll throw a meltdown if he catches Fido in there.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to keep him for very long” Freddy’s father replied as he pushed Fido onto Michael. “Just until we can sort this issue out with our neighbor.”<br />
<br />
“He’s not coming back here!” Bill yelled as he made his way over to Michael and approached Freddy’s father. “That dog ruined my $5000 fence that I just had put up to keep Ellie in my yard. He is not to come back in this house under any circumstances, do you understand me?!”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Bill” Freddy’s father responded. “You don’t have the right to tell us what we can and can’t keep in our backyard. And for all you know, it was Ellie who knocked down that fence. Did you see which way it fell?”<br />
<br />
“Impossible! My precious little Ellie does not have the strength to knock down a fence like that. Only a big dog, like your big dog!”<br />
<br />
Bill pointed to Fido as the dog whimpered. <br />
<br />
“Has the strength to knock down a fence like that” Bill continued. “And besides, this mangy mutt is responsible for mating with my dog Ellie and getting her pregnant!”<br />
<br />
“It’s not our fault that you never bothered to spay your dog, Bill” Freddy’s father responded. <br />
<br />
“So you admit it! It is your dog!”<br />
<br />
“He is our dog! Josh responded behind his father’s back. “It’s our dog Fido!”<br />
<br />
“It’s not our dog Bill” his father interjected. “It’s a stray that’s been roaming around the neighborhood and we’ve been keeping it on and off until we can find it’s owner.”<br />
<br />
“My dad didn’t bother to put up any missing dog posters! That means we were going to keep it!”<br />
<br />
“Josh!” his father scolded him. <br />
<br />
“Whatever the case!” Bill continued to yell. “I don’t want this dog on or near my property ever again, you understand me?! Ever! And you, young man!”<br />
<br />
Bill pointed to Michael. Nerves grew rapidly as Fido began to growl. <br />
<br />
“Take this mangy mutt and be sure it never comes over here ever again! If I catch this dog over here one more time, I’m calling the pound!”<br />
<br />
Fido began to bark loudly as Bill went back over to his property. Fido’s barking continued until Michael scratched his head and asked him to calm down. Fido began to whimper as Michael knew he had no other choice. In resignation, Michael began to walk home with Fido before Freddy’s mother ran up to him.<br />
<br />
“Wait Michael” she called as he turned to face her. “You might want this.”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s mother gave him Fido’s collar and leash as Michael debated whether to put it around the dog’s neck or not. Deciding on it for now, Michael bent down to tie the collar around Fido’s neck. Fido whimpered loudly as Michael secured the latch and attached the leash to the collar. <br />
<br />
“Come on boy” Michael called to Fido. “Let’s go somewhere.”<br />
<br />
Fido whined loudly as Michael gently nudged him to begin walking. As they made some distance from Freddy’s house, Michael stopped to bend over and whisper in Fido’s ear. <br />
<br />
“Guess your urges got the best of you again, huh Freddy?”<br />
<br />
Fido nodded. He could tell that Michael had a pained expression on his face. He wanted to lick his face to cheer his boyfriend up, but decided against it.<br />
<br />
“Tell you what” Michael continued. “My parents shouldn’t be home for a little while. I know it’s risky letting you shed your dog hair all over the place, but maybe we can masturbate you back and then it won’t be a problem anymore. How does that sound?”<br />
<br />
Fido barked, almost too enthusiastically as Michael went to scratch his head and then got up to continue walking Fido to Michael’s house. Once they arrived, Michael noticed there were no cars in the driveway. <br />
<br />
“Good” Michael thought to himself. “Maybe I’ll have enough time to get Freddy off so he can change back before my parents get home.”<br />
<br />
Michael proceeded to take Fido to the front door as he used a key to unlock it and let themselves back in. Fido hadn’t been in this house in several days. Not since Michael first insisted that they go back to Freddy’s house when he changed into a dog in his room. Fido took in the sights, sounds and smells as he was led back up into Michael’s room. From there, Michael shut the door behind him and locked it as Fido made his way to the bed and hopped up onto it. <br />
<br />
“Alright, boy, I mean, Freddy” Michael said as he motioned Fido to make eye contact with him. Michael began to take off the collar as he did so. “Sorry, force of habit. Anyways, I don’t know what happened in your house, but you can tell me all about it after you change back again.”<br />
<br />
Noticing the lack of penis sticking out from Fido’s sheath, Michael looked through his drawers to find something to help. Fido watched closely, not sure what Michael was planning to do, but hoping it wasn’t something dangerous or scary. Finally, Michael pulled out a strange bottle and squirted a spritz into his hand. Michael then proceeded to put his hand to Fido’s snout. <br />
<br />
“Smell this.”<br />
<br />
Fido put his nose to Michael’s hand and begin to sniff it cautiously. At first, nothing seemed to be happening, but after a minute of so, he began to feel his loins moving again as his dick began to emerge from his sheath. <br />
<br />
“Thought this might work” Michael said as he closed the bottle and put it away. “I found this online from a dog breeders website. It’s supposed to make virile male dogs get instant erections so they can be masturbated for dog semen samples. It appears that it worked, so let’s get started.”<br />
<br />
Freddy didn’t like how scientific and technical Michael was being about all of this. Sex is supposed to be fun. He wasn’t some science experiment or lab animal to do testing on. Freddy wanted this to be more intimate, even if they weren’t the same species anymore. As Michael got a bottle of lube and sprayed lotion on his hand, he felt Fido licking him across the face. <br />
<br />
“What are you doing that for?” Michael asked as he swatted Fido’s head away. <br />
<br />
Fido whimpered as Michael looked at him. Fido’s eyes were watery as his tongue began panting wildly. <br />
<br />
“Oh” Michael replied, figuring out what Fido was hinting at. “You want to engage in foreplay?”<br />
<br />
Fido nodded as he motioned to Michael with his snout. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know, Freddy” Michael responded with hesitation. “I’m not really into dogs, but I’ll let you take the lead.”<br />
<br />
Fido began to lick all over Michael’s face. Michael sat motionless, slightly squirming as he was unsure of how to respond to Fido’s advances. Fido continued licking down Michael’s neck as he motioned for him to take off his shirt. Michael lifted it up over his head as Fido began to lick at his nipples. <br />
<br />
“Oh this is nice” Michael responded with a tinge of lust as he could feel his cock stir in his pants. “Oh man, Freddy. You really know how to turn me on, even as a dog.”<br />
<br />
Fido noted Michael’s erection as he began to lick his crotch area. Michael thought for a moment, but then decided against taking off his pants. Michael continued to reach around until he found Fido’s dick waving from his sheath. He grabbed it gently and began to rub it back and forth while Fido licked his neck. They would have continued doing this until they heard a loud banging at Michael’s door.<br />
<br />
It was….</p>
