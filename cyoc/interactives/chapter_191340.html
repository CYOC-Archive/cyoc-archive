<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max With The Biggest Smile In The World Just Had This Smoking Hot Girl Suck His Dick He Didn&#39;t Care If It Was His Sister That Fact Only Makes It More Awesome His Sister Or More Accurately His Former Brother Who Wouldn&#39;t Even Think About Dick Was Sucking His And Loving Every Second Of It He Had The Power To Do All That And More He Sets His Sister&#39;s Breasts To Be Full Again Then Makes Himself A Baby On A Timer He Also Makes It So His Sister Will Be Forced To Focus On Him And Not The Device Giving Her An Insane Maternal Instinct <br />
Within Seconds Max Had Changed From A 14 Year Old Boy To A 10 Month Old Baby<br />
<br />
When Riley Finished She Felt Relief, Accomplishment, Shame, Disgust, And Maybe A Little Pride She Just Sucked Her Brothers Dick And All She Could See When She Looked At His Face Down Was A Dumb Grin He Just Made Her Suck His Dick And He&#39;s Happy She Was Going To Get Her Revenge... If Max Didn&#39;t Do Something First... What She Hadn&#39;t Noticed Was Max Already Making A Change She Saw As Began Shrinking Into A Baby And Almost Immediately All Feelings Of Rage And Revenge Disappeared All She Felt Was Concern, Love, Confident <br />
Her Brother Needed Something From Her And She Was Happy To Give She Lifted Him Up And He Began Nursing...<br />
<br />
While She Had Max Nursing She Picked Up The Device And Saw A Countdown When She Saw What That Was For She Cancelled It Max As A 14 Year Old Boy Couldn&#39;t Be As Safe As He Was In Her Arms<br />
She Made Her Milk All Around Better For Max Healthier, Tastier, And Much Less Filling So He Would Almost Always Need More  <br />
She Also Made It So He Always Wanted Her Milk And That She Would Never Run Out <br />
She Made It So He Would Never Age And Used The Device To Make A Clothing Item To Hold Him Safely So He Never Detached From Her Breasts <br />
She Then Made It So Whenever Max Was Close To Her He Would Feel Safe And When He Got Far Away He Would Crave Her Body<br />
She Was Confident This Would Be Enough To Keep Max Safe And Happy Always Within Sight Where She Could Keep Nice Warm And Safe<br />
<br />
Max While Nursing With Each Suck He Felt Better Drinking But Like He Was Getting Less And He Was So Hungry He Needed More He Craved More Despite His Best Efforts Never Getting Enough In The Middle Of This He Did Notice That He Was Being Held Better Closer To The Breast Also Safer Like He Could Move Around And Not Fall Which Really Pleased Him Being Closer To His Sister Just Felt Nice Warm, Safe, Secure It Was A Really Addictive Feeling That He Fell Asleep But Even In His Sleep He Continued To Drink From The Breast<br />
<br />
Riley Satisfied Does Something She Thinks Alex And Noah Mom Would Love And Makes Both Of Them 10 Months Old Before Leaving To Her Home... It Was Hours Later Back At Her Home When Max Woke Up... He Wakes Up In A Fuss He Realized When He Woke Up That He Was Still A Baby He Woke Up In Some Crib And Immediately He Felt So Cold And Alone He Didn&#39;t Feel Safe At All With No Properly Functioning Vocal Cords At The Moment All He Could Do Was Cry Until Riley Picked Him Up He Didn&#39;t Hear What She Said But As Soon As He Was In Her Arms He Felt Safe, So Warm It Was Nice All His Fear Was Gone Like That... He Was Silent And Tried To Stay Still As Riley Put Him In The Clothing Item That Holds Him To Her Breast And Soon As He Was Placed In He Started Sucking It Was Magical And All His Concern About The Timer Were Gone If He Was Stuck As A Baby It Didn&#39;t Matter His Sister Was Here And For Now That Was All He Needed<br />
<br />
Riley Hears Max Crying In The Other Room And She Goes Over To Him And Picks Him Up And Says &quot;Hello, Max How Are You Fancy Day For Revenge Don&#39;t You Think, Your Gonna Be Stuck Like This Forever, You Messed With My Brain Making It So I Can&#39;t Change Back Into A Man But If I Can&#39;t Be A Man Then You Have To Be A Baby Forever And While Your That Baby&quot; The Part Of Riley&#39;s Brain That&#39;s Hopped Up On Maternal Instincts Says &quot;Make Sure Your Life Is A Perfect As I Can Make It, Ensuring Your Safety And Happiness&quot;  &quot;See, Everytime I Think Of Hurting Or Harming You That Happens...Are You Even Listening&quot;   Riley Other Half Then Says As Max Begins Sucking Her Breast<br />
Riley Then Says &quot;Of Course Not, Drink Away Max It Will Be A Long Time Before You Stop&quot;</p>
