<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I decided to try possessing someone else&#39;s body in order to slip into the city. With a few minutes of waiting, I noticed an adorable little black kobold adorned in golden jewellery make his way behind the trees as he exited a fancy-looking carriage. A merchant, probably. I followed him stealthily.<br />
<br />
Public nudity was more or less acceptable, I noted. Looking at the crowds of male and female beastmen alike, I noticed that some preferred to rock it in their birthday suit, often with only some underwear to obscure their crotch and/or breasts. The kobold was no different. He had a lot of accessories, sure, even a… huh, golden collar, but he was only wearing some silky white thong. The rest of his toned build was on full display. While he was doing his business, I pulled out my scimitar. Landing a strike on him with the hilt, I heard the world announce it was a critical hit because of Sneak Attack. The kobold fell unconscious, giving me an opportunity to possess him.<br />
<br />
The world was reduced to simple shapes. The soul was nothing but a pyramid, a hierarchy of desires and needs, commanded by the consciousness that stood at the very top. Like a toy, I pulled the top level off of the pyramid and tossed it aside, placing my own consciousness at the top of the pyramid. I felt myself growing closer, and closer, until-.<br />
<br />
Opening my eyes, I hissed as a sharp pain struck them. The light of the outside world wasn&#39;t good for my kobold eyes. Standing up, I blushed as I realised how small I was. I was maybe three feet tall, completely miniscule compared to Master-. Wait, Master? My feet dragged themselves on their own, bringing me back to the carriage my body originally came from. I wasn&#39;t possessing a kinky kobold merchant, no, I was possessing a slave. I found my way back to the carriage. I was too short to get in myself, so a h-handsome bear effortlessly grabbed me by the shoulders and gently placed me inside. My eyes opened up more as I finally escaped the terrible, terrible foe known as The Sun. My scales felt much cooler, too. <br />
<br />
&quot;You took your time, whelp.&quot; A booming voice resonated through the inside of the carriage, making me jump up in fear as my tail shot up to balance me. Turning my head, I saw Master. A big, handsome, muscular, dominant, perfect, naked golden dragon anthro. I felt my being submitting to him as the desire to serve his every whim took root in my consciousness. <br />
<br />
Kobolds LIVED to serve dragons. I was nothing more than a kobold right now, so… I lived to serve dragons, too. The dragon in front of me seemed very upset. I opened my mouth to speak, but…<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t even THINK about talking unless I order you to. There&#39;s another way you can explain yourself…&quot; he rubbed his slit, making the tip of his ridged shaft come out. With a flick of his fingers and some whispers, he cast a quick spell. What was it?... I felt my consciousness begin to fade as a vibration in my rump made my cock stand at attention.<br />
<br />
When I awoke, my whole body felt like it just went through a rigorous exercise. My ass was so sore. Moving my clawed hand up my body, I blushed as I felt my belly bloated with my Master&#39;s seed. Looking around, I noticed that it was dark, and we were in some sort of bedroom. Me and Master, that is. A part of my brain told me that, in a way, my attempt to get inside the city was a success. Master&#39;s powerful arms were wrapped around me as my nose absorbed the delicious aroma of the dragon. Nothing made me feel happier. I belonged here.<br />
<br />
I maintained consciousness despite my body&#39;s best wishes. I managed to persuade the kobold to not think of this as anathema by telling him that this would give us more time to ogle the dragon, which actually worked better than I expected. I spun in my Master&#39;s grasp, facing my muzzle at the dragon&#39;s meaty pecs, absorbing the masculine smell as I waited for him to get further into his sleep.<br />
<br />
Soon, his hold on me grew weaker. With some hesitation, I slipped out of Master&#39;s grasp, silently falling on a carpeted floor. Disobeying the Master was kinda hot, the kobold thought. He’d be punished eventually, which was exciting. Using Kinempathy, I told the kobold to not move a muscle until Master woke up. The kobold&#39;s will was incredibly malleable, I found, as my whole body seized up on the spot. This gave me an opportunity to stop the possession safely. Mentally willing myself to end the possession, I slowly crawled out of the kobold&#39;s tiny body as he remained motionless.<br />
<br />
A moment later, I was standing in the middle of a luxurious-looking room. This dragon seemingly had wealth beyond comparison. My brain cleared up as I stopped thinking of him as my Master, instead starting to think about him as a potential victim. The dragon was unconscious. I had a perfect shot. Slowly putting my hands on his chiselled torso, I began the possession. My heart was beating anxiously. If this didn&#39;t work,  I&#39;d get my ass obliterated instantaneously once he woke up. I tried to possess him slowly, cautiously.<br />
<br />
The soul was the core of a mortal&#39;s being. It drew in mana and dispersed it across the body, empowering it in various ways. It pulsed with a blinding light inside of the dragon. I would slowly dim it and substitute his mana for mine. Focusing my will against the unaware dragon, his heartbeat slowed down as the soul pulsed slower, slower, dimmer, dimmer…<br />
<br />
I was reminded that my possession was a touch attack. Keyword was &quot;Attack&quot;. A window that popped up succinctly informed me that my possession would&#39;ve failed if it wasn&#39;t for the Sneak Attack feature. With a relieved sigh, my head sank into the body of the dragon, going unconscious as I finished submerging into the hunky reptile.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I opened my eyes, through the open ceiling of the roof I could see that it was already late into the morning. My body felt heavy, strong… burning, practically, as a power inside my belly wanted to spring to the surface. I opened my golden muzzle, breathing out a spray of fire, announcing to the world that I was awake. Getting out of the bed, I saw a kobold sprawled out on the ground, breathing heavily as he finally got some relief after holding the same position for what was probably six or more hours. That insignificant lizard was me, what felt like moments ago? Impossible. I flexed my muscles into a massive mirror embroidered with gold, taking a look at my masculine form. This was a body worthy of a dragon.<br />
<br />
A more autonomous part of my mind realised that I was taking on the dragon’s arrogance. What was worse was that, since I barely lucked out with possessing the dragon’s body, there would be practically no chance of me changing his personality with Kinempathy. Which meant that I would likely have to embrace how the dragon behaved, since I would not be able to maintain control of the body in case anathema started creeping up on me. This also made me facepalm mentally as I realised that, once again, I got myself into a situation where I had to be afraid of the body I was possessing. Fuck it, we’ll come up with a plan to escape the dragon’s fury later. I wanted to go for a spin, first. What was the life of a dragon like?<br />
<br />
Digging through the knowledge of the dragon, I quickly established that he was some kind of royalty. A deeper look through his memories established that this was a very cushy job, as expected. His money bankrolled ventures across town. The ventures, once successful, gave the dragon returns on his investments, ensuring a steady flow of cash to the dragon. Those who didn’t pay up were eaten, of course. The rest of the dragon’s life was mostly spent fucking, buying up expensive items and property, sleeping, having his body worshipped by slaves… I wanted to free them, but I quickly found out that this was SUPER anathema. Dragons needed their servants, after all.<br />
<br />
The body I possessed was the body of a privileged dick, apparently. And I couldn’t do anything about it, as I will soon be forced to play the role of a rich jerk. Trying to put my reservations aside, I focused myself on trying to enjoy this. I WAS incredibly attractive, virile, physically capable… I must’ve been like 9 feet tall. My biceps were thicker than some people’s bodies, my abs counted twelve thick lumps, my tail could incapacitate a man… my sharp teeth could chew through steel. I was perfection.<br />
<br />
A look at my characteristics gave me a nosebleed as I opened up the character menu.<br />

Not only could I punch and chew through steel, I think steel wouldn’t even be able to pierce my scales. I possessed someone really high-level. This could be a problem. What was my racial?<br />

Oooh, is that true? I turned to the kobold lying on the floor. Poor fucker passed out from exhaustion. Waving my hand, I willed him to reinvigorate with energy as I softly whispered a prayer to Nabaru. The lizard shot up as fire coursed through his body, restoring his energy. He turned to face me, his head arching far back to meet my gaze. He didn’t dare to speak, the command from yesterday still firmly merged inside his mind, but I could see he was grateful. He was hesitant, too, as he was privy to the fact that his Master was being possessed. Not that it stopped his Master from manipulating him, though, it would seem. He was torn. He lived to serve dragons, yet… was I a dragon? His mind wasn’t certain, despite the answer being obvious.<br />
<br />
My body felt insulted that the kobold doubted me. More than that, the kobold got out of bed while I was sleeping with him. He needed to be punished. I picked him up by a horn with just the two of my fingers as he squirmed. I contently noted that one of my arms alone was bigger than the tiny kobold. This gave me ideas…<br />
<br />
I put my other hand on his clawed feet. With a hungry grin, I pushed the top and bottom of his body closer together as the kobold shrank in my hands. I felt like enough was enough when he shrank to about 4 inches tall. When I was done, he was barely the size of one of my fingers. I roared loudly, ordering a servant to come in. A servant timidly stepped from underneath the marble archway leading into the hallway, bowing as he held a large tray of breakfast. He put it on a large, long dinner table, turning towards me as he waited for further orders, hands clasped behind his back.<br />
<br />
I inspected his body as I towered over him, palm of my hand still holding a tiny kobold. This was a chubby polar bear, adorned in the same jewellery that marked all of my servants. He was pretty tall, strong… yet, of course, completely inferior when put in comparison to me. I flashed a quick smile as I looked at his body, waving a hand as I envisioned his body a little bit flabbier. The firmness of his gut collapsed, the fat falling down as it grew in volume. The polar bear blushed as he tried to cover his erection with a large paw.<br />
<br />
Reaching down with a claw, I pushed his hand out of the way as I slipped the kobold onto his cock, nesting him in-between the snow-white shaft and the flab of the bear. I commanded the ursine, worming a hint of aggression into the voice to keep the slave on edge. “Don’t lose the passenger, fatty. If you don’t bring the kobold back by the end of the day, you’re going to be the one riding someone else&#39;s, next.” The bear nodded as sweat formed on his face. He smiled nervously as he stroked himself to keep his 6’’ shaft firm, balancing the kobold. <br />
<br />
I sat down on a large chair in front of the table, practically a throne. The soft cushions felt good against my muscled hindquarters. My tail slipped underneath the back of the chair as I bit into a roasted chicken, starting my breakfast. Swallowing it whole, bones too, I pushed it down my throat. My, that felt good… why was the bear still here?<br />
<br />
“Get on with your duties before I make you regret waking up today.” I growled at the bear as he jumped up anxiously before hurriedly making his way out of the room. I continued my breakfast, happily chewing through the delicious meat my servants made for me. <br />
<br />
<br />
The next half an hour was pretty fucking good. I finished my breakfast, started taking a nice swim in the pool… I was, unfortunately, taken out of my delight by a servant who got inside the pool and began reading off my expected responsibilities for the day. A soft-spoken lithe otter was looking at me, holding a list as he floated on his back. <br />
<br />
“It has been a week since you were assigned your spiritual advisor.” He smirked knowingly. “Before leaving, the esteemed representative of the clergy wished to take a look through the treasury to see if the relics have been kept in good condition.” I nodded absentmindedly. “Of course, the servants wish to give the priest a warm goodbye.” The otter chuckled before flipping to the next page.<br />
<br />
“The city council is meeting today. You’re expected to be seen, but you’re also expected to not show up as you often don’t… you also need to convince some disrespectful folks to pay up…” My ears perked up. Turning to face the otter, I grabbed him by one of his short legs and pulled him towards me. Practically snarling in his face, I angrily asked who wasn’t paying their dues. The otter yelped before closing his eyes and regaining composure, continuing to speak with a soft tone. “There are two blacksmiths in the guild district that have decided that they’ve had enough of paying their debts. The driver has been instructed of their location.” <br />
<br />
I took in a deep breath, small bursts of flame releasing from my nostrils as I released the otter and leaned back on the edge of the pool. The otter, appearing unphased, continued to list off activities… By now I wasn’t listening. To say that I was bothered by the disrespect of those… blacksmiths, would be the greatest understatement. I was fucking furious. Livid. Five minutes later, the otter was done with reading the list. As he got out of the pool, I threw a quick shout at him.<br />
<br />
“Cancel everything other than the business with the clergyman and the blacksmiths! If someone complains, they can have a word about it with me personally.”<br />
The otter nodded, making his way out of the room. <br />
<br />
<br />
Eventually I got out of the pool. I ordered some servants to get me ready to meet the priest. Most of the preparation was just putting on the ceremonial robes, honestly. Clothes made me uncomfortable - they made me sweaty AND on top of that they obscured my perfect body from the world. What’s the point? After some perfumes were spritzed on me, I stormed out of the room. Where was the fucking priest?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here at the palace we had somewhat of a tradition. Every month, my esteemed Father would send a priest to educate me on matters of faith, morality, philosophy, history… Not being one to deny Him, of course, I obediently let the men teach me. They were often appalled by the terrible, debaucherous behaviour that took place in my land, but were impressed with my knowledge… They tried to teach me the virtues of chastity and humility… pfft… I laughed just thinking about it. They earnestly believed that they could instruct the child of a god on matters of religion or lifestyle, that they could “turn me away from my darkness”. Pitiful. <br />
<br />
Me and Father came to some sort of compromise. After a week, the priests would find themselves… stuck in my care permanently. This gave Nabaru an opportunity to get rid of His… less than desirable followers, and gave me an opportunity to expand my staff. And it would still accomplish His original goal of making sure I had a proper education.<br />
Making my way to the grand hall, I was greeted with the stoic mug of a lanky elf adorned in robes matching mine. By now, after putting up with a week of my bullshit, he held no reverence for me. There was no bowing, merely a polite nod and a half-assed greeting.<br />
<br />
“Thrithritigilifirythritglifryn,” he addressed me by my name effortlessly, “I’ve sent word of this week to our glorious Father. I’m sure he is to no end disappointed with your lecherous behaviour,” The man held no fear for me. They were always assured of their invincibility, believing that my Father would somehow protect them from me. Ah, their arrogance could not be rivalled by anyone… <br />
<br />
“...but I have done my best to succinctly praise you for the virtues you do hold.” He waited for some sort of response. I stood with my arms crossed and huffed silently, sparks flying from my nostrils. Sighing, he continued. “Upon my review, I have concluded that the holy relics of our faith simply cannot remain in this palace. Their prolonged proximity to repeated sin is going to reduce their power.” <br />
<br />
Ah. Of course. I grinned. “How do you plan on carrying all of them out of here, honoured priest?” I said as I started leading him to the treasury. <br />
<br />
“You will, with no doubt, assist me in this task. You must see the wisdom of this, too, should the prolonged survival of our faith be a priority to you.” He replied nonchalantly. <br />
<br />
The idea that relics could be corrupted by their proximity to sin wasn’t unfounded. It has happened in the past, which is why a tradition of burying religious artefacts deep underground or in secret lairs became very widespread. <br />
<br />
The priest did not understand my Father very well, though. This was fair, as not very many people did. Dad is fucking horny. I can name 800 siblings just off the top of my head, and my extended senses tell me I must have about 3000 close relatives in total. What happened in my palace wasn’t an act of sin. Nay, it was devotion in its purest form. Spreading commandments of “chastity” was just his way of fucking with the priests who couldn’t read between the lines when they were learning that Nabaru has thousands of children. No, not even “read between the lines” just “read”. Wasn’t it fucking obvious? Guy fucks about on par with Meref.<br />
<br />
“You sure you want to separate a dragon from his rightfully inherited hoard, though?” My voice rumbled as I gave the priest an intent look.<br />
<br />
“Our Father rewards those who sacrifice what they’ve come to earn. Our scriptures say-.”<br />
<br />
I shut out the priest’s lecture as we walked through the halls, I tried to recall how many times the priest tried to lecture me on something. Like… twenty times, before he gave up? This would be twenty one. Waving my hand, I whispered a prayer to Nabaru as I ordered one of the nearby slaves to gather some servants near the hoard.<br />
<br />
We stood in front of the gates protecting the treasury. A small crowd of servants began to gather around us as I traced a glyph on the ebony doors, removing the magical protection. Pushing the doors aside, I sarcastically bowed for the priest to enter.<br />
<br />
The treasury was everything that a dragon could yearn from. The wide room was brimming with mounds of gold, various relics poking from every pile. Chests full of jewels, magical artefacts, legendary weapons. Full-sized paintings, statues… The sight made my heart flutter. It was perfect. A part of my mind, one that felt meek and distant by now, wanted to grab some of these for the future.<br />
<br />
The priest was in awe. I chuckled deeply. “Do you still want to live a humble life, honoured guest?” Regaining his resolve, he shook his head as he started scanning the room for religious relics. I took the moment to stuff a golden collar given to me by a nearby servant into the pocket of my robe, flicking my tail happily as I savoured the taste of prey in the air with my tongue.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, dear sir, I think I see one.” I said giddily, pointing at a ceremonial sword poking out of a pile of rubies. He nodded, not sharing in my excitement, quickly climbing the pile and pulling the adorned longsword out. Focusing his gaze on it, he shook his head.<br />
<br />
“It’s a relic of Nabaru, but it appears uncorrupted.” He pondered for a moment. “Perhaps some relics are… accepting of your behaviour. We need to find the relics that are already in the process of corruption.” He reached a conclusion. Ah, to see them change their tune as cogs turned in their heads. “To hold something like this, something so close to my god, fills my soul with peace. I am grateful for the opportunity to lay my hands on these relics.”<br />
<br />
“Of course. Feel free to search. I doubt you will find anything corrupted.” I fell on one of the piles of gold, stretching my muscles in the soft, heat conducting metal. The priest, rolling his eyes, moved through my hoard, systematically analysing the relics one by one. <br />
<br />
I was tired of the foreplay after about fifteen minutes. The priest’s face was growing increasingly bewildered, and it WAS fun to see them rationalise things as they slowly reached a truth they did not want to believe, but I had business to get to. Standing up, I blissfully listened to the clinging of the coins as they fell down to fill the alcove I left in the pile. I pulled out the collar, snapping it on the priest’s neck as he jumped up in surprise. Grabbing a fistful of gold to fulfil the material components for the spell, I began chanting the words of a ritual to make the priest into another one of my servants. As I began the chant, the priest’s body froze up, eyes filling with worry. Ah, but he was powerless to do anything with the collar numbing his will. These toys were wonderful.<br />
<br />
Within five minutes, I moulded his mind to become a servant of the palace. I connected his soul to mine. I made him accept all commands I would say. I unbound the shackles restricting his mortal vessel, making him malleable to my every whim, both in mind and in body. Jewellery slowly formed on his body as his robe transformed into a silky thong. Golden bracers, golden necklace, golden piercings… heh, he needed a nipple piercing. I gave him two. The elf’s lanky body was on full display as I planted lustful thoughts inside of his mind. <br />
<br />
Once I finished the spell, he fell down to the ground. I grabbed him with one of my arms, throwing him out of the treasury into a crowd of excited servants. Closing the doors behind me, I resealed the treasury. <br />
<br />
I looked over the servants that had gathered. So many naked men, all eagerly looking at me as they waited for what was to come next. I looked over the crowd, my stature towering over all of them. I leaned on the ebony doors.<br />
<br />
“Who has seniority among you?” I asked the servants casually. Quickly looking between themselves, an otter from the pool stepped out. “Ah, you. Very well… you get the first shot. Out of twenty one. What should our new servant be like?” <br />
<br />
Because I could turn them into anything, it was difficult to pick what exactly I wanted in a new servant. There wasn&#39;t any niche that wasn&#39;t already satisfied for me, so… newcomers were transformed by the jury of their peers. This made the process simpler and it created more variety in my servants. Good for morale, too. I crossed my arms as I waited for the otter to decide. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want him to be a wolverine! Slightly below my size, and, um… very… friendly… towards… me… you know…&quot; The otter blushed as he bashfully stated his desires. So be it. Waving my hands casually as I offered another prayer to Dad, the elf&#39;s form began to shrink and fill as his limbs shortened, his torso grew, his head flattened into a muzzled form with cute little round ears forming on the top of his head… his hands turned into paws… a small tail formed, and then… With a &quot;BOOMPFH&quot;, his whole form rounded out as an explosion of brown and black fur growing suddenly on his body made his lanky form look less anorexic and more-so twinky.<br />
<br />
The otter looked down at his new friend with delight. Oh, yeah… the mental changes. Continuing to work my magic on the wolverine, I made the shorter mustelid madly infatuated with the larger one. As the ex-priest stood up, he blushed at the size difference between him and the otter, covering up his crotch as he stammered at the sight of his new crush making bedroom eyes at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back of the line, otter.&quot; I barked at the taller mustelid before he interrupted the proceedings. A queue was forming to change the newblood. The otter&#39;s horny face soured slightly as he went to the start of the queue.<br />
<br />
The servants eagerly stated their desires one by one. &quot;Make him chubbier, he hardly has any meat on his bones!&quot; &quot;Give him bigger balls!&quot; &quot;He&#39;s going to need strong arms if he&#39;s going to do any work around the palace!&quot; The way they phrased it irked me. I obliged all of them, filling the twinky wolverine into a chubby, thick-armed man with a nice bulge, but I didn&#39;t like to be ordered.<br />
<br />
I barked at the tiny servants, fire flaring from my nostrils. &quot;Next one of you who states their REQUEST as a COMMAND is going to be turned into a cockring for a year. Be humble.&quot; They nodded their heads in shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can he… get really aroused by spankings?&quot; A parrot said with a blush. That was better. Waving my hand, I made it true. It went both ways though, the parrot found out when he got a loud smack on his feathered rump.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you make him turned on by musk?&quot; &quot;Can he have a really deep voice?&quot; &quot;Can he have a thicker cock?&quot; &quot;Can he be an exhibitionist?&quot; &quot;Can you make him completely submissive to taller men?&quot; &quot;Can he have a buttplug that anyone else can turn on and off with a snap of a finger?&quot; <br />
<br />
Some of these are more inspired than others. Making it all come true, I heard the otter snap his fingers from the middle of the queue. A deep moan escaped the wolverine&#39;s mouth as he started getting sexually stimulated by the vibrations, pulling down his thong as he showed off his fat balls and thick hog to the happy servants. We were 11 down. Ten to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can he be a total nerd?&quot; &quot;Could you make him very ticklish?&quot; &quot;Can you make him aroused by bites?&quot; <br />
<br />
It was the otter&#39;s turn again. Looking at his much changed wolverine, he gave him a quick kiss on the cheek before making a request. &quot;Can you make it so that he forgets that he had sex, like, an hour after it happens? So every time it&#39;s like his first time…&quot; the otter asked humbly. Ha. Sure. Good guess on his part that the cleric was a virgin. The otter took off the wolverine&#39;s newly formed glasses, hopping away giddily as the wolverine&#39;s vision grew terrible. <br />
<br />
Seven.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can his nipples be really sensitive?&quot; &quot;Can he be really in denial about how much he likes sucking cock?&quot; &quot;Can you make it so that, despite his power and weight, anyone can pick him up and carry him with ease?&quot; <br />
<br />
Four.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can he be, like… really into paws?&quot; &quot;Can he have bigger paws??&quot; Had to happen eventually.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make him shorter.&quot; Fire flaring from my nostrils, I looked down at the servant who asked that. The polar bear. He missed the memo. <br />
<br />
Other men gasped as the polar bear looked around, confused. With weight in my every step, I walked towards the snow-white ursine, crossing my arms. &quot;Where&#39;s the whelp?&quot; I asked with anger in my voice, flashing my teeth as the servant started looking worried. He hurriedly reached into his underwear and pulled out a tiny speck of a kobold. I quickly reversed the shrinking spell on the lizard, making him fall out of the bear&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t have to explain myself to the bear. If he didn&#39;t hear it the first time, there was no point in telling him again. With a snap of my fingers, the man&#39;s form immediately vanished. A clanking of metal against the floor revealed his new shape - one of a golden ring. Walking over to the wolverine, I adjusted it&#39;s size before sliding it on the mustelid&#39;s shaft. <br />
<br />
Usually, I&#39;d just set the duration of the spell to be indefinite. In a year, everyone would conveniently forget that the ring was actually a servant. Despite being conscious the whole time, you couldn&#39;t exactly say anything if you were a ring, either. A… kinder part of me, though, for whatever reason decided to set the duration for exactly a year. I suppose I&#39;m nothing if not just. <br />
<br />
Pressing my hand down on the wolverine&#39;s head I shrank him a couple of inches. The kobold stood motionless, awaiting orders. The rest of the servants were tense, no one quite ready to step up to request the final transformation. I looked down at the kobold. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have seniority, whelp. The change.&quot; I said angrily, still irked by the disrespect of the bear.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-master, c-could you please… um… make the man able to communicate with the cockring telepathically?&quot; Finally, some fucking proper respect. I happily obliged, raising my hands up as I connected the bear&#39;s and the wolverine&#39;s consciousnesses.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, we&#39;re fucking done, take the newblood away and fill him in on his responsibilities.&quot; I clapped my hands, servants taking the cue to lead the man into the servant&#39;s quarters. The otter picked the wolverine up effortlessly as he started whispering some sweet words into his blushing ears. The kobold stayed behind, waiting for my orders. The whole process of conditioning the priest took like ten minutes at most. Were it just me here, I&#39;d probably spend like… four hours just trying to name twenty kinks.<br />
<br />
Wasting no time, I removed these stupid fucking robes, tossing them to the side. Grabbing the kobold by the horn, I picked him up and dragged him to the outside, an opulent carriage greeting me as a burly badger waited patiently in the driver&#39;s seat, cracking some jokes to a brown bear I remember seeing yesterday. Quickly getting inside, I put the kobold on a seat opposite of mine as I knocked on the window of the carriage, telling the servants to take me to the blacksmiths.</p>
