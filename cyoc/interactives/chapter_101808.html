<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel looked around unsure of where The Scribe would be coming from when he spotted pumpkin orange eyes on a face with a slack-jaw expression, halted mid stride in the middle of the path. A classic thousand yard stare.<br />
<br />
Daniel hesitated, The Scribe&#39;s sudden appearance and how he was acting was very promising, but the scribe could be aware of what is being typed and simultaneously immune to other people&#39;s writings...  No matter, this moment will come sooner or later and if everything I wrote is come to pass, leaving him grief-stricken and longing for a new life is just cruel, even if he was a jerk.<br />
<br />
Daniel approached The scribe and stood before him for a second before Marvin&#39;s eyes focused. &quot;You&quot; The Scribe said, seeming surprised.<br />
<br />
Daniel hadn&#39;t actually given much thought as to how to proceed once the meeting takes place, he was more focused on wording things right while trying to set up this meeting in just the right way. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have been getting very threatening to try to get your iPad back...&quot; Daniel mentioned, almost offhandedly. &quot;This was the only way I could think to meet with you.&quot; Daniel was very careful to not commit to giving it back or keeping it, but wanted to know where The Scribe stood in wanting it back.<br />
<br />
&quot;The most recent in a series of poor choices, I fear...&quot; The Scribe looked pained as he continued, &quot;I suspect this is what the all-seer was alluding to, in her own cryptic way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel was completely at a loss to the meaning of that last statement so he just asked, &quot;What do we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Scribe smiled, not a sinister smile, but the weary smile of a man who has a long road ahead but knows he will find comfort soon. &quot;Let&#39;s talk.&quot; he said, motioning to the bench.<br />
<br />
As they began walking Marvin said, &quot;I saw what you wrote and am not immune to it but I do have my safeguards, which you completely circumvented...&quot; At this Marvin chuckled... &quot;over the centuries, hundreds have destroyed themselves trying to take my power. Any who destroy or disable The Scribe become The Scribe and any who become The Scribe lose their prior knowledge but gain the former Scribe&#39;s prior knowledge. I was turned to stone once, and salt, afflicted with several diseases, had about 70 instant deaths. I have been compelled to drown myself, i walked off a cliff and a bridge, and a few times I was made to never exist. That of course introduces paradox, and it is so much easier for Time to undo a 15-70 years rather than undoing my centuries and all the impacts I have had, so they end up not existing, though I end up remembering two practically identical histories for however long they were alive...&quot; <br />
<br />
Reaching the bench they sat down... &quot;So I would wake up, in a sense, holding my implement, in an unfamiliar room, and go on my way. This is why I was provoking you. If you wrote me a new life, or made it so I could never perform my function as the scribe again, you would gain all my memories losing yourself, and I would continue on my way. You made it so I COULD perform my functions, I just don&#39;t want to do it any more.&quot; There it is, Daniel thought, he wishes to relinquish his power.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could have and would have been able to fight off your modifications to my thoughts and desires but you even acknowledged my awareness of the changes and specifically solidified my resolve against remaining The Scribe. So I need to take down my safeguards before you take over, otherwise you will become me and my retirement plan goes kaput. I will also need to fill you in on all the details required to perform the duties that come with being The Scribe&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what? Duties?&quot; Daniel didn&#39;t want to imagine the responsibility that came with so much power. He had imagined his life being a big vacation where he could enjoy existence and possibly make people&#39;s lives better.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You didn&#39;t think your life would just become one big vacation did you? Something with this much power will be plucked from this universe the instant your guard is dropped. Though, being The Scribe comes with an amazing benefits package, lots of perks.&quot; Marvin chucked to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have the device with you? If so you should probably transfer my safeguards to you before the implement considers my prolonged mental state, a disability.&quot;<br />
<br />
With the guidance of Marvin, Daniel wrote, &quot;Any protections, powers, or inherent abilities that this implement is bestowing upon or has bestowed upon The Scribe, are now bestowed upon Daniel Stephens instead as well as the knowledge of how they work.&quot;<br />
<br />
The smartphone vibrated for 5 seconds straight, then flashed, DANIEL STEPHENS IS NOW THE SCRIBE. Daniel felt light headed for a moment as Marvin immediately fell asleep and slumped over, resting on him in the middle of Central Park.<br />
<br />
Daniel knew that so long as he was The Scribe he would never feel tired, need to sleep, eat, or use the bathroom for that matter, though he could do so if he wished. Removing that from Marvin is what made him pass out. The protections that were put into place over the centuries, collectively come with the responsibility and title of The Scribe. By taking the protections, rather than the title, he didn&#39;t activate the memory wipe.<br />
<br />
Staring at Marvin, Daniel suddenly had a sense of his personality and what Marvin wished was different about himself, the longer he stared the more information he got until Daniel could almost hear Marvin&#39;s voice confiding and explaining his hopes and fears, dreams and desires.<br />
<br />
Daniels gaze shifted to a man jogging by. His name was Aaron Grand and he was sort of a stuck up jerk. He knew he was handsome and had no reservations about putting his penis in whatever orifice would accept it. He has never stayed faithful for more than a week and secretly hates who he is as a person. Though he has a well paying job he is behind on his child support. If he could, he would become a rabbit, and just fuck until he dies. It would be so much less complicated.<br />
<br />
Daniel turned away, shocked, as Aaron rounded another bend going out of sight. This will take some getting used to.  <br />
<br />
Daniel could feel a humming throughout his being, The universe needed to be modified soon, or else something bad would happen. Daniel didn&#39;t understand it but knew it was one of his new powers. It had been several hours since the phone turned off and Daniel felt more confident as the rightful owner of the implement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron Grand, is a 1 year old, common rabbit, living in Central Park.&quot;<br />
<br />
The humming immediately reduced in intensity, though didn&#39;t drop completely. He needed to ask Marvin some questions about his new job before releasing him to a new life. Ah yes, &quot;Gregory Nettermann is a lean 22 year old student at the Columbia University, who is a competent, well paid and respected employee at the company he’s currently employed at. His genetics, healthy eating habits, and activity level will keep him in good health and good shape for decades to come. &quot;<br />
<br />
The humming reduced further, Daniel could tell he was doing something that needed to be done, though all he inherently knew about the humming was something about the likelihood of planet earth being targeted, by what or whom would have to wait until Marvin felt up to speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hugo has grown to be a scrawny man ever since he started at Columbia University, leaving no trace of him former athletic body. Hugo had been in the habit of working out to relieve stress but has over trained his body constantly, leading his muscles to deteriorate away, His body will never again maintain any significant muscle mass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marvin Blake is awake and refreshed after his nap.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marvin&#39;s eyes fluttered open, he stretched and groaned, noticed Daniel and smiled. &quot;Forgot that that would happen but I do feel great, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome. The implement said I am now The Scribe but I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m supposed to do. I felt a warning signal and made a few small changes while you were sleeping. Id really appreciate you explaining how this is supposed to work.&quot;</p>
