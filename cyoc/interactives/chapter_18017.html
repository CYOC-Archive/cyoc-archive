<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun did not rise yet when Mandy woke up that Saturday. She quietly walked down the hall and into Jake’s room. She wanted to play with his computer while he was sleeping. She was not allow normally, but with her brother and her parents asleep Mandy knew she could get away with it. She was the top in her class when it came to computers and very good at games they played on the school’s computer. <br />
<br />
After turning it on she moved the mouse over to the start button then clicked and moved it up slowly. It was on Documents she saw an icon of a cartoon person and the word Game. <br />
<br />
She clicks on it and the game loaded up. <br />
<br />
She giggled when she saw a little girl character sitting at a computer as she was. She selected the bed and clicks the 2nd mouse button. Thinking this was kind of doll house game. She clicked on baby crib. Out of the corner eye she saw her brother’s bed disappear and crib replaced it. She turned to look with great amusement. She smiled then change his dresser to the baby’s changing table. She giggled loudly as she saw his dresser gone and now replaces with a changing table with slack of diapers on it. <br />
<br />
She saw a funny shape square with Jake’s name in the largest box. She clicks on it to see two boy characters sleeping on the floor. Little ‘zzzz’ came from their head as they slept. She clicks on her brother and selected age. Mandy smiled when she saw the word baby by set of numbers she knew. She likes the number 5# and selected 5th month old baby with the aware on. The boy on the computer changed into baby wearing a diaper. <br />
<br />
Mandy swung her legs a bit faster as she saw this. ‘Friend 1.' That had to be Timmy she thought. She then selects to make him the same age as her then she hit ‘unaware’ not really sure that would do. The boys on the screen look the same and only his clothes changed to more childlike wear. Hearing her mother stir in the room middle of the hall. Mandy found the exit key and click on it. She knew the words save very well and hit the Y key and game exited out. <br />
<br />
She turned off the computer since she did not know how to shut it down as her brother and parents did. She quietly slipped down the stairs and saw to her delight to find a 5-year-old Timmy sleeping next to her new 5-month baby brother on the living room floor. <br />
<br />
Timmy woke to see his friend Mandy giggling at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is so funny?&quot; He asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot; She said then swaying her body from side to side. <br />
<br />
&quot;How did your little brother get out of his crib?&quot; Timmy asked when saw the baby sleeping next to him. <br />
<br />
She giggled more at this question. <br />
<br />
Timmy figured that Mandys somehow help him and place him there as some kind of joke. <br />
<br />
&quot;What to watch some cartoons?&quot; Timmy asked as he picks up the remote. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Mandy said then sitting next to Timmy on the sofa. Mandy kept looking down at her brother and wondering when he was going to wake up. <br />
<br />
Jake felt a little strange as he woke up. He could feel that this chest was bare and knew there was something wrong when he opened his eyes. Everything in the room was huge and seems to be a lot taller. <br />
<br />
Trying to get up Jake found he could not stand anymore much less walk. He heard the sound of a plastic diaper as he landed on his butt. He looks down at his body to see he was small and pudgy. <br />
<br />
Looking at Timmy he saw he lost a year or two. <br />
<br />
&quot;Goo GA DA&quot; Jake said trying to ask what happen. He was making baby babble when he tries to speak. Mandys giggle when she heard him say this. <br />
<br />
Unable to walk to Timmy. Jake crawled over to Timmy and tug on his pj pants to get his attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;What does your little brother want Mandy?&quot; Timmy asked looking puzzle on why the baby was bothering him. <br />
<br />
Using the sofa for support Jake managed to stand by holding one hand against it. Then trying to speak. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boo DA Goo&quot; Jake said trying to say ‘What is wrong with you?’ <br />
<br />
&quot;Awww&quot; Mandy said. &quot;He trying to say Daddy. Maybe he wants to play house.&quot; Mandy said with a smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo&quot; Jake said then patted to his diaper. Asking with his hand; ‘Why are I in this diaper?’ At least he could say that word right. He thought to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know what’s wrong.&quot; Mandy said then sliding off the sofa to Jake’s level. <br />
<br />
&quot;He needs a new diaper. Go upstairs and get one please Timmy&quot; Mandy said in her sweet voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;OK.&quot; Timmy said then running up the stairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Waaaait&quot; Jake’s try to say before his friend left. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t worry big brother I change you.&quot; Mandy said with a giggle. <br />
<br />
Shock at her words. Jake stare at her for second. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gaaa&quot; He said trying to say ‘you?’. <br />
<br />
Mandy giggled more as she heard her brother make such cute sounds. Then she took him under the arm pits and forces him down on his back. She put her fingers on the sides of diaper and untapped in seconds. She grabs both of his legs and lifted him up as she took his diaper off as she practiced on her dolls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your wee-wee looks funny&quot; Mandy giggle as she saw the much smaller part of Jake. Then she tickled his belly and sides while holding onto his legs with one hand. This force Jake to giggle a bit as her small fingers touched his sensitive skin. <br />
<br />
Timmy came back and stares in wonder at the small baby. He did not have any little brothers so he never saw a pee-pee so much smaller than his own. Jake felt as this was his worst nightmare came to life. His sister and best friend were just staring at him while he was so naked and helpless. <br />
<br />
&quot;Diaper?&quot; Mandy asked Timmy. <br />
<br />
Handing the diaper to her Timmy watch as she diapers her little brother. She was quite good. Half her dolls were diaper nearly all the time. <br />
<br />
&quot;There. Is my baby all con fee wafee?&quot; Mandy asked Jake as she allows him to move again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bee ba goo&quot; Jake said trying to asked Mandy to change him back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your welcome.&quot; Mandy said with a giggle. <br />
<br />
Jake gave up on trying to talk. Maybe if he played along he have a chance. Mandy still knew he was not really a baby. Jake spends all morning in Mandy’s lap as they watch cartoon after cartoon. Until his mother come in form upstairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mandy!, how many times must I tell you not to help your brother out of his crib?&quot; She said when she found him in her lap. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorwee&quot; Mandy said sweetly. <br />
<br />
&quot;It’s OK. Just give him to me.&quot; She reaching down and picking up Jake. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on you two breakfast time.&quot; She said looking at Mandy and Timmy. <br />
<br />
Jake’s mothers carry him into the kitchen as she pulled out an old high chair that was once mine when I really was a baby. She kept it around just in case one of my little cousins came for a visit. After she buckles him in she started cooking. Sweet smells of pancakes were in the air. <br />
<br />
Mmmmm Jake thought with smile. Mom’s pancakes were always good. He could taste one with butter on it right now in his mind. <br />
<br />
She then sat only two plates down for Timmy and Mandy with pancakes and blueberries on the dish. Wondering where his was Jake look at his mother. He heard a sound of Jar being popped as she opened it. It was a jar of Bananas baby food for him. <br />
<br />
Jake was very unhappy when his mother started to spoon feed him. He really wanted anything else to eat then baby food. Jake ate it anyway till he felt his stomach was going to burst. Now he was very thirsty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Such a good boy you are.&quot; His mother commented when the jar was empty. Jake felt terrible at that point. There was pressure in his belly he could not understand. It was getting more and more unbearable. <br />
<br />
Thinking he was going to mess his diapers. Jake started to cry a bit then held his stomach. <br />
<br />
&quot;There, there.&quot; His mother said as she unbuckled him and started to pat his back side. <br />
<br />
Loud burp came out after a few pats on the back. <br />
<br />
Jake felt so good he almost laughs. It felt as he was going to explode. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mandy, take your friend to go play.&quot; She said while she grabs a small towel from rack over the sink. <br />
<br />
As soon they left it became clear on why she sent them away. She lifted up her shirt and started to breast feed me. Jake thought with some horror. Unable to fight her as she guided his mouth to her nipple. Jake was glad when she places the towel over him to hide her body. <br />
<br />
Jake only good memory of that moment was when she started to sing. Her voice was soothing and Jake was getting very sleepy now as he sucks away. He did not know how long his body went on its accord, but he fell asleep soon after her singing. <br />
<br />
It was a dream Jake said to himself as he lay in his warm bed starting to wake up. He dreamt he got a game that could change the world around him. When Jake opens his eyes he saw wooden bars. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo&quot; he cried in a whisper to himself. He was not dreaming after all. It was all real after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jakey&quot; Mandy said as she enters the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have a good nap?&quot; She asks. Mandys look as she was done with own nap. Her hair was mess up and her clothes were all wrinkle up. <br />
<br />
Jake only nods his head in reply to say ‘yes.' Better to play along then to get fussy with her. He thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy says you too little for me to play with.&quot; Mandy said now booting the computer in the room back up. <br />
<br />
&quot;So I am going to make you bigger so we can play.&quot; Mandy said as she clicks on the icon to the game. <br />
<br />
Jake only sat up and claps his hands to this news. Then made sounds of delight to show he agreed with Mandy.</p>
