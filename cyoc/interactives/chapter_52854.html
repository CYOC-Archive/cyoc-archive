<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I think I’ll be Tarzan,&quot; Andy said, &quot;Might as well be creative.&quot; The <br />
amulet on his chest glowed brightly for several seconds, then <br />
subsided.<br />
*****************<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mitch was sitting in his office reviewing the last bit of <br />
his presentation.  Everything looks good, he thought to himself.  He <br />
hit the print button on the computer, satisfied that the presentation <br />
was going to be a smash.  When he got up out of his chair, however, a <br />
sharp pain shot through his legs.  It almost felt like his legs <br />
weren’t bending right, and he felt the need to squat.  His walking was <br />
becoming more unsteadily, so he decided to change directions from the <br />
printer to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
He found the bathroom unoccupied, and hobbled over best he could <br />
towards the full-length mirror built into the wall.  He allowed his <br />
body to relax and found his legs bent at what seemed like an <br />
impossibly uncomfortable angle.  It almost reminded him of how a frog <br />
would sit.  Meanwhile his balance was maintained by his knuckles, <br />
which were resting comfortably on the ground like a gorilla.  Mitch <br />
pulled himself up to his full standing height, but he felt widely <br />
unstable.  It was as if he couldn’t remember how to walk well without <br />
balancing on his knuckles.  Why would I want to walk on two legs <br />
anyways? Mitch thought to himself.  Using my knuckles to stable myself <br />
is much more comfortable, not to mention that it allows climbing <br />
through the trees so much easier.<br />
<br />
Wait, climbing through trees?  Mitch had no idea where that thought <br />
had come from.  He was terrified of heights.  Yet he couldn’t shake <br />
the fact that he felt comfortable up high, soaring through vines from <br />
tree to tree in the jungle.  He seemed to be unsure of his past, as if <br />
another set of memories were ingraining themselves in his mind.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t allowed to dwell on the thoughts much longer, as a sharp <br />
pain shot out from his feet.  His shoes felt ridiculously tight, as if <br />
they had shrunk.  He sat down and struggled to pull his shoes off.  <br />
They had definitely grown tighter, and his feet felt like they were <br />
going to explode out of the shoes at any moment.  He finally was able <br />
to pull the shoes off and massage his feet through his socks.  Why am <br />
I wearing socks?  He thought.  Bare feet make much more sense for <br />
gripping branches.  He pulled the socks off and was amazed to see how <br />
big his feet had grown.  They had to be at least three sizes larger <br />
than they were that morning when he got out of bed.  Nevertheless, it <br />
felt so much more comfortable to be walking around barefoot, they way <br />
he always had in the past.<br />
<br />
In fact, the more he thought about it, the more he realized he was <br />
wearing a lot of unnecessary clothes.  What is all this I’m wearing?  <br />
He though to himself.  His clothes were starting to feel tighter <br />
anyways.  He pulled off his jacket and tossed it on the ground.  He <br />
was unable from taking off his shirt because of some piece of fabric <br />
hanging down from his neck.  Part of him was saying that this was <br />
supposed to be there, but a growing voice in his mind had no idea what <br />
it was.  His shirt was pulled tight across his chest, and the colorful <br />
piece of fabric hanging down was tight around his throat.  He pulled <br />
tighter on the fabric, but it seemed to tighten instead of loosening.  <br />
The last bit of old Mitch that was almost completely being overtaken <br />
was able to guide the hands to the knot at the top of the tie and <br />
loosen it to where he could slide it off over his head.<br />
<br />
Mitch threw the fabric away in anger, his shirt slightly ripping from <br />
his huge muscles pushing out through his arms.  In a burst of <br />
strength, Mitch ripped the shirt open, letting it fall and revealing <br />
his large muscular arms and toned abs.  He rested back down on his <br />
knuckles, feeling much more comfortable.  He had been so focused on <br />
his chest that he hadn’t even realized that his hair now hung long and <br />
loose down to his shoulder blades, and it looked like it hadn’t been <br />
washed in a while.<br />
<br />
The only clothing he was still wearing were his pants and briefs.  His <br />
growing pelvis was putting considerable strain on his waist, and he <br />
struggled to release the pants.  There was some kind of leather strap <br />
wrapped around his waist, and after pulling at it hard enough, it <br />
finally loosened enough that he could rip the top of the pants open.  <br />
The button on the top flew across the bathroom and hit the wall, and <br />
the zipper pulled down immediately to make room for Mitch’s growing <br />
crotch.  Phew!  That feels so better.  He pulled the pants off his <br />
muscled legs, leaving himself only in his white briefs.<br />
<br />
His briefs were straining to hold his huge manhood.  Mitch looked down <br />
and watched as the white fabric grew in the crotch area, shaping <br />
itself to mold around his member.  The fabric changed from <br />
uncomfortable cotton to the soft feeling of leather that he had worn <br />
for years.  The back of the briefs bunched up into his but, turning <br />
into a soft leather strap wresting comfortably in between his butt <br />
cheeks.  The leather itself grew worn and a strong but comfortable <br />
scent struck Mitch in his nostrils.  His white briefs had now become a <br />
well-worn leather thong.  To complete the only piece of clothing that <br />
he was wearing, two leather flaps pulled out in the front and back of <br />
the thong, covering his butt and his pouch, completing his new leather <br />
loincloth.<br />
<br />
He looked at himself in the mirror.  He body was filled with muscle, <br />
his back bent so that he could walk comfortably on his knuckles.  His <br />
long hair hung down in front of his face, now hardened with a lifetime <br />
of jungle living.  His leather loincloth did little to hide his <br />
massive endowment.  “Me Tarzan.  Me look good,” he felt himself <br />
saying.  He shook his head.  That wasn’t right.  He tried to talk <br />
again.  “Me king of the jungle.  Me rule over apes.”  The voice of <br />
Tarzan had completely taken over Mitch’s mind, the old Mitch locked <br />
away in some back corner of his memories.<br />
<br />
Mitch (now Tarzan) felt a compelling urge to cry out and exclaim <br />
himself as king of the apes.  He pounded his hands against his checks <br />
and cried out his massive jungle cry at the top of his lungs.</p>
