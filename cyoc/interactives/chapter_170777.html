<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max decided against any more additions to his pony’s body. He could easily make such things later if he would like to do so. That was why Tony were given counteragent to the sleeping drugs he had been injected at the start. Then he was placed in his stall, hooked in by his harness so he was already mostly standing. Then everyone but Max left the waking pony alone. Max himself watched Tony waking up from an observation point which Tony couldn´t see into.<br />
<br />
When Tony woke up slowly and groggily, at first, he was completely disorientated. When the grogginess faded, he registered his hanging position, and the pressure it put on his chest and stomach. Trying to get his feet placed under him to lift up his torso he yelled in discomfort. Or at least, he would have normally. Instead of a yell, however, a loud neighing left his body. He had quickly lifted his feet onto his toes to ease the low pain the uncomfortable placing gave him seconds before.<br />
<br />
The other thing he had noticed when he tried to scream in pain, next to the neighing, was that he hadn´t been able to open his mouth to scream at all. Focusing his eyes to look straight forward, he could see something poking out of his mouth at the sides. But as much as he tried, he couldn´t open his mouth, not a single millimeter. Next, he tried to reach up with his hands to feel around his mouth, only he couldn´t bend his arms up that way, and his fingers didn´t move at all. <br />
<br />
Tony´s horror grew only bigger as when he looked down, he noticed his arms weren´t really arms anymore, and his hands had been bent into fists and been fixated that way somehow. Just like his mouth, his fingers didn´t bulge in any way. He again neighed in frustration and anger, but also panic what the hell had happened to him.<br />
<br />
A short while later, while Tony was still neighing with all that emotions running through him, Max left his observation point to greet his new pony. “How is my brave little pony doing?” he said before stroking the left side of Tony´s head gently.<br />
<br />
Tony wanted to scream at his brother for what he had done, only neighing loudly again. While his mind wanted him to recoil at Max hand stroking him, his body betrayed him even more, as he leaned into it instead.<br />
<br />
“You like that, don´t you? And your short brown fur is so soft to stroke as well. Now, I guess you are hungry after all your body went through, right?” Max said as he moved behind Tony.<br />
<br />
Tony wanted to protest against the changes made to him, wanted to point out he couldn´t open his mouth to eat, but again only neighs left his body. But it seemed Max understood him, or at least could think of what his problem was right now. “Don´t worry, my little pony, you won´t need your mouth to eat. Or at least, you won´t need to open it. Not that you could if your life would depend on it, it´s glued shut forever after all.” <br />
<br />
Tony looked horrified at Max as he stepped back in front of him, grinning. Then Max connected some kind of tube to the side of the thing poking out of his mouth. “You know, this gag is a true genius idea. It works as both a speaker for your voice, as well as a way to feed you. And have you noticed? You won´t speak ever again. Even if you were able to open your mouth, all you could do would be neighing like you do the whole time. Your brain can´t form any speech anymore, and your voice-box doesn´t permit it neither. So, now eat up.”<br />
<br />
Tony could do nothing as Max started the feeding, and quickly the liquid food was flowing onto Tony´s tongue. It took only a second or two for Tony to recognize the taste as cum, having tasted his own once and found it tasted disgusting. He again tried to recoil, shaking his head to get the tube out, but it held firm. “What´s the matter? Don´t like your new food? That would be a shame, as it is all you will ever taste again. It has everything you will need to life in it, too.” Max explained, faking pity for Tony´s situation. He moved back to stroking Tony´s head and mane while Tony was forced to drink his cum-tasting food for ten minutes.<br />
<br />
When Max turned the feeder off and removed the tube, Tony felt at least a bit of relief, but as he thought about what Max had said, it was short-lived. If he never got anything other to taste, it would be hell for him. He hadn´t even noticed that he had placed his front hooves down like he had his feet before. But it was also easing the pressure on his body more to stand this way.<br />
<br />
Max explained further: “Oh, I see you already stand like you are supposed to do. That´s a good improvement already. You have noticed placing your feet down felt uncomfortable? Your new horseshoes are designed to keep you on your toes and knuckles. I would suggest not to lower onto the palms of your hands, that would be as uncomfortable as putting your heels down. In fact, your palms are like the heels of your frontlegs now, even the same length as your hindlegs. We also corrected your spine, to keep my cute little pony on all his four hooves. And it fits good to the saddle I got for you as well. Easily placed on your harness, which by the way is permanently sewn into your skin as well. Now, any other needs you have right now?” And with that he again grinned widely at Tony.<br />
<br />
Tony was in shock right now. What had they done to his body? He was forced to walk on all fours now, next to being mutilated with a sewn in harness. When he didn´t respond to Max question, Max petted his head again before leaving him alone to come to terms with his predicament.<br />
<br />
After some time, he noticed that the left side of his box wasn´t made from wood, but was a mirror instead. As much as it pained him to see himself in this degrading state, Tony turned towards it to muster his body more. While Max had said it, he had missed that his hair was now brown. And it seemed do go down his neck to. He could see his closed mouth, had problems seeing his ears until he noticed them being pressed flat to his head and hidden by the short fur.<br />
<br />
Tony´s gaze went further, looking at the sewn in harness covering his body, crossing over his torso, exactly were his nipples have been. As he looked closer, he noticed that there was some metal underneath the harness, pressing cold onto his nipples in fact. They had pierced him, he thought in horror.<br />
<br />
He watched his arms, now forelegs, as he stood there on his balled hands, unable to use them in any other way. A glance farther back showed the same predicament applied to his feet. He was even able to spot the horseshoes sticking to them. As he moved his gaze back up, he saw the pigtail like hair sticking above his ass. He had a tail as well.<br />
<br />
When his gaze finally landed on his crotch, he neighed in shock. They had really neutered him. But as he concentrated, he could still feel his parts, just not see them. What had they done? In his anger and confusion, he neighed some more.<br />
<br />
That brought Max back, who had observed his pony the whole time, still enjoying seeing the horror and shock of his once big brother. Knowing were his gaze had been last, Max grinned. That screamed for him teasing his pony a bit more. So, before he returned to Tony´s side, he stripped naked. The stall was closed right now, and Max had locked the door, so they would not be disturbed.<br />
<br />
When Tony saw Max come back in naked, he was shocked again. Not by the fact Max was naked, but more so for reacting to him. He wasn´t gay, so why was he turned on by his brother, off all people? But a simple look had been enough for him to grew erect, or better, his body trying to. And he felt a sharp pain hit his full prostate, as his cock poked into it. With tears forming in his eyes, he noted were his cock was right now.<br />
<br />
Seeing the tears, Max laughed at him. “What, never seen some naked guy? Or is it your cock that caused you pain? You see, instead of removing it, like father wanted, we have hidden it from the outside world. While your balls are simply pushed under the skin of your crotch, your cock is running along your leg pointing at your bladder. Need some release, do you?”<br />
<br />
Tony wanted to protest against Max, scream at him for being cruel, but he neighed in need. But when he tried to piss, nothing happened. Pressing for over two minutes, not a single bit of relieve was given. “Oh sorry” Max said waiting in front of him, “I forgot you can´t empty your bladder without permission anymore. Let me help you with that.”<br />
<br />
Tony watched as Max moved to a small pad on the wall, recognizing a remote. And when Max pushed one button, it was as if heavens door opened and he could finally release the pressure of his bladder. He felt it move towards its exit, and neighed surprised as it shot out his ass. “They have connected my cock to my ass?” Tony thought as he released more and more liquid out of it.<br />
<br />
Max turned the remote of when Tony´s amount of piss decreased mostly, grinning at him. He took the liberty to jerk off right there while his pony watched, and Tony already felt his cock grew erect even more, but with his connection cut, the cum was now dammed in his cock. “I´m not gay, hell, why does he turn me on that way. Get your head clear, Tony.”<br />
<br />
After Max shot his load, he grinned at Tony again. “Well, that´s one load that wasn´t needed for your food, what a pity. Well, as you are now satisfied, at least I think you are, I will leave you alone again. Good night, pony boy. Tomorrow we will start your training.” He grinned at Tony´s shocked face, before returning to his clothes, put them back on, and left. He enjoyed that Tony would think the food he got was made with real cum, at least until he would tell him that was a joke. If he would do so anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Tony just stood there, shocked by both Max statement about his food, as well as his arousal for his brother, even if he still wasn´t gay. And the need to release his dammed up cum, which wouldn´t happen anytime soon. It took him hours to fall asleep.</p>
