<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felicity sighed, parking her car in front of Normal HQ. With Void Dandelions arrival Mokomi immediately ordered all members of the Dark Garden to train. Felicity, of course, protested however that was quickly thrown out by the Boss himself. The Normal were planning something and the Dark Garden were going to be needed.<br />
<br />
Trudging towards the training room, Felicity noticed Caitlin and May approaching from opposite directions. Caitlin, of course, was dressed in the trendiest outfits in Mandy approved colors. Felicity could see the girl idly texting on her phone before turning her eyes up to face Felicity. &quot;Oh,&quot; she stated snidly. &quot;You&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I&#39;m here,&quot; Felicity exclaimed angrily. &quot;I&#39;m the leader of the Dark Garden.&quot; Caitlin simply rolled her eyes, letting out an exasperated sigh before entering the training room. Felicity simply grit her teeth, she wasn&#39;t sure just how much longer she could deal with Caitlins attitude. &quot;Um excuse me,&quot; a small voice whispered. Felicity spun, ready to yell before pausing. <br />
<br />
May stood before her, the 12 year old dressed in uniform, a grey skirt with pleated shirt. The girl nervously pulling on her braided ebony hair as she seemingly tried to will herself to make eye contact. &quot;Ugh what is May,&quot; Felicity groaned. May fidgeted, Felicity raising an eyebrow as she studied the girl. Part of her was annoyed by the preteens presence yet another part couldn&#39;t help feeling sorry for her. Maybe Caitlin was right, maybe she had been hanging out with Winery too much. &quot;Umm do you know what we&#39;re doing today,&quot; May asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No idea,&quot; Felicity shrugged. &quot;Probably some team building exercise.&quot; May simply nodded, shuffling inside. Felicity still couldn&#39;t figure out what Mokomi was thinking bringing some kid into the Dark Garden. Following behind May, Felicity studied the room carefully. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, the room was about 30 feet wide, completely white walls with a glass window that was used as an observation area. Felicity had been in rooms like this before. It was the typical Normal training room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Members of the Dark Garden,&quot; a voice proclaimed from a loud speaker. Felicity glanced up, recognizing the Boss’s voice. That the Boss was here told Felicity of the seriousness of this training session. &quot;Our enemies are growing in strength. Therefore, we too must grow in strength. To do this you will need to work together, increase your strength so that none can stand in your way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity looked to Caitlin and May. This was to be combat training. As the girls transformed, Felicity paid close attention to May. The preteens body glowed with a brilliant light, her height increasing. As it faded, Felicity now beheld Void Dandelion, her ebony hair flowing freely, the girl having aged four years becoming sixteen. A maniacal grin upon her once shy face as a witch like laugh came from her mouth. &quot;We are the Dark Garden,&quot; she yelled, black flames that swirled like snakes covering her arms. &quot;None dare stand against us!&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity couldn&#39;t help but shudder at Dandelions proclamation. It struck her as odd how different May and Dandelion were. May seemed to be afraid of her own shadow where Dandelion craved violence the way an addict craves a fix. Did May have a split personality? Were her powers somehow tapping into a buried psychosis within the girl? That seemed to be the only logical explanation for the complete change in Dandelions personality.<br />
<br />
Felicity didn&#39;t have time to psychoanalysis May. A metal shutter now opened on the other side of the room, a series of robotic drones charging out. &quot;Ivy&#39;s training droids,&quot; Felicity smirked. She had faced these before, an advanced AI robot designed by the former Normal robotics expert. The droids were tough but Felicity knew how to beat them. Summoning Red Thorn, Felicity charged only for Caitlin to get in her way. &quot;What the fuck Orchid?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Caitlin sneered, useing her flail to now disable the droid Felicity attacked before leaping at another. &quot;Gotta move faster Rose,&quot; she smirked, the pretty black teen now twirling her flail wildly over her head. Caitlin though was careless, Felicity barely ducking out of the way as the spiked ball connected with Dandelion. Dandelion was sent soaring, crashing into the wall. &quot;Hey watch it,&quot; Dandelion exclaimed angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;You watch it twerp,&quot; Orchid snapped back. &quot;If you can&#39;t keep up then you should go back to daycare.&quot; Dandelion snarled, the girl now lunging at Orchid before releasing a powerful blast of black fire at Orchid. Now it was Orchid who was launched into the air, smashing into the opposite wall with a loud thud. &quot;What was that you were saying about daycare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity seethed watching as her supposed teammates began to argue with one another. So consumed in trading barbs, the pair failed to notice the approaching training droids. It was over before they could act, Orchid and Dandelion screaming in pain as they were tazed. &quot;Nice going,&quot; Orchid grumbled. &quot;Me,&quot; Dandelion exclaimed. &quot;You were the one that hit me first!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough both of you,&quot; Felicity yelled, the teen gritting her teeth as she glared at her teammates. &quot;None of this helps! We have to work together!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mandy says that you&#39;re clueless,&quot; Orchid replied. &quot;She says that&#39;s why you get led around by the nose by some freak.&quot; That was the breaking point for Felicity. Ever since Orchids arrival, the pretty black teen had done nothing but antagonize her; always questioning every word that came out of her mouth. It was time to show both Caitlin and May who was in charge.<br />
<br />
Slamming Red Thorn into the adjacent wall, Felicity marched towards Caitlin, grabbing her by the collar. &quot;I am sick of your BULLSHIT,&quot; she screamed, noticing the look of shock on Caitlins face. Summoning forth her enchanted Warhammer, Felicity now pressed it against Caitlins jaw. &quot;I&#39;m in charge here got it,&quot; she screamed. &quot;I call the shots! Not you, unless you want me to hit you with Red Thorn! Do you want me to hit you with this?&quot; Caitlin shook her head no, Felicity seeing the cocky teens eyes glaze with tears. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Felicity growled, releasing her grasp on Caitlin. &quot;And if I hear Mandy says one more time Caitlin I&#39;m going to close your jaw. PERMANENTLY!!&quot; Caitlin nodded meekly, falling in line as Felicity now glared at an obviously  bewildered Dandelion. &quot;What about you May? Anything to add?&quot; Dandelion shook her head slowly, her eyes wide as she meekly fell in behind Felicity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like Felicity is finally taking charge,&quot; the Boss stated as he and Mokomi gazed down at the members of the Dark Garden. &quot;Indeed it does chui,&quot; Mokomi replied, watching as the simulation began once more. &quot;Nightmare Rose is finally embracing her role as leader of the Dark Garden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it would seem,&quot; the Boss replied. &quot;However, I wonder if her loyalties lie with me or with you?&quot; Mokomi paused, the blue rabbits ears twitching as she gazed up at the Boss. &quot;Our interests align Boss chui,&quot; Mokomi stated. &quot;As do our loyalties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least for now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You doubt my words,&quot; Mokomi asked, the blue rabbit furrowing her brow. The Boss’s eyes narrowed under his hood, a slight glow emanating from within as he stared at the four earned rabbit. &quot;Evil can&#39;t trust evil Mokomi,&quot; he said softly. &quot;And while I may not be able to tell exactly what you are, I know evil and YOU my little blue friend are certainly evil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we appear to be at an impasse chui,&quot; Mokomi stated. &quot;I suppose our alliance will need to be built on faith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Faith that the other won&#39;t stab them in the back,&quot; the Boss added. Mokomi was silent, glaring at the Boss with her black eyes. &quot;So it would seem chui.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair now turned back to the Dark Garden, noting that under Felicity’s assertion of leadership, the Dark Garden was beginning to perform as a team. &quot;So do you think they can take out these Solar Guardians,&quot; the Boss asked. &quot;Possibly,&quot; Mokoi said softly. &quot;The Solar Guardians are quite formidable and they have a nasty habit of adding to their ranks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should do the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Finding those worthy of the Dark Garden is always difficult,&quot; Mokomi sighed. The Boss nodded, rubbing his chin as he thought. &quot;What about turning a Solar Guardian,&quot; he asked. &quot;Would adding someone who is or was  a part of that team make bringing into the Dark Garden?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly,&quot; Mokomi replied. &quot;But how do you intend to turn a Solar Guardian chui?&#39; The Boss chuckled, glancing out the window of the observation room as he watched the Dark Garden train. &quot;You let me worry about that. For now, let&#39;s just try to keep from betraying one another.&quot;</p>
