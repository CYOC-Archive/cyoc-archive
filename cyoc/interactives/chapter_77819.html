<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I heard Mike getting really excited and clapping his hands &quot;I bet your new... asset must feel really special. Especially now that you are able to appreciate the visual aspect of it as well! Ok, now... If I am to have you be my sex toy I have to fix your balance. Hmmm... How can I stop you from tipping over?&quot;<br />
<br />
I really didn't want to think about what Mike was to invent next. I was already enough of a freak. I could only imagine how I looked like; the last time I saw my body was when I still had arms and the two pairs of breasts sticking out from my chest blocked all the view anyway. The only thing I was sure about from below my chest level was my pussy. I knew it was there - I could feel it was slightly agape waiting for its emptiness to be filled. I knew that was going to happen soon whether I wanted it or not...  <br />
<br />
As if sensing what I was thinking about I heard Mike dragging something across the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me just move the mirror so you can see how pretty you are...&quot;<br />
<br />
I hear Mike finishing with the mirror and then his face entered my field of vision with his crooked teeth showing in a nasty smile. He looked me in the eye for a couple of seconds and then he softly kissed the nipple topping the breast on my face. I felt its mass wobble slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now brace yourself my dear Dawna, I'll put you upright. Try to not loose your balance for a couple of seconds! After I change you it will be much easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabbed me by my shoulders and pulled up. I closed my eyes. As I was regaining my vertical position I felt all my breasts pulling down my chest (and face) with the aid of gravity I'll come to hate. They not only pulled downwards, uncomfortably stretching the skin directly above them, but also slightly swayed to the sides like bulky pendulums.<br />
<br />
Mike's hands let go and I found that now I had to put effort into keeping balance myself. My eyes remained shut. I didn't want to face what I have become.<br />
<br />
&quot;Open your eyes my dear!&quot; I heard Mike's voice again. &quot;Behold your glory!&quot;<br />
<br />
Every part of me was trying to resist this crazy day progressing even further into madness. I shook my head trying to communicate 'no'. This time my face-boob not only jiggled but very clearly I felt it swaying. It must have been the mass Mark added to my tit to elevate the nipple. I could certainly feel it was slightly heavier, I wasn't surprised it had more inertia to go with the mass...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.&quot; Mike sounded quite angry now. &quot;In that case I need to take one more thing away from you. Can you feel the tingling in your eyes? That's the feeling of me getting rid of your eyelids. Don't worry, I made it so that your eyes are absolutely fine without them so that you can witness everything that I a ever going to do to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was trying to keep my eyes shut really hard but just like Mike said - suddenly I felt tingling in my eyelids. It appeared they started getting smaller and smaller until they could no longer cover my eyes. I was greeted again by the sight of the room in which I was to spent most of the next couple of months.<br />
<br />
The creature I saw in the mirror in from of me looked more like something I'd see in some bizarre sci-fi porn rather than with my own eyes.<br />
<br />
Her most obvious features were the things stuck to her chest. The two pairs of tits she possessed were big, but not obscenely huge. They didn't look their weight which I suddenly because painfully conscious of and they definitely were much smaller from what I imagined after I first saw them sticking out from my chest. In fact, I realized that if I was still a guy I wouldn't mind seeing even bigger breasts on that girl's frame... The upper pair was slightly smaller and attached quite high on her, my, chest. Their gravity-induced teardrop shape started right at the creature's collar bones and as my eyes slowly traced their shape downwards I realized that their bottoms were gently sitting on the tops of the lower pair. It seemed like the lower pair was actually attached right below the upper one; the teardrops it created emerged from the fold created by my upper breasts. The lower, bigger pair also sagged slightly (hence the teardrop shape) but not as much as one would expect from breasts of this size. They reached down to about an inch above my navel but most of their mass proudly jutted forward. I realized that was exactly the reason why I felt being pulled forward now. All four of the breast looked very soft and the only blemishes on the silky pale skin of my chest seemed to be some blue veins showing trough, indicating how much strain those growths put on my petite torso. Each boob was topped with a pencil-eraser sized nipple which pointed slightly up, surrounded by a tiny almost dime-sized areola. I knew that size was due to change. I once accidentally found Mikes porn stash and it contained a folder dedicated to puffy nipples of much more respectable size...<br />
<br />
The poor girl's lack of limbs emphasized the hourglass shape of her torso. No, not hourglass; her proportions weren't drastic. The curve of her proper hips going into her slim waist was smooth and gentle like the shape of a cello. Her tummy was flat as a board and she had just the right amount of fat. It's thin layer under her skin made her appear very soft and yet there wasn't enough of it to hide her hip-bones. Lower south there was a little mound covered in curly red hair. Even though Mike wished my pussy to be bigger it still wasn't visible from this point of view. I felt the emptiness right below me, I felt what I knew to be my labia pressed against the fabric of the bedsheets. At first it was like a fire but now it calmed down, still the feeling in my pussy was persistent like an unwanted itch waiting to be scratched. And somehow I knew that no matter how much I hated the idea, only Mike's cock could scratch it.<br />
<br />
Even though I did not have any legs I noticed that the girl in the mirror still had some upper buttocks. Actually it would be quite generous to call them buttocks - they were simply the globes of flesh which were my ass. In the mirror I could see that as I sat on the bed my juicy ass splashed out a little, giving me a wider base and definitely helping to keep balance.<br />
<br />
And then my eyes were drawn to my face which was the sight that terrified me most. In the place between my nose and jaw, instead of a mouth, a single tit stuck out proudly. It was much smaller than the ones on my chest, probably half their size, but because of its inconvenient placement it seemed much bigger, heavier and caused me much more discomfort. I turned my head to the side so I could see the damage better in the mirror. The boob apparently wasn't big and heavy enough to sag creating the teardrop shape so it just stuck out forward. Mind you, it shape was somehow in between of a cone and a hemisphere. If it was attached to a chest of a pretty lady instead I'd call it very nice. It was topped with the same nipple as my chest breasts, this one however pointed straight forward instead of slightly upwards. The rest of my face carried an expression of a permanent shock, mostly because of my big blue eyes having no choice but to stay as open as it was only possible. <br />
<br />
I gulped which felt very bizarre with the inside of my mouth being filled with solid flesh now. This all was just too much for me to bear. I wanted to cry and I wasn't surprised as my eyes started filling with tears.<br />
<br />
I couldn't focus on my misery for too long though because soon I was reminded of Mike's presence as he put his hand on my naked shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right my sweet Dawna... Now I will make sure you won't loose your balance as easily as you did before...&quot;</p>
