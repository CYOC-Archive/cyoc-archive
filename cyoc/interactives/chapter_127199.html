<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Note: Alright. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do. The chapters, &quot;Spellcasting&quot; by iWTBAT, &quot;Instant Army&quot; and &quot;Innocence - Part 3 - The Consequences to Curiosity and Desire&quot; by yours truly  (The 1) and &quot;Ilvir gets to talk to a Big League Monster the Lenuarian Hydra&quot; by an anonymous writer as well as other chapters all had really good ideas.<br />
<br />
So I decided to combine chapters in order to create brand new ones. <br />
<br />
This chapter takes elements from the chapters, &quot;Ilvir gets to talk to a Big League Monster the Lenuarian Hydra&quot;, &quot;Spellcasting&quot; and, &quot;Instant Army&quot; and a little bit from, &quot;The First Gate&quot;. Some ideas might be dropped and others might be added. You might notice some copied and pasted content.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spellcasting&quot; will be used as a base for this chapter.<br />
<br />
For the sake of reference, I thought I&#39;d include the original Author notes for all the chapters involved:<br />
<br />
Spellcasting:<br />
<br />
AUTHOR&#39;S NOTES: It&#39;s been some time since I&#39;ve written another one of these, but I&#39;m impressed with the vast improvement and a bit dismayed at how much I&#39;ve missed. Still, thank you &quot;ChronoSeth&quot; and &quot;The 1&quot; for greatly contributing to this, and I also thank the other writers (both anonymous and not) for adding their chapters to this.<br />
<br />
Instant Army:<br />
<br />
Note: Hey iWTBAT. Glad to see you&#39;re back. And I also enjoyed &quot;Spellcasting&quot;. Here are a few chapters I written myself mostly last night. I think I stayed up all night... Anyways, I have written my own chapters during my three day absence before &quot;Spellcasting&quot; was posted. But now that I read, &quot;Spellcasting&quot;, I plan on writing alternate versions of these chapters to take &quot;Spellcasting&quot; into account. But for the sake of reference, I&#39;d thought I post the original chapters anyways. They are not perfect, But hopefully, I can polish things out in the alternate versions.<br />
<br />
This chapter acknowledges the events of &quot;Ilvir gets to talk to a Big League Monster the Lenuarian Hydra&quot; by an anonymous writer. I really like the idea of The Lenuarian Hydra. In fact, I really like the character ideas from that anoymous writer. Keep up the good work. I hope it&#39;s okay if I borrow some ideas. But I need to build up the villains first. <br />
<br />
<br />
These notes are in order from when the original chapters were posted.<br />
<br />
But without further delay, please enjoy the chapter.<br />
<br />

<br />
There was one particular soul who was imprisoned here longer then any other soul present. It was a foreign soul that didn&#39;t get here by usual means. It has simply been watching from the shadows. Waiting for the right to time to make it&#39;s move. And right now, the powerful soul has it&#39;s eyes on Ilivir.<br />
<br />
It couldn&#39;t care less about Ilivir&#39;s desperate offer. It can easily tell that Ilivir doesn&#39;t has as much control over the body as he claims he has. No... it has bigger plans for Ilivir...<br />
<br />
&#39;Sisters. I am growing impatient. We just need to recruit one more soul. And then the curse will be broken...&#39; It said.<br />
<br />
&#39;Patience sister. This Ilivir character seems to be the most fitting candidate so far, but our prison has gotten a lot more crowded since that Isaac character arrived. Thanks to him, we have many sisters to chose from... Perhaps it&#39;s best to wait and see if another soul becomes a more worthy candidate then Ilivir...&#39; Another voice said.<br />
<br />
&#39;Why can&#39;t we convert all of them? We can&#39;t have too many...&#39; A more aggressive voice said.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hmm. Perhaps... But let us wait for our chance to strike unnoticed. The deity of Purity is more stronger then before... If we reawaken her, our time of imprisonment will be elongated.&#39;<br />
<br />
The time to make it&#39;s appearance isn&#39;t right. Ilivir hasn&#39;t fully convinced the strange soul that he is worthy yet... It will have to wait for now... The right time will be coming soon enough...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Almost all the souls were vying for some control over Isaac’s body as they gave their ideas on how they would escape. <br />
<br />
The basilisk suggested they turn the dust bunnies into statues, and the succubus suggested they mate with the bunnies<br />
<br />
The first idea was plausible. With the dust bunnies turned to stone, they won&#39;t be effected by the fire. And they also won&#39;t be able to move and attack the party. And unlike Isaac, Ilivir really has no intentions of storing the bunny statues in his body in order to restore them later. Oh sure, being stuck as a statue is a fate similar to death but in Ilivir&#39;s opinion, it&#39;s at least more painless then burning to death. So as long as all the bunnies sees his eyes, then the battle should be over quickly. But there is one problem. The basilisk already took over the body momentarily, and tried to turn Nat and the others into statues. Ilivir can&#39;t be sure that the basilisk is trust worthy. The seal of clarity doesn&#39;t guarantee that Ilivir has complete control over Isaac&#39;s body and once the basilisk  finds that out, he might try to exploit that and try to take the body for himself. Besides, Ilivir just plain doesn&#39;t like the basilisk&#39;s guts.<br />
<br />
Sabrina, the Succubus&#39;s suggestion sounds interesting. Ilivir had first hand experience on what it&#39;s like to be a gay slut as Isaac&#39;s spawn. He can&#39;t deny that he enjoyed the experience, but if he&#39;s going to have sexual intercourse, he rather be the one in control then some slutty succubus. He wants to feel the pleasure and to be the one who does the thrusting. He wants to be on the dominate end of the stick. In other words, If they do mate with the bunnies, Ilivir rather do it himself. But there is just one problem. The bunnies&#39;s glowing red eyes indicates that they have no intentions of willingly participating in sex. They look more hungry then horny. Ilivir might consider it if there were only two dust bunnies to occupy each of his cocks, but with as many as there are now, there is no guarantee that Ilivir won&#39;t get attacked by the other dust bunnies. It&#39;s not like he has hundreds of cocks to occupy all of them... at least not right now. He hates to say it, but sex is a foolish idea right now. The last thing Ilivir wants, is to have his dicks bitten off by mindless animals.<br />
<br />
The rest of the souls suggested fighting the rest of the bunnies, but their numbers would be too much for just the three of them. Even though Ilivir hasn&#39;t seen Nat&#39;s and the baby air dragon&#39;s full potential, the odd are still highly stacked against the party of three. Neither Isaac nor Dark Isaac had awoken from unconsciousness, so those two are out of the question. It seems escaping from them would be the wisest decision, and hearing that Sera, the witch, suggested that they give everyone wings to fly, Ilvir chose her to control Isaac’s body for some time. Ilivir rather not share control with the body with anyone, but he also rather stay alive.<br />
<br />
“You,” Ilvir called for Sera, “you take over. Give everyone wings, and make sure it makes them able to fly, especially us. This body weighs so much that I think we might need more than just wings…”<br />
<br />
“Yes!” Sera gleefully said before taking control. <br />
<br />
Ilivir was suddenly brought back to the black mental void of the Halo of Purity. He watched from a mental window as Sera makes alterations to Isaac&#39;s body to better fit her soul.<br />
<br />
Unlike the basilisk&#39;s changes, Sera&#39;s modifications weren&#39;t as extreme. Sera liked the humanoid dragon body, but she&#39;d rather be female. I took a lot of mental effort, but thanks to her experience in handling spells, she should have enough mental strength to handle Azaviel. It took a few moments of chanting and concentration but she soon sighed in relief as she felt her twin cocks invert themselves. She was able to successfully transform Azaviel into a female reptilian cunt. Sera couldn&#39;t help but pant a little as Azaviel&#39;s eternal cycle of orgasms made Sera&#39;s cunt constantly wet. She will just have to get used to constantly squirting. Luckily, the armor&#39;s metal pouch was still in place.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Ilivir watched in dismay as Sera changes the body&#39;s gender. But at the same time, he can&#39;t help but wonder what&#39;s it like to have sex as a female... But regardless, he is still a man at heart and he plans on transforming Azaviel back into a pair of cocks when he regains control in two hours... but that doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t test out his new female organ first. He can already imagine himself fingering his new cunt...<br />
<br />
Behind him, a shadow draws closer...<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
As a result of the change in hormones, Isaac&#39;s body&#39;s muscle tone slimmed down a little. It&#39;s still the same lizard man body, but it&#39;s a lot more leaner and more maneuverable. It looks slightly more feminine, but the huge and muscly body is still a little gender ambitious and anyone can still mistake the body as a male. Sera also made a point to transform the snake tongue into a regular tongue. She can&#39;t have snake hisses messing with her spells incantations. But she did made a point to make the tongue long enough to fill in the basilisk muzzle.<br />
<br />
She then prepared to cast a spell, which not only gives everyone (save for the air dragon) wings to fly but also gives Isaac’s body a few minutes of reduced gravity, boosting the power of his wings.<br />
<br />
“De Aeris Dea… de Volati Deus… te invoco commodi fugato!” was what she said before a gust of wind enveloped the three of them, temporarily protecting them from the dust bunnies who were vulnerable against strong winds. <br />
<br />
 The air dragon wings on Isaac&#39;s back expanded to twice it&#39;s size and it&#39;s wingspan grew large enough to carry Isaac&#39;s huge body.<br />
<br />
Nat&#39;s was suddenly world of pain as she felt a sharp pain coming from her back. She grabbed the stone steps and grated her teeth as she felt her flesh pulling itself out from her back. It&#39;s like someone pinched her back and started pulling at it. She screamed in pain as two membranes made of clouds grew from her back. Isaac would say they look like the wings of a fairy. The wings looks like they are made of water vapor. <br />
<br />
Only when the gusts stopped did Nat and Sera see they had wings, but Sera was much lighter as well as flight was no herculean feat for her now.<br />
<br />
Nat looked behind herself, and saw her new wings. She couldn&#39;t believe it. Yet, she could feel her new, beautiful wings. Nat wasn&#39;t sure what to thing about it. She likes her body the way it is, but for some strange reason, she doesn&#39;t mind the new wings. Yet, this also makes her angry. How dare she get&#39;s transformed against her will! They should have just asked first! She will find who did this and punish them!<br />
<br />
&#39;Think rationally sword bearer! We still don&#39;t know the cause of this transformation! These wings might be temporary. Personally, these wings of your are buetiful. Whoever is responsible for this transformation took care on making sure these wings match your body.&#39; Excaulbur reassured.<br />
<br />
But Nat quickly found someone to blame as she saw &quot;Ilivir&quot; smiling at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ilivir you bastard! What did you do to me?!&quot; Nat shouted in outrage.<br />
<br />
Sera couldn&#39;t fathom why the cloud girl was angry. “What got your clouds in a knot, toots? I just brought us a ticket out of here! Now fly! Fly to the top!” Sera told the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Toots?! How DARE you!!! First you alter my body without asking me and now you call me toots?! What&#39;s wrong with you Ilivir?!&quot; Nat demanded.<br />
<br />
But instead of arguing, the carefree witch flew on ahead of Nat.<br />
<br />
&#39;Nat, I think it&#39;s best to take advantage of our opportunity to escape for now. Can you use your wings?&#39; Excalibur asked.<br />
<br />
It took some quick experimenting, but Nat was able to figure it out pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
Nat nodded and flew upwards, fleeing the battle. The Excalibur was impressed by the spell, seeing that this was much more complex than the one-word spells Nat always cast.<br />
<br />
Sera kept flapping her wings as she tried to quicken her flight, hearing the rabid rabbits run up the spiraling staircase. The gravity reduction spell helped immensely, but god knows how long it would last. Sera only hoped that she would reach the top safely as Nat and Excalibur quickly out-flew her to the top. Within moments, they were watching from the ledge at the top.<br />
<br />
Despite how much Sera slimmed down the body, her weight was still slowing down her flight speed as she flew a little too close to the pillar. The remaining dust bunnies were quickly catching up.<br />
<br />
“Nat, cast a few fire spells at the staircase to impede the dust bunnies. If they’re that vulnerable to fire, then it should be no problem to use it as a barricade,” advised Excalibur.<br />
<br />
“But I might hit Ilvir! He’s close to the stairwell!” Nat hesitated.<br />
<br />
“Can’t you do any wind spells, then? You could make them fall apart since they’re just made of dust!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, but that would throw Ilvir off!”<br />
<br />
“Good lord,” Excalibur said. “Just try not to hit Ilvir. Those rabbits might reach us before he does!”<br />
<br />
Nat sighed before she began to focus on gathering the energy to cast one spell. It’d take longer if she cast more then one; one should just do it and give enough time for &quot;Ilvir&quot; to ascend.<br />
<br />
Luckily, the baby air dragon, or rather the 5 possessed dust bunnies has chosen that time to block the dust bunnies so Sera has time to escape. The five possessed dust bunnies merged back together to form a adult hybrid of a air dragon and a dust bunny. The former baby air dragon readied itself for battle as it stood on the stairway above the rampaging herd of bunnies. It was the only thing between it&#39;s friends and the herd of dust bunnies. The hybrid started doing a lot of damage by knocking dust bunnies off the stairway and into the sea of fire. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Chirp!&quot; Nat said to the adult sized dust bunny/air dragon hybrid.<br />
<br />
&#39;Why did you call it Chirp?&#39; Escalubur asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;I need to call it something. Chirp just seems to be a fitting name since it likes to chirp like a bird sometimes.&#39; The cloud girl explained.<br />
<br />
But before the party could let their guard down, they watched as flaming bunnies started climbing up the staircase from the ground. Despite that they were burning alive, the fire bunnies started running up the staircase to meet with their dust brethren. Reinforcements were coming.<br />
<br />
What should Nat do?! She needs to give the baby air dragon and &quot;Ilivir&quot; time to escape.<br />
<br />
In her frustration, Nat swung her fire sword at nothing. To her surprise, the fire magic in the sword channels out of it to form a air borne fire slash. The fire slash crashed down on the dust bunnies in front of the air dust dragon.<br />
<br />
The surprise fire slash projectile was the distraction Chirp needed to perform it&#39;s breath attack. The adult sized dragon breathed out a long stream of corrupt air and dust at the onslaught of dust dragons. Chirp was able to take out a large number of dust bunnies while reducing his size back into that of a baby air dragon. The baby retained some dust bunnies qualities. Chirp is still a hybrid between air dragon and dust bunny.<br />
<br />
But despite how widespread Chirp&#39;s attack was, more dust bunnies just keeps on coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of here you guys! I&#39;ll catch up with you later!&quot; Sera shouted. Slowly but steadily, she made her way up the pillar. <br />
<br />
As Nat watched, she was surprised to see &quot;Ilivir&quot; turning the dust bunnies into toads. Satisfied that &quot;Ilivir&quot; can take care of himself, she and Chirp regrouped and made there way through the door at the top of the staircase on top of the pillar and ceiling.</p>
