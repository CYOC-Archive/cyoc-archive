<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica started becoming really aware of her and her sisters size last year.  At 12 years old Jessica was extremely undersized and had not had any signs of puberty yet.  She stood 4&#39;5&quot; inches tall and weighed only 58 pounds.  The hard realization hit when Jessica went down the street to go get her sister Chelsea from her friends to come home for dinner.  As she walked down the street she saw her sister rollerblading towards her.  When they reached each other 8 year old Chelsea was only 1 inch shorter while on her blades.  &quot;I am as big as you Jess&quot;  said Chelsea.  Jess was embarrassed, she hated how small she was.  Their dad was 6&#39;5 and mom 5&#39;10, so Jess did not understand why she was so small.  When they got home Chelsea could not wait to show their mom how tall she was next to Jess.  Chelsea was 4&#39;1&quot; tall and weighed 50 pounds at 8 years old.  Their parents started to favor Chelsea as they wanted tall strong girls and Chelsea fit the mold an Jess didn&#39;t.  They signed Chelsea up for basketball, softball, volleyball, and soccer.  Jess got to play nothing.  Over the next few months the gap in height drew even closer and Chelsea was growing into quite an athletic body.  On the first day of school their mom had them in the living room for first day of school pics.  Chelsea was amazingly now only 1 inch shorter than her sister and clearly way stronger and athletic. Their mom was amazed at their closeness in height and called their father into the room.  She quickly grabbed a 3 inch heeled boot and but them on Chelsea.  Jess was not amused at all.  Chelsea looked over at Jess and grinned, she love being taller.  Their dad walked in &quot;Chelsea you are so amazing, taller than your 7th grade sister, wow&quot;  he said.  &quot;Only because of the shoes&quot;  yelled Jess really annoyed now.  The next weekend was Jess&#39;s 13th birthday.  They had people over to their home for the party and swimming.  They lived in Florida so it was a nice day for a swim.  Chelsea was in her bikini and her super athletic body made Jess cringe.  She even had the tiniest sign of breasts starting to develop.  Jess was really annoyed.  Everyone ooohed and aaahed at Chelsea while Jess stood there like a stick figure no one paid attention to, even on her birthday.  Chelsea was swimming and everyone was asking Jess over and over why she wasn&#39;t going in.  Finally Jess succumbed to the pressure and stripped down to her bathing suit.  Just then Chelsea exited the pool.  She stood next to Jess and they were dead even in height.  Chelsea was twice as thick and all muscle not fat.  Chelsea&#39;s skin was perfect and smooth and body perfect.  Jess had a little acne on her face and chest and back and was flat as a board.  Jess and Chelsea&#39;s parents were whispering to each other about how great Chelsea was.  Jess thought that is exactly what they were saying.  Chelsea&#39;s 9th birthday was October 2nd.  Another pool party.  Chelsea was a 30A cup now, Jess looked at her bathing suit.  Jess was furious her 9 year old sister was maturing before her.  Jess sat and pouted the entire party as Chelsea gallivanted around with her awesome body.  Their mom begged Jess to stand up to get a picture with her sister.  She reluctantly finally did.  Their mom saw it first.  Chelsea was barefoot and taller.  About an inch taller.  Jess was so ashamed she went to her room and cried.  Jess went into a depression and started dressing goth.  Mainly to wear the huge heeled boots.  She could stand taller than her 9 year old sister in the boots.  As Halloween approached Chelsea joked &quot;You dress like Halloween everyday, you don&#39;t need a costume.&quot;  she joked as Jess entered the kitchen.  Jess was not in the mood.  &quot;Fuck you Chelsea!&quot;  Jess said.  Chelsea was taken aback but pissed by this comment.  Chelsea grabbed Jess&#39; shoulders and pushed her against the wall hard and pinned her there.  Jess could not wriggle free.  Chelsea was only standing 1 inch shorter than Jess despite Jess being in 4 inch boots.  Jess could see Chelsea&#39;s arms flexed and muscular hold her on the wall.  &quot;Don&#39;t make me hurt you little girl&quot;  said Chelsea.  She let go Jess was relieved and left the house.  On Halloween Chelsea was in the living room in costume waiting to go out trick or treating.  She was a devil for Halloween.  Her shirt was low cut and really noticeable cleavage now popped out of her top.  Jess walked in and her eyes transfixed on the cleavage.  Their mom saw Jess staring and said.  &quot;She is already a small B cup, when are you planning on getting boobs Jess.&quot;  Jess was hurt by this comment but ignored it.  Chelsea smiled.  &quot;I am going to my friends to chill Halloween is for kids.&quot;  said Jess.  &quot;I guess I should not go out and you go out since you are the kid size in the house.&quot;  Chelsea said as she stood up.  Chelsea was standing a full inch taller than Jess.  Jess was in her goth boots and Chelsea barefoot.  Chelsea noticed right away.  &quot;Need taller boots Jess, you must be a midget, take those off.&quot;  said Chelsea.  &quot;Yeah, Jess lets see&quot;  said their mom.  Jess refused.  That night Chelsea snuck into Jess&#39; room and stole the boots.  She put them on and was sitting at the kitchen table.  Their parents were in the kitchen too.  Jess came out of her room confused.  &quot;I cannot find my boots&quot;  said Jess.  Chelsea leapt up and ran over to her, their dad snapped a picture.  Jess only reached her mouth.  Chelsea said &quot;Hi little girl&quot;  and Jess started to cry.  They felt a little bad but were more proud of Chelsea than anything.  Jess found an 8 inch heel at the store and learned to walk in them well.  She met a girl at the store who saw she was short and wearing these tall boots and told her about a pill that could make her grow.  Jess was all in and bought them, this was around Christmas time now.  Jess&#39;s parents let her skip the holidays and focused everything on Chelsea.  Jess grew to 4&#39;8&quot; inches tall by the end of the school year and felt better but knew this was still shorter than Chelsea.</p>
