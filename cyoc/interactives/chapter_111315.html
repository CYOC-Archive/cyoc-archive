<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen slowly came to on the floor, more drawn to consciousness by arousal than anything else.  It was a feeling she had become accustomed to - something about waking up caused Julie to become aroused, which in turn caused Jen to become aroused.  Julie had of course taken advantage of it every time she could, usually stroking herself until she came, and a couple of times even going so far as inviting over friends so she could have sex with them in the early morning.<br />
<br />
But this felt different.  Jen could feel the arousal in her penis - her sister&#39;s body, but it wasn&#39;t caused by Julie&#39;s antics.  No, this was a more subdued arousal.  One dull enough that it didn&#39;t immediately wipe away the fogginess of having just woken up.<br />
<br />
Jen opened her eyes and sat up.  Unlike most times when she woke up, she wasn&#39;t panting or sweating heavily from her sister&#39;s sexual activities.  She was still in the clothes she had worn to school - They were covered in sweat and semen from the several sexual exploits on the way home from school, but none of it was fresh.<br />
<br />
She looked over where her sister, her penis, was lying on the floor.  Over the last couple of weeks Julie had worn less and less clothing, and in the last few days had not bothered to wear any clothes.  Every bit of clothing she had put on had simply gotten dirty, ripped, or stained.  Thanks to the curse, no-one found it odd that Julie was naked or that she was Jen&#39;s penis.<br />
<br />
Jen got up off the floor and sat down on her bed.  The fleshy tube connecting her and her sister magically grew as she walked.  The growth and extension of the tube felt particularly pleasurable and intense - far more than it had earlier in the day.  Checking her watch, she observed it had only been about 2 hours since she had gotten home.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was a bit surprising that she had been able to get 2 hours of uninterrupted sleep during the day - Usually Julie would interrupt that.<br />
<br />
As Jen looked down at Julie&#39;s body on the floor, a nagging sensation tickled at the back of her mind.  Something very important, but just out of reach of her memory.<br />
<br />
Since being cursed, Jen hadn&#39;t been one to directly engage in sexual pleasures - Julie had always done it for her.  In the sparse time of just 20 days, she&#39;d had hundreds of orgasms through her penis Julie, but none in her own pussy.  But Julie seemed to be out cold now, and Jen&#39;s pussy was aching.  To be fair, so was Julie&#39;s pussy, but she wasn&#39;t going to wake up Julie when she had finally gotten a little bit of peace and time to herself.<br />
<br />
She quickly undressed and lay down on the bed, then reached down to finger herself with her right arm.  Just as her fingers entered her pussy, she felt a similar feeling from the pussy on her penis.  Jen quickly looked up, and was surprised to see that Julie&#39;s body was still lying on the floor in the same position, except her right arm was fingering her pussy.<br />
<br />
Jen pulled back, afraid her sister had woken up.  As she did, Julie&#39;s right arm pulled away at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, very funny Julie.&quot;<br />
<br />
No response.  Julie lay motionless on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on.  I know you&#39;re awake.  Just give it up already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie continued to play possum, not moving beyond breathing.  Angry at the prank that Julie was playing on her, Jen rushed over to Julie and reared up her leg to kick Julie.  But she couldn&#39;t bring herself to do it - If she did she&#39;d hurt herself just as much as she hurt Julie.<br />
<br />
Instead she knelt down in front of Julie&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  Get out of my room!  It&#39;s bad enough you embarrassed me on the way home from school.  FIVE times!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aggravated by Julie&#39;s continued non-reaction, Jen reached over and pried open Julie&#39;s left eyelid.  As she did, she was assaulted by a wave of sensations she had never experienced before.  Sight came to a part of her that never had sight before.  Startled and surprised, Jen fell back on her ass, her legs splayed out.<br />
<br />
Jen felt her eyes blink and stay open simultaneously.  Two scenes coexisted simultaneously in her mind&#39;s eye - she could both see the ceiling... and she could see her legs splayed open and her pussy right there: open, inviting and aching to be filled.<br />
<br />
Unable to really comprehend what she was seeing, a thought crossed into her mind - <i>Since getting cursed, I&#39;ve never found out what it&#39;s like to be on both sides of the sex, even though I&#39;m physically able</i>.  As the thought was finishing, she felt a weird stretching sensation, as though her head was being pulled like taffy.  It lasted only a moment, but as soon as it was done, she continued her thought... in two different ways: <i>Julie would take advantage of me if I asked her to do that</i> / <i>Well, why not?  It is my body.  Not like it&#39;s anyone else&#39;s business.</i>.<br />
<br />
And with that, Julie&#39;s body quickly pushed forward, placing her head at Jen&#39;s exposed pussy, and began to lick her pussy and thighs.  Jen instantly began to feel more and more aroused.  &quot;Nnnoo Juliiii---- e!&quot;  Julie&#39;s tongue was touching Jen in all the right places.  &quot;I dddon&#39;t wa--- nt to get pregnaaaaahh!  No!&quot;<br />
<br />
In an instant, Julie&#39;s tongue stopped moving and Julie&#39;s entire body froze.  At the same moment, Jen remembered the curse she had given her sister on getting home from school.  She remembered telling her sister to transform into part of her body, completely under her control with none of her original personality.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, it made sense to Jen.  Why Julie&#39;s body had moved as she had moved.  Why she could now see out of Julie&#39;s eyes, hear out of Julie&#39;s ears, and feel everything with so much more clarity.  Why her thought had turned into 2 simultaneous thoughts.  Why Julie&#39;s body had started to have sex with Jen&#39;s pussy.<br />
<br />
Julie was gone - Her body was now completely Jen.  Julie&#39;s body still looked like Julie had, but they had been twin sisters, so she looked a lot like Jen&#39;s body.  To be correct, she was actually a part of Jen&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Jen sat up with both her normal body and her penis body, and stared at her selves.  Panic rushed through her veins.  She was Julie.<br />
She was Julie&#39;s legs, her torso, her breasts, her butt, her arms, her head... even Julie&#39;s brain.  Thoughts and emotions raced in both her brains - How would she explain this change?  Would the curse make it so that Julie had never existed?  Had she really killed her sister?  Should she feel guilty about what she had done?<br />
<br />
As she asked herself the last question, she answered her own question with the brain in her penis - No, she should not feel guilty.  Her penis had been born a part of her, it just was not hooked up the full way, and had gotten out of control.  She had just gotten her penis back under control.  And rightly so - how many penises have free will of their own?  Sure, hers might have arms, legs, breasts, a brain and a pussy, but it was still her penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, it&#39;s the curse&quot; &quot;Oh god, it&#39;s the curse&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen exclaimed, surprised as both mouths under her control spoke.  She struggled to get the words out only one of her mouths.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It did this-&quot; &quot;-to me.  And then-&quot; &quot;-it&#39;s making me justify killing-&quot; &quot;-my sister.  It&#39;s making me think I&#39;ve-&quot; &quot;-always been this way.&quot; *pause* &quot;Have I not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused and distressed, Jen pushed forward, bringing both her selves together, and hugged tightly.  Her 4 breasts pressed together firmly, and one pair began to slowly increase as the feeling aroused her further.  <br />
<br />
She vividly remembered always being like this, with her normal body and her nearly identical penis body connected by the fleshy tube.  Memories came to her of her life growing up this way, with no sister.  And yet, she could remember having a sister who was not connected, not a penis, and was a separate person entirely.  By making her sister part of her, Jen had forced the curse to make her aware of both existences - the existence unaware of her curse, and the existence aware of her curse.<br />
<br />
Time passed slowly as Jen&#39;s brains zig-zagged through her double pasts, remembering events both as a single person with a 2nd nearly identical penis body, and as a normal girl with a twin sister.  As she struggled to make sense of it, her arousal increased even further.<br />
<br />
It built and it built until, unable to resist it any further, Jen separated her bodies and looked her selves straight in the eyes, then spoke with both mouths:<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure how I wound up like this.  I just know that I am me, and I like who I am.  Oh god I&#39;m so horny I&#39;ve gotta fuck myself!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure how I wound up like this.  I just know that I am me, and I like who I am.  Oh god I&#39;m so horny I&#39;ve gotta fuck myself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen rushed over to her bed and lay on her back with her prime body.  Her penis body approached from the bottom of the bed.  The breasts on her penis body had grown massive, at least 2&#39; in diameter.  Pre-cum dribbled down her lips.  At the sight of the pre-cum, Jen remembered what she had said in one of her pasts - That she could control the fertility of her sperm.  Not wanting to get herself pregnant, she decided she should not be fertile at all.  For now...<br />
<br />
While Jen&#39;s prime brain had been thinking about not getting pregnant, her penis brain had already started to finger and lick Jen&#39;s pussy.  Eager to find out what it was going to feel like, being both parts of sex at the same time, Jen grabbed her penis&#39;s shoulders, and pushed down.  Jen&#39;s penis&#39;s head compacted down and fit into her own pussy.  As it did, Jen&#39;s minds erupted in orgasmic bliss, overwhelming all other feelings.<br />
<br />
She licked the inside of her own pussy and continued to push further until her penis was buried in her prime pussy up to the shoulders.  Every motion she made was pure bliss, times two.  Her penis twisted and turned while thrusting in and out of her pussy, struggling to lick as much of the inside of her pussy as she could.  The motion caused the penis body to twist and turn, rubbing against the bed-sheets and arousing her even more.<br />
<br />
Jen stroked her penis body&#39;s massive breasts with all 4 hands.  It sent her over the edge, causing her to spill her load out of her penis&#39;s mouth moments later.  As she did, she orgasmed twice.  The sensations were not only magnitudes better than any other she had ever experienced, she was experiencing two orgasms at once.  And on top of that, she was experiencing both of those orgasms twice - Once in each brain.<br />
<br />
Her world was nothing but blinding white pleasure for what felt like forever.  As the enormous raw pleasure started to fade, she pulled her penis&#39;s head out of her pussy and passed out. Both of her faces had enormous grins plastered on them.</p>
