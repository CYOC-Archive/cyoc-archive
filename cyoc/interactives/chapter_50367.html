<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two new bimbos, Rachel and her Mother, walked through the front door of their <br />
house. Their arms were full of shopping bags from the mall. They both wore matching <br />
slutty attire, including a super short mini skirt and tops that barely contained their massive <br />
boobs. Rachel now looked just like a younger version of her mother.<br />
<br />
They both giggled as they turned on the kitchen light. Sitting down at the kitchen table <br />
was a woman in her early thirties, in a woman's business suit, typing at her laptop. She <br />
looked up at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohmigod! Like who are you?&quot; Rachel said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is great&quot; the woman said to herself. &quot;I never expected to get a two for one special.&quot; <br />
She continued typing on her laptop. <br />
<br />
She looked up again. &quot;Are you two the only ones who live here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; Karen giggled. &quot;Just us two naughty girls!&quot; Rachel felt for a moment that she should <br />
be worried. But that quickly faded. Rachel giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, good&quot; the woman continued typing. &quot;We know about you Rachel, whose this other <br />
woman you're with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, my mom silly!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hii! I'm Karen!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Rachel, Karen, congratulations on being the first two subjects of my companies new <br />
formula. I'm sure you're both pleased with the results.<br />
<br />
Rachel was confused. &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now that we've done something nice for you,&quot; the woman continued. &quot;I think it's time <br />
for you two to do something nice for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats that??&quot; Rachel said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my job to bring back five test subjects for our new formula.&quot; The woman pulled two <br />
small vials out of her bag. &quot;You and your mother are the first two, and now I need you two <br />
to help me bring in two more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like why would we wanna do that?!&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
The woman began typing into her laptop. &quot;We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. <br />
But at the end of the day, you two will help me with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The worrying feeling came back to Rachel. Her new bimbo mind didn't know how to react <br />
to it. So she just giggled. &quot;Like what do you want us to do??&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's simple. All you have to do is find another woman, either someone you know or <br />
someone you don't, and convince them to drink this vial. Either straight or mixed in <br />
another drink. It doesn't matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, But Um, How are we supposta convince people to drink it.&quot; Rachel replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you'll both find that you have new hypnotic influence over other people as bimbos.  <br />
You may have already noticed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel and Karen both didn't know what she was talking about. The woman smiled. &quot;I'm <br />
sure you'll both see soon enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen stomped her extra high heel on the ground. &quot;And what if we dont?!? What if I go and <br />
spend the rest of the day fucking! then what!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already told you,&quot; the woman got very serious. &quot;If you don't want to help us willingly, <br />
we'll make you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;no! no! no!&quot; Rachel stammered. &quot;Like, we'll help. Its just umm, like one person each, right?<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I'll take of the last one myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel turned to her mom. &quot;Like, we can do that right mom?&quot; Karen tried to think about <br />
that. She didn't like thinking. She didn't like being given stuff to that. She was a bimbo and <br />
she wanted to go around and be the best bimbo she could. But Rachel wanted her too. So <br />
she supposed it was important.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, fine hunny.&quot; Karen gave in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent,&quot; the woman replied. &quot;You should really thank your daughter, Karen.&quot; The <br />
woman handed the two vials over.<br />
<br />
Karen was getting annoyed with the woman. She didn't like the way she talked, she didn't <br />
like the way dressed, and she didn't like the way she was acting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like Mayybe you should drink one of these. Then that'll be one less person to go, right??&quot; <br />
Karen giggled.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I don't think so.&quot; The woman smiled. &quot;The two of you were made into bimbos because <br />
you were both boringly average. You're more useful to society as a slutty eye candy. Where <br />
as someone like me has actual importance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen started tapping her manicured nails on the table. &quot;Like, Just look at you hunny. <br />
Those clothes arent sexy at all!&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen stared into the eyes of the woman as she inched closer. &quot;Like, maybe youd feel soo <br />
much better if you just tried it.&quot; Karen continued tapping her nails in a rhythmic pattern.<br />
<br />
The woman kept staring up at Karen. &quot;Like, maybe you should drink the vial!&quot; Karen <br />
giggled as she handed it over. The woman slowly took it in her hands. She continued <br />
looking up at Karen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drink the vial?&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesss,&quot; Karen giggled.<br />
<br />
The woman smiled. &quot;You didn't actually think I'd be in contact with you bimbos without <br />
getting an immunization first?&quot; The woman put the vial on the table.<br />
<br />
Uh oh. Karen thought it was working. She didn't think of that.<br />
<br />
The woman reached into her bag and pulled out a small perfume atomizer. &quot;Last warning. <br />
Do you want to just do what I told you and make this easy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, never!!&quot; Karen said defiantly. She may be a bimbo, but she still did what she wanted.<br />
<br />
The woman smiled. &quot;Have it your way.&quot; She sprayed the atomizer twice in Karen's direction. <br />
Karen began coughing. Rachel looked over at her mom. &quot;Mom, like are you ok??&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman looked pleased. &quot;Your mother's fine, Rachel. In fact, I think she'll be behaving <br />
much better now, won't you Karen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen looked up at the woman obediently. &quot;Ohh yess. Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, come over here now Karen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen smiled at the woman as she sexily strutted on over and sat down in the chair next <br />
to hers. The woman took off her shoes and placed her feet in Karen's lap. &quot;My aching feet <br />
are so sore. You'll massage them for you, won't you Karen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen eagerly began rubbing the woman's feet. &quot;Oh yess, master.&quot; She looked up at the <br />
woman and giggled. &quot;Anything for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel looked over to her mom. &quot;Mom?&quot; Her mother didn't even look over. All of her <br />
concentration seemed to be focus in massaging the woman's feet.<br />
<br />
Rachel was confused. And scared. At least as scared as a bimbo could possibly be. &quot;Like <br />
what'd you do to my mom??&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just gave her something to make her a little more helpful. Don't worry, it'll wear off in an <br />
hour and she'll be back to her old bitchy self.&quot; The woman smiled. &quot;At least, unless I decide <br />
to spray her again with the perfume in the next hour. Then she'll permanently be like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen stopped rubbing the woman's feet for a moment to look up. &quot;Ohh yes!! Please do <br />
that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother would seem to like that. Maybe you would too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, like, I'll help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent&quot; the woman said. &quot;That's just what I wanted to hear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just change my mother back&quot; Rachel replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already told you, she's stuck like this for the next hour. I couldn't change her back if I <br />
wanted. Just bring me another bimbo and I'll let your mother go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel looked down at her vial. Then over at her mother, who was for some reason <br />
lovingly rubbing the strange woman's feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, fine. But I'll be back!&quot; Rachel said heading towards the door.<br />
<br />
The woman smiled. &quot;We'll be waiting.&quot;</p>
