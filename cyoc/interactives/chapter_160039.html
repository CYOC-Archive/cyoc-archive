<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sheri was a mess of bodily changing, all ongoing there as she rose up and trotting, her bristle coated arms were becoming more as forelegs of her four legs.<br />
<br />
Dave and his Veterinarian friend stood shoulder to shoulder just outside the farmhouse rear door, they watching what was Sheri making her way back to where she felt was best for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is insane,&quot; the Vet guy said, &quot;How was that possible, we just saw a pretty human female transition of species, to become a Sow pig, the fact of it defile all reason!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; Dave replying said, &quot;As yet around as on this farm such changes, similar miracles have happened before this odd situation for Sheri.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, you mean to say that other people came to your farm and were changed as well, becoming then animals?&quot; The Vet asked as he stood there gawking at Dave, the man feeling stupefied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it has happened, as an example my new herd-sire buck goat there grazing alongside Carol the doe goat. He, Bob arrived here to pay me a overdue visit, we were as great friends during our high school years. You see there is this curse upon the pastures, and if someone enters the pasture through the gates, the curse will not bother them. However, like a trespasser might enter the pastures, as leaping, jump the fences, they or that person is drawn into the curse; as all they need do is touch any animal in the pastures, and that makes the choice of their future.&quot; Dave explained, and stood there not smiling as he had when he coaxed his friend to leap the pen fence and chase then Carol.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all pure B.S.&quot; the Vet said, his tone of voice being of a man feeling his intelligence was insulted. &quot;Nothing ever happened to me, and I was in the pastures many times in the past!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Dave replied with then a smile, &quot;Because what you do is always done proper, you use the gates to enter the pastures, as that move keeps you safe from being changed as we just watched my niece become a Sow!&quot;<br />
<br />
It happened about then as coming from inside the barn both men heard the squealing sounds of an angry pig.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, I bet that is Sheri, and she now finds her shorter legs are keeping her from entering the pig pen. Oh she would otherwise step over, or jump the fence, as that kind of move would sooner or later give her good reason for wishing she did not do as I told her she should do. Sheri was alway as willful as is her father, my brother; but now she might change her attitude.&quot; Dave remarked as of Sheri and her becoming a pig.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what then for Sheri, is her changes, transitioning of species as temporary, or, is it permanent?&quot; The Veterinarian asked, as his facial skin was looking pale as if he were scared.<br />
<br />
Dave began walking toward the barn as he needed to quell the angry Sow and let her enter the pig pen and take up her relating to her boar hog friend. &quot;You coming,&quot; Dave said, &quot;The curse has many tentacles, as a person is so changed, the curse reaches out to touch their pasts, physically rearranging of history, erasing records of their being born as human, cancelling all memories anyone ever had of the person cursed and transformed. Although those who become as changed, they remember well their pasts and if they were to see a friend, or family member no matter where, they become excited, as want to communicate.<br />
<br />
A very real example of when a changeling, the person so change, changeling is what I say when speaking privately to the animal with a human mentality. Anyway, I was at the county fair last August and had with me a Ram, he became  like the herd-sire he touched after hiking, he jumped the fence and became as one effected. He paid me his respects and hiked onward, as used my pasture for a shortcut. He arrived back to my house after several days, during which time as he told me, he petted a black ram of the Welsh mountain breed of sheep.<br />
<br />
When Johnson arrived at my front door, he frantic as you might imagine. When I answered the hard knocking at my front door, I saw again Johnson but then he was as a naked man, dressed out in a thickening black colored wool  pelt of sheep wool. He was as a Caucasian man when he trespassed, but when he returned to here, his skin had changed to a deep indigo-black hue. He had by then ears and small horns, his lower self changed as well, his legs, feet, and he had cloven hooves of the sheep. Indeed, he was rapidly becoming a Ram, the poor fellow was crying, scared, and in need of a friend. <br />
<br />
Naturally I befriended him, me seeing and knowing that within, say a week or maybe ten more days and I would be the owner of one champion Ram  sheep.<br />
<br />
Ack, yes I know that what I said does sound as heartless, but the fellow did trespass, and I do not control the curse, I just bought the farm. Ha, bought the farm, an old phrase, as much too Johnson my his willful trespassing across the farm property, as for his future he too, bought the farm and became for me as a prize winning sheep Ram.<br />
<br />
He is not here, as due to his becoming physically a champion class Welsh Mountain breed sheep-Ram, he gained a much enhanced set of male genitals, his penis grew longer, was 12 to 14 inches, and his balls, damn it as I never seen such big black orbs! His balls were the same size as a Florida Navel Orange, as he had two that big. I measured his semen production, used the electric ejaculator on him. Cripe, but his ejaculating, the first time I did it to him, he shot five streams, and the semen flew across four feet of the barn floor. <br />
<br />
When he as much begged of me to make use of the electro-ejaculator a second time, I held a Mason jar to his distal end of that black cock, as Johnson&#39;s johnson, his cock spewed forth one and a half pints of semen from one climaxing.<br />
<br />
After I had befriended Johnson and we talking until his muzzle grew and face so changed he could but do one Baaing to signify a Yes answer, and do similar as twice quickly to specify a No reply. I did inform him of the curse and how it would work to cover his tracks through human history. He was worried about his wife and their four children, but after he became as all a Ram. <br />
<br />
I went to the public library and checked marital records, noting his wife as having married another man, a friend of both her and Johnson, as the young parents had four children. The news I brought to Johnson seemed to settle his worries as he early on was able to scrawl with a fore-hoof in pen-sand some inspired questions, most of which dealt with his newer preferences, as wanting to become a herd-sire.<br />
<br />
You know or maybe service the Hallord farm, as Bob Hallord breeds sheep and has begun a herd of Black Welsh Mountain, using then Johnson as a leased Ram. <br />
<br />
Some of those who became as cursed animals, a few relish their new self, finding sensual delights by being an animal, then free of social morals, they enjoy mating. Johnson enjoys being a Ram, and from what Bob Hallord tells me, that the Ram Johnson though does not act as a brute male, he courts his mates, is gentle, and takes on the responsibility as a herd-sire, he keeps the sheep dogs at bay, and chased a Fox to run away.<br />
<br />
I suspect that Sheri too has found what satisfies her greater desires, she was as a nymphomaniac, but never wanting men, she preferred male animals!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What a story, I guess in the future when I come and inspect your animals, I will handle them with a different style of care and give them consideration for their having feelings. &quot; The Vet said, he shaking his head as of disbelief, watching what was Sheri, she wallowing in the pig pen mud, seemingly delighted with her menial surroundings.<br />
<br />
Just as the Vet was ready to start the engine of his pickup truck, Dave made the man an offer, as maybe in jest, as he said, &quot;Remember now, if you get in a jam, any big trouble you can&#39;t get out of, know that by leaping any of my fences, your troubles will become the history of someone else, and you, your future, well you will relish the feel of being male everyday for the rest of your life!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the Veterinarian drove out onto the road he looked back at Dave, as if maybe wondering about as he might someday ask to leap a pasture fence; seeing Carol and Bob the two goats as mating again.</p>
