<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The latex husky rummages about his bag for another moment or so before his face lights up with excitement, finding what he was looking for. He pulls out a brown, slightly damp paper bag. Tossing the old bag off of the table to make room, he pulls up a chair from near the pool and sits down. From within the bag, the latex husky removes a whole wheat bread sandwich filled with ham, cheese, solami, and kibble falling in small amounts from the sandwich to the cold tile floor.<br />
<br />
A smirk flashes across his face as he looks to you -- almost chuckling -- before taking his first sloppy bite. Kibble continues to fall from his &quot;interesting&quot; sandwich. After finishing up, he takes out a fiber rich food bar and devours it swiftly. Full enough on food he lies down with his face near yours and takes a quick nap. Perhaps it wouldn&#39;t have been so bad if not for his breath. Not only does he have dog breath, but he emenates his latex scent constantly and added salomi breath to the mix. His hot stink continuously meets your face as you lie there helpless. Shooting a glare at him, you notice his unwavering grin that screams bad news for you. Another hot stink breath to the face.<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t take any more of this. The breath is sickening enough, but his inevitable return to the waking world will undoubtedly be worse. You struggle in your latex bonds to no avail. You look around for something in your reach to attempt to remove them, but there is nothing of use nearby. You hear the latex husky shift a bit, his latex sqeaking loudly so close to you. Something growls within him, undoubtedly the food, but does he even have a stomach? Regardless, it isn&#39;t good, so you try movement again. This time you try wiggling like a worm, but the awkward placement of your binds forces you to just flop about on the floor. It looks like your flopping was enough to wake him.<br />
<br />
The latex husky stirs and gets up, squeaking along the way. He looks to you, still bearing his evil grin. You hear his internal growling once more, louder now. A look of strain now takes his face, as if he&#39;s trying to hold something back. Quickly, he crouches and all becomes clear. He bares his teeth and growls as he pushes hard from his bowels. His struggle seems to come to a boiling point when he releases a massive shit, unlike you&#39;ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
It is beyond human not only in size, but in consistency and stench. It shines like his latex body, but seems to seep a more liquid form of the latex from itself. Then back to its size, it&#39;s the size of a small melon or a football. You gasped at the size and immediately regretted it. With your gasp, you took in its awful stench. It was so strong that you could taste it, and the taste was horrid. The latex husky&#39;s shit reeked of hot rubber, hot shit, and dairy; he must not take well to cheese. Your eyes begin to water, blurring your vision. Breathing as little as possible, you stare at the husky, who is laughing loudly at you. You&#39;d punch him if you could. Coming back from his canine laughing fit, he places his hands under the shit and scoops it all up. It almost is falling out of his two giant hands. He continues to inwardly laugh as he carries it to you and hovers it above your face, letting you really get a taste for its horror. Your eyes are practically waterfalls while you cough and gag violently at the repulsive smell of it so close. After his little moment of hovering it, he quickly drops it from his hands, directly onto your face.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for you, its weight brought it down too quickly for you to take a breath. You open your mouth in an attempt to take in air and the now popped latex bag of shit slides into your mouth and down your throat. What hits you first is not its taste, but its temperature. You&#39;d heard the term &quot;steaming pile of shit&quot; before, but never thought about what such a thing may be like. Now, there&#39;s no need to think; his latex shit is already burning your face, mouth, and neck as the thick, slick, sloppy substance spreads to cover more of your body. What hits you next is the taste. It tastes just as it had smelled and more. Anyone who&#39;s ever been to the gorilla exhibit at a zoo would know that gorillas smells bad. If you could take that smell, turn it into a taste, and combine it with hot rubber and hot shit, you&#39;d have the taste that&#39;s in your mouth right now.<br />
<br />
The steaming shit continues down your neck to your chest, melting the latex that once bound you and overtaking it. You try to scream in pain, but the air tou let out only makes a latex bubble form from your mouth and pop, faster spreading the latex shit across your body. The latex now meets your waist and burns your crotch, building on your pain. All of your body covered in latex is paralyzed, leaving your legs to flail about and amuse the latex husky who did this to you. The stinking latex flows along your legs and finally coats your feet, sealing you in a cocoon of latex shit.<br />
<br />
This, however, doesn&#39;t last long. The latex begins to shift over your paralyzed frame. All over, it begins inflating and building layer over layer of latex bulk. Your arms lengthen a few inches and your hands become far more like paws you can grab decently with. Rougher black pads of latex grow on your hands that are now adorned with glossy, hard black claws. Your arms thicken to seven inches thick with sheer muscle. This packing on of muscle is accompanied by a dull ache that signifies the change. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, your chest has grown massively, now being two feet wide. Latex muscle stacks on to support your new frame, giving you immense pecs and abs. However, what is all this muscle and weight if you can&#39;t stand? Your legs quickly fix that by becoming and entire foot thickat your thighs.<br />
<br />
Speaking of thighs, how is your formerly burned crotch? Never better, in fact! Your dick has lengthened to a flaccid length of eight inches and a width of two inches. To be proportionate, your balls swelled to your sac being the size of a grapefruit. Shiny brown latex covers all of these new changes.<br />
<br />
Now, you feel a pressure in your face build until releasing in a stretching feeling on your nose and mouth. Your nose turns black and protrudes from your face until you have a proper bear&#39;s muzzle. You try to open your eyes, but the changes aren&#39;t done yet. A new weight where all of you new muscles developed grew steadily. This change smoothed out all of your previous muscle definition with a latex layer of &quot;fat.&quot; Your stomach and pecs swelled extra until you had a significant paunch and small moobs.<br />
<br />
You try to move your arm and manage to pull the heavy appendige up and onto your new belly to feel it out. You open your now brown eyes to see for yourself. You immediately notice the large obstruction of your view that is your new muzzle. Craning your neck a bit, you finally spot your large belly and pat it, chuckling in a new, deep bass. You shift your weight and stand, breathing in your surroundings. You quickly notice your heaightened sense of smell and sight in the previously dark seeming room. You can clearly see all of the latex husky&#39;s tools scattered across the floor. With your nose, you catch the permanently lingering -- yet subtle -- scent of shit and latex. Smelling the husky, who smells like wet dog and latex, you realize that what you smell must be your natural musk, and you like it. It&#39;s a constant reminder of how you came to be the powerful and lustful being you are now. Looking to the latex husky, he stares back at you intently. You notice that he is now at least two feet shorter than you. You must have grown maybe three to four feet because he was taller than you when you saw him before. You mind drifts back to then for a moment; you used to be a human who hated the latex creatures. You quickly throw that away, you were obviously wrong before. You love nothing more than what you are right now. Coming back to the husky, you smirk, perhaps you&#39;ll give him a little thank you...</p>
