<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Jasmine finished eating and went a ways
away from the food court eventually
sitting down on the edge of one of the
coin pools. Thinking ahead, she carefully
drew her tail around in front of her so it
wouldn't get wet, then sat there. She was
feeling <i>very</i> moody right now, and
definitely didn't want to spend time
around the mother who thought she should
be happy to be a girl or the friends who
thought that it really wasn't so bad. She
loved them all dearly, but she just
couldn't stand the way her mother tried to
pretty her up, or the way Tabitha just
quietly accepted this whole mess, or the
way Klondike took to girlhood like a fish
to water despite having been every bit as
male in mindset as she was...she just
needed to be alone, since there was noone
she could talk to about this.</p>
<p>"Hey, Jef-er, Jasmine!" a voice called.
She looked up. It was Ryan, a friend from
school. "I heard about what happened," he
said in a quieter voice, as he walked up.
"That must be pretty weird, I expect."</p>
<p>"How did you find out?" Jasmine
asked.</p>
<p>"The school called all the students'
families last night," he said. "They said
that you, Timmy, and Derek had been turned
into girls with cat features, and that
your new name was Jasmine, Timmy's was
Tabitha, and Derek's was Klondike. Did you
pick the names? And if you don't mind my
asking, how did it happen?"</p>
<p>Jasmine sighed. "No, we didn't. And as
near as we can figure out it happened
because Tabitha pissed off a djinni, and
she changed our identities and made our
parents accept us and now Tabitha doesn't
mind and Klondike enjoys it and my mom
wants me to be happy about it and oh god
i'm going to cry..." Her voice trailed off
as she fought to keep the tears back.</p>
<p>Ryan sat down next to her. "Don't fight
it," he said. "If you keep everything
bottled inside you like that you're going
to really hurt yourself. Even guys cry,
sometimes. You just need to let it
out."</p>
<p>Everything came out at once. Jasmine
began to cry loudly. It was so
horrible...she didn't want to be a girl,
didn't want to wear girls' clothes or put
on makeup or have periods or anything like
that, but everyone around her thought it
wasn't so bad or even thought she should
be glad about it...everyone except Ryan,
that is, who had place a comforting arm
around her. She buried her head in his
shoulder. She didn't care what it looked
like, it felt so good to let it all out
after keeping it all inside. And it was so
good that he was there for her to unburden
on...he smelled nice, he really did. <i>Oh
no,</i> she thought, <i>did I just think
that? But...he does smell nice...</i> She
couldn't help it; she found herself
getting turned on, ever so slightly. That
set off a fresh round of sobs.</p>
<p>Ryan sat there, arm around Jasmine, who
was crying on his shoulder. <i>Wow,</i>
he thought, <i>this must really be tough
on her. Good thing I happened along.
She...she really makes a pretty
girl...holy cow, did I just think
that?</i> He looked her over; she really
<i>was</i> pretty, now that her anger had
given way to sorrow. He wished he could
see what she looked like when she was
happy. But she'd have to get over this
first. <i>Well,</i> he thought, <i>if I
can help her in any way, I will.</i> He
felt her bury her head deeper in his
shoulder. <i>Especially if it's something
like this,</i> he thought.</p>
<p>Gradually, Jasmine's sobs subsided,
until she was just buried in his shoulder,
gently quaking. He pulled her back to a
sitting position. "Listen," he said. "I
know you've heard the 'it could be worse'
argument, and it sounds like you've even
heard the 'it couldn't be better'
argument." She nodded."I'm not going to
say you should be happy about this," he
continued, "but it really could be worse.
I mean, you got stung by a genie; that
really could've turned out bad. I'm sure
this really is hard for you, but you need
to realize that it's not the end of the
world. There's lots of options. For one,
if genies exist then there must be magic.
So you could look for something that could
change you back. Even if you don't find a
way to change back, being a girl can't be
that bad. Just because you're a girl
doesn't mean you're obligated to act
feminine. Lots of girls are tomboys to one
degree or another. It doesn't mean you
have to start liking guys, either," he
said, with a tinge of regret in his voice.
"Heck, you might even find out that you're
a lesbian."</p>
<p>Jasmine considered that; she thought
about doing things with another girl, but
even the idea of just making out with one
repulsed her. "I don't know what I am,"
she fudged, remembering how she'd just
felt when she was crying on his shoulder,
"but I'm not a lesbian."</p>
<p>Ryan was happy to hear that, but tried
not to look like it. "Well, whatever you
are," he said, "just being a girl doesn't
mean you have to embrace everything girls
usually do. You can still be you and most
people will be accepting of it. So I guess
what I'm trying to say is, don't think
that all is lost. Just keep being
you."</p>
<p>Jasmine nodded. They both sat there for
a long time. Jasmine wondered what exactly
"being you" constituted in her case. She
really felt that she didn't want to dress
and act feminine, that was for sure.
Andshe'd thought that she wanted to back
to being male as soon as possible, but now
there was another factor to consider: try
as she might, she couldn't deny that she
was attracted to Ryan, and from what she
could smell on him and a few other cues
she'd picked up, it seemed like he might
be attracted to her as well. It had
started with the physical attraction she'd
felt when she was in close contact with
him, but she had always liked him as a
friend, and now that seemed to be growing
into something more. He was a nice guy,
after all, and he'd just allowed her to
sit there and unload all her troubles on
him without expecting anything in
return...and the advice he'd offered
really had been good; she knew that it had
been a mistake to keep all her feelings
bottled up in a time of such stress, and
he'd encouraged her to let them out. And
he was right; just being a girl didn't
mean she had to act like one, but she'd
forgotten that thanks to her mother. She
knew her mom wasn't intending it, but
she'd been smothering Jasmine with her
obvious joy in the prospect of having a
daughter. Jasmine knew her mother loved
her, and thought that maybe if she
explained things her mother would
understand. She was grateful for Ryan's
patience and advice; whatever came of
this, she was grateful to have a friend
like him.</p></p>
