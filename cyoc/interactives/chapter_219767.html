<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus and Jesse stared at the boxes in front of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Such a big box for just one pill, huh.&quot; Said Marcus, trying to break the tension.<br />
<br />
Marcus was a 26 years old bodybuilder. Supposedly at his prime, but that seemed to mean less and less these days. Last year was gonna be his year. He had trained the whole year and yet he could barely compete with the O5-Blockers. There weren&#39;t that many, just enough to fill up the top 5 of his regionals. He had resisted the temptation to start on the gender pills but clearly that wasn&#39;t gonna win him any tournaments. <br />
<br />
He was by no means a small man, though, 5&#39;11, 230 pounds of muscle, 2 weeks into bulking. But as the Blockers increased in numbers and size, he knew he just couldn&#39;t compete. At least not until separate categories were established and who knew how long that would take, how many participation trophies he would have to swallow before that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, weird right...&quot; Jesse said, looking anxiously between the pills and his friend.<br />
<br />
Marcus had been insisting on the both of them doing this together for a couple days before Jesse caved. Jesse, at 29, was no bodybuilder like his friend, having more of a toned fitness guru type of body. To be fair he was fairly curious about the effects of the drug, some of the stuff people said about it on the internet was wild. It ranged from the relatively tame &quot;the best orgasms I&#39;ve had in my life&quot; to the esoteric &quot;I finally realized where my place in the universe is&quot; and &quot;you&#39;ll feel so good you&#39;ll feel like God actually cares&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now that the pills were bought, and they were looking at possibly-actually-quite-likely loosing their dicks for the next 24 hours, though? Well now he was starting to feel like maybe he shouldn&#39;t really have indulged Marcus this time. They met at the gym when both of them had been beginners, started training together not much later. &#39;Good work out chemistry&#39;, Marcus usually said. They hadn&#39;t really interacted much outside of the gym though, this was the first time in their 5 year long friendship that Jesse had went into Marcus&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Jesse said, awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Marcus said and bolted up of his seat. &quot;Yeah, no, lets just do this already.&quot; He grabbed the single pill boxes, the logo of the pharma company plastered on it and tossed one to Jesse, that caught it skillfully. &quot;On my count, lets go. 3... 2... 1... Go!&quot; Jesse barely had time to take his pill out of the box and they both downed it simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So does this take long to start?&quot; Jesse said, looking down at his body, looking for signs of the change.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can take around 10 minutes... I know-&quot; Marcus grabbed the TV remote and turned it on. On the TV an episode of Blaster Chef America had just started. &quot;This will help us distract ourselves until then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
----------------- First Stage<br />
<br />
Jesse watched as the competitors cooked on the TV. The challenge was to harmonize an unusual ingredient with a salad. The host went through each participant asking them about what they were planning to cook.<br />
<br />
&quot; ... So I&#39;ll be making an eggplant frittata with fettuccine, and I&#39;ll add the Kimchi to the tomato sauce...&quot; A war-veteran, middle aged competitor spoke in a gruff tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, eggplant.&quot; Marcus said.  He wasn&#39;t one to make this kind of joke but it felt so funny to him for some reason, he couldn&#39;t stop himself giggling.<br />
<br />
Jesse was about to remark on the same thing, when the camera closed in the competitors hands as they placed the eggplant on the chopping board. He couldn&#39;t help but notice how broad and veiny the man&#39;s hands were, full of calluses from clearly working out. The camera cutting to the next competitor broke his fascination. Looking beside him, he could see Marcus attentively watching the episode, his hands gripping the TV remote.<br />
<br />
Hands that were also big, and veiny, and calloused. He felt like touching them, but controlled himself. He wondered what touching them would feel like. He felt a tingle through his body, his dick immediately starting to stirr.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel that? I think its starting!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this feels weird.&quot; Marcus said as he felt his dick rise on its own. He hadn&#39;t felt aroused or anything. &quot;This is so weeeird.&quot; He giggled, leaning back, his hard dick visible through his gym shorts.<br />
<br />
Jesse caught himself staring and quickly looked away. What was happening to him today? Could this be a side effect of the pills? He hadn&#39;t heard-<br />
<br />
&quot;OMG&quot; Gasped Marcus as his breath hitched. He was getting tingles all over his body as new nerves connected to his skin. In just a few seconds most of it had stopped, but he still felt the tingles strong at his nipples.<br />
<br />
Jesse, that lost his train of thought after his friend&#39;s outburst, was now rubbing his hand on his jeans. They felt different than before: rough, but nice to rub against his skin, like scratching an itch. He stopped when he felt his nipples harden against the fabric of his shirt. His hard dick was now visible through the fabric of his jeans, the hard on had started to feel more like his regular ones: throbbing, needy, urgent. He lifted his hands from his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I feel it coming strong now, Marc. I think this is the part we have to resist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this it? I thought it was supposed to be much stronger?&quot; Marcus said, still leaning back, trying to ignore the feeling of his shirt against the skin of his torso, everything felt good, almost like when you&#39;re sleepy and everything feels soft. His nipples making tiny bumps on the fabric. Nice, but not overwhelmingly nice. He flexed his dick confidently, the tent on his shorts bouncing. He giggled again at the thought of other men struggling with this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right.&quot; Jesse said, looking at his friend as the bodybuilder wriggled slightly under his clothes, a confident smile on his face as he stared at the ceiling. Jesse&#39;s dick was feeling good now, compressed under a thick layer of denim, as he conjured up memories of the man in front of him on the gym lockers, shirtless, sweaty, his hairy pecs pumped from a work out- Red flushed through his face and neck as he realized what he was thinking about. As the red reached his chest he felt pressure behind his nipples and felt the weirdest thing so far.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing, silly?&quot; Marcus said in a playful tone as he saw his friend get up and start taking his shirt off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to see-&quot; Jesse stopped as the shirt fell to the floor, revealing his changing nipples. His originally tiny aoreola were not so tiny anymore. They were slowly but surely expanding, even puffing up a bit as he stared at them. He involuntarily flexed his dick inside his jeans as the expansion sent jolts of pleasure straight into it. Gasping at the sensations, Jesse couldn&#39;t do anything besides look at himself changing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, you got big nips man!!&quot; Marcus yelled and burst into laughter, even as his own nipples started to change and stimulate his now leaking dick as he rolled with laughter. &quot;Someone&#39;s gonna get big boobies!!!&quot; He kept going.<br />
<br />
Jesse watched his friend laugh at his expanse and his first thought was- &quot;Oh yeah, lets see yours then!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus stopped laughing. &quot;You wanna see my tits, bro?&quot; His dick throbbed hard at the thought of showing his mate his torso. &quot;Yeah, sure, but the one with the bigger tits has to cover the other&#39;s protein shake for a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so Marcus pulled his shirt off, trying and failing to hold back a moan as the shirt brushed off his chest, the feeling going straight to his dick, getting him dangerously close suddenly. &quot;Oh, bro, hold up.&quot; The bodybuilder struggled to hold himself back, the thight shorts adding to the stimulating squeezing feeling. &quot;Wait no, I can&#39;t cum, I have to resist, sorry bro!&quot; He said quickly, as he pushed down the shorts, revealing he had no underwear on. Breathing a sigh of relief as the cold air of the room eased his hard on, for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa man, what the hell?!&quot; The smaller man was left staring at the bodybuilder&#39;s bubble butt as the man quickly turned away and took off all his clothing. Jesse quickly turned away, trying to think of other things. It worked, he felt the stimulation comming from his nipples stabilize. Looking down, the aoreola were now big, easily 2 inches in diameter, and so puffy the small nipples on top were at least half an inch from his toned chest muscles. But they were not growing anymore. He instinctively reached a hand to touch one.<br />
<br />
Marcus felt like he had been jolted awake, like his mind had cleared up. He looked at his still growing nipples and shuddered in pleasure, feeling a strange urge to vocalize it. Successfully resisting it, he slowly turned around to face his friend, his hard on swaying slightly as he did, his shorts bunched up at his shoes, limiting his movements. &quot;Man, I almost came right there, this thing is powerful! We gotta be careful, it almost got me... Jesse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus heard his friend whimpering slightly, facing the other direction, the bodybuilder clumsily approached the other man, having his movement impaired by his not fully removed shorts. &quot;Jesse?&quot; He said, placing a hand on his friend&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Jesse immediately moaned loudly at the warm touch, catching himself in the middle of it, immediately letting go of the nipple he had been tweaking. He felt close, like anything could tip him off the edge. His dick had never felt harder. His underwear against his cock felt otherwordly, he had to take it off right now.<br />
<br />
Marcus was in the process of discarding his shoes and properly taking off his shorts when he saw his friend doind the same. It seemed like Jesse had been able to snap out of it as well. He got worried for a second. But his relief soon ended when he felt the tingling return, but this time, on his dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, we&#39;re getting to the end of stage 1. If we can get through this all we need to do is wait it out.&quot; He knew what was about to happen, but he didn&#39;t wanna look as he felt pressure on his dick, even though it was out in the open. <br />
<br />
&quot;Already? That went kinda fast- Hey!&quot; Jesse said throwing his jeans and undies back in the couch. &quot;I win, you&#39;re the one with the biggest tits.&quot; He said, pointing at Marcus&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
It was true, Marcus&#39;s nipples were at least half an inch larger, which even on his large pecs looked huge. Marcus looked down, and then over to the other man&#39;s pecs. The pressure on his dick was intensifying to maddening levels, he could not look away. The big nipples had reminded him of his previous girlfriend&#39;s...<br />
<br />
Jesse was equally enthralled, but by the other man&#39;s chest muscles that twitched every so often as the other man tried to hold still. He had taken his pants off but his dick still felt constricted just as much, almost like it was being squeezed down.<br />
<br />
Marcus could feel his climax coming, he had to resist. His toes gripped the floor, his hands clenched into fists, but his dick felt like it was being milked. Then it hit. The last stage one change. He could barely register the thought that it was almost over when the overwhelming feeling of his cock shrinking overtook him. He could see Jesse arching his back, the other man&#39;s cock pulse and shrink, as he felt his cock do the same. It was like cumming. It felt almost the same, like he was cumming his cock out. Pulse. He had to resist. Pulse. He knew it would shrink less than a centimeter before stopping. Pulse. Jesse&#39;s face looked so blissed out. Pulse. Did he look like that when he came? Pulse. His nipples were so red. Pulse. Was he playing with them before? Pulse. It probably felt good. Pulse. It probably felt- No. Pulse. No. Pulse. I&#39;m cumming! Pulse.<br />
<br />
He felt the warm jets of cum hitting his chest before he lost the battle. Jesse had come before him, ha! And then he came.<br />
<br />
And came. It felt like it wasn&#39;t gonna end, each time he spurted he felt Jesse&#39;s spurt hit him. He failed. But it does feel so good.<br />
<br />
A few seconds later, he felt the pleasure go down a bit. But he knew he wasn&#39;t out of it yet.<br />
<br />
Stage 2 was just beggining, and he still had hopes of enduring it.</p>
