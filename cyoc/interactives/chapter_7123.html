<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Incubus looked back at Sid and took the dice with a flick of his spaded tail.  Even here, he could feel the added potency of the muscular lion's augmented physique.  The sensation was an odd one and he was briefly distracted by it as he rolled the dice between his fingers and contemplated what this feeling meant.<br /><br />

It was similar to desire; that much was certain.  However, it wasn't quite the same.  No, and -startling enough- it was similar to hunger, but not exactly.  The demon shook his head and smirked slyly at the handsome lion.  Whatever the feeling was, it was akin to what he'd felt as a child...<br /><br />

But what context?<br /><br />

Showing outward confidence, but inwardly nervous about what was to come, the Incubus tossed the twin dice to the board in front of him and watched them roll.<br /><br />

Christmas.  That was when he'd felt like this before...<br /><br />

Numbers spun by in the form of black dots on the dice as they clattered to a halt.<br /><br />

That was it.  The feeling he got from Sid, now, was exactly the same as he had gotten as a child, sitting around his family's Christmas Tree and waiting to open the gifts.  Gifts that, by their tags, he knew were his but -frustratingly enough- he had to wait to claim.<br /><br />

His solid, lavender eyes blinked at the result of his die roll, his daemonic pawn sliding along the outer concourse of the board before finally stopping on another green space.  "MYSTIC".  Swell.<br /><br />

He glanced again at the hyper-muscular man sitting next to him and shook his head as the words in the center of the board spelled out his fate.  He knew that had he had this feeling about Sid before playing this game, it would have disturbed him to no end.  But -for some reason, possibly his daemonic nature- he actually felt good knowing that Sid was something to be owned and was -in fact- already his.<br /><br />

"Here we go..." muttered Chris, his grating voice annoying the demon and bringing his attention fully back to the board.<blockquote><i><b>TEMPORARY CHANGE<br />-2 turns-</b><br /><br />"As prophets of old have always known,<br />The future should always stay sealed.<br />But to you, for now, that sight is shown,<br />And endings, to you, are revealed."</i></blockquote>"Does that mean what I think it means?" asked Tyler, looking at the Incubus with an expression of concern.<br /><br />

"If you mean 'second sight'," replied the demon, looking up from the board, "I have no..."<br /><br />

He stopped.<br /><br />

Tyler, to his left, had become a corpse.  Even to his domineering, nameless and distant self, the Incubus was taken aback.  There, sitting across from him, was the fresh corpse of Tyler, a look of shock and fear frozen upon his face.  His age was advanced, that much the demon could see, but there was still a touch of color in his hair.  His flesh, though, was pure white, as if Tyler were an albino.  Adding to the horrible sight was a series of shallow slices in the student's flesh, arcing up from the exposed sides of his shoulders, along the sides of his face to meet at the apex of his forehead.  These cuts in his body were deep and intricate yet held no blood.  In fact, as the demon looked him over, he began to recognize the shape of the cuts as daemonic script.<br /><br />

"Incubus!  Yo, wake up!"<br /><br />

Sid again.<br /><br />

The demon shut his eyes.  "I ... I see how you die," he said, having recognized the words carved onto Tyler's dead face.<br /><br />

The shrunken man looked pale as he swallowed, hard.  "You ... you saw how I die?"<br /><br />

The Incubus nodded.  "For the most part.  Let's just say, I know how it'll happen..."<br /><br />

"But he can change it, right?" asked the rabbit, with hope in his voice and a glance towards Tyler.<br /><br />

"He may be a fuck-head," added Sid, still intently looking at the demon, "but Chris has got a point.  Can what you see be changed?"<br /><br />

The Incubus shook his head.  "No...  Well, I don't <i>think</i> so..."  The huge, handsome man could only shrug, then, and growl -annoyed- under his breath.  "I only <i>possess</i> this power; I don't know how it works...  But it seems to me that if I can see how things end, well, that's probably pretty much how it works."<br /><br />

Tyler looked more shaken by this turn of events than anything he'd seen, before.  He shook his head and swallowed several times without speaking as he tried to collect his thoughts.  "I ... I don't believe in predestination..." he finally said.<br /><br />

"Too bad it believes in you," replied the demon, turning his head to look at Tyler, head-on again.  Still, whether it was a tiny shred of his human roots holding on or just because he didn't feel like it, he avoided staring at the other two at the table for the moment.  "Would you like to know what I see?"<br /><br />

"NO!" shouted, Tyler, with a look of disgust on his face.  "God, what makes you think I'd want to know anything like that?!"  He shivered as he looked to the table and quickly picked up the dice.  "It's my turn, anyway.  Hopefully, this will end soon and we can just stop playing once and for all..."<br /><br />

With those words (and gritted teeth), Tyler rolled the dice.<br /><br />

The Incubus nodded and watched the dice roll.  He didn't say a single word on the subject but he'd knew what the words on dead-Tyler's face had said.  Perhaps the future could be changed, he thought; perhaps tomorrow was malleable.  In the end, he'd probably find out first-hand.<br /><br />

The words on Tyler's face had been, "PROPERTY OF DAVID ISAAC KEENE".<br /><br />

The dice rolled to a stop and Tyler's piece moved forward to the first intersection and he chose which direction to move.</p>
