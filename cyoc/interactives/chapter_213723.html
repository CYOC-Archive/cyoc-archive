<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff awoke feeling very drained. He&#39;d been sick all weekend with fevers peaking throughout the night, laryngitis, and some weird sensory stuff going on, apparently he was even attacked on Friday, coming home from his friend&#39;s house covered in blood, not that he remembers it. <br />
<br />
Jeff sat up and blinked several times, things still looked off, mostly normal but off. His experience was however the very definition of indescribable... If you never knew what blue looked like and try to describe it to someone else who never saw it... that was this.<br />
<br />
His brain was activating that there&#39;s more that he&#39;s picking up on... an extra layer of data on top of the colors he understood and his brain&#39;s understanding of the object representation... random spots and things glowing with ultraviolet light... something is different about it... but visually, it is the same color, shape, size and texture as normal. If you pointed a remote at him and pushed a button he would wince and turn away, but he hasn&#39;t figured this out yet so picking up on nearby infrared information and random things in UV not looking the way he was use to just didn&#39;t make sense. Eventually he will be able to hone this but right now it&#39;s just slightly unsettling.<br />
<br />
Jeff stumbled out of bed, extra lethargic, his body spent the night reinforcing his newly enhanced neurons to support transformation into a werewolf... Jeff only saw his body&#39;s initial attempt and dismissed it because of the pretty wild day he had in his own mind. Jeff&#39;s transformation from infected to full blown werewolf was effectively over. Next full moon he would transform, which is extremely rare in the dimension this disease came from. Usually the sickness and transformation prep period take a minimum of 2 additional full moon cycles before a full transformation can occur, but this variant had Jeff squarely in its crosshairs. All that was left were a few tweaks to Jeff&#39;s non werewolf body and mind and he can begin spawning infected offspring, transmitting through sexual contact, and come the full moon, the standard transmission route works too. All of which were already well under way.<br />
<br />
Despite feeling exhausted he didn&#39;t feel sick, so he got ready for school. For the first time in several days he wasn&#39;t coated in sweat so he didn&#39;t shower, not that he had time to anyway, by the time he actually started getting dressed he was already running behind. He ran downstairs and poured a bowl of cereal not realizing it wouldn&#39;t last him till lunch.<br />
<br />
His mother placed a cooler before him as he was eating (the Chronivac made packed lunches the new normal though he didn&#39;t know) without a word as she went about her morning routine. His name was written on its lid in heavy black sharpie... Jeff grunted in confusion chewing but by the time he swallowed she was gone.<br />
<br />
The school bus came and picked Jeff up, he felt more cramped than usual but paid no mind and tried to get another 30 minutes of sleep despite the noise and resting his head on a bouncing window in an uncomfortable position, he managed. Jeff re-awoke as some kid from the bus gently shook him while they were exiting. <br />
<br />
Jeff got up and out last offering a smile to the driver. The nap made him feel less tired, but more brain foggy. He slowly made it to his locker and put things away realizing the bottom of his locker perfectly fit the lunchbox. He grabbed supplies and reported to class not yet realizing that he forgot his homework on his desk half done from last night. <br />
<br />
The teacher began with lecture and when asked a question, Jeff offered to answer he was starting to feel alert and cognizant. &quot;Would it be 12?&quot; Jeff asked? The room was silent.  The teacher had paused for half a second in shock but everyone noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, um, yes Jeff, that&#39;s right.&quot; Then there was snickering... Jeff&#39;s voice had dropped to bass, and was now deeper than the teacher who was a tenor.<br />
<br />
The laryngitis from last night were his vocal cords thickening, and during the transformation, they were stretched and lengthened. Back in Jeff&#39;s room a checkbox appeared as this was the first of the changes requested to be fulfilled. This was a nightmare come true for Jeff, probably all teen males. Rather than a gradual deepening, every class, every friend, every family member, will have the same initial reaction of &quot;WTF is going on with you?! Oh, you aren&#39;t playing a game... Okay, let me pretend I didn&#39;t notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Settle down class.&quot; the teacher said, Jeff was dying of embarrassment... which his body interpreted generally as arousal turning his embarrassment into horror as he could feel himself becoming erect. The blood that just flooded his cheeks now raced away, leaving him pale and a little light headed...<br />
<br />
He raised his hand and when he had the teachers attention just tapped his chest and pointed to the door... the teacher just nodded. Jeff went to the restroom and spent several minutes testing his voice, drinking water from cupped hands, and rubbing his throat. He eventually used an app on his phone to take a video and play it back to himself. Closing his eyes he sounded so &#39;adult&#39; it was disturbing, but a little exciting... oh, no, his body was telling him this was really exciting. He went in the stall, and only took another minute to take care of business, realizing for the first time that his balls are slapping around to the rhythm of his pumping.<br />
<br />
Once finished... he cleaned himself up and prepared himself mentally for the rest of the day... by first break period he devoured half his packed lunch, come lunch time every morsel was devoured, and by school&#39;s end he was hungry again. Desperate to eat as he walked in the door and this is how the rest of his changes would be fueled.</p>
