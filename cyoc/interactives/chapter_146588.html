<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Circe, Kellie, Mika and Baba Yaga glared at the severed head resting inside the glass they had conjured. &quot;Who sent you,&quot; Kellie growled. The severed head sneered, its eyes flickering between the witches and wizards. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s pretty obvious who sent it,&quot; Circe spat. &quot;Lilith dare attack my followers!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the magic,&quot; Baba whispered. &quot;Cant you feel it. That&#39;s not Liliths. It feels...foreign. Like the magic from that other timeline.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why would they attack,&quot; Circe exclaimed. &quot;That makes no sense. No, this is Lilith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really wish to go down that path,&quot; Baba asked. &quot;Do you really want to challenge her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Circe paused. No, she didn&#39;t. Circe did not want to admit it but Liliths ferocity and magic could overpower her. The ancient witch was insane, no matter what Circe did Lilith would not yield, she never did. To challenge Lilith would cause the others to take sides. Circe did not want that, the others would look at her suspiciously considering she was consorting with Merlins daughter, even if was to only keep the peace between the kitsune and herself. &quot;No,&quot;she mumbled. &quot;No I do not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Baba nodded as she nervously gazed at the severed fox head. &quot;We have a bigger problem now,&quot; Baba groaned. &quot;If that demon was sent by Lilith than she knows everything. She would view what we have done as a betrayal and you know that&#39;s how she will frame it when questioned. The others will not stop her if she wishes to lash out and take vengeance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Circe,&quot; she declared. &quot;Goddess of Grekk mythology. She would not dare attack us or risk the wrath of the gods of Olympus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Baba could only shake her head as she sadly gazed at Circe. &quot;You know nothing of her,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Lilith has spent a lifetime fighting the gods. The only reason she has not ascended to the most powerful fo us all is because of her disagreements with those in power. They have kept her in check, but that is all they can do. Lilith is ancient and evil. If she chooses to destroy us there is very little we can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Circe grit her teeth in anger as her cheeks burned with rage. &quot;I cant believe you would just roll over and serve,&quot; she spat. &quot;Our power is immense. I can create an army more powerful than any the realms have seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So can she,&quot; Baba countered. &quot;Hell is filled with souls that would gladly serve. Do you think your army can defeat the denizens of the netherrealm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Circe opened her mouth before closing it. Baba had a point, trying to defeat Hell would be a herculean effort. &quot;We will come back to this shortly,&quot; she said. &quot;Right now we have a larger problem. My ambassador has been murdered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Circe glanced down at her hand, the soul of Vixi sadly looking up at her with wide eyes. &quot;What shall become of me goddess,&quot; she whimpered. &quot;Please help me, I dont want to end up in the netherealm as a servant of Lilith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can remake your body,&quot; Circe sighed. &quot;It will take time but I shall take care of you.&quot; The wailing sounds of a thankful soul now flooded the room as Vixi thanked her goddess.<br />
<br />
Kellie and Mika looked at each other apprehensively as Baba and Circe talked. As incredible as it seemed the situation had become both better and worse. Baba and Circe were willing to work with them yet Lilith seemed hell bent on their destruction. &quot;Can this get any worse,&quot; Kellie thought. Her question was answered as a anthro hermaphrodite tiger bounded into the room, happily calling out to Mika.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claud,&quot; Mika stammered. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia smiled as she approached her girlfriend, she wanted to surprise Mika and judging by her expression she had. &quot;You like I did this for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um okay,&quot; Mika said slowly. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to give you the best of both worlds,&quot; Claudia exclaimed, a frown forming on her face. &quot;What you dont like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Mika paused. &quot;I mean it&#39;s different. I mean I love you but, I dont know its...its just, different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia frowned, narrowing her brow as she leaned forward. The teens massive breasts pressing close to Mika who was blushing crimson. Mika tries to avert her eyes only to gape wide eyed and slack jawed at Claudia equipment between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Claudia,&quot; she said meekly. &quot;I dont know what possessed you to do this but it&#39;s kinda freaking me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I&#39;m a freak,&quot; Claudia exclaimed, her eyes beginning to well with tears. &quot;Why would you say that? Mika, I know you&#39;ve been with guys and girls. I wanted you to experience both, with me for the first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika shifted nervously, her face flushing as she searched for words. &quot;Ugh I cant believe I have to say this,&quot; she groaned in embarrassment. Taking a deep breath she shyly turned her eyes towards the towering anthro tiger, a pang of fear and embarrassment washing over her. &quot;Claudia I&#39;m a virgin,&quot; she said meekly. &quot;I, I never have gone past second base.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Claudia exclaimed. &quot;But you never said anything. Why wouldnt you tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont know,&quot; Mika whined, her cheeks burning. &quot;I was embarrassed. I...I wanted to seem, I dont know, more experienced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie had watched the awkward exchange between the young couple. To say this was a bit of a shock would be an understatement. In the other timeline Claudia and Mika were a bit more adventurous in their relationship. The couple had lost their virginity in a threesome, which had surprised everyone at the time. This Mika and Claudia though appeared much less adventurous and far shyer. Pinching the bridge of her nose, she could feel a tension headache building behind her eyes. Between a shadow demon, a dead ambassador and now an awkward exchange between a teenage couple, things were not going well. &quot;Circe a word in private,&quot; she beckoned. Circe nodded as the two stepped away from the group. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Kellie sighed. &quot;I know what were trying to do here. Now is really not the time. Can we not go there tonight, at least until we figure out how were going to replace Vixi. Besides not exactly thrilled you transformed one of my friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you babbling about,&quot; Circe snorted. Kellie turned furrowing her brow as she glared at the goddess. &quot;Seriously,&quot; she said flatly. &quot;You just watched what happened and your going to feign ignorance. Cmon Circe we know what&#39;s going to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Circe frowned. &quot;Let&#39;s say I know what you are hinting at. What is the problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Inexperienced teenage girls,&quot; Kellie sighed. &quot;Anthro hermaphrodites is a bit advanced for these two. It&#39;s like asking someone to solve a calculus problem right after they learned to add.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Circe said quickly. &quot;I see. Say no more, I will try to relieve the tension.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kellie breathed. &quot;Besides, with Vixi incapacitated we need another ambassador.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a point daughter of Merlin,&quot; Circe conceded. &quot;Perhaps after an agreement is reached we can let these two explore their feelings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Kellie said slowly, raising an eyebrow. As she now tried to massage away her headache she began to try and formulate a backup plan.</p>
