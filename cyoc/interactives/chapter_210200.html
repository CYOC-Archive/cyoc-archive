<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Reaching the school of the five friends, Mark was about to leave with Luke, when he witnessed something that made him angry.<br />
“Hey there, little freaks. Are you sure you belong into a school?” asked one of three slightly older kids, which stood right before Chris and his friends, sneering at them.<br />
Chris sighed, but remained calm. “Leave us at peace, will you? You aren´t getting any more creative, Simon, are you? That´s the same greeting it had been for years.” The others all had only rolled their eyes at the trio of bullies. To them, that was normal.<br />
The second boy, a bit wider than Simon, took something out of his pocket, before shoving it into Justin´s mouth with a mean grin. “Hey, Justin, you are always hungry, aren´t you? Here, you can have that rotten apple for breakfast.” Then all three bullies were laughing as Justin choked on the apple. Something was stopping him from chewing it.<br />
Rick tried to get the apple back out of Justin´s mouth, but it was stuck between his teeth. “You idiot. Do you want him to suffocate, Jack? That wouldn´t be good for your further life.” Rick said annoyed by their laughing.<br />
“Oh, shove it, you naked bimbo. I´m sure he loves the attention you give him.” The third boy said, glancing at the rest of the group. “I can´t understand how you move like that, Dean. But your little birdy is helping you, right?”<br />
Dean glared at the boy. “Leave us alone, Harry. I don´t understand how you move as you do, either.” He answered slowly, while Theo now tried to help Rick and Justin by lightly hitting Justin´s back, hoping he would spit the rotten apple out.<br />
Mark was fuming. Had his brother always problems with such bullies, or was it by extension his doing? While nobody noticed the changes, that would mean they would see them as normal, or ignore them completely. He had to find out. Turning to Luke, he said: “Wait here, I have to check something.” After Luke nodded, Mark moved towards a near tree, while unpacking his laptop. Quickly scanning the three bullies, Mark added the “Mark rules” comment to them, before approaching the group, laptop pushed back into his bag.<br />
“Oh look, the little freak needs his big brother to protect him.” Simon sneered at the approaching Mark. Chris turned to look at his brother, fear in his eyes. What would his brother say, seeing him bullied for his deformed body?<br />
“I just can´t get how their parents left that freak living, and what was wrong with them to get such a freak after having a normal son?” Harry added his two cents. Chris was nearly crying now, and the others weren´t that much better. They all looked somewhat up to Mark, but had never told him what they endured at school.<br />
Mark calmly responded: “Freeze silent, you three. You don´t understand how hard it is to life like that, but I still love my little brother the way he is. And his friends, who understand him for being in similar situations, are the most loyal ones I have seen in a long time.” Then, turning to the five friends, Mark helped removing the rotten apple out of Justin´s mouth. Rick had it get loose a bit, so Justin could breathe, but hadn´t gotten it out yet. “Don´t worry, little brother, I will have a word with them, they won´t bother you again. Now, go on in.”<br />
Chris nodded, thankful his brother was so understanding, before the five rushed inside, leaving the three bullies alone with Mark. All had their eyes wide open, not understanding what power Chris´s big brother had over them right now. “Come with me.” They were forced to follow Mark inside the building, and soon stood in the bathroom on the first floor, which was being reconstructed at the moment.<br />
“Now, tell me truthfully, were you bullying my brother and his friends all the time, or just since they changed?” Mark asked them, raising his left eyebrow.<br />
The way Mark had asked the question allowed the trio to remember Chris and the others as normal before, making the answer honest to the normal from before. “No, we just started it yesterday, after they went through their weird changes. Before we had other targets.” Simon answered, eyes wide in fear what Mark would do to them.<br />
“So, you just bully for fun? And have now chosen my brother and his friends as easy targets?” Mark asked to clarify, already fuming over them.<br />
“Yes” came the meek response from both Harry and Jack. They similar feared what Mark would do now.<br />
Mark was angry. That just showed that he was responsible for his brother´s bullies in a way. He had seen the chronivac, and the changes he made to them, as fun. But he hadn´t wanted to make their life´s miserable by them. Now, for the first time since he started using the chronivac, he considered making a permanent change with it. After all, these boys were bullies before, just not to his brother. But for now, he would give them one chance to learn from their punishment.<br />
“Let´s see if you are redeemable or not, then. I will punish you now, and sometime later see if you show true remorse, or if you are better of remaining with your punishment permanently. So, seeing as we are in a bathroom that is being reconstructed, and as far as I know, should be finished later today, you will stay in here. You see that they are still missing half the toilets in the stalls, right?” Mark explained, glancing around the room. It had been his plan to use them in the bathroom, after all.<br />
While the three looked sidewards, three of the six stalls had their toilets vanish from them, back into the wall behind, leaving only empty pipes in their place. It had been an effect of the “Mark rules” comment to make them vanish, not that the boys know anything about that. All three boys turned back to Mark, nodding at the question he had asked. All three shivered in fear, guessing what he would do, even if they didn´t belief it was possible.<br />
“Well, you three will become the missing toilets for now. Let´s see how you three like if you have shit in your mouths. After all, as much as you spew shit all the time, maybe getting some in will do you good. Harry, left stall, Simon, center one and Jack, the right one. Sat down on the pipe, and become the toilets you are designed to be for some time.” Mark said, a light evil grin on his face. It would be the right punishment for them, and he hoped they would learn in the week or two he would leave them stay there.<br />
All three paled at that, eyes wide in fear. He couldn´t be serious, could he? Their bodies moved on their own, stripping off their clothes before stepping into the stalls they were assigned to. A last look at each other, they saw pure horror of their faces at their predicament. All three boys moaned as they sat down on the pipe, which easily slipped up into their ass.<br />
As Mark watched, the three started to change. The pipe merged to their ass, making moving away impossible to them. Their skin, already pale from their fear, turned pure white. Their feet and legs merged together, forming the socket their bodies would rest on. Their heads slowly moved down their bodies, leaning their backs against the empty wall. Soon, their heads rested were before their cocks and balls had been, atop their now merged legs.<br />
Without any resistance, their mouths opened wide, wider than humanly possible, becoming the bowl of their new toilet bodies. Their noses flattened into the toilet seat, while the rest of their heads formed the lid to cover it up. Their backs, still glued to the wall, turned into the toilet tank, leaving their cocks to be the connecting pipe between tank and bowl. Their balls, now hanging just inside their bowls, turned into a urinal cake, to keep them smell fresh. Mark hadn´t been mean with it, the cake wouldn´t become smaller from use, at least for now.<br />
To anyone smelling the toilet after flushing it, it would spread a light lemon aroma in the air. To the transformed bullies, however, they would taste their own cum from being flushed. Mark looked up their profiles on the laptop, and made sure they would taste with their whole bowl, so no escaping the taste of either shit and piss, or their own cum for the time being. They would also smell from both sides of their seat, so adding to the smell inside the bowl was the smell of however sat on them. Their eyes were at the front of their bowl-body, giving them a view outside their stall. Mark made sure that, while there was no mirror opposite of them, they would still see the mirrored image of what they were all the time, except when someone uses them.<br />
Lastly, he made sure nobody would miss them for the time being, the school believing them to be ill at home, while their parents wouldn´t miss them for now. Then he deleted his “Mark rules” comment, smiling down at the three former boys.<br />
“I hope you will learn your lesson; I would hate to make this arrangement permanent for you. Don´t worry, you won´t be missed for now, so no one will search for you. Now I have to go, I have to help my friend to his uni classes. Have fun.” Mark laughed a bit as he left the bathroom, leaving the three bullies to fear their new role on life. Already pleading for Mark to turn them back.<br />
Soon, the builders came in, finished their work, and on time for the lunch break, the bathroom was open and quickly had a frequent stream of people using it, making their situation worse. All three, Simon, Harry and Jack, had a big meal mixed from other people´s piss and shit, and their own cum. It was a living hell to them. And every time someone flushed them, it felt as if their whole insides were pushed done through their cock into their mouth, while the flushed-out contents of their mouths were sent directly out their ass into the pipe. And the refilling was like being pumped full, making their non-existing stomach/bladder/lungs feel like it would burst from the pressure.<br />
Mark collected Luke, who had patiently waited for him outside, before walking to Aidan´s flat, around twenty minutes later than the day before, but still with time to spare.</p>
