<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John dreamed.<br />
<br />
He was chained to... something. A bed mounted vertically. He was spread-eagled against it, the chains holding him tight against the mattress. He tried pulling against them but they were linked together somehow; tugging with one hand just jerked the chain attached to his other wrist.<br />
<br />
Something stomped out of the darkness, coming just to the edge of a circle of light that surrounded his mattress. He could only make out its lower legs, which were hairy -- no, furry -- and ended in hooves. The rest of the figure was merely a darker patch in the gloom.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do, Orc?&quot; it called out in a booming voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not--&quot; he started, then looked down at himself. Of course he was an orc. Wasn't he before?<br />
<br />
The thing took a step forwards, clopping on the stone floor. It was a satyr, he realized. It looked like the one from his dream before, except bigger, more menacing. Its eyes glowed red.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said, what did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at it defiantly. &quot;I did what aloe and vera called upon me to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you know the price,&quot; it whispered. It stared at its crotch, concentrating ferociously. Out of a sheath, something thick and orange began pushing its way up. It grew to a foot long, then the satyr grasped it in a taloned hand and pulled it free.<br />
<br />
&quot;Behold... the carrot,&quot; it intoned.<br />
<br />
John tried to back away, scrabbling, but he couldn't get any purchase on the mattress. The chains held him in place. There was a fifth one, he suddenly noticed, attached to his cock. Four other chains... this one's not connected to anything else, he thought. If keep pulling at it, I'll be free!<br />
<br />
Quickly, he became erect and started flexing his muscles, pushing his cock higher and higher. The goat-man didn't seem to have noticed; it was entirely focused on the carrot, which was getting worryingly close. Just a little further, thought John, twitching his manhood up and up. Just a little further...<br />
<br />
Abruptly, the satyr was reaching behind him, pushing the carrot up to his ass and then shoving it inside. His insides seemed to light on fire and his cock strained. Hah, thought John, how lucky that the punishment is helping me to escape! He kept jerking at the chain with his rock-hard erection. It was starting to give.<br />
<br />
The creature pounded the carrot further and further in, first with a fist, then with fingertips, then finally slapping its palm against John's asshole to get it in the last fraction of an inch. Oh, he thought distantly, that must be my prostate. I always wondered where I kept it. Then his cock exploded, shattering its chain as semen gushed out of it.<br />
<br />
At that point, he woke up.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Brian dreamed.<br />
<br />
He was running through a field, trying to catch his train. He was already late. His boss, he knew, would be sitting on his desk, tapping his palm impatiently with a ruler. But if he could somehow get on board the train and have his ticket stamped, he could show that to his boss and everything would be all right.<br />
<br />
The field led into a meadow, warm and sunny. He slowed to a jog. He was already late, he thought, so he might as well enjoy himself on the way. There were all kinds of wildflower here; he paused to pick one and munched on it thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I could get a ride, he wondered. That would make it easier to catch the train. But what is there around here?<br />
<br />
He stared around the meadow, squinting against the sun. There was a shape in the far corner, big and dark. He trotted towards it, churning up the grass underfoot as he went. It was, he saw, a bull.<br />
<br />
He approached it cautiously, unsure of how it would react. It was facing his direction but didn't seem to be paying any attention to him, being busy eating something. He came closer to look. It was chewing on a carrot.<br />
<br />
Relief flooded into him. If it was eating carrots it had to be a gay bull, and since he was gay too now they would get along fine. He stepped round to its side and tried to scramble onto its back, but couldn't get a grip. Oh right, he thought, you have to mount them from behind.<br />
<br />
He walked behind the bull and reared up, getting his front hooves onto its back. This was harder than it looked. He shuffled forward with his hind legs, somehow keeping his balance, until his erection thumped painfully into the other bull's backside and glanced off. It turned its head to look at him reproachfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he called, &quot;I'm still new at this.&quot;<br />
<br />
He backed up a bit and then shoved forwards. This time his aim was better and his cock slid past the tail and into the bull's asshole, going partway in on sheer momentum. He thrust again, jamming it further in. Good, he thought, tossing his great horned head from side to side. I'll be there in no time! He drew back and humped forward repeatedly, getting a little deeper each time. As he approached his destination, the sky overhead grew dark and he felt a few drops of rain on his snout. Not again, he thought, as the clouds opened up and it came down thick and fast. There was a sudden crack of thunder and he jolted forward. I'm there, he realized, and began pumping his seed into the bull.<br />
<br />
At that point, he woke up.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
John and Brian jerked back in unison, clutching one another. Each had a moment of wonder and confusion before they orgasmed together. For a moment, neither could tell where they ended and the other began.<br />
<br />
Slowly, awareness returned. They were turned towards one another, though Brian's face was only at the level of John's chest. They were pressed tightly together, smushing John's manhood between them. Its head lay against Brian's cheek. It was still spurting, most of the output hitting John under the chin but an increasing amount splattering onto Brian's face, hair, and shoulders. Brian's cock was lodged somewhere warm and tight. It took them both a few moments to figure out the sensations and realize that it was inside John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, hi,&quot; said John. &quot;Good morning. I think I have something that belongs to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both felt his cock pulse again, and another blob of cum landed in Brian's hair. &quot;Besides that, I mean,&quot; he added lamely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, I'm sorry. I didn't even realize...&quot; Brian said, trailing off. He pulled his hips downwards but accomplished nothing other than extracting a whimper and another large spurt of cum from John. &quot;Sorry. I think I'm stuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don't ever apologize for -- uhn -- mind-blowing sex. Seriously. Except for mind-blowing sex without a condom, which is not so cool, but -- uhn -- I have no idea if orcs can even get AIDS. Hell, I don't even know if I have white blood cells. Where was I -- uhn -- going? Oh yeah. If you stop wiggling you'll come unstuck in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; A pause. &quot;So, um, was I good, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
John laughed. &quot;Fuck yes. Better than I was, that's for sure. But next time I'd recommend doing it conscious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian chuckled and squeezed him. John squeezed back, then began stroking his room-mate's back.<br />
<br />
&quot;So much for getting a good night's sleep,&quot; said Brian. &quot;The alarm's going to go off in half an hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I have half an hour to cuddle with you. I'm not going to complain,&quot; replied John. Something about Brian's back felt odd under his hands. Prickly. Maybe it was just him? He wasn't used to these thick, almost leathery palms yet. But, wait, why was he still an orc? He'd thought sex was the trigger for the transformations, but he'd very definitely just had sex and hadn't changed back.<br />
<br />
His thoughts were interrupted when Brian started trying to pull free again, bracing himself against John's arms and giving a hard push. Once again, Brian's cock jerked back and forth inside John, making him gasp and throw his head back, but didn't slide out at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hon, really, you're going to have to wait until it softens,&quot; John panted.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I did. It is soft -- well, softer. I don't think it's going to go all the way down when I've got naked you holding me.&quot;<br />
<br />
John frowned. This shouldn't be so difficult. His body was big all over, including his butt, and Brian's cock wasn't especially large. Maybe it was all these muscles clamping down too hard? He tried to relax.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK. We're going to try to slide you out. I'm going to push too. I'll be gentle, but I'm really strong so if you feel any pain or, y'know, if it just doesn't feel right, yell out at once. I don't want to break you on the first night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can happen? Um, don't worry, I will. Shit. I promise never, ever to try this without a condom again. And lube. And yoga. And -- oooh. That feels kind of good, actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a wet pop, John felt Brian's cock come free, followed by some unpleasant goo. He rolled off the bed and onto his feet, rubbing his butt. Yow, that felt sore. It was cosmic payback for the claw-marks he'd left on Brian's earlier, he supposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm. Where're you going?&quot; asked Brian, rolling a little from side to side on his back. &quot;You still owe me twenty-five minutes of cuddles. It's warm down here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll give you them later, I promise. Now we've got to get you cleaned up, though. Come on, boyfriend,&quot; he said, taking Brian's hand and hauling him up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boyfriend, huh?&quot; said Brian, slipping his other hand round John's waist. &quot;Is it official now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I'm having to get you washed and ready for work in the morning then I figure I deserve more than 'one night stand'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I'll call in sick. What will you be then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sick? C'mon, only one of us turned green. You'll have to try harder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, fine, you win. I will, under much protest, take a shower and be apart from you for ten hours. Happy now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll live,&quot; said John, and kissed him. &quot;I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too. Heh. Feels weird and tingly to say that.&quot; Brian kissed John quickly on the lips. &quot;Now I'm gonna turn on the light, so watch out.&quot;<br />
<br />
John sensed something wrong again -- Brian hadn't had to push himself up on tip-toe to kiss him, he realized. He started to run his hand up Brian's arm, feeling the odd prickliness there, too -- and was it bigger than before? Then the light stabbed on and he threw his hands over his sensitive eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You all right, John?&quot; he heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I'll be fine in a minute. Stupid eyes with their stupid night vision. Oh, yeah, I meant to ask -- do my eyes glow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, no, not in the dark. They reflect the light like a cat's, though, only red. It looks pretty weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Name one thing about my life that isn't,&quot; said John, slowly pulling back his hands as his pupils adjusted to the brightness. As the blurry figure in front of him came into focus, his eyes widened further. This, he thought, goes beyond pretty weird.</p>
