<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;d hope that things are calmer today,&quot; Martha said to no one and mostly speaking her mind, &quot;Yesterday was too hectic.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four of them had managed to sit down together for a plat of scrambled eggs mixed with ham and two slices of toast each. It wasn&#39;t something they ate every morning, but it was something made quickly and was filling.  And this was key as all the Andersons cycled through their respective showers and moved about getting breakfast ready. Nate was the last to come down, but he did make it down on time and the main thing on Martha&#39;s mind was hope that the day would not involve the sort of stresses that the day before had. The shooting, the lock-down, and everything that then snowballed from there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; William nodded and rubbed Martha&#39;s shoulders before moving to sit down, &quot;but with the agent caught and cooperating... things should get better... especially with the wedding coming up soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded and purred for a moment, even in her human form, as the sweep of her husband&#39;s hands across her shoulders was enough to help her feel comfortable. And it felt extra good to be in full agreement. Martha knew that William was beginning to see Jennifer Harper as something of an an adopted daughter, if only apologize to Jenny for failing prevent Yvette from clawing her, and Martha did understand that, but she&#39;d also come to see Jennifer Harper as something of a daughter as well. She was sweet and kind, maybe a bit nervous and unsure of some things, but that was understandable. All Jenny wanted was to be happy, and just as it fueled the parental fire in William, it did the same for Martha. Jenny deserved to be happy and if her biological parents weren&#39;t going to do that than she and William would help the Jenkins family do just that.<br />
<br />
But for the moment they still had plenty of things they needed to do before that step could really be taken. They still had work to do, and for Martha that meant getting to the Middle School. After breakfast, she gave William a brief kiss before moving to get to the Anderson family car. She watched Eric move off toward the bus stop that was near their home and soon saw Julie come up from her house to join them. William walked by them on his way the college. He passed by them, patted both on the shoulder, and continued on. While that was going on, Martha backed out of the garage, got out, shut the garage door, and then returned to the car. She saw Nate talking to Ben out of the corner of her eyes as she drove by the Twist home and toward the Middle School to begin a new day, hopefully without the school going into lock-down.<br />
<br />
Martha arrived at the Middle School on time, and in fact even a few minutes early from when she was expected to be there, and found the teacher she was working with for the week waiting by the doors that lead into the hallway by the Middle School gym. Kat looked just the same as she had from earlier in the week and from what Martha could remember. Strong and powerful with more muscle tone than even Nate had gained in becoming a werewolf, but of course tigers were bigger than wolves, and it didn&#39;t take away from the softness and curves that went along with her femininity. Kat was a lesbian and had some interest in Martha, which Martha was eager to reward as part of recognizing and embracing that she was bisexual, but Martha did keep her loyalty to her husband and to the issues in raising her children that she wasn&#39;t going to simply do things that would deliberately make Nate or Eric uncomfortable. There were still some issues to talk through on that front, but they&#39;d have to wait. They went to the High School and she was subbing at the Middle School for the week.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, Martha,&quot; Kat said with a friendly smile, &quot;you doing okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing well,&quot; Martha nodded with a small smile, &quot;and looking for a day without the school going into lock-down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll avoid that,&quot; Kat answered, &quot;I&#39;m still not fully sure on what set it off, but to my knowledge it was the ONLY time in Moon Lake&#39;s history that something like that has happened. It doesn&#39;t happen in Moon Lake all that often...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha moved to stand beside Kat inside the entryway, but leaving the doorway open so that students could enter on their way to their homeroom classes. The morning looked fairly clear with only a few clouds in the sky that seemed illuminated by the rising sun. It looked quite well, and Kat&#39;s comment was reassuring to Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s good,&quot; Martha commented.<br />
<br />
There was a silent for a few moments. Before moving in to clock in and get ready for her duties as an assistant coach for the girls gym classes, Martha decided share what she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before we get started for the day, I did figure out what had caused the lock-down, yesterday,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;and despite the potential threat that was posed... THAT was likely nothing more than a coincidence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat turned to Martha and raised an eyebrow in suspicion. Martha&#39;s report had caught her by surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what was this?&quot; Kat wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It relates to all the sort of tension going on with the Harper/Jenkins wedding,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;Some guy in Alabama REALLY doesn&#39;t want to see the young woman get married and sent some henchmen to try and kill the future groom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No wonder the Skulk&#39;s been so uniformly on edge,&quot; Kat commented slowly, &quot;No were likes it when another were &quot;goes rogue&quot; and with a werefox clawing two people... they&#39;re bound to want to make it up to the victims in some way. It&#39;s their way of saying I&#39;m sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded, as she knew that already.<br />
<br />
&quot;But if someone is trying to interfere with the wedding... that person would only make the Skulk as a whole nervous for fear that they might lose the ability to help the victim... in this case, Jennifer Harper,&quot; Kat sighed as she finished her point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully from what I&#39;ve heard the shooter was caught and IS cooperating with law enforcement,&quot; Martha finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which will be good,&quot; Kat nodded and then looked over to Martha, &quot;which solves the mystery of yesterday. In the meantime... we&#39;ll need to get started.&quot;</p>
