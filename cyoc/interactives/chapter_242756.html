<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The instant Felicity asked her question, Lucy leapt back to the top of the chair and Diana trotted in a drunken stagger toward where Natalie had been. Jennifer, Lucy, Diana, and Felicity staring at the pile of clothes, neither uttered a thing for a moment until Jennifer said, &quot;Um, what exactly did she specify for her transformation? Cause it looked like she turning into some sort of lizard-thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it was a dragon,&quot; Felicity breathed out as Lucy turned, leapt to the desk, and pulled up Natalie&#39;s profile.<br />
<br />
Jennifer, after she&#39;d picked up Diana, joined her, followed by Felicity, who, after some thought, collected Tanya. Setting the plush toy on the desk, they all stared at the information displayed on the screen. Reading it over, it became clear to them what happened. Multiple voices beginning to talk at once, Jennifer and Felicity wanted to know if Natalie had made the choice to be sent to a world where fairy dragons were common or if the Chronivac had chosen it for it, whilst Lucy rasped out, &quot;What, was, she, thinking?! Why, would, she, do, this,&quot; as she jumped back and forth from the desk to the chair, then back again, all in clear agitation.<br />
<br />
From where she sat on the desk, Tanya wanted to scream in horror. Becoming a plush toy wasn’t at all what she thought it would be, as she was now a prisoner in a form she knew nothing about. Starting to panic, it took her a moment to regain some control, then she slipped into panic again when she recalled how she was supposed to be able to communicate psychically, as well as be able to move, but couldn&#39;t do any of those things. Lacking anything familiar, such as bones, sinews, nerve endings, organs, muscles, she couldn&#39;t begin to fathom how she still could be conscious, be able to think, when she didn&#39;t even have a brain, as her head, like the rest of her body, was filled with batting. Listening to the others, unsure how she could hear them when her ears were two, floppy pieces of fabric, she couldn’t help but think, &quot;What if I am sent away because the Chronivac deems I ought to be in a place normal for plush toys?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you hear something?&quot; Jennifer asked as they continued to discuss what had happened to Natalie, and the other two stopping, looking at her, she said, &quot;For a split second, I thought I heard Natalie,&quot; and everyone peering at the plush, their conversation shifted as Lucy pulled up Natalie&#39;s profile, read the information, and then they began to all talk at once as they wondered why she sat where she was, didn&#39;t communicate, though Jennifer was still convinced she&#39;d heard Natalie speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t so much aloud, but more inside my head,&quot; she explained when Lucy and Felicity asked her to describe it.<br />
<br />
This convincing all of them, Diana included, the Chronivac had done what it&#39;d been instructed to do completely. Felicity and Jennifer, who was still holding Diana, starting to talk and speculate on why Natalie still couldn&#39;t move or talk, Lucy jumped back to the chair. Feeling strange, she sat down on her clothes, and began running a hand through her fur. Watching as she did this as it regressed, she was relieved more so when she saw her boy parts shrink, pull tight against her body, then merge and meld into the familiar sight of her vulva. Feeling a tight discomfort in her groin and lower abdomen, not understanding it was her internal reproductive organs reforming, she shook herself as her height and weight began to increase and her tail pulled back into her body.<br />
<br />
Suddenly aware of what was happening, the two new girls of the group stopped in mid conversation. Looking at the monkey, now bald with pink skin, they watched as a very naked Lucy reappeared before them. Neither the least bothered by how they were seeing a naked girl before them, Jennifer did look over at the door to make sure it was still shut. When Lucy had finally transformed back, with her long hair being the last to appear, she breathed a sigh of relief. Starting to redress herself, she stated, &quot;I never want to do that again,&quot; with a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
Hope at the idea this would eventually happen to her washed over Tanya as she saw Lucy turn back into herself. Trying to regain some control, she tried to assure herself she wouldn&#39;t be trapped the way she was, and as soon as the timer ran out, she&#39;d turn back. Latching onto this like some crazed person drowning and grabbing the first thing they could get to keep them above water, she held tight to it. As she did this, she then tried to prioritise as she decided trying to move should be her first goal. Believing she was doing the right thing, she thought, &quot;And afterward, I&#39;ll see if I can learn to talk with the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, Jennifer thought she heard Natalie say something. Looking at the plush, she tried to send the communication { can you hear me }<br />
<br />
Next to her, misunderstanding what she was doing, Felicity told her, &quot;I think I heard her this time as well. But, like you said, it was more inside my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t hear anything,&quot; Lucy commented as she stood and joined them.<br />
<br />
Neither saying a word, a silent agreement passed between them to wait. When nothing happened after a few minutes, Lucy huffed out, &quot;Come on. Let&#39;s go to my room,&quot; and collecting Diana and Tanya&#39;s clothes, she turned to do the same with Natalie&#39;s but stopped. Dropping what she was holding on the chair, she said, &quot;Um, didn&#39;t one of you say you saw Natalie vanish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Felicity replied as she collected Tanya, turned to follow Lucy, and stopped when the girl asked, “Did her stuff disappear as well?”<br />
<br />
Indicating the spot where the clothes ought to be, Felicity stated, “But, her clothes, they were left behind.”<br />
<br />
The area where Natalie had dropped her outfit now empty, confusion ensued as Lucy, Jennifer, and Felicity began all talking at once. Each one wanting to know what had happened to the Natalie’s things, it was Lucy who checked the Chronivac. Seeing both Tanya and Diana still had a profile, as well as a timer counting down, she was alarmed to discover Natalie&#39;s profile had been erased. Calling attention to this, three voices called out at once, &quot;What the shit?!&quot; &quot;What the hell?!&quot; &quot;What the fuck?!&quot; as Tanya again panicked and thought { oh please don&#39;t tell me this is going to happen to me }<br />
<br />
Her thoughts finally getting through, Felicity tried to sooth her as Lucy sat down in front of the computer. Staring at the screen, not sure what to do, she reached for the mouse, minimised Tanya and Diana&#39;s profile, then began to click and scroll through the Chronivac until, with an air of defeat, she whispered, &quot;I cannot find, or recall, Natalie&#39;s information,&quot; and looking at the others, she squeaked out, &quot;Natalie&#39;s gone.&quot;</p>
