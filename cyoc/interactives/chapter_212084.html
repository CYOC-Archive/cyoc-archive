<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan went running out into the living room in a panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, is that you?&quot; Matty asked in shock as a young boy came running it in a pair of posing trunks. &quot;Dad, what&#39;s happening?”<br />
<br />
Your dad looked embarrassed and frightened at the same time.<br />
<br />
After I went to my room to change, I felt this odd feeling and when I looked in the mirror I suddenly turned back into a kid. I think the spell didn’t just make you older, it made me younger. So now you have my body size and I have yours!”<br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;re stuck like this for a week?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Son of a bitch.&quot; Ryan sir as the reality began setting. His dad let out a high pitch screech, &quot;Nope we&#39;re definitely not. Maybe if I read another spell it will reverse things sooner than a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I do that? I&#39;ve been wishing to ve a grown up and now I am. So you better get used to calling me dad, because I&#39;m going to enjoy this while it lasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not staying like this without trying to switch back.&quot; Ryan asserted as he  made a stern face, &quot;Try and remember, I&#39;m still your father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matty wasn&#39;t going to take it, this was his dad&#39;s mistake and he wasn&#39;t going to be pushed around even as a grown up -- especially not when he stood at a commanding 6&#39;5 now and had the body of a professional bodybuilder thanks to all the hours his dad spent in the gym. <br />
<br />
Matty leaned down and used his massive biceps and newfound strength to lift his dad up in his former body, holding him up in the air so that he could look him directly in the eyes, his legs dangling at least two feet above the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;Try to remember, I&#39;m bigger than you now &quot;<br />
<br />
Put me down, this minute young man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure son,&quot; Matty said with a smirk on his face as he carried his dad out of the and room, setting him down. <br />
<br />
“You wanted to see me flex so let’s give it a try.” <br />
Matty looked down in awe of the incredible body he now had. He looked like a young Arnold Schwarzenegger what with his broad shoulders, perky pecs, washboard abs and bulging biceps. <br />
<br />
Matty began examining his big hands and arms, his large pecs, and his stunning abs which he ran his fingers down taking in the more-than-impressive cuts of his abs. He then placed his hands behind his head and starts grinding his stonewall abs, before lifting his arms perpendicular to his body and doing a double bicep pose, the veins in his now massive arms pulsating as he flexed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woooooooooooow, this is amazing! I look like a freaking superhero but even better,&quot; Matty exclaimed, smiling as he continued to flex his new, huge muscles. &quot;Here, take a video of me flexing these bad boys,&quot; Jakarta  said handing his phone his dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, now give me back my body,&quot; a distraught and envious Ryan. <br />
<br />
Matty watched as his dad crossed his tiny little arms, he honestly couldn&#39;t believe this new reality or the fact that his beefy, meathead dad was now a peony little boy standing there in his baggy posing trunks which drooped over his once powerful and dominating figure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take this video or your never going to get these amazing muscles back,&quot; Matty threatened, a threat that sounded more intense thanks to his deep manly voice. “Oh and it’s Matt now.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Ryan said as took the phone. <br />
<br />
Standing there in nothing but the posing trunks his dad had given him, Matt began flexing his massive new muscles mimicking the poses he used to watch his dad practice in his garage with envy. With each flex his muscles and veins bulged in ways Matt never new muscles could. He smiled from ear to ear as he showcased his flawless new physique as his dad sulkenly recorded. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was incredible, no wonder you workout so much! I&#39;ve never felt so powerful and alive! Now it’s your turn, dad,&quot; Matt began, a sinister smile forming on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you serious? Why in the world would I listen to you and want to show off this -- he said gesturing at his childlike figure — muscleless body I’m stuck with?”<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I said so and if you don’t want to be stuck like this for a week or longer, you better start listening to me. I am the true man here and you know what they say about listening to and respecting your elders,&quot; Matt snickered, again using his stern manly voice as an intimidation tool. <br />
<br />
&quot;If I do this, will you give me back my muscles,&quot; Ryan said, hoping just maybe if he played along he could convince Matt to restore him to his former glory with a new spell from the book.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see, but if you don&#39;t I&#39;m walking out of this room now and going home to fully explore this new body of mine if you catch my drift,&quot; Matt said as he grasped his now fully grown and bulging crotch area. <br />
<br />
It was actually the first time Ryan had realized Matt had stole that from him too, which left him even more desperate to get his body back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll do it,&quot; his dad woefully stated. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a good boy,&quot; Matt mocked, &quot;Let&#39;s see what you&#39;re working with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt pulled back out his phone and began recording. He then gestured for his dad to begin his flex routine. <br />
<br />
Ryan sighed heavily, &quot;I can&#39;t believe this is happening,&quot; he thought. <br />
<br />
Realizing it was now or never, Ryan really took in the body he had been stuck with. Gone was the statuesque build he had worked so hard for. <br />
<br />
His once massive biceps were now boney little arms with no definition at all. Gone was his trunk size neck, in its place that of a pencil neck just strong enough to support the boyish face and head now atop it. His once perky pecs now nothing more than a paper thin chest with some tictacs. His shredded, rockhard abs gone and a smooth underdeveloped stomach in it&#39;s place. His once thunderous thigjs and calves, now lacked any power or might. <br />
<br />
Ryan “flexed&quot; his arms perfoming poses that once brought a sense of excitement and tingly sensation, now just filled him with shame.<br />
<br />
Matt meanwhile was having a blast watching his 32 year old dad “flexing&quot; his chicken like arms and trying to muster up any from of fear his former frame once provided. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s enough.&quot; Matt chuckled, while I could watch this all day, it&#39;s actually embarrassing. To think those minuscule muscles were mine only this morning.”<br />
<br />
&quot;There, you watched me humiliate myself and have the footage to remember forever. Can I finally have my body back?&quot; His dad pleaded.</p>
