<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I&#39;ve been playing paintball for years. I did my time in the army reserves to pay for college. I wasn&#39;t interested in becoming a soldier for real but time in the army reserves improved my paintball skills. I got so good at paintball that it became boring. It wasn&#39;t a challenge anymore. I needed to find a bigger challenge. That&#39;s when I learned about this outfit of hardcore paintballers. They even owned more than two-thousand acres of land to play paintball in. I signed up and they invited me out.<br />
<br />
I arrived at a small lodge and wondered if I was at the right place. For such a large chunk of land, the lodge seemed tiny and primitive. I was told that there was a larger lodge further in and this lodge was only used to greet potential new members. There were eleven other men who also wanted to join and the hardcore paintballers wanted to test our paintball skills to make sure we were good enough for the club before they would let us join or visit the main lodge.<br />
<br />
So I went out to this small range where I could show them my paintball skills. They offered me free drinks while I waited for the others to arrive. I thought it was odd that I was the first one to arrive because I had arrived late. Then I fell asleep.<br />
<br />
I woke up in a cage with the eleven other men. We were all naked and we shouted to get out of the cage. Our captors explained that they were going to hunt us and that they had implanted trackers in us while we slept so that we couldn&#39;t escape and alert the authorities. They wanted to give us an incentive to make the hunt more challenging for them so they told us that the last one of us twelve to get captured would be fed and kept in a comfortable cage. We could run wherever we wanted as long as we stayed within range of the beacons. If we ran outside the range of the beacons, our implanted trackers would kill us. Then they opened the cage and chased us out into the wilderness with nothing.<br />
<br />
A few of us stuck together. I learned from Ryan, John and Brad that they each had fallen for a different scheme. None of them were paintballers like me. Ryan thought he was going to a football camp. John thought he was attending a survivalist weekend. Brad thought was literally kidnapped off the streets outside of the gym he worked out at. As we compared stories, none of them had been to the same lodge I had been. It was obvious that our captors had built a few false front lodges around the property so that their prey would not be suspicious until it was too late.<br />
<br />
Of our group, Ryan was the first one captured. We were at a river drinking water when Ryan suddenly fell over unconscious. We didn&#39;t see any mark and then we saw a small puff of dirt an inch from my foot and we realized they were firing some kind of energy weapons at us. We ran but John didn&#39;t make it. Brad and I managed to hide.<br />
<br />
Later, when we felt safe coming out, Brad and I figured out where the trackers had been implanted. We made a crude blade out of some rocks and cut the trackers out of each other. Then we discussed strategy. We decided to separate. Brad would attempt to escape and alert the authorities. I would use my military experience to try to find their main lodge and shut them down.<br />
<br />
I did find their main lodge but it wasn&#39;t anything like I expected. Their main lodge was disguised to look like a lodge but it was clear once I got close enough that alien technology was inside. This wasn&#39;t a group of eccentric humans. These were aliens masquerading as humans. They even had a small space ship in the barn. I snuck on board to investigate and then had to hide. Some of the aliens flew the ship into space toward an even larger ship.<br />
<br />
I found my way to the vents and crawled around investigating the alien ship. I managed to find food and safe places to hide but the controls for the ship didn&#39;t make sense to me. They were even more complicated than an airplane&#39;s controls and I didn&#39;t know how to fly an airplane.<br />
<br />
Then I found Brad. He was in this luxurious office. They had turned Brad into a rug. When it seemed safe enough to do so, I got a closer look. They had somehow flattened Brad from the neck down. His head was still normal and he was still alive. He could whisper and I could understand him only if my ear was right next to his mouth. He told me how he hadn&#39;t gotten far before he was captured. He also told me that these aliens were called homans instead of humans.<br />
<br />
Someone was coming so I ducked back into the vents and watched. Brad was laid out on his chest like a rug. His arms and legs were spread out and they had even pulled his flattened dick and balls out visible between his legs. As the homans discussed business in a language I didn&#39;t understand, they walked all over Brad like the rug he was.<br />
<br />
I was confused because I found it erotic. Every time one of the homans stepped on Brad&#39;s butt or balls, I wondered what it felt like to Brad. Part of me was curious to find out what it felt like to be a rug but part of me knew I was the only chance Brad and the others had to escape.</p>
