<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave wondered if he might have taken his games a little bit too far. Claire&#39;s breasts weren&#39;t supposed to cause trouble for her. But the way she had to let her breasts &#39;rest&#39; on her desk every few minutes suggested they might have been very much trouble for her. Dave also noticed that during her transformation, she had gained a muzzle and her ears had moved to the top of her head some. He had been &#39;distracted&#39; by some of her other changed at the time. <br />
<br />
The neophyte wizard wondered about her small pink scared when he had written for her to be naked. Then again, he had called Amanda naked while she still had shoes and pearls. Had he set a precedent? A few ,ore experiments were needed. But did this mean the pen was alive somehow? That it could think maybe? Well, it had had only a hundred million ways to twist his precious change into something hideous, so it seemed to be benign. <br />
<br />
What was interesting that no one was treating Claire&#39;s breasts like a big deal, then again, the mind could adjust to anything, and if she had had them all along now, why would they be a big deal now? <br />
<br />
He had had been planning to make Alex a cheetah girl, but maybe lazy Chad from advertisement might be better for that. <br />
<br />
As for Alex, if he liked Claire so much, should he make them a matching set? Then again, he should leave some males around for the sake of future generations. <br />
<br />
He wrote &#39;Alex will transform into a naked zebra man who will help Claire out of her shell.&#39; <br />
<br />
Well, if Claire became a turtle, he&#39;d know not to use figures of speech while writing. Claire did not become a turtle, or any type of shelled creature. Alex on the other hand was going through some changes. <br />
<br />
The changes were predictable, but still interesting. Alex&#39;s clothes vanished, which led to the image that many men had in their nightmares, but Alex didn&#39;t notice as he took a minute now to chat with Claire, his feet becoming hooves, and his hands armored four fingers. His hair turned white, and became a mohawk that went down his neck and back. His face stretched into a muzzle as his eyes became large and bright blue. Black and white stripped four covered his body. And for decency&#39;s sake, he gained a sheath that protected what was between his legs. His tail swayed behind him as he continued his talk with Claire without missing a beat. It was stunning how mundane the scene would have been if not for the two now being naked animal people, just two co-workers chatting with it up, with the cheerful male getting the shy girl to open up some. <br />
<br />
Claire still however laid her breasts her desk whenever she could though. Dave hadn&#39;t forgotten. <br />
<br />
He wondered about making them somehow bigger, but that felt mindlessly cruel and vicious and really not serving any point. <br />
<br />
He wrote down, &#39;Claire&#39;s breasts will become the maximum size they can be, without them a constant annoyance.&#39; <br />
<br />
As he watched, Claire&#39;s breasts shrank down from monstrous &#39;bigger than beach balls&#39; size to . . . well, still stunningly huge and larger than should be possible for a woman her body size, but at least now didn&#39;t make it impossible for her to huge herself. <br />
<br />
He turned his attention now to Chad, as usually doing his best to create the illusion he was working. He didn&#39;t realize Dave was now watching him and seeing him goof off when he claimed to be thinking of new ideas for advertising new products, except he hadn&#39;t produced an idea in two years and kept on only he knew how to stay in group efforts. <br />
<br />
Dave didn&#39;t hesitate as he wrote down. <br />
<br />
&#39;Chad will turn into a naked collage age cheetah girl, she&#39;ll be a hard worker and have an upbeat personality.&#39; <br />
<br />
And so Chad transformation began. Becoming the seventh non-human at the office, (counting Dave himself). His clothes vanishing, but his spotted fur already already spreading across his body hiding must of the changes, becoming incredibly lithe and trim, gaining a lot of muscle in her legs. Her breasts grew but were surprisingly around A-cup, (or B-cup if you pretended hard enough). Her red baseball cap became a red headband. Unlike Amanda, her hair stayed, becoming yellow and black stripped that added a contrast to her spotted fur. Her hands and feet became paws, but her hands still had an opposable thumb. Her head became increasingly feline, nothing about it was human, but Chad&#39;s original features were still visible somewhere in there. Her whisker twitched as her spotted tail wrapped itself around one leg. It was clear to all her body was built for running. And she always was tapping her rear or front paws, not able to keep 100% still. <br />
<br />
She dove into her work, going at a speed and focus that made David wonder how long until her lot improved, or, because of the retroactive nature his changes seems to be gaining, had already improved if she had always been this focused for it not to get anyone&#39;s attention. <br />
<br />
Dave saw that indeed, a picture of Chad with some friends during a trip to the grand canyon had changed as well showing now the cheetah girl doing the &#39;V-sign&#39; in front of the camera with her friends. Her cubical sign also now read &#39;Cassie.&#39; <br />
<br />
Seven people, including himself, were now animal people, and six of them having no idea that already had changed to make them that way, then again, if reality had changed, then they had always been that way, so there COULD be nothing strange about it. <br />
<br />
That was when the gun shots went off. Alex grabbed Claire and dove under her desk. Cassie flattened herself against her cubical&#39;s wall. The rest of the office workers did much the same and did the smart thing and kept their heads down. The gun shoots had been into the air. Thankfully no one had been hurt or killed, yet. <br />
<br />
Holding a pair of pistols and several clips of ammunitions, was the shooter.<br />
<br />
It was Nick, accounting, he had been here longer than David, he had never gotten a promotion, hadn&#39;t gotten a raise in years, and all around, was barely noticed by anyone . . . he and Dave had shared drinks at the bar and chatted it out how unfair the world was and bet on football games on the bar&#39;s TV more than a few times over the years. Last time they spoke last week at the bar, Nick had been strangely quite, distant. <br />
<br />
&quot;I CAN&#39;T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!! WHY DOES EVERYONE GET PROMOTED BUT ME?! WHY DOES EVERYONE GET A RAISE BUT ME?! WHY DOES EVERYONE GET TOLD THEY&#39;RE DOING A GOOD JOB BUT ME?! NO ONE APPRECIATES WHAT THEY HAVE UNTIL IT&#39;S GONE! I&#39;M GONNA MAKE EVERYONE APPRECIATE EVERYTHING NOW! SCREW ALL OF YOU JERKS! DO YOU TAKE ME SERIOUSLY NOW?! DO YOU NOTICE I&#39;M HERE NOW?! DO YOU?!!?! ANYONE FEEL LIKE LAUGHING NOW?!&quot;<br />
<br />
From his one way mirror office, and due to writing he wouldn&#39;t be bothered until he left his office, Dave had a perfect view of everything. <br />
<br />
Samantha from PR had wet herself. <br />
<br />
Mikki however, foolishly moved her head around and made herself a target to Nick and the monkey girl teenager said, &quot;N-Nick,&quot; She whimpered, clearly scared for her life. &quot;I-I n-never laughed at you. Never. Please. Just put the guns down. You&#39;re just tired. Maybe you need a v-cation-&quot;<br />
<br />
He pistol whipped her and pointed the weapon in her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;SHUT UP! You stupid brat! What do you know?! You should just die!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ross from security had reached for his police revolver and was inching towards Nick from behind. <br />
<br />
Dave wrote barely having time to think about what he was going to write. <br />
<br />
&#39;Nick is a little pink cat girl, she only has plastic guns, she hates violence and always will.&#39; <br />
<br />
The entire office blurred. <br />
<br />
Nick shrank down, getting smaller, younger, more innocent, fur covering her body as her clothes vanished, his ammo and clothing dissolving, her eyes losing fury and becoming only those of an innocent child playing a game, the changes happening much faster than Dave was used to, like the pen itself sensed his urgency. <br />
<br />
Now Nick was gone. In his place was a small pink cat girl with a white round belly, yellow eyes, blond hair done up in a cute pink bow, with a similar bow on the end of her tail and around her neck, so cute that she could have been almost a living feline teddy bear. <br />
<br />
No one was hiding in fear, Ross wasn&#39;t trying to aim a shot at the now never existed mad man. <br />
<br />
Mikki plucked the bright orange plastic water gun out of the little cat-girl&#39;s paws with one of her feet-hands. Her triangle ears folded on her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nicole!&quot; Mikki said sternly, &quot;That wasn&#39;t funny! What if someone saw you with that and thought it was a real gun?&quot; <br />
<br />
Nicole said sinerely, &quot;Ah&#39;m sorwie!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t bring toys like this to the office again, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah understand Miss Mikki.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl.&quot; She took apart the toy gun and put the parts in a waste basket before putting Nicole on the head with one of her feet before tickling her, making her giggle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now run along dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Nicole said and ran along back to Nick&#39;s cubical that now looked part office and part play room.</p>
