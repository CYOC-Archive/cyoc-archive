<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, it is a beautiful dream, and neither Alex or I can see spending the rest of our lives with anyone else but each other,&quot; said Nate Anderson, as his family sat down to dinner. &quot;Then again, while converting their basement into a &#39;bachelor pad&#39; for Alex is on their agenda for by the time we graduate high school, the only thing for certain on the baby front this weekend is to discuss the situation.&quot;<br />
Martha and William Anderson looked at each other with a quick but sly glance. On one hand, as parents themselves, both knew that having children was a big step in a married couple&#39;s life together, so was definitely something not to be taken lightly. The Ramseys probably would talk things over while they were alone this coming weekend.<br />
On the other paw, considering the more advanced state of a were&#39;s libido, the werecat and werefox both knew that there would be more than just &#39;talking&#39; happening between Alex&#39;s parents.  Whether or not that actually resulted in creating a future sibling remained to be seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t blame you for getting excited about the prospect of being with the one you love,&quot; began Nate&#39;s younger brother Eric, as the Andersons continued eating. &quot;Just look at me and Julie. I could be standing in a room full of beautiful women and she&#39;d still be the only one I noticed.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is so sweet,&quot; said his mother, as a smile crossed Martha&#39;s feline muzzle. Both adults were currently displaying their fursonas proudly while their children, having just recently returned home, were still in their human forms and clothing.<br />
&quot;Err... we don&#39;t plan to do it now, naturally,&quot; began Eric, wondering if this would be a good time to broach the subject, &quot;but when the time did come, you two would have no objection to me marrying Julie Stovall, would you?&quot;<br />
Eric&#39;s parents were a bit taken aback at that, but quickly replied, &quot;No. Of course not. Julie&#39;s a sweet girl,&quot; said his mother; while his father replied &quot;Err... how do you know with such certainty that Julie is THE one so soon?&quot; The last thing William Anderson wanted to do was insult his son the were-merman by saying something totally insensitive like <i>There&#39;s plenty of fish in the sea.</i><br />
&quot;Do you know what a prophecy dream is?&quot; asked Eric in return.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; admitted his father. &quot;I think I have heard the term though,&quot; as his wife just shrugged.<br />
&quot;Although I didn&#39;t believe in them until I had some myself, a prophecy dream is when a were is shown their future because of some question about what the right decision in a particular situation should be,&quot; explained their son. &quot;I&#39;ve had dreams about my future with Julie, and found out she&#39;s even had the <b>exact</b> same dreams about me and us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said Martha in disbelief.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; was Eric&#39;s only reply.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s happened to me and Alex too!&quot; attested Nate. &quot;We&#39;ve both seen our respective futures. They not only included the two of us getting married, but our future career plans, which is why I know about my teaching and writing endeavors while Alex is successful in the food industry; and eventually we even adopt a child!&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; was all William could say as his sons continued talking.<br />
&quot;All either of us remembers is her being a little girl in need of a good home named Alice,&quot; replied Nate. &quot;Although we like Julie&#39;s suggestion from the Skulk welcoming ceremony, we&#39;re still uncertain exactly who hyphenates what between Ramsey-Anderson and Anderson-Ramsey. Maybe we&#39;ll do like she suggested and each take the other&#39;s together.&quot;<br />
&quot;Our prophecy dreams have been a little blurry on the career front,&quot; said Eric, turning to face his older brother, &quot;although we&#39;re both doing something in the sciences. Julie&#39;s concerning the oceans, while I&#39;m with Tachibana Industries in some technical capacity. But we get married after high school graduation, and start having children after we&#39;ve established our careers post college graduation, with two children: Eric Junior and Melinda. By the way, you two make great grandparents,&quot; added Eric, turning to face his folks again.<br />
The only thing he didn&#39;t mention was that while it was originally intended by his mother to be a token of friendship and promise, the single pearl necklace Martha made for Eric to give Julie was actually the were-mer equivalent of an engagement ring. His fiance wore it proudly around her neck and the happy couple wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.<br />
<br />
If they were in their human forms right now, both William and Martha Anderson would be pale as ghosts, as they felt the blood drain from their respective faces.<br />
&quot;How can you two be so sure of this?&quot; wondered William, as Martha just kept turning her head to look at the men in her life individually and together.<br />
&quot;Being weres, we know it here,&quot; said Nate, pointing to his head.<br />
&quot;And here,&quot; added Eric, putting both hands over his heart.<br />
&quot;Oh... wow...&quot; was all Martha could say, finally finding her voice again.<br />
&quot;I think I had one of those prophecy dreams once since I became a werefox,&quot; revealed their father. &quot;I really don&#39;t remember much of it, but we were all gathered around a swimming pool having a cookout.&quot;<br />
&quot;Julie and I had that dream too,&quot; confirmed Eric. &quot;The fresh water pool was in our backyard. Both our children were there. Nate was already married to Alex, but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t recall the two of you having a daughter.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay. Alice arrives about a decade after Alex and I wed,&quot; replied Nate.<br />
&quot;Oh, my,&quot; was all Martha could say, as she wiped her muzzle with a napkin. &quot;This has certainly been an interesting dinner conversation,&quot; she added, noticing that her children had finished eating, while she and William weren&#39;t done yet.<br />
&quot;Doctor Twist can explain prophecy dreams in far greater detail than I can,&quot; conceded Eric, as he wiped his mouth.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that we&#39;re saying no to any of this,&quot; began William, staring at his sons. &quot;We want you two to be happy. But like Nate was planning to move in with Alex now, we don&#39;t want you to rush into anything either.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. We won&#39;t,&quot; promised Nate.<br />
&quot;Besides, Julie&#39;s already had this conversation with her parents, and she&#39;s promised them she&#39;ll take her were-mer birth control pill every day until...&quot; and then Eric stopped talking, realizing just how awkward that was starting to sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, unfortunately, I don&#39;t have anything planned for dessert tonight,&quot; admitted Martha. <i>Besides, I&#39;m kind of afraid to find out what topic might arise if this conversation continues.</i><br />
&quot;Then can I be excused?&quot; asked Nate. &quot;I promised Alex I&#39;d come back over and help out if I could.&quot; <i>Besides wanting some <b>private</b> time with him.</i><br />
&quot;Is your homework done?&quot; asked his father.<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then you can go. Just be back by curfew.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Nate, before getting up and heading for the backdoor. He would rush across the hill after leaving the house, and not go furry until the time was right, but as soon as he could be alone with his werewolf lover...<br />
&quot;Can I be excused too?&quot; wondered Eric. &quot;I&#39;d like to finish my homework before my nightly Skype chat with Julie.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure dear,&quot; replied Martha, watching Eric get up, gather his things and race upstairs to his room.<br />
<br />
Alone, the werefox and the werecat sat silently for a bit.<br />
Then William turned to Martha and said, &quot;They&#39;re growing up.&quot;<br />
She was silent for a while longer before the werecat replied, &quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m ready for them to grow up, let alone become adults and embrace the futures they seem so sure of.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me neither,&quot; conceded her werefox mate, &quot;but either way...&quot;<br />
The silence hung in the air as Martha Anderson leaned closer to her husband as William wrapped his furry arms around her.</p>
