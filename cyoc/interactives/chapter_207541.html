<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as they left the restaurant, Sam texted his friend. His new hooflets were awkward when it came to tiny electronic devices, but he managed to ask a simple question:<br />
<br />
>What’s your favorite animal?<br />
<br />
No immediate response. Not surprising, Alex didn’t like texting. And he was probably wondering where the question came from. Anyways, at least he’d sent the question. He and Alex had grown up together and Alex had been fine when Sam had come out of the closet. Alex was gay as well, though Sam ‘wasn’t his type’. Apparently, he had a thing for older men. Sam never really understood that line of thinking. He was more of a ‘any port in the storm’ kinda guy.<br />
<br />
 “You test him?” Gio asked as they walked out to his muscle car.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.”<br />
<br />
“No reply?”<br />
<br />
Sam shook his head.<br />
<br />
“Hey, I didn’t mean to scare you back there. Even if we can’t save him tomorrow, we can always go back and do some fiddling.” Gio reassured the horse, rubbing a soft padded paw along Sam’s thick hide.<br />
<br />
It felt good. Sam’s cock stirred to life at the wolf’s touch. He whickered gently and nuzzled at the wolf’s neck.<br />
<br />
“Hey big boy, your place or mine?” Gio asked, kissing the horse on the cheek.<br />
<br />
“My place.” Sam whispered.<br />
<br />
“Meet you there.” Gio said, rubbing the horse’s muscular ass and giving it a squeeze.<br />
<br />
Cock growing hard, Sam eagerly rushed back to his truck and rushed back to his house. Gio knocked a minute later and Sam let him in. They made out, Sam kicking the door closed behind the wolf. He ran his hooflets over the hills and valley of the wolf’s form, smelling his delightful musk in the air. They moved in tandem to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Sam sat on the edge of his bed. They broke the kiss, Gio staring lovingly into the horse’s large, dewy eyes. Sam heart skipped a beat. This whole thing was just a fling, right? So why was it suddenly feeling serious. His cock rose between them, stiff and waggly.<br />
<br />
“Ready?” Gio murmured.<br />
<br />
Sam nodded, running a hoof down his lover’s back.<br />
<br />
The wolf licked his chops before kneeling in front of the muscular horse. <br />
<br />
“Straight from the tap.” Gio muttered under his breath.<br />
<br />
The wolf reached out and grasped the horse’s mottled length. Sam shivered as the soft, warm paw encircled him and began to pump. Gio leaned in, parting his lips. The wolf took the flat head of the horse’s shaft into his mouth and started to suckle.<br />
<br />
Sam grunted softly. Now that he wasn’t super horned up, he had time to appreciate how wet and warm the wolf’s mouth was. Gio was an expert cocksucker, his tongue flicking and rubbing Sam’s throbbing rod with a long, soft tongue. He managed to hit so many spots, wrapping around the horse’s massive dong. Sam leaned back and groaned as Gio suckled and slurped his cockhead, his tongue lapping over the horse’s eager flesh. <br />
<br />
The horse licked his lips and moaned in pleasure. His eyes rolled, lost in the delightful sensations the wolf was drawing from him. Shivering, he placed a large hoof on the back of Gio’s head, guiding him, encouraging him. Gio picked up the pace, gently bobbing, more of the horse’s length sliding into the slick maw.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, Gio!” Sam grasped the wolf’s head tighter. He applied more pressure, shoving his meat deeper down the wolf’s notice. “Y-you practice or something?”<br />
<br />
He watched Gio struggle with the thick cock. The wolf murred around the meaty length, relaxing his throat. The horse’s member slid in deep, swelling the wolf’s furry cheeks and visibly stretching his throat. Gio swallowed, Adam’s apple bouncing and knocking against the cock lodged in his throat. The wolf gagged but powered through it.<br />
<br />
Sam moaned as the wolf’s throat worked his mottled shaft, hand loosening his grip. The wolf slobbered the horse’s cock and pulled back on the shaft, only to thrust his muzzle forward again, bobbing and slurping Sam’s fat cock. The wolf’s paws started fondling Sam’s heavy balls in the leathery pouch they sat in.<br />
<br />
The horse stamped his hoof, making a dent in his hardwood floor, slumping back on the bed with a loud nicker. His eyelids flickered, half-lidded from pleasure. Sam shivered, feeling a slow orgasm begin to build deep inside him. Rolling waves of warmth emanated from his balls.<br />
<br />
“Y-you’re so fucking good, Gio.” Sam moaned, fist clenching his bedsheets, overwhelmed by the sensations.<br />
<br />
Gio growled, sending pleasing vibrations down through the shaft and pushed himself further, swallowing up more of the horse’s mottled length. His tail wagged happily behind him. Further and further the wolf went, neck bulging as the flared head of the horse shaft descended down into his gullet. Soon, Gio had managed to take the entire dick all the way to the root, cold wet nose bumping against Sam’s pubic hide.<br />
<br />
The wolf sucked loudly and messily on the hot cock in his maw, drool dripping to the floor as he deepthroated the horse. Sam could hardly believe the wolf capable of taking all that dick and moaned as he watched it disappear into that wet, warm maw. The horse whickered and splayed himself, not sure how to deal with all the sensations. He was close, he knew that much.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit, Gio!” Sam cried out in delight.<br />
<br />
He snorted, holding the wolf in place and bucked into his lovely warm mouth. The wolf’s throat convulsed and hugged the shaft like a lover. The horse ran his paws over the muscular wolf’s back, trailing his hooflets through his fur. Sam bent forward, pressing firmly into Gio’s mouth, and gripped the wolf’s ass.<br />
<br />
Sam tightened his grip and began fucking the wolf’s mouth hard. He was so close. The wolf was just a toy in his hands, a luscious love tunnel. Sam pumped and pumped, feeling his medial ring slide up against the wolf’s throat.<br />
<br />
With a whinny, Sam came. Ribbons of silky semen shot into the wolf’s throat. He pulled Gio off his cock and painted the wolf’s muzzle and eyes with his seed. The wolf did his best to lap at the strands of jism as they splattered across his face. Soon, the firehose of sperm became a trickle. The wolf looked rather soggy.<br />
<br />
Gio blinked and used a paw to wipe his face off.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit. You get pent up fast, don’t you?” The wolf asked, running his tongue around his muzzle.<br />
<br />
Sam snorted proudly.<br />
<br />
“Heh, you’re amazing big guy. Wanna shower?” Gio asked.<br />
<br />
Sam nodded and they took turns scrubbing each other off. Realizing Gio still hadn’t gotten off in any of their sexual encounters, Sam gently eased the wolf’s red shaft out of its sheathe and began stroking him. It didn’t take long for the canine’s knot to bulge at the base. One quick squeeze had the wolf panting, the second had him shooting.<br />
<br />
“Hair trigger.” Sam smirked.<br />
<br />
“Shut up.” Gio said, embarrassed. If he were human, he’d be blushing.<br />
<br />
Together, they went back to Sam’s bed and cuddled. They watched a few movies before their eyes closed.  The new couple lay on the bed, the wolf snuggling the horse’s heavily muscled chest.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
<br />
Sam yawned and stretched, muscles flexing, smacking his lips and blinking the sleep out of his eyes. He checked the clock. Almost 9. He’d need to report to work today. The anthro horse could smell coffee being brewed in his kitchen.When had he brewed coffee? Then he looked over at the other pillow and the events of last night came rushing back to him. <br />
<br />
Gio had warned him about Cassius, told him to text his friend and find out what his favorite animal was. Sam checked his phone and saw one unread message. It was from Alex, his best friend. He opened it and read it. Interesting choice. Now he needed to figure out how to get it.<br />
<br />
He got up and got dressed in the clothes Gio had provided. They fit…well enough. A little smaller than Sam actually was, but not overly tight. The wolf had underestimated his size. Sam checked the tag. XXXL Big and Tall. He blinked. Or maybe this was as big as they got…<br />
<br />
When he walked into the kitchen, he was greeted to the sound of the wolf cooking ham and eggs. Gio looked up  and smiled. The wolf was nude, save for an apron, showing off his furry ass. Gio’s tail wagged when he saw Sam was awake and pointed at a big bowl full of oatmeal.<br />
<br />
“Breakfast is served.”<br />
<br />
“A little bland.” Sam murmured, looking at the unappealing brown mass in the bowl.<br />
<br />
“Herbivore diet. Sorry, not sorry.” Gio grinned, showing off his sharp teeth, but tossed him an apple. “You’ll be pleasantly surprised when you eat it. Your taste buds have altered.”<br />
<br />
Sam dug in and his eyes widened. The oatmeal was really good! It tasted completely different than the bland cereal he was used to. Like, all the sugars and carbs were really popping on his palate. He took a bite of apple and swooned. Sweet, sour, luscious. The horse whinny and nickered as he cowed down. The bowl was devoured in two minutes flat.<br />
<br />
“See?” Gio smirked.<br />
<br />
“Seconds?” Sam asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
Gio made another pot.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
They drove to work. The Anthro Renovations base of operations was a factory/warehouse combo on the outskirts of town. Multiple moving vans and tractor trailers lined the parking lot, all of them with a happy anthro giving a thumbs up painted on the side. The logo was a house with a giraffe’s neck sticking out the window. ‘Don’t settle for less than comfort!’ was written underneath it.<br />
<br />
Anthros milled about, prepping trucks with flooring and crates that looked remarkably similar to the one that Gio had hauled into Sam’s apartment the other day. Most of the anthros were rather large specimens-bears, boars, badger, wolverines, horses and bulls. A few more exotic species like hippos and Lions, tigers, and rhinos were lifting new appliances and boxes of lightbulbs.<br />
<br />
“Loading bay.” Gio pointed out. “They get our trucks ready for when we do service. Our job is to put customers at ease with the change and to do the install.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Sam said. <br />
<br />
Honestly, he kinda wanted to do some lifting right now. His own muscles were flexing on their own, unused to being so swole. Gio must have noticed his longing because he smirked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, if that dampener had worked, you’d be out there with them. Not a bad job for a musclehead like you.”<br />
<br />
“I barely even work out.”<br />
<br />
“Right, so you’ll probably need a gym membership. We have a nice one in this facility, actually. Top of the warehouse.” Gio pointed. “We deduct the fee from your pay if you elect to use it.”<br />
<br />
“Cool.” Sam said. <br />
<br />
They entered the office. A female cougar was fielding phone calls and hit a buzzer to let them through into a veritable maze of cubicles. Everyone was an anthro. It made Sam feel oddly relieved. He wondered why. He should have the new employee jitters, but he felt right at home, like he could slide into any of the dozen pre-work conversations his horsey ears could pick out and be accepted.<br />
<br />
“So where’s orientation?” Sam asked.<br />
<br />
“There isn’t one until you complete day one.” Gio replied.<br />
<br />
“Right. The test.” Sam nodded.<br />
<br />
“Exactly. On the bright side, technically, no matter what happens, you’ll get the job.” <br />
<br />
“Not helpful.”<br />
<br />
“So what animal did your friend choose?” Gio asked.<br />
<br />
Sam showed him the text response.<br />
<br />
“Oh. That’s a big fella, then. Guess he’ll be joining us too.” Gio said. “Wait, I see Cassius.”<br />
<br />
They looked up and saw the croc winding his way towards them through the cubicles.<br />
<br />
“Shit. Here, take this earpiece.” Gio quickly shoved a small ear bud into Sam’s three-fingered hand. “I’ll give you instructions on how to change the dampener settings. You’re gonna have to pocket the proper capsule yourself.”<br />
<br />
“How will I be bale to get to Alex before he does?”<br />
<br />
“Run if you have to, beat Cassius to the door, and blammo!” Gio smirked, smiling as though Sam had just told him a joke. “The dampener is going to be the real issue. Fiddling with it might be difficult. I say drop it and pretend it’s broken, then do the adjustments when he calls for a replacement.”<br />
<br />
“Okay.”<br />
<br />
“Now laugh like I just told you a joke.” Gio murmured.<br />
<br />
Sam let out a hearty bray. Cassius made it to them, the heavily muscled croc grinning from…earhole to earhole, Sam supposed. But crocs were always grinning, technically, so he wasn’t sure if that was a good thing. <br />
<br />
“Sam, you made it!” The croc held out his hand.<br />
<br />
Sam shook it. “Yep. Glad to be on board, Cassius.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm. Yes, well.” Cassius handed him a hard hat and a vest. “Pu these on and follow me. Gio, don’t you have several jobs to do?”<br />
<br />
Gio smiled and left without another word. Sam watched the wolf leave. Gio stopped by a cubicle and chatted up the puma sitting there. He would occasionally turn back and make faces at the croc when he wasn’t looking.<br />
<br />
Cassius waited for Sam to shrug on the vest and started walking briskly. They passed out of the cubicle maze and down a series of hallways. Bathroom were at the far ends of them, along with fire escapes. It was all very dull and traditional office stuff, really. <br />
<br />
“So what are you doing today?” Sam heard a muscular Lynx ask a portly Rhinoceros as he walked by the break room.<br />
<br />
“DBR.” The Rhinoceros replied.<br />
<br />
“Boring.” A Bull snorted. “Got a Zoo Run. Should be fun.”<br />
<br />
“DBR?” Sam whispered to Cassius. “Zoo?”<br />
<br />
“Capsule runs. They take a bunch of domesticated animals-cats, dogs, guinea pigs, etcetera. Barn Runs are goats cows sheep, horses. We usually mix them all up and abbreviate it as a DBR. Zoos are when we want to spice up a neighborhood, throw in some Exotics” Cassius explained.<br />
<br />
“How do you decide? By…race of the residents?”<br />
<br />
“Nah! Doesn’t matter once we’re done with them.” Cassius chuckled. “We’ll assign different runs during different days. This city is a test site.”<br />
<br />
“Test…?”<br />
<br />
“Small scale, one city.” Cassius said as they walked towards the prep room. “The goal, eventually, will be to only do Runs that reflect the region. Canada gets Temperate, Arctic, Mountain, DBR. DBR pretty much works everywhere except coastal areas and deserts. We use Aquatic for the coasts and Desert for…well, the desert.”<br />
<br />
“Right. But because it’s a test city-”<br />
<br />
“We use them all. Rotations and such.”<br />
<br />
“Won’t that be an inconvenience for people who get hit with Aquatic? We’re landlocked.”<br />
<br />
“We’ve discontinued Aquatic for the city.” Cassius said. “You’ll see that as we go along and start dealing with different species, we learn what they need that we didn’t think of. We’ve got a call center set up for complaints and requests. Learn something new every day.”<br />
<br />
“Like?”<br />
<br />
“Heat lamps that work on reptilians are too hot and cause third degree burns, but when we downgrade them, they’re too cool and the reptilians end up all logy. So we need to work out a proper temperature variant.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.”<br />
<br />
“Aquatics need water. Constantly or they dry out. So they can’t actually work. That’s partially why we’ve discontinued aquatics for now.”<br />
<br />
“Good to know. No more dolphins?”<br />
<br />
“No.” Cassius swallowed. “Turns out we should have done more research. I, uh, made an orca. He was one of the human who asked for the transformation, by the way. We thought he’d be fine with a bath every few hours. Turns out freshwater causes their skin to peel, leading to deadly bacterial infections. We had to emergency medevac him to California.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa.” Sam blinked. “So have you, uh, pulled any others?”<br />
<br />
“Reptilians because of the aforementioned sun lamp issues, at least until the lab figures out a fix.” Cassius frowned. “A few other specific species that can only live in certain environments. No pandas.”<br />
<br />
“No pandas?”<br />
<br />
“They only eat bamboo. Very boring diet and apparently bamboo is an invasive species. Again, another request by a volunteer. Medevac them to China.”<br />
<br />
“Shit.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, worst part is, they don’t even speak Chinese.” Cassius shrugged. “Oh well. Anyways, let’s pick your capsules for today.”<br />
<br />
“Who will we be servicing?” Sam asked, dreading the answer.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you know. One apartment, One house.”<br />
<br />
“Only two?”<br />
<br />
“I’m teaching you installation. So yeah, only two. Eventually, you’ll be like Gio and the others. Doing maybe…5, 6 services a day.” Cassius said, turning away to look at the capsule racks. <br />
<br />
Sam moved quickly, having already sidled up to the proper section and identified his target capsule. In two seconds, he’d tucked a capsule into his pocket. He glanced over at Cassius, wondering what the crocodile had in store for his best friend.<br />
<br />
In the split second after he looked over to check on Cassius, the crocodile picked out two capsules. It happened so quickly and offhandedly that Sam couldn’t tell which ones Cassius had chosen. They disappeared into the front pocket on Cassius’ reflective vest.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I’ve picked our capsules. Let’s get to servicing. Ready?” Cassius grinned toothily.<br />
<br />
“What’d you pick out?” Sam asked.<br />
<br />
“Two capsules. According to census data, two singles, living alone. Should be easy enough.” Cassius replied.<br />
<br />
“Right, but <I>which</I> capsules?”<br />
<br />
“Irrelevant. Ready?”<br />
<br />
“Is it really, though?” Sam asked. “Didn’t you say certain species need special considerations?”<br />
<br />
Cassius paused.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Very good, Sam!” The crocodile grinned. “And to answer your question…no. Neither capsule requires any special preparations. Good listening! Now, are you ready for your first day?”<br />
<br />
Of course he wouldn’t answer. Sam fingered the capsule in his pocket and nodded.<br />
<br />
“Good! Let me show you to the van.”<br />
<br />
They walked out to the garage. <br />
<br />
Sam double-checked if he’d nabbed the correct capsule and breathed a sigh of relief. Now all he had to do was hit Alex with it before the crocodile could. And, of course, fiddle with the dampeners, which he was much less confident in his ability to do so, much less do so discretely.<br />
<br />
The van was loaded with flooring, solutions and filters. Sam guessed they weren’t doing anything too exotic, as it all seemed rather sparse. He wondered what Cassius had in store for Alex. Two large crates were in the back of the van.<br />
<br />
“Those are our dampeners. They’ve been preset. Apartment and House are labeled.<br />
<br />
“Is there a difference?” Sam asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Apartments are lower frequency with a wider range. Homes are narrower and, honestly, less work. Usually only one species needs to be accounted for. You get a better variety of animals in apartments.”<br />
<br />
“Better variety?”<br />
<br />
“Dogs and cats get a bit boring. Real easy animals to deal with. The harder stuff is tigers and the like. That’s when things get real fun.” Cassius smiled. “You’ll see. DBRs will be the most mundane thing you’ll do, and you’ll wish you could turn someone into a budgie.”<br />
<br />
“Right.” Sam said, feeling uncomfortable. “Do we ever do…requests?”<br />
<br />
“Like…what?” Cassius asked. “Furries?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Cassius nodded. “Though we usually blast them anyways. Gossipy bitches. Here, grab a crate and let’s go.”<br />
<br />
Sam picked up the crate. It was heavy, but the strain on his muscles felt nice. He easily lifted it into the van and then got in.<br />
<br />
“Alright. Apartment or house?” Cassius asked.<br />
<br />
“Apartment.” Sam said firmly. <br />
<br />
He needed time to see how this thing operated in reality before he went to his best friend’s house. Cassius smiled and they drove off.</p>
