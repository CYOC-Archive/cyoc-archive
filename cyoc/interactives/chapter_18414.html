<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Missy's whinnies for her young one to return and nurse was an overpowering as was the instincts to accept being as a colt horse. Jeff struggled to think in human ways of those things that seperated what he was from what he longed to become.<br />
<br />
Every passing minute had for him the onslaught of instincts so profound it was like he was being brainwashed by sensations coming from his cock. Passions of enormus proportions, desires to feel the sensations of mating in equine style, a building lust toward Missy, and what was worse a easy willingness to let go of his past, all drove him to accept becoming a horse.<br />
<br />
Madame' ordered Stephen to place a halter on Jeff, reining him them to stand in a stall of his own. <br />
<br />
Doing as ordered less Stephen be as something other than the male self she had to endure, Jeff was led to his stall. A motion for her then to get the vehicle and ready himself to drive Madame' into town sent him off from the barn.<br />
<br />
Jeff was far too involved in trying to hold onto his own history than taking note as did Eve and Matt as they watched Madame' through a barn window.<br />
<br />
Madame' standing with arms raised high was speaking a spell upon the entrance of the barn. Her dire plan to enchant Tye and Seth, Eve's two sons, and with them as Percheron horses too she would have clear title to the family farm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rest be to Seth and Tye as passing here their human lives will die, and made sure that they will stay, in Percheron bodies to their dying day. Upon the waves of time and air will the two sons of Eve beware, as beasts of burden they shall be, I curse them to become and stay, in bigger, stronger, beastly forms from that very day!&quot; spelled Madame' to the gate leading into the corral and the door to the horse barn.<br />
<br />
Then she turned round and walked to the waiting vehicle and with Stephen driving they drove into town.<br />
<br />
Stomping his hoofs in eager anticapation of feeing his cock burried in Missy once more, Jeff whinnied up a storm in his stall. The drive for sexual please and his sensations of being naked to the world and a horse was having profound pressures on his young mind.<br />
<br />
Bang went a door and all horses plus Jeff looked that way. <br />
<br />
&quot;Feeding time my friends!&quot; said the voice of a man.<br />
<br />
Jeff could not see him past all the large 16, 17, and 18 hands high horse bodies that seperated him from the voice. Missy was first and made soft muffled sounds as if enjoying in the sight of the man as he dividied out rations of hay and grain.<br />
<br />
Down closer he walked giving each horse their morning rations of food and water. Jeff though still enraged sexually and erect quite painfully, stood straining to see this man who was there feeding all his horses.<br />
<br />
Wide eyed and showing obvious terror Jeff had his forst sight of the man as he passed Matthew, the prime stallion standing next to him. A somewhat manly form but having mixed into his human self parts of a Ram Sheep. The curving ram's horns, sheepish ears, and a man naked to the world as was Jeff and those there as horses. <br />
<br />
Naked yes, but still he was clad in curls of wool from head to cloven hooves. A man in general form having human arms, hands, and a face totally human. His body burst of huge muscles in shoulders, chest, arms, and legs. He stood on muscular hind legs of a Ram, his larger than human testicles hung low and swaying as he walked from stall to stall.<br />
<br />
As the man poured Jeff his morning's food, he reached his Percheron colt's head forward to take a whiff of the man's scent. Reaching out he sniffed first and then with thinkened equine lips did try to grasp at the Sheep like sheath perched on the man's round belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I might be less the man I was once, but being now the keeper here there still is my duties to those ewes!&quot; said the manly form as his right hand batted Jeff's muzzle away.<br />
<br />
Jeff jerked back his head and stood with head tucked tight to neck, he eyed this man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your the new one no doubt! Well there colt, and you are now a colt Percheron horse, remember that! Being you are new here I will give you this one time as you don't as yet know the rules. I am Sabastian, and it is my duties to take care of those like you and the born animals. As much I am like a Ram and Sheep in form to keep me here less I escape and tell the world of this place, woe be upon me if I did. Cursed am I, spelled to be as you see and cursed if I leave making me then a real Ram, an animal in body, mind, and fate.&quot; said the Man to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff let loose a high pitched whinny as if to agree in not touching the man.<br />
<br />
Petting Jeff's forelock of mane hairs he smiled, &quot;Good boy, good horsey, don't get angry about being addressed so, remember you are now a horse, and from now till forever you will remain as a horse!&quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
Oddly Jeff made no other agressive moves as he had already accpeted the thought that he was from then on to be as a colt, then yearling, and finally mautre into a huge Percheron stallion. a munch of his hay had him reacting like any colt, he got and erection.</p>
