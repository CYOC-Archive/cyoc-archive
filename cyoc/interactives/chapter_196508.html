<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike&#39;s best friend Tony decided to visit him, concerned as Mike hasn&#39;t attended to college for a while, something the &#39;old&#39; Mike wouldn&#39;t do, he&#39;s always present and has perfect attendance. He makes his way to Mike&#39;s apartment.<br />
Mike woke up, his sentient latex suit clinging to his body tightly. Him and the suit continued playing, there is no need for Mike to eat breakfast as the suit is providing energy for him. Moaning as he plays with himself, or rather, with the suit. <br />
Tony is a nerdy 18 year old boy, being best friends with Mike, they know each other for a long long time, meeting way back in elementary and being friends since then. As he was about to knock the door on Mike&#39;s apartment, he hears faint moaning inside. Now this is VERY unusual. <br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t what I think it is this isn&#39;t what I think it is this isn&#39;t what I think it is&quot; Tony continues to say in his head as he questions the source of all the moaning. He gathered the courage to knock the door.<br />
Startled, Mike stopped playing. Being a potential danger, the suit retracted, forming the disguise it became during their trip to the lab yesterday. Mike wore some clothes, and opened the door.<br />
&quot;Hi Mike! Uh... how are you doing?&quot; Tony greeted him.<br />
&quot;Oh, Tony, oh I&#39;m fine!&quot; Mike said.<br />
&quot;Can I talk to you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes sure&quot;<br />
They sat down into the dinner table, facing each other.<br />
&quot;Dude, how have you been? What happened to you?&quot; Tony asked.<br />
&quot;Nothing... nothing... I&#39;m fine, I just don&#39;t feel like going to college anymore.&quot; Mike answered.<br />
&quot;What? What do you mean?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy now, I have... pleasure.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ple- pleasure? What are you saying dude?&quot;<br />
The suit eager to quickly pleasure Mike as it intends to, a small moan came out from his mouth.<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Tony asked. Now Mike feels more suspicious. <br />
&quot;Nothing, nothing, do you want some water? It&#39;s pretty hot this afternoon outside.&quot; Mike said as he stands up and went to the fridge. This gave Tony a good opportunity to investigate Mike. He notices a sliver of latex in his legs and neck. Now he has to call him out.<br />
&quot;Mike, be honest to me. What are you wearing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing! This is just simple clothes see?&quot;<br />
Okay something is up, Tony thought, and with brute force he forcefully remove Mike&#39;s normal clothes, revealing the sticky black latex suit within.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re best friends Mike, you don&#39;t have to lie to me.&quot;<br />
The suit sees this as an opportunity to somewhat show off its abilities on Tony, so it suddenly reforms into a full suit, and started stimulating Mike.<br />
&quot;What the?!&quot; Tony surprised as he sees his best friend suddenly started moaning, his latex covered dick erect and standing proud as the latex clad teenager lies down in the ground moaning.<br />
&quot;I found ah.... something special ah....&quot; Mike said. Moaning, he orgasms, displayed in front of the blushing Tony.<br />
&quot;Dude what the fu-k! This isn&#39;t funny man!&quot;<br />
&quot;I love... ah... this... I don&#39;t want to take it off ahh....&quot;<br />
Tony, wanting what&#39;s best for Mike, tries to take off the latex suit off of Mike, oblivious to the fact that it will not come off. Ever.<br />
&quot;This is messed up Mike! Your leaving college and your dreams behind for stupid pleasure?&quot; Tony says as he tries to take off the suit.<br />
&quot;Take it off Mike! This isn&#39;t right!&quot;<br />
As Tony closes in to Mike who&#39;s lying on the floor, he sees Mike&#39;s eyes, it&#39;s screaming for help, from the little bit of Mike beneath the suit that hasn&#39;t corrupted yet, and it&#39;s also in pleasure, from the corrupted Mike. Tony notices this and knows that something is really wrong.<br />
Mike&#39;s eyes started tearing up, both from the pleasure and for help, as the suit notices this behavior and started covering Mike&#39;s mouth with the mask. Moaning beneath it. Now that the symbiote latex suit has a better grip on Mike, it controls his brain and influences him to fight Tony from taking off the suit. <br />
Tony tried to fight Mike&#39;s squirming, but being a nerdy boy that he is, his slim physique doesn&#39;t help him in this situation. With ease, Mike tackled Tony, pinning him down.<br />
&quot;Let me go Mike! This isn&#39;t cool man!&quot;<br />
Realizing that Tony doesn&#39;t like what he sees, it has changed its goal from showing off to silencing Tony. And it has a great idea on how.<br />
A tendril went out of the suit and made its way into Tony&#39;s ears, making its way into his brain. The tendril controlled his brain a little to prevent him from squirming and moving, making the next step of the suit&#39;s plan easier.<br />
While still conscious inside, Tony is now unable to move. Mike then started removing Tony&#39;s pants and clothes. Tony can feel all of this, but cannot move at all. Mike lands his latex covered palm into Tony&#39;s barren chest, tendrils started going off to cover Tony. The tendrils turned mobility back on on Tony, and he&#39;s now able to move. The suit wants to make Tony&#39;s experience as pleasurable as possible so it made him able to move again. <br />
Tony would be lying if he says he&#39;s not being turned on in this situation. He screams as the latex covers his body. With no frame suit the latex can spread into where it wants to be. He tries desperately to remove the latex but only made it worse, making it spread faster. Mike spreads more of the living latex into Tony by rubbing his hands on Tony&#39;s naked body. He reaches for the boy&#39;s penis, which is starting to get erect from the sensational overload and started spreading latex tendrils into his member. Mike masturbates Tony&#39;s penis to put it into pleasure, reducing resistance from Tony so the suit can control him easier.<br />
Tony&#39;s torso is now completely covered in black latex, he cannot move that much as he&#39;s aroused greatly by Mike and the latex. Moaning, he fell into the ground, squirming, trying to break free of the latex but to no avail. <br />
&quot;Ahhh... ahh.... Mike stop this... ah.... no... No... NO!&quot; Tony says in desperation as the suit has fully covered him from the neck down and is now making its way into his head. Mike didn&#39;t respond, under the influence of the latex suit. <br />
&quot;Ahh.... HELP! Ah... ahhh...&quot; Tony uttered as a latex mask covers his mouth preventing him to speak. He can only moan in pleasure by the suit that is now covering him. The latex makes its way into Tony&#39;s brain to remove his resistance, and as soon as it was removed, Tony started moaning louder. The 18 year old Tony is now under the control and influence of the suit that clings into Mike&#39;s body. The slim boy being corrupted by the latex. Mike let go of Tony&#39;s penis as there is no longer resistance. Clenching his fist, back arching, and eyes closing, Tony experiences the best orgasm he has felt ever. Cum started shooting from his penis, which the latex that covers it absorbs the liquid. <br />
The latex now has two teenager boys to pleasure, good news for the suit. A slightly muscular Mike who gave it its sentience in the first place, and his nerd slim best friend Tony who is now under the control of the suit. <br />
The day went by as the two gets pleasured by their suits, moaning and gasping under the latex mask. They cum and cum, taking a short rest for a while, before they go back and enjoy the tight black sticky latex suit that now covers their bodies.</p>
