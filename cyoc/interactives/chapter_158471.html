<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bear???<br />
<br />
Most of the options seemed to make sense to Jeff, but others just went over his head. He assumed they were slang or groups he just hadn&#39;t come across, or didn&#39;t fully understand. He had heard his mother refer to big, burly men as bearish before. Maybe that&#39;s what it meant? Jeff kind of liked the idea of being a big masculine guy and he could always undo it if he didn&#39;t like it, right?<br />
<br />
He clicked on it and another option appeared: &#39;Select Subcategories or Randomize?&quot; Jeff clicked randomize, not wanting to get too in depth on his first change. When the option to alter reality came up he also checked that. He just wanted to get on with it. The screen displayed &#39;Commencing Change.&#39;<br />
<br />
Immediately, Jeff felt a tingle all throughout his body. He looked down at himself and realizing he still had his clothes on, quickly stripped down to his underwear, he wanted to see these changes. He wasn&#39;t particularly out of the ordinary for a sixteen year old. He didn&#39;t participate in sports which left him with a somewhat nondescript build. Sitting down he actually had a little bit of a belly. He was also pretty smooth, only having a bit of hair on his legs and around his crotch. He just started to get some under his arms and he still only needed to shave his upper lip and chin once a week.<br />
<br />
The tingling intensified and already Jeff could see changes in his body. Most noticeably was his chest. Previously flat, it was starting to form two distinct mounds. Instinctively he flexed and the muscles in his chest bunched up. He had pecs! Even his arms and legs were looking thicker. He turned in his chair toward the full length mirror on the closet door, striking a double bicep pose he had seen some of ths other guys do in gym class. He was pleasantly surprised to see the muscles bunching up in his arms. It wasn&#39;t a lot of change, but Jeff definitely looked like he could pass for one of the jocks on the football team. He was even sitting taller in his chair, his legs stretched out further in front of him than he could remember. Jeff had been a rather unimpressive 5&#39;5&quot;, he couldn&#39;t guess what he was at now, but he was glad height was in the mix.<br />
<br />
Still, he only looked like he went through a growth spurt, he was worried this might be it, but he could still feel that tingling under his skin. Idly, he scratched at his chest and felt something strange. Looking down he saw what the mirror didn&#39;t show, fine blond hairs growing in the center of his chest, and down his stomach in a line to the waistband of his underwear. Even as he stared at their slow but sure spread they started to darken from blond to the same brown as the hair on his head. It was happening on his arms too. He looked back into the mirror where he could now see a hairier version of himself sitting there looking shocked. Even his face had a darker shadow around his mouth and along the line of his jaw. He reached up curiously and grinned as he felt stubble. Lifting his arms he could even see thicker bushes of hair in his pits.<br />
<br />
He guessed he could easily pass as one of the seniors. And all through this he had still put on a bit more muscle, so a senior jock no less, even his hands and feet were noticeably larger. But his underwear was getting uncomfortably tight and was starting to give him a wedgie as he continued to grow thicker. He peeled off his undies and tossed them aside, his eyes popping at what he saw between his legs. Jeff had never been impressive, at least not with the quick comparisons he could make in the gym showers, but the thing that now hung between his legs. Two nice plump balls lay on the seat between his legs, and his cock, while not the longest he had seen was noticeably thick. He had a feeling it was going to keep growing, too, and all the attention he was giving it was starting to make it chub up.<br />
<br />
Thick was becoming a good word to describe him all around. His torso, arms, and legs continued to pack on muscle. He could feel the strength running through him, but he never seemed to start to get ripped like the guys he had seen on the cover of fitness magazines. Strangely, thinking of those muscle bound jocks made his cock twitch. Even his stomach remained sort of flat looking. No, not flat, it bulged a little. Not like a belly, just a small gut, but big enough to hide the muscle underneath. Putting his hand on his stomach he could feel the hard muscle under the layer of soft bulk. Brown hair had spread out to cover most of his stomach and chest, adding to the soft feeling.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up to get a better look at himself in the mirror from head to toe. And he was.. well, there was no doubt the guy staring back at him was a thick bundle of muscle, but bear was definitely the right word. He was thick, not ripped. He looked like a guy that lifted weights on the regular but didn&#39;t worry too much about his diet. His body hair, while it covered a good amount of his torso thickly, wasn&#39;t long. In fact it looked like it had been clipped and groomed to uniform length, right down to his pubes. Idly, and without thinking he grabbed at his cock. He had trouble wrapping his hand around the thing. His hands had grown bigger, but so had his cock. Looking at it, he guessed it must be around eight inches, it was hard to judge against his bigger self, but it felt like trying to wrap his hand around a soda can.<br />
<br />
He gave his cock a few tugs and gasped. Placing one hand against the wall he continued to jerk himself off. Though he finally pulled his eyes off his own body in the mirror and looked into his own face. That was no sixteen year old kid looking back at him. He had the face of an adult now. It was obviously him, or someone related to him, but he had thick eyebrows and a full but neatly-trimmed beard, a square jaw, and thick neck. His once shaggy hair was now clipped into a neat crew cut, and luckily showed no signs of balding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck..&quot; He panted as he continued to tug at his thick cock. Even speaking under his breath his voice was strangely deep to his ears, and a little gruff. Slick pre was dripping over his hand, letting him speed up his strokes. He dropped back into his desk chair, having to find a new sprawling position in his bigger body. So absorbed, he didn&#39;t even notice the room around him changing, going from a teenager&#39;s bedroom in their parent&#39;s house to a living room in an apartment. His computer still sat on the desk, showing the Chronivac, but the bed was gone, replaced by a couch, a nice entertainment console with TV and video game systems, and of course a weight mahcine off in one corner.<br />
<br />
With a deep groan of, &quot;Oooh.. fuuuuck..&quot; He came, his heavy balls pulling up before he shot load after load of thick ropey cum from his cock. Some of it landed on his hair stomach and chest, some of it on the floor, but one thing was for sure, it was the most intense orgasm he had every had in his life. Without thinking, he ran a finger through the cum on his chest and stuck it in his mouth, savoring the musky saltiness.<br />
<br />
After a moment he cast around him, looking for the box of tissues he kept on his desk and quickly cleaned himself and the floor up as if he had done this a hundred times before. Only after throwing the tissues in the trash did he notice his altered surroundings. &quot;Huh.. Well, I did say alter reality.&quot; He smiled to hear that deep voice again. He stood and went to the mirror that was now by the weight machine where he could check his form to check himself out. Bear was a good word for him. And the right terms were even slipping into his brain as reality settled. Definitely a muscle bear, he though as he rubbed his hand over his hairy stomach. Maybe tonight he could go to a bar and find a nice little twunk or otter to..<br />
<br />
His thoughts stopped. The part of his mind that was this new him and the old him suddenly coming into conflict. He was gay. Old Jeff wasn&#39;t, or at least he didn&#39;t think he was, but new Jeff definitely was. &quot;Is there anything wrong with that?&quot; He asked himself, looking at his reflection, and he suddenly found himself not caring. &quot;Well, I did chose bear. Just because I didn&#39;t know what that fully meant.&quot; He grinned at himself. &quot;Might as well enjoy my choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bar.. if he was going to go to a bar he&#39;d need.. And he spotted his wallet on the corner of his desk. It was thicker than it was before, and opening it he noticed a lot more cash and a few more cards. Well, that made sense, he wasn&#39;t a kid anymore. He found his driver&#39;s license and pulled it out. &quot;Let&#39;s see.. Name&#39;s still Jeff at least. Six foot three, two hundred and thirty pounds, not bad.. twenty-six years old. Well, damn, a whole ten years older.&quot; But definitely old enough for a bar.&quot; He grinned a winning smile at his own reflection and set his wallet back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.. what to do first?&quot;</p>
