<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Awakening relatively early, Abolith anxiously glanced around. It seemed her concerns were unfounded as she noticed the room undisturbed. Breathing a sigh of relief, the elf now made her way downstairs to check on Fukushu and grab something to eat.<br />
<br />
Approaching the kitchen, she could see it appeared she was the last to awaken. Sachiko, Misaki, and Raiden were already in the living room, watching t.v and eating breakfast. A sour look crossed the elf assassins face as she noticed her son shoveling syrup soaked pancakes into his mouth. Abolith usually fed the boy a more balanced diet of fruits and grains. <br />
<br />
As she entered the kitchen she could see the others gathered at the table. Akira and Fukushu appearing tired as Yuriko and Ayami prepared breakfast. Abolith now crinkled her nose as she noticed Rexie sitting on the table, shoveling sausage links into his mouth. &quot;Does she really need to sit on the table?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I always sit on the table,&quot; Rexie countered, the cherub familiar spitting pieces of sausage out if her mouth as she talked. &quot;You don&#39;t like it leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its inappropriate cherub,&quot; Abolith grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;So is your outfit,&quot; Rexie grumbled, glancing at the elves risqué nightie. &quot;You might want to check the thermostat. Seems a tit nipply in here.&quot; Abolith glanced down at her nightgown, noticing her erect nipples poking through. The elves face growing red in anger. &quot;Avert your eyes familiar before I pluck them out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we simply enjoy a quiet breakfast,&quot; Yuriko sighed as she eased herself into her chair. &quot;This is an unfamiliar occurrence for us all.&quot; A low grumble now emanated from the adults as they eased themselves around the table. Abolith now demurely picking over some fruit as she covered herself, while Fukushu sat by her side staring daggers at anyone who chanced a glance at his beloveds chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did everything go last night,&quot; Ayami asked. Fukushu and Akira gave eachother a nervous glance before responding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet,&quot; Akira said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peaceful,&quot; Fukushu added. &quot;Akira and I passed the time talking.&quot;<br />
<br />
While both the kitsunes wives seemed satisfied by this answer, Yuriko had her doubts. The ancient wizard now raising an eyebrow as she studied the two kitsune carefully. It was only the excited footsteps of the kits that now prevented her from pressing any questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; Sachiko said excitedly. &quot;Can me and Raiden go meet up with our friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What friends,&quot; Abolith asked as she narrowed her eyes at her son. Raiden now shifted nervously in place under his mothers sight. &quot;Some kids Sachiko knows,&quot; Raiden replied meekly. &quot;I&#39;ve hungout with them before mom. They&#39;re really nice. In fact they&#39;re teachers at Darren&#39;s school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you mean Gail, Ewart, and the others,&quot; Misaki exclaimed as she followed behind the kits. &quot;I didn&#39;t know you were friends of theirs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that the group of children I met Sachiko,&quot; Ayami asked to which the kit nodded.  Ayami now turned to the others to speak. &quot;I&#39;ve met these children,&quot; she said. &quot;They seem nice enough and are quite intelligent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has anyone forgotten the fact the Normal tried to kill our children not too long ago,&quot; Abolith stated. &quot;I&#39;m not sure it would be wise for them to journey off on their own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please mom,&quot; Raiden asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty please Mrs. Abolith,&quot; Sachiko begged.<br />
<br />
Abolith appeared unmoved by the children&#39;s pleading. While Misaki usually watched the kits, Abolith was uncomfortable with that idea, especially after the kumiho attacked. Besides the girl was still in mourning over the death of her Soul Drive. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can follow the children beloved,&quot; Fukushu stated. Abolith paused, sighing before shaking her head. &quot;No,&quot; she said softly. &quot;You have already been up all night. I will go. Let me just shower and change beforehand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Forty minutes later Abolith now found herself shadowing the kits as they sprinted towards their meeting spot. Sticking to the trees, the elf assassin had little trouble following the excited kits. Staying out of sight, the elf now carefully watched as a group of five young teens now meet up with the two kits.<br />
<br />
A small smirk now spread across Aboliths face as she watched her son. Raiden appeared far happier than she had seen before. Abolith now found herself second guessing herself. Perhaps she had been too cautious in raising the boy. Yes, they had enemies but the joy she now saw on Raidens face made her have doubts.<br />
<br />
Those doubts though were quickly dismissed as she noticed movement near her son. Something was close by, a potential threat to her child. Unsheathing her blade, Abolith now deftly lept among the trees before landing in front of the trespasser. The elf somewhat surprised to learn their identity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shizen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shizen, the celestial kitsune matron and widow of Tatsu now stood in a clearing some 30 yards from Raiden and Sachiko. The red nine tailed kitsune sporting a serene smile as she gazed at Abolith. &quot;Greetings Abolith how are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here Shizen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have simply come to see my grandson,&quot; Shizen replied. &quot;I do not get to see him as often as I like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith gave the kitsune a stiff nod, her eyes scanning the area as she stood in front of Shizen. &quot;Do you always travel with guards,&quot; she said, pointing to the tress behind Shizen. <br />
<br />
&quot;A precaution,&quot; Shizen answered, motioning for her body guards to join her. Abolith watched as two seven tailed kitsune now emerged from hiding. Abolith giving her mother in law a smirk. The assassin had identified a total of five bodyguards with Shizen. The two seven tails were visible but Abolith had noticed three five tails hiding in the trees, their rifles now fixed on the elf assassin. &quot;Kitsune and their tricks,&quot; she thought with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;My people have been more cautious since the untimely passing of my husband,&quot; Shizen said sadly. &quot;But you have nothing to fear Abolith. What I said was true, I only wish to see my grandson and to talk with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk,&quot; Abolith asked raising an eyebrow. &quot;What do you wish to talk about Shizen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t a mother talk to her daughter in law?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith chuckled, sheathing blade before folding her arms across her chest. &quot;Daughter in law,&quot; she laughed. &quot;If I recall correctly Shizen, you were not exactly thrilled when Fukushu took me as his beloved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I had arranged for Jiro...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu,&quot; Abolith replied quickly, causing Shizen to smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;For my son to enter an arranged marriage,&quot; Shizen grinned. &quot;It was customary at the time. I found a very lovely young vixen for him. Still, I always respected you. Not only for your strength of will but your love for my son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you wish to talk about,&quot; Abolith asked. Shizen now slowly approached, the same serene smile on her face. &quot;You have no idea about your sons nature do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean,&quot; Abolith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiden and Sachiko are the next celestial kitsunes,&quot; Shizen said. &quot;In time they will grow to lead our people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith was flabbergasted, her son a kitsune God? It seemed unbelievable, yet it would also explain why the Normal had targeted the kits. Aboliths eyes now narrowed as she realized what this meant. &quot;Who knows about the kits nature?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack and Kellie,&quot; Shizen stated. &quot;And some of our closest allies. The leaders of dragons, the tanuki, the mummies, the fairies. Only a handful of people are aware of the kits nature at this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Yuriko too,&quot; Abolith sneered. &quot;That wizard probably let it slip about my son. She has always hated myself and Fukushu. She would betray us all, even to the Normal if it meant hurting Fukushu and myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuriko hasn&#39;t been told yet,&quot; Shizen replied. &quot;But you are correct. Someone has betrayed us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith now found herself torn, she had been right about a traitor yet it wasn&#39;t their old enemy. &quot;So what would you have me do to protect my son?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping to convince you to make your arrangements with Yuriko more permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t be serious,&quot; Abolith stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite serious,&quot; Shizen countered. &quot;Yuriko&#39;s home is quite secure. The magic surrounding the home is powerful enough to keep the children safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you expect to convince Yuriko to agree to this,&quot; Abolith asked. Shizen chuckled, flashing the elf a sly grin.  &quot;I can be quite persuasive,&quot; she grinned. &quot;When Yuriko discovers the kits nature she would feel the need to protect them at all costs. Remember, I&#39;ve known her her whole life as well. I know she always strives to protect others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it means you would be able to see your grandson and Fukushu more often,&quot; Abolith replied with a smirk. Shizen simply nodded, she was a kitsune after all. Perhaps not to trick Yuriko but to make a situation more advantageous for herself. Abolith simply shrugged her shoulders, to protect her son she would swallow her pride. Even if it meant sharing a home with an old enemy or seeing her mother in law more often.</p>
