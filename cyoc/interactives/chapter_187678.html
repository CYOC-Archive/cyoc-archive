<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Like most teens his age, Cindy&#39;s brother Sam didn&#39;t have an alarm clock.  Instead, he gradually emerged from sleep as the chimes of his cell phone reminded him it was time to start the day.  The sheet over his face felt uncomfortably damp -come to think of it the blankets covering the rest of him also felt damp- and with an clumsy yank he tugged the sheet off his head.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s vision was blurry as his eyes adjusted to the daylight streaming into the room.  The young teen threw his gangly legs over the edge of the bed and stood up, stretching and groaning.  He could tell that his computer monitor was still on from last night&#39;s gaming session.  Blinking away the sleep, Sam noticed immediately that his feet felt weird.  His fingertips felt weird.  In fact, his whole body felt...weird!  He looked down and with his eyesight clearing he saw that his feet were different.  They were big, REALLY big, the tops covered with patches of dark-brown shaggy hairs the same coloration as the unkempt brown hair that he&#39;d always had on his head.  For just a moment he thought that his sister had pulled a prank and put some novelty slippers on him while he&#39;d been asleep.  &quot;Ha, ha, very funny, Cindy,&quot; he said out loud but when he wiggled his toes, the bulbous toes of the &quot;slipper&quot; wiggled too as did the wicked inch-long claws capping the end of each toe.<br />
<br />
The realization came quickly and suddenly Sam was wide awake.  &quot;Oh shit, those aren&#39;t slippers.  They&#39;re my actual feet!&quot; Sam whispered to himself.  His disbelieving eyes traveled slowly up his hairy legs -far too hairy for any boy his age- and came to rest on his dick.  He&#39;d been impatiently waiting for puberty to hit along with a growth of normal manly pubic hair but this was ridiculous!  His nutsack was completely covered in a swathe of silky tan hairs that spilled over his taint and inner thighs.  Sam&#39;s penis hadn&#39;t escaped the changes either, a pouch of fur-covered skin having grown partway up his still-human shaft pulling it parallel with his groin.  &quot;Shit.  Oh Shit!&quot; he moaned.  The teen reached up with shaking fingers to confirm that the odd growth of furry skin around the base of his dick was real and suddenly saw that his hand -heck, his whole arm!- was not untouched.  His fingernails were thicker and more claw-like (although not quite as long as his toeclaws) while the tops of his hands were covered in a shaggy pelt that ran up his forearms fading out near his elbows.  These hairs were just like the hairs on his feet and were darker brown in color than the tan hairs that covered his penis.  He hesitatingly ran his fingers through the shag.  Given how lush it felt he had to admit that he&#39;d sprouted what appeared to be the start of a healthy fur coat.<br />
<br />
Sam was dumbfounded.  How was this possible?  He&#39;d dreamed something just like this but people didn&#39;t just wake up with these kind of changes in real life.  There was definitely no way this was puberty -he wasn&#39;t even turning into something fully human!   Was he a werewolf?  He hadn&#39;t been bitten by any dogs or wolves lately but who knew how werewolfery worked anyhow?!  Frantic to see what else might have transformed on his body, he at first headed toward the hallway bathroom right outside his bedroom door but then realized that he couldn&#39;t be seen like this by his sister or mom.  They&#39;d totally freak! <br />
<br />
Instead, Sam grabbed his phone with a clawed hand and turned on selfie mode.  He could only stare at the screen in shock as he looked at what had become of him.  The boy&#39;s cheeks were unnaturally  swollen and his nose had tipped up so that his nostrils were now facing directly out like some kind of animal.  Even now they were twitching, sampling the various scents carried on the air currents of his room.  He could smell his own mix of boyish human body odor, light animal musk, and a sharp peppery smell that his brain tagged as &#39;fear.&#39;  Somehow he could also detect another scent signature in the room -something deeper and more animal than even his own mixed scent.  His sheets and covers reeked of it.  Something had been in his room and maybe it was this...thing...that had somehow changed him.<br />
<br />
Looking back at the phone screen, Sam could see that short tan hairs -no, fur- ran up the bridge of his nose and faded out as it reached his forehead.  His once modest sideburns had grown down into full muttonchops that flared outward into triangular cheek ruffs of brown fur.  His eyebrows were definitely bushier too and for the first time he noticed that a rakish puff of tan fur had sprouted between his pecs.  It was identical in coloration to the new tan pubic fur that covered his crotch and balls.  <br />
<br />
But it was his ears that set him off.  They were no longer the pink seashell-like appendages he was used to seeing sticking out of the sides of his head.  He&#39;d always been embarrassed by their size and wished they looked different.  He&#39;d gotten his wish but not in the way he wanted.  His ears had certainly changed,  having migrated up the side of his skull.  But reflected in the pixels of the phone screen were not the perky triangular ears of the werewolf he expected to see peaking through his messy uncombed mop, but rather the round half-moon ears of the young werebear that he realized he was on his way to becoming.  <br />
<br />
The big furry feet...the claws...the half-muzzle.  They were his and they were REAL.  It was too much to handle.  The teenager dropped his phone and opening his mouth tried to scream but what emerged was the high-pitched roar of a grizzly cub in distress.</p>
