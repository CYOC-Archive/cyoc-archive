<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Russ was proud of Jake for only having one B at mid-term, and it was the same class that Russ was struggling with, an introduction to business course that had a rather difficult professor. September ended with the two having lived together for six weeks, and Russ already having to keep Jake on task. October would also prove difficult for Jake. Russ had the distance factor to help him out with Jake in high school, but now they were sleeping in the same bed, and Jake&#39;s sex appetite has always been high, but so was Russ&#39;s. There were several projects assigned during October and they worked together when allowed, but some were independent. The campus Greek societies had their rush and initiation periods. October was also a whole month of Halloween themed activities. Jake was very cautious going out in public, but was the one who enjoyed the costumed themed events, although Russ got on board after a couple of events. Jake and Russ spent some time on making their real life animal forms look more stuffed animal and cartoon like. Russ made getting homework done a prerequisite to attending any costumed party/event/activity. Russ enjoyed getting Jake out of his shell and comfortable in social situations, and they grew their circle of social contacts. Jake and Russ ate with a group of students who liked to dress as costume animals outside of Halloween. Several members of the group had costumes that were almost as lifelike as Jake/Russ&#39;s anthro forms. A couple of male members of this smaller group were a bit forward with Russ and Jake, grinding their fake tails into Russ or Jake&#39;s groin during costume functions and otherwise being aggressive sexually. Jake and Russ were very cautious with this, as they had not experienced this before, other than between themselves. Jake wanted to give this whole socializing a chance, and they found a group they could relate with, but two sexually aggressive men were making this difficult for Jake and Russ both. <br />
<br />
One day, Jake sat down next to Russ at the lunch table, when one of the two aggressive guys sat down next to Jake, and immediately reached his hand between Jake&#39;s legs. Jake reached down and squeezed the guy&#39;s hand until he thought he was going to break his bones, and whispered where the man and Russ could both hear, &quot;Please don&#39;t touch, and don&#39;t sit next to me or my friend anymore.&quot; Russ looked angrily at the male student. After that, he and his other touchy friend no longer sat with the group. Others in the group were very welcoming of the news, as they were giving their small group a bad reputation at the costume events. The whole thing made Jake and Russ both less trusting of people in general, and they were now part of a small group that enjoyed their company. Jake and Russ only attended Halloween events after that if the other members of their group were attending.<br />
<br />
Jake had also been dealing with what Russ was calling his knotting addiction. Russ dealt with this before during the summer with Jake, when he would spend a week or more a Jake&#39;s. Russ found that just having Jake eliminate his balls did a lot to reduce his sex drive. Russ did this the first time, and found out that if either one of them makes a change on the other, it can only be undone by the one who made the change. Jake spent all of the weekdays in October without testicles or a scrotum. Each night, he curled up as a full canine at Russ&#39;s feet to sleep after they took turns knotting each other before bed. Academics were top priority, and the boys did well in October. Russ kept himself and Jake on task the entire month without any harsh conversations. Russ would feel guilty for Jake having to go ball-less for so long, but the results were too good, and Jake was the first to admit he was sex addict with Russ. The dorm neighbors across the shared bathroom moved out, though at different times, as one got a spot on the football team and went into the athletic dorm, the other just left without a word.<br />
<br />
Halloween week was fun for both Jake and Russ. The professors seemed to be making a big push in assignments before the early November drop date. The two along with their like minded group attended the sponsored costume parties each night. The best costume prizes went to a viking or a spartan, usually someone showing the most cleavage and skin. Jake had a cartoon anthro rabbit he preferred for these things while Russ went with as an anthro gorilla. They always left the parties early so they had time for themselves to knot up before sleep. Campus was quiet on the morning of November 1st. Russ awoke first, and moved down to a still sleepy canine Jake, slowly stroking his fur while nibbling on his pointed shepherd ears. Russ was proud of Jake for making it through the month with better grades, and Jake was proud he made it through with good grades and was happy he had Russ to keep nudging him along.</p>
