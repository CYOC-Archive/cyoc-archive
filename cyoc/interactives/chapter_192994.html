<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick looked through the photos from yesterday of himself on Max’s shoulder. “Even though I was angry yesterday, you do know I had fun, right?”<br />
<br />
Max smiled and nodded. “I know you did. I’m glad you liked the extra humiliation option. But yeah, I deserved that. I’ll be more careful next time I’m the human in charge.”<br />
<br />
Rick zoomed in on the picture of his hamster form. “Good deal. I really did have fun yesterday. But this day is all about you!”<br />
<br />
Max grinned. “Yep. I finally get to be a German Shepherd. This is gonna rule.” He started to take off his clothes. “I’ll go set the parameters on the Chronivac.”<br />
<br />
“Okay. Please let me go over them with you<br />
before you press submit. I don’t want you to get overzealous and do something foolish.” Rick left Max to the computer while he scrolled through his phone. He pondered the idea of making a Twitter account specifically for showing off his transformation exploits. To the public, it would look like a cute animal account. No one would be wise to the fact that the men in the pictures traded off being the animals as well.<br />
<br />
Max sat his bare butt down before the Chronivac once again, this time, to set his own transformation parameters.<br />
<br />
It was early in the day. The two friends had planned to make a full day out of this transformation. He also wanted to enjoy the time while transforming a bit more. Max set it so that it would take one full hour to transform. He’d be a dog for 12 hours, from about 9am to 9pm. He went into the advanced settings and switched his transformation time back into a human to only be a minute. There wasn’t as much fun for him taking so long to shift back to normal.<br />
<br />
Max had a full day planned out. He’d gone to the pet store last night and bought a collar, leash, a dog bowl, some wet and dry dog food, a water bowl, and some balls and toys for Rick to throw around. They’d start the morning at home, Max would bring in the paper, they’d have breakfast, and then they go to the park and throw the ball around. They’d take a walk around the neighborhood, hopefully meet some other dogs. Max also swung the idea of being taken to the groomers, but Rick wasn’t sure how long that would take, so Max left funds to have him dog-groomed only if there was an appointment available. They’d finish the night at Rick’s home with some dinner, lounging around, lots of petting, and then a quick transformation back to normal. A perfect time.<br />
<br />
He flipped through the options and ensured that pleasurable was still turned on, but was set at about 50%. He didn’t want to spend his entire transformation humping everything. He turned the “discomfiture” setting completely off: it just wasn’t for him. <br />
<br />
The advanced settings let him tweak things a bit more. Previously, Max and Rick had their full human brains intact while transformed. Max wanted to keep that, but he had to admit, part of the allure to being a dog was the free enthusiasm. He tweaked his settings to ensure he still was all there, but instead having 100% control over shutting down animal instincts, he lowered it to 85%. He thought that should give him the ability to let loose a bit more, while still being humanly conscious about situations if need be.<br />
<br />
Rick walked over to Max, still butt-naked in front of the Chronivac. He was still clothed, and he chuckled to himself at the fact his straight friend was just casually naked at his computer. Rick peered at the screen and saw all the advanced settings revealed.<br />
<br />
“This looks a lot more complicated than yesterday,” Rick said.<br />
<br />
“I’m trying to give myself a bit more of a dog brain,” Max replied. “Let loose.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure that’s a good idea? What if dog you is like human you and isn’t very obedient?”<br />
<br />
“Ugh. I promise I’ll follow directions.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah? Are you gonna be a ‘good boy?’” Rick snickered a bit.<br />
<br />
Max didn’t respond to Rick’s negging. It wasn’t because he found it unnerving, rather, he broke a small sweat as the phrase made him get a bit hard.<br />
<br />
“That’s enough fiddling with the settings.” Max said. He got up and let Rick sit in the chair to review the parameters. <br />
<br />
Rick nodded his head as he scrolled. “It’s going to be interesting watching you turn into a pup over an hour.”<br />
<br />
Max looked at the screen. “You didn’t change it to a puppy, did you?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, no, that was just a change of term. I’m seeing you’re set to a German Shepherd purebred at 2 years right now. Sound good?” Rick looked back at Max, who nodded his head in agreement. “You ready for me to press start?”<br />
<br />
Max stepped back and nodded. “Yes. Let’s get this puppy running!”<br />
<br />
Rick chuckled again and initiated the change. Looking back at Max, there weren’t any immediate changes, but the clock was definitely locked in and ticking down the hour.<br />
<br />
“So,” Rick said. “Since you’re under the control of the Chronivac starting now, I guess you could say that your transformation vacation has already begun.”<br />
<br />
Max stood in place. He titled his head, not sure what Rick was getting at.<br />
<br />
“So, at what point to you want me to start treating you like a dog?” <br />
<br />
Now it was Max’s turn to chuckle at his predicament. He hadn’t thought this far ahead. “I guess it would be interesting to, you know, be treated like a dog as I am turning.”<br />
<br />
“Well then,” Rick replied. “First things first, you better get on all fours, pup.”<br />
<br />
Max froze for a moment, and then did as Rick said. He tried his best to ignore the fact that he was suddenly getting hard. He hoped being on all fours would help distract from his growing member.<br />
<br />
“Ha! Good boy.” Rick walked towards Max and pet this head. <br />
<br />
Max found himself rubbing back against Rick’s hand. “You’re hilarious, you know.”<br />
<br />
“Uh-uh,” Rick replied. “Good dogs don’t talk. I wanna hear only barks from you for the rest of the day.” <br />
<br />
Max smiled and gave a small “woof” in response.<br />
<br />
“Now boy, sit.” Rick stood in front of Max and pointed his finger down.<br />
<br />
Max did as he was asked, sitting his buttocks on his legs behind him. Only when he was done did he question whether it was easy to comply because he wanted to, or if there was some animal instinct already taking over.<br />
<br />
“Oh my,” Rick said. “Looks like someone is already excited.” He pointed at Max’s now raging erection. <br />
<br />
Max was embarrassed at the observation and avoided eye contact with Rick. He didn’t try covering up, however. Dogs didn’t have modesty, he knew.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, boy,” Rick said, scratching behind Max’s ear. “That’s not the only change that’s coming. It looks like your ears are already getting a bit fuzzier and pointier.” Rick ran his fingers across them to make his point. “Looks like the rest of your body is getting a bit furrier, too.”<br />
<br />
Max felt his ears. There were relocating, already a bit higher, and furrier. He ran his hand across his nose and felt it was…wetter? That made him really happy, and he started panting a bit.<br />
<br />
“You little goof,” Rick said. “Only took three minutes for you to get into acting like a dog. How lucky am I to have met you? A grown man, mostly, on my floor slowly getting more canine.” He started to pet Max, first on the head, and then as hairs started appearing all over his body, getting ticker and more golden or black, then started migrating down his back.<br />
<br />
Max was still obediently sitting on the floor, and as the minutes passed with Rick petting him, a small tail began to appear above his butt. As the minutes ticked, it grew long, eventually sweeping the floor with happiness.<br />
<br />
At the fifteen minute mark, Max felt the need to readjust and got off the floor a bit. He realized his legs were getting shorter and he didn’t even feel it happening while Rick was petting him. He looked down at his hands, and found instead they’d shifted more towards paws, his fingers growing shorter and nails turning into claws.<br />
<br />
Max started to speak his astonishment, but instead of words, all the came out were soft growls. <br />
<br />
“Ooh, looks like my good boy can’t talk anymore,” Rick said. <br />
<br />
With the words “Good Boy,” Max felt a shutter through his body, specifically, his now shifting dick. It felt harder than ever, but he could still feel it pull back into his body. His junk shifted back towards his asshole and tail, until his now much furrier balls hung between his thighs. His cock was enveloped by a furry sheath now, also drawn further down and back on his crotch.<br />
<br />
Rick stood up and walked across the room. “I think my little doggy needs to get used to his changing body,” he said, snapping and patting his leg. “Come on boy! Come on Max!”<br />
<br />
Max did his best to get on his feet-paws instead of his shifting knees. He slowly padded over to Rick, who surprised him with a tennis ball.<br />
<br />
“You ready to try some fetch?” Rick wiggled the ball in front of the changing man’s face.<br />
<br />
A nearly involuntary ruff! escaped Max’s mouth. He started to pant as Rick wound up  the ball in the air. Rick tossed it gently across the room, and Max did his best to turn around and crawl back over to grab it. <br />
<br />
His mouth had only changed a bit in the twenty minutes or so since he started to shift, but even so, Max got his mouth around the ball. He padded back to Rick, who greeted him with pets between his ever-pointier and higher ears. <br />
<br />
“Good boy!” Rick said before tossing the ball again. Max turned around to fetch it again.<br />
<br />
This went on blissfully for an amount of time  that Max was losing track of. But Rick could see as his friend shifted closer and closer to being a full dog. He could tell it was easier for Max to walk and run in his new form, as he lost the ability to stand up for the rest of the day. His whole demeanor was unmistakably dog, not man. His mouth was pulling outward, linking his now black nose and nostrils with a long maw, out of which panted a long tongue whenever Max greeted him with a retrieved ball.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you’re well on your way, boy,” Rick said, petting Max’s all over fur.<br />
<br />
Max was in bliss. He realized how much of his body was dog now and was loving to let loose. As Rick continued to give him scritches, Max rolled over on his back to exposed his belly. As Rick moved to pet his chest, Max could feel how much his body had changed. He was past halfway there, and his new skeletal features were giving him such bliss.<br />
<br />
“Aw, you want those belly rubs, boy? You just want me to rub that belly?” Rick noticed as Max’s still human-like cock wiggled out of his proto-sheath. It was so hard was growing red.<br />
<br />
Max could feel this too, of course. He felt as his sheath served its purpose and felt so animalistic, his balls growing furrier and hanging deep between his legs. He would have been embarrassed if he wasn’t so catch up in Rick rubbing his belly.<br />
<br />
Rick decided to point out Max’s arousal. “It looks like you’re getting a bit excited, huh, boy! You like when I pet your belly? You like turning into my little pet doggie?”<br />
<br />
Max whined with pleasure. He did like being a good boy, being a doggie, being owned by Rick, the belly rubs. He loved it so much!<br />
<br />
Rick’s eyes went wide as he heard Max give powerful growl as his cock spurt a huge load over his own belly and chest. Cum blasted load after load all over him, and some got on Rick’s hand.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow,” Rick said, withdrawing his hand to look at the mess of human dna coating the back of his hand. “You’re one horny pup, huh? Was that the last of your humanity leaving you?”<br />
<br />
Max awooed in agreement. His tail was really long now, nearly to full size. It wagged feverishly on its own. Rick got up to grab a rag to wipe himself off, and Max got up to follow, not caring as cum dropped on the floor below him. His dick was now fully changed and resting properly in its sheath, his balls full, resting in their proper place below his hole just like a dogs.<br />
<br />
“I think it’s time for this then,” Rick said. The next thing Max knew, a collar was being placed around his neck. He jumped in slight surprise with the click of the snap. It was a bit tight, and suddenly, his back paws was coming up to try and scratch it off. He hadn’t even tried to use his former hands to prod at the snaps, he had just instinctively addressed the change like the pup he was!<br />
<br />
After a few moments, Max realized the collar wasn’t tight, it was just right. He knew a little dog bone-shaped tag was dangling from it, one that read his name: Max. He wasn’t Max a human anymore, though. He was Max the dog. Rick’s dog Max.<br />
<br />
The hour was almost up, but it was clear that Max was a dog now. The little humanity he had left was inconsequential and would fade. He was now a German Shepherd for the rest of the day, and would be treated as such.<br />
<br />
“Well, boy, what should we do first?”</p>
