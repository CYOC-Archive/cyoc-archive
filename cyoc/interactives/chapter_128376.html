<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Actually cleaning the dorm wasn&#39;t too bad, it wasn&#39;t all that big after all and none of the inhabitants lived like slobs; Tiffany just wished the two of them wouldn&#39;t stare at her so much. The next few hours were a blur as she rushed around the dorm dusting, sweeping and scrubbing every inch of it as thoroughly as she could manage; by the end the only part she didn&#39;t touch was the bedroom of her third room mate Zack who had gone out for the day and left his door locked.<br />
<br />
“Huh, you actually did a good job” Mike said as he looked around the sparkling common area. “I don&#39;t think the place was this clean even when we moved in”. Inside Tiffany glowed with pride, thrilled to be receiving her Master&#39;s praise. Again she resented the feeling knowing it was just a part of the maid personality she&#39;d been forced to adopt, but she just couldn&#39;t shake how happy she felt being complimented for her work”.<br />
<br />
“I think you deserve a reward” He said and turned to stare down the front of her dress, his naked lust on obvious display. “It&#39;s about time I properly sampled the goods anyway. Watching that cute butt of yours for all this time has got me worked up”.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d be happy to serve you however you like Master” Tiffany heard herself say. Looking at him she felt the raging heat of desire return as Master&#39;s earlier order reasserted itself and realised she&#39;d actually meant what she said. She imagined taking his cock inside herself and felt the void between her legs ache to be filled.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s what I like to hear” He said grinning as he took Tiffany by the hand and led her to his freshly cleaned bedroom. As soon as Mike locked the door behind them he threw off his clothes and reclined on the bed. “Now why don&#39;t you take that off nice and slow then come and join me”.<br />
<br />
The young maid&#39;s heart thudded in her chest as she saw Master strip and show off his cock. It seemed as though, unlike Lewis, he hadn&#39;t wished for the Genie to enhance his manhood; she&#39;d gotten a pretty good look while sucking on it earlier and it was the same size now as it then. Tearing her eyes away from his throbbing member she slowly began to take off her uniform; taking her inspiration from all the porn she&#39;d watched over the years she took off what she was wearing piece by piece, letting it all fall to the floor with a seductive smile.<br />
<br />
Now totally naked she stepped towards the bed and climbed onto it on all fours. “How would you like me to serve you Master” she asked then leaned down to lick his cock, slowly running base to tip she tasted the pre-cum leaking from it. <br />
<br />
For a moment his only response was a pleasured grunt then he reached down and lifted his maid&#39;s head with a gentle finger under her chin. “As much fun as it was I&#39;ve already made good use of your mouth today. This time I&#39;m claiming one of your other holes”. Flipping Tiffany over he positioned himself above her, manoeuvred over the opening of her waiting pussy and dived in. <br />
<br />
Tiffany gave a moan of pleasure as she felt the folds of her aching sex pushed open and was penetrated for the first time. “That&#39;s right, I like it when my girls are loud” her Master said as he started thrusting in and out. Her body felt like it was exploding as the hole inside her was repeatedly pounded faster and faster. “This is it, almost there” he said working his way to the top of his rhythm. “Scream for me!” And as a stream of hot cum sprayed inside her she did.<br />
<br />
Spent, Mike rolled off his conquest and panted with the exertion; his breathing gradually slowed and was soon replaced with snores as he fell asleep. Tiffany laid still on the bed listening to him and feeling the seed sit inside her for a while longer before standing up and letting the white liquid start to slither down her thigh. “I suppose I&#39;ll be needing another shower now” she thought as she collected her clothes from the floor and stepped backwards out into the hall closing the door behind her and making sure to make no noise as she did. <br />
<br />
“You enjoyed that didn&#39;t you sissy” The voice stopped Tiffany in her tracks, looking up she saw Lewis blocking her path. “The whole building probably heard you getting fucked in there. You really got me all hot and bothered today parading those monster tits of yours around in that slutty little outfit. I think it&#39;s only fair you help me take the edge off”. He grabbed his crotch as if to emphasise his point as he looked down hungrily at the naked girl in front of him. <br />
<br />
As much as she had genuinely enjoyed her first taste of sex as a woman, it&#39;d left her fairly sore and Tiffany felt no inclination to go through it again right now. Even if she had wanted to she had no intention of sleeping with a man other than Master and especially not a brute like Lewis. “Just let me past please, I&#39;m tired” she said trying to dodge around him.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re not getting away that easily” he said grabbing her arm as she tried to slip by and throwing her to the floor. “Like I said, it&#39;s your fault that I&#39;ve got all this pent up stress by being a fucking tease all day and you&#39;re going to do something about it. How about I wrap those lovely tits around my little friend here and give you another face full of jizz to go with what&#39;s dribbling out of your pussy right now, after that I think I&#39;ll go in through the rear and give you a complete set. I bet you&#39;d love to have cum dripping out of all your holes at once wouldn&#39;t you sissy”.<br />
<br />
“No, please just let me go to bed”.<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t get to say no” He said anger began to etch itself onto his face. “I thought you had to do what you&#39;re told since that Genie fucked with your head”.<br />
<br />
“That only works for Master” she replied, tears of fear starting to roll down her cheeks. <br />
<br />
“Well he&#39;s not here is he. You&#39;ll do as I say one way or another; now shut up and take your fucking like the good little slut you are”.<br />
<br />
Briefly Lewis looked down to undo his jeans and Tiffany saw her chance. While he was distracted fumbling with buttons and zippers she rolled to her feet and sprinted back to Masters room locking the door behind her. Panting she slid to the floor with her back to the door as the reality of what had almost just happened crashed over her like a storm surge. <br />
<br />
“I have to stop this somehow, get back to normal” she thought to herself. “If I stay like this it&#39;s only a matter of time before he gets me alone and corners me”. As had just been amply demonstrated Master wouldn&#39;t always be around to get Lewis to back off and as she remembered what Master had said when she&#39;d been groped in the common area there was no guarantee he would even if he was there, he had promised to give Lewis a turn after all.<br />
<br />
Tiffany looked down at the drying cum still clinging to the inside of her leg and resolved to do something about both of them rather than accept role of fuck toy they seemed bent on forcing her into. Listening at the door she breathed a sigh of relief as she heard Lewis stomping down the hall back to his own room; good, let him stew in his blue balls. <br />
<br />
The only thing that could get her out of this mess was the lamp and Tiffany started to search for it as quietly as she could, desperate not to wake Master and let him find her rummaging for it. At the back of the cupboard under a pile of old clothes her heart leapt as she saw the distinctive bronze glint of her prize. She couldn&#39;t believe he&#39;d used just a pathetic hiding place, but she wasn&#39;t about to look a gift horse in the mouth. Using it now was too risky, if Master caught her he&#39;d certainly order her to never touch it again and she&#39;d loose her chance. Instead she decided to cover it back up and wait until he left for class in the morning to make her move. Leaving no trace of her tampering she slid back onto the bed and listened to the snoring as she drifted off to sleep.</p>
