<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake looked at the two vampire bat demons and ...<br />
... said, &quot;with each part I take from your body&#39;s, it will give those humans standing below you an equal part of your vampire demon soul, replacing and switching it with equal parts of their human soul until it has made them turn into two new Vampire Incubus demons.  All four of you will hear and obey my words and thoughts. And only my words and thoughts can ever change what I&#39;ve taken from you, and only I can ever change you back again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, let me think a moment more ...<br />
<br />
Either the feral vampire bats were extremely feral, or they&#39;d both heard the horrors of Jacob Mark Williams new exploits spreading through all 9-levels of Hell, because as soon as Jake looked at them, they had stopped their frenzy attacks against the unbreakable barriers Jake&#39;d created around the Hellcage, and stared, wild-eyed at him with silent fearful looks of obvious animal-like panic.<br />
<br />
Jake chuckled from the absolute terror and horror in the emo twin&#39;s expressions, too.  Both now saw the demon bat creatures trapped inside the blue, electrically buzzing static zapping bird cage-like Hellcages restraining both impossible human-size demon vampire bats 6-feet up in the air, directly above and alongside each of them, but it was also the look of shock and surprise Jake wanted from the human twins.<br />
<br />
And as Jake shared his thoughts into their four minds, each began reacting to what they&#39;d all heard would soon be happening to each of them as though his thoughts were spoken to each of them individually, in their own language, with increasing shock and growing terror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once I&#39;ve started with you, Heinrich, Dietrich, you&#39;ll both feel--and watch if you can--each part of your demon donor&#39;s body parts replacing your body parts with their&#39;s.  Cool name&#39;s you two.  Chinh and Thinh Tran.  And you both share the same middle name?  How ... cool.  So it&#39;s Chinh Quang Tran, and your brother is Thinh Quang Tran. It seems your Vietnamese donor Thinh Quang Tran&#39;s getting excited about giving you his long tail and large black pelted wings, Dietrich, that is until he discovers he can&#39;t inflict sleep on anyone now, and lost his ability to fly.  But I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll become much more angry when his ears, tongue, teeth and eyes have switched with each of your&#39;s and he loses all of his bat instincts and his blood-sucking ability once his body has your human digestive tract in him instead. And once those parts have become your&#39;s, Dietrich, gaining his erect bat penis will clearly give you all the same feral bat lusts and arousing impulses and wild cravings Thinh&#39;s Desmodus bat&#39;s own sexual pleasures and feral thoughts made him gain a few years ago.  Seems their Vietnamese gang was overrun by too many Latino gangs at your school.  He&#39;s been enjoying his new demon life sucking the blood out of all the young sexy classmates he and his twin have been feeding on without getting caught, and soon it will be your turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Heinrich screamed, disgusted by the twisted and impossible thoughts coming from the Hellspawn demon.  That wasn&#39;t fair.  He didn&#39;t want his twin to become a blood-sucking vampire demon bat like Thinh Quang Tran.  &quot;He&#39;ll never suck out some homo guy&#39;s blood no matter what you want, cause he won&#39;t be no freakin&#39; vampire ba-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silence, Heinrich!&quot; Jake interrupted, hearing enough foolishness out of this young human.  Jake chuckled.  Once Heinrich received Chinh&#39;s same permanently stiff glossy dark red bat penis with all his reproductive organs, he&#39;d be as sexually aroused by other males as Chinh Tran was.  &quot;Then I&#39;ll switch your&#39;s with Chinh first, Heinrich.  I really am going to enjoy watching your reaction while you turn into a vampire bat demon, kid.  I think you might be squirting Chinh&#39;s sperm from your new Vietnamese bat penis before it&#39;s even done turning you into a completely gay boy cocksucker and a fuck crazy blood-drinking Initiate Incubus vampire bat, Heinrich.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Heinrich tried crying out he&#39;d never become gay, he looked up at those greasy black wings tucked against that bat&#39;s oily back, revealing the 5-foot-something length of those bat&#39;s wings reaching past the teen&#39;s hairy black buttocks, and shuddered from the sight of its long rat-like black tail flexing upwards between its legs.  Turning into a vampire was never something Heinrich ever imagined, but a freakin&#39; vampire bat?  That was nuts. Especially if it would mean his wings would look anything like that teen-size bat&#39;s wings above him.  They were a glistening wet jet-black, as though slick with oil.  And the black shininess of them was as sleek and dirty as those lengthy curtains of its emo-looking fag hairstyle that reached all the way down to Chinh Tran&#39;s shoulders, and swung back and forth on his face like the bat thing spent hours to make its velvety strands hang down so straight, just like all the queer emo addicted guys he and D-man stayed away from who straightened their hair.  That was in fact why Heinrich really wanted to stop being an emo-punk teenager.  He hated all the fag lifestyle accusations.  Some of the emo teens in school were probably fags, but he and Dietrich weren&#39;t fags.  They both had slutty girlfriends.  Both had sex with each regularly.  And insults by the jocks at their high school had increased soon as Ernesto&#39;s older brother Chico returned.  The 17-year-old muscular senior wasn&#39;t only a jock, Chico was part of that gang of Latino&#39;s who took over the school&#39;s hallways once those Asian gangs and some slanty-eyed students had disappeared just a few years earlier.  Chico&#39;s return had even prompted the twins into Mohawk haircuts to distance them from those emo haters and beat downs that the Latino thugs were infamous for on every emo guy they saw.   <br />
<br />
&quot;I see you still don&#39;t understand what&#39;s about to happen to you, Heinrich,&quot; Jake said, and turned his attentions back onto the vampire bat&#39;s obvious Vietnamese features.  The young bat looked like it&#39;d once had the appearance of a middle school age emo teen despite being a 14-century-old demon that&#39;d become a vampire bat demon. &quot;Let me just tell you this, Heinrich, before these two vampire demons corrupt both you and your twin&#39;s human soul&#39;s with parts of their demon black soul&#39;s.  I&#39;ve come up with some revisions for you and Dietrich I think you&#39;ll both be very aroused with.  And once you look ... no, it&#39;s time to just show you what you&#39;re gonna look like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heinrich tried to yell out again but he still couldn&#39;t speak.<br />
<br />
Looking up at the bat&#39;s oily back, Heinrich noticed it&#39;s long black tail appeared to be shrinking, getting drawn back upwards into it&#39;s spine somehow, instantly feeling a bizarre tingling itch at the base of his own spine.  As the bat&#39;s tail revealed a large black spade at the end of it, Heinrich felt a growing dark presence or blackness growing in himself, immediately thinking how awesome the shiny black spade was as the itchy tingling in his spine became brutally painful for just a moment, and then vanished.<br />
<br />
And within seconds, Heinrich felt the rat-like tail growing outward from his spine, silently screaming with fear as that large black spade at the end of it curled upwards between his own legs and slapped itself up against his scrotum and limp, uncut 5&quot; penis.  Oh sheiss, Heinrich thought, cringing as the spade flattened against him and revealed the shiny black hairs coating the spade were sticky with moisture.  Before Heinrich could reach down to pull it off of himself, his eyes, tongue, and ears tingled like his spine had, and the momentary burn and painful itches were suddenly replaced by new sensations affecting his head.  As Heinrich realized what was happening, the added blackness flowing within him increased his fear and panic as saliva dripping fangs replaced his own teeth with the bat&#39;s own smaller pointy teeth.  Slightly thicker saliva filled his mouth, but Heinrich couldn&#39;t escape swallowing it as the longer, thinner tongue slid outwards and sucked back inwards so quickly it&#39;s longer length nearly choked him with its sour tasting fluid.  Then Heinrich felt his ears change as the bat&#39;s lengthy pointed bat ears replaced his own. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mein Got!&quot; Dietrich shouted, and glanced at the long black rat-like tail that&#39;d grown out of Heinrich&#39;s backside as his twin&#39;s ears were replaced by the bat&#39;s elongated black tufted pointy ears.  Dietrich looked upwards at the bat above and beside Heinrich, and said,  &quot;He&#39;s ... holy shit, Heinrich!  That bat just stole your blue eyes and you&#39;ve got it&#39;s black slant--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be silent, Dietrich!&quot; Jake shouted, forcing Dietrich&#39;s mouth closed.  &quot;Just watch your twin&#39;s changes, Dietrich. Silently.  Know this.  Once his change is halfway through, your&#39;s will begin so you&#39;ll gain Thinh&#39;s own required body parts the same as Heinrich is gaining Chinh&#39;s body parts so that your bodies can remain eternal twins.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heinrich now knew the tingling sensations at his eyes were what he&#39;d truly feared most.  He didn&#39;t know his eyes were black, but Dietrich confirmed his fears and shock that his eyes had actually been switched with that Asian bat&#39;s own slanted eyes.  He&#39;d only seen its narrow slanty eyes a second when it&#39;d turned it&#39;s head nearly a full 360-degrees around and looked at him with drooling vampire bloodlust, long enough to know that it was definitely once a human being, a male, and Asian.<br />
<br />
Heinrich also felt an increasingly growing thirst and hunger building up within himself, as if he hadn&#39;t eaten or had any food or even any drinks recently.  And he felt so ... hungry, so quickly, it was getting him even angrier now, too.  Then Heinrich cried out in silent shouts as the two slick black vampire bat wings stretched apart and spread open from his backbone as cracking snaps and muscles adjusted his back, shoulders and spine from the sharp crack of bones as each bat wing finished connecting and fusing those airfoil&#39;s bones deeply into Heinrich&#39;s own altered backbone.<br />
<br />
Shuddering from the gusts of potent smelling foreign musky body odors he smelled coming from the black hairs and moisture coating those greasy-looking bat wings, Heinrich was instantly shocked as his cock swelled hard with an immediate erection.  The horrible spicy body odor wasn&#39;t appealing, it was overpoweringly pungent and sweat-like, and then Heinrich felt those tingling sensations return with a merciless pressure inside his testicles.  Glancing downwards at his enlarged scrotum, Heinrich noticed it was also now shiny black, and the two balls inside it were far smaller but heavier than his own had been, sagging the scrotum inches lower.  Heinrich wanted to scream, and as he looked upward, he saw that the bat creature above him was ejaculating, spurting ropes of its cum outward in long, powerful curving arches that&#39;d shot upwards and outwards, landing about 6-feet away against the carpet.<br />
<br />
The tingling pressure at Heinrich&#39;s new shiny black scrotum spread to his penis, and glancing downwards, Heinrich watched in amazement as his 7&quot; boner was replaced by a glossy dark red 6&quot; thin shaft with a sharp pointy red tip at the end of it.  Heinrich felt his new shaft curving upwards as it rapidly stiffened, staring at the coal black animal foreskin of slick flesh that encased most of his penis inside it as an oily white rope of cum spurted out the tip of his dark red penis.  The two bulbous knots encircling the base of Heinrich&#39;s vampire bat penis swelled painfully harder, and Heinrich watched helplessly as his new penis squirted the next twelve ropes of Chinh&#39;s oily cum out with his lengthy, uncontrollable vampire bat climax.  As Heinrich finally felt the approaching end of the orgasms, he relaxed his bowels with the sudden need to piss, cringing as a thick stream of bat guano squirted out and splashed to the ground between his feet from his now hairy, black-rimmed asshole.<br />
<br />
And glancing beside him, Heinrich noticed his twin&#39;s similar changes had already started, shocked by how lovable Dietrich&#39;s face looked with the slanted black eyes of an Asian along with his distinctly German features and his blond spiky Mohawk.  He actually looks sexy, Heinrich thought, realizing he looked just like that, too.<br />
<br />
Heinrich felt extremely turned on and aroused by his twin&#39;s extremely smelly and sweaty body, now, and looking at the other males in the bedroom, it instantly made him want to jerk off when that sexy 20-something blond Incubus glanced at his cum-leaking stiff penis and smiled.  Everything inside Heinrich had made his libido one big sexual lusty craving for endlessly wild sex, filling his mind and thoughts with the overwhelmingly powerful cravings and dominating frenzied need to empty his seed in someone, along with planting his new ravenous hungry thirsts inside them.  Heinrich wanted to feast on their warm blood, to steal the warm juices flowing through their heated forms, and he wanted, no, he needed to share his feral lusts with every male he could find so they would share the same blood, giving them some of his blood so they&#39;d spread his feral blood and warmth into countless others.<br />
<br />
Unable to even understand those controlling wild thoughts in his head, Heinrich simply allowed them to direct his thoughts and attentions to the four other males he now smelled and clearly saw near him, growing aroused by their appealing male forms.  There was a new special bond he felt for one of them, the one that had his same features. Dietrich, Heinrich remembered, trying to make some sense out of the close link that they shared.  Dietrich wasn&#39;t his mate he knew, but they must have been related like twin offspring.<br />
<br />
And as Heinrich watched the special one squirt his thick bat seed from that pointed red spike jutting out of the same shiny long black sheath that was also surrounded with the same frizzy blond hairs that surrounded his black sheath, Heinrich silently moaned as two fat ropes of his bat seed spilled down his upright red spike with a feral vampire bat&#39;s increased arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see those last changes I added were needed,&quot; Jake thought, staring at the pale pink-fleshed feral vampire twin bats.  Both had matching light blond Mohawk&#39;s and far too small dark blond bushes of pubic hair around those very black-tinted Vietnamese foreskin&#39;s and bat-transformed permanent erection&#39;s.  &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll both enjoy the new filthy stench of those two sweaty bat&#39;s body odors you&#39;ll have to smell from now on, just like you made everyone have to endure the stink from your two grubby human body&#39;s.  Now you two will have to smell the strong odors from those two filthy bat&#39;s flesh soon as it&#39;s ... ah, there&#39;s the beginning one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heinrich shuddered as the tingling itchy sensation he&#39;d felt earlier erupted downward from his scalp to his toes, unsure what was now happening until he saw the dark, nearly black flesh seeping down his muscular abdomen, arms, legs and feet, instantly noticing the slick sheen from the different skin coloring that was rapidly replacing his own.  Looking over at his twin, Heinrich was finally able to make two clicking sounds of panic as the same change affecting his flesh was replicated on Dietrich&#39;s body.  Staring in helpless shock as long, jet-black emo straight hair coated his twin&#39;s scalp, Heinrich felt the same silky black oily hair flowing down to his shoulders with its girlishly long length as those same two distinct black waves of the shiny black center-parted hairs curved above his forehead.  Within just a few seconds, the flesh across Heinrich&#39;s entire body was a deep dark caramel brown, glistening nearly black, and both his pubes and the hair on his head was replaced with Chinh Quang Tran&#39;s dirtier moist Vietnamese hair as Chinh Tran&#39;s new pinkish-white scalp sported Heinrich Wagner&#39;s filthy blond Mohawk.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s strange, Jake thought.  Except for the long black hair on their head&#39;s, and the dense black pubes at their groins, the German twin&#39;s dark sweaty flesh was completely hairless.  Jake&#39;d also noticed the two Asian twins now had the young German twin&#39;s pale pinkish flesh, along with the blond twin&#39;s spiky Mohawk&#39;s and those blond pubic hairs at their groins, but the remainder of their flesh was also hairless.  Oh, now I remember, Jake thought, and briefly contemplated correcting their rushed change with everything on and in the flesh, not just the flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck not their fag hairstyles and pubes, too!&quot; Heinrich shrieked, the words coming from his drooling fanged mouth now more of an animal-like clicking sound that only Jake and Dietrich could fully understand.  Even the two teenage-looking Asian&#39;s with light blond spiky Mohawk&#39;s had not heard the low-pitched frequency of the sound with their own new human ears.  &quot;That one made us become them, Dietrich!  Now we&#39;re the Vietnamese vampire bats!  That one made us get their ... oh shit, dude, we both stink like them, too!  Oh shit, what now?  My fingers!  It&#39;s ... oh no, it&#39;s givin&#39; us both ... claws!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lifting his hand up to see this next change, Heinrich saw the fingernails on both of his black hands get replaced with slightly curved sharp pointed black 1-inch long claws, shrieking with renewed panic as the bones in both of his big toes made a loud cracking snap as they&#39;d repositioned higher upwards on both feet.  Within seconds, even they were equipped with black curved claws, but they were much larger and awkward looking, extending out sideways off each instep and hooked forward over 3-inches long, formed into stronger gripping talons instead of the short pointy black claws that had replaced his other eight toenails.<br />
<br />
Heinrich&#39;s leaping flight across the room with a single flap of his wings landed him on the far wall about 5 feet up from the floor, joined by Dietrich&#39;s same shrieking leap of panic against the opposite wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess those two Vietnamese bats were extremely feral bats,&quot; Jake giggled, and looked from the two pallid-skinned blond creatures over to those two Initiate Incubus Vampire bare-bats Heinrich and Dietrich now were.  &quot;Looks like I&#39;ve messed them up a bit, too.  Sorry guy&#39;s, but I think you two are trapped with their hairless bat bodies now, and I&#39;m sorta not sure if you&#39;ll ever be able to turn back into either your prior human forms, or even into their own human forms unless you&#39;re both willing to try switching your whole body&#39;s with them.  Of course, that&#39;ll mean you&#39;re going to be much more Vietnamese, although I should be able to retain some or most of your own brain&#39;s and memory&#39;s without you losing most of your own.  But you&#39;ll have to chose soon, because the longer both of you stay in bat forms, the more likely it is you&#39;ll be stuck in their feral bat forms without being able to change back in their human forms.  It&#39;s not my fault, well, it is, but ... oh oh.  I think it&#39;s about to get worse and make you feel even more aroused from another change I just tried correcting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse?&quot; Heinrich shrieked, unable to gain control of the wild anger and raging arousal that he felt.  How could this be worse, he thought, squirting a stream of ammonia ripe bat guano from his rectum.  &quot;He messed up and we&#39;re stuck with slanty Vietnamese eyes and fucking jet-black Asian long hair that smells worse than your dirty socks, Dietrich.  How can it posssibly get any worse if it gets us even more aroused?&quot;<br />
<br />
And Heinrich learned how worse it could get as the black flesh on his body suddenly sprouted oily black fur that gave off an even more pungent filthy body odor smell from Chinh Tran&#39;s sweaty body as his sweat was replaced with Chinh&#39;s oily vampire bat perspiration.  Both disgusted and intoxicated by those sweeter stronger smells, Heinrich ejaculated again before he felt his stiff penis knots inflating in preparation for another climax.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; Jake mumbled.  He realized the twin&#39;s were now turning more feral.  They were almost as feral as the two Vietnamese vampire bats had been, having about 45-percent of the two 14-century-year-old demon soul&#39;s that had already replaced their prior human soul&#39;s.  &quot;So, ah, what&#39;s it gonna be, you two?  I&#39;ll need an answer, like any minute.  You&#39;re either gonna be stuck with those two bat body&#39;s, now, or I can make one more change that will at least allow your two body&#39;s to return to their Vietnamese human forms.  What&#39;s your answer, boys?  Oh, and it&#39;ll be best if you&#39;re both in agreement with the choice, as twins, otherwise ... it could get more complicated since there&#39;s still one other change you two are going to have at every other sunset and sunrise with the two other humans that are about to arrive.  Well?  Yes or no, you two?  Dietrich?  Heinrich?  You still understand me, right?&quot;</p>
