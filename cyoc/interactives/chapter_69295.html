<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The teenager rolled out of bed, the world blurry around him. Sitting on the ground, leaning up against said bed, the teenager's right arm <br />
extended, fumbling on his night stand for those wonderful things that would bring everything into focus. A few seconds later, his <br />
searching finger found his glasses, and then the young man stood, yawning as he put the glasses on. <br />
<br />
This was Ricky Pierrs. Currently age 16, a sophomore in high school, part of the track and field team... A thrower. Some said he was <br />
built more like a football linebacker, but Ricky preferred to keep his intellect the way it was. He was dark-haired, keeping his hair <br />
trimmed just long enough to keep his bangs, and his goatee and sideburns had been coming in nicely since 7th grade. His dark brown <br />
eyes masked his intelligence behind a warm, almost chocolatey color, but his glasses often got in the way of people noticing those <br />
eyes... At least, in his mind they did. The rest of him was rather unremarkable. He had the genetics for muscles, which was probably <br />
why he was so strong despite doing next to nothing and his belly wasn't too bad, but his genetics also gave him rather bad acne. But it <br />
was okay; he lived with it. He stood in at about five foot eight, and, while he hoped he would still grow some more, he pretty much knew <br />
he was done growing. <br />
<br />
Scratching his back as he walked from his bedside towards his dresser, Ricky silently thanked whatever gods there were that it was <br />
Saturday- that meant there was no school today, and he could do what he loved to do most of all. Roleplay on the Internet with his <br />
friends. Not his real friends. No, his real life friends were always too busy for him during the weekends. So he would sit on his laptop, <br />
talking to his friends who he shared his stories and creativity with, and, in turn, they with him. Opening his dresser and pulling out some <br />
dark blue lounge pants and a plain black shirt, which Ricky promptly threw on overtop his dark green boxers, the young man sighed <br />
contentedly and walked over to his desk. Nobody else in the house would be awake for a few hours, so he wouldn't need to take a <br />
shower until then. As Ricky flipped the lid up on his laptop, tapping the keyboard once, twice, three times while he waited for it to load, <br />
he wondered what shenanigans his roleplaying friends would have gotten into now. <br />
<br />
Two minutes later, Ricky was pulling open the website he did his roleplaying and writing and talking on up, entering his username and <br />
password in the required fields. A brief scan showed that only a few people had actually posted anywhere while he had been asleep. <br />
Oh well; this wasn't really a shock. However, a small, flashing sign alerted him to something new... A brand new private message. <br />
Briefly pondering who it was from, Ricky dragged his finger across the touch pad and clicked the blinking private message button. When <br />
he opened his inbox, he found a message from one of his female friends on this forum, a girl who went by the username of Heir of <br />
Breath (a reference to a webcomic the two of you read) and the actual name of Seo. She said it was short for her real name, which you <br />
supposed was fair. The teenage boy stroked his goatee in thought as he opened the message, briefly wondering what the Scottish girl <br />
wanted with you. <br />
<br />
What he read in the private message was unbelievable. Seo and Ricky had often entertained the idea of swapping genders, even <br />
having written stories about the subject together, but this... A chance discovery of a young, beautiful woman who went by the name of <br />
Aphrodite? The Greek goddess of Love and Beauty, the wife of Hepheastus, the Greek god of the Forge? And this news, that she <br />
claimed she could grant Seo a favor for having shown her some small amount of kindness, which could even change their genders... <br />
And she wanted to share this with him? Another blinking window appeared on his toolbar at the bottom of his screen, which brought <br />
open a video chat. Ricky wondered for a moment why Seo was mouthing words at him before realizing the sound was off. <br />
<br />
&quot;... I can't believe it, but for some reason... I do! Wait, did you read the PM, broski?&quot; Seo said, rapid-fire, as Ricky turned his sound on. <br />
The male teenager yawned, nodding his head slowly in a positive response. Immediately, Seo returned to talking. &quot;Well, the reason I <br />
told you about it is... She said that, while not necessary for what I think I'm going to ask for... It works better with two people. So, come <br />
on, Ricky! Come on, please? I know you want to know what it's like, having tits.&quot; Seo said, sticking her tongue out and squeezing her <br />
own fairly tiny breasts as she said it. <br />
<br />
Ricky ran his hand through his hair, not responding immediately. &quot;Well... Do you honestly believe this? I mean... It's kind of crazy, isn't <br />
it? Even if she is who she says she is, why would a goddess... Oh right, Geeeks valued hospitality and whatnot.&quot; He shook his head as <br />
he realized he was thinking while he spoke, and then just stared at the girl who he was talking to. Ugh. Maybe this was just a <br />
fantastical dream... And if it was, why shouldn't he ride with it? At the worst, their hopes could be dashed as the so-called goddess <br />
turned out to be a fraud. &quot;You know what, Seo? Let's do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl's face lit up, and then she stood up, walking away from her computer screen. Ricky raised an eyebrow, but said nothing, and in <br />
a minute, Seo returned, dragging a beautiful, tall, blonde woman with golden eyes behind her. &quot;Okay, so this is the guy.&quot; Seo said, <br />
pointing at the screen. Ricky waved at the woman claiming to be Aphrodite, who smiled back at him with dazzling white teeth. &quot;He's <br />
agreed to switch sexes with me. Right Ricky?&quot; When you nod, Seo just looks at the so-called Aphrodite, who nods slowly in turn. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, mortals.&quot; the woman says, and then things get weird, as all three beings begin to glow...</p>
