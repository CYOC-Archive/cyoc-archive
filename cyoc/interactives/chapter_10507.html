<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rob and the Gymnast Part 1 –<br />
<br />
Peter was reluctant to arrange for Rob to be transferred to the advanced placement classes.  But he could tell that Rob was bored to tears in most of his classes.  At this point, he had finally come to understand that Rob needed to be challenged in order to be happy.  And Rob needed to strive and progress to be better at everything that he really cared about.  Peter wanted to keep Rob with him, but at least Rob would still be in the same school and they would still share homeroom, lunch and PE.  <br />
<br />
Rob had intentionally stopped trying to conceal his body after the first week. Showering after PE on that first day had resulted in a lot of unwanted ‘wood’ popping up in the shower and on the second day, while changing clothes and showering for PE, Rob felt like somebody had sold tickets allowing people to watch him.  By his third day at school, rumors had started to circulate that the new guy in the overly baggy clothes had a body to “die for.” This was not what Rob had wanted, or at least not yet.  By Thursday, a lot of girls, and some of the guys, were looking at Rob like a piece of meat; and moving between classes had become like a gauntlet with people intentionally jostling him for the chance to grope his body.  On Friday it had become even worse; by lunch the gropers had ripped open the front of his shirt and had left the sleeve off his t-shirt, exposing Rob’s chiseled abs and muscular arm and shoulder.  <br />
<br />
“Well, now I know what it’s like to be a rock star,” Rob moaned to the group at lunch.  Dustin said, “I don’t understand it, I’m bigger and I have a lot more muscle than you, but people aren’t ripping my clothes off.”  “I think what happened with Duncan may be part of this.  Some side effect of the blocking interest in Duncan’s change caused interest in me to fill the vacuum,” said Rob.  Peter replied, “That could be it! I was mainly concerned with covering the tracks on Duncan and his confrontation. You were in the middle of it all, and with you being the only thing I didn’t erase about the incident, everyone became fixated on you.  Your “covering-up” and hiding your body may have served to feed it even more.  People have heard the rumors and they want to know the truth.”  “It sounds like you’re suggesting that I should just go around naked for a couple of days and let everyone get an eye full” said Rob.  “Well, that might be a bit extreme, but the basic idea might work,” laughed Peter.  “Yeah, the whole school would know that you‘re the number two stud at this school,” said Dustin, “After me, of course.”  “Oh so you’re going “au natural” with me so people can compare” laughed Rob. Dustin turned bright pink at the thought and everyone laughed.  “I think I understand where you’re heading, Peter.  Let them see enough in order to make up their own minds, right?” said Rob.  “Exactly! I could maybe do something with magic, but it appears that magic is what got us here, so using more magic might make things even worse” said Peter.  “Okay, I’ll start wearing stuff that’s more revealing starting Monday,” said Rob.  “The sooner they see the real you, the sooner you will be safe from all the groping,” said Peter.  And suddenly Rob found that his baggy t-shirt and cargo pants had been replaced by a skin-tight mesh tank top and equally skin-tight Lycra shorts.  “Well, this definitely doesn’t leave much to the imagination. About the only thing between this outfit and being naked is a pair of Speedos, but it’s not within dress code, is it?” said Rob. Peter replied, “I won’t let anyone think of it as being out of the ordinary; so don’t worry.”  The groping did stop almost immediately, but it took another two days of displaying himself under skin-tight Lycra for people to lose interest in Rob’s body and to start treating him like any other student.  But Rob was now at the top of the short list of the most desirable guys at school, which was something Rob really didn’t want yet, but what was done, was done.<br />
<br />
The AP classes didn’t really seem that much more advanced for Rob, but the instructors were more tolerant and some were actually pleased to have this apparent prodigy as a student.  Rob did need to be careful not to get too deeply into some things, so as not to alienate the teachers or the other students.  By now most of the school had forgotten about Rob’s first weeks. Rob had been in the AP classes a few weeks when he lost his position as ‘the new kid’ when another student transferred in to the school and the AP classes.<br />
<br />
The new student’s name was Wendy.  She was petite, with dark hair and eyes.  When she walked into his English class and took a seat in the row next to him but one desk forward, Rob felt a stirring in his pants that quickly grew into a major chubby that was impossible to hide.  For the first time in his life, Rob was in love, or at least lust.  When class ended he made a beeline for the boy’s room, in the hope that a quick jerk would tame what had made his cargo pants severely tented.  It did help but when he got to his next class, which was Chemistry, he found Wendy sitting next to him at the same lab table again! Rob found himself at full attention again.  He managed to conceal his problem by shuffling his books. Rob sat through the class with a Math book on his lap. He rebuked himself for not being able to control his body better, and he was surprised and confused by feelings that he had never felt before.  <br />
<br />
Rob wanted to get to know this girl, because none of the girls had interested him up to now, and some had all but stalked him until he had convinced them that he wasn’t interested.  This had disappointed Rob, despite having this super-stud body; he hadn’t felt the need for acting the part of a super-stud yet.  He had thought that the body, teen hormones, and availability of willing partners, would have led him into bed with someone.  But now he was very glad it hadn’t.  If he was right and she was willing, this was the girl he wanted to lose his virginity with.  Rob knew that at this point it was just lust, for he hadn’t spoken to her yet but he really wanted her to become the mother of his children.  “Mother of my children?? Where did that come from??” Rob told himself, while feeling shocked by the idea.  He needed to talk to Wendy.  <br />
<br />
Rob managed to speak to Wendy as they started to get up at the end of the class.  “So, do you have AP Math with Sullivan next period too?” Rob managed to get out with voice cracking only slightly from the stress.  Wendy replied, “Yes, it looks like we will spend the whole morning together.  I’m Wendy Price,” and she smiled.  “I know, I was the ‘new kid’ until you came today. I’m Rob Karlowski.  Can I walk you to Math class?” Rob asked.  “Well, you know the way and I don’t,” replied Wendy.  As the pair made their way to their next class, Wendy asked, “So how long have you been here? You said you were the last new kid.”  “Oh, a bit less than three months now,” Rob replied.  Peter came down the hall heading in the opposite direction and as they had a habit of doing, he and Rob gave each other high-fives as they passed.  “Well, I see you’ve made some friends since you came,” said Wendy.  “Oh, that was Peter; we’re cousins and I live with him, Ty and Dustin,” Rob replied as they walked into their next class.  <br />
<br />
After math class was over, Rob walked Wendy to the cafeteria and through the line, and finally to his regular table where he introduced Wendy to the gang and they all sat down.  PE was the next class for everyone but Dustin.  So they headed for the gym and when they got there, Wendy and the guys spilt up and headed for their locker rooms.  As they were changing into their workout gear, Peter said to Rob, “So you like her…” “I thought we had an agreement about poking around in my head,” said Rob angrily.  “I didn’t need to, you were doing the poking for me,” said Peter as he gestured to the partial chubby that was still making a tent out of Rob’s gym shorts.  Rob blushed and Peter gave him a playful punch in the stomach.  “Hey, she’s very cute and she thinks you’re sort of cute too. I did get to peek inside her head,” said Peter.  Ty had been listening to the exchange and decided it was time to put in his two-cents and he tripled the size of Rob’s member and brought it to full attention and beyond.  “Wendy will get a real kick out of that ‘peter’,” chuckles Ty as Rob’s lengthening member slapped against his abs.  “Okay, very funny, Ty! You’ve had your fun now, so put it back!” Rob said.  “I was just kidding,” said Ty while Rob’s member quickly slipped back under the waistband of his gym shorts.<br />
<br />
Rob and Wendy ended up sharing all their classes except PE.  The next day Rob and Wendy decided to eat alone so they could talk and get to know each other.  Once again, Rob walks Wendy through the line and they found a quiet table to themselves.  Wendy asks about Rob’s lunch, because she had noted that Dustin and he were eating the same thing yesterday and that Rob had the same thing for lunch today as well.  Rob explained that Dustin and he were ‘in training’ and that they worked out together.  “I can see Dustin as a bodybuilder, but you don’t seem to be the type. You’re not bulky like most guys that lift weights.  You look more like a gymnast…I thought you might have been one, because I’m a gymnast as well.”  “I would love to look like a gymnast and I think it would neat to be able to do all that stuff.  I’ve wanted to try my hand at it, but I never had the chance,” said Rob.  “You’re a bit old to try to start; you may not be able to stretch-out enough to get the flexibility you’d need.” said Wendy.  “Well, I might surprise you there! I do a lot of stretching.  Do you have a gym yet for your workouts?” asked Rob.  “Yes, I got signed up with a new coach before we even moved here,” replied Wendy.  “Great, maybe I can tag along and watch you work out and maybe we can convince them to let me give it a try,” said Rob.  “Let me check first that it will be alright and I will get back to you on that,” said Wendy.<br />
<br />
Rob met up with Peter and Ty for the first time since they got to school that morning in PE class.  Just as Rob joined Ty and Peter at their lockers, Ty started to mockingly sing, “Wendy and Rob sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G…”  “Okay, knock it off,” laughed Rob.  “So what were you two chatting about so intensely,” asked Peter.  “Well I may have a date of sorts,” said Rob.  “You’re moving in fast, my man!” said Ty laughing as he gave Rob a playful shove.  “What’s ‘a date of sorts’,” asked Peter.  Rob replied, “She’s an ‘elite’ gymnast and with her national ranking she has a good chance of making it to the Olympics.  I think I’m going to watch her workout, and maybe get the chance to give it a try myself.”  “Neat!!!” said Peter, “You think maybe I could come too?”  “I don’t know if I can, but I can ask. Why would you want to tag along with us?” asked Rob.  “Well, watching you do that gymnastic workout, I sort of became curious and I did some research and it looks like a really neat sport.  So, I would like to give it a try, too.  I can give both of us a head start, the same way I taught you how to play basketball,” Peter replied. “Well, when you did that, I thought it was a cheat but I went along with it because I knew how much you wanted me to play basketball with you.  But having tried it, I know that it’s not as easy as you might think.  You could only get the knowledge of what to do and how the other guy does it.  But you have to learn how to make your body do what your mind is telling it.  So it might be a shortcut, but it’s not a complete cheat.  That would be kind of neat…” said Rob.  “So, can I come?” asked Peter.  “We’ll see… I’ll push for it,” said Rob.  <br />
<br />
The following day, Wendy told Rob that it would be all right for him to come with her to her workout. Rob asked if Peter could come along too.  Wendy had thought Rob might want Peter to come too and she had already cleared that.  “You’ll get the chance to meet a couple of high level guys that are our ages as well,” said Wendy.  “That would be great,” said Rob, “Peter and I were hoping we could get the chance to see some of the men’s events too, and maybe give some of them a try. “  “We should be able to arrange that, but you’ll need to get release forms signed by your guardians.  I brought a couple of forms for you,” said Wendy.  Rob and Wendy agreed that they would plan to visit her gym the next day.  When Peter heard that they had been cleared for the visit he was upset that Rob had set the visit up for the next day; saying, “I could have just wished the forms up and we could have been there this afternoon!” Rob shook his head and replied, “Think about it, Peter. That would look funny.  How could we have gotten the forms signed and we be there right after school?  If we just wait until tomorrow, they won’t raise any questions. So it keeps your and Ty’s powers less apparent to the general public.”  “I guess you’re right…” Peter whispered, “But I really want to give it a try.”  “Tomorrow, Peter… Tomorrow” said Rob.<br />
<br />
The following day, Dustin dropped Peter, Rob and Wendy off at the gymnastics hall right after school.  They go in and Wendy introduces Rob and Peter to her gym’s head coach, Lucas Martin.  When Coach Martin saw that Rob and Peter both appeared to be in excellent shape and they both had good flexibility, and that especially Rob was interested in learning, he Okayed them to sit in on the class.  He sent them to the locker room to get changed.  On the way to the locker room, Peter and Rob saw a couple of teen guys near their age working out shirtless on the rings, from what they saw they were both pretty good.  Peter quietly asked Rob, “Do you want me to copy their skill set as a baseline?”  “Let’s hold off for now and get to know what we have available,” said Rob as they went into the locker room.  As Peter and Rob came out of the locker room, Coach Martin was talking to the pair of teens they had seen on the way in.   The coach motioned for Rob and Peter to join him and so they trotted across the gym to the rings where the coach and the other two teens were talking.  “Peter, Rob, this is Kurt and Alan, both of you seem to be pretty fit and flexible, so I’ve asked them to get you warmed up and then show you some basics on Floor Exercise and time permitting, Pommel Horse, so we can see how you handle it.  Take it easy on them, guys; they’re a couple of cherries.  The coach went over to a class of grade school kids that had gathered on the other side of the gym.  The four teens introduced themselves to each other.  Alan had close-cropped red hair and a build very much like Rob’s on a slightly smaller and lighter frame, but the same 5’8” or so height.  The smaller frame had the effect of accentuating his broad muscular shoulders and back, making him appears even broader than he actually was.  He had strong, thickly muscled arms and chest, and well-chiseled abs and a trim waist that was forged by his years as a gymnast.  They shook hands.  Kurt was taller than Alan.  He seemed to be a bit over 6 feet and he was nearly as tall as Peter.  Although his body was lean and tightly muscled, he was the least visibly muscular of the four teens.  Kurt gave off an attitude of arrogance and condescension for the newcomers, while Alan appeared to be more friendly and warm toward Rob and Peter.  <br />
<br />
Kurt made Peter and Rob run a couple of laps around the gym to start warming up, while he and Alan worked out what to teach the two newbies.  This served Peter and Rob’s purposes as it gave them a chance to talk.  “Well, Alan and you look like a pretty good match so it shouldn’t be that hard for you to make the adjustments” said Peter quietly to Rob, “Kurt is fair match for height but I’m a lot heavier.  I suppose I could copy both.”  “No, you don’t want to do that, believe me. I’ve done this before, and integrating one template is plenty hard, two would become a real mess.  Remember how I was tripping on my own feet right after you regressed me, and how clumsy I was at first when you down loaded ‘how you play basketball’?  I’ve done this before and you haven’t,” said Rob.  “Yeah, you were a riot to watch. One at a time it will be,” said Peter, “So when we get warmed up, I’ll copy Alan’s skill set to you and Kurt’s to me.”<br />
<br />
After three circuits of the gym, Kurt called Peter and Rob back.  Peter paired off with Kurt and Rob with Alan.  They did some stretching and body weight exercises.  Alan and Rob chatted a bit as they spotted each other and helped the other stretch.  “For a newbie you seem pretty flexible, Rob,” said Alan.  “Well I happened to come across this book that Mitch Gaylord and his brother wrote, and it has a stretching routine I followed as best I can on my own and used it as a bodyweight workout I do when I get up.  And then I weight train in the evening with Dustin and sometimes his brothers Ty and Peter, who’s my cousin.”  “So Dustin and Ty are your brothers?” said Alan.  ”No, they’re cousins, too,” said Rob, “I’ve been staying with them since my folks passed away, a few months back.”  “Oh, I’m sorry for bringing it up,” said Alan, “So, why are you getting into gymnastics now? This is when most guys have dropped out! I started when I was 8 years old and the only one who has stuck with it longer than me is Kurt.”  “Well I did take tumbling for a while back when I was like 7 years old but my family moved and things changed, and I was a very different person back then… Boy was I ever a different person back then,” chuckled Rob, “When I was about 13 years old, I wanted to get into gymnastics, but who I was and where I was couldn’t allow it to happen.  But I still wanted to try it.  And I met Wendy at school and this seemed like my last chance.  So here I am, ‘many days too late and a more than a dollar short’ to boot.”  Alan laughed, “I don’t know about that, as flexible as you are and based on what I’ve seen of your strength and your build, if you have decent coordination and balance and you work at it, then you might get pretty good at it.  When I first saw you, I figured that you had been doing this for several years already, especially with your build.  So, let’s see what you can do.”  Alan and Rob joined Peter and Kurt at the “Floor Exercise” area.  <br />
<br />
“Okay, listen up,” began Kurt, “Alan here is going to help me run you through some very simple tumbling and low-risk floor exercises. If you can pick it up pretty well, the coach may ask you to come back as regulars. Personally, I think you’re both really too old to start this, but the coach says I should let you give it a try.”  This wasn’t exactly what the coach had told Peter and Rob, but they had let it slide.  When Kurt had finished his little lecture, Peter took the “snapshot dump” of Kurt’s knowledge of gymnastics, just as he had done when he acquired his medical knowledge after he had body swapped with Keith.  That would given him a general grasp of gymnastics.  Both Peter and Kurt swayed slightly and their eyelids flickered for a moment, and then it was over.  Peter knew everything that Kurt knew about gymnastics. He repeated the process between Alan and Rob with similar outward effects.  Rob glanced over to Peter, who showed his Cheshire cat grin.  They were now both experienced gymnasts; the only problem was that their bodies had never actually done most of what they now understood how to do.<br />
<br />
 Kurt asked Alan to show Peter and Rob how to do a Forward Roll, a Backward Roll and a Cartwheel.  Then he asked Peter and Rob give it a try while Alan spotted for them.  Rob went first and got all of them nailed on his second try.  It took Peter a bit longer to get the hang of the movements, but within five minutes both Peter and Rob could do the movements as well as Alan.  Kurt, only slightly impressed by Peter and Rob’s speed at acquiring the skills, said. “Ok, let’s add a strength element to the back roll by pressing it to a handstand.”  After a slight wobble on the first try, Rob easily rolled and pressed into the handstand.  On his second try, Rob held the handstand nearly motionless for nearly 10 seconds before finishing the back roll and landing back on to his feet.  Alan started to give Rob a round of applause just before Kurt ended it with a scowl.  Again, it took Peter awhile longer to catch on. His balance in the handstand was a bit wanting and finding the right moment to push while extending his hips and legs upward was tricky for him to master.  Being several inches taller and more bulky than Kurt, Peter was having exactly the sort of problem Rob had expected Peter would have.  But the big kid finally did complete the exercise.  Kurt and Alan continued with the High Dive Roll, the Round-off, the Neckspring, the Headspring, the Handspring, the Back Flip, and the Back- and Forward Somersaults.  Peter and Rob continued working through all the drills with the same results, although, as the skills became more complex, the speed at which both Peter and Rob picked up the movements slowed a bit.  <br />
<br />
What Kurt and Alan had expected would take at least an hour possibly two, Peter and Rob had pretty much mastered in less than 45 minutes.  By this time, Kurt has become a little annoyed by the speed at which Peter and Rob had become so proficient.  Alan, on the other hand, thought it was great that he might have a couple of guys besides Kurt to hang out with at the gym.  Kurt and Alan huddled briefly and then Kurt announced that they would move on to Pommel Horse.  Again Kurt had Alan demonstrate, showing Peter and Rob the basic support positions for the front, back, straddle and straddle feint.  Then Alan showed them single leg circles.  This time Peter was the first to try the skill.  Finding the right balance for the front and back support to keep his legs from resting on the horse took some experimenting, but he quickly found it.  Getting the single leg circles was another story.  He had trouble finding the pommels after swinging his leg into a straddle position, and a couple of times he slipped off the horse altogether.  If anyone had been watching Kurt carefully when Peter fell they would have seen the faint hint of a smile flicker across Kurt’s face. Starting to get a bit tired from attempting the movements that were still “unfamiliar to his body” Peter takes a particularly heavy fall.  As he slowly gets back on to his feet, a bit winded both from the exertion and the impact, Peter says, “Okay, it’s your turn now, Rob” as he wiped his sweat of the apparatus and then his face. <br />
<br />
Rob chalks up his hands and approaches the horse. He grasps the pommels and hops up to a front support position.  As with Peter, he had trouble finding the right combination of balance and force to keep his legs from contacting the side of the horse.  Once he found the balance and maintained it for a while, Rob shifted his weight to his left arm and hand and lifted his right leg to clear the horse.  When he had himself stable, Rob took his right hand off the pommel and brought his right leg to the front of the horse and quickly replaced his right hand on the pommel. Rob grinned and after holding the straddle support for a few seconds, he and then began to rock back and forth, while shifting his weight between his right and his left arm.  After a few swings, Rob shifts his weight to his right arm and releases the pommel with his left hand as he brings his left leg to the front of the horse.  Rob then repeats the process in reverse, returning both legs to the rear of the horse.  Rob swung both legs under his right arm to the front of the horse and after returning his right hand toe the pommel he shifted his weight to it lifted his left hand and - without stopping - he brought both legs to the rear of the horse.  He continued through a second double leg circle.  After the second circle, Rob stopped in a straddle support; he then reversed the maneuver this time, stopping in a front support.  From there Rob pressed himself into a handstand and did a ninety-degree pirouette into a back somersault off the horse.<br />
<br />
While Rob was doing his performance on the pommel horse, Wendy and Coach Martin had joined Alan, Kurt and Peter while they were watching Rob, who was facing away from his onlookers.  The Coach said to no one in particular, “He’s never done this before?”  Alan replied, “That’s what he told me… He said he had read about it, watched gymnasts on TV and followed some workout he found in a book.”  “That’s amazing, talk about a natural…” said Coach Martin and finished the thought to himself, “If this kid can do this his first time out, with training he could become great.”  After Rob’s adlibbed dismount the coach, followed by the rest of the group, clapped his hands in applause for Rob as they started to walk towards him.  “You must have done that before,” Coach Martin said to Rob.  “Nope, that was my first time on a pommel horse, but I have done a lot of research reading and watching recordings,” replied Rob.  “For your first time you are both remarkable but you, son, are amazing.  I’d like for you to join the gym and our team,” said the coach looking back and forth between Rob and Peter.  Rob and Peter looked at each other and grinned.  Rob looked over to Wendy who smiling and then back to the coach and said “That would be great!”  And Peter chimed in, “Yeah we’d like that, coach.”  “Okay I want to see you here tomorrow and be ready to work…” said Coach Martin, and he left the five teens to head back for his office.  Alan slapped Rob on the back and offered Peter his hand saying, “Congratulations!  Welcome to the team.”  “Yeah, welcome on board,” said Kurt, his words not echoing the expression on his face.  Wendy shook Peter’s hand and reached up and hugged Rob.  Rob grinned; Peter made a mocking face, while Kurt just scowled.</p>
