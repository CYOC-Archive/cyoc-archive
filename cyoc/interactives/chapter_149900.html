<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The conclusion to the issues that related to Alice Decrux for Harold and Melissa came with some degree of relief for both of them and was something that was there to let both move forward with their lives. For Harold there was the joy at finding happiness again with Virginia McCoy and their coming wedding, assuming Harold could arrange a justice of the peace for that date, and Harold was confident that could be arranged. The biggest question there would then come with regard to the fact that Melissa had become a werecow shortly after the Halloween dance the previous night.<br />
<br />
The spectre of Alice Decrux&#39;s actions still hung over them, but Harold felt glad at being a weretiger with Virginia and Melissa at finding love with Trevor Tyson. Those issues remained something that both felt pleased by and were ready to move forward on other things. This had included finally getting to discuss the textbooks that Virginia had to review and settling some plans with regard to the wedding between the two weretigers. For the most part the two had agreed on staying with the wedding ceremony at the end of the coming week, but that would also mean getting Melissa some formal wear that would fit her. For even in her human form, Harold could tell that Melissa&#39;s shoulders were broader than what they would be on a normal woman of her age and height, and Harold thought he could see some added definition to her biceps as well. Not to mention other features grew after she became a were.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think we can do too much with regard to Rachel right now,&quot; Harold said to Melissa, bringing up one of the things that Melissa had found out while checking her email, than an old friend from Michigan was apparently also coming to Moon Lake. &quot;If they aren&#39;t here yet... warning them might help them be ready...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;d risk exposure, something weres generally don&#39;t want,&quot; Virginia spoke up, &quot;In that case... you&#39;ll have to wait until they get here and talk with Samantha Twist or with someone from her office.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just hope she isn&#39;t too shocked by things...&quot; Melissa said slowly and looked between her father and her future step-mother. &quot;I mean I don&#39;t think she will... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it may be best to stay focused on that,&quot; Harold commented, &quot;and in the meantime, since Virginia and I have gotten through the books she&#39;s needed reviewed, there is something we could do while waiting for this dinner date at the Tysons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shopping?&quot; Melissa turned her head with a broad grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;For some formal wear that will fit you for the wedding and other formal occasions,&quot; Harold commented, &quot;nothing to extravagant.&quot; He then paused to look to Virginia, &quot;and if you want a more expert opinion... even Virginia could come along on the trip... If she&#39;s free?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m free,&quot; Virginia spoke, &quot;but I don&#39;t want to intrude on anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t be,&quot; Harold promised, &quot;I can understand professional... but some of this may need to be things that Melissa can wear again... until she outgrows it and so on. In this... I may not be the best person to consult with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Melissa soon added, &quot;what Mrs. Tyson gave me is fine and all... but a lot of it is really only good for day to day stuff and going to school. So... some of the surprises aside... I&#39;m still excited about something of an outing and introducing Dad to the Tysons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Virginia said slowly, &quot;well... if you&#39;ll give me a few moments to get the textbooks back to my house and get my purse... I would be happy to come along.&quot;<br />
<br />
She noted the smile that both Jenkins gave and nodded in reply. She gave a small chuckle and moved to retrieve the books she&#39;d originally brought for Harold to review. Now that he had, she would have to return them to the school and ultimately the Central Office. She collected them and hustled back out as Melissa made her way to get her shoes from upstairs and Harold mouthed &quot;thank you&quot; to her on her way out. She could only chuckle as Harold opened the door for her and let her head out to head home. As she stepped onto the grass to cut across the Jenkins front lawn toward her own home she looked across the street to Alice Decrux&#39;s former home. For the moment, things were quiet and she gave a small sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you didn&#39;t get so pushy with people, none of this would have ever happened,&quot; Virginia sighed thinking of Alice Decrux, &quot;and you would have found more people openly accepting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Virginia went across the lawn and entered her own home through the front door. She set the books down on an end table in her front living room and then moved on to find her purse. Sundays were often a quiet day in which she would focus on what would be coming for the week and have things mentally planned out. Officially some of that was normally done by Friday or Saturday so that the High School Staff knew, but the fight between her and Decrux had got in the way of all that. It&#39;d mean she might have some hustling to do the next day or even in the early evening. Especially if she and Harold were to potentially find some time, after his and Melissa&#39;s dinner with the Tysons, for some &quot;fun.&quot; In this, Virginia figured that unless the Tyson&#39;s called her to extend their invitation, it would be improper to show up with Harold until she was formally Mrs. Virginia Jenkins, and for the moment, she could be confident of that coming in the near future. But that day hadn&#39;t arrived yet.<br />
<br />
After retrieving her purse, she came back out and locked her front door. Moon Lake didn&#39;t have too many issues with burglaries, but it generally did make sense to be smart about such things when there was no way she could protect her home. And a trip to Seattle fit in line with that, the drive wasn&#39;t far and wouldn&#39;t take too long, but it was just far enough that she couldn&#39;t respond to an immediate emergency. As she turned her key she noted both Harold and Melissa coming out as well. She made her way back across the grass and joined them as Harold locked the doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for an adventure?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course?&quot; Virginia answered as she glanced to Harold and watched him roll his eyes, which she took as a sign that Melissa might be pushing for more than just some formal wear. She chuckled a little and climbed into the front seat and buckled herself in next to Harold.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The ride to Seattle took about an hour, mostly due to following some low level state highways that went west. Once out of Moon Lake, Melissa could quickly see how and why Alice Decrux had went off the road the night before. There weren&#39;t to many straight lines on those roads and some of the roads had some fairly tight turns in order to adhere to the contours of the mountains. However, the fact that the drive took about an hour to get to Seattle would mean that Rachel wouldn&#39;t necessarily be &quot;too far&quot; from something fun that she was used to. If they met at school, Melissa would let her know that Seattle wasn&#39;t too far away.<br />
<br />
But for the moment, she was more focused on the purpose of the shopping trip. Seeing Rachel again would be great, but Melissa had to admit she liked the change of life that she and her father had at Moon Lake. She counted herself extremely lucky to find Trevor and even more lucky to see her dad smile again. The male weretiger that drove them into Seattle and came into one of their shopping districts was far more like the man who could tell jokes and be openly friendly, and that made her excited for her father and Virginia&#39;s wedding, even if it wasn&#39;t a formal wedding in a church. Her dad was happy again, and that was what Melissa loved.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can just feel my wallet dying,&quot; Harold said as the group slowly made their way into to one of the more trendy stores that Melissa did recognize. Though it was also a store that did do more business in more up-scale attire than places that Melissa normally would have gone to back in Michigan. It was more like what one would pick out for a fancy and very formal date than what one would wear for work, which was more Harold&#39;s forte. More comfortable with some things, Harold was actually able to remember a standing joke that Eliza had done more to pick out what he wore for their dates than he had without getting caught up on her death. In this, it wasn&#39;t that Harold forgot Eliza Jenkins, but he was able to move on with Virginia. Especially as a part him also had the sense that Eliza approved of Virginia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it won&#39;t be that bad,&quot; Melissa promised, &quot;I have a fair amount of growing to do before everything related to puberty is done... so I&#39;m fine with some simple things... like the jeans and shirts... and underwear that Mrs. Tyson gave me. I won&#39;t get into totally reworking my wardrobe in the particular manner I&#39;d prefer until I get to the point where I know I won&#39;t outgrow it. And by then, I&#39;ll have some internships line up to help people...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still looking at social work?&quot; Harold asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or anything where I could provide some means of care and comfort for people,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;talk with people and help them through rough stretches... or at least make sure that those that are handling that sort of care aren&#39;t abusing the position of power they have. And if that means driving from Moon Lake to Seattle to get to work... that&#39;s fine. Bring that sort of care and compassion to those that need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still kind and caring,&quot; Harold gave a smile as they walked in, &quot;you&#39;re mother would be proud of you... For in that... I know I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded and smiled at the compliment. For while Harold had referred to Eliza, it wasn&#39;t the reference that was overpowered by guilt and sorrow. She could actually hear pride in her father&#39;s voice, which was a good thing.  Though, she had to do her best to look a bit more &quot;normal&quot; as she made he way in. The store was still open, though with it being a Sunday and nearing lunchtime, it was likely that it wouldn&#39;t be too long before things started closing for the day. There weren&#39;t too many people wandering through the store at present, but there were a few. Most were her age, but there were a few that were a bit older.<br />
<br />
Most of those that were older were toward the back of the store where some of the more formal clothes were. The store did generally sell to more formal wear in the sense that it didn&#39;t sell shorts, tank tops, or anything that would be truly provocative. But it did have some aspects that showed that it wasn&#39;t selling for formal occasions. There were no tuxedos or ankle length skirts or dresses, and there were a few that were designed to be low cut in order to be worn with another shirt that would be worn under the dress in question. Though with it being primarily for Harold and Virginia&#39;s wedding, Melissa figured that something polite and didn&#39;t upstage Virginia would be the most appropriate. A part of her thought on some variation of &quot;the little black dress,&quot; but that might be something more to attract Trevor and wouldn&#39;t be something for a wedding. Not to mention that black didn&#39;t work for weddings, unless one was the groom.<br />
<br />
&quot;So did you two have any color scheme planned?&quot; Melissa asked to Harold and Virginia as they got to the back section where most of the dresses that were likely the most appropriate were, &quot;I don&#39;t want to clash... or upstage the bride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think we have a color scheme...&quot; Virginia said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;ll largely be with a justice of the peace,&quot; Harold added, &quot;most of the guests will probably just be people from the college or the High School...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not grandma or grandpa?&quot; Melissa wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents... and Eliza&#39;s will know that I&#39;ve moved on,&quot; Harold said slowly, &quot;but given things... and the joy that&#39;s there at finding Virginia.  I wouldn&#39;t want to put them in a situation where they have to drop everything and rush across the country at short notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Virginia&#39;s?&quot; Melissa wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents would be in much the same position as your grandparents,&quot; Virginia commented, &quot;if they&#39;re to come... we&#39;d have to push it back... and a real part of me doesn&#39;t want to. The exact circumstances in which it happened may not have been what I&#39;d predicted when I thought about what it would be like to find someone to be with... but... it happened and I&#39;m happy. My folks will understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Melissa said slowly and looked between a pair.<br />
<br />
One looked to be of a soft material dress that was largely blue and white. The blue portion fit around the short sleeves and looked almost like it was a jacket for the rest of the dress which was with the exception of the skirt part of the dress, which was a matching blue. The front also looked like it had a bit of a button down front at the color, though it didn&#39;t come down very far. The skirt portion looked like it was to fit fairly loosely and came down at least to the knees. The other was a variation of the little black dress. It had shallow V-neck and really wouldn&#39;t too more than her clavicle and while it had no formal sleeves, the shoulders flared out a bit. The skirt&#39;s length was about the same as the other one, but had one slit up the side. However, while both fit a sort of semi-formal look, one that could fit for the wedding.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do you think?&quot; Virginia asked, &quot;anything you need help on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I actually like those two designs,&quot; Melissa commented and pointed to the two she&#39;d been looking between, &quot;but... one sorta looks like a summer church look and the other is more something to wear for Trevor on a date.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our wedding is not a date,&quot; Harold commented and looked at both and nearly whistled at the price of the black dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;And most of the rest that are here... are well too flashy or the sort that I wouldn&#39;t want to spend money and then have replace later because I&#39;ve grown too big for them,&quot; Melissa finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... why not get both?&quot; Virginia offered, &quot;the white and blue one would be fine for the wedding... and while Moon Lake isn&#39;t exactly a big town... there would be enough where you and Trevor could have a nice night at the theater and the Local Diner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Melissa began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll even help pay, if need be,&quot; Virginia answered, &quot;ease things on your father who had to retool his whole wardrobe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In bland business wear…&quot; Melissa commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but that&#39;s professional standards, I have to meet the same requirements with the school,&quot; Virginia spoke, &quot;and if you&#39;re looking at social work... that&#39;s potentially working for the State Government in some ways. As a public servant in the state government, they&#39;d expect you to look professional too. Regardless of whether or not you became a were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Melissa commented and looked through the dresses that were in stock that were measured out to fit certain sizes. Based on the measurements she&#39;d gotten from Erma on her new form&#39;s dimensions both in human and were form, she had a good idea as to where she was in terms of sizes. She picked up the blue and white one and held it up to her for a moment, and noted that the skirt looked like it would come down to her knees. &quot;I&#39;ll need shoes that would go with this... nothing flashy and maybe something that could be adjustable...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we can find something... somewhere,&quot; Virginia answered as Melissa reached for the black dress and found the size the matched the blue and white one. She managed a small chuckle as Harold groaned. She glanced to him and said, &quot;and don&#39;t worry. Things will be fine. And if you behave yourself... you will have a reward tonight after the dinner with the Tysons.&quot;</p>
