<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BACKTRACKING...<br />
Although they were not expecting any visitors that Sunday, Cassie O&#39;Sullivan answered her front door and was happily surprised to see her new boyfriend Eric Anderson on her front porch, especially when he greeted her with a kiss.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m very happy to see you too Eric,&quot; she said, kissing him back.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry if that was too forward, but I just needed to see you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand. You&#39;ve been on my mind a lot too. Won&#39;t you come in?&quot; asked Cassie.<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; replied Eric, wiping his feet before entering.<br />
&quot;Cassie, who was...&quot; began her mother, before entering the living room to see Eric sitting on the couch next to her daughter. &quot;Hello. How are you doing?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;Fine, now,&quot; replied Eric with a smile, as Cassie held his hand in hers.<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t I get you two a couple of sodas. Be right back,&quot; said Anna O&#39;Sullivan, before going into the kitchen. <i>They really have it bad for each other, and I still have to thank Ben Twist for setting this up somehow.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; began Cassie, to which Eric launched into a long and detailed explanation of what happened to him after they parted company last night.<br />
&quot;Getting rubbed with raw fish was a bit odd, but the smell wasn&#39;t bad. However those blue contact lenses were quite uncomfortable,&quot; said Eric, as he was finishing his tale. Neither teenager noticed or cared that when Mrs. O&#39;Sullivan returned to the living room, she actually had <i>three</i> sodas with her, and was sitting in a nearby chair listening to their conversation.<br />
&quot;I was afraid one of them would fall out and blow the whole charade,&quot; finished Eric.<br />
&quot;So how is Julie Stovall now?&quot; wondered Cassie.<br />
&quot;Fine, as far as I know, under the circumstances,&quot; replied her boyfriend. &quot;The ruse worked enough so she calmed down and was sleeping peacefully when I left the hospital. Last I heard, another doctor was coming in to consult with Doctor Tachibana and plan things from there.&quot;<br />
&quot;And <i>mer</i> Eric?&quot; asked Cassie.<br />
&quot;Nobody&#39;s said anything to me about having to dress up again. On one hand, I&#39;ll do it again if it helps, but I&#39;m not looking forward to it,&quot; admitted Eric. &quot;Besides, I meant what I texted you last night. You are my life, love and future Cassie,&quot; he said, before giving his girlfriend more than a chaste kiss.<br />
&quot;A*hem,&quot; said her mother, reminding the two young lovers she was still in the room.<br />
&quot;Okay, time to talk about other things,&quot; realized Eric, blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
Cassie and Eric soon started discussing school and discovered that besides the Freshman lunch break, they also had History together.<br />
&quot;Then how come I never noticed you around school, let alone in class, before you inducted me into were society?&quot; the latest werewolf of Moon Lake asked his girlfriend.<br />
&quot;I honestly don&#39;t know Eric, but I&#39;m glad we&#39;re together now,&quot; was all she could say.<br />
&quot;There are some who say Moon Lake is a special place, and looks out for its citizens. There are others who will just shrug their shoulders and say &#39;That&#39;s life&#39;. Me? I just say enjoy!&quot; replied Mrs. O&#39;Sullivan, before raising her soda can in a salute to the teenagers.<br />
Though a bit embarrassed, the happy couple returned the toast when Eric&#39;s cellphone rang.<br />
&quot;Hi mom,&quot; he said, answering it. &quot;What? He did? When? Okay. You what? Hang on, I&#39;ll ask,&quot; promised Eric, removing the phone from his ear for a moment. &quot;My mom said—&quot;<br />
&quot;We heard. Werewolves have good ears, remember?&quot; asked Cassie, before turning to face her mother. &quot;Can I have dinner at the Andersons&#39; tonight?&quot;<br />
&quot;Cassie can come,&quot; Eric told his mother, seeing Anna nod in agreement, &quot;but what about Mrs. O&#39;Sullivan? Oh. I&#39;ll tell her. See you later,&quot; he said, before hanging up.<br />
&quot;It was nice of you to ask, but it sounds like your mother just wants tonight for her sons and their beaus,&quot; commented Cassie&#39;s mother, before Eric could speak. &quot;I definitely look forward to meeting her another time, but who&#39;s this Alex Ramsey?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nate&#39;s boyfriend.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, if they&#39;re as happy as you and Cassie are, then the four of you have bright futures together,&quot; said Mrs. O&#39;Sullivan. &quot;Now why don&#39;t you go grab a sweater and run on over to Eric&#39;s house now Cassie. Maybe the two of you can help his mother get dinner ready,&quot; she suggested.<br />
Cassie came back a moment later wearing a pink sweater with a white &quot;Hello Kitty&quot; icon over its left breast. She bent forward to kiss her mother on the cheek and whispered, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I took today&#39;s,&quot; referring to the werewolf birth control pill, before grabbing Eric&#39;s hand and heading for the front door.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t forget to be home before curfew. Tomorrow&#39;s a school day!&quot; shouted Mrs. O&#39;Sullivan as the kid&#39;s left.<br />
When she was alone, Anna O&#39;Sullivan pulled out her own cellphone and after the party she dialed answered, said, &quot;Hello. Ben? It&#39;s Anna O&#39;Sullivan. Can you come over for a bit? I&#39;d like to thank you for introducing Cassie to Eric Anderson,&quot; she said with a smile.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The happy couple were walking from Cassie&#39;s to Eric&#39;s house, with her doing most of the talking along the way.<br />
&quot;Depending upon the weather, if it&#39;s not too much trouble, do you think we could start walking home together after school everyday?&quot; she asked.<br />
Eric had brief thoughts of the times he shared similar walks with Julie Stovall before his father&#39;s death changed everything, but said, &quot;Sure,&quot; to Cassie.<br />
&quot;Good. By the way,&quot; she added, moving closer as if about to share a great secret only the two of them would know, &quot;my mother usually doesn&#39;t get home from work until after 7 weeknights. So as long as I have dinner ready for us by the time she walks in the house...&quot; suggested Cassie, before licking Eric&#39;s ear.<br />
&quot;As you saying what I think you&#39;re saying?&quot; asked Eric.<br />
&quot;You better believe it my dashing werewolf,&quot; replied Cassie with a smile. &quot;Maybe not <i>every</i> day, because homework does come first, but I would love to have the opportunity to make love with you in and out of our fursonas.&quot;<br />
Eric simply smiled and kissed her on the cheek as Cassie added, &quot;Also, when you come to my birthday party Saturday afternoon, be sure you can spend the night afterwards, because you&#39;re one present I want to take my time enjoying!&quot;<br />
Eric honestly didn&#39;t know what to say to that, but the penis trying to escape his pants did as his girlfriend gave him a sly smile while reaching down to cup the exterior of his pants with one hand and give it a promising caress.<br />
Eric stopped and put his arms around Cassie. &quot;Do you know how much I love you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. At least as much as I love you,&quot; replied Cassie, before they shared a kiss and resumed walking. <i>We were made for each other Eric Anderson, and I&#39;m not going to let anything stand in the way of your, mine, or our happiness ever again,</i> swore the she-wolf, as the two teenagers in love held hands during the rest of the journey.<br />

Dragon is about the only (known) were the Moon Lake of any Earth doesn&#39;t have. This episode doesn&#39;t contradict anything you&#39;ve already done, but I am uncertain at this time what to suggest about Damien&#39;s future. Maybe he could have repaired the mental damage, but the physical damage still has to be medically treated?—tmw.</p>
