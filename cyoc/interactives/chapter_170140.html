<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zack yawned, stretching as he got out if bed. The two 11 year olds had lucked out in finding this cabin, having called it home for the last couple of weeks. As Zack now entered the living room he could see Mia sitting on the floor inside a witches circle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Mia,&quot; he said. &quot;Whatcha doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trying to make contact with Rexie,&quot; Mia sighed. The witchling grunted in frustration, slamming her hand down as she now stood. &quot;Ugh I still cant find her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe Rexie is gone,&quot; Zack said as he began rifling through the fridge.<br />
<br />
&quot;No if she was gone I couldn&#39;t use my magic,&quot; she said. &quot;No whatever it is seems to be blocking my connection to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack simply nodded, he really didnt understand magic, his powers came directly from Circe. Still seeing his friend looking upset made him feel bad. Zack now approached Mia, a small smile on his face. &quot;Want a Pop tart?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia smiled, taking the Pop tart as she studied Zack closely. &quot;Hey I think you got taller,&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Zack said in astonishment. Mia nodded, placing her hand on the top of her head as she now brought it to Zack. &quot;Yeah your a little taller than me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow cool,&quot; Zack said happily. &quot;I&#39;ve never been taller than you before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weve been the same size for awhile now Zack,&quot; Mia smirked. &quot;Guess your just hitting a growth spurt.&quot; The two 11 year olds now paused, a small smile on their faces as they awkwardly looked at eachother. Both kids found it odd that they would feel like this about eachother, they had been best friends for a long time now. Why would either one of them make the other feel queasy? The sound of Yuriko&#39;s soft cries in the other bedroom now jolted the two out of their awkward silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go get Yuki,&quot; Mia said. &quot;You remember how to make a bottle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Zack nodded. &quot;Should I also get some of the baby food we got the other day?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia shrugged, she wasnt sure to be honest. Yuki was 3 monthes old now and appeared healthy enough to them. The young witchling had used her magic to give an iPad enough power to function. Not really knowing exactly how to care for a baby the two children had used it to guide them in caring for the infant. &quot;She might be old enough now,&quot; Mia stated. &quot;But we&#39;ll take it slow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack went about making the bottle and grabbing a jar of baby food. While embarrassed to be doing &#39;girl stuff&#39;s he realized that taking care of a baby meant having to share the work load. As he finished prepping the formula he was frightened as Mia now began to scream for him.<br />
<br />
Fearing Mia and Yuki were in danger, Zack began to change. The boys body quickly grew, his muscles growing as his body became covered in thick brown fur. By the time he reached the top of the stairs an 8 foot werewolf stood, his fangs bared in preparation for an attack. &quot;Mia what&#39;s wrong,&quot; he growled.<br />
<br />
Mia held one hand over her mouth, pointing with the other as her eyes bugged out. &quot;Look at Yuki, &quot; she squealed. Zack looked down at the tiny infant, dressed only in a new diaper. The tiny girl looked up at Zack before rolling over onto her belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shes rolling,&quot; Mia squealed with delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Zack asked, obviously confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh you can be such a guy sometimes,&quot; Mia grunted. &quot;It means she starting to get stronger, shes growing up. Pretty soon she&#39;ll be crawling, then walking!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Zack said, slightly embarrassed but still impressed. &quot;Cool!&quot; The werewolf now slowly lowered his head down to Yurikos level watching as the baby grunted before kicking out with her legs and bopping Zack on his nose. &quot;Ow,&quot; he whined, grinning slightly. &quot;Shes got a really good kick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia giggled, picking Yuriko up as she now carried the baby downstairs. Zack followed grabbing some orange juice as Mia fed Yuriko. As odd as it seemed both Mia and Zack felt oddly comfortable in this role of &#39;parents&#39; to the infant Yuriko.<br />
<br />
&quot;Children!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia and Zacks eyes went wide as they now ducked down in their chairs. That voice! They recognized it. &quot;Isao the fox man,&quot; Zsck whispered. &quot;How did he find us again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia said nothing, clutching Yuriko to her chest tightly. The witchling gazed fearfully at Zack as he slowly crept towards the window, pushing the curtains back to get a better look.<br />
<br />
Isao was sitting cross legged in front of the cabin. The seven tailed kitsune had a sinister smirk across as his face as he now spoke again. &quot;Mia, Zack I know you are in there,&quot; he called. &quot;You can not keep running from me. I can sense your fear, no matter where you go I shall always find you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its him Mia,&quot; Zack whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you see those things,&quot; Mia asked fearfully. &quot;What did he call them, Voids?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack peaked once more, although he couldn&#39;t see the creatures he could smell them. The smell was reminiscent of spoiled meat or compost, a kind of putrid earthy smell that always lingered in the werewolves nose. &quot;I can&#39;t see them but I smell them,&quot; he frowned. &quot;Maybe six of them surrounding the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia nodded, the two had been through this exercise before. Isao would track them down, try and capture them. Mia and Zack knew if he caught them it would be bad news. The children would have to move quickly. Gather what they could, bundle up Yuriko, and make a break for it. <br />
<br />
Mia moved as quickly as possible, gathering food and supplies as Zack anxiously watched  Isao. The kitsune was now summoning forth his flaming kitana&#39;s meaning an attack was imminent. &quot;Okay I&#39;m ready,&quot; Mia said.<br />
<br />
As Zack was about to answer the sound of glass shattering caused Mia to scream. A pair of Voids had lept through the window, their supernatural roar causing the children to cry out in pain. Zack took the moment to strike, he knew how strong these things were and that fighting them would coat them time. Grabbing one of the things by the neck he spun throwing the creature through the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zack watch out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack turned to see Isao smile, a katana blade streaking at the werewolf. Although he was able to move, the blade still cut his arm. Zack howled, grabbing the wound as blood now began to fall to the floor.<br />
<br />
Seeing Zack was in trouble, Mia muttered a spell, a blast of red energy firing out and knocking two more approaching Voids backwards. Mia now tried to attack Isao, her spell streaking towards the kitsune who used his katana to cleave the energy blast in two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zack we gotta run!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack nodded, picking up Mia and Yuriko as he crashed through the back wall of the cabin, the Voids screaming as they pursued. As the children ran Isao could only smile. They would most likely not catch the children today but their was always tomorrow. Isao simply enjoyed terrorizing wizards. Their terrified screams retribution for having his sight taken and for losing his clan.</p>
