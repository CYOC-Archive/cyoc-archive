<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hearing the three options, Paul grinned, enjoying the thought more and more about becoming something dark… something evil. It was definitely an interesting proposition, to let every bit of his humanity go and to be free… not being bound to any law the mortal realm had posed upon its’ people by the very people who lived in it. All three sounded quite interesting, but the one that stuck the most was the demon werewolf. Just the thought of choosing souls, damning them and making them part of his pack… his army… was far more interesting than the other two. However, Paul had no idea which was the correct answer and stood there for a moment as he thought. Suddenly, however, Paul’s new sense of smell caught whiff of something… or rather someone… as they drew nearer to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Hmm… I may get my first victim right now.” Paul said grinning as he felt the wolf take over more, drooling at the thought of tasting blood again and flesh for the first time.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm… if only! We both know the guy coming in… he’s like the two of us and he’s been waiting a long time for someone like you to show up.” Blake said as the door opened and the big, muscular and burly bartender stepped through the door smiling.<br />
<br />
“Ahh… yes… Paul I believe it was, correct?” The bartender asked with Paul only giving a confirming nod as well as a grin as his eyes trained on the thick piece of meat that was pushing against the restraints of his pants. The bartender grinned and chuckled, “So… looks like the pup is hungry for a bone… isn’t he?”<br />
<br />
Paul just licked his lips as he nodded, knowing he would have never done anything like this in his old life, but now… his old life was a thing of the past. In fact… what Paul knew of his old life was slowly fading out of existence being replaced by this new werewolf one… one where he knew he would become a werewolf one day… as it was in his blood. His father’s male line for as long back as could be traced all had lycanthropy in their DNA and he was next to be reborn. Everything about his old life was fading fast, but Paul didn’t seem to notice, mind or care. What his mind and memory told him was enough for him to go off of and that was the end of the story because that’s all that he knew anyway.<br />
<br />
“So Drake… can you tell that there’s something new and different about this one… hmm?” Blake asked coyly.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… I can. In fact… I knew this one was different the moment that he stepped into my bar. I am so fucking glad that I gave him the moonshine! He is going to be one hell of a werewolf!” Drake said grinning from pointed tipped ear to pointed tipped ear.<br />
<br />
“Well… you are right about that… in fact he is going to be a hellish werewolf in truth!” Blake said grinning as his demeanor started to change, taking on a more sinister and hellish look to it.<br />
<br />
“You’re serious?! You think he’s the one?!” Drake asked excitedly.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… I do. Further more, he loves the taste of blood and he’s already started to give himself to the creature that lurks within him that you awoke in his body. If he is the one I believe him to be… he will be the General in command over all of the legions of hell.” Blake said as he could feel his own massive evil bubbling up inside of him.<br />
<br />
“Well then… this is definitely going to turn out to be one interesting recruit! If he is the one you think he is… rather who you believe he is… I am sure he will even have the power to make this island grow or even better… link with the mainland and begin turning others in the city we link to!” Drake said grinning, drool hanging from the cleft of his lip as his mouth began overly salivating as Paul stared at the door… oblivious to the conversation the elder werewolves were having that involved him.<br />
<br />
Paul sniffed the air again, his eyes and ears had been trained to the door right after Drake entered the bathroom. He could smell… even feel… another coming and this person smelled delicious! “Mmmm…” Paul moaned low, licking his lips in hunger, “Seems that we have some company finally. He smells… delicious!”<br />
<br />
The two directed their attention to the door, sniffing and at first not smelling a thing, but slowly thereafter, Blake and Drake both perked up. They both grinned as they smelled another human walk into the bar, heading directly for the bathroom, smelling a bit of fear pouring off of him… not really knowing why… only that it was there. Quickly, with a massive burst forward, the man charged into the bathroom and headed directly to the urinal Paul had been standing at merely moments ago. The man didn’t even pay attention to the two there with their large, thick and dripping mushroom headed cocks out while Drake still had his tucked away. Even though it was hidden, Blake knew what was there and Paul could kinda tell from the contour and from what he could see… it was monstrous. Standing at the urinal the man threw his head back, eyes closed and moaned as the golden stream of piss arched from his cock and splashed against the white porcelain urinal as Drake slowly and quietly slinked over to the door and dead bolted it so that their fun would not be interrupted. Drake grinned as he leaned against the wall next to it as the guy’s stream slowed to a mere drip, shaking his average sized cock free of the hanging droplet of urine from the slit, which he then tucked away and zipped up. Not once did this guy even pay the slightest amount of attention to them… that was, however, until his mind was free of the grasp of the pain of his bladder feeling as though it was going to explode from having too much fluid content trapped inside. In a bit of a sudden start, the man looked at saw the wood both Blake and Paul had, dripping with need and then looked to the door where Drake had been rubbing the monster under the fabric… getting it even harder and making the contour of the cock even more pronounced.<br />
<br />
“Woah… woah… what the fuck is going on here!!!??? What the fuck have I just walked into?!” The man asked, now truly afraid and fearful of what was going to happen to him there in that bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm… I think you should have thought about that before you came in here blind to your surroundings!” Blake half-growled.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what the fuck?!” The man uttered, his voice even more raised and shrill as he saw Blake slowly shift forward a bit into his wolf form as his fingers became clawed, his ears growing more wolf-like and his eyes taking on a golden amber hue.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm… seems like the human is scared of us big bad wolves… eh boys?!” Drake said as the two grinned menacingly.<br />
<br />
“Seems like it and what Paul said about him… he was right! This man does smell delicious!” Blake said sinisterly, the end of the last word sounding like the serpentine hiss of a snake.<br />
<br />
The human’s eyes darted around, noticing only a few things, which was: first the big, thick cocks sticking out and seemingly dripping with pre; the second was the three had slowly started closing in on him as he stepped back without ever even realizing it; the third was that he was being cornered and the fourth… something about the situation told the man that he was going to be dinner… maybe in more than one way.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what the fuck do you want from me?!” The man practically screamed.<br />
<br />
“Well… that’s up to my good friend Paul here. See… the thing is… we only just turned him a little while ago through our magic moonshine and we have yet to see what he is. I mean… we both know he’s a werewolf… like us, but there is more to him than just that finally after all of these years searching!” Blake moaned sinisterly.<br />
<br />
“H-how am I a-a pa-part of that?!” He asked, stammering as the fear began to paralyze him, preventing him from forming a complete sentence easily.<br />
<br />
“Simple…” Drake said with a contented sigh as he walked forward with purpose, grabbing the man by his shoulders and holding him firmly, waiting for Blake to hold the human ready so that he could do the honors… he was the Alpha of their pack after all. “You are our dear initiate’s dinner!”<br />
<br />
The man’s eyes opened wide, fear and pure terror was being pumped into his veins, increasing everything about his system to do what it could to fight in self-preservation… regardless of how fleeting it was. Blake grinned maniacally as he took the place of his Alpha, holding the man as he did, but using more of the brute strength Blake had unlocked since the moment Paul’s true form began to manifest. Drake, meanwhile, swiftly walked in front of the man whom Paul had been salivating over. His even more keen sense of smell, even though he was still mostly human and having never transformed, was far more potent and aware of the world around him. Paul couldn’t help but to drool as the man’s body pumped more and more adrenaline and fear into his veins, permeating his skin and wafting into the air as pheromones like some divine cologne.<br />
<br />
“Fuck!” Paul growled, ready to lunge at the man and tear into him. Paul wanted flesh… he craved both it and blood for some unknown reason making it harder and harder to hold himself back, though he did as somehow he knew that the kill was not his to make… sort of.<br />
<br />
Drake grinned as he watched Paul, the pup, restrain himself even though it was obviously incredibly difficult as the Alpha visually observed. Grinning and even chuckling to himself, feeling a new dark presence awakening within him as well… now that he had been in Paul’s presence in his newly awakened state. “It’s good to see you know your place already pup! I am the Alpha… it is my essence that made you and that is how you know me to be the one in control. As such… it is only my place to make the kill to bring you forth. Typically… it’s a deer or some other game on the island, but you my pup are a special case! It is clear, both to Blake and myself, that you crave the flesh of humans. Only I can be the one to kill him, for you, for now as are the rules here on Pleasure Island. Being that I am the leader of the werewolves on this island, it is my duty and responsibility to dispose of one who I have deemed as a threat to not only my kind, but to the rest of the people on the island. If you killed him, regardless of the reason, you would face some severe punishment and we don’t want that… now do we?” Drake asked as his grin grew more and more sinister by the second being in Paul’s growing demonic presence as his body shifted in height and his muscles began bulking, making his already muscular frame even more massive.<br />
<br />
Paul shook his head no, licking his lips as saliva had leaked all over his lips and mouth, causing a bit of a moist mess. Both Blake and Drake grinned. “That’s a good pup and for your reward… feed!” He screamed.<br />
<br />
Knowing that this was his last chance, the unnamed man screamed out as loud as he could. “I have friends here. They will know something has happened if I don’t come back soon and -” Suddenly, Drake’s fingers grew into menacingly sharp claws, piercing through the man’s athletic chest, grasping at the ribcage beneath and wrenched it open. The man letting out a blood curdling scream of agony that ended with the moist and bubbling sound of him choking on his own blood as he coughed it up while it poured from his gaping mouth. The two grinned knowing that the Alpha had pierced into the lungs of the man while going for the target. Paul only licked his lips, seeing the still beating heart pumping away in the unknown man’s chest, pushing the life giving blood through his dying body. The beat strong like the steady roar of thunder on a stormy evening. Paul’s eyes widened as he stared at the pulsing muscle; the saliva forming in full force as he licked his lips in hunger, wanting this meal now more than ever since his wolf began to awaken.<br />
<br />
“Yes!” Drake growled and moaned, “Yes… that’s it Paul! Give in and feed! Your food awaits you. Your Alpha permits you to feast as you desire!”<br />
<br />
Hearing the words of release, Paul lunged forward as the wolf in him came out just enough to feast as he was permitted. His fingers formed sharp, menacing and dangerous claws that were still no match for his Alpha’s… at least for that moment. His teeth grew into sharp and deadly fangs to allow him to rip apart even the strongest hides and meat known as his eyes shone golden amber for the moment. Lunging in, mouth open, fangs bared… Paul clenched his fangs around the still pumping muscle as the once ivory fangs sank into the heart as the blood gushed into his awaiting maw. Paul’s eyes flashed open, even wider than before, as the color of them shifted rapidly to the crimson glowing hue his true form possessed. He could feel his heart beat harder, faster and even stronger as if it were going to rip itself from his own chest. Paul moaned as the crimson fluid flowed into his gullet; the feeling of another being’s life pouring into his own was invigorating and awakening more than his own had previously. Hungry, ravenous and completely vicious, Paul clamped further and tugged at the living tissue, wrenching his head from side to side, feeling the thick cartilage of the main artery atop the heart tear and give way. Another tug, more wrenching from side to side and it tore completely free with it stuck on his fangs, fluttering as the electrical current that kept it beating faded. Paul grinned and groaned with the mighty muscle in his mouth, chomping away and making short work of the thing, swallowing it as he could… bit by bit until the whole thing was consumed within moments of the ordeal starting. Blake and Drake stood there, watching the whole thing as the wolf in Paul was making itself known. Just as Blake thought and Drake was now seeing for the first time… they both saw a Demonic Werewolf General being born as his body swelled to massive proportions of muscle… making even the Alpha a bit fearful… even though Paul was no where near even being close to his full form. Neither of them knew that this was just the beginning and Paul would be a force that none could reckon with… though Drake would make his claim to being the Alpha of the Demonic Werewolves. What Drake didn’t know, however, was that Blake had been planning to overthrow the weak Alpha Drake truly was the moment the opportunity would arise!</p>
