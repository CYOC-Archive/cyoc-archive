<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ishani had a devilish look in her brown eyes as she stowed the pack of pills she bought in her purse. Exactly six months ago she had married her highschool boyfriend Thomas after six years of dating, believing that he had loved her just as much as she loved him. That empty illusion had been shattered however when her friend had sent her pictures of him making out with another woman at a nearby bar while she was out buying groceries for a romantic dinner. She had cried her eyes out in the car, leaving faint tear stains on the brown skin of her face, but her sadness had quickly been replaced with righteous fury and she began plotting revenge. As she drove home she saw the uproar about the transformation pills, with many new mutants posting pictures of their new bodies. Thus she decided that the perfect vengeance was to slip one of these pills to Thomas and hopefully give the cheating bastard a more fitting body.<br />
<br />
As soon as she got home she went right to work getting dinner ready, ensuring everything was in place when Thomas got back from his &quot;work emergency. &quot; She was putting the finishing touches on the meal when she heard the sound of Thomas&#39;s car pulling into the driveway. She took one of the pills out of the package before sliding it back in her purse. The other pill she crushed on her hand and mixed into the glass of wine next to her husband&#39;s seat. She made sure to wash any dust off her hands before rushing over to the door to greet him.<br />
&quot;Welcome home dear!&quot; She did her best to not let any venom slip into her voice as her husband returned from his affair. She had put on a red, sleeveless dress and had let her black hair hang loose down to her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Honey, what are you all dressed up for?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you forgot, it&#39;s our six month anniversary today. I have some steak and wine ready, no need for you to change.&quot;<br />
Soon they were seated on opposite ends of their dinner table, quietly eating. Ishani kept glancing up at her wife every time she took a sip of wine, wondering when the transformation would begin. Since Thomas, now Tabitha, hadn&#39;t been aware that she was ingesting the pills however reality had altered to make it so that she had always been a curvy, hung angel hermaphrodite. Her ass-length hair, as well as the feathers of the majestic wings on her back, were now literally golden blonde. Her pale skin now faintly glowed, as did her deep blue irises. She had a perfect hourglass figure, her thick thighs parted to make room for the ten-inch monster between them as well as her apple sized nuts.<br />
<br />
Ishani was frustrated when the meal ended and her wife was no different at all. She thought that perhaps the fact that Tabitha was a literal (but definitely not figurative) angel that maybe the pills simply wouldn&#39;t work on her. Honestly however, she felt a bit relieved that it hadn’t worked. Honestly drugging her was such a drastic action, something that she might have gone to jail for potentially! Now that she had calmed down and thought it over during dinner she realized that it would be better to try to talk things over instead of taking petty revenge.<br />
<br />
“Dear,” There was a pregnant pause before Ishani took a deep breath and continued, “Naomi saw you at the bar today.” Tabitha’s eyes went wide as the implications of her wife’s statement sunk in.<br />
<br />
“Well…” “I mean…” The angel sighed, tears welling in her eyes. “I’M SO SORRY HONEY! I didn’t want to hurt you but my mutant libido is just so much higher than yours and it’s been slowly driving me crazy these past few years that when she started flirting with me I just couldn’t help myself.”<br />
<br />
“Why didn’t you tell me? I’m sure we could have worked something out.”<br />
<br />
“We already have sex twice a day, I thought you might start feeling inadequate if I said that wasn&#39;t enough.”<br />
<br />
“Well. if it’s just the matter of me not being able to keep up with you sexually then I think I have a solution.” Ishani walked over to her purse and pulled out the second pill.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?”<br />
<br />
“I saw a shop selling them on the way home, it’s a pill that can turn people into mutants. The effects are supposedly completely random but I know they work because people were taking them right inside the store.” She decided to omit the fact that she had tried to give one to her wife, figuring that it would only complicate matters right now.<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to do something so drastic! I’m sure we can figure this out!”<br />
<br />
“If this is what it takes to keep you happy, then I do it gladly.” Ishani swallowed the pill before Tabitha could try to talk her out of it.<br />
<br />
The effects hit her instantly. She grabbed the edge of the table to keep herself steady as her legs began to fuse into a green-scaled snake tail from the mid-thigh down. The new limb sprawled out across the floor as it grew to a tremendous thirty foot length. Above where her tail began patches of scales formed to frame her hips, butt, and breasts, all of which grew to nearly triple their previous size. Two new pairs of arms separated from her original pair, one in front and one behind. Below her watermelon tits another set of nipples formed, themselves pushing out into two equally sized orbs, then all four of her nipples split into a pair of thick lips for a massive mouth. Finally, two more heads grew beside hers. Each of these heads had long, pointed ears, sharp fangs and forked tongues; features that her original face quickly gained as well.<br />
<br />
The transformation had happened so fast that neither woman had been able to react. In less than ten seconds Ishani had gone from a petite cutie to a curvy, multi-endowed naga. <br />
<br />
“Wow Honey.” The angel now stood up, revealing the massive bulge in her pants that had been hidden beneath the table. “You look so goddamn sexy.”<br />
<br />
“I feel sssexy as well dear,” “Ssso many new sssensations.” “Ssso much more, Me.” Each sentence was spoken from a different mouth, her three heads and four breasts all proving themselves equally capable of speech as she began experimenting with her new body. Eventually however she realized that there was only one part of her transformation that truly mattered. “Let’s see how well I keep up with you now…”<br />
Tabitha was suddenly grabbed around the chest by her wife’s tail, the naga yanking her over so that all six arms could strip her out of her work attire. The couple were quickly tangled together, intent on rekindling their love well into the night.</p>
