<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucy and Zoe set their bags down, for Whitney and Grace to pick up after them and then moved to squeeze through the open window in Jeff&#39;s room. They found to their great surprise that despite the vertical from from the the window and what both knew about physics, the slime on their tails was strong enough to actually help them hold onto the paneling on the side of the house. Lucy also noted the trail that went up the side of the house underneath the north window the master bedroom and into it, where Megan and Jenny were trying to get at their brother. It was a surprise and the assault by the Slug Women outside the Chapman family was irritating, and Zoe could even feel rage coming off of Lucy, but the fact that they could cling to the building was good news and at least an opening to saving Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! Sisters to the rescue, let&#39;s go!&quot; Zoe announced to Lucy as the two of them gripped the side of the home with the slime from their tails and then began to move toward the master bedroom window.<br />
<br />
Lucy nodded and they made their way over quickly, and they found that Megan and Jenny were fully lost in what they were doing to note that the rest of the Chapman family had returned. Jeff was nowhere to be seen in the room, but the door to their mother&#39;s closet was shut and Megan and Jenny were facing it with their long penises erect from the slit at their waist that housed and hid all a Slug Woman&#39;s reproductive organs, reminding both Lucy and Zoe that Slug Women were all hermaphrodites, as all mundane Slugs were. Only Slug Men had a single gender and they were very rare. Megan and Jenny were also furiously pumping their erect shafts with their hands and giving a heavy and teasing moan toward the closed door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Jeff,&quot; Megan teased as she came with thick white ropes of cum spraying from her penis onto the door, &quot;you know you can&#39;t resist us!&quot;<br />
<br />
This enraged Lucy, though when Jenny came soon after, she could also feel her own lust starting to build. She didn&#39;t like either of these Slug Women for what they&#39;d forced on the Chapman family, but she couldn&#39;t hide what she&#39;d become and the scent of arousal and cum from Megan and Jenny was enough to arouse her, and as she slid in through the open north window, Lucy&#39;s own penis began to push  out from top of the slit where her waist met her tail. She gave one glance to Zoe and noted that her sister had the same reaction. Lucy only clinched her fists and glared at the two intruding Slug Women, who still hadn&#39;t seemed to notice the arrival of the rest of the Chapman family.<br />
<br />
&quot;You dirty slut!&quot; Lucy growled at Megan, &quot;coming after our brother like that... and messing up my mother&#39;s room and the rest of the house is even worse!&quot;<br />
<br />
This finally got Megan and Jenny to turn to see Lucy and Zoe approaching. Both immediately smiled when they noted the fully erect penises that Lucy and Zoe presently had and with the slit opening to reveal the vagina&#39;s underneath the &quot;male&quot; organ that Slug Women had. Lucy&#39;s was bigger than Zoe&#39;s, but Megan figured that had more to do with age than anything else and let a smile come to her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it isn&#39;t a mess, it&#39;s how we are,&quot; Megan smiled, &quot;we&#39;re highly sexual creatures. We love it... want it... and need it. It&#39;s true for us, and it&#39;s also true for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could join us and we&#39;d relieve each other&#39;s tension,&quot; Jenny added, &quot;you know you want it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What we&#39;d want to be with is with someone that actually loves us as people and isn&#39;t simply wanting us as part of a human wizard&#39;s diabolical plan!&quot; Zoe added to Lucy&#39;s angry nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t love us, you don&#39;t love our brother!&quot; Lucy added, &quot;all you&#39;re about is serving a human wizard with his own twisted plans!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was in that rush that Lucy then collided with Megan. She braced her arms and put all her momentum into sliding forward, and that was enough to push Megan back a little. Zoe did the same with Jenny, and while Zoe was more athletic than Lucy or Jenny, and thus had some more success at pushing Jenny back, given the angle that Lucy and Zoe were coming from, it was more that they were pushing Megan and Jenny toward the bathroom rather than the south window. To make matters worse, Megan and Jenny responded more in a way to try and catch the two older Chapman sisters to try and entice them into sex, which would be hard to avoid given that all four Slug Women had erect penises standing out before them. Lucy even shivered a bit as her penis slapped against Megan&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;The love will be there as we all form a hive,&quot; Megan as she tried to wrestle herself into a position to get Lucy&#39;s penis into her and then snake her penis into Lucy, &quot;we&#39;ll be together, lay eggs together, and everything will grow from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not love,&quot; Whitney spoke as she and Grace came into the room through the north window, &quot;that&#39;s more like Stockholm Syndrome.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy and Zoe both turned one eye stalk to note that Whitney and Grace had made it in, though they also had to set the bags they&#39;d collected along the west wall of the bedroom. The plastic bags crackled a bit and that alerted Megan and Jenny even more, but didn&#39;t stop the attempted wrestling matches. Both Lucy and Zoe managed to keep Megan and Jenny from initiating any sort of sex between them, but the aroused scent was still there and was still affecting them. Zoe could even see Whitney and Grace&#39;s penises also becoming erect as well. It served as a reminder of what the Chapman family women had all become. Megan and Jenny caught on that and simply moved to try and play to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on and join us,&quot; Jenny called Grace and Whitney as they moved get to them, &quot;all of us together would allow for plenty of time for pleasure... and then we&#39;d get our full hive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace moved around the get to one side of Megan and began to also pushing against Megan&#39;s right shoulder and forcing Megan into a direction that now went toward the window. Whitney did the same with Jenny, and had a bit of an advantage in that Zoe was able to push Jenny a lot easier. It was only at this time that Megan and Jenny began to recognize that despite their arousal, the four transformed Chapman women weren&#39;t going to just join them. But by this point, Zoe and Whitney had gotten Jenny to the window and began pushing her out the window. There was a bit of a cry of surprise as the push ultimately didn&#39;t give Jenny the opportunity to grip the side of the house, and that was soon followed as they then came to help Grace and Lucy push Megan out as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, we&#39;d all be together!&quot; Megan protested as Zoe lifted up Megan&#39;s tail and aligned it with the open window, with the frame dripping with slime from when Megan and Jenny came in through the windows.<br />
<br />
&quot;We wouldn&#39;t be free,&quot; Lucy snarled back with her eyes narrowed as she pushed forward, now with Grace pushing along side her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d also be serving someone who may have had a role in my husband&#39;s death,&quot; Whitney said sternly, thinking over the interaction with  Edward Cupple, &quot;and we may accept being Slug Women... but we do not wish to simply serve that man. And unless you and your friend want to talk in a civilized manner about how to break whatever control he has over you... I&#39;d ask that you get out of my bedroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Lucy and Grace finished pushing Megan out. Unlike Jenny, Megan was able to get a grip on the side of the house with her tail and thus didn&#39;t fall as Jenny had. However, Zoe could see that Jenny was already recovering and showing no sign of injury. Technically that got Megan and Jenny out of the house, but given the fact that Edward Cupple had been able to teleport in and out of the house, none of them was fully sure that he wouldn&#39;t continue to teleport Megan and Jenny into the home, and so long as Jeff was still human, the rest of the Chapman family couldn&#39;t get around the rest of the home without leaving Jeff vulnerable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grace, go shut the other window,&quot; Lucy instructed, &quot;we don&#39;t want them sneaking back in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Grace nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ungh,&quot; Zoe gave a groan, &quot;what a mess... and got us all horny besides.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And all to get at Jeff,&quot; Lucy sighed and looked back to the door to the closet which hadn&#39;t opened, &quot;but at least we saved him from them.&quot;</p>
