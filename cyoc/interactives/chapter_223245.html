<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cecil couldn&#39;t deny the fact that his brother turning into a goblin was, to him, very fascinating. It was decidedly something that he didn&#39;t expect to happen when he woke up that morning! He couldn&#39;t stop throwing furtive glances at Adam&#39;s transformed body... He felt a morbid curiosity about his brother&#39;s new species!<br />
<br />
Because yes, Cecil was the kind of nerd that liked to read lore books from RPGs. He needed to know every minuscule detail about those fantasy worlds he loved so much. Even the more trivial things.<br />
<br />
For example, what kind of roles did goblins have in this world&#39;s society? Were goblins just random mobs that people fought, or were they more civilized and friendly? Did goblins have their own cities or settlements? Did they get along well with other races from the horde? What did the armpit of a goblin smell like? Well, this time he would find out the answers himself and not by just reading a cheap paperback!<br />
<br />
&quot;Cecil... What are you doing?&quot; Adam asked when he noticed Cecil putting his nose near his armpit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing. Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow, Adam&#39;s armpit was stinky even though he had put on his sage and cedarwood deodorant before heading out that day! Must be a goblin&#39;s natural body essence at work!<br />
<br />
On the other hand the goblin brother felt ashamed of his green skin. He wished he could cover it as much as possible but he only had his ridiculous white briefs. Human underwear on a goblin seemed off. Anachronistic. He wanted a miniature suit of armor like Jarg had been wearing. Or at the very least a shirt.<br />
<br />
As Adam wondered what going clothes shopping as a caricaturesque goblin was like, he realized Cecil had stopped following him and instead was just shaking in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, bro. I feel weird. I think I&#39;m changing too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as Adam had been fearing, Cecil was about to undergo a transformation as well. Adam was terrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least I hope I become a cool-looking goblin like you, bro.&quot; Cecil said.<br />
<br />
Adam wouldn&#39;t have it. &quot;Don&#39;t admit defeat just yet, maybe there&#39;s something we can do-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAHHH!!! I can feel it within me! The change...!&quot; The younger brother said, perhaps a little bit too threatrally. He grasped at his chest with his hand and posed. &quot;The loss of my humanity and my rebirth as a creature of fantasy...!&quot;<br />
<br />
It would have been quite the dramatic performance if the first body part of his to change into a &quot;creature of fantasy&quot; didn&#39;t turn out to be his huge fat butt.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s right, Cecil&#39;s butt had always been too big for its own good, but suddenly and without warning his cheeks ballooned out into two humongous barrel-sized mounds of round fatty meat!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh! My undies!&quot; Cecil cried out in shame. His poor waistband had been torn apart by his gigantic behind. &quot;D-don&#39;t look!&quot; He tried his best to cover up but there was no way to lift up his pants past his oversized glutes.<br />
<br />
Adam didn&#39;t want to look, but the sight was so catastrophic it was impossible not to look at his brother&#39;s giant ass. Not only was it getting much bigger, it was also becoming much more hairy, the male hair spreading out rapidly like weeds around his now completely exposed pulsating asshole.<br />
<br />
It was as if the transformation magic reshaping his brother had taken great interest in his brother&#39;s obscenely large butt, and decided to focus all of its attention on its proper growth, nurturing it into Cecil&#39;s main feature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is my butt becoming so big?!&quot; Cecil was so worried about his buttocks that he hadn&#39;t noticed his nose and ears getting pointer and large like Adam&#39;s. His head was becoming goblin-like just like Adam except his skin didn&#39;t become green and leathery but reddish pink and blubbery and soft to the touch instead.<br />
<br />
The younger brother was becoming much shorter in stature, and Adam couldn&#39;t help but feel a little satisfaction with himself when he saw his little bro finally being shorter than him... But Cecil&#39;s body fat, if anything, was becoming much more exaggerated.<br />
<br />
&quot;(I&#39;d say he&#39;s also becoming a goblin, but his proportions are very different to mine...)&quot; Adam thought. &quot;(When I transformed I felt my torso becoming smaller with my extremities and my, uh... cock... becoming larger. Cecil, however, has a much wider belly and moobs not to mention the colossal size of his ass...)&quot;<br />
<br />
And colossal it was! It was very difficult for Cecil to walk with that weight behind him. His red goblin legs were so small and stubby that he was practically dragging his buttocks on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeeek!&quot; Cecil suddenly grasped his crotch and covered what he could with his ragged shirt. Adam correctly guessed this meant Cecil&#39;s penis had also changed, but not in a favorable way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?! Why did the spell increase my butt size so much but decrease the size of my...!&quot; Cecil&#39;s goblin eyes were watery, tears dripping down his chubby face and falling down his neckbeard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cecil? Are you alright? I think you&#39;ve finished transforming. You&#39;re a goblin like me, just like you wanted!&quot; Adam said, trying to show him the bright side of the situation.<br />
<br />
The red fat goblin covered his crotch with what little remained of his t-shirt (a limited edition imported from Japan based on an anime Cecil liked) and shook his round fat head. &quot;No! I look terrible, don&#39;t look at me!&quot; He whimpered nervously, his hairy asshole gaping with every deep breath he took. Then, Cecil took off running, or at least waddled as fast as his heavy butt let him, and hid behind some rocks.<br />
<br />
The rocks did a very poor job at hiding his obese figure, his two red buttcheeks looking like two extra rocks among them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna go home, I wanna go home, I wanna go home...&quot; The red butt chanted over and over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, geez... Not again...&quot; Adam sighed. He hadn&#39;t seen his younger brother this distressed since that time they celebrated Cecil&#39;s birthday party at the local bar. Although when Cecil went to the bar his hairy asshole wasn&#39;t out in the open like this. Still, he should leave him be for a few minutes until he cools down from his shock. It wasn&#39;t a good idea to force him too much when he was like this.<br />
<br />
Adam looked down at his green body. The huge bulge on his white briefs was very obscene, but his butt seemed average, at least for a goblin. Cecil was the complete opposite and his skin was tinted red instead. Why was there such a discrepancy between the body of each brother? He recalled the goblins from a fantasy series of novels he once read, but he remembered every goblin looking practically the exact same. Maybe Adam and Cecil were the same species but from a different race or some sort of variant...?<br />
<br />
Just then Adam&#39;s green goblin ears perked up. He could hear footsteps from deep inside the mine approaching! He took a quick glance at the pile of rocks to check that a certain pair of red buttcheeks were still there and decided his course of action.</p>
