<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile as Josh's transformation into a werewolf was ongoing, Jesse had been looking around for the brunette <br />
and without consideration or restraint snuffled his broad nose over stranger's heads, stopping cheerful <br />
conversations by bumping someone into a table and in general completely at loss where she had went. He could <br />
smell her just fine, but the thing was that he didn't know how to differentiate the smaller nuances and the <br />
strength of it. To his brain it all smelled perfectly clear (to the point of almost overloading him) but he <br />
couldn't really create a [i]trail[/i] to follow from it. He knew where 'A' was, but 'B' was everywhere. With <br />
bloodhounds you can find basically anything, but for Jesse it was all a very colourful mixing bowl. The worst <br />
thing was that he probably had the best shot at finding someone in this crowded bar with his new height, but <br />
[i]still[/i] he couldn't see her face. There were however other women glancing at him with a smile, but after <br />
the encounter with the nymph he couldn't help but feel a bit repulsed. How many nymphs were there in the crowd <br />
even? As the minutes passed his sniffing became less enthusiastic and slumped down on a free chair with his <br />
back facing toward the alcove without really looking. Quietly he heard someone slide into place behind him, <br />
settling in the back.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Jesse turned his head around, creasing his broad furred neck and glanced backwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're looking for someone?&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at a guy leaned back into the shade. He wore a stylish cap, had a bit of stubble, a scarf that <br />
defied the humid temperatures and clad mostly in dark. That alone made him a stuck-up goof in Jesse's eyes, <br />
considering that this place had palmtrees and swimming pools. Not really interested in whatever he had to say, <br />
he turned back again and scanned the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really any of your business, but, yes.&quot; He said with a hint of a growl.<br />
<br />
The man behind him quickly snagged the handbag he was supposed to give to the brunette and held it up at eye-<br />
height.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! What the fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, so you're returning sis' handbag? What a gentleman. Gentlebear even.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse furrowed his brow and held his breath, his muzzle creased in a bestial snarl with fangs showing but <br />
slowly the muscles relaxed as realization settled in. He carefully sniffed once and could sense that they had <br />
something alike to them, although it was really... really hard for him to distinguish. He would have missed it <br />
completely unless he hadn't known the answer precedently. This was clearly his best lead, and from the look of <br />
things they hadn't come off to a great start. He tried to contain his displeasure but his new facial muscles <br />
seemed to tense without his control, showing off his fangs slightly as he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. You're her brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man craned forward into the circle of light cast on the table where he could see him clearly. He had a <br />
checkered textile flatcap and a decorative scarf around his neck. He wore a leather necklace with something <br />
black and polished he couldn't distinguish in the dim light. The man smiled broadly, his face covered with <br />
dark and dense stubble and looked to be around thirty or so, crow's feet around his eyes and small creases <br />
that reinforced the heartfelt smile that creeped Jesse out a little. He didn't seem to be intimidated by Jesse <br />
in the least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; the man said with a little gleeful bounce of his head.<br />
<br />
He held the same smile and stare for a moment, until Jesse had to break it. Jesse was getting the sneaking <br />
feeling that the man clearly knew he had the upper hand. Jesse idly scratched his throat in discomfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;You, uh, mind telling me where she is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know where she is but I have a request for you before I can tell you that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really? Is it the usual &quot;I'm her older brother&quot; kind of deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that too, but, you see this is my second stay at Pleasure Island, and as we both know; the <br />
transformation doesn't last outside this place. And I have overheard your conversation with that bartender, <br />
Frank was it? And the friendly little deal he offered to you guys,&quot; he looked away quickly and snorted. &quot;I <br />
want in on that deal,&quot; the man said and winked. &quot;And in exchange I'll tell you where sis' is, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse raised a brow. This guy was clearly just faking it and wanted in.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thank you&quot;, Jesse said and pulled off a dangerous swipe with his menacing claws towards the handbag, the <br />
man still rock solid as it was snatched off the table with the claws barely missing his arm. If he had <br />
overheard his conversation with the bartender it was quite obvious that he had also noticed that Jesse was <br />
looking for that brunette, and faking relationship to a person he had barely seen isn't that hard to do.<br />
<br />
The man however - still smiling - quickly flipped two fingers holding a photo with the brunette and him on it, <br />
in a friendly hug with an older couple standing beside them which he assumed was their parents. She looked <br />
just as gorgeous on the photo as the brief glance had shown him. When he had grabbed the bag he must have <br />
pulled out the photo. The man reached out a hand towards Jesse, with a triumphant smile to accompany it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom. No hard feelings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;[i]Jesse[/i].&quot; He said with contempt and shaked Tom's hand hard. Tom winced a little with pain and shook his <br />
limp hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot;, Tom flicked his sleeve and produced a wristwatch, &quot;The time is forty-one past midnight, you reckon we <br />
should try and meet up with the bartender now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse looked defeated and drooped his eyelids to a lazy stare. He could have just ignored him and given up on <br />
the girl, but he was too stubborn for that. He rose out of the chair, the colourful lights dancing across his <br />
back and shining through at the rim of his fur, the smoke in the room casting rays around his massive bear <br />
body. Tom looked up and tried to conceal his awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll go, but first we gotta get Josh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once Tom shuffled out of the small alcove Jesse quickly snatched that handbag back. &quot;Let me carry that for <br />
you.&quot; <br />
He didn't want Tom to take that honour from him.<br />
<br />
Jesse couldn't help but wonder how Josh would look now as he walked with Tom trailing behind him through the <br />
crowd. And if Dianne was still sticking to him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

[[[I know the previous chapters before I started writing my own storyline was basically a gay story with <br />
donkeys (sorry but; ugh), I'm going along with the idea that this is basically our two straight guys Jesse and <br />
Josh who entered a bar at the evening at the mysterious Pleasure Island/Hedonia and I will take the story from <br />
there.]]]</p>
