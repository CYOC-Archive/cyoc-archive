<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was alone with Thomas at the pool, as the two swam and Thomas occasionally fed from Mark for several hours. It was dark when Mark was unable to push on, and just swam over to the shallow end and sat down on his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m done. Let&#39;s eat and what is taking Scott and Cal so long?&quot; asked Mark.<br />
<br />
Thomas stood up, her skin shining in the soft pool night lighting, and asked, &quot;Will you marry us? I&#39;ve talked to Scott and Cal, and you know how Scott feels about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark looked up at Thomas&#39;s face and tilted his head, &quot;If I say yes, can we eat?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas was a bit annoyed and replied, &quot;I&#39;m serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark sighed and asked, &quot;Three times you will ask me, that is your custom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas smiled, &quot;Yes, and I just asked the first time on behalf of all three of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark motioned for Thomas to join him, standing face to face on her knees. Once Thomas&#39;s face was in front of Mark&#39;s face, he smiled, then kissed Thomas passionately for several minutes. Mark slowly released Thomas as the two resumed sitting on their knees in the shallow end of the pool, and Mark said plainly, &quot;Yes, to your first time asking me to marry into this motley crew.&quot; Mark then stood and stepped out of the pool, then turned back to Thomas, who was still processing Mark&#39;s reply, &quot;Now can we eat?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas nodded quickly, &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll be right in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was getting dressed in the bedroom when Thomas walked in, &quot;Lets go out. I guess the two of us. It&#39;s what your parents wanted, me as your patriarch. They told me about that. Are you aware?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas quickly replied, &quot;Yes. Cal and Scott will be your consorts. They have agreed to it when your ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark nodded, &quot;Why don&#39;t you do that full body red suit,&quot; Mark interrupted himself, then said, &quot;Silver fishnet. How long?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas started walking to the bathroom, &quot;twenty minutes,&quot; she said as she was walking. The intricate detail required was something Thomas was out of practice doing, and Mark would ask for a hard one on a special night. Thomas stepped under the warm water of the shower and got to work.<br />
<br />
Mark was snacking on some of the food in the kitchen when Thomas walked in. Mark&#39;s gaze was locked on to Thomas&#39;s chest and whispered, &quot;Damn&quot; softly. The silver fishnet looked like metal as it both clung to and hung from Thomas&#39;s breasts and butt, yet the holes were very small and concealed their covering features well. &quot;You look great,&quot; Mark said proudly. Mark reached out to touch and mostly to fondle the erect nipple that is covered by the fine mesh silver covering. &quot;You make it difficult to go out tonight,&quot; Mark said, his eyes locked on Thomas&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, well...we better. I&#39;ll drive. Your a bit distracted,&quot; Thomas said as she grabbed the keys and a small clutch purse. Mark followed and got into the passenger seat of the car. Thomas didn&#39;t bother asking where to go, as the seafood place was over by the marina. The waitress was a woman, but she was worried at first until Thomas gave her two twenty dollar bills as a tip. Mark stuffed himself with oysters, it was the only thing he wanted. Thomas paid, and helped Mark waddle back to the car. Mark fell into a deep sleep on the way back to his grandparents house. Cal and Scott came out to greet them when Thomas pulled into the driveway. The two proceeded to arm carry a sleeping Mark to the bedroom. Thomas was in the kitchen when Scott and Cal walked in and examined Thomas closely.<br />
<br />
Scott said, &quot;Oyster breath was strong with that one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas looked at the two naked females, &quot;Ummm, what is going on with you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal smiled, &quot;We had an impromptu sex party at our peeping tom&#39;s condo. Good party. I see he went with that fishnet thing you never mention. Did you ask him, and really asked him and not play dumb about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott&#39;s attention was on Thomas&#39;s next words.<br />
<br />
Thomas nodded yes, &quot;I did ask properly, the first time, and we got the first yes. And then I got him wasted on oysters. I briefly mentioned you both agreed to be his consorts when it was time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal elbowed Scott, &quot;Hear that Scott, we are going to be consorts to the patriarch.&quot; It was news that made them both wet between the legs.<br />
<br />
Scott was quiet, as it was a lot to process, he was getting what he wanted, and was one step closer to spending the rest of his live with the one he loved the most, Mark.<br />
<br />
Thomas gave Cal a stern look. &quot;Back off Cal. This is for all four of us,&quot; she glared. Scott went back to the bedroom, leaving Cal and Thomas to talk.<br />
<br />
Cal poked at the nipple still poking out from the silver mesh, &quot;I know what your doing tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas sighed, and gave Cal&#39;s plump nipple a firm squeeze, causing Cal to moan softly, &quot;Careful...and I&#39;m fairly sure there is enough for all three of us. What did you do to that old guy from today? Do I have to go fix what you two hero&#39;s thought you did?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal smiled, &quot;I think he is okay with our changes. He had a neighbor who was happy to fill in where he was wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas was not amused, &quot;Cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal looked at the door Scott left through and then back to Thomas, &quot;We are sorry we were not here when you asked Mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas looked at Cal, then off to the doorway, &quot;Things worked out. I didn&#39;t mean to, but it happened the way my parents advised.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal looked over to Thomas, &quot;Did he say yes to marriage or becoming our patriarch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both. It will be a while on that last one,&quot; Thomas said calmly.<br />
<br />
Cal just stood there, lost in thought for a few moments. &quot;Then this is a happy day, I am proud to be a part of our family. Did you tell your mom you were going to ask him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas shook her head, a little disgusted, &quot;No...both my parents already asked him and explained to him what becoming a patriarch in our family really means. I found out a couple of days ago. I wanted more of a choice in this and not be subject to the needs of biology.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal stepped over and hugged Thomas, &quot;We will take care of you when the time comes. We will make you the happiest breeding matriarch we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas closed her eyes in tears and relaxed into Cal&#39;s strong hug. Thomas knows her mom left out some of the parts with them that she shared with her. The silver mesh was now a grey sheet as Thomas reabsorbed the tired flesh, and soon stood naked with Cal. The two then walked back to the bedroom, and found a mostly male looking Scott spooning with a naked Mark in the bed. Cal would be spending the next several minutes working to reshape his body into his masculine self. Thomas took her spot in front of Mark, gently taking his cock into her mouth. Mark was already processing the oysters, and Thomas could taste it already in the form of vibrant, young, but mature sperm. Thomas kept a steady milking on Mark&#39;s cock, not too much to get him off and wake him, but enough to keep a mostly steady flow.<br />
<br />
Mark slept all night and awoke late in the morning. Cal was nursing on his cock when Mark&#39;s eyes opened. Thomas was asleep next to him, and Scott was nursing on Cal&#39;s cock. Mark closed his eyes, and just rested, feeling his balls were about to run dry. Cal sucked Mark&#39;s cock to a strong orgasm as soon as the occasional trickle was no more. Mark&#39;s eyes opened wide as his balls throbbed....with nothing coming out, and the powerful orgasm fading too quickly. The four remained in the bed until evening, waking up, moving close to one another, and not wanting it to end. Mark pushed Scott over and sat up on the edge of he bed as a dark grey sky hid the sunset. The other three also slowly stood up, knowing they had lap practice in the morning with the team and coaches.<br />
<br />
Thomas looked over to Scott and Cal, &quot;Guys, come say with me this summer. All four of us. At least the next three weeks, until we get back from nationals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott shook his head no, &quot;You got until nationals. My parents want to spend what time they have with me before we go off to college.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal smiled, &quot;Yea...I can do most of that. I think I&#39;ll go futa after nationals. Try it out for a longer time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott sighed, &quot;I&#39;m not doing that, but maybe after moving day.&quot; Scott smiled at Cal.<br />
<br />
Cal grinned, &quot;You liked it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott nodded, &quot;I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Each one took a brief shower then toweled off enough to walk to the pool without making too much of a mess on the floor. The four spend the evening in the pool in silence, knowing they would be leaving in the morning and would not spend an evening together until the state swim meet later in the week.</p>
