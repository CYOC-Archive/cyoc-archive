<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen gave a quick look around. Everybody seemed intensely focused on Mr. Simms&#39; course, probably in anticipation of their biology exam next week, so no one was paying attention to her. Beside, her seat was in the back row by the wall and radiator, the perfect spot for daydreaming - and away from her classmates attention.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t believe how horny she was - her oversensitive clit was bulgeing more by the minute. She straightened her back a little and pulled her chair closer to the table, crossing her legs. Could it be that the curse was working? A rush of adrenaline came over her. &quot;Damn you, Kyle!&quot; she muttered under her breath. A brush of her shirt made her realize how erect her nipples had become. The combination of fear, curiousity, and lust was torturing her.<br />
<br />
Jen couldn&#39;t resist. She squirmed discreetly, softly rubbing her genitals against her thighs and the fabric of her underwear. It sent such a surge of pleasure up her spine that she almost let out a gasp. Her expanding clit pushed her panties further, tenting them painfully under her skirt. The strangest sensation spread between her legs.<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s eyes widened as she realized what was going on: her vagina was closing and her clitoris was growing into some kind of animal penis, as the curse commanded. She felt her puffy lips shift around and become more sensitive; was she growing testicles now? But they did not feel descended... Still, her panties were already too tight to be comfortable with her new condition.<br />
<br />
She slowly slid one hand under the table and on her crossed legs, her palm over her bulge. If she could tug on the fabric discretly, she would be able to move her added length out of her underwear while keeping it hidden in her skirt. She shifted her hips slightly back and forth as she pressed her bulge downward and against her left thigh. Damnit, it felt so good! As the head of her penis emerged from her panties&#39; leg opening, her cock sprang forward and stiffened under her squeezed thighs, trying to worm its way up betwen her legs with no success.<br />
<br />
Jen let out a muffled moan of pleasure from the sensation of her freed appendage brushing against her skin and past the edge of her skirt. She froze like a deer in headlights; did anyone notice? Her erection felt much longer than anticipated. Her cheeks were burning hot from embarassment, but she glanced around as casually as she could. All the students seemed focused on the teacher&#39;s voice and blackboard, and she let out a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, the situation was turning her on a bit - she was no exhibitionist, but couldn&#39;t deny that the sense of danger was exhilirating.<br />
<br />
Keeping her cock trapped under her crossed legs, she leaned forwards and extended one hand, reaching out under her skirt for the strange member. It was so thick she could not wrap her fingers entirely around it, and somewhat flexible despite how hard she had become; its end was poking left and right under her legs as if to find a way upwards, making it seem almost... prehensile. Moving along her length she felt it was gradually thinner... until she reached the head. It was flared and huge, indescribable.<br />
<br />
The touch of her fingers on this shocking discovery sent jolts of pleasure through her new member, and its throbbing became restless. She could feel a load of pre overflow from the tip, which smeared its content chaotically against her thighs. &quot;Aaah...&quot; she thought, &quot;what is this? It feels like a horse penis but not quite...&quot; The possibilities raced through her mind. She had seen a documentary on ungulate evolution once, and remembered something about tapirs being gifted with such members; they also had internal testes, which would explain her lack of proper balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is grotesque&quot;, she whispered to herself, though she couldn&#39;t deny her arousal. She had never experienced anything so good before; she could not help herself. She slouched some more to reach down her throbbing cock and grabbed it just under the head, where her hand was able to wrap completely around the girth. It was pulsating and quite slimmy, pre dripping down the underside of the member. She was amazed by how sensitive it seemed. She extended a trembling thumb against the edge of her penis&#39; flare, rubbing it in small circles.<br />
<br />
A new wave of pleasure ran through her body and her cock stiffened again, reaching almost past her knees as another load of pre slushed from the tip and dripped down her hand and wrist. She bit her lip to keep from whimpering; she felt a bit light-headed. Repeating the motion, she playfully flicked the rim of her flare with her thumb. Her member hardened some more in extasy, new sensations building up inside her. This was incredible! Moving her thumb against the slit of her glans, she gave a few firm strokes...<br />
<br />
She was overcome in pleasure and lust. Something clenched tightly in her guts and she realized she was pushing herself over the edge. &quot;No! Don&#39;t!&quot; she thought in panic. &quot;Stay... put.&quot; She tried holding her member still but her fingers were too slippery and the pressure only made it throb harder. She contracted every muscle of her being in an effort to hold back the burst of semen that was threatening to shoot from her insides.<br />
<br />
Smothering the nascent orgasm, she witnessed helplessly as a load of cum outflowed her efforts and leaked abundantly in her hand and along her length. She had avoided the worst,  but could still feel heavy beads of thick fluids lazily drip on her skirt and shoes while a faint musky scent slowly rose to her nostrils from under the table. Jen gave a quick look around, wiping discreetly her sticky hand against her skirt. The class seemed oblivious to what was happening, but how long could she keep it up? &quot;I can&#39;t control this monster; it would only end badly&quot; she reluctantly admitted to herself as her cock was still quivering, hungry for complete climax.<br />
<br />
She fidgeted uncomfortably on her chair. Squeezed tightly between her legs, the base of her stiff penis hurt in its effort to raise the member upwards; she was struggling so much to keep the thing down! The rest of her moist length was slowly but surely finding its way between her crossed knees, too. Jen squirmed on her chair to adjust her cock, but it only spread more fluids between her legs. The member escaped her grip, sliding almost effortlessly between her lubricated thighs. Her erection lifted the front of her skirt, poking further beyond the fabric... and her cock&#39;s flared head hit the underside of the table with a small thud.<br />
<br />
Jen gripped the edges of her desk, flustered as thoughts raced through her mind. &quot;I can&#39;t let this happen, I need to calm down!&quot; Her tapir cock twitched against the coolness of the table underside, its huge head smearing fluids around.</p>
