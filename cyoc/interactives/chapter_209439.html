<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff decides to head to the park, “it is two in the afternoon,” he says as he heads out of his room and down the stairs, “a lot of kids usually are in the park playing soccer or other sports. I hope some will let me play with ‘em.” The former 16-year-old hurries down the street to the bus stop, Jeff feels as if he is exploding with energy, soon the bus arrives and the boy is off to the park.<br />
<br />
Arriving at the park, Jeff hurries straight for the huge field, where the kids usually play, he already can hear cheers, laughter and shouts coming from that area. The sounds cause Jeff to smile and he starts to jog, when he arrives at the field, he is amazed to see the field almost covered in children of every age. Jeff stops at the edge of the field and looks around, his eyes soon land on a group of kids, which appear to be between 10 and 14 years playing soccer. The former teen smiles to himself and starts to head over, as he walks closer, he can tell that the one team seems to be a player short. Jeff stops and watches the kids play, not wanting to interrupt the game, he is certain that he’ll be noticed by at least one of the kids soon.<br />
<br />
What Jeff is unaware of, a few feet away a man in his 40s is sitting on a bench, looking down at his phone and from time to time seems to look at all the kids playing. Passersby don’t give the man much attention, assuming he is just a father of one of the kids, unaware to everyone, including Jeff, the man has just been released from the USP (United States Penitentiary) Arizona. He has spent 20 years behind bars for owning and distributing child porn and abusing several children. After his release, the man had moved to Florida, finding himself an Apartment in Miami, the City where Jeff and his family live.<br />
<br />
The man’s name is Darren Huff, he is 42 years old, his hair is black with some gray, he has brown eyes and a brown tan. His body is pretty muscular, not to much, but also not to little, just right for his height and weight, the man stands at 6’ 10’’ and weighs 216 lbs, this stature gives the man a very intimidating appearance. While he was locked up, he paid off a cop to smuggle a phone into his cell, Darren then used the phone to surf the internet, checking out sites with “inappropriate” depictions of children. While surfing the internet, he stumbled across the App-Version of the “Chronivac”. After reading the manual and doing some testing, like transforming a guard into a dildo, which he still owns, an inmate into a Rat, changing his hair color and regressing his age to a child, the criminal started to plot plans when he gets out of prison. ‘With this program on my phone,’ he had thought to himself, ‘I’ll never get caught doing what I love. So many possibilities to cover up my crimes… hehe… I can’t wait!’<br />
<br />
On the day of his release, after he got out of prison, Darren hurried to the nearest bank and emptied his account. Darren, having connections to the Mob and other criminal organizations, earned a handsome amount of cash in the 6-digit range, so it was not hard to find an apartment in one of the most expensive cities in the world. After settling in, Darren started to scan and store the files of children between six and 16 years, starting with his neighbors, then moving to the streets of Miami. Today, he decided to head to the park, knowing that on such a nice and warm summer day, a lot of “handsome” and “sexy” kids would be having fun. Darren already is sitting on the bench a few hours, and already had scanned most of the children, adding new children to his collection of files in the App as more and more kids started to appear. So, when Darren raises his head and spots the newcomer, a 12-year-old boy with black hair and an athletic body, the man did not waste any time and scanned the boy, Jeff of course is unaware of this and continues to watch the kids play.<br />
<br />
Unaware to Jeff, after Darren had scanned him, the Chronivac on his Laptop gives of an alarm and a warning message appears: “WARNING! Second scan of subject detected! If the second file is being edited the settings of the previous change will be set on hold, causing the first change to become permanent. The subject then must edit the first file to be able to return to normal! Do you really wish to continue? If you don’t chose within five seconds, the program will automatically accept the scan.” A timer appears, since neither Darren nor Jeff are aware of this, Jeff’s file on the boy’s Laptop is set on hold, the timer stops counting down and the program, along with the Laptop shuts off.<br />
<br />
Unaware of what had happened, Jeff starts to feel impatient, he had been standing on the same spot for at least an hour, and none of the kids noticed him. He is about to turn and walk off when he notices a boy of the group nudge a other boy and pointing at him. Jeff smiles when he sees the two boys, one seems to be around 10 and the other around 14 years old, start walking towards him.<br />
<br />
The 10-year-old, who has short blond hair with an under-cut, a slim body, blue eyes and freckles around and across his nose, looks up at Jeff. “Who are you,” he asks, “you don&#39;t look familiar. Why are you watching us,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“My name is Jeff,” Jeff says, “I am new in the area, me and my parents moved here about two days ago. I just wanted to explore the neighborhood, I decided to come to the park to see if I may be able to make friends and maybe play some soccer or basketball. When I saw you guys playing, I noticed that one team is a man short, so I figured I&#39;d ask if I could play some rounds with you,” he says, laying about his family, of course he hadn&#39;t just moved to Miami, he was born here, but he had to come up with a logical sounding story.<br />
<br />
The 14-year-old, who has a brown tan, brown hair which reach his cheeks, brown eyes and a well trained athletic body, looks at Jeff. “Why didn&#39;t you just come up to us and ask,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Because I didn&#39;t wanted to disturb your match,” Jeff replies, “I figured it would be better if I just wait until you guys were finished.”<br />
<br />
Both boys look at each other, then back at Jeff, and smile, “well thought,” the 10-year-old says, “most kids just barge in and disturb our game. My name is Jason, by the way, my friends call me Jay.”<br />
<br />
The 14-year-old nods, “Jay is right,” he says, “first impressions count and go a long way. We&#39;d be happy to have you play with us. My name is T.J., which stands for Timothy Jennings.”<br />
<br />
Both boys hold out their hands, Jeff smiles and takes them, “happy to meet you,” he says, “hope we become friends.”<br />
<br />
Timothy and Jason smile, “we&#39;ll see,” they say, “you seem like a cool guy. Come, let&#39;s introduce you to the rest of the team and have some fun,” Jason says. So, Jeff follows them to the rest of the group, all of them unaware Darren watching them.</p>
