<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Wanted this line to form the backbone of the narrative, or the one root off which all the other roots spur.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Siya emerged from behind Adam. Adam’s face moved, expressed, but seemed to radiate a reassuring undercurrent. Siya reflected that this was how she knew the plush was still Adam, as it was a trait he always had.<br />
<br />
Dan, after a wordless ribbing from his friend, was on the armchair by the TV still, leaned over, looking tired, but grinning wide. She could see in him the truth that transcended Dan too, defining him as much as reassurance defined Adam Dan was a risk taker, always rebounding to their feet, even after the biggest character assasination her mind could muster.<br />
<br />
It might be fun fucking that out of him.<br />
<br />
Little Adam smilied, standing up and walking to the far side of the keyboard, pushing it into her belly, as Dan moved over to the big armchair, readying himself. Siya patted his head, smiling at him, navigating towards her favourite option. She looked at Liam finding his characteristic spirit-raising chuckle, before looking at the details of the change, one of the preset bodies leaping off the screen, perfect. <br />
<br />
It was the one she often pondered, the Dan-based woman of her dreams, back when her dream was more grounded. Based on one passing comment he made a small part of her thought he might be trans, and she often worried what a dummy-thick Dani would look like. That, as it happened, was perfect, and just the first of a few options.<br />
<br />
>Turned into a woman.<br />
>Adaptive reproductive system fertile to all sources.<br />
>Given “the Tongue.”<br />
>Cum addiction; cum is a narcotic relaxing agent, inducing bliss.<br />
<br />
At last, with a deep breath, Siya hit commit on the changes, watching the device whirr into activity.<br />
<br />
“ACTIVATE: ENGAGE. COOLDOWN SET TO. Forty. Seven. HOURS. CONTROL REINSTATED ON. Four-teen. Forty. Six. Sun-day. STANDBY.”<br />
<br />
Dan Took one last breath, the air tickling his lungs, as that transformative energy lit up every nerve in his body, tingling. It was like his whole body had just turned into an erogenous zone, forcing him writhing back into his chair, breath skipping as his bones began to warp.<br />
<br />
It was strange, but he had broken a bone or two before, and this was nothing like that. This felt pleasant, exciting even, and so he tried to relax as it took hold of his body. He felt himself shrink, exchanging shoulder width for hip width, unable to control his quivering legs as they thickened and expanded out. As his shoulders finished contracting the sensation extended to their neck, lengthening a touch as his head went through a blinding series of shifts and warps. A few delicate coughs later, Dan emerged into a blurry world, panting and moaning as a figure stood over him. <br />
<br />
Siya, was on the edge of her seat, eyes wide, Liam not far behind, but to Dan, vision still blurry, they were just outlines. He tried to respond, to say something, at least tell them he was alright, but his words became a cutesy mumble, stopping altogether as his lips puffed out, and the weight on his torso began to shift.<br />
<br />
His pudgy gut shrank, pumping and rippling upwards, nipples and areolas hardening and expanding, as two new fist-sized mound bounded out, but they didn’t stop there. While a lot of his pudge remained the new breasts continued to grow, until they were straining their top, until they were first to bust, shortening his breath. <br />
<br />
Liam, watchinging on, mumbled to Siya, fiddled a few controls, pointing at the squirming woman grasping at her chest. There was a dark grin, and a moment later they brought up a few outfits onto the screen, deliberating over their toy’s new outfit as that toy went through it&#39;s last changes.<br />
<br />
Dan’s skin smoothed out, the new soft femenine skin expanding out in patches until it consumed her body, tingling, leaving her sensitive in it&#39;s wake, before the waves of tingling pleasure converged on Dan’s groin. He knew it was coming, knew how things had to end, and while he was scared, a growing part of him, rooted in a base curiosity, was becoming excited. “All men wonder what it would be like,” he justified to himself, “I’m just lucky enough to find out.”<br />
<br />
It started with a twitch, or a throb, his cock contracting, teasing itself smaller, filled with a rolling pressure, the force massaging his cock with increasing omnipresent tightness. Dan bit his new lip, composure failing, moaning and groaning with breaths so short it sounded like a yap, letting a sweet ‘ahn’ escape as he grasped at his groin. He felt it, both through his hand and through his nerves, as the whole assemblage slipped into his inner, lower gut, reduced to a flap of soft skin.<br />
<br />
“Ahn!” He whimpered, denied a release after the sexual tease, but it wasn’t over yet. Inside the old appendages undulated, twitching and transforming, then spreading out, expanding Dan’s ass in the process. With thick legs, a larger if still modest rear, and huge tits, Dan looked like a cross between an exaggeration of fitness and a fertility goddess, awaiting only one last shaft. His upper lips quivered, mumbled words and stifled moans slipping out, as his lower lips waved, a pin like hole dripping from inside to out. Dan moaned, the orgasmic release spasming his limbs as his lower flower bloomed.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Dan came to a few seconds, maybe a minute or two later. Liam had a dorky grin, while Siya was awed, smiling from ear to ear.<br />
<br />
“Her hair is the same.” Liam said. Siya nodded.<br />
<br />
“The, uh, whatever you call it, it must have realised I still wanted it to be our dan, so he looks a little boyish.” Dan looked down, his body now contained in a new, very impractical one-piece, well, thing. This was the epitome of a combined choice between the two of them; both cutesy and anime-inspired. It was like a while swimsuit, the hips having a kind of see-through flappy pink mesh thing, the edges lined with pink. It cut quite high on her neck, and included a gratuitous boob window. <br />
<br />
Dan stared at his not-very-boyish tits for a moment, eyebrow raised at their creator.<br />
<br />
“Well, maybe not boyish, but retains boyish elements on the face, that’s why she is so necky, long femenine neck kind of balances out the androgynous elements. I didn’t want to lose him, so she retained many of Dan’s features. Look at her eyes, they are exactly the same, same expressions too, and they still have that slight, almost unnoticeable, goofy gap in their tooth.”<br />
<br />
Dan explored it with his tongue. It was true, and to make matters worse it felt like the rest of his mouth was entirely new. “Coulth youth hath a-...” Dan paused, delicate little hands touching their face, large tongue sloughing out. Siya, of course, blushed.<br />
<br />
“Not even I knew I was into that!” She beeped, clutching Adam to her chest. Liam let out a laugh, marching over, putting a hand on the side of Dan&#39;s cheek.<br />
<br />
“Lemmie see.”<br />
<br />
Dan opened up, first relaxing his weighty tongue, then letting it roll out. It was inhumanly long, reaching down to her cleavage, and able to be manipulated with finer accuracy too. Liam considered it for a moment, the lanky man’s presence eliciting something deep in Dan’s loins. Dan smiled, as Liam pulled away. <br />
<br />
“Yeah it&#39;s pretty long.” He said, Siya looking a little confused. He opened up the Chronivac, focusing on the house for a change. “That&#39;s it. That’s all I wanted to see. What? It&#39;s not like I’m a nurse too, I just wanted to get a better look. I mean if I walked into her on the street I would just assume she is a thick girl, maybe a little necky, as you said, and those tits huge, very natural, and yet they seem to be as perfect as they can get with their size. Other than the tongue, the new DANI is basically the perfect woman.”<br />
<br />
Dani, looking on, averted her gaze, but that was no help. He glanced over Siya, staring at her with big hungry eyes, a wave of moisture flooding her loins, heart fluttering. A moment later the sensation inside her, just above her pussy, did something he didn’t expect. Like it was hungry, her uterus growled. <br />
<br />
“I need the loo.” Dani said, shooting up.<br />
<br />
“Hurry back.” Siya purred, her face still bright red, eyes still fixed on her broodmother. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, and check on the mirror while you are there.” Liam added. “I made it so any mirror displays your transformation deets, as well as how far along you are, with that thing.” He pointed at Dani’s belly, directing them back over to the screen. “You just got a whole lot more productive.”</p>
