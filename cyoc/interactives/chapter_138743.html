<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No condoms say in the trash, a pregnancy test didn’t reveal anything, and since she wasn’t exactly used to a vagina Adrian couldnt exactly tell if hers had been defiled or not. It was up in the air and ambiguous so the two of them just sat at the kitchen table silently.<br />
<br />
“So according to all these photos, the couple nicknames in our phones, and that plane ticket with my name on it, the world thinks we’re engaged,” Adrian mused while scratching her hair, “We need to get back to that magic shop now.”<br />
<br />
“But what do I tell my mom?” Shawn asked while staring at the plane tickets, “We just got engaged and if she finds out Valarie was exactly the kind of person she warned me about she’ll never let me choose a partner for myself again.”<br />
<br />
“So what you’re saying is...” Adrian trailed.<br />
<br />
“Stay like this just until the trip’s over. Then we’ll find a way to turn you back-“ Shawn started.<br />
<br />
“And find you someone who wants to marry you,” Adrian agreed before frowning and looking down at her breasts contained in a shirt she had seen Valarie in before, it was now sized to fit her, “It’s the least I can do after destroying your marriage.”<br />
<br />
The day proceeded rather awkwardly and silent after that. Adrian wasn’t sure if she still worked at Warren’s Supermarket stocking shelves or not. She wasn’t even sure if her home still belonged to her. Either way she caught a cab with that plane ticket and a bunch of her new clothes back to her place. She still had a key and when she opened the door she found it in the exact same state it had been the day before. However as she watched the jackets near the door turned into women’s jackets, the clothes in her dressers changed to fit her, and even her uniform for work remained the same.<br />
<br />
Even her roommate Frank was still the same, at least in terms of appearance. Even the argument they’d been having before he left yesterday still cling to his lips.<br />
<br />
“Rent now,” he stated without even looking up from his game.<br />
<br />
“My check is at work, I’ll pay you tomorrow,” Adrian responded coldly before walking to her bedroom and opening it again. She slipped into the room and quickly dug her uniform out. A gray polo shirt, black pants, and a green apron. She tugged her shirt off, flung her pants away and had the dress pants halfway up when a shadow looked over her. Frank stood in the doorway staring at Adrian, he&#39;d never done this sort of thing before.<br />
<br />
“Dude!” Adrian exclaimed while covering up.<br />
<br />
“There are other ways to cover your rent,” Frank stayed while staring at Adrian’s breasts. Her plans to play with them a little before she left melted and she hurriedly pulled her pants up and pulled her shirt on. Frank watched her as she grabbed her apron and shoved past him. His eyes bored into her ass as she walked away and a heavy blush formed on her face as she walked out the door. <br />
<br />
An old creepy dude stared at her ass the entire bus ride downtown. She wished a seat would open up but none did and the old man simply enjoyed a show of her body swaying with the bumping of the bus.<br />
<br />
Thankfully she arrived at work and quickly began stocking bananas. Unlike normal people actually paid her attention, but once again it was t attention she wanted. A curious number of men walked up and asked her to lead them to something. Was her ass just that fascinating? She’d stared at sexy women before but never to this degree. Even break was different. She went to the back room and suddenly all the women were hawking at the engagement ring on her finger. They kept asking about babies and how it happened. Adrian literally didn’t know how Valarie and Shawn had gotten engaged so she had no clear answer. Work was awful, the ride home was awful, and things only got worse when she got home and realized she hadn’t grabbed her check. The second she patted herself down the shadow of Frank was over her again.<br />
<br />
A gross grin spread over his face and he grabbed Adrain’s shoulder tightly. She backed towards the door but he instead dragged her to his foul smelling room and threw her on the bed. His pants dropped and his dick was shoved right in her face.<br />
<br />
“Suck it,” he ordered.<br />
<br />
“No, I, but-“ Adrian rambled.<br />
<br />
“Suck it or you’re evicted,” Frank ordered with her breath laced with liquor. Adrian trembled and opened her mouth, hesitating for a mere second before closing it around his penis. It immediately sprung to life in her mouth and she went wide eyed as he grabbed the back of her head and began guiding her through the motions. Up and down, sliding down the shaft, and then back of the throat and top of the tongue. She wanted to gag but he kept pushing.<br />
<br />
“You enjoy that don’t you?!” Frank demanded with a grin. Adrian mentally screamed, “no” in response. Just when she was thinking of biting his dick twitched and splooge filled her mouth. She went wide eyed and gagged as his dick was pushed into her cheek.<br />
<br />
“Swallow it,” Frank ordered and with a shudder Adrian did just that. Frank looked over her with his lips pursed and gave his second order very quickly, “Now lick it clean.”<br />
<br />
Adrian cringed but followed orders licking her roommates dick until all his cum was off it. He then walked out of the room while she began gagging and panting. He went to the kitchen and moved around for a good fifteen minutes. When he returned his dock was erect again and enclosed in a condom.<br />
<br />
“Strip bitch,” Frank ordered.<br />
<br />
“No!” Adrian exclaimed before Frank grabbed her and practically tore her shirt off. It snagged on her ears and hurt a lot but it was the worst part. Frank undid her bra and released her monster breasts to open air and proceeded to fondle them. He then pulled her pants and panties off before ramming his member right into her vagina from behind. She gasped in pain as he began thrusting over and over again. Pain and pleasure wracked her body as an alien weakness spread from her nether regions. Frank used her breasts as handholds and before she could do much he had cum, bloated up the condom and pulled out. She collapsed on the bed in pain and coated in sweat while Frank stood up equally sweaty.<br />
<br />
“Consider your rent covered,” he announced before standing up.</p>
