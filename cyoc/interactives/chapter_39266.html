<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I dare you try this on.&quot; Mark said to Dean who just stared at the mass of soft looking black leather material he was holding, trying to figure out what it actually was, &quot;Come on, it's just clothing...don't be such a wuss! Here, I'll make you a deal, if you go put that on and then open the dressing room door so I can see it, then you can take it off, come back out here and pick anything in the store, and I promise I will try it on!&quot; <br />
Dean snatched the big bunched up wad of leather and headed into a nearby dressing room to finally figure out what this thing was Mark dared him to wear; so he could put it on, give Mark a quick laugh, and then get him back by picking something even more obnoxious for him to try on.<br />
<br />
As Dean closed the door to the dressing room, he looked at the mass of material in his hand and saw something that looked like a waistband sticking out one side.  At first he thought it must be a pair of leather pants, or full chaps like bikers wear, (also the same ones some of those fags he's seen in NYC and San Francisco wear), but then he realized there was a lot, but not quite enough material in his hands for it to be either of those.  Now even more puzzled, Dean decided to stop guessing, and find out exactly what humiliating thing he was going to have to model for Mark.<br />
<br />
Grabbing the thing that looked like a waistband, Dean let go of the rest of the material and then shook it until it unraveled.  As it did, he realized that the &quot;waistband&quot; he was holding onto, was actually the back strap of some type of bizarre leather thong! <br />
&quot;Great, and I was fuckin' worried about it turning out to be chaps! This is definitely much worse!  Wait a minute, if this actually is a leather thong, then what's all this extra leather for that's attached to it?&quot;<br />
Dean quickly found the actual waistband of the leather jock, or thong or whatever it was, grabbed it with both hands and shook it again as he pressed it against his waist at the same level as the jeans he was wearing.  Suddenly the bizarre article of clothing took it's proper shape and Dean stared blankly in disbelief at it for a moment as he realized that it definitely was a men's leather jock/thong-type thing (obviously something only a fag would wear) however the really bizarre part, was that all that extra leather he had wondered about, appeared to be the pouch attached to the front of the thong! Having worn jocks before whenever he played sports, Dean expected to see a relatively normal sized pouch to fit his averaged sized 'junk' into, but the pouch on this thing was freakin' enormous! The ridiculous size &amp; shape of this thing reminded Dean of one of those hanging, upside down bulb-shaped leather 'speed bags' that boxers use to warm up with; except this one was completely deflated, sagging; and the more he thought about it, actually even slightly bigger than a speed bag; and instead of it being attached to the ceiling &amp; filled with air, this one was attached to this strange leather thong!  <br />
<br />
Dean realized Mark had obviously found this ridiculous thing in some X-rated, gay-oriented, Halloween section of the store that he hadn't seen.  Suddenly Dean jumped as Mark knocked hard on the dressing room door and said, &quot;Come on Dean, what's taking you so long?  Just hurry up, strip down and throw it on...or are you having trouble fitting that huge package of yours into that tiny little leather pouch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, very fucking funny there Mark!  You're gonna pay for this one when it's my turn to pick out one for you!  I'm just going to put it on over my jeans since I didn't wear any underwear today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way bro, it's not my fault you didn't wear underwear today!  Go 'commando', put that thing on and then open this door, or I'll  tell that new girlfriend of yours about our escapades last weekend!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do know what a huge asshole you are, right?&quot; Dean said sacastically but in defeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not really&quot;, replied Mark in a teasing tone, &quot;so how huge an asshole am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mark was saying that, Dean stripped nude, and began putting on the obscene leather thong.  As he slid the waistband up over his legs to around mid-thigh, he stared down into the huge 7&quot; diameter opening to the enormous leather pouch which, even though it was completely empty, only got wider and rounder the further down it hung...actually, judging by the feeling of leather rubbing against his legs, Dean could tell that while the top of the pouch was only about 2-3 inches away from the bottom of his relatively decent, golf-ball-sized testicles (which always hung slightly lower than his average-size cock), he could feel that the bottom of the huge pouch was actually hanging the whole way down to somewhere around the middle of his shin bone!  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well Mark, since you're making me put on this ridiculous pornographic, gay thong thing, let me just give you a little gay analogy to put it in perspective for you...Proportionally speaking, if my dick would be considered big enough to completely fill a 'normal asshole'; you're such an exponentially 'bigger asshole'; that in order to completely fill you, I'd actually have to be an insanely endowed total freak of nature with a gigantic monster cock and volleyball-sized testicles so freakishly huge, they not only would fill the pouch of this stupid leather thong, they'd actually stretch it out almost to it's breaking point!...THAT'S exactly how huge an asshole you are!&quot;<br />
<br />
Never one to let Dean get the upper hand in a battle of sarcasm, Mark immediately retorted, &quot;Well I guess I'm really lucky then because &quot;proportionately speaking&quot;, I'm pretty sure you're little 'junk' isn't even big enough to completely fill even the smallest asshole!...Ha! Remember there 'little D', never mess with master!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Just as Dean finished his graphic analogy, and heard Mark say something sarcastic back that Dean chose to ignore, he realized he was now completely wearing the leather thong.  There was a small snap in the front at the top of the pouch which didn't seem to really do anything, but Dean snapped it shut anyway.  It was strange how the thong actually seemed to fit him perfectly everywhere, except of course in the very front where he could feel his dick and balls just dangling freely in the open space at the top of the cavernous pouch. He glanced in the mirror to see just how ridiculous he looked before opening the door to show Mark.  The enormous pouch hung down to his knees and kind of looked like a huge flat black leather balloon that had partially been filled with water.  It was narrowest at the top where it's 6-7&quot; diameter opening covered his crotch and attached to the rest of the thong.  Even though the huge pouch was obviously empty and kind of baggy-looking, you could still see that it just kept getting wider and thicker the further down it hung.  It looked like the widest thickest part was probably only an inch or two from the very bottom, and most likely would be, at the very least, double or possibly even triple the diameter of the very top if something was actually able to stretch it out that far.<br />
<br />
After about a minute or so of checking himself out in the mirror, Dean decided it was time to emerge and get this over with.  <br />
&quot;All right dickwad, here's what you've been so anxiously waiting to see!&quot; Dean announced as he swung the door open. &quot;I hope you're happy now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, that's fucking awesome!&quot; Mark was laughing his ass off seeing Dean standing there in front of him wearing the obscene looking thong with the giant sagging pouch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok are you done?  Can I take this stupid thing off now?&quot;, Dean pleaded with Mark who was still laughing hysterically, as he unconsciously reached down to scratch a small itch he felt which seemed to be centered somewhere on the top of his dick near the base.  As he gently scratched it through the leather, he realized that the thong must have somehow slid down at least 2-3 inches lower on his body in the front compared to when he first put it on.  He knew that was the case because as soon as his finger contacted the leather pouch he didn't really even have to put any pressure on it before he felt the base of his cock pressing up against the leather, allowing him to easilty scratch the annoying itch.  Dean remembered that when he originally put the thong on, the roughly 7&quot; diameter opening to the pouch fit completely around his cock and balls...they seemed to be positioned almost perfectly in the center of the pouch's wide opening, like a bullseye on a dartboard.  <br />
Since the top of the huge pouch opening was now resting against the shaft of his penis, it was obvious that the weight of all that extra leather in the front must have caused the thong to drop lower until Dean's average equipment, luckily was at least big enough to stop it from sliding down any further.<br />
 <br />
As Dean was starting to turn and go back into the dressing room, Mark's laughter started to die down enough for him to catch his breath and say, &quot;Dean, hold on a second...I just gotta see something before you take it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, hurry up what is it?&quot; For some reason, as Dean turned back towards Mark he suddenly started to lose his balance and stumble forward...it felt as if his normal center of gravity had somehow shifted.  The huge wrinkled leather pouch actually started to swing out ahead of him a bit which only made things worse.  Honestly, Dean was amazed just how heavy that giant pouch felt as it swung forward. It seemed to be at least twice as heavy as should of been by his estimates, but then again, maybe the leather itself was a just a lot thicker &amp; heavier near the bottom. <br />
Luckily Mark had already taken a couple steps towards Dean already, and was able to prevent his clumsy friend from falling on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks man, I don't know what the hell happened there.  Just completely lost my balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just saved your ass again is what happened!&quot; Mark said with a friendly smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, whatever.  Okay, let's hurry up and get this over with so I can take this damn thing off!  So what exactly did you want to see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well see this tag? I accidentally ripped it off the thong before handing it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, now we'll probably have to buy this stupid thing because you tore off the damn tag.  Okay, to help speed things along, I'll bite, what does it say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark began to read the tag, &quot;It's actually very funny, it says:  <br />
'The Super-Stud, Monster Thong'...Many gay men say that when it comes to the male genitalia, there's no such thing as &quot;too big&quot;. <br />
Do you dare to find out if that statement is true? If so, the Super-Stud Monster Thong is definitely for you!<br />
Instructions:  The SSMT is is an adjustable, one-size-fits-all leather thong.  To activate the huge self-inflating pouch, all other clothing must be removed prior to wearing. Once on, close the small snap on top of the pouch to begin the inflation process.  Maximum inflation time: 3 minutes.    WARNING:  SSMT can only be inflated once.  If for some reason maximum inflation is not desired, the SSMT can be removed after 2 minutes.  Removing the SSMT before 2 minutes is not recommended!  Once the SSMT pouch has been fully inflated, it cannot be deflated.  Do not activate unless both you and your partner are absolutely ready to test the absolute limits of the phrase &quot;bigger is better&quot;!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops, I guess I should have read the entire thing before you put it on&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, ya think?!<br />
<br />
&quot;On the brightside, at least you didn't close the snap; if you had, we'd obviously be able to hear the air rushing through the inflation nozzle, wherever that is; and since you've had it on for at least a minute or two, I imagine that by now we'd definitely be able to see it inflating!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well lucky for you, I don't hear any hissing air so thankfully the auto-inflation mechanism on this thing must be broken, beacuse since I wasn't told not to, not only was I naked, I actually did close that snap!  Hopefully now you'll let me take this thing off and you can try to quickly and quietly put it back where it was without the store clerk even noticing!&quot; Dean was so angry and yet relieved at the same time, he didn't even notice that as he spoke he had gradually been leaning back further and further to prevent himself from being pulled forward again.<br />
<br />
As Dean was scolding him, Mark found himself lookiing at the huge leather pouch hanging down from Dean's crotch.  As Mark began to stare at it intently, he suddenly realized that it actually did seem to be much fuller looking and less baggy now than it was the last time he had glanced at it less than 20 seconds ago! He glanced up at Dean who was still running his mouth about how irresponsible Mark was and something about him accidentally locking himself out of the dressing room, or something along those lines; so instead of saying something to Dean about his observation, Mark just let Dean continue to ramble as he once again lowered his eyes to focus on Dean's huge &quot;Monster Thong&quot; pouch.  Even though he still didn't hear the air nozzle, this time as he watched there was no doubt the pouch was slowly but steadily plumping up bigger and thicker right before his eyes!  Mark wasn't gay, or at least he never thought he was, but as he watched the air inflate that huge pouch of Dean's bigger and bigger by the second, Mark suddenly felt some movement in his own pants as he realized that his own, impressively thick 9&quot;er was also inflating to it's full size!  <br />
Mark's horniness only increased as he continued staring at Dean.  Suddenly Dean stopped talking as he noticed 2 things simultaneously; first that Mark was completely ignoring him and hadn't heard a word he said; and two, that for some bizarre reason, Dean felt like he was standing up straight, but found that he was actually leaning pretty far back to keep his balance.  He didn't really feel dizzy at all, but now that he thought about it, the thong's pouch actually felt much heavier than he remembered.<br />
<br />
As some of the final wrinkles in the Leather pouch were beginning to plump up, stretch and smooth out; Mark swore that it looked as if it was getting heavier and even starting to hang down lower as it continued to stretch &amp; expand.  <br />
Maybe it was just his increassing horniness, but Mark thought he could actually see the vague outline of a freakishly huge penis and 2 gigantic testicles starting to appear in the leather.  But wait, if that was the true... <br />
<br />
Incredibly horny and practically mezmerized by the possibility that this ridiculous thought he now had racing through his head could actually be reality, Mark leaned forward and reached out to touch Dean's huge, still inflating, leather pouch to see if it really was just being filled with air like he originally thought it was; or could it possibly be that absurd second option...that somehow this &quot;Super-Stud Monster Thong&quot; was actually causing his best friend Dean's averaged-sized cock and balls to &quot;inflate&quot; to the insane proportions necessary to fill it's enormous leather pouch to capacity!  <br />
<br />
Just as Mark's hand was making contact with it's target, reality struck Dean like a ton of bricks...Not only was the thong's auto-inflation mechanism not broken, he knew he had now been wearing the thong for well over 2 &amp; a half minutes...and judging by the leather pouch which now looked like a huge overinflated beanbag chair hanging from his crotch, Dean &amp; Mark both now realized that it was completely filled to capacity, not by air, but by Dean's once normal human-sized genitalia that had grown (technically 'inflated') into a gigantic monster cock and basketball-sized testicles which had now grown so big they were actually beginning to stretch the leather pouch out almost to it's breaking point!  <br />
<br />
As they both felt the pouch's seams straining under the immense pressure, the watched as the leather groaned and stretched one final time and then stopped...the 3 minute mark had apparently now passed and &quot;Maximum Inflation&quot; had been acheived! <br />
<br />
Dean was still in complete shock as he tried desperately to comprehend what had just happened to him.  For some reason, Mark on the other hand realized he was hornier now than he'd ever been in his entire life!  He just kept thinking about much he wanted to peel that thong off of Dean so he could see just how freakishly huge he had become.  He had no idea why all these gay thoughts were suddenly flooding his mind and just the thought of being with a woman again now actually seemed to nauseate him.  Mark wondered if it had anything to do with that last warning on the thong's tag...something about not activating it unless you and your &quot;partner&quot; were ready to prove there's no such thing as &quot;too big&quot;; or something like that.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, maybe he and Dean were 'partners'.  Mark's mind and memory were definitely having some major issues all of a sudden.  Actually the more he thought about it, the more it seemed to make sense.  In fact, as he began stroking his thick 9 incher he had just freed from the confines of his pants, he kind of remembered Dean even telling him something not too long ago about wanting to fuck him!  Yeah, that's right, I'm almost positive Dean said that once he put on the thong and became an insanely endowed freak of nature with a cock and balls so freakishly huge they'd stretch the leather to it's breaking point, then he'd finally be big enough to fuck me and completely fill my huge asshole!  Damn, I can't wait!</p>
