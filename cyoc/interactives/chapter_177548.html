<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff thought about what he wanted to turn his father into. He was single and lonely, always having crushes but never having the confidence to ask anyone out or tell them how he felt. But now with the Chronivac, he was going to change that. He typed in his father’s details.<br />

<br />
Satisfied with the new profile for his father, Jeff pressed the “start transformation” button, a timer appeared and started counting down from 1:00:00, 0:59:59. <br />
<br />
Jeff walked downstairs and saw his father sitting on the couch watching Football. “Oh there you are son, just in time for kickoff,” his father said. “Oh sorry, I was just studying,” Jeff stammered. Jeff studied his father before the changes became active. He was wearing a t-shirt and shorts, trying to look casual and comfortable after working a job that he hated, but he needed to do so he could provide for himself and his son.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat down next to his father and pretended to be invested in the game. Near the end of the first quarter, he looked over and saw his father’s first noticeable changes. His father’s skin had become less rugged and more clear and fair, and his hair had become slightly longer, slowly inching down his head and onto his shoulders. He was also slightly younger now, the bags under his eyes fading away as youth slowly filled him. John looked at his son, confused as to why Jeff was staring at him. <br />
<br />
Halfway through the second quarter, Jeff looked at his father again. His stomach was flatter, replacing the big gut that his father once had. His hair was longer as well, the grey fading and being replaced by a beautiful shade of brown. <br />
<br />
Halftime hit and John got up from the couch. Jeff looked at his fathers still changing body, his butt had begun to slightly expand, and his t-shirt was slowly becoming smaller, almost becoming a crop top. His shorts had become slightly longer and tighter. His hair had become longer and flowing on the bottom near the middle of his back. His body hair was receding back into his body. John walked over to the fridge, unknowingly giving his son a good look at his now plump ass. As he searched through the refrigerator, he failed to notice that the usual bottles of beer had seemingly vanished as he grabbed two bottles of Pepsi for him and his son.<br />
<br />
John walked back to the couch, handing a bottle to his son. Jeff observed that his father’s body was a lot more feminine now. His face now had makeup on, showing off his new intense beauty.<br />
<br />
The game resumed, and the two continued to watch the game. The fourth quarter finally began and Jeff looked at his father again. His t-shirt had fully became a crop top, exposing his now flat tummy. His shorts had become long, black leggings that showed off his new bottom very well. He now had small converse sneakers on, which were very pink and feminine. But most importantly, he now had two small mounds protruding from his chest. <br />
<br />
John began to squirm as his underwear became very uncomfortable. He quickly readjusted it so it would fit as his penis and testicles slowly receded into his body.<br />
<br />
With only 10 minutes to go, Jeff looked over to see what had changed. His father was quietly humming to himself. His voice had gone up about one octave. His body had taken a slim figure, and he now looked like a very masculine twenty-something woman. The still-changing John changed the channel from Football to a sitcom.<br />
<br />
5 minutes were remaining, and John’s penis and testicles had been sucked into his body, forming a cute little clitoris and vagina. Finally, John had shrunk, becoming shorter than his son. Glasses formed and appeared on his face, allowing him to see. He giggled as he watched the sitcom on the television. The physical transformations were complete.<br />
<br />
2 minutes left, the mental changes started to kick in. John no longer thought of himself as Jeff’s father or even a male, she now thought of herself as Jane, a sixteen year old girl who was so excited to be at her crushes house. <br />
<br />
She had long, flowing brown hair that went down to her butt. She had a cute little nose, full lips and her eyes had become a lighter brown. She was shorter than before, standing at Five foot Four next to Jeff’s Six foot even. She had a gorgeous slim figure showing off her B Cup Breasts well. She was wearing a black crop top that showed off her flat tummy and had long black leggings that showed off her legs and ass perfectly. <br />
<br />
The Chronivac was filling it’s progression bar and below it was a timer with a countdown. 0:00:03, 0:00:02, 0:00:01, 0:00:00... Transformation Complete.<br />
<br />
Jane looked over to her crush. Jeff looked over to the girl that used to be his father. They stared into each other’s eyes. Jane blushed and brushed a piece of hair behind her ear. “Thank you for inviting me over, Jeff. Your house is great,” Jane said. “Of course,” Jeff said, placing his hand on the girls shoulder. Jane let in a deep breath and looked at her crush. “I have something to say. Ever since we met in class, I’ve been in love with you. I...want to be your girlfriend,” Jane said, clearly nervous.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn’t know what to do. On one hand, Jane was technically his father and they just met, on the other hand Jeff wouldn’t be lonely and he would finally have a girlfriend. He knew what he had to do. Jeff smiled and leaned in closer to the girl. He closed his eyes and their lips met. Jane’s eyes went wide before closing and returning the kiss. Sparks flew in her mind, she was finally kissing the man that she loved. <br />
<br />
Jeff finally broke the kiss and looked at the girl. “I love you,” Jane whispered. “I love you too,” Jeff said before kissing her again. They turned and faced the television, Jane put her head on her new boyfriends shoulder. They cuddled, watching the sitcom together, a tear forming in Jane’s eye. She was so happy to finally be with Jeff.</p>
