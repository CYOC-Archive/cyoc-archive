<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At 16 you were the youngest of the prisoners, the former 23 year old was the closest in age. The pirates all appeared to be around twice your age at the youngest and you were passed over and left to watch as the transformative orgy commenced. <br />
<br />
Darin put up a fight but the smaller pirate was dodgy and Darin was slow in comparison. After a swing or two of Darin&#39;s fists the pirate pushed him off balance and pressed him into the wall, seconds later, Darin was all grey, bald and yelling in pleasure. <br />
<br />
The same type of thing was happening to all the prisoners, and all but your guard had abandoned their posts as there were no more prisoners. Your attention was ripped away from the plight of the others as your guard unlocked your cell. A bald beefy man in his mid 30&#39;s wearing ratty old clothes which he simply ripped from his body as he lumbered into your cell. He smiled at you, &quot;Donchu worry, we&#39;s not gonna leave you out.&quot; <br />
<br />
You cringed and glanced across the room begging for anything to give you a glimmer of hope. You noticed that all the transformation turned the men into stout strong men, older, horny and gay. Everyone was average looking except the Captain who was strikingly handsome, taller, more muscular and leaner compared to any of the other pirates.<br />
<br />
Scanning the room you noticed the door to your cell is still open! Your prayer had been answered! &quot;Comeer!&quot; the naked guard growled lecherously as he swung his meaty arm at you. You dodged underneath his grasp and ran behind him. You were much quicker and as he was only halfway turned toward you, you were slamming your whole body into his to try to knock him into the metal bars. In your mind you imagined this would knock him out and you could get away. In reality, he is over one and a half times your weight and you made him lean against the bars for stability...<br />
<br />
Panicking, you back away as he clumsily grabs at you again. The guard grabs the bar with his other hand as his grab made him lose balance again. Seizing the opportunity you bolted out the open cell, swinging it shut behind you! The reckless guard left the keys in the hole and you didn&#39;t hesitate to twist them and yank them out.<br />
<br />
The loud clatter made many pirates look up, some laughed, some still screamed in ecstasy but none brought themselves to stop and pursue you. You stepped backwards from the cell and dropped the keys out of immediate reach. You bolted toward the exit but only got a step towards it before you were flung into a bear hug and lifted off the ground, your arms held firmly at your sides.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a feisty one.&quot; the captain said with a smile, &quot;Nice try.&quot; <br />
<br />
Caught off guard by being flung around unexpectedly, you just looked at his charming smile in horror. As he moved in for a kiss you wiggled wildly and tried to headbutt him. The Captain quickly grew tired and squeezed as tight as he could, both hurting and suffocating you. <br />
<br />
All you could do was arch your back and try to hold your breath. With your head tilted back the captain couldn&#39;t kiss your mouth so he started with your neck. You could feel his tongue caress your neck, you could feel his grip loosening as your shoulders, arms and chest expanded and your body completed its journey into manhood. You could feel his penis straining at his pants to get at you as your belly began to expand and you began changing from lean to stout... and something else!<br />
<br />
In a desperate flail, you loosened your arm enough to grab the dagger he had in his belt. Luckily for you, he was expecting trouble and it wasn&#39;t secured. It slid out of its holster and with a twist of your wrist, slid easily into his abdomen.<br />
<br />
His expression changed from arrogance and lust to horror as he set you down. Your hand still on the dagger you pulled it across his abdomen, slicing his intestines and ensuring his death. His mouth agape he collapsed to the ground. You bolted out of the cave not waiting for the orgy participants to notice.<br />
<br />
As you exited you notice only one guard outside, he glances at you uncaringly, expecting you to be a gay pirate, &quot;Done already? Well welcome aboard, Clothes is ova there. An&#39; don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll last longer over time.&quot; the man gestures to a pile of clothes and belongings taken from the prisoners. You race over eagerly to find shoes so you can run away without worrying about twigs cutting up your feet.<br />
<br />
Because you are racing you get shorts, a shirt and shoes on. You had to try several times before finding bottoms that fit your new girth. You found twine to use as a belt and tucked the dagger in it before you hear a worried, &quot;Cap&#39;n?! Oh my GOD, CAP&#39;N!&quot; <br />
<br />
The guard looks at you unsure of what to do, thinking fast you say, &quot;Check it out!&quot; in a deep and convincing voice that sounded like your father. <br />
<br />
The guard looked relieved to have orders as he raced into the cave you just came from. You felt pretty confident that the part of the curse that changed him and the rest mentally, left them with... incomplete... mental faculties. &quot;Easier to control that way.&quot; you reasoned and felt disgusted.<br />
<br />
The coast now clear, you reached down grabbing your sword which seemed smaller given your new size, picked a direction and ran. Somehow you could sense the Captain was hanging on, but wouldn&#39;t last more than a few minutes. You suspected that the pirates would be on your trail as soon as he was dead.<br />
<br />
Your body jiggled and bounced with each step, much different from your young lean body from a few moments ago. You pushed yourself for several minutes and then resigned to walking at a quick pace, hoping that the other stout men couldn&#39;t fare better than you.<br />
<br />
A voice hissed in your head. Alarmed you grabbed the dagger and looked around. The hissing grew louder and became a masculine scream but didn&#39;t seem to be coming from anywhere in particular. &quot;Come out you demon!&quot; you cried not knowing what else to do or say.<br />
<br />
As you swiped at the air wildly with the dagger it began to burn in your hand as the screaming became unbearable. Instinctively, you somehow knew with certainty that the Captain died. You tried to let go of the dagger but your muscles wouldn&#39;t listen, You fell to the ground in pain. You think you were screaming but couldn&#39;t hear anything as a vision pushed itself into your mind. <br />
<br />
You watched the Captain from a point floating above his corpse. As you looked down you saw some pirates mourning him, one was tenderly fondling his crotch. As you gazed on the body seemed to be changing. All the traits that made him stand out from the other pirates seemed to be fading away. Wrinkles and age spots were forming, his perfect teeth became gangly, his lean muscular build was coated in fat and the muscles faded away. This took his appearance from mighty to still being respectable. His body hair became patchy and looked oily, his hairline began to recede. Finally, he shrunk 8 inches which made his appearance completely unimposing. The pirates around the Captain appear to be yelling and in a panic.<br />
<br />
Your vision comes back to you, the pain and noise has faded. You feel fatigued but also know you must press on... With a heavy grunt you heave yourself up and your pants fall down, much too large for you...<br />
<br />
You look down at yourself and notice your frame is now lean and you have a 6 pack. Your muscles are bulging and as you retighten your belt, your shirt barely covers your taller torso.<br />
<br />
You need... so many things... but first and foremost, you need to not be here. You press on looking for better clothes and help. what is your goal from here?<br />
<br />
(Orientation left unchanged, you can make Nate gay if you want, I think being kidnapped and assaulted is a good enough reason to resist. The transformation was dark magic, it used the life force of the person being transformed to fuel the changes. [physique, mentality] A witch was left with child by a sailor who never came back, she cursed him thinking she was saving women from her fate, but ended up victimizing men. The dagger gave the cursed sailor his intelligence back and he took advantage of... well, everything.<br />
The dagger steals a desirable trait if you wield it when someone injured by it dies, in this case attractiveness, or you could say Nate looks exactly like the now dead Captain. [Nate didn&#39;t know what he looked like after the Captain got to him.])</p>
