<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam walked into the lecture room, backpack heavy on his shoulder as he found a seat off to the side to take. The professor was already into his lecture as Adam entered, he stopped and looked right at the late student. &quot;Adam, good of you to join us. You can help me illustrate my next point, come up and join me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam could barely make out the professor where he stood in the shadows, the glare of the projector on the screen behind him casting him into more darkness. Slowly, he got to his feet and stepped down to the front of the classroom. Eyes stared at him from the seats, though he couldn&#39;t make out any faces, still he felt those stares on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris, come on up, you can help.&quot; The professor said, and another figure stepped down from the seats.<br />
<br />
It was a familiar face to Adam, Chris was one of his friends from high school, though he had graduated where Adam had been left behind. That&#39;s right.. he didn&#39;t graduate, so what was he doing at a college?<br />
<br />
Chris wasn&#39;t particularly tall, though he did have a couple inches on Adam, though he had a stocky but solid build from years of hockey. His blond hair was in it usual buzz cut, and he shot Adam his crooked smile he saved for when he was up for some mischief. &quot;Now, mammals have a few traits that most of them share.&quot; The professor continued as Adam and Chris stood next to each other. &quot;Hair or fur, birthing live young, and of course milk production. Chris, if you will show us on our volunteer?&quot;<br />
<br />
As the professor said the last part, Chris reached over and tore open the front of Adam&#39;s shirt. He felt something heavy flop free as he did so and looked down. Through the torn fabric of his shirt a bulging pink and block mottled udder was now hanging from his lower stomach, four long teats hanging from it. Adam was frozen to the spot, as Chris reached over to grab one of the teats, starting to tug on it, after a couple of tugs, milk shot free from the tip of the teat, splashing across the floor of the stage. &quot;Who&#39;s a good little dairy cow?&quot; He heard as a whisper into his ear from the professor. He looked over, and met eyes with Bruce who started to milk Adam along with Chris. &quot;Moo for me, little cow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Moo for me.&quot; Chris said from his other side. Adam shook his head, clenching his eyes shut and trying to ignore what was going on. But in the way of dreams he could still see Chris and Bruce&#39;s hands on his udder, coaxing milk free with every tug. It felt so good, but he clenched his jaw shut. A hand slipped down into his pants, he didn&#39;t know who&#39;s, but the first tug on his cock made him lose his will to stay quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moo!&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Adam shot up in bed, sweating and shivering at the same time. He quickly slapped his hand to his stomach. No udder, but the four small teat nubs were still there. Worse, further down, his cock was rock hard and a small damp spot was staining his bed sheet at the tip. Cool breeze washed across him from the open window, where the dark sky was just starting to turn a rosy pink at the horizon. Adam slipped out of bed and walked over to the window, intending to enjoy the breeze and cool down from the dream. No doubt his wake up call would come in an hour anyway to get up and dressed for morning chores.<br />
<br />
At the window he saw a figure lurking by the milk barn. It was hard to make out, but the general height and size seemed to fit Bruce more than Hank, but there was something off. The way he walked seem to have a strange gait, and he looked to be wearing some sort of weird.. hat? He only had a second to try to make it out as the figure slipped inside the milking barn and out of sight.<br />
<br />
Curiosity got the better of Adam, and after a quick change of underwear, he slipped into shorts and a tee instead of his work overalls, and stomped into a pair of boots. Quickly and quietly as he could he slipped out of his room. He stopped for a second by Bruce&#39;s room and popped open the door slowly to peek inside only to find an empty bed. He continued out of the farm house, moving quietly so as not to wake Hank and then made his was to the milk barn as quickly as he could. <br />
<br />
Not that he really thought Bruce was up to something, but any information he could get against the mountain of blackmail pictures the other man had would be something. Inside the milk barn was quiet. There were no cows inside it, and the only noise was the soft mechanical click of one of the machines in the furthest stall running. It was the stall Bruce used for Adam&#39;s milking, he noted with a shake of his head.<br />
<br />
He slipped closer staying low to be hidden by the stall walls, trying not to make any noise to alert Bruce to his presence, stopping just before the stall. He peeked around the corner, but all he saw was Bruce, plucking the milking machine free of his chest. He wore only his boxers and boots, the nubs on his stomach looked a little swollen, but otherwise no different than Adam&#39;s. &quot;If you can be up this early..&quot; Bruce started speaking, not even looking over to where Adam was. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll start waking you up so we can milk you before we take care of the cows instead of after.&quot; He rubbed at a hairy pec with one hand as he finally looked over to where Adam crouched.<br />
<br />
Adam stood up and stared at Bruce, not really knowing what to say. &quot;So you..?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruce just laughed. &quot;I told you the same thing happening to  you I went through. Gotta milk myself every morning or it gets uncomfortable. Course, sometimes I let the chest build up a little, makes my pecs a bit more...&quot; He gave one a little heft. &quot;Bouncy?&quot; He chuckled, then motioned to Adam. &quot;You&#39;re starting to put on some muscle yourself there. Doubt you&#39;re making enough milk for that to be noticeable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam looked down, even though he was wearing a shirt, he could see the way the fabric hugged his chest that he had grown there at least a bit, it didn&#39;t comfort him that he could make out his nipples poking against the shirt though. &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; Adam asked, feeling on the verge of breaking down.<br />
<br />
Bruce looked at him, then sighed. &quot;Because its what our dads agreed on. Dad said your dad wanted you to learn about hard work and maybe grow a little. Well, you&#39;ll grow more than a little. Then at the end of the summer, we let you go back home.&quot; Bruce said, grinning and laughing, but his laugh faltered after Adam didn&#39;t join in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad knows about this?&quot; Adam asked, more than a little shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah.&quot; Bruce motioned Adam towards the stool, and in his state of semi-shock he complied without thinking. &quot;He worked on the farm a few summers when he was younger, I&#39;ve seen the pictures of him and dad, I&#39;ll show you if you want.&quot; Adam couldn&#39;t help but stare at Bruce. It was like he was being told his father had run away and joined the circus when he was a teenager. He didn&#39;t even struggle when Bruce came over and lifted his shirt off of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But dad.. he doesn&#39;t..&quot; Adam looked down to his own stomach, where Bruce was attaching the milking tubes, each one sucking into place with a small pop.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like any dairy cow. If you don&#39;t keep up with the milking it just sort of.. dries up.&quot; Adam&#39;s eyes shot  back up and over to Bruce who was grinning. &quot;Ah, maybe I should have told you that part. Course, you lose most of the other benefits. Not all.. but most. Me? I like it too much to give it up. But if you start up again, it comes back quicker each time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Adam understood some of his dad&#39;s visits to the farm and why he was happy to leave Adam behind as he got older. &quot;So after this summer, I&#39;ll just go home and back to normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly.&quot; Bruce said as he set the last tube. The machine got to work, and while it wasn&#39;t quite like when the cows were milked, a small stream of white was now flowing into the tubes and back into the machine. Adam just wished it didn&#39;t feel as good as it did. &quot;Some of it stays.&quot; Bruce said as he reached out and ran a finger through the dark hairs that hand begun to grow in the middle of Adam&#39;s chest, then stroked one of his own hairy pecs. &quot;But hey, maybe you&#39;ll decide to stay, we&#39;ll see how much you like the other benefits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other benefits?&quot; Adam stared at Bruce.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, don&#39;t want to ruin the surprise.&quot; Bruce said jokingly. &quot;You know, if you just go along with it you might actually enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam was about to ask another question when the milking barn door opened and Hank stepped inside. For a moment, Adam wondered if he really did know what Bruce was doing, but when he approached the milking stall he looked at Adam and nodded in seeming approval. &quot;Already got him giving milk? Well done, son.&quot; He motioned towards the cup on the wall, and Bruce quickly poured him a sample from the small amount Adam had given. Hank sipped and nodded. &quot;Mmm.. good quality too. Shame I only have you for the summer.&quot;  He handed back the cup and Bruce quickly washed it and returned to to the peg as Hank continued to stare right at Adam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got a job for the two of you.&quot; He said, turning to Bruce. &quot;After you&#39;re done with the milking, put the cows out into the east pasture to graze then take the truck into town. Hardware store has a load of lumber and barbed wire I need you to pick up, part of the west pasture fence got knocked down and needs fixing. Then drive it out there and fix it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Bruce said with a grin, and Adam was shocked to find he echoed Bruce in the same instant.<br />
<br />
Hank simply nodded his approval and left. &quot;Is he..?&quot; Adam started with a look to Bruce, and then down at the milking machine still hooked up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, he&#39;s.. well.. I&#39;ll tell you later. I think you&#39;ve got enough to fill your mind for now and we got work to get to.&quot; Bruce started unhooking Adam. &quot;Go get dressed, we got a long day.&quot;</p>
