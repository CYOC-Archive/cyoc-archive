<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I looked at Jaime.  “I guess I should I’m sorry, too, Jaime, but the truth is that I’m not.  You have brought this on yourself.”  With that I made a wish in my head so that Jaime wouldn’t hear it.  I wished that no matter what was about to happen to her, she would not be able to resist it and that she would even get some enjoyment out of it.  I also wished that she would undress.<br />
<br />
“What the hell are you doing now?” she squealed as her hands began to unbutton her shirt.  “What am I doing?  I can’t stop this!”  She got more frantic the more that she tried to fight what was happening.<br />
<br />
“I told you,” I said as she threw her shirt on the bed and leaned over to remove her shoes, “that you brought this on yourself.  So just shut up and stop complaining.  The sooner you do, the sooner this will be over.”<br />
<br />
She removed her shoes and then unzipped her skirt.  She slid it down her long legs and placed it on the bed as well.  Her hands moved to the front of her bra and she undid the clasp.  She removed the bra quickly and exposed her very nice-looking breasts.  They appeared to be about a C or maybe a D cup.  They were definitely not as big as Becky’s breasts were.  Maybe that explained the jealousy, I thought.  She removed her panties as well and now stood naked as well.<br />
<br />
I looked up her body up and down.  I did so quickly, because I could feel Becky glaring at me.  Sure enough when I looked at my girlfriend she had an irritated look on her face.  “Sorry, love, just making the comparison.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, really,” Becky said, folding her arms.  “And just what did you find?”<br />
<br />
“Simple,” I said, “she doesn’t hold a candle to you.”  Jaime scoffed loudly.  I turned my attention back to her.  Jaime was certainly not bad looking.  She had long, wavy brown hair.  She had a very nice tan, which must have been aided by the use of a tanning booth.  I mean it’s not that warm and sunny in Pennsylvania year round.  As I said she had nice breasts, nice legs, and a nice figure overall.  She didn’t seem to be quite as fit as Becky, which is not to say that she was out of shape, just that Becky was in better shape.  I hadn’t been able to look at her ass yet, but even if it was the best ass in the world, I’d still prefer Becky to her.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” I said to Jaime, “you disagree?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Jaime said as she gritted her teeth.<br />
<br />
I laughed.  Becky chuckled as well.  “That’s funny,” I said, “I do believe I heard you admit that Becky was better looking than you.”  Before she had a chance to lie to us again I added, “So why don’t you tell me, and I wish you would be honest, who is better-looking, you or Becky?”<br />
<br />
Jaime shook her head quickly again.  “Becky,” she replied.<br />
<br />
“Oh, thank you,” Becky said in a tone that was half childish and half sarcastic.  “I don’t think that a compliment from an admitted slut means that much, but thanks anyway.”<br />
<br />
Jaime shot her a look of scorn.  “Fine, are we done now?” she said.  “Have you both had your fun?”<br />
<br />
“We’ve only just begun,” I smiled.  I looked back at Becky.  “Are you ready?”  She nodded that she was.  This wish I made aloud.  “Jaime, since you like to fuck people over so much, you’re going to be fucked over literally.”<br />
<br />
Her eyes went wide with fear.  “No, please don’t!”  She screamed.  “Please don’t rape me!”<br />
<br />
“I’m not going to rape you!” I said.  “I wouldn’t think of such a thing.  I’ve made it so that you’ll be a willing participant in this.”  Jaime breathed out in relief.  “You are still going to be fucked, though, just not by me.”  Before she could ask what I meant, I made the wish.  “I wish that Becky would grow a cock that would be a perfect fit for Jaime and would be able to bring Jaime to ultimate sexual pleasure.”<br />
<br />
“What?!?” Jaime screamed.  Becky and I both grinned devilishly at her.  Jaime looked at my girlfriend and could already see the change taking place.  Becky’s clit was once again growing and pushing forth from her vagina.  The change didn’t take nearly as long as it had when we switched genders, probably because only one part was changing.  As soon as her clit was completely outside of her body, her scrotum grew back and her testicles flopped back down into place.  The clit had once again take its shaft form and the tip of her cock was forming.  I was amazed by the change, as I had time to fully focus my attention on it this time.  Becky seemed to be enjoying the change again as she was already stroking the still forming cock and moaning in pleasure.  It grew out to be about 9 or 10 inches.  Now it was mine turn to feel jealous since it was certainly bigger than mine.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, this feels just as good as the first time,” Becky said as she ran her hand over it.  “Feels different with my own hand on it, too,” she said to me.<br />
<br />
“What did that mean?” Jaime asked, looking at me.<br />
<br />
I shrugged it off.  “It will take to long to explain it right now.  Just get ready,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Get ready?” Jaime asked as uncertainty filled her voice.<br />
<br />
“Yea,” Becky said as she approached Jaime.  “You’re all mine.”<br />
<br />
Jaime appeared as if she tried to back away, but once again her legs did not move.  I assumed the part of my wish with her not being able to resist prevented her from fleeing as well.  “Please…” Jaime pled.  <br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t worry,” Becky said.  “I wouldn’t think of hurting you.  You’re just going to feel physically what I felt psychologically.”  Becky grabbed Jaime’s wrist and forced her hands down on top of the bed.  She forced Jaime to bend over and spread her legs.  Becky tugged at her cock a few times to get it harder and positioned herself right behind Jaime.  <br />
<br />
Jaime looked at up me and pled one more time with her eyes.  I just shook my head.  Becky proceeded to insert her cock into Jaime’s slit.  Jaime’s eyes went wide with surprise as she wasn’t quite ready.  Once Becky had started she did not stop.  She relentlessly thrust her cock into Jaime and quite literally fucked the hell out of her.  <br />
<br />
Becky seemed to thoroughly enjoy herself as she pumped Jaime.  Jaime did not appear to be having the same experience.  It seemed as if she was in pain.  But as Becky continued the look on Jaime’s face changed, as did the sounds that came forth from her mouth.  Her moans of pain and anguish had turned into moans of pleasure.  Her facial expression changed to match her moaning, as I could see slight smiles appearing on her face.  Becky grunted as she thrust back and forth.  You would have thought she was a man herself by how she was handling herself and how she was, no pun intended, manhandling Jaime.<br />
<br />
I realized that Becky would probably come sooner than Jaime.  I knew that I wouldn’t be able to wish Becky to not come right away, since she didn’t agree to it, and I certainly wasn’t about to stop her now.  I did wish that Jaime would come as soon as Becky did, so that she would truly get pleasure out of the experience.<br />
<br />
It was not long after that that Becky’s cock did explode forth into Jaime’s slit.  At the same time that Becky moaned with approval, Jamie screamed out in sexual ecstasy.  At least the wish worked, I thought.  Becky removed herself from Jaime and Jaime collapsed face first onto the bed.  Not wanting her to ruin her clothes, I wished again that all the fluids from the sexual encounter would vanish.  I turned back to Becky and asked, “Good, huh?”<br />
<br />
Becky was still catching her breath.  She just nodded as she smiled with a supreme sense of satisfaction on her face.  When she did catch her breath, she said, “It was definitely worth it.  But I’d like to be back to normal now.”  I wished that she would and soon her cock disappeared and was replaced with her normal pussy.  <br />
<br />
By this time Jaime had also finally recovered from being fucked.  Her face was sad and her voice was low when she said, “Are we done now?”  <br />
<br />
“I suppose so,” Becky said.  “I’m satisfied.  Unless Joe has something else in store for you.”<br />
<br />
“No, I don’t,” I said.  “Jaime, I hope that maybe you’ll realize the error of some of your ways.”  She stood back up and started to put her clothes back on.  I wasn’t sure if she was paying attention to what I said.  “After all, though I have no intention of bothering with you again, I should think that you’d know I can do what I want.”<br />
<br />
“Is that a threat?” she asked.  She was putting her shirt back on by this time.  “You know, maybe I could just call the cops and tell them what happened.”  I didn’t say anything.  “Oh, what’s wrong?  No plan for that?”<br />
<br />
I smirked at her.  “Well, I suppose you have me there,” I said.  I looked at Becky who appeared shocked and confused.  “I mean, I wish that you would never tell anyone about what just happened to you and that only you, me, and Becky would ever know.”<br />
<br />
Jaime’s eyes went wide with disbelief upon realizing what I did.  “You fucking bastard!”<br />
<br />
“Now, now, is that any way to treat someone who just provided you with the best sex you’d ever had?” I asked.  She didn’t say anything.  “It seems that maybe Becky and I will have to check up on you every now and then and make sure that you’ve learned a lesson, as much as we’d rather not.”<br />
<br />
“I hate you both,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Yea, yea, we’ve established that,” Becky deadpanned.<br />
<br />
“We’re done with you for now, Jaime,” I said.  “But just consider yourself warned.  By the way, where did you happen to be right before you got here?”<br />
<br />
“I was at my store,” she said.  “I can’t imagine what’s been going on since I left.  They’ve probably freaked out and reported me missing!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, OK,” I said.  “Well I suppose that would be true if my wish to bring you hear hadn’t made sure that no one would take notice that you disappeared.  So you should be OK there.”<br />
<br />
“That’s a relief,” she admitted.  “So why don’t you just wish me back there so I don’t have to walk or get a taxi or something.”<br />
<br />
“Why, that’s a good idea,” I said.  “More convenient, after all.  But, just to further emphasize that we can do what we want to you, I wish that you would reappear in your office completely naked and that your clothes would all be in a different part of the store somewhere.”<br />
<br />
I saw her start to panic as I made the wish but as soon as it was complete she was gone.  I looked at Becky.  She was laughing uncontrollably.  “Don’t you remember from her memories that her office is within plain sight of the sales floor?  And that you didn’t wish for no one to notice she was naked or that she had just reappeared?”<br />
<br />
“Yea, I know,” I said.  “Eh, she’s resourceful.  She can just get one of her lackeys to go find her clothes.  Let her explain her way out of that one.”<br />
<br />
“Do you really think it changes anything that happened?” Becky asked.<br />
<br />
“No, I don’t,” I admitted.  “Nothing would have.  But, remember, everyone else knows that the truth is the truth, and it was satisfying to see her go through that.”<br />
<br />
“Yea, I guess it was,” Becky said.  “Still, I don’t know.  Feels like we were just being petty.”<br />
<br />
“To an extent we were,” I said.  “Nothing compared to what she’s done in her life, though.”<br />
<br />
“What now?” Becky asked.<br />
<br />
I faked being indignant to her.  “You know, I’ve had all the ideas so far.  Why don’t you come up with one?”<br />
<br />
Becky stood up and walked to the mirror.  She stared at her reflection for a minute and then turned around to me and said, “I’ve got one!”</p>
