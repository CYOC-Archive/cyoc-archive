<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryan&#39;s brother, Ethan, got a two-fer deal. Ethan got both Bryan and Brock. Hugo thought that Jacob was obsessing way too much over Bryan and needed to be reminded that cocks are supposed to serve their owners.<br />
<br />
Ethan didn&#39;t bother with college. He didn&#39;t have any academic potential. He was an artist that worked in all kinds of art forms including dance, painting, sculpture, and video production. However, the two brothers were as intimate as two straight brothers could be. They&#39;d never seen each other naked but They assumed that as twins they were the same.  Still it was weird holding his twins penis in his hand.  <br />
<br />
Ethan examined Bryan’s cock.  It was 9” long and thick like a can of Coke with two egg sized nuts beneath.  Just like Ethan’s. Except Bryan had his pubes shaved down to nothing whereas Ethan had a bush.  Ethan placed Bryan in his bag and looked at Brock.  <br />
<br />
Brock was a big dude and he did not have a dick to match. He was 6’ 5” tall but   It was only 4 inches long and as thick as a can of redbull he had two softball sized testicles and he had neatly shaped pubes.  Ethan  placed Brock in his bag careful to put bryan on top.  Ethan left for his apartment.  <br />
<br />
When they arrived Ethan put Brock in a drawer and focused on Bryan.  He held his brother gently “how are you doing?” Ethan asked.  Bryan was quiet but he responded “it’s a little bit strange having you holding my penis”. Ethan chuckled “yeah it’s definitely not something that I thought would ever happen” he moved his hand and gently stroked the shaft.  “Want to see mine?” Ethan asked “to make it even?” Bryan was not sure but thought it might be something “sure.”  Ethan got naked exposing his nearly identical penis with his big bush of pubes.  <br />
<br />
“Wow we are basically the same” Bryan said. “Yep” Ethan agreed as he picked up Bryan and held him next to his penis, they were gently touching each other.  “Except I am hairy” Ethan boasted. Both boys were hard.  Ethan gripped the two boners together harder. “I want to cum” Bryan moaned and Ethan began to stroke both cocks. It didn’t take long before they started to blow their loads.  Ethan looked down at Bryan covered in and dripping cum and brought him to his mouth and licked him and then deep throated him.  <br />
<br />
“Ethan don’t” Bryan yelled “your my brother it’s wrong”. Ethan kept going until Bryan came a second time “ohh yeah that’s right you are so fucking good at that you little slut.”  Bryan was exhausted and so with a smile Ethan placed him on the bed.  “Ethan why did you do that?” Bryan asked.  Ethan thought for a moment and then said “because I wanted to see how you tasted bro.”  This turned Bryan on a little, “you can do it again soon. We got to do something about Brock.” <br />
<br />
Ethan took Brock out of the drawer.  Brock saw that Ethan was naked and had a big dick like Bryan. “Whoa nice hog” he said to Ethan.  Ethan smiled and said “thanks bro”. He took Brock and held him down next to his cock.  Brock’s smaller penis was embarrassing next to it.  “My younger brother got all the dick genes” Brock blurted out. “Really” Ethan asked . “Yeah he’s only 13 but he’s probably bigger than you” Ethan thought it over and said “we’ll have to see. Wants his number?”<br />
<br />
Brock’s little brother didn’t take much convincing to skip school and come over.  When he arrived he introduced himself as Gunner. “Why are you naked?” He asked.  “Because I have your older brother here in dick form.”  Ethan handed Gunner Brock.  Gunner was not sure what to do.  “Hey little brother” Brock said “it’s cool we’re all naked here.”  Gunner started to strip.<br />
<br />
Gunner was 13 and looked like a young Brock. He was tall blonde and muscular.  Unlike Brock he also had a huge manhood.  Gunner was over 12” long hard and was as thick as a bottle of water with golf ball sized balls.  “Wow” was all Ethan could say.  Gunner noticed Bryan on the bed. Ethan had to explain that was his twin.  Gunner picked up Bryan and examined him.  Ethan only had eyes for the boys huge rod as Gunner was stroking Bryan.  Bryan was ready to go again and was at full mast.  “Finish him off” Ethan said.  Gunner was hesitant but then he began to jack off Bryan until he blew his third load.  <br />
<br />
Ethan got down to his knees and started to lick and then suck Gunner’s manly cock.  Gunner began to moan as Ethan sped up and down the cock.  Gunner’s ass clenched and his fuck stick spasmed before spraying out the white hot jizz down the older boys throat.  Gunner felt like a man a real man.  He slapped Ethan’s face as he pulled his penis out of his mouth.  “Good girl” gunner teased.  Little did he know that Ethan was going to dick The boy down when he got the chance.  <br />
<br />
Gunner picked up Brock by his shaft. “Not so big and manly are you” he taunted “I’m the big brother now, you’ll do anything I say”. Brock was humiliated “yes” he said and Gunner corrected him “yes master.”<br />
<br />
Gunner was not gentle while handling Brock’s penis.  He pulled and prodded it laughing at his size.  Ethan was gently cradling Bryan but he couldn’t pass up the chance to get gunner.  While the boy was distracted humiliating his brother, gunner dicked him.  The fat 12 inch stick hit the ground with a thud.</p>
