<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter groaned.  Joce had gone overboard with this spell of hers.<br />
He'd barely been in the gym for twenty minutes, and he had to be at least 600 pounds of rock hard muscle, seven and half feet tall and nearly that across.  He had barely a foot left before his shoulders touched each wall of the locker room.<br />
<br />
Still, as much he was worried about the problems of his size, he still had to admit the idea of being such a massive girth was really enjoyable.      <br />
He ran a massive hand over a gargantuan pectoral, remembering the almost orgasmic sensation of them ballooning to this size; it looked as if someone had welded one of the lockers of the gym onto his chest.  He couldn't see below them; the three feet that they stuck out of his body blocked most of his lower body.  All he could see was his lower legs if he contorted his body just right.  The calves alone looked like basketballs, but harder and veined with blood vessels that would be major arteries on a smaller man.<br />
<br />
However, he could feel his abs and thighs; the former rock hard bricks, the latter a go three feet in diameter, veritable tree trunks of strength.  He knew he shouldn't wish for it, being already at dangerous proportions already, but he hoped to swell to even larger proportions, to become stronger than a superhero, to be Joce's massive man, able to do anything she desired.<br />
<br />
Joce cooed happily as she watched Peter check out his own body, and blushed furiously as his thoughts flooded through.  She had planned to only let this go on until her laundry was done... but now she wanted to fulfill Peter's desires.  She'd keep this up until he was satisfied.  She was happy with him in any shape, but letting him was making her so happy, she'd bring him right back here and fully use the empty house... to think that she'd been a virgin before this wonderful meeting....<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you must be new here!  I've never met anyone here who was bigger than me before.&quot;  Peter turned to see the largest member of the gym, Derick, approach him.  Derick was a good 450 pounds of muscle, a former Olympiad, and someone Peter had longed to emulated- at least until he had heard how the man had a tendency of putting down anyone who had a scrap of flab upon him or didn't spend four hours within a gym.  Until Peter had joined the swim team, he'd had to endure Derick's taunts.  He must not recognize Peter due to his excessive size.<br />
<br />
Peter had to admit that he enjoyed being bigger; and if Joce's spell was still in effect, he knew that soon Derick would have to deal with someone who was not only bigger, but twice his size!  Peter was prepared for the sensation of growth, when Derick gym buddy Chad, who was almost the same size a Derick, butted in the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang, who's the new guy, Derick?  You might have to give up your title of the king of the gym.&quot; He paused, looking over Peter.  &quot;You look vaguely familiar.  Are you related to Peter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter smiled nervously.  &quot;Er, yeah, he's my cousin.  You know him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Derick laughed derisively.  &quot;Yeah, we know the pipsqueak.  Maybe you should consider donating some of your muscle to him; he needs it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter fumed for a moment before realizing that he WAS Peter, and he was larger than Derick, and even if the spell was gone, nothing would change the fact.  <br />
<br />
Both men turned away and Peter anticipated the sensation of growth.  But then he remembered the tiny size of the locker room, and more importantly the door of the locker room.<br />
<br />
Joce's voice rang through his head. 'Don't worry about the door, I'll get you out when you need to.  But just enjoy this for now, being bigger than any of those idiots.'<br />
<br />
'And with a great girlfriend to boot.' Peter thought back at her.  Then the familiar tingle shoot through his body.  It started in his calves again, and they seemed to inflate as if someone had a tank of muscle plugged into them with the handle on 'wide open'.  They grew larger than ever before, as Chad and Derick's muscle got added to his body.  They were now even larger than they had been at Joce's house, like full size medicine balls, pumping and bulging as they heaved out wards.<br />
<br />
Peter sat down, so he'd save himself hitting his head on the ceiling, as his body grew slightly just attempting to keep up.  The locker room tiles cracked under his weight.  They were soon ground to dust as Peter's hips widened to accommodate his expanding quads, now a good five diameters across.<br />
<br />
As his pectorals bulged and filled out with the added muscle of Derick and Chad, his shoulders finally met the lockers on either side, and crumpled them in wards as the rest of his body adapted to support the  gargantuan pectorals that pulsed out wards, now each big enough to make their own bodybuilder.  Peter, completely under the spell of feeling his own body grow under his hands, held the sides of his chest muscles, admiring how they didn't look like breasts, but kept a chiseled box look.  He now unable to even reach his front.  that barely changed as his arms swelled, trying to fit a good hundred pounds on each.  He flexed the massive guns, marveling at how they crumpled the lockers like tissue paper.  He laid a hand under his pectorals.  His abs swelled, and Peter vaguely remembered that Chad was world famous for his giant six pack.  Had they been on any other, Peter's abs would look like an overstuffed stomach- not quite out to the width of his pectorals, but making him feel like he could take on any sumo wrestler and win with one thrust.<br />
<br />
Peter gazed as the sensations subsided.  his lower half of his vision was blocked off by the wall of pectorals.  There'd be no way he'd able to get out, let alone move- the walls were cracked by his basketball shoulders and luggage sized biceps.  One of his legs had broken the bench into splinters. <br />
<br />
Joce practically squealed happily, involuntarily thrusting against her hand, utterly adoring her one tonne boyfriend.  She sighed and prepared to free him from the locker room.<br />
<br />
'Peter, I'm going to shrink you momentarily, so you can get out to the gym.  You'll grow back to this size as soon as you're out the door; no worries.'<br />
<br />
Peter nodded, and frowned as his newly gained muscles shrank; however, he could still feel their power, as if they were invisible.  This theory was proven as he grabbed the locker room doorknob and crumbled it like tinfoil before stepping into the gym proper.<br />
<br />
Within moments, a powerful wave filled him like hot air, and Peter now stood a full 8' tall and a full tonne of muscles.  Derick and Chad turned as his massive shadow fell over them.  They gaped as he surveyed the gym equipment, and picked up the entire rack of weights with one hand easily.  He hefted it a few times, then tossed it aside, it barely worth his while.  <br />
<br />
It seemed he only then noticed them.  One massive fist punched another massive hand.  &quot;Hey Derick.  Is this all you guys got?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joce sighed happily, her laundry done.  She was surprised that Peter was enjoying this more than she was....</p>
