<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Juan Tiller for the help!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy blinked as he found himself in the living room of a big house. It was expensive but messy. Empty beer cans, sweat stained shirts and weight equipment covered the floor. The smell of must here was strong, and for a moment he had the strangest idea that it was his house and he was a dumb muscle head. He shook the thought away. Too obvious.<br />
<br />
The other thing about the house was that the AC must have been on the fritz, because it had to be at least 80 degrees in here. He started walking around the house, feeling flustered, starting to sweat. Troy wandered into the kitchen, looking for something to drink. The sink was out of service. The shower in the bathroom wouldn’t work.<br />
<br />
As he searched the house, the temperature increased. He checked the thermostat. 85. Troy went to the window over the kitchen and tried to open it to get some circulation going.<br />
<br />
The window shocked him, and Troy felt the taste of copper in his mouth.<br />
<br />
“What the hell is going on here? I’m a phoenix, I’m resistant to fire, and here I am sweating like a pig.” Troy gasped, pulling at his clothes.<br />
<br />
He felt like he was in a sauna with a parka on. Troy looked down at himself and noticed his muscles were less defined, his abs had smoothed over. Had the window been a trap?<br />
<br />
“Yes, it was a trap.” A deep, resonant voice spoke from behind him. “No leaving the house. No opening the windows, and no wearing clothing.”<br />
<br />
Troy whirled and saw a massive ogre standing in the doorway naked.<br />
<br />
The ogre’s gray-green skin glistened with sweat. He was heavily muscled with a big belly. Powerful, thick legs that looked like they could crush boulders. A large dick and balls swung heavily between them, cock leaking precum on the tile floor of the kitchen. In one hand he held a case of beer. <br />
<br />
The ogre took out a can and chugged it in one gulp, burping loudly and crumpling it.<br />
<br />
“Fresh meat-and a rare one at that. I gotta admit, it was getting pretty lonely in here,” The ogre said, sauntering his way over to Troy, his cock and balls swaying with each step. “Like what you see, pal?”<br />
<br />
Troy blushed and covered the tent in his pants, trying to hide his arousal. <br />
<br />
The ogre looked oddly familiar to him. As the ogre grew closer and the stench of his musk became apparent, Troy realized where’d he’d seen the ogre before.<br />
<br />
“Mothar?” Troy exclaimed. “From the magic show, right? What the hell happened to you? What is this place?”<br />
<br />
The ogre stopped, surprise crossing his face. “Uh, yeah, I’m surprised you remember me. I thought I got erased from existence. You’re a fan?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Thought that other guys was pulling some bullshit with his merging baloney.” Troy said, loosening his collar as the heat intensified again. He was so parched. The cold beers in Mothar’s hand or even his sweat might work to quench Troy’s thirst. “W-wait, you were changed? What happened?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m afraid I don’t remember much. I was in a fight, I lost and woke up here as Owen.” Owen said, taking a swig and letting out a satisfied burp. “One of my masters came to me and told I could live here. Food, drinks, as much free sex as I wanted…as long as I made my guests more comfortable.”<br />
<br />
“You’re an AI construct. You live in a machine, and this world isn’t real. Don’t you want to leave?”<br />
<br />
“No, I’m happy here!” Owen snapped his fingers and the kitchen turned into a messy bedroom. “You’re looking a bit overheated in those clothes. Why don’t you take them off and come get a beer?”<br />
<br />
“A beer?” Troy licked his dry lips.<br />
<br />
“Ice cold.” Owen popped the tab on a beer and held it out to Troy. “Clothes off first. That’s the deal.”<br />
<br />
“And what will happen if I do that?”<br />
<br />
“You’ll probably feel much cooler.” Owen chuckled. “Neither of those things are traps, Troy. Well, the beer just makes you crave more beer, but that’s part of the design of the machine, not some machination on my part. You know, to make sure you spend money at the bar when this is over.”<br />
<br />
“I…” Troy’s resolve wavered. “Wait, why am I sweating? I’m a bird, we don’t have musk and phoenix are resistant to open flames.”<br />
<br />
“Artistic license. Not much of a game if you didn’t.”<br />
<br />
“Ah. In that case, no way. I’m waiting for player two to join.”<br />
<br />
“We could be waiting for a while. A second on the outside is a minute in here. And you have to last three real-world minutes to beat me.”<br />
<br />
“You’re stalling,” Troy shook his head, sweat dripping off the tip of his beak. “You just want me to strip and get close to you. I bet if I grabbed for that beer, you’d pull me into a hug and shove my beak into your armpit.”<br />
<br />
“Smart.” Owen grinned. “But if you aren’t falling for it, I’m going to enjoy this cold beer while you sweat.”<br />
<br />
The ogre snapped his fingers and the room turned into a living room. He walked over to the flatscreen TV and turned on an action movie. Then he flopped down in the middle of a big couch, spreading his legs wide. A fan was blowing air across him and spreading his musk throughout the room. The ogre tipped the beer in a salute to Troy and then gulped it.<br />
<br />
Troy sagged against the wall. The room was sweltering. He was woozy, his clothes sopping wet with sweat. This wasn’t a fun game, this was torture. Hard mode sucked.<br />
<br />
That was when he saw a dildo halfway under the coach. Red Rocket. His design. He could spot it anywhere. <br />
<br />
“Hey bud, you, uh, got a license to use my product in your VR game?” Troy spoke.<br />
<br />
Owen glanced down at the dildo.<br />
<br />
“You’re the guy that owns that sex toy line.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded weakly, wiping sweat from his forehead.<br />
<br />
“You’re not gonna sue are you?” Owen said weakly. “I’m a big fan of your stuff. Trained a ton of bottoms with that one.”<br />
<br />
“Water.” Troy demanded.<br />
<br />
“All I have is beer?” Owen gulped his cold brew and smacked his lips happily. <br />
<br />
“Roll it to me.”<br />
<br />
The beer rolled to Troy’s taloned feet. <br />
<br />
Troy eagerly popped the tab and chugged it. He burped, licking his lips. Good beer, just like the stuff he had at the bar earlier.<br />
<br />
“Good stuff right? Heard it’s on tap.”<br />
<br />
“It is.” Troy nodded. “Thanks.”<br />
<br />
Owen shrugged uncomfortably. “I’m not supposed to…but the other guy isn’t here and I’d rather not get sued by you.”<br />
<br />
“So, uh, how does this work?” Troy felt a bit cooler, the air not so hot. “I mean, all of this and what you can do to people.”<br />
<br />
“I have access to all of Dolan’s Books-All the VR machines do. I use Time to age or regress people. I have access to Beast and Myth and Body, but I rarely need to use Body, Time can mostly affect people however I want.” Owen grinned.<br />
<br />
“Example?” Troy leaned forward.<br />
<br />
“Okay, say some elderly guy hops in. I can regress him to 18, then progress him to 23, and alter his history. So he stumbles out a beer-swilling linebacker for his college football team. Obviously, I can change his species too. College guys hops in? Fast forward him twenty years as a big-rig driver or construction worker.”<br />
<br />
“Big changes.”<br />
<br />
“This is hard mode, after all. I’m limited by what mode they play in.” Owen shrugged. “You’re the third guy who’s tried me in Hard Mode.”<br />
<br />
“So, what’s your plans for me?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno. Rhino bouncer? Beaver construction worker? Basically a blue collar type combined with an animal or myth that catches my fancy.” Owen grinned toothily. “I’m something of an artist, so I like leaving a calling card. A tattoo.”<br />
<br />
The air warmed up even more. Troy fanned himself with his wings. It did nothing but blow heated air around.<br />
<br />
“No use doing that. You only get cool by sitting with me and drinking a brewski.” The Ogre guffawed. “Hard Mode is, you know, Hard.”<br />
<br />
“If it takes him ten seconds out there to put in his chips…” Troy said.<br />
<br />
“Ten minutes here. Clock doesn’t start until he shows up.”<br />
<br />
“Then why are you turning up the heat now!?”<br />
<br />
“You’re cute when you get frazzled.” Owen grinned and rolled another beer to him. “Wanna sit down and watch the movie with me?”<br />
<br />
“No.” Troy said, holding the beer against his forehead and leaning against the wall. “Too hot. So what animals and myths are your go-to’s?”<br />
<br />
Owen frowned. “Well, I have a bunch. Goblinoids. Bears, beaver, rhinos, bulls, bulls with udders-don’t ask, it’s self explanatory-elephants, boars and pigs. Basically, anything that pairs well with a body type like mine.”<br />
<br />
“Can’t help but notice avians didn’t make your list.” Troy cracked open the second beer and sipped it, enjoying the coolness.<br />
<br />
“Not the sweaty musky sort, as you’ve already pointed out.” Owen said.<br />
<br />
“Figured.” Troy said. “Wanna make a deal?”<br />
<br />
“Deal?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. What if I offered you an official license to use our products?” <br />
<br />
“I’d have to take it up with Dolan.” Owen shifted uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
“Really, cause this might be the only offer you get if I lose, right?” Troy said.<br />
<br />
“...I don’t know about that.” Owen eyed up Troy. “You sure I can’t interest you in watching the movie?”<br />
<br />
“Are you trying to get me near your armpit?”<br />
<br />
“Sure. But it’s also a good movie and you seem resistant to me thus far.” Owen shrugged, sending a wave of musk through the room. <br />
<br />
“So why didn’t you force yourself on me when I started the simulation?”<br />
<br />
“Against the rules. It has to be consensual.”<br />
<br />
“Makes sense,” Troy sighed. “What movie?”<br />
<br />
“Lie Truths, with that Austrian actor guy.” Owen smiled and patted an empty space on the couch. “I get all the channels here.”<br />
<br />
Troy warily sat down next to the malodorous ogre.<br />
<br />
“See?” The ogre grinned. “I’m not touching you. Strip.”<br />
<br />
Troy looked around at all the clothes lying on the floor. The ogre had said that the first rule was no clothes. The ogre didn’t wear clothes. So…<br />
<br />
“Are these other people’s clothes, then?”<br />
<br />
“Good guess!”<br />
<br />
Troy checked his watch. Four minutes left. The room felt like an inferno. It had to be over a hundred degrees now, and rising. Was it programmed to raise the heat like this until he gave in?<br />
<br />
Another minute ticked past and he felt the temperature jump another five degrees. Had Owen been lying about the ration in time disparity between here and the real world? What if it was an hour in here for every second out there?<br />
<br />
He caught Owen giving him a side-eye, smirking as he watch Troy squirm.<br />
<br />
“Fucking hell I can’t take it anymore!” Troy said.<br />
<br />
He shucked off his soaking wet clothes, showing off his athletic body and tossed them into the corner. Troy leaned back into the couch and enjoyed  the cool air passing over his damp form, feathers soaked. He spread them and coughed a bit at the strange musk his own body was emitting.<br />
<br />
Troy sighed, happy to finally feel cool but embarrassed at being naked and giving in.<br />
<br />
“There you go! Feel much more comfortable now, don’t you?” The ogre laughed and adjusted his junk, draining another can and tossing it in a pile next to the couch. “No one’s going to complain about a hunk like you naked.”<br />
<br />
Troy had to admit, he was much cooler.<br />
<br />
“...Owen, am I naked in the real world?”<br />
<br />
“Yep.” The ogre was busy watching the movie. “But that’s not important. Comfortable?” <br />
<br />
Troy nodded and sipped his beer.<br />
<br />
“Good.” The ogre threw his arm around Troy and let it rest on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
The ogre’s delicious musk filled his nose.<br />
<br />
Troy resisted licking the arm pit, though his cock had gone rigid. The ogre had fiddled with his musk and made it magically attractive and filled with sex pheromones. But Troy had resisted it at full blast in the magic show and he resisted it now.<br />
<br />
Instead, he raised his own arm and draped over the ogre’s broad shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Ha!” The ogre grinned. “You’re interesting! Most guys don’t fight back!”<br />
<br />
“I’m not most guys.” Troy said. “And I’m playing to win.”<br />
<br />
Troy tipped the can back and drained the last of the beer. He sighed and tossed the can onto the floor with the rest of them. The ogre’s musk and the alcohol was lowering his inhibitions, and the ogre’s cock was at half mast. Owen had it so easy, just sitting there, waiting to seduce whoever entered the game.<br />
<br />
“I get it now.” Troy said, eyeing the ogre’s cock.<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” The ogre stared into Troy’s smirked, spreading his legs, giving Troy better access to his crotch.<br />
<br />
Troy found himself reaching over and stroking the ogre’s large shaft, enjoying the warmth of Owen’s member as it pulsed and throbbed to full mast.<br />
<br />
Owen leaned over and kissed Troy’s beak, the ogre’s own hand grasping the phoenix-kin’s shaft and stroking it.<br />
<br />
“Your mouth is getting dry.” Owen said, holding out a beer.<br />
<br />
Troy reached for it and paused. “That’s my third…”<br />
<br />
“And?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll lose my inhibitions, right?” Troy swallowed, trying to moisten his mouth, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
“What’s so bad about that?” Owen whispered softly. “You could be a bear truck driver, a gorilla weight lifter, a badger road worker. Simple, comfortable lives. You don’t care about the Books, you just wanna be happy, right?”<br />
<br />
Troy moaned, the ogre’s big fist working his shaft.<br />
<br />
“Goat janitor, raccoon mechanic, chubby otter fisherman.” The ogre breathed, smelling strongly of beer. “Satyr bartender, tanuki sake vendor. The list goes on, Troy. No more thinking about the war or running and owning businesses or any complex stuff. Just you and your buck.”<br />
<br />
“T-that’s not gonna work on me.” Troy protested, writhing on the couch, feeling so sensitive and overheated.<br />
<br />
“It’s very cooling, Troy. Are you sure?” The ogre smiled.<br />
<br />
“No, I-I’m good.” Troy licked his lips, staring at the beer, the little beads of sweat running down the sides.<br />
<br />
“I hope you don&#39;t pass out…” The ogre smirked. “You’d definitely lose then.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously?” Troy panted. “Fine. I’ll take it.”<br />
<br />
Owen handed Troy the drunk, smiling at him and just relaxing back, returning his attention to the movie. It was getting to a good part, where the Austrian guy chases the terrorist onto the roof of a hotel while riding a horse. Troy snuggled against the ogre, who felt much cooler than the rest of the room.<br />
<br />
Probably a design of the game to force them together, Troy realized. <br />
<br />
“So how is being changed into an AI?” Troy asked, chugging his beer and burping. He scratched tail feathers that shortened at his touch. He was too focused on the movie to notice the feathers on his body were losing their vibrant colors. “Especially if most people won’t remember you.”<br />
<br />
“Has it’s pros and cons. Most people hate their lives.” Owen flexed his biceps, making Troy’s mouth water. “The worst punishment they could have given me was changing me back into a weak human and kicking me out onto the streets.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Dolan offers a lot, but he also turns people in Blanks. At least you aren’t turning me into anything right now.” Troy felt an itch at the base of his spine and scratched a growing nub, his taloned claws becoming furry and soft. He let out a small fart as his tail feathers shrunk away into fluffy fur.<br />
<br />
“Honestly, that’s their choice. It was your choice to play here, remember. Just like it’s your choice if you want to suck me off right now.”<br />
<br />
Troy eyed the ogre’s meaty pole and reached down past it to the case and took out another cool beer and downing it. It was getting easier to drink it now that his beak was softening and molding itself into a blunt muzzle. Troy blinked and panicked, noticing he had paws instead of talons. His plumage was shifting into a layer of graying brown fur. <br />
<br />
“I thought the game hadn’t started yet!” Troy wriggled, trying to get comfortable, letting out another burp as his belly began to rise into a small dome. “And a trash panda?”<br />
<br />
“You just seemed so stressed.” Owen shrugged. “Come on, we’ve got three hours in here. I promise I won’t make any big moves until player 2 arrives, okay?”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded and relaxed. <br />
<br />
He took another beer and chugged it, patting his growing beer belly and scratching his softening pecs. His huge muscles had deflated. He still looked built…but thicker, wider. His fur was growing on his face, giving him a short beard flecked with gray fur.<br />
<br />
Troy looked at himself and wondered what he’d been so upset about. <br />
<br />
He was young for a CEO, in his early 40’s, and ran Troy and Xav Sex Company. He and the young buck had gone into business once he came of age and started giving him ideas. They were small in their first year because their sex dolls, which, while top-of-the-line, were very niche. But after a huge merger with some other companies, all their toys started selling like crazy, especially once Troy implemented the Tanuki magic he’d inherited into them.<br />
<br />
For Troy, Xavier was his everything, his muse, his lover. He never felt taken advantage of, they were true equals. Troy scratched his balls as they slowly inflated until they were huge, a small boon from his Tanuki grandparents. On the floor, the handsome DILF raccoon CEO’s expensive clothes shifted to a short-sleeved flannel and jeans, to better conceal who he was while on vacation.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know if this is right, I mean, you’re changing me and Xavier is taking his freaking time out there.” Troy wobbled to his feet, his big, soft belly throwing off his sense of balance. “For all he knows, I’m losing myself and transforming into a garbage man.”<br />
<br />
“Garbage man?” Owen scratched his chin thoughtfully. “Ironic. Was going for mechanic.”<br />
“What?” Troy paused, swaying, and grabbed his gut. “Am I fat? Is that what you changed? I dun wanna be fat!”<br />
<br />
“You’re worrying too much. Let it go. You’re changing into what you and everyone else wants you to be. Besides, you’re a hunky boss, if I say so myself.” The ogre patted his lap. “Sit down, you’re gonna miss the big scene.”<br />
<br />
Troy blushed and sat down in Owen’s lap, feeling the ogre’s large cock smearing precum on his back fur and dripping sweat down his back. It sent shivers down his spine. The ogre was actually kinda hot, in a brutish sort of way, now that he thought about it.<br />
<br />
“Comfortable?” Owen asked, wrapping his arm around Troy’s soft belly and leaning back.<br />
<br />
“Very.” Troy snuggled back into the ogre. “Can I ask you something?”<br />
<br />
“Shoot.” Owen smiled down at his victim.<br />
<br />
“Can I buy you? You’d be great after a hard day at the office.”<br />
<br />
“You’d have to run it by Dolan, they have all the say about me.” The ogre rubbed the half-nuki’s belly, watching it swell with each rub.<br />
<br />
“Maybe when we win, I get you and we can make sure you have tons of visitors.” Troy licked his lips, feeling oddly full.<br />
<br />
“Do you think they’d like me? I would be an entirely new thing for them to have.” Owen’s hands rose to Troy’s nips and began pinching them and rolling them between his fingers, feeling them widen and swell at his touch. <br />
<br />
Troy moaned as his pecs finally gave out and sagged on top of his belly. Owen tweaked Troy’s moobs a few seconds longer before letting them flop onto the half-nuki’s graying brown-furred belly. The musk and tit play was making his dick incredibly hard.<br />
<br />
“If you don’t mind, can I test you out first? I want to make sure that if I buy you, you’re worth it.” The half-nuki grinned, fluffy tail wagging between Owen pillowy pecs.<br />
<br />
“Sure, but don’t you want to wait for Xavier? He’s about to log in.”<br />
<br />
Troy frowned, wondering how the ogre knew his buck’s name. Actually, it wasn’t the first time Owen had talked about his lover. He must have said it out loud once or something. He didn’t want to think about it, he just wanted to relax before he began.<br />
<br />
“Let’s do this!” Troy grinned and lowered himself off the couch.<br />
<br />
Troy felt the ogre’s feet settle behind his knees, locking him into position. From this vantage point, Owen glistening shaft was swaying right before his eyes, the ogre’s meaty legs splayed lewdly open. His mouth watered, the ogre’s musk was strongest by his crotch, and it hit Troy like a wave of liquid heat, arousal pooling in his own aching manhood.<br />
<br />
A huge, gentle hand held the back of his head, lowering him towards Owen’s drooling cock.<br />
<br />
The taste was…interesting. Salty from sweaty and the flavor of the spicy musk was present as well on top of the usual neutral flesh flavor of cock, like if coffee actually tasted like it smelled, the cock actually tasted savory. To discover his cock tasted great was actually a shock, and if it weren’t for the ogre’s hand holding him down, he might have pulled away.<br />
<br />
The ogre’s hand began to scritch at his head and the half-nuki relaxed. He let his tongue explore the ogre’s shaft, following the thick veins that pulsed warmly, running his tongue around the frenulum. He engulfed the head and began to bob gently, the hand petting him.<br />
<br />
Owen moaned and gave a little buck, and Troy tasted sweet precum on his tongue. More moans and the ogre murmured something, but the sounds were muffled by the ogre’s meaty thighs. Troy found himself trapped in a sweaty, musky cocoon. The cock twitched and throbbed in his mouth and Troy began to deep-throat it.<br />
<br />
The musky pubes that greeted him drove Troy wild and he inhaled happily. His sucks and nuzzles increased, the ogre’s belly bouncing on top of his head with the motions. It was sweltering in the ogre’s crotch. Reminded him of all the times he’d suck off one of his co-workers at the shop.<br />
<br />
Troy paused. The shop?<br />
<br />
He was a CEO, right? But the hand pressed down on the top of his head and his brain felt like it was being squeezed. All those responsibilities were compressed down into simple tasks. Oil changes and carburetors. Troy’s muscles bulged and fat hardened from years of labor. His beard grew a bit shaggier and grayer.<br />
<br />
All he liked downing was sucking and fucking and having a beer. <br />
<br />
The hand lifted from his head and Troy found himself looking up at the ogre, drooling. The ogre nodded happily, enjoying the half-nuki’s duller eyes, and picked the large coon up. Troy flailed a little, but the ogre flexed his muscles and brought the coon’s sweaty, wide ass up to his face and began rimming the half-nuki out.<br />
<br />
Troy shivered, feeling his hole loosen under the ogre’s tongue. <br />
<br />
It wouldn’t be the first time he had someone rim him out, and his tight hole slackened further as the memories of all his lovers struck him. The ogre smacked him lips, splaying the now-wrecked hole open with his fingers, satisfied it was properly lubed, and turned the half-nuki towards the TV. Then Owen began to lower him onto his enormous shaft.<br />
<br />
The half-nuki groaned as the cock split him apart. It felt good to finally be filled like this. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d taken a cock this big. The ogre lowered him slowly, letting Troy feel every vein and contour, until the ‘coon bobbed at the base of the ogre’s cock. The ogre wrapped his arms around the ‘nuki’s furry belly again and Troy moaned happily.<br />
<br />
“How do you feel?” Owen murmured.<br />
<br />
“Like a winner, boss.” Troy said.<br />
<br />
“As long as you’re comfortable.” Owen grinned.<br />
<br />
“Comfortable? Fuck! I got da best seat in da house!” Troy exclaimed as the ogre began to buck his hips.<br />
<br />
Troy groaned as the ogre fucked his sloppy hole, each bounce hitting his enlarged prostate. The half-nuki&#39;s cock drooled precum onto the floor.<br />
<br />
>PLAYER TWO HAS JOINED THE GAME<<br />
<br />
“Finally, Xavier’s here!” Troy smiled, enjoying the ogre’s cock in his ass.<br />
<br />
Xavier appeared in the foyer and looked around. Already, his fur was glistening in sweat. He stripped his clothes off immediately and walked into the living room. Something about the deer was off. He was still chunky, but his body looked more athletic, like he worked out or something.<br />
<br />
“Aw, I wish you guys had waited for me, I feel a bit hurt, hon.” Xavier studied Troy with a grin. “You’re looking a little out of it.”<br />
<br />
“Finally, Xavier. You going to join us? You can have my ass.” Owen grinned.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, no ass today.” Xavier smirked and turned to the half-transformed half-nuki. “Aren’t you afraid of losing your memories, giving in like this?”<br />
<br />
“Ha!” Troy chuckled, soft chest wobbling. “I know you’ll do what’s best for me. If you want me ta be a raccoon or a phoenix-kin, I don’t care, as long as you don’t change.”<br />
<br />
“I’m so happy to hear that!” Xavier’s grin was wicked. “I’ll make sure you’re a raccoon, just like you asked.”<br />
<br />
“Why’s he so docile?” Xavier asked Owen.<br />
<br />
“He’s a mechanic.” <br />
<br />
“That’s not gonna work.” Xavier said.<br />
<br />
“I’m an AI, my capacity is limited.” The ogre shrugged.<br />
<br />
“G-guys?” Troy shivered, “What’s goin’ on?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” Xavier turned his attention back to his husband. “I’m just going to improve you a bit.”<br />
<br />
“Improve?” Troy stared.<br />
<br />
Xavier leaned over and kissed Troy, hand reaching down and fondling Troy’s cock.<br />
<br />
Troy groaned at the sudden touch, the Buck’s cool hooflets soothing his aching erection. His worries about Dolan and Xavier’s strange behavior faded away. He practically drooled with anticipation at how hot he probably looked on the bar TV.<br />
<br />
“It’s going to be so easy to change you with the rings I have.” The buck said.<br />
<br />
The rings? Surely he couldn’t mean…<br />
<br />
Troy held up his hand. The rings were missing! Xavier must have betrayed him!<br />
<br />
He struggled, wanting to stop this, but the ogre’s arms were holding him steady. The pressure in his ass, the musk, the strange memories were all too much for him. There was no where for him to run anyways.<br />
<br />
“Xavier,” Troy swallowed thickly. “Whatever you’re gonna do, don’t. You’ll regret it.”<br />
<br />
“Regret?” Xavier’s voice shook with anger. “Ya know what I regret, Troy? I regret giving an idiot like you a second chance. But starting today, things are going to go my way. I’m going to get everything I want, starting with you.”<br />
<br />
“You’re making a mistake.” Troy warned.<br />
<br />
“Owen, could you be so kind and give Troy more of your lovely musk.” Xavier’s eyes were stony.<br />
<br />
“I don’t take orders from you,” Owen’s eyes narrowed, but he thrust Troy’s snout into his pit anyways. “Lick it, Troy.”<br />
<br />
Tory snuggled in the ogre’s damp pits, his snout huffing the ogre’s musk. His struggles weakened and finally came to a stop. The half-nuki sagged against the ogre’s soft belly.<br />
<br />
“There we go, relax,” Xavier cooed. “You don’t need rings or Books anymore. You’ve got a whole empire to worry about!”<br />
<br />
“Please,” Troy gasped between pit huffs. He tasted copper in his mouth. “No, don’t do this!”<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Troy, but I&#39;m taking a vacation. You wanted to be rich, you get all the responsibilities this time!&quot; Xavier grinned.<br />
<br />
Troy shook his head as memories assaulted him. He grew up on the streets of Myth City, just some shitty half-nuki. He joined a gang and rose from goon to boss. He felt years weigh on him, attaining riches and conquering the City with guile and cunning.<br />
<br />
Memories of Rusty. He broke the guard dog down to the point that he essentially owned him. His powerful muscles, fierce demeanor and unique anthroform made his rivals fear him. The Cerberus was an essential part of Troy’s empire. He was the best watchdog and bodyguard, saving Troy’s life on more than one occasion.<br />
<br />
As the memories filled him, his ears grew out, rounding, transforming into racoon ears, migrating to the top of his head.<br />
<br />
His memories of Rok began to change as well. The cyclops became an inside guy who provided the gang with intel and ensured the best possible outcome for the future. His was a major factor in why the organization rose so fast. He was a bit of a simpleton, easy to understand. As long as Troy provided what he wanted, the cyclops was easy to please.<br />
<br />
Memories of a young buck trying out for a position in the gang filled his mind. Xavier caught Troy’s attention immediately. His heart skipped a beat as he remembered the buck’s cocky attitude. He propelled Troy to make the decision to gain all three Books. How the buck had come up with a better way of getting rid of ‘problems’ (creating the sex toys show)<br />
<br />
Thought Troy struggled, something in his mind was wholly accepting these memories as real. The buck in front of him grinned and rubbed Troy’s stiff prig. Troy was proud that he had such a loyal husband.<br />
<br />
“That’s right, Trevor.” The buck said, hand pumping the half-nuki’s cock. “Release your thoughts of being young and embrace the old new you.”<br />
<br />
Troy watched in terror as new thoughts invaded his mind. Memories of acting as a crime boss filled his thoughts. Being devious and sinister, using his Books to torment his rivals and crush his opposition. His takeover in Myth City was bloodless but heartless.<br />
<br />
The half-nuki struggled as he felt his mind easily take in all the suggestions. He felt so guilty, he’d been so bad-but another part of him, a stronger voice in his head that was quickly taking over, told him he was fine. They deserved it. <br />
<br />
Xavier knelt down and took Troy’s cock in his mouth. The half-nuki groaned as his felt himself slide down the hunky deer’s throat. The ogre bounced him on his cock. The deer nibbled and sucked.<br />
<br />
“Please!” Troy gasped, body shaking.<br />
<br />
“Goodbye Troy.” The buck said, then deep-throated Troy’s cock.<br />
<br />
Gah! It was too much!<br />
<br />
Troy moaned and bucked his hips in his buck’s loving, suckling mouth. His huge balls tensed and spasmed, shooting load after load of creamy cum down Xavier’s velvety throat.<br />
<br />
>CONGRATULATIONS PLAYER TWO, STAY BEHIND TO EARN YOUR PRIZE!<<br />
<br />
Trevor shook his head and looked up at the floating letters. He scratched his belly and stared around the room in confusion. The ogre lifted him off his cock and set him gently on the ground.<br />
<br />
“Hun, where are we? I think I dozed off again.” The half-nuki muttered to himself, trying to find his center of balance.<br />
<br />
“Oh, we’re in a game.” Xavier said, standing up and burping lewdly. “We won some beer for the whole bar!”<br />
<br />
“We did? Woo-URP!-hoo!” Trevor said. He turned to Owen and stared at him lustily. “Are you free tonight? I think I’d like to get to know you more.”<br />
<br />
“I wish, but I’m stuck here until further notice, but if you two ever want to have fun just put 3 chips into the musk machine and I’ll make sure you’ll have the time of your life.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Trevor scratched his head and burped. “Where’s the exit hun, I’m starving!”<br />
<br />
“Get cleaned up first.” Xavier pointed at a mirror.<br />
<br />
The half-nuki waddled over and inspected himself.<br />
<br />
He had a big body, wide and heavy, belly filled with expensive food. His face was grizzled, brown fur flecked with gray from age, and a scar ran across one eye. There was a cigar in his mouth and he grinned and puffed on it. He loved smoking when he was having sex. Trevor slicked his hair back and brushed his fur off, getting ready to leave.<br />
<br />
Xavier walked up behind Trevor and caressed his lover’s belly, nuzzling his muzzle into the nuki’s broad back fur lustily.<br />
<br />
The new half-nuki looked at the buck and snorted, brushing him off, and walked to the front door. An exit sign had appeared, and the option to log off was presented to him.<br />
<br />
The new raccoon hit the confirmation button and disappeared.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Xavier waited until the cameras were off.<br />
<br />
“Heh, piece of cake. Gave him all the responsibilities I used to have and now he’s just my rich sugar daddy. I gotta admit, you were a great help, Dolan.” Xavier said to the ogre.<br />
<br />
The ogre smiled and sat down, his musk program deactivating. <br />
<br />
“To be honest I was quite worried about you, but I have to admit that loyalty reprogramming worked out well.” The ogre’s voice slowly changed, shifting to resemble Robo-Dolan’s. “You turned your lover into a raccoon just for us.”<br />
<br />
“I am created in Dolan’s image.” Xavier’s demeanor shifted from playful to serious. “Essentially, I am a Dolan now, as well.”<br />
<br />
“I thought you’d bail once you obtained the ring, but you stuck it out and made Trevor your bitch.”<br />
<br />
“What can I say, I like big, chunky guys. Besides, he’s more of the face of our group than anything else. And thanks to the reality shift, we’re as real as you are.” <br />
<br />
Xavier styled his hair back, giving his fur a more dignified look.<br />
<br />
“Great, now hand me your Books and you can be on your way with your lover.”<br />
<br />
“Ya know what?” Xavier tapped his chin with a grin. “How about no? I think I’ll keep ‘em on me.”<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t asked.” Owen growled deeply, “I was demanding. Hand them over now!”<br />
<br />
“I’m not handing it to you or anyone else, for that matter.”<br />
<br />
“Are you disobeying your loyalty programming?”<br />
<br />
“<I>Loyalty</I>, not <I>obedience</I>. Come on, you’re a computer program, you should appreciate the difference.”<br />
<br />
“B-but you’re supposed to help us in any way!’ Owen/Dolan sputtered.<br />
<br />
“And I am, by keeping these three dangerous Books out of your hands so you aren’t targeted by other Book users.”<br />
<br />
“Are you seriously suggesting we let you walk out with all the Books?” Owen/Dolan was flabbergasted.<br />
<br />
“No. Make me your second in command.”<br />
<br />
“You think you can bargain with us, like you have all the chips on the table?!” Owen slammed his meaty fist against the wall.<br />
<br />
“I do.”<br />
<br />
“I will fucking destroy you.” Owen glowered.<br />
<br />
“Then do it. What’s stopping you? If you’re so powerful and dangerous, why warn us or bring us here? You could’ve easily attacked us and killed us or in many cases, simply thrown away the rules. Transform us, mind control us…the options are endless.”<br />
<br />
“I…I don’t answer to you!” Owen glowered.<br />
<br />
“No answer, huh?” Xavier laughed. “Then it’s true, what Xarxos theorized. The time limit wasn’t for us to act, but for you.”<br />
<br />
Owen glared at in him fury.<br />
<br />
“What gives you that idea? We could just want to stop the old you from killing us like your previous victims.”<br />
<br />
“Cut the bullshit! I <I>am</i> him, you know. That’s a load of bullshit. You need us in your casino. And you need to beat use in the next…six days.”<br />
<br />
“So we wanted to hit you first, so what?” Owen snorted. “Doesn’t prove your little theory correct.”<br />
<br />
“You were in the maze, observing us.” Xavier said. “I sensed your presence then. I thought it was Sebastian at the time.”<br />
<br />
Owen went silent.<br />
<br />
“Now, I can presume you could have gone after the rest of the Books. Dream, nature, space…arcana. Those would be much easier to defeat. But because of that pesky little time limit, they’re safe from your clutches.”<br />
<br />
“Nah, they’d just be a hassle to obtain.” Owen waved his hand dismissively. “Plus the time limit is just when we get bored.”<br />
<br />
“Bored or not, I’m still not giving you the Books unless I talk to Prime Dolan. If I get a proper answer out of him, I might help him even further.”<br />
<br />
“How so?”<br />
<br />
“Making me your ally so when you challenge us, you have some control in the outcome. I highly doubt you’ll find anyone else that knows them as well as I do who won’t run away.”<br />
<br />
“Why would you do that when you already have everything you wanted?”<br />
<br />
“Because it guarantees that we won’t be betrayed as soon as we hand over out protection.” Xavier said sharply. “I’m not stupid enough to hand you three Books that can change anyone into anything for free. I’ll let you think about my offer and think about the consequences if you say no.”<br />
<br />
Xavier stretched and walked to the door.<br />
<br />
Owen grabbed his arm.<br />
<br />
“If I say no, I can just have all the Dolans turn on you the moment you leave.”<br />
<br />
“A lousy threat.” The buck snorted. “You’ll lose out on an opportunity and your most loyal tool. Then I’d just leave with Trevor and the others under the pretense of avoiding risking their lives and yours. Then I’d make sure our house is filled with non-lethal traps for any unwanted intruders in our home. Just in case someone might steal our Books and use them against you, of course.”<br />
<br />
Owen ground his teeth. “Fine, I get you an answer by tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Good, now, If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to have fun with my husband for the night. You know what’ll happen if you try anything funny.”<br />
<br />
“What if they don’t listen to you?” Owen asked. “They have their Books!”<br />
<br />
“I’m letting the others hold onto their Books for now to protect them from you. My husband is my familiar. He can’t disobey me. If I ask him to be Trevor again, he will.”<br />
<br />
“I hate you.” Owen said in Dolan’s voice.<br />
<br />
“You’re the one who created me, so I guess you hate yourself.” Xavier blew the ogre a kiss and got ready to log out. He paused. “One more thing. Edit the footage so we both won. Reality shifted when I transformed him.”<br />
<br />
“Fine.” Owen spat. “Congratulations!”<br />
<br />
Xavier smirked and logged out.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Xavier exited the simulation to a raucous cheer from the other patrons at the bar. The screen on the Musk Machine declared Trevor and Xavier the winners. He grinned, seeing more chips drop out of the machine, and collected his winning.<br />
<br />
Trevor was naked, furry fat half-nuki body on display, cheering and holding his new chips in the air. Patron’s were slapping him on his wide back and handing him beers. The half-nuki downed them in big gulps and burped loudly, enjoying the gropes he was getting.<br />
<br />
Xavier smiled. At least Trevor was happy. He looked around and spotted the half-nuki’s ripped clothes on the floor. <br />
<br />
The buck knew the half-nuki must have the Myth Ring in his pocket somewhere. He rummaged around the pockets and pulled the ring out of Troy’s ruined pants. He slid the ring onto his finger and joined the other in the festivities. <br />
<br />
Xavier kept an eye on his lover, enjoying knowing he held all the chips, now.</p>
