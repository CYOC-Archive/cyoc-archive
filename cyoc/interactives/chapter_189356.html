<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The following morning after Anne had some fun with Paul she decided to ask his family if they were OK with them making a trip to Madame Illusia.<br />
After she got Paul ready and put the saddle on him, they made their way to his family&#39;s house. Once they arrived Mark came to the gate and welcomed them inside.<br />
Paul&#39;s father was there, and so were his two brothers.<br />
Hello, I was wandering if I could go with Paul to madame Illusia in search for business opportunities. You never know if there is money to be made,either out of plowing or out of advertising for Madame Illusia, what Paul chose could be exactly what other people are looking for.<br />
Its not like he has something to do here, there isn&#39;t anything left to plow for him anymore. He needs to exercise his hooves just as much as you guys need to exercise your hands. I feel like I&#39;m the best person to put his body and abilities through their paces and keep him in shape. <br />
His father looked at Paul and asked him.<br />
Do you want to go with her Paul?<br />
Paul&#39;s head nodded at him in response.<br />
Well I guess if he wants to go with you I can&#39;t stop him, at least I can do that to repay his efforts.<br />
Well off you go, you&#39;re burning daylight.<br />
Anne saluted them and hoped on Paul&#39;s back.<br />
As soon as his family waved their goodbyes, Paul started to walk towards his destination.<br />
If I wouldn&#39;t have got you out of that environment you would have stayed around all day not doing anything.<br />
As soon as they were done with plowing the land they didn&#39;t include you in their activities anymore, because you&#39;re different.Your body is a hindrance in day to day activities as I demonstrated last night, you can&#39;t even jack off amongst many other things,however it is a blessing when it comes to outdoor activities and plowing. At least now you&#39;ll get to use your body as it was intended to.<br />
Paul whennied at her remark.<br />
Somebody has to take care of your needs as well, if you&#39;re not using your hooves they&#39;re a hinderence, however when you&#39;re using them for plowing or transport, they&#39;re the best thing for you, so let&#39;s make sure we put them to good use.<br />
As they were traveling along the road, they decided to take a break near a farm. <br />
As it so happened the owner of the farm came home on the acces road that they stopped in front of. She was also on horse back, fact which caught Paul&#39;s eye. <br />
When they got closer Paul noticed that it was an unfamiliar smell, however he started to feel aroused by it. <br />
When the woman got close enough she introduced herself as Georgia, owner of this fine establishment. <br />
She eyed Paul for a second and told Anne. <br />
Fine stallion you have there, think I can borrow him for one of my mares? <br />
Anne didn&#39;t know what to say but she saw Paul looking at the mare while getting hard, so she did the obvious and accepted on his behalf.<br />
When they got to the farm Anne took Paul&#39;s saddle off and looked at Georgia who was preparing a a large hose with a transparent suction cup at the end. <br />
Well, I first have to top up my supply of horse semen. <br />
Anne looked with a grinn at Paul who was looking at the hose and said: Sure, that won&#39;t be a problem as long as you bump up the price, that is no longer one animal, there are potentially 10 or more. <br />
Is 500 dollars enough? <br />
Yeah, sure that is more like it! <br />
She started strapping the hose to Paul who  was already getting hard at the fact that Anne was profiting off of jacking him off. <br />
Paul was starting to understand Anne&#39;s strategy and he liked it. Georgia was the first person who only saw his as what he truly was and what he could offer her, in this case, what he had in between his legs. <br />
As Paul was thinking about Anne and the device, Georgia turned it on and he started immediately to feel horny. <br />
It started to pull a vacuum something which drove Paul insane. <br />
After a few minutes of him instinctly trying to lift his left hoof up to his navel to relieve himself, his release came and he started to lift himself up on his hind legs from time to time during those 2 minutes of bliss in which he couldn&#39;t do anything rather than enjoy. <br />
After he was done Anne received the money from Georgia and she was ready to leave, but as soon as she wanted to head for the gate she saw Paul looking at another mare while getting a hard on.<br />
She went to Georgia and asked her if he could mount that mare as well free of charge. <br />
Well, you&#39;re saving me the time by doing it naturally rather then insemination, plus I&#39;m actually curious if he still has something in him left after the last one. <br />
Other stallions didn&#39;t even want to look at mares for a while but he seems ready to go again, which is really good for you as an entrepreneur(if you know what I mean). <br />
After she said that she opened the gate for Paul and as soon as she did the two horses trotted to one another and in no time she was getting screwed by him. <br />
He looked her down with his hooves and legs  while furiously pumping away. It took longer than normal but after a while the mare was trembling and started squeezing his member for release,but having ejaculated so recently he was able to last much longer. When he did eventually come it was after the mare had more than 5 orgasms. One,more powerful than the other. At the end of this the mare was barely holding herself up on her hooves , indicative of what she had to endure for those 2 minutes in which she received Paul&#39;s seed. <br />
Paul was eventually lead out of the enclosure and was returned to Anne who patted him on his neck and lead him to the main road. <br />
They decided to make camp for the night a bit further away from the road to avoid <br />
having to worry about travellers like them in the night.</p>
