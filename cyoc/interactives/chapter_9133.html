<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power- Dustin and Peter go to Downtown Orlando – by scriptboy<br />
Ideas by wideleg84 and scriptboy<br />
<br />
“I feel kind of bad about leaving Ryan and Ty at home” Peter said, while dribbling his basketball on the street. Peter and Dustin were walking to the park which was down the street from their house, where there was a full size basketball court. Ty had decided that he had enough of seeing Peter and Dustin at home all the time and told them to get out of the house during the rest of the afternoon. Ty would stay with Ryan, and after they had lunch, they would clean the house. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it. They’ll be fine! You don’t need to worry about Ty. He’s used to being the only one at home because he often arrives home before I do” Dustin replied, while walking next to Peter on the sidewalk.<br />
<br />
When the two had finally reached the basketball court, Peter tossed the ball through the hoop, making his first basket. He caught the ball after it came down, and he tossed it to Dustin, who caught it using both hands.<br />
<br />
“Hey, do you remember the first time we came to this court? It was my first day here in Orlando, and you were still busy looking for a job! Do you remember that?” Peter asked Dustin. <br />
<br />
“Yes, I certainly do! I was shocked when you showed us that you also had the same powers as Ty did, and this is where you turned me into a weasel!” Dustin replied, after having made his first basket as well. Peter walked over and got the ball after it had fallen through the hoop.<br />
<br />
“Well Dustin, we’ve come a long way since then! We’re much better friends now! Gosh, that was back over the summer, about four months ago, wasn’t it?” Peter replied. He had attempted another shot, but the ball had bounced off the edge of the rim and it bounced on the court, right in front of Dustin.<br />
<br />
“I have to admit, Peter, that I wasn’t very happy when you came here. I didn’t like you, because you came across as being a very cocky kind of kid. But I noticed later on that you are very mellow and easy going, and that has definitely made a difference in our friendship. You have also influenced Ty a lot, for he has been much nicer to me ever since you arrived here!” Dustin explained, while he tossed the ball back to Peter so he could try his shot once more.<br />
<br />
“Well, I appreciate you letting me stay here with you and Ty. And I’m also very happy that you have allowed Ryan to live with us!” Peter replied, while he made his next basket.<br />
<br />
“I have to be grateful for you as well! You helped me earn a lot of money when you helped me win in the casino by wishing for me to be very lucky! I also won the lottery that day, and that’s how we were able to afford our house. You’ve helped me out a lot, Peter! You’re welcome to stay here as long as you want!” Dustin said, while getting the ball off the court.<br />
<br />
Peter and Dustin made a few more baskets on the court, and they decided to walk to the downtown section of the city where all the shops and small businesses were. Since Dustin lived in a suburb just outside of the city area, they didn’t always come to the downtown part. But Peter was happy that Dustin was willing to hang out with him, and the two walked into the busy section of the city.<br />
<br />
As Dustin and Peter were walking along several shops on International Drive, they walked by a couple of teenagers who were dressed in punk clothing. They wore leather jackets and boots. They had numerous chains hanging from their leather pants, boots, and black leather jacket, and they both wore large, round earrings. Peter could tell that one was a male and the other was female, although they looked a lot alike. He saw the difference by looking at their faces and their bodies, and one wore more makeup than the other. He wanted to find out where the nearest movie theatre was, so he walked up to the two teens and asked them. <br />
<br />
“Excuse me, could you please tell me where the nearest movie theatre is? And can you tell me how to get there?” he asked the teens, who were sitting on a public bench on the sidewalk, which was located on a very busy street corner, and it was right in front of a small shopping mall. One of the teens just nodded her head and whispered “Sorry”.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Peter. Let’s ask somebody else” Dustin said, as he began to walk away. Dustin began to feel a little uncomfortable about talking to a pair of punk rockers, and he realized that the two teens didn’t seem too interested to talk to them. They were standing in front of a clothing store which had a large display case, with many mannequins in it. Peter took one step and suddenly stopped.<br />
<br />
“Wait a minute, Dustin. I have an idea!” Peter said. Peter walked towards the side of the clothing store, where there was another display case which had mannequins standing in it. Behind the mannequins there was a large mirror, and Peter walked up to the large window and stood where he could see his reflection in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Dustin noticed that Peter walked towards the side of the building and decided to follow him. He had to walk right past the two teenage punk rockers, who suddenly became curious to why the kid wanted to walk around the side of the building in the first place.<br />
The two teens quietly followed Dustin, without being noticed. They saw Peter standing in front of the window, just as Dustin walked right up to him and stood next to him, but on his other side. The two teens had a clear view of Peter, but Peter hadn’t noticed that he was being watched.<br />
<br />
“Hey Dustin,” Peter began, while admiring himself in the mirror, “I wonder what it would be like to be dressed up like those two teens who we just saw out in front?” <br />
<br />
“Why do you say that?” Dustin asked him. He didn’t quite realize yet what Peter had in mind. <br />
<br />
“Imagine how I would look if I were a punk rocker! I bet those two teens would talk to me for sure! Watch this!” Peter said to Dustin, as he began to concentrate on his own body while looking at his reflection in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Peter’s shorts slowly grew longer and transformed into black, leather pants, that stretched all the way to his ankles and fit snug around his legs. Then his basketball shoes turned into long, black leather boots, which covered part of his pants from the knees on down. His basketball jersey suddenly turned to black leather as well, and the jacket grew long, leather sleeves which came up to Peter’s wrists. Several metal chains appeared which were hanging from small hooks on his boots, his pants, and his leather jacket! Then Peter allowed his body to grow a little bigger, more muscular, and taller as well. He grew from 6 foot 1 to 6 foot 4, and his leather jacket looked a little tight as it suddenly filled up by his expanding pectorals, his biceps and his shoulders. His quads grew bigger and wider, to the point where his black leather pants looked like they were fit tight around his thick, muscular legs. Peter looked over and realized that he was now a few inches taller than Dustin, and he showed a big grin on his face, while Dustin stood next to him, staring at him with his eyes bugging out of his face and his jaw wide open out of being completely astonished by Peter’s abrupt transformation. <br />
<br />
Peter looked at himself in the mirror once more, and this time his short, brown hair began to fall off his head! He was slowly becoming nearly bald, except for a thin row of hair that ran from his forehead to the back of his head, right through the center of his scalp. The brown hair began to rise up and it began to look like a row of spikes as it grew taller and the color changed from light brown to lime green! Large, round earrings appeared hanging from Peter’s ears, and his lime green Mohawk grew almost four inches tall, standing straight up on the center of his almost bald head!<br />
<br />
“How do I look?” Peter asked, as he turned towards Dustin, who was now looking up to the taller punk rocker who was dressed in black leather. <br />
<br />
“Oh my goodness, Peter! You’re all dressed in black leather! Wow!” Dustin said, while gasping at the site of his foster brother’s cousin, who had transformed himself into a huge punk rocker. “What can I say? You look… stunning!” Dustin concluded, while he walked around Peter twice, admiring his boots and his leather jacket. <br />
<br />
“I can’t believe what I just saw!” one of the teenage punk rockers said, as both of them were just a few feet away from Dustin and Peter. “You completely changed right before our eyes! I have never seen anyone do that before! How did you do that?” the teenage boy asked Peter, as he slowly walked up to him, holding his jaw wide open out of utter amazement and complete shock.<br />
<br />
“Now I look just like you two!” Peter said, with a smile on his face. “By the way, I’m Peter!” he added, extending his hand for a handshake.<br />
<br />
“My name is Kris! And this is my sister, Kate!” the teenage boy said, as he shook Peter’s hand. <br />
<br />
“My name is Dustin” Dustin said, as he shook their hands as well, although he was now feeling a little uncomfortable, since he was the only person who was still dressed in “normal” clothing, since he was now in the company of three punk rockers! Dustin was still wearing his basketball jersey, shorts and shoes.<br />
<br />
“How did you change like that? One moment, you were just wearing basketball clothes! In an instant, you grew taller, you cut your hair, you grew a Mohawk and you changed into leather clothing right before our very eyes!  How did you do that? Kate asked Peter.<br />
<br />
“Well…” Peter began, as he had to ponder what to say. He hated to tell other people about his powers, but he realized that there was no way around it, for Kris and Kate had seen him transform himself without him knowing that he was being watched.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just say, that it was a magic trick!” Peter replied, not knowing what else to say.<br />
<br />
“We’re sorry for not wanting to speak to you when you asked us for directions. We normally get a lot of dirty looks from people because they think we’re weird and so we try not to talk to normal people. But we had no idea that you were able to transform into one of us!” Kate said to Peter.<br />
<br />
“Well, Peter has transformation powers! He can transform himself and anyone else into just about anything he wants to!” Dustin added; feeling tired of hearing Peter as he tried to hide the fact that he had transformation powers.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for spilling the beans, Dustin!” Peter responded, rolling his eyes and feeling a little annoyed over the fact that Dustin just revealed his secret to these two punk rocker teenagers.<br />
<br />
“He’s acting like it’s no big deal to him, but I can imagine that to you it must seem very unusual to see someone change right before your very own eyes!” Dustin added, as he was trying to make Kate and Kris feel a little more at ease.<br />
<br />
“Oh but wait till I change Dustin into a punk rocker!” Peter said out loud, with a huge smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“No, Peter! Come on! Have a heart!” Dustin protested.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Dustin!” Peter pleaded, putting on a sad look on his face. “Please! I’ll change you back later, okay? I’ll change you really fast this time! Just imagine the look on Ty’s face when he sees you! Please, Dustin! Just allow me to change you this time…”<br />
<br />
“Peter, just imagine the look on Ryan’s face when he sees YOU!” Dustin exclaimed out loud. “Alright, use your powers. Let’s get it over with!” Dustin said, giving in to Peter with a sigh. <br />
<br />
Peter stood next to Kris and folded his arms. Kate stood on the other side of Peter, and was looking up to him since Peter was now the tallest person in the group.<br />
<br />
“Watch this, Kris!” he said, feeling happy he could allow Dustin to join the group.<br />
<br />
Dustin’s red basketball shorts suddenly transformed into long, black leather pants, his basketball shoes turned into knee-high black leather boots, and his red jersey became a black, leather jacket with long sleeves, just like Peter’s. Then all his hair began to fall his head, except a thin row of hair which ran right down the middle of his head, from his forehead to the back in one straight line. His hair spiked upwards and turned red, leaving a three inch red Mohawk on top of his head! Dustin turned towards the display window and gasped when he saw his new look in the mirror for the first time.<br />
<br />
“Holy moly!” Dustin said, while he looked at his jacket and his Mohawk in the mirror. <br />
<br />
“Dude, your transformation powers are awesome!” Kris said to Peter, who was standing right next to him and who was smiling as he was admiring his work. <br />
<br />
“What do you say, Kris? Did I do a good job on Dustin?” Peter asked the teenager, who was completely astonished by the way Peter had so easily changed Dustin into a punk rocker in less than a minute.<br />
<br />
“Hey we were looking for a movie theatre! Would you like to join us for a movie?” Peter asked Kris and Kate. “But you’ll need to give us directions because we’re a little lost in this part of town!”<br />
<br />
“Sure, we’ll walk over to the theatre and the four of us can catch a movie together!” Kris said, feeling thrilled to be in the company of two other people who looked just like Kate and him!<br />
<br />
The foursome had a great time, and Kris and Kate had given Peter their address and phone number afterwards. They had invited them over for dinner, but Peter wanted to get back home so he could see how Ty and Ryan were doing. And he was also anxious to show them what they looked like, now that they were dressed as punk rockers!<br />
<br />
“What will Ty and Ryan say when they see us?” Dustin wondered out loud. “Poor Ryan, the kid will suffer a heart attack when he sees you like this!”<br />
<br />
“Are you kidding me? He’ll get jealous and he’ll ask me to give him a Mohawk as well!” Peter responded confidently. “I guess we’ll see their reaction when we get home!” Both Peter and Dustin laughed at the thought of seeing the expressions on Ty and Ryan’s faces when they would get home that evening!</p>
