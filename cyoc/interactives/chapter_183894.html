<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning the two men awoke late. They had cuddled in that position all night, and Tom had awoke with Nate’s raging erection in his hand.<br />
<br />
“Damn. My old hard-on feels even bigger with your smaller hand, Nate,” said Tom, while grinding on his son.<br />
<br />
“Good morning to you too, you old horn dog,” said Nate.<br />
<br />
“I’m not old in this 18 year-old body,” said Tom.<br />
<br />
“This body this only 35, dad. That’s not really old either. Besides, after seeing the sexual stamina, I’m pretty sure that this body is in its prime,” said Nate, looking down at his nine inch erection. <br />
<br />
There was a drop of precum on Nate’s dick from his dad grinding on his ass. Nate wiped it up with a finger and was about to sample it when Tom sucked that finger.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm. I don’t know why I’ve never tried my precum or cum, that was good!”<br />
<br />
“Guess you’ll have to make me breakfast now,” Nate jested.<br />
<br />
Suddenly they heard a car pull up to the driveway. They looked out the window and saw Nate’s mom, Linda. She was home two days early!<br />
<br />
The men scrambled up to get dressed and make themselves look normal. As normal as a father and son in each other’s bodies could look, anyway.<br />
<br />
“What do we do, dad?? I don’t want a wife, let alone my own mother,” said Nate panicked.<br />
<br />
“I don’t either!” Exclaimed Tom before he realized what he was saying.<br />
<br />
“Wait what?” Asked Nate.<br />
<br />
There was no time for the complicated answer, the two had to go downstairs to greet her so Tom only said, “The swap machine password is 4321.”<br />
<br />
They got downstairs and greeted Linda. To their surprise, she was holding a baby. Nate was just glad that meant she wouldn’t be expecting a kiss.<br />
<br />
“You’re home early Li—mom,” said Tom.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, this is Magina’s baby. She asked me to come home and baby sit for the day so that she could clean here house. Oh Tom, won’t it be nice to have a baby in the house like when Nate was born,” she said to Nate.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure it’ll be educational for Nate,” said Nate, “Why don’t you let him hold the baby.”<br />
<br />
They passed the baby while Nate went into the kitchen shadily to grab something.<br />
<br />
Nate came back into the living room and whacked Linda over the head with an iron skillet. Not hard enough to dent, just knock her out.<br />
<br />
“Are you crazy? What are you doing??” Asked Tom.<br />
<br />
Nate explained his plan to Tom and they headed downstairs with Linda and the baby in tote. Nate put Linda in pod one and Tom put the baby in pod two. Presto change-o, their consciousnesses had been swapped. Linda had no ability to talk or control her faculties in the baby’s body, and the baby regained consciousness in Linda’s body but had no knowledge of talking or physical activities like walking.<br />
<br />
“Now all we have to do is return the baby to Magina saying that Linda is having a medical emergency and then we go show a doctor Linda’s body’s intelligence of a one year-old and have her committed to special care,” said Nate, making it sound easy.<br />
<br />
Tom agreed, not wanting to be stuck with a wife when he was just starting to get to know himself. If he thought about it, he was really adding years to Linda’s life by putting her in this baby body. He did feel a little bad when he realized that her new body was a boy. The baby’s name was Horus. She would get used to it as she grew up again.<br />
<br />
Their business went surprisingly smooth, and they had the house to themselves again. Nate contacted a divorce lawyer and explained ‘his’ wife’s complete lack of mental faculties. He started the process of filing for divorce.<br />
<br />
Some time later, Nate was still living in his dad’s body and vice versa. Nate had finalized the divorce. Horus, now Linda, as everyone called ‘her’ was learning how to talk and walk in an adult woman’s body. It was looking like eventually ‘she’ would be person capable of independence. <br />
<br />
It had been a stressful time for Nate and Tom and they hadn’t had sex since the night before Linda had gotten home.<br />
<br />
“Do you wanna fuck?” Asked Tom, “I’m sick of just worrying. Your mom is no longer your wife and nobody suspects a thing.”<br />
<br />
“I’m over it too, let’s get down and dirty, pops,” said Nate, making out with Tom.<br />
<br />
“I wanna bottom for you while you’re still in that body,” said Tom.<br />
<br />
“Damn dad, that’s ambitious,” said Nate, looking down at his huge cock.<br />
<br />
“See, I was thinking we’d trade dicks so that I can be penetrated by this one,” Tom looked down at his own member.<br />
<br />
“If I get to fuck you, I’d settle for a cock even smaller than that,” Nate reassured him.<br />
<br />
Tom went to the control room and remotely switched their cocks and balls.<br />
<br />
“I had forgotten how obscene this junk is in this thinner smaller body,” said Tom, whose hung cock was bulging in his gym shorts.<br />
<br />
“I missed you little buddy,” said Nate, looking down his sweatpants at his three inch penis. It boned up to its five inches and they headed to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
They stripped naked and Nate began to eat Tom’s smooth shapely young butt. Tom moaned as he felt his former face’s stubble tickling his ass and that tongue explore his rim.<br />
<br />
Now it was time to lube up his dad’s hole. Nate did so with ample lube and warmed him up by sticking one finger in at first. He pushed the finger slowly in and out of the tight hole. The stress of the last couple of months combined with not having sex had made Tom very tight. Tom moaned at just the pressure from on finger. Nate moved to two fingers and then it was finally time to fuck Tom.<br />
<br />
Nate put his five inch erection into his dad’s tight hole ever so gently and steadily. Before long they were pumping and making out. Tom was jerking his big ol’ dick while being fucked. Nate would take breaks from making out with him to suck that dick while still inside Tom. The sensations were making Tom lose it. Before long the two erupted in unison, spilling two months worth of pent up seed.<br />
<br />
“Love you dad,” said Nate.<br />
<br />
“Love you too, son,” said Tom, kissing Nate sweetly before he pulled out.</p>
