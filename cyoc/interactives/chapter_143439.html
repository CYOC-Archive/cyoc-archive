<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie sighed as she pulled dinner out of the oven. She was trying a new meatloaf recipe and hoped Kellie and Morgan would like it. Since adopting Morgan while the she was in college Katie had made it a priority to make sure her family was well taken care of, this meant she would work part time while Kellie worked at a law firm. <br />
<br />
While her life wasn&#39;t glamorous she happy and truly content. Katie had graduated with a degree in sports medicine with a minor in business. At first she had tried to work but soon realized how hard it was finding someone to care for Morgan. As a result Katie decided to stay home to be with Morgan while Kellie worked. It wasn&#39;t so bad, Katie had a small clientele she took care of (the most famous of which was her old friend Mike Davis). Best of all she was able to watch Morgan grow up. A knock at the door brought Katie&#39;s attention. &quot;Must be Kellie,&quot; she thought with a smile. &quot;Probably forgot her keys again.&quot; As she opened the door she was surprised to see her little sister Lynne at the door.<br />
<br />
Lynne had anxiously been waiting to talk with her sister. After coming into possession of her magical item Lynne had gained knowledge of only the past but of other timelines as well. While Lynne knew about them she had yet to really understand them. For her the other timelines were like other countries. Places she could visit but something you didn&#39;t go to very often. Now though Lynne knew more information than she wanted and it frightened her. Morgan, her niece and the girl who was like a pesky sister had a dark past. A past where she almost destroyed her entire family. As Katie opened the door Lynne glowered at her older sister. &quot;Katie we need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Katie answered as Lynne pushed her way in. &quot;But what&#39;s this about? Does mom know your here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Lynne sighed. &quot;Just told mom I needed to take a walk. I figured though since your teaching is all magic that I should talk with you. Well not so much talk, more like yell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie gazed curiously at her sister as she began to wonder what she was talking about. &quot;Well get it off chest what&#39;s bothering you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynne paused, this wasn&#39;t going to be easy. She was about to chew out her sister and bad mouth her daughter. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you say anything about Morgan,&quot; she said. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you ever tell me she used to be Morgan LeFay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie palled slightly as her eyes bulged. The secret of Morgans past had been a well kept secret since the day she was reborn as Morgan Carlson. No one spoke of what happened, especially to the kids. That Lynne somehow had this knowledge was greatly distressing. &quot;Who told you,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
Lynne motioned to amulet she wore around her neck before staring at Katie. &quot;This did,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Katie, this is serious. Morgan, my niece, your daughter. She is, was evil. She tried to kill everyone. She tried to take me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No she didnt,&quot; Katie said sternly. &quot;That Morgan, the one you saw in the other timeline. She&#39;s gone. Our Morgan, shes never done anything. Morgans a sweetheart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she?&quot; Lynne asked, narrowing her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes she is,&quot; Katie growled, glaring angrily at Lynne. &quot;You know her. You two grew up together. Morgan is, well..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A geek,&quot; Lynne huffed. &quot;A meek and mild geek. I know but you cant change who or what you are. Shes evil. She was evil for a millennium. You think 14 years can change that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan isn&#39;t evil,&quot; Katie exclaimed, glaring angrily at her sister. &quot;Kellie and I have raised her to be good. To do good. She wouldn&#39;t hurt anyone. And don&#39;t call her a geek, shes sensitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; Lynne huffed, rolling her eyes. &quot;Listen, I&#39;m not exactly thrilled I can remember all this stuff now but I do. I used to be worried the only thing she would do is embarrass me. Now I worry she might kill me, or you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie sighed, she was angry but she could understand where Lynne was coming from. She always worried about Morgans future. She had been the one of the most evil sorceress alive and perhaps the most powerful. Katie and Kellie had tried so hard to raise her well. They were so happy that Morgan had grown into a polite and beautiful young lady but a fear always lurked in the shadows. Could Morgan revert to her old ways?<br />
<br />
&quot;Lynne,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Listen, I know it scares you. It scares me. I&#39;ve lived with all this all of Morgans life. I know how things were supposed to be before she became my daughter. Your just going to have to trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynne was silent as she now turned to leave. She was nervous but was willing to trust her sister for now. &quot;Fine,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;But don&#39;t think I&#39;m not going to watch her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t say anything to her okay,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;Kellie and I are still trying g to figure out how to tell her. Also please, dont treat her like a monster. She really loves you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lynne nodded as she exited the door, brushing past Kellie as she entered the home. &quot;Hey hon,&quot; Kellie said happily. &quot;Dinner smells great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Listen can you call Morgan. Its ready.&quot; Kellie smiled and nodded, yelling for their daughter to come to dinner. Katie now needed to decide if tonight would be the night they finally revealed Morgans past.</p>
