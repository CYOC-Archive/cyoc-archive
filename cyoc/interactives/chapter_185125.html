<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;.....Anyone&quot; answered Matthew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone? That&#39;s unusual. Did you come here on your own?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I though I&#39;d check the place out&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t get too many people come here alone. Usually you bring a partner&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People are generally reluctant to swap with strangers&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it might be exciting&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No doubt. I guess most people are a bit risk averse&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why what are the risks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That the other person doesn&#39;t want to swap back. It&#39;s happened&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why wouldn&#39;t you swap back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you thought you got the better of the deal. Why would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because..... Well it&#39;s the right thing to do&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure you belong here Matthew. You sound a bit naive. There are some people for whom &#39;Doing the right thing&#39; doesn&#39;t register&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Could you ask around? Do you know if anyone else here might be interested?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll ask around. But don&#39;t get your hopes up. How about a drink while you are waiting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um.. I suppose. Maybe just a normal Scotch&quot; Matthew couldn&#39;t hide his disappointment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheer up. You never know, someone might walk in. What&#39;s your name by the way?&quot; The waitress asked as she made his drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matthew&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First time here for you is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew paid for his drink. While the waitress moved down to the other end of the bar where a middle aged couple were waiting to order.<br />
<br />
Matthew took the opportunity to look around the room. He could see what the waitress had meant. He was the only patron alone. Everyone else seemed to have at least one companion. Maybe he should head home and see if he could talk one of his room mates to return with him. He had never told the people he shared with about his fetishes. What if they said no? That would be a bit embarrassing. Surely there must be someone else like himself. He decided he would wait. Maybe the waitress would find him someone to swap with.<br />
<br />
He watched as the middle aged couple at the bar were delivered some fancy looking cocktails. The man was served a pink drink and the woman a blue one. It looked like the waitress was explaining to them what they had to do. Matthew moved down the bar so he could hear what she was saying. &quot;Once you finish the drinks you have about 10 minutes to select your changes. To swap back you will have to buy another drink but you won&#39;t be able to do that for 3 hours&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens if we want to swap back earlier?&quot; the woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t work. You need to metabolise the fluid out of your system before any other magic will work. The dose I mixed for you is enough for 3 hours give or take 10 minutes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do we chose what to swap?&quot; the man asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You touch. Once you have finished the drink your fingers will literally buzz. That&#39;s when you have about 10 minutes to touch what you want to swap. Touch her breasts and they become yours. Touch her hair and it becomes yours. The changes takes about a minute. Our only stipulation is that if you want to change clothes you use one of the private rooms. We are not allowed to have nudity in the public areas&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I lose my girls do I&quot; asked the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes whatever he gets you lose. You get his equivalent&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And can I touch him and get parts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry not this time. Only the person who has had the pink drink can make selections. The blue drink just makes you the recipient&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And how long before we revert?&quot; the man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t. Any changes are permanent. That is until you have another drink&quot; The waitress looked across at Matthew aware that he had been listening. &quot;That&#39;s why it&#39;s important that you do this with someone you trust&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Julie do you still want to do this? Would you prefer the pink drink&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s your birthday George. I told you anything goes&quot; She picked up the blue drink and in about 3 gulps had emptied the glass. <br />
<br />
George picked up the pink drink and swished it around. He then downed the contents in one big swallow.<br />
<br />
The bartender moved to the other end of the bar to serve some other customers but Matthew stayed to watch the couple. <br />
<br />
After about a minute, the man, George said. &quot;My fingers are buzzing&quot; <br />
<br />
The woman said &quot;Well don&#39;t just sit there! Touch me!&quot; she sounded very excited.<br />
<br />
George reached over and clasped her hand. He then withdrew it and held it in front of himself. Matthew watched in amazement as his hand literally shrank. His fingers became feminine and his nails acquired the red polish Julie had previously sported. &quot;It works!&quot; he exclaimed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on George touch me again&quot; gasped Julie. She was looking at her oversized masculine hand. &quot;Is that hand still buzzing? You only have 10 minutes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what do you want? Make your selections&quot; Julie told him<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well perhaps our friend here can make some suggestions&quot; Matthew realised she was talking to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to intrude&quot; Matthew was embarrassed that he had been caught being a voyeur.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I mean it&quot; the woman smiled at Matthew. &quot;Make some suggestions to George. It&#39;s his birthday present from me and he is wasting time. He has never been quick to make decisions&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Why don&#39;t you touch her face. Then you would have your wife&#39;s face on your own body&quot; Matthew had noticed a wedding ring on the swapped hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great idea&quot; suggested Julie She took the initiative and grabbed Georges feminine hand and pulled it to her face. &quot;Feel me all over. My hair as well&quot; she suggested <br />
<br />
George was looked very nervous but he rubbed his hands all around Julies head. Matthew watched fascinated as they literally exchanged faces. Soon George sported what had been Julie&#39;s face. He also gained her blond shoulder length haircut. &#39;Wow!&quot; Julie exclaimed looking at George. He had also gained her make-up. &quot;You even have my earrings&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You should touch her throat&quot; suggested Matthew. &#39;That way you might swap voices&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you happy to do that Julie?&quot; George asked. He still had his deep voice which seemed weird coming out of his female face.<br />
<br />
&quot;God Yes. I want to swap everything!&quot;<br />
<br />
He reached over and massaged her throat. &quot;Did it..... It worked!&quot; George said in his now sexy contralto.<br />
<br />
The bartender spoke up. Matthew had not noticed her return. &quot;If you want to go further I suggest you move to a room&quot; She was holding out a key. &quot;Complimentary. For 10 minutes. No sex though please. There are rooms available in the hotel next door&quot;<br />
<br />
It was Julie who accepted the key. She turned to George. &quot;Come on beautiful we only have a few minutes left&quot; She led him to some doors at the rear of the bar. Matthew watched them enter a room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think they will go all the way?&quot; he asked the bartender.<br />
<br />
&quot;They usually do if they are a couple&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any luck finding anyone I could swap with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry bud no takers. Though there is one possibility&quot;</p>
