<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the middle of the night, a few minutes close to midnight, and it was colder than a witch&#39;s tit. Well, it was colder than Charlotte&#39;s tits that is. With it being bigger and heavier than Charlotte, she was glad to be rid of them. And standing behind her and her twin towers was Nancy, with her hands on her computer in case there were any problems. Then, a little faint but still audible, Charlotte&#39;s Grandfather Clock awakens inside the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s to you being able to go back inside the house,&quot; Nancy said hopefully. &quot;Here&#39;s to me being able to have something to wear,&quot; clarified Charlotte while she stared at the mountains that are her breasts. At first, it appeared that nothing had changed. There was no visible size lost, no weight seemed to vanish, not even anything that could result in Charlotte becoming her normal self. At least, nothing at first.<br />
With the two girls focusing on the car-size breasts with the hubcaps as the nipples, none of them saw what was happening underneath the breasts. There, a little below the point where the girl ended and the titanic tits began, a slight growth began to form.<br />
<br />
The growth that grew out of Charlotte&#39;s torso isn&#39;t firm like what one would find in a patient with cancer. No, this growth is a little more fatty and a lot more stranger than a regular cancer cell. Instead, it just filled up with more of the squishy content and developed another growth on top of it. This newest addition started to darken and gain some textures, almost looking like a mole or a pimple.<br />
With the two extensions growing out under everyone&#39;s noses (or in Charlotte&#39;s case, under her titties), another development appears right next to the first one. Just like the first lump, the second one started being fatty instead of firm and gained a small, dark detail right on the end of it. But unlike the first one, this bump grew faster. Almost as if it was trying to catch up with the first one.<br />
<br />
Still unaware that she is changing right now, Charlotte asked Nancy what is she transforming into. &quot;Give me a second, Charlotte.&quot; Charlotte could hear the tip-taps behind her as she pushed on her breast. &quot;Okay, I got it, Charlotte. Your change is...&quot; The constant tapping has stopped, which led Charlotte to wonder what had happened to her friend. Or more importantly, what is she transforming into that may cause the hesitation.<br />
Nancy meanwhile was surprised, to say the least. While it was something that Charlotte had gone through, twice even at that, this one has cranked it up to eleven. Still speechless at what was happening to Charlotte, Nancy looked back at the woman in question and stared closely at her body. And sure enough, square on her back, is another swelling with the same minor dark mark on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Nancy! Are you still there? What am I turning into?&quot; Charlotte called out to get Nancy&#39;s attention. But the poor girl is still stunned, with not even a noise to let her friend know what is happening to her body. Now getting slightly worried at what was going on here, Charlotte tried to get out of her seat to see what was wrong with Nancy. The keyword is tried to get out of her seat since her tits still haven&#39;t changed much on top of the new changes.<br />
But while Charlotte struggled to get up, she felt not only the two main masses on her front that were holding her down but also some minor masses below them and elsewhere on her body. With only her hands as her guide under her greatest feature, Charlotte felt the two initial growths that were a mere handful. But as she kept feeling those bumps, Charlotte swore that they felt like her breasts but lower on her body. Lower and getting bigger the more she handles them.<br />
<br />
&quot;NANCY! WHAT IS HAPPENING?!&quot; cried out Charlotte as she kept finding more and more of these breasts-like growths on her body. The shout snapped Nancy out of the stupor that she had caused herself. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Charlotte. For some reason, when I saw what you were transforming into, I just panicked.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re panicked. I&#39;M THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE PANICKING!! So tell me, Nancy.&quot; Charlotte yelps at Nancy before saying the next words extra slowly for emphasis, &quot;What. The. Fuck. Is. Happening. To. Me!&quot;<br />
Even standing behind her friend, Nancy could feel the ire emanating from Charlotte. &quot;Well, what is happening to you is that you are gaining multiple breasts on your body. Remember when you were a cat girl at the beginning of the challenge?&quot; Charlotte, satisfied to know what is going on and yet still worried about what this change may have in store for her, remembers what Nancy was talking about. &quot;Yeah. What about that... Oh yeah! That transformation has those little nipples below my pairs. But if that is the case, why are there breasts growing on my back and below my arms?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nancy, pulled out her phone and tapped it a few times before handing it to Charlotte, said, &quot;Not only there are multi-breast transformations that are in a row or just an extra boob between the original pairs, bet there are ones where the entire body, like yours, are covered with breasts.&quot; Charlotte took the phone from Nancy&#39;s hand and saw photos and illustrations of various girls and women with their heads surrounded by their breasts. Now realizing the reason why Nancy was silent for so long, Charlotte looked back at her body which was slowly getting buried under all of these breasts.<br />
&quot;At least your original pairs are shrinking now,&quot; Nancy said with the hope of placating the fearful Charlotte. As luck would have it, the mammoth breasts were finally shrinking. But as those breasts shrink, more breasts rise out from another part of her body and grow to match the size of the rest of the breasts. By the time the transformation has ended, Charlotte, like the girls in the phone, is stuck in the middle of a pile of her boobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that this is one of the worst options that the nanomachines would pick, bar none. Can you come over here and help me out?&quot; Charlotte gripped the armrest with one of her arms to try to get up from her seat for the second time while waving her other arm to get her friend to help her up. &quot;Oh yeah, of course, Charlotte. On the count of three, I will pull you up, okay?&quot; Charlotte nodded her head, the motion of which affected all of the breasts below her. &quot;One. Two. Threeeee!&quot; And with that, Charlotte is verticle from the ground.<br />
A quick turn around shows that Charlotte&#39;s torso is completely covered with breasts, with only her head and her limbs sticking out to tell which side is her front or back. &quot;Thank you for getting me out of that chair, Nancy. Now let&#39;s go back indoors, it&#39;s cold and I want to go to bed.&quot; Charlotte leads the way to the glass door with Nancy following right behind her.</p>
