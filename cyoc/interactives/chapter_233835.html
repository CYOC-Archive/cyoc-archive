<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Norman reached his little sister Janine´s room and had luck because she was in it. Most of her time, she took whatever she wanted to do somewhere else, be it the kitchen or the gar-den. Only to leave her things there later, making the whole house a mess sometimes. She could be seen drawing and coloring at her desk, which explained why she was here. Last time she had done that in the living room, it had left colored stains on the carpet, and she had been grounded for a week for the first time. She wouldn´t risk a repeat of that.<br />
Like with their brother´s room, Norman walked in and closed the door, only using his strong tail for it now. He loved the feeling of it moving behind him, how strong and agile it was, and how useful it could be. Most of all, thought, he liked knowing that it was his brother before, now nothing but his body part. And soon, his sister would join that fate.<br />
Janine heard her door close with a thud, and as she had been absorbed by her coloring, jumped in surprise. As she had no open window, only one of her brothers could have slammed the door to scare her. Already planning to take revenge, she turned around… only to freeze. There stood a young teen, somehow looking like her brother Norman, only older. He seemed big to her, but what stood out were three things. First off, the teen was com-pletely naked, nothing to hide his privates. The was the second thing, the teen was huge there as well. Lastly, and as shockingly as the first point was the tail swishing behind him. How could a human have a tail, that wasn´t a costume? “Who are you?” she asked quietly. “Why are you naked in my room, and why do you have a tail?”<br />
Norman grinned at her. “You don´t recognize your own brother? I´m naked because clothes are restricting me, most so with my tail.” He ignored the last question for now. He instead activated his hypnotic power, and Janine, still looking at him, soon couldn´t help but stare at the eyes of the stranger. Without a choice, Janine went under like their brother had before. “Now, Janine, when you wake again, you will do as I order you to do, without hesitation. While you´re aware, you can´t be louder than normal talking volume.”<br />
After Janine nodded, Norman woke her up. Maybe two seconds later, she asked him again: “How do you have a tail, Norman? And how are you so big and old now? What happened?”<br />
A few more questions would have followed, if Norman had let her. Instead, he interrupted her: “Janine, calm down, no more questions. They aren´t important right now.” He grinned as her mouth snapped shut, nothing to say remained at the moment. “But while you strip naked, I will explain a few things.”<br />
Norman didn´t watch Janine undressing herself, not that he had never seen her naked. Be-fore he took Adrian years to himself, they had been only a year apart, she would have turned nine in two months. At least when they had been younger, there had been no problems to either being naked around each other.<br />
Janine didn´t realize she was undressing herself as she starred at him. Somehow, asking anything seemed so unimportant now. Instead, she commented on his order after a few seconds: “I don´t need to do as you say, and I don´t need you seeing me naked, idiot.” By now, she had moved a step forward, leaving behind her already dropped shorts and panties behind.<br />
Norman laughed, still with his back turned. “But I know how you looked before, there hasn´t changed much, right? And nothing to hide, right? I mean, my cock and balls are big and easily seen, but you have nothing there, or am I wrong?” It had just the effect he wanted; he was sure.<br />
Janine grimaced at a sudden pressure building down there. With only her shirt remaining on, which she just then started lifting, she looked down, and screamed. “I´m naked. I did as you asked.” She couldn´t say what she thought, or she would have asked how or why. But as she thought that, it seemed unimportant to know. Without the shirt blocking her hands, she touched her privates, or better said, her empty zone down there and gasped in horror. While she wasn´t old enough to need her pussy, it missing was a shock.<br />
Now Norman turned around, guessing his command was finished, and it was. If you didn´t look Janine in the face, she could be either boy or girl now, her body now mostly neutral. Slightly slender limbs than a boy her age, but that was it. “You see, Janine, I found out I have the power to change things, like I did to you right now. Any command I give to you, you will do. Like the undressing.” As Janine looked up at him in shock, he lightly hit his tail twice. “And that tail? I could have willed me to grow one, but I didn´t. No, this is what re-mains of Adrian, our brother, after I tool part of his age and size for myself. He was even younger than you, if only a little. Also, eight years and so tiny.” Norman laughed at her hor-rified face.<br />
Janine couldn´t believe her brother. That tail he had now should have been their older brother Adrian? Who Norman had stolen first age and size of, then his whole being? “You can´t be serious, Norman. I don´t believe you that´s Adrian. I thought you love your family.”<br />
Norman grinned at her. “It is Adrian, or at least his former body. His mind has left it for a new home. And I love my family, it´s just that I want my siblings close to me, and under my control. These magic powers I got enabled that. Brian won´t leave me either. He will be my favorite little plush toy, along with my siblings “new homes” watching over me.” After laughing like he was mad, he continued her changes: “But I still feel incomplete. I still need my strong wings, allowing me to fly and all, and that´s your part in this, Janine. I will lie down on my chest on your bed, and you will come and kiss me between my shoulder blades. While your head and body will vanish in my back, strengthening my shoulders, your arms will become the base of my wings. And your legs will move up and merge with your arms before they will grow into the strong wings, that they always should have been for me. And after you are finished changing, your mind will move into the dragon plush I have with me, trapped in a lifeless, to you unmovable plush like Adrian´s little mind already is. And just like him, while not residing in your “old” body, you will still be able to lightly use your sens-es from there. Feel it moving, taste and smell the air, see from behind me and hear my sur-roundings. Now, have fun with your new “life”, little sister.”<br />
Janine still didn´t believe it, but as Norman laid down on her bed, her body moved on its own towards him. All she could do now was plead. “Norman please, no. I don´t want to be trapped as a lifeless plush. Or your winds. Please stop … mmppff” As she throws herself onto Norman´s back, kissing her assigned spot, her plea was broken. And as her lips crib-bled and merged to the spot, she finally believed him about Adrian, and started crying. It didn´t help her.<br />
While Janine´s face, then her whole head cribbled and merged to Norman´s back, followed by her body, her limbs rearranged themselves to Norman´s wimps. Her legs moved like she was doing splits, and then further up her sides to her arms, before merging with them, mak-ing them longer and more muscular. Her fingers spread from her hands back onto the limb while growing longer. And as if the skin of her now non-existing legs had to reappear, the membranes between the former fingers felt exactly like that. By now, there was no sign re-maining of her head or body between her limbs turned wings on Norman´s back. Her hair had fallen out as her head had vanished, now nothing but muscles for Norman.<br />
With her body finished, a strong pressure grew on her mind, pushing it towards the center of her former body, right between Norman´s wings. There, hold by his tail, was the dragon plush he had brought with him for her mind to house. As if Adrian helped him pushing her out. A last mental scream as the pressure grew unbearable before her mind switched into the plush, vanishing the pressure instantly. But to her horror, she was now really trapped in the plush.<br />
Norman enjoyed the feeling of his sister merging into him and how strong his new wings felt. The more control he gained over them, the better it felt. When she finished merging and changing, Norman cummed all over her bed, accompanied by a roar sounding wrong for a human, shaking the walls. He had some trouble grabbing the dragon plush with his tail, still quivering from the experience, but after a few tries it was at the right spot, and he expelled Janine´s mind into the toy. Like with Adrian and the raptor plush, the dragon´s eyes glowed for a few seconds, before it again looked as lifeless as before, only inhabited by his sister´s mind now. Not that there was any visible sign of that.<br />
With his wings now fully his, Norman beat them a few times testing how his new muscles worked. Like with the tail, he had gained the knowledge how to move them, but that didn´t include feeling how they worked. And it felt amazing. He couldn´t wait to test them outside, trying out flying. Grinning, Norman took the small dragon plush from the grip of his tail and started to make his way back to his room. “I thank you, little plush, for giving me my wings. I will soon test them, but you need to sit that out.” A minute later the plush sat next to the raptor plush on the shelf. “Don´t run away, you three. Enjoy the company.” With that said, Norman laughed at his joke before heading out of his room, planning on something to drink before testing his wings.<br />
Janine was pleading to be changed back, just like Adrian did next to her. And Brian in the tiger did as well, even when he was unheard in his little backroom. Neither of them could believe what Norman did to them. That wasn´t Norman at all, he couldn´t hurt a fly. But this, this was madness. They could only hope that Norman did change them back, but right now the three of them where just lifeless plush toys, unable to do anything at all.</p>
