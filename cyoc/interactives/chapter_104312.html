<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Getting back into his car, Ryan Connor turned on the radio. Fiddling with the stations, he settled on a state radio show discussing recent global politics and how more entrenched and divided the human world seemed to be becoming. It helped to distract him a little from the situation he and Claire were currently in. Still, his heart was pounding and he noticed that he was shaking slightly as he rested his hands on the steering wheel.<br />
<br />
I’ve done what I can…, he told himself. It’s up to Claire to decide what species of were-creature she wants to become – and I will honor her choice. We’re going to be together, no matter what happens tonight…<br />
<br />
He smiled at the irony of it as he wiped his handkerchief across his damp forehand. As a policeman, he had handled a few nasty situations with rogue and feral were-creatures, but had managed to keep his nerve and his head. Yet here he was, sweating like a teenager on his first date, because he had fallen in love with someone he had only met for the first time a few days ago.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Claire tapped on the car window, snapping Ryan back out of his meandering thoughts. Startled at his inattentiveness, he let her in. When they were both belted up, he started the car and pulled away from the hospital. Glancing at Claire’s lap, Ryan saw the bagged container of pills that her hand was wrapped around.<br />
<br />
“So…,” he began, breaking the awkward silence. “Back to the weretigers’ pride meeting, Claire?”<br />
<br />
“Yes please, Ryan.” Claire’s voice wavered, and he couldn’t read her guarded expression. However, she surprised him when they parked in the lot when she asked him to wait for her.<br />
<br />
“Wait? But won’t you be…? Umm… How long for?” he stammered.<br />
<br />
Claire gave him a nervous smile, and then she squeezed his hand. Her skin still felt warm. “Just… trust me…,” she told him. Then she stepped out and headed for the gathering.<br />
<br />
And so Ryan was left to himself in his car again, his mind madly wondering what was happening. He found himself drumming his fingers and checking his watch as the minutes passed by. Ryan purposely did not look to see what was happening, and he kept his windows shut – but still he could hear the loudest of the voices, (and their growls) of the weretigers from their pavilion and grounds as they played their games, before breaking up to talk in their groups. <br />
<br />
“Alright, Claire. That’s not a problem. I’ll tell the Dean and his family that you won’t be coming back with them…”<br />
<br />
Wasn’t that Bob’s voice…? Ryan asked himself. Now he did turn round to look towards the entrance to the pavilion. He was taken aback to see Claire exiting the building and pausing to take a deep breath. Then she walked calmly back towards the car, and got back in.<br />
<br />
“Uh, hi again…” Ryan announced bashfully.<br />
<br />
“Hi again,” Claire smiled shyly as she nervously ran a hand through the strands of her  slightly-wavy dark hair draped on her shoulder. “I wanted to come back here…to let the Dean and his family know that they didn’t have to take me back to my apartment in the morning. And I also wanted Bob to know…” she paused, and then looked Ryan in the eye. “…that I won’t be requiring his…services after all. It’s only politeness after all – didn’t want him waiting all night.”<br />
<br />
Ryan felt unable to say anything. He felt his heart miss a beat – perhaps a couple of beats. Claire then raised the bag of pills which she had kept with her, and then pulled out the plastic container so that in the light cast by the nearby light in the lot, Ryan could read the label: C.Robertson. Birth control pills (werewolf).<br />
<br />
Werewolf…<br />
<br />
“Oh, Claire… Are you sure?” Ryan asked, feeling his lips beginning to crack a relieved smile.<br />
<br />
She nodded eagerly. “In the hospital, I popped to the girls’ room, thinking of everything we said. I then realised that I was rushing things too much when I was thinking of joining the weretigers. I was taken by their beauty and strength, yes – but deep down that’s not enough. Now I know where my were-loyalties lie. I don’t just want to love and live with you, Ryan – I truly want to be like you, as a fellow werewolf.” Claire giggled. “I guess at heart, I’m more of a dog-person than a cat-person anyway. I realize that I need to love, and be loved in turn. I need to come out of my shell more - and at the same time, to know where I belong. Being part of a werewolf pack – being a…kindred sister to you and Barbara - strikes me as being the right solution. Besides, if I had become a weretiger and we argued, we would’ve been fighting like cat and dog!” She grinned, but then turned sober. “And… And I’ve already taken my first pill.”<br />
<br />
Ryan hugged Claire tightly as she leaned towards him, feeling the tension lift from his shoulders and troubled mind. She felt good, warm. They kissed each other’s cheeks, then their foreheads, and then their mouths. Their tears of relief fell onto each other’s faces, and Ryan licked them away from Claire’s face, making her laugh. Her happiness filled him with joy.<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” Ryan said to her. “So I take it this means Bob’s not too hurt by your change of heart?”<br />
<br />
“He’s really okay with it. And the weretigers seem to think that I’m a very lucky lady to become your werewolf mate. So there are no hard feelings, all round.” Claire grinned at him, showing her teeth. “So, I’m glad you came looking for me. You helped me to finally decide what I choice I needed to make for myself.”<br />
<br />
“We both need to thank Barbara for that. I rang her for some advice,” Ryan admitted.<br />
<br />
Claire gave him a thoughtful look. “Was Barbara…the one who you were making love to in your apartment, when you started getting the hots for me…?”<br />
<br />
“Um… Yes. I initiated her some years back. We weren’t compatible as soul-mates, and so we amicably agreed to part, but now and then…we comfort…each other,” Ryan told Claire. It was time to be honest, he decided. “I’m sorry that I hurt you – it’s just the libido thing we were-creatures have.”<br />
<br />
“Apology accepted. You’ve forgiven. And so is Barbara. But after tonight, she can only have you if…”<br />
<br />
“…If we both agree to share little old me?” Ryan wiggled his eyebrows, making Claire laugh again.<br />
<br />
“Wow… You’ve read my mind! But on matters of that nature, first things first. I want you to initiate me into the werewolf race, Ryan. Please. Tonight. I’ll let you decide where…”<br />
<br />
Ryan muzzled Claire’s jaw and thought about that for a few moments. “Alright then… Let’s head there right now. Fasten your seatbelt!” Pulling back, he started the car, and they pulled away from the weretigers&#39; pride meeting, as the happy couple hit the road.</p>
