<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON LIAM?!”<br />
<br />
Alex’s panic-stricken demeanour was unnerving. He’s usually the one who always stays calm in every situation, so seeing him so hysterical certainly caught me off guard. He snatched the vial from my hand, and studied it closely.<br />
<br />
“What is this? It’s not incense.”<br />
“I…I don’t-“<br />
“Did you get this from the lab?”<br />
“No no no I found it on the ground yesterday.”<br />
“You found it on the ground?”<br />
<br />
He didn’t believe me. Why would he? I sounded like a lunatic. I knew I had no choice, and so I explained everything. Well, everything I knew. I doubt Doug was even listening. I was surprised he wasn’t in a coma or something. I told them about how I found it fell out of Archie’s pocket, and how I knew of it’s effects. Alex handed the bottle to Andy, who stared at it with wide eyes. Once I finished, there was a brief pause. Alex leaned on his bed frame, taking it all in.<br />
<br />
“So it makes you grow?”<br />
“Yeah. A drop of it fell on me last night.”<br />
“I knew you looked different. Why would Archie have this in his pocket?”<br />
“I don’t think he knew it was there. Something weird is happening in that lab.”<br />
“Oh Jesus, what are we gonna do? What if someone comes in? Oh God, we’re all doomed!”<br />
“Andy, just calm down. Here’s what we’re gonna do. You take Doug to the showers and get him cleaned up, whilst me and Liam put the barracks back to normal. We pretend this never happened. Doug hasn’t grown, just horny as fuck, so that’s a plus.”<br />
“But the Lieutenant! He’ll catch us. And 1st Platoon!”<br />
“They won’t catch you if you’re quick. The showers are just down the corridor anyway. If they see you, then just say Doug had an allergic reaction or something.”<br />
“What allergies do you have that causes this?”<br />
“Shut up Liam, it’s the best I can come up with. Now Andy, go.”<br />
“Ok…”<br />
<br />
Alex seemed to have regained his composure. It was weird that he didn’t ask if I was the mole. Either he was sure I wasn’t, or he was sure I was. Andy cautiously approached Doug, as he tried to lift the man to his feet. Doug wrapped his thick, muscular arm around the smaller soldier, and hoisted himself off his bed. His matted chest hair was soaked with his cum, as it trickled down his sweaty body. He was starting to get hard again, as his member slowly hardened. Andy struggled to walk with most of Doug’s weight on his shoulders, but still he managed to get him out of the barracks. His eyes were fixed on his squadmate’s boner the entire time. Alex wasted no time, grabbing an array of cleaning tools and buckets from the trunk by the door.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get to work.”<br />
<br />
We got to work. As Alex scrubbed the floors, I picked up the large collection of Doug’s seed on the door and plopped it into the buckets. I was beginning to get used to it’s overpowering stench. I actually found myself getting turned on by it. Fuck, I needed to jerk off really badly. I could feel my cock was ready to explode. Alex wasn’t helping. His ass in those boxers was such a turn-on. I tried to take my mind off it by starting a conversation. As you know, I hated working in silence.<br />
<br />
“This has been quite the morning.”<br />
“Indeed.”<br />
“I have to admit, now I wanna know what they’re doing in there.”<br />
“After today you’d have to be an idiot not to.”<br />
“I’m not the mole.”<br />
<br />
He paused, before looking up with a half-smile. <br />
<br />
“I never thought you were.”<br />
“Thank God.”<br />
“You’re not smart enough to be one.”<br />
“Fuck off.”<br />
<br />
We both laughed. I doubt Lieutenant Reed would’ve had the same reaction. Once I dumped the last bit of cum into a bucket, we both sat triumphantly on my bed. Alex looked at Doug’s mattress and sighed.<br />
<br />
“We’re gonna need to change those sheets.”<br />
“Or we could just flip it over.”<br />
“So how did it feel? Growing, I mean.”<br />
“Pretty amazing actually. Not as painful as you’d expect.”<br />
“And you only had one drop?”<br />
“It’s pretty potent stuff.”<br />
“Wow…”<br />
“Why? Are you jealous?”<br />
<br />
Alex didn’t respond, instead he began to daydream. I could tell he wanted to grow too. I doubt he was getting used to me being taller than him. I reached into my pocket for the vial, only, something was wrong. <br />
<br />
“Where is it?”<br />
“What?”<br />
“The vial. Do you have it?”<br />
“Shit.”<br />
“What?”<br />
“I gave it to Andy.”<br />
“What?! Why?”<br />
“He said he wanted to have a look at it.”<br />
<br />
Just then, the walls to the barracks began to shake. Heavy footsteps could be heard leading towards the door. Then, Andy rushed in, slamming the door closed behind him. His pyjamas were soaking wet, and his face was redder than ever.<br />
<br />
“It’s Doug! He found the vial in my pocket, I completely forgot I had it, and he just smashed it onto the floor. There were fumes everywhere and, oh God…”<br />
<br />
He clutched his stomach.<br />
<br />
“…I think I got out of there in time.”<br />
“Where’s Doug now?”<br />
“Still there.”<br />
“Well the alarm hasn’t gone off yet so there’s that. We need to hide him. There’s no way I’m letting them take him away on that truck. Come on!”<br />
<br />
Without even thinking about putting on any clothes, Alex sprinted to the door. I followed, holding out my hand to Andy.<br />
<br />
“You guys go, I think I’m gonna lie down…”<br />
<br />
He cupped his balls. I could tell they were growing. Before I left he stopped me. He had a wild look on his face.<br />
<br />
“I need to tell you I…In the Lieutenant’s office…I found-OHHH!”<br />
<br />
The bulge in his pyjamas grew again. He jumped out of his clothes and ran for his bed. There, Andy grabbed his pillow and shoved his rock hard cock into it, with long, piercing moans escaping his mouth. I thought it best to leave him, and so I left the barracks, and caught up with Alex, who stood motionless, looking through the open doorway into the showers. He would only move to avoid the fumes that seeped out. When I caught up with him, I noticed he began to panic again.<br />
<br />
“Doug’s gone.”<br />
“What?!”<br />
“He’s gone!”<br />
“Where did he go?”<br />
“If I knew where he went I’d be there by now! What are we gonna do?!”<br />
“It’s okay, just breathe. He can’t have gone far. Look!”<br />
<br />
I pointed at a trail of feet-shaped puddles of water that lead down the corridor. The puddles grew larger as we followed them. Then, our pulses raced as the alarms blared across the base. Once again, we were blinded by yellow lights. We turned to each other worriedly, before racing around the corner. We dashed through a door frame that was severely broken , as if something large had squeezed through it. There we found the heat of the morning sun wash over our skin. We were in the main yard, and Doug stood hunched over, thrusting his cock into his palms.<br />
<br />
I couldn’t believe it. He was huge! Like an 8ft wall of muscle. Every part of him was drenched with a mixture of shower water and sweat. He didn’t care that he was now surrounded by a somewhat cautious squad donning gas masks and black uniforms. He was too busy trying to cum. He looked like he enjoyed the audience around him. Alex and I instinctively ducked behind a large crate. It was weird that they weren’t moving in, and instead watched Doug from a safe distance.Suddenly, Lieutenant Reed’s voice could be heard shouting from the leader’s walkie-talkie.<br />
<br />
“This is a disaster! Why aren’t you moving in Sergeant!?”<br />
“But Sir, Connor, he-“<br />
“I don’t care if you end up like Private Cummings. I don’t care if Sergeant Hamilton fucks you for the rest of the bloody year, he MUST be detained!”<br />
“Y-yes Sir. It’s just, he’s so big. He’ll be too strong to take him down by force. Perhaps if we reason with him-“<br />
“Oh yes I’m sure he’ll be up for a chat. I don’t care how you do it, but if it isn’t done when I get there you’ll join him, IN THE SAME CELL!”<br />
<br />
The Sergeant gulped as he looked up at Doug, who stared back with lustful eyes. He had to do something, quickly.<br />
<br />
“Privates! Prepare the gas.”<br />
“NO!”<br />
<br />
I was just as shocked as the Sergeant when Alex’s voice boomed across the yard. The Platoon turned to face him, who stood defiantly beside the crate. I huddled even tighter, so as not to be seen.<br />
<br />
“Alex, what the hell are you doing?!”<br />
“It’s fine, they only see me. I’ll get Doug and run back to the barracks. Stay low, I won’t be long.”<br />
“But-“<br />
<br />
He strode towards the circle of soldiers. They weren’t sure why he was mostly naked. I found myself subconsciously rubbing my hardon through my shorts.<br />
<br />
“I can reason with him. He’s my Sergeant, he’ll listen to me.”<br />
“No. It’s dangerous.”<br />
“What have you got to lose? If it doesn’t work out then you can do whatever you want to him.”<br />
“Fine, but don’t get too close. If he grabs you we won’t be able to get you free.”<br />
<br />
And so, still in his boxers and nothing else, Alex puffed his chest out and took a deep breath in. Doug’s eyes widened when he saw his squad-mate slowly approach him. I could see the man’s monster throb in his hands. The yard fell silent as Alex feigned a relaxed tone.<br />
<br />
“Hey Doug. It’s Alex. Listen, whatever’s going on with you, we can help. Just come with me, and everything will be alright, okay?”<br />
<br />
He reached his hand out. Everyone then looked at the 8ft beast for his response. Doug just stood there, still staring. His eyes travelled down the man’s body, resting on the bulge in his boxers. Alex began to feel a little self-conscious as he awkwardly adjusted them. He smiled as the giant slowly reached out his hand as well.<br />
<br />
“That’s it, take my hand. Once this is over I’ll make some of that tea you really like, yeah?”<br />
<br />
Somehow, like a pro negotiator, he actually convinced Doug to stop. He and Doug held hands, as he slowly guided the naked Sergeant back towards his barracks. The Platoon breathed a sigh of relief. However, after taking just a few steps, Doug’s raging hormones kicked into gear, and he pulled Alex into him, pressing the man’s body against his colossal frame. His wet chest hair stuck to Alex’s face, as he frantically struggled to break free. The squad around them jolted, taken completely off guard. I could hear Alex’s voice call out as Doug wrapped his beefy arms around him.<br />
<br />
“Doug! Stop it, let me go! Help! I, ohhhh fuck! You smell so GOOD!”<br />
<br />
I knew it was too late. After his long exhale, he had become completely entranced by the huge man’s chest, as he buried his face between his pecs. He eagerly licked his Sergeant’s sweat, as a tent began to emerge in his boxers. Doug was quick to remove them, and not before long the two naked soldiers were making out in the middle of the yard. I felt both completely helpless and turned on. I suddenly found myself jerking off at the sight of them. It felt so good to finally release. There was nothing I could do, but part of me didn’t want it to stop. It only took a few second before I came, shooting my load all over the crate. I heard the Sergeant in black call out to his squad. <br />
<br />
“Ready the gas! FIRE!”<br />
<br />
Small black tubes were launched towards the centre of the circle, each releasing a large puff of black smoke. Doug and Alex slowly fell to the ground, unconscious. However, their raging hardons still remained, as precum continuously fell down Doug’s shaft. Once the gas dispersed, the Sergeant picked up his walkie talkie.<br />
<br />
“They’re down Sir.”<br />
“They?”<br />
“Yes Sir, he’s infected one of his squad mates Sir.”<br />
“This is ridiculous! We’ve lost too many men today, just get them out of there!”<br />
“But Sir, there are no trucks to take them. None of the ones we’ve sent out have returned.”<br />
“Then get them inside! There’s a holding cell underground.”<br />
“Roger that.”<br />
“And Sergeant Charles.”<br />
“Yes Sir?”<br />
“Meet me in my office later.”<br />
<br />
The Sergeant gulped again, and he commanded his men to lift the giant and regular-sized soldiers towards the research lab. There, a large door slid open, as the squad disappeared into the darkness, leaving nothing behind but a large puddle of precum slowly evaporating under the sun. Now I wasn’t just curious. For the sake of Alex and Doug, I needed to get into the lab, and really find out what they were working on.</p>
