<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rising off their hair, the two grown women continued to stretch their new adult bodies a bit while soft sensual moans escaped their lips. Looking downwards, they couldn’t help but grin as they saw the torn remains of the kiddie bikini bottom that couldn’t handle the widening of their new child-baring hips.<br />
<br />
Even though they were naked, the two of them didn’t feel a hint of shyness. If anything, they never felt more stronger and confident than ever before. The girls with their new adult minds knew they had a killer body, and loved the idea of flaunting it.<br />
<br />
With the afterglow of puberty, the girls still felt a little frisky. Ashley once more clutches her heart-shaped ass, grinning as she felt how firm her ass cheeks were as they filled her palm. Brittany on the other hand cupped her perky large breast, moaning as she gave her nipples a tiny squeeze. <br />
<br />
The two were suddenly interrupted by the sounds of a lawnmower starting up not too far from them, making them jump a bit in shock. Curious, the two adult women made their way towards the fence, using their new statures to peek slightly above the fence that once towered over them not too long ago. Looking across the street, the two women’s grin slowly grew wider as they realized whom the source of the sound belong to. <br />
<br />
17-year-old Jacob Marshall was beginning to mow his lawn. His parents ask him to before they left, telling him to get it done before the sunsets. Even so, Jacob couldn’t help but notice how hot it was today, and with that removed his t-shirt revealing his well-built board chest that came with being on the High-School Varsity Football team.<br />
<br />
The girls still watching couldn’t help but feel a little tingly as they watched the stud Jacob removed his top, slapping his t-shirt like a rag over his shoulder as his young strapping body glisten in the sunlight. The two knew of Jacob beforehand, as kids they both had little childish crushes where they would talk all night about who gets to marry Jacob first during slumber parties. But now as adults, the girls were thinking of things more than just holding hands, and giving little pecks on the cheek.<br />
<br />
The girls giggled as they felt their bodies being to tense up with a sense of yearning, causing them to bite their lips slightly as their thoughts became more risqué. Turning their heads towards each, no words were needed as they gave each other a provocative glare.<br />
<br />
“What about his parents?” cooed Brittney.<br />
<br />
Taking another glace over the fence, Ashley saw the empty parking lot. “Looks like they’ll be gone for a while” she replied as she licked her lips.<br />
<br />
The two girls began to prepare themselves, wrapping their buxom bodies with towels they brought way beforehand. Even though the towels didn’t leave much for the imagination, it was enough to make them seem not obviously naked.<br />
<br />
“What do we do with this?” Brittney asked as she lifted the blue shampoo bottle.<br />
<br />
“Do whatever you want, it’s not like WE need to grow anymore!” Ashley laughed as she turned her head.<br />
<br />
But because of this Ashley didn’t know if Brittney: tossed it over the fence, left it on the ground, or decided to bring it with her.<br />
<br />
With that, the two buxom ladies finally made their way out of the backyard.<br />
<br />
Jacob was in the middle of mowing his lawn. Wiping his forehead as a bead of sweat appears, he couldn’t help but curse the hot summer day. Just then, Jacob couldn’t help but feel like someone was approaching him, turning his head he quickly gaped as he saw two incredible sexy ladies making their way towards him. Of course Jacob had no idea who these girls were, and didn’t recall anyone looking like THAT living in this neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Jacob eyes continued to widen as he saw what they were wearing, along with their wet body and hair. His imagination began to race as the thought that they were actually naked underneath their towels peaked in his mind of just a moment, before he quickly demised that possibilities, because obviously they would be wearing a bikini underneath, right? Even so, Jacob felt himself getting a little hard as he quickly tried to suppress his desires.<br />
<br />
The girls stopped just in front of Jacob, as they looked at him while flashing a perfect smile. Jacob still couldn’t believe the reality of the situation, as his mouth just gaped a bit, forming no words yet.<br />
<br />
Ashley just giggled though, as she pointed towards the running lawnmower. Jacob was so distracted by them approaching him; he completely forgot his lawnmower was still running.<br />
<br />
“S-SORRY!” Jacob yelped as he quickly turned the machine off.<br />
<br />
“Sorry to bother you” Ashley smiled, “but my friend and I here accidentally locked ourselves out of our own home, so we were wondering if you might have a phone we can use to call one of our roommates to help bring another key for us?”<br />
<br />
“Oh! Sure!” Jacob replied as he patted his shorts, realizing they were empty, “drat, I must have left it inside my house. One second I’ll be right back!”<br />
<br />
“Wait!” Ashley called out to Jacob making him stop and turn. “Do you mind if we come in for a bit? Brittney over here is dying to use the bathroom, isn’t that right?”<br />
<br />
Brittney was a little shocked that Ashley put her on the spot like that, but understood it was still just part of the plan, giving her friend a little slap on the arm regardless as she giggled.<br />
<br />
“S-sure, no problem” Jacob gulped at the idea of these two babes entering his home.<br />
<br />
“You sure your parents won’t mind?” Ashley grinned.<br />
<br />
“M-my parents? No they left for work already; they won’t be home until way later.”<br />
<br />
“Prefect…” Ashley smirked, as the three began to enter the house…</p>
