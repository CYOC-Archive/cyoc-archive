<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The hornets really let Chad down. By the end of the season, they had lost every single game meaning that Chad had to spend 13,776 hours as Ryan&#39;s cum. That was all. The rules of the bet meant that the number could not increase. But that still was 574 days which was equal to almost nineteen months. Chad wondered about the bet he made. Had he been set up? Did Ryan spike his drink in order to get him to agree to such a ridiculous bet? How could he prove that?<br />
<br />
Chad offered to spend twenty-four hours a day as cum to get it over with. That would only be about a year and a half lost. But Ryan refused. Ryan did not want Chad in his balls while Ryan slept and missed out on the pleasure. Ryan also did not want Chad in his balls at other times when Ryan would miss out on the pleasure such as while Ryan was working or busy. Only spending time as Ryan&#39;s cum when Ryan wanted meant that Chad&#39;s torture would be spread out over at least thirteen years.<br />
<br />
For the next nine years, Chad would have to figure out how to have a life while being at Ryan&#39;s beck and call. And Ryan didn&#39;t offer any help. He refused to let Chad stay in Ryan&#39;s house so Chad had to rent an apartment to sleep in. This meant that he had to get a job to afford the rent. And Ryan would always want Chad at the best times of the day. Some days, Chad would go to work as soon as he got up and the moment he got off work, he had to be in Ryan&#39;s balls until time to go back to bed. Chad also spent much of his weekends in Ryan&#39;s balls. It was nearly impossible to have a social life or any fun with Ryan taking up all his off time.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, for Ryan, he was wondering how to extend this beyond nine years. Having Chad in his balls was so advantageous, not just because of the sexual pleasure but because of the opportunities. The bet had started during his junior year so in his senior year when he ran for president, before he would make a speech or do some campaign event, he made sure he had Chad in his balls. That&#39;s how he won. He also won homecoming king and Chad had spent the entire prom in Ryan&#39;s balls.<br />
<br />
Then after high school, for every job interview or college entrance interview, Chad would be in his balls. Ryan didn&#39;t have to interview often because having a man in his balls always impressed the interviewer and Ryan got almost everything he interviewed for. Ryan&#39;s fame grew. He became famous for being famous because he wasn&#39;t famous for acting, music or sports but he was constantly being invited on talk shows for interviews and they expected him to have Chad in his balls during the interview.<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s fame made life even worse for Chad because everyone knew that Chad was Ryan&#39;s cum. People even forgot Chad&#39;s name and just referred to him as Cum. Ryan made it worse by making Cum strip naked and show off his body before showing people how he entered Ryan&#39;s cock. Although people generally had to be modest, exceptions were made for human cum and the cocks they went into. Cum had to allow people to examine and inspect him as the cum he was while they congratulated Ryan for having such a load of cum.<br />
<br />
As Ryan became famous, Cum became famous too but in a different way. Ryan could get just about any job he wanted but few people would hire Cum. Cum was only able to get very low level jobs that were often labor intensive. Ryan owned several nice houses but landlords were reluctant to rent to Cum. He could only rent tiny places with no amenities. Cum owned very little.<br />
<br />
Cum tried to complain but no one ever took his side. He even tried suing Ryan but the courts threw the cases out. They all said that Ryan didn&#39;t owe Cum anything but Cum still had a debt to pay to Ryan.<br />
<br />
Cum got no respect. When his coworkers stole his clothes, his boss insisted that he just keep working naked for the rest of his shift. His clothes were later returned to him so he couldn&#39;t sue anyone for theft. Besides, his clothes were cheap and he wouldn&#39;t have gotten much from a lawsuit anyway.<br />
<br />
Cum didn&#39;t have a shower in his apartment but he could shower at work. His coworkers would fuck him sometimes but if he complained, they&#39;d say, &quot;You&#39;re just a puddle of cum. You ain&#39;t human.&quot; Sometimes, Cum would dive into their cocks to stop the rape but only if Cum knew they&#39;d release him in time to be Ryan&#39;s cum or to do anything else he had to do.<br />
<br />
Ryan calculated that Cum&#39;s time would end when Ryan would be about twenty-six. Ryan had been accepted at Harvard Law School which meant he could keep his Cum until after graduation but then what? Would his fame fade away without his Cum in his balls? Would he be able to run for President of the United States at the age of thirty-five without his Cum in his balls?<br />
<br />
As Ryan brought his Cum with him to join a fraternity, Ryan wondered if he could force his Cum into competitions where the loser would get more hours of time as cum added to their debt.</p>
