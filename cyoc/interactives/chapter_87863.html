<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they stood in the barn, Jacob’s thoughts turned to his small penis.  In reality, six inches when flaccid was an impressive size for a human one, but he didn’t know this fact.  Incidentally, he watched his now-human girlfriend running her soft hands over her human body, but not looking all that happy.  <br />
<br />
“Honey?  How about we take a look around where they reside?”  He asked, hoping it would be enough to distract her from her unhappiness for now.  <br />
<br />
“Yeah, that sounds lie a good idea.”  She agreed as they took each others hands and made the short walk from the barn to the house, leaving the Original Mr Perth stuck in very stable that Jacob used to be kept in.  <br />
<br />
Once inside, they noted that it was warmer in here than outside where the rain had recently started as a soft drizzle.  “Just another thing they get away with.”  Jacob noted as they looked around.  <br />
<br />
Inside the kitchen, they could see some of the things they used to prepare their food for themselves, one thing his human mind told him was a refrigerator to keep certain things cool and fresh for longer.  He grabbed some of the apples kept there and handed a few to her as they were quick to consume them, and then the others, along with quite a few other things.  <br />
<br />
They may have gained human bodies, but certain aspects of their old horse lives stuck around like stubborn instinct, which was likely why they’d been so quick to consume all the available food that they could stomach, a natural tactic for defence against leaner times.  <br />
<br />
Moving upstairs, Jacob could see that something was bothering her, and with no wish to see her upset saw the need to ask her, “Dear?  Is there something wrong?”  <br />
<br />
“N-Nothing.  It’s just, that.”  She hesitated, wanting to get the words out right so he’d understand.  “This human ass, it’s so small.”  She pointed to it, not knowing that for a human, it was the right shape and size.  <br />
<br />
“I know the feeling.”  Jacob concurred with an understanding tone.  “This too, is very small.”  He pointed to his penis.  <br />
<br />
“I just, wish, that I could have it back.  The old horse ass that I was proud of.”  She admitted.  <br />
<br />
“I see.”  Jacob replied, rubbing his head past hers tenderly.  “I’ve been thinking about getting my old penis back as well, a real proper one.”  <br />
<br />
“Then, how do we deal with it?”  <br />
<br />
“We’ll find a way.”  He assured her as they turned to enter the original Mr Perth’s bedroom.  <br />
<br />
It was there that they found a set of suitcases set out on the large bed, filled with a range of various clothes that they knew humans wore, even if right now they themselves were completely naked.  <br />
<br />
“I wonder what they were planning?”  She asked with slight confusion in her voice.  <br />
<br />
“I wish I knew.”  Jacob replied, which was exactly the wording that enabled the Ring’s power to activate, sending into his mind the knowledge behind the cases being there.  “Wait, I just found out.”  <br />
<br />
“Really?”  <br />
<br />
“Yes.  Those two were planning on being away from this place for two weeks, leaving today.”  <br />
<br />
“Why?  Why would they?”  <br />
<br />
“To spend time with just each other, and leaving that Kelly to manage us.”  He referred to their “daughter”, and not with the greatest of respect.  <br />
<br />
“So what does that mean?”  She asked curiously.  <br />
<br />
“Let’s see,”  Jacob took a few moments to think things through.  “I wish I knew where they were intending to go, how to get there, and how they planned to get there.”  <br />
<br />
The knowledge entered his mind, and after digesting it, “There’s a cabin some distance from here, deep in the mountains, isolated, that’s where they were going, and were going to drive there.”  <br />
<br />
“So are you saying that we go instead?”  <br />
<br />
“We could, if you wish.  I know the route now, and it will give us plenty of time to ourselves to decide on what we are going to do.”  He added the last part with a smile.  <br />
<br />
“We could, but are there any problems?”  <br />
<br />
“Just one, it&#39;s seven hours driving from where we are, on a good day.  Half on the road, half on dirt track.”  <br />
<br />
“That’s, if we go now, it’ll be late evening by the time we get there.”  <br />
<br />
“True, but we could go there if you want us to, or stay here.”  <br />
<br />
She took a few moments to think it over, weighing up the pros and cons, before announcing, “Let’s go there then.”  <br />
<br />
“As you wish then honey.”  Jacob agreed.  “Now, there’s a few things to be taken care of before we leave.”  <br />
<br />
“What things?”  <br />
<br />
“Well, we need to take care of Mrs Perth at the very least right now, so there’s no problems from there.  Then find something to put on.  And then take the time to think about what you’re wanting back.”  <br />
<br />
“Okay then, oh, that’s right!”  She gasped out with realisation.  “I haven’t even told you my name yet!  It’s Daisy.”  <br />
<br />
“Daisy, huh?  I like that name, Daisy.”  He answered softly.  “Mine is Jacob.”  <br />
<br />
“I like that name too.”  Daisy replied.  “So?  What now?”  <br />
<br />
“Lets see…”  Jacob looked over the cases, sometimes picking something out to look over, the thought of what he had planned for Daisy in his head.  “What about these?”  He produced a pair of denim dungarees that came to just above the waistline at the back, but only halfway up the the pectorals at the front, a black sweater and cream turtleneck sweater with them.  <br />
<br />
“Well these are, well, nice actually.”  Daisy decided as she slipped the cream sweater on, finally having something to cover her nude form with.  <br />
<br />
Though they formed the only two pieces of clothing they had on respectively, it was still enough to keep them covered as they closed up the cases and carried them down the stairs.  By the front door, they left them there as they felt that they could get a bit more food in them now, washing it down with the water and milk.  <br />
<br />
“We can take some of this, right?”  Daisy asked.  <br />
<br />
“I don’t see why not.”  Jacob agreed as bottled water and more apples were put into a small bag.  <br />
<br />
Outside again, the truck (Ford Ranger V8) was open, so loading it was easy enough for them, Daisy putting the bag of food and water by the front passenger seat for them.  She turned to face Jacob, who seemed to be thinking deeply right now.  <br />
<br />
“Dear?  Something up?”  <br />
<br />
“Oh?  Sorry, I was thinking about something important.”  He apologised to her.  <br />
<br />
“About?”  She wished to know.  <br />
<br />
“You said that you desired your old ass back correct?”  <br />
<br />
“Yes, I do.”  <br />
<br />
“And I wish for my old penis back.  But I think I came up with an idea that’s far more exciting.”  <br />
<br />
“Really?  What would that be?”  <br />
<br />
“What if?  We make a slow change back into horses along the way?”  <br />
<br />
“Excuse me?  We just got these human forms, why would you want to throw it away so soon?“  She demanded, not understanding what he was getting at.  <br />
<br />
“Hear me out.”  Jacob answered quickly, hoping he didn’t come across as too forceful.  “We slowly change back along the way, based on distance travelled, but can choose to halt it at the point where we feel most comfortable.”  <br />
<br />
“In other words,”  Daisy started to understand what he meant.  “We make a game of sorts?  Using the drive to decide how much of our old bodies we get back?”  <br />
<br />
“That’s right.”  <br />
<br />
“But.  How can it work?”  <br />
<br />
“I’ve been thinking about that, and I believe that I have the wording sorted, so there won’t be any real problems with it.”  <br />
<br />
“And you would do this?  For me?”  <br />
<br />
“Of course honey.”  He smiled lovingly at her.  “If it makes you happy, I’ll do it.”  <br />
<br />
“Then,”  Daisy needed a while to think about it, what it meant, but her answer was always going to be, “Okay!  Let’s do it!”  She prospect actually excited her.  <br />
<br />
“Then I’ll do it.”  Jacob was ready to start before being cut off.  <br />
<br />
“Hold on!  There’s one more thing.  Mrs Perth.”  <br />
<br />
“Oh, right.”  Jacob replied sheepishly, having managed to overlook that.  <br />
<br />
“Can I have the say in that?”  <br />
<br />
“Of course honey.”  <br />
<br />
“Okay then.  I want her to become a horse the moment she gets here.”  <br />
<br />
“I’ll do exactly that then.  Now, the wishes.”  He made one last check of his wording before he spoke again.  <br />
<br />
“I wish that, once Daisy and myself are in this truck, we will both turn back into the horses that we once were.  This transformation will be governed by the distance between here and our destination, the Cabin in the Mountains.  The closer to the Cabin, the more we become horses.  Our capacity for human speech will remain, and be unaltered from what it currently is, and when Daisy decides that we’ve changed back enough, it will stop.  I will be able to drive this truck no matter what my form is, while the clothes we wear right now will adjust to fit until the one-third point before staying at that shape and size.”  He looked at Daisy when he finished making his long wish.  “Is that to your liking?”  <br />
<br />
“Yes dear, it’s perfect.”  She replied as she held him in a loving embrace.  “Now for, her.”  <br />
<br />
“Of course, I wish that when the Original Mrs Perth arrives, she will turn into a horse the moment she enters this place, however, she will be blissfully unaware of this until after she’s walked into the barn where her husband is.”  <br />
<br />
“Ooh.  That’ll be something.”  Daisy mischievously complimented.  “So is there anything left?”  <br />
<br />
“Just one thing.  I wish I knew how to drive this truck, and that it has more than enough Gas to get us to the Cabin.”  Almost immediately, the knowledge of how to drive became his, and he knew how to use each part of it.  “I believe that’s us ready to go now.”  <br />
<br />
Daisy’s answer was to enter the passenger side, moving the bag on the seat to the footwell as Jacob climbed into the driver’s seat.  Turning on the engine, he shifted it into drive, released the handbrake and it slowly rolled as he turned it to lead them out of the farm and towards the Cabin, a smile growing on his face as he already felt the very first faint tingling sensation at the tips of his still-human ears.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
Several minutes into their long trek, Jacob may have believed that he had covered every avenue to ensure a safe and happy drive for himself and Daisy, but there had been one thing he’d overlooked.  Though neither of them knew it, at least, not now, he’d forgotten to ensure that their intellect would hold as they changed back.  So even as the grey fuzz spread along his more pointed ears, and her nose became larger and wider, they failed to realise that their thoughts were gradually becoming simpler, more primal.  <br />
<br />
“Say?  When is that Mrs Perth going to be there?”  Daisy asked curiously.  <br />
<br />
“Well.  They were going to leave about another hour from now, so it should be very soon.  If not already.”  <br />
<br />
“I see.  Shame we won’t see it happen though.”  <br />
<br />
“I know.  But that’s something we can settle once we get to the Cabin.”  He offered.  <br />
<br />
“I guess, yeah, we can.”  Daisy agreed.  The simplifying intellect still slight at this early stage.</p>
