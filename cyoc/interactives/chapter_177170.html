<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark got the still sobbing Aidan´s attention, before starting the final changes. “Don´t worry, I will let that misery vanish from you. Aidan, you will now start to suck yourself until you came five times, and you will produce enough cum to do so quickly. <br />
The first time you come will change your feet and legs into real dog hind-legs and -paws, while also taking your ability of sitting upright or standing on them alone away from you.<br />
The second time you come it will be your hands and arms that change into dog fore-legs and -paws, along with taking any use of them that isn´t normal to a dog with them, like opening your food cans.<br />
With the third time you come, you will grow a tail and your body up to your neck will change into a dog´s, except your cock and balls. Also, your whole body, including your four legs, will gain their new, black fur-coat.<br />
When you shot your fourth load, your head will change into a dog´s. The mask will stretch into your new muzzle around your muzzle. You will also lose the ability to talk human than.<br />
When you come the fifth and last time, your cock and balls will become that of a dog. And with the last human cum all memories about your changes and your old self will be ejaculated out of your mind, leaving only the dog in it. All your keywords will cease to work then, but you will be intelligent enough and well trained.<br />
You will swallow each load of cum completely, as the information inside your cum is to be burned away by your stomach acid.”<br />
Aidan´s sobs increased again, as he looked in horror at Mark, but couldn´t stop himself from bending his body to suck himself. Being fully aware of his situation, Aidan tried to fight the obedience his body showed to Mark´s last command, but couldn´t stop himself.<br />
Soon, the first load shot down his throat and he whined loudly around his cock as he and Mark watched his feet changing, growing paw pads and claws, while his changing legs shortened and bend to fit a comfortable walk on all fours. But they remained hairless for that change.<br />
Mark watched fascinated by the changes, ignoring Aidan´s tears streaming down his face and his whines around his cock. Instead, Mark moved closer to Aidan and petted his head absently.<br />
A minute later the second load was shot, and Aidan´s whines got even louder as his fingers shortened, turning his hands into paws much similar to his former feet, including paw pads and claws as well. He felt his dexterity leaving him, knowing deep down he would never be able to use them as hands again. His arms also changed, which would make walking on all fours even more natural and comfortable to Aidan.<br />
Another minute of whining around his cock later, Aidan let his third load shot down his throat. A painful yowl escaped him in between his whines as his new tail started to grew out. A loud crack was heard, along with another yowl from Aidan, as his back was changed to keep him down on all fours. <br />
Mark watched Aidan´s new, black fur grow all over his body, quickly covering up every bit of naked skin below his neck. While Aidan still sucked himself, Mark stroked him along his back, enjoying the soft fur his new pet had. But he still returned to petting his head, soon to change next.<br />
And right he was. Maybe two minutes after the third came the fourth load out of Aidan´s cock, and with it the loudest whine Mark had heard so far from Aidan. Before his eyes Aidan´s head stretched, building pressure against the mask, only for it to change into leather straps. They soon covered Aidan´s growing muzzle, his now wet, black nose pushing out. His voice got darker while his mouth stretched, not that he could still speak anything. His ears crawled up his head, while also becoming longer, flatter and floppier on his head. His normal hair shortened to match his growing fur, now covering his whole head. Only his eyes remained their old form and hazel color. But his tears had stopped now.<br />
With his now longer muzzle and tongue, Aidan could suck himself even better than before, and so it took only half a minute to get his fifth load sucked out. Aidan felt his cock shrunk out of his muzzle and into its new sheath as it became a dog cock. He also felt a sucking inside his head, as with his cum his mind and memories got sucked out of him. A last pleading look on his face towards Mark was all that he could do before his eyes dimmed, his old self vanishing from within him, leaving only Mark´s new dog behind.<br />
Mark watched satisfied as Starny surfaced completely, already wagging his tail happily. “Are you excited, Starny? Let me grab your things and then we can go home, okay?”<br />
Starny barked once in agreement, and Mark also knew it meant just that, still able to understand his barks. Mark quickly opened a spare backpack Aidan had on his wardrobe, placing the remaining dog food, the two balls and Aidan´s toys inside. He erased his “Mark rules” comment out of the now changed Starny´s profile before putting the laptop inside the appropriate bag Aidan had for it. Then, petting Starny´s head again, he shouldered both his bag and the backpack, grabbed the laptop bag and the leash before heading out with his dog.<br />
After an hour of walking his new dog, Mark finally reached home with him, and Starny laid down in his new dog bed, quickly falling asleep. Mark placed the bowl for water down and filled it, leaving the food bowl on the counter top. <br />
And all the while Aidan´s old consciousness, bound to his cum, mourned his fate, as well as suffering a painful and slow “death” by being burned away by his own stomach acid.</p>
