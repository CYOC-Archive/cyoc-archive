<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-- Sleeping Drake Inn --<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Vect, you ready?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, one minute Jack,&quot; Vect called as he finished tying his belt. <br />
(You nervous about facing Sara&#39;s brother?) Erress asked.<br />
&quot;No, more worried about what she&#39;ll think of me once I straighten him out,&quot; Vect replied.<br />
(Your mate did seem distressed at his behavior when we watched his bout yesterday.)<br />
&quot;Maybe mate isn&#39;t the precise wording,&quot; Vect reddened.<br />
(I do not know what else to call your relationship with the succubus.) Erress explained.<br />
&quot;Either way, Stanley certainly has changed from what Sara described,&quot; Vect counted out the throwing knives he had on him.<br />
(How do you plan to deal with him?)<br />
&quot;I just thought I&#39;d have a quick chat with him before the match began, then knock him out, and we&#39;d have a get together at lunch if all works out,&quot; he explained as he added another 3 smoke bombs to his gear.<br />
(If you can beat him or even get through to the boy. Oh and congratulations on getting to 15 percent last night. You are more resilient than I thought.)<br />
&quot;Probably could have gotten to 20 if you let me.&quot;<br />
(We&#39;ve discussed this, several times in fact.)<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah, I know pushing too hard can have consequences. But I can&#39;t help shake this feeling that something is wrong. And it&#39;s not helped by you constantly looking off like you sense something, but won&#39;t tell me.&quot;<br />
(I apologize for that, but every time you perform the joining preparation it feels like someone or something is watching us and getting closer.)<br />
Vect paused as he reached for his sword. &quot;In the real world or in the mindscape we go to?&quot;<br />
Erress didn&#39;t immediately answer as she thought how to answer. (It feels more like in the mindscape. But I do not know what it is.)<br />
&quot;It cannot be helped now,&quot; he closed his hand around his sword and shouldered it as he opened the door. &quot;Hey Jack sorry to keep you waiting.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t apologize to me, you&#39;re the last one of us still in the tournament. With Freed still unconscious and Vesper dropping out 2 days ago, you&#39;re the last one standing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Gee no pressure or anything,&quot; Vect joked, but then his expression became serious. &quot;How are they doing?&quot;<br />
&quot;As I said Freed is still unconscious but on the mend. He&#39;s going to have a nasty scar, but you know all about that don&#39;t you,&quot; Jack smiled and pointed to Vect&#39;s chest.<br />
Vect gave a halfhearted laugh, &quot;yeah, but you know what? I&#39;d do it again saving your hides,&quot; he gave Jack a smack on the back causing him to wince.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Vect asked concerned.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know. It just started hurting 2 days ago,&quot; he shrugged.<br />
Vect grinned, &quot;is Lelu getting to be too much for you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh ha ha,&quot; Jack rolled his shoulders, &quot;very funny. And no its definitely not her. I&#39;ve got an ointment that has been helping me some.&quot;<br />
&quot;Any sign of Celine?&quot; <br />
&quot;No, not a trace. But I do see her poster everywhere,&quot; Jack jibed.<br />
&quot;Wanted posters aren&#39;t exactly a good way to motivate someone to come out of hiding,&quot; Vect agreed.<br />
The pair left the room and started towards the arena.<br />
&quot;Hopefully she hasn&#39;t gotten into any more trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
-- Alyvia&#39;s Shop --<br />
<br />
&quot;Once the distraction is going, it is your job to help the infiltration group get into and out of the library,&quot; Alyvia continued her briefing. &quot;And then burn the rest to cover our tracks. And remember, we cannot allow anyone to know we were there. If someone sees us-.&quot;<br />
&quot;The will not live to tell about it,&quot; Celine finished. <br />
She wanted to ask something, Alyvia could tell. &quot;Is there something you want to ask? Second thoughts?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m not. But....is there a way you can make sure Vesper, Mai, and Eva aren&#39;t harmed?&quot;<br />
&quot;I have passed on the message to the other&#39;s to not harm them,&quot; Alyvia started.<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Unless. Unless they get in our way. This plan is much bigger than just a few people, no matter how close they are. Nonlethal methods will be used to an extent, but not at a risk to their lives.&quot;<br />
Celine turned away. Alyvia walked closer and hugged her from behind. <br />
&quot;I promised you I will try to restore you and reclaim your tribe. And I keep my vows.&quot; She glanced at the clock. &quot;It is nearly time, Celine. Steel your nerves and be strong.&quot;<br />
<br />
-- Capital Apothicarium --<br />
<br />
As per her people&#39;s culture, Eva stood vigil over her friend&#39;s body as he recovered. Her large battle axe rest in one hand as she sat beside her sleeping friend and filled him in on what he was missing out on.<br />
&quot;- and Jack has used his spare time to hone his craftsmanship. Vect evidently had him make a gift for Sara in secret, some kind of tail ring or something. She seems to love it, but it&#39;s kinda weird to me,&quot; said Eva. She paused to look around at the other beds. Most were empty, the ones that were occupied had people recovering from minor wounds. The Capital&#39;s Apothicarium could hold over 2000 patients, but times like this it rarely saw more than a hundred. <br />
&quot;Looks like most of the senior staff have left to see the beginning of the finals. Quarter finals are starting in a little while,&quot; Eva continued, &quot;I wish you could be there to help cheer Vect on. I bet most of the kingdom will be either at the Grand Colosseum or one of the smaller arenas watching on a great scrying sphere. I bet that even the schools are deserted. Must be spooky to see them so quiet.&quot; She looked out the nearby window to the Colosseum in the distance.<br />
As she looked away Freed stirred and opened his eyes slowly, blinking to adjust his altered eyes to the light. His neutral expression then turned to concern and suspicion. &quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; he muttered, his throat dry.<br />
Eva&#39;s head snapped to him in surprise. &quot;You&#39;re awake,&quot; she exclaimed happily.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he brought himself up to a sitting position, groaning at his aching muscles, &quot;how long was I out?&quot;<br />
&quot;3 days. It&#39;s the quarter finals. Do I need to get you anything or fetch a healer?&quot;<br />
Freed ran one clawed hand over the bandages that covered his chest. He could feel the scar underneath them, a dull burning sensation still present. &#39;If I still feel this after 3 days, Celine must have something potent. I hope I&#39;m recovered enough,&quot; Freed pondered. He then looked to Eva and her axe. &quot;Can you get me some clothes, humanoid clothes,&quot; he clarified, &quot;I think there is a problem.&quot;<br />
&quot;Should I get the others,&quot; she asked, Freed thanking her silently for not arguing with him to stay in bed.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to worry them if it turns out to be nothing, but I think there is a quick message scroll that the healers will sell you just incase.&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think it has to do with my incident at the library a while back,&quot; his body slowly reverting to his disguise form.<br />
Eva stood up and hefted up her large axe. &quot;Work never stops with you does it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I just hope I&#39;m being paranoid.&quot;</p>
