 <br />
Hannah awoke to the familiar sound of an alarm echoing throughout the room, with sunlight streaming through the bedroom curtains, indicating the dawn of morning. She nestled comfortably in her blanket, savoring its warmth and trying to ignore the persistent beeping until her husband finally turned it off. Fortunately, as a housewife, she didn&#39;t have to work, so she could sleep in as long as she pleased.<br />
 <br />
Lying on her side, eyes closed and on the brink of drifting back to sleep, Hannah felt a hairy arm drape over her. Despite her desire to continue sleeping, her husband, Angel, had other ideas. She wasn’t in the mood for sex, but like always, she was forced to comply with her husband&#39;s sexual urges.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
Hannah felt a slight buzz in her head but ignored it as she inched intimately closer to Angel. Her warm breath brushed against his neck as she wrapped an arm around him, gently caressing his stomach as she moved her hand lower toward his crotch. While Angel wanted to continue sleeping, Hannah had different ideas.<br />
 <br />
Without a say in the matter, Angel accepted his wife&#39;s lustful urges as he allowed her to fondle his dick. His flaccid member quickly became erect under her touch through his cotton panties. Once he was hard, she pulled off the covers and removed her boxers. Before he could react, she pushed him onto his back, slid his panties down slightly, and mounted him. Without a word, she closed her eyes and moaned, thrusting rhythmically as she took him inside her.<br />
 <br />
Angel wasn&#39;t in the mood, but Hannah kept going with a stoic expression as she increased her pace. She moaned loudly, moving steadily with the bouncing bed. Angel could only stare at his wife, who had her eyes closed while her lips curled with pleasure. Eventually, her face tightened, and she let out a long gasp as she climaxed, spreading her seed all over his dick.<br />
<br />
Hannah rolled over, sighing in exhaustion. &quot;Thanks, babe.&quot; she said, caressing his cheek before slowly getting up and heading to the bathroom. Angel lay there until he heard the shower start. Still hard, he figured he may as well finish. He reached into the bottom of the nightstand, feeling for his vibrator and lube. After lubricating himself, he turned on the vibrator, setting it to high. He moaned softly as it slid up and down his erect shaft, pleasuring him way more than his wife ever could.<br />
<br />

<br />
Melissa sat in a conference room with three other coworkers, enduring their dull, weekly conference call. Her annoyance grew as her coworker Josh, sitting across from her, kept casting flirtatious glances her way. She avoided eye contact, refusing to give him the attention he sought. Although they had flirted in the past and even had a one-night stand, she was no longer into him, especially after finding out he had a tiny dick. That was a night she preferred to forget.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
Melissa was bewildered by a sudden bright light, but as she looked around, nothing seemed amiss. Her three coworkers were still there. To her left was Sarah, who, like Melissa, was dressed in slacks and a dress shirt. Sarah&#39;s low-cut, gelled hair gleamed under the room light. Across from them were Ron and Josh, both wearing blouses and pencil skirts, their faces adorned with pretty makeup. Everything appeared normal.<br />
<br />
The monotonous, feminine voice of the regional director droned through the speakerphone as the dull conference call continued. Melissa couldn&#39;t help but notice Josh giving her flirtatious glances throughout the meeting. Ever since their one-night stand, he had been acting clingy toward her. Melissa preferred casual hookups over serious relationships and wasn&#39;t interested in Josh. Despite her signals, he couldn&#39;t seem to take the hint.<br />
<br />
While Melissa was listening to the call, struggling to stay focused, she suddenly jolted at the unexpected sensation of something brushing against her leg, moving smoothly up and down. As she locked eyes with Josh, he winked at her with a smirk. He had slipped his foot out of his high heel and was now rubbing it against her leg. She glanced to her left at Sarah, who was leaning on the table, attentively listening to the meeting, and then across at Ron, who was busy jotting down notes. Neither seemed to have noticed.<br />
<br />
Melissa returned an awkward glare at Josh, hoping to get him to stop, but his nylon-covered foot continued to rub intimately against her. Gradually, he slid his foot higher until it reached her groin. He tapped his toes a few times against her crotch, causing a wave of arousal to wash over her. She bit her lip as he gave her a seductive smile. Despite wanting to push his foot away, she found herself increasingly turned on. <i>&quot;Maybe another date wouldn&#39;t be so bad.&quot;</i> she reluctantly thought, succumbing to her current horniness.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Karen stormed into her backyard, fuming as loud metal music blared from the neighboring house. At 52, she despised living next to college students, who were such noisy and inconsiderate neighbors. It was early morning, and she had been trying to sleep, but they woke her up with their obnoxious music. She figured the young men were probably smoking weed or up to other juvenile behavior. Though tempted to call the cops, she preferred confronting them face-to-face. Maybe if she threatened them, they would finally learn their lesson. She had a lot to say.<br />
<br />
As she approached the fence, she shouted angrily, &quot;Hey!&quot; Peeking over the top, a sudden FLASH hit.<br />
<br />
Karen, shirtless with her beer belly on display, looked over to see the two young college boys next door sunbathing in their bikinis, with loud pop music blaring from a radio behind them. They were both lying on beach towels on the lawn. The blonde was on his stomach, his cheeks fully exposed as his bikini rode up. The brunette was on his back, a noticeable bulge protruding from his skimpy bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry! Were we being too loud?&quot; The brunette apologized profusely as he sat up and reached around to turn down the radio volume.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, just a little. You weren&#39;t bothering me, but you know how some of these neighbors can be.&quot; Karen joked, her eyes drawn to the massive bulge of the brunette. &quot;Would hate to see the cops called on two young boys just having fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; The brunette laughed awkwardly, feeling uncomfortable as the older woman ogled him. &quot;Well, thanks for the warning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anytime.&quot; Karen smirked as she turned to head back to her house. She loved living next door to college boys.</p>
