<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Demetrius opens his eyes he sees the masseuse quickly removing an amphore and wiping his body down.  Demetrius felt completely relaxed, yet everything felt new for some reason.  This puzzled him because he had always been rubbed down after a wrestling match by the slave masseuse, in this very room.  But Demetrius is not a man of thought, he is a man of action.  He is not one to think very hard on a topic, but still, it is an odd feeling to awake and find a place new that you have been in for years...<br />
Demetrius sits up and feels the wonderful sensation of achy muscles that have been well trained.  He also notices that his phallus has the delightful dull ache of a hard fuck and cum.  <br />
&quot;Marius, you old perv!  Did the priests put you up to milking me like the prized bull  again for my seed?!  Is that why you had the special oils out when I came in?&quot;<br />
The masseuse, Marius, replies:<br />
&quot;Master Demetrius, if I&#39;m ever to buy my freedom from this place, I need coin.  The only place I get that is from the priests, and your seed fetches 15 drachmae.  What is a slave to do?&quot;<br />
Marius is secretly delighted: the boy has completely forgotten his old existence and the magic of the place is instilling the new memories of manhood in the wrestler.  Marius had never mentioned his name, but the boy is now acting as if he has known him his entire life!<br />
&quot;Well, next time ask!&quot; Demetrius says as he snaps a towel at Marius&#39; back. <br />
 &quot;Today wasn&#39;t an auspicious one for me to give up my seed! I have to bed Lady Leonita tonight and I&#39;m supposed to please her, and hopefully knock her up!  How can I do that if you are draining me for the damned priests!&quot;<br />
&quot;I am sorry Master...&quot;<br />
Demetrius swings his legs over the table and he looks at himself in the metal mirror across the chamber.  For some reason, that newness crept into his mind again.  He looked at himself intently, trying to figure out what is off.  He has jet black hair in a tight curl as befits a Greek man from Athens.  His face is tan, chiseled features with a classic nose, deep brown eyes and perfect beard that is trimmed close.  Strong neck leads onto broad shoulders rounded with bulging muscle, coated with  a dusting of coarse jet black hair.  He flexes his arms and sees the bicep and triceps bulge and more thick hair under his arms.  His nose can smell the rich male musk from his armpits and he can feel his phallus begin to tingle and grow hard. <br />
&quot;I must go to the baths to clean myself up a bit, but not TOO much!  Leonita likes her men to be MEN, and that includes smelling like one!&quot; he chuckles,<br />
As he continues to look he admires his chest, a veritable forest of silky, sweaty black hair that swirls across the prominent pectorals and down to his perfect 8 abdominals.  His broad torso narrows down to a compact waist with striated muscles , his &quot;Apollo&#39;s Belt,&quot; directing his attention down to the thick, oily hair above his throbbing, powerful phallus.  Easily 8&quot; and capped by a plum-colored glans leaking slippery precum, he chuckles and thinks how even with his &quot;draining&quot;, he will be able to make both Aaias AND Leonita moan tonight...the question being who first! <br />
Further down, his powerful thighs and calves are covered in wiry hair.  He could remember when it began to thicken at about 11 and how Marius told him of his impending puberty and how he should begin to strain his muscles more so that he would build up to be a powerful man.  Marius was truly right then and Demetrius has never forgotten that.  He really was not concerned that Marius was selling his seed again.  If it would help the old man finally buy his and his wife&#39;s freedom, why should he stand in the way?<br />
<br />
Marius watched Demetrius stare in the mirror; it was an essential part of the process.  &quot;He is seeing himself as always, for the first time&quot; he thinks.  Demetrius shakes his head, and Marius notices that look.  Demetrius is fully &quot;back&quot; and the former boy &quot;Derek&quot; would stay passively as Demetrius for possibly a whole lifetime now.  This realm&#39;s time moves differently to the outer world and in the world outside of this magic realm of Ancient Greece, no real time would pass however.  The boy would eventually return right back to where he left from, but he would retain all of the memories, and much of the physique of &quot;Demetrius&quot; in the outer world.  No &quot;man&quot; would want to return to a pubescent boy&#39;s body or existence after living as a Greek wrestler!  The magic would adjust things so that people who know Derek would accept his new physique without question and Derek would leave literally &quot;a new man!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Marius, where is my kynodesme? I need to walk down to the baths, and the way this thing is standing up, I&#39;ll end up angering everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marius looked over and found Demetrius&#39; kynodesme, a foreskin strap that would cover the glans of his phallus while he walked across the palé to the baths.  Nudity is not a problem here, particularly for athletic men.  However, it is the height of rudeness for a man to show his glans in public. <br />
<br />
Handing it to Demetrius, he quickly ties it at the top of his foreskin covering his immodesty, then around his waist to keep his erection from flopping about.  Standing up, he feels the familiar, but again &quot;new&quot; sensation of his powerful body working. Without another word, he walks out of the chamber.  He can feel the heavy footfall of his feet on the smooth stone floor and the coolness of the hallway, along with the heaviness of his balls hanging low in his sack.   Demetrius is quite puzzled, but he does not let it really bother him as he walks towards the baths.</p>
