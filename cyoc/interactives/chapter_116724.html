<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shamus stood quietly in the sort of &quot;dance studio&quot; that he and Shannon ran. It looked a lot like a studio with its wood floor, its long floor to ceiling mirror, and speakers that allowed the two of them to teach various traditional Irish dances that Shamus had grown up on. However, they also had various large mats and a reinforced vaulting horse that almost amounted to training for various track and field events that related to jumping, which in a sense made sense. The Irish Sport Horse was popularly used in various show jumping events, and Shannon when she&#39;d been younger had done well in those events that Shamus&#39;s family had participated in and that made Shannon valuable to the family farm.<br />
<br />
Now though, Shannon was far more important to him. Her youth had been restored and she was more than valuable to the family, she was PART of the family. And Shamus smiled as the found himself thinking back to shortly after Shannon was uplifted and told him she loved him.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You love me...&quot; Shamus said in surprise to the recently uplifted Irish Sport Horse as she stood before him in the Brown family&#39;s barn and as the Horizon scientists that were present moved to draw some blood from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Shannon answered, her voice carrying just as strong an Irish accent as Shamus&#39;s did, &quot;You were always there by my side. You were kind to my foals and kind to me. You were always willing to talk to me, and I found it sad that such a kind and caring man never won a young lady&#39;s heart. At times I wished I could speak to you and tell you that I cared...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like how Samson feels about Abby,&quot; Martin Brown commented to his wife, Josephine.<br />
<br />
Both Shamus and Shannon turned their heads to them. The Browns had been very kind to provide Shannon with her dose of the Animalia Virus, but there was some surprise at how open and friendly they were. It struck Shamus as though they wanted to be friends, even though they knew very little about each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our daughter Abby was the first human who was transformed,&quot; Josephine Brown spoke, &quot;She was with our stallion, a male Quarter Horse we&#39;d named Samson. He was uplifted and by accident transformed Abby. As she adapted to being a mare Animalian, she learned that Samson had listened to her when she talked to him about things in her day before he was uplifted. In that, Samson fell in love with Abby before he was uplifted and she became an Animalian. The events with the accident that spread the virus and lead to his uplifting and her transformation let them both share what had truly been growing in their hearts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds nice,&quot; Shannon commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; Josephine smiled, &quot;and your love for Shamus here reminds me of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon nodded and turned back to Shamus, her ears perked and her brown eyes focused on him. Her attention to him meant she barely felt the prick of the needle that drew some blood from the crook of her arm, if she felt it at all. He seemed to smile and cam toward her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You love me,&quot; Shamus said slowly and hugged Shannon. His statement was a pure statement, not a question. He ultimately looked up to her, and despite some age lines along her muzzle, Shannon still towered over him and her breasts filled a great deal of his vision. Shamus did his best to smile to her, &quot;I... I think I love you to... As a companion before... but... now... now... Now, I&#39;m sorry it took so long...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Time isn&#39;t an issue,&quot; Martin commented, &quot;If Shannon is healthy enough and her anemia is gone, she can get her second dose, which would bring her physical age down to the Animalian that gave her her second dose... And then the two of you can have a moment of privacy and she can pass the Animalian &quot;Virus&quot; on to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shamus and Shannon then looked over to the Horizon scientist who was looking over a set of test dishes for results of the tests for Equine Infectious Anemia. After a few moments, he turned to them and smiled and held up a thumb with his right hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Preliminary tests would indicate that Shannon is healthy now,&quot; the scientist gave a smile, &quot;If you both love each other... You can go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon smiled happily and was about to dance when hoofed hand touched her shoulder. She looked over to see Josephine beside her with what looked like a large sports bottle. It was made with clear plastic which Shannon guessed was filled with Josephine&#39;s milk. She smiled and took the bottle and toasted it up to Josephine and Martin and then to Shamus. She then raised it to the lips of her muzzle and began to drink the milk down. The milk tasted just like the milk she had been given to uplift her, which confirmed who the milk had come from. Shannon quickly downed all of it and then wiped her mouth with one arm before smiling down to Shamus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Shannon smiled to him.<br />
<br />
Shamus looked up to her and he watched as Shannon&#39;s body shook a little, but she didn&#39;t appear to be in any pain. Her already beautiful muscles as an adult Animalian rippled and grew even more well defined. The age lines around her muzzle softened and vanished and her great bosom became firmer. Animalians seemed to all be very well built in that regard, but at first, Shannon did look as though there had been some sag in her bosom, likely that initially she was still physically built toward the later years of her life. But now that was reversing. Her youth was coming back and her breasts became firmer as a result. Her coat also gained a beautiful luster to it, which he could tell Shannon liked. He watched as she raised one hand to her breast and caressed it with her arousing nipple poking through her fur and gave a heavy moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... this feels so good, Shamus,&quot; Shannon said to him, &quot;Please... take me. I need it... I need you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shamus was a bit hesitant, as he was in a barn and didn&#39;t want to lay in anything unsanitary and he didn&#39;t want Shannon to lay in anything unsanitary either. He glanced over one shoulder to see the Horizon scientist collecting his things to leave. He then looked forward to see Martin and Josephine also moving to leave and give them space. Martin looked to him and gave a smile and then pointed to a nearby stall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since the Animalia outbreak, the barn has been more for holding in straw and hay to be used for mulch and for anyone that&#39;s still wanting to raise mundane animals here,&quot; Martin smiled, &quot;that stall has only hay in it... if you&#39;d like to roll in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shamus barely had time to see Martin wink to him as Shannon caught him by one arm and pulled him toward that stall. Once there, she began to kiss him passionately, which Shamus found himself returning with equal passion.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t mind that I&#39;m human?&quot; Shamus asked as he felt Shannon working to get his pants undone.<br />
<br />
&quot;If what they say is true... you won&#39;t be human for much longer,&quot; Shannon smiled as she got his pants down and was pleased to see that Shamus was already erect. He wasn&#39;t necessarily big between his legs, but that would soon change, &quot;You&#39;ll become a handsome stallion with all the strengths and build that comes with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she sat Shamus on one of the bales of hay in the stall and then lowered herself onto his penis. It wasn&#39;t big, which given her physical size gave him easy access to her moist folds, and Shannon quickly felt the muscles in her vagina begin to tighten and try to grip Shamus&#39;s equipment. But, if what the Browns had said was true, Shamus would soon become a stallion Animalian. She&#39;d give him his two doses and they&#39;d be happy together. Shamus could feel her great strength in all things. Shannon seemed to be sitting on his lap, but he&#39;d also noticed that she was also balancing herself so that her weight wasn&#39;t crushing him and let their union be quite pleasure filled. He quickly thrust himself into her, and soon a major tingling sensation went through his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I think it&#39;s starting,&quot; Shamus spoke as he looked down toward his feet. He could see his feet lengthening as black fur seemed to blossom on it, and as it painlessly lengthened,  his middle toe grew bigger and bigger with the toenail taking on a more hoof-like shape. His other toes seemed to melt back into his feet which lasted until his feet were the digitigrade legs of a Horse Animalian ending in a one hoofed toe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... yes,&quot; Shannon answered as she thrust forward, feeling Shamus&#39;s penis grow larger inside her and making her breasts bounce with each thrust into her. She looked down to see Shamus&#39;s muscles grow larger and larger. His neck lengthened a bit, his ears moved of the top of his head while his face pushed forward into an equine muzzle. His hair lengthened and became something a white mane that framed his football-like shaped ears and went down his neck. &quot;Oh.... oh... Shamus... I&#39;m gonna...&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon then whinnied as her body orgasmed as they coupled. Soon after, Shamus whinnied in response and fired off a strong eruption of semen into Shannon. Shamus then looked down at himself and then to Shannon and he smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; Shamus said to her.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Shannon spoke as she came out stand beside Shamus in their studio and training area.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said that out loud...?&quot; Shamus asked as he looked to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you did,&quot; Shannon answered, &quot;What were you thinking of?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You, and what you&#39;ve given me,&quot; Shamus said with a smile to her.<br />
<br />
The two smiled and kissed.</p>
