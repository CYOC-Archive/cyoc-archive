<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bane launched himself at the pole on the bar and did two mighty swings around it before landing in a crouch. He threw his head back and let forth a deafening howl that got the crowd cheering. In the seconds before the music started,  Bane quickly scanned the room.<br />
<br />
Onca had been purchased by a table of mixed creatures. He was standing there, looking regal, and totally naked. A rabbit morph was massaging his legs and ass. He stood up on the table grinning with regal feline disdain, his throbbing cock pointing skyward. He and Bane exchanged knowing nods. Obviously Onca had taken their conversation to heart.<br />
<br />
Rufus was standing on a nearby table staring at Onca and looking almost in shock, definitely not a professional. Bane shot him a scowl of disapproval. <br />
<br />
 “Damn wolf boi you look hawt. You used my shampoo!” This voice was one he hadn’t heard in his head before, but it obviously belonged to Carl’s equine companion as both of them were looking across the bar grinning and pointing.<br />
<br />
“I love your shampoo”, Bane responded. “I want to use it some more. Hopefully someone will want to get me dirty enough to make me shower again. Neighing laughter filled his head in response.<br />
<br />
“Trust me, we want to see more of you tonight”, this time it was Carl’s distinctive voice. “We have to go with someone else this time, but I can promise you a surprise later that you will really enjoy.”<br />
<br />
As there was only one other dancer left who hadn’t been purchased, the math was pretty obvious. “When you buy the fox, make sure he’s coated from nose to tail in your cum. It will make our shower more enjoyable.” Bane winked at the two equines who busted up laughing both inside and outside of his mind.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the pounding trance music started, and Bane became a blur of motion. His body flew through the air as he did things that would be impossible for a human pole dancer. The air flowed over his body picking up his amplified scent and spreading it to all the bar patrons in the surrounding area.<br />
<br />
As Bane transitioned to some slower, more conventional, yet sexually charged moves. He grinned as erections quickly rose around him. A husky dog morph was openly stroking himself at the bar, his eyes glued to Bane’s thong, Bane leaned out and gave the husky a quick lick to his knotted cock. The surprised husky howled as his cock fountained.<br />
<br />
Bane swung to his feet and struck a macho pose. He took his finger and wiped some of the husky cum that had splattered on his cheek, then stuck the finger in his mouth and began to sensually suck it. The husky cum tasted wonderful. The whole crowd moaned, even Ozzy was affected as his very jaded cock came to full rigid attention.<br />
<br />
Bane climbed up and down the pole grinding his hard cock against it all the way. Bane felt a large bead of pre form, and get absorbed by his thong. No doubt about it, he was ultra horny, and the scent in the room was making it worse by the second. He was going to cum in a big way. ”Might as well go for a big finish”, Bane thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Bane launched into another series of power moves as the pressure built in his cock. As the music came to it’s ultimate crescendo, Bane flipped off the pole into a summersault. He shredded his thong with his ever growing claws and landed in a crouch next to the pole. As he threw his head back and howled, his now free cock fountained on to the bar splattering some of the nearby patrons. Bane’s howl was joined by many others as half the bar, including Onca and Ozzy shot loads.<br />
<br />
The applause was slow to start as so many had just had their worlds rocked by the performance. First a few, then more, then most, and finally the entire bar joined in a thunderous ovation punctuated by howls, growls, and roars. Bane pumped his fist in triumph and bowed to the crowd. After more than a minute the applause wound down.<br />
<br />
Finally Ozzy’s breathless voice came over the PA system. “Wow!”<br />
<br />
That simple statement touched off another short round of applause and cheers.<br />
<br />
“Well folks I guess this means Bane wants to be auctioned naked. I’m not about to argue with him after that performance. Who will start the bidding?”<br />
<br />
The bidding was fast and furious, but Bane wasn’t really paying attention. Bane decided he liked the husky and wanted to do more with him. He got the husky’s attention and mouthed, “I want to lick your cock and balls”. The husky pointed at himself with a question on his face. Bane simply nodded at him in reply.<br />
<br />
The husky ran to the back of the bar. Just as one table thought they had won the bidding another table at the back interrupted with a higher bid. The war started anew, with the table at the back finally winning. It turned out to be the husky and some other canine morphs including a coyote and a wolf. Bane launched himself across the bar landing on the winning table. The husky pulled him off the table and embraced Bane in his paws as they licked each other’s faces. The wolf and coyote moved behind Bane examining his body in great detail, even sniffing under his tail. Bane felt a clawed finger invade his ass which caused him to moan and cum all over the husky. The husky responded by licking Bane’s cock clean.<br />
<br />
Bane leaned over and whispered in the wolf’s ear that penetration wasn’t allowed on this dance. He looked chastened and quickly apologized. Bane assured him that he enjoyed it, and would welcome it at another time. The wolf grinned and registered a tip for Bane with Lago for $100. <br />
<br />
In the mean time the coyote was working Bane over giving him the best back and ass massage he had ever had, even while he and the husky were making out. The coyote’s cock was under his tail, but he wasn’t forcing the issue. Bane was enjoying it to the point he was considering thrusting back and impaling himself on the coyote of his own volition.<br />
.<br />
Finally the bar clean-up completed and it was Fennec’s turn to dance. The bar erupted once again as the fox burst into the room.</p>
