<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erick knew his time was short and at last took a picture of one fine and pretty stallion. He thought it better to be a pony than anything else least the machine choose one and send him into some pure hellish life.<br />
<br />
Quickly he put the rest of the photos back into the compartment. Then his nervous fingers took his choosen photo and tried to push it into the slot, but it wounldn't go in?<br />
<br />
A last verbal warning came over the speaker above in the ceiling. Erich tried again and again to fit the photo into the slot and show his preferred choice of form. Then it began to fit and much to his dismay he watched his photo split in two parts.<br />
<br />
A close look saw that he had two photos, no doubt due to being together for so long they got stuck. The machine took the bottom part of the photos and began to eat it into the slot. <br />
<br />
Suddenly the pretty stallion pony photo popped up and drifted to the floor. Erick starred as the last half of the photo which this machine was to use on him, slid into the slot as his life to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Shit, a cow!&quot; grumbled Erick as just the end of the photo showed a cow head and neck before the picture went into the slot, and was gone.<br />
<br />
Now a feeling of letdown and then some nervousness of what was to come made Erick begin to cry. Turning he looked for some last way to escape. Wall after wall of the machine was covered in aome metal grill made of thousands of diamond shaped holes. The floor too was the same as the ceiling above. The only one spot that was different, a small smooth square with the photo compartment and that slot.<br />
<br />
Looking down the floor had a vibration starting. Erick spread out his arms and brased himself for what was to come. A bright light flicked on as the air in the room began to swirl.<br />
<br />
Blinking back his tears and fear he wanted to see and understand what was happening. The air soon filled with sparkling little stars of dust which twinkled in the bright light. Some were golden, some silver , others were a bright red as they swirled around him.<br />
<br />
Faster and faster the air rotated in the room as Erick's fears drained into a strange feeling of uforia. Laughing and feeling so very delighted, a contentment feeling while odd and growing passions of sexual lust all were making their mark.<br />
<br />
The rush of air was lifting him up off the elevator floor and he began to spin also as part of the sparkle stars of color.<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes Erick watched as if looking at some fast running film the memories and life he'd lived in these few short years of life. Moaning and laughing the memories flowed as he saw the sights of happening long past but fresh in his mind.<br />
<br />
As strange then the swriling roaring wind slowed and with a dull feeling he touched the floor once again. Blinking his eyes open the room now looked of strange colors. Black, silvers and multitones of gray where he remembered the walls being as of four different colors.<br />
<br />
Fingers touched the one wall in front of him but had the same odd and dull feeling as his toes. The air calmed and wind slowed to just a slight breeze which tickled every part of his skin. A shake of his head to try and clear both sights and thoughts proved a stranger feeling yet.<br />
<br />
Like a dog shaking his head down the length of it's body when trying to remove the wetness he hates so much, the same rattled feeling ran down Erick's whole body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations! I am proud of you as being out twenty first subject to be Dynaformed by my machine. In a moment the door will open and I expect you to walk out and then enter the adjoining room where the final adjustments in metal attitudes will be preformed, good luck !&quot;<br />
<br />
The one wall parted and open as a normal elevator's door. A split second of nervous hesitation and then Erick with stiff legs struggled out the elevator. <br />
<br />
Once in the next room the door closed behind Erick. He turned to watch what his past was as the door closed and locked tight shut. A step foward found him tripping and falling.<br />
<br />
THUD, he went as falling forward his fingers hit the floor with heavy force. Yet he thought they would for some reason break but they didn't? A look around proved to restart past fears of watching that cow photo be eaten by the machine.<br />
<br />
A casual look over his shoulder was the proof of the strange machine's true powers. His stout shoulders flowed outward as chest and a belly stretched long. One very nervous Erick then stood with mouth open as he watched whipping about his long boney tail.<br />
<br />
Nervous and ever in his short life he watched and wondered about himself as the tail swung this way and that. His entire line of thought was captivated by watching his new appendage swing and wip about!<br />
<br />
Then another bright light and a voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Subject, step forward and place a foot on either the right or left lighted plates in front of you. To touch the right is to choose a mindless life of instinct and true Bovine mental state. To touch the left plate will direct the pattern code to leave much of your human life learned knowledge while mixing in some instincts needed for true bestial function. Now choose!&quot; said the voice of what Erick imagined was the man who built this machine.<br />
<br />
Shaking a head still feeling as stuffed with cotton he steped forward.</p>
