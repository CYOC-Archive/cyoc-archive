<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Shhh!” a radiantly beautiful auburn furred anthro female fox says with a finger to her mouth. “Follow me and don’t make a sound. We need to get you to safety.”<br />
<br />
Before you can response, she turns, her mid-back length auburn hair flows freely in the air as you feel something soft hit your leg. Looking down you see a large, bushy, white-fur tipped tail swaying to help her keep her balance as she crouches low to stay out of sight. As you step forward to follow it’s hard not to admire the vixen’s athletic form. As you examine her fur more, you can see that the auburn colored fur stops just above her wrists and ankles where the fur’s color transitions to black.<br />
<br />
Your admiration is broken when she suddenly stops and raises a hand in a motion for you to stop too. Just ahead you see two large, ominous, large, muscular, anthro tigers walk by as they were scanning their surroundings.<br />
<br />
Releasing a breath you didn’t know you were holding, you whisper, “Where are we going?”<br />
<br />
The vixen turns her head to look back at you. From this profile you can see her facial structure is mostly human save for her nose and mouth that push out a little in a sort of muzzle and her teeth appeared sharper, especially her canine teeth. White fur leads up the middle of her neck and spreads over part of her chin and mouth; auburn fur covered the rest of her face.<br />
<br />
“To safety,” she responds in a low tone. “Keep following me, we’re almost there.”<br />
<br />
Without confirmation she dashes ahead into the clearing the tigers had just gone through. Up ahead you can see a small building with a door and no apparent windows or signs. The vixen goes up to the door and slowly pushes it open and motions you in. With no other apparent option you dart into the darkened interior and stop to not run into anything. All you can hear is the vixen step inside and close the door.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing here?” She asks sternly as you hear the door’s lock set.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean? I was invited to Elysium Zoolog-“<br />
<br />
“You fell for it too…” The vixen interrupts with a sad tone to her voice.<br />
<br />
A small click turns on a small entry light that illuminats the vixen fully. The dim yellow light highlights her gorgeous form. As her blue eyes meet yours she looks away, almost shamefully, as her two fox ears seem to fold down a little. Taking this chance you look at the rest of her body; white fur flows from her chin, down her neck, over her large breasts, down her stomach, and ending down her inner thighs. Your eyes go back up to her face which is still looking away. It was odd as you looked at her face; it was like you knew her. Wait you do know her!<br />
<br />
“Zoe?” You say softly as it hits you. There were only two people you knew with that color of hair and one was a guy. As you looked at her face and her deep-blue eyes there was no mistake. “Zoe, is that you?”<br />
<br />
Slowly she looks back at you, with watery eyes, as she nods slowly. “Yeah…” Raising an arm she wipes her eyes with her furry arm then looks at you again. “The Elysium Zoological Gardens is a cover for an experiment by the zoo. They need more animals and are getting them by transforming us.”<br />
<br />
“Transforming humans? Is that what happened to you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes. I’ve been transformed into this monstrous form…”<br />
<br />
Silence follows your statement as you both look at each other.<br />
<br />
“I was lured here the same way you were.” She continues after a bit. “Just after dusk we were lead to a room in an underground lab. Once there, we were asked what our favorite animals are. I said, as you can probably guess, ‘foxes.’ Once we had all answered we all started to change into the animals we had said.”<br />
<br />
Shifting a little, Zoe paused as she seemed to collect herself and consider what she was going to say next.<br />
<br />
With a deep breath she explained, “A few in our group actually started to… well, masturbate as they transformed. I was too busy trying to stop my own changes when I heard a howl as a guy who was turning into a wolf climaxed. As cum was shooting out of his barbed penis, his body shrunk and contorted until he was a full wolf. The same happened to the others who climaxed too. The rest of us were too scared at what was happening and just looked around at each other in panic. From there it all turned into a blur of running to a door which we forced open and ran.  About six of us were able to escape.”<br />
<br />
It was hard to believe what she was saying but it was also hard to deny with an antro-fox woman standing in front of you. “How many are there, like you, I mean.<br />
<br />
“Only a few of us are left.” She says mournfully. “There were at least eight of us. Our group that escaped ran into two others from the other night. At this point we try to keep our distance though after we learned of a condition we have.”<br />
<br />
“Condition?” You ask after she doesn’t continue.<br />
<br />
Nodding her head she looks down at the floor as she says, “When we met the other two something happened. Our group had a cougar-boy. Their group had a cougar-girl. You might guess how that ended. They couldn’t resist their desires and all the rest of us could do was watch as they mated and transformed into their animal forms…”<br />
<br />
“Good god!” You nearly shout in horror but you’re able to keep it just above audible.<br />
<br />
A sob comes from Zoe’s shadowed form as she says, “Yeah… I’m really scared. I… I don’t want to be a fox…”<br />
<br />
Stepping up to Zoe, you reach out and touch her shoulder for support.</p>
