<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad crashed hard on the unforgiving tiles forming Russ’s kitchen floor after getting swiped by the back of his giant neighbor’s hand.<br />
<br />
It had been a half-hearted action on Russ’s part – a brushing aside of an insect that had been making a nuisance of itself since he had first detected it. <br />
<br />
Now Brad, battered and feeling bruised, watched as his husband’s shoe lifted off the floor. Mark had dressed in a pair of his comfortable sneakers for the stroll between the houses. Brad hated the ratty footwear. He’d nagged Mark for ages to ditch the sneakers, which had gaping holes in their canvas sides.<br />
<br />
The left sneaker slammed down on an adjacent tile and the resulting gust of wind swept Brad’s measly form several inches over the smooth tiles. He launched himself into a desperate flight, his wings buzzing from the exertion of evading the colossal limbs of his husband and his neighbor.<br />
<br />
As the tiny insect struggled with a difficult takeoff, Russ realized he was wearing only a pair of boxers with his hunky next-door-neighbor standing in his kitchen.<br />
<br />
Mark, who had obviously noticed too, spoke.<br />
<br />
“I am sorry that Brad went for one of his little adventures in your place,” he said awkwardly. “That was, umm, wrong of him.”<br />
<br />
Russ laughed. “I’m sort of flattered that he wanted to get all tiny around big Russ.”<br />
<br />
Mark didn’t agree completely, but he felt compelled to join in the laughter.<br />
<br />
“It was still an inexcusable intrusion…”<br />
<br />
Russ grinned. “I’m not complaining.” He moved closer and patted Mark’s abs. “And when we find him, we could both, um, put the little fucker through his paces.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Russ chuckled. “Well, if he wants to be tiny with two big hunks, we can give him what he wants.”<br />
<br />
Mark noticed the outline of a bulge in Russ’s boxers before the fabric stretched out and erased the fleeting image. He felt a more than mild twitch of his own cock in his jeans. “We could…” He suddenly became very aware of Russ.<br />
<br />
Russ noticed. “But we have to find him first.”<br />
<br />
Brad rocketed toward the ceiling on his little housefly wings, unable to believe that his husband, awkwardly, and his neighbor, with enthusiasm, were negotiating the possibility of a threesome.<br />
<br />
“I don’t even mind that Brad’s such a kinky little fucker,” Russ said in a low voice.<br />
<br />
“Yes, well,” Mark said. His beard hid most of his deep blush.<br />
<br />
More than a little horny himself, Brad made a turn and buzzed back toward the giants. Less cautious than the situation called for, he circled his husband’s head and hovered before his face.<br />
<br />
“Mark!” He was practically drooling from his proboscis at the prospect. “Just help me get back to normal and we will have lots of…”<br />
<br />
A big black fist came out of nowhere and closed around his puny form.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Got him,” Russ chortled. “Damn fly’s been making a pest of itself all day.”<br />
<br />
Feeling the worthless insect’s pathetic struggles, he started to clench his fist tighter, only for Mark to stop him.<br />
<br />
“Pretend it’s Brad,” Mark said, his voice husky, his dick hard. The latter was unmistakable, as Russ confirmed with a single glance.<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” Russ played along. “What should we do with the little fucker?”<br />
<br />
“Tell him you’re going to crush him like a bug,” Mark said, feeling his cock doing calisthenics in his pants.<br />
<br />
“He likes that?”<br />
<br />
Mark nodded, took a few steps, and eased onto Russ’s sofa.<br />
<br />
Russ raised his closed fist to his face. “Hear that, you pathetic pest,” Russ said. “Your husband said I can go ahead and crush you like a bug.”<br />
<br />
Russ felt the trapped fly’s struggles increase as the bug went wild inside his sweaty fist. The faintest hint of the bug’s frantic buzzing escaped the confines of his meaty fist.<br />
<br />
Brad felt shocked by his husband’s horny roleplay with their neighbor. Any other time, he would have followed Mark’s lead. But now…<br />
<br />
“Mark!” Brad buzzed. “For fuck’s sake, it’s me! Mark!”<br />
<br />
“He’s kicking up a storm,” Russ got into the role, taking a seat by Mark on the sofa without ever easing the pressure of his closed fist.<br />
<br />
“Squeeze,” Mark suggested as one of his own hands massaged his bulge.<br />
<br />
Russ squeezed his fist, instantly putting a stop to what had been the bug’s feeble struggles. The confines of the fist became so tight that Brad couldn’t even buzz his wings. His form’s frail exoskeleton felt the strain. Much more, and he would simply implode as the meaty walls of Russ’s hand squeezed.<br />
<br />
But Russ used his other hand to grope at Mark’s cock. He massaged the sizable organ, shifting it back and forth beneath the crotch of the big man’s pants.<br />
<br />
“Just put the tiny runt there, on my cock,” Mark said.<br />
<br />
Russ hawked up phlegm and hoped he could be quicker than the fly. He gave one more debilitating squeeze before opening his fist. He saw the struggling insect and spit into his palm before it could take flight.<br />
<br />
“Like this,” he said, showing Mark the insect mired in the spit.<br />
<br />
Mark worked convulsively to open his pants and free his fully swollen cock. Russ’s hand, along with the spit and the trapped fly, wrapped around the huge shaft and started stroking.<br />
<br />
Musk. Spit. Sweat. Precum. The fly’s senses felt overwhelmed. Russ gripped Mark’s cock with a tightness that equalled what he had applied with his closed fist. <br />
<br />
“He’s a pathetic loser,” Mark said, using some of the favorite phrases from other roleplays he had conducted with a more than willing Brad. “He’s not a real man.”<br />
<br />
Brad bungled his way into a buzz. “Mark, please stop!”<br />
<br />
Mark groaned and panted, but as he felt the point of no return approach, he pushed away Russ’s hand.<br />
<br />
“Let’s give him some fun with you,” Mark said. His own hand plenty sweaty, Mark rubbed the spit-covered fly off into his palm as Russ quickly unleashed his own cock.<br />
<br />
Mark gripped the huge black pole, smashing the little fly into the hard shaft.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, each giant began stroking the other’s cock as they sat back on the sofa, the tiny fly all but forgotten. The giants kept their focus on the urgent need for release.<br />
<br />
Brad took stock of his depressing situation. He had been part of the hottest imaginable threesome but excluded from anything pleasurable. Far from it. He was covered in sweat, spit and even a shiny sheen of precum. His wings buzzed feebly. He hoped they might work long enough for one more flight, letting him fly  back home to his lab before…</p>
