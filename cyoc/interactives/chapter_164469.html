<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jace stands there, absolutely shocked. He couldn’t believe it. He just saw his sister having sex, in front of his eyes. He looked at her completely nude body with Tyler’s dick in her pussy. And he was just offered to join in. He lost grip of the ladder, he fell.<br />
<br />
He hit the ground. He grabbed his knee. Lucky for his muscle he didn’t take too much damage, but he was definitely bruised.<br />
He looked back up at the ladder, but it wasn’t there. He looked around, vines?<br />
He looked in front of him. Ominously, the Sundial sat. It looked almost bigger, but he was on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Jace,” a voice said in his ear, at a normal volume rather than a whisper, “I see you’re in distress,”<br />
“Oh my god, I was about to come to you,” he got to his feet, he looked at the sundial and it was the same size, “I need you to fix Blue,”<br />
“In what way?”<br />
“All ways. I don’t care just make her like she was before I changed everything, just change it all back, everything. I don’t care what’s he price is. Just do it, and do it now.”<br />
“Very well, Jace,”<br />
Jace closed his eyes, he opened them. He was in his room, he was on the floor. He’d just landed there from falling,<br />
<br />
“Jace are you alright,” his sister called him. He heard her quickly run over to the ladder, she slid down it and attended to him, “Jace, what happened,”<br />
“I... I saw you having- having sex with that Tyler guy...”<br />
“What!?” Blue laughed, “no!” She said, “I’m sure you know I’m a virgin and I’m not going to ‘do’ anything before I get married,”<br />
“Y-you... but...”<br />
“Jace... I don’t know what’s up with you but I think all this sudden growth is making you go a little crazy. Come upstairs I’ll get you and ice pack and maybe we’ll go visit a doctor or something,” Blue stood up, she was completely normal, her body was tall and thin just like normal. She stretched. Her boobs were small again. Jace had never been more relieved to a girl with a small butt and small boobs.<br />
<br />
He made his way up the ladder. He sat down at the table as he watched his sister search through the freezer for something to put on his knee. She found a bag of frozen peas. She closed the freezer and walked to Jace and placed it on his knee, “better?”<br />
“Yeah.” He responded,<br />
“This reminds me of when we were younger. You’d always manage to hurt yourself in one way or another.”<br />
“Yeah,” Jace said, he smiled and laughed a little.<br />
Blue too the ice pack off his leg, Jace looked up at her as she did. She was looking at his face, “what?” He asked,<br />
“You didn’t hit your lip on something, did you?” She asked him,<br />
“Uh...” he said, he put two fingers on his lips. They felt swollen. He quickly got up and went to the bathroom. He looked into the mirror. Blue followed behind, more confused as to why he was panicking than anything.<br />
<br />
He looked in the mirror. They sure did look bigger, he looked down. His belly. It looked... bigger...<br />
<br />
He quickly burst out of the bathroom, pushing his sister out of the way. He went into her room and looked into her full body mirror. He watched as his tank top lifted as his belly grew. He turned around. His butt, it was growing. His already thick thighs were beginning to grow bigger with fat not muscles the same was applying for most of his body. Especially his chest. He watched as his chest grew. It was no longer pecks. It was breasts. He lifted his shirt up and watched as he grew boobs. <br />
<br />
He was growing. He kept getting bigger and bigger. He watched as his hair got bigger, and his beard grew really fast too,<br />
“Jace, what the hell is happening to you. You’ve got boobs bigger than mine, and ass to match,”<br />
Jace turned around again, he looked at it in the mirror. It was going to be too big for the room soon. His eyes lit up,<br />
<br />
“The Sundial did this,” he said out loud,<br />
“The what!?” Blue shouted, very concerned for her brother at this point.<br />
<br />
His belly was getting too big for the door. At this point. His butt was almost as wide as his belly. His boobs were bigger than his head. He made for the door, he had to squeeze to get through. Blue pushed him through to help.<br />
Her brother was getting bigger by the second, he seemed like he knew what was going on so she’s help to get him to where he could be fixed.<br />
<br />
He headed for the ladder, he got stuck and was still growing.<br />
<br />
Blue quickly went to the kitchen and grabbed a hammer. She bashed on the floor until it broke. Her brother slipped through and was in his room. She went down after him.<br />
<br />
He was in his room. His hips were wider than most of the door frames. His belly bulged far out. As he walked past his desk, his butt was so big that it  knocked over his keyboard and mouse and brushed his computer. He turned around, his boobs swung as he did, they were twice the size of watermelons,<br />
“When the hell was there a door there?” Blue questioned,<br />
Jace didn’t respond, he grabbed the hammer off his sister and burst through the door. He still had his muscles underneath a huge amount of fat. The door broke.<br />
<br />
He looked at the Sundial. It was exactly the same. It was taunting him. <br />
<br />
Blue looked at the Sundial next to her brother. She watched as he took the hammer, and with full force, smashed the top of it. <br />
Covering herself with her arms for part of stone to go flying. They didn’t.<br />
<br />
She lowered her arms. Her brother suddenly turned into purple sparkles of dust. They retained his form as they suddenly burst apart. They flew into the sundial.<br />
<br />
“Jace...” she said, looking around, “Jace!” She shouted to him,<br />
<br />
“He can’t hear you, Blue,” a voice said in her ear, “he’s mine now.”<br />
<br />
“What the hell is wrong with you,” she shouted, crying now, “where is my brother, give him back!”<br />
<br />
“I can’t do that, Blue...” the voice stopped, “but here. I don’t do this often. No price.”<br />
<br />
The Sundial suddenly glowed a faint blue before stopping. Blue looked down at her chest. Her B cups grew to a C, then a D, then a DD. Her ass grew too, matching her boobs.<br />
“What the hell kind of gift is this,” she said, “give me my brother back.” She shouted, “give him back,”<br />
<br />
“Trust me, he’s alive, but he’s not a part of your world anymore,”<br />
<br />
The sundial began to shake, it suddenly sunk into the ground, leaving behind a square hole where it used to be. The hole sealed itself.<br />
<br />
Blue stood there, shaken.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What the hell had Jace done.</p>
