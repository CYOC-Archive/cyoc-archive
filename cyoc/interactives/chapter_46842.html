<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">About half an hour later, we were ready to enact our plan.  Alexa was right in that I had some misgivings about her ideas, but it wasn’t something that I couldn’t wish myself to get past.<br />
<br />
We fully clothed ourselves.  I used the ring to repair the torn clothes I had worn while Alexa found that she had indeed gone up a cup size from D to DD.  She didn’t mind, however, so she wished that all of her bras and bikini tops changed size to accommodate her enhanced breasts.<br />
<br />
We sat down on the couch in the living room and looked at each other.  “OK,” she said.  “You’re sure you’re ready to do this?”<br />
<br />
I replied, “Anything for you, my dear,” and kissed her on the lips.<br />
<br />
She pulled away sooner than I was ready and warned, “Better keep that down for a while,” she said.  “Otherwise I’ll want to change again, and we can’t do that right now.”<br />
<br />
“Good point,” I agreed.  “I wonder if we’ll ever be able to have sex as humans.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll find out some time,” she said.  “OK, let’s focus.”  She cleared her throat.  “I wish that Rick Altamonte would appear in this room at the end of this wish, that he would be unable to move so as not to try to leave or cause physical harm to either Joey or myself and that no one would notice that he suddenly disappears from his present location.”<br />
<br />
In less than a second a third person was standing in the living room in front of us.  He was about 6’1’’ and looked to be about 240 pounds of pure muscle mass.  He wore a tight muscle shirt and spandex shorts, which when coupled with the sweat on his body made it appear he had been at the gym.  He immediately appeared disoriented.  He looked around frantically as he tried to place himself.  I noticed that he was able to move his feet.  Evidently Alexa’s wish didn’t totally restrict his movement.  I certainly hoped the parts about him not wanting to leave and not harm us worked, but I wasn’t very worried that they would not.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” he asked in a booming voice.  Good thing this place was soundproof, I thought.  “Where am I?”<br />
<br />
I let Alexa do the talking.  “You’re in my friend…well, my lover Joey’s apartment, dear, sweet Rick,” she explained.  I couldn’t help but smile at being referred to as her “lover.”<br />
<br />
“Alexa, what is this?  What the fuck is going on he demanded?”<br />
<br />
“Ooh, to save time, I wish you would just let me explain and not ask so many questions,” she said.  Again I smiled.  Her idea to let her wish with the ring’s power was definitely a good idea.  “I’ve had a very interesting day today, Rick,” she explained.  “Joey here,” she indicated to me as I gave a smug wave to him, “has acquired something that grants any wishes he wants.  So he made a few wishes, and being my neighbor, I came over and some more wishes were made and here we are.”  Rick looked like he wanted to ask a question but found himself unable to do so.  She smiled at him.  “I can tell you want to ask a question but you can’t thanks to my wish.  Isn’t that right?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Y-yea,” he stammered, unsure of why that was really the case.<br />
<br />
 “I got to thinking,” Alexa continued.  “I’m just not a malicious person.  I don’t wish for bad things to happen to anyone, even people who treat me in a less than courteous manner.  That’s where you come in, big boy.”  She stopped and laughed.  “Remember when that was my nickname for you?  Well, you’ll laugh later.  Maybe,” she quickly added.  I wanted to laugh but kept it under control.  “You treated me like a pair of boobs that walked, Rick.  Being a model, that’s obviously all I was to you.  So when I took a stand for myself, that didn’t fit in with your plans, so tossed me aside and took up with little Kimmy.  Still going with her?” she asked.<br />
<br />
He scoffed.  “That bitch?  I’ve had at least a dozen since her,” her bragged.<br />
<br />
Alexa’s expression hardened.  “Dubious as that statement is, it might be true.  I don’t really care.  Too bad Kimmy had to learn the hard way.”  She stopped and the slight scowl that developed on her face turned into an evil grin.  “And that’s how you’re going to learn things, Rick.  The hard way.”  He didn’t say anything.  “You may ask questions now,” she said.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck is that supposed to mean, you crazy bitch?” he snapped.<br />
<br />
I was getting mad at him already.  “I’d appreciate it if you were a little more cordial,” I said.<br />
<br />
He focused his attention on me for the first time.  “Hey, man, I could snap you in two so—“<br />
<br />
I cut him off by asking, “Why don’t you then?”  I could sense Alexa get very nervous, but I needed to know he wouldn’t be able to do anything.  He tried to take a step toward me and found that he was unable to move.  With a broadening smile on my face, I got off the couch and walked closer to him so that I stood easily within arm’s length.  “Hit me,” I dared him.  He attempted to lift his arm but could not do it.  He tried the other with the same result.  “Can’t do it, huh?” I taunted.  I returned to the couch and saw the worry gone from Alexa’s face.<br />
<br />
She continued, “Face it, Rick.  Right now we control you totally and completely.  You can’t leave, you can’t hurt us.  You belong to us until we say otherwise.”<br />
<br />
Rick asked, “So you want revenge on me for dumping you?  That’s your own fault.  You knew what I was like, you’ve got no one to blame but you.”<br />
<br />
“Damn, you’re probably right,” she said.  “But that doesn’t mean you’re right to be that way.  There are a lot of admirable qualities you lack, Rick.  Like humility, courtesy, generosity, a lot of other basic qualities.  You’re practically a walking example of the deadly sins!  We want to change that.  We want to help you.”<br />
<br />
I took over the explanation.  “In order to do that, however, you’ve got to learn them.  Oh, sure, we could just give them to you, but there’s no fun in that.  And what’s the point of having this power if you can’t have some fun with it?  So let’s get started.”  <br />
<br />
I stood up from the couch and started to undress.  “What the fuck are you doing?” he said when he realized.<br />
<br />
Alexa took over again.  “Oh, that’s right, my mistake.  I wish you would strip nude, too, Rick,” she said as she grinned wide.<br />
<br />
“What?” he asked, but before he could get an explanation he had removed his shirt which displayed his prominent pecs and six-pack abs.  “Why am I doing this?” he demanded as he removed his shoes.<br />
<br />
“We’ve gone over that, Rick,” Alexa said.  “Try to keep up, please.  I know it can be hard for you to think on your feet, but you’re not that dumb.”<br />
<br />
When we were both naked, I took a full assessment of his body.  Of course it was better than mine.  His cock was certainly bigger, too.  I never understood why woman cared about size, but that didn’t matter right now.  I walked behind him.  “What are you doing?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“You’ll see,” Alexa answered for me.  “Now, Rick, I wish you would bend over at the waist.”  He obliged.  “You see, Rick, I’ve told Joey how our primary sexual encounter was you doing me in the ass and how I always hated it.  It’s time for you to find out why.”  Before Rick could raise an objection she looked at me and said, “Joey, I wish that your cock would grow to match the length of Rick’s cock.”<br />
<br />
I had already, in my mind, agreed to this change.  I felt a different kind of tingling in my cock as it remained of human species but still grew in size.  As I waited for my cock to add another, I guessed, four inches or so, I said, “I wish this won’t disgust me as much as I think it might.”  I didn’t have anything against homosexuality, to be sure, but it didn’t appeal to me and so I had no idea what this might feel like.  But Rick deserved what was coming to him.<br />
<br />
Rick then realized what was about to happen.  “No, get the fuck away from me, you fag!” he screamed.<br />
<br />
“Nope,” I said simply.  The tingling in my cock ended, I wished for it to become erect immediately and I inserted it into his ass.  I was not any kind of master at anal sex with a woman, let alone a man, so it took some effort before I felt like I was in the right spot.  As soon as I did I started to pump as hard and as vigorous as I could.<br />
<br />
“Oh, god, no!” Rick screamed.  “Stop it!  Ow!  It hurts!”<br />
<br />
Alexa bent down in front of him.  “Of course it does, Rick.  Even people who like anal sex will tell you that it hurts.  Trouble is I never liked it.  I did it for you.  I told you I didn’t like it, and you didn’t care.  And you still dumped me just because I wasn’t going to be some bimbo trophy for you.”<br />
<br />
“OK, OK!” he scream as I kept going harder and faster.  “I’m sorry!  I—ow—I didn’t mean it!”<br />
<br />
“There, there, Rick,” she said as she stroked his face gently.  “You’re a terrible liar.  Even if I did believe you, this would still happen.  And let’s be honest, Rick.  The best is yet to come.”  She took a step back from him and said, “I wish that as you continue to get butt-fucked you would lose all of your precious muscles and turn into a scrawny, 5’4”, 100 pound weakling!”<br />
<br />
“What?!?” he screamed as he looked up in pure horror.  The changes happened instantly.  Muscles shrank and disappeared into every part of his body.  He got thinner in every possible place: arms, legs, pecs, abs, glutes.  Most of his natural body weight went with the loss of muscle weight as he began to shrink in size.  That was fine with me.  I didn’t really like what I was doing, though it was not disgusting me, but I still wanted to get this over with as quickly as possible.  <br />
<br />
When I started to violate his precious body he had tried to resist as much as he could.  However since he could not physically harm me, there was little he could do.  Now as his body changed from hulking to lacking, any form of resistance quickly subsided.  He was defeated.<br />
<br />
The changes took only two minutes to fully manifest.  Once I felt the changes end, I pulled out of him.  He fell to the floor in a heap.  He was quietly whimpering and trying his best to not let us hear him.  He was not successful.  Deep down I wanted to feel sorry for him.  I just could not.  Some of the other things Alexa told me about him made me want to make him suffer some more.<br />
<br />
And suffer he would, for Rick Altamonte’s nightmare was far from over.</p>
