<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer, after putting back the phone at it&#39;s place, searched the her room a bit for the missing part of her outfit. She hurried to the bus stop, barely reaching it in time. Out of breath, she quickly composes herself for the day. She wouldn&#39;t want to look disheveled in front of the boys! She enters the bus, and scan the seats, searching for familiar faces. Susan, a friend from her cheerleading squad waves at her from the back. Jennifer quickly dodge other passengers to go and sit next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeey! Jenny howsit going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing ok... I&#39;ve had a bit of problem with-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah that&#39;s real interesting, but seriously you gotta look at this! So, you know how Mathew was like, all over me recently, even if I was soooo over with him. He kept clinging and clinging! He was like, so annoying! But then, he just posted a photo of him with another girl! He seriously is trying to make me think he&#39;s done? For real, I really...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer sighed as her &quot;friend&quot; kept chanting about gossip and her own little personal drama. All of them were like this, the cheer squad. She got used to it, and sometimes, she can&#39;t help but join in with what they say. It&#39;s what cool girls do.<br />
<br />
The long ride to school was sandwiched with meaningless chatter about breakups from all around the school. Jennifer tried not to let her relief be seen as the vehicle finally cease it&#39;s movement. Susan finished with a last &quot;He&#39;s never going to see the end of this!&quot; before they both get up at their stop. The cheer practice always happened on saturdays, so the school was mostly empty when they got in. The quiet ambience was a stark contrast to the usual chaos that these walls concealed, and Jennifer always felt a little something when entering it in this foreign state.<br />
<br />
In the girl&#39;s locker room, the multiple beauties of the town resided, they cheered as their leader, Jennifer, entered the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny! We&#39;re so ready for today&#39;s repetitions! I practiced the poses like you told me to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear Brad is like... the best guy around! His dick feels so good when... Oh, hi Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jen, what is it today? Trying to tease someone we&#39;re not aware of?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen, confused by this last comment, brushed it off, but as she reached for her locker she noticed it. She forgot to wear a bra. Well, it&#39;s not like it was that bad right? Maybe she&#39;ll get the chance to get some guys in the audience... maybe even a night with him. She could flex on the other girls afterward about how good he felt, that would make them envy her more...<br />
<br />
__________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
The practise came and went without much events going. There were indeed guys in the audience, and the whistles from them were clearly directed to her. Especially during flips, where her bossom wasn&#39;t shy of bouncing. After they had finished, the spectators weren&#39;t shy of going to each and one of them to ask for a little &quot;moment in private&quot;. Jennifer felt a bit of pression as a lot of them went to her. Did she really want that right now? Not really, in fact, she often gets sex or &quot;boyfriends&quot; simply because it&#39;s what all the others of the squad do. She&#39;s never had taste for all of this... <br />
<br />
Declining all of them was difficult, especially the most insistent of them. She manage to excuse herself away. Since they got the day left, the cheerleaders often hang out inside the school until the end of the day. Since it&#39;s in a weekend, there&#39;s nobody to watch, so they can do wathever they want. Jennifer walked around, she really didn&#39;t want to meet any more of the girls, she was too tired for that. Her eyes lingered on the door of the library. Why not after all?<br />
<br />
She entered, the quiet ambience giving a cozy feeling. She sat to and fiddled on her phone for a bit, before spotting students in the corner. It&#39;s true that the school was open for people to come in during saturdays, but who would willingly come to school during weekends if it&#39;s not for sports or cheer? A second look, and the answer made itself quite clear. It&#39;s the kids of the chess clubs, some reputed nerds who gets bullied all around school. There&#39;s one of the guys in there who her and the team pantsed a week or so ago. Jennifer internally hoped that he&#39;s okay now. She searched around the room for a sight of any witness, and seeing none, she got up in the intent to go apologize to him. She would never do that in front of anyone, to keep her reputation, but the remorse she felt right now was enough to convince her.<br />
<br />
Well, that was until, halfway through, Susan and Kyra entered library, laughing audibly. It made the chess club turn and and recede, maybe hoping not to get picked on again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jenny! What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah why would you ever come he- Oh, I see now!&quot; She glanced at the group in the corner. &quot;You want to give the nerds a lesson!&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan turned too, now smiling at them. &quot;Haha! You dweebs are all there! What is it? Losers can&#39;t get their eyes away from the books?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer watched as the chess club got picked on again. Their eyes full of resentment, but also powerlessness. Yeah she feels bad for them... but couldn&#39;t they just be normal? That would solve their problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Susan, Kyra... let&#39;s just go...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! You bunch of geeks don&#39;t deserve our time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Piss off!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer and the two laughing girls exits the room. The day is starting to turn late, so with a final goodbye, Jen arrive at her bus stop, exhausted after the day.</p>
