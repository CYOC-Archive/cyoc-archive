<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...and Jeff closed his... Jeff hadn&#39;t remembered what letting Jenny out was always like... Just kind of a dull nothingness... There was some amount of knowledge coming in... some general idea of plans, conversations, knowledge from learning... It&#39;s just all second hand though as there seemed to be nothing for Jeff to do till... A hole in the ceiling of nothingness popped open and Jenny&#39;s head poked out from the top and said &quot;Oh... That worked... Hey... Me I guess?&quot; <br />
&quot;Are we really the same person?&quot; Jeff asked seeing the mental representation of Jenny talk to his mental representation. <br />
&quot;Maybe, we were just talking about some special internal chat thing, and apparently if I can reach you we can swap like this... we&#39;re in class though so I&#39;m just gonna... Leave you here... I guess...&quot; Then there you were just left back in that void of nothingness again... <br />
Jeff did nothing all the way until &quot;Hey... So my friend wanted to ask you, but was a little too shy to do it herself... Do you think Emily&#39;s cute?&quot; Jeff stared for a second... He was aware of Emily, and was also unsure if he had ever seen Emile her other half... He guessed she was cute? She never really thought of her that way, but really?<br />
&quot;You open up this room in our soul or something just to ask me that?&quot; Jeff asked<br />
Jenny blushed a bit and said &quot;I mean... Yes! I dunno, we&#39;ve always been together but apart and... I always felt so alone in here, but... Just wanted to give you a little company every now and then.&quot;<br />
Jeff stared up and noticed Jenny&#39;s mental self and his were naked &quot;And this isn&#39;t awkward in anyway?&quot; Jenny blushed a bit redder and left Jeff to stew for awhile... It was hard to tell when time passed in here, and it felt quicker in a way. The next thing Jeff felt was his mental self shift and transform... Jeff looked at her mental self again and saw breasts, hips, and no dick. <br />
&quot;Hey! I came to come in and...&quot; Jenny said and then yelped as she seemed to slip into the black room again. The hole in the ceiling seemed just high enough that one of them could get out if the other gave a boost. Then there the two of them were both in the box of nothing staring at each other. <br />
&quot;...You found the chronivac&quot; Jeff&#39;s high pitched voice stated accusingly at Jenny <br />
&quot;Well... I just wanted to talk, and... I was uncomfortable around your body, and... and maybe a little self-conscious being naked in front of a guy ok?&quot;<br />
Jeff looked back at what Jenny had uncovered through their shared knowledge and memories &quot;...And you know that I at least haven&#39;t been at your side our whole lives.&quot; <br />
&quot;Yeah, this machine just doubled our population or something effectively... Unless I was just kicking somewhere in that horny subconscious of yours all along.&quot; The two sat, not exactly cold in this realm of thought. <br />
&quot;I guess... do you even like existing like this? Like maybe we could go back to our old reality but maybe as like just twins or something?&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure that&#39;d be for the best... Even if I&#39;m alright, even if all the others were alright... Wouldn&#39;t that cause even weirder issues? Besides you and me are the same in a way.&quot; The two looked at each other for a second...<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m already gender swapped in two ways... Want to try being a guy?&quot; Jeff asked? <br />
&quot;Can I?&quot; Jenny asked then thought and said &quot;Let me try to get you out, you&#39;re better at the computer stuff than me anyways, and we&#39;re in girl clothes anyways.&quot; Jenny gave Jeff a piggyback ride as Jeff climbed out of the hole, their body... didn&#39;t actually shift. All Jenny did was give Jeff a gb... which it turned out was exactly Jenny&#39;s form. Jeff looked at herself a bit better now in the real world in... Well Jenny&#39;s form. So Jeff went to the chronivac and saw that it had a split entry for Jeff and Jenny. Sort of two entries yet one at the same time. Jeff went to Jenny&#39;s entry and switched her sex... Looking at the clock it was getting late so Jeff went to get ready for bed, brushed her teeth and all that, and when she closed her eyes she popped back into the void box where Jenny was. The void felt warmer and cozier than Jeff remembered. There was his mental male form waiting for... well her now. <br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to have to wait till all our laundry is done done you know?&quot;<br />
Jenny chuckled &quot;Yeah, but well now we can actually interact.&quot; The two lay next to each other and Jenny offered his hand which Jeff accepted and they could feel the warmth of each other. It was nice and intimate... Jeff had imagined that Jenny and her would have a more sibling like relationship, but that wasn&#39;t true... The two were one even if they were two. They had different sexualities and were straight, and in this mental realm... Was this incest? or was it just masturbation, especially when there wasn&#39;t any actual penetration happening? The events were hazy, but the two felt happy together and truly one. <br />
<br />
Jeff then woke up, the one in control and felt inside of herself and Jenny no longer felt completely lonely in their mental space. Jeff may not have been there with him, but they had a stronger connection now that they had found each other. Jeff went through Jenny&#39;s usual routine, and started with breakfast where...</p>
