<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jade did feel fairly relaxed as she made her way into the dining area at Moon Lake&#39;s hospital around noontime. For some patients there was food delivery, but while pregnancy counted as one of those patients that would be able to have food delivered, she was actually feeling much better now. There were still some concerns in her mind over the loss of Dymixious, and in many ways she would miss him, but she couldn&#39;t blame law enforcement groups for doing their job and she could see where he had made the situation worse. And while she respected and understood Dymixious and his father&#39;s wishes to protect the were secret and take care of potential rogue weres, she didn&#39;t want Hope in that kind of atmosphere. That was why she&#39;d accepted the offer to stay in Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
And that offer was what had her presently moving around the hospital while waiting for a formal dismissal from the hospital. She had recovered from the pain and strains of giving birth to Hope, and she was actually physically more than ready head out. However, there was still the issue that remained with the fact that the home that she and Dymixious had been given to stay in while they were &quot;hiding&quot; in Moon Lake was something of a safe house the city owned for certain and special occasions, which the FBI&#39;s identifying Dymixious as the murderer of Lionel Ulysses and the unusual circumstances that related to the were secret certainly applied. However, the fact that her husband had been killed there was something that she didn&#39;t quite feel comfortable with staying there, and thus lead to the present meeting and as she looked across the dining area and its rather calm décor and found the one responsible for the offer that would allow her and Hope to remain in Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Ms. Twist,&quot; Jade spoke calmly as she approached Samantha, who was seated at one of the tables with a small briefcase seated beside her.<br />
<br />
Jade also caught the scent what smelled like chicken and guessed that the town&#39;s Town Chancellor had already ordered her lunch from the hospital&#39;s cafeteria. Samantha turned and gave a small smile and nod as Jade made her way around the table toward the bench on the opposite side of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Samantha asked calmly to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fairly well, all things considered,&quot; Jade commented, &quot;Ready to head out though... WITH Hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Samantha gave a nod, &quot;I don&#39;t think this should take too long. If you want to get something to eat first... I can wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade glanced over to the serving trays and then to the plate of food that was already in front of Samantha. What Samantha had was rather simple, a piece of chicken with a serving of white rice, and a small bowl of fruit slices, and was fairly typical of what Jade had tasted among the hospital&#39;s food so far. It wasn&#39;t bad, though she did have to admit that it probably could be better. However, she was a bit hungry and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; Jade spoke and then turned toward the line.<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded and waited and watched as Jade with through the line. Jade ultimately returned with a plate of food similar to what Samantha had. Samantha watched as Jade sat down and casually began eating for a few moments. Samantha ate as well for a few moments before they got to the main part of their meeting, which related to finding a place for Jade to stay in Moon Lake and any and all potential work for her. Some of the circumstances in the meeting might be a bit different, but the exact nature of the work did fall within Samantha&#39;s normal work as Moon Lake&#39;s Town Chancellor. And there were a few open spots available for Jade and her daughter Hope, usually the result of the various reasons that houses in Moon Lake opened up. These reasons usually related to work opportunities that would seem them leave Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what about a place to live?&quot; Jade asked Samantha.<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded and passed a slip of paper across the table. Jade took it with one hand while eating with the other. She noted that they were a list of addresses, though a couple were listed as apartment buildings. Samantha was quick to explain as she unfolded a small map of the town, which gave Jade a full look at the town&#39;s unique wagon wheel shape. It was fairly interesting and Jade listened in as Samantha explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are all the other homes and apartments in Moon Lake that are presently open to be bought or rented,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;some aren&#39;t much, but could be quite cozy for you and Hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade looked between the list in her hands and the map that Samantha had laid before her. She noticed that the locations on the list were colored in with a orange highlighter. In a way that was helpful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they clean?&quot; Jade asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They should be,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;at worst you&#39;ll have is some dusting to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade nodded and looked over the list again and then at the map. She then pointed to one point on the map, which was indicated as a small cottage.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; Jade wondered.<br />
<br />
Samantha then looked at that one in particular and then nodded. She noted that it was across the street from Jacob and Josephine Decker&#39;s home, according to Moon Lake&#39;s registry<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a relatively small cottage,&quot; Samantha explained, &quot;I think it was originally built by a werebear that wanted to get away from it all as it were... though he was rather old. I think he died a few years ago... of old age. But it is a good home... with two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a laundry room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about bathrooms?&quot; Jade asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has one bathroom,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;but it is a good home... though most of the time families that have moved in have often wanted more space.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds...&quot; Jade said slowly and paused to give a small smile, &quot;understandable... after all... families can tend to get bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha chuckled and gave a slow nod. She noticed however that Jade seemed more focused on the little cottage, perhaps because it was quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it quiet though?&quot; Jade asked, &quot;would people in the area mind Hope?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope was precious, and the hospital staff in the maternity ward did a lot to care for Hope. Jade was grateful for that, especially as it allowed for her to attend this lunchtime meeting, but she was well aware of how potentially disruptive a baby could be. She remembered living with her sister and her family before meeting and marrying Dymixious, becoming a werekomododragon in the process. Her sister had had a baby shortly before Dymixious came into her life and Jade remembered being kept up at night when her niece was fussy. Part of her chuckled at the ironic thoughts she&#39;d had back then at wanting to get away from her infant niece&#39;s cries and now that she was a mother, herself, Jade wanted to be there for Hope as much as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should have no problem,&quot; Samantha gave a small smile, &quot;You&#39;ll have good neighbors... with a normal family across the street, the mother likes to garden and the father is a Vietnam vet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have a son or daughter?&quot; Jade wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A son... Jeffery Decker, an officer with the US Marine Corps, murdered by Lionel Ulysses,&quot; Samantha answered.<br />
<br />
Jade blinked and then nodded. That was probably something of a warning, though a part of her figured they would probably be a bit relieved that their son&#39;s killer wasn&#39;t a threat to them anymore. However, drawing attention to that wasn&#39;t what Jade wanted. It would only lead to fights and irritation, the very thing that got Dymixious killed. She then watched as Samantha fiddled with something in her briefcase and then presented some pictures of the cottage. It wasn&#39;t huge, but it did look nice and there was a sort of garage next to it. It did look quiet, and Jade liked it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks rather nice,&quot; Jade spoke, &quot;I think... I think I&#39;ll go with the cottage... Someplace quiet I can raise Hope in and still help weres from... right?&quot;</p>
